0	16960	This week it's been enough generations that everything old is new again.
16960	20360	Katamari Damacy Encore was just the first of Bandai Namco's offerings with many more
20360	22120	to come, at least in Japan.
22120	24900	This is just one revival in tonight's news, stay tuned for the rest, starting right now
24900	28000	on the show where every gamer has a voice.
28000	35880	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
35880	37600	where every gamer has a voice.
37600	44600	It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 793, whoops at that title,
44600	48560	for September the 22nd of 2019.
48560	52900	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm going to fix away at this title here that's incorrect on
52900	58260	our Twitch TV stream, because we do tape live, errors and all, every Sunday night at
58260	62380	the Voice of Geeks Network, Twitch TV slash VOG Network.
62380	66020	And while I'm fixing away that title, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
66020	67020	Hello.
67020	68020	How are you, Loki?
68020	69020	I'm fine.
69020	70020	Good.
70020	74040	Me too, except for the little broken chat there, or sorry, the broken title and then
74040	77040	my broken chat over here as well.
77040	80920	So Twitch started doing this thing where you can do community gifting, which is really
80920	81920	cool.
81940	85300	It's like, if you're a Twitch Prime person, you can throw items into this chest and people
85300	90180	are doing that right now in our chat room and at some point later during the show, around
90180	93380	the time we take a break, what we'll do is we're going to open the chest and all the
93380	96840	non Twitch Prime people, it'll give it away at random.
96840	99660	So because Twitch Prime people already have it, so it's like you're putting your extra
99660	100660	copies or whatever.
100660	101660	I don't know.
101660	102660	It gives you three codes to get away.
102660	105580	You put it in this treasure chest and then we get to dole out all that loot to all the
105580	107820	non Twitch Prime subscribers in chat.
107820	108820	So it's fun.
108840	112960	The problem is it kind of breaks the chat room on my side because it keeps hounding
112960	115680	me like, donate more, put more in the chest.
115680	116680	I'm like, okay.
116680	117680	Do it.
117680	120280	And it's, I'm happy to do that, but it's just like, Oh my God.
120280	122920	Then it like breaks the little chat sidebar.
122920	126300	So now I have to reopen it, but whatever.
126300	127300	I'll deal with it.
127300	129360	I will get around to your chat comments here very soon.
129360	131760	As soon as I can actually read it.
131760	133400	In the meantime, how was your week, Loki?
133400	134760	How have you been?
134760	135760	It's been okay.
135780	139580	I didn't do a whole lot this week.
139580	141820	I did play some more laser tag though.
141820	147420	We went yesterday and I'm just kind of like, I was going to take the kids out cause my
147420	150340	wife is going out with some friends to eat.
150340	154580	And so I took the kids out to go eat and then we had like, it was around seven o'clock.
154580	159560	We can squeeze in a game of laser tag before they have to go to bed, I guess.
159560	163500	So we squeezed in a game of laser tag and it was just the three of us.
163500	169500	And then like, as we were leaving, then there's like, Oh, all these other people want to play
169500	172360	and it's like, okay, let's play with them.
172360	178980	And then it was just like a ton of people and we just just destroyed them.
178980	182400	Like it was just, well, there's actually people going there now.
182400	183400	You said a ton of people.
183400	185600	Well, yeah, it ended up working out.
185600	190120	I think it was just a fluke, but like, yeah, there's like at least like 15, 20 people in
190120	193220	the game and I, we just destroyed them.
193220	197880	And when I say we, I mean myself and my kids, cause my kids are actually doing all right.
197880	200560	Like they know how to like tag people and stuff.
200560	203720	And my one youngest son likes flanking people.
203720	206440	Some dads will go out there and throw the baseball with their kids.
206440	209480	You teach people, you teach your kids how to annihilate others at laser tag.
209480	210480	Yes.
210480	211480	Fun.
211480	212480	Yes.
212480	213480	I like that.
213480	216200	Anyhow, since I was, I was distracted by broken title and distracted by broken chat room,
216200	220400	I forgot to address, hello, where's dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
220400	222160	She's not here tonight.
222160	223200	She's a little under the weather.
223200	225100	She's she's got a voice thing going on.
225100	229780	So because she has to talk for her job, she felt it would be best to take the night off
229780	230780	and rest her voice.
230780	233940	And we can certainly understand that work is very important.
233940	236080	So work is work is the most important thing.
236080	239300	In fact, I just found out, well, I mean, it's a good thing.
239300	242740	I'm going to be traveling for work and I love to do the travel thing, but we're not going
242740	245420	to have a show towards the end of October because of it.
245420	250020	So work comes first sometimes y'all and that's where a dark soccer is taken care of herself.
250020	251020	So she can be ready for work.
251020	252160	So she's not here tonight.
252160	254020	She may pop into chat though.
254020	255020	I see slag kick.
255020	256020	Hello.
256020	257640	Isn't our chat room saying heart for dark soccer.
257640	261300	If she's here in chat, she has been known to pop into the chat room sometimes when she's
261300	264660	not here, but she also may be using this time to catch up on errands.
264660	266780	I don't know, but for whatever reason, she's not, or I'm sorry.
266780	272300	We know the reason, but whether she's here in chat or I'm not, God, now I've got, look
272300	273300	at this, look at this.
273300	277100	Now my phone's popping up telemarketer or you can't see that on the thing.
277100	279640	Telemarketer is calling me my God.
279640	281100	Can anything.
281120	282840	That's the worst name for a company.
282840	283840	I know, right?
283840	287120	No, it actually, did you know that the phones show that to you now it'll say like telemarketer
287120	292520	or potential spam or yeah, it'll actually show you when, uh, it's, it's suspects.
292520	295280	It's kind of a bullshit call or something going on.
295280	298800	So yeah, anyway, let's talk about video games.
298800	300840	My God, get this show on track people.
300840	302760	It's been a great week for games.
302760	306520	We've had a lot of big games that came out this week, namely, uh, links awakening on
306520	307520	the switch.
307520	310740	A lot of people are playing that game and having a blast with that game.
310740	313100	Um, I, I actually was playing that game quite a bit.
313100	314860	I'll talk a little more about it in my gaming week.
314860	316300	Have you, have you checked out links awakening?
316300	319220	I just picked it up, but I haven't played it yet.
319220	322940	My kids had played it or my son's played it, but he doesn't understand what to do in that.
322940	326700	So his game right now is I'm collecting rupees.
326700	327980	That's all I'm doing is collecting rupees.
327980	328980	Not a bad thing.
328980	329980	Having money is good.
329980	330980	It'll lie to buy.
330980	331980	That's all he's doing.
331980	334060	He's like, I'm like, well, you can have your brother help you with reading and stuff.
334060	335700	He's like, well, I don't do the readings.
335700	339920	So I'm just going to cut the, that's me playing games too.
339920	341560	I don't read.
341560	343120	So I'm like, okay, well that's cool.
343120	344800	You know, you can do whatever you want in the game.
344800	345800	That's fine.
345800	347960	I'm like, why don't you play the untitled goose game instead?
347960	350600	So um, another big game that came out this week.
350600	353960	So I picked that up and I think they were playing that too.
353960	354960	And he had fun.
354960	358920	I'm trying to create a picnic cause I know that's one of the, uh, goals you have to do
358920	359920	in the game.
359920	360920	All right.
360920	362480	Well, I won't get too ahead of ourselves and get into our gaming weeks.
362480	366340	Let's get into our kickoff topic though, uh, which is a pretty big, uh, international
366340	367340	story, I suppose.
367340	370780	But this is one of those things that you kind of wonder how could this trickle down and
370780	372720	affect other places.
372720	373720	So Loki.
373720	374720	Yeah.
374720	382060	So apparently valve in 2015 was sued by an organization in France called, uh, UFC, Q,
382060	387180	uh, I can't even pronounce what it was, but, uh, French legal words.
387180	388180	Yes.
388180	390700	So it's, um, some organization there.
390720	398640	And basically, uh, they were saying that, uh, out of this, the ruling stated that, well,
398640	399640	basically this backup.
399640	405720	So valve was saying that they were basically selling like a service for these games.
405720	412320	It was like a subscription to them versus, um, you know, actually owning copies of the
412320	413320	games.
413320	419800	Well, apparently the court decided that, no, they're not selling a subscription service.
419800	425380	That's not compelling argument and users should be allowed to resell games.
425380	428740	Um, so that is what's happening there.
428740	435180	So apparently now in France, valve has to allow users to resell their games.
435180	439620	Now this, you know, the, the resale of digital games, I think is something that, you know,
439620	443020	a lot of us now, obviously, again, this is happening in France.
443020	447020	This is a French court decision and you know, just because it happened there doesn't mean
447020	452280	it's something that's going to happen in the US or Canada or Mexico or Japan or wherever
452280	454660	our listeners are that happened to be listening to this show.
454660	459920	But sometimes where one place goes, other places tend to follow.
459920	463080	And I think, you know, many of us that have been playing digital games, I mean, how many
463080	465120	of y'all out there buy digital games?
465120	467800	And I'm sure many hands in the room just went up, right?
467800	473100	And many of you are buying digital games probably for that convenience, digital games, uh, sometimes
473100	477000	because these games go on like deep discount sales and they're pretty hard to resist, right?
477000	478880	Like the, uh, humble bundles, right?
478880	479880	That's all digital sales.
479880	480880	Right.
480880	485120	So, um, you know, y'all have probably bought a digital game or two in your day or hell
485120	491720	if you've ever gotten one of the free games on Epic store, Epic game store, right, then
491720	495160	that is a digital transaction, even though it's like free or whatever, uh, PlayStation
495160	501020	plus X-Box games of gold and all this you're getting, you're participating in the digital
501020	504920	distribution of games, which as we know is getting bigger and bigger in our industry.
504920	507060	It's getting so big in this industry.
507060	511360	We just had a story on last week's show about the GameStop struggling because the industry
511360	512360	has changed.
512360	517120	GameStop's having to compete with the local GameStop here and they've actually remodeled
517120	518120	quite a bit.
518120	521480	Um, you see a lot of that pot, they have a whole section that, well, they've always had
521480	525000	a section for pop figs, but now it's more prominent by the door.
525000	529160	Um, and this doesn't necessarily mean that things are going to change because they still
529160	530520	have an appeal.
530520	536640	Um, also the judge ruled that, um, they have to comply within a month's time.
536640	542160	If they don't, then they'll have to pay a fine of 3000 euros per day, up to six months.
542160	543480	They may just take the fine.
543480	546260	If you think about it, wow.
546260	550320	So they could probably, if they feel that they're going to lose more money after all,
550320	553800	they could just, there's going to be a meeting at valve headquarters up there in Washington
553800	554800	on Monday.
554800	559160	There's going to be a big meet and Gabe Newell's going to be in that meeting because something's
559160	560440	going to have to happen here.
560440	561440	You're right.
561440	562440	Either.
562440	563440	They're just going to suck it up and take the fine.
563440	567320	Uh, do you, do you think there's a possibility steam pulls out of France?
567320	569120	Steam says, you know what, fuck it.
569120	570120	I'm out.
570120	571120	They could.
571120	575400	I mean, if the, if the amount of money that they're making from that territory isn't worth
575400	581800	it, then they could just easily block people in France from using the service.
581800	582800	Wow.
582800	587960	So, and, and so we may see that's interesting because if steam does pull out of France and
587960	591720	I know this is a very like pie in the sky type of thing, I imagine there will be appeals
591720	595360	and all that stuff, but I don't, I don't know if the French courts work like the courts
595360	598760	here because I think, Oh, when a judgment comes out in America, it'll be tied up in
598760	600720	appeals courts for years to come.
600720	605200	But this is a very like defined, you start this in 30 days or you're getting paid, you're
605200	606360	going to be paying a fine.
606360	609840	That seems pretty definitive as opposed to what I might hear if this were coming out
609840	611920	at an, uh, out of an American court.
611920	612920	Right?
612920	613920	Yeah.
613920	614920	Yeah.
614920	615920	Our court system is notorious for being slow as hell.
615920	616920	Right.
617880	618880	Anyway.
618880	619880	Yeah.
619880	622880	I mean, it's, it's possible that they just pull out of France altogether or, you know,
622880	624240	maybe they'll move forward with it.
624240	625240	Who knows?
625240	627520	But it was, Oh, I was going to say, we might get to see you.
627520	630720	You remember how Gabe has this big red button on his desk.
630720	631720	Okay.
631720	635240	I'm kind of making this up, but in theory, he has a big red button on his desk.
635240	640960	And if steam ever goes down or is like closed and shuts down, that button gets pushed and
640960	642120	what happens?
642120	648420	That means the DRM it's gone and you will get access to your games without needing steam.
648420	654120	We may, we may be 30 days from seeing that button get pushed in France.
654120	659700	I doubt that, but it's interesting to see them argue the game licenses because you know,
659700	662840	with most software nowadays, you don't own the software.
662840	667360	You're just licensing, licensing, licensing it from the company.
667360	672040	And so that's why they're saying, Oh, resale's not really allowed there because it's a digital
672040	673040	license.
673040	678400	But the argument that they made there with the court was that word, just digital subscription
678400	685120	service, meaning that think of it like Netflix, where I pay $10 a month and I get access to
685120	686120	all these titles.
686120	690760	Whereas this is more like paying money and getting access to the title.
690760	692160	That's why I didn't end up flying.
692160	696720	You might be able to say that if your PlayStation network or Xbox games with gold or even game
696720	699040	pass, I think something like that might be fine.
699040	704320	I think if it was one of them on trial, they could probably get away with that, but valve,
704320	708320	not so much, which by the way, would be the exact same setup as Google stadia.
708320	709320	Right?
709320	712680	I mean, I realized there's a difference here because steam is a store.
712680	713680	Google is going to be streaming.
713680	717040	It's, it's like a way to play the game, but Google will be selling you.
717040	723300	It's not, and Google has even said on the record, this is not the Netflix model, right?
723300	725760	So what happens here could affect Google stadia.
725760	727680	Google's probably watching what's happening in France.
727680	731360	Google's I still don't know how Google stadia is going to work.
731360	735640	Hey, you pay us $10 a month for like 4k or whatever it is.
735640	736640	And you get nothing with that.
736640	737640	All right.
737640	740760	I'm going to turn this car around before it turns into a Google thing.
740760	744880	Cause this really is about the valve and this, this whole thing going on.
744880	750080	So you know what, okay, let me, let me say this too, because I bet a lot of the listeners
750080	754720	and a lot of, you know, and even there's that part of me that goes, well, Hey, it's about
754720	755720	time.
755720	759080	The other thing that's been a limitation to me buying games digitally is that they have
759080	760400	no equity, right?
760400	765400	They have no, no value once you have them in your library, because you cannot turn around
765400	766640	and resell them.
766640	771000	Whereas I'm sure many of you grew up in an era where when you were done with your Nintendo
771000	775880	game or your super Nintendo game or your PlayStation PS two game, depending on how old you are,
775880	779240	you could take that game, sell it to somebody else.
779240	784800	I remember going onto a BBS and selling my NES cartridges to another person.
784800	787320	And obviously this is the whole thing behind GameStop, right?
787320	788800	The sale of used games.
788800	794800	Well, now if what happens in France, you know, is goes through and really happens, then you're
794800	797440	going to have all these digital games that have equity.
797440	802220	And I think most people are probably cheering or celebrating that because it's yay, my games
802220	803220	have value.
803220	808880	Well, the problem is, so it doesn't really hurt the platform holder too much because
808880	812680	yeah, I'm sure that they would be totally fine with selling used games.
813200	820240	Let's just say we go the model with the Steam items that they have, whether it be Counter
820240	825320	Strike stuff or it could be, you know, card packs or whatever.
825320	829360	They take a portion of that profit every time there's a sale.
829360	832520	And you could say, oh, well, we could give some of that to the developer as well.
832520	837160	But in the end, it ends up hurting the developer because, you know, I could buy this indie
837160	842200	game for $14.99 or I could pay whatever the use price is for it.
842720	847320	Well, Counterpoint, haven't we gone down this road before when the used game market first
847320	850600	started to show itself or held the video game rental market?
850600	852540	Didn't Nintendo hate that shit?
852540	855640	Like isn't that why there was a code with StarTropics?
855640	860160	Like Nintendo actually designed a game where you could not get past the halfway point or
860160	861720	wherever it was, two thirds point.
861720	864880	You could not get past that point without a secret letter that you dip in water.
864880	867400	Now, look, we all know that code is everywhere now.
867400	869080	It's 747, right?
869080	871340	You should know that code by now.
871340	876140	But the reality is Nintendo did that to try to fight the rental market and some of that
876140	877140	stuff.
877140	880380	I mean, it wasn't the most brilliant plan in the world, but they did take a page out
880380	883100	of Computer Gaming's book, right?
883100	889020	Remember when this software is copy protected, turn to page 34 in the manual and match the
889020	891540	design with, right?
891540	895860	That was all the combat used gaming and rental gaming and all that shit, right?
895860	901700	So one could argue we've been down this road before, the industry sided with the gamer
901700	904780	and having equity in the game, we weren't ruined.
904780	906260	So what makes this different now?
906260	912060	Well, it's because indie game, I think it's because the indie game development, you have
912060	917180	a lot of, there's like hundreds of developers out there just putting out these products,
917180	920260	making barely any money off of the software.
920260	923740	And now you're saying, oh boy, you're gonna make even less off of it now.
923740	927120	So it's kind of about like the indie game specifically, because now we live in an era,
927120	931840	you know, when we were talking to Star Tropics, NES cartridge era, every game was 50 bucks.
931840	935980	You know, maybe 40, maybe if you found a sale, it would be a little cheaper.
935980	936980	Every game was expensive.
936980	939920	And I get it, like there's the same amount of copies out there still.
939920	945420	So like, if you're, I remember the use game argument was, well, you know, back when they
945420	949340	were selling the online pass, you know, oh, well, if you buy a used copy of the buy an
949340	953660	online pass because we have to keep our servers running and shit like that, which didn't make
953660	958340	any sense because they already made that money the first time when they sold it originally.
958340	960800	But now this is a digital copy.
960800	962700	And I guess you could make the same argument for that.
962700	966580	But a lot of these indie studios, I don't think are necessarily charging like they don't
966580	971220	have that same model where they're charging you for an online pass or something like that.
971220	975500	So it would end up hurting these studios a lot more because they're making less money
975500	976500	off of it.
976500	980500	And plus, you know, that's a problem already with like keys getting leaked out there and
980500	983100	being sold by like G2A and stuff like that.
983540	984540	What's this going to happen?
984540	988180	You know, we get like key farmers coming in, buying shit like really cheap and then selling
988180	992680	stuff really cheap, you know, tanking the market on something.
992680	997060	Or you could even like, you know, play it like, I don't know if you'd be able to purchase
997060	1001900	multiple copies of stuff, but like, you know, you take the market with one thing and you
1001900	1004700	purchase all those copies up and then wait for the value to go back out.
1004700	1009040	And I don't know, it's just, I want to open this up to chat and your guys's thoughts.
1009040	1014320	Do you guys think that digital resale of games, which we're about 30 days away from likely
1014320	1019000	seeing in France, do you think this is a good thing for the industry or a bad thing from
1019000	1020000	the industry?
1020000	1022920	And, you know, let's respect all the voices out there because I know this is probably
1022920	1025560	a contentious topic because we're talking about money.
1025560	1028320	But I think in many ways, this is uncharted territory.
1028320	1030720	So we don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing yet.
1030720	1031720	I mean, yeah.
1031720	1035960	I mean, there's that part of me that instinctively goes, oh, yay, that's free money for me.
1035960	1037560	So I think, oh, it's a good thing.
1037560	1041560	But then I definitely kind of pull back and I think, ah, shit, like things like Humble
1041560	1047360	Bundle probably wouldn't exist if those games held some sort of value in them.
1047360	1052380	But of course, you know, I don't know, like how much value do certain games really have?
1052380	1056680	I know that sounds like a really shitty thing to say, but I think the reality is too, is
1056680	1061360	that, okay, like, look, like here, the local chain Dimple Records just finally went under,
1061360	1062360	right?
1062360	1065460	I think they had like their last sale last week and Dimple Records was this local place
1065460	1071340	here in Sacramento where our show is based, where you could buy like DVDs and CDs and
1071340	1072340	things like that.
1072340	1073340	Vinyl, yeah.
1073340	1078400	Well, if you went in this last week to go look at the Slim Pickens, you got to go see
1078400	1085380	like those 25 cent DVDs where it's like Jillian from The Biggest Loser's Workout Tape number
1085380	1089940	12 on, you know, like it's the, it's that, right?
1089940	1094140	You know, and I think the reality is there are some games out there and I know this sounds
1094140	1097900	terrible, but there are some games out there that are the Jillian Michaels Workout Tape
1097900	1104420	number 12 of the gaming industry because, and I think some of them have done it to themselves.
1104420	1108220	Like I would say one of those games, ooh, now I'm going to get real nasty already.
1108220	1109220	I'm going to name names.
1109220	1111260	I'm gonna say one of those games is Fez.
1111260	1114340	Why do I, why do I say Fez is one of those games?
1114340	1117520	Because it's, I have like eight copies of it from all the Humble Bundles.
1117520	1125260	Because every time there's some giveaway on some platform, Fez has been there, right?
1125260	1131740	So I kind of think in that regard, like, well, how much is a copy of Fez really worth?
1131740	1135960	And I know that is a shitty thing to say, because Fez, your opinions on indie game,
1135960	1141540	the movie aside, Fez is a good game, you know, it should be, but like, it's so saturated
1141540	1142540	at this point.
1142540	1145640	It's like, who fucking doesn't have Fez at this point?
1145640	1148980	Like you've made a conscious decision, you don't want to play that game if you haven't
1148980	1150120	played it at this point.
1150120	1152300	I haven't played it yet.
1152300	1156420	It's not that I don't want to, it's just, it's, it's in the backlog of all the other
1156420	1157420	games.
1157420	1158420	All right.
1158420	1159880	Let's get into some of the comments in chat.
1159880	1163620	So Bobby talking about the online pass thing, saying a system administrators don't work
1163620	1164620	for free.
1164620	1168260	The idea was that the $60 price paid for the game developers who made the game and the
1168260	1172240	online pass paid for the separate people who were the system administrators who maintain
1172240	1173240	the game.
1173240	1176760	It made perfect sense.
1176760	1178880	It just wasn't a popular model.
1178880	1182160	Well, one could, I already know what Bobby's comment to that is going to be because it
1182160	1184240	would depend on who is hosting those servers.
1184240	1187360	Whereas on PC, there isn't exactly a front end to that.
1187360	1189720	I'm going to just, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
1189720	1190720	Let's not do that.
1190720	1194240	What about all the billions of dollars they're making for microtransactions?
1194240	1198120	Can't that pay for servers, but they need the extra $5 on top of all of that.
1198120	1199120	To be fair.
1199120	1200120	That is the point I was going to make.
1200120	1201840	I was just going to say it a little differently.
1201840	1203560	It wasn't snarky enough.
1203560	1204840	All right.
1204840	1206400	Uh, let's see.
1206400	1211080	Bobby does also say AAA games should actually cost way more than $60 because of inflation
1211080	1213920	of both the worth and the size of development teams.
1213920	1216620	Well, honestly, I'm actually going to say, I agree.
1216620	1219700	And I've been saying that for a while here on this show is that instead of doing these
1219700	1224160	online pass, nickel diming, loot boxes, just fucking suck it up and charge 70 bucks for
1224160	1225160	the game already.
1225160	1227840	Just, you know, I know that's not going to be popular.
1227840	1228840	Yes.
1228840	1230320	People are going to bellyache about it, but you know what?
1230320	1231320	Just fucking charge it.
1231320	1232320	They already do.
1232320	1233880	They plan out the DLC.
1233880	1238220	That's why they have this whole, you know, season pass crap that you're buying.
1238220	1243400	They split it off purposefully so that they do charge you more money because splitting
1243400	1248760	it up saying, Oh, well you're paying $60 here and then you pay for an online pass.
1248760	1252520	People can say, Oh, well it feels like it's an option, you know, but a lot of that content
1252520	1257280	that was in there originally in a lot of these games, they're purposely taking out and putting
1257280	1261960	in like online pass stuff or not online pass in the season passes.
1261960	1266040	They're at, they're taking the content out of the original game and piece mailing it
1266040	1267040	to you.
1267040	1268040	All right.
1268040	1271560	Getting into some of the comments about what do you think about this change or, you know,
1271560	1275600	I keep saying it's a change, but I guess still it's a potential change because you still
1275600	1277320	don't know how the chess pieces are going to move.
1277320	1281460	We don't know if steam's going to react that, but, uh, your reactions in chat fifth dream
1281460	1286080	today says, I think I can't wrap my head around it because a copy of a digital code is just
1286080	1287080	that.
1287080	1289480	Which costs a fraction of a set to transmit.
1289480	1290480	I agree.
1290480	1294800	The original sale has value to pay for labor to create it, but after that, I don't know.
1294800	1298480	She hold 10 says physical should cost more than digital.
1298480	1302040	Other than that, anything goes as far as reselling what you own.
1302040	1303400	Is that interesting though?
1303400	1307960	Like things are coming full circle in a way and that we have this whole limited run games
1307960	1308960	thing, right?
1308960	1309960	Yeah.
1309960	1314400	Limited run games is taking a lot of these digital games and creating these light collectibles,
1314400	1319200	collector's editions, and like really enhanced, cool things that sell out within seconds.
1319200	1323340	And they do cost a little bit of money, but I think some people like, that's really cool.
1323340	1326380	That's all the GameStop is nowadays is collectible things.
1326380	1328060	That's what they have in their story.
1328060	1329520	It's it's collectibles.
1329520	1335480	I mean, they have their games, they sell the used games, but it's mostly collectibles is
1335480	1341600	like a third, if not half of the store Questbuster in chat with another comment here saying everything's
1341600	1343520	going to games as a service now.
1343520	1347360	And one of the reasons is to keep devs employed instead of losing heads at the end of every
1347360	1350580	project, but also to keep players engaged.
1350580	1352840	Not everyone does games as a service well though.
1352840	1356960	Oh, what a good point because look at what's happening with Anthem right now.
1356960	1357960	Yikes.
1357960	1362120	Versus what's happening with Blizzard and Overwatch still going strong years after the
1362120	1363480	release of the game, right?
1363480	1366360	Now they've got the Switch version coming out, which, you know, people are going crazy
1366360	1367360	about as well.
1367360	1371640	So it just kind of depends on, I think the company in a big way and the game that they're
1371640	1373500	doing for sure.
1373500	1376800	Also I want to point out, cause I thought this was really funny, Slag Kick actually
1376800	1382820	linked us to a copy of, from the year 2009, Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum, which
1382820	1387740	was a game on the Nintendo Wii, and saying Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum is the
1387740	1392380	Jillian Michaels volume 12 of video games.
1392380	1397140	If we did name episodes of OLR, I feel like the title of tonight's show would be in there
1397140	1398140	somewhere.
1398140	1400140	It would be Fitness Ultimatum.
1400140	1405140	Michael Pacas in chat says, I forgot Anthem existed.
1405140	1411220	The power that that has, the influence that that has, the international implications that
1411220	1412220	has.
1412220	1413660	No, it's like, it's what a true statement.
1413660	1416260	Like y'all remember Anthem?
1416260	1422900	Let's do a retro throw, but the classic game of the week this week is Anthem.
1422900	1425260	Remember when people were really excited about Anthem?
1425260	1428540	Yeah, that's gonna be fun because in 10 years time you're not gonna be able to play that
1428540	1429540	game.
1429940	1430940	At all.
1430940	1434380	It'll be just completely dead.
1434380	1437020	Bobby does want to say a little more on what's going on.
1437020	1439460	I am kind of cherry picking some comments here for time.
1439460	1443540	But Bobby does say realize with, if you want to see all the comments, you got to go to
1443540	1448540	our Twitch page over twitch.tv slash vog network, where we do tape live every Sunday night right
1448540	1452660	after the Bobby Black Wolf show at six o'clock, seven, nine o'clock Eastern and chats do save
1452660	1453660	for two weeks.
1453660	1457780	They don't say forever, sadly, but they do save for two weeks.
1457820	1461660	And you can, what does save forever is episodes of Orange Launch Radio.
1461660	1466740	If you are a subscriber at vog network, you can watch endless episodes of Orange Launch
1466740	1471340	Radio and the Bobby Black Wolf show and other vog network specials as they occur, hopefully
1471340	1473700	more to happen in the future, but you get access to all that.
1473700	1479100	And I plug all of that because it's September and this is actually the last night that you
1479100	1482740	can actually get a half off subscription.
1482740	1486180	So if you want, at least last Sunday night, I think the actual September promotion has
1486180	1490980	a couple more days in it, however much longer September is, but September is tonight.
1490980	1494140	So if you do want to subscribe, you want to do a half off, tonight's a great time to do
1494140	1495140	that.
1495140	1498580	Don't forget if you are Twitch, excuse me, an Amazon prime person, you get one free prime
1498580	1502580	subscription and you can use that and then you're basically getting it for free, although
1502580	1505000	you already paid through it for it through Amazon prime.
1505000	1507380	So anyway, sorry, I had to make sure I get the little pitch.
1507380	1508380	I would do it once.
1508380	1511540	I don't like to sit here and beg all night long, but I had to make sure I get it out
1511540	1512540	at some point.
1512540	1517860	I'd be a bad broadcaster if I didn't at least try to try to course you to subscribe at least
1517860	1520100	once throughout this three hour stream.
1520100	1521100	Okay.
1521100	1524940	Bobby does say, realize that with the digital code, there's also server space and bandwidth
1524940	1530180	costs to transmit the game to you a little more than a fraction of a cent.
1530180	1534440	And a lot of people do kind of write that off, but it is, for example, Steam has to
1534440	1540500	run those servers to redeem keys and things like that, it ain't free.
1540500	1546460	But yeah, we can also remember that most games that are $60 out there, the actual price
1546460	1551380	that like, say your GameStop or whatever is paying is closer to $50.
1551380	1557280	So there's that markup there, which they just pocket that when they are selling it digitally.
1557280	1561280	Bobby Blackwell says, but nowadays, the vast majority of DLC doesn't get started until
1561280	1562280	the game is out.
1562280	1567360	Do you consider the extra Smash Brothers fighter fighters to have been ripped out of the game?
1567360	1569020	I'm not saying every company does it.
1569420	1571260	And I think that's an important point.
1571260	1575580	This is company by company and which companies do we trust and which do we not?
1575580	1576580	Let's put it this way.
1576580	1577580	It's not necessarily...
1577580	1581900	Okay, I'm trying to think of a good example of stuff that's been ripped out of games.
1581900	1583460	A lot of it seems to be...
1583460	1586060	Street Fighter 5 characters were on the disc.
1586060	1588280	Well, yeah, there's that.
1588280	1591660	The Oblivion horse armor, for God's sake.
1591660	1595740	Go throw back to the classic DLC that was on the disc.
1595740	1597840	The horse armor was just kind of stupid.
1597840	1602300	It was just kind of a dumb example of like, hey, here's something we're selling for $5.
1602300	1604360	You're an idiot if you buy it type of thing.
1604360	1607880	Whereas then the rest of the DLC that they had for like the other Oblivion stuff was
1607880	1610880	actually all right.
1610880	1616000	But there is stuff though that is, especially when you're talking about games in a franchise
1616000	1620500	where it's sequel to sequel, where there's features that they had before and they're
1620500	1625000	taking them out and then selling them back to you later.
1625000	1627120	There's stuff that's just been kind of like...
1627120	1637640	Oh, for example, so in Madden NFL, okay, Madden NFL 19, I believe, they had like X number
1637640	1641320	of faces that you could choose from for your characters.
1641320	1646080	This year, they have those same faces, like literally the faces are exactly the same.
1646080	1648120	They didn't remodel anything, they didn't do anything.
1648120	1652280	This is for your player characters, but they actually have less of them and the additional
1652280	1657680	faces that are offered that were in the last game, they're selling to you as DLC.
1657680	1660380	You have to buy it to those faces.
1660380	1661380	They're already made.
1661380	1664600	It is the same fucking model, the same...
1664600	1665600	They didn't change anything.
1665600	1671480	It is exactly the same and they're selling you those pieces because EA is fucking shit.
1671480	1672480	That's why.
1672480	1675920	And actually it's funny because Bobby in chat says we're giving examples from many years
1675920	1676920	ago.
1676920	1677920	Do you have games that were released in the last two years?
1677920	1678920	So funny enough there.
1678920	1679920	Yes.
1679920	1680920	And he just...
1680920	1681920	Madden NFL.
1682560	1685680	Actually, I was going to say, I would have said Star Wars Battlefront 2.
1685680	1690120	I mean, it wasn't so much DLC, but it was that loot box shit, right?
1690120	1693480	Like we all know that was like loot boxes, the new DLC, right?
1693480	1699440	But regardless, what are these two games we just gave you have in common?
1699440	1700440	It's EA.
1700440	1701440	Yeah.
1701440	1702440	Wow.
1702440	1707080	And Anthem isn't doing too well because people all kind of knew that the game was...
1707080	1709560	What does Anthem have in common with these games that we mentioned?
1709560	1710560	EA.
1710700	1711700	Let's not forget though.
1711700	1717880	Let's not say it's just EA, 2K games also take two, Interactive also very bad about
1717880	1718880	this stuff.
1718880	1721040	And I say that as a fan of Grand Theft Auto.
1721040	1722040	That's Rockstar Games.
1722040	1729400	Rockstar Games is awesome, but holy shit is like the monetization really just like ridiculous.
1729400	1735160	I don't play Grand Theft Auto online anymore, but it's gotten ridiculous is the amount of
1735160	1736960	money because they smell the money.
1736960	1738400	They know it's there.
1738400	1744120	They're just going to try to monetize the show and same with like NBA 2K 20.
1744120	1749440	That's all you hear about now is all of the monetization of loot boxes and actual gambling
1749440	1750440	in the game.
1750440	1752920	Like that's all that people are talking about.
1752920	1755480	I am going to reign it back a bit because we've got to distance ourselves a little bit
1755480	1756920	from the original topic.
1756920	1760120	So let me kind of like to try to wrap this up, put a bow on it.
1760120	1762560	Like what, where do we go from here?
1762560	1765920	Do we think that, you know, there's an appeal that's going to happen?
1765920	1768480	What's your prediction for what happens in the next 30 days?
1768480	1773840	I think they're going to appeal and then we'll see another court case, another argument regarding
1773840	1774840	it.
1774840	1777260	And I think if they actually are forced to do it, then they'll probably just pay the
1777260	1782260	fine and see, I don't know if the court will force them to do it after that six months,
1782260	1787720	but I think the fine would be less than what they would have to pay with.
1787720	1790240	I don't know if they would do that to the developers.
1790240	1793860	And also with, with that, it's kind of weird.
1793860	1795540	Why would it only be valve?
1795540	1804780	It should be not only games, but movies, music, like anything that you're buying digital books,
1804780	1810720	anything digitally that you're purchasing that all should fall under the same thing.
1810720	1816140	So I would be, I would, whereas valve might not make a big stink about it.
1816140	1819940	The RIAA will make a big fucking stink about it.
1819940	1823020	And the movie industry will make a huge fucking stink about it.
1823020	1824020	Interesting.
1824020	1827980	Why would there be some type of alliance between steam and Hollywood based on what you're saying?
1827980	1833220	Because it's, it's just a slippery slope because it, why would it only pertain to games?
1833220	1834760	You know, it's the same model.
1834760	1838720	You're purchasing a digital license for this product.
1838720	1842640	So I would see that it's very much in a line.
1842640	1846860	And so if they're probably closely watching what's going to happen here, because if it,
1846860	1851660	if the court says, yeah, they have to be able to resell that stuff, then that would go the
1851660	1856260	same for music and all this other stuff, which they're not going to want.
1856260	1857260	All right.
1857260	1861340	And, and who influences YouTube the most?
1861340	1863540	It's the music industry and the movie industry.
1863540	1867620	So obviously they have some pole when it comes to that kind of stuff.
1867620	1868620	Okay.
1868620	1870900	Um, interesting because I would have said, I actually think it's a really interesting
1870900	1874220	point because I would have said, I bet steam just pulls out of France.
1874220	1876660	I bet steam cuts their losses and just pulls out of France.
1876660	1880820	But um, you know, sorry France, but I think you believe it or not.
1880820	1885040	I think you bring up a great point because it doesn't end with seem like they can decide
1885040	1887500	to do that, but there's going to be more.
1887500	1892700	If Hollywood isn't watching what's happening here, they damn well ought to be because it
1892700	1896800	could have, you know, especially because what Hollywood is making a shit ton of money off
1896800	1897800	digital now too.
1897800	1902060	I'm not just talking about things like Netflix and Hulu, but they release movies digital
1902060	1904180	before they're out on Blu-ray, right?
1904180	1909300	That's like a common trend now is to sell digital and why, why if I'm Hollywood, if
1909300	1913520	I'm Paramount pictures, if I'm Sony pictures, classics, if I'm, if I'm any of these movie
1913520	1919740	companies, why do I want to allow you to buy it digitally a week or two before it's out
1919740	1920740	on Blu-ray?
1920740	1922900	Why do I want you to do that?
1922900	1925100	So you don't rent it from red box.
1925100	1926940	And so I don't sell it back.
1926940	1928580	And so I don't take it.
1928580	1930260	I can't, I can't give it to a friend.
1930260	1931260	I can't do anything.
1931260	1935340	But like, honestly, like what is the used market for DVDs nowaday?
1935340	1940140	I mean, like, aside from, I guess, selling on like eBay or Amazon or something like that,
1940140	1945940	I mean, locally, like places that do like buy, sell, trade, I think those are very like,
1945940	1947860	they're almost all gone nowadays.
1947860	1951460	Like I don't think that there's a large market of aside from, I guess, you know what, there
1951460	1956660	is more of a market out there because there's, you know, the Facebook marketplace type stuff.
1956660	1961100	It is more accessible, like kind of the online marketplaces, but definitely like physical
1961100	1962100	marketplaces.
1962100	1966220	And, you know, we just had one of those businesses go out and because the buy, sell, trade model
1966220	1967620	isn't working out for them.
1967620	1969900	Well, physical media isn't working out for them either.
1969900	1972180	But yeah, I don't know.
1972180	1975580	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, usually it's France who retweet retreats.
1975580	1978540	Sorry, I screwed up your punchline.
1978540	1979540	Zing.
1979540	1980540	All right.
1980540	1982140	Anyway, let's move on.
1982140	1983140	Good discussion, though.
1983140	1986300	I'm very curious to see what the next 30, I think we'll be revisiting this topic very
1986300	1990340	soon in the next 30 days as that deadline gets closer.
1990340	1994020	But in the meantime, let's take a trip around what we've been playing this week.
1994020	1996900	I mentioned earlier in the show, it's been a very big week for video games.
1996900	1999220	I think a lot of big releases this week.
1999220	2001820	Let's talk about what we've gotten our hands on.
2001820	2004900	But speaking of things that you have your hands on folks in our chat room now, this
2004900	2005900	is an audio podcast.
2005900	2008100	Of course, it has been for forever.
2008100	2010740	So you guys can't see what the Twitch people are saying.
2010740	2013580	But the Twitch people are noticing like, what the hell is Loki eating?
2013580	2015180	Is he having like breadsticks for dinner?
2015180	2016180	Yes, I am.
2016180	2017300	Okay, so what is this?
2017300	2021580	It's Italian cheese bread from Little Caesars.
2021580	2023180	Okay, so there it is.
2023180	2024300	And it does.
2024300	2026300	It's it looks like a carbolicious meal.
2026300	2027300	It sure does.
2027300	2028300	It is.
2028300	2031940	You've mentioned this before that one reason you prefer to do breadsticks to pizza is that
2031940	2034700	it's like way cheaper to just not have sauce.
2034700	2035700	Yeah.
2035700	2036820	And also their pizza is not that great.
2036820	2041340	And I was short on time today and my and as I mentioned on Twitter, I don't know if anyone
2041340	2042340	actually follows.
2042340	2048860	The chicken place I was really loving this Korean chicken, you know, oven chicken place.
2048860	2051680	It went out of business.
2051680	2052980	That was a recorded episode.
2052980	2054580	That was the week I was out of town.
2054580	2056180	It was super good.
2056180	2059900	But like, and I got all my co-workers hooked on it.
2059900	2064460	And then they went out of business and they're like, no, this is horrible.
2064460	2065980	Why did you do that?
2065980	2070780	You know, they don't pay their rent, I guess, you know, they get evicted.
2070780	2071780	Yeah.
2071780	2073020	Pod culture says smooshes favorite chicken.
2073020	2074020	Yeah.
2074020	2076540	I will say this, even though Smoosh was going a little crazy earlier, I thought I saw him
2076540	2077540	lying down over here earlier.
2077540	2078540	He left.
2078540	2079540	He must have left.
2079540	2083140	He when Loki brings something like this, the cat doesn't give a shit about cheesy bread.
2083140	2084140	Yeah.
2084140	2085140	It's the chicken that he wants.
2085140	2086140	He doesn't care about.
2086140	2088380	And I wanted to get chicken, but like, sorry, this isn't crazy.
2088380	2090260	You very distinctly said this is not not crazy, right?
2090260	2092100	Because this stuff's way better than crazy bread.
2092100	2096660	It's more like a kind of a thick crust pizza without sauce and with cheese on it.
2096660	2097660	All right.
2097660	2098660	Let's get into video games.
2098660	2099660	Can't talk about food all night.
2099660	2100660	How was your gaming week?
2101540	2104540	Um, I did not play any of the new games that came out this week and said I played Borderlands
2104540	2105540	three.
2105540	2106540	So I've been playing more of that.
2106540	2111660	I'm on the second planet, probably leaving the second or leave, yeah, leaving the second
2111660	2112660	planet.
2112660	2117420	Um, I've been doing a lot of the side missions, so I don't have to go back.
2117420	2118420	It's pretty fun.
2118420	2120420	I like the game a lot.
2120420	2124820	Um, yeah, I mean, there's not much really I can say about it.
2124820	2128460	I've been wanting to do the Twitch streaming thing, but I haven't figured out how to download
2128460	2134380	the plug in or whatever that you need to do that, because that would be pretty cool to,
2134380	2139140	I guess, people that watch you can actually get loot and stuff in their games and they
2139140	2143580	can give you loot or something somehow.
2143580	2146100	So I do want to try that out at some point.
2146100	2150420	But I've been doing that and then I've been working a little bit on my game, not so much
2150420	2154940	this weekend, because like yesterday I was really tired.
2154940	2158940	I did work on it yesterday, but this morning I wanted to work on it and I was up early
2158940	2162400	because I couldn't sleep, but I couldn't sleep because I had a migraine.
2162400	2165560	And so I couldn't really work on it because my brain hurt.
2165560	2168820	And so, um, I'm getting there.
2168820	2174280	I'm just trying to, I had the, I shifted everything to a different, so Unity has like their standard
2174280	2177180	lighting engine and then they also have these new ones now.
2177180	2182840	It's um, the lightweight render engine or render pipeline is what they call it.
2182840	2187980	And so I switched all my assets over to that because you can do a thing called a shader
2187980	2193700	graph that allows you to build shaders visually using like a graph and it's pretty cool.
2193700	2195800	You can do all sorts of cool effects with it.
2195800	2200420	So I switched everything over that and that took a long time to get everything to be where
2200420	2206600	I wanted it to be and to actually show up like I wanted to and get the lighting correct.
2206600	2209840	And then after I got done with that, I'm like, man, I'm wasting a lot of time on stuff that
2209840	2212860	really should be part of polish and not actually part of the game.
2212860	2217180	But I was doing that because I was trying to get respawning of stuff in and what I was
2217180	2218420	doing was taking too long.
2218420	2221620	And so I was like, well, just have stuff, just teleport in and like, I don't have a
2221620	2222780	teleport effect.
2222780	2224060	Let me build one of those.
2224060	2229900	And so I did, but it was just kind of, it was a side mission on the, on the game development
2229900	2230900	thing.
2230900	2234860	So, um, but yeah, we're back, back on track of that and I'll be working through more of
2234860	2237720	that game and play more Borderlands 3.
2237720	2243540	I do want to play the untitled goose game and go through legends all as well, but not
2243540	2244540	yet.
2244540	2245540	Oh, and then Pokemon go.
2245540	2246540	I've been playing a little bit of that.
2246540	2248700	We'll talk a little more about that since it's coming up.
2248700	2250620	They put a new poke stop at my park.
2250620	2255740	I can't, I can't get my son's programming place to be a focus up, but they'll make the
2255740	2260740	slide at my park, a pokey site structures are acceptable portals.
2260740	2263220	So yeah, it makes sense.
2263220	2267020	Whatever it works out for me because the next time we go to the park, I don't have to like
2267020	2270040	walk over to where the, the pokey stop is or whatever.
2270040	2274840	I can just sit and watch them play and just, aren't you level 10 and ingress, can you submit
2274840	2275840	your own stuff?
2275840	2276840	I do.
2276840	2277840	Yeah, you should.
2277840	2278840	I did.
2278840	2279840	Cause you tried to get you.
2279840	2280840	Okay.
2280840	2281840	Yeah.
2281840	2282840	And I submitted several times.
2282840	2283840	I haven't gotten a rejection, but I haven't gotten an acceptance either.
2283840	2284840	And that was back in may.
2284840	2285840	Hmm.
2285840	2286840	Interesting.
2286840	2289120	I use using Ingers prime to submit is so much easier because you get to take the two photos
2289120	2291400	and write a justification on why it should be accepted.
2291400	2292400	Yeah.
2292400	2296680	I think when I was doing it and probably wasn't letting me, I think I did it in, um, redacted,
2296680	2298700	which I obviously won't be able to do very soon.
2298700	2299700	So yeah.
2299700	2300700	Yeah.
2300700	2301700	Interesting.
2301700	2302700	All right.
2302700	2303700	Oh, I did.
2303700	2304700	I did play ingress a little bit today too.
2304700	2308260	Oh, cause we went to a new park that I, we know we've hit all the parks in the area,
2308260	2310000	but apparently there was one that I missed.
2310000	2316040	And so I went there and you know, I was like, well, I'm done with poke stop rate or I've
2316040	2319320	hit all this, the Pokemon, the area, I'll leave a little bit over the ingress real quick.
2319320	2321860	And then I captured the two portals there and get some uniques.
2321860	2322860	Yeah.
2322860	2323860	Yeah.
2323860	2324860	That works.
2324860	2325860	All right.
2326040	2330560	Um, my gaming week, uh, Oh, real quickly, I want to mention before we get into my gaming
2330560	2334880	week, cause I was talking about the subscription and all that stuff and how, uh, it's September
2334880	2335880	and all that.
2335880	2340840	I forgot to mention, uh, Bobby Blackwell found this cool little plugin for our discord server,
2340840	2344840	where if you have your Twitch and your discord accounts, like connected, like you tell discord,
2344840	2346480	like this is your Twitch and whatever.
2346480	2351720	If you're actually a subscriber of our channel, you get access to a brand new chat room.
2351720	2353120	That's only for subscribers.
2353120	2355000	Um, I don't know.
2355140	2358940	I mean, obviously we kind of want to limit the use of that because you know, we want
2358940	2363140	everybody to have, you know, we don't want people to be limited by it like a money thing,
2363140	2366300	but I've been like, okay, what are some, what are some things I can put in the subscriber
2366300	2369780	chat to make people feel like, Ooh, I'm getting extra value.
2369780	2372460	So I've been posting a cat picture.
2372460	2375140	I posted some behind the scenes pictures today too.
2375140	2376300	I did that during Bobby's show.
2376300	2379460	I was like, Oh, maybe people would want to see like a little extra, like, what does it
2379460	2382320	look like here in the studio from some other angles and things like that.
2382320	2383700	So maybe, maybe I'll try to keep doing that.
2383700	2384700	I don't know.
2385400	2387600	I'll do what you want and I'll do my best to, uh, try to add that.
2387600	2390800	But if you are a subscriber, make sure you got your Twitch and your discord kind of linked
2390800	2392760	and then take out, take, cause it's all automated.
2392760	2396440	We're not like manually adding people, uh, take a look at our discord server over at
2396440	2401500	vog at network.com slash discord, and you can see that bonus little chat room that's
2401500	2402500	right there.
2402500	2403500	All right.
2403500	2404500	Let's talk about my gaming week.
2404500	2407560	So I have played, um, it's been a really good week for games.
2407560	2411800	And of course, one of the big releases that came out this week was the remake of the legend
2411800	2413480	of Zelda links awakening, right?
2413480	2417840	So, um, this is actually video that we're showing on the Twitch feed.
2417840	2420880	This is me playing, you can tell cause it's a Mr. Smoosh.
2420880	2424660	So I did a little bit of a stream earlier in the week and, uh, I continue doing some
2424660	2428380	playthrough and I did a little recording of like the first little bit of that.
2428380	2431300	Um, and you can see just how cute this game is.
2431300	2435860	I love the graphic style, um, that they went with, with the game.
2435860	2440380	Uh, it kind of reminds me of, let's say a link to the past, which is ironic because
2440380	2445520	I believe the game boy version started as a portable version of a link to the past that
2445520	2448360	they kind of kind of turned into its own thing.
2448360	2451960	Um, but you just saw on the Twitch feed, I access the map.
2451960	2455960	I love how detailed this map is that they've added in the game because you can actually
2455960	2458960	use map markers to help you find stuff.
2458960	2461440	And um, I love the sense of humor this game has.
2461440	2465240	Of course that was there a little bit in the original game as well, but man, it's just
2465240	2468040	such, I mean, remember this game was on the fricking brick game boy.
2468040	2469560	It was in black and white.
2469560	2473260	The resolution on those things was what, like 144 pixels wide.
2473260	2476400	Like it wasn't a lot that you could really fit on those things, but then they have like
2476400	2480660	gameplay color version practically like a new, yes, it was one of those games that would
2480660	2483500	play on the black and white and it would play on the color.
2483500	2488660	Um, so, uh, yeah, uh, it, it would have some enhanced color, but come on, it looks nothing
2488660	2489660	like this, right?
2489660	2494080	Still, you're really limited by that, um, resolution, but, um, some of the re-imagining
2494080	2497760	is some of the songs is done really well.
2497760	2501180	Even the little doo, doo, doo, doo tone sounds like really cool.
2501180	2505220	Um, Oh, which I think I just kind of hit in the video there.
2505220	2506220	How ironic.
2506220	2512880	Um, but yeah, so, um, it just looks so good and it's, it's like kind of like that classic
2512880	2513880	Zelda.
2513880	2517060	I mean, obviously Zelda's kind of gone like two different directions, right?
2517060	2521620	Like this is the more Nintendo super Nintendo style, which we, which we got to revisit a
2521620	2525220	little bit when they did a link between two worlds on the 3DS, right?
2525220	2530480	So it's like we haven't had like a 2D or a 2.5 D Zelda in a long time.
2530480	2535600	So this fills a void that I think a lot of us like people that really like their old
2535600	2536600	school games.
2536600	2541100	I think this game really fills a void that many of us have been like craving, even if
2541100	2542960	it is a re-imagining of an older game.
2542960	2543960	You know what?
2543960	2546000	I barely fricking remember that old game.
2546000	2547000	I never played the old game.
2547000	2550160	Oh, well then it's practically like playing a new game for you.
2550160	2555580	But I think even for me, like I kind of remembered the beginning-ish of the game a little bit,
2555580	2560320	but then from there, I don't, I didn't even remember that you were trying to collect instruments.
2560320	2563860	Like I didn't even remember that that was a thing in the game at all.
2563860	2567500	So, um, it's almost like playing a brand new Zelda game to me, honestly.
2567500	2569400	So I'm a big fan.
2569400	2573180	I have not, however, sadly gotten to the dungeon maker mode yet.
2573180	2575980	Um, that's something I think that I get a little later.
2575980	2579180	Um, I, it does not seem to be in the game by default.
2579200	2584100	Somebody was saying that it replaces like an older mode in the, um, old, uh, Link's Awakening
2584100	2585340	game on the Game Boy.
2585340	2589220	So it's something that I'll come across probably a little later in the game.
2589220	2593900	So, uh, Slidekick in chat says it looks like a toy village and I want toys out of it.
2593900	2594900	Yeah.
2594900	2597900	I mean, it's just, well, you can get an amiibo, which I have resisted.
2597900	2600260	I haven't really bought a lot of amiibo in a long time.
2600260	2604100	It doesn't seem like it did, did very much other than like, it said it put a dark version
2604100	2606820	of Link in your dungeon when you do the dungeon maker.
2606820	2607820	Interesting.
2607820	2608820	Yeah.
2608960	2614180	The amiibo in these games shouldn't do a lot, you know, it shouldn't, it shouldn't like
2614180	2616340	radically affect the game, right?
2616340	2619460	So a little something, something is, is okay.
2619460	2622340	So anyway, I am enjoying Link's Awakening.
2622340	2625260	I just, I, I love the 2D Zelda.
2625260	2626260	Don't get me wrong.
2626260	2631600	Like Breath of the Wild really kind of really won me over on 3D Zelda games the way I'm
2631600	2634260	not sure any other Zelda game has in a long time.
2634260	2637460	I don't know when I first played Twilight Princess on the Wii, like I fricking loved
2637460	2638460	that game too.
2638700	2642620	You know, the 3D Zeldas have always been kind of just like a different direction to me.
2642620	2645620	It's really great to revisit the old school Zelda games as well.
2645620	2649180	So I am a big fan of that.
2649180	2654060	I've also been playing a little bit of classic World of Warcraft, still leveling my priest.
2654060	2655340	I see slykicks in chat.
2655340	2657340	We've been actually teaming up on some things a little bit.
2657340	2662400	I hit level 17 on my priest today, which for classic wow, that's like hitting end game
2662400	2663400	and current wow.
2663400	2666580	So I would say I'm doing pretty well so far.
2666580	2669860	I'm at a high enough level where I could go to the dead mines pretty soon.
2669860	2672660	I've still been playing Final Fantasy 14 as well.
2672660	2673660	I don't know if Shane's in chat.
2673660	2677700	I thought I saw him earlier, but we've still been teaming up a little bit.
2677700	2682940	My gun blade, I always mess up the name of the, I was, I almost said gunslinger because
2682940	2687260	I can never remember the right name of the class, but my gun blade I've, who have actually
2687260	2691500	really been enjoying playing as a tank class.
2691500	2696500	I love playing that class, um, is now level 72.
2696500	2698500	I think I'm going to hit 72 yesterday.
2698500	2699500	So that's, that's it.
2699500	2700500	Oh, good.
2700500	2702500	I still can't get the name right.
2702500	2704500	It's gunbreaker.
2704500	2707900	Shane, you know what ruined me?
2707900	2711700	It's that one night when we were sitting there and we were calling it all these random wrong
2711700	2712700	names.
2712700	2714700	Now I can't remember the right names anymore.
2714700	2716940	Uh, I'm dying.
2716940	2720520	See my gunbreaker, whatever it's called is like level 72, which getting pretty close
2720560	2722360	to max level, max levels 80.
2722360	2724760	So I'm, I'm doing good.
2724760	2725760	Just so you know.
2725760	2726760	All right.
2726760	2730040	That cat, what can you do?
2730040	2731040	All right.
2731040	2735040	Is his other dad should be home maybe in about 30 minutes and hopefully we'll shut him up.
2735040	2736040	All right.
2736040	2739800	Anyhow, I got to talk about one other game that I played this week because I love this
2739800	2740800	game.
2740800	2742920	So, you know, a lot of people are saying that this is like a new music game that you really
2742920	2744480	have to check out, right?
2744480	2748720	I don't know if I would say that this is a music game, but it's a game you really should
2748720	2749720	check out.
2749920	2755360	Sayonara Wild Hearts and uh, Willie has some gameplay on Twitch, uh, that again, I recorded
2755360	2757600	this myself, so there's flaws and everything.
2757600	2762240	You're going to see me hit a wall at some point and it just kind of, it just drops you
2762240	2764740	back a little bit and you have to kind of keep going.
2764740	2769320	So folks are calling this a music game and I felt like it was something I kind of had
2769320	2772840	to check out because I am a fan of music games and things like that.
2772840	2777200	Um, I actually, I'm not sure this is a music game.
2777200	2781440	Are there parts of the game where you have to like hit a button in a certain rhythm?
2781440	2783840	Yes, that does exist.
2783840	2785840	Is the soundtrack incredible?
2785840	2786840	Fuck yes it is.
2786840	2787840	This is an incredible soundtrack.
2787840	2791660	I know it's really hard for you to hear in the studio because we have to lower the audio
2791660	2795440	or they can't hear over our voices and we have to echo, um, but hopefully over the stream
2795440	2798640	and on the podcast you can hear a little bit of music in the background.
2798640	2800640	It is a great soundtrack.
2800640	2804640	I mean, it's just like, I actually looked up the soundtrack on Spotify and I've been
2804640	2805640	listening to it in my car.
2805640	2806640	It's so good.
2807080	2809560	Um, so what is the game if it's not really a music game?
2809560	2810960	You know what it is to me?
2810960	2811960	Okay.
2811960	2813680	It kind of, see, here's the rhythm part.
2813680	2817400	That's where like, I'm actually like hitting the button with it, but this game is so fucking
2817400	2818400	stylish.
2818400	2819400	I mean, look at it.
2819400	2824920	Like they're freaking jumping and doing twirls and going down this road and now she's flying
2824920	2829500	through the air and it's like this pilot wings type of sequence or something and it just,
2829500	2830500	it looks beautiful.
2830500	2835040	This is one of those games where it's like, you're going to sit there and tell me video
2835040	2836040	games aren't art.
2836040	2840800	Fucking play Sayonara Wild Hearts because this is like art in motion.
2840800	2841800	It's beautiful.
2841800	2844960	Um, but I would say this game, you know what it reminds me of?
2844960	2845960	Okay.
2845960	2848600	Do you guys remember the bonus stage in Sonic the Hedgehog 2?
2848600	2849600	No.
2849600	2850600	No.
2850600	2853400	You remember you had that big tail pipe and you would run up and down and collect the
2853400	2857560	rings and like you would try to avoid the little spikes and things.
2857560	2858560	Okay.
2858560	2861480	That, but make it 2019.
2861480	2867200	I kind of feel like that's the best way I can describe Sayonara Wild Hearts.
2867200	2874880	Imagine Sonic the Hedgehog 2's bonus stage, but like 2019 and a beautiful as hell.
2874880	2878820	Oh, this is another stage that, cause I wanted to make sure I included more than one song.
2878820	2881860	So there's another stage that's a little more of a first person view.
2881860	2886440	So it almost feels like you're playing like a racing game at some points until you know,
2886440	2888160	again, it gets very stylish.
2888160	2889580	Now it's a shooter.
2889580	2892660	You're like auto shooting these obstacles that are ahead of you.
2892660	2896940	And at some point if I talk long, long enough, you get to see like the big three headed dog
2896940	2898940	that comes out and all this stuff.
2898940	2903980	Um, S200 Matt in chat says Annapurna Interactive does such amazing games like this.
2903980	2904980	Yeah.
2904980	2905980	They're a great publishing company.
2905980	2910860	Uh, the developer was another company out of Sweden whose name I forget in the moment,
2910860	2915660	but they are very big on like iPhone games has been their bread and butter.
2915660	2920660	Um, and so this is their first game that was kind of beyond just the iPhone.
2920660	2922140	Now this game is available on iPhone.
2922140	2926340	It's actually a Apple arcade because that was the whole big thing last week.
2926340	2927340	Right?
2927340	2928340	Yeah.
2928340	2931340	So some people are experienced because all it is, it's just, uh, even if you are playing
2931340	2935340	on the Nintendo switch where I captured this game, it's just using the controller and then
2935340	2936340	using the button.
2936340	2937340	That's it.
2937340	2938340	It's controller slash one button.
2938340	2942340	So I imagine on a mobile, it's just probably like dragging around the screen, probably
2942340	2943340	very simple.
2943340	2951020	Uh, it is also available on PlayStation four, not available on Android and also not available
2951020	2952020	on PC.
2952020	2956620	So you would have to do PS4, no Xbox, no Xbox right now.
2956620	2960460	No, it's, it's an interesting kind of lineup, but I think I'm a fat out of B roll there.
2960460	2965180	It's an interesting lineup though of, uh, you know, the, uh, the iPhone and then two
2965180	2969100	more traditional consoles with the switch and the PlayStation four, but I highly recommend
2969100	2970100	it.
2970100	2972500	I think if you are a fan of music games, you're going to like this enough.
2972500	2975500	I just, you know, when I first heard it was a music game, I was like, Oh, it's going to
2975500	2980100	be like elite beat agents, or it's going to be like, you know, guitar, Roman or something.
2980100	2984260	I don't know if I really see that, but I just think the soundtrack is so good and kind of
2984260	2985460	adjacent to the music.
2985460	2986460	I really enjoyed it.
2986460	2989940	A lot of those games, I think most music game fans are going to get a kick enough out of
2989940	2990940	this.
2990940	2993100	I, I, I think this will be one of my top games of the year.
2993100	2994100	I really do.
2994100	2996860	Uh, the one complaint it's really short, it's a short game.
2996860	3000780	So there's a lot of people that are probably going to be like, Oh, I beat it in two hours.
3000780	3001780	That's it.
3001780	3005460	Um, you know, like most music games, there's only what, like 20 songs in it or something
3005460	3006460	like that.
3006460	3009460	So once you kind of get there, it does tell a story it's, uh, you know, kind of from start
3009460	3012220	to finish, I'll, I'll let you all kind of experience that on your own if you want to
3012220	3013220	play it.
3013220	3014440	Um, but it is a short game.
3014440	3018300	I would say though, it's one of those games where there's a lot of room for improvement.
3018300	3024100	Um, and, uh, if you, uh, you might, I have yet to get a gold rank on a stage.
3024100	3025100	Let me put it that way.
3025100	3028260	I've gotten some bronze ranks, some silver ranks, but it's really hard.
3028260	3031500	You really have to memorize the patterns and what's coming up in order to get a gold
3031500	3032500	rank.
3032500	3034500	So there is some replay value in that regard.
3034500	3036540	And here's some other interesting news.
3036540	3039980	The game kind of has a Bobby Black Wolf mode sort of built in.
3039980	3044780	So what'll happen, um, if you keep slamming into the same tree over and over, let's say
3044780	3050220	once you screw up like three or four times, what'll happen is one of the like spirits,
3050220	3053900	it's kind of part of the game's mythology will show up and say, it seems that you're
3053900	3055780	having difficulty passing this part.
3055780	3057540	Would you like to skip this part?
3057540	3059660	And you can just skip right past it and go to the next part.
3059660	3065360	Um, or you can say no, or you can say no and never offer this again.
3065360	3069060	So depending on the type of gamer you are, you know, if you're Bobby Black Wolf, you
3069060	3071020	might say, yeah, I'm going to skip this one part.
3071020	3072020	It's kind of hard.
3072020	3075020	But if you're like, you know, that hardcore gamer, you can say no and never bother me
3075020	3076060	ever again.
3076060	3077340	So there is that.
3077340	3081940	So, uh, uh, Shad is in chat saying, have you tackled the hidden riddles yet?
3081940	3082940	No, I have not.
3082940	3086640	I've, I've, I feel like I've barely scratched the surface on what this game has to offer.
3086640	3090720	So, um, I've got plenty more to explore, but, uh, it's just, what can I say?
3090720	3093040	It's been a crazy week for games, lots of stuff.
3093040	3095660	There's other games that came out that I haven't gotten around to yet.
3095660	3100080	I know a lot of people are really excited about the, um, I keep wanting to say asshole
3100080	3104480	goose game, but I guess they really did officially change the title, untitled goose game.
3104480	3108460	I guess it's probably easier to convince more families to play it, uh, when it's untitled
3108460	3111320	goose game, but y'all know wink, wink, nudge, nudge.
3111320	3112320	That's why it's untitled.
3112320	3113320	Right?
3113320	3115520	Cause it wasn't the development name, asshole goose game.
3115520	3116520	I don't know.
3116520	3117520	All right.
3117520	3118520	Anyway, I swear.
3118520	3120280	I think that's what they just, people are calling it.
3120280	3121280	Yeah.
3121280	3125120	So, uh, I still need to get on that, but it's been, and, and Shane is in chat saying, yeah,
3125120	3127120	you haven't played the best game of the year that came out this week.
3127120	3128400	I know he's a big fan of it.
3128400	3131600	Uh, hopefully we'll hear from the, uh, hear from him later in the show to tell us more
3131600	3132600	about the game.
3132600	3136120	Um, but, uh, yeah, it's just, there's, this has been a really good week for games.
3136120	3138480	The fall season is here, right?
3138480	3144360	Like the first leaf falls from the tree, pumpkin spice lattes are in full swing and here come
3144360	3147360	the fall video game releases like big time.
3147360	3151160	This week was huge and it's just, what are some other big, I mean, borderlands as well
3151160	3152560	was just within the past two weeks.
3152560	3153560	Yeah.
3153560	3154560	I mean that was a huge kickoff too.
3154560	3155920	What do we have coming up in the next couple weeks?
3155920	3156920	Control was another one.
3156920	3157920	Oh yeah.
3157920	3158920	Control.
3158920	3159920	Oh my God.
3159920	3160920	I want to play that one too.
3160920	3162720	And in the next couple of weeks, what, we have a big one coming out this week too.
3162720	3163720	Right.
3163720	3166280	Um, I feel like there was something this weekend that's a big deal.
3166280	3167280	That's coming out too.
3167280	3168760	There's a lot of stuff going on.
3168760	3173400	So there's probably, I mean, there's always big stuff coming out in the fourth quarter.
3173400	3174400	Yeah.
3174400	3179200	Don't say leading up to the, uh, it was a big release this weekend.
3179200	3185400	Maybe I'm, yeah, there's, um, a few things coming out.
3185400	3192320	Um, you know, anything really huge that jumps out at me, there was something, I don't know.
3192320	3193320	It's fine.
3193320	3194320	You know, CUNY was last week.
3194320	3197040	So you know, well, yeah, there's another one I got to pick up, although that one's just
3197040	3200920	kind of like a redo on the switch, so I feel a little okay skipping that one cause I did
3200920	3201920	play that.
3201920	3206000	Um, also I guess I could say this one other little FIFA, that's another one.
3206000	3212040	One other little thing that I picked up was I found, um, at Walmart, another for my little
3212040	3216800	mini arcade machine collection, they have mortal combat now in the collection.
3216800	3218520	That's actually, um, on Twitch.
3218520	3221400	For those that are looking towards the right side of the screen, there's a Pac-Man that's
3221400	3224960	brand new as well in color, but you know, Pac-Man y'all seen Pac-Man, but now there's
3224960	3226000	a mortal combat.
3226000	3229200	And what's funny about the mortal combat, um, I'm actually going to show this on screen
3229200	3230200	here.
3230200	3231200	I'll walk up.
3231680	3236440	But there's actually six buttons on the mortal combat machine and look, he was like, what's
3236440	3237440	that for?
3237440	3238600	It has two block buttons for whatever reason.
3238600	3240040	I don't know why they set it up.
3240040	3243240	Like you said that it was emulated off of the Genesis version.
3243240	3246460	So when you look at it, it really looks like the Genesis version.
3246460	3247460	So here's the funny thing.
3247460	3251480	I bought two because the other was for dark Sakura.
3251480	3255680	So I want to show you, uh, what it looks like real quick on the Twitch stream, but you're
3255680	3258040	going to have to talk through this here while I do this.
3258040	3259040	Yeah.
3259080	3260080	Um, yeah.
3260080	3262960	Cause I noticed something like, well, doesn't that normally have five buttons?
3262960	3265760	That's kind of weird, but yeah, there it is.
3265760	3270840	And it's, it's glory.
3270840	3276800	It's very, uh, lifelike and you can tell it kind of looks like the Genesis version to
3276800	3277800	me.
3277800	3283200	I mean, but I mean, I mean, it's still like, you know, can you imagine back when you're
3283200	3288160	playing moral combat when it first came out that, Hey, you know, someday they're going
3288160	3289980	to have a tabletop version of that.
3289980	3293840	That's really, you know, I know a few bucks.
3293840	3297000	I'm trying to think of how to like tell people how big that is.
3297000	3301280	It's about like, it's not that much bigger than like maybe my stream tech.
3301280	3302280	I don't know.
3302280	3305320	I don't know how to like relate the size of that thing, but it's really not that big.
3305320	3309960	So, uh, dark Tetsuya does point out moral combat is the Genesis one, but there's no
3309960	3310960	blood code.
3310960	3311960	See, I knew it.
3311960	3315400	I knew there was going to be something with those that they wouldn't, that I was like,
3315400	3317800	they sell these in the kid's aisle.
3317800	3320840	They've got to do something because I was even talking to the checkout lady about it.
3320840	3323120	Uh, she was saying something like, Oh, mortal combat.
3323120	3326880	They have this in one of these little machines and I was like, yeah, uh, I'm like, it's,
3326880	3327880	it's back there.
3327880	3331280	I said, I bet though I wouldn't buy it for kids, but they have Pac-Man as well.
3331280	3334920	I don't remember the topic kind of came up, but, um, yeah, I kind of figured if it was
3334920	3337280	the Genesis version, it may not, a lot of people forget.
3337280	3338280	Yes.
3338280	3341480	The Genesis version had blood, but you had to put in a code.
3341480	3342480	What was it?
3342480	3344480	A B B A C A Abiaka or something.
3344480	3345480	I don't remember.
3345480	3346480	Do you guys remember the code?
3346560	3351160	Who remembers the blood code, but I don't think you can just put it in, in that machine.
3351160	3354960	Sadly, um, uh, sort of adjacent to this one, Abba cab.
3354960	3359080	Oh, I was really close Abba cab, uh, ABB, AC ABB.
3359080	3363280	Um, tiger class says, speaking of mortal combat, I posted a video that had the actors who played
3363280	3366440	Lou Kang and Johnny cage playing on the mortal combat arcade.
3366440	3369200	One up cabinet, the actors from the original mortal combat movie.
3369200	3370520	That is not the new one.
3370520	3374920	Um, Oh, from the movie, like, see, when I originally saw actors from moral combat, I
3374920	3379360	thought it was the people that they performance captured for the moral combat was the original.
3379360	3380360	That's weird.
3380360	3381360	It was the original mortal combat movie.
3381360	3382360	Oh yeah.
3382360	3383360	Tiger club.
3383360	3387800	Put that in our discord over, uh, vog network.com VOG network.com slash discord, um, actually
3387800	3388800	put that video.
3388800	3393280	I imagine the whole thing was probably a sales pitch for the arcade one up because, uh, actually
3393280	3396420	not only do you see the baby machine, but then when I went over to the software area,
3396420	3400840	they had those big arcade one up cabinets for like 299 bucks or however they went.
3400840	3403680	And I saw the mortal combat one sitting there, Lord.
3403680	3405160	I was tempted.
3405160	3412320	I was tempted, but since I'm like new at my job still, and I'm in that awkward, I got
3412320	3415320	paid from the last job, but I haven't gotten paid at the new job yet.
3415320	3419040	You know, y'all know, if you ever change, y'all know that you end up in that weird kind
3419040	3423720	of like times where you don't have a paycheck for a little bit.
3423720	3426600	Um, so that's in that weird gap that I'm at right now.
3426600	3431120	So, um, I have to wait until I spoil myself with things like that.
3431280	3435680	Uh, Tochen says, go get the mortal combat to arcade one up bundle from Costco.
3435680	3436680	It's upgrading.
3436680	3437680	You get more for your dollar.
3437680	3438760	You know, it's like $300.
3438760	3439760	That one was 20 bucks.
3439760	3442000	Not even that was like 1980, something like that.
3442000	3444880	So I do want those arcade one up machines though.
3444880	3445880	Don't get me wrong.
3445880	3448120	But then I'm also like, where the fuck am I going to fit that in this house?
3448120	3451420	I have, I need less crap in this house, not more crap.
3451420	3452420	That's the other big problem.
3452420	3453420	All right.
3453420	3455200	Anyway, that's enough for our gaming weeks.
3455200	3458200	I think we should get into some of the news stories from this week.
3458280	3462560	We're going to start off with, we were just talking about this during our gaming weeks.
3462560	3464280	So let's get into, uh, Pokemon.
3464280	3465280	Yeah.
3465280	3470200	So Pokemon go has expanded into the Unova region, which I thought it was just a few
3470200	3471200	of them that came out.
3471200	3474840	I didn't realize that it was the whole thing, but, um, apparently, yeah, they've got quite
3474840	3476760	a few new Pokemon.
3476760	3485360	So um, right now it's, it looks like about like maybe like eight to 10 new Pokemon that
3485360	3486360	are popping up.
3486400	3490200	I've gotten a few of the angry chipmunk one and also the pigeon.
3490200	3491640	I love the pigeon one.
3491640	3493480	It's my new favorite.
3493480	3497400	Um, and Shane's bringing up a very important point in our chat room is that it's not all
3497400	3498400	a gen five.
3498400	3500080	It's like the first part.
3500080	3501800	They're doing this like they did gen four.
3501800	3505840	They're giving you the starters and some of the trashy Mon, you know, a little taste.
3505840	3510520	Um, but it's not the whole thing, but Shane, I'm surprised your reaction wasn't more like,
3510520	3513680	we got Oshawa and that's all that we need.
3513680	3515520	You want to hear what I did this week?
3515520	3519320	You want to hear, I'm going to expose Shane as the cheater he is, but I enabled it a little
3519320	3520320	bit.
3520320	3524240	So Shane's favorite Pokemon is Oshawa, which is one of the starters in gen five, right?
3524240	3528600	The, the cute little like otter thing with the shell on its chest, which I never realized
3528600	3531200	he actually like rips off the chest and like attacks with.
3531200	3532600	It's like super cute.
3532600	3538120	Um, so, uh, that's his favorite, but that one's, it's really hard to find.
3538120	3539920	They don't have those everywhere.
3539920	3545360	So I think Shane was able to catch like one, uh, in his adventures well in looking at the
3545400	3549520	local discord down in Elk Grove here locally at the sports park there.
3549520	3550520	Guess what?
3550520	3552180	It's an Oshawa nest.
3552180	3556920	So Shane logged out of his account, stayed out of his account for five hours and then
3556920	3564680	had me log into his account at this nest and just catch Oshawa at the park so that then
3564680	3568300	we stayed out of it for another five hours or whatever the travel time would feasibly
3568300	3571000	be at a Boise to hop on a plane or whatever.
3571000	3574880	And uh, he logged into back into the account and he had a ton of Oshawa because actually
3574920	3575920	it wasn't just that.
3575920	3580520	So it wasn't just me catching them, but then Alan, and this was Alan's idea, Alan caught
3580520	3585400	a bunch as well and was like, well, why don't I just trade Shane?
3585400	3588760	Like like I'm going to have 20 of these, only two or three of them are going to be decently
3588760	3589760	appraised.
3589760	3594760	I'll just trade all these one star zero star Oshawa and he can have more.
3594760	3597240	And I was like, Shane would probably really like that.
3597240	3599780	So we filled up his account with Oshawa.
3599780	3604400	So I know, and, and one of those Oshawa when we traded one of them went lucky.
3604440	3607040	So he got like a lucky on his account.
3607040	3609200	So I know he's got to be happy with all that thing.
3609200	3613460	So, uh, so yeah, the gen five starters, they do nest.
3613460	3617040	It's just that since they're competing with all the other nests out there, they can be
3617040	3618040	hard to find.
3618040	3623680	Um, but I imagine the other, uh, uh, starters, the little fire piggy, uh, and the grass thing
3623680	3625600	that looks like all the other grass things.
3625600	3630400	Um, they also nest, uh, as well, which I haven't caught either of those other starters.
3630400	3633360	Oshawa's the only starter I've caught so far, but I did.
3633360	3637440	I went out there and caught, you know, P dove and there was one, one little cat things
3637440	3640080	per something was on the house earlier.
3640080	3646160	Um, I got the, like I said, it looked like an angry chipmunk or something.
3646160	3647360	I don't know what that is.
3647360	3649320	Oh, the, uh, Pat rat.
3649320	3652160	Uh, maybe I know they get my decks here.
3652160	3653160	Let's see.
3653160	3654160	Yeah.
3654160	3661620	So it was, I got the, um, yeah, Pat rat and then, um, the little pup and I swear the pigeon
3661620	3662960	one was one as well.
3662960	3665520	But maybe is that last gen still?
3665520	3667320	No P dove is gen five.
3667320	3668320	Really?
3668320	3669320	Yeah.
3669320	3670320	Where is it then?
3670320	3671320	Did I not catch it?
3671320	3672320	Maybe you haven't caught it yet.
3672320	3673960	I started to get this from gen five.
3673960	3677200	I actually, I just caught, there was an evolved because I had a silhouette.
3677200	3678200	Oh no, here it is.
3678200	3679200	Here it is.
3679200	3680200	I didn't know it.
3680200	3681240	See, it was stuck at the bottom there.
3681240	3683600	One of the evolved, one of those I caught in the wild randomly.
3683600	3687240	I didn't think I'd find one of those, but it was at the park and I was walking around
3687240	3688240	there earlier today.
3688240	3692920	So, um, but yeah, uh, I got to say gen five kind of has me interested in Pokemon again.
3692960	3696600	Cause I was, I was really burned out on it, um, honestly.
3696600	3699480	And then when Harry Potter came out, I was like, Oh, something else to play.
3699480	3705040	But now it's like, I'm kind of burned out on Ingress at this point, which is bad because
3705040	3711200	Ingress, uh, we have that anomaly coming up here locally, but I think it's all the, and
3711200	3712440	I don't know how much I can really talk about it.
3712440	3714540	It's all the planning that goes into an anomaly.
3714540	3719680	I'm like already like, can this anomaly be done please?
3719680	3721480	So I'm kind of like burned out on Ingress at this point.
3721480	3724660	So Pokemon goes kind of like the thing where I'm like, okay, Ooh, there's something new
3724660	3726480	and shiny going on over here.
3726480	3728520	So I want to go play this game for a little bit.
3728520	3730760	So it's fun kind of catching the new stuff.
3730760	3734240	So people are like finally getting presents from me again when people were like, why haven't
3734240	3735720	you sent me a present in two months?
3735720	3740120	Cause I haven't been playing, I got distracted by like Harry Potter and stuff.
3740120	3741480	What can I, what can I say?
3741480	3742480	All right.
3742480	3747000	Um, uh, Totion says, Rob, don't forget about those hot Mr. Mime eggs.
3747000	3752760	I didn't get a shiny Mr. Mime, but I did get a shiny, um, Tauros hatched from an egg.
3752760	3757560	And I caught shiny, two of them, shiny Yanma are going on this weekend.
3757560	3761880	Those really gross looking bug things, but they're green and blue and the shiny one,
3761880	3764120	they're kind of a cute little, uh, color combination.
3764120	3768560	I caught two randomly at work, so I guess I shouldn't complain cause I bet some people
3768560	3771620	are having a hard time even, uh, capturing one.
3771620	3775120	So now act deaf to screaming at me to open my damn gifts.
3775160	3776320	I'm sorry.
3776320	3778760	It's because we're already four star friends act deaf.
3778760	3782420	So I tend to prioritize the people that are lower on the list.
3782420	3783420	So sorry.
3783420	3789480	Um, I will do my best, but yeah, if we weren't limited to 20 a day, I'd open more gifts,
3789480	3794320	but yeah, it's, I am really bad at opening gifts, but like when I'm out there for community
3794320	3799420	day, I think on community day, I sent a gift to every single person on my list.
3799420	3803280	If I could, unless you like had one in the backlog, I don't know.
3803280	3804280	Anyway.
3804320	3804820	All right.
3804820	3807200	So Pokemon go, we'll see how long the gen five thing lasts for.
3807200	3811840	And hopefully, um, people will be, um, continue to be interested in the game.
3811840	3815160	Uh, but what long, what long legs this game has had?
3815160	3815660	Yes.
3815660	3816160	Right.
3816920	3820720	When most people thought it was, yeah, most people said it was a dead game a long time
3820720	3821720	ago.
3821720	3824480	Um, this game has a very long life.
3824480	3829880	This series anyway, dragon quest is the next series to talk about dragon quest one, two,
3829880	3835960	and three, those new little remakes, uh, the little, uh, reimagining of the game.
3835960	3840800	They are coming out in the U S that's very exciting because these were available in Japan
3840800	3841800	previously.
3841800	3845420	Uh, it's kind of like a reimagined version of dragon quest one, two, and three, which
3845420	3848760	of course with the NES games in the series back in the day.
3848760	3853580	Um, so they, the, the reimagining or it's just kind of like HD textures and things like
3853580	3860220	that are coming out, uh, on the Nintendo switch eShop on September 27th, just in time
3860220	3866480	for dragon quest 11 S echoes of an elusive age that is also launching the same day.
3866480	3868620	And I'm sure many people are looking forward to that.
3868620	3873860	Um, I don't, I want to get dragon quest 11, but it's like, I already bought it on PlayStation
3873860	3874860	four.
3874860	3878820	So I'm kind of waiting to see if maybe there will be a price reduction or something like
3878820	3879820	that.
3879820	3880820	Couple of things.
3880820	3882700	We'll see what one, we became lucky friends.
3882700	3885620	Did we really to your cat's eating plastic?
3885620	3886620	So I'm not really sure.
3886620	3887620	All right.
3887620	3888820	I need to take care of the smush thing.
3888820	3893700	Can you, uh, talk about, uh, dragon quest memories or something on topic?
3893700	3898460	So yeah, I remember playing dragon warrior because that's how I remember it.
3898460	3902180	And um, it was like one of the first games that I borrowed from a friend actually.
3902180	3906020	Um, cause I, I don't know, it was just different.
3906020	3909340	I think I remember seeing in like a Nintendo power or something, I was like, Oh, I got
3909340	3910340	to try that.
3910340	3916020	Um, I don't think I ever finished it unless I cheated with the game genie, but I don't
3916020	3917980	think I ever finished the dragon warrior game.
3917980	3919180	I think I gave up on them.
3919180	3920740	I mean, you follow fancy though.
3920740	3922020	I went through some of those.
3922020	3924920	I did beat the original dragon warrior actually.
3924920	3927380	And it was thanks to, uh, the, uh, guide.
3927380	3928380	Oh yeah.
3928380	3929380	Yeah.
3929380	3932740	You got, remember Nintendo power, put out that guy to try to really get that, uh, series
3932740	3934100	hyped out here.
3934100	3936820	So now what are we going to trade?
3936820	3937820	I don't know.
3937820	3938820	I don't know.
3938820	3939820	I think shinies.
3939820	3943540	I want a shiny to go lucky and then I can, cause that'll guarantee that it'll be a high
3943540	3946820	appraisal and then we can really, uh, amp it up.
3946820	3949140	So I think that's, do you have shinies that are worth a damn?
3949140	3952180	Uh, I mean, I don't really care about my shiny, so that's fine.
3952180	3953180	All right.
3953180	3956260	We'll have to look, we'll have to decide later, maybe during the break, uh, uh, later tonight
3956260	3957260	we'll figure that out.
3957260	3959140	But I'm excited for the dragon quest reimagines.
3959140	3961100	I definitely want to pick up at least part one.
3961100	3965660	I never really played part two or part three as much, but maybe I will.
3965660	3966740	I'm not sure yet.
3966740	3971660	The original dragon quest, $5, four 99, five bucks, excuse me.
3971660	3977580	Dragon quest two will be six 49 drag quest three, 12 49, but a dragon quest three was
3977580	3979960	a pretty beefy game if I remember right.
3979960	3982020	So yeah, not too surprised.
3982020	3986180	Uh, active says trade either a legendary or a shiny or a shiny legendary.
3986180	3987180	Yeah.
3987180	3988180	I don't know what Loki has available.
3988180	3996620	Got a cast form, boo, uh, uh, Charmeleon shinies, gold duck, uh, magnum megalith.
3996620	3997860	I don't know how to pronounce that thing.
3997860	3999340	The weird like thing.
3999340	4000340	And then a Venusaur.
4000340	4001340	Okay.
4001340	4004260	He's, he's looking pretty skimpy on the shiny, so we're gonna have to see if we can trade
4004260	4005260	a legendary or something.
4005260	4006260	We'll see.
4006260	4007260	All right.
4007260	4008260	Anyway, we'll figure that out later.
4008260	4009500	That's fun that we went lucky though.
4009500	4011500	Uh, let's move on.
4011500	4012500	Next story.
4012500	4013500	All right.
4013500	4023340	Um, so Sony had purchased, uh, is insomniac games and you may remember insomniac games,
4023340	4028340	um, also happened to put out a game aside from, you know, Spiderman and ratchet and
4028340	4033980	clank a game on the Xbox, uh, one called sunset overdrive.
4033980	4040060	And well now because of that purchase, you know, apparently Sony interactive entertainment
4040060	4045980	does now hold the rights to, um, their past work, including sunset overdrive.
4045980	4053100	So, but right now though, they don't have any sort of interest in working out an agreement
4053100	4058420	to port sunset or sunset overdrive to the PlayStation four, but they are looking forward
4058420	4066980	to future titles according to, um, Sony interactive entertainment president, uh, Shahey Yoshida.
4066980	4071300	So that's unfortunate cause sunset overdrive, I thought was pretty cool.
4071300	4074840	Um, I still haven't played it though, but it looked cool.
4074840	4081180	Maybe we'll see a sequel to sunset overdrive come to, uh, the PlayStation four, much like
4081180	4084980	we did with Titanfall where Titanfall one never made it to the PlayStation four, but
4084980	4086180	Titanfall two did.
4086180	4090980	So maybe there's hope in that sense if they decide to, um, do a new game.
4090980	4096060	But I don't believe that the first game sold all that well, but that's never stopped people
4096140	4097140	in the past.
4097140	4100900	So we'll have to wait and see, I guess.
4100900	4101900	Yeah.
4101900	4105900	Um, I would be curious, uh, what Sony's going to do with this.
4105900	4108820	I feel like a sequel might be a thing on PlayStation five.
4108820	4114580	Like, you know, this game was kind of like cults hit enough that maybe they're gonna,
4114580	4120340	you know, use this new acquisition to make it happen on PlayStation five to make some
4120340	4123500	of those Xbox folks a little bit jealous.
4123500	4125540	I mean, that's, that's what happens sometimes.
4126020	4127780	I'm sure Microsoft's done the same thing to them.
4127780	4129940	So yeah, it happens.
4129940	4132060	So Dr. Sia says, yeah, I agree with Rob.
4132060	4134020	I'm sure we'll see the next one on PlayStation five.
4134020	4135020	Yeah.
4135020	4136700	I kind of think that's the direction this stuff is headed into.
4136700	4138380	So we'll see.
4138380	4142460	Uh, going a little bit to retro game news.
4142460	4146020	There's this new video that folks have been reporting on.
4146020	4151380	Then I saw this, uh, over on Eurogamer ran a story on this whole thing that apparently
4151380	4156500	they have done an analysis on the old video game street fighter two in the arcades.
4156500	4160740	And as it turns out, if you felt that the computer was a dirty cheater when playing
4160740	4163700	street fighter two, it turns out you were right.
4163700	4167540	The computer does do some things that make it a dirty cheater.
4167540	4172500	Uh, it was actually desk was the name of the, uh, street fighter player that put out the
4172500	4173500	video.
4173500	4178500	Uh, and it actually does like a frame by frame analysis to see how the computer can actually
4178500	4184300	turn invisible or invisible, invincible that for a short moment to actually dodge some
4184300	4185300	attacks basically.
4185300	4191780	Uh, so the AI of the game will just turn invincible at some points, uh, to help block your tax.
4191780	4195420	Uh, also the CPU can break out of dizziness.
4195420	4197740	You remember when your character would get dizzy and street fire, you have to like mash
4197740	4199140	all the buttons to snap out of it.
4199140	4200140	Yeah.
4200140	4203760	The computer just snaps out of it instantly, way faster than you would possibly be able
4203760	4204760	to do.
4204760	4207860	Uh, and then let's see, like, uh, the charge moves.
4207860	4210100	Like let's say you want to do guile's flash kick, right?
4210100	4213680	And where we had to have charged down and then hit up and kick in order to do the flash
4213680	4214680	kick.
4214680	4215680	Well, guess what?
4215680	4216680	The computer doesn't have to charge.
4216680	4218380	You can just do those moves whenever they want.
4218380	4225060	So confirmed street fighter two is a dirty cheater, but here's, here's my kind of counterpoint
4225060	4227360	to this whole thing.
4227360	4232220	When you are, well for one counterpoint get good counterpoint one, get good bitch.
4232220	4237620	No, uh, is that, uh, one arcade owners can kind of set the difficulty level of these
4237620	4241460	machines so they can make, cause you know, some machines were harder than others and
4241460	4242460	that's why.
4242460	4247860	But also, um, this is, you know, when you do play on harder modes and video games, street
4247860	4251140	fighter isn't the only one that cheats.
4251140	4254300	It's some games will be more transparent about it than others.
4254300	4259180	For example, let's take a game that's near and dear to my heart civilization, right?
4259180	4260700	Or civ six, whatever.
4260700	4262220	Pick, pick any game in the series.
4262220	4264120	They all work the same way.
4264120	4268000	When you play on the easiest level, something like Chieftain, and this is very transparent
4268000	4273500	in the game, but when you play on something like Chieftain, you basically are normal and
4273500	4277780	the computer players get weakened by like 60% or maybe even half.
4277780	4281000	I don't remember the exact percentage, but the computer players actually get weakened.
4281000	4285780	They get multipliers that work against them and actually, uh, being able to like conquer
4285780	4287380	you and take over your territory.
4287380	4290320	So it makes it a lot easier for you to win the game.
4290320	4294880	Whereas if you play in the hardest mode of the game, guess what?
4294880	4296160	It's reversed.
4296160	4299340	Now you get multipliers that work against you.
4299340	4303780	Whereas the computer is in kind of a, a more standard type of mode.
4303780	4307300	So in a way, like even though I know we're kind of talking about like, Oh, street fighter
4307300	4310300	two is a dirty cheater and there's videos and stories all about it.
4310300	4314580	It's kind of like, I kind of feel in some way, this is just how difficulty works in
4314580	4315580	video games.
4315580	4319700	Sometimes it is some ways that they can do difficulties.
4319700	4324820	It's hard to program difficulty in, you mean it's usually, you know, one of the easiest
4324820	4329020	ways to do it is, you know, some sort of multiplier that you can adjust on the fly.
4329020	4333260	Um, you know, you also have like stuff like Mario Kart where they will try to balance
4333260	4336580	the game by, you know, the rubber band AI.
4336580	4342000	So you know, whereas when they're further back, they go faster or they'll get stronger
4342000	4343580	power ups in the back.
4344300	4348540	Great call out on super Mario Kart that especially, especially the original, I mean all the games
4348540	4352500	have it, but you know, with the super Nintendo library now being on the switch, if you're
4352500	4357220	a Nintendo online person, go back and play the original Mario Kart because it is very
4357220	4360100	obvious in that game, very obvious in that game.
4360100	4364940	And it's not even that they rubber band, it's that the characters will always finish in
4364940	4369780	a certain order, like always, unless something really extreme happens.
4369820	4370320	Yeah.
4370320	4373660	Like there could be like, Oh, Hey, I just hit Donkey Kong, three different red shells
4373660	4376660	and yet somehow he's up my ass with yet another red shell.
4376660	4377660	Yeah.
4377660	4378660	Uh, it's, it's crazy.
4378660	4379660	Yeah.
4379660	4382060	I would say Mario Kart's the dirtiest cheater game I've ever seen.
4382060	4385700	It puts, it puts what we're talking about in street fighter to shame, uh, dark to see
4385700	4389180	you says, I mean, I think we all kind of suspected, but it's nice.
4389180	4391380	Someone went to the trouble to try and confirm that.
4391380	4394640	And I think there's a lot of that kind of playing into the nostalgia of this story going
4394640	4399420	around the game blogs and Twitter feeds and stuff this week is because it confirms what
4399460	4402740	we all knew when we were 12 and now we're in our thirties, right?
4402740	4406780	When we were 12, we're like, this game's a fucking cheater that computer, they fucking
4406780	4407780	cheated.
4407780	4408780	No, this stuff.
4408780	4409780	Right.
4409780	4413500	And now it's like, well, yes, they, they did in fact cheat and somebody brought the receipts
4413500	4414500	to prove it.
4414500	4418620	But, uh, I guess my point is, is that if you amp up the difficulty in video games, they
4418620	4419900	all kind of cheat.
4419900	4420900	And especially, yeah.
4420900	4422500	In arcades, this is notorious.
4422500	4427220	Um, let's see, act depth and chat says, isn't the arcade being tougher than they actually
4427220	4430820	are common knowledge now, uh, especially with ticket spitters.
4430820	4431820	Yeah.
4431820	4432820	Especially depending on the arcade.
4432820	4437820	Again, there are dip switches, what they're called, but they're basically switches inside
4437820	4438820	the game.
4438820	4442540	They, cause I think back in the day they really were physical switches, but obviously a lot
4442540	4446220	of that went electronic over the years so that when you boot up the game, when you first
4446220	4449900	plug it in for the first time, the arcade operator can set what difficulty they want
4449900	4451100	the game to play on.
4451100	4455060	So there were some arcades when you would go play something like street fighter and
4455060	4458100	it, yes, it would be harder than it would be at other arcades.
4458100	4462980	Um, especially depending on if the arcade operator knew how to set that or not.
4462980	4463980	Right.
4463980	4468140	Cause I'm sure you have some stories from Roosevelt golf land about messing with those
4468140	4469380	switches in certain games.
4469380	4474100	I don't mess with any of that stuff, but like, yeah, I know just from, you know, Mame and
4474100	4481300	also accessing the operation like menu and stuff in like just my dance house revolution,
4481300	4487400	you can set the difficulty on that if you want it or like you can, um, I mean, yeah,
4487400	4489420	you can do it all, all sorts of stuff with that.
4489420	4493620	Not even just Mame, but like if you were to play like an arcade collection, like let's
4493620	4496900	say you're playing that and this is going to be random, but maybe that collection that
4496900	4499820	had like magic sword and was it final fight?
4499820	4500820	Yeah.
4500820	4501820	Yeah.
4501820	4502820	It was like, it was an awesome collection.
4502820	4505940	It was on Xbox 360 cause I love magic sword, but you can go to the options menu and you
4505940	4508380	can set how many points for an extra life.
4508380	4509940	How many lives do you start with?
4509940	4513900	Those were all dip switches that the arcade operator could set.
4513900	4518140	Like at some arcades you would spend a lot more money to beat Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
4518140	4522280	from start to finish than you would in others because of the switches.
4522280	4526660	So anyway, uh, questmaster kind of confirming this in chat saying, yep, arcade operators
4526660	4527980	can set difficulty.
4527980	4532140	How many tokens are needed to continue or even if players are allowed to continue all
4532140	4537180	the more help to squeeze just a few more quarters from players and dark to see it says that
4537180	4542180	beat em up bundle that Capcom did has a lot of those options you can tweak to SSG100 Matt
4542180	4543300	talking about pinball.
4543300	4549460	Uh, there were places that raised pinball tables to make the ball fall faster.
4549460	4550460	That's right.
4550460	4551460	Pinball tables.
4551460	4552960	Some people kind of mess with those as well.
4552960	4556660	So interesting how those arcades worked at least back in the day.
4556660	4560380	You probably see less of it now because no, you see it totally now cause you know what
4560380	4561760	those tickets, you're right.
4561760	4564880	Tickets, spitter, ticket, spitters, all those more traditional games because the ticket
4564880	4569000	spitter games that you think are skill based where you have to time like, you know, hitting
4569000	4570600	a button or something like that.
4570600	4574320	It's nice how there's artificial random lag in there sometimes.
4574320	4577440	Funny how that works because it's on purpose.
4577440	4582960	It's ensure to make sure they don't give the big prize away, but once every like 500 plays
4582960	4587720	or something like that, whatever it's set to and those crazy, crazy sneaky, sneaky.
4587720	4588720	All right.
4588720	4589720	Anyway, let's move on.
4589720	4592840	Um, some people would say this is sneaky, sneaky, another steam story tonight.
4592840	4593840	Yeah.
4593840	4597560	As we were talking about how the previous steam story, whereas if they were going to
4597560	4601520	allow use game sales that could possibly hurt developers.
4601520	4606920	Well, here's the real thing that already is hurting developers and that's the redesign
4606920	4610080	to their discovery system that they have.
4610080	4614560	So they have that big update where they've changed how, um, stuff is going to come into
4614560	4617000	your feed, uh, different discovery stuff.
4617000	4622800	And they found based on like, you know, sales and wishlist ads or whatever and deletions
4623240	4628480	that the wishlist ads have gone down dramatically since they've implemented that.
4628480	4636040	So there's a game for a game unbound worlds apart that was showing, you know, the trend
4636040	4644040	in their steam wishlist ads and how once that, you know, once they September 10th hit, it's
4644040	4646840	just straight down.
4646840	4648320	So that is kind of blame.
4648320	4652560	Um, there's another game, bright red skies, similar type of thing where September 11th
4653000	4657760	straight down, um, people stopped seeing their game says it was actually performing.
4657760	4665040	Um, it dropped 66% and all time low yikes months, months of effort ruined in an instant.
4665040	4666040	I forgot.
4666040	4670240	I did notice that the steam store like redid stuff or is that because I'm in the beta?
4670240	4674280	Like I got that new games library push that shows your games library all differently.
4674280	4675280	Yeah.
4675280	4678680	It might be to the beta cause I don't have it yet cause I have the beta version.
4678680	4679680	Yeah.
4679680	4682000	If you're, if you opt into the beta, you can see what it looks like now.
4682000	4683000	So that's interesting.
4683000	4685600	I, I honestly didn't spend a lot of time with it.
4685600	4686600	You know, it's funny.
4686600	4690160	I was only in there to uninstall games because I was running out of space in my primary drive
4690160	4692880	and I've been trying to do some more video stuff, wink, wink.
4692880	4697760	Um, so I need to clear up some space and I was like, why do I have some of these games
4697760	4698760	installed?
4698760	4699760	I'm literally never going to play.
4699760	4703000	So I just had to go through and do uninstall and I was like, Oh, I got the new steam library
4703000	4704000	at some point.
4704000	4705000	Yeah.
4705000	4709280	So there's a lot of, a lot of different developers reaching out saying that they've kind of seen
4709280	4710280	similar things.
4710280	4716720	Um, their wish list has dropped 80%, um, another developer of the platform, a room fencer,
4716720	4723360	um, Ilia and you know, what's unfortunate cause you know, you want those wish lists
4723360	4728800	to be on there, especially pre-release of a game because then they're going to get notified
4728800	4732760	when the game gets released or notified when the game goes on sales and you're trying to
4732760	4736000	convert those wish lists into actual purchases.
4736880	4741720	Um, it's kind of like a way to just, you know, help promote your discovery of your game.
4741720	4746040	But being that they've redesigned how it works, it's fine.
4746040	4752040	People are having trouble actually discovering those games as if that wasn't a problem before
4752040	4756520	with so many games out in that platform.
4756520	4758120	So I don't know what they're going to do.
4758120	4759760	I guess continue to tweak it.
4759760	4765800	Um, because it's basically their algorithm, but, um, you know, pays basically, I don't
4765800	4771040	know, it's maybe over time it'll get better, but I don't know.
4771040	4774240	It's hard to say steam's running into a lot of problems this week.
4774240	4779120	I mean, between the, you know, thing going on in France and now this like, you know,
4779120	4783080	and we were picking on steam a little bit, but, um, you know, maybe this story, not so
4783080	4786440	much the Epic store, but you know, the, the, yeah, there's not enough on the Epic store
4786440	4787920	to be able to not find it.
4787920	4788920	Yeah.
4788920	4791620	The first thing we were talking about with the France decision, you know, that could
4791620	4793680	trickle down and affect other stores too.
4793680	4799280	So a lot of the digital storefronts are having issues this week and you know, and it is interesting
4799280	4803320	how big changes when it comes to discoverability can really trickle down.
4803320	4806160	I know YouTube has kind of had a lot with this too, right?
4806160	4811600	They need some changes, their discoverability algorithm to try to push back on some of the
4811600	4814060	extremism we'll say that goes on on YouTube.
4814060	4817000	And it's had this like ripple effect that's affected normal people.
4817000	4818000	They have that.
4818000	4823920	And they also had the thing where they were retooling how that you would, how you would
4823920	4827920	get the, uh, verified tags on your account.
4827920	4834860	So they said that that was supposed to combat channels that are impersonating other channels,
4834860	4837960	but some of those channels that they were impersonating were verified.
4837960	4839800	Now they're removing their verification tag.
4839800	4842280	So how does that help again?
4842280	4844520	It's just, it's stupid.
4844520	4848640	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says devil's advocate steam is prioritizing games consumers can
4848640	4853200	buy today because they can spend their money today.
4853200	4859760	So steam is doing these today because you're, you're on the store ready to spend money,
4859760	4862920	but you're not necessarily on the store spending money.
4862920	4866120	Like I'm signing into steam and I go kind of browse and see what's there.
4866120	4868160	I'm not like, Oh, I'm going to spend money today.
4868160	4870160	It's just to see what's out there.
4870160	4874920	Whereas you know, if this is going to be something that developers are aware of, it's going to
4874920	4879720	make them less likely wanting to put their game on steam because they're like, Hey, Hmm,
4879720	4883800	I could put it on Epic, which, you know, granted people are kind of, it has a stigma right
4883800	4890000	now because it has less features, but there's less games on there and it's easier to discover
4890000	4891000	my game.
4891000	4893460	And I get a larger cut than I would with steam.
4893460	4898720	So it's just another box ticked, I guess in Epic's favor in that sense.
4898720	4904860	But I just think that there needs to be some ways to be able to discover that stuff.
4904860	4908240	Like having some of those pre-release games or something like that, and then maybe their
4908240	4914800	own section or maybe that, I don't know, you can say, Hey, I'm interested in finding out
4914800	4920600	about these types of games and having to show that stuff, maybe cater to what you actually
4920600	4921600	play.
4921600	4923280	I don't know.
4923280	4927840	Well, let's move on, uh, for time so we can get to the classic game of the week here.
4927840	4932600	But first we have one more story for this half of the show talking about Xbox game pass
4932600	4936240	and kind of how it ties into some additional rewards, because I think a lot of you guys
4936240	4939640	out there probably heard about the whole, like you can kind of upgrade your regular
4939640	4942760	Xbox live to the Xbox game passing for like a dollar, right?
4942760	4946920	So I think a lot of you probably took advantage of that well, because you took advantage of
4946920	4947920	that.
4947920	4949160	You have access to this as well.
4949160	4952080	There is a Microsoft reward point promotion going on right now.
4952080	4957260	You can earn up to 10,000 reward points for every gamer score point that you get.
4957260	4959040	You get one Microsoft for world point.
4959040	4962260	So yeah, unlocking achievements right now you get reward points.
4962260	4963260	So that's kind of interesting.
4963260	4964260	Yeah.
4964260	4965260	And there's other weird things.
4965260	4967900	Well, I should, I shouldn't say weird, but there's other interesting kind of tie-ins
4967900	4968900	with this too.
4968900	4973900	Um, let's say like, I guess some of the points depends on what game you play.
4973900	4977660	So like devil may cry five, you might get like a hundred points, but achievements in
4977660	4981860	middle earth, shadow of war, middle earth, shadow of Mordor, you get 300 points.
4981860	4986660	But I thought this was interesting too, is that if you play the Blair witch game, cause
4986660	4988620	you know, that just came out on game pass, right?
4988620	4989620	Yeah.
4989620	4993020	If you play that, you get the Blair witch film.
4993020	4998620	So you can relieve all that or re relieve, relive all that 1999 realness all over again.
4998620	5000620	I, it probably doesn't hold up very well.
5000620	5004060	And a lot of people probably watch that movie and think it's lame, but like, you have to
5004060	5008540	remember when that movie first came out, it was, there was nothing like it like ever.
5008540	5011500	And that movie literally scared the shit out of so many people.
5011500	5013740	So, um, interesting.
5013740	5017420	But I think that's kind of interesting that Microsoft's, you know, continuing to really
5017420	5022140	push this game pass thing, you know, 10,000 Microsoft points, I think is the equivalent
5022140	5023520	of like 10 bucks.
5023520	5027700	So it's not like they're giving away the whole farm, but it's something, Hey, it's something
5027700	5028700	for nothing.
5028700	5031880	I mean, are you really doing nothing for game pass?
5031880	5037420	Probably not, but it's still something a little bit of an added value, so, all right.
5037420	5040860	So we are going to go to the classic game of the week.
5040860	5044740	And before we jump right into the classic game of the week, I will say that during this
5044740	5048980	segment, we're actually going to do the whole little Twitch giveaway for those of you that
5048980	5051000	are watching live tonight.
5051000	5056920	If you contributed to the Twitch prime loot chest, we are about to give those away.
5056920	5061740	There are 16 gifts in the chest of the Dauntless gunslinger.
5061740	5066140	I don't even know what that is, but it's probably for some, Hey, it's for a game called Dauntless,
5066140	5067900	apparently something for nothing.
5067900	5068900	Remember that?
5069320	5074260	I'm just going to theorize with that many gifts in the pot, probably all of you that
5074260	5076860	are not on Twitch prime are about to get one.
5076860	5080620	I mean, don't call me on that, but I can see how many people are watching and how many
5080620	5081620	people are on prime.
5081620	5084880	I'm thinking all of you are about to get a free something, something here.
5084880	5087180	So please enjoy it.
5087180	5091520	And thank you to everybody who put something into the gift basket.
5091520	5092820	We really appreciate it.
5092820	5093820	Oh, thank you, Shane.
5093820	5097580	Dauntless is like a monster hunter clone, it seems, but I hear it's pretty decent.
5097580	5101100	Well, maybe this code will be some incentive to go check it out, which is probably exactly
5101100	5103300	what they want in giving this away.
5103300	5106320	But we're going to check that out while we go to the classic game of the week.
5106320	5111180	So for the classic game of the week tonight, Dark Sakura, she would usually do the classic
5111180	5115120	game of the week, take a step down memory lane and pick a game out of the vault.
5115120	5118480	But as you guys know, she has the night off while she's resting her voice.
5118480	5122980	So we've been trying to invite some friends to come on the show and do this segment.
5122980	5125980	Like we had what a VG realness was here a few months ago.
5125980	5130900	The guys from Game Buoy have both been on, uh, what like Shane did one, of course, eating
5130900	5131900	Pokemon, right?
5131900	5134820	But you know, out of all the people like we've had on the show doing the guest segment, you
5134820	5141380	know, we like haven't had on who the guy that has us on every single week at the end of
5141380	5142640	his show.
5142640	5149280	So it was probably about fucking time that we asked our pal Bobby Black Wolf to contribute
5149280	5151220	to this week's classic game of the week.
5151220	5155480	So after all of these years, Bobby Black Wolf, we're going to throw it over to you.
5155480	5160440	Please tell us your selection for this week's classic game of the week.
5160440	5162720	Hello all our, my name is Bobby Black Wolf.
5162720	5166200	I have been doing podcasting for 14 years.
5166200	5171060	Most of that leading up to all our, and they have never, ever asked me to do the classic
5171060	5172060	game of the week.
5172060	5175040	Probably because they were scared I was going to do halo, which has already been done as
5175040	5176040	a class game of the week.
5176040	5181000	So I think now I actually, it's safe for me to do a classic game of the week.
5181000	5182000	I can't do halo.
5182000	5183040	It's already been done.
5183040	5188520	I can't do my little prank to, you know, subvert the rules and put halo in because halo's already
5188520	5189520	in.
5189520	5190520	So I'm not going to do that.
5190520	5191520	So I'm actually going to do something that's more on brand.
5191520	5197040	I've got my DOS machine from the nineties here running MS-DOS 622.
5197040	5203640	I've got my Roland MT-32 turned on and hooked up so we can actually see some of these, see
5203640	5208040	this game and hear the game the way it was supposed to be played and heard.
5208040	5216120	And I'm looking forward to sharing this game with all of you and giving it the respect
5216120	5219980	that I believe it deserves here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5219980	5223340	So thank you very much for allowing me to do the classic game of the week.
5223340	5224340	And that's right.
5224340	5231200	It is Jones in the Fast Lane, a 1990 PC title for DOS.
5231200	5234480	Also came out on CD-ROM in 1992 by Sierra On-Line.
5234480	5235480	It's a board game.
5235480	5236960	It's about keeping up with the Joneses.
5236960	5245120	You want to get your life better in career, education, wealth, or happiness, or one of
5245120	5250120	them, or all of them, and you're racing against Jones, a little cartoon Jones.
5250120	5251120	It's a board game.
5251120	5255920	You play as a little marble that goes and gets a job and has a life and does some boring
5255920	5265440	stuff on the weekend and, hang on a second, hang on, I'm getting a text message.
5265440	5270560	Dear Bobby, Jones in the Fast Lane has already been done as an O.L.R. classic game of the
5270560	5272680	week.
5272680	5274680	You cannot repeat.
5274680	5276680	Oh.
5276680	5278680	Okay.
5278680	5280680	Um.
5280680	5288680	I guess we'll have to do something different.
5288680	5291640	Okay, okay, okay.
5291640	5292640	So I got it now.
5292640	5294800	I checked the wiki.
5295160	5300760	I am not doing a game that has already been done, so I think we're good, so we're going
5300760	5303800	to try game number two.
5303800	5305520	I'm going to load it up right here.
5305520	5313320	This was also a game that made a mark on me, and I thought this game, this was the future,
5313320	5317160	like this was the best graphics was ever going to get.
5317160	5326680	I thought this was going to be just the pinnacle of graphics and storytelling, and I was wrong
5326680	5330040	a little bit, but it's by Dynamics.
5330040	5331040	A subsidiary.
5331040	5332040	It was part of the Sierra family.
5332040	5333760	It really was.
5333760	5341040	But this game came out on DOS, later on Sega CD actually, and it's one that I really enjoyed.
5341040	5344520	It's called The Adventures of Willie Beamish.
5344520	5350840	So it's a point-and-click adventure game about this kid who's going to be an esports superstar.
5350840	5360440	Now esports wasn't a term back then, but he wanted to be an esports superstar winner.
5360440	5364920	This was around the same time as the Super Mario Brothers 3 Nintendo Direct, which they
5364920	5367080	released in theaters, called it The Wizard.
5367080	5368760	So it's kind of like that.
5368760	5375160	And so Willie Beamish is this kid who wants to be the Nintari champion.
5375160	5378920	Yes, Nintari is what he plays.
5378920	5385480	And it was all done with animators, like actual former Disney animators worked on all the
5385480	5391720	graphics for this game, which is why when this came out in the early 90s, we were like,
5391720	5394080	wow, this looks like a cartoon.
5394080	5399880	Now obviously we look at it nowadays, and it doesn't look that much like a cartoon.
5399880	5402480	It's very pixelated, and we're like, oh, that's nothing.
5402480	5407240	That's like, you know, we have plug-and-play games that look better than this.
5407240	5415440	But it really did have, it broke through a lot of stuff on this.
5415440	5424080	So as we kind of go, as on the video here, we're going through the intro here.
5424080	5425920	There were a couple of different aspects to this game.
5425920	5430920	It was a traditional Sierra game, and there were many, many ways to fail.
5430920	5434240	You could die in so many hilarious ways.
5434240	5438920	But the game starts out that it's the last day of school at Carbunkle Elementary.
5438920	5442080	And Principal Frick, these are all stereotypes, by the way.
5442080	5443960	Everything's stereotypical.
5443960	5447480	He's addressing the students at a farewell assembly, and he's going, blah, blah, blah,
5447480	5448480	blah, blah, blah, blah.
5448480	5454360	And of course, of course, Willy Beamish has a pet frog, because of course every kid in
5454360	5457680	the 80s, late 80s, had a pet frog.
5457680	5464880	And he's asleep in there, and the frog comes out, and he steals the toupee of the principal
5464880	5467680	and embarrasses him in front of the entire class.
5467680	5468680	Ha, ha, ha.
5468680	5469920	Isn't that funny, ladies and gentlemen?
5469920	5472240	Well, he goes to detention.
5472240	5474900	He's after school detention, the last session.
5474900	5476800	Of course, he's in there.
5476800	5480420	And he's dreaming of eSports.
5480420	5484200	He's dreaming of being an Evo, except it's called the Nintari Championship.
5484200	5487420	They're sitting at a computer, but using a joystick.
5487420	5493120	And I don't know if he's doing WASD or not, but he's going up against this other kid.
5493120	5495560	And then he wakes up.
5495560	5501920	He wakes up from the dream, and his teacher starts asking him questions.
5501920	5507600	And of course, the teacher is this really old lady, note called Ms. Glass.
5507600	5509760	No stereotypes whatsoever.
5509760	5515760	Now, what I'm not showing you right here is the actual voice acting, because in the CD-ROM
5515760	5519440	version and in the Sega CD version of this game, there is voice acting.
5519440	5524560	I am playing on the floppy disk version, because it allows Roland MT-32 stuff.
5524560	5528200	If you have the CD-ROM version, it does not allow you to use the Roland MT-32, so you
5528200	5529840	don't get the better music.
5529880	5532680	So this is really the best music, the game here.
5544680	5551680	And so you're basically trying to get through and solve puzzles without continually dying.
5551680	5556940	And you have a frog, like I said, named Horny, which, by the way, is a banned word on Twitch.
5556940	5559480	You need to get moderator approval to say the name of the frog.
5559480	5562840	That was fun, because I streamed this entire game on Twitch.
5562840	5567840	Now one of the other things I do want to point out is that since this was a game of the 90s,
5567840	5569880	it actually came with stuff in the box.
5569880	5576080	So I actually got, and I still have my stickers here, of Willy Horny Leona, who was one of
5576080	5581560	the bad guys, and then Monster Squad, which was the game in the bottom right-hand corner.
5581560	5584660	That was technically the game they were playing.
5584660	5590540	And I got a menu from the Pizzeria, which also doubles as the installation instructors
5590540	5592380	on the back side of the menu.
5592380	5599260	And then also, there was a little notebook, spiral notebook, that it would give you.
5599260	5604600	That actually, it was top secret notebook, you were supposed to keep out or die, stop
5604600	5606640	before it's too late, and you go through there.
5606640	5611080	And it's basically, it's got little doodles, but it also has newspaper clippings of things
5611080	5612200	going on in the town.
5612200	5616800	And one of the things that they would do back in this time, and it was kind of copy protection,
5616800	5622240	kind of not, but they would actually have things, so like in here, there's like an ad
5622240	5629400	for a hypnosis course, where you actually need the contents of this ad to actually get
5629400	5630440	past something.
5630440	5634300	You actually need to put someone under hypnosis, and you need to select three words, and the
5634300	5636660	three words are in this book.
5636660	5641120	So that was, that's kind of some of the stuff they did a lot in the late 80s, early 90s,
5641120	5643120	especially the early Sierra games.
5643120	5648040	So I'm going to real quick go through and just show what the gameplay looks like once
5648040	5654640	I get to the, I'm going to load a game from my Twitch feed.
5654640	5658920	So I actually played this on Twitch, but this is kind of like, this was in Willy Beamish's
5658920	5664480	home, so as you click and walk on things, he actually goes through hand-drawn animations,
5664480	5666800	which was kind of a big deal in the 90s.
5666800	5673260	And then, you know, you could talk to your dog and stuff.
5673260	5679560	But it really looked like a cartoon, and that was what really made us all excited for it
5679560	5680560	when it came out.
5680560	5682720	And the game was okay.
5682720	5685720	And I mean, it didn't win too many awards, but it was a lot better than a lot of the
5685720	5687460	other ones.
5687460	5693120	And there are some action elements in it as well.
5693120	5697200	But there is a timer, so if you spend too long going around, you're actually going to
5697200	5703220	get in trouble, because this game I loaded, I'm not in bed.
5703220	5707600	So if I go all the way to cadet school on that trouble meter, which is a temperature
5707600	5714240	gauge that basically rises, your mom's temperature rises, then the game ends, and you get sent
5714240	5715240	to military school.
5715240	5717900	So I'm going to go into Willy Beamish's room on this.
5717900	5723040	So I'm upstairs in the house, and in his room, there's like, there's the Enterprise, I hang
5723040	5724720	it on, he's got a lot of planes.
5724720	5727280	It's a typical kid's room in the late 80s.
5727280	5732040	Big pirate ship and stuff like that, but he's got a Nintari system, so we're going to play
5732040	5733700	Nintari instead of going to bed.
5733700	5734700	Why not?
5734700	5738240	Because this shows the esports of 1989.
5738240	5741700	So this is the game, they look like Battletoads.
5741700	5747320	Like this is Battletoads coming in on the Nintari system, so this is the game that he's
5747320	5748760	actually playing.
5748760	5752000	The actual main characters, it's Monster Squad, they look like Battletoads, and then they
5752000	5753540	play Mario Brothers.
5753540	5755460	This was supposed to be esports.
5755460	5758400	This was esports in 1989.
5758400	5761360	I'm not actually playing it because this is not an action game.
5761360	5767060	And he's, I'm playing, there's a cupcake, I don't know, I don't get it.
5767060	5773440	So now I've practiced, and because I'm supposed to be in bed, well, you know, unfortunately,
5773440	5778640	mom is now really upset, the temperature gauge has gone all the way up, and so I have just
5778640	5784600	lost the game here live on OLR, because I'm now being sent to military school, getting
5784600	5792380	a buzz cut, and they're all, that was it.
5792380	5798440	And that's the end of the game, and that is the end of this classic Game of the Week segment.
5798440	5804560	Like I said, it was out on PC, it came out for Sega CD as well, with diminished graphics,
5804560	5807800	but it was an old CD-ROM game from 1993.
5807800	5811480	The Adventures of Willie Beamish.
5811480	5812480	Thanks OLR.
5812480	5819800	Now let's go back to Studio N7 in Sacramento for the rest of the show.
5819800	5823540	Thank you, Bobby Blackwell, for sharing that with us, that was a great video.
5823540	5828380	If you are watching live here at Twitch TV, for the podcast folks, you didn't notice anything
5828380	5830920	was wrong at all, because you could hear the segment wonderfully.
5830920	5836000	Unfortunately for us live here on Sunday night, the video froze at one part, so I had to make
5836000	5841760	a judgment call on the fly, because I can't actually have a video, I can't play right
5841760	5845400	from the middle of a video when I'm using OBS and playing a video back.
5845400	5847920	So I would have had to do the whole thing over again, which just would have been kind
5847920	5848920	of weird.
5848920	5851640	So I did just let it play through for the sake of the podcast.
5851640	5854740	So what I'm gonna do for those of you that are watching here at Twitch TV, because Bobby
5854740	5858240	did do a great job with that video, so I'm actually like, I'm a little pissed, like why
5858240	5860720	can't it, why couldn't it do that with one of the B-roll things, where it's like not
5860720	5861720	a big deal, right?
5861720	5864160	But it does it on that video for whatever reason.
5864200	5867440	I wonder if it was the audio, because it was when the audio kind of spiked, when I, so
5867440	5871000	I don't know, like now I'm kind of like running through scenarios, why did this happen?
5871000	5875000	So anyway, for those of you that are watching live, I'll replay that at the end of the show
5875000	5876920	tonight, so hopefully you can kind of see that.
5876920	5880280	And I think Bobby and I are talking behind the scenes, and it sounds like we might put
5880280	5883400	it up on your YouTube so you guys can see that, because he did do a really good job
5883400	5887080	with the segment, and Willy Beamish is, it's a fun game.
5887080	5890500	That's a game I remember playing too, and I also played the floppy disk version, although
5890500	5895740	I didn't have one of them fancy rolling cards, I had an AdLib card, which was still pretty
5895740	5896740	awesome of the day.
5896740	5897740	Did you ever play Willy Beamish?
5897740	5898740	No.
5898740	5899740	Really?
5899740	5900740	I did not.
5900740	5903420	It was such a, like, it was a great game, because it felt like-
5903420	5905860	I am aware of it, I just don't know.
5905860	5909500	The story about, you know, playing the video, it's like you, it's like you're playing
5909500	5910500	a game about yourself.
5910500	5911500	Yeah.
5911500	5914940	And I'm sure that is exactly the way it was designed, was, you know, kind of like what
5914940	5917620	they would be like as kids and so forth, so.
5917620	5922620	Very good pick from Bobby Blackwell, I'm glad he didn't use his valuable segment to, like,
5922620	5926220	pull a Halo joke or something, I'm just kidding.
5926220	5930380	He did a great job, it took us way too long to work him into that segment, so I'm glad
5930380	5931380	it all worked out.
5931380	5935100	I just feel really bad that, like, now that he got on the show, his fucking video that
5935100	5938300	he worked so hard on froze, but what can you do?
5938300	5941500	Live radio, boys and girls, as I always say.
5941500	5947020	Some other comments in chat, Dr. Sees says, the Jones and the Fast Lane bit had me going.
5947060	5948060	Yeah, me too.
5948060	5952260	I told him he could, I said, if you want to redo it, you can redo it, but I also said,
5952260	5955580	you could also use this opportunity to pick a game that we're probably never going to
5955580	5958820	pick otherwise, and so I think he did do the smart thing there.
5958820	5963020	At least, at least Jones and the Fast Game is, Jones and the Fast Lane is in the list.
5963020	5965500	Willie Beamish now is too, thanks to Bobby.
5965500	5969980	As Joe and Hunter Matt says, I played it on Sega CD, I rented it because I couldn't rent
5969980	5972500	the Jurassic Park Sega CD game.
5972500	5976860	I totally forgot there was a Jurassic Park Sega CD game, that's awesome.
5977180	5979660	All right, well, let's get back into some news.
5979660	5983900	We're going to travel around and check out some news real quickly here in this rapid
5983900	5984900	fire news segment.
5984900	5989660	This is going to be like the third week we're talking about the Neo Geo arcade stick, and
5989660	5993820	ironically enough, the joke that was made last week when we talked about, oh, what games
5993820	5994820	are going to be?
5994820	5999820	Was it all the King of Fighters and all the samurai showdowns and world hero games?
5999820	6001540	Yeah, that's exactly what it is.
6001540	6003700	So they announced the 20 games that are in there.
6003700	6008420	So the King of Fighters, 95, 97, 98, 99, 2000, 2002.
6008420	6015500	Fatal Fury Special, Fatal Fury 3, Garo, Mark of Wolves, Samurai Shodown 2, 3, 4, 5, The
6015500	6021940	Art of Fighting, World Heroes 2, World Heroes 2 Jet, World Heroes Perfect, Ninja Masters,
6021940	6025820	The Last Blade 2, and Kizuna Encounter.
6025820	6031020	And those are your games that are going to be a part of that fighting stick that is not
6031020	6034140	only a fighting stick for PC, but it also plugs into your TV.
6034140	6038940	The fact that it also works on PC is pretty rad, actually.
6038940	6041420	So like, I don't know, I'm on the fence.
6041420	6043420	It's probably too much money.
6043420	6048540	Yeah, I don't remember how much it costs, but I don't need a fighting stick.
6048540	6049780	I don't need one that bad.
6049780	6050780	So, alright.
6050780	6056900	And then, well this is kind of funny, there is a patch to Borderlands 3 that apparently
6056900	6066860	there was a problem where I guess one of the bosses in the game had some incessant screaming
6066860	6071260	that was patched out now because apparently there was too much.
6071260	6077060	And apparently, I don't know, so they had actually gone through the game.
6077060	6084780	I don't want to actually spoil too much here, but apparently towards the end of the game
6084780	6092500	one of the bosses, I guess, takes some damage and starts screaming and it's just, you know,
6092500	6097300	apparently it just keeps on going and so they wanted to fix some other stuff that was in
6097300	6102780	the game and with that they removed the pain sounds from Troy for his last boss fight because
6102780	6105100	apparently it was very unpleasant.
6105100	6111300	Well, I mean, if it was to the point where it was annoying, I can see, I mean I haven't
6111300	6116620	played this game yet, so, although I've been making my way through the first Borderlands
6116620	6121740	game, but it's just, of course, I put that down when all this other stuff came up, right?
6121740	6124340	But I'm sure a lot of people were very annoyed by that.
6124340	6126540	Anybody in chat, did you get this far in Borderlands 3?
6126540	6129060	At the very end, so it's like the last boss fight.
6129060	6131660	Probably nobody in our chat even was that far.
6131660	6137020	Apparently, I guess, if you do any sort of stats effect on him, he just screams constantly,
6137020	6139180	so that's actually kind of funny.
6139180	6144340	I kind of wish they didn't patch it out, but what are you going to do?
6144340	6145340	Yeah.
6145340	6146340	All right.
6146340	6148620	Well, moving on to some other stories.
6148620	6153340	This one is about some trademarks by Bandai Namco, which Jason referenced at the top of
6153340	6155220	the show tonight in the intro.
6155220	6156780	I think this is really cool.
6156780	6157780	So here's the thing.
6157780	6164260	Some new trademarks were filed with some games in the Encore series for Bandai Namco.
6164260	6168980	This is important because Bandai Namco already did this for a game in Japan.
6168980	6171500	It was called Katamari Damacy Encore.
6171500	6175460	It doesn't sound as familiar here to us because when they released it here, it was Katamari
6175460	6177660	Damacy Reroll.
6177660	6181740	There was also a puzzle game on the Nintendo Switch that was based on a Wii release.
6181740	6187180	I don't think we had it here called Kotoba No Puzzle Moji Pitan Encore.
6187180	6190940	So this Encore thing is something Bandai Namco has been doing.
6190940	6191940	Guess what?
6191940	6195100	There's more games apparently coming, thanks to these trademark filings.
6195100	6202580	Mr. Driller, Klonoa, which I know will have people very excited, Splatterhouse.
6202580	6205900	So that is all in a report that ran in Gamatsu.
6205900	6210220	Apparently Mr. Driller W was specifically the game there in the Encore line.
6210220	6212700	That was originally a WiiWare exclusive.
6212700	6222760	And apparently Klonoa's 2009 remake, Door to Phantomile is going to be the other game
6222760	6226280	potentially there in the Encore series.
6226280	6228440	So that's kind of neat.
6228440	6229820	We don't know about Splatterhouse.
6229820	6234680	It could be the 2010 reboot that was on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360.
6234680	6236380	Could be maybe the arcade version.
6236380	6237380	Don't know.
6237380	6239520	Hard to say at this point.
6239520	6245080	I think it should just be a blend of both Splatterhouse and Katamari where you're just
6245080	6248000	crushing things in violent gore.
6248000	6254000	All right, let's talk about that game Control that came out that I really want to play.
6254000	6257880	But Epic Games paid to have the exclusive rights on their store.
6257880	6260820	I just saw this one in Discord as well.
6260820	6267160	They paid about 9.49 million euros, which I think in Discord they had the American number
6267160	6274000	of about 10.5 US dollars, I think, to actually get the PC exclusive rights to Control.
6274000	6278640	This was paid out to Digital Brothers, which is the parent company, to 505 Games.
6278640	6283680	According to a recent financial report, that's how they were able to find out that number
6283680	6286960	because when you're a traded company, you have to publish reports to talk about your
6286960	6287960	income.
6287960	6291000	It just happened to be the timing of everything because the game hadn't released yet, but
6291000	6293320	they had the report earnings from it.
6293320	6296160	And so they're like, where did those earnings come from?
6296160	6299920	Oh, it was from the exclusivity deal.
6299920	6301360	Clever.
6301360	6302360	Very clever.
6302440	6305920	Now we know about how much Epic is willing to pony up for exclusive games.
6305920	6307440	That's a nice chunk of change.
6307440	6311440	Hey, Epic, I'm working on a game willing to make it exclusive.
6311440	6315680	You have to throw me some people really waiting to play this, too.
6315680	6319200	I'll take like a tenth of that.
6319200	6320200	You can lowball me.
6320200	6321200	It's fine.
6321200	6322200	Reach for the sky.
6322200	6323200	All right.
6323200	6327000	Let's travel around and check out what's coming out in stores this week as we check out world
6327000	6328000	release dates.
6328000	6329000	All right.

6333480	6338640	Baldur's Gate Siege of Dragonspear on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6338640	6342880	Baldur's Gate 2 enhanced edition also coming out on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and
6342880	6343880	Xbox One.
6343880	6345440	And I swear that's the last Baldur's Gate.
6345440	6351320	Oh, well, maybe not actually, because then we get down to Icewind Dale enhanced edition.
6351320	6353920	That's the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6353920	6358640	Landscape Torment enhanced edition on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6358640	6359640	All right.
6359640	6361600	I think we're good there.
6361600	6367960	Contra Rogue Corps on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6367960	6372680	The Surge 2 on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

6377520	6381920	Darksiders 2 definitive edition on Nintendo Switch.
6381920	6385360	I'm wearing a Mario Kart shirt, so I'll show that off.
6385360	6393720	Gunvolt Chronicles Luminous Avenger that's coming out on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation
6393720	6395680	4 and Xbox One.

6410560	6411560	this week.
6411560	6416600	FIFA 20 on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6416600	6422080	Memoria on PC, Mac, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One.
6422080	6424800	Ori and the Blind Forest on Nintendo Switch.
6424800	6428400	And last but not least, Tropico 6 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6428400	6429400	That's it.
6429400	6430400	Nice.
6430400	6431400	All right.
6431400	6433680	Traveling over to Japan and looking at the releases there.
6433680	6437880	They're also getting Ys IX this week, which is probably the biggest deal in the list.
6437880	6438880	But Ys IX.
6438880	6442960	Some of you think it might be Ys, because it's Y-S, but it's Ys.
6442960	6447280	So Ys IX, Monstrum Nox is out in Japan this week on the 26th.
6447280	6450700	There's an Atelier game out this week too, Atelier Ryza, Ever Darkness and the Secret
6450700	6451700	Hideout.
6451700	6455680	That's an irregular premium and special collector's box, because they love the collectibles over
6455680	6457040	there in Japan.
6457040	6461920	Gunvolt Chronicles Luminous Avenger IX also out in Japan this week.
6461920	6465640	MotoGP 19 gets a Japanese release this week as well.
6465640	6468080	And oh, there's a limited edition for Ys IX as well.
6468080	6469960	I didn't notice that at first.
6469960	6473280	There's also Contra Rogue Core is out in Japan this week.
6473280	6476840	MelKiss and I'm sorry, I love the name of this game.
6476840	6477840	You ready?
6477840	6479300	AmazingGrace.
6479300	6482400	What color is your attribute?
6482400	6484040	That's the name of the game, Loki.
6484040	6485120	AmazingGrace.
6485120	6487160	What color is your attribute?
6487160	6488160	What would you say?
6488160	6490520	What would you say is what color is your attribute, Loki?
6490520	6491520	I don't know.
6491520	6492520	What is that?
6492520	6493520	Some sort of slang?
6493520	6494520	Is that like...
6494520	6495520	I don't know.
6495520	6503920	Does your attribute match the drapes?
6503920	6507120	Loki's jokes have officially killed me.
6507120	6510480	All right, anyway.
6510480	6513920	Judging from the box art for this game, I would think maybe it's pink, because they're
6513920	6515960	all wearing little like...
6515960	6520980	It's for anime girls, of course, all wearing these like pink suits on the cover of the
6520980	6521980	game.
6521980	6522980	And I don't know.
6523220	6525340	Do you want to hear the description of AmazingGrace?
6525340	6526660	What color is your attribute?
6526660	6527660	Yes.
6527660	6531840	Shu woke up in a snowy town with no recollection of his past.
6531840	6535900	He thought it was a strange place with an antique feel of Europe in the Middle Ages
6535900	6538220	and a deep appreciation of the arts.
6538220	6542960	There was also a towering wall known as Aurora, which surrounded by the town and sealed it
6542960	6544100	off from the outside.
6544100	6549540	However, he was taken in by the townspeople and eventually attended St. Alia Academy and
6549540	6552060	enjoyed his time with the other students there.
6552060	6557740	However, this newfound happiness was snatched in an instant when a mysterious fire destroyed
6557740	6559260	the town on Christmas Day.
6559260	6562340	Well, that's a fucking bummer, isn't it?
6562340	6566420	Yune loved the town more than anyone and vowed from the bottom of her heart to change the
6566420	6571340	town's fate, turning back time to December the 2nd, the first day of Advent.
6571340	6573420	Why did the disaster occur?
6573420	6577620	Why did the town's fate remain unchanged no matter how many times they turned back time?
6577620	6581980	Why were they able to turn back time in the first place?
6581980	6585860	That description literally has nothing to do with the fucking title.
6585860	6587060	What color is your attribute?
6587060	6588600	The color of fire.
6588600	6593180	And we have to stop it, I guess, is what's going on there.
6593180	6597140	If I could turn back time.
6597140	6602340	I'm sorry I asked.
6602340	6605780	Going to the Nintendo Switch and checking out the releases there.
6605780	6612980	Ninja Box is out this week, as well as Hakuyoki Shinkai is out this week, as well as Atley
6612980	6617880	Arisa is also released there, and Gunvolt Chronicles Luminous Avenger.
6617880	6624260	There's also a game called Disaster Report 4 Plus Summer Memories for the Nintendo Switch
6624260	6626700	is also out this week.
6626700	6629580	I want to say, I think that was on the Wii at one point.
6629580	6631940	I had like the Disaster Report series.
6631940	6636120	It does, because it is a plus game, so it wouldn't surprise me if it's like a reimagining
6636120	6637120	of that series.
6637120	6638260	I don't know.
6638260	6643180	But anyhow, let's go over to Europe and see what the release dates are out there.
6643180	6652480	Alright, so in Europe we've got a few things, starting off with Songbird Symphony.
6652480	6654820	Let's see here.
6654820	6657380	Why did they not seem to know what the date is?
6657380	6658860	Oh, here we go.
6658860	6664220	Contra Rogue Corps, that's coming out on PlayStation 4 and the Nintendo Switch.
6664220	6668340	The Surge 2 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6668340	6673740	We have FIFA 20, that's coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6673740	6677900	Dead by Daylight on the Nintendo Switch.
6677900	6682300	Darksiders II Definitive Edition, that's on the Switch.
6682300	6685660	Telsiligrad, that's on the Switch.
6685660	6690700	Dragon Quest XI Echoes of an Elusive Age on Nintendo Switch.
6690700	6695820	FIFA 20, oh I said that again, but I guess they have a collector's edition coming out
6695820	6696820	as well.
6696820	6702740	Yes, the, what was it, the Definitive Edition or Champion's Edition.
6702740	6708180	You know, more of the, what was it, Ultimate Team Card Packs Edition is what they really
6708180	6709180	should call it.
6710060	6715420	And then Tropico 6, we've got that coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6715420	6719420	Code Vein on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6719420	6721700	And that is it.
6721700	6724060	All right.
6724060	6725500	Let's go to the mailbag.
6725500	6727860	Every week we invite your emails.
6727860	6732020	Participate at Orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send your emails.
6732020	6735900	And we dive into the mailbag and read your emails here on the program.
6735900	6739460	DarkSakura usually reads these emails, but since she isn't here specifically for the
6739460	6743700	purpose of saving her voice, I suppose I will have to read them instead.
6743700	6748700	So we have two emails in the mailbag this week, but this first one, Loki, uh oh, I think
6748700	6753900	this is from the, uh, Wasterbaiting account again, because the first one is from The Virus
6753900	6754900	Developer.
6754900	6755900	Oh my gosh.
6755900	6760220	And the subject is, my virus recorded you masturbating.
6760220	6761580	No.
6761580	6763620	I feel- Again?
6763620	6768860	I feel sorry for your virus because nobody should have to be subjected to that.
6768860	6769860	I'm trying to see what's actually-
6769860	6773500	Like I'm seeking damages for you and harming my virus.
6773500	6777180	Recently you visited one of the porn websites I attacked with my ex-plate.
6777180	6778180	Oh my God.
6778180	6781060	This, okay, this gets really serious.
6781060	6785460	Like I, I wouldn't usually give spam emails the time of day.
6785460	6786460	It's Worldcraft.
6786460	6789340	There's, there's a tone in this email.
6789340	6790340	World building is-
6790340	6791700	No, wait, wait, here we go.
6791700	6795020	So when you started watching videos, it executed payload on your device.
6795020	6797480	So that's what you get for not sticking with the payload.
6797480	6799820	Now it's on your device.
6799820	6803740	As soon as I infected your device, it started to act like a remote desktop with full read-write
6803740	6804740	access.
6804740	6809340	Uh, your camera, my virus started recording your web browser and your camera every time
6809340	6811980	you masturbated during the last two weeks.
6811980	6817060	While my virus is not perfect.
6817060	6818320	How humble they are.
6818320	6820740	What a humble, what a humble virus.
6820740	6828340	While my virus is not perfect, it managed to record six videos clearly showing you masturbating.
6828340	6834700	Call me whatever you want, a criminal or a dick, but this is just my job.
6834700	6835860	It's it's-
6835860	6839580	I'm employed to make viruses that watch you masturbate.
6839580	6840580	That's-
6840580	6846180	Oh God, we got Rob masturbating on video again.
6846180	6847660	Well, it's a living.
6847660	6850420	Yours is waster baiting in and out.
6850420	6851420	Okay.
6851420	6852420	Yeah.
6852420	6855900	SSG100 Matt says this storyline sounds better than what colors your attribute.
6855900	6857860	Wait folks, it gets better.
6857860	6861100	I'm just, I'm just reading an email in the box cause this shit gets crazy.
6861100	6862100	You ready?
6862100	6864700	Uh, call me what you want, a criminal or a dick, but this is just my job.
6864700	6871380	I do this on a regular basis and I recorded hundreds of people, but you are special in
6871380	6873740	all caps.
6873740	6875420	You're special.
6875420	6876620	Why?
6876620	6881660	Because of the apparent and perverse videos you were watching while masturbating.
6881660	6883060	You know what I mean?
6883060	6887620	Now I am your master and you are my slave.
6887620	6889420	This is just taking over.
6889420	6894060	I did not consent to this role play virus, master Jesus.
6894060	6895060	All right.
6895060	6896060	Thank you.
6896060	6897060	Oh yeah.
6897060	6903740	I'm so happy we get raided by another esteemed podcast network while I'm in the middle of
6903740	6910660	reading the spam email we got to our box that is threatening to spread our masturbating
6910660	6912060	videos all over the internet.
6912060	6921660	So come on, come on in, pull up a chair or as our emailer said, now I am your master.
6921660	6922740	Let's see where were we at?
6922740	6924300	Oh, let me ask you a question.
6924300	6925900	The email continues.
6925900	6930860	How would you feel if I uploaded a porn hub, all the videos with you masturbating and send
6930860	6936300	the links to everyone on your contact list, including your family and business partners?
6936300	6937860	You don't want me to do this, right?
6937860	6941900	There is only one way you can stop me from exposing your fantasies.
6941900	6945700	I talk about my fantasies very openly.
6945700	6946700	You're on this program.
6946700	6947700	Subscribe to PewDiePie.
6947700	6948700	Ryan Reynolds.
6948700	6951140	And actually we were not going to talk about that.
6951140	6952740	Anyway, moving on.
6952740	6953960	You have to pay.
6953960	6955840	Let me be straightforward with you.
6955840	6957580	You know what Bitcoin is, right?
6957580	6963820	Buy $2,000 worth of Bitcoin and send to me immediately.
6963820	6967120	You can buy Bitcoin in many places like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, I'm not going to read
6967120	6968120	these websites.
6968120	6972900	I'm giving you three days to complete this payment after which I will start uploading
6972900	6975140	and sending your masturbation videos.
6975140	6978580	Just imagine your family and colleagues reaction to these videos.
6978580	6985620	Save your life now.
6985620	6986940	I have three days, huh?
6987300	6988300	Well, guess what, y'all?
6988300	6991420	That email was sent on Monday.
6991420	6993340	Have fun on Pornhub.
6993340	6994340	Sick bucks.
6994340	6995340	All right.
6995340	6996340	Let's get to the real email.
6996340	7000020	By the way, welcome to all the new viewers here at Orange Town Studio.
7000020	7001460	We're a video game podcast.
7001460	7002460	Did you know that?
7002460	7004880	We talk about video games once in a while.
7004880	7010020	But then once in this blue moon, we get like the crazy masturbating email spammer thing
7010020	7011020	here.
7011020	7012020	All right.
7012020	7015780	Anyway, moving on.
7015780	7018540	I'm loving all the comments we're getting.
7018540	7023660	Havoc978 says, this is literally more detailed than any versions of the email I've gotten.
7023660	7025180	That's why I had to read it.
7025180	7029020	It was much more like the urgency and the tone in that email.
7029020	7032780	I was like, I have to like, this person has a message.
7032780	7034820	It's their job, Loki.
7034820	7035820	It's my job.
7035820	7037180	It's a living.
7037180	7043100	I've recorded hundreds of people, but you, you're special.
7043100	7046100	WBin26 in chat says, spam them back.
7046100	7050200	I just, I feel like you don't want to let them know that somebody's actually reading
7050200	7054820	the emails live on the internet to a captive audience of dozens of people, because then
7054820	7056400	they'll just invite to send me more.
7056400	7058780	So I don't really want to do that.
7058780	7060780	Pesalpaca says, that was beautiful.
7060780	7061780	Thank you.
7061780	7068140	Nicole0991 says, as a girl, I'm amused by the amount of these kinds of emails I've received.
7068140	7071100	Will you notice the tone in that email had no gender?
7071100	7074700	You know, gender is merely a suggestion in the year 2019.
7074700	7081020	So the virus developer whose virus will record you masturbating cares not of what parts you're
7081020	7082720	using to masturbate.
7082720	7085580	They just want you to know it's their job.
7085580	7086580	And that you're special.
7086580	7087580	And that you're special.
7087580	7088580	All right.
7088580	7091740	Anyway, can we get to the real email?
7091740	7097580	I guess now everybody in chat is like, all right, we have to talk about games.
7097580	7099060	Pretty high bar you have to live up to.
7099060	7100060	All right.
7100060	7101060	Well, luckily it's Flaco Jones.
7101060	7102060	Okay.
7102060	7107140	And if anybody can follow up the virus master or whatever his name was, the Flaco Jones,
7107140	7108140	I'm sure, sure can.
7108140	7109140	So here we go.
7109140	7114460	Hey, OLR, a couple of weeks ago, you mentioned a story about Konami bringing back globally
7114460	7119020	known IPs and went on to discuss whether that could mean a new Metal Gear game or something
7119020	7120780	big along those lines.
7120780	7124480	Well fast forward to the Apple keynote from last week when they brought a rep from Konami
7124480	7129100	on stage and what did they announce but a new Frogger game exclusive to the Apple Arcade
7129100	7133140	service joy.
7133140	7137380	I about died laughing in part because I thought of your discussion on the show the previous
7137380	7143700	week where we were sitting here, you know, that's, that's what the virus guy got is he
7143700	7148860	saw us here with our wank about, Ooh, it's going to be Castlevania or it could be something
7148860	7153180	like the Winx Club coming back, but no, it's gotta be fucking Frogger.
7153180	7154180	That's what that guy recorded.
7154180	7157220	And you know how much I love when they have new Frogger announcements.
7157220	7158220	I know.
7158220	7159220	Weren't you excited about Frogger?
7159220	7160220	Oh yeah.
7160220	7161220	All right.
7161220	7166500	Anyway, uh, let's see where was I did it, but also the last time Konami tried to bring
7166500	7170920	back Frogger was when I worked there as a tester and the Frogger games they were making
7170920	7173500	were complete garbage.
7173500	7174500	Spoiler alert.
7174500	7178660	Now, I haven't been on Apple Arcade myself, but if I'm to believe what my friends are
7178660	7182140	saying about the new Frogger game, guess what?
7182140	7184500	There's still garbage.
7184500	7186900	How do you make, how do you make Frogger garbage?
7186900	7191340	I mean, you, you have a game that like knocked it off, you know, in Crossy Roads.
7191340	7192940	Do your kids play the Frogger games?
7192940	7194260	Cause I bet they don't care.
7194260	7195740	I think that's what it boils down to.
7195740	7198220	They don't play Frogger at all, but they play Crossy Roads.
7198220	7199220	Interesting.
7199220	7200220	They love Crossy Roads.
7200220	7205300	Well, I remember when they, when they redid Frogger on the PlayStation one, it was kind
7205300	7207180	of like, Whoa, this is different.
7207180	7208180	Right?
7208180	7210180	Cause like Frogger in the arcade was kind of basic as hell.
7210180	7211180	Right.
7211180	7212180	It was just like, you know, don't get me wrong.
7212180	7213180	It was a great game for what?
7213180	7214420	1983 or whenever that came out.
7214420	7215420	But you know, you're going to bloop, bloop, bloop.
7215940	7216940	You're just going up to the top of the screen.
7216940	7217940	It's kind of basic.
7217940	7218940	Right.
7218940	7222260	But like, then it was like, Holy shit on the PlayStation.
7222260	7227500	Now Frogger can go four different directions and like the levels are like mazes and stuff.
7227500	7230020	They're not like, it was kind of like a whole new thing.
7230020	7234540	And when they sold oodles and oodles of that game, now Konami was like, Oh shit, we just
7234540	7235960	found the formula for success.
7235960	7238780	We have to repeat that formula every single time.
7238780	7243060	And now here we are in the year 2019 and they're still making Frogger on the PlayStation one
7243060	7244060	for Apple arcade.
7245060	7246060	Better graphics.
7246060	7247060	Yeah.
7247060	7248060	Yeah.
7248060	7249060	But apparently it doesn't run very well.
7249060	7250060	It seems like it's very poorly.
7250060	7253820	Apparently it was a highlight because they have the showed off during the keynote.
7253820	7257700	Kaijuto in chat says, I want to combine Frogger with Grand Theft Auto.
7257700	7259180	Well, you know what?
7259180	7265980	Konami just, I don't think they understand this concept of like, you know, make it 2019
7265980	7268540	Sonic two bonus level, but make it 2019.
7268540	7271100	Like I just, I just don't see Konami able to do that.
7271100	7273500	Frogger, but battle royale is pretty good.
7273940	7274940	What?
7274940	7278500	Frogger, but battle royale.
7278500	7279940	How would you make Frogger royale?
7279940	7281140	I don't know.
7281140	7284220	One frog and 99 people driving a car.
7284220	7285220	There.
7285220	7286220	Okay.
7286220	7288220	Maybe not battle royale.
7288220	7289220	Okay.
7289220	7290980	I like, I like where we're going with this.
7290980	7292360	Let's game design.
7292360	7296820	How about instead of the battle royale formula, how about the evolve formula?
7296820	7298220	The four versus one, right?
7298220	7299740	Cause those games are super in right now.
7299740	7300740	Right?
7300740	7301740	Dead by daylight.
7301740	7302740	All that, all that shit's huge.
7302980	7308900	So how about one person is the frog and the others are the cars and the other methods
7308900	7311020	to try to kill Frogger.
7311020	7312600	Would y'all play that game?
7312600	7313860	Quick poll in chat.
7313860	7315940	Would you play, what do we call the game?
7315940	7318340	I don't know.
7318340	7321360	Frogger survivor, Frogger survive.
7321360	7322740	One word titles are in right now.
7322740	7323740	Right?
7323740	7324740	Frog, Frogger survive.
7324740	7325940	Would you play frog survive?
7325940	7327020	Let's see.
7327020	7328020	Looking in chat.
7328020	7329820	Havok978 says, ship it.
7329820	7331320	Dr. Sia says, sure.
7331320	7333280	Bobby Blackwool says, somebody should be an alligator.
7333280	7334920	Well, you should get to pick.
7334920	7336520	You should get, do you want to be the car?
7336520	7340220	Do you want to be, uh, do you want to be one of those logs that sinks into the water every
7340220	7341220	now and then?
7341220	7342220	Uh, do you want to be an alligator?
7342220	7343720	Like what do you want to do?
7343720	7349520	Uh, Dr. Sia says, Frogger survive, but use the same survive from that metal gear solid
7349520	7350520	spinoff.
7350520	7353960	Oh, uh, quiet could be in it for no particular reason.
7353960	7359520	Or frog dressed up like quiet.
7359520	7361400	Let's reskin the whole thing.
7361400	7364240	Yeah, well I got it.
7364240	7366800	Like cause we can't really come up with a unique idea.
7366800	7372800	Let's just take Melgasol five, we'll reskin it as Frogger and just rerelease that.
7372800	7376240	Bobby Blackwool says, Norman Reedus is the frog.
7376240	7378440	I like it.
7378440	7379440	Okay.
7379440	7380440	Uh, where were we?
7380440	7383440	I was, this, this was a Flaco Jones email at one point.
7383440	7384960	Um, Oh yes.
7384960	7387360	Surprised you didn't bring this up on last week's show.
7387360	7390400	There was a pretty packed news week, so it makes sense.
7390400	7394120	Flaco, let me tell you a little bit about my thought process when I'm constructing the
7394120	7395960	show role for orange launch radio.
7395960	7400160	I see a story about Frogger and I think, Hmm, I really don't give a shit.
7400160	7402920	And I move on to the next thing on the list.
7402920	7407440	Now this week was a little bit of a slower news week, so it might've made the cut this
7407440	7410520	week, but obviously, but you know what?
7410520	7413160	We, we work for our listeners.
7413160	7417240	So when you guys are saying, this is what you want to talk about Flaco is like, Hey,
7417240	7421480	well then talk about Frogger and Anita, you would have never had Frogger survive.
7421480	7425920	And this concept we're going to make millions off of if, which by the way, Konami, we own
7425920	7426920	that idea.
7426920	7430040	Now Frogger survive is ours and, uh, you patent pending, right?
7430040	7432480	That's how you ensure patent pending.
7432480	7433480	So there it is.
7433480	7434480	All right.
7434480	7439840	Uh, pod culture is says playing Frogger now it sucks.
7439840	7442920	Bobby Blackwool says, Jeff Keeley is the girlfriend.
7442920	7443920	Wasn't there?
7443920	7449040	Was a lady frog that would sometimes be on the, the, or there was a lady frog on the
7449040	7450940	log that you would pick up on your way.
7450940	7452520	So yes, Jeff Keeley can be the lady frog.
7452520	7453520	Uh, and that's true.
7453520	7457040	And her mat says Nolan North as the voice of frog number one, you guys are doing really
7457040	7459840	man Questbuster says Troy Baker is the red car.
7459840	7460960	We're going to start a game company.
7460960	7461960	You guys.
7461960	7462960	All right.
7462960	7463960	Where were we?
7463960	7464960	Oh yes.
7464960	7465960	Flaco's email.
7465960	7470080	Um, that just really got me laughing and thinking about old times at Konami QA.
7470080	7472160	Well, I hope we give you a laugh here too.
7472160	7473680	Have a great rest of your stream.
7473680	7474680	We'll try.
7474680	7475680	Uh, thanks.
7475680	7476680	Flaco Jones.
7476680	7477680	PS.
7477680	7480420	Here's the link to the keynote where the Konami brand manager comes on stage.
7480420	7483760	It's just a short two minute clip and the game does not look great.
7483760	7484760	Uh, yeah.
7484760	7487880	One of my friends was talking about it online and I was like, yeah, I'm looking at it right
7487880	7492980	now and it's like, it's sorry if I don't rip the video beforehand, I can't just put it
7492980	7493980	on stream.
7493980	7497960	So, um, for those of you guys that were joining us from the giant size team up rate, hello
7497960	7501440	by the way, and welcome to orange launch radio here at the voice of geeks network.
7502160	7505120	We're totally a show about video games and we take ourselves very seriously.
7505120	7508160	This is a very fine craft that we do here, just so you know.
7508160	7512760	Um, but also since we're very low budget operation, if I didn't grab the video before we started,
7512760	7513760	then I can't put it on air.
7513760	7516360	So, uh, and I forgot to grab this one tonight.
7516360	7517360	So yeah.
7517360	7518360	It looks really lame.
7518360	7519360	Yeah.
7519360	7520360	It does kind of look lame.
7520360	7521360	That's all you need to know.
7521360	7522360	It looks lame.
7522360	7523360	All right.
7523360	7524360	Uh, that's it for the emails.
7524360	7527560	If you want to send us an email in a future week, participate at orange launch radio.com
7527560	7532640	is the place to send your emails for consideration for reading here on air.
7532640	7534320	Let's get to our next story.
7534320	7535320	Loki.
7535320	7536320	All right.
7536320	7539200	I got to close my Frogger video here, which why is he eating jelly beans?
7539200	7541980	It doesn't make any sense, whatever.
7541980	7545300	So red dead online, apparently red dead online.
7545300	7550140	There may be some teasing going on, um, regarding a possible update soon.
7550140	7556320	So apparently people have been spotting whether it's part of a glitch or not, uh, NPCs that
7556320	7561300	sort of look zombie like, um, they have like a screenshot.
7561300	7567240	For example, this old woman who has clearly a zombie face and kind of dead eyes.
7567240	7574600	Could this possibly be a hint at an undead nightmare type DLC or red dead online type
7574600	7577160	of event that's going to go on?
7577160	7583240	I'm guessing yes, because this is too obvious and too easy of an way for them to get money.
7583240	7587600	So it makes sense that this is going to be a thing that they'll probably do, especially
7587600	7589320	since Halloween is right around the corner.
7589320	7593080	Now earlier in the show, we kind of talked about how some companies like EA are really,
7593080	7595240	you know, nickel and timing the crap out of things.
7595240	7599340	And you know, why aren't people just charging the real cost for games and so forth?
7599340	7603280	But I feel like when it comes to like rock star in some ways, are you, where do you,
7603280	7604600	how do you feel about this?
7604600	7612480	Well, red dead, like I feel that they do kind of, they take the whole like online portion
7612520	7613520	of it.
7613520	7617120	So there are games as a service model for like the online, Grand Theft Auto online.
7617120	7622880	There's tons of updates for it, but they do like nickel and dime stuff on there a ton.
7622880	7628880	Like they're really trying to push those shark cards in red dead redemption to the red dead
7628880	7633960	online, which I never actually played, but I heard enough of it where it's kind of even
7633960	7638340	worse where they nickel and dime stuff in there, but they do a lot of content as well.
7638340	7645060	So it's kind of, it's hard to say whether or not that's, you know, something that people
7645060	7649700	are interested in, but I don't feel so cheated necessarily by Grand Theft Auto five and rather
7649700	7653280	redemption too, because the single player campaigns for those are fucking amazing.
7653280	7657100	Like they're just great games by themselves and you're getting that for $60.
7657100	7660260	This online portion is above and beyond that.
7660260	7665000	So that's kind of like, I could see them treating it like their DLC because they don't do single
7665000	7669040	player DLC anymore for the Grand Theft Auto games or red dead redemption.
7669040	7672040	It's all in online, which that's fine.
7672040	7675400	That makes sense because you're, you know, hosting this whole other game.
7675400	7679680	So you're like, okay with it because there's the single player, which is fully featured,
7679680	7680680	fully functional for $60.
7680680	7685160	But then like this multiplayer is like something extra, you know, to be fair to EA, that used
7685160	7688000	to be the way it was when they first dipped their toe in all this stuff with like Mass
7688000	7691840	Effect multiplayer, which I loved like, and even though Mass Effect multiplayer, when
7691840	7696280	they put that in Mass Effect 3 got a lot of pushback and, and, um, you know, shit for
7696280	7699720	just being a money grab or whatever they're calling it at the time, I actually kind of
7699720	7703480	loved it because Mass Effect 3 as a standalone game was great.
7703480	7708280	You know, I even liked it before they did all the patches, whatever fight me.
7708280	7712560	But when they did the multiplayer stuff on top of that, like I really enjoyed that.
7712560	7715840	And the loot box stuff didn't feel so mandatory.
7715840	7720720	You really could grind your way to free loot boxes at a non obscene pace.
7720720	7723120	Yeah. Like for example, like we want to go back to that server.
7723120	7726200	We're talking about how like companies abuse stuff like that.
7726200	7734560	Um, look at Activision where they pay walled a call of duty, um, modern warfare remastered
7734560	7739480	behind having the purchase call of duty, infinite warfare.
7739480	7744960	And on top of that, that it's a remaster you would think, oh, it's going to be remastered
7744960	7745960	all the content in there.
7745960	7746960	Additional things.
7746960	7747960	No, no.
7747960	7752040	The DLC pack that they had in call of duty four, they're going to resell that to you.
7752040	7755880	Oh, and they're selling it to you for more than what it was originally in the original
7755880	7756880	game.
7756880	7760960	Oh, and we're adding loot boxes that no one ever wanted into the game as well.
7760960	7762120	That is what I'm talking about.
7762120	7766080	Like taking it to an extreme because they know they can get money and so they're going
7766080	7767640	to get all of the money is what they want.
7767640	7768640	All right.
7768640	7769920	Just wanted to mention the other rockstar related.
7769920	7770920	Yes.
7770920	7774640	So I was going to say that they're also, cause this is also something that people really
7774640	7779600	want is they're rolling out their own PC games launcher.
7779600	7782240	Why, why do we need to do this?
7782240	7786000	But apparently they have their own games launcher on PC.
7786000	7790160	If you own any rockstar titles, you can launch them all in one place.
7790160	7794680	I think these are more of the ones that you purchase actually through like their game.
7794680	7799040	Like they have like my grand theft auto five copy for example, is not through steam.
7799040	7802840	It's actually just through like, I don't even remember where it's through.
7802840	7804640	I think it was a box copy in it.
7804640	7808480	You redeem it through the rockstar social club, I want to say at one time.
7808480	7811320	So I guess this is just a launcher that ties in with that.
7811320	7815240	And apparently if you install the launcher, you can also claim a free copy of grand theft
7815240	7816240	auto San Andreas.
7816240	7817240	Oh wow.
7817240	7822580	Um, so that's a good way to get me to install it on my computer, offer me a pretty solid
7822580	7823580	free game.
7823580	7824580	Yeah.
7824580	7830000	I don't know if they're suggesting that, um, maybe that red dead redemption twos come into
7830000	7832800	PC as well or what, but it's about that time.
7832800	7833760	Right?
7833760	7836760	Doesn't red dead, or I'm sorry, don't like rockstar games usually show up about a year
7836760	7837760	later on PC.
7837760	7840760	Um, sometimes I don't, they're less worried about the piracy.
7840760	7841760	Yeah.
7841760	7846680	I don't know if, I don't know if it was going to get that pirated, I guess it would, but
7846680	7849720	I think times have changed with that kind of times have changed with that kind of stuff
7849720	7850720	too.
7850720	7853240	But for whatever reason, rockstar is still kind of on that pattern, but yeah, you can
7853240	7857120	get this launcher, I guess if you want, I'm not gonna pick it up because I already have
7857120	7862180	grand theft auto San Andreas on steam and I don't need another copy of it.
7862180	7867900	And also because I have grand theft five standalone launcher and I honestly haven't played that
7867900	7868900	in months.
7868900	7871740	Is this a case of too many launchers out there available?
7871740	7874980	It is, but I don't really get bent out of shape about that stuff so much.
7874980	7878620	I mean, I just take them out of my like auto startup thing.
7878620	7882260	Like I say, no, you can't start up unless I, so I just take them all out of my store.
7882260	7884940	Like with Epic, like for example, like they've been offering free games.
7884940	7888700	So like they have had like this week they have the Batman games free because of the
7888700	7891280	whole tie in with the Fortnite stuff.
7891280	7896760	So you can get the Lego Batman one, two and three and then Batman Arkham, the Arkham city
7896760	7901380	night and asylum, I think all free as well.
7901380	7905920	So I added those to my queue even though I have them already on other platforms and then
7905920	7910920	my kid, I was like, Hey, I'm like, let's add Lego Batman because you may want to play that
7910920	7915200	Sunday even if you don't, I didn't even think I put the Batman Arkham stuff in there too.
7915200	7916200	Ah, you'll play it Sunday.
7916200	7917200	It's fine.
7917200	7918200	It's free.
7918200	7919200	Put it in your library.
7919200	7920560	Who cares if you don't want it, it doesn't matter.
7920840	7921840	Let's put it in there.
7921840	7922840	Well, funny you bring that up.
7922840	7923840	Cause I think we're going to come back to that.
7923840	7924840	Oh, sorry.
7924840	7925840	I real stories.
7925840	7926840	Oh, you're fine.
7926840	7927840	It's spoiler alert.
7927840	7928840	Oh my God.
7928840	7931200	Anyway, I do want to read some comments in our chat over Twitch TV slash vog network,
7931200	7932200	VOG network.
7932200	7936520	Cause you just says I got a free copy of grand theft auto, San Andreas, San Andreas is worth
7936520	7937520	it.
7937520	7940680	If you want to see how they got the idea for grand theft auto five online grand theft auto
7940680	7945320	San Andreas has an online mod that works a lot like GTA five online, but you can be a
7945320	7946320	cop in it.
7946320	7947320	It's dope.
7947320	7948320	So yeah.
7948320	7949320	Yeah.
7949320	7952880	You see a lot of the roots of where the games is now in the early.
7952880	7953880	Yeah.
7953880	7954880	Don't get me wrong.
7954880	7957320	I don't like what they've done necessarily with grand theft auto online and how like
7957320	7962000	it's just such a money grab and same with red dead online.
7962000	7965000	But with that said, I am there day one when grand theft auto six comes out.
7965000	7967000	So I don't give a shit about any of that.
7967000	7968000	All right.
7968000	7971240	Well, speaking of going back to your roots, uh, this next story we're going to talk about
7971240	7976320	is a music game story and our voiceover guy, Jason brought this to my attention cause I'm
7976320	7980560	a little bit out of the loop on music game news these days, but this one does look pretty
7980560	7981560	cool.
7981560	7982560	I actually have video of it.
7982560	7983560	You ready?
7983560	7985600	I don't know if I, I don't know if I am pronouncing the name of this game, right?
7985600	7986600	I'm sorry.
7986600	7987600	I'm going to call it Waka.
7987600	7993640	It's w a C. Well, I'm thinking Waka, Waka, you know, the old DDR, like Fossey bear Waka,
7993640	7994640	Waka, Waka.
7994640	7998240	I, I, yeah, I'm thinking it's Waka, but that's what, that's what I'm sticking to it, but
7998240	7999240	here's what it looks like.
7999240	8002000	Uh, for those of you that are watching on Twitch, for those of you that are on the podcast
8002000	8005240	feed, uh, at least you can kind of hear what the game sounds like a little bit, but it's
8005240	8008120	got a really neat little kind of neon look to it, huh?
8008120	8016000	Uh, this is from red Alice's hardcore label, hardcore Tano C. This is the new arcade game.
8016000	8018840	It is showing up at round ones around the world.
8018840	8022560	Um, you might be able to find it at Sega arcades in Japan as well.
8022560	8028240	Um, but, um, I don't think we really have to say I saw, um, someone had posted that
8028240	8032760	there's, okay, there's a game very similar also has an old look like this because they
8032760	8035560	had it at dragon con and I've seen it in arcades.
8035560	8038960	So this is actually like the second, what they call, I love this washing machine looking
8038960	8039960	game.
8039960	8043120	Well, there was one that like they showed it was like a Dave and busters, I think in
8043120	8045160	a run at park or something like that.
8045160	8046160	Yeah.
8046160	8050280	But look at this guy is wearing gloves when he plays, which actually considering how many
8050280	8053880	people touch that machine and kids that pick their nose and probably put their hands all
8053880	8054880	over the pretty lights.
8054880	8056400	Um, I don't blame them at all.
8056400	8059160	Um, but yeah, this, it looks fun, doesn't it?
8059160	8062680	So for those watching on the, excuse me, listening on the podcast feed, basically these notes
8062680	8065720	kind of go around the circle and the guy, it's like tempest the music game.
8065720	8066720	Yeah.
8066720	8067720	Oh my God.
8067720	8068720	That's a great way to describe it.
8068720	8069720	It's tempest the music game.
8069720	8070720	That is exactly what it is.
8070720	8071720	That's great.
8071720	8078600	Um, man, I remember when red Alice was just like, we'd see just a BMS files back in, you
8078600	8086400	know, the PC beat mania SIM days and now it's like spun off into like actual music games
8086400	8087800	and crazy.
8087800	8092400	As Jason describes this, uh, you tap and hold or swipe or draw.
8092400	8098560	Um, and when you do that, you can swipe clockwise or counterclockwise, you swipe in, swipe out,
8098560	8104880	uh, and all with a degree of accuracy from which, uh, you can go like not so great to
8104880	8105880	really, really tight.
8105880	8108440	Um, the entire ring is touch sensitive.
8108440	8112420	So the top, the bottom everywhere, it's a very expressive game with lots of vocal Lloyd
8112420	8116840	and Tano C songs as seen in other music games, some new to music game ones.
8116880	8121720	And of course, Tano C artists exclusives, uh, Jason says it's a super fun game.
8121720	8128480	And my, my is the name of the other game that's kind of like a, uh, a washing machine or dryer
8128480	8129480	shape sort of thing.
8129480	8131480	So yeah, it looks really fun.
8131480	8133120	Like I just want to check that out.
8133120	8138800	Uh, they opened like another round one, uh, the one in Hayward, I think I'm anticipating
8138800	8141800	I'm like there, you know, on the windows or they don't have a window.
8141800	8143800	There is the door.
8144760	8150060	Um, some comments in our chat, uh, Shane says gloves are necessary for these types of games.
8150060	8151680	Learn that the hard and painful way.
8151680	8153400	When I was in Japan, good point.
8153400	8158320	A lot more people probably go prepared to these types of arcades to like, you know,
8158320	8161400	really like play and do well at these songs.
8161400	8165120	And some people around one, when I've been to those arcades are, you know, they get into
8165120	8166120	it, they're prepared.
8166120	8168900	If they're playing DDR, they've got their, like, like they're going to the gym, they've
8168900	8173200	got their water bottle and their little, you know, cloth to pat down all the sweat, which
8173200	8174320	is a nice thing to do.
8174320	8175800	That's just, it's a necessity.
8175800	8177320	Yeah, it really is.
8177320	8181320	So a dark to see it says, Oh yeah, a lot of the, my, my vids, uh, I've seen they wear
8181320	8182320	gloves.
8182320	8183960	Um, I hope I'm saying this name right.
8183960	8184960	Sorry if I'm not.
8184960	8189000	Thour six, six says, this guy makes it look easy, but maybe it's not.
8189000	8192760	It's probably like a lot of music games where it's a learning curve, right?
8192760	8194840	You get used to reading it more and more.
8194840	8198680	The more you play, like imagine the first time you played dance, dance revolution, if
8198680	8201760	you ever did play dance, dance revolution, you know, it's really like you would not
8201760	8204260	be able to do the hardest songs in that game right off the bat.
8204260	8206500	You've got to learn like, Oh, the arrow hit the top.
8206500	8209080	You kind of are learning to read the note chart.
8209080	8213800	And that game is similar to, it takes a lot of practice is basically what it boils down
8213800	8214800	to.
8214800	8218480	And I used to be good at games like we'd be in a two DX, but since I haven't played
8218480	8223520	in so long, if I had to play them now, yikes, uh, that were also, we'll follow set up with
8223520	8224520	another question.
8224520	8225640	What happens when you goof?
8225640	8227640	Usually you probably saw the combo ticking up there.
8227640	8230080	Let me run the B roll again real quick here.
8230080	8235280	You'll notice as the person plays, um, there's a combo that kind of ticks up as they are
8235280	8236280	doing the notes.
8236280	8238000	You can see it's like 10, 11, 12, 16, 19.
8238000	8239920	So as they're hitting all the notes, this combo goes up.
8239920	8244880	If this player were to screw up, that combo would break, which I mean, big deal, right?
8244880	8250360	But if you mess up too many notes, usually the song will fail and you will, you know,
8250360	8251360	you basically you lose.
8251360	8254800	But I also like the little things that comes over the top bonus get and that whole type
8254800	8255800	of thing.
8255800	8257360	So a really cute how they have that whole thing.
8257640	8260960	But of course if you want a high score, which is what this is all about, then you want to
8260960	8263560	try to make sure you get the highest combo if possible.
8263560	8266480	People really like to brag when they get full combos and things like that.
8266480	8267480	Yeah.
8267480	8268760	So that's what that's all about.
8268760	8270560	So a Waka looks pretty cool.
8270560	8274680	I can't wait to go to a round one and check this out for myself.
8274680	8277680	Meanwhile, Loki, um, you alluded to this a little bit ago.
8277680	8278680	Yeah.
8278680	8282600	So as I mentioned, there's free stuff on Epic game store right now for Batman.
8282840	8288520	Um, and of course all that stuff is tying in with a, um, I don't know if it's the new
8288520	8289520	season.
8289520	8294520	I assume it's a new season for Batman or a Fortnite that they're doing a crossover Batman
8294520	8301440	right now, uh, through and from now through October 6th and you basically can buy different
8301440	8307380	things including a cosmetics there from the comic book and movies.
8307380	8312980	So they have, you can get a Cape, um, you can buy a Cape Crusader pack and also they've
8312980	8315820	got different weapons, new gliders.
8315820	8321700	Um, so some of the gear that they're going to offer, a grapple gun that allows you to
8321700	8330200	be able to, uh, kind of, you know, fly through the air, the explosive batarangs and yeah.
8330200	8335880	So they'll have those, uh, you can earn like a cat wing glider as well, Batman themed imagery
8335880	8337220	and other fun stuff.
8337220	8342180	So that's going on between now and this, uh, the six admittedly, I don't play a lot of
8342180	8344340	Fortnite, but I really do like Batman stuff.
8344340	8345860	So I almost kind of want to check it out.
8345860	8346860	Is that weird?
8346860	8347860	It's free.
8347860	8351180	I picked it and I, you know, I picked up that Arkham trilogy on, uh, the Epic store too.
8351180	8354060	I was like, dang, I was like, cause they, they were showing the little teaser and I
8354060	8356300	was like, what are they going to, are they going to give away the whole trilogy?
8356300	8357300	What are they giving away?
8357300	8360820	And sure enough, they're giving away like a ton of Batman games, but to make hype for
8360820	8361820	their Fortnite thing.
8361820	8362820	Yeah.
8362820	8364220	Trilogy and uh, the Lego stuff too.
8364220	8367220	Wait, Fortnite's making oodles of cash for Epic.
8367220	8371760	They can pay $10 million to have control, be exclusive, they can give away these Batman
8371760	8372760	games.
8372760	8373760	It's pretty crazy.
8373760	8374760	Yeah.
8374760	8375760	Oh no.
8375760	8376760	Does it have all the DLC?
8376760	8378220	Maybe that's another thing too.
8378220	8381180	Sometimes they'll give away games, but you still have to buy the DLC or buy the extra
8381180	8382180	stuff.
8382180	8383180	I don't know.
8383180	8384820	I don't know either, but it was, I think it was like the Arkham collection.
8384820	8386600	So maybe it does have all the DLC in it.
8386600	8388580	Maybe somebody in chat can clarify that for us over at TwitchTV.
8388580	8389580	I mean I could look, I guess.
8389580	8391940	FlashVog network if you've played, I don't know.
8391940	8396500	Um, so, uh, but you mentioned the kids were checking out the Lego Batman stuff.
8396500	8400980	Well, I just downloaded it for them cause they liked Lego Batman 2 at one point cause
8400980	8404260	that was the one that was more open, like more open world.
8404260	8410180	Um, so the, yeah, the Batman Arkham Asylum and Arkham City are the game of the year editions.
8410180	8414180	Arkham Knight doesn't state that it's the game of the year edition, so I assume, I don't
8414180	8416260	know if all the DLC is in that one.
8416260	8418740	Um, same with the Lego Batman stuff.
8418740	8424420	I don't know if DLC is in there, but I don't think, um, no, I don't want to install that.
8424420	8431060	I don't, I do they, I mean, I assume they sell DLC on here, but like, I don't know.
8431060	8432060	I'm sure they do too.
8432060	8434060	Cause I, I, let me, let me find out.
8434060	8435060	Let's see.
8435060	8438140	Well actually, if you could do me a favor, can you pull up the next story for me?
8438140	8441120	Cause it's on one of the sites that's not working on this browser over here.
8441120	8445100	So I'm going to need you to help me out here in talking about it.
8445260	8449220	The next story is about Contra Rogue Corps and I know one part of it is that they're
8449220	8453980	going to be giving away, uh, basically DLC type stuff after launch, which is kind of
8453980	8454980	similar.
8454980	8457700	If I remember right, how like the bomber man reimagining did is that they had like, then
8457700	8461420	you had like pyramid head bomber man and you had other characters that were available in
8461420	8464780	the game after launch and you didn't have to like pay extra money for them.
8464780	8468280	So that's always kind of nice, you know, especially amongst the ranting or raving we've been doing
8468280	8470660	earlier in this show, it is really cool.
8470660	8474540	And I think, you know, it goes a long way when we see a company really support a game
8474540	8476660	after launch with extra additions.
8476660	8479660	I think it's also part of the reason why Overwatch, you know, again, we talked about how Overwatch
8479660	8481100	is a winning formula.
8481100	8486260	What two years later, it's because they keep adding characters like Sigma, Batista or newer
8486260	8488820	characters, you know, they're still adding this replay value.
8488820	8491260	You don't have to buy these characters if you want the skins and you want the pretty
8491260	8495660	characters, you know, or them looking their best, I suppose, uh, then yeah, you either
8495660	8501060	have to play the lottery or, you know, essentially or, or buy more packs, but, uh, yeah.
8501060	8502060	So anyway.
8502060	8505900	For Contra there, the question was, well, why is it taking so long to come back?
8505900	8511520	And so basically the answer to that was it was very hard to kick off the project just
8511520	8514820	because we needed to find the right kind of momentum and timing.
8514820	8517540	Obviously I really wanted to make another Contra game.
8517540	8519020	I've been really pushing.
8519020	8522660	I just couldn't find the right push and couldn't get the approval for such a project.
8522660	8524980	Doesn't that, doesn't that, oh, couldn't get the approval.
8524980	8529620	I was gonna say a lot of that just sounds like a really nice way of saying like, I wanted
8529620	8532980	to do this 10 years ago, but Konami wouldn't let me cause they're bitches.
8532980	8538260	Yeah, that's, I'm sorry, but I, this person's very nice and it's saying it in a very polite
8538260	8542180	way, but that's kind of what I'm really reading into this is that you really want to do this
8542180	8545400	a long time ago is that the timing didn't work out.
8545400	8548700	Like that's what you're saying when you're gonna break up with somebody and they said,
8548700	8550140	it's just not the right time.
8550140	8551300	It's not a you thing.
8551300	8552300	It's a me thing.
8552300	8553300	Yeah.
8553300	8556020	And then they said also one thing, one of the difficult things is finding the right
8556020	8560860	team to work on such a game and even just the staff and resources we have at the time,
8560860	8566060	but what really pushed forward with the project was one of the things that was very memorable
8566060	8570500	to me was working on Contra games and I know the series well, so I figured who else would
8570500	8573940	be worthy to create a new, the next Contra game and that's why I wanted to contribute
8573940	8578380	all of my talent and history on the series to make it come to life.
8578380	8580020	So that's pretty awesome.
8580020	8585260	Um, and then of course they're saying that Rogue Corps is going to be getting free content
8585260	8586940	after launch as well.
8586940	8591580	So they talked about post launch stuff, including more missions and weapons and indicated that
8591580	8595060	players will have the ability to go beyond the current level cap.
8595060	8596260	There's levels in the game.
8596260	8597260	That's weird.
8597260	8598260	Um, yeah.
8598260	8603740	And they said there's also going to be a season pass and it will feature four DLCs that are
8603740	8607460	going to prize up skins and in game items.
8607460	8610620	So there'll be a little mix of stuff that's free and stuff that's not free.
8610620	8613060	I did not play the demo for this.
8613100	8616340	Let me check out that demo cause apparently like I know Dr. C played it and some other
8616340	8618580	people on my Twitter feed have said it's fun.
8618580	8622920	Because like I don't think I want to get more Switch games right now cause my kids are fighting
8622920	8627980	over it and also because I've still have to replace those analog sticks, which by the
8627980	8630380	way, yes, I heard about this too.
8630380	8634820	Um, I was going to mention because now that, you know, that Switch Lite came out, they're
8634820	8638060	using the same fucking analog sticks on the Switch Lite and guess what?
8638060	8639540	You can't replace on those.
8639540	8641640	Yeah, that's smart Nintendo.
8641640	8644120	That's going to be a problem that's going to bite you in the ass six months from now.
8644120	8645120	Yeah.
8645120	8647880	I have a feeling Nintendo is not going to think the best of that decision later on down
8647880	8648880	the line, but we'll see.
8648880	8652380	I mean, it's, it's all about what's going to happen a year from now and those things
8652380	8653380	start breaking.
8653380	8656600	Are they going to have another, you know, suit on their hands or whatever?
8656600	8659240	That one's going to be even harder because you can't just send the controllers in.
8659240	8660960	Whereas you may have spares for that.
8660960	8662520	You got to send the whole damn system back.
8662520	8663520	Yeah.
8663520	8664520	Yeah.
8664520	8665520	That'd be interesting.
8665520	8666860	Anyway, uh, we're going to do just a couple of quick stories and then we're going to get
8666860	8671120	to the listener round table, uh, via discord and chat.
8671120	8674600	So if you want to actually call into our show live, you can use, have to be on our
8674600	8678580	discord server over at vog network.com slash discord.
8678580	8679580	We'll get you the invite.
8679580	8680580	You need to get in there.
8680580	8684800	And uh, if you go to the green room, you can hang out and uh, we'll pull some of you guys
8684800	8687760	in to actually be on the show a little later on.
8687760	8690620	All the information about that is right below on Twitch TV.
8690620	8693920	If you're watching on your computer, all that is recap down below because I know we have
8693920	8695920	some new viewers tonight.
8695920	8696920	So thanks for that.

8700040	8701440	and watch, you can do that too.
8701440	8704200	We'll also take questions and other comments from our chat room.
8704200	8709280	But first we have a few more stories for you guys, including, I think, uh, we were talking
8709280	8710280	about blue rays earlier.
8710280	8713800	This is one that some of y'all might want to get because I have to ask you a question
8713800	8714800	though.
8714800	8719560	Did you touch her breast?
8719560	8724480	In case you don't pick out the reference, please provide 30 years ago before this clip
8724480	8725480	ends up on Tumblr.
8725480	8731680	30 years ago, a brilliant movie came out called the wizard, um, which, you know, how many
8731680	8733680	of y'all saw it in theaters?
8733680	8734920	That's on the drive in.
8734920	8739400	Yeah, I didn't see a drive in, but my dad bless his heart, took me to go see it in the
8739400	8742060	theater at the, at the, at the boobies is what they were.
8742060	8743060	They were the domes.
8743060	8744060	So we all call them the boobies.
8744060	8747560	So he took me to the boobies to go see, uh, the wizard.
8747560	8748560	Yes.
8748560	8750040	So the wizard came out 30 years ago.
8750040	8751040	They're having their anniversary.
8751040	8756360	Um, coming, they have a 30th anniversary edition is coming out in blue Ray, uh, set the launch
8756360	8758720	February, 2020.
8758720	8765440	And don't know what special features are going to be on there, but it'll be so rad.
8765440	8767400	You think we'd get something like deleted scenes?
8767400	8769280	Maybe the power glove edition.
8769280	8770280	Hmm.
8770280	8771280	I don't know.
8771280	8775560	Oh, wouldn't that be cool if the case was like a power glove type of thing?
8775560	8776560	I don't know.
8776560	8777560	Maybe there's some, probably not.
8777560	8779000	There's still be trademarks and copyrights.
8779000	8780000	Yeah.
8780000	8781000	Maybe.
8781960	8784640	But yeah, it, it was, it was such a big commercial for Nintendo products.
8784640	8789120	It was, or as a saying in their chat room, uh, Bobby Blackwell says the super Mario brothers
8789120	8793400	three and Nintendo direct orange right says the first Nintendo direct ever.
8793400	8794400	Yeah.
8794400	8795400	Pretty much pretty much.
8795400	8799440	Uh, and Bobby is also saying, I saw it in theaters twice just to watch the super Mario
8799440	8800440	brothers three portion.
8800440	8807000	Again, I, I sat there, I brought a notepad to write down things to take notes about super
8807000	8808000	Mario brothers three.
8808000	8809000	Oh no.
8809000	8810640	And a downer message from Bobby.
8810680	8814800	I forgot about this sad that the guy who played Lucas became a registered sex offender.
8814800	8815800	Oh yeah.
8815800	8816800	I heard about that too.
8816800	8817800	Thanks.
8817800	8824000	I guess we solved that problem then of who it was that touched her breasts.
8824000	8826720	I'm just, I don't want anything to do with that joke.
8826720	8829320	I'm just gonna move right into the next story.
8829320	8831040	Well, great, great.
8831040	8835120	And then here's, here's the story I saved for last boil boy.
8835120	8838120	This is a show that's going to generate some emails.
8838120	8845400	Um, the, uh, headline here on VG 24 seven is over 1 million people have wanked off to
8845400	8848620	border lands on porn hub during launch week.
8848620	8849620	That's right.
8849620	8852560	People are watching border lands porn on porn hub.
8852560	8857440	A 1 million people search for border lands porn in five days.
8857440	8863720	That's an increase of 12,905% of who is looking for border lands porn the day before.
8863720	8869320	See that porn hub being the social savvy company that they are actually went out and
8869320	8873520	made a graphic for what people are searching for.
8873520	8878320	By the way, border lands five times more popular than Fortnite and three times more popular
8878320	8880200	than overwatch.
8880200	8883680	Would you like to hear some of the searches people have been doing on porn hub?
8883680	8884680	Yes.
8884680	8890520	Border lands three border lands, moxie, border lands, two border lands, hentai, border lands,
8890520	8895760	Lilith, border lands, cosplay, border lands, and pretty much every character in the game,
8895760	8899520	tales from the border lands and so on and so on.
8899520	8903120	Porn hub actually wrote a blog post about it saying the most popular border land search
8903120	8908640	is border lands three followed by border lands, moxie, a search demographic show that men
8908640	8916720	are 84% more likely to search border lands than women and visitors age 18 to 24 are 119%
8916720	8921240	more likely to search when compared to all other age groups.
8921240	8922640	Fascinating.
8922640	8932000	The people most likely to search for porn on Pandora are also likely to search for hentai.
8932000	8933000	That's it.
8933000	8934000	That's the tweet.
8934000	8936720	People are searching for border lands porn on porn hub.
8936720	8937720	Thanks, Valve.
8937720	8939760	Why are you saying thanks, Valve?
8939760	8942440	Because most of that shit was made with Valve's source filmmaker.
8942440	8943440	Source filmmaker.
8943440	8946080	You can't even buy the fucking game on Steam.
8946440	8950560	No, but they use that for all sorts of like naughty videos.
8950560	8956240	All your Overwatch shit, all your, you know, border lands stuff.
8956240	8957240	Source filmmaker.
8957240	8961800	Anyhow, I'm so glad we could end on that note.
8961800	8964640	Maybe we'll see if there's last minute stories later on in the show.
8964640	8967960	But it's that time of the show where we're going to take your calls and some of your
8967960	8968960	questions from Discord.
8968960	8973040	If you have any questions for us, you can put those in our Twitch channel right now.
8973040	8974400	Twitch.tv slash vog network.
8974400	8978040	But we actually do have a call waiting to come be on the show tonight.
8978040	8980720	So let's go to the Discord server and say hello.
8980720	8981720	You're on Orange Launch Radio.
8981720	8982720	Who's this?
8982720	8983720	It's Shane.
8983720	8984720	Hey, Shane.
8984720	8985720	It's good to hear from you.
8985720	8986720	What's up?
8986720	8989800	I wanted to talk about the best game of the year.
8989800	8990800	Wait, wait, wait, wait.
8990800	8995240	Before you do that, you have to tell the story about how you crossed state lines to capture
8995240	8996240	Pokemon.
8996240	8997560	Oh, okay.
8997560	9003760	So we already heard the story of how Oshawa is my favorite Pokemon and is the best Pokemon
9003760	9008640	how I wanted it and go like, I wanted as many as I could possibly get.
9008640	9014920	So there weren't any easy ways around where I live to get one.
9014920	9021000	But according to our local area group, there was one at a nest at a park about an hour
9021000	9024160	away for like, cool, let's go get it.
9024160	9029760	So we just typed the name of the park into GPS.
9029760	9036720	And we just drove and when we got there, so, like, it was just this little town with a
9036720	9040240	park and we're driving through this little town.
9040240	9047560	And I saw, like a pot dispensary, I'm like, wait, Idaho doesn't have that.
9047560	9051880	And then I started looking at the buildings and one of them said, like, the name of the
9051880	9052880	city, Oregon.
9052880	9057160	And I'm like, Oh, we went to a different state.
9057160	9061240	So only you would kidnap oshawats and take them across state lines after
9061240	9064240	Yeah, I only got five.
9064240	9066480	So I didn't take I didn't kidnap a whole bunch.
9066480	9072080	Yeah, that that nest that I basically helped you cheat to get in Elk Grove was kind of
9072080	9074000	better even though it's kind of slow like that.
9074000	9078920	Well, you know that park right for the I guess yeah, because for the listeners, yeah, I used
9078920	9080240	to hunt there.
9080240	9084800	This park is like four, but was some like there was like two stops there that were new
9084800	9085800	to you.
9085800	9087240	So there's clearly added things.
9087240	9092320	But anyway, this is one of those like sports parks is like four baseball diamonds big.
9092320	9095240	And you have to like walk around the mall to get all the stops.
9095240	9096240	It's crazy big.
9096240	9097240	So yeah.
9097240	9098240	All right.
9098240	9101600	What do you really want to call in about tonight?
9101600	9107760	The best game of the year untitled goose game.
9107760	9108760	Untitled goose game.
9108760	9110160	Just waiting for you to pull it up.
9110160	9111160	There it is.
9111160	9112160	Okay.
9112160	9113160	There.
9113160	9114160	There's a shame trust that I'm on it.
9114160	9115160	Yes.
9115160	9116160	Uh huh.
9116160	9121040	Um, so I bought this game, not knowing anything about it, except that you were a goose.
9121040	9123200	And I was like, well, that's really enough for me.
9123200	9126720	I don't really need much more information than that.
9126720	9135640	And what I got was a hilarious puzzle stealth game that I laughed so hard playing it.
9135640	9141520	I don't remember playing a game where I laughed this hard in a long, long time.
9141520	9142520	Random ass segment.
9142520	9145360	We're watching on the Twitch feed right now.
9145360	9149240	The goose like honked at this guy until he fell over and his glasses fell off.
9149240	9152440	The goose went over, picked up the glasses and ran away like a little bitch.
9152440	9153440	Yeah.
9153440	9154440	No.
9154440	9155440	Well you do that.
9155440	9157040	So you're the little bitch.
9157040	9158040	It's not the goose.
9158040	9160040	What'd you call me?
9160040	9161560	Well, whatever.
9161560	9162560	It's fine.
9163560	9173000	But no, it gave me the same amount of happiness that I got when I first played Katamari Damacy.
9173000	9175000	It was just amazing.
9175000	9184800	And there's nothing really fancy or spectacular about this game, but it's fun.
9184800	9190600	I feel like I know what it's like to be a goose now because they're just jerks and that's
9190600	9192480	all you do in this game is be a jerk.
9192480	9193480	And I love it.
9193480	9196200	I'm glad you said it so I didn't have to.
9196200	9202560	Yeah, but it's not very long and it's on sale right now for 15 instead of 20, which was
9202560	9205720	also a nice little bonus.
9205720	9210640	But you're given like a set of tasks for each area.
9210640	9216280	And once you complete a certain amount of tasks, which is almost always the whole list
9216280	9220600	or close to it rather, you get to go on to another area.
9220600	9226880	And there's only four areas, I believe, four main areas at least.
9226880	9232640	And I beat the game in as hard of quote marks as I can use with my fingers.
9232640	9237440	But after you beat it and you go through the credits, you're given a whole other list of
9237440	9238440	tasks.
9238440	9242400	And I don't know if it opens up more areas because I stopped playing that and we were
9242400	9247680	showing Dustin's coworker, Sayonara Wild Hearts.
9247680	9254080	So Sayonara Wild Hearts.
9254080	9256860	So I don't know, maybe there's like a lot of replayability.
9256860	9258140	I want a second game.
9258140	9259920	I want DLC.
9259920	9264160	I don't want to be a different goose, though, because this goose is the best one.
9264160	9267120	Sorry, I'm laughing at the video.
9267120	9270160	He just he just snatched those paper towels right back from her.
9270160	9274120	Yeah, you have to do this sort of stuff like you have to get creative.
9274120	9279720	I had to get this guy's hat and I couldn't reach his head.
9279720	9289240	So I had to like, put something that he would pick up that I had moved over by like a mound
9289240	9290240	of dirt.
9290240	9293800	And I just stood there waiting for him to go pick it up and I snatched his hat and ran
9293800	9294920	away with it.
9294920	9295920	It was great.
9295920	9298880	Okay, I'm running out of b rolls, I gotta go back to the studio.
9298880	9299880	But that's fine.
9299880	9302000	I mean, the game does look hilarious.
9302000	9305200	Again, there were a lot of good games that came out this week.
9305200	9308600	And I think most people are fixated on Link's Awakening, which I get it.
9308600	9309600	It's fine.
9309600	9310600	It's a great game.
9310600	9311600	That should be one of the games you're playing.
9311600	9315400	But like, you know, there's these other great releases that came out and I know Shane is
9315400	9317040	all about the Untitled Goose Game.
9317040	9321920	I'm all about Sayonara Wild Hearts and honestly, I'll probably like the goose game too.
9321920	9324360	And Shane, you like Sayonara Wild Hearts, right?
9324360	9326080	Yeah, I haven't played it a lot.
9326080	9327080	I watched it mostly.
9327080	9332360	But when I did play, I was trying to do those riddles.
9332360	9334320	And it was fun.
9334320	9336240	It's just 80s nonsense.
9336240	9343040	And 80s nonsense is a great way to describe this game, quite honestly.
9343040	9344120	Yeah.
9344120	9347720	But it's not better than Untitled Goose Game and we picked up Zelda.
9347720	9351840	I haven't even opened it yet because I'm like, these games are way too fun.
9351840	9355320	I don't even care about Zelda right now.
9355800	9358080	Yeah, it's a busy week.
9358080	9361800	And then on top of all that, it's like, oh, and I've got to play Final Fantasy 14 as well
9361800	9364280	and all my MMOs and all that stuff too.
9364280	9366760	So it's been a week.
9366760	9367760	Yeah.
9367760	9374080	But I suggest anybody that even liked that footage, the littlest bit, it's so much better
9374080	9375080	than that.
9375080	9377280	I locked a lady in a garage.
9377280	9379640	Like that's how great this game is.
9379640	9381120	That's awesome.
9381120	9383440	So it's on sale right now.
9383440	9385020	Go get it.
9385020	9386020	You won't be disappointed.
9386020	9392180	All right, quickly, before I let you go, the last Pokemon Community Day that we had was
9392180	9393740	Turtwig, right?
9393740	9394740	Yeah.
9394740	9397440	How many shiny Turtwigs did you pick up?
9397440	9398440	Not that many.
9398440	9402340	It was not a great time yet again.
9402340	9405240	I think it was under 10.
9405240	9407260	So I just didn't care either.
9407260	9408260	It was Turtwig.
9408260	9412620	This might have been the first Community Day ever I got more than you.
9412620	9417900	Well, I'm literally looking right now just to make sure and I didn't trade any so I should
9417900	9420680	see one.
9420680	9422460	I got 10 exactly.
9422460	9423780	All right.
9423780	9424780	Yeah.
9424780	9425780	All right.
9425780	9429740	I'll just wait till next June when Oshawott should have his Community Day.
9429740	9432060	So Oh, and it's on.
9432060	9438040	I see in chat what systems it's on switch, Mac and Windows.
9438040	9439500	And I think that's it.
9439500	9442060	Is it an Epic Store exclusive because I see their feature?
9442060	9443060	It is.
9443060	9444060	Yeah.
9444060	9445060	Boy.
9445060	9446060	There they go again.
9446060	9447060	All right.
9447060	9448060	All right.
9448060	9449060	Well, Shane, thanks for the call.
9449060	9452240	I'm glad you know, since we missed it, you know, Loki and I weren't able to play the
9452240	9453240	game this week.
9453240	9454900	I'm glad somebody did and talk to us about it.
9454900	9456460	So I will definitely check it out.
9456460	9458700	I guess I'll have to pick it up while it's still on sale.
9458700	9460580	There is also another game I was going to mention.
9460580	9464560	I haven't got a chance to play it yet, but I know it also came out this week as well
9464560	9470380	as what the golf and that one looked funny to what's that one about briefly.
9470600	9473660	It's like a it's like a golf game, but it's it's strange.
9473660	9478380	Each level is not necessarily like how you normally play golf.
9478380	9480620	And it's just like the Kirby golf game.
9480620	9482200	No, it's very different.
9482200	9484380	Like I seriously, you know, definitely go check it out.
9484380	9488060	Like there's one level that there's a bunch of people where you're a soccer ball and a
9488060	9490860	bunch of people are trying to kick you off a cliff or something like that.
9490860	9492300	And you're trying to get to the goal.
9492300	9494260	It is just a really weird game.
9494260	9495260	All right.
9495260	9497740	That's also coming out on switch and PC.
9497740	9498740	OK.
9498820	9503420	Before I go, I do want to say one more thing about that amazing game of the year that I
9503420	9504420	play.
9504420	9507820	OK, so because there's no spoilers in this game because you're given your tasks.
9507820	9510840	So one of them is you have to get a ribbon on you.
9510840	9516700	And the only way to get a ribbon is to steal a ceramic duck, go hide it somewhere and then
9516700	9521220	go pose as the duck until the lady comes and puts a ribbon on you.
9521220	9523680	I thought that was hilarious.
9523680	9524680	That's pretty good.
9524680	9527860	It sounds like the type of game that you did you like because you mentioned like you've
9527860	9531060	been hanging out with your hubby and coworker and stuff like that.
9531060	9532060	Were you all playing it together?
9532060	9533060	Just laughing.
9533060	9534620	It's probably that game that's like funnier in groups.
9534620	9538300	Yeah, it was just me and Dustin for most of it.
9538300	9544820	And then his coworker came over and we just all kind of played through the last stage
9544820	9546660	and it was hilarious.
9546660	9548020	All right.
9548020	9549820	All right, Shane.
9549820	9553300	If you don't have anything else, I'm gonna let you go for now and we'll talk to you later.
9553300	9554300	OK.
9554300	9555300	Bye bye.
9555300	9556300	All right.
9557020	9559100	I don't know if we have to have any last minute story.
9559100	9560100	There's nobody else in the green room.
9560100	9561420	So I don't know if we have any last minute stories.
9561420	9564740	It did seem like it was kind of a slower Newsweek this week, didn't it?
9564740	9565940	Yeah, it was pretty slow.
9565940	9568220	Like I was looking for stuff and just me.
9568220	9572560	Yeah, I know it's almost everybody's playing games with all the stuff that's out there
9572560	9573560	to play this week.
9573560	9574560	So.
9574560	9575560	All right.
9575560	9576560	Well, I guess we're going to get everybody's final thoughts and then we're going to wrap
9576560	9577560	up.
9577560	9580100	By the way, if you are watching live on Twitch, we're going to do the giveaway from the community
9580100	9582260	chest one more time during the credits.
9582260	9587680	So stay tuned because you might win something and chances are pretty good to actually just
9587680	9592940	like because literally everybody who didn't already have it got one and there were still
9592940	9594400	like 13 left.
9594400	9595400	So yeah.
9595400	9596400	Sit tight.
9596400	9598620	If you don't have a Twitch Prime thing, you're going to get this Dauntless thing.
9598620	9602900	I could see how many viewers we have and it's not as so many that will probably still have
9602900	9606140	some gifts left over that we'll have to use in the middle of the week or something.
9606140	9607180	I don't know.
9607180	9609900	But anyway, I do want to start to wrap up here.
9609900	9614220	Thank you, of course, for tuning into Orange Andrado tonight and for participating with
9614220	9615220	the show.
9615220	9616220	Really appreciate it.
9616220	9619260	If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Andrado, please tell a friend or two about
9619260	9620260	the show.
9620260	9622700	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
9622700	9626680	But if the voices aren't here in our green room waiting to call, how can we get those
9626680	9627980	voices out there?
9627980	9629780	We need more in our chat and so forth.
9629780	9632020	So really appreciate the raids and all that stuff.
9632020	9633020	That's really awesome.
9633020	9635060	Thank you so much for that.
9635060	9639380	And I also want to say a big thanks for that.
9639380	9643100	And those of you that do the auto hosting as well on Twitch, all that hosting and stuff
9643100	9644380	goes a very long way.
9644380	9649100	I will acknowledge some more specifics after the credits as I usually do.
9649100	9651780	In the meantime, it's about that time to get everybody's final thoughts.
9651780	9653980	We'll be back in seven days to do this all over again.
9653980	9655660	Dark Soccer should be back with us.
9655660	9660420	I know she's been playing an awful lot of Link's Awakening and her and Dan are further
9660420	9661420	in the game than I am.
9661420	9662740	So they probably have a lot to say about it.
9662740	9664480	I know they're going to want to talk about it as well.
9664480	9666980	So we'll get into that in the next week.
9667580	9669700	Meanwhile, we're about here to close up shop.
9669700	9672220	So Loki, any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
9672220	9676340	I have to play Untitled Goose Game this week and then just work on my game.
9676340	9677340	Yeah.
9677340	9678340	I want to see.
9678340	9679340	I saw like I peeked over your shoulder.
9679340	9680500	I saw a little bit of your game.
9680500	9684180	It looked like the yeah, you've got like walls and it looks pretty legit.
9684180	9685180	Yeah.
9685180	9686180	The walls and stuff.
9686180	9690260	I just I updated because I deleted my arena that I was in.
9690260	9694380	So I re updated everything because it's built out of tiles now.
9694380	9698780	And so I had to rebuild everything.
9698780	9701620	I have an error, though, so I can't actually play it at the moment.
9701620	9703860	I have to fix whatever it is.
9703860	9704860	It's something that was working.
9704860	9707660	I think when I was taking stuff out, I did a bug fixing.
9707660	9708660	Yes.
9708660	9709660	That's part of making a game, right?
9709660	9710660	Yeah.
9710660	9712660	Well, I look forward to being able to play your game at some point.
9712660	9713820	All right.
9713820	9718100	And my final thought tonight is, oh, busy.
9718100	9722260	It's going to be a very busy week and weekend and very busy for the next couple weeks.
9722260	9725180	But I hope I get to squeeze in some great game playing myself.
9725180	9730300	I still want to get further in Link's Awakening and I got to play this goose game as well
9730300	9733380	for myself and whatever else is going to come out in the next couple of weeks.
9733380	9735020	It's a great time to be a gamer.
9735020	9738140	So that's going to do it for another night here at Orange Lounge Radio.
9738140	9741180	Thank you guys again, as always, for tuning in and watching, whether you did it here live
9741180	9743700	on Twitch or whether you listen to the podcast feed.
9743700	9747100	Thank you so much for participating with the show and we'll do it again in seven days.
9747100	9748100	Have a great night, everybody.
