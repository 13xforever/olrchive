00:00.000 --> 00:18.520
This week, classic game preservation, lawsuit three masters, teases, and the general lot.

00:18.520 --> 00:21.640
If you'll excuse me, I'm going to go play the original medieval because I never did

00:21.640 --> 00:23.520
when I was younger and its remake is coming out.

00:23.520 --> 00:26.400
That's what I'll be doing over the next couple of hours while listening to the show

00:26.400 --> 00:28.120
where every gamer has a voice.

00:28.120 --> 00:31.120
Orange Lounge Radio.

00:31.120 --> 00:36.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:36.000 --> 00:37.680
where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.680 --> 00:44.080
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 794 for this September 29th

00:44.080 --> 00:45.480
of 2019.

00:45.480 --> 00:51.680
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me here in Studio N7 in Sacramento, California, say

00:51.680 --> 00:54.400
hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:54.400 --> 00:56.440
Happy New Year, Jews.

00:56.440 --> 00:57.800
Yes, Happy New Year.

00:57.800 --> 00:59.880
Happy Jew Year.

00:59.880 --> 01:01.280
You had last week off.

01:01.280 --> 01:02.280
Yeah.

01:02.280 --> 01:06.280
How you doing?

01:06.280 --> 01:07.280
On fire.

01:07.280 --> 01:09.240
There's a fire.

01:09.240 --> 01:10.800
There's a fire in your heart?

01:10.800 --> 01:13.600
In my dark, rotten heart.

01:13.600 --> 01:14.600
I see.

01:14.600 --> 01:21.480
Burning away the rottenness and leaving me in a mood, quote fingers, a mood.

01:21.480 --> 01:23.000
And what's fanning those flames?

01:23.000 --> 01:24.680
Is it the wings of a goose?

01:24.680 --> 01:26.680
I haven't played it yet.

01:26.680 --> 01:27.680
It's a lack of Pepto.

01:27.680 --> 01:28.680
Oh, hi, Tech Master Loki.

01:28.680 --> 01:29.680
How are you?

01:29.680 --> 01:30.680
Hi, I'm here.

01:30.680 --> 01:31.680
As you can see on the camera.

01:31.680 --> 01:32.920
Or not, because you may be listening to us.

01:32.920 --> 01:34.440
Yeah, they may be listening on the podcast feed.

01:34.440 --> 01:37.160
Yeah, I think I need like a Zantac or something.

01:37.160 --> 01:42.320
But if you want to watch us live, you can every week at Twitch TV slash VOG Network,

01:42.320 --> 01:46.000
where we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right

01:46.000 --> 01:48.280
after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

01:48.280 --> 01:51.640
And you can chat along in our chat room and we read some of the comments throughout the

01:51.640 --> 01:52.640
evening on chat.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.760
Excuse me, on the stream and on our show.

01:54.760 --> 01:58.840
And of course, later in the show, we'll invite your calls via Discord or if you're feeling

01:58.840 --> 02:02.680
shy, of course, we take lots of questions from the chat room and all that good stuff.

02:02.680 --> 02:04.920
So we have to catch things up on Dark Sakura.

02:04.920 --> 02:08.440
We have to we have to go over the outstanding agenda items from our last meeting for meeting

02:08.440 --> 02:10.000
number 793.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Did you write the minutes?

02:11.000 --> 02:15.760
So yes, item number one, Dark Sakura, I brought you an offering.

02:15.760 --> 02:19.040
It's a new little Mortal Kombat mini machine that I paid you for.

02:19.040 --> 02:20.040
You did.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.880
But I talked a little bit about this on last week's show.

02:21.880 --> 02:23.960
I'm just kind of curious what you think of it in person.

02:23.960 --> 02:26.200
This is kind of funky on it.

02:26.200 --> 02:27.200
Yeah.

02:27.200 --> 02:28.600
They're probably that way to be.

02:28.600 --> 02:33.160
You know, I didn't even notice it right off the bat, but there's six buttons on it.

02:33.160 --> 02:34.160
Yeah.

02:34.160 --> 02:35.160
Five.

02:35.160 --> 02:36.160
That's really weird.

02:36.160 --> 02:37.160
I think Loki noticed that, like, right off the bat.

02:37.160 --> 02:38.160
He was like, why is there six?

02:38.160 --> 02:41.640
But I saw in the picture that you sent, but I was like, maybe it was just well, then it's

02:41.640 --> 02:42.680
got there.

02:42.680 --> 02:43.680
It's a block button.

02:43.680 --> 02:45.820
It's a port of the Genesis version.

02:45.820 --> 02:49.360
And although someone like I don't know if they've confirmed it or not.

02:49.360 --> 02:52.800
You said that there was no blood in there, but it alludes to a blood code.

02:52.800 --> 02:55.960
And since it's a Genesis version, you'd think that you'd still be able to put the blood

02:55.960 --> 02:56.960
code in.

02:56.960 --> 02:59.080
It doesn't say anything on it.

02:59.080 --> 03:00.080
Yeah.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.080
About licensing.

03:01.080 --> 03:02.080
I didn't.

03:02.080 --> 03:04.840
I haven't, to be honest, I haven't really turned it on and played with it yet.

03:04.840 --> 03:07.980
That's something I hope to do a little later.

03:07.980 --> 03:08.980
So we'll see.

03:08.980 --> 03:09.980
Anyway.

03:09.980 --> 03:10.980
I'm turning it on.

03:10.980 --> 03:11.980
Yeah.

03:11.980 --> 03:14.720
I already played a little bit with it on this feed last week, so I don't want to repeat

03:14.720 --> 03:15.720
ourselves too bad.

03:15.720 --> 03:18.080
But I just wanted to see what you thought of that in person now that you're here.

03:18.080 --> 03:20.400
It doesn't look like the Genesis version though.

03:20.400 --> 03:21.720
It's got better animation.

03:21.720 --> 03:25.020
You think it looks like the Genesis version to me, but it might be different hardware

03:25.020 --> 03:26.020
in there.

03:26.020 --> 03:27.020
Who knows?

03:27.020 --> 03:28.020
Anyway.

03:28.020 --> 03:29.400
Um, there was another outstanding agenda item.

03:29.400 --> 03:30.400
Oh yes.

03:30.400 --> 03:31.400
Things of super importance.

03:31.400 --> 03:35.000
Cause you know, we do talk video games here at Orange Lawn Radio, but once in a while

03:35.000 --> 03:36.800
other things come up too.

03:36.800 --> 03:40.340
So Loki tried to go back to the chicken place last week and guess what?

03:40.340 --> 03:41.520
They're gone.

03:41.520 --> 03:42.520
They're gone.

03:42.520 --> 03:43.520
Out of business already.

03:43.520 --> 03:44.520
It's been like a month.

03:44.520 --> 03:45.520
Chicken.

03:45.520 --> 03:46.520
The Korean chicken place.

03:46.520 --> 03:47.520
Oh, that sucks.

03:47.960 --> 03:49.440
A moment of silence, please.

03:49.440 --> 03:51.400
They are officially gone.

03:51.400 --> 03:52.400
Wow.

03:52.400 --> 03:57.960
Because, uh, I did see like if you actually go up on Google reviews, someone posted the

03:57.960 --> 04:00.640
eviction notice, so it's legit.

04:00.640 --> 04:01.640
They've been evicted.

04:01.640 --> 04:02.640
Yikes.

04:02.640 --> 04:04.160
No more, no more awesome chicken.

04:04.160 --> 04:05.280
At least I had it twice.

04:05.280 --> 04:08.880
I hope it wasn't cause they failed a health inspection like real bad or something.

04:08.880 --> 04:13.040
That's uh, whatever they were doing, whatever rat feces were in there, it was delicious.

04:13.040 --> 04:15.200
So that was actually the flavor apparently.

04:15.200 --> 04:16.200
All right.

04:16.200 --> 04:17.200
Anyway, that's, that's what made it taste so good.

04:17.880 --> 04:21.160
It's like, Hmm, maybe I should try Rafi says more often if it tastes like buttery chicken.

04:21.160 --> 04:22.160
Yeah.

04:22.160 --> 04:23.160
All right.

04:23.160 --> 04:24.160
Let's get into games.

04:24.160 --> 04:25.160
Dang it.

04:25.160 --> 04:28.160
There's a, there's a lot going on this week in the gaming world.

04:28.160 --> 04:31.840
Uh, TwitchCon was this week, which is TwitchCon is more one of those.

04:31.840 --> 04:36.000
Like it's gaming culture, obviously, obviously we were fans of Twitch here cause we're doing

04:36.000 --> 04:39.720
our show here live on Twitch, uh, before it goes to the podcast feed.

04:39.720 --> 04:43.040
But I think there's lots of people that have certainly consumed Twitch in one way or the

04:43.040 --> 04:44.040
other.

04:44.040 --> 04:47.220
And I know you might be out there thinking, Oh, I'm more a mixer person.

04:47.220 --> 04:48.220
Mixer is better.

04:48.220 --> 04:49.220
Or I like to go on YouTube.

04:49.220 --> 04:51.120
I think there's better stuff on YouTube.

04:51.120 --> 04:55.600
I still kind of think even if you're a fan of an alternative platform for whatever reason,

04:55.600 --> 04:58.820
these sorts of conventions are good to keep your eye on because you know, since there

04:58.820 --> 05:03.520
is a little bit more competition coming from specifically mixer, I think in this space,

05:03.520 --> 05:07.960
cause we all know the Ninja thing and by the way, on the tangent, no, I know what you're

05:07.960 --> 05:08.960
talking about.

05:08.960 --> 05:09.960
Y'all know.

05:09.960 --> 05:10.960
Y'all know.

05:10.960 --> 05:11.960
I watched that singing.

05:11.960 --> 05:12.960
Who's under the mask show, right?

05:13.560 --> 05:18.840
What was, I was not expecting freaking Ninja of all people to be one of the celebrities.

05:18.840 --> 05:20.920
I mean, there's, there's your representative.

05:20.920 --> 05:22.400
Oh, you know, it's funny though.

05:22.400 --> 05:25.680
Cause when he got introduced, this is how you know it's not live and that they taped

05:25.680 --> 05:30.640
this stuff like months ago because, uh, Nick Cannon, the host actually said Twitch streamer,

05:30.640 --> 05:34.160
like Twitch guy, he actually said Twitch his name, even though all this shit about mixer

05:34.160 --> 05:36.600
has happened when like several weeks ago.

05:36.600 --> 05:42.020
But yeah, he, he was one of the celebrities that was, uh, in the mask.

05:42.020 --> 05:46.260
Tim and Johnny Weir, who is a great figure skater if you've ever like watched that stuff.

05:46.260 --> 05:47.260
Anyway.

05:47.260 --> 05:48.260
He's so all right.

05:48.260 --> 05:49.260
All right.

05:49.260 --> 05:50.260
Yeah.

05:50.260 --> 05:52.900
I mean, you know, but there's a, I just think I love the costumes.

05:52.900 --> 05:55.220
So nobody, nobody's that great a singer.

05:55.220 --> 05:57.100
It was very much a Fortnite costume.

05:57.100 --> 06:00.260
Like I would not be surprised if that's a new skin that's coming to Fortnite.

06:00.260 --> 06:01.260
Oh God.

06:01.260 --> 06:02.260
Yeah, probably.

06:02.260 --> 06:03.260
Anyway.

06:03.260 --> 06:04.260
All right.

06:04.260 --> 06:05.440
Not to get on that tension too much, but I couldn't help but bring it up.

06:05.440 --> 06:09.140
But I still think, you know, in that competitive outlet with everything, like you kind of want

06:09.140 --> 06:14.540
to watch what Twitch does because, you know, other people are going to, uh, respond to

06:14.540 --> 06:19.020
it in various ways, whether it be with their own, you know, um, new features that are inspired

06:19.020 --> 06:23.320
by Twitch or vice versa, sometimes Twitch kind of borrows things from other places.

06:23.320 --> 06:29.660
So anyway, um, dark Tetsuya in our chat over Twitch TV slash vog network says, wow, he

06:29.660 --> 06:30.660
got on that show.

06:30.660 --> 06:31.660
Yeah.

06:31.660 --> 06:32.660
Go, go figure.

06:32.660 --> 06:33.660
Yeah.

06:33.660 --> 06:35.460
How does that conversation even start?

06:35.460 --> 06:38.860
Like who it's, what's our dream list of people we want to be on the mass singer.

06:38.860 --> 06:41.240
Hey, someone get that Ninja guy.

06:41.240 --> 06:45.300
And it's not like it can even be like, Oh, he'll promote it with his fans that he can't.

06:45.300 --> 06:50.340
None of them can because you don't know who's in there until they get kicked off the show.

06:50.340 --> 06:51.340
Right.

06:51.340 --> 06:52.340
It's weird.

06:52.340 --> 06:53.340
I don't know.

06:53.340 --> 06:54.340
Anyway.

06:54.340 --> 06:55.340
Act F says this is a gaming podcast.

06:55.340 --> 06:56.340
Hypothetically.

06:56.340 --> 06:58.820
I mean, that's the category things are under.

06:58.820 --> 06:59.820
He plays games.

06:59.820 --> 07:00.820
Yeah.

07:00.820 --> 07:01.820
I mean, yeah.

07:01.820 --> 07:02.820
Anyway.

07:02.820 --> 07:03.820
All right.

07:03.820 --> 07:04.820
Moving on.

07:05.180 --> 07:06.180
Let me just say this again.

07:06.180 --> 07:07.180
I'm a little bit sad.

07:07.180 --> 07:08.180
I couldn't go.

07:08.180 --> 07:09.580
I haven't been in several years.

07:09.580 --> 07:14.300
The last Twitch con I went to was when they had it at the Moscone center.

07:14.300 --> 07:17.340
And I want to say that was almost four years ago, maybe five years ago at this point.

07:17.340 --> 07:22.000
But that actually, so, so it was actually our voiceover guy who's a big Twitch supporter

07:22.000 --> 07:25.700
and community, you know, personally, he's in a lot of Twitch channels, including this

07:25.700 --> 07:26.700
one.

07:26.700 --> 07:29.540
Um, Jason like was like, no, no, I have an extra ticket.

07:29.540 --> 07:31.820
You're going to Twitch con and come up here for the day.

07:31.820 --> 07:32.820
Come on.

07:32.820 --> 07:33.820
You know?

07:33.820 --> 07:38.900
And so, and I'm actually really glad he forced me to go because that really helped me like

07:38.900 --> 07:45.340
get Twitch a lot more and actually kind of inspired me to do kind of what's happening

07:45.340 --> 07:46.340
now.

07:46.340 --> 07:50.500
I mean, you know, eventually it wasn't a direct path to OLR being on Twitch, but I don't think

07:50.500 --> 07:52.340
we would have got here without that.

07:52.340 --> 07:54.900
So, um, yeah, Twitch con was very inspiring.

07:54.900 --> 07:59.340
So I've kind of wanted to go every year since, but they've had it on really bad weekends.

07:59.340 --> 08:03.180
They usually have it around Halloween and I'm almost always committed to hosting a show

08:03.180 --> 08:04.180
like October.

08:04.180 --> 08:07.700
Cause y'all know, I do hosting gigs here locally on the side for cult cinema and burlesque

08:07.700 --> 08:08.700
and stuff.

08:08.700 --> 08:10.380
And so I do like improv and stuff.

08:10.380 --> 08:13.620
So October is a crazy month for that stuff.

08:13.620 --> 08:16.740
September would have been great if I didn't start a new job just three weeks ago, so I

08:16.740 --> 08:17.740
couldn't make it.

08:17.740 --> 08:20.460
But next year they've already announced, that's one thing to point out.

08:20.460 --> 08:23.820
They've already announced the dates for next year and there's two Twitch cons cause they're

08:23.820 --> 08:26.060
going to have one in Amsterdam earlier in the year as well.

08:26.060 --> 08:30.220
So, uh, but I will definitely, definitely go next year, assuming it doesn't like sell

08:30.220 --> 08:31.780
out or something silly.

08:31.780 --> 08:34.900
So as we mentioned, uh, there's going to be a European Twitch con that will happen May

08:34.900 --> 08:41.140
2nd and 3rd, 2020 and San Diego will be the home once again, uh, for Twitch con, uh, next

08:41.140 --> 08:42.140
year.

08:42.140 --> 08:43.140
And it's not in October.

08:43.140 --> 08:44.140
It's kind of the same weekend next year.

08:44.140 --> 08:48.160
It's the last weekend of September, uh, the 25th through the 27th, some new things that

08:48.160 --> 08:49.420
are going to be coming to Twitch.

08:49.420 --> 08:53.880
There's going to be a creator dashboard so you can actually set up actions on your dashboard.

08:53.880 --> 08:59.360
It sounds to me a little bit like, like these little stream deck clicky things, like that

08:59.360 --> 09:02.560
the new dashboard is kind of inspired by that a little bit.

09:02.560 --> 09:05.560
So, you know, we like our, our push buttons to be able to do things.

09:05.560 --> 09:07.520
So it sounds like it might be a little bit like that.

09:07.520 --> 09:08.640
This is really cool too.

09:08.640 --> 09:12.120
Um, viewers will be able to earn points for doing things you're already doing that you

09:12.120 --> 09:17.400
can use for rewards like tier one emotes, highlighting a message or other things that

09:17.400 --> 09:19.040
we decide to turn on for you.

09:19.040 --> 09:22.800
I'm sure we here at VOG Network will do something with that.

09:22.800 --> 09:24.960
I just don't know what we'll do with that yet.

09:24.960 --> 09:28.200
I'm not going to promise we'll turn everything on, but I mean, I could see where like the

09:28.200 --> 09:30.880
highlighting the messages or I'm all I'm big on emotes.

09:30.880 --> 09:32.880
Like we could, we could try to use some of that stuff.

09:32.880 --> 09:35.280
So that sounds kind of interesting.

09:35.280 --> 09:38.320
Um, this is also a big, big deal.

09:38.320 --> 09:40.400
Ads are going to change on Twitch.

09:40.400 --> 09:46.640
Um, so ads will not necessarily be right at the top of the fee.

09:46.640 --> 09:49.400
You know how, like, if you go to a channel that you're not subscribed to, you get like

09:49.400 --> 09:50.800
a pre-roll ad.

09:50.800 --> 09:56.020
Those may not necessarily be there moving forward because now affiliates as well as

09:56.020 --> 09:59.080
partners will be able to add drop midstream.

09:59.080 --> 10:04.000
So if we wanted to, when we wanted to take a quick 30 second studio break or something,

10:04.000 --> 10:05.000
we could play an ad.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.200
I'm not saying we're doing that.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.060
I don't know how it's going to work yet.

10:08.060 --> 10:09.880
We got a lot to talk about and dissect.

10:09.880 --> 10:12.880
And most importantly, we have to see it in action.

10:12.880 --> 10:16.840
You gotta, you gotta know what tools you really have because there's, there's the spiel that

10:16.840 --> 10:17.840
they give on stage.

10:17.840 --> 10:18.840
Right?

10:18.840 --> 10:22.040
There's nothing with E3 or any type of show where they're showing a new game.

10:22.040 --> 10:26.600
There's the spiel they give you on stage and then it's what it really looks like, right?

10:26.600 --> 10:28.240
There's no man's sky.

10:28.240 --> 10:30.940
There's what they show you on stage and then there's what it really looks like when it

10:30.940 --> 10:31.980
comes out.

10:31.980 --> 10:33.960
And then it's awesome three years later, to be fair.

10:33.960 --> 10:37.560
Uh, there's the Final Fantasy 7 remake, which looked pretty good on stage.

10:37.560 --> 10:39.220
Like there's no way the game's going to look that good.

10:39.220 --> 10:41.760
And now that they're actually showing it, it's like, oh, holy shit, it does kind of

10:41.760 --> 10:42.760
actually look that good.

10:42.760 --> 10:46.360
So, but anyway, we have to see kind of what the ads and all that stuff really look like.

10:46.400 --> 10:49.080
So that'll, that'll be interesting.

10:49.080 --> 10:54.120
And also they're going to be building in a new studio to make it easier for new creators

10:54.120 --> 10:56.040
to get started with setup.

10:56.040 --> 11:00.960
There's going to be templates, you know, kind of making the path to streaming a little bit

11:00.960 --> 11:02.960
easier.

11:02.960 --> 11:09.400
Let me ask a question of everybody here in studio as well as in our chat room.

11:09.400 --> 11:13.560
Is this a good thing that the accessibility and the way to be able to stream is going

11:13.560 --> 11:20.160
to get easier or is it going to saturate what might already be an oversaturated website?

11:20.160 --> 11:24.080
Like is it, are too many people live streaming?

11:24.080 --> 11:28.120
I don't necessarily think it's going to over saturate anything because people can already

11:28.120 --> 11:29.120
stream.

11:29.120 --> 11:32.280
It's just that you're not going to have all the, you know, templates and everything to

11:32.280 --> 11:34.520
make it look more professional.

11:34.520 --> 11:39.200
It's just, this is adding that kind of polish to your average stream.

11:39.200 --> 11:44.880
So that kind of brings everybody up so that the quality's much better than just like some

11:44.880 --> 11:53.040
really shit quality stream that is in a really low resolution with just, I don't know, graphics

11:53.040 --> 11:58.480
made in paint and who knows, I don't know what the worst case scenario would be, but

11:58.480 --> 12:03.240
I think it's just helpful tools that they have to kind of like make their platform seem

12:03.240 --> 12:07.360
more desirable than say like Mixer or something like that.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.240
So it's like, hey, look, you know, we'll make it easy.

12:09.240 --> 12:13.440
Here's some, here's some pieces that you can use to kind of get yourself started.

12:13.440 --> 12:16.200
Dr. Sacco, what do you think?

12:16.200 --> 12:17.200
I agree with that.

12:17.200 --> 12:20.640
And there's another aspect to this and that's branding.

12:20.640 --> 12:26.200
Twitch has to provide a set standard that's going to fit their brand.

12:26.200 --> 12:33.200
Everything, even if it's individual content providers doing their things, they're still

12:33.240 --> 12:37.600
going to have to have something that ties it all back to Twitch and not just that you're

12:37.600 --> 12:40.440
using their interface.

12:40.440 --> 12:43.640
Actually you may not be aware of this and I think you should definitely look at this

12:43.640 --> 12:46.160
and I'll have to send you the direct link if I can find it or maybe somebody can put

12:46.160 --> 12:47.160
it in chat.

12:47.160 --> 12:50.600
Twitch, as part of this whole Twitch kind of thing, did a massive rebranding.

12:50.600 --> 12:55.440
Like they haven't reinvented the site completely, but they kind of went, here is our tweaked

12:55.440 --> 12:57.560
logo and this is why we tweaked it.

12:57.560 --> 13:01.140
Here is our new color of purple and this is why we went with a brighter purple.

13:01.140 --> 13:04.860
And then they said, here's all the official shades that we will support.

13:04.860 --> 13:06.980
And they named them all after video game related things.

13:06.980 --> 13:10.180
So there's like a jiggly is one of the colors because it looks like Julie Puff and so on

13:10.180 --> 13:11.180
and so on.

13:11.180 --> 13:12.180
There's all these different colors.

13:12.180 --> 13:15.380
And they said, we're changing our font and the new font is this and this is why we're

13:15.380 --> 13:16.760
going with this font.

13:16.760 --> 13:19.440
And I thought as I was reading it, I actually thought of you because I know you're a big,

13:19.440 --> 13:22.300
like you went to school for design and all that stuff and I kind of thought, I bet Jamie

13:22.300 --> 13:25.140
would appreciate that they're not just saying we're changing our brand, but they're kind

13:25.140 --> 13:27.820
of explaining this is what we want to say with it.

13:27.820 --> 13:30.940
We're picking a bolder purple because we want to be bolder, you know, that type of thing.

13:30.940 --> 13:31.940
I thought that was interesting.

13:31.940 --> 13:37.460
No, um, I, I'll be honest, I love the concept of rebranding.

13:37.460 --> 13:41.860
I like it when it's done in a very seamless method.

13:41.860 --> 13:46.220
Like when they say, you know, we're still using purple, but we're using this shade of

13:46.220 --> 13:47.220
purple now.

13:47.220 --> 13:48.220
You know what I mean?

13:48.220 --> 13:53.000
Like if you look at this one shade of pink, you look at and you always think Barbie, right?

13:53.000 --> 13:59.060
If you look at that combination of purple and black today, most of the time for branding,

13:59.060 --> 14:00.680
we're going to think of Twitch.

14:00.680 --> 14:03.740
And that's why they're, you know, with them choosing their specific colors that makes

14:03.740 --> 14:06.360
brand recognition at a glance and just look at the color.

14:06.360 --> 14:11.040
You know, if you look at, you know, a couple of V's and one of them's orange, one of them's

14:11.040 --> 14:15.480
blue, you're going to think of Chevron, you know, it's that immediate recognition.

14:15.480 --> 14:19.120
But I also think though that tying in all the rest of this is another part of that branding

14:19.120 --> 14:20.120
re-effort.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.120
That's right.

14:21.120 --> 14:22.120
You know what?

14:22.120 --> 14:23.120
You're right.

14:23.120 --> 14:25.120
In certain, in certain circles anyway, cause I bet some people when they see the purple

14:25.120 --> 14:29.280
and black or at least the old purple, I think this new purple is a brighter, bolder one

14:29.280 --> 14:30.880
that's going to really stick out.

14:30.880 --> 14:33.940
But like I would say the old purple and black kind of looked like a sports team.

14:33.940 --> 14:35.260
Is it the Jaguars or something?

14:35.260 --> 14:40.440
There's a sports team that has very, or no shit, the Kings here locally are like purple

14:40.440 --> 14:41.440
and white.

14:41.440 --> 14:42.440
Yeah.

14:42.440 --> 14:44.080
Kings are more using the purple and white.

14:44.080 --> 14:45.080
But it depends.

14:45.080 --> 14:46.760
See, it depends what you're into, right?

14:46.760 --> 14:49.760
But maybe Twitch is going with a different shade of purple too, cause it doesn't like

14:49.760 --> 14:51.380
this new purple doesn't look like a sports team.

14:51.380 --> 14:52.380
It's very interesting.

14:52.380 --> 14:54.320
I did notice things are a little brighter.

14:54.320 --> 14:55.320
Yeah.

14:55.320 --> 14:58.240
So anyway, I just thought that was very interesting, the branding and especially you bring that

14:58.240 --> 14:59.240
up like the brand.

14:59.240 --> 15:03.720
Let me go back to the question at hand about should more people be getting into Twitch

15:03.720 --> 15:05.920
or are there too many people in the pool?

15:05.920 --> 15:09.120
Kaijuto says the more, the better.

15:09.120 --> 15:10.120
Let's see.

15:10.120 --> 15:12.780
Fifth Dream says it'd be nice if you could stream and make it look nice without having

15:12.780 --> 15:14.160
to be a fucking wizard in OBS.

15:14.160 --> 15:15.160
Yeah.

15:15.160 --> 15:17.460
This'll be something that they're kind of working on there.

15:17.460 --> 15:22.920
So obviously y'all know I'm a big proponent of more people getting their voices out there

15:22.920 --> 15:23.920
and heard.

15:23.920 --> 15:24.920
So yes, absolutely.

15:24.920 --> 15:28.920
I think this is a great thing, but here's the thing.

15:28.920 --> 15:35.120
I'm starting to notice a few too many people, including people I would consider good friends

15:35.120 --> 15:40.960
of mine and stuff that think that they're going to make oodles of money by streaming

15:40.960 --> 15:46.080
on Twitch that like you're going to get all of a sudden all these people are going to

15:46.080 --> 15:51.160
show up and you're going to make money just because you play video games online.

15:51.160 --> 15:54.760
And I kind of stick to myself because I feel like I've been down this road before with

15:54.760 --> 15:58.760
podcasting is that people will ask, well, how much do you make by podcasting?

15:58.760 --> 16:03.540
Because they think, oh, well, when I listen to RuPaul's podcast, I keep hearing ads for,

16:03.540 --> 16:04.760
you know, new mattress companies.

16:04.760 --> 16:06.920
I have a response to that.

16:06.920 --> 16:10.920
How much do you make sitting in your pajamas?

16:10.920 --> 16:14.680
How much do you make when you drive to the park?

16:14.680 --> 16:15.680
Right?

16:15.680 --> 16:17.880
Well, I don't get paid for that.

16:17.880 --> 16:20.200
You do it because you enjoy it, right?

16:20.200 --> 16:23.920
Why do you have to put monetary value on things that give you joy?

16:23.920 --> 16:24.920
Right.

16:24.920 --> 16:29.280
So I just, that's my only thing is that I am all for more people getting into Twitch

16:29.280 --> 16:31.060
and streaming.

16:31.060 --> 16:35.760
I really would ask somebody, what is your motivation for doing it?

16:35.760 --> 16:39.420
And if your motivation for doing it is that I want to hang out, I want to make some friends

16:39.420 --> 16:40.840
and hang out and play games online.

16:40.840 --> 16:41.840
Cool.

16:41.840 --> 16:42.840
You're doing it for the right reason.

16:42.840 --> 16:43.840
I want to start a community.

16:43.840 --> 16:44.840
Awesome reason.

16:44.840 --> 16:48.920
I want to get my voice out there because I don't feel represented by what's already out

16:48.920 --> 16:49.920
there.

16:49.920 --> 16:51.280
Fucking incredible, amazing reason.

16:51.280 --> 16:52.800
Do it.

16:52.800 --> 16:57.400
But if your reason is I want to make money, just stop, honey, stop.

16:57.400 --> 16:58.400
Don't waste our time.

16:58.400 --> 16:59.400
Well, you'll make money.

16:59.400 --> 17:02.960
It's just, you're going to be disappointed a teeny bit and then everybody else is going

17:02.960 --> 17:03.960
to be disappointed.

17:03.960 --> 17:06.160
You're going to be able to buy that taco, dear.

17:06.160 --> 17:07.560
You'll be able to buy that taco.

17:07.560 --> 17:12.560
So you've got to really like ask yourself the motivation and at the end of the day,

17:12.560 --> 17:16.560
if your motivation is making community, getting your voice out there, I want to be heard more

17:16.560 --> 17:18.560
than anything else, then yes, do it.

17:18.560 --> 17:20.400
And everybody should be out there doing it.

17:21.000 --> 17:25.360
Kaijuto in chat says, I don't think people think they're going to make a lot of cash.

17:25.360 --> 17:28.080
YouTube streamers broke the fourth wall on that.

17:28.080 --> 17:30.960
Most know it's a little bit.

17:30.960 --> 17:31.960
You'd be a little surprised.

17:31.960 --> 17:35.040
Tigerclaw says, what about those that use places like Patreon?

17:35.040 --> 17:37.160
As long as you're not using Kickstarter.

17:37.160 --> 17:44.280
Patreon is fine, but I mean, again, you have to do what's best for you.

17:44.280 --> 17:47.800
I would just say don't go into Patreon with the expectation.

17:48.200 --> 17:53.920
Oh, if I sign up for a Patreon, I'm going to get $50 a month for sure.

17:53.920 --> 17:58.520
You know, because that may not happen and you're just going to set yourself up for disappointment.

17:58.520 --> 18:01.680
Like why are you going to make $50 a month?

18:01.680 --> 18:03.480
That's the number one question to ask yourself.

18:03.480 --> 18:05.480
Why are you going to make that money?

18:05.480 --> 18:08.680
Anyway, let's see, what else do I have here?

18:08.680 --> 18:15.680
Oh, I wanted to give a shout out in our chat to TSS Tech Angel, who back in the day, I'm

18:15.680 --> 18:20.440
going to call her by her old name, DDR Angel, okay, back in the day, was actually at Twitch

18:20.440 --> 18:21.440
Con.

18:21.440 --> 18:25.080
And I know Angel is a big fan and proponent, I guess, of Twitch.

18:25.080 --> 18:27.200
And she is in chat saying, hey guys, just got back.

18:27.200 --> 18:28.800
I'm freaking exhausted.

18:28.800 --> 18:29.800
It went well.

18:29.800 --> 18:32.560
I gave away all 300 art cards that I'd painted.

18:32.560 --> 18:36.200
Well, I'm super sad I didn't go to get one of those cards, but you know, new job and

18:36.200 --> 18:37.260
everything.

18:37.260 --> 18:39.360
And Angel says, I'm not in it for the money either.

18:39.360 --> 18:42.720
If it happens, sure, but I'm there to enjoy doing what I do.

18:42.760 --> 18:47.840
But you know what's awesome, Angel, is like what you just said, you gave away art.

18:47.840 --> 18:53.480
You gave away, you didn't just give away art, you gave away 300 pieces of art.

18:53.480 --> 18:56.640
And like that is something I don't think you can put a price on.

18:56.640 --> 18:57.640
You know what I mean?

18:57.640 --> 18:59.080
Like that's awesome.

18:59.080 --> 19:02.240
So congrats and kudos.

19:02.240 --> 19:03.240
That's amazing.

19:03.240 --> 19:06.760
Bobby Blackwolf in chat talking about the money thing saying, I'm part of the local

19:06.760 --> 19:08.280
Twitch streamer meetup group.

19:08.280 --> 19:12.680
I am one of the few people who don't have aspirations of being a full time Twitch streamer.

19:12.680 --> 19:16.520
And they think I'm crazy.

19:16.520 --> 19:20.160
So anyway, now you're going to laugh because I'm going to say that.

19:20.160 --> 19:23.720
And then at the same token, I'm going to say, but if you want to subscribe here to VOG

19:23.720 --> 19:26.960
Network on Twitch, you can.

19:26.960 --> 19:29.800
Doing so gives you access to the archives and so forth.

19:29.800 --> 19:32.040
And we love the bits and all that stuff.

19:32.040 --> 19:36.120
But it's one of those things where we don't expect it.

19:36.120 --> 19:41.160
We've been doing this show for how many years, 17 plus?

19:41.160 --> 19:44.480
Now you can see us.

19:44.480 --> 19:47.480
Do we look like we're rolling in cash?

19:47.480 --> 19:55.840
No, but we will be using money to buy nominal upgrades and kind of keep our website running

19:55.840 --> 19:56.840
and things like that.

19:56.840 --> 19:57.840
So it's good.

19:57.840 --> 19:59.240
Is this just a facade?

19:59.240 --> 20:01.520
It's really in our mansion that you just don't see.

20:01.520 --> 20:03.080
It's my fucking mansion.

20:03.080 --> 20:04.080
Here's the thing.

20:04.080 --> 20:05.960
I will put it this way.

20:05.960 --> 20:08.000
In the interest transparency, I will say this.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.880
I was paying out of pocket to run VOG before.

20:11.880 --> 20:12.880
And Bobby was too.

20:12.880 --> 20:13.880
It's not just poor me.

20:13.880 --> 20:14.920
Bobby was too.

20:14.920 --> 20:18.240
We've all put in money here or there or whatever.

20:18.240 --> 20:23.320
But now the nice thing is I'm not paying out of pocket to keep a radio feed running anymore

20:23.320 --> 20:24.960
to deliver this show.

20:24.960 --> 20:27.800
We're able to do that and so forth.

20:27.800 --> 20:31.880
Some of the fees for running a business, and you'd be surprised, it costs money to have

20:31.880 --> 20:33.720
an official business.

20:33.720 --> 20:38.480
Some of that money was being fronted by folks, and now your stuff has gone to that a little

20:38.480 --> 20:40.040
bit, which is really nice.

20:40.040 --> 20:42.520
So you know, it all goes to that.

20:42.520 --> 20:46.520
Looking in chat, Sia Tabiri in chat says, you guys don't look like you're rolling pennies

20:46.520 --> 20:47.520
though.

20:47.520 --> 20:49.520
Well, it's something we should start doing.

20:49.520 --> 20:53.680
It's because they're all on my nightstand, just like pouring over.

20:53.680 --> 20:55.440
One bit at a time.

20:55.440 --> 20:58.640
Act Def says, I really need to get back to streaming Pokemon Go.

20:58.640 --> 21:01.040
The Twitch Pokemon Go community needs more representatives.

21:01.040 --> 21:05.880
Yeah, if you think there's a game that isn't being streamed enough on Twitch, by golly

21:05.880 --> 21:06.880
do it.

21:06.880 --> 21:07.880
This is a True Facts.

21:07.880 --> 21:14.640
I was streaming Dragon Quest earlier this week, not Dragon Quest 11, but the original

21:14.640 --> 21:15.640
Dragon Quest.

21:15.640 --> 21:17.880
Because you might remember on last week's show, we talked about the HD remakes are coming

21:17.880 --> 21:18.880
out same day, right?

21:18.880 --> 21:19.880
Right.

21:19.880 --> 21:23.480
So I jumped on that original Dragon Quest game, which of course was Dragon Warrior on

21:23.480 --> 21:27.520
the NES here in the US, but we know that was a regional thing.

21:27.520 --> 21:31.360
So I was streaming that and I was using the Dragon Warrior tag because there was no Dragon

21:31.360 --> 21:32.360
Quest one.

21:32.360 --> 21:33.360
So he's Dragon Warrior.

21:33.360 --> 21:38.240
And somebody brand new found my stream and was like, hey, what do you think of the remake?

21:38.240 --> 21:43.360
I was asking me questions about it and he was like, I can't believe only two people

21:43.360 --> 21:44.920
are streaming this right now.

21:44.920 --> 21:47.960
I follow this tag because I love this game.

21:47.960 --> 21:49.920
He's like, I play this game once a month.

21:49.920 --> 21:51.560
And I'm like, are you speed runner or something?

21:51.560 --> 21:53.520
He's like, no, I just enjoy it.

21:53.520 --> 21:54.780
And I'm like, you know what?

21:54.780 --> 21:57.700
You never know who out there is going to appreciate that thing.

21:57.700 --> 21:58.700
Who would have thought?

21:58.700 --> 22:02.060
There's like a Dragon Warrior one hardcore stand out.

22:02.060 --> 22:04.620
There's more than one, I'm sure that really appreciates that stuff.

22:04.620 --> 22:07.940
I would have never known if I hadn't just said, oh, I want to play this cause the HD

22:07.940 --> 22:08.940
remake.

22:08.940 --> 22:09.940
And I remember this as a kid.

22:09.940 --> 22:10.940
Maybe it's really cool.

22:10.940 --> 22:11.940
Yeah.

22:11.940 --> 22:12.940
It's pretty cool.

22:12.940 --> 22:13.940
Yeah.

22:13.940 --> 22:14.940
Anyway.

22:14.940 --> 22:15.940
Um, let's see.

22:15.940 --> 22:16.940
Was there anything else I wanted to talk about for TwitchCon?

22:16.940 --> 22:17.940
Did I miss anything, uh, on the TwitchCon front?

22:17.940 --> 22:21.740
I guess we talked about some of the redesign things and the ad stuff and some of the, it's

22:21.740 --> 22:22.860
going to be like easier to stream.

22:22.940 --> 22:26.180
They're going to let you subscribe via mobile, which I guess is kind of cool.

22:26.180 --> 22:27.180
So you can do that.

22:27.180 --> 22:33.380
Um, and, uh, some changes coming to like moderator views if you do that and then yeah, the channel

22:33.380 --> 22:34.380
points.

22:34.380 --> 22:35.380
So kind of neat.

22:35.380 --> 22:42.420
I was a little bit disappointed though, that they did not give any follow up on the like

22:42.420 --> 22:47.140
multi stream or being able to stream with other people, kind of like what Mixer does

22:47.140 --> 22:52.620
natively and, um, on Twitch, I think partners can do it, but I was hoping they would roll

22:52.620 --> 22:55.580
that out of the affiliate level and there wasn't anything like that at TwitchCon.

22:55.580 --> 23:00.660
So I was a little sad about that, but obviously it's like one of those, this is my wishlist,

23:00.660 --> 23:01.660
my pie in the sky thing.

23:01.660 --> 23:05.380
And you know, okay, we didn't get that this time, maybe in the future, who knows?

23:05.380 --> 23:12.180
So anyway, um, and Bobby's pointing out how the removal of some tags has really hurt some

23:12.180 --> 23:16.220
people saying there used to be a virtual reality tag and that brought me viewers, but they

23:16.220 --> 23:17.220
killed it.

23:17.220 --> 23:21.900
The VR streaming community is actually abandoning Twitch over it.

23:21.900 --> 23:24.860
That's been like, I'm trying to remember, like when I was doing streaming for like my

23:24.860 --> 23:29.220
live development stuff during that game jam, I had these science and technology cause there's

23:29.220 --> 23:35.540
nothing for like coding or game dev or something like that, which is weird.

23:35.540 --> 23:39.540
Now rum, jump, stomp and chat with a fair counterpoint says you can do that.

23:39.540 --> 23:44.740
The multi streaming thing with a site called multi Twitch, I recognize that and I respect

23:44.740 --> 23:45.740
that.

23:45.740 --> 23:47.060
However, here's the problem.

23:47.060 --> 23:51.220
When it's not natively built into Twitch, this means that you have to go to this multi

23:51.220 --> 23:55.580
Twitch thing to be able to view it the way you want to see it, which you can only do

23:55.580 --> 23:57.320
from like a computer, right?

23:57.320 --> 24:02.660
But part of what makes Twitch really awesome and part of why I love broadcasting on it

24:02.660 --> 24:10.740
is that you can get Twitch on your PC, your Mac, your PlayStation, your Xbox, your mobile,

24:10.740 --> 24:11.740
and so on.

24:11.740 --> 24:14.600
You just can't get it on the Switch yet, but you know what I mean?

24:14.600 --> 24:18.840
So you can't do like multi Twitch on mobile, you can't do on PS4.

24:18.840 --> 24:21.200
So whereas it's like, okay, that's a good band-aid.

24:21.200 --> 24:26.260
It's not really giving that full functionality that I'd like to see if that makes sense.

24:26.260 --> 24:30.560
So anyway, yeah, everyone jumps, Tom says it isn't as good as native.

24:30.560 --> 24:31.560
I agree.

24:31.560 --> 24:32.560
Yeah.

24:32.560 --> 24:33.560
So we agree on that part.

24:33.560 --> 24:34.680
So anyway, so that's a little bit about TwitchCon.

24:34.680 --> 24:37.600
I hope those of you that went and had a great time and I really look forward to being able

24:37.600 --> 24:38.600
to go next year.

24:38.600 --> 24:40.600
Although I feel like I'm going to be the oldest one there.

24:40.600 --> 24:46.560
If I go, Angel, did you see, did you see, are there, are there people on Medicare?

24:46.560 --> 24:48.680
Because they're 65 and older and they're streaming.

24:48.680 --> 24:53.800
Do you see, was Wilford Brimley at TwitchCon or am I going to be the oldest one there if

24:53.800 --> 24:54.800
I go?

24:54.800 --> 24:59.360
Is that grandma Skyrim one that she's streaming Twitch?

24:59.360 --> 25:02.280
If I go with you, I'll be older than you.

25:02.280 --> 25:03.280
Yes.

25:03.280 --> 25:06.280
So whatever.

25:06.280 --> 25:10.460
That's you know, one thing I really, really like about DragonCon is that there really

25:10.460 --> 25:11.880
is an age spread.

25:11.880 --> 25:15.440
I mean, yeah, I see a lot of people in their twenties and thirties, but there's quite a

25:15.440 --> 25:19.320
damn lot of people that go to DragonCon that are in their forties and fifties.

25:19.320 --> 25:21.240
And honestly, I think even older than that.

25:21.240 --> 25:25.040
So that's another, you know, obviously I'm a huge DragonCon fan at this point, but that

25:25.040 --> 25:28.760
is one real reason I really love that con because you just, you get the spread of everything

25:28.760 --> 25:29.760
there.

25:29.760 --> 25:30.760
So anyway.

25:30.760 --> 25:31.760
All right.

25:31.760 --> 25:32.760
Let's move on.

25:32.760 --> 25:33.760
Enough about TwitchCon.

25:33.760 --> 25:36.120
Let's talk a little bit about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have

25:36.120 --> 25:38.440
been playing this week.

25:38.440 --> 25:40.760
Dark Sakura, you've been gone for a couple of weeks.

25:40.760 --> 25:41.760
How was your gaming week?

25:41.760 --> 25:42.760
What'd you do?

25:43.000 --> 25:46.520
I have been playing a lot of patterned on Apple Arcade.

25:46.520 --> 25:51.080
I really, really have been enjoying what I got on Apple Arcade, except there's this one

25:51.080 --> 25:53.120
game that I thought I was going to like.

25:53.120 --> 25:56.240
And so far the beginning of it is just like ridiculously boring.

25:56.240 --> 25:58.960
It's the one that Square Enix did.

25:58.960 --> 25:59.960
Hold on.

25:59.960 --> 26:00.960
I'll get the name of it.

26:00.960 --> 26:01.960
Various Day Life.

26:01.960 --> 26:02.960
Yeah.

26:02.960 --> 26:03.960
I'm kind of bored with it already.

26:03.960 --> 26:10.400
But I've been playing patterned and I sort of pinball wizard, which the physics in it

26:10.400 --> 26:11.400
are unique.

26:11.400 --> 26:15.160
I don't really care for it that much.

26:15.160 --> 26:18.360
Is the Apple Arcade thing free if you get a new phone or am I mixing it up with Apple

26:18.360 --> 26:19.360
TV?

26:19.360 --> 26:20.360
Or Apple TV Plus?

26:20.360 --> 26:21.880
Apple TV Plus for a year.

26:21.880 --> 26:22.880
Okay.

26:22.880 --> 26:23.880
I'm mixing it up.

26:23.880 --> 26:24.880
Never mind.

26:24.880 --> 26:27.860
Apple Arcade has a one month free trial and after that it's $4.99 a month.

26:27.860 --> 26:31.640
But if you've got family sharing, your entire family uses the one sub.

26:31.640 --> 26:32.640
Yeah.

26:32.640 --> 26:34.320
I was going to say, because we talked a little bit about Apple Arcade, I think last week

26:34.320 --> 26:35.320
when you weren't here.

26:35.320 --> 26:37.960
But I was like the $5, that's lower than I was expecting.

26:37.960 --> 26:38.960
I would have thought $10.

26:38.960 --> 26:39.960
So interesting.

26:39.960 --> 26:45.920
I really enjoyed Tint and I played a little bit of Sayonara Wild Hearts.

26:45.920 --> 26:48.160
I had a whole thing on that game last week.

26:48.160 --> 26:49.160
I love that game.

26:49.160 --> 26:50.160
It's really pretty.

26:50.160 --> 26:54.280
I downloaded Shinsekai and I really am looking forward to playing that.

26:54.280 --> 26:59.880
I got Cat Quest 2 and I'm probably, I got Shantae, but now that we've updated my Apple

26:59.880 --> 27:03.040
TV, I'm probably going to be playing it on Apple TV.

27:03.040 --> 27:09.120
So if I can get everything set up, I might actually be streaming from my Apple TV.

27:09.120 --> 27:10.120
Why not?

27:10.120 --> 27:11.120
For Apple Arcade stuff.

27:11.120 --> 27:14.680
And then I got Oceanhorn 2, but I've got so many things on my plate.

27:14.680 --> 27:20.920
I also went through Detroit Become Human so I could watch The Good Story.

27:20.920 --> 27:22.600
Holy shit.

27:22.600 --> 27:26.840
How come I never touched that game before or never watched anything about it?

27:26.840 --> 27:27.840
That game is fucking amazing.

27:27.840 --> 27:30.440
It took me like two years to find Mass Effect.

27:30.440 --> 27:31.440
No longer than that.

27:31.440 --> 27:33.920
I didn't find Mass Effect until the third game was just about to come out.

27:33.920 --> 27:37.160
And then even after I was like, Jamie, play Mass Effect, Jamie, play Mass Effect.

27:37.200 --> 27:41.040
And then finally after nine months, you were like, okay, I'll play Mass Effect, ooh, Garris.

27:41.040 --> 27:47.120
Oh, look who has a Tumblr with over 10,000 followers about Mass Effect.

27:47.120 --> 27:48.120
You're welcome.

27:48.120 --> 27:50.240
That I haven't looked at in six months.

27:50.240 --> 27:51.960
I finally let it die.

27:51.960 --> 27:55.600
How interesting observation though, because before we talk about Detroit Become Human,

27:55.600 --> 27:58.640
which I know a lot of people really love that game and people that like don't even play

27:58.640 --> 28:02.040
a lot of games, like when I was doing my little survivor game and meeting people, like there

28:02.040 --> 28:05.560
were people like, I don't play a lot of video games, but I love Detroit Become Human.

28:05.560 --> 28:06.840
Like if you have PlayStation 4, you have to play that.

28:06.840 --> 28:10.400
I was like, that's kind of a random one, but sometimes these story driven games are really big.

28:10.400 --> 28:11.400
Oh, it's free now.

28:11.400 --> 28:12.640
So, or it was free.

28:12.640 --> 28:14.680
I think I did grab it during PlayStation Plus.

28:14.680 --> 28:15.680
That's good.

28:15.680 --> 28:19.640
But I want to kind of just, just like an observation, we've been doing this segment, the How Was

28:19.640 --> 28:22.120
Your Gaming Week, a very long time.

28:22.120 --> 28:27.720
And I can't remember the last time you talked about this many games in your gaming week.

28:27.720 --> 28:29.280
Except for the cons.

28:29.280 --> 28:30.280
Okay.

28:30.280 --> 28:31.680
Well, it's just because like...

28:32.120 --> 28:36.440
I'm saying it's a good thing because I'm kind of like, is this because of a subscription

28:36.440 --> 28:38.040
service like Apple Arcade?

28:38.040 --> 28:41.480
Is this like, now that you're at the buffet and you get to try everything, you're just

28:41.480 --> 28:42.480
like...

28:42.480 --> 28:46.360
It's easier for me to do things on my phone until Animal Crossing comes out and I take

28:46.360 --> 28:47.360
the Switch with me.

28:47.360 --> 28:52.800
It's just, there really hasn't been a lot that's like sparked my interest that much.

28:52.800 --> 29:01.160
I mean, I'm looking at shit like, okay, okay, okay, you want to give me something that is

29:01.160 --> 29:08.120
actually going to be interesting and fascinating for my kind of brain.

29:08.120 --> 29:12.840
And the thing I liked about Detroit is the whole psychological aspect to it.

29:12.840 --> 29:16.600
I will admit, I don't think I can do any of the bad playthroughs because they would just

29:16.600 --> 29:17.600
make me sob.

29:17.600 --> 29:19.040
They really would make me sob.

29:19.040 --> 29:22.760
I would play it the same way every time.

29:22.760 --> 29:28.240
But it was just such a really, really good story and I think that I need more narrative

29:28.240 --> 29:32.720
games like that to really keep me into it.

29:32.720 --> 29:40.320
I also went back and watched the Kara demo because I had watched that before and I thought

29:40.320 --> 29:41.600
that was really interesting.

29:41.600 --> 29:47.400
And I had interest in that game when they announced it and then I was just sort of like

29:47.400 --> 29:50.560
very blase about my gaming.

29:50.560 --> 29:56.200
We did also get Link's Awakening, which Dan has now beat twice, regular mode and hero

29:56.200 --> 29:58.080
mode.

29:58.080 --> 30:02.400
And it's cool, it's pretty, I love the music in it.

30:02.400 --> 30:04.520
What do you think about it compared to the Game Boy version?

30:04.520 --> 30:06.480
It doesn't feel like an old game.

30:06.480 --> 30:07.480
It feels like a brand new game.

30:07.480 --> 30:11.480
I lost interest in the Game Boy version really early on, I'll be honest, when it was new.

30:11.480 --> 30:14.480
I didn't enjoy playing it that much.

30:14.480 --> 30:17.320
But I really enjoy this one.

30:17.320 --> 30:18.320
The music is great.

30:18.320 --> 30:23.140
It's got the quirkiness and it's made me go back in and do comparisons on things.

30:23.140 --> 30:30.040
And even though Totaka didn't work on this game, all of the easter eggs for Totaka's

30:30.040 --> 30:33.760
theme from the Japanese version are even in the US one.

30:33.760 --> 30:39.400
So if you put in your name as Totakeke, you get the, in fact I put a little video up on

30:39.400 --> 30:43.680
it I think on my Instagram, but you get a jazzy version of it.

30:43.680 --> 30:47.420
If you put your name in a Zelda you get like a really jazzy version of the old Legend of

30:47.420 --> 30:48.420
Zelda theme.

30:48.420 --> 30:53.380
Then if you go into the Prince's place, he was from a game called The Frog for Whom the

30:53.380 --> 30:55.820
Bell Tolls, rough translation of it.

30:55.820 --> 31:00.420
But if you go into the Prince's house and he's got all the frogs everywhere, if you

31:00.420 --> 31:04.380
just hang around there for a little while after all and play Totaka's theme.

31:04.380 --> 31:06.620
I noticed that the mayor from Sim City was in the game.

31:06.620 --> 31:08.620
I was like, which, or Dr. Wright.

31:08.620 --> 31:09.620
Dr. Wright.

31:09.620 --> 31:10.620
Dr. Wright, yeah.

31:10.620 --> 31:11.620
Dr. Wright, yeah.

31:11.620 --> 31:13.340
But who kind of looks like Will Wright actually.

31:13.340 --> 31:14.700
But a little bit.

31:14.700 --> 31:16.140
Will Wright obviously doesn't have green hair.

31:16.140 --> 31:20.380
But I was like, wow, it's weird that they put him in that game.

31:20.380 --> 31:21.380
Kirby.

31:21.380 --> 31:22.380
Cool.

31:22.380 --> 31:23.380
Kirby's still there.

31:23.380 --> 31:24.380
Oh really?

31:24.380 --> 31:25.380
Shy guys are still there.

31:25.380 --> 31:26.380
Yeah.

31:26.380 --> 31:27.500
You got the Chain Chomps in there.

31:27.500 --> 31:33.900
The thing that's cool is that they have, like in the crane game you get I think other types

31:33.900 --> 31:38.220
of figures for Mario enemies.

31:38.220 --> 31:40.220
And you can place them in people's houses.

31:40.220 --> 31:43.260
They have like little pots and stands for them.

31:43.260 --> 31:45.980
And that was really cool.

31:45.980 --> 31:49.300
And Dan was doing just the fishing game and got a blooper.

31:49.300 --> 31:51.700
I think I put a picture of that up on my Instagram too.

31:51.700 --> 31:54.960
It's almost like Link's Awakening is almost in some ways like a Zelda parody game.

31:54.960 --> 31:57.340
Did you ever watch The Gaming Historian about that one?

31:57.340 --> 31:58.340
No.

31:58.340 --> 32:03.700
It's really worth a watch because basically they started off making the game just to see

32:03.700 --> 32:06.460
if it would be possible to make a Legend of Zelda game on the Game Boy.

32:06.460 --> 32:08.660
It was sort of a what if.

32:08.660 --> 32:11.740
And this was like their after hours personal project.

32:11.740 --> 32:14.140
And then it actually got the right attention.

32:14.140 --> 32:15.860
They pitched it as a game.

32:15.860 --> 32:18.660
And basically their whole thing was, well, it's on Game Boy.

32:18.660 --> 32:19.660
No one's going to care.

32:19.660 --> 32:21.800
Let's put what we want in it.

32:21.800 --> 32:24.420
That was like literally it.

32:24.420 --> 32:30.720
And so like that's why you've got like Kirby's enemies and you have like really weird puzzles.

32:30.720 --> 32:32.540
Like I love the chess puzzles.

32:32.540 --> 32:36.020
It's basically if you pick up a knight piece, you have to throw it the way a knight moves

32:36.020 --> 32:37.940
on a chess board.

32:37.940 --> 32:40.260
And the puzzles in that one are really creative.

32:40.260 --> 32:43.860
You know, just really, really clever.

32:43.860 --> 32:47.660
And I like the really cutesy art style.

32:47.660 --> 32:52.500
And the other thing that's pretty neat about it too, you know, and I'm not going to spoil

32:52.500 --> 32:55.300
it if no one ever knows how that game is supposed to end.

32:55.300 --> 32:57.540
And if you do, then whatever.

32:57.540 --> 32:58.920
It's a, you know, old game.

32:58.920 --> 32:59.920
I don't care.

32:59.920 --> 33:01.180
I'm not still going to spoil it.

33:01.180 --> 33:07.540
But the art styles, it kind of does to me this, like with the intro video and then the

33:07.540 --> 33:13.640
ending video, it almost has a kind of Wizard of Oz vibe to me in the changes in the art

33:13.640 --> 33:14.680
style.

33:14.680 --> 33:16.480
I'll leave it at that.

33:16.480 --> 33:22.160
It's like you've transitioned from one aspect of the story to the other and back.

33:22.160 --> 33:25.920
So I really enjoyed it.

33:25.920 --> 33:27.600
Toad's in the game, of course, but he doesn't.

33:27.600 --> 33:29.240
Not Toad, Wart.

33:29.240 --> 33:30.240
He doesn't get by Wart.

33:30.240 --> 33:32.240
And the singing is absolutely terrible.

33:32.240 --> 33:33.240
I love it.

33:33.240 --> 33:34.640
It was very well done.

33:34.640 --> 33:36.360
I was very happy with it.

33:36.360 --> 33:39.000
And I loved going around finding the Easter eggs.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
And then I cried about the ghost.

33:41.000 --> 33:44.040
It was just sad.

33:44.040 --> 33:48.680
And I like when you can throw the monkeys out of the trees because they're assholes.

33:48.680 --> 33:52.760
So you played this game very thoroughly in the past couple of weeks.

33:52.760 --> 33:56.320
Dan mostly did, because he wanted to go through hero mode.

33:56.320 --> 34:03.480
So but sometimes you need your wife there saying, you need to look at the map.

34:03.480 --> 34:05.220
Backseat driving, basically.

34:05.220 --> 34:08.560
We're turning this link around.

34:08.560 --> 34:13.600
So and I mean, I've been doing my usual Animal Crossing.

34:13.600 --> 34:17.160
I finally got my levels high enough in idle pouring to rebirth.

34:17.160 --> 34:20.640
And now I can't beat fucking Osiris to do the rebirth.

34:20.640 --> 34:21.640
So like, whatever.

34:21.640 --> 34:24.540
So I have to keep leveling so I can rebirth.

34:24.540 --> 34:29.280
So I'm actually getting really tired of playing that game, and I'm probably not going to renew

34:29.280 --> 34:31.920
my sub after it expires.

34:31.920 --> 34:36.560
I'm just getting really tired of it.

34:36.560 --> 34:44.720
I've been doing Pokemon and Harry Potter and oh, but patterned to me is one of the

34:44.720 --> 34:47.700
best games on Apple TV, not Apple TV, but Apple Arcade.

34:47.700 --> 34:48.700
It is absolutely.

34:48.700 --> 34:49.700
What are you doing this game?

34:49.700 --> 34:50.700
It's a puzzle game?

34:50.700 --> 34:54.480
It's a puzzle game, but it's kind of unique.

34:54.480 --> 35:00.720
It's a tiled, you know, like wallpaper, like a tiled picture where it's seamless, right?

35:00.720 --> 35:07.240
But when you get the picture, it sketches, and you have different cut out pieces that

35:07.240 --> 35:09.920
match the different parts of the sketch.

35:09.920 --> 35:13.960
And as you move that piece in, it fills in color and it gets more and more opaque, the

35:13.960 --> 35:19.760
more and more pieces that you bring in until you finish the whole piece.

35:19.760 --> 35:22.480
And I actually put video up somewhere.

35:22.480 --> 35:25.400
I will see if I can find that video.

35:25.400 --> 35:27.900
I'll put it up on my Instagram and link it in chat.

35:27.900 --> 35:33.020
So just like, you know, an example of moving a piece and so you can see what it looks like.

35:33.020 --> 35:34.940
So I'll put that up in just a few minutes.

35:34.940 --> 35:39.640
But yeah, that's been that's kind of like for me, my shining star, that and Tint, which

35:39.640 --> 35:44.140
is another puzzle game where you start off with your primary colors, but you have to

35:44.140 --> 35:48.420
mix them through one other color and get to your gold that matches this little flower

35:48.420 --> 35:50.760
that's going to bloom and take on the next piece of the puzzle.

35:50.760 --> 35:55.940
So it's using primary colors to create secondary colors, but sometimes you have to avoid another

35:55.940 --> 36:01.780
color because if you cross a second color, it'll turn that mud gray color when you've

36:01.780 --> 36:03.080
oversaturated.

36:03.080 --> 36:05.160
So it's it's a pretty neat little game.

36:05.160 --> 36:08.260
So those two are like probably my shining stars for Apple Arcade right now.

36:08.260 --> 36:09.260
OK, great.

36:09.260 --> 36:10.260
All right.

36:10.260 --> 36:13.140
Well, you had a very busy past couple weeks.

36:13.140 --> 36:15.600
Mine was not mine was not nearly as busy.

36:15.600 --> 36:17.740
I'm drinking out of underwear, OK?

36:17.740 --> 36:21.280
Oh, I grabbed a cup and I was like, oh, this is a niche.

36:21.280 --> 36:22.280
It's underwear.

36:22.280 --> 36:24.860
You can show it on the Twitch stream for our folks that are watching there.

36:24.860 --> 36:26.600
I don't remember where that came from.

36:26.600 --> 36:30.860
I think it was like a joke gift that that Alan got or something.

36:30.860 --> 36:31.860
I don't remember.

36:31.860 --> 36:32.860
It says Pansu.

36:32.860 --> 36:33.860
Yeah.

36:33.860 --> 36:34.860
All right.

36:34.860 --> 36:36.100
Loki, how was your gaming week?

36:36.100 --> 36:44.420
Well, I did also play Legend of Zelda Link's Awakening, not because I was like actually

36:44.420 --> 36:49.780
playing is because my son won my my youngest son's been playing it and I've been helping

36:49.780 --> 36:53.420
him with the parts that he can't do, which means I've played through like the dungeons

36:53.420 --> 36:54.420
basically.

36:54.420 --> 36:55.420
It's fun.

36:55.420 --> 37:00.320
I'm noticing a lot of slowdown, though, as everyone's kind of pointed out.

37:00.320 --> 37:02.180
But it's a decent game.

37:02.180 --> 37:07.140
So it'd be fun to actually go back and play it on my own at some point.

37:07.140 --> 37:10.380
The game, though, I did play on my own was Untitled Goose Game.

37:10.380 --> 37:14.420
So I did finish that and then got the second set of challenges.

37:14.420 --> 37:16.540
And I'm like halfway through those.

37:16.540 --> 37:20.340
But there's some that I get the speed run, which I'm like, what do you think?

37:20.340 --> 37:23.020
Because I feel like everybody has gotten around to playing this game except for me.

37:23.020 --> 37:26.420
Like Bobby did it by Bobby did a live stream this week.

37:26.420 --> 37:29.420
And Shane has been telling me I need to play this game, but I just I just didn't get around

37:29.420 --> 37:30.420
to it.

37:30.420 --> 37:31.500
I've had a lot of other stuff going on.

37:31.500 --> 37:32.500
It's really fun.

37:32.500 --> 37:33.500
Yeah.

37:33.500 --> 37:34.500
Yeah.

37:34.500 --> 37:35.500
Why?

37:35.500 --> 37:36.500
Why?

37:36.500 --> 37:37.500
Because you're a complete asshole to everybody.

37:37.500 --> 37:40.980
And then once you get done with the game, you find out that the whole objective of the

37:40.980 --> 37:44.780
game is just being a complete asshole.

37:44.780 --> 37:48.060
And that's that's just like the best part of that.

37:48.060 --> 37:50.700
Apparently, it is still 15 bucks.

37:50.700 --> 37:54.100
And this may be the reason I make an epic account.

37:54.100 --> 38:03.780
Well, it's also on sale on on the switch, which I can play on my Mac.

38:03.780 --> 38:08.420
But yeah, so it's fun to be an asshole to everybody in the town.

38:08.420 --> 38:11.260
It's great that on the back of the box and it's great to be an asshole.

38:11.260 --> 38:15.900
It's great because like you just like like the way the goose looks at people and stuff

38:15.900 --> 38:20.300
and the way people like look frustrated at it and you're just like.

38:20.300 --> 38:26.180
What the fuck you want, you know, honk exactly like what the fuck you want.

38:26.180 --> 38:30.780
So basically, can we just download a new skin for the goose that is just Mr. Smoosh?

38:30.780 --> 38:35.060
Because I feel like there's lots of other asshole animals that would work very well

38:35.060 --> 38:36.060
in this game.

38:36.060 --> 38:37.060
Yes.

38:37.060 --> 38:38.060
It's an excellent game.

38:38.060 --> 38:39.060
So I have a lot of fun.

38:39.060 --> 38:43.180
It is a very long game, but it's fun because you can kind of do whatever you want in there,

38:43.180 --> 38:46.940
especially when you get later on into the game and you have some of those new challenges

38:46.940 --> 38:50.980
that open up once you finish the game that require you to use stuff that's kind of not

38:50.980 --> 38:52.220
specific to a certain level.

38:52.220 --> 38:56.340
You see it to kind of move around the whole map and it kind of changes things up.

38:56.340 --> 39:03.460
Plus the last mission of it, it's like you'd be very stealthy because you have a, you know,

39:03.460 --> 39:04.460
some spoil.

39:04.460 --> 39:05.460
Yeah.

39:05.460 --> 39:08.160
You're making lots of noise and everybody's out to look for you now.

39:08.160 --> 39:13.440
So it's, it's kind of like a little Metal Gear Solid action going on there, but, um,

39:13.440 --> 39:18.220
I had, I had quite a bit of fun playing the game, so I hope that there's more at some

39:18.220 --> 39:23.560
point and, um, I really hope that, uh, I actually get around to finishing it.

39:23.560 --> 39:28.360
I don't know what the very, very last objective is, but I know the speed running ones are

39:28.360 --> 39:29.360
gonna be hard.

39:29.360 --> 39:30.360
All right.

39:30.360 --> 39:31.360
That's it.

39:31.360 --> 39:32.360
That's it.

39:32.360 --> 39:33.360
All right.

39:33.360 --> 39:34.360
My gaming week.

39:34.360 --> 39:35.360
Not as exciting as everyone else's.

39:35.360 --> 39:38.760
I didn't really get around to doing new stuff cause I was still playing the good old, uh,

39:38.760 --> 39:41.040
mobile games like Pokemon Go and Ingress.

39:41.040 --> 39:45.140
There's going to be a very interesting week in Ingress because Scanner redacted the old

39:45.140 --> 39:46.140
version of the app.

39:46.140 --> 39:50.540
The one that many people are still clinging to after all this time, uh, closes tomorrow

39:50.540 --> 39:53.480
and they, they say they really are pulling the plug on redacted tomorrow.

39:53.480 --> 39:54.760
So you're going to have to use Ingress primes.

39:54.760 --> 39:58.640
It's going to be very interesting to see because a lot of people are threatening to quit with

39:58.640 --> 39:59.640
that.

39:59.640 --> 40:03.120
So I don't, we'll see what happens if people really do quit or they just need to scratch

40:03.120 --> 40:05.560
the itch of taking over their neighborhood park or what.

40:05.560 --> 40:08.620
So I'll be very curious to see where that game is in about a week, especially with a

40:08.620 --> 40:11.840
big event coming up right here in Sacramento on the 12th.

40:11.840 --> 40:14.720
So that will only be playable in the new scanner, which is interesting.

40:14.720 --> 40:15.720
Hmm.

40:15.720 --> 40:16.720
Uh, so there's that.

40:16.720 --> 40:20.040
Uh, otherwise I've been continuing on in classic wow.

40:20.040 --> 40:21.040
Uh, believe it.

40:21.040 --> 40:22.560
I'm still playing classic world of Warcraft.

40:22.560 --> 40:25.680
My priest is up to level 20 or yeah, 21.

40:25.680 --> 40:28.120
I did a dead minds run on Saturday.

40:28.120 --> 40:32.640
Now here's the thing, like now if you play retail wow and you do the dead minds, you'll

40:32.640 --> 40:33.640
get through it.

40:33.640 --> 40:37.400
And like 15 minutes, like you just, you pull your face, pull everything.

40:37.400 --> 40:38.400
It's super easy.

40:38.400 --> 40:39.400
Right?

40:39.400 --> 40:40.400
Oh my God.

40:40.400 --> 40:41.400
Classic.

40:41.400 --> 40:42.400
Wow.

40:42.400 --> 40:44.400
Is a humble reminder of really how much the game has changed, especially when it comes

40:44.400 --> 40:48.800
to like quality of life, things like having a fucking map to get you through the dungeon

40:48.800 --> 40:54.440
or not having to wait for the priest to drink after every single fight because she's out

40:54.440 --> 40:57.080
of manna, which was happening to me all the time.

40:57.080 --> 41:02.560
It took us, I shit you not two hours to get through dead minds, but I remember back in

41:02.560 --> 41:04.040
the, I remember running that.

41:04.040 --> 41:07.880
Dead minds is the very first instance, like group thing you do in world of Warcraft.

41:07.880 --> 41:11.680
And I remember years ago, back in the day, that's how long it took.

41:11.680 --> 41:12.900
Like that was your evening.

41:12.900 --> 41:15.020
That was your D and D campaign for the night.

41:15.020 --> 41:16.480
We're going to go to the dead minds.

41:16.480 --> 41:17.480
Who needs to raid?

41:17.480 --> 41:18.480
I know.

41:18.480 --> 41:19.480
Right.

41:19.480 --> 41:20.480
So that was.

41:20.480 --> 41:21.480
Yeah.

41:21.480 --> 41:22.480
Anyhow.

41:22.480 --> 41:29.840
Um, so, uh, yeah, uh, that was a nice little humble taste of what things used to be like

41:29.840 --> 41:32.120
and well, but it's interesting because I was doing that.

41:32.120 --> 41:34.480
And then I was like, maybe I should go back and play a little retail.

41:34.480 --> 41:35.480
Wow.

41:35.480 --> 41:39.360
But I still really love my other MMO final fantasy 14.

41:39.360 --> 41:44.440
And I'm up to level, I don't know, like 75 or something like that.

41:44.440 --> 41:47.880
So yeah.

41:47.880 --> 41:51.060
I'm almost max level on two different job classes.

41:51.060 --> 41:52.060
So that's really fun.

41:52.060 --> 41:53.060
Yeah.

41:53.060 --> 41:57.720
Otherwise that's, I haven't, Oh, I've been playing a little bit of Diablo three on switch.

41:57.720 --> 41:58.840
Very random.

41:58.840 --> 42:03.480
But do you know, I've never played a necromancer in Diablo three and I finally did on the switch

42:03.480 --> 42:06.300
version because I never bought that PC upgrade.

42:06.300 --> 42:09.520
I said I wasn't going to, because I didn't want them putting out a half-assed expansion

42:09.520 --> 42:10.520
and I never did.

42:10.520 --> 42:12.980
But then of course I like quadruple dipped on Diablo three.

42:12.980 --> 42:16.140
So w wait for me to show him a lesson, huh?

42:16.140 --> 42:20.440
So I've, I picked that up and, uh, uh, on switch, I had bought it a while ago, but I

42:20.440 --> 42:21.440
was picking it up and playing it again.

42:21.440 --> 42:23.440
I was like, I should do a necromancer for this season.

42:23.440 --> 42:28.360
So it's like the first time I'm finally playing that class and a exploding corpses is fun.

42:28.920 --> 42:30.240
That's what necromancers do.

42:30.240 --> 42:31.240
Explode corpses.

42:31.240 --> 42:32.240
All right.

42:32.240 --> 42:33.240
Yay.

42:33.240 --> 42:34.240
Yay.

42:34.240 --> 42:35.240
So that's, that's pretty much my gaming week.

42:35.240 --> 42:37.360
So we'll move on and get into some gaming news.

42:37.360 --> 42:38.360
Some housekeeping.

42:38.360 --> 42:43.640
Uh, I don't think we're going to be here pretty much every week, but we will not have a show

42:43.640 --> 42:44.640
live.

42:44.640 --> 42:50.160
I, I have to talk to my lovely co-hosts about taping something during the week in advance,

42:50.160 --> 42:57.240
but we will not have a show live the week of October 20th.

42:57.240 --> 43:00.960
And we won't have one live the week of November.

43:00.960 --> 43:02.080
I think it's night.

43:02.080 --> 43:06.640
Uh, those dates may not be exact, uh, reason why I had a work thing come up at the end

43:06.640 --> 43:07.640
of October.

43:07.640 --> 43:08.640
So I'm not going to be here.

43:08.640 --> 43:10.600
Uh, and, uh, November is my trip to New York.

43:10.600 --> 43:12.260
I'm going to go see Broadway plays.

43:12.260 --> 43:15.720
So on when OLR would usually be on, I'm going to go see Moulin Rouge.

43:15.720 --> 43:17.120
I'm really excited about it.

43:17.120 --> 43:21.500
So anyway, uh, yeah, so we'll do some, uh, tapes in it because that worked really well

43:21.500 --> 43:25.120
last time when we did our show, like earlier in the week and then we, um, just premiered

43:25.120 --> 43:26.120
it on Sunday.

43:26.120 --> 43:31.660
Something like that again for you guys, but then episode 800 is like when we're back.

43:31.660 --> 43:36.640
So the next live shot really close to 20 November actually will be episode 800.

43:36.640 --> 43:37.640
So that'll be fun.

43:37.640 --> 43:40.760
So, all right, let's get into some gaming news for this week.

43:40.760 --> 43:42.280
Loki, why don't you start us off?

43:42.280 --> 43:43.280
All right.

43:43.280 --> 43:46.840
So there was the whole PlayStation state of play event that they did online.

43:46.840 --> 43:49.120
So you could definitely watch that.

43:49.120 --> 43:54.960
Um, that is pretty much the last of us part two show because they had a, you know, basically

43:54.960 --> 43:58.560
a big rundown talking about the last of us part two, which is going to be coming out

43:58.560 --> 44:05.240
February 21st, 2020, um, along with that, some other stuff that is going to be coming

44:05.240 --> 44:10.520
civilization six and, um, yeah, I love six, six, six.

44:10.520 --> 44:13.080
So that's coming to the PlayStation four in November 22nd.

44:13.080 --> 44:16.960
I guess I didn't realize it wasn't on play cause it came out on switch and I was like,

44:16.960 --> 44:17.960
that's weird.

44:17.960 --> 44:21.760
They're doing a console release of six, six, six, six was on switch and it was kind of

44:21.760 --> 44:22.760
a big deal when it happened.

44:22.760 --> 44:26.680
Cause I was like, they're putting six, six on consoles, but, uh, well they put it on

44:26.680 --> 44:28.200
the iPad too, to be fair.

44:28.200 --> 44:29.760
So I guess consoles make sense.

44:29.760 --> 44:34.760
Um, so yeah, it's, it's on a switch and now PS4 and I was like, Oh yeah, I guess it would

44:34.760 --> 44:38.600
make sense that if you put it on switch, you probably would just, you know, make it for

44:38.600 --> 44:39.720
PlayStation four.

44:39.720 --> 44:40.720
Where's the Xbox one version?

44:40.720 --> 44:42.760
Cause that seems very likely that's going to happen too.

44:42.760 --> 44:43.760
Who knows?

44:43.760 --> 44:50.400
Coming to the pipeline, I guess, um, they release a demo for the remake of MediEvil.

44:50.400 --> 44:53.480
So you can check that out now and if you play it, which Jason said he was going to

44:53.480 --> 44:54.480
do in the intro.

44:54.480 --> 44:55.480
Yes.

44:55.480 --> 44:58.120
You can get a game for the, or a special item for the full game.

44:58.120 --> 45:04.880
If you actually finish that with, um, before the game comes out next month, um, Death Stranding,

45:04.880 --> 45:10.000
they announced a pro bundle that's coming out November 8th that has like a hand print

45:10.000 --> 45:15.120
design on it that looks like I could have just taken my hand and put it in paint and

45:15.120 --> 45:18.960
just went, I don't know why you've waiting this long to get a PlayStation four if this

45:18.960 --> 45:21.280
game is of interest to you, but shoot yourself.

45:21.280 --> 45:22.280
Maybe it's a collectible.

45:22.280 --> 45:23.280
I don't know.

45:23.280 --> 45:24.280
Sure.

45:24.280 --> 45:29.160
Uh, they had this game called humanity, uh, which I heard people comparing it to intelligent

45:29.160 --> 45:35.260
cube, but I didn't really see that other than, you know, kind of, it's weird though.

45:35.260 --> 45:38.880
It's a weird looking game where they basically have like crowds of people that you have to

45:38.880 --> 45:42.960
kind of shuffle through to certain areas and they could fight each other.

45:42.960 --> 45:46.040
And I don't know, it's really weird, but I like those weird puzzle games.

45:46.040 --> 45:51.520
So that's coming out in 2020, uh, there's a game called the rise, a simple story, which

45:51.520 --> 45:54.960
is an adventure game, um, coming soon, LA noir.

45:54.960 --> 46:01.000
The VR case files are coming out for PlayStation VR, which I'm surprised that hasn't come out

46:01.000 --> 46:02.000
before.

46:02.000 --> 46:07.360
Um, and then they also showed off some other stuff, uh, coming out to PlayStation VR, including

46:07.360 --> 46:10.880
space channel five, kind of funky, uh, newsflash.

46:10.880 --> 46:11.880
Can't wait.

46:11.880 --> 46:12.880
Yep.

46:12.960 --> 46:19.160
And after the fall and aspire one, and then let's see what else, uh, the PlayStation plus

46:19.160 --> 46:25.360
lineup for October is going to be MLB, the show 19 and the last of us remastered to get

46:25.360 --> 46:28.160
you all ready for last of us too.

46:28.160 --> 46:29.160
Well, yeah.

46:29.160 --> 46:36.480
Um, and then finally there was one Tom, which is a new game from the creators of Katamari

46:36.480 --> 46:42.040
Damacy and he's unretired for not making playground anymore.

46:42.080 --> 46:44.520
I have no fucking clue what you do in this game.

46:44.520 --> 46:45.520
I watched the trailer.

46:45.520 --> 46:48.040
I'm like, I don't know what you do in this game.

46:48.040 --> 46:52.400
I looked like more like a nobody, nobody boy than Katamari.

46:52.400 --> 46:58.920
Um, I did see flying golden poops and someone vomited the rainbows, so it already looks

46:58.920 --> 47:00.960
like a game I'm going to check out.

47:00.960 --> 47:01.960
Yeah, this is something I'm into.

47:01.960 --> 47:05.600
I know dark soccer is going to play this, has to play because the Katamari Damacy, nobody,

47:05.600 --> 47:06.600
nobody boy.

47:06.600 --> 47:07.600
Those like two of your favorite games.

47:08.240 --> 47:13.680
Well, nobody, nobody boy on iOS was, I didn't play it too much on the console.

47:13.680 --> 47:15.160
Same, same.

47:15.160 --> 47:16.400
It just looks weird.

47:16.400 --> 47:18.640
And I dig that.

47:18.640 --> 47:21.160
A comment on a what I'm in our chat room.

47:21.160 --> 47:25.360
Uh, Dr Tuya says over at twitch TV slash vog network, though that what I'm game sounds

47:25.360 --> 47:27.920
all about as crazy as Katamari in those games.

47:27.920 --> 47:28.920
Nobody nobody boy.

47:28.920 --> 47:30.240
And I think there was another one.

47:30.240 --> 47:35.440
Um, I don't remember if there was another, there may have been, there were several Katamari

47:35.440 --> 47:36.440
games.

47:36.560 --> 47:37.560
Mobile game.

47:37.560 --> 47:39.640
Nobody, nobody boy was the mobile game at first.

47:39.640 --> 47:41.000
I thought there was another mobile.

47:41.000 --> 47:47.240
There might've been, I forget a lot of people also think that a donut game is them.

47:47.240 --> 47:48.800
No, that's totally different.

47:48.800 --> 47:49.800
Yeah.

47:49.800 --> 47:52.760
It's similar to Katamari, but except it's very linear.

47:52.760 --> 47:58.400
So it's, it's not, I wouldn't say it's the same feel as Katamari cause there's no time

47:58.400 --> 48:00.040
limits or anything like that.

48:00.040 --> 48:05.240
Um, but I don't know, I was trying to see if there was another game that I'm missing

48:05.240 --> 48:06.240
here.

48:06.280 --> 48:13.720
Glitch was a game that he worked on in 2011 and then he had a tenure or tenure Wanya teens

48:13.720 --> 48:14.720
and alphabet.

48:14.720 --> 48:18.280
He was a designer on what is glitch.

48:18.280 --> 48:22.720
Um, a comment quickly on the civ six issue from a metal mayhem in our chat over at twitch

48:22.720 --> 48:26.880
TV slash vog network, metal mayhem says, may as well put civ six on consoles.

48:26.880 --> 48:29.280
After all, not everyone is a PC gamer.

48:29.280 --> 48:30.280
True.

48:30.280 --> 48:33.120
And the civ games are great and should get out to as many people as possible.

48:33.120 --> 48:34.120
So why not?

48:34.120 --> 48:35.120
Yeah.

48:35.120 --> 48:36.120
All right.

48:36.120 --> 48:39.520
Well, if that's it for the, uh, what'd you think overall of PlayStation's a state of

48:39.520 --> 48:40.520
play update?

48:40.520 --> 48:41.520
I thought it was okay.

48:41.520 --> 48:42.520
Yeah.

48:42.520 --> 48:47.880
Apparently the creator of, uh, Katamari he's, um, he moved to San Francisco.

48:47.880 --> 48:48.880
Yeah.

48:48.880 --> 48:49.880
I heard that too.

48:49.880 --> 48:50.880
Living there.

48:50.880 --> 48:51.880
Yeah.

48:51.880 --> 48:52.880
He lives in San Francisco.

48:52.880 --> 48:53.880
Cool.

48:53.880 --> 48:54.880
He has an open invite to come on the show.

48:54.880 --> 48:55.880
Anytime.

48:55.880 --> 48:56.880
We're only a two hour drive away.

48:56.880 --> 48:57.880
Keita Takahashi.

48:57.880 --> 48:58.880
Yeah.

48:58.880 --> 48:59.880
All right.

48:59.880 --> 49:00.880
Anyhow.

49:00.880 --> 49:01.880
Uh, let's move on.

49:01.880 --> 49:06.040
This is going to be seemed like really random as a follow up to a PlayStation state of play,

49:06.040 --> 49:10.720
but this is like one of those, like, what the hell, what, what kind of romper room fuckery

49:10.720 --> 49:14.240
is this going on in the gaming industry up in here on this day?

49:14.240 --> 49:15.240
Okay.

49:15.240 --> 49:21.800
So this has to do with the classic eighties gaming icon, Ms. Pac-Man, not to be confused

49:21.800 --> 49:27.000
with Pac-Man specifically this drama centers around Ms. Pac-Man.

49:27.000 --> 49:32.240
Now there's a nice little summary on what's going on here from Twitter users, Sarah S

49:32.240 --> 49:36.360
sour tea, and I'm reading some of the summary there directly from her Twitter, where it

49:36.360 --> 49:42.240
says, um, uh, in summary at games wanted Ms. Pac-Man.

49:42.240 --> 49:45.720
So at games, at games, make some of those like flashback type content.

49:45.720 --> 49:49.280
Didn't they do the old Genesis things too?

49:49.280 --> 49:50.280
Maybe I think so.

49:50.280 --> 49:52.400
So they, they, they do retro hardware type stuff.

49:52.400 --> 49:53.760
Like that's like their bread and butter.

49:53.760 --> 49:54.760
Okay.

49:54.760 --> 49:56.880
At games wanted Ms. Pac-Man.

49:56.880 --> 49:59.000
Didn't get it because it's complicated.

49:59.000 --> 50:05.480
Went to make a deal with GCC who owns the rights to Ms. Pac-Man and claim they 100%

50:05.480 --> 50:07.280
have those rights to distributors.

50:07.280 --> 50:08.600
And maybe they do.

50:08.600 --> 50:09.600
Maybe they don't.

50:09.600 --> 50:10.600
An exciting story.

50:10.600 --> 50:11.600
Yeah.

50:11.600 --> 50:15.580
At games actually put out a press release through PR news wires.

50:15.580 --> 50:20.880
So this was on September 26 where at game, it says at games cloud holdings, a leader

50:20.880 --> 50:24.740
in interactive entertainment announced that it has acquired all the rights of general

50:24.740 --> 50:30.880
computer corporation, GCC with respect to Ms. Pac-Man's under agreement between GCC

50:30.880 --> 50:32.640
and Bandai Namco.

50:32.640 --> 50:37.440
So here's, I guess what it sounds like is that at games wanted to go to Bandai Namco

50:37.440 --> 50:38.440
to do it.

50:38.440 --> 50:39.760
And they were like, no.

50:39.760 --> 50:45.880
So they went to this GCC general computer corporation who in the text here in their,

50:45.880 --> 50:51.440
in their own press release, Mac game says GCC developed in 1981, certain source code

50:51.440 --> 50:57.440
characters, music, gameplay, and cartoons expressed in various media, including, but

50:57.440 --> 51:04.080
not limited to read only memory ROM used in running Ms. Pac-Man and pack baby sold as

51:04.080 --> 51:09.920
junior Pac-Man games in 1983, GCC entered into an agreement with the predecessor of

51:09.920 --> 51:15.640
Bandai Namco with regard to Ms. Pac-Man, which was later amended in 2008 in an agreement

51:15.640 --> 51:20.540
with Bandai Namco and the former shareholders of GCC who become the successors in interest

51:20.540 --> 51:22.480
to GCC after its dissolution.

51:22.480 --> 51:24.080
If it sounds messy, it's because it is.

51:24.080 --> 51:30.240
So this is essentially says Bandai Namco said, no, they went to the company who helped make

51:30.240 --> 51:35.440
the ROMs of the original game and did like coding and they got it from them.

51:35.440 --> 51:39.040
And because, Oh, they have the license because what does at games do?

51:39.040 --> 51:41.440
They do these retro game devices, right?

51:41.440 --> 51:46.120
So if they get the rights through these retro coding, you know, the code and the actual

51:46.120 --> 51:50.640
like physical, and I guess, you know, the intellectual code and stuff.

51:50.640 --> 51:55.000
Now they're saying they own the rights, but hold on here.

51:55.000 --> 52:00.320
The CEO of at games, I'm sorry if I mispronounced this name, Dr. Ping Kang Seung.

52:00.320 --> 52:01.320
I hope I said that right.

52:01.320 --> 52:05.920
I'm sorry if I didn't says as part of our ongoing initiative to be caretakers of important

52:05.920 --> 52:10.660
cultural touchstones, we are privileged to gain these valuable rights pertaining to the

52:10.660 --> 52:14.380
iconic Ms. Pac-Man arcade game.

52:14.380 --> 52:20.140
Now you want to see, you want to hear how things get even messier.

52:20.140 --> 52:29.120
From gamesindustry.biz on the 25th of September, plug and play game maker at games is facing

52:29.120 --> 52:31.180
another partner in court.

52:31.180 --> 52:36.280
In addition to a trademark infringement from Bandai Namco over Ms. Pac-Man, the company

52:36.280 --> 52:42.240
is embroiled in a lawsuit from Walgreens, the U S pharmacy chains, Walgreens, Walgreens

52:42.240 --> 52:46.480
filed suit against at games for breach of contract in August, saying it had a deal with

52:46.480 --> 52:51.600
the game company that provided products on a guaranteed sale basis, meaning at games

52:51.600 --> 52:57.120
would take any unsold units back and refund the chain, whatever it paid them.

52:57.120 --> 53:01.880
In addition for an additional fee and shipping costs, Walgreens said it returned more than

53:01.880 --> 53:08.600
66,500 units for which it had paid between $15 and $38.

53:08.600 --> 53:10.760
But at games refused to make payment.

53:10.760 --> 53:16.760
As a result, Walgreens, Walgreens claimed it owed nearly 1.62 million from the company.

53:16.760 --> 53:19.840
Again, that story from gamesindustry.biz, if you want to see some of the quotes.

53:19.840 --> 53:23.640
Is this going to end up where Walgreens owns Ms. Pac-Man at some point?

53:23.640 --> 53:24.640
Is this where we're in?

53:24.640 --> 53:25.640
Is this where it's going?

53:25.640 --> 53:27.400
I don't know, but this is weird.

53:27.400 --> 53:30.800
It's certainly like, it seems I am inferring.

53:30.800 --> 53:36.280
I'm not saying this as fact, but in my opinion, and my opinion does not represent those of

53:36.280 --> 53:38.320
VOG Network or my co-hosts.

53:38.320 --> 53:41.080
It sounds like this at games company is a little bit shady.

53:41.080 --> 53:45.880
It just, I'm getting that impression from the fact that they are, mommy said no, so

53:45.880 --> 53:50.720
we're going to go ask daddy and this whole, they're not paying Walgreens for this.

53:50.720 --> 53:52.440
They made some weird deal with Walgreens.

53:52.440 --> 53:54.160
I don't know guys.

53:54.160 --> 53:59.480
It's allegedly sounds crazy.

53:59.480 --> 54:03.120
Dark Titsy in chat says, yeah, this whole thing is nuts.

54:03.120 --> 54:05.880
Snuck in futs.

54:05.880 --> 54:06.880
Exactly.

54:06.880 --> 54:08.960
Which is a good beer by the way.

54:08.960 --> 54:09.960
Yeah.

54:09.960 --> 54:13.880
And by the way, there's another Twitter thread from user Sean Musgrave, who's talking about

54:13.880 --> 54:20.260
the real ass drama going on with at games and the way Sean puts it on Twitter.

54:20.260 --> 54:23.640
They've been pestering Namco for ages for the Ms. Pac-Man license and Namco's turned

54:23.680 --> 54:29.240
them down because of the complicated royalty structures and ownership of that game.

54:29.240 --> 54:33.240
That's interesting to point out too, is that a character like Ms. Pac-Man, it isn't so

54:33.240 --> 54:34.240
cut and dry.

54:34.240 --> 54:38.760
We're like Namco Bando owns this because it does get complicated.

54:38.760 --> 54:39.760
Doesn't it?

54:39.760 --> 54:44.760
Because didn't like Midway or something published that in the U S at one point, like it, it

54:44.760 --> 54:50.640
gets weird when it comes to Ms. Pac-Man because in the eighties video games were just kind

54:50.640 --> 54:52.120
of like done differently.

54:52.120 --> 54:54.280
I don't know how else to explain it.

54:54.280 --> 54:57.960
And so all the deals that were in place were sometimes very straight.

54:57.960 --> 54:59.760
Let's just say what it was.

54:59.760 --> 55:03.460
The games industry was on a lot of cocaine in the 1980s.

55:03.460 --> 55:05.760
And I mean a fucking lot of cocaine.

55:05.760 --> 55:06.760
Okay.

55:06.760 --> 55:10.760
If you watch any documentary about how your favorite Atari Atari games in the 1980s were

55:10.760 --> 55:13.520
made, cocaine was probably involved.

55:13.520 --> 55:14.880
Winners don't use drugs.

55:14.880 --> 55:15.880
Remember that.

55:15.880 --> 55:20.120
However, remember the video game industry crashed under the weight of all that cocaine.

55:20.120 --> 55:22.440
So right.

55:22.440 --> 55:23.440
Am I wrong?

55:23.440 --> 55:24.440
Did I tell any lies?

55:24.440 --> 55:25.440
No, I did not.

55:25.440 --> 55:34.400
So a lot of these, a lot of these deals, cocaine infused deals are really, really strange.

55:34.400 --> 55:41.600
And that's how 5,000 people claim ownership to Ms. Pac-Man anyway, Namco is in discussions

55:41.600 --> 55:45.220
with GCC who developed Ms. Pac-Man trying to buy them out.

55:45.220 --> 55:49.080
So they'd be the full owners of Ms. Pac-Man full stop, but at games went around Namco's

55:49.080 --> 55:52.040
back and was directly negotiated with GCC.

55:52.040 --> 55:55.960
Namco confronted at games about this and they deny it.

55:55.960 --> 56:00.080
Namco is unable to verify if at games has or hasn't bought the rights from GCC.

56:00.080 --> 56:03.200
That was two days before the at games press release when that tweet was written.

56:03.200 --> 56:07.680
So I think we know if at games is saying there now.

56:07.680 --> 56:10.680
So this is, but here's the thing, and this is why I bring this up.

56:10.680 --> 56:13.140
Like sure, it's drama and it's LOL.

56:13.140 --> 56:14.200
This is crazy.

56:14.200 --> 56:15.200
And what the fuck?

56:15.320 --> 56:19.480
But here's the reality, boys and girls.

56:19.480 --> 56:25.020
How are we going to see Ms. Pac-Man in a retro collection ever again?

56:25.020 --> 56:27.440
Because of these damn rights issues.

56:27.440 --> 56:33.120
And I'll point out, I know I was talking about that Mortal Kombat machine an awful lot last

56:33.120 --> 56:37.360
week, the little mini game, which is at games that do these.

56:37.360 --> 56:39.240
This is not at games that do these, basic fun.

56:39.240 --> 56:41.360
So it's a completely different company that does these.

56:41.400 --> 56:46.760
But I didn't show off this one because I kind of whatevered it last week.

56:46.760 --> 56:49.440
But there's also a regular Pac-Man machine, right?

56:49.440 --> 56:53.840
There's a regular Pac-Man machine that they put out as well with this full color screen,

56:53.840 --> 56:56.880
fancy, fancy, all this stuff that they have, right?

56:56.880 --> 56:59.480
Is that the company?

56:59.480 --> 57:00.480
No.

57:00.480 --> 57:07.280
But Ms. Pac-Man is there too.

57:07.280 --> 57:10.380
I even forgot they did this one, but I don't think this one is as good.

57:10.380 --> 57:13.580
And I think, oh, these guys, I'm trying to see if they have a relationship.

57:13.580 --> 57:14.580
Yes.

57:14.580 --> 57:18.060
Ms. Pac-Man Bandai Namco Entertainment, Inc.

57:18.060 --> 57:21.200
So they got the agreements for that one.

57:21.200 --> 57:23.740
But it's interesting that that company could do it.

57:23.740 --> 57:25.860
And it was easy.

57:25.860 --> 57:29.700
But at games is having such crazy difficulty with it.

57:29.700 --> 57:32.500
It's weird.

57:32.500 --> 57:39.260
Anyway, looking in chat, Tiger Class says, what about that arcade one up TMNT arcade

57:39.260 --> 57:40.260
cabinet?

57:41.140 --> 57:43.540
You must have jumped through many hoops to be able to put that out.

57:43.540 --> 57:48.580
Yeah, well, I mean, the Ninja Turtles arcade game, when it came out on Xbox 360, that was

57:48.580 --> 57:51.940
a pleasant surprise because the rights were very complicated.

57:51.940 --> 57:53.420
Rights have a way of working themselves out.

57:53.420 --> 57:59.500
And also, also the Avengers and Capcom, or didn't they have like the whole like Avengers

57:59.500 --> 58:04.300
cabinet and Marvel versus Capcom?

58:04.300 --> 58:06.380
It was X-Men Street Fighter, was it?

58:06.380 --> 58:08.500
I don't remember what they had, but they had one.

58:08.500 --> 58:12.740
They had like a bunch of those in there, like Marvel stuff.

58:12.740 --> 58:15.300
So obviously, I imagine the rights were complicated for that, too.

58:15.300 --> 58:20.300
The point is rights issues will screw up all of the games that you loved in the past because

58:20.300 --> 58:22.740
contracts were signed under the influence of drugs.

58:22.740 --> 58:23.740
All right.

58:23.740 --> 58:24.740
That's my point.

58:24.740 --> 58:29.460
That means that they technically shouldn't be binding because anything signed under influence

58:29.460 --> 58:31.340
can be considered a non-binding contract.

58:31.340 --> 58:32.340
OK.

58:32.340 --> 58:36.260
Guess where I can have a rights free utopia out there.

58:36.260 --> 58:38.460
It's called the Internet.

58:38.460 --> 58:39.460
Thank you.

58:39.460 --> 58:40.460
Piracy.

58:40.460 --> 58:41.460
I may also be...

58:41.460 --> 58:42.460
That's what art thieves can do.

58:42.460 --> 58:43.700
Kiss my ass.

58:43.700 --> 58:50.100
I may also be slightly exaggerating a thing or two about the 1980s game industry.

58:50.100 --> 58:52.680
Just a little bit.

58:52.680 --> 58:53.680
Let's move on.

58:53.680 --> 58:57.300
Speaking, speaking of things from the past, blast from the past, right, Dark Sakura?

58:57.300 --> 58:58.300
Yeah.

58:58.300 --> 59:01.740
You know me and prototypes and retro shit.

59:01.740 --> 59:07.700
So the Nintendo 64, of course, had quite the unique controller, right?

59:07.940 --> 59:15.700
Still to this day, like, it hurts if you fall on it just the right way where the bottom

59:15.700 --> 59:20.940
part pokes into your ribs and then the cat looks at you while you're rolling around in

59:20.940 --> 59:21.940
pain.

59:21.940 --> 59:23.860
Sorry, that was a very recent experience.

59:23.860 --> 59:29.900
So anyway, when this was still known, when the Nintendo 64 was still known as the Ultra

59:29.900 --> 59:35.100
64, there were, of course, prototype controllers that were going around.

59:35.100 --> 59:36.820
The controller didn't have like a name.

59:36.820 --> 59:39.780
It was just a controller.

59:39.780 --> 59:49.500
And so a video game preservationist called Shane Batty actually found a prototype controller

59:49.500 --> 59:53.300
and shared pictures of it on a Twitter thread.

59:53.300 --> 59:56.180
Which I actually prepared that for our Twitch folks tonight.

59:56.180 --> 59:57.180
Look at you.

59:57.180 --> 59:58.180
Look at me up in my game.

59:58.180 --> 59:59.180
Gold star.

59:59.180 --> 01:00:02.500
Gold star, Rob.

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:09.220
But as you can see in it, the prototype and the final one, a little bit bigger, you know,

01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:10.380
a little bit different.

01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:14.380
That thumb pad, you see how much bigger that is on there?

01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:15.820
Oh yeah.

01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:24.580
You know, and people were saying actually that it's a lot more comfortable to use.

01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:30.700
And don't know why they opted out of it, but you know, there's actually a picture of that

01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:33.460
thumb pad removed from it.

01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:34.460
Don't think I captured that.

01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:35.460
Hold on.

01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:39.540
Um, because I will copy the image and paste it in chat.

01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:45.660
But for our Twitch or for our podcast people, that's not going to help, sadly.

01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:46.660
Yeah.

01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:53.500
But, um, but at any rate, um, uh, the, uh, it's just got like a different, hold on it.

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:59.260
When you look at the two side by side, it actually looks to me like the controller is

01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:05.500
a little bit narrower, but it seems to me that it's a little bit more comfortable.

01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:11.140
It did keep a lot of the button design, you know, as far as the layout for the buttons,

01:01:11.140 --> 01:01:16.580
but I think that the, normally the green and blue button, which are massive, were a little

01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:19.660
bit smaller in this prototype and all like sort of flat.

01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:27.500
They seemed like the six buttons are more in line where the, um, the controller that

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:31.880
we got has those three, sorry, the four yellow buttons and sort of a diamond.

01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:36.940
They don't quite line up the, these line up more like a six button control.

01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:37.940
Yeah.

01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:38.940
Yeah.

01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:39.940
It looks like a six button configuration in this.

01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:42.100
I mean, honestly, I think it's really comfortable.

01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:48.700
I would love for this dude to like market that design or whoever now can market that

01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:55.880
design so that, you know, we would be able to, um, uh, that we would be able to use something

01:01:55.880 --> 01:01:58.160
like that for our, our old machines.

01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:02.580
It's weird that it's taken this long for a prototype like that to unveil itself.

01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:04.080
You know, it's been years, right?

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:09.120
If you want to look in the chat right now, Rob, there's a picture I, um, I put posted

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:10.120
in there.

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:13.020
That's the thumb pad pulled out.

01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:17.140
And I think that, um, I linked it in there for everyone to see, but it's just interesting

01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:23.400
how just, just a small little unit on here, but it, it has like a deeper recess as well

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:29.920
instead of the more, uh, what's the word I'm thinking of, uh, convex shape.

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:33.680
It's a little bit more concave.

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:36.040
So do you think this was the better controller?

01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:39.220
Would you like to be able to play your N64 games with this controller or?

01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:42.280
I'd much rather.

01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:44.860
Maybe maybe a third party will be controlled.

01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:45.860
Probably not.

01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:49.320
Cause this console is how old at this point, I guess it's a, it's definitely an artifact

01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:50.560
of many, many years ago.

01:02:50.560 --> 01:02:56.120
No, no, just because that may be the case, you know, all it takes for them to do is release

01:02:56.120 --> 01:03:00.960
a N64 classic edition and there'll be a market for those controllers again.

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:01.960
Hmm.

01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:02.960
Fair point.

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:03.960
You're right.

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:07.800
Nintendo might get on the classic bandwagon, uh, once again at some point.

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:10.760
So yeah, shenanigans will ensue.

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:15.040
Well, let's move on to a more classic things that Nintendo should get on the bandwagon

01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:16.040
for.

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:17.040
Right?

01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:18.040
Uh, yeah.

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:19.040
They're going to get on the bandwagon for cease and desist.

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:20.040
No.

01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:21.720
Um, so this is actually kind of cool.

01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:28.080
So this is a fan project being done by this animator, um, Jesus Lopez, who's actually

01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:31.800
animated on several different, uh, games that are out there.

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:37.560
The Simpsons tapped out, DuckTales remastered, Shante, Half Genie Hero, Silent Hill.

01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:44.440
Um, and so he has this fan project that he's working on that is a, a Super Mario Super

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:46.720
Show Mario game.

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:52.560
And so he's basically animating Mario in a game in the style of the Super Mario Super

01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:53.560
Show.

01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:59.560
So his first world that he's creating is Pastaland, which is from the first episode of the show.

01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:01.280
And it's pretty, it looks so good.

01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:02.280
We're showing a little bit.

01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:04.460
This is from the developer's YouTube channel.

01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:08.000
So he's like kind of filming his computer screen, so you can't even really get the full

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.520
realness of how much these colors pop and things, but it looks really good.

01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:13.680
And it looks like a lawsuit will be on his desk.

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:16.920
Well, that's not necessarily true because it's really sad because this looks great.

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:19.720
He's been working on this for three years as like a family project.

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:24.580
So his, his son, um, I think his 10 year old son is coding the game.

01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:25.960
He's doing the animation.

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:32.200
And then he said his daughter is working on like, uh, some other like animation stuff

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:34.880
or like kind of working with him on the animation stuff.

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:36.240
So, but it's pretty awesome.

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:41.680
Like he's recreated the first level, a level one, one from Super Mario Brothers in just,

01:04:41.680 --> 01:04:42.680
that's not really level one.

01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:44.800
It's sort of based on its fundamentals.

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:45.800
Yeah.

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:46.800
Yeah.

01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:51.160
So he's sort of based it on a level one, one and he's got like just all sorts of animations

01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:52.160
in there.

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:54.280
The sound effects are from like the actual show.

01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:58.480
Even in other videos he has out there, there's like kind of this behind the scenes thing

01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:05.520
that was done by a YouTuber swanky box who actually showed off some of the, um, animations

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:06.520
for the enemies.

01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:11.040
So like they're from the show and animated really nice.

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:14.240
And he's talking about some of the things that he wants to work on.

01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:17.080
He's got other characters like Princess Peach in there already.

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:20.920
And he has a mock-up of what Wario would look like in the art style.

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:22.840
So pretty cool.

01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:24.680
So how long before Nintendo shuts it down?

01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:26.280
Because it's on all the gaming blogs now.

01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:31.560
So I don't know if he's, I don't know if he's necessarily planning on releasing it.

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:35.980
I think it's more of right now, just a project that's kind of for fun.

01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:39.640
So I don't know if they would send him a cease and desist yet until he tries to like send

01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:41.960
it, release it out on the internet.

01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:45.560
Technically they could go after the YouTube.

01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:50.040
I know you don't want to hear it, but technically they could go, but yes, I completely understand

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:54.120
if you have a fan game like that, that you're really interested on putting out there and

01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:55.120
I get it.

01:05:55.120 --> 01:05:59.240
If you spend a lot of time on it, you don't say anything until released, just release

01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:00.240
it.

01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:01.360
Then you say he's given it to somebody cause you're right.

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:04.360
There was the other YouTube that actually was doing like the game.

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:08.120
And the only reason I didn't use that for the stuff we were talking about talking to

01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:09.320
because, well, it's not just the talking.

01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:13.040
I mean, I can delete the audio, which is what I did, but then they also pop up all these

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:14.040
other game boxes.

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:18.080
There's a bunch of other bullshit that the YouTuber puts over it besides just the game,

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:19.320
which I get it.

01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:23.720
It's his program or whatever, but yeah, so I didn't show that, but you, you know, you

01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:24.720
can visit other YouTube.

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:26.040
You can actually see the game in motion.

01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:31.240
But my point is it's not just on this guy's computer cause he sent it to this other YouTuber.

01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:35.240
Well I know it says at least the graphics, I don't know being distributed privately.

01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:39.920
So I don't know if they would do anything until it's like intent on releasing it near

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:40.920
right now.

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:43.280
It's just kind of, you know, fan thing, but it looks awesome.

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:45.160
I would love to see a game like that.

01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:48.760
Well, we'll see if we get through tomorrow without the lawyers attacking, we might be

01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:49.760
okay.

01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:50.760
We might be in the clear.

01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:51.760
Yeah.

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:52.760
So stay tuned.

01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:53.760
Cause maybe next week we'll have a follow up.

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:54.760
You're going to keep an eye out.

01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:56.080
See if this game is still around next week.

01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:57.080
Sure.

01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:58.080
Why not?

01:06:58.080 --> 01:06:59.080
Sounds good.

01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:00.080
All right.

01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:01.320
Well let's move on and talk about Beat Saber.

01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:05.200
Oh, that's a game I need to get back into playing cause, uh, yeah, clearly I was

01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:07.440
I was a little skinnier when I was playing a Beat Saber a little bit.

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:13.080
I as well need to play that because, um, I played it once at that, um, Sacramento thing

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:15.360
and I was like, dude, I need to get this.

01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:18.680
Well, there might be some more incentive for you to check out Beat Saber.

01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:23.740
There is a brand new 360 degree mode coming in December.

01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:26.700
So now the notes are coming at you from all directions.

01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:28.560
Well that's a good way to get tangled up in the cords.

01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:29.560
Right?

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:30.560
I don't know.

01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:31.560
I don't know if that would work for me.

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:35.080
I don't know if it was on like the Oculus Go or something like that where it's only

01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:39.580
the wireless ones, but like, ah, I don't know.

01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:40.580
That sounds like a problem.

01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:41.580
Yeah, it might.

01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:44.400
Well, I mean, and again, I don't, I don't know how maybe the note charts are going to

01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:48.280
be different on PlayStation four and maybe even though they say it's 360 degrees, like

01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:51.200
180 or something, it's really only like 180 or something like that.

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:54.760
I don't know because I haven't been able to play one of these stages myself.

01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:56.120
How would you be able to watch behind you?

01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:57.120
I don't know.

01:07:57.120 --> 01:07:59.200
That doesn't sound like it'd be fun.

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:02.960
I'm trying to see if they say it's like only 180 degrees or what have you.

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:03.960
Yeah.

01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:07.320
It allows beat maps to send lines of blocks at you from arbitrary directions as the song

01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:08.320
plays out.

01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:11.420
Oh, so it's not just like spinning around behind you, but the note arrows can come in

01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:12.680
from different directions too.

01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:14.700
So I think that's what they mean by 360 degrees.

01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:18.580
It's not just coming at you from here, but it could be up, left, right.

01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:20.760
They could be coming from all sorts of different directions.

01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:21.760
Yeah.

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:26.760
I mean, I like the, it's a neat gimmick, but yeah, I know.

01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:27.760
I don't know.

01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:28.760
All right.

01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:34.800
Um, I probably won't actually play that mode just because there, why, why mess with perfection?

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:36.620
The original mode is good.

01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:41.300
I know, but you ever, do you ever watch some people play Beat Saber on Twitch or whatever?

01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:46.140
Like some people are like crazy good at Beat Saber and like some of the songs they're playing

01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:49.260
are just, I don't even know if I would say it's like good at Beat Saber.

01:08:49.260 --> 01:08:54.200
It's just like these mods and these custom things are just, they're just fast.

01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:58.560
They're like lightning fast and it's, it's weird to watch almost.

01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:02.360
But I like, I like the note charts for some of like the original, like Beat Saber stuff

01:09:02.360 --> 01:09:04.980
that like the, the crab rave song.

01:09:04.980 --> 01:09:10.520
You do like some fun little, like the way you like do the notes is fun.

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:12.420
That's why I don't always like, it's the same thing with DDR.

01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:15.900
I don't always like the hell mode steps, so I don't always like all the hell modes.

01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:20.320
Modern DDR where everything's hell mode steps almost.

01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:24.260
Anyway, uh, also coming to Beat Saber, it doesn't end there.

01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:30.500
It's not just the 360 degree mode, but there is a brand new music pack coming out next week.

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:35.360
So previously we had the music pack from Imagine Dragons.

01:09:35.360 --> 01:09:39.300
So now we're going to be getting a music pack from Panic at the Disco is going to be the

01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:41.420
next music pack that's going to be in the game.

01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:47.520
So not techno or even like drum and bass or wow, wow, wow type of stuff.

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:48.940
Like it's kind of different.

01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:51.500
It's like rock music that they keep putting in there.

01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:52.500
So I don't know.

01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:53.720
I'm kind of into it though.

01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:58.400
I liked the Imagine Dragons stuff more than I thought I would.

01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:03.120
So maybe I'll like the Panic at the Disco stuff a little better as well.

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:10.640
So, um, any, uh, Oh, I was going to say you've, uh, you've got your DDR machine at home.

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:12.560
Have you been playing music games at home lately?

01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:19.340
I have not, um, I actually started taking it apart a little bit, uh, last yesterday

01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:24.760
because I have, I've been sitting on a lot of parts that converted over to step mania

01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:26.900
and also other things.

01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:31.460
So I was looking at, uh, cause on this Facebook group that I follow, they have like a lot

01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:33.980
of people that talk about doing different conversions for things.

01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:37.720
And one of the conversions I was going to do is removing the fluorescent lights that

01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:42.840
are in the actual pads themselves and replacing them with LEDs.

01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:44.860
And so I have all the LEDs to do that.

01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:50.020
Um, I just needed to see because I bought the ones that they recommended, but I guess

01:10:50.020 --> 01:10:53.520
I don't know how you exactly plug all that together.

01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:58.280
And so I was looking at what came with the LEDs and trying to see how that actually hooks

01:10:58.280 --> 01:10:59.620
up to the board.

01:10:59.620 --> 01:11:03.060
And I think I might just have to like solder stuff together.

01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:04.620
Um, I don't know.

01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:08.420
I don't know if it like actually replaces the whole inverter board that's in there and

01:11:08.420 --> 01:11:10.980
just, I just plug it straight into that.

01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:14.340
Um, so that's why I was trying to determine yesterday I was looking at, I was like, Oh,

01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:18.300
and I want to kind of see how dirty these have gotten since I've been playing.

01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:19.300
Actually not very dirty.

01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:20.300
So that, that's good.

01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:22.100
I still haven't cleaned my right side pads though.

01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:26.860
I'm afraid to look at what's in there, but, um, but yeah, I have been going through that.

01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:30.060
I was starting to try and work on cleaning my garage now that summer's over and we're

01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:32.220
getting back into cooler temperatures.

01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:34.100
I do want to play more DDR again.

01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:42.160
I do want to get the conversion stuff done just, just so I can put the system into, um,

01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:43.160
in there.

01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:46.440
And like, I know at one point I just like talking about, Oh, I'm gonna make this new,

01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:48.280
you know, step me a theme it's going to be awesome.

01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:51.840
I just MVP, just put the minimal viable product in there.

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:56.600
Just get a theme on there that's not atrocious and just load it full songs and just play

01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:57.600
it.

01:11:57.600 --> 01:11:58.600
I just don't really care at this point.

01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:00.720
I just want it playable.

01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:05.040
I can do that stuff later at some other date, but, um, that's what I wanted to do.

01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:09.360
So I'm going to try to get something in there so that I can actually play some different

01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:11.160
songs and do all that.

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:14.320
Have you been tempted at all to add to Loki's arcade?

01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:18.240
Let's let's assume that wife agro was not an issue.

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:21.600
Have you been tempted to add to Loki's arcade in the garage?

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:27.120
No, not at all because, um, I have to, well, I still have to fix the monitor on my actual

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:30.880
arcade cabinet I have out there cause it's not working right now.

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:35.400
Um, ever since they moved it in the garage, I don't know if something just, I think the

01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:41.320
cap, uh, the caps on the board burned out and so I need to have like a TV repairman

01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:42.840
come and fix it.

01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:47.160
I would love to just replace it with an LCD panel, which would be nice, but no one makes

01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:49.800
four by three LCD panels anymore.

01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:50.800
So yeah.

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:53.240
Or you'd probably have to get like a real specialized thing online.

01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:54.240
Yeah.

01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:59.240
I was like, even like the actual like, uh, monitors that go in there are super expensive

01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:00.460
and they don't sell them anymore.

01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:02.520
Like good luck finding CRT monitors.

01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:07.400
So I may just have to do something horrible, drastic, drastic.

01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:08.400
Yeah.

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:11.880
I was like, Oh, can I find like an old LCD screen?

01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:15.880
Like maybe buy like, can I have someone custom make an LCD panel for that?

01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:19.460
Like I don't even know like how you would go about that.

01:13:19.460 --> 01:13:25.320
So, um, right now it's sitting broken, but I would love to get that fixed up again.

01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:30.480
Um, uh, originally the, the agreement was I would sell that when I got a DDR machine.

01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:36.840
Um, but yeah, whatever, so there was an agreement that you were going to sell something before

01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:41.680
getting the DDR machine, but you didn't follow through on that.

01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:42.680
That's fine.

01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:43.680
All right.

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:48.140
And so like, I would like to do that, but like, um, yeah, I just need to, I really want

01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:50.080
to get like step man, you put on there cause I think that'd be fun.

01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:54.120
Now I have all the lighting stuff now for two and a site like the actual boards that

01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:55.120
control the lighting.

01:13:55.120 --> 01:14:01.240
Um, I just need to see if it all works together and then figure out how to configure all that.

01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:04.960
And I thought about like the main stuff I know, and I actually downloaded like a big

01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:10.640
old zip file that someone put together for like doing a hyper spin with maim DDR and

01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:11.640
stuff like that.

01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:13.600
But I don't know if I'm going to do that.

01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:16.000
I just think step mania and we'll just call it a day.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.000
All right.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.560
Well that was quite the tangent, but that's okay.

01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:22.160
Cause we haven't had an update on Loki's arcade in a while, but I understand it is summertime

01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:23.160
as well.

01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:26.360
You've got, uh, you haven't been able to be out there in the garage cause when it's a

01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:27.960
hundred degrees, DDR is no fun.

01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:28.960
Yes.

01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:31.400
It's, it's nicer now, but let's move on to our next story.

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:34.360
Uh, Dar Sakura has a Minecraft related thing for us.

01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:35.360
I do.

01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:44.280
Um, actually it is not just Minecraft, Minecraft is getting a board game.

01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:47.180
Like have you noticed, like, have you gone through the board game section at target and

01:14:47.180 --> 01:14:49.400
just looked like all the shenanigans they have there?

01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:50.400
Yeah.

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:51.840
It's all like poop and pee jokes.

01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:53.600
I feel like a trapper keeper game.

01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:55.480
Do you know how many games there are?

01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:56.480
It's so gross.

01:14:56.480 --> 01:15:02.600
It comes in a mini trapper kids are obsessed and there's like, like, like other like eighties

01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:03.880
themed light games.

01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:07.200
But I think it's cool that Minecraft is getting a board game.

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:08.560
It's called builders and biomes.

01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:11.840
It's a tabletop game that uses different elements.

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:15.280
So you're, you explore your overworld and you build your structures and you mind your

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:16.280
resources on this.

01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:22.520
Sounds like a little monopoly ish, but then you have to, uh, create these connection connected

01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:28.780
biomes of forests and mountains and Tundra and all this on your player board.

01:15:28.780 --> 01:15:33.520
So you've got also got endermen and creepers that show up in there that you have to defeat

01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:35.320
with weapons that you collect through the game.

01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:37.480
It just looks like it's kind of cool.

01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:41.680
Um, where's the part where Loki yells, I'm a creeper kaboom and flips the board over

01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:48.320
flip board games over board games are expensive now.

01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:53.640
Um, but it's as being a released by Ravens burger, which is an interesting name.

01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:54.640
Okay.

01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:57.980
They've also done a game called villainous that uses Disney villains and they've done

01:15:57.980 --> 01:16:04.600
a Jaws one and the universal monsters game, but this one, it just looks kinda kinda cool.

01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:05.600
I don't know.

01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:08.840
Maybe we could get folks together and play a little bit of this.

01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:11.040
So is it an $80 board games?

01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:12.040
You're right.

01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:13.040
Board games are expensive.

01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:14.040
Let me look at the preorder.

01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:16.400
Then again, video games are 60 bucks.

01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:21.080
So preorder says 40 bucks.

01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:22.080
Okay.

01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:23.080
39 99.

01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:24.080
That's a fair amount.

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:25.360
There's probably a lot of loose pieces of the game like that.

01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:26.360
Yeah.

01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:28.560
It looks like a lot of stuff that interconnects.

01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:33.280
All right, well moving on with more Minecraft Loki.

01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:34.280
Yes.

01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:39.720
Um, so there was a lot of stuff that came out of the, uh, Minecraft, um, or mine con

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:42.280
live, which was this Saturday.

01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:47.480
So, um, some of the things that they talked about there, one of which is Minecraft earth,

01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:50.960
the game I've been looking forward to, um, it is going to be coming out.

01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:51.960
That's there.

01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:56.400
Like everybody says it's their answer to Pokemon go, but it, it, it, it's just an AR Pokemon

01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:57.400
go.

01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:58.400
It's just like Minecraft.

01:16:58.400 --> 01:16:59.400
Yeah.

01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:00.400
Minecraft game.

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:01.400
Yeah.

01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:03.760
So it's a Minecraft AR game and that's going to be coming out in the next couple of weeks.

01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:11.880
So looking forward to that, um, I've already preregistered in, um, uh, Android for that.

01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:14.600
So I will have to check it out.

01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:16.240
Um, some other stuff they announced.

01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:19.440
So they had a vote on which biomes they're going to add to the game.

01:17:19.440 --> 01:17:23.400
So there was a brand new biome that's going to be enhanced mountains.

01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:28.400
That's going to have, um, you know, goats and they're going to be adding some more snow

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:29.400
and stuff like that.

01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:30.800
And they're going to be really tall.

01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:31.800
So that's pretty cool.

01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:36.000
Uh, they showed off some more stuff for Minecraft dungeons that looked pretty cool.

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.400
They announced that next year is going to be a Minecraft festival from September 25th

01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:44.260
to 27th in Orlando, Florida.

01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:49.640
And they said it's going to be a three day celebration with all things Minecraft and

01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:50.640
what else?

01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:56.800
Uh, they talked about an update to the Java version with honey blocks and bees, not the

01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:57.800
bees.

01:17:57.800 --> 01:17:58.800
So you can get bees.

01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:04.160
You can get attacked by bees now in Minecraft, they are neutral mobs, so don't attack them.

01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:05.160
They won't attack you.

01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:06.160
Okay.

01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:11.040
Uh, they talked about some creator tools so you can do different scripting, um, and they

01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:16.920
have like the editor stick that you can use to edit things, rotate stuff around, um, make

01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:19.180
full crops and stuff like that.

01:18:19.180 --> 01:18:23.960
So it sounds a little bit like, um, some of the other tools that they have and like world

01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:31.880
edit or whatever, uh, realms plus that allows you to add, they've expanded the realms for

01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:37.480
the same price and you still, I guess, get access to 10 player realms and then they have

01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:42.320
50 pieces of content from the mark Minecraft marketplace at no extra cost.

01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:46.340
They have a character creator and um, bedrock capes.

01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:52.040
It's like a windows 10, xbox one, android app that you can create your own characters

01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:54.720
and import them into Minecraft.

01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:57.860
They did another update, which they have a lot of new biomes.

01:18:57.860 --> 01:19:04.000
So soul sand valley, nether wart fortress red, nether wart forest blue, uh, they have

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:10.000
piglin beast, which is a new mob that appears in the nether and they've renamed the zombie

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:16.240
pigmen to zombified piglins and piglins are going to be these, um, kind of like caveman

01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:22.240
characters that are pigs, I guess, cave pig characters and they will be hostile and then

01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:26.880
new block, which is a target block that if you shoot with an arrow, it powers redstone.

01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:28.840
So they're not doing Minecraft too.

01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:34.200
They are continuing to make these big upgrades to the original Minecraft, but no 4k graphics.

01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:39.840
Uh, well remember they do have the ray tracing, you know, ray tracing so you can get that.

01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:47.720
But yeah, you have to have a beefed up computer to do that unless you use mods, right?

01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:48.720
All right.

01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:52.640
Well, uh, going from a Minecraft to another game that's a couple of years old, but people

01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:57.240
are still really into it and that is Overwatch, but Overwatch going to be getting some major

01:19:57.240 --> 01:20:00.520
character kind of rebalancing and character shuffling around.

01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:03.560
There's no new characters or new stages or things being announced, but there is still

01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:09.120
a very large patch that just went to the PTR or public test realm, which is for PC players

01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:11.800
of the game because they don't have PTR on the consoles.

01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:15.520
But September 24th saw a pretty big PTR patch be delivered.

01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:20.060
And one could kind of also see that this is in advance of the switch version coming out.

01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:23.340
So it's almost like they're doing some rebalancing before the switch version is out.

01:20:23.340 --> 01:20:27.960
They're doing some pretty big juggling with heroes like D.Va where the defense matrix

01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:28.960
is going to be changing.

01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:34.640
The regeneration rate is increased and the delay before the regeneration begins is lowered.

01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:38.000
And many characters are getting changes.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:42.680
Sigma is getting quite a few changes as well, which is like Sigma is the one new character

01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:44.920
in the game that I just can't get into.

01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:49.640
Like I like Batiste, I like Orisa, I like a lot of the other characters they've added.

01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:50.640
I don't really care for Sigma.

01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:51.760
I don't get them.

01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:56.760
But maybe these reshufflings will help a little bit because yeah, it sounds like they're making

01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:59.220
them less powered, which this always happens.

01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:02.280
They roll out a new hero, then they got to nerf them.

01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:06.560
So Kinetic Grasp no longer blocks certain moves.

01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:10.320
The experimental barrier regeneration rate was reduced and there's a cool down after

01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:11.780
recalling the barrier.

01:21:11.780 --> 01:21:14.520
So they're changing some things a little bit.

01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:16.760
But like Winston, they're buffing up a little bit.

01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:22.360
The duration of the barrier projector is increasing and the health is increasing as well.

01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:25.840
Lucio's crossfade speed boost is going to get stronger.

01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:30.100
And that sounds like that's going to be a pretty big change for Lucio.

01:21:30.100 --> 01:21:33.540
So yeah, a lot of changes going to some of your favorite characters there.

01:21:33.540 --> 01:21:36.980
Symmetra, again, getting a bunch of changes.

01:21:36.980 --> 01:21:39.860
Photon barriers duration is being reduced.

01:21:39.860 --> 01:21:44.540
Sentry turrets, their overall output damage is being reduced.

01:21:44.540 --> 01:21:49.320
And yeah, a photon projector, if you're getting hit by it, you'll be able to hear it more.

01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:54.720
So yeah, lots of heroes in Overwatch getting changes, but it also just goes to show, man,

01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:56.780
this game just keeps on going.

01:21:56.780 --> 01:21:57.780
Yeah.

01:21:57.780 --> 01:21:58.780
Yeah.

01:21:58.780 --> 01:21:59.780
Overwatch is still...

01:21:59.980 --> 01:22:03.780
I didn't really play it this week, but just within the past couple of weeks, I will bring

01:22:03.780 --> 01:22:05.700
up Overwatch and randomly play Quick Play.

01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:10.580
I really liked the new role queuing because I like going in there knowing I'll get to

01:22:10.580 --> 01:22:14.620
play a healer and there's a pretty good chance I can play Moira because usually I want to

01:22:14.620 --> 01:22:15.620
play Moira.

01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:18.580
But even if the other healer beats me to it, I like to do Lucio or something else.

01:22:18.580 --> 01:22:22.380
And it's like, I know somebody else isn't going to snipe that hero position or that

01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:23.380
healer position.

01:22:23.380 --> 01:22:27.200
And we're going to have enough, like we're going to have a well-rounded team.

01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:30.840
You don't have like everybody trying to pick Hanzo, like in the first week of the game,

01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:34.280
it was like, wow, our team is entirely Hanzo and Widowmaker.

01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:38.560
So yeah, that's really helped a lot, I think, when it comes to Overwatch.

01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:41.100
Anyway, we're going to go back to a simpler time.

01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:46.280
It's the classic game of the week where, you know, you couldn't patch games like this.

01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:50.160
You couldn't keep a game going for years and years through patches.

01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:52.080
You just did sequels.

01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:55.400
But anyway, Dark Soccer is going to open up the gaming vault and we're going to take a

01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:59.640
trip down memory lane with this week's classic game of the week.

01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:02.800
Dark Soccer, what did you pick for us this week?

01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:05.680
I picked a game called Osmond.

01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:06.680
Are you familiar with it?

01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:07.680
Um, not really.

01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:09.680
I've got to admit.

01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:14.080
Osmond was produced by a company called Mitchellcore.

01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:20.920
However, the development staff was mostly ex-Capcom staff, including Yotsui Koichi,

01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:28.640
who was the original designer, or one of the original creators of Strider.

01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:34.080
And this game is considered an unofficial sequel to Strider.

01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:35.800
Like a spiritual successor type of thing?

01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:39.000
Well, at the time it was the sequel.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.520
It was considered, I mean, not necessarily a spiritual.

01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:45.720
He called it his Strider 2, you know?

01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:52.040
You can see just in this little video here a lot of things in common with Strider.

01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:58.400
Just with how it looks with the flashing, the climbing the walls, the acrobatics.

01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:02.560
It was actually, he calls it an irregular sequel.

01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:14.720
So where Strider was set in a sort of futuristic Soviet-ish setting, in this case it's more

01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:21.680
of a cyberpunk Arabian style setting, where instead of Strider Hiryu being a Japanese

01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:25.120
guy, you play a Middle Eastern protagonist named Kirin.

01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:30.760
And he doesn't use any weapons, he's just full fight.

01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:38.600
And you go through all these different exotic locations and fight enemies to stop this international

01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:45.280
sort of federal government, or the federation that's taking over the entire world.

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:53.040
So you're going to try to infiltrate and try to fight everybody and be the man.

01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:59.080
At any rate, yeah, as you'll see, it has a lot of the same attack sequences that Strider

01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:01.080
Hiryu does.

01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:06.560
It's A to attack, B to jump, C to do your screen clearing attack.

01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:12.840
He also has some different power-ups and he has different techniques.

01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:16.960
He has the sliding technique that's very much like Hiryu's slide.

01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:21.520
He has some throws for human-sized characters only.

01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:25.440
One of them is called the Hell Wheel, the other is called the Izuna Drop.

01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:33.640
He has an attack called the Shredding Dance, where he does a three-punch combination and

01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:36.520
it's stronger than the basic kits but difficult to use.

01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:40.840
And the Kirin Star Festival, where he kills all the enemies on screen, I just think that's

01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:42.640
a great name for it.

01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:50.680
So you actually have different branching paths and there's no actual checkpoint.

01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:59.160
When you die, you respawn where you were last killed, although in the final stage, you have

01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:01.080
checkpoints there.

01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:05.000
So it's a little bit more difficult.

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:09.720
You have your power-ups in here that are different than Hiryu's power-ups, so you get one that

01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:12.680
changes his pants to purple.

01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:14.320
That's the power-up, his pants turn purple.

01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:16.080
Okay, a little bit more than that.

01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:21.660
He gets an energy double of himself, think of Ninja Gaiden with this, and it does the

01:26:21.660 --> 01:26:27.680
non-upgraded versions of Kirin's attacks and then it will fly away and re-merge with Kirin.

01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:32.560
The second one gives him red pants and two shadows.

01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:36.600
And the third one gives him white pants and three shadows.

01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:41.920
The last one changes his pants back to black so he gets his original pants back and does

01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:46.560
energy blades with his kicks that increase his melee range.

01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:50.080
And then it's a limited set of attacks on here.

01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:58.520
So the game is, I mean, it was pretty much just like if anyone wanted another Strider

01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:01.440
game, then Osmond was going to be your game.

01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:02.680
It's really fun.

01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:07.800
It was only ever released in the arcades.

01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:16.460
So you will not find any sort of home version for this outside of, you know, Maine.

01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:18.940
It had a different name in Japan, by the way.

01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:27.580
It was called Cannon Dancer, which I think is a cool name, you know, Osmond doesn't really

01:27:27.580 --> 01:27:32.980
make a lot of sense because Osmond was the name of a Turkish, I want to say a Turkish

01:27:32.980 --> 01:27:33.980
prince or king.

01:27:33.980 --> 01:27:38.320
Why do you think that they've stayed away from putting this in any type of like retrospective

01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:41.220
collection or the, I mean, is it a complicated rights issue or what?

01:27:41.220 --> 01:27:49.280
I don't know, but I've never really heard of Mitchell Corps outside of this game.

01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:55.120
It looks like that the hardware for this was a Data East 156.

01:27:55.120 --> 01:28:02.280
So wait, in Japan it was released by Atlas, but I don't, let me look at the Mitchell Corporation.

01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:03.360
I want to see what else they've done.

01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:06.400
They were a Japanese company.

01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:18.740
They are, they hired Capcom and TAD Corporation employees, and they were owned, the president

01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:19.740
was Roy Ozaki.

01:28:19.740 --> 01:28:22.180
I'm trying to see what else that they've done.

01:28:22.180 --> 01:28:27.860
They did basically, they did titles for home consoles, handhelds, Japanese mobile games,

01:28:27.860 --> 01:28:33.340
arcade and interactive kiosks, and printed circuit boards for the coin-op market.

01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:38.480
And then they started developing games for Nintendo hardware.

01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:42.720
They were best known as the developer of a game called Puzloop.

01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:47.240
They did the Pang series, which we got as Buster Brothers and distributed by Capcom.

01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:48.240
Oh, yeah.

01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:49.240
Okay.

01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:54.080
I knew I'd seen the name, but it didn't really stick out to me.

01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:59.320
A Nintendo of America release, Puzloop for Nintendo DS, under the title of Magnetica.

01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:04.260
And then there was a four player version called Magnetica Twist on We Were Servious.

01:29:04.260 --> 01:29:07.740
Tokyo Crash Mobs is the last of the Puzloop series.

01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:14.860
So they did Ballistik, they did Funky Jet, licensed by Data East.

01:29:14.860 --> 01:29:18.060
Quest Buster's kind of confirming, Mitchell Company went under a few years ago.

01:29:18.060 --> 01:29:19.060
Yeah.

01:29:19.060 --> 01:29:23.180
I'm just looking at some of the other names to see if any of it just looks familiar.

01:29:23.180 --> 01:29:26.460
Charlie Ninja, that's a fun name.

01:29:26.460 --> 01:29:30.720
They did Pallarium, Chokan Hituhide.

01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:35.760
Yeah, I'm not really seeing number battles.

01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:37.920
Okay, nothing to do with Strider.

01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:39.960
Yeah, Tokyo Crash Mobs.

01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:42.600
Yeah I'm just looking through the list of everything to see if there's anything else

01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:44.460
that looked familiar.

01:29:44.460 --> 01:29:52.560
So yeah, funny enough, Osmond was a 1996 release and there were zero.

01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:56.940
I would think that if it would get a home release, like I don't know who owns the rights

01:29:56.940 --> 01:29:59.300
to it now.

01:29:59.300 --> 01:30:03.780
I mean what company ate up Mitchell?

01:30:03.780 --> 01:30:06.820
Their assets might have been liquidated in her all over the place, for all we know.

01:30:06.820 --> 01:30:11.660
So yeah, then we don't actually know who owns the rights to it.

01:30:11.660 --> 01:30:14.420
But I can tell you that it was published in Japan by Atlas.

01:30:14.420 --> 01:30:20.820
So I think if there was going to be any kind of home version release, it would have to

01:30:20.820 --> 01:30:22.960
go out by Atlas, at least in Japan.

01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:26.360
Well, if you're going to pirate it using MAME, at least you can feel good about the fact

01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:29.200
that there is no official way to support this game.

01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:30.900
Pirating is pretty much the only way you can play it.

01:30:30.900 --> 01:30:35.680
Not that I usually would endorse that route, but hey, you don't want me to pay for it.

01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:39.760
Dude, wouldn't it be cool if we bought the rights to Osmond?

01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:43.440
We'll give those to YYR as well, even though he doesn't, I think he's pretty clearly said

01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:45.160
he doesn't want the rights.

01:30:45.160 --> 01:30:46.160
He's trying to raise a child.

01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:47.160
No, no.

01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:48.160
No, just take the gift.

01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:52.020
I want the rights for this and release them as mini cabs.

01:30:52.020 --> 01:30:53.020
There you go.

01:30:53.020 --> 01:30:54.380
Like, like the little Mortal Kombat thing.

01:30:54.380 --> 01:30:55.380
No, no, no, no, no.

01:30:55.380 --> 01:30:56.380
Oh, mini.

01:30:56.380 --> 01:30:57.380
Oh, mini.

01:30:57.380 --> 01:30:58.380
Oh, okay.

01:30:58.380 --> 01:30:59.380
Like the $100 mini cabs or whatever.

01:30:59.380 --> 01:31:00.380
Yeah.

01:31:00.380 --> 01:31:01.380
Yeah.

01:31:01.380 --> 01:31:02.380
That'd be cool.

01:31:02.380 --> 01:31:03.380
Orange, Wright and Jetsons.

01:31:03.380 --> 01:31:04.380
Come on, Walgreens.

01:31:04.380 --> 01:31:05.380
This is your chance.

01:31:05.380 --> 01:31:06.860
The Osmond and Ms. Pac-Man cabinet.

01:31:06.860 --> 01:31:11.380
But you know, this game though is if you, if you like Strider and like the challenge

01:31:11.380 --> 01:31:15.660
of the first Strider, this game is really, really amazing for that.

01:31:15.660 --> 01:31:20.640
I would definitely encourage everyone to, to load it up and play it.

01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:26.600
Or if you find an arcade machine, if you find an arcade machine of Osmond in the wild, fucking

01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:34.760
tweet it to us and you take a video of yourself playing it, I will hand write you a letter

01:31:34.760 --> 01:31:35.760
and mail it to you.

01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:36.760
Thanks.

01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:39.760
You will have, you will hand write a letter of thanks and send it to the listener.

01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:40.760
It may not say thanks.

01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:49.300
It may, it may have, uh, like an, uh, an Instax photo of me or the cat or Mr. Smoosh or my

01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:53.020
foot, but I'll send you a picture.

01:31:53.020 --> 01:31:56.540
I just can't guarantee what the picture will be.

01:31:56.540 --> 01:31:57.780
That's your prize.

01:31:57.780 --> 01:31:58.780
That's what I'm holding.

01:31:58.780 --> 01:32:01.180
Um, while, uh, time to pizza is going on.

01:32:01.180 --> 01:32:03.460
It's it's it's yes.

01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:08.260
So while there is one person participating in time to pizza, everybody else gets to participate

01:32:08.260 --> 01:32:16.200
in the find an Osmond machine, literally anywhere that works in the wild and send me a video

01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:20.760
of you playing it and you will get a thing, a Polaroid or something.

01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:23.600
You might get maybe an animal crossing trading card.

01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:24.600
Okay.

01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:25.600
All right.

01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:26.600
I've got dupes anyway.

01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:27.600
I think that's it.

01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:28.600
My b-roll is running out.

01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:29.600
So there it is.

01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:30.600
A classic game of the week.

01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:31.600
Osmond.

01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:33.780
Ah, all right.

01:32:33.780 --> 01:32:36.560
Orange Wright says this contest can be called Time to Osmond.

01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:37.560
I like that.

01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:39.680
It's time to play this game.

01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:40.680
Check it out.

01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:41.680
It really is a very good game.

01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:42.680
It is.

01:32:42.680 --> 01:32:45.480
And if you weren't, if you're on the podcast feed and you can't see the Twitch, you know,

01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:48.560
stuff cause you don't subscribe on Twitch or whatever, like at least like go look up

01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:49.960
a YouTube long play of it.

01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:50.960
GGKS.

01:32:50.960 --> 01:32:51.960
Yeah.

01:32:51.960 --> 01:32:52.960
So you can see the game.

01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:53.960
GGKS.

01:32:53.960 --> 01:32:54.960
What's that?

01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:55.960
Uh, Google.

01:32:55.960 --> 01:32:57.360
It means look it up on Google.

01:32:57.360 --> 01:32:58.360
Stupid.

01:32:58.360 --> 01:32:59.760
Oh, let me Google that for you.com.

01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:00.760
No.

01:33:00.760 --> 01:33:01.760
All right.

01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:06.020
O S M A N if you're curious or Canon Dan, but you do want to put, you don't want to

01:33:06.020 --> 01:33:07.020
put Osmond video games.

01:33:07.020 --> 01:33:13.140
I think there's some youtuber out there will know Osmond was a real Turkish dignitary of

01:33:13.140 --> 01:33:20.740
some kind in the ancient ages, but also now some big youtuber because uh, when I searched

01:33:20.740 --> 01:33:24.700
for the guy, I just put Osmond at first and I got some youtube dude and I was like, video

01:33:24.700 --> 01:33:25.700
game.

01:33:25.700 --> 01:33:34.560
It is Osmond the first or Osmond Ghazi who died in a 1323 who was a Questbuster says

01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:36.080
founded the Ottoman dynasty.

01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:37.080
Ottoman Turks.

01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:38.080
Exactly.

01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:39.080
Today.

01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:40.080
Yeah.

01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:43.600
Even old New York was once New Amsterdam.

01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:44.600
Why they change it?

01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:49.480
I can't say maybe they liked it better that way.

01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:50.480
Sorry.

01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:54.840
I, I can't help it whenever anybody talks about the Turks and stuff is that song comes

01:33:54.840 --> 01:33:55.840
to mind.

01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:56.840
All right.

01:33:56.840 --> 01:33:57.840
Anyway, it's probably, I hope that's not disrespectful.

01:33:57.840 --> 01:33:58.840
Yes.

01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:04.000
The Ottoman dynasty bringers of, you know, footrests everywhere is careful.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:05.340
You don't want to risk a mute.

01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:06.340
Oh, come on.

01:34:06.340 --> 01:34:07.900
Do you actually, do you know what else I played this week?

01:34:07.900 --> 01:34:09.300
I just didn't put it on stream.

01:34:09.300 --> 01:34:12.380
We'll talk about this and we'll get into rapid fire news cause we don't have a break saving

01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:13.380
tonight.

01:34:13.380 --> 01:34:14.380
I played Twitch sings.

01:34:14.380 --> 01:34:18.740
I actually play, it's just, just because I was like, this icon is on my desktop and I've

01:34:18.740 --> 01:34:19.740
never clicked it.

01:34:19.740 --> 01:34:20.740
Click, click.

01:34:20.740 --> 01:34:22.500
And I played a little bit to which things it is.

01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:23.500
It's karaoke revolution.

01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:24.800
It is pretty much exactly that game.

01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:25.800
Did you get your ABBA on?

01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:26.800
I, you fuck.

01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:27.800
Yeah, I did.

01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:30.160
It actually has a pretty robust library of songs.

01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:31.160
I was pretty impressed.

01:34:31.160 --> 01:34:33.000
It had my Atlanta song and everything.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:34.720
Um, do they mute you though?

01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:38.480
If you, I mean, I would assume that they don't know because it's their game.

01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:43.160
So I mean, and you're, it's, they're all karaoke covers, so they're not the real song.

01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:46.880
So, um, and I imagine they must've licensed the rights cause they don't have every song

01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:50.080
ever made, but they have a, and you can do duets.

01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:51.080
That's what I thought was the interesting thing.

01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:55.480
So like a streamer could start and that there's a phone app that does this too.

01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:59.100
And then you can go in and do your half while the other one is going, does that mean I can

01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:01.200
get someone to do islands in the stream with me?

01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:02.200
You could.

01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:03.200
Yeah.

01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:06.620
If I could, if I can fix my sink, um, I'll do islands in the stream, but I get to be

01:35:06.620 --> 01:35:07.620
Dolly.

01:35:07.620 --> 01:35:09.060
I don't want to be Kenny Rogers.

01:35:09.060 --> 01:35:11.740
He's like full of preservatives.

01:35:11.740 --> 01:35:15.300
Have you seen that man's face?

01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:17.280
Islands in the stream.

01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:18.280
Stop.

01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:22.480
Knock it off.

01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:27.080
I had to listen to my wife get triggered to sing songs like by every single word in the

01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:29.720
goddamn like English language.

01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:30.720
Can you just stop?

01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:33.120
Can I get a break from that for just a little bit?

01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:37.920
Dan and I just make up our own lyrics to things and we, then we sing songs about the cat.

01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:42.800
Does that, is that an invite to sing a cat song?

01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:43.800
All right.

01:35:44.780 --> 01:35:45.780
Moving on.

01:35:45.780 --> 01:35:48.220
Oh, you should wait, wait, wait.

01:35:48.220 --> 01:35:50.580
Stop before I'm ready to derail this train a little bit more.

01:35:50.580 --> 01:35:55.400
So like we watched, there's this show on Netflix now, it's like explaining different things

01:35:55.400 --> 01:35:56.580
like that they have there.

01:35:56.580 --> 01:35:59.820
Um, and so one of them was K-pop.

01:35:59.820 --> 01:36:03.820
What is K-pop, you know, explaining what it's K-pop explains.

01:36:03.820 --> 01:36:09.860
So my wife saw that and she does not like K-pop and she also doesn't like the fact that

01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:15.080
I'm like, well, you know, I don't necessarily listen to this stuff, but I've listened to

01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:16.080
some K-pop music.

01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:18.080
Of course you would.

01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:23.920
I liked Monsta X for a hot minute, but the rest of us really cookie cutter.

01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:28.560
Speaking of karaoke, since we're derailing the train, um, I did not know we had one of

01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:31.920
those places downtown, like right across the street from the crest.

01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:35.580
There's one of those places you go upstairs and you can rent a room, a karaoke room and

01:36:35.580 --> 01:36:40.040
like have it and you can get sushi and stuff and drinks like delivered to your little private

01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:41.040
room.

01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:44.600
Like there's a whole, like it's just like a legit karaoke and not just like drunk white

01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:45.600
people karaoke.

01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:47.040
Well, it's both.

01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:49.640
But Coriana Plaza, you can do the same thing.

01:36:49.640 --> 01:36:51.840
Well, but there's one right here.

01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:57.640
There's the place actually that I like to go do karaoke is, um, in, uh, Japantown in

01:36:57.640 --> 01:36:58.640
San Francisco.

01:36:58.640 --> 01:36:59.640
Upstairs.

01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:03.120
Um, they have like a little bar and then they have the karaoke rooms.

01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:04.120
I don't think I've been there.

01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:05.120
Really fun.

01:37:05.660 --> 01:37:07.300
There's a better place in Alameda though.

01:37:07.300 --> 01:37:08.820
Back to video games.

01:37:08.820 --> 01:37:10.940
Let's get to rapid fire news.

01:37:10.940 --> 01:37:12.660
All right.

01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:17.900
Um, so we talked a little bit about what's coming to PlayStation plus in October.

01:37:17.900 --> 01:37:19.580
Let's talk about Microsoft.

01:37:19.580 --> 01:37:23.940
So Microsoft is getting, uh, I love this name.

01:37:23.940 --> 01:37:25.180
This is awesome.

01:37:25.180 --> 01:37:28.900
So the first game on the list is Tembo, the Badass Elephant.

01:37:28.900 --> 01:37:33.000
That's coming to Xbox one and also Friday the 13th, the game that's getting to be the

01:37:33.020 --> 01:37:35.700
second half of October through the middle of November.

01:37:35.700 --> 01:37:36.700
Tembo the Badass Elephant.

01:37:36.700 --> 01:37:37.700
Tembo the Badass Elephant.

01:37:37.700 --> 01:37:39.700
Sign me the fuck up.

01:37:39.700 --> 01:37:40.820
It is your free game.

01:37:40.820 --> 01:37:42.020
He's not Dumbo.

01:37:42.020 --> 01:37:43.440
He's Tembo.

01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:48.500
And then your Xbox 360 compatible games really scraping the bottom of this barrel, Disney's

01:37:48.500 --> 01:37:49.500
Bolt.

01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:51.580
Remember that movie?

01:37:51.580 --> 01:37:55.500
Um, and then Ninja Gaiden three, Razor's Edge.

01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:57.580
That's going to be the second half of October.

01:37:57.580 --> 01:37:58.580
Hmm.

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:00.000
Hmm.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:04.080
And then, uh, let's celebrate 130 years of Nintendo.

01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:05.080
That's right.

01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:10.200
They turned 130 and you may be thinking, well, wait, what am I talking about?

01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:13.680
You guys know that they've made card games before they made video games.

01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:14.680
Jesus Christ.

01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:17.120
I'm not going to explain it like, like it's a big shock or anything.

01:38:17.120 --> 01:38:18.120
Okay.

01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:26.400
But yeah, so 130 and they are, uh, the oldest, um, or they're one of the oldest gaming companies

01:38:27.380 --> 01:38:35.460
Apparently, uh, Taito was founded in 1953 and Sega began in 1960 and they are much older.

01:38:35.460 --> 01:38:37.740
So good for them.

01:38:37.740 --> 01:38:42.460
Wait, not if you're in 1960, you're not older than Nintendo's way older than that.

01:38:42.460 --> 01:38:44.660
No, I said Nintendo is much older than that.

01:38:44.660 --> 01:38:45.660
Oh, okay.

01:38:45.660 --> 01:38:46.660
I get it.

01:38:46.660 --> 01:38:47.660
Yes.

01:38:47.660 --> 01:38:48.660
I know math backwards.

01:38:48.660 --> 01:38:49.660
Do you?

01:38:49.660 --> 01:38:50.660
Okay.

01:38:50.660 --> 01:38:51.660
Moving on.

01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:54.620
Uh, let's talk about speaking of Nintendo.

01:38:54.620 --> 01:38:56.560
Let's talk about the switch online collection.

01:38:56.560 --> 01:39:01.720
Have you, uh, gotten a super Nintendo controller to use with your super Nintendo games on the

01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:02.860
switch?

01:39:02.860 --> 01:39:07.420
If the answer is no, then you're missing out on a cute little extra something, something.

01:39:07.420 --> 01:39:11.040
If you have the switch online, super Nintendo collection and the controller that goes with

01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:17.120
it, when you go into certain super Nintendo games, the collection menu will replace the

01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:21.560
standard sound effects with some from super Mario world.

01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:23.180
Ooh.

01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:27.400
You get sound effect replacements for having spent all of that money on that controller.

01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:28.400
Oh, whatever.

01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:34.000
It's, it's cute, I guess, but, and you know, honestly, I'll, I'll snark in that stuff aside.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:38.120
The super Nintendo controller really was like one of like, like the perfect controller in

01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:39.120
many ways.

01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:42.960
I mean, yeah, it didn't have analog cause gaming wasn't there yet, but for like non

01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:48.000
analog stuff, I don't think there was a better controller in my opinion, anyway.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:49.000
More Nintendo stuff.

01:39:49.660 --> 01:39:54.300
This is interesting because apparently the brand new character, the Dragon Quest hero

01:39:54.300 --> 01:40:00.140
was banned in competitive play in the official Nintendo France tournament.

01:40:00.140 --> 01:40:01.140
That's right.

01:40:01.140 --> 01:40:05.940
Nintendo in France banned one of their own, the Dragon Quest hero characters, but then

01:40:05.940 --> 01:40:08.900
Nintendo ended up unbanning them.

01:40:08.900 --> 01:40:12.900
So Nintendo is standardizing rule sets for all tournaments across the European team cup

01:40:12.900 --> 01:40:15.520
in response to what France did.

01:40:15.540 --> 01:40:20.180
So they're said in a quote, we're harmonizing these rules across Europe to make sure that

01:40:20.180 --> 01:40:26.060
no community or country is disadvantaged when competing in the pan European final next year.

01:40:26.060 --> 01:40:30.340
In terms of future fighter releases, we'll create more detailed guidelines for our tournament

01:40:30.340 --> 01:40:35.140
organizers to make sure that we maintain a level playing field through consistent fighter

01:40:35.140 --> 01:40:36.940
eligibility across Europe.

01:40:36.940 --> 01:40:42.180
And I suppose France had no choice, but to surrender to this official designation from

01:40:42.180 --> 01:40:43.600
Nintendo of Europe.

01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:45.300
So there you go.

01:40:45.300 --> 01:40:47.360
All right, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:48.360
Stuff.

01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:53.480
Um, anyway, uh, Grandia, the first and second game, which are actually a couple of games

01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:59.880
that I super, super, super like, um, are going to have, um, HD remasters coming out for PC

01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:01.800
on October 15th.

01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:06.640
And you know, I'm gonna get it because I fucking love the first Grandia.

01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:09.720
I mean, it'd be nice playing a version that looks good that I don't have to bust out my

01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:12.720
Saturn for and then sit with a dictionary to play.

01:41:12.740 --> 01:41:19.300
Um, but it will have, um, both the English and Japanese audio, um, it will have enhanced

01:41:19.300 --> 01:41:24.700
sprites and texture art, UI improvements, widescreen support and customizable resolutions.

01:41:24.700 --> 01:41:30.020
Um, and it will have steam achievements and you can also of course do custom, uh, controller,

01:41:30.020 --> 01:41:31.780
uh, mapping.

01:41:31.780 --> 01:41:40.140
And then, um, the, uh, I believe that these are already out on switch and there is a patch

01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:43.480
coming out for it in November.

01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:45.360
So there you go.

01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:46.960
Um, but freaking grandia.

01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:47.960
Oh my God.

01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:50.400
One of the best RPGs ever.

01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:51.880
I figured you'd like that news.

01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:53.080
Heck yeah.

01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:58.000
And then, um, house of the dead one and two are both coming to the switch.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:04.520
Um, and it is being, uh, done by a Polish studio called forever entertainment and they're

01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:07.280
bringing us the gun games.

01:42:07.460 --> 01:42:11.460
Hopefully it'll be nice and pretty in the higher definition.

01:42:11.460 --> 01:42:17.860
So about how is it like, if it's coming to the switch, is it a touch screen?

01:42:17.860 --> 01:42:22.620
I mean, don't to, to be determined.

01:42:22.620 --> 01:42:26.820
We don't know if when, when something gets listed on a, you know, rating, it doesn't

01:42:26.820 --> 01:42:27.820
make any sense.

01:42:27.820 --> 01:42:28.820
Like, well, we don't know.

01:42:28.820 --> 01:42:31.980
Maybe we get a specific gun and sensor for it.

01:42:31.980 --> 01:42:32.980
Maybe.

01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:33.980
Hooray.

01:42:33.980 --> 01:42:36.500
Or maybe it's just something you were just going to use the stick to aim and do it that

01:42:36.500 --> 01:42:37.500
way.

01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:38.500
Oh, horrible.

01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:42.260
I know, but it might, it might be having, uh, dark to see this is just joy con aiming.

01:42:42.260 --> 01:42:46.000
Maybe you point the joy con and move it that way using the HD sensor or whatever.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:47.000
Who knows?

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:48.000
We'll see.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:49.000
Yeah.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:50.000
Yeah.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:51.000
All right.

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Insert Marge Simpson noise here.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:53.000
All right.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:56.200
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

01:42:56.200 --> 01:43:00.160
Uh, what is coming out a little sooner than the questionable house of the dead remake

01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:03.120
Loki what's coming out in the U S we have cube world.

01:43:21.940 --> 01:43:26.940
You know, a girl who chants love at the bound of this world.

01:43:26.940 --> 01:43:27.940
Wow.

01:43:27.940 --> 01:43:28.940
That's a name.

01:43:28.940 --> 01:43:31.820
Uh, that is a name that's on PC.

01:43:31.820 --> 01:43:38.300
Nintendo switch and PlayStation four one night stand on PlayStation four and X-Box one.

01:43:38.300 --> 01:43:39.300
My heavens.

01:43:39.300 --> 01:43:41.580
It's a visual novel season.

01:43:41.580 --> 01:43:49.220
Apparently, um, we have a CSO Nia when they cry a phase one for you.

01:43:49.220 --> 01:43:57.180
The replaceable ones on PC, man, with these subtitles, um, Ghostbusters, the video game

01:43:57.180 --> 01:44:04.180
remastered on PC, Nintendo switch PlayStation four and X-Box one also one night stand coming

01:44:04.180 --> 01:44:06.900
out on Nintendo switch.

01:44:06.900 --> 01:44:11.140
And last but not least, Tom Clancy's ghost recon break point on PC, PlayStation four

01:44:11.140 --> 01:44:12.140
and X-Box one.

01:44:12.140 --> 01:44:13.140
All right.

01:44:13.140 --> 01:44:17.460
Well, going over to Japan and checking out the releases there, um, PlayStation four kind

01:44:17.460 --> 01:44:18.460
of slow this week.

01:44:18.460 --> 01:44:23.580
The only real major release that I see on the Japanese realist is the, um, Tom Clancy

01:44:23.580 --> 01:44:27.100
ghost recon break point, cause that's like a world wide release pretty much it's coming

01:44:27.100 --> 01:44:28.100
out everywhere.

01:44:28.100 --> 01:44:31.100
Um, and that is also a, no exception in Japan that is coming out over there.

01:44:31.100 --> 01:44:35.100
Uh, I was trying to see if maybe there's a huge game on Nintendo switch this week.

01:44:35.100 --> 01:44:40.180
That is the reason why they're not putting out anything, um, really, uh, on the PlayStation

01:44:40.180 --> 01:44:41.180
four.

01:44:41.180 --> 01:44:45.040
But, uh, the biggest things I see is, uh, that there are some new Nintendo switch controllers

01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:46.040
in different colors.

01:44:46.040 --> 01:44:48.700
I know some people are going to be one of like the purple and the orange, maybe.

01:44:48.700 --> 01:44:51.900
Although I think a lot of that, I think a lot of those colors are releasing here.

01:44:52.020 --> 01:44:54.500
Um, that is on the list for the switch this week.

01:44:54.500 --> 01:44:59.980
Otherwise the only other big thing I see is the amnesia later, uh, cross crowd crowd for

01:44:59.980 --> 01:45:05.220
Nintendo switch in a regular and limited edition, uh, and super robot wars V.

01:45:05.220 --> 01:45:07.520
Those are really the only big releases this week in Japan.

01:45:07.520 --> 01:45:11.740
So, um, a bit of a slower week, all things considered, but there's a few things.

01:45:11.740 --> 01:45:12.740
How about Europe?

01:45:12.740 --> 01:45:13.740
Dark Sakura.

01:45:13.740 --> 01:45:17.220
In Europe, we have a handful on the 30th.

01:45:17.220 --> 01:45:22.860
We have ghost recon, break point, gold, ultimate edition, sniper elite three, ultimate edition.

01:45:22.860 --> 01:45:29.940
Um, on October 3rd, we have Sega mega drive mini.

01:45:29.940 --> 01:45:32.620
This is when it says Sega mega drive that fast.

01:45:32.620 --> 01:45:35.900
I didn't realize it was so delayed for Europe because you know, the one here is out.

01:45:35.900 --> 01:45:36.900
The Genesis one is out.

01:45:36.900 --> 01:45:41.100
Um, Ghostbusters, the video game remastered comes out.

01:45:41.980 --> 01:45:48.340
Friday the 13th, the game ultimate slasher edition also comes out and ghost recon break

01:45:48.340 --> 01:45:49.340
point.

01:45:49.340 --> 01:45:55.300
Um, I guess the normal version is that on October 3rd.

01:45:55.300 --> 01:45:56.300
Cool.

01:45:56.300 --> 01:45:57.300
That's it.

01:45:57.300 --> 01:46:02.060
All right, let's go to our mailbag.

01:46:02.060 --> 01:46:06.680
Every week we invite your emails to participate at orange lounge radio.com and we read our

01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:08.180
favorites here on the show.

01:46:08.180 --> 01:46:09.980
My favorites are zero cause there aren't any.

01:46:09.980 --> 01:46:11.940
There are no emails this week.

01:46:11.940 --> 01:46:12.940
What a pity.

01:46:12.940 --> 01:46:13.940
You know what this means?

01:46:13.940 --> 01:46:14.940
Oh, that's right.

01:46:14.940 --> 01:46:18.820
We get to do drag race talk, but there's no drag race airing right now.

01:46:18.820 --> 01:46:20.460
They're doing drag race Canada.

01:46:20.460 --> 01:46:21.460
Okay.

01:46:21.460 --> 01:46:22.620
So I'll ask this question.

01:46:22.620 --> 01:46:25.820
What do you think of all the, cause remember folks, when you don't send us emails, we have

01:46:25.820 --> 01:46:29.020
no choice but to talk about RuPaul's drag race, Loki's favorite thing in the world.

01:46:29.020 --> 01:46:31.600
Um, so what do you think about all these international versions?

01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:32.600
There's Canadian.

01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:33.600
We're going to get Australian.

01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:34.600
UK.

01:46:34.600 --> 01:46:35.600
The UK is coming out soon.

01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:36.600
Thailand's great.

01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:37.600
Thailand's great.

01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:39.200
I'm, I'm going to be honest.

01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:43.080
This is why I'm a little bit like, Oh yeah, that was the threat we made to the listeners.

01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:45.400
I'm kind of burned out on drag race.

01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:49.920
Like I don't like, I know they're making a season 12 and I'm so burned out.

01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:53.120
Like the time to do these international versions was six years ago.

01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:54.120
Yeah.

01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:55.120
I don't know though.

01:46:55.120 --> 01:46:59.320
I was kind of wanting to watch Dragula this season because they have a drag king on their

01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:02.640
land and cider who I've seen perform a few times in LA.

01:47:02.640 --> 01:47:03.640
Absolutely phenomenal.

01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:04.640
Yeah.

01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:08.940
But you know, that big thing went on about how misogynist the word fish is.

01:47:08.940 --> 01:47:12.180
And just for anyone who does not know, you should cover Dragula.

01:47:12.180 --> 01:47:16.540
I thought they talked about it, but some of my local queen buddies were talking about

01:47:16.540 --> 01:47:22.900
it that, you know, typically in drag, the word fish is used to mean extremely feminine,

01:47:22.900 --> 01:47:29.880
which comes from a derogatory about female anatomy and about certain odors that could

01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:31.700
come out of it.

01:47:31.700 --> 01:47:37.300
And so basically you're calling femininity a smelly vagina.

01:47:37.300 --> 01:47:41.060
And that in and of itself is highly misogynist.

01:47:41.060 --> 01:47:42.060
Stop it.

01:47:42.060 --> 01:47:47.740
At any rate, there's been, I had to block a couple of the, um, the Bay Area Queens over

01:47:47.740 --> 01:47:54.300
it because they just didn't get it like, Oh, well, but I have a shrine to femininity and

01:47:54.300 --> 01:47:57.620
um, yeah, so you're objectifying us then, right?

01:47:57.620 --> 01:48:04.260
We're just something to have in a shrine and not to actually, I have a fish friend.

01:48:04.260 --> 01:48:06.100
Our fish died this week.

01:48:06.100 --> 01:48:07.100
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:48:07.100 --> 01:48:12.580
Well, I say our, because it was basically the kid's fish, but I had to take care of

01:48:12.580 --> 01:48:13.580
it.

01:48:13.580 --> 01:48:14.580
You had to flush it down the toilet.

01:48:14.580 --> 01:48:15.580
What kind of fish was it?

01:48:15.580 --> 01:48:16.580
Oh, I just threw it away.

01:48:16.580 --> 01:48:17.580
Oh, that's sad.

01:48:17.580 --> 01:48:18.580
What kind of fish?

01:48:18.580 --> 01:48:19.580
It was a beta.

01:48:19.580 --> 01:48:20.580
Oh, okay.

01:48:20.580 --> 01:48:21.580
Let's buy another one.

01:48:21.580 --> 01:48:22.580
Anyway.

01:48:22.580 --> 01:48:26.840
Um, the thing about Dragula, I don't like, I think it's very stylish and I like that

01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:27.840
style of drag.

01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:28.840
I think it's really fun.

01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:31.540
I think those extermination challenges are the stupidest thing in the world.

01:48:31.540 --> 01:48:32.540
They're too much.

01:48:32.540 --> 01:48:33.540
They have nothing to do with drag.

01:48:33.540 --> 01:48:35.060
I don't, it ruins the show for me.

01:48:35.060 --> 01:48:38.820
So anyway, yeah, that's it though.

01:48:38.820 --> 01:48:42.340
But I do think it's rad that Dragula has more variety in the performers.

01:48:42.340 --> 01:48:43.340
That's pretty cool.

01:48:43.340 --> 01:48:44.820
See what happens when we talk about fish and the cat cones.

01:48:44.820 --> 01:48:51.420
I know it's like, it's like Mr. Smoosh got fish for me, chicken, chicken, no, now he's

01:48:51.420 --> 01:48:52.420
just scratching his back.

01:48:52.420 --> 01:48:53.420
All right.

01:48:53.420 --> 01:48:54.420
Anyway, let's move on.

01:48:54.420 --> 01:48:57.540
Uh, let's talk about, uh, more news.

01:48:57.540 --> 01:49:00.380
We're going to get to, uh, Loki with another story for us.

01:49:00.380 --> 01:49:01.420
All right.

01:49:01.420 --> 01:49:07.140
So, uh, we talked a little bit about, like I said, the whole PlayStation event, and now

01:49:07.140 --> 01:49:11.900
we're going to talk about the, uh, after the state of play, there was a whole Microsoft

01:49:11.900 --> 01:49:14.100
inside Xbox presentation.

01:49:14.100 --> 01:49:17.860
So stuff that they talked about then, of course, um, Xbox game pass came up.

01:49:17.860 --> 01:49:22.140
So they talked about new games that are going to be coming out on Xbox game pass, including

01:49:22.140 --> 01:49:26.300
Jump Force, Bloodstained, Ritual of the Night, and Lego worlds are being added on the Xbox

01:49:26.300 --> 01:49:27.420
one side.

01:49:27.420 --> 01:49:33.860
And then on PC, Cities Skylines, Saints Row IV, and Bad North, and Dirt Rally 2.0.

01:49:33.860 --> 01:49:40.020
They said that the Xbox games app or pass app has been updated as well with some additional

01:49:40.020 --> 01:49:45.180
improvements, including, uh, they said there's going to be more indie games coming to games

01:49:45.180 --> 01:49:52.160
pass, including Genesis Noir, Lonely Mountain Downhill, and Demons Tilt.

01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:53.660
And then what else?

01:49:54.660 --> 01:50:00.980
There's going to be a brand new, um, game comedy puzzle game called Felix the Reaper

01:50:00.980 --> 01:50:05.740
that's going to be available on October 17th, available on game pass that day as well.

01:50:05.740 --> 01:50:09.900
They talked a little bit about Project xCloud, their streaming service that's going to be

01:50:09.900 --> 01:50:11.100
available soon.

01:50:11.100 --> 01:50:16.700
So apparently if you're in the US, UK, or Korea, you can apply to be able to test that

01:50:16.700 --> 01:50:17.700
out.

01:50:17.700 --> 01:50:22.940
And so if you have an Android device and a wireless Xbox one controller, you can sign

01:50:22.940 --> 01:50:29.620
up to preview it and, um, so I will have to check it out except I don't have a wireless

01:50:29.620 --> 01:50:33.100
Xbox one controller, although I could use another controller.

01:50:33.100 --> 01:50:35.860
So might as well pick that up and maybe sign up for that.

01:50:35.860 --> 01:50:42.340
Um, and then of course, early access for, uh, or the, there's the game Atlas that was

01:50:42.340 --> 01:50:44.780
a pirate MMO game that was on steam early access.

01:50:44.780 --> 01:50:50.660
That's coming to Xbox one on October 8th, and it's also going to be available simultaneously

01:50:50.660 --> 01:50:53.200
on Xbox and PC.

01:50:53.200 --> 01:50:58.620
I'm assuming, um, they're going to have the same game on both platforms.

01:50:58.620 --> 01:51:04.940
And then there's a brand new Xbox one X and Xbox one S hardware bundles that include Forza

01:51:04.940 --> 01:51:09.400
horizon four and the Lego speed champions expansion.

01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:10.700
So that's about it.

01:51:10.700 --> 01:51:11.700
I liked it.

01:51:11.700 --> 01:51:12.700
That was time.

01:51:12.700 --> 01:51:13.700
The same day as Sony's thing.

01:51:13.700 --> 01:51:17.140
I'm sure that was completely coincidental and not intentional.

01:51:17.140 --> 01:51:21.900
One bit, uh, she hold 10 in our chat over at Twitch TV slash VOG network says Xbox is

01:51:21.900 --> 01:51:24.920
working hard or excuse me, Xbox is really working hard.

01:51:24.920 --> 01:51:26.100
It will pay off soon.

01:51:26.100 --> 01:51:29.540
You know, I do think the cloud thing is going to be very interesting.

01:51:29.540 --> 01:51:33.580
I'm really curious to see how that's going to change up Microsoft's landscape.

01:51:33.580 --> 01:51:38.940
I feel like I'm, I'm definitely personally and more excited about what Xbox is doing

01:51:38.940 --> 01:51:42.740
with that and Microsoft, I guess with the cloud then maybe like Google stadium.

01:51:42.740 --> 01:51:47.500
So does that X cloud stuff tie in with, is that only games that you own or is that like

01:51:47.500 --> 01:51:53.980
if I have Xbox game pass and I have X cloud, then I also get access to all those games

01:51:53.980 --> 01:51:58.240
and I can play them streaming cause that I could see would be very interesting, especially

01:51:58.240 --> 01:52:00.140
with all the deals that they had with that.

01:52:00.140 --> 01:52:01.140
Yeah.

01:52:01.140 --> 01:52:02.460
Um, that may be worth it.

01:52:02.460 --> 01:52:03.460
Yeah.

01:52:03.460 --> 01:52:06.940
I would love if I don't have to do these huge downloads to do things on game pass anymore.

01:52:06.940 --> 01:52:09.180
Like maybe I can just fire up gears five on the cloud.

01:52:09.180 --> 01:52:12.220
I might be more inclined to test it out and see if it's something I would like want to

01:52:12.220 --> 01:52:13.220
download.

01:52:13.220 --> 01:52:14.220
Yeah.

01:52:14.220 --> 01:52:15.500
So it'd be very curious to see how that all kind of comes together in the next couple

01:52:15.500 --> 01:52:16.500
of months.

01:52:16.500 --> 01:52:17.500
Yeah.

01:52:17.500 --> 01:52:18.500
Okay.

01:52:18.500 --> 01:52:19.500
Cause it's like October is supposed to be the launch month for this, right?

01:52:19.500 --> 01:52:24.500
Or at least at the beta or like the preview or whatever they're calling it, it'd be interesting.

01:52:24.500 --> 01:52:25.500
Excited for it.

01:52:25.500 --> 01:52:26.500
All right.

01:52:26.500 --> 01:52:29.580
Well, I'm also excited for an updated version of bloodstained.

01:52:29.580 --> 01:52:30.580
That's right.

01:52:30.580 --> 01:52:34.740
Bloodstained is going to be getting a switch update and it's been delayed and there's been

01:52:34.740 --> 01:52:35.740
apologies.

01:52:35.740 --> 01:52:38.940
And you know, the switch version, which is the version I have of bloodstain has some

01:52:38.940 --> 01:52:41.780
problems that ended up getting apologized for.

01:52:41.780 --> 01:52:46.100
There was supposed to be several small updates, but then there was a big one that got delayed

01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:47.220
and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

01:52:47.220 --> 01:52:52.340
So they're saying that the new patch will be focusing on four areas, visual fidelity,

01:52:52.340 --> 01:52:55.500
loading times, particle effects, and input lag.

01:52:55.500 --> 01:52:57.700
And they really get into the weeds of this.

01:52:57.700 --> 01:53:01.540
I'm not going to get into all the, you know, details, but they are working on it.

01:53:01.540 --> 01:53:06.040
They're going to be doling out two updates and the first will sport the vast majority

01:53:06.040 --> 01:53:07.040
of changes.

01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:08.980
The second will improve performance.

01:53:08.980 --> 01:53:15.700
So they are saying the goal is the end of November, assuming that there is no further

01:53:15.700 --> 01:53:16.700
delay.

01:53:16.700 --> 01:53:19.060
It should be noted that the game is not even out in Japan yet.

01:53:19.060 --> 01:53:24.340
So October 24th is when the game is supposed to come out in Japan.

01:53:24.340 --> 01:53:30.140
The Xbox edition is going to be getting some extra stuff, some DLC, a balance update and

01:53:30.140 --> 01:53:32.600
some HDR fixes and so forth.

01:53:32.600 --> 01:53:38.940
So there's still much more to come with bloodstained, but it should be pointed out that Igarashi

01:53:38.940 --> 01:53:44.780
is still planning on making bloodstained a series in an interview with Game Informer

01:53:44.780 --> 01:53:49.120
because, you know, I know we heard about the cutbacks, but there at least is still like

01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:51.080
one or two more issues of Game Informer.

01:53:51.080 --> 01:53:57.560
So Game Informer had an interview with Igarashi who talked about the pressure of Kickstarter

01:53:57.560 --> 01:54:01.620
and so forth, because that's how the game was funded years ago, right?

01:54:01.620 --> 01:54:03.600
Because it was years ago.

01:54:03.600 --> 01:54:07.300
So anyway, quality control, he said was the hardest part.

01:54:07.300 --> 01:54:10.420
When you're working with an outsourced studio, it can be difficult to match the quality line

01:54:10.420 --> 01:54:11.740
when things changed.

01:54:11.740 --> 01:54:15.100
With bloodstained, we would first share our goal with the outsourced studio and make sure

01:54:15.100 --> 01:54:19.340
we both agree and determine the necessities, but even with proper planning, it's difficult

01:54:19.340 --> 01:54:20.420
to reach.

01:54:20.420 --> 01:54:25.260
So anyway, he does say that bloodstained is a starting ground for the next step and wants

01:54:25.260 --> 01:54:28.740
to make a series after putting in the effort with this.

01:54:28.740 --> 01:54:32.540
So we'll see if maybe there's going to be a bloodstained 2 or something else, maybe

01:54:32.540 --> 01:54:35.220
in the same universe, maybe just not the same name.

01:54:35.220 --> 01:54:36.220
Bring back my dude.

01:54:36.220 --> 01:54:37.220
Who knows?

01:54:37.220 --> 01:54:39.180
Bring back my dude.

01:54:39.180 --> 01:54:41.860
Fifth Dream today in chat says, I'm mad about the Switch screw up.

01:54:41.860 --> 01:54:45.140
They're delaying all the DLC I paid for and the Kickstarter to fix it.

01:54:45.140 --> 01:54:48.620
So well, I'm glad that they are delaying DLC.

01:54:48.620 --> 01:54:50.060
I'm glad they're fixing it.

01:54:50.060 --> 01:54:53.140
You know, you know, not every company always fixes.

01:54:53.140 --> 01:54:54.140
I get.

01:54:54.140 --> 01:54:55.140
But like, you know what I'm saying?

01:54:55.140 --> 01:54:56.140
Not necessarily that.

01:54:56.140 --> 01:55:00.860
Yeah, it sucks that your DLC is being delayed, but I'm glad they're focusing on the fixes

01:55:00.860 --> 01:55:04.660
versus the DLC like some other studios.

01:55:04.660 --> 01:55:05.660
Trying to get more money first.

01:55:05.660 --> 01:55:06.660
Yeah, I get it.

01:55:06.660 --> 01:55:07.660
I get it.

01:55:07.660 --> 01:55:08.660
So.

01:55:08.660 --> 01:55:09.660
Cool.

01:55:09.660 --> 01:55:12.720
I still need to sit down and really play the game more.

01:55:12.720 --> 01:55:15.300
But when I heard they were going to fix the Switch version, I was like, well, let me just

01:55:15.300 --> 01:55:16.740
wait till the fix comes out then.

01:55:16.740 --> 01:55:19.180
I mean, I've waited this long to play bloodstained.

01:55:19.180 --> 01:55:20.180
What's another couple of months?

01:55:20.180 --> 01:55:21.180
Right.

01:55:21.180 --> 01:55:22.180
I'd love to see you in chat.

01:55:22.180 --> 01:55:24.180
The PS4 version is really good.

01:55:24.180 --> 01:55:25.180
Was that?

01:55:25.180 --> 01:55:28.100
The PS4 one is pretty, pretty good.

01:55:28.100 --> 01:55:29.100
That's cool.

01:55:29.100 --> 01:55:30.100
Yeah.

01:55:30.100 --> 01:55:32.420
Looking back, I probably should have got a different console or something, but I don't

01:55:32.420 --> 01:55:33.420
know.

01:55:33.420 --> 01:55:34.420
I love my Switch.

01:55:35.180 --> 01:55:38.140
At least they're trying to avoid another Mighty No. 9 situation.

01:55:38.140 --> 01:55:39.140
Yeah, they are.

01:55:39.140 --> 01:55:40.860
So at least there's that.

01:55:40.860 --> 01:55:41.860
All right.

01:55:41.860 --> 01:55:43.180
Let's move on to another story.

01:55:43.180 --> 01:55:46.620
Speaking of things on the Nintendo Switch, right, DarkSakura?

01:55:46.620 --> 01:55:47.620
Right.

01:55:47.620 --> 01:55:52.500
So the original Yokai Watch, which I hate how they put the hyphen in it.

01:55:52.500 --> 01:55:55.460
The word doesn't need a hyphen or whatever.

01:55:55.460 --> 01:56:01.900
Anyway, Yokai Watch, the very original one, is going to be coming on to the Switch.

01:56:01.900 --> 01:56:08.420
And there is a second trailer up for it now on the official YouTube channel, and they're

01:56:08.420 --> 01:56:10.900
getting online battle support.

01:56:10.900 --> 01:56:15.620
And so this is looking like it's going to give you quite a bit more about the original

01:56:15.620 --> 01:56:16.620
Yokai Watch.

01:56:16.620 --> 01:56:20.440
I mean, there's not really much else to say because it's Yokai Watch, but it's nice for

01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:26.780
people who might not have had the experience of playing it when it came out.

01:56:26.780 --> 01:56:35.220
Of course, the trailer for it is in Japanese, but hopefully we'll be getting an English

01:56:35.220 --> 01:56:37.860
version for fans of the series.

01:56:37.860 --> 01:56:39.860
So it looks pretty good though.

01:56:39.860 --> 01:56:44.080
I mean, nice and clean, and looks like it could be fun.

01:56:44.080 --> 01:56:48.300
So there you go, Yokai Watch.

01:56:48.300 --> 01:56:49.300
So anyway.

01:56:49.300 --> 01:56:56.500
All right, so something that came out of State of Play, the PlayStation event, was some more

01:56:56.500 --> 01:57:01.980
details on Call of Duty Modern Warfare, which is releasing here pretty soon.

01:57:01.980 --> 01:57:09.620
And one thing that they announced is, unfortunately, that the Modern Warfare survival mode, part

01:57:09.620 --> 01:57:15.840
of the spec ops thing, is going to be exclusive on the PlayStation 4 until October 1st, 2020.

01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:22.180
So if you're looking to play that part of spec or special ops, you're going to have

01:57:22.180 --> 01:57:26.000
to buy it on PlayStation or wait a whole year for the brand new Call of Duty game to come

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:31.360
out and then they'll release that on there.

01:57:31.360 --> 01:57:38.160
Of course, there's been some backlash regarding it, but according to the developers, they're

01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:42.880
saying that, well, it's only like 1% of the game, to which I said, well, if it's only

01:57:42.880 --> 01:57:47.660
1% of the game, then why lock it as a console exclusive feature then if it's not such a

01:57:47.660 --> 01:57:48.660
big deal?

01:57:48.660 --> 01:57:49.660
Obviously.

01:57:49.660 --> 01:57:53.000
But you personally would pick up these games on PS4 anyway, right?

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:54.840
Yeah, or PC.

01:57:54.840 --> 01:57:55.840
I don't know.

01:57:55.840 --> 01:57:56.840
Depends.

01:57:56.840 --> 01:58:02.520
So, yeah, probably on PlayStation 4, but I'd only really care.

01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:03.520
It's the whole...

01:58:03.520 --> 01:58:05.320
Yeah, I get it.

01:58:05.320 --> 01:58:09.520
It's a very Activision thing to do.

01:58:09.520 --> 01:58:13.680
Maybe that should just be like a trademark, a saying, it's an Activision thing to do.

01:58:13.680 --> 01:58:14.680
Yeah.

01:58:14.680 --> 01:58:16.800
So I, yeah, I don't know.

01:58:16.800 --> 01:58:19.040
But that must be, what did they get in exchange for that?

01:58:19.040 --> 01:58:21.120
They get like free ad dollars promotion.

01:58:21.120 --> 01:58:28.340
They probably get more featuring on the PlayStation store, which I'm sure a lot of people just

01:58:28.340 --> 01:58:30.040
impulse buy things like that.

01:58:30.040 --> 01:58:34.360
They see the ad for it and just push X to spend money and they do it if they're a fan

01:58:34.360 --> 01:58:35.360
of the series.

01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:39.440
And I don't know if that necessarily is going to be a big push for that, but it still kind

01:58:39.440 --> 01:58:43.920
of sucks that you feel like you're not really getting a full game on other platforms.

01:58:43.920 --> 01:58:44.920
Right.

01:58:44.920 --> 01:58:45.920
All right.

01:58:45.920 --> 01:58:50.480
Well, before we get to some Discord calls, if you want to be on the show, head on over

01:58:50.480 --> 01:58:54.360
to our green room at our Discord server, vognetwork.com slash Discord.

01:58:54.360 --> 01:58:56.840
That's vognetwork.com slash Discord.

01:58:56.840 --> 01:59:00.120
If you want to be on the show, or you can ask some questions in our chat room as well

01:59:00.120 --> 01:59:03.040
over at twitch.tv slash vognetwork.

01:59:03.040 --> 01:59:08.200
But before we get to that, we have one more story tonight and it's another yikes involving

01:59:08.200 --> 01:59:10.560
the game Fallout 76.

01:59:10.560 --> 01:59:15.420
Just when you thought it was over with all the yikes things going on with Fallout 76.

01:59:15.420 --> 01:59:18.800
This actually has nothing to do with the game itself.

01:59:18.800 --> 01:59:24.680
It has to do with the collectible edition of the game, the $150 collectible issue of

01:59:24.680 --> 01:59:25.680
the game.

01:59:25.680 --> 01:59:31.300
A recall was issued by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission for the power armor

01:59:31.300 --> 01:59:36.280
helmet for Fallout 76 sold exclusively by GameStop, as if they haven't had enough bad

01:59:36.280 --> 01:59:37.280
news.

01:59:37.280 --> 01:59:38.960
Well, technically it's not the collector's edition of the game.

01:59:38.960 --> 01:59:41.520
It was a collectible helmet that they released.

01:59:41.520 --> 01:59:46.680
They did have now the two, you know, not to get it confused with the helmet that did come

01:59:46.680 --> 01:59:47.680
with the collectors.

01:59:48.560 --> 01:59:54.000
But it's a, it's another helmet that was also collectible that they were selling it games

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:55.000
up.

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:56.000
I see.

01:59:56.000 --> 02:00:01.160
So anyhow, noted on the website, which you can see yourself because it is a government

02:00:01.160 --> 02:00:07.400
website at, I think it's cpsc.gov and you can see this for yourself.

02:00:07.400 --> 02:00:11.560
The fabric insert used for the helmet may contain mold.

02:00:11.560 --> 02:00:17.080
And if you have a compromised immune system that could be trouble or allergies, even just

02:00:17.080 --> 02:00:21.600
allergies, because depending on how bad they are, I mean, it could close air passages and

02:00:21.600 --> 02:00:22.600
all that too.

02:00:22.600 --> 02:00:23.600
So yikes.

02:00:23.600 --> 02:00:28.340
Now, uh, and a quick follow up to this story running around the internet Chronicle collectibles

02:00:28.340 --> 02:00:34.080
who made this helmet did want to clarify the only affected units are the Nuka Cola branded

02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:36.020
red helmets.

02:00:36.020 --> 02:00:39.640
Only 32 units were actually reported as being sold.

02:00:39.640 --> 02:00:40.640
I'm sorry.

02:00:40.640 --> 02:00:41.640
I'm sorry.

02:00:41.640 --> 02:00:51.640
Well, then I guess it's not such a big deal now that I think of it only, only 32 units.

02:00:51.640 --> 02:00:59.100
Only 32 of these were actually sold in the entire fucking country, 32 were sold.

02:00:59.100 --> 02:01:04.520
And apparently the customers that were impacted have been reached any other power armor helmets.

02:01:04.520 --> 02:01:07.640
Cause I guess there's other types were not recalled.

02:01:07.640 --> 02:01:15.320
So to be fair, they may have sold more of them, but of this particular brand, they sold

02:01:15.320 --> 02:01:19.640
32.

02:01:19.640 --> 02:01:23.280
There's that many people watching on Twitch currently.

02:01:23.280 --> 02:01:25.160
Congratulations.

02:01:25.160 --> 02:01:30.680
We make up the entire population of the world of who bought this collectible.

02:01:30.680 --> 02:01:33.040
Oh boy.

02:01:33.040 --> 02:01:35.040
Fifth dream today just does want to point out.

02:01:35.040 --> 02:01:37.400
It's only if you wear it, lol.

02:01:37.400 --> 02:01:40.680
Thour 66 says, at least it's not radiation.

02:01:40.680 --> 02:01:41.680
That's true.

02:01:41.680 --> 02:01:43.320
Uh, here's the thing though.

02:01:43.320 --> 02:01:47.920
It's just one of those things where like, like, again, I hate to dog pile on this game,

02:01:47.920 --> 02:01:52.160
but you know, there's a lot of questionable stuff with this game to be, it's just like

02:01:52.160 --> 02:01:57.020
another one of those things where it's just like, here's another one, even though it was

02:01:57.020 --> 02:01:59.720
only 32 units, it's still like, it's mold.

02:01:59.720 --> 02:02:00.720
It's gross.

02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:04.480
People don't like to hear that their products that they paid $150 for have mold, whether

02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:06.200
there's only 32 people or not.

02:02:06.200 --> 02:02:09.320
So it's just, wow.

02:02:09.320 --> 02:02:11.840
Anyway, let's move on.

02:02:11.840 --> 02:02:15.080
Let's see if we have anybody in our discord server that wants to give us a call.

02:02:15.080 --> 02:02:16.440
I actually have some good news.

02:02:16.440 --> 02:02:17.440
Uh, sure.

02:02:17.440 --> 02:02:19.720
Go for it while I get our discord service set up here.

02:02:19.720 --> 02:02:24.000
One of our dear friends and listeners, um, who we haven't probably heard from in a little

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:29.960
while has been kind enough to arrange me to get the links awakening Slurpee cups from

02:02:29.960 --> 02:02:30.960
Canada.

02:02:30.960 --> 02:02:31.960
Oh yeah.

02:02:31.960 --> 02:02:34.680
I was seeing some of this exchange on like Twitter or Facebook or something.

02:02:34.680 --> 02:02:36.120
Hopefully it will arrive soon.

02:02:36.120 --> 02:02:41.120
It was mailed out on Tuesday, so I'm doing the happy dance cause I want my Zelda cups

02:02:41.120 --> 02:02:44.520
to stay in.

02:02:44.520 --> 02:02:45.520
Okay.

02:02:45.520 --> 02:02:48.640
Uh, you were saying, you were saying something else about Slurpees in our chat.

02:02:48.640 --> 02:02:53.100
Like I guess yes, black cherry Slurpee and it's black.

02:02:53.100 --> 02:02:54.360
It's goth as fuck.

02:02:54.360 --> 02:02:55.880
Does that mean it makes your tongue black too?

02:02:55.880 --> 02:02:57.960
I hope so.

02:02:57.960 --> 02:03:00.840
I want everyone to see my deathly power from the inside.

02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:02.840
The black is actually mold.

02:03:03.560 --> 02:03:07.840
No black cherry deliciousness flavor and he makes that with the Coke though.

02:03:07.840 --> 02:03:09.840
You know, and we'll tell you how to mix it with Coke.

02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:13.720
All right, well we do have a call waiting in the green room to come on the show and

02:03:13.720 --> 02:03:17.340
I knew this actually somebody that wanted to come on tonight to talk about something

02:03:17.340 --> 02:03:19.080
a little, I thought this was kind of unique.

02:03:19.080 --> 02:03:21.160
So hi, you're on orange on radio.

02:03:21.160 --> 02:03:22.160
Who's this?

02:03:22.160 --> 02:03:23.160
That's Shane.

02:03:23.160 --> 02:03:25.360
Hey Shane, welcome back to OLR.

02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:26.360
You've been on the show.

02:03:26.360 --> 02:03:27.360
It's only been a week.

02:03:27.360 --> 02:03:28.360
I know, right?

02:03:28.360 --> 02:03:30.240
Like you've been calling a lot lately.

02:03:30.240 --> 02:03:31.520
How's how's things been with you?

02:03:31.520 --> 02:03:32.520
Things happen.

02:03:32.520 --> 02:03:33.520
What?

02:03:33.520 --> 02:03:34.520
Fine.

02:03:34.520 --> 02:03:37.480
I said, well, a lot has like things keep happening that make me call.

02:03:37.480 --> 02:03:38.480
So

02:03:38.480 --> 02:03:39.480
Well, what do you want to talk about tonight?

02:03:39.480 --> 02:03:41.680
Cause I think this, you told me a little bit about this beforehand.

02:03:41.680 --> 02:03:42.680
I thought it was interesting.

02:03:42.680 --> 02:03:43.680
So

02:03:43.680 --> 02:03:44.680
yes.

02:03:44.680 --> 02:03:50.360
So there is, I'm sure there are other ones, but we just found out about a virtual reality

02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:55.560
gym here where we live and it's kind of interesting.

02:03:55.560 --> 02:03:56.560
Okay.

02:03:56.560 --> 02:03:58.700
So it's called black box VR.

02:03:58.700 --> 02:04:03.580
First of all, it only has two locations according to the website, one in San Francisco and one

02:04:03.580 --> 02:04:04.800
in Boise.

02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:09.240
That's it, which is just really random.

02:04:09.240 --> 02:04:13.080
But in it, it's you play a game basically.

02:04:13.080 --> 02:04:18.140
And all the like attacks and stuff you do are different types of workouts.

02:04:18.140 --> 02:04:27.160
Like some are rowing, some are chest presses, some are squats and the game is like a MOBA.

02:04:27.160 --> 02:04:32.940
So you can send out units, your computer opponent will send out units and there's like an elemental

02:04:32.940 --> 02:04:38.540
wheel and you can pick units to send out and you have to do to send out a unit.

02:04:38.540 --> 02:04:44.640
You have to like do different like punches, just quickly for the Twitch people were playing

02:04:44.640 --> 02:04:46.280
their little commercial.

02:04:46.280 --> 02:04:49.260
That is the best kind of thing that you can sort of see it in action, like how this whole

02:04:49.260 --> 02:04:50.260
thing works.

02:04:50.260 --> 02:04:51.260
Yeah.

02:04:51.260 --> 02:04:52.260
But it is their commercial.

02:04:52.260 --> 02:04:54.320
That is pretty cool.

02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:56.340
And yeah, it's, it's a lot of fun.

02:04:56.340 --> 02:05:02.220
In fact, I kind of forget that I'm working out except I get tired so quick because I

02:05:02.220 --> 02:05:04.820
hate working out.

02:05:04.820 --> 02:05:08.920
But you've got like two force fields on the side of your crystal and they have two force

02:05:08.920 --> 02:05:13.500
fields and you basically have to break down at least one of the force fields using these

02:05:13.500 --> 02:05:19.220
different workouts in order to attack the crystal and if you break their crystal, then

02:05:19.220 --> 02:05:21.780
you win that round.

02:05:21.780 --> 02:05:27.060
And it goes for about three rounds per person you fight, but they'll send out different

02:05:27.060 --> 02:05:29.720
types of units that have different elements attached.

02:05:29.720 --> 02:05:37.820
So you have to counter them and it's, it's a lot of fun and I really can't stress how

02:05:37.820 --> 02:05:39.860
awesome it is.

02:05:39.860 --> 02:05:47.060
All I gotta say though, just normally playing VR stuff and then watching that last, the

02:05:47.060 --> 02:05:54.100
last seconds of that clip where he's wiping his sweat off of his brow, I hope they disinfect

02:05:54.100 --> 02:05:56.460
those headsets pretty well.

02:05:56.460 --> 02:05:59.980
I hope that there's like, I assume they do.

02:05:59.980 --> 02:06:06.140
They're not sparing any expense it feels like because they're using Vive Pros and they have

02:06:06.140 --> 02:06:11.040
little things that attach to your hands and they have this like box once you're done that

02:06:11.040 --> 02:06:15.700
like sanitizes everything and you keep the little wristbands but not the attachments

02:06:15.700 --> 02:06:16.700
that go on them.

02:06:16.700 --> 02:06:19.020
They give you a headband.

02:06:19.020 --> 02:06:20.220
It's pricey though.

02:06:20.220 --> 02:06:24.980
We're doing a 30 day free trial right now, but they've, I guess they're pretty new because

02:06:24.980 --> 02:06:29.580
they've kind of fluctuated in price and they're still taking feedback to send to their engineers

02:06:29.580 --> 02:06:32.880
on like, well this is too hard or this isn't working right.

02:06:32.880 --> 02:06:39.340
But like for a 30 day membership where you go as much as you want, it's like $240.

02:06:39.340 --> 02:06:45.420
Yeah, but it's been jumping around in price because I guess when they started it was over

02:06:45.420 --> 02:06:46.700
$300.

02:06:46.700 --> 02:06:53.260
So doing the 30 days is fine because we have unlimited for those 30 days.

02:06:53.260 --> 02:06:57.460
And I don't know, Dustin really seems to like it and wants to continue it.

02:06:57.460 --> 02:07:00.060
I'm like, that's pretty pricey, but it's fun.

02:07:00.060 --> 02:07:06.420
There's an app, you unlock special rewards, you unlock new units to use, which is really

02:07:06.420 --> 02:07:11.420
unlocking new workouts, which is terrible when you think of it that way.

02:07:11.420 --> 02:07:17.100
But yeah, I did, I'm opening up my app right now, if it would load quicker.

02:07:17.100 --> 02:07:20.540
Let me get some comments in chat while you get that ready.

02:07:20.540 --> 02:07:23.220
You can take this home or do you do it at the gym?

02:07:23.220 --> 02:07:28.140
You do it at a specialized location, but there's an app that you can track all your stats,

02:07:28.140 --> 02:07:32.860
you set up your next appointment, you buy things with coins that you earn from playing.

02:07:32.860 --> 02:07:36.020
I would just want something I could do at home.

02:07:36.020 --> 02:07:40.620
Fifth Dream in chat had the exact same comment that Loki had, Oh man, I hope they wiped those

02:07:40.620 --> 02:07:43.340
goggles down really well between customers.

02:07:43.340 --> 02:07:46.380
Yeah, I'm pretty sure they do.

02:07:46.380 --> 02:07:49.540
Thour66 says, I think this is coming in the Montreal area.

02:07:49.540 --> 02:07:54.460
I read about it in the paper, but to be fair, this isn't the only type of VR gym thing that's

02:07:54.460 --> 02:07:55.460
out there.

02:07:55.460 --> 02:07:58.420
So it may be this, but it may be like a competing brand, right?

02:07:58.420 --> 02:08:00.420
Yeah, probably.

02:08:00.420 --> 02:08:06.940
So I pulled up my stats and just for today, for example, it tells me how many punches

02:08:06.940 --> 02:08:09.380
I did, how many reps I did sets.

02:08:10.300 --> 02:08:11.300
I don't know what volume is.

02:08:11.300 --> 02:08:15.700
I should have asked, but whatever it is, I did 12,000 pounds of it.

02:08:15.700 --> 02:08:20.580
And it also shows you your areas that you worked out the most per your session.

02:08:20.580 --> 02:08:25.780
So like today I basically did just my back and then a little bit of my arms and my knees

02:08:25.780 --> 02:08:27.420
were killing me from last time.

02:08:27.420 --> 02:08:28.420
So I did no squats.

02:08:28.420 --> 02:08:32.580
So I have zero in like that area on the graph here.

02:08:32.580 --> 02:08:33.580
Yeah.

02:08:33.580 --> 02:08:34.580
Yeah.

02:08:34.580 --> 02:08:38.700
I'm not surprised that you're getting a heck of a workout when you're doing this though.

02:08:38.700 --> 02:08:42.460
I mean, like watching all like the resistance, like those things in your arms, because even

02:08:42.460 --> 02:08:46.360
just playing Beat Saber on my PlayStation VR, like I get tired.

02:08:46.360 --> 02:08:50.980
My watch recognizes that as workout time when I'm playing it because my heart rate goes

02:08:50.980 --> 02:08:52.940
so far up when I'm playing it.

02:08:52.940 --> 02:08:56.660
So I mean, just like the VR gaming in general, I suppose it depends what you're playing.

02:08:56.660 --> 02:08:59.940
Like if I'm just kind of chill in a no man's sky or Skyrim, I'm probably not.

02:08:59.940 --> 02:09:04.020
I mean, I'm probably burning more calories than I am playing on a monitor.

02:09:04.020 --> 02:09:07.620
But like even just like a music game like Beat Saber or that, that one game that feels

02:09:07.620 --> 02:09:10.360
like you're rollerblading or whatever, like gets a lot of motion.

02:09:10.360 --> 02:09:15.340
So it's like, I feel like a VR gym set up thing, which is very kind of like a modern

02:09:15.340 --> 02:09:16.340
thing.

02:09:16.340 --> 02:09:18.420
I mean, that just really like amps it up even further, you know?

02:09:18.420 --> 02:09:21.660
Are those things weighted?

02:09:21.660 --> 02:09:24.880
They do have some weight to them, but they are not actual.

02:09:24.880 --> 02:09:29.140
Like they don't adjust in heaviness or weight or whatever.

02:09:29.140 --> 02:09:30.780
They're just there for tracking.

02:09:30.780 --> 02:09:35.180
I would want something that would hook up to a weight machine of some sort, because

02:09:35.180 --> 02:09:37.740
I don't like straight up cardio.

02:09:37.740 --> 02:09:40.620
Well, no, that's the thing.

02:09:40.620 --> 02:09:45.100
So when Dustin plays, he's more focused on his workout.

02:09:45.100 --> 02:09:49.340
So he's doing like the actual way to, you know, work out and doing everything right.

02:09:49.340 --> 02:09:56.020
I just wanted to win, which is bad because so I was doing everything as fast.

02:09:56.020 --> 02:09:58.940
Maybe I was doing everything as fast as I possibly could.

02:09:58.940 --> 02:10:00.140
But in doing that.

02:10:00.140 --> 02:10:01.140
Yeah.

02:10:01.140 --> 02:10:03.520
OK, so I started out CrossFit, started out.

02:10:03.520 --> 02:10:09.080
But the software and the equipment, when you're going really fast, when you say I'm doing

02:10:09.080 --> 02:10:11.780
like really fast chest presses.

02:10:11.780 --> 02:10:18.920
So the next time I grab the chest press orb and put it in the virtual slot to start it,

02:10:18.920 --> 02:10:23.620
it actually ups the resistance to make it harder for me, because it saw me just like

02:10:23.620 --> 02:10:27.000
blaze through these lighter reps of it.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:32.400
And so you actually get more weight the faster you go.

02:10:32.400 --> 02:10:38.380
But there is, as we learned later, a little virtual button you can press to kind of tailor

02:10:38.380 --> 02:10:39.380
how you want to do it.

02:10:39.380 --> 02:10:44.740
So if you want to do lighter weight, but faster reps, you can hit that button and then start.

02:10:44.740 --> 02:10:50.940
Or if you want to go really hard with heavy weight and fewer reps, you can hit that button

02:10:50.940 --> 02:10:51.940
too.

02:10:51.940 --> 02:10:53.160
How does it add resistance, though?

02:10:53.160 --> 02:10:55.040
Is it hooked up to something else?

02:10:55.040 --> 02:10:56.040
Yes.

02:10:56.040 --> 02:10:59.720
So if you saw if the video was up, I don't know if it is.

02:10:59.720 --> 02:11:03.080
I just saw the two people fake punching.

02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:04.080
Okay.

02:11:04.080 --> 02:11:14.160
So there is two hand straps that depending on your attack slash workout you're doing,

02:11:14.160 --> 02:11:16.160
it actually raises and lowers.

02:11:16.160 --> 02:11:22.820
So there's some sort of mechanics in that machine that communicate through the software

02:11:22.820 --> 02:11:28.680
to add the weight for you, because it has to adjust the height of the handles.

02:11:28.680 --> 02:11:29.680
Oh, I see.

02:11:29.680 --> 02:11:32.840
It kicks out the back thing too, or the chest thing if you're facing it.

02:11:32.840 --> 02:11:34.360
It's like a cable machine.

02:11:34.360 --> 02:11:35.360
Yeah.

02:11:35.360 --> 02:11:36.360
That's exactly what it is.

02:11:36.360 --> 02:11:40.600
It's like the standing cable machine, but it looks like it adjusts it based on the difference.

02:11:40.600 --> 02:11:41.600
Yeah.

02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:43.000
I've used the cable machines at the gym a lot.

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:44.000
I mean, I totally do that.

02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:45.000
Yeah.

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:46.000
So to advise.

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:47.000
Not for that kind of money.

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:48.000
Yeah.

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:49.060
Well, do the 30-day free thing.

02:11:49.060 --> 02:11:52.200
And like I said, they're adjusting their prices, it seems, since they've been open.

02:11:52.200 --> 02:11:53.200
It started higher.

02:11:53.200 --> 02:11:54.200
It's going lower.

02:11:54.200 --> 02:11:59.900
I assume it'll probably still go lower, because it wasn't really popular when we were there.

02:11:59.900 --> 02:12:03.960
We were the only two people there out of the eight boxes they had.

02:12:03.960 --> 02:12:06.880
So it's also a Sunday morning.

02:12:06.880 --> 02:12:12.140
Questbuster in chat shares, the high pricing doesn't seem that unusual for VR-type attractions

02:12:12.140 --> 02:12:13.200
from what I'm seeing.

02:12:13.200 --> 02:12:17.800
The void charge, 30 per visit for adventure-oriented experiences.

02:12:17.800 --> 02:12:18.800
You know what, though?

02:12:18.800 --> 02:12:21.760
I think this is one of those things where it's just the technology is kind of expensive,

02:12:21.760 --> 02:12:22.760
and it's new.

02:12:23.320 --> 02:12:25.120
The industry's trying to figure itself out.

02:12:25.120 --> 02:12:30.520
But I honestly think in 10 years, which sounds like a long time, but it's not, but in 10

02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:35.440
years' time, this is the type of technology that will probably be in many more gyms.

02:12:35.440 --> 02:12:37.320
It's not going to be a specialty gym.

02:12:37.320 --> 02:12:41.320
It's going to be the type of thing you see at an established chain, like 24-hour fitness

02:12:41.320 --> 02:12:44.240
or LA Fitness or whatever it is you have near you.

02:12:44.240 --> 02:12:47.780
You're going to start to see this type of stuff like you would see a racquetball court

02:12:47.780 --> 02:12:48.780
or something.

02:12:48.780 --> 02:12:53.580
I think as the technology progresses, I think it'll probably be more accessible like that.

02:12:53.580 --> 02:12:59.500
As long as it's still a game style, because even the worker today told us, yeah, there's

02:12:59.500 --> 02:13:00.500
leagues.

02:13:00.500 --> 02:13:04.580
Once you do your first two, which we've done now, once you do your third, you are actually

02:13:04.580 --> 02:13:06.460
ranking up and ranking down.

02:13:06.460 --> 02:13:09.420
And say you hate squats like I do.

02:13:09.420 --> 02:13:18.040
Well, there is a person that you have to fight in the game who is weak to all the leg workouts.

02:13:18.040 --> 02:13:20.680
So that's going to be fun.

02:13:20.680 --> 02:13:21.680
Huh.

02:13:21.680 --> 02:13:26.160
This sounds kind of up your alley too, Loki, because you could do laser tag basically.

02:13:26.160 --> 02:13:27.160
You're kind of workout.

02:13:27.160 --> 02:13:30.960
I mean, it's not VR, but it's still like you're doing an intense workout.

02:13:30.960 --> 02:13:35.160
I do dream of a day when they, well, actually I take that back.

02:13:35.160 --> 02:13:41.960
They do have, I think, I haven't played it in the Disneyland, downtown Disney area or

02:13:41.960 --> 02:13:42.960
whatever.

02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:46.960
They do have a VR place that is sort of like laser tag, but it's like PVE stuff.

02:13:46.960 --> 02:13:49.600
You're just like doing co-op with a team, but you're actually walking through like a

02:13:49.600 --> 02:13:52.240
maze and fighting like stormtroopers and shit.

02:13:52.240 --> 02:13:59.360
But I do dream of a day like AR laser tag where this is our holodeck.

02:13:59.360 --> 02:14:00.360
But I'll be perfectly honest.

02:14:00.360 --> 02:14:05.400
I mean, I would want something like this that I could do at home and stop it, you know,

02:14:05.400 --> 02:14:09.560
but I just keep thinking that it would end up being really overwhelming for me with my

02:14:09.560 --> 02:14:10.720
sensory issues.

02:14:10.720 --> 02:14:15.080
You know, it's clearly not meant for autistic people.

02:14:15.080 --> 02:14:19.680
If it's as flashy as what they were showing the video content to look like.

02:14:19.680 --> 02:14:20.680
It's not.

02:14:20.680 --> 02:14:22.120
I mean, that's an attraction video.

02:14:22.120 --> 02:14:23.120
Yeah.

02:14:23.120 --> 02:14:24.120
So it's not that flashy.

02:14:24.120 --> 02:14:29.360
But virtual environments can be overstimulating anyway for an autistic person because it's

02:14:29.360 --> 02:14:31.400
not just the visual input.

02:14:31.400 --> 02:14:34.560
You're also dealing with the electric input, the heat, the pressure.

02:14:34.560 --> 02:14:36.240
You've got a lot more than that you're dealing with.

02:14:36.240 --> 02:14:40.160
And I would want something that I could like pause.

02:14:40.160 --> 02:14:45.920
They do have an emergency stop, but yeah, it's, um, each session is 30 minutes and it

02:14:45.920 --> 02:14:49.940
actually like, you know, I thought so too.

02:14:49.940 --> 02:14:54.320
And I like you said with you, with those sorts of issues, it might actually be too long because

02:14:54.320 --> 02:14:56.080
of all the stuff that's going on.

02:14:56.080 --> 02:15:01.080
But for me, I was like in the middle of my third battle and I won because I was ahead

02:15:01.080 --> 02:15:02.480
and I was like, wait, I didn't finish.

02:15:02.480 --> 02:15:03.900
I want to keep going.

02:15:03.900 --> 02:15:08.480
This is terrible for people that want to win at stuff terrible.

02:15:08.480 --> 02:15:12.320
And to Jamie's point, this is all still like, and again, you say this only exists in two

02:15:12.320 --> 02:15:13.320
different places.

02:15:13.320 --> 02:15:17.000
This whole, this whole thing is kind of like uncharted territory.

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:19.860
Like we kind of look at it as gamers going like, okay, wow, cool.

02:15:19.860 --> 02:15:22.880
This is like a workout thing to the next level, but there's still a lot to figure out.

02:15:22.880 --> 02:15:25.660
I mean, we're trying to figure out what's the right price.

02:15:25.660 --> 02:15:28.840
And then I think another question that's going to be asked with this is how do we make it

02:15:28.840 --> 02:15:32.880
accessible to more people is going to be, you know, another question which would include,

02:15:32.880 --> 02:15:35.760
you know, include these sorts of questions that you're raising.

02:15:35.760 --> 02:15:42.640
What I want is sensory deprivation, weightlifting, because when I, um, when I lift, when I was

02:15:42.640 --> 02:15:46.480
lifting heavy, you know, now that I've got the okay to go back and do it, I'm going to,

02:15:46.480 --> 02:15:52.680
but I would, uh, close my eyes or wear a sweat band over my eyes so that I could focus on

02:15:52.680 --> 02:15:58.440
how my body felt and not have any click clank over in the side or any bright lights or loud

02:15:58.440 --> 02:16:01.480
music, um, interrupting my own progress.

02:16:01.480 --> 02:16:04.240
Have you ever done one of those like water tank things?

02:16:04.240 --> 02:16:08.280
I desperately want to, um, curious, I say sensory deprivation.

02:16:08.280 --> 02:16:09.640
That's where my mind goes.

02:16:09.640 --> 02:16:12.860
I really want to do a sensory deprivation tank because it's supposed to be the most

02:16:12.860 --> 02:16:14.120
relaxing thing ever.

02:16:14.120 --> 02:16:17.680
Um, but I mean, I kind of, I re I liked the concept.

02:16:17.680 --> 02:16:22.640
I really liked the concept and me having a little bit of, you know, a background in having

02:16:22.640 --> 02:16:26.760
done heavy weightlifting, it sounds really interesting and very motivating to a lot of

02:16:26.760 --> 02:16:27.760
people.

02:16:27.760 --> 02:16:31.340
I just don't know if, you know, it would be the right thing for me.

02:16:31.340 --> 02:16:35.700
And on top of that, I would really be worried about people, Shane, no shade on you, but

02:16:35.700 --> 02:16:39.960
I would be really afraid for people who are not paying attention to their form and are

02:16:39.960 --> 02:16:44.420
not doing the exercises correctly because that is how you injure yourself.

02:16:44.420 --> 02:16:45.660
Crossfit.

02:16:45.660 --> 02:16:46.660
Definitely true.

02:16:46.660 --> 02:16:47.660
Definitely true.

02:16:47.660 --> 02:16:52.840
Crossfit has a big problem going on with that and I, you know, people will preach Crossfit

02:16:52.840 --> 02:16:55.940
like they preach veganism, you know, it's their religion.

02:16:55.940 --> 02:16:58.980
Guess who's husband has recently gotten into that bandwagon.

02:16:58.980 --> 02:17:03.980
At any rate though, the Crossfit also is fairly dangerous if you're not paying attention to

02:17:03.980 --> 02:17:08.060
your form and a lot of people will try to push their reps over and over, over paying

02:17:08.060 --> 02:17:12.120
attention to, are they doing these exercises correctly?

02:17:12.120 --> 02:17:17.060
You know, I know someone who had to take a break out of Crossfit because of torn ligaments

02:17:17.060 --> 02:17:22.040
in her shoulder, you know, people injuring themselves because they're not paying attention

02:17:22.040 --> 02:17:25.460
to form because all they want to do is hit those numbers, hit those numbers.

02:17:25.460 --> 02:17:28.500
And that's a big problem I foresee with this service.

02:17:28.500 --> 02:17:36.700
Well, what I will say, just to talk about that for a second, I think what you're saying

02:17:36.700 --> 02:17:41.620
is a hundred percent true and the best I think that they can do is kind of the stuff they

02:17:41.620 --> 02:17:43.300
have already implemented.

02:17:43.300 --> 02:17:48.460
Every time you pick a workout, it's showing you a video as it's loading up and if you

02:17:48.460 --> 02:17:53.280
try to cheat and really just, you know, go at it without paying attention to your form

02:17:53.280 --> 02:17:58.000
at all, it doesn't know exactly that you're cheating, but if it feels like you're not

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:03.000
doing it right, because I may have done some of that today, it will say, you've got to,

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:08.120
you've got to stop in and check your form and it won't actually let you attack or account

02:18:08.120 --> 02:18:15.040
for anything you're doing until you get back into what it believes is the correct form.

02:18:15.040 --> 02:18:17.880
So they try at least.

02:18:17.880 --> 02:18:22.240
And it's still probably uncharted territory in many ways, like, you know.

02:18:22.240 --> 02:18:26.320
Now I would assume it would have like a profile for you, of course, but doesn't save anything

02:18:26.320 --> 02:18:33.960
like body dimension, like your weight, your height, your hip to foot ratio, things like

02:18:33.960 --> 02:18:39.000
that, so that it can accommodate for maybe having, like for me, I got short stubby little

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:40.620
hobbit legs.

02:18:40.620 --> 02:18:45.660
My squat's going to go a lot lower than the average person, you know, but I have a bit

02:18:45.660 --> 02:18:47.140
taller of an upper body.

02:18:47.140 --> 02:18:51.440
So if I'm going to do say, hold on, I'm trying to do this on the camera, like, you know,

02:18:51.480 --> 02:18:56.600
a shoulder press, my shoulder press is going to go a little bit taller than it might be expected

02:18:56.600 --> 02:19:02.160
of my height. So, you know, the only thing really, I want to kind of deep dive on this one

02:19:02.160 --> 02:19:05.160
now. I'm going to do a lot of research on it because it's very fascinating to me.

02:19:05.520 --> 02:19:06.960
So, so two things to that.

02:19:07.240 --> 02:19:10.640
One, they only ask for your height and weight when you sign up.

02:19:10.800 --> 02:19:16.200
And when you go in there, it has you center your head so it can like accurately gauge if

02:19:16.200 --> 02:19:18.080
you're right about how tall you are for these.

02:19:18.080 --> 02:19:23.080
So I'm guessing it's, it's assuming that you are of average proportions, so to speak.

02:19:23.320 --> 02:19:28.640
But the thing is, since it's still really new, every time you're done with it,

02:19:28.920 --> 02:19:32.160
the app asks you for feedback for that stuff.

02:19:32.360 --> 02:19:40.240
And the employees there have both times so far, like asked for feedback as to what's

02:19:40.240 --> 02:19:43.560
working, what can be improved, stuff like that.

02:19:43.560 --> 02:19:51.600
So I think for someone like you who wants it to go even further and it should go further,

02:19:52.280 --> 02:19:58.160
maybe, maybe trying out that 30-day trial and just going down there once to tell them,

02:19:58.160 --> 02:20:00.880
hey, this is what I noticed that you should be doing.

02:20:01.040 --> 02:20:02.920
It's a good drive going to San Francisco.

02:20:02.920 --> 02:20:07.280
Yeah, well, yeah. I mean, if you were going there for whatever reason already, like if

02:20:07.280 --> 02:20:09.280
you're just taking like a weekend trip or something.

02:20:09.440 --> 02:20:15.280
I will say I'm all for this gamification of exercising, and I'm sure this is just like,

02:20:15.280 --> 02:20:20.960
you know, the next step, because I would say, you know, it's this or it's Wii Fit or it's,

02:20:20.960 --> 02:20:24.360
you know, now we've got the Resistance band, right?

02:20:24.360 --> 02:20:28.560
The Nintendo, what did I, what was the nasty name I gave it the other week on the show?

02:20:28.560 --> 02:20:29.760
The Nintendo Strap-On.

02:20:29.760 --> 02:20:33.680
The Nintendo Strap-On thing for your leg, because you strap it on your legs.

02:20:33.680 --> 02:20:34.480
It's the Nintendo Strap-On.

02:20:34.480 --> 02:20:35.480
Yes, OK.

02:20:36.360 --> 02:20:42.280
So there's that or, you know, I'm really excited right now because we're starting a walking

02:20:42.280 --> 02:20:47.280
challenge at work tomorrow, and I'm going to get all those steps in and be my co-workers.

02:20:48.560 --> 02:20:51.360
So, you know, gamification, it goes a long way.

02:20:51.360 --> 02:20:53.680
And we're starting the mindfulness challenge at work.

02:20:53.680 --> 02:20:58.880
So is that, oh, is that the 10 minutes of the Breathe app and using a guided meditation?

02:20:59.120 --> 02:20:59.480
Fun.

02:20:59.960 --> 02:21:01.720
So kind of the reverse.

02:21:02.360 --> 02:21:05.920
But no, thank you for thank you definitely for bringing that up to us, because I think

02:21:05.920 --> 02:21:09.600
that it's an amazing concept.

02:21:09.600 --> 02:21:13.760
I kind of saw something like this eventually happening, and I'm glad that they did.

02:21:13.760 --> 02:21:15.720
It will definitely get more people into being active.

02:21:15.720 --> 02:21:19.080
And I feel like this one company probably isn't the only one like it's the one that

02:21:19.080 --> 02:21:20.960
Shane got to see and is reporting on.

02:21:20.960 --> 02:21:23.440
But I have a feeling there's others very similar.

02:21:23.440 --> 02:21:24.160
You know what?

02:21:24.160 --> 02:21:29.920
Another application for something I think could definitely be incorporated into hospital,

02:21:29.920 --> 02:21:32.920
hospice services, things like physical rehab.

02:21:33.600 --> 02:21:37.800
Imagine having something like that for people who are just like, oh, this is boring.

02:21:37.800 --> 02:21:38.760
This is boring. It's boring.

02:21:38.760 --> 02:21:43.560
But you give them a virtual environment in which to motivate themselves to participate

02:21:43.560 --> 02:21:48.560
in their physical therapy and then give them some sort of, you know, reward for actually.

02:21:48.560 --> 02:21:50.320
I mean, my dad would probably need that.

02:21:50.320 --> 02:21:52.240
He never wanted to do his physical therapy.

02:21:52.560 --> 02:21:56.040
But if he got a reward out of like say that he did all of this physical therapy and he

02:21:56.040 --> 02:22:00.080
got to get a snack out of the snack machine, my dad would be happy as a, you know,

02:22:02.280 --> 02:22:06.240
Mr. Smoosh with the feeder broken and just piling food everywhere.

02:22:06.520 --> 02:22:08.400
That's how happy my dad would be.

02:22:08.960 --> 02:22:09.320
Okay.

02:22:10.040 --> 02:22:13.480
Shane, before I let you go, I don't see any other callers waiting in the green room.

02:22:13.480 --> 02:22:17.080
Again, if you do want to be on orange on radio tonight, head on over to the green room on

02:22:17.080 --> 02:22:20.320
our discord server over at vognetwork.com slash discord.

02:22:20.520 --> 02:22:22.600
That's VOGnetwork.com slash discord.

02:22:22.800 --> 02:22:27.080
But before I let you go, Shane, any other gaming things going on you want to talk about

02:22:27.080 --> 02:22:27.680
here on the show?

02:22:30.360 --> 02:22:36.760
I accidentally started WoW again because I was on Ambien, I guess was really the best

02:22:36.760 --> 02:22:37.640
explanation.

02:22:39.400 --> 02:22:43.960
And I'm naming my character after the good place, which is great.

02:22:44.320 --> 02:22:51.160
And I have a huge backlog of games and I just keep playing the goose game instead.

02:22:51.320 --> 02:22:52.120
I don't even care.

02:22:52.280 --> 02:22:52.880
Oh, yeah.

02:22:52.920 --> 02:22:54.120
Quickly on the goose game.

02:22:54.120 --> 02:22:55.760
Cause you said this is like the best video game.

02:22:55.760 --> 02:22:56.040
Oh, no way.

02:22:56.040 --> 02:22:57.680
You talked about this last week already, didn't you?

02:22:57.960 --> 02:22:59.240
Yeah, I did.

02:22:59.800 --> 02:23:00.760
Congratulations.

02:23:00.760 --> 02:23:04.280
I finally broke my ban on Epic and got it.

02:23:04.600 --> 02:23:06.320
It's going to be worth it.

02:23:06.440 --> 02:23:08.160
So I can play it on my Mac.

02:23:09.280 --> 02:23:10.880
It's just the funniest game.

02:23:10.880 --> 02:23:14.040
I'm going to be at work on lunch playing the freaking goose game.

02:23:14.360 --> 02:23:14.960
You're coworkers.

02:23:14.960 --> 02:23:17.120
Just make sure to wear headphones.

02:23:17.200 --> 02:23:20.160
I'm not the only one who plays games at lunch though at work.

02:23:20.200 --> 02:23:22.080
Yeah, you used to get a coworker that did Diablo three.

02:23:22.200 --> 02:23:23.560
Yeah, a couple of do Diablo.

02:23:23.560 --> 02:23:26.080
Some people who've done cause Borderlands plays on Mac.

02:23:26.160 --> 02:23:27.000
Oh yeah.

02:23:27.040 --> 02:23:28.240
So, all right, cool.

02:23:29.040 --> 02:23:29.480
All right.

02:23:29.600 --> 02:23:30.400
Well, Shane, take care.

02:23:30.400 --> 02:23:30.960
I'm going to let you go.

02:23:30.960 --> 02:23:31.280
Okay.

02:23:32.120 --> 02:23:32.360
Okay.

02:23:32.360 --> 02:23:34.360
And everybody watched the Pokemon stream on Friday.

02:23:34.360 --> 02:23:35.400
It's 24 hours.

02:23:35.400 --> 02:23:36.480
Who knows what it's going to be?

02:23:37.120 --> 02:23:37.920
It's a mystery.

02:23:37.960 --> 02:23:38.160
All right.

02:23:38.160 --> 02:23:38.480
Bye.

02:23:38.720 --> 02:23:38.920
Yep.

02:23:38.920 --> 02:23:39.200
Bye.

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:40.320
All right.

02:23:40.320 --> 02:23:41.520
Oh, this'll be fun.

02:23:41.800 --> 02:23:42.600
Oh gosh.

02:23:42.600 --> 02:23:45.320
If this is who the label says it is, this is going to be so much fun.

02:23:45.560 --> 02:23:46.880
Uh, let's go to the phones.

02:23:47.040 --> 02:23:47.360
Hi.

02:23:47.360 --> 02:23:48.280
You're on orange on radio.

02:23:48.280 --> 02:23:48.840
Who's this?

02:23:49.800 --> 02:23:51.040
This is Jim Sally motherfucker.

02:23:51.040 --> 02:23:52.240
I'm back from the past.

02:23:52.560 --> 02:23:55.160
Jim Sally is back, bitch.

02:23:55.160 --> 02:23:56.280
I thought you were dead.

02:23:57.520 --> 02:23:58.840
I was for a little while.

02:23:59.440 --> 02:23:59.720
Wow.

02:23:59.720 --> 02:24:00.640
Ooh, and the quality.

02:24:00.640 --> 02:24:05.880
See, a lot of people give a shit for ditching Skype, but the quality, like Jim

02:24:05.880 --> 02:24:07.560
Sally's coming through an HD now.

02:24:07.560 --> 02:24:08.040
I love it.

02:24:09.360 --> 02:24:09.960
Listen, brother.

02:24:09.960 --> 02:24:13.240
It was so much easier before when I could use the fucking regular telephone.

02:24:13.600 --> 02:24:14.520
I know.

02:24:14.920 --> 02:24:15.280
I know.

02:24:15.280 --> 02:24:16.400
Thanks for complicated now.

02:24:17.400 --> 02:24:18.760
And I'm fucking dude.

02:24:18.800 --> 02:24:22.800
I'm a little bit baked and I had to think of asking me if I was a robot.

02:24:22.800 --> 02:24:24.480
And I'm like, dude, I'm not a robot.

02:24:24.520 --> 02:24:25.960
And it was like, look at this picture.

02:24:25.960 --> 02:24:27.600
And where's the traffic lights?

02:24:27.600 --> 02:24:28.760
And I'm like, I don't know, man.

02:24:29.040 --> 02:24:30.560
But look, you can see us.

02:24:31.040 --> 02:24:31.600
We're a video.

02:24:31.600 --> 02:24:33.280
What do you think of OLRB video now?

02:24:34.600 --> 02:24:35.600
Dude, it was pretty crazy, man.

02:24:35.600 --> 02:24:38.840
When I was watching fucking Bobby Black Wolf before, man, Jesus Christ, Bobby

02:24:38.840 --> 02:24:40.280
Black Wolf looks a little bit Wolfie.

02:24:40.520 --> 02:24:41.440
You forget sometimes.

02:24:42.200 --> 02:24:43.080
You forget sometimes.

02:24:43.080 --> 02:24:44.280
That's a compliment though.

02:24:44.440 --> 02:24:45.880
Bobby Black Wolf's a good looking man.

02:24:46.720 --> 02:24:47.720
He has a good looking man.

02:24:47.720 --> 02:24:50.600
And when I hear his voice, I picture like a smooth Debonair, like, you know,

02:24:50.600 --> 02:24:53.760
little short hobbit, he sort of, but still smooth and Debonair techie boy.

02:24:54.040 --> 02:24:55.240
And then you see him now.

02:24:55.560 --> 02:24:59.360
Shit, son, put that man in a moped and I'm stepping back.

02:24:59.720 --> 02:25:00.560
That's all I'm saying.

02:25:01.240 --> 02:25:02.200
That's all I'm saying.

02:25:02.800 --> 02:25:04.760
Well, what, what the hell have you been up to?

02:25:05.040 --> 02:25:07.800
What's been new over the past two years, however long it's been.

02:25:08.080 --> 02:25:08.840
Jeez, man.

02:25:08.840 --> 02:25:09.560
A couple of years.

02:25:09.560 --> 02:25:12.960
Uh, I was, I was working at a marijuana farm for a while.

02:25:12.960 --> 02:25:16.080
Getting that all set up for a couple of years, but it was about an hour away from

02:25:16.080 --> 02:25:20.480
my house, so it was taking up a lot of my time, Sunday nights, I was always there.

02:25:20.800 --> 02:25:23.800
There's no wifi service, no OLR, man.

02:25:24.040 --> 02:25:27.960
And it's not the same listening to it as a podcast when it's not live.

02:25:28.440 --> 02:25:29.120
I don't know why.

02:25:29.760 --> 02:25:30.840
It doesn't seem as fresh.

02:25:31.080 --> 02:25:36.000
It's um, you know, I, I, yeah, the podcast and I've, you know, cause I, I listen,

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.720
yes, I listen to myself sometimes just because I'm my own worst critic.

02:25:38.720 --> 02:25:41.920
And I often come up with the ideas on how to do better things when I listen to this

02:25:41.960 --> 02:25:42.920
when I listen to this show.

02:25:43.080 --> 02:25:45.920
I think part of the fun is that you do kind of feel like you could influence

02:25:45.920 --> 02:25:48.320
things through the chat room and stuff like that, where it's like, when you're

02:25:48.320 --> 02:25:51.040
listening on the podcast, you can't really change anything.

02:25:51.080 --> 02:25:53.200
You know, you can't influence the show on the fly.

02:25:53.440 --> 02:25:57.760
We have had complete fucking utter derailments of this entire fucking show

02:25:57.760 --> 02:26:01.200
that have happened because of a chat comment, you know, and when you're on the

02:26:01.200 --> 02:26:05.600
podcast, although, sure, we, we still, we invite the tweets, we invite the emails.

02:26:05.840 --> 02:26:10.000
It's not, I fully admit it's not quite the same when it isn't playing out live.

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:10.360
You know?

02:26:13.240 --> 02:26:13.800
Yeah, man.

02:26:13.800 --> 02:26:15.920
I know that I got my weekends back to myself.

02:26:15.920 --> 02:26:19.440
I want to spend a little more time listening and calling in, man.

02:26:19.760 --> 02:26:20.240
Well, good.

02:26:20.240 --> 02:26:21.200
It's so good to hear from you.

02:26:21.440 --> 02:26:21.920
I'm good.

02:26:22.280 --> 02:26:24.360
Dude, I'm getting the game life back on.

02:26:24.720 --> 02:26:25.160
Yeah.

02:26:25.200 --> 02:26:27.840
So I was able to get my gaming life back together and I bought

02:26:27.840 --> 02:26:29.920
this thing called a PS4.

02:26:30.080 --> 02:26:31.520
Have you ever heard of this thing?

02:26:31.800 --> 02:26:35.640
It went up from a three to a four, apparently, while I was away.

02:26:36.160 --> 02:26:38.560
How far north in Canada are you?

02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:40.640
It's too far.

02:26:40.640 --> 02:26:41.400
You forget, man.

02:26:41.400 --> 02:26:44.840
It's far, man, but it's fucking far.

02:26:46.360 --> 02:26:48.880
I'm still living on the same goat farm that I lived on before.

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:50.200
No.

02:26:50.200 --> 02:26:53.360
So the way in her majesty's Bush, we're not so the way in her majesty's Bush.

02:26:53.360 --> 02:26:58.080
Cause I like to tell people, you live out the goat's real fat, but a girl's

02:26:58.080 --> 02:27:00.200
go fat munching on her majesty's Bush.

02:27:00.480 --> 02:27:01.840
Bitch don't pay no rent though.

02:27:02.520 --> 02:27:06.680
That much put, put her face on the 20 and pay me.

02:27:07.680 --> 02:27:12.920
While you've been working out in the Bush at the grass farm, what have you

02:27:12.920 --> 02:27:14.920
been playing on the PlayStation four?

02:27:15.480 --> 02:27:18.440
Well, I went out and I got, I got the fallout.

02:27:18.520 --> 02:27:20.880
I got the fallout four, which is unbelievable.

02:27:20.880 --> 02:27:22.320
I can't believe how amazing it is.

02:27:22.320 --> 02:27:24.640
I just lose myself in the inside that world.

02:27:24.680 --> 02:27:25.320
It's crazy.

02:27:25.400 --> 02:27:28.280
The evil things that you can do to people with police around.

02:27:28.280 --> 02:27:29.840
It's it's just spectacular.

02:27:30.160 --> 02:27:35.240
But then I tried to play the fallout 76 and fuck, man, people are evil, man.

02:27:35.320 --> 02:27:36.560
I can't play folks.

02:27:36.600 --> 02:27:40.680
They should go follow 76 and follow fucking shoot Jim Sally in the face.

02:27:40.920 --> 02:27:43.800
Cause every time I grow up with somebody, I think it's going to be a nice, Hey,

02:27:43.800 --> 02:27:46.840
I'm going to use my, I did, I stumble around and I try to get the fucking

02:27:46.840 --> 02:27:48.280
handshake emoji on and shut off.

02:27:48.280 --> 02:27:51.600
The motherfucker will shoot my hand off and then kill me and steal my shit.

02:27:51.800 --> 02:27:52.960
Like, wow, this is a great game.

02:27:53.400 --> 02:27:54.160
This is a great game.

02:27:54.160 --> 02:27:56.080
I get to be an NBC from followed for it.

02:27:56.360 --> 02:28:00.120
Isn't that the worst when you try to go and do like the handshake emo and then

02:28:00.120 --> 02:28:02.600
you accidentally do the one that's the middle finger instead.

02:28:02.600 --> 02:28:07.320
Uh, and I don't want to be like cruel because you know, I know it's kind of

02:28:07.320 --> 02:28:12.160
profiling and shit because I'm sure most people playing that game are a dick, but

02:28:12.160 --> 02:28:13.560
there should be some sort of like mode.

02:28:13.560 --> 02:28:15.720
I have where people know it's Jim Sally and not a dick.

02:28:15.760 --> 02:28:16.680
Like you should be cool.

02:28:16.680 --> 02:28:20.760
And I roll up on, have you thought about changing your PlayStation

02:28:20.760 --> 02:28:22.280
four name to Jim Sally?

02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:22.880
Not a dick.

02:28:23.960 --> 02:28:26.960
I tried that, but then I got this thing that said it was bad.

02:28:26.960 --> 02:28:28.360
Cause you can't have a dick in your name.

02:28:28.360 --> 02:28:29.440
So I tried cock.

02:28:30.040 --> 02:28:30.960
I tried pennant.

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:31.960
I tried penis.

02:28:32.120 --> 02:28:32.560
That didn't work.

02:28:32.560 --> 02:28:33.640
I tried 10, 15.

02:28:33.840 --> 02:28:37.600
I tried to do about it, man.

02:28:38.200 --> 02:28:38.840
Like shit.

02:28:39.160 --> 02:28:40.680
I'm fucking behind the times, man.

02:28:40.920 --> 02:28:41.800
I'm behind the times.

02:28:41.880 --> 02:28:44.200
I just learned like, I just learned about Twitch today.

02:28:45.400 --> 02:28:46.120
Well, welcome.

02:28:46.160 --> 02:28:48.040
It's a, it's a beautiful world here.

02:28:48.280 --> 02:28:49.960
Uh, this is unbelievable, man.

02:28:50.160 --> 02:28:53.640
Fifth dream today in chat says the PVP has calmed down a lot since the early days.

02:28:53.840 --> 02:28:55.120
Way less griefing.

02:28:55.120 --> 02:28:59.280
And we have multiple suggestions for a former, a chatter from back in the day.

02:28:59.280 --> 02:29:04.120
Pen 15 is another way you could do it, which is also a show on Hulu that

02:29:04.120 --> 02:29:05.920
extra for like made me watch.

02:29:05.960 --> 02:29:07.960
And it's pretty fucking funny anyway.

02:29:10.800 --> 02:29:15.360
Oh, so Jim Sally, is there anything on your PlayStation four wishlist?

02:29:15.760 --> 02:29:16.960
Like things you want to play?

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:18.960
Well, that's the thing, right?

02:29:18.960 --> 02:29:20.320
Cause I'm just getting back into it now.

02:29:20.320 --> 02:29:22.760
So I know that Christmas time is coming, which means all the old

02:29:22.760 --> 02:29:23.920
games are going to be for sale.

02:29:24.120 --> 02:29:27.640
I already bought the new grand tourismal Jesus Christ.

02:29:27.640 --> 02:29:29.360
I was melting away on the grand tourismal.

02:29:29.880 --> 02:29:30.960
I can't believe it.

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:31.680
You just fall.

02:29:31.960 --> 02:29:35.720
And then I thought for the longest time that I was the greatest racer of all time.

02:29:35.720 --> 02:29:36.360
I couldn't believe it.

02:29:36.360 --> 02:29:38.080
I was flying through the corners.

02:29:38.240 --> 02:29:39.200
Nothing could stop me.

02:29:39.240 --> 02:29:40.280
Everything was perfect.

02:29:40.600 --> 02:29:44.800
And then my friend came over and I played on his profile and I couldn't do it.

02:29:44.800 --> 02:29:45.760
And I said, what's going on?

02:29:46.320 --> 02:29:48.280
And he said, you got it on girlfriend mode.

02:29:48.840 --> 02:29:49.960
What the fuck are you talking about?

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:50.800
Girlfriend mode.

02:29:50.800 --> 02:29:55.400
And he explained to me, it was all like auto-breaking and no damage.

02:29:56.160 --> 02:30:03.960
You know what, that mode got some strong feedback for what, what it was being called.

02:30:03.960 --> 02:30:06.480
But, um, also, uh, there's no shame.

02:30:06.480 --> 02:30:09.480
I think in playing video games on an easy mode, especially if you just want to

02:30:09.480 --> 02:30:13.240
experience the narrative or the story, you know, um, but yeah, I mean, you're not

02:30:13.240 --> 02:30:16.320
going to maybe get trophies or be able to say, Oh, I got the best score.

02:30:16.480 --> 02:30:18.560
Cause you know, you're playing on an easier mode.

02:30:18.960 --> 02:30:22.080
Um, you did make me think of something though that we didn't have in tonight's

02:30:22.080 --> 02:30:24.880
show role, but as maybe like a little bit of a last minute story.

02:30:25.120 --> 02:30:28.640
Since you are, you know, a little newer on the PlayStation four bandwagon, you

02:30:28.640 --> 02:30:32.640
know, you're not the only one, uh, some of the games are coming down in price.

02:30:32.800 --> 02:30:34.880
In fact, just two days ago, Jim Sally.

02:30:34.880 --> 02:30:42.720
So recently this week, they have reduced the, the price because they have put some

02:30:42.720 --> 02:30:50.760
new games in the greatest hits package PlayStation, so new games, 20 bucks for

02:30:50.760 --> 02:30:56.000
these games, 20 American far cry four.

02:30:56.040 --> 02:31:01.760
Just so you know, we call that a queenie God of war, Gran Turismo sport, Rayman

02:31:01.760 --> 02:31:08.320
legends, the crew uncharted, the lost legacy and watchdogs are all down to 20

02:31:08.320 --> 02:31:08.720
bucks.

02:31:09.360 --> 02:31:11.800
Dude, I'm set the original watchdogs.

02:31:11.840 --> 02:31:13.320
Yeah, I guess the original for whatever.

02:31:13.640 --> 02:31:14.960
I think I bought that for 20 bucks.

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.600
Like a few years ago.

02:31:19.480 --> 02:31:22.280
Is it going to be the super additions though, where I get all the extra bonus

02:31:22.280 --> 02:31:22.640
shit?

02:31:23.520 --> 02:31:29.560
Um, sometimes like, I know, like I just saw at a target or one of those places,

02:31:29.560 --> 02:31:33.640
like the horizon zero Dawn, which, which is a game I've been meaning to try.

02:31:33.640 --> 02:31:36.120
It's another one of those like open world exploration games.

02:31:36.120 --> 02:31:41.840
It's got, if you like fall out of my piece of delicious 20 bucks and it was

02:31:41.840 --> 02:31:43.160
the worst game and the DLC.

02:31:43.200 --> 02:31:43.440
Yeah.

02:31:43.440 --> 02:31:43.800
Right.

02:31:45.960 --> 02:31:47.560
I love two games, man.

02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:48.640
I love it.

02:31:49.040 --> 02:31:51.200
I got a little boy.

02:31:51.200 --> 02:31:51.840
I got a little boy.

02:31:51.840 --> 02:31:52.520
It's four years old.

02:31:52.520 --> 02:31:52.960
Daniel.

02:31:52.960 --> 02:31:56.400
It's just like daddy, a little fucking little mini fucking captain America.

02:31:56.400 --> 02:31:57.080
Oh, I love him.

02:31:57.400 --> 02:32:00.440
And sometimes you get into the game bins and I used to always have a hard time

02:32:00.440 --> 02:32:03.240
looking in those fucking game bins and shit because there's a lot of games in

02:32:03.240 --> 02:32:06.040
the fucking game bins because you know, what's great at finding games in the

02:32:06.040 --> 02:32:08.440
game bins for your old Johnny, you fucking pick them up.

02:32:08.440 --> 02:32:10.480
You put them right in the middle and he fucking digs in there.

02:32:10.480 --> 02:32:12.800
Like it's a fucking ball pit comes up.

02:32:13.720 --> 02:32:14.360
What'd you got there?

02:32:14.360 --> 02:32:14.880
Motherfucker.

02:32:15.080 --> 02:32:22.200
I got the motherfucker follow with Daniel and Tony.

02:32:22.480 --> 02:32:25.880
I put the sticker from the cheap game on it and see if we can get the cheap.

02:32:26.080 --> 02:32:26.960
I said, God damn it.

02:32:26.960 --> 02:32:28.040
That's a good boy.

02:32:28.480 --> 02:32:31.480
You put it, that's when you let them ride in the little basket of the cart.

02:32:31.880 --> 02:32:32.520
You know what I mean?

02:32:32.520 --> 02:32:34.880
Proud little ride, a little basket of the cart.

02:32:35.880 --> 02:32:37.320
Maybe push them across the parking lot.

02:32:37.320 --> 02:32:38.040
See what happens.

02:32:39.040 --> 02:32:39.840
Good job, son.

02:32:40.280 --> 02:32:41.880
God, I fucking missed your calls.

02:32:41.880 --> 02:32:44.680
Those are the kind of moments you can have together with your boy.

02:32:44.680 --> 02:32:48.440
Loki, do you let your children go Walmart dumpster diving in those?

02:32:48.480 --> 02:32:51.200
That's why they're just dumpsters where they put all the, I mean, they're not

02:32:51.200 --> 02:32:54.520
like actual dumpsters, but they just put all the cheap Blu-rays and all the games

02:32:54.520 --> 02:32:55.840
go in those big Walmart dumpsters.

02:32:55.840 --> 02:32:56.920
Do you let them go dumpster diving?

02:32:56.920 --> 02:32:58.440
Oh, they don't care about any of that stuff.

02:32:58.440 --> 02:32:58.800
They want it.

02:32:58.800 --> 02:33:02.040
They want to play the demo kiosk for the Nintendo switch for games that we already

02:33:02.040 --> 02:33:03.840
have at home that they just got done playing.

02:33:04.480 --> 02:33:06.680
You got a Pavlov dog, those motherfuckers, man.

02:33:06.680 --> 02:33:07.640
You take them to the Walmart.

02:33:07.640 --> 02:33:10.240
It's got the McDonald's built right in and you tell them you want a cone.

02:33:11.240 --> 02:33:18.000
I always look at the closeout stuff, but they always have like, it's like Titan

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:18.880
fall two or something.

02:33:18.880 --> 02:33:19.760
I'm like, I already own that.

02:33:19.760 --> 02:33:21.920
I don't, I don't need another copy of Titanfall two.

02:33:21.960 --> 02:33:25.760
If we gave our episodes titles, I would say this week would definitely be that a

02:33:25.760 --> 02:33:28.160
Pavlov dog, that dog, that motherfucker.

02:33:28.440 --> 02:33:30.520
You got a Pavlov dog, that motherfucker, man.

02:33:30.520 --> 02:33:31.600
Kids are dumb, man.

02:33:31.680 --> 02:33:33.680
How about that fucking shit, man?

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:35.280
Jim Sally, man.

02:33:35.600 --> 02:33:38.880
I have missed you so much on this program, but I do have to let you go so we can

02:33:38.880 --> 02:33:39.600
wrap things up.

02:33:39.920 --> 02:33:41.560
I hope to God we hear from you again, though.

02:33:42.600 --> 02:33:42.880
Dude.

02:33:42.880 --> 02:33:43.200
Yeah, man.

02:33:43.200 --> 02:33:45.440
I'm going to get my Twitch and my fucking discord game on Pat.

02:33:45.920 --> 02:33:46.960
Try to figure out some shit.

02:33:47.080 --> 02:33:49.840
I saw some fucking live streaming channels or some shit on you.

02:33:49.840 --> 02:33:50.480
Fucking shit.

02:33:50.480 --> 02:33:51.400
I should be checking out.

02:33:51.640 --> 02:33:53.320
You should get into live streaming.

02:33:53.440 --> 02:33:53.680
Now.

02:33:53.680 --> 02:33:57.120
I just said earlier in the show, don't get into live streaming to make money, but Jim

02:33:57.120 --> 02:34:00.080
Sally, you're like, you're going to be like Ninja two.

02:34:00.120 --> 02:34:00.800
I just know it.

02:34:02.680 --> 02:34:05.280
Well, I'm going to go karate chop the fuck out of the night, man.

02:34:05.600 --> 02:34:05.960
All right.

02:34:05.960 --> 02:34:07.160
Some good nights, brothers.

02:34:07.400 --> 02:34:07.720
All right.

02:34:07.720 --> 02:34:08.600
Take care, my friend.

02:34:09.280 --> 02:34:09.920
Later, boys.

02:34:13.680 --> 02:34:15.160
I love hearing from Jim Sally.

02:34:15.240 --> 02:34:16.040
That was the best.

02:34:16.200 --> 02:34:16.960
That made my night.

02:34:18.080 --> 02:34:21.160
We're not going to take any more calls because nothing else is going to top that.

02:34:21.160 --> 02:34:25.440
But if you want to send us an email, you sure can participate at orange

02:34:25.440 --> 02:34:28.800
lounge, radio.com, uh, make our soccer work next week.

02:34:28.840 --> 02:34:30.480
Y'all gave her the night off tonight.

02:34:30.480 --> 02:34:33.720
So, uh, make our soccer work and read your emails next week.

02:34:33.760 --> 02:34:34.200
Girl.

02:34:34.680 --> 02:34:37.240
So if we don't get emails next week, though, we need to think of something

02:34:37.240 --> 02:34:38.280
other than drag race talk.

02:34:39.280 --> 02:34:40.400
Um, karaoke.

02:34:40.400 --> 02:34:40.920
No, I'm kidding.

02:34:40.960 --> 02:34:42.640
I won't torture Loki anymore.

02:34:42.680 --> 02:34:43.920
Um, let's see.

02:34:43.920 --> 02:34:45.840
I would say food talk, but we did that anyway.

02:34:46.440 --> 02:34:48.200
Um, guess what my mom sent me?

02:34:48.560 --> 02:34:51.720
Oh, my mom sent me a Southern care package.

02:34:52.640 --> 02:34:58.840
They contained two bags of waffle house grits, two cans of boiled peanuts, and

02:34:58.840 --> 02:35:05.480
it's B O I L T P dash N U T S if you're from the South and some, uh, jambalaya

02:35:05.480 --> 02:35:10.320
mix and I am a happy little mud bug.

02:35:10.840 --> 02:35:11.080
All right.

02:35:11.080 --> 02:35:13.960
Well, we'll think of some site type of appropriate punishment during the week.

02:35:13.960 --> 02:35:16.280
Crawl dads, mud bugs, mud bugs.

02:35:16.440 --> 02:35:16.760
All right.

02:35:17.400 --> 02:35:17.800
All right.

02:35:17.960 --> 02:35:22.400
Well, we're going to wrap up the show so we can head on out and, uh, yeah.

02:35:22.440 --> 02:35:23.680
Uh, thank you though.

02:35:23.720 --> 02:35:24.840
Of course, as always for you.

02:35:24.840 --> 02:35:27.080
So actually, wait, I didn't check for any other last minute stories.

02:35:27.080 --> 02:35:28.840
I re I did one, but I don't know if you have any others.

02:35:28.840 --> 02:35:29.120
Loki.

02:35:29.160 --> 02:35:30.200
Um, I had a couple of things.

02:35:30.200 --> 02:35:35.680
So, uh, the first one is the composer, um, Bobby Prince, who wrote music for

02:35:35.680 --> 02:35:41.280
such games as doom, doom two Wolfenstein 3d, and most notably Duke Nukem 3d has

02:35:41.280 --> 02:35:47.160
filed a lawsuit against gearbox software and Randy Pitchford and valve claiming

02:35:47.160 --> 02:35:51.920
that his music was used in, uh, Duke Nukem 3d 20th anniversary world tour

02:35:51.920 --> 02:35:55.080
without his permission and without him receiving compensation.

02:35:57.000 --> 02:35:59.640
Oh, so he's saying in exchange.

02:35:59.760 --> 02:36:06.320
Um, that he's requiring that a royalty of a dollar per unit sold be, um, given to

02:36:06.320 --> 02:36:06.560
him.

02:36:07.080 --> 02:36:08.920
So we'll have to see what happens with that.

02:36:09.280 --> 02:36:09.600
Yeah.

02:36:10.400 --> 02:36:14.000
And then last but not least, there is a new shooting collection.

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:15.520
That's coming to the Nintendo switch.

02:36:15.600 --> 02:36:21.520
The, uh, psycho shooting stars alpha, which is coming here.

02:36:21.520 --> 02:36:28.920
It's got strikers, 1945, uh, looks like strikers, 1945, three, um,

02:36:28.920 --> 02:36:35.400
zero gunner to dragon blaze, uh, strikers, 1945, two and sold divide.

02:36:37.280 --> 02:36:38.040
Looks pretty cool.

02:36:38.040 --> 02:36:42.680
If you like your classic arcade shooter games and that's coming out January 24th,

02:36:44.120 --> 02:36:47.960
I'm sorry, that's in Europe, uh, North America's game, January 21st.

02:36:49.240 --> 02:36:51.600
Um, I have another quick little last minute story.

02:36:51.600 --> 02:36:54.880
So metal mayhem was sharing this in our discord and usually I don't share all the

02:36:54.880 --> 02:36:57.240
sales and everything cause there's a lot of sales are going out there.

02:36:57.440 --> 02:36:59.960
This one's a little bit interesting though, because, um, devolver is doing a

02:36:59.960 --> 02:37:01.280
sale through good old games.

02:37:01.600 --> 02:37:04.200
Um, and it's not just games, but it's movies.

02:37:04.520 --> 02:37:08.360
Um, which I know we sometimes forget that movies go on sale and on platforms and

02:37:08.360 --> 02:37:11.760
things as well, but then I'm looking at some of these movies and there are things

02:37:11.760 --> 02:37:14.080
that I haven't really heard of, but they're really cheap.

02:37:14.080 --> 02:37:15.520
And I imagine these are indie movies.

02:37:15.680 --> 02:37:18.680
For example, there's a movie called burning man beyond black rock.

02:37:18.680 --> 02:37:20.400
So I imagine that it's from 2005.

02:37:20.400 --> 02:37:24.280
So it's a little older at this point, but, um, I imagine there is, uh, you know,

02:37:24.480 --> 02:37:25.360
like a documentary.

02:37:25.680 --> 02:37:29.600
Uh, I did not know angry video game nerd made a movie, but it also doesn't surprise

02:37:29.600 --> 02:37:31.400
me at the same time that is on sale as well.

02:37:31.400 --> 02:37:34.280
That was about the, uh, et thing.

02:37:35.720 --> 02:37:36.720
The angry video game nerd.

02:37:36.720 --> 02:37:36.960
Really?

02:37:36.960 --> 02:37:37.240
Yeah.

02:37:37.360 --> 02:37:37.880
Interesting.

02:37:38.400 --> 02:37:41.640
Um, there's a movie called Austin high, which I think I had heard about that one.

02:37:41.840 --> 02:37:43.400
I'm trying to see what else is a little newer.

02:37:43.400 --> 02:37:44.400
I mean, these they're there.

02:37:44.640 --> 02:37:47.720
A lot of these are older movies cause they are only like a dollar 50 at this point.

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:53.120
Uh, pixel poetry, steam dream and good game are from about three years ago.

02:37:53.120 --> 02:37:54.320
So kind of neat.

02:37:54.720 --> 02:37:55.560
So there you go.

02:37:55.600 --> 02:37:56.520
Check those out if you want.

02:37:57.200 --> 02:38:02.000
So, and a dark to see who wants to point out the games done quick, did a little

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:05.160
like a Twitch con edition, GDQX.

02:38:05.600 --> 02:38:08.480
They raised 150,000 for able gamers.

02:38:08.480 --> 02:38:09.920
That's what I was talking about earlier.

02:38:09.960 --> 02:38:10.480
Oh, that's right.

02:38:10.960 --> 02:38:12.120
We got the final number though.

02:38:12.480 --> 02:38:12.560
Yeah.

02:38:12.560 --> 02:38:15.240
They actually exceeded last year's numbers.

02:38:15.840 --> 02:38:16.080
Yeah.

02:38:16.120 --> 02:38:16.520
Good job.

02:38:16.560 --> 02:38:17.680
Able gamers is a good charity.

02:38:17.680 --> 02:38:19.040
So, um, congrats to able gamers.

02:38:19.360 --> 02:38:20.000
Yay.

02:38:20.240 --> 02:38:21.520
Gamers doing good things.

02:38:21.560 --> 02:38:23.240
That is a great note to end this show on.

02:38:23.240 --> 02:38:25.520
So we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:38:25.520 --> 02:38:26.640
But I do want to say thank you.

02:38:26.640 --> 02:38:29.400
Of course, as always for tuning into Orange Laundrio, thank you for your

02:38:29.400 --> 02:38:33.160
support of our show, be it on the podcast feed or watching here live on Twitch.

02:38:33.320 --> 02:38:35.000
We really appreciate you and your support.

02:38:35.040 --> 02:38:37.840
Um, if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Laundrio, tell a

02:38:37.840 --> 02:38:38.840
friend or two about the show.

02:38:38.840 --> 02:38:41.600
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:38:41.760 --> 02:38:44.760
But if the voices aren't here to put on air, what are we to do?

02:38:44.880 --> 02:38:48.440
So, um, yeah, uh, a nice review, a five star review on one of

02:38:48.440 --> 02:38:49.440
those sites goes a long way.

02:38:49.640 --> 02:38:50.840
Hosting on Twitch.

02:38:50.840 --> 02:38:52.720
I can't stress how magnificent that is.

02:38:52.720 --> 02:38:54.520
It's discoverability.

02:38:54.520 --> 02:38:57.800
It's very important and all that's even going to become bigger as Twitch

02:38:57.800 --> 02:39:00.760
goes through some of these big changes in the next couple of months

02:39:00.760 --> 02:39:02.320
to their main site design.

02:39:02.720 --> 02:39:03.200
Anyway.

02:39:03.240 --> 02:39:04.640
Um, thank you again.

02:39:04.640 --> 02:39:06.240
So let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

02:39:06.240 --> 02:39:06.960
I'll start with you tonight.

02:39:06.960 --> 02:39:08.440
Loki, what do you, what's your final thought?

02:39:08.520 --> 02:39:09.960
I did work on my game this week.

02:39:09.960 --> 02:39:11.560
I forgot to mention that in my game week.

02:39:11.600 --> 02:39:15.880
It was mostly bug fixing because I had done a bunch of changes and didn't.

02:39:16.360 --> 02:39:19.760
I, cause I had done a bunch of changes, but that was the same time I had

02:39:19.960 --> 02:39:22.720
deleted the actual pieces of my level.

02:39:23.040 --> 02:39:24.280
And so then I put them all back.

02:39:24.280 --> 02:39:28.280
And so they had a lot of stuff to fix because something broke and now it's

02:39:28.280 --> 02:39:30.400
back up to where it should be now.

02:39:30.760 --> 02:39:33.920
And so I can build from that, but that, that was my Saturday.

02:39:34.960 --> 02:39:35.360
All right.

02:39:35.400 --> 02:39:35.880
That's awesome.

02:39:36.360 --> 02:39:39.600
Uh, my final thought for the night is you can't really see it on camera.

02:39:39.600 --> 02:39:44.400
You can see way in the corner, you see some boxes sticking out just a little bit.

02:39:44.400 --> 02:39:47.560
You can see it under underneath my golden girls, vinyl pop figures,

02:39:47.560 --> 02:39:48.920
which is what's on the right side.

02:39:48.920 --> 02:39:49.600
I got you on this.

02:39:49.760 --> 02:39:52.240
There's a whole side over there.

02:39:52.560 --> 02:39:55.600
That's just nothing but boxes and boxes.

02:39:56.040 --> 02:40:00.400
And what that is, that is grandpa from the Horde house days or captain

02:40:00.400 --> 02:40:01.880
Matt from starboard power coupling.

02:40:02.240 --> 02:40:09.920
That is the, that is all pumpkin spice shit of different stuff.

02:40:09.920 --> 02:40:12.880
I haven't opened it yet because I'm waiting for the last of it to arrive

02:40:12.880 --> 02:40:15.120
tomorrow and then I'm going to do a Facebook live where I open it all.

02:40:15.520 --> 02:40:16.800
And then I'm going to come over and help you eat it.

02:40:16.800 --> 02:40:19.960
I'm kind of scared, but I'm also like, that's a lot of waste.

02:40:20.160 --> 02:40:22.440
Like, why couldn't it just be in one fucking box?

02:40:22.640 --> 02:40:24.720
Like, but you know what?

02:40:24.720 --> 02:40:26.040
I'm cat condo.

02:40:26.120 --> 02:40:27.640
You know what he gave me last year?

02:40:28.280 --> 02:40:29.240
Do you know what he gave me last year?

02:40:29.240 --> 02:40:31.680
That actually lasts a long time over there.

02:40:31.760 --> 02:40:35.520
It, uh, it was the syrup and, but the pumpkin creamers, they actually, there

02:40:35.520 --> 02:40:40.080
was like four boxes of pumpkin creamers gave me a box, I gave you a lot.

02:40:40.080 --> 02:40:43.840
And then I, I put it out at work and I just invited coworkers to come

02:40:43.840 --> 02:40:45.360
over and steal them and they did.

02:40:45.360 --> 02:40:46.400
And you know, it was great.

02:40:46.760 --> 02:40:47.360
Shared the love.

02:40:47.360 --> 02:40:50.960
So anyway, uh, all I can say is the classic Jesse Spano line.

02:40:50.960 --> 02:40:51.800
I'm so excited.

02:40:51.800 --> 02:40:52.600
I'm so excited.

02:40:52.600 --> 02:40:53.360
I'm so scared.

02:40:53.880 --> 02:40:55.760
Last but not least, dark soccer, your final thought.

02:40:56.240 --> 02:40:58.560
Um, I've got a really busy week.

02:40:58.600 --> 02:41:00.000
I've got a con guide to finish.

02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:01.800
I've got Rosh Hashanah service tomorrow.

02:41:01.840 --> 02:41:03.000
I've got to take mid into the vet.

02:41:03.960 --> 02:41:07.560
Got a lot of crap on my plate, but I can do it.

02:41:08.120 --> 02:41:09.040
You can do it myself.

02:41:09.080 --> 02:41:09.720
I believe in you.

02:41:10.480 --> 02:41:11.920
And maybe there's another design thing.

02:41:11.920 --> 02:41:13.240
I might be interested.

02:41:13.400 --> 02:41:14.000
We'll talk later.

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:16.800
Rob, do you believe in life after love?

02:41:17.120 --> 02:41:17.760
Uh, of course.

02:41:20.640 --> 02:41:21.120
All right.

02:41:21.640 --> 02:41:23.480
Anyway, uh, that's it.

02:41:23.520 --> 02:41:24.240
Bye everybody.

02:41:24.280 --> 02:41:24.720
Good night.

02:41:24.760 --> 02:41:25.680
We'll see you next time.

02:41:25.760 --> 02:41:26.760
Uh, here at orange sounds radio.

02:41:26.760 --> 02:41:27.920
We'll do this all again next week.

02:41:27.920 --> 02:41:28.480
Sound good.

02:41:28.720 --> 02:41:29.040
Bye.

02:41:29.040 --> 02:41:29.360
Bye.

02:41:30.120 --> 02:41:32.760
You've been listening to orange lounge radio.

02:41:33.480 --> 02:41:39.280
