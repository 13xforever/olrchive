00:00.000 --> 00:17.280
This week, Monster Rancher is getting remastered and coming to the Switch!

00:17.280 --> 00:21.000
The love of my preteen and teenage years, this is one sim game that's possibly just

00:21.000 --> 00:22.240
steeped in nostalgia.

00:22.240 --> 00:25.520
This is just one story, stay tuned for the rest of the week's gaming news starting right

00:25.520 --> 00:32.840
now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:32.840 --> 00:36.840
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where

00:36.840 --> 00:43.200
every gamer has a voice, it is Orange Lounge Radio Live Tonight, episode number 792 for

00:43.200 --> 00:47.260
this September the 15th of 2019.

00:47.260 --> 00:52.600
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me here live tonight is my co-host, Mr. Smoosh, who

00:52.600 --> 01:01.000
is off camera screaming up a storm because Tech Master Loki decided to bring KFC to the

01:01.000 --> 01:07.080
studio tonight and Mr. Smoosh is one entitled kitty who feels that he should get to have

01:07.080 --> 01:08.480
a piece of that chicken.

01:08.480 --> 01:12.920
I think maybe I'll go step away and see to Mr. Smoosh.

01:12.920 --> 01:17.840
Hi DarkSakura or Jamie Summers, I hope you're well.

01:17.840 --> 01:22.440
She's gonna go be a kitty ant right now and take care of Mr. Smoosh.

01:22.440 --> 01:29.960
Okay, here's what's funny about this and why I'm laughing is because Alan, he, okay

01:29.960 --> 01:34.440
apparently, okay, I'm sorry, this is like horrible radio, I'm sorry, this is really

01:34.440 --> 01:35.440
funny what's playing out.

01:35.440 --> 01:41.040
Okay, so number one, Alan is out of town right now, he went to, he went to the Midwest for

01:41.040 --> 01:45.040
a work conference, so he's not here, so he's usually gone during the show anyway because

01:45.040 --> 01:50.000
he does stuff on Sunday nights, but he's usually not here, but Mr. Smoosh is usually has a

01:50.000 --> 01:54.520
shit together because like Alan's around and, you know, able to like take care of him.

01:54.520 --> 01:59.120
But so what happens is that when he's really misbehaving, sometimes we'll put him in the

01:59.120 --> 02:03.200
spare bedroom and we'll shut him in there for, you know, 30 minutes or so and we call

02:03.200 --> 02:04.200
it kitty jail.

02:04.200 --> 02:05.200
Yeah.

02:05.200 --> 02:09.440
And don't worry, we're not cruel, he has water and, you know, he's fine, but like at least

02:09.440 --> 02:11.320
when he's in there, he can't like meow.

02:11.320 --> 02:15.240
But DarkSakura, you said, so DarkSakura is the punisher on Sunday nights.

02:15.240 --> 02:18.480
Yeah, well, he also lets me pick him up for five seconds.

02:18.480 --> 02:24.720
So I guess he likes boobs or something, but at any rate, like I, he, you saw him do this.

02:24.720 --> 02:30.280
He started turning and going down the hall and he went into kitty jail by himself and

02:30.280 --> 02:32.320
all I did was shut the door.

02:32.320 --> 02:33.400
That's pretty amazing.

02:33.400 --> 02:35.040
Like he knows he's in trouble.

02:35.040 --> 02:37.320
He just went into kitty jail of his own.

02:37.320 --> 02:40.300
That's like when we get the carrier, like if he has to go to the vet or something, we'll

02:40.300 --> 02:41.480
put the carrier on the ground.

02:41.480 --> 02:44.320
He just walks right in and he's like, all right, I guess it's time.

02:44.320 --> 02:45.540
Like he's not Midna.

02:45.540 --> 02:49.140
She's such a weird cat, but like in the best possible way, not Midna.

02:49.140 --> 02:53.300
She's like, Oh, is that thing like to the point that, I mean, I'm, I was thinking I

02:53.300 --> 02:56.380
might have to take her to the vet this week cause she started wheezing last night.

02:56.380 --> 02:57.380
Oh no.

02:57.380 --> 02:59.220
Um, but she hasn't done it at all today.

02:59.220 --> 03:03.180
So I think maybe she just got into something or had an allergy attack or something.

03:03.180 --> 03:08.780
Um, but I was just thinking that maybe this time I was just going to take her on her leash

03:08.780 --> 03:12.580
instead of put her in the carrier cause she resists the carrier, but she's okay with her

03:12.580 --> 03:13.580
leash.

03:13.580 --> 03:15.180
I have, I have a harness for my cat.

03:15.180 --> 03:16.580
I take her for walks in the backyard.

03:16.580 --> 03:17.580
Well, I have a harness.

03:17.580 --> 03:18.580
Nevermind.

03:18.580 --> 03:19.580
Uh, all right.

03:19.580 --> 03:23.860
Well, I just ordered a harness, so, but not for that just because it's fashionable.

03:23.860 --> 03:24.860
All right.

03:24.860 --> 03:27.300
It's you were, you were saying you were, it was inspired by K-pop videos.

03:27.300 --> 03:28.300
Yeah, it was.

03:28.300 --> 03:33.300
I just like, I kind of like that aesthetic cause it's kind of like on trend right now

03:33.300 --> 03:39.020
to wear like interesting, like leather accents or harnesses or things, but you wear it over

03:39.020 --> 03:43.140
just like mundane clothes or with something sexy ish.

03:43.140 --> 03:44.140
I don't know.

03:44.140 --> 03:50.260
But I was like, I kind of dig that aesthetic and it would go with some of my gothy stuff

03:50.260 --> 03:53.380
and I could wear it for sister outings if we go to the bolt or something.

03:53.380 --> 03:54.380
I don't know.

03:54.380 --> 03:57.220
Not that I'm into that, but I figured it would dress appropriately for a leather bar.

03:57.220 --> 03:58.220
Yes.

03:58.220 --> 03:59.220
Good.

03:59.220 --> 04:00.220
All right.

04:00.220 --> 04:01.220
You just, you just dress dress into impressing.

04:01.220 --> 04:04.220
Uh, going to our chat room because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at the

04:04.220 --> 04:06.660
voice of geeks network, twitch TV slash bog network.

04:06.660 --> 04:08.700
Yes, it is a video game podcast.

04:08.700 --> 04:13.680
You can see the video game topics along there on the side if you're watching live, but sometimes

04:13.680 --> 04:16.100
the cat derails us in the first five minutes of the show.

04:16.100 --> 04:19.960
Um, some of the comments in our chat over at twitch TV slash bog network, tiger claw

04:19.960 --> 04:22.140
says Mr. Smoosh is quite the diva.

04:22.140 --> 04:25.260
Um, pod culture says, damn, that's a loud smoosh.

04:25.260 --> 04:26.260
Try sleeping around here.

04:26.260 --> 04:28.140
I have to sleep with earplugs.

04:28.140 --> 04:29.140
I know.

04:29.140 --> 04:30.780
Oh, don't encourage him.

04:30.780 --> 04:31.780
Um, let's see.

04:31.780 --> 04:36.020
Dark Tetsuya says five minutes in and smoosh has already derailed everything.

04:36.020 --> 04:37.020
Love it.

04:37.020 --> 04:38.020
Yeah, you, you love it, but poof.

04:38.340 --> 04:39.340
All right.

04:39.340 --> 04:40.340
Anyway.

04:40.340 --> 04:41.340
Uh, and it's all his fault.

04:41.340 --> 04:42.340
Seriously.

04:42.340 --> 04:46.900
He is loud and shrill for bringing that a KFC that smelled up the room and he felt entitled

04:46.900 --> 04:47.900
to it, but that's okay.

04:47.900 --> 04:51.180
I, I, I meow a lot at the scent of KFC as well.

04:51.180 --> 04:52.300
Say hello to tech master Loki.

04:52.300 --> 04:57.220
I didn't want KFC, but the other place in it would have gone to the Korean oven chicken

04:57.220 --> 04:58.220
fried chicken.

04:58.220 --> 05:01.940
Yeah, they were being special today.

05:01.940 --> 05:06.540
So they, they had their, they weren't answering their phone, which was inconvenient for me.

05:06.580 --> 05:08.340
They were like closed to that being closed.

05:08.340 --> 05:09.340
Yeah.

05:09.340 --> 05:10.340
So they, they weren't answering their phones.

05:10.340 --> 05:13.540
I was like, okay, well I've had this before where I've called a couple of times and they

05:13.540 --> 05:15.540
won't answer and then eventually they will.

05:15.540 --> 05:21.860
Um, so they answer the phone, their door is unlocked, but like everything looked like

05:21.860 --> 05:23.300
they're in the middle of construction.

05:23.300 --> 05:26.420
So I'm like, okay, I can hear people in the back.

05:26.420 --> 05:31.620
I see the ovens are on you guys open, you know, it's no one answered.

05:31.620 --> 05:34.140
So like, okay, I'm leaving with the KFC.

05:34.140 --> 05:37.180
There's a lot of churches in the area, so maybe they were doing a catering event or

05:37.180 --> 05:38.180
something.

05:38.180 --> 05:42.020
No, they were like doing some remodeling or something cause they had all the chairs stacked

05:42.020 --> 05:46.460
and then they had like some, maybe they're putting central air in bringing the place

05:46.460 --> 05:50.100
up to code after you were complimenting all the delicious chicken.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.100
All right.

05:51.100 --> 05:54.620
Anyway, uh, we're going to get into talking about video games, but I do want to mention

05:54.620 --> 05:59.320
if you do want to see all the sites and sounds such as the occasional smush cameo or me pointing

05:59.320 --> 06:01.340
at things along the side of the screen.

06:01.340 --> 06:06.780
Of course the audio podcast is free and always has been for the last 17 plus years and will

06:06.780 --> 06:10.500
continue to be, but if you want to get in on the video, it just takes a subscription

06:10.500 --> 06:13.940
to VOG network over twitch.tv slash VOG network.

06:13.940 --> 06:16.980
And many of you get one free with your Amazon prime.

06:16.980 --> 06:20.340
But if you don't have Amazon prime or you've already used it somewhere else supporting

06:20.340 --> 06:25.620
another fabulous indie streamer, then it is sub-tember and you can get those subscriptions

06:25.620 --> 06:26.620
half off.

06:26.620 --> 06:30.740
So, and every, oh, since we did the switch to video, every OLR is there, every Bobby

06:30.740 --> 06:32.060
black Wolf is there.

06:32.060 --> 06:33.900
Some of the impromptu specials are there.

06:33.900 --> 06:35.800
Like the guys on a dragon con we did last week.

06:35.800 --> 06:38.340
So you can check that out over at twitch.tv slash VOG network.

06:38.340 --> 06:39.740
That's the only time I'm going to hype that though.

06:39.740 --> 06:43.420
Uh, but I have to give that a shout out, um, because you know, there it is.

06:43.420 --> 06:46.260
I also want to shout out dark soccer as cookies that she's holding up on cam.

06:46.260 --> 06:47.260
They were pretty good.

06:47.260 --> 06:51.380
Like, you know, sometimes your friends cook things and you're like, I don't know, but

06:51.380 --> 06:57.460
your cookies are, are your cookies always deliver these, um, this batch is coffee, chocolate

06:57.460 --> 06:58.460
chip.

06:59.060 --> 07:01.420
And I'm like super happy with them.

07:01.420 --> 07:02.420
Yeah.

07:02.420 --> 07:04.420
They turned out even the burned ones are good.

07:04.420 --> 07:05.420
Am I weird?

07:05.420 --> 07:09.460
I like when it's like a little bit burnt, like I like toast a little bit burnt, not

07:09.460 --> 07:10.620
like completely black.

07:10.620 --> 07:11.620
That's gross.

07:11.620 --> 07:17.580
But like, just like a little bit burnt, like that dark brown is my oven, not all the numbers

07:17.580 --> 07:19.140
on it work.

07:19.140 --> 07:21.700
So I have to bake it three 50 for my cookies.

07:21.700 --> 07:22.700
That's just how you do it.

07:22.700 --> 07:23.700
Yeah.

07:23.700 --> 07:24.700
Three 58 minutes.

07:24.700 --> 07:25.700
Perfect.

07:25.700 --> 07:26.700
Perfect.

07:26.860 --> 07:31.620
I have, because my zero doesn't work normally when I want to do three fifties, I do three

07:31.620 --> 07:36.340
51 and automatically adjusted three 50 except now my three isn't working.

07:36.340 --> 07:41.300
So I had to cook at four 10 by hitting four one one to get a little enough temperature

07:41.300 --> 07:43.100
and then keep part of the lid open.

07:43.100 --> 07:47.380
So I had to like keep watching it, see how the cookies were doing and it was a pain in

07:47.380 --> 07:48.380
the tuchus.

07:48.380 --> 07:51.940
Uh, act after reminding us as well with a little plug there, all subs on Twitch are

07:51.940 --> 07:53.300
half off for September.

07:53.300 --> 07:57.960
And if you use the sub timber bit emote, if you are feeling so generous to donate biddies,

07:57.960 --> 07:59.980
it does give 10% more to the streamer.

07:59.980 --> 08:00.980
Yes.

08:00.980 --> 08:04.620
And, um, we, we do put your money back into making VOG better, uh, next on the agenda.

08:04.620 --> 08:08.100
And I'm hoping probably by next week, I couldn't get around to it this week as I started the

08:08.100 --> 08:11.380
new job and everything, but I'm hoping in the next week, I'm looking at getting mic

08:11.380 --> 08:13.780
stands for dark soccer and myself at least.

08:13.780 --> 08:18.180
Um, so that with our mics, because the adjustment noises, I know sometimes can be really bad

08:18.180 --> 08:21.720
when we're picking up mics and putting them down, um, which is just, we've used handheld

08:21.720 --> 08:26.400
mics for the 17 years we've done this show and because keep in mind, I do hosting on

08:26.400 --> 08:27.400
the side too.

08:27.400 --> 08:28.720
So I do a lot of like hosting gigs.

08:28.720 --> 08:31.240
So like I live and breathe handheld mics.

08:31.240 --> 08:35.680
So I realize a lot of podcasters use the ones that are in place, but that we do, we have

08:35.680 --> 08:36.780
a lot of movement too.

08:36.780 --> 08:39.560
So I don't know if the ones that are totally in place are good, but I do have an idea for

08:39.560 --> 08:43.900
like stands that we can kind of grab the stand and you won't have as much of the adjustment

08:43.900 --> 08:44.900
noise.

08:44.900 --> 08:48.040
So that's something proud of me getting things ready for my streaming setup.

08:48.040 --> 08:49.520
I got a pop cover.

08:49.520 --> 08:56.240
I'm going to be even prouder when you start streaming because until you do until you stream,

08:56.240 --> 08:58.840
you are him writing video games, money.

08:58.840 --> 09:04.720
How much money did I just throw into things, mister, by the way, this is on sale at Best

09:04.720 --> 09:05.720
Buy.

09:05.720 --> 09:06.720
You should get it.

09:06.720 --> 09:08.400
And I'm like, damn it.

09:08.400 --> 09:09.400
And I got it.

09:09.400 --> 09:10.400
What did I tell you to buy?

09:10.400 --> 09:12.840
I think it was on the dragon con digital media discord.

09:12.840 --> 09:15.320
I saw some sale and I was like, Oh, dark soccer.

09:15.320 --> 09:16.760
It was the stream deck.

09:16.760 --> 09:17.760
Oh yeah.

09:17.800 --> 09:18.800
I love the thing.

09:18.800 --> 09:19.800
We used to switch all the different scenes.

09:19.800 --> 09:23.080
If I want to run, if I want to run B roll of something, I've got the blue hooked up

09:23.080 --> 09:30.360
right now, the snowball, and I got a pop cover for it because I pop things a few times.

09:30.360 --> 09:33.200
And I know these mics have not been the greatest on that.

09:33.200 --> 09:36.000
So we are trying to make it better, but it's just, you know, little baby steps.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
I have done recording with that mic on my iMac.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.240
I need to hook my iMac back up.

09:40.240 --> 09:42.280
I have my gaming rig set up right now.

09:42.800 --> 09:48.520
But, um, you know, the only delay I see after I get everything started is when we pick up,

09:48.520 --> 09:51.720
um, my new, uh, Mac that I'm going to do a boot.

09:51.720 --> 09:52.720
Nice.

09:52.720 --> 09:56.160
Uh, nifty eight Oh five and chat says I'm going to try and farm some bits at Twitch

09:56.160 --> 09:57.160
con.

09:57.160 --> 10:02.080
I want to go to Twitch con so bad, but with having just started the new job, I just, I

10:02.080 --> 10:03.360
don't think I can swing the time.

10:03.360 --> 10:09.280
I'm so sad about it, but Oh, well maybe next year, depending on where they have it.

10:09.280 --> 10:11.320
So anyway, let's get into some gaming news.

10:11.360 --> 10:12.640
We got to, uh, we got to get into it.

10:12.640 --> 10:15.800
So, uh, Tokyo game show happened this past week.

10:15.800 --> 10:18.120
So there was a bit of news that came out of Tokyo game show.

10:18.120 --> 10:20.400
I forgot to ask before the show, Loki to do these.

10:20.400 --> 10:24.760
So I guess I should, cause look, he's going to town on KFC, so I should start as I can

10:24.760 --> 10:25.760
do it.

10:25.760 --> 10:26.760
It's fine.

10:26.760 --> 10:27.760
Oh, you got it.

10:27.760 --> 10:28.760
Okay.

10:28.760 --> 10:29.760
Yes.

10:29.760 --> 10:30.760
Tell us a little bit about what happened to Tokyo game show.

10:30.760 --> 10:31.760
Please.

10:31.760 --> 10:32.760
They showed off games.

10:32.760 --> 10:33.760
They sure did.

10:33.760 --> 10:34.760
There's two big ones.

10:34.760 --> 10:35.760
There's two big ones.

10:35.760 --> 10:36.760
Lots of cosplay.

10:36.760 --> 10:37.760
There's two.

10:37.760 --> 10:38.760
We have some other stuff sprinkled throughout the show, but the two big ones I want to start

10:38.760 --> 10:39.760
off with the two big ones.

10:39.920 --> 10:44.080
Beat me in a 2d X ultimate mobile and sound voltage ultimate.

10:44.080 --> 10:46.320
No, those aren't the ones I actually forgot.

10:46.320 --> 10:48.400
They did have a beat me in a 2d X mobile.

10:48.400 --> 10:49.400
What?

10:49.400 --> 10:50.400
Okay.

10:50.400 --> 10:51.680
Do you want it's, you know what?

10:51.680 --> 10:52.680
I'll take it.

10:52.680 --> 10:54.480
It's better than nothing, which is what I've got.

10:54.480 --> 10:59.520
I did think it was funny though, when they're like showing them playing on the, um, they

10:59.520 --> 11:00.880
did something, I don't remember what it was.

11:00.880 --> 11:01.880
Something was wrong.

11:01.880 --> 11:06.380
But like the first time that they showed the guy playing the game, like just fucking up

11:06.380 --> 11:07.380
all of it.

11:07.380 --> 11:09.440
And it's like, yeah.

11:09.440 --> 11:14.040
For those that don't know, like the roots of our show are in music based video games,

11:14.040 --> 11:17.320
dark soccer, Loki, and I all met playing dance, dance revolution.

11:17.320 --> 11:19.760
So beat mania is like adjacent to that.

11:19.760 --> 11:24.480
So we're always going to make these like tongue in cheek jokes about Konami's music game series.

11:24.480 --> 11:27.560
And when it randomly decides to show up again, well, I shouldn't say randomly because I know

11:27.560 --> 11:30.740
things like sound volt X are still very popular.

11:30.740 --> 11:32.680
You know, I was just a dragon con a couple of weeks ago.

11:32.680 --> 11:36.880
The Tokyo attack brings all those arcade machines and those sound volt X, you know, they're

11:36.880 --> 11:37.880
popular throughout the night.

11:37.880 --> 11:41.200
You don't have to, you beat is hugely popular.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.300
You can get it on my mind.

11:43.300 --> 11:44.840
Is that the one with the round?

11:44.840 --> 11:45.840
Yeah.

11:45.840 --> 11:46.840
Yes.

11:46.840 --> 11:47.840
My mind is really fun.

11:47.840 --> 11:48.840
Yeah.

11:48.840 --> 11:49.840
Yeah.

11:49.840 --> 11:52.120
Well now you can get it on your, your mobile device and they have controllers that you

11:52.120 --> 11:53.120
can buy too.

11:53.120 --> 11:57.360
They had, you know what they put UB on mobile reflect beat had like, I remember having those

11:57.360 --> 12:01.600
in my iPad and they were decent translations, but these actually have physical controllers

12:01.600 --> 12:02.600
now too.

12:02.600 --> 12:05.040
Like 2d X and um, sound voltage.

12:05.040 --> 12:06.040
Okay.

12:06.040 --> 12:07.040
All right.

12:07.200 --> 12:08.200
Cause that'd be weird.

12:08.200 --> 12:09.200
That wasn't what I was planning to talk.

12:09.200 --> 12:10.200
It's all right.

12:10.200 --> 12:11.200
I know.

12:11.200 --> 12:13.240
I appreciate the little aside for our music game loyalists that have been with us throughout

12:13.240 --> 12:14.240
the years.

12:14.240 --> 12:15.240
It's, it's a nice little touch.

12:15.240 --> 12:19.720
I also say I'm super jealous of the dream cast and Sega Saturn bags that they were selling

12:19.720 --> 12:27.040
at Tokyo game show just saying do want and um, uh, uh, uh, Genesis or mega drive controller

12:27.040 --> 12:28.040
neck pillow.

12:28.040 --> 12:32.040
I'm looking, I've been looking at all like just the stuff that they were selling.

12:32.040 --> 12:34.840
And I also want like the mini Nakururu.

12:34.840 --> 12:39.840
So no, one of the big gains, of course they showed off was the font 57 remake and some

12:39.840 --> 12:41.680
cool new things coming out about that.

12:41.680 --> 12:46.120
So, uh, one thing they announced was the classic gameplay options.

12:46.120 --> 12:52.480
So if you don't necessarily like the final fantasy 13, uh, type gameplay, you can actually

12:52.480 --> 12:55.960
do turn-based gameplay with menus and all that fun stuff.

12:55.960 --> 12:59.920
I actually, um, uh, for those that are watching on Twitch, I prepared some B roll tonight.

12:59.920 --> 13:01.000
I had a lot to do it.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.720
So, uh, this is a little bit of the play through that they were doing at, um, and you can,

13:04.720 --> 13:08.640
you can hear a little bit of it, probably bleed over on the podcast as the audio is

13:08.640 --> 13:09.640
very down.

13:09.640 --> 13:12.760
Um, but you can actually, this is part of them actually, and you hear, if you probably

13:12.760 --> 13:16.360
hear them talking, cause this is them actually like doing a live play through.

13:16.360 --> 13:19.120
So they're actually, and I, you know, the trailer was great.

13:19.120 --> 13:20.200
I watched the trailer.

13:20.200 --> 13:23.760
I encourage many of you to watch the trailer, but a trailer is a trailer.

13:23.760 --> 13:28.000
I like this kind of stuff where you're actually seeing the game in progress.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.800
It looks way better.

13:29.800 --> 13:31.360
I've seen this before though.

13:31.360 --> 13:35.560
They did, um, they did, they did do, um, like something really, well, this was also from

13:35.560 --> 13:36.560
Tokyo Game Shows.

13:36.560 --> 13:37.560
You may have just seen it this week.

13:37.560 --> 13:38.560
No, no, no.

13:38.560 --> 13:40.760
There was another one that they did a few months ago that was talking about what the

13:40.760 --> 13:44.280
first mission was going to be like and how the battle system was going to look.

13:44.280 --> 13:45.280
There you go.

13:45.280 --> 13:46.280
Look, see, it's in wait mode.

13:46.280 --> 13:49.320
And now he, now cloud can choose the ability magic or item.

13:49.320 --> 13:50.320
It kind of pops up there.

13:50.320 --> 13:53.480
So a little taste of what it kind of looks like there, which is great.

13:53.480 --> 13:56.300
I love the way this looks like it's it.

13:56.300 --> 14:02.500
I'm in such a weird place with Final Fantasy 7 remake because it looks so fucking good.

14:02.500 --> 14:06.340
Like it just looks like such an evolution of the Final Fantasy engine.

14:06.340 --> 14:11.140
And I'm like, okay with the actionist actiony type stuff because they've kind of mixed it

14:11.140 --> 14:15.340
a little bit with the more traditional like, but I am totally down for them making remaking

14:15.340 --> 14:19.260
six when they, or how about don't remake anything?

14:19.260 --> 14:22.420
Like that's, that was my one hesitation is like, you know, here's the thing.

14:22.420 --> 14:23.420
Yes.

14:23.420 --> 14:24.420
Final Fantasy 7.

14:24.420 --> 14:25.580
I understand a lot of you are attached to it.

14:25.580 --> 14:28.420
It was the Final Fantasy when you were like 12 years old or whatever.

14:28.420 --> 14:32.040
And it's the one you remember the best, but it's like, I just, I would have loved to see

14:32.040 --> 14:38.180
a new game, a new Final Fantasy like this because Final Fantasy 15, like you definitely

14:38.180 --> 14:45.500
see like elements of 15 in this, but you don't really see like, I just would have liked to

14:45.500 --> 14:48.840
see like the evolution of that because let's be real what we're looking at here.

14:48.840 --> 14:53.860
This is just Final Fantasy 15 engine pushed to the next level is what we're looking at,

14:53.860 --> 14:54.860
but it's running out.

14:54.860 --> 14:58.860
So I gotta go back to us life, but, uh, yeah, so, but my, the Final Fantasy 7 remakes looking

14:58.860 --> 14:59.860
sweet.

14:59.860 --> 15:04.220
Like I, despite the fact I'm kind of like, why did they, why did they use all this to

15:04.220 --> 15:05.360
remake seven?

15:05.360 --> 15:06.900
Why can't they just do a 16?

15:06.900 --> 15:08.900
I'm still all about this.

15:08.900 --> 15:09.900
Obviously I'm going to buy it.

15:09.900 --> 15:17.580
Obviously like feelings on the story aside, it just looks like a painting in motion.

15:17.580 --> 15:18.580
Like it's just so gorgeous.

15:18.580 --> 15:19.860
It's so goddamn good looking.

15:19.860 --> 15:22.580
I was in my early twenties when it came out.

15:22.620 --> 15:31.220
I didn't even own a fucking PlayStation and I bought it and I moved out here with 53.5

15:31.220 --> 15:36.900
floppies loaded with nothing but Vincent fan art and Dogenchi.

15:36.900 --> 15:37.900
This is so you.

15:37.900 --> 15:39.140
I'm not even kidding.

15:39.140 --> 15:40.140
And you know what?

15:40.140 --> 15:42.180
I found one of the discs the other day.

15:42.180 --> 15:47.220
I have no way to read it, but I found one, um, some comp or some, uh, co-signs for your

15:47.220 --> 15:48.220
thoughts.

15:48.220 --> 15:49.220
Loki in our chat.

15:49.220 --> 15:50.220
Dark Tetsuya says co-signed with Loki.

15:50.220 --> 15:53.340
I'd love something like that, but for final fantasy six and quest buster says, I'd be

15:53.340 --> 15:56.220
all over a fantasy six remake on this scale too.

15:56.220 --> 15:57.220
Don't get me wrong.

15:57.220 --> 16:02.140
I love final fantasy six and it is weird that they never did the light 3d treatment with

16:02.140 --> 16:03.140
that.

16:03.140 --> 16:04.140
You know, you know what I mean?

16:04.140 --> 16:07.060
Like fantasy three, fantasy four kind of got that 3d remake, but they never did it with

16:07.060 --> 16:09.260
fantasy six, which I thought was a little weird.

16:09.260 --> 16:10.260
Yeah.

16:10.260 --> 16:11.260
Um, but, uh, okay.

16:11.260 --> 16:15.680
They didn't do a pharmacy five either, I guess, but they did those, they did those mobile

16:15.680 --> 16:16.680
ports.

16:16.680 --> 16:17.680
They did the one on the Wii.

16:17.680 --> 16:21.600
They weren't the, the new mobile ports are like the new graphics that were, was that

16:21.600 --> 16:24.660
four that was on the four was on the week.

16:24.660 --> 16:29.340
The best version of Final Fantasy four, in my opinion is the PSP one because it was like

16:29.340 --> 16:34.760
a remade 2d version and it had after years included, it was, it was a really solid package.

16:34.760 --> 16:40.520
Like I would love to see, uh, that game somehow re-released on like PlayStation four or something,

16:40.520 --> 16:47.020
you know, it shouldn't be that hard to emulate a PSP game or just, I know I'm totally sounding

16:47.020 --> 16:50.880
like ignorant when it comes to game making, but I guess maybe I am like recompile it for

16:50.880 --> 16:53.900
the PS4 versus the PlayStation portable.

16:53.900 --> 16:57.440
Like I realized it's not as easy as pushing a button, but I can't imagine it's going to

16:57.440 --> 16:59.480
take vast amounts of resources either.

16:59.480 --> 17:00.880
I don't know.

17:00.880 --> 17:01.880
They've done it before.

17:01.880 --> 17:06.960
You're saying a PlayStation four can emulate a PSP or anyway, that might be tough.

17:06.960 --> 17:08.200
I mean, I go, I get it.

17:08.200 --> 17:09.560
The cell phone can do that.

17:09.560 --> 17:14.080
Like an old ass cell phone could do that, but PlayStation four with its ray tracing

17:14.080 --> 17:17.640
and whatnot, can't handle the sheer power of the PSP.

17:17.640 --> 17:24.180
But I'm ready for final fantasy 16 and I am so here for the fan wank where, and I don't,

17:24.180 --> 17:28.580
I don't know to what extent these rumors were, you know, sourced or whatever, but there was

17:28.580 --> 17:34.800
a big rumor that Naoki Ohshida, who is the producer on Final Fantasy 14, who really saved

17:34.800 --> 17:35.800
that game.

17:35.800 --> 17:38.840
He's the one that came in and turned it into realm reborn and so forth that he was going

17:38.840 --> 17:44.440
to hand off Final Fantasy 14, and he's going to be part of the 16 development team.

17:44.440 --> 17:45.980
And I want that to be true.

17:45.980 --> 17:47.280
So fucking bad.

17:47.280 --> 17:50.780
Like if Yoshida got to make a single player Final Fantasy game, and I just, I know I've

17:50.780 --> 17:54.540
said this a lot on the show, I'm going to say it one more time.

17:54.540 --> 17:58.900
The expansion storylines in Final Fantasy 14, heaven's words, storm blood, and now shadow

17:58.900 --> 18:04.880
bringers are probably some of the best, if not the best, I don't know, Final Fantasy

18:04.880 --> 18:09.420
six is hard to top, but like the best stories in the final fantasy universe.

18:09.420 --> 18:12.920
And because it's an MMO, so few people are going to see them.

18:12.920 --> 18:14.260
And it's, it's a real bummer.

18:14.260 --> 18:19.180
So like if they were to let him do a single player Final Fantasy game, Oh my God.

18:19.180 --> 18:20.180
Oh my God.

18:20.180 --> 18:21.180
All right.

18:21.180 --> 18:22.980
I've digressed completely from the Final Fantasy seven remake topic.

18:22.980 --> 18:28.340
I'm sorry, but I needed to talk about that important sidebar.

18:28.340 --> 18:34.460
So is anyone in here, show of hands, anyone here not interested in the seven remake at

18:34.460 --> 18:35.460
this point?

18:35.460 --> 18:38.120
I had a feeling, dark soccer.

18:38.120 --> 18:39.800
Have you kind of Vincent?

18:39.800 --> 18:46.320
Well, well remember episode one don't care Vincent, but he's not going to be in the first

18:46.320 --> 18:47.320
one.

18:47.320 --> 18:48.320
I don't care.

18:48.320 --> 18:49.840
I will eventually have Vincent.

18:49.840 --> 18:50.840
Okay.

18:50.840 --> 18:51.840
Okay.

18:51.840 --> 18:53.920
And I will get to watch the bitch die.

18:53.920 --> 18:55.240
No, you won't.

18:55.240 --> 18:56.240
Not in episode one.

18:56.240 --> 19:02.560
As I said, eventually, I can't wait for when they like say, guess what?

19:02.560 --> 19:05.420
We're taking, we're, we're taking the storyline in different directions.

19:05.420 --> 19:06.900
She's not going to die this time.

19:06.900 --> 19:07.900
I'll kill the bitch.

19:07.900 --> 19:09.700
I, I will find a way.

19:09.700 --> 19:10.820
I can't wait.

19:10.820 --> 19:12.300
No, I'm putting this out there.

19:12.300 --> 19:15.780
I'm going to put it in the atmosphere and then I can't take it back.

19:15.780 --> 19:18.980
They're going to fucking pull one up because remember what a fucking shock it was when

19:18.980 --> 19:22.260
Eris died in Final Fantasy seven the first time, because you didn't have the internet

19:22.260 --> 19:23.780
and all that stuff as prolific as it is now.

19:23.780 --> 19:24.780
What do you mean a shock?

19:24.780 --> 19:25.780
I was happy.

19:25.780 --> 19:29.100
Well, I know, but for most people, it was a pleasant surprise though for you.

19:29.100 --> 19:31.100
I kind of saw it happening.

19:31.440 --> 19:35.240
What if the gag is this time around, Oh, you re I'm about to be the most hated person on

19:35.240 --> 19:36.240
the internet.

19:36.240 --> 19:37.240
You ready?

19:37.240 --> 19:41.160
This time they're like, we're really going to shock them this time through like a trick.

19:41.160 --> 19:44.720
She's going to survive and Tifa dies.

19:44.720 --> 19:46.080
That doesn't work for the story.

19:46.080 --> 19:50.560
I mean, there's actually no logical reason and I'll put it this way because it was because

19:50.560 --> 19:56.760
she was dead that the whole shit happened with the live stream business.

19:56.760 --> 19:59.160
And Tifa has absolutely nothing to do with the life.

19:59.160 --> 20:00.760
I'm just saying, I'm just waiting.

20:00.760 --> 20:09.140
We have to kill the last survivor of their species because, and it ended up being like

20:09.140 --> 20:11.180
a big story point anyways.

20:11.180 --> 20:13.320
So I just don't see any way around it.

20:13.320 --> 20:18.820
And even so if, if she lives, I'm just gonna, um, head cannon that I locked her in a trunk

20:18.820 --> 20:21.820
and left her at the bottom of the pool.

20:21.820 --> 20:22.820
That's true.

20:22.820 --> 20:23.820
You still get to pick who's in your party.

20:23.820 --> 20:27.640
She is the one woman I will allow to be in a refrigerator.

20:27.640 --> 20:33.160
So are you saying you will be telling Aerith to just go back to the kitchen and not, no,

20:33.160 --> 20:36.400
I'm just going to tell her to just not be around.

20:36.400 --> 20:37.400
All right.

20:37.400 --> 20:44.880
Don't get, don't get in the way of my, uh, Tifa cloud romance, uh, SSJ 100 Matt is saying,

20:44.880 --> 20:46.760
I believe they will do something like that.

20:46.760 --> 20:50.700
Oh, tiger claws saying, I wouldn't be surprised if she lives, it's a remake and the remake

20:50.700 --> 20:52.500
doesn't have to be exactly like the original.

20:52.500 --> 20:55.020
They can take some liberties with it to make it different enough.

20:55.020 --> 20:56.980
I can just see dark soccer getting so angry.

20:56.980 --> 20:58.940
Um, watch me be right though.

20:58.940 --> 21:02.900
Then, uh, uh, uh, a newer name, I don't recognize rep cycled welcome.

21:02.900 --> 21:05.980
Sorry if I mispronounced your name, said she dropped the materia.

21:05.980 --> 21:09.220
So, but that, that doesn't mean it could have been in someone else's pocket.

21:09.220 --> 21:11.060
No, no, I get it.

21:11.060 --> 21:15.820
I, and I get what dark soccer say it like they would have to drastically shift the story

21:15.820 --> 21:19.940
to kill somebody else, you know, but maybe they'll kill Kate Seth.

21:19.940 --> 21:24.380
Would anybody be that upset if it, by the way, cat she, Oh, that's how it's pronounced

21:24.380 --> 21:25.380
all these years.

21:25.380 --> 21:26.860
I've said Kate Seth because it's cultic.

21:26.860 --> 21:27.860
Interesting.

21:27.860 --> 21:28.860
Good to know.

21:28.860 --> 21:33.060
Uh, anyway, uh, just fake us out, making it look like that she's going to live, but instead

21:33.060 --> 21:37.620
they'll go the whole tomb Raider route where she dies horribly.

21:37.620 --> 21:39.340
Pixel Pacas says dark soccer.

21:39.340 --> 21:44.500
I love your head Canon, LOL, uh, Meesh and chat says, I never even got to finish final

21:44.500 --> 21:47.980
fantasy seven and now I don't want to, it's, it's worth it.

21:47.980 --> 21:49.400
It's it's worth a play.

21:49.400 --> 21:50.400
It is.

21:50.400 --> 21:51.400
It's it's a little harder to play the original.

21:51.400 --> 21:52.400
It's so kind of graphic.

21:52.400 --> 21:53.620
I don't know why I hate her.

21:53.620 --> 21:56.680
She was such a fucking stereotype character.

21:56.680 --> 22:00.720
She had the personality of a noodle, but she was my healer.

22:00.720 --> 22:08.480
She existed just for plot, which is kind of the same problem I have with as much as you

22:08.480 --> 22:11.360
know, the mass effect fandom is all about Nylas.

22:11.360 --> 22:15.280
It's the same problem I have with that writing and it pisses me off.

22:15.280 --> 22:22.360
I'm here's the problem I have with final fantasy seven in the fact that, you know, she's dead

22:23.240 --> 22:28.440
is because we have the Phoenix down, which can bring things back to life.

22:28.440 --> 22:30.120
So why is anybody dead?

22:30.120 --> 22:31.120
Anybody at all?

22:31.120 --> 22:35.040
Because actually there's a, there's an explanation for this because you actually don't die.

22:35.040 --> 22:36.040
You never die.

22:36.040 --> 22:37.040
Your characters never die.

22:37.040 --> 22:42.480
They get KO'd like wait for the, it says KO'd your characters or party KO'd.

22:42.480 --> 22:43.480
Everybody's KO'd.

22:43.480 --> 22:44.480
So it's different.

22:44.480 --> 22:45.480
You don't die.

22:45.480 --> 22:48.400
You just get KO'd and Phoenix down revives your KO status.

22:48.400 --> 22:49.400
Fine.

22:49.400 --> 22:50.400
Look it up.

22:50.440 --> 22:53.840
It actually came up on a final fantasy 14 panel because somebody asked a question about

22:53.840 --> 22:58.440
what happens when everybody dies and he did this whole thing where he goes, well, they're

22:58.440 --> 22:59.440
KO'd.

22:59.440 --> 23:01.960
He kind of did this whole like wink.

23:01.960 --> 23:03.960
Nobody really dies except Harshvan.

23:03.960 --> 23:09.160
Uh, anyway, that was their whole thing for explaining why, and what was the game with

23:09.160 --> 23:10.800
Nathan Drake?

23:10.800 --> 23:12.260
Uncharted Uncharted.

23:12.260 --> 23:18.420
Why he can get shot so much and it's because he has a luck meter and so that finally when

23:18.460 --> 23:20.740
his luck runs out, the bullet finally hits him.

23:20.740 --> 23:21.740
Okay.

23:21.740 --> 23:23.980
Before we move on to another game, I wanted to say, uh, Bobby Blackwolf and Chad says,

23:23.980 --> 23:27.540
I mean the Marvel Cinematic Universe does things differently than the comics and everyone

23:27.540 --> 23:29.580
hates and loves them for it.

23:29.580 --> 23:34.060
So I don't, I'm just, I think it is very obvious going back to on topic with Final Fantasy

23:34.060 --> 23:39.700
7 in the trailer, it does seem like characters that were like side characters before seem

23:39.700 --> 23:42.540
to play a much bigger role this time.

23:42.540 --> 23:47.700
They're definitely, and that probably is a nature of the game only being episode one

23:47.700 --> 23:51.980
only being the Midgar part of the story is that they're probably some of these characters

23:51.980 --> 23:55.600
that were more side characters are taking on a bigger role because I mean, otherwise,

23:55.600 --> 23:59.100
you know, like we brought up earlier, you don't have Vincent yet.

23:59.100 --> 24:04.280
You don't have, um, K cat, cat, cat seat, catchy.

24:04.280 --> 24:05.980
You're not going to have that one yet.

24:05.980 --> 24:08.340
You're not going to have, does red 13 show up in bigger?

24:08.340 --> 24:09.340
Yes.

24:09.340 --> 24:12.480
Red 13 is bigger, but you know, it's going to, it's going to be limited on what characters

24:12.480 --> 24:13.480
you have.

24:13.480 --> 24:14.900
So maybe some of these side characters will take a bigger role.

24:14.900 --> 24:15.900
Who knows?

24:15.900 --> 24:16.900
We'll see.

24:17.100 --> 24:18.100
What's the show Tokyo game show?

24:18.100 --> 24:19.100
They show Death Stranding.

24:19.100 --> 24:26.660
They actually have like a long gameplay presentation to show off actually what you do in the game,

24:26.660 --> 24:28.700
which I still don't know what you do.

24:28.700 --> 24:32.100
Well, I, I watched a little bit of the video.

24:32.100 --> 24:35.860
I mean, I didn't watch all 45 minutes, but I did a little bit of hunting and pecking

24:35.860 --> 24:39.300
around the Death Stranding and I grabbed a little bit of footage here.

24:39.300 --> 24:43.580
I like how everything you carry, you can see, well, yeah, it's, that's the interesting thing.

24:43.580 --> 24:48.220
I've always thought it was funny, like in games you would have this gigantic inventory,

24:48.220 --> 24:51.260
but it like just seems to all fit magically in this backpack.

24:51.260 --> 24:55.260
But it really does seem like in this game and Death Stranding, like you see that he's

24:55.260 --> 24:59.180
carrying everything and it seems to affect like his weight and stuff too.

24:59.180 --> 25:03.360
There's a fucking baby in that thing or, you know, the, the fetus thing that's in the trailers

25:03.360 --> 25:04.360
in that thing.

25:04.360 --> 25:06.820
That's why it's like so awkward.

25:06.820 --> 25:09.740
But when you're actually looking at the gameplay footage, you can see there's like an open

25:09.740 --> 25:10.740
world.

25:10.740 --> 25:14.820
So if you're looking at on the footage that they're showing off, the Hideo Kojima is playing,

25:14.820 --> 25:17.360
they're going to a map and they're actually like setting a route.

25:17.360 --> 25:20.540
So they're doing like, I guess you could say a fetch quest type of thing, but like the

25:20.540 --> 25:21.540
delivery quest.

25:21.540 --> 25:25.100
Uh, so you can see like there's this giant map and they're actually like plotting a course

25:25.100 --> 25:30.340
on the map right now that Norman Reedus is going to run and I guess make some type of

25:30.340 --> 25:31.340
like delivery here.

25:31.340 --> 25:33.820
So you can actually kind of see, Oh, okay.

25:33.820 --> 25:37.020
So it's like an open the world type of thing.

25:37.020 --> 25:39.620
And you actually will see him run around a little bit.

25:39.700 --> 25:42.340
Well, hopefully this will just be so you don't have to hold down the damn controller all

25:42.340 --> 25:43.340
the time.

25:43.340 --> 25:44.340
Yeah.

25:44.340 --> 25:45.980
I mean, um, I don't know.

25:45.980 --> 25:51.940
Like again, I've been, believe me, I've been like the first one to say they need to actually

25:51.940 --> 25:54.620
show us what this fucking game is.

25:54.620 --> 25:59.220
And so you, cause we've had like what three years worth of just like cinematic teases

25:59.220 --> 26:00.220
and shit.

26:00.220 --> 26:01.220
Right.

26:01.220 --> 26:04.380
So I'm very happy that now what we're like two months from the game's release at this

26:04.380 --> 26:08.380
point, but we're finally getting to see like, okay, here's what the game looks like in motion.

26:08.380 --> 26:11.620
And I think they did, they did 45 minutes one day, they did like another 20 minutes

26:11.620 --> 26:12.620
another day.

26:12.620 --> 26:16.900
So you, you can get a full sense of like what the game actually kind of looks like, like

26:16.900 --> 26:17.900
as you're playing it now.

26:17.900 --> 26:20.980
He did, they just did a little thing that like was scanning the terrain too.

26:20.980 --> 26:24.940
I just saw that kind of remind me of no man's sky when you go like you're scanning for different

26:24.940 --> 26:25.940
materials.

26:25.940 --> 26:27.580
So I thought that was kind of interesting.

26:27.580 --> 26:32.740
So anyway, um, uh, rep cycled in our chat says it does seem like he's a courier.

26:32.740 --> 26:33.740
Yeah.

26:33.740 --> 26:34.740
I think that was part of the story.

26:34.740 --> 26:36.860
Oh, did they just, did they do the part where he changed his hat?

26:36.860 --> 26:39.740
So of course there's fashion accessories and things like that too, because you know

26:39.740 --> 26:44.660
there is, um, let's see, Misha in our chat says, by the time this game comes out, I'm

26:44.660 --> 26:47.860
not even sure I'll want it cause they're beating the source till it dies.

26:47.860 --> 26:49.060
So much talking about it.

26:49.060 --> 26:52.940
They're talking about this more than cyberpunk 2077 and we still don't know what this fucking

26:52.940 --> 26:53.940
game is about.

26:53.940 --> 26:55.820
Well, at least we finally learned a little more this week.

26:55.820 --> 26:59.440
Like I feel a little better after this week, but I do agree.

26:59.440 --> 27:04.760
It's been three years of like hype, but at the same time it is Hideo Kojima.

27:04.760 --> 27:09.560
So a little bit of hype is to be expected, but um, yeah, I'm just excited that this game

27:09.560 --> 27:13.300
is like finally about to come out and now I won't just get to see professionals like

27:13.300 --> 27:14.300
Kojima playing it.

27:14.300 --> 27:17.240
I'll get to watch people on Twitch play it and make a decision from there.

27:17.240 --> 27:20.000
I haven't decided if I want to buy this day one or not.

27:20.000 --> 27:23.360
I kind of think I do, but I'm not sure yet.

27:23.360 --> 27:24.680
So it looks interesting.

27:24.680 --> 27:25.680
Yeah, it does.

27:25.680 --> 27:28.640
It looks like, and especially like, you know, with games like breath of the wild and stuff

27:28.640 --> 27:33.360
being all the rage where like open world stuff is so like, I feel like there's going to be

27:33.360 --> 27:37.120
a lot to do and a lot to explore and so we'll see.

27:37.120 --> 27:39.360
But creepy silent hill creatures though.

27:39.360 --> 27:40.360
Yes.

27:40.360 --> 27:41.600
Yes.

27:41.600 --> 27:44.480
Creepy shit and ghost babies and ghost babies.

27:44.480 --> 27:45.800
Creepy shit and ghost babies.

27:45.800 --> 27:46.800
Hashtag.

27:46.800 --> 27:47.800
Um, let's see.

27:47.800 --> 27:51.080
Questbuster in chat says there are some combat bits in the first day footage, but they're

27:51.080 --> 27:54.520
later and they admittedly don't look bad, especially the part that submerges you in

27:54.520 --> 27:58.480
black ink and then makes you fight a weird lion with tentacles.

27:58.480 --> 27:59.480
Hmm.

27:59.480 --> 28:01.300
Uh, Kaijuto in chat says I won't buy it.

28:01.300 --> 28:03.040
It looks awful and too weird.

28:03.040 --> 28:04.040
No, it is.

28:04.040 --> 28:05.040
It is a little out there.

28:05.040 --> 28:06.600
It's not going to be for everybody's tastes.

28:06.600 --> 28:07.600
That's for sure.

28:07.600 --> 28:08.600
So, all right.

28:08.600 --> 28:09.600
Me.

28:09.600 --> 28:13.960
Me should chat says, all I know is you can pee on mushrooms to make them grow and you

28:13.960 --> 28:15.640
carry a baby.

28:15.640 --> 28:18.400
Did you see there was a little and you can drink monster.

28:18.400 --> 28:20.120
There was a clip on Twitter.

28:20.120 --> 28:25.280
I saw there was a gift that somebody took of like Norman Reedus's character because

28:25.280 --> 28:30.060
like what they did is they zoomed in on his crotch and the Norman Reedus character like

28:30.060 --> 28:33.820
goes like this, like bumps the camera up and then punches the person in the face for

28:33.820 --> 28:35.700
like staring at his crotch.

28:35.700 --> 28:39.460
And I don't know, like some people were saying, is this homophobia question mark question

28:39.460 --> 28:40.460
mark.

28:40.460 --> 28:46.060
But because, especially because you compare that to quiet in metal gear solid five, which

28:46.060 --> 28:48.140
does not react the same way.

28:48.140 --> 28:50.020
I don't, it's a gift.

28:50.020 --> 28:53.620
I haven't seen it in full context, so I'm not willing to hedge my bets on one side of

28:53.620 --> 28:54.780
the fence or the other.

28:54.780 --> 28:59.660
I do think it's interesting that a character is finally going to fight back for being sexualized

28:59.660 --> 29:02.300
in a video game by the in game camera.

29:02.300 --> 29:05.860
But yeah, that's a little breaking the fourth wall there a little bit.

29:05.860 --> 29:10.820
So I just, I want to see the context before I say, Oh, this is bad or this is good.

29:10.820 --> 29:15.040
But I thought it was interesting that a character finally kind of does something about that.

29:15.040 --> 29:16.040
Come on.

29:16.040 --> 29:17.040
Y'all have done it.

29:17.040 --> 29:20.900
You've zoomed in on the crotch and the character creator mode or the or the boobies or the

29:20.900 --> 29:21.900
butt or something.

29:21.900 --> 29:22.900
Never, never, ever.

29:22.900 --> 29:25.660
I'm not really interested in any of it.

29:25.660 --> 29:26.660
All right.

29:26.660 --> 29:27.660
Well, fair.

29:27.660 --> 29:30.260
I want my character to like look a specific way when I make one.

29:30.260 --> 29:36.500
So although I do think that the Conan one was just hilarious.

29:36.500 --> 29:41.300
Questmaster says the combat stuff resembles what we've seen in ground zeros and Phantom

29:41.300 --> 29:42.700
pain a bit.

29:42.700 --> 29:46.900
And dark to see you says it, that footage is in part of day two when they're talking

29:46.900 --> 29:48.180
about the safe house.

29:48.180 --> 29:52.060
So I guess I could see more context of that outside the gift if I want to.

29:52.060 --> 29:56.060
So those are two of the big games we've got huge updates on fantasy seven remake and death

29:56.060 --> 29:57.060
stranding.

29:57.460 --> 30:00.620
So, um, yeah, cause the Nintendo direct was last week.

30:00.620 --> 30:01.620
We talked all about that.

30:01.620 --> 30:02.620
Yeah.

30:02.620 --> 30:03.620
Would you have a little more on Nintendo?

30:03.620 --> 30:04.620
We'll get to that a little later in the show.

30:04.620 --> 30:07.660
I'm sure you see it over there on the sidebar, but first before we get into all that, we're

30:07.660 --> 30:11.060
gonna talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing

30:11.060 --> 30:12.060
this week.

30:12.060 --> 30:13.860
Uh, so dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

30:13.860 --> 30:21.460
I simmed, I've decided to now that I actually got the new expansion, the magic, whatever

30:21.460 --> 30:22.460
they called it.

30:22.460 --> 30:24.980
I don't remember the name of it, but it just has magic.

30:24.980 --> 30:30.180
So I'm going to make a special, I'm inspired by the show called being human, which I didn't

30:30.180 --> 30:31.180
watch the U S one.

30:31.180 --> 30:32.180
I watched a little bit.

30:32.180 --> 30:33.620
It was shitty, but the British one was great.

30:33.620 --> 30:37.780
And on the British show, it's a vampire or werewolf and a ghost that all live in a flat

30:37.780 --> 30:38.780
together.

30:38.780 --> 30:46.420
Um, it's really a lot more serious than that, but, um, I'm going to have a vampire, a witch

30:46.420 --> 30:50.900
and a ghost live in a house together and it's going to be amazing.

30:50.900 --> 30:54.180
Do do do do snap, snap, do do do do do.

30:54.180 --> 30:57.340
Well, I've already decided cause I have the cheats ready to do the ghost the way I want

30:57.340 --> 30:58.340
them to.

30:58.340 --> 31:03.820
Cause you know, whenever you have a ghost in the Sims, what they do to the household

31:03.820 --> 31:06.620
depends on how they died.

31:06.620 --> 31:13.820
I have decided that I am going to have one die by and no drowning is no, I'm going to

31:13.820 --> 31:20.540
have one die in the sauna because if they die of relaxation, they actually absorb puddles.

31:20.540 --> 31:27.720
So I won't have to do like any puddle cleaning when the toilet breaks, I'm planning ahead.

31:27.720 --> 31:28.720
This is you.

31:28.720 --> 31:29.720
This is dark.

31:29.720 --> 31:30.720
This is very dark.

31:30.720 --> 31:34.740
Well, I also, one of my favorite Halloween, one of my favorite YouTubers is, um, James

31:34.740 --> 31:35.740
from the Sims supply.

31:35.740 --> 31:39.860
He's just really fun to watch, but I watched a video that I had, I'd seen it and I passed

31:39.860 --> 31:44.900
it and passed and passed over, but he did one about how Sims die and I was like, Oh,

31:44.900 --> 31:46.500
Oh, ideas.

31:46.500 --> 31:51.180
And so I'm gonna, it's probably, what's going to be my first series of streaming when I

31:51.180 --> 31:55.660
get going is making my Sim family and cheating the fuck out of it and building their house

31:55.660 --> 31:56.780
and doing all of that.

31:56.780 --> 32:02.940
So y'all get to watch me some stuff until a particular dating Sim comes out that I already

32:02.940 --> 32:04.900
have on my wishlist on steam.

32:04.900 --> 32:05.900
It's free.

32:05.900 --> 32:06.900
Sounds good.

32:06.900 --> 32:07.900
All right.

32:07.900 --> 32:08.900
Moving on.

32:08.900 --> 32:09.900
Loki, how was your gaming week?

32:09.900 --> 32:14.660
I played a Borderlands three this week, so yeah, I forgot that actually came out.

32:14.660 --> 32:16.420
So I played a little bit of that.

32:16.420 --> 32:24.140
Um, so I'm playing as, uh, Zane and it's a good sport lens.

32:24.140 --> 32:25.740
What are you playing on a PC or console or what?

32:25.740 --> 32:26.740
PC.

32:26.740 --> 32:27.740
Yeah.

32:27.740 --> 32:28.740
Oh, okay.

32:28.740 --> 32:29.740
Oh, so you ponied up the money for the Epic store.

32:29.740 --> 32:30.740
I know.

32:30.740 --> 32:34.380
And I did the, uh, special edition with the, um, the DLC.

32:34.380 --> 32:36.700
I know some people, some people still not happy with the Epic thing.

32:36.700 --> 32:40.260
In fact, uh, Bobby referred to it on his show as the six month beta test on PC.

32:40.260 --> 32:42.020
Well, I get it.

32:42.020 --> 32:47.220
They don't, they don't have the prepaid cards like steam does, and it's a deal breaker for

32:47.220 --> 32:48.220
me too, honestly.

32:48.220 --> 32:50.140
But I would just get Borderlands three on console.

32:50.140 --> 32:54.500
Um, but they don't have the prepaid cards and I don't kind of don't trust Epic with

32:54.500 --> 32:56.660
my credit card because Epic's been hacked already.

32:56.660 --> 33:00.820
Like I've, I've had my account hacked on there and it's like, I don't exactly like, I'm not

33:00.820 --> 33:02.820
an idiot when it comes to password security.

33:02.820 --> 33:07.060
So, and I don't think Epic has two FA don't have anything I care about.

33:07.060 --> 33:10.620
Well, I, I would actually love to get, um, Tetris effect on PC.

33:10.620 --> 33:13.060
I think I would double dip on that game just cause I'm crazy.

33:13.060 --> 33:17.620
Um, especially if they do like a, but yeah, like the number one thing Epic needs to get

33:17.620 --> 33:22.180
on is having those prepaid cards so that I don't have to give them my credit card number

33:22.180 --> 33:24.660
like or can you do PayPal yet?

33:24.660 --> 33:25.660
You can do PayPal.

33:25.660 --> 33:29.260
I might, I might be okay with that because then it's going through third party.

33:29.260 --> 33:33.700
The thing is about the PayPal stuff though is it seems to just, once you've authorized

33:33.700 --> 33:38.100
it, it just goes through without having to put your password in, which I don't necessarily

33:38.100 --> 33:40.540
like, but that could be a PayPal thing.

33:40.540 --> 33:44.800
Um, and Bobby in chat says they do have two factor authentication.

33:44.800 --> 33:46.180
I didn't realize that.

33:46.180 --> 33:47.300
So that'll, that's on me.

33:47.300 --> 33:51.400
I do try to do two FA on everything and I really encourage you guys to as well.

33:51.400 --> 33:55.380
If you have a cell phone, get that two factor auth, especially on the two most important

33:55.380 --> 33:57.860
things, your email account and your banking.

33:57.860 --> 34:00.620
Get those locked down because those are the things you can never have hacked.

34:00.620 --> 34:04.260
Uh, Bobby says, I trust them less with my PayPal because it goes directly from my bank.

34:04.260 --> 34:07.300
Yeah, but don't, wouldn't you have to like log into PayPal every time to do it.

34:07.300 --> 34:10.500
So it's not, you know, this time, no, it just, it, it just does it.

34:10.700 --> 34:11.940
Oh, okay.

34:11.940 --> 34:12.540
I don't like that.

34:12.540 --> 34:13.740
I thought you had to log it.

34:13.740 --> 34:17.820
Like it's, it's like, uh, when I've paid some bills on like, okay, so like the way I used

34:17.820 --> 34:21.820
to pay for VOG, when it was a radio feed, I would go to PayPal, like I would go to their

34:21.820 --> 34:22.660
site, it would be a link.

34:22.660 --> 34:23.940
It would send me to PayPal.

34:24.020 --> 34:24.740
I log into PayPal.

34:24.740 --> 34:28.820
And then when I pay, PayPal sends a message back saying, Rob paid this much money.

34:28.900 --> 34:29.900
So it's not like that.

34:29.940 --> 34:31.280
It's like built in.

34:31.300 --> 34:34.020
So you're, cause that was like, you felt like you were going through a third party

34:34.020 --> 34:35.260
completely does the same thing.

34:35.420 --> 34:37.820
Oh, interesting.

34:38.100 --> 34:46.740
I have to say that I've set up my Apple card on a few things now because, um, all number

34:46.740 --> 34:50.660
one, my card doesn't have a number that's public.

34:51.620 --> 34:56.780
Um, so anything that's been taking, um, Apple pay, I've been able to do everything through

34:56.780 --> 34:57.340
Apple pay.

34:57.420 --> 35:02.020
Yeah, but I still feel like Apple card, MasterCard, Visa, either way, you're putting

35:02.020 --> 35:02.780
yourself at risk.

35:02.820 --> 35:03.100
Nope.

35:03.140 --> 35:08.100
But the other thing on it too, is that if you have, you know, with an iPhone, your control

35:08.100 --> 35:12.580
of the card goes into your iPhone, you get an immediate notice anytime there's a

35:12.580 --> 35:15.860
transaction down to subscription transactions.

35:15.900 --> 35:21.780
To be fair, my, I don't want to plug my bank cause they're not paying me to, um, but my

35:21.780 --> 35:24.740
bank will also send me an alert that I can set.

35:24.740 --> 35:27.620
If it's over X amount of dollars, it will send a push message to my phone.

35:27.620 --> 35:29.940
So there's a site, my bank will do that too.

35:29.940 --> 35:31.260
I just like that for anything.

35:31.260 --> 35:32.740
So there's a site out there.

35:32.940 --> 35:34.420
Um, wait, hold on.

35:35.260 --> 35:39.780
Well, and on top of that, I get, um, it'll actually divide up my transactions based on

35:39.780 --> 35:41.260
what type of transaction it was.

35:41.540 --> 35:44.140
So it also is like budgeting and the usual stuff.

35:44.620 --> 35:49.340
I don't mind getting money back, but not that I'm doing an advertisement for it, but I've

35:49.340 --> 35:51.380
found the security has been really top notch on it.

35:51.420 --> 35:54.180
You're not the only one I've heard that cause that's like a new thing that was just in the

35:54.180 --> 35:54.900
past two or three weeks.

35:54.900 --> 35:57.140
And my card is like legit titanium.

35:57.380 --> 35:58.940
I've, I've heard it's metal.

35:58.980 --> 36:01.220
You're not the only one I've heard kind of dipping their finger in the waters of

36:01.220 --> 36:03.100
that, you know, kind of new, new thing.

36:03.260 --> 36:07.500
So, um, you want to add, I was going to say they have a site called privacy.com that you

36:07.500 --> 36:12.020
can set up virtual credit cards with certain limits on them so you can actually add money

36:12.020 --> 36:12.340
to them.

36:12.340 --> 36:16.060
So for example, say you want to do, you know, trials at different, I don't think you want

36:16.060 --> 36:16.780
to put that on cam.

36:18.220 --> 36:19.060
Oh yeah, that's right.

36:19.060 --> 36:19.740
They don't have a number.

36:19.780 --> 36:20.220
Okay.

36:20.620 --> 36:21.980
You, you better think extra care.

36:22.020 --> 36:22.460
All right.

36:22.500 --> 36:22.900
All right.

36:22.900 --> 36:23.300
There you go.

36:23.580 --> 36:23.940
Okay.

36:24.620 --> 36:27.260
I was, I would never put that on cam, but all right.

36:29.460 --> 36:31.180
Yeah, no, they, they, they're sleek looking.

36:31.180 --> 36:34.700
Things, which is very typical of Apple, but you know, anyway.

36:35.140 --> 36:36.540
Um, let's see what I want to say.

36:36.580 --> 36:38.900
Uh, but did you do, uh, Bobby?

36:38.940 --> 36:39.580
Oh, I'm sorry.

36:39.580 --> 36:42.300
Actually this, uh, rip cycle had this other good comment here.

36:42.300 --> 36:47.500
I thought it was, um, worth noting is that, um, my bank gets spooked by repeated

36:47.500 --> 36:48.340
transactions.

36:48.340 --> 36:49.300
Wish they had a cart.

36:49.340 --> 36:50.220
I forgot about that too.

36:50.220 --> 36:51.300
Epic game store.

36:51.580 --> 36:54.500
Does it like you have to keep buying one at a time, basically.

36:54.540 --> 36:54.820
Yeah.

36:54.820 --> 36:56.140
You can't just put everything in a cart.

36:56.140 --> 36:57.180
That seems very silly.

36:57.540 --> 37:02.060
So anyway, um, what else do we want to talk about with your gaming week?

37:02.100 --> 37:02.500
Loki.

37:02.660 --> 37:05.060
Oh, I worked, I worked on my stuff as well.

37:05.060 --> 37:09.980
So I worked on my game and then, uh, pizza's fine.

37:10.300 --> 37:16.620
Uh, but so I worked on that and they played a little Pokemon go.

37:17.340 --> 37:20.340
That's pretty much it, but I had to take a break for border lands

37:20.340 --> 37:21.540
because you know, it's for Lance.

37:21.860 --> 37:25.380
I'm hearing there was a comment or something I saw on Twitter that

37:25.380 --> 37:28.220
they've gearbox has commented that it's doing very well.

37:28.260 --> 37:31.260
They're very happy with how, you know, despite this fact that some

37:31.260 --> 37:34.660
people are, you know, a little huffy about the lack of availability

37:34.660 --> 37:38.260
anywhere else on PC, but the Epic store, it seems to be doing very well.

37:38.260 --> 37:42.140
And again, like I, if I decide to get in on it, I'll just get it on console.

37:42.180 --> 37:42.700
Fine.

37:42.700 --> 37:46.660
Because, you know, it's just like any of the other border land stuff, you know,

37:46.700 --> 37:50.580
they'll, it'll go on a deep discount sometime in the future during a steam

37:50.580 --> 37:54.660
sale, just buy it again, buy it again on the PlayStation story.

37:54.980 --> 37:55.980
It's fine.

37:56.100 --> 37:58.860
And whatever, you know, I'm fine with it.

37:59.820 --> 38:02.060
Um, Bobby's telling us about the, the review.

38:02.060 --> 38:02.940
And I heard about this too.

38:02.940 --> 38:03.780
I thought this was weird.

38:04.340 --> 38:07.500
One of the interesting things that two K did with border lands three is that

38:07.500 --> 38:09.620
they're not providing an Epic store code.

38:09.860 --> 38:12.540
They were providing a separate account with the game.

38:13.060 --> 38:13.340
Yeah.

38:13.340 --> 38:16.740
And apparently had really early builds on it, which is stupid because, and

38:16.740 --> 38:19.820
then they, they were telling people not to mention certain bugs in the

38:19.820 --> 38:21.140
game because those are going to be fixed.

38:21.420 --> 38:23.860
So then they gives you the impression of, well, it's like, well, I don't

38:23.860 --> 38:26.380
know which bugs I can mention, you know, it could be just something that

38:26.380 --> 38:29.140
they're going to fix and, and then it just kind of skews her.

38:29.620 --> 38:31.140
I wouldn't have played along with that.

38:31.140 --> 38:34.220
I would've said I ran across these bugs, but they said that some of

38:34.220 --> 38:35.500
these will be fixed by launch.

38:35.580 --> 38:37.820
So we'll, we'll update our review at launch.

38:37.820 --> 38:42.420
Like, I really wish reviewers would not play into those hands.

38:43.300 --> 38:45.940
But yeah, I, there's nothing I can do about that.

38:46.220 --> 38:47.500
So, all right.

38:47.700 --> 38:48.820
Anyway, that's it for your game week.

38:49.100 --> 38:52.500
Um, I was, I was out for training for my new job all week.

38:52.500 --> 38:56.140
So I didn't, I wasn't really at home game to play a lot of stuff, but I've been

38:56.140 --> 38:58.020
continuing to play world of Warcraft classic.

38:58.140 --> 39:02.180
Um, I caught my priest up to level 14, which is like the equivalent of like

39:02.180 --> 39:04.140
end game in a lot of MMOs today.

39:04.140 --> 39:04.900
It takes a lot of work.

39:05.140 --> 39:07.620
So I've been playing that I've also been playing ironically, final fantasy

39:07.620 --> 39:12.980
14, uh, still playing that, uh, taking my, um, gunbreaker up a few more levels.

39:12.980 --> 39:14.700
I'm almost a level 70 on my gunbreaker.

39:14.700 --> 39:16.580
That's a lot of fun to play as a tank actually.

39:16.860 --> 39:18.660
Um, otherwise I had my switch with me.

39:18.980 --> 39:23.180
I could not get on the hotel wifi, which really bothered me because I wanted to

39:23.180 --> 39:27.540
work on my Diablo three seasonal character on switch because for the first time I'm

39:27.540 --> 39:31.780
finally playing a necromancer because after all this time, I still don't have

39:31.780 --> 39:36.420
necromancer on the PC and as much as I love Diablo three, do you guys remember I

39:36.420 --> 39:39.740
said I wasn't going to get it because I was pissed off that they didn't do a legit

39:39.740 --> 39:43.340
expansion and they were just like, it was a money grab, so I never bought it.

39:43.420 --> 39:47.540
And to this day I still haven't, but when I did get the switch version, so yes, I

39:47.540 --> 39:51.100
bought another version, so maybe I'm not really helping, but when I bought the

39:51.100 --> 39:54.740
switch version, which I still enjoy that version, it did come with the necromancer

39:54.740 --> 39:55.700
just kind of like built in.

39:55.700 --> 39:57.820
So that's, that was my first chance.

39:57.820 --> 40:01.260
Finally getting to play that class, uh, in three anyway, as opposed to two.

40:01.460 --> 40:05.300
So, um, yeah, but sadly the hotel internet didn't work, so I couldn't do very much

40:05.300 --> 40:05.740
with that.

40:05.940 --> 40:09.220
Um, but I was still able to play some Mario maker and some of the super Nintendo

40:09.220 --> 40:11.220
catalog because you know, all those games came out.

40:11.460 --> 40:15.420
Uh, and yeah, so that was, that was otherwise not a lot of new stuff this

40:15.420 --> 40:18.380
week, but hopefully we'll get on that, uh, in the coming week.

40:18.380 --> 40:21.860
Cause now I'll be at home this week and can jump in on some new games.

40:21.900 --> 40:25.580
Um, I w that's, and if you wondered why I haven't been streaming at all last week,

40:25.580 --> 40:26.980
that's why I w I haven't been home.

40:27.220 --> 40:31.860
So, um, I did, I will mention quickly earlier today, I did go out for Pokemon

40:31.860 --> 40:32.580
community day.

40:32.820 --> 40:37.580
Um, I haven't really been playing Pokemon go a lot at all, but I did today.

40:37.820 --> 40:42.380
I caught like maybe nine shiny turtwigs and I was that today.

40:42.420 --> 40:44.660
Yeah, it was today, uh, from 11 to two this morning.

40:44.660 --> 40:46.700
And I, there was still a lot of people at Capitol.

40:46.740 --> 40:48.540
It's still very popular.

40:48.860 --> 40:53.380
Um, I hatched a shiny Tauros, which, oh yeah, I forgot.

40:53.380 --> 40:55.380
There's like a million shinies in the game all of a sudden.

40:55.380 --> 41:01.140
So I hatched a shiny Tauros and I also hatched a shiny Igglybuff, which I would

41:01.140 --> 41:04.180
have never known was a shiny if it didn't show that little icon.

41:04.180 --> 41:08.700
Cause I swear to God, it looks exactly the same, but yeah, I had, I, I had a shiny

41:08.700 --> 41:10.460
day that even Shane can be proud of.

41:10.460 --> 41:15.260
That was like three different, uh, new Pokemon going in the shiny decks today.

41:15.260 --> 41:15.940
So that was fun.

41:16.300 --> 41:19.340
So, uh, yeah, uh, played a little bit of that.

41:19.980 --> 41:22.700
Um, oh, I guess I can mention the Ingress thing I did yesterday.

41:23.060 --> 41:26.660
Um, I don't talk a lot about Ingress on this show, but I did go to the, they did

41:26.660 --> 41:28.060
a, what's called a field test.

41:28.340 --> 41:31.780
Uh, hex hexathlon was the event they did yesterday.

41:31.780 --> 41:36.100
So, um, myself and one of my Ingress buddies drove over to Santa Clara, uh, to

41:36.100 --> 41:37.340
the university there.

41:37.620 --> 41:42.060
And yes, I know MagWest was right there and I didn't go and I really wanted to,

41:42.060 --> 41:44.500
but I was really only there for a few hours.

41:44.500 --> 41:46.620
We went there, did the thing and came right back.

41:46.900 --> 41:50.340
Um, I just, MagWest is always just, the timing is so terrible.

41:50.340 --> 41:50.860
I feel bad.

41:51.100 --> 41:52.740
But anyway, so we went to Santa Clara.

41:52.740 --> 41:54.900
It was at the university there, which is really pretty.

41:55.180 --> 42:00.340
Um, and, uh, basically you had to do these different events in an hour and a half.

42:00.540 --> 42:05.100
So you had an hour and a half to hack as many portals as you can get as many

42:05.140 --> 42:09.100
glyph points as you can walk as many kilometers as you can deploy as many

42:09.100 --> 42:13.260
resonators as you can and hack artifacts from certain marked portals.

42:13.700 --> 42:17.660
And if you got in the top 10% of a certain category, you got a special metal.

42:17.780 --> 42:19.140
So you got an elite metal.

42:19.300 --> 42:22.580
Well, the really cool thing, finally, in Ingress, you actually could see

42:22.580 --> 42:23.860
your results in real time.

42:24.060 --> 42:25.580
So you could hit a button within the scanner.

42:25.580 --> 42:28.340
It would take you to a separate page cause they've done some new stuff in prime.

42:28.500 --> 42:31.180
They're really trying to, as, as much as the player base has really been

42:31.180 --> 42:34.020
resisting prime, they've been trying to add some new stuff to make it more

42:34.020 --> 42:34.460
attractive.

42:34.460 --> 42:37.340
So one of them was he could go right to this leaderboard and you could see how

42:37.340 --> 42:38.700
you were doing every five minutes.

42:38.980 --> 42:42.820
And within the first 30 minutes of the event, I was like, Oh my God, I'm in the

42:42.820 --> 42:47.380
elite for every single category and number one for glyph app points.

42:47.700 --> 42:50.580
So I just kept, I just kept pushing for the whole thing I would have.

42:50.820 --> 42:56.540
And, uh, I ended up in the elite top 10% in every single category and number one

42:56.540 --> 42:59.940
overall in glyph act points out of 210 registered people.

42:59.940 --> 43:00.380
Nice.

43:00.420 --> 43:02.340
So I was, yeah, it was pretty exciting.

43:02.340 --> 43:04.460
So that was my super nerdy Ingress day.

43:04.460 --> 43:09.020
But, um, I haven't been so fond on Ingress this whole week, cause I

43:09.020 --> 43:10.220
should say something about this.

43:10.900 --> 43:13.100
So they're doing these big anomalies, these live events.

43:13.620 --> 43:18.460
They decided to, with a month's notice, spring it on people that, Oh, um, if you

43:18.460 --> 43:22.220
want a badge for doing the anomaly, you're going to have to pay $13 for the badge,

43:22.500 --> 43:25.540
which for years it's been free.

43:25.820 --> 43:31.100
Like I understand they have to make money and that game is not making nearly the

43:31.100 --> 43:35.340
same levels of money that Pokemon Go and Harry Potter probably are.

43:35.340 --> 43:41.940
But to spring that on your player base, when mostly volunteers are organizing

43:41.940 --> 43:46.980
these events for you with one month's notice is fucking tacky.

43:47.020 --> 43:47.660
I'm sorry.

43:47.780 --> 43:52.580
Like if they wanted to announce earlier this week that in 2020, this was going to

43:52.580 --> 43:54.260
be the new design, then fine.

43:54.300 --> 43:57.820
Then people can decide before they agree to, you know, volunteer and do all this

43:57.820 --> 44:00.980
stuff, they at least will know what the rules are.

44:00.980 --> 44:04.380
But to spring it with a month's notice when the planning started, like probably

44:04.380 --> 44:06.740
five months ago, that was really shitty.

44:07.060 --> 44:11.620
To be fair, they've gone back on it a little bit, but they're still being kind

44:11.620 --> 44:14.540
of stingy when it comes to what they call offsite support.

44:14.860 --> 44:18.940
So sometimes like, um, because there's so many people on the ground, they need

44:18.940 --> 44:23.060
people to watch what's happening on their desktop on Intel and basically tell people

44:23.060 --> 44:26.580
over walkie talkies, okay, ground team two, go to this portal ground team one.

44:26.580 --> 44:27.900
So that's operations, right?

44:28.220 --> 44:32.100
So, um, th those people have always gotten badges because they're, they're working

44:32.100 --> 44:32.660
just as hard.

44:32.660 --> 44:33.500
They're playing the game too.

44:33.500 --> 44:34.780
They're just playing it in a different way.

44:34.980 --> 44:35.380
Right?

44:35.660 --> 44:36.020
Right.

44:36.260 --> 44:39.340
They've decided and they've drawn a hard line there.

44:39.460 --> 44:41.540
If those people want a badge, they have to pay money for it.

44:42.700 --> 44:46.660
So I, I just thought that was a little shitty and Niantic needs to work on their

44:46.660 --> 44:47.460
communications.

44:47.460 --> 44:48.500
Cause that was junky.

44:49.140 --> 44:53.860
Um, but then I went and did the hexathlon anyway.

44:53.860 --> 44:57.580
So, but at least I can say, Hey, I know what I'm talking about with this game.

44:57.580 --> 45:01.260
Cause I performed very well in that hexathlon.

45:01.260 --> 45:03.740
So anyway, uh, that's enough about that game.

45:03.780 --> 45:05.260
Let's get back into some more gaming news.

45:05.260 --> 45:08.780
Cause there's been a lot of gaming news this week to get into not just Tokyo game

45:08.780 --> 45:11.380
show, but other stuff around the world, literally the world, right?

45:11.380 --> 45:11.660
Loki.

45:11.780 --> 45:16.020
Yes, the world and the world's, uh, game here.

45:16.020 --> 45:21.940
So the Olympics, of course, it's been talked about for a while that, you know,

45:22.660 --> 45:25.500
they've been trying to get e-sports into the Olympics.

45:25.740 --> 45:29.460
Um, and now we may be a little bit closer.

45:29.460 --> 45:36.340
So originally, um, there was talks about getting e-sports into the 2020 summer

45:36.380 --> 45:38.260
Olympics in Tokyo, Japan.

45:39.020 --> 45:42.740
Uh, but apparently they're going to have a half a million dollar gaming tournament

45:42.740 --> 45:46.700
hosted with Intel during the lead up to the Olympics.

45:47.140 --> 45:48.860
So it's kind of close, I guess.

45:49.380 --> 45:54.380
Um, they're saying they're going to have online qualifiers, which will be held to

45:54.420 --> 45:57.100
fill out national teams of participating countries.

45:57.580 --> 46:04.180
And then, um, the qualifying events going to be planned in June in Poland, and it's

46:04.180 --> 46:08.260
going to decide who will move on to the official competition in Japan.

46:09.180 --> 46:16.220
And then apparently they're going to, I guess, have this, uh, music hall that

46:16.220 --> 46:17.300
they're going to do this in.

46:17.300 --> 46:23.660
So right before like the start date, um, it's interesting that they're kind of

46:23.900 --> 46:25.300
doing it and coincide with it.

46:25.300 --> 46:27.860
I don't know if it's necessarily going to be something that's going to push them to

46:27.860 --> 46:29.700
put it, make it officially in there.

46:29.860 --> 46:33.220
But I think that wasn't this year that they're adding like a bunch of new, like,

46:33.340 --> 46:35.140
like I want to say like skateboarding.

46:35.420 --> 46:39.780
They do add new events every few years and they take events away too.

46:39.780 --> 46:45.300
I want to say they got rid of something relatively popular and it

46:45.300 --> 46:46.580
was getting heat for it.

46:46.620 --> 46:50.460
Um, I don't want to speak out of turn, but I feel like it was like women's

46:50.460 --> 46:55.700
baseball or something that they got rid of, that they got a lot of shit for.

46:55.700 --> 46:57.180
Please correct me if I'm wrong in chat.

46:57.180 --> 46:59.580
I'm sorry, I don't have the notes in front of me, but I feel like there was

46:59.580 --> 47:01.340
some sport they got rid of that they're getting shit for.

47:01.420 --> 47:02.860
So then they add sports.

47:02.860 --> 47:08.940
So some of these like X games kind of stuff as you know, generation X has

47:08.940 --> 47:11.980
grown up with those types of sports or what, what was it?

47:12.060 --> 47:14.860
Uh, California games was really where all those remember that?

47:14.860 --> 47:16.700
Remember that from the eighties, California games?

47:16.740 --> 47:16.980
Yeah.

47:17.100 --> 47:19.940
Um, I actually Olympic hacky sack against the Olympic hack.

47:19.980 --> 47:23.300
I know a guy that worked on the programming for that game.

47:23.340 --> 47:25.220
I really want to get him on the show at some point.

47:25.220 --> 47:26.460
So we'll, we'll do that in the future though.

47:26.460 --> 47:28.460
He actually was a writer on California games.

47:28.460 --> 47:30.220
So I, anyway, we'll do that in the future.

47:30.460 --> 47:32.020
But anyway, um, but yeah, like all those games.

47:32.020 --> 47:33.740
So I, but it's like skateboarding and stuff.

47:33.780 --> 47:36.180
So that's showing up in the Olympics now.

47:36.300 --> 47:39.740
So they do badminton, I think was a sport they were going to add at some point too.

47:39.860 --> 47:40.980
That's not in there already.

47:41.020 --> 47:42.820
I thought, I thought that was the thing I was hearing.

47:42.820 --> 47:44.860
I don't know if somebody in chat knows, but surprised.

47:45.100 --> 47:45.420
Okay.

47:45.420 --> 47:49.140
Bobby says they got rid of softball and baseball.

47:49.140 --> 47:50.820
They got rid of softball women and base.

47:50.820 --> 47:54.660
So they actually got rid of men's baseball, but they are bringing it back.

47:54.660 --> 47:55.860
Apparently they're bringing back base.

47:55.860 --> 48:00.500
I was going to say you can't have the Tokyo 2020 Olympics without baseball.

48:00.500 --> 48:03.220
I mean, that's, and apparently badminton has been a sport for ages.

48:03.220 --> 48:03.620
I'm sorry.

48:03.620 --> 48:07.220
I can't remember what I was like, I was like, it's like, it's, if it's not a part

48:07.220 --> 48:11.060
of the Olympics now, it's never going to be bad men.

48:11.780 --> 48:12.620
That's super old.

48:13.540 --> 48:14.660
Let's make lawn darts.

48:15.420 --> 48:18.500
Lawn darts is part of a, it will be Olympics.

48:19.180 --> 48:20.260
So I'm sorry, I might've missed it.

48:20.260 --> 48:22.420
Did they say what games are going to be?

48:22.420 --> 48:26.860
I mean, it makes sense that like with the Olympic games being in Tokyo, Japan

48:26.860 --> 48:29.460
is very well known for being part of the video game industry.

48:29.460 --> 48:33.020
So a lot of this makes sense that like, this is the, well, the two that they

48:33.020 --> 48:37.220
were going to do, so they had street fighter five and rocket league as, um, so

48:37.220 --> 48:39.820
each one of those is going to get a quarter million dollar prize pool.

48:40.220 --> 48:43.220
Um, those are the two that they mentioned.

48:43.340 --> 48:51.860
They were saying though, that apparently in the 2022 Asian, Asian games, um, there

48:51.860 --> 48:55.900
was, they also had, um, competitions regarding league, league of legends,

48:55.900 --> 48:58.780
Hearthstone, Starcraft two, among others.

48:58.860 --> 49:02.420
So I don't know that it is tough.

49:02.420 --> 49:06.460
Like, how would you pick which game that you play?

49:07.380 --> 49:08.780
I mean, cause it would be changing almost.

49:08.780 --> 49:12.700
I would imagine each time you go to the Olympics, they're talking like, you

49:12.700 --> 49:14.100
know, several years in between.

49:14.540 --> 49:14.940
Okay.

49:14.940 --> 49:16.060
For what it's worth.

49:16.100 --> 49:19.500
Um, I'm reading a Wikipedia article cause you know, that's the, that's

49:19.500 --> 49:22.380
the source of all the information, but Hey, it's where you go when

49:22.380 --> 49:23.220
you want to know stuff too.

49:23.620 --> 49:27.700
It says in 2013, IOC leaders voted to drop wrestling from the

49:27.700 --> 49:29.780
core program for the 2020 games.

49:30.020 --> 49:31.580
And then that was surprising.

49:31.860 --> 49:35.420
Um, but then later in 2013 in may, it says three of the eight sports under

49:35.420 --> 49:39.100
consideration made the final shortlist, baseball, softball, squash, and wrestling.

49:39.300 --> 49:42.220
Uh, the other five sports were rejected at this point.

49:42.460 --> 49:47.740
Uh, karate, roller sports, sport, climate climbing, wakeboarding, and wushu.

49:48.180 --> 49:50.660
Um, so roller sports, I'm sorry.

49:50.660 --> 49:52.740
Wrestling was chosen to be included.

49:52.780 --> 49:53.260
My bad.

49:53.420 --> 49:57.460
So that was added for 2020 and 2024, but this is like.

49:58.060 --> 50:01.500
Wrestling wrestling, not WWE wrestling.

50:01.540 --> 50:03.980
There is a huge difference just so we're clear.

50:04.220 --> 50:06.420
Well, yeah, this is, this is very different.

50:06.420 --> 50:08.380
This is like, like high school wrestling.

50:08.380 --> 50:08.620
Okay.

50:08.660 --> 50:12.500
Um, so let's see, uh, the games are now an event based program

50:12.500 --> 50:14.020
rather than sport gate based.

50:14.020 --> 50:14.940
That's kind of interesting.

50:15.140 --> 50:19.060
So, um, a list of eight sports was unveiled consisting of baseball, softball,

50:19.060 --> 50:22.900
bowling, karate, roller sports, sport, climbing, squash, surfing, and wushu.

50:23.220 --> 50:25.260
Um, interesting.

50:26.380 --> 50:26.740
Hmm.

50:27.220 --> 50:31.100
I still, I'm still, I wish I, there was just a fricking chart that said, added

50:31.140 --> 50:33.100
these games, removed these games.

50:33.100 --> 50:36.380
That would be a much easier for me to try to look through.

50:36.380 --> 50:37.580
Maybe it's on this Olympic sport.

50:37.580 --> 50:40.060
I'm trying to look, buy me time help.

50:41.740 --> 50:44.340
Um, hi, but video games aren't there.

50:44.340 --> 50:45.180
It's Mario and Sonic.

50:45.220 --> 50:47.820
Oh, they're going to play discontinued sports.

50:47.860 --> 50:48.620
There is a, okay.

50:48.620 --> 50:52.060
I found the list discontinued rugby at one point was cricket.

50:52.300 --> 50:54.340
No longer any limits, equestrian and vaulting.

50:54.900 --> 50:56.620
Um, interesting.

50:57.380 --> 51:02.060
So there is, there's an article on Olympic sports that I guess you can, uh, look up

51:02.060 --> 51:05.340
if you want to know more information on that, um, but I guess there's a

51:05.500 --> 51:07.300
look up if you want to know more information on that.

51:07.540 --> 51:11.620
So, uh, SG 100, Matt says the hosting country gets more sway in terms

51:11.620 --> 51:12.940
of what sports are at the Olympics.

51:13.140 --> 51:16.100
When London got the Olympics, the EU voted out baseball because

51:16.100 --> 51:17.260
it's not that popular there.

51:17.460 --> 51:20.500
Since then the MLB pushed hard to get the games in Europe to

51:20.500 --> 51:21.500
get it back in the Olympics.

51:21.540 --> 51:22.220
Oh, interesting.

51:22.700 --> 51:26.500
Um, Bobby also points out the IOC didn't want any e-sports

51:26.500 --> 51:28.020
games that involved killing.

51:28.260 --> 51:30.860
So no league of legends or counter-strike.

51:30.900 --> 51:31.740
Oh, that's very interesting.

51:31.900 --> 51:36.660
But I mean, even somebody else in chat said like rocket league makes a hell of a

51:36.660 --> 51:43.900
lot of sense as like that game to push this discussion of sports, you know, video

51:43.900 --> 51:47.940
games as an Olympic sport forward, like street fighter, even I have to admit.

51:48.180 --> 51:49.060
Like I, and don't get me wrong.

51:49.100 --> 51:50.100
I love street fighter.

51:50.260 --> 51:51.900
I love street fighter two, I love street fighter four.

51:52.060 --> 51:52.900
Street fighter five is okay.

51:53.180 --> 51:56.180
But I, you know, but I like rocket league.

51:56.420 --> 51:59.020
That one's really going to get people to go, okay.

51:59.020 --> 52:01.260
It's like a little mix of all these different games.

52:01.420 --> 52:02.540
It's not violent.

52:02.700 --> 52:03.860
It's family friendly.

52:04.020 --> 52:08.820
It's a good, it's a good barometer to see how video games can do in the Olympics.

52:09.180 --> 52:09.540
Sure.

52:09.740 --> 52:12.940
Anyways, anyway, so it's still an exhibition of sorts.

52:12.940 --> 52:16.020
It's kind of something running side by side, but who knows, maybe in the future,

52:16.180 --> 52:21.460
I still remember years ago on this show, maybe leading up to the 2004 Olympics, we

52:21.460 --> 52:24.580
were talking about dance, dance revolution becoming an Olympic sport because didn't

52:24.580 --> 52:29.820
one of those Nordic countries, um, decide to recognize DDR as a sport.

52:30.540 --> 52:33.420
And I remember that was a whole discussion in one of the early episodes of OLR.

52:33.420 --> 52:36.060
One of the, I don't even remember which country it was in Switzerland or

52:36.060 --> 52:39.740
something like that, like actually, uh, recognized as a sport.

52:39.780 --> 52:46.380
So anyway, cause you don't chat says in fencing, you pretend to stab a person.

52:46.420 --> 52:47.540
That's in the Olympics.

52:47.940 --> 52:53.820
I remember playing fencing in summer games too, by epics.

52:53.820 --> 52:58.140
The, uh, you know, the, the, the precursor in many ways to, uh, California games,

52:58.300 --> 53:00.660
there was summer games, there was winter games or some games too.

53:00.860 --> 53:02.420
Fencing was in that and it was a lot of fun.

53:02.580 --> 53:07.580
And then, do you know, when I saw fencing again in, uh, that James Bond movie with

53:07.580 --> 53:09.580
Madonna, cause she was the fencing instructor.

53:09.700 --> 53:10.460
Oh, that's right.

53:10.660 --> 53:17.700
Cause so, so fencing is a very James Bond type of thing to me, like fencing, we're

53:17.700 --> 53:22.460
going to go down to the yacht club and do some fencing today, posh posh, like it's

53:22.460 --> 53:26.820
just, it's something posh by does in her spare time, it's not something for normal

53:26.820 --> 53:27.340
people.

53:27.980 --> 53:28.340
All right.

53:28.340 --> 53:28.740
Anyway.

53:29.620 --> 53:29.860
All right.

53:29.860 --> 53:30.460
Let's move on.

53:30.500 --> 53:34.300
Uh, let's talk about, let's talk about that Nintendo fitness, right?

53:34.300 --> 53:37.580
Remember last week we saw the band, right?

53:37.580 --> 53:41.700
So we saw that whole fitness device and this week we got a little more information

53:41.700 --> 53:42.980
on what it is.

53:43.220 --> 53:46.860
You know, I, you know what I started calling it because it's a device and you

53:46.860 --> 53:48.140
can strap it onto your leg.

53:48.180 --> 53:49.740
I've been calling it the Nintendo strap on.

53:50.180 --> 53:54.140
So of course you have, can I, can I continue to call it that for the purposes

53:54.140 --> 53:54.580
of this show?

53:54.620 --> 53:55.540
Well, y'all know what I'm talking about.

53:55.540 --> 53:57.500
If I talk about the Nintendo strap on.

53:57.980 --> 53:58.340
Okay.

53:58.380 --> 53:58.660
All right.

53:58.660 --> 54:03.180
So anyway, uh, so the Nintendo's new fitness game was unveiled and the game is

54:03.180 --> 54:05.380
going to be called ring fit adventure.

54:05.660 --> 54:09.540
You strap on the joy con onto your leg and then you use the ring thing.

54:09.740 --> 54:13.100
And then there's a whole little trail trailer that actually showed it's kind of

54:13.100 --> 54:14.820
like a legit RPG.

54:15.140 --> 54:21.220
And it makes me think of, do you remember in the three DS, how those me pass the

54:21.220 --> 54:24.860
street pass games and there was the one, Oh, dark soccer helped me out here.

54:24.860 --> 54:26.820
Cause you and I used to trade me's all the time.

54:27.020 --> 54:29.380
And it was that adventure game where you would, you were saving.

54:30.580 --> 54:31.260
Yeah.

54:31.260 --> 54:35.620
And you like had different like abilities as you level through it.

54:35.660 --> 54:38.740
And like depending on the colors of the shirts that people were wearing and they

54:38.740 --> 54:39.660
were black all the time.

54:39.700 --> 54:40.420
Yes, exactly.

54:40.420 --> 54:41.020
Find me.

54:41.020 --> 54:41.380
Thank you.

54:41.380 --> 54:42.180
Thank you chat.

54:42.460 --> 54:46.660
So, uh, find me, uh, was the, uh, uh, name of that game.

54:46.900 --> 54:49.380
It kind of, I don't know, like with the arts on everything kind of reminded me

54:49.420 --> 54:51.220
that, although obviously there's a little more to it.

54:51.220 --> 54:52.740
Cause find me was very, very basic.

54:52.740 --> 54:55.980
It was super basic, but let's talk a little bit before we talk about the game,

54:55.980 --> 55:00.420
about the presentation, because what was up with that creepy ass dude?

55:00.820 --> 55:05.100
Like fucking just like channeling Dennis from it's always sunny.

55:05.100 --> 55:07.180
I swear to God, was she in danger?

55:07.340 --> 55:08.900
Cause it looked like she was in danger.

55:08.900 --> 55:11.500
It was getting his Jewish, like, what can you do?

55:11.540 --> 55:12.020
All right.

55:12.260 --> 55:16.620
Um, anyway, so if you want to move your character, you can actually jog or walk.

55:16.860 --> 55:19.460
And then the ring con is what it's called.

55:19.460 --> 55:22.380
So, you know, that looks like a little like hula hoop type of thing.

55:22.380 --> 55:26.100
I don't know the ring con, uh, you actually interact with objects.

55:26.180 --> 55:30.860
So you don't fight battles with magic, but you might do squats in

55:30.860 --> 55:33.260
order to do cast a magic spell.

55:33.260 --> 55:36.420
So it's, you know, it's gamifying exercise.

55:36.460 --> 55:39.620
Well, when I saw that they were doing that, it's like, uh, doing like a bow

55:39.620 --> 55:42.260
and arrow, like you pulled it back like a, a bow that was kind of cool.

55:42.820 --> 55:46.340
So anyway, uh, so if you want your Nintendo ring con and strap

55:46.340 --> 55:50.460
on, uh, it goes on sale on October 18th is the big day, $80.

55:50.780 --> 55:51.500
Um, I don't know.

55:51.500 --> 55:52.260
I might get it.

55:52.300 --> 55:55.540
I'm all about like extra fit exercise gaming type of stuff.

55:55.540 --> 55:56.300
Like why not?

55:56.460 --> 55:57.380
What's another one?

55:57.900 --> 55:58.420
Why not?

55:58.420 --> 56:00.180
I got, we fit and all that stuff.

56:00.180 --> 56:00.900
What's another one.

56:01.700 --> 56:02.140
Yes.

56:02.140 --> 56:04.940
I'm going to buy, I'm going to buy the Nintendo strap on.

56:06.540 --> 56:08.100
Whereas it looks like an idiot.

56:08.140 --> 56:11.860
I just don't want to buy more peripherals for the goddamn switch.

56:12.540 --> 56:16.940
I have like, I have you buy the cardboard ship for your kids and we

56:16.940 --> 56:18.820
haven't used it in like months.

56:18.860 --> 56:20.340
It was a waste of money.

56:20.380 --> 56:22.580
Why did I even buy that crap?

56:22.620 --> 56:23.900
Cause you wanted to see VR.

56:23.940 --> 56:29.260
It was fun to build it, but like it was like in the VR is okay, but

56:29.260 --> 56:32.220
it's such a like minimal thing.

56:32.220 --> 56:33.780
It's just, I don't know.

56:33.780 --> 56:36.220
There's like not really much to it.

56:37.900 --> 56:40.060
And it takes up a ton of fucking space.

56:40.300 --> 56:43.540
Uh, so look, folks in chat are, are, are hype.

56:43.580 --> 56:46.940
SSU 100 Matt says my girlfriend and I have already decided to go halves on this.

56:47.140 --> 56:50.100
Bobby Black Wolf said my wife already has this pre-ordered

56:50.140 --> 56:52.100
along with buying another doc.

56:52.340 --> 56:55.140
I remember this cause they have like a fitness type area.

56:55.140 --> 56:56.780
So, so wife gets a doc.

56:56.780 --> 56:59.020
I'm going to tell you right now, I'm just going to wait for these to be

56:59.020 --> 57:02.860
like piled up in Goodwill at some point because good, not going to

57:02.860 --> 57:06.620
happen for a little bit because, because you know that Nintendo and

57:06.620 --> 57:09.020
hardware is always a losing proposition.

57:09.020 --> 57:12.500
So these things are going to be scarce on shelves because Nintendo

57:12.500 --> 57:14.300
never makes enough of these things.

57:14.300 --> 57:17.460
And the strap-ons are going to be in huge demand because that is what

57:17.460 --> 57:21.020
happens when Nintendo products, every single goddamn time they

57:21.020 --> 57:22.300
come out there on that shelf.

57:22.340 --> 57:26.420
It's a piece of the audience is like, Oh, Nintendo, it's so beautiful.

57:26.420 --> 57:27.940
You've put out another device.

57:27.940 --> 57:28.980
I have to own it.

57:30.500 --> 57:33.420
Nintendo could go out there wearing a fucking strap on and

57:33.420 --> 57:34.540
the people would still buy it.

57:35.340 --> 57:38.460
I'm probably not going to get that or many new games.

57:38.460 --> 57:40.940
I'll be honest, other than the ones that are on my list, cause I do

57:40.940 --> 57:46.820
have a unhealthy backlog and legit, a room full of games I'm not playing.

57:46.820 --> 57:49.500
And I have DDR for a bunch of things.

57:49.500 --> 57:53.300
If I want to exercise while I'm playing, I've got other things.

57:53.580 --> 57:56.620
So sort of like, it's just the money grab.

57:56.820 --> 57:58.940
I need something to encourage me to do sit-ups.

57:58.940 --> 58:01.700
And since I can't like dark soccer, doesn't call me on a regular

58:01.700 --> 58:03.620
basis to go wrap sit-ups.

58:03.660 --> 58:08.020
So I saw this because I'm in a few different DDR communities

58:08.020 --> 58:11.620
in Facebook and they have one for our, you know, if you own arcade

58:11.620 --> 58:15.140
cabinets, um, and someone took one of their DDR cabinets, because

58:15.140 --> 58:17.780
now MAME does support DDR and it runs at a full speed.

58:18.180 --> 58:22.140
So they have, um, Hyper spin on it.

58:22.140 --> 58:26.180
The front end that I was using for my, um, MAME cabinets and stuff like

58:26.180 --> 58:30.780
that to select all the different official versions of DDR to play

58:30.780 --> 58:34.260
them on your cabinet, using everything and step mania.

58:34.260 --> 58:35.940
I'm like, Ooh, I'm doing that.

58:36.500 --> 58:37.340
I'm doing that.

58:37.380 --> 58:37.580
Okay.

58:37.660 --> 58:38.620
So you've got, that's true.

58:38.620 --> 58:40.140
You have a DDR machine in your house.

58:40.140 --> 58:41.980
You've got your fitness routine down pat.

58:42.420 --> 58:45.140
I don't, you know, we have a gym membership.

58:45.140 --> 58:50.060
I was using until I decided to like, okay, like here's what every time I

58:50.060 --> 58:53.580
saw like the footage that they're showing while it looks neat and stuff.

58:53.660 --> 58:57.100
It reminds me of like the connect fitness games that they have or the

58:57.100 --> 58:59.300
connect adventures type thing.

58:59.340 --> 59:03.340
And it's going to be fun for a while and you're going to get bored

59:03.340 --> 59:05.300
with it really fast is what I think.

59:05.300 --> 59:07.580
And then you're stuck with this fucking peripheral that doesn't

59:07.580 --> 59:08.900
do anything in any other game.

59:09.460 --> 59:10.620
And that's my worry.

59:10.940 --> 59:14.340
So that's why I'm just going to wait for the deep discount because people

59:14.340 --> 59:18.020
are going to get bored with it really fast and then I'll pick it up.

59:18.660 --> 59:20.940
And I just, I do want to send my love to those in the chat room.

59:20.940 --> 59:21.980
They got my reference.

59:22.780 --> 59:24.860
Nintendo, your smile is beautiful.

59:24.860 --> 59:25.940
Did you stone that ring?

59:25.980 --> 59:26.220
All right.

59:26.220 --> 59:28.260
Anyway, uh, let's move on.

59:28.620 --> 59:30.300
Meanwhile, Loki's like, I don't get it.

59:31.460 --> 59:32.100
I don't.

59:32.220 --> 59:32.740
It's fine.

59:32.900 --> 59:33.580
That's all right.

59:34.380 --> 59:35.740
Some things you don't have to.

59:35.740 --> 59:39.580
Sometimes I speak a language that you can't hear and it's okay.

59:40.980 --> 59:43.180
Anyway, moving on dark soccer.

59:43.180 --> 59:44.500
Why don't you bring down the mood?

59:44.740 --> 59:47.380
How about some game stop?

59:48.380 --> 59:51.700
I know people like to call it the evil G, but man, they are suffering.

59:52.140 --> 59:59.460
So, um, yeah, they're planning on closing about 180 to 200 poorly performing stores

59:59.460 --> 01:00:05.580
by the end of the fiscal year and that's added to the 195 stores that already closed.

01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:10.700
Um, this, uh, was announced during an earnings conference call.

01:00:10.700 --> 01:00:14.780
There's no list of which stores are included in that right now.

01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:18.020
They have over 5,700 stores in 14 countries.

01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:27.620
Um, they said that basically, um, they're expecting that a lot of their, uh, in, in

01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:33.540
store sales to fall, uh, like a five to 10% dip in earnings.

01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:40.220
And, uh, it's pretty much looking like they are, they're on their way out.

01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:44.020
They've lost over 415 million in their last quarter.

01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:49.060
You need to carry less vinyl figures because there's a lot of like over a

01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:54.020
hundred dollar vinyl figures in those stores and no kids size shirts, not the

01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:54.540
pop fakes.

01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:57.100
Those are fine because those are like cheap.

01:00:57.220 --> 01:01:02.860
I'm talking like the Japanese anime, like busty, scantily clad, like figures that

01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:04.540
they have there that are just cluttering.

01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:05.940
I usually don't notice those, but yeah.

01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:11.780
Um, but like they don't have kids size shirts, which seems like a big mistake to

01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:15.340
me because you have kids going into the store buying stuff.

01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:20.140
You have Ryan's world toys there, but you don't have like kids size t-shirts.

01:01:20.140 --> 01:01:22.620
It's all adult size t-shirts, which is really weird.

01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:23.940
Here's the thing.

01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:28.540
I don't want to like shit on GameStop too much because the people that are really

01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:33.300
being impacted by this and the stores closing are those retail workers.

01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:38.140
Most of them making minimum wage and most of them pretty decent kids and adults

01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:40.340
trying to just make some bucks.

01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:43.260
Now, if you're one of those people that uses your GameStop job to go on a power

01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:47.260
trip, as I think we've all run into that employee once in a while, then, you know,

01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:54.220
buy, buy bitch, you know, but for the most, I would say a good 96% of people that

01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:56.420
are working in the stores are just trying to make an honest living.

01:01:56.420 --> 01:02:00.900
And for them, I feel bad and I don't want to bring on the snark too much, but I do

01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:03.700
feel like a lot of us are sitting here going, well, we've kind of seen this

01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:06.980
coming because GameStops are everywhere.

01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:09.020
They are a bit saturated.

01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:10.340
It's the same thing that happened with Subway.

01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:16.380
They had a massive expansion and then a whole bunch of markets shifted over and

01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:21.180
like Subway had this thing where they had like in some places, almost like how

01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:22.380
Starbucks is spread out.

01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:27.460
And but because they were all franchise stores, they weren't getting enough money

01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:28.580
to keep one of them open yet.

01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:30.100
They still had to pay their franchise fees.

01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:33.780
But GameStop, I mean, it is corporate owned and all that, too.

01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:37.940
But they did expand, I think, way too quickly for where the market was headed.

01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:43.940
They did also put a statement on here that more people are turning to digital

01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:49.740
outlets to buy. And so to compete, they're doing a new web platform with a buy

01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:51.260
online pickup in store option.

01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:54.860
Oh, yeah, because that that has worked out really well for Target.

01:02:54.860 --> 01:02:57.060
They say they say Target does the same thing.

01:02:57.060 --> 01:03:00.220
Yeah. Target had a really good quarter.

01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:04.100
And they say that that type of stuff, like the app buying and picking up and that

01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:05.620
stuff is doing like really good.

01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:08.780
Sometimes their prices are cheaper online than they are in the store, which doesn't

01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:09.900
make any goddamn sense.

01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:11.100
But it's a promotion thing.

01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:12.700
They're trying to push the usage of it.

01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:17.260
Well, also, though, even though I'm trying not to give Amazon any more business, Amazon

01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:20.700
recently had this thing where if you purchase something that you want to return, you can

01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:21.940
actually return it to a Kohl's.

01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:25.260
Oh, yeah, I heard about that. I did that just the other day and then Kohl's gave me a

01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:30.860
coupon. I'm like, I will buy another stir fry pan that I don't need and then get they

01:03:30.860 --> 01:03:32.260
give me like a 25 percent off coupon.

01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:36.620
It was weird. So anyway, I hope the people that are going to be losing jobs over this,

01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:40.180
like hopefully they're able to shuffle workers around, like maybe there's some seasonal

01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:43.100
stuff and with school, maybe they can minimize some of that.

01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:48.140
But I'm going to be honest, like where's the executive job loss to match?

01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:52.220
I know they know they have the stuff for the magazine and there was something like where

01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:56.260
the decision makers that made these shitty decisions, where are they at, though?

01:03:56.420 --> 01:04:01.380
This takes me to another point about it, and it's going to come up again because I'm going

01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:04.060
to bring up a point in another story that a friend came across to me.

01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:10.140
But the problem is, is that a lot of times the companies are going to use this as an

01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:15.300
excuse to try to guilt people into loyalty to the business because, oh, but our

01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:16.900
employees are going to lose out on this.

01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:21.780
Don't you care about the minimum wage workers when in reality we need to hold these big

01:04:21.780 --> 01:04:24.220
businesses accountable for their treatment of their employees?

01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:28.900
Like what's going on with well, this is what my beef is with the Amazon, with how they're

01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:34.060
cutting health benefits to their part time employees at Whole Foods.

01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:41.060
You know, this is I have a big problem with just the looser regulations are and the

01:04:41.060 --> 01:04:44.140
terrible lack of ethics in a lot of these companies.

01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:45.380
And it's all going back.

01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:47.860
It's affecting their minimum wage workers.

01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:50.820
It's affecting the people who are at the bottom of the food chain.

01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:56.380
But even though we may feel sorry for them, we have to hold the people in power

01:04:56.380 --> 01:05:02.460
accountable, make them hurt so that they because the companies that are most successful

01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:05.420
that make the best money are the ones who invest in their employees.

01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:09.180
Well, the government should provide health care for everyone, but that's sorry tangent.

01:05:09.180 --> 01:05:14.700
Well, the government also needs to employ more energy efficient light bulbs.

01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:21.300
Anyway, topic change, but I will point out in chat some of the other comments here, some

01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:26.100
folks talking about how She-Hulk says they should have cut back a long time ago as the

01:05:26.100 --> 01:05:28.060
talk of the ThinkGeek merger came up.

01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:31.980
And I know we've talked about that GameStop has kind of evolved their stores a little

01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:35.980
bit because they have seen the digital, you know what that's doing to the more physical

01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:37.860
game sales and that whole thing.

01:05:38.620 --> 01:05:42.020
So we've seen that they try to put more merchandise in their stores such as, I guess,

01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:46.060
the vinyl. They have all sorts of stuff in their T-shirts and they do have they have a

01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:48.420
ton of T-shirts and a lot of them are kind of cool.

01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:50.180
I just wish they weren't polyester.

01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:53.020
But I mean, they're like neat.

01:05:53.020 --> 01:05:55.260
It's becoming more like hot topic every day.

01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:58.020
But they also have a lot of garbage in there.

01:05:58.060 --> 01:06:03.620
It's like I just don't like I was looking for Xbox One controllers the other day and I

01:06:03.620 --> 01:06:05.500
couldn't find any, which was weird.

01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:11.660
I'm assuming they're all behind the counter, though, but it's just I don't know.

01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:13.740
They have like a section for like classic gaming.

01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:15.500
It's such a pitiful looking thing.

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:21.660
It's like a few cartridges and stuff for the Super Nintendo and like a couple of Genesis

01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:23.580
things and like a PlayStation one game.

01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:25.020
It's like, why even have that here?

01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:26.300
There's like nothing in it.

01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:28.620
Let me read one more comment here and then we'll move on.

01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:32.300
Questbuster in chat says their stock shot up earlier this year on news that they were

01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:33.340
looking for a buyer.

01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:36.860
But when no one stepped up, their stock tanked and kept declining since then.

01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:40.980
So we'll see if if, you know, we'll see.

01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:42.100
We'll see where it goes from here.

01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:45.060
But it's it's it's not looking good right now.

01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:45.980
But, you know, who knows?

01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:49.420
Sometimes I'm trying to think of companies that have had like a success when they scaled

01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:53.700
way back and then they kind of started to find their way again.

01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:57.820
Well, I mean, I don't know if this is the best example, but like they say Toys R Us

01:06:57.820 --> 01:07:01.980
is going to make a comeback like that now instead of being these giant stores, Toys

01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:04.580
R Us are going to be more like boutique type of things like KB.

01:07:04.580 --> 01:07:05.700
Yes, I know.

01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:06.900
Funny, right?

01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:09.500
And I guess that is where their strategical direction is.

01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:10.060
But we'll see.

01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:13.660
I'm trying to think of other like big companies, big, big companies that scaled way back and

01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:14.980
have done well as a result.

01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:20.140
I don't know, maybe somebody in chat knows, but anyway, let's move on.

01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:23.060
I don't want to kill too much time because we have lots more news to cover.

01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:24.620
So, Loki, why don't you go to our next story?

01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:27.700
Yeah, so let's talk about Apple Arcade.

01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:31.700
So they arcade they have happy about that.

01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:38.260
The service is launching September 19th for $4.99 a month and you get access to more than

01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:39.260
100 games.

01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:40.260
It's cheaper.

01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:41.260
And I thought it would be.

01:07:41.260 --> 01:07:42.260
That's for sure.

01:07:42.260 --> 01:07:44.420
They had some games that they're showing off.

01:07:44.420 --> 01:07:50.340
It was part of the Rayman Pac-Man, Shantae, Steven Universe and Choo-Choo Rocket games.

01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:51.620
I'm looking forward to Shantae.

01:07:51.620 --> 01:07:56.340
There's a new Square Enix RPG called From the Creators of Bravely Default as well.

01:07:56.340 --> 01:07:59.620
It's coming to that.

01:07:59.620 --> 01:08:05.580
They're saying, though, that along with that, the service is also coming to Apple TV on

01:08:05.580 --> 01:08:12.500
September 30th and Mac OS Catalina in October.

01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:13.500
And what else?

01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:17.100
I might be convinced to do this on Apple TV, like I'm going to be honest, like a lot of

01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:20.980
these games I'm hearing, I'm like, I don't really want to play any of that on my phone.

01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:25.340
But if it's coming to the TV and there's some type of like Bluetooth controller or something,

01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:26.340
I don't know.

01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:27.980
Like, I just don't want to play touch games.

01:08:27.980 --> 01:08:29.460
I don't want to play these games touch.

01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:30.460
What?

01:08:30.460 --> 01:08:35.020
I might be selling my Apple TV to get the 4K one.

01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:37.740
And I have a SteelSeries controller, which I can tell you works beautifully with the

01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:38.740
Apple TV.

01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:39.740
Fun.

01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:40.740
Well, maybe I'd be into that.

01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:41.740
We'll see.

01:08:41.740 --> 01:08:45.540
One game that looks awesome that I want to check out is Exit the Gungeon, which is, of

01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:52.140
course, a follow up to Enter the Gungeon and is a side scroller type game now, but still

01:08:52.140 --> 01:08:53.140
a shooter.

01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:57.460
And they even changed the theme song to Exit the Gungeon, which is great.

01:08:57.460 --> 01:08:58.460
Some other cool stuff.

01:08:58.460 --> 01:09:00.600
So they have a game called Overland.

01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:04.540
It's kind of this apocalyptic road trip game.

01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:09.740
They've got Choo Choo Rocket Universe, Ballistic Baseball.

01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:10.740
What other cool stuff?

01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:18.260
So yeah, the Pac-Man Party Royale, Projection First Light, Rayman Mini, looks like a new

01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:27.380
game, Shantae and the Seven Sirens, Sneaky Sasquatch, and Super Impossible Road.

01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:28.380
Lots of different games.

01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:31.620
I will give it to Apple as much as I'm a little bit like, I don't know what I want to play

01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:36.260
on my phone versus, I will say this, like $4.99 is less than I thought it would be.

01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:39.500
I was for sure thinking it was going to be $9.99.

01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:47.220
And they're not just putting out like a couple things, like their TV service, sorry, but

01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:50.620
there's a lot of like big stuff here.

01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:54.460
And you know, putting the two side by side, I think this arcade stands to do better than

01:09:54.460 --> 01:10:00.660
their TV service, which I don't think is ready for prime time, but that's just my opinion.

01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:01.660
But this looks great.

01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:04.940
Yeah, it does look pretty, it looks decent.

01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:06.540
I don't have any Apple devices.

01:10:06.540 --> 01:10:10.980
So whatever, on purchase, exit the Gungeon whenever that comes out.

01:10:10.980 --> 01:10:13.460
I know, I know you're all about the Gungeon games.

01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:17.060
So when I first heard of exit the Gungeon, I was like, oh, I wonder if they took Loki's

01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:21.420
idea because you kind of did a different twist on the Gungeon theory.

01:10:21.420 --> 01:10:22.420
Oh, yeah.

01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:23.420
Yeah.

01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:24.420
It's funny.

01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:25.420
So.

01:10:25.420 --> 01:10:26.420
All right.

01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:27.420
Anyway.

01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:28.420
Yeah.

01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:30.300
Apple Arcade coming out and that's really sets right around the time the new iPhone

01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:31.300
is coming out.

01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:34.100
Because of course, this is all part of that Apple announcement where what we had a new

01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:39.260
iPhone 11 with the triple triad camera.

01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:40.260
The new watch, right?

01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:41.260
There's a new watch.

01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:42.260
There's the new...

01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:44.620
I feel like they, did they do a new computer?

01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:45.620
I don't know.

01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:50.180
I couldn't, I couldn't, I was in class so I couldn't watch or follow a live blog or

01:10:50.180 --> 01:10:53.260
anything so I had to like get the data dump after the fact.

01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:57.900
So yeah, but I definitely saw that new phone because I don't know, like there was a part

01:10:57.900 --> 01:11:00.340
of me was like, do I really need those three cameras?

01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:03.660
And then when I heard that it lets you take better animal pictures, I was like, yes I

01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:10.060
do.

01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:11.060
Come on.

01:11:11.060 --> 01:11:12.340
You want the smoosh pics too.

01:11:12.340 --> 01:11:14.340
You know you do.

01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:16.860
All right.

01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:20.580
Let's move on and talk about something else to look forward to in the future.

01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:24.860
I don't know if this would be on iPhone or Android, but it's definitely something that'll

01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:28.460
be on the next round of consoles or maybe the current round, maybe the next round.

01:11:28.460 --> 01:11:29.460
I don't know.

01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:31.780
But that is a new Mega Man game.

01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:32.780
That's right.

01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:35.900
Mega Man has confirmed a new Mega Man game is in development.

01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:40.660
And that's great news because, you know, obviously Mega Man 11 came out and we all kind of think

01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:42.820
it did well, but we haven't really had the hard facts to know that.

01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:45.700
I still haven't played that other than the demo.

01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:48.900
Well, you know what, we're getting into the time of year where there's probably gonna

01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:49.900
be a ton of sales.

01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:53.220
If you want to pick up on it, you know, now I still haven't played through 9 or 10 either.

01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:55.860
I wish they'd do another X series.

01:11:55.860 --> 01:12:00.040
Well to be fair, they did not say Mega Man 12 is happening.

01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:02.460
They said another Mega Man title is in development.

01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:04.220
In fact, let's get into the quotes.

01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:08.940
It was an interview with the site 4gamer who asked, what can you tell us about the next

01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:09.940
game to be developed?

01:12:09.940 --> 01:12:13.780
The most recent game, Mega Man 11, was amazing, and we are expecting the revival of the Star

01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:14.780
Force series.

01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:17.860
Personally, I'd like to see the Command Mission saga be brought back.

01:12:17.860 --> 01:12:24.900
And in this interview with producer Kazuhiro Tsuchiya said, I see, there's a lot of titles

01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:27.960
I personally want to work on, but to tell you the truth, the next game to be developed

01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:29.480
has already been decided on.

01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:32.180
I'd just like to keep the specific details hidden for the moment.

01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:34.540
Please wait until we make an announcement.

01:12:34.540 --> 01:12:35.820
Please look forward to it.

01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:39.780
Still, I think that there's no such thing as a spinoff in the Mega Man series.

01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:42.020
Every saga is a main series on its own.

01:12:42.020 --> 01:12:47.380
When speaking of Mega Man, there will always be people who think of X as well as people

01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:49.220
who think of EXE.

01:12:49.220 --> 01:12:54.780
And I think that's why each one's concept of what Mega Man is changes depending on the

01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:55.780
generation.

01:12:55.780 --> 01:12:59.140
For that reason, we don't want to deny any series of its future.

01:12:59.140 --> 01:13:00.140
Legends!

01:13:00.140 --> 01:13:01.540
I want legends, dammit!

01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:06.500
You beat me to it because I was going to say, at this time Kazuhiro Tsuchiya, I would

01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:11.820
like you to please consider three simple words, Mega Man Legends.

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:15.700
Come on, because it'd be way better now that the controls won't suck, right?

01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:16.700
Oh my God.

01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:17.700
But all right, fine.

01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:19.340
If they do an X game, cool.

01:13:19.340 --> 01:13:22.420
But I think it is worth noting, he's not saying Mega Man 12.

01:13:22.420 --> 01:13:26.220
It could be, in fact, he's kind of shifting the conversation to be like, it's probably

01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:27.380
going to be something else.

01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:31.480
Or what was that Sonic game where they had like new Sonic and classic Sonic, let's have

01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:36.640
like X and let's get Mega Man X and regular Mega Man in there.

01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:37.640
I know what you're talking about.

01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:38.640
Sonic Generations.

01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:39.640
That's it, Generations.

01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:40.640
Yeah.

01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:41.640
So like, I want that.

01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:42.640
Let's just take all the different Mega Man types.

01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:44.980
We'll put it all into one game.

01:13:44.980 --> 01:13:48.520
Like he can be a big RPG, open world.

01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:50.140
It's not too much to ask for, right?

01:13:50.140 --> 01:13:52.320
I like the way that Nifty 805 put it.

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:56.960
Category is legends only.

01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:57.960
I like that.

01:13:57.960 --> 01:13:58.960
All right.

01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:03.040
Anyway, a new Mega Man coming soon, dot, dot, dot.

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:04.040
All right.

01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:06.720
Uh, let's move on to the next story, Dark Sakura.

01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:09.000
I think you were referencing this earlier.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.360
Yes, I was.

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:16.480
So in other corporate bullshit, don't you just love that introduction to the story?

01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:19.360
Kickstarter is now even more full of bullshit.

01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:22.960
They fired and actually it's a little bit incorrect because I think they've now fired

01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:29.760
three employees for participating in starting a union, which we've talked before about there

01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:33.200
being a massive need for unions in the video game industry.

01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:39.000
And Kickstarter definitely has like their, you know, hands, arms, feet, and legs somewhere

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.440
attached to the video game industry and not in their own cart.

01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:44.640
Well, and if I remember right, what makes this video game related is that one of the

01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:50.640
people, maybe the first one that was let go was their like video game like liaison.

01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:55.040
And they had, um, like a guy who just started a podcast on it too, cause I follow him on

01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:56.040
Twitter.

01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:58.240
Oh, maybe it was the podcast person actually.

01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:00.640
I knew it was, I knew it was relevant to one of my interests.

01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:03.800
Well, I am so sad to hear that he's never going to be able to get his podcasts off the

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:04.800
ground now.

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:07.520
Actually he's got a new podcast and it's doing pretty well.

01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:11.840
So anyway, um, cause I mean there's other crowdsourcing things out there anyway, but

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:14.360
he's already got name recognition on him.

01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:22.280
So, um, but at any rate, they fired several employees for starting, uh, to unionize.

01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:31.100
And um, and in fact I had a reposted it not long ago on my, uh, my thing, but they tried

01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:36.480
to get him to sign an NDA to give him a month of severance after he had been with companies

01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:37.840
since it started.

01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:40.120
And he's like, no, I'm not signing your fucking NDA.

01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:41.280
I'm going to be public about it.

01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:43.400
And I'm like, good for you, dude.

01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:46.960
So, um, I mean he probably said it nicer than I did.

01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:52.080
So yeah, uh, Taylor Moore, um, said, and I'm going to read the quote this morning after

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:55.940
six years of pouring my life into the mission people and creators of Kickstarter, I was

01:15:55.940 --> 01:15:58.840
fired for union organizing.

01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:02.320
Last week, another member of the union organizing committee was fired and we have reason to

01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:05.260
believe that more are being targeted.

01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:08.900
The union busting campaign at Kickstarter that Kickstarter management is engaging in

01:16:08.900 --> 01:16:13.700
is illegal and wrong and is a dramatic abandonment of the values of an organization that I've

01:16:13.700 --> 01:16:16.220
loved and served with my whole heart.

01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:19.220
Um, and in fact it actually is illegal.

01:16:19.220 --> 01:16:20.220
Union busting is illegal.

01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:25.920
Um, are, we have laws about this even though certain orange creatures in power are trying

01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:26.920
to undo that.

01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:31.020
Has Kickstarter responded trying to shift the conversation, trying to blame it on him

01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:32.020
or something?

01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:33.020
I mean, I don't know.

01:16:33.020 --> 01:16:34.020
I'm just curious if they've responded.

01:16:34.140 --> 01:16:40.000
So, um, a Kickstarter, uh, spokesperson said this, when someone has been through this process

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:43.620
and we have sufficient evidence that their performance is not improving, we must unfortunately

01:16:43.620 --> 01:16:44.620
part ways with them.

01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:45.620
See what they're doing?

01:16:45.620 --> 01:16:46.620
Mm hmm.

01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:49.900
This is not as interesting as the story about union busting, but it is the reality of what

01:16:49.900 --> 01:16:50.900
happened here.

01:16:50.900 --> 01:16:54.820
Not that it's fucking bullshit because this person has been with the company and started

01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:59.420
very successful, um, uh, events.

01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:04.420
Why'd you keep this guy for six years if his performance was questionable?

01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:09.460
I mean, I know sometimes people can get senioritis and stuff and slip in their performance, but

01:17:09.460 --> 01:17:11.100
this does seem awfully convenient.

01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:13.160
Well, and there's more about this.

01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:18.300
The company also said that of 28 members who have publicly come out in support of the union,

01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:24.980
14 to 15 who are eligible for raise or promotion during this review cycle received one or both.

01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:29.400
It's still though, I mean, you can, so they're trying to say, don't

01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:30.400
look over here.

01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:31.400
Look over here.

01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:37.000
But on top of that, you can still perform well and want to benefit other people.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:40.440
You know, this is why I get all those, you know, I don't understand all these people

01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:47.360
who are like, well, you know, like they want to put a, um, a, uh, gosh, I can't make my

01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:48.360
words come out.

01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:55.480
Like for the people who want to tax anything over a higher income bracket and they're like,

01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:59.920
it's not affecting you personally, the money is going to go back into you.

01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:04.480
Just because these people are doing well doesn't mean they shouldn't contribute to the wellness

01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:05.480
of other people.

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:09.680
And it's also kind of one of those, like, what about all the good things I did argument?

01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:11.200
It doesn't negate the bad thing.

01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:15.440
Well, I mean, there were medical advancements that came out of the Holocaust, but it was

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:16.440
still bullshit.

01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:19.760
I wasn't going to go there, but you know, but I'm going to, I'm going to go there.

01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:21.980
I'm going to throw that as an example.

01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:29.380
You know, good people will try more Liberty to do that than I do, but yeah, and, but anyway,

01:18:29.380 --> 01:18:33.460
you know, and on top of that, they sell, send out an email.

01:18:33.460 --> 01:18:39.940
The Kickstarter United group, um, uh, basically said that was a vile, a violation of their

01:18:39.940 --> 01:18:45.020
public benefit pledge that the company made in 2015 and they're saying, Kickstarter United

01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:46.460
is under attack.

01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:49.220
This is what it means to be a public benefit corporation.

01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:53.560
How can we continue to reconcile the discrepancies between the flaunting of our company's mission

01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:55.300
and the way we treat our employees?

01:18:55.300 --> 01:18:58.300
Are these a value of Kickstarter PPC?

01:18:58.300 --> 01:19:02.020
I'm going to be honest when it comes to this story, like I, and you know, all the, the

01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:07.900
anti-union stuff is silly and you know, Kickstarter needs to just, you know, realize that they're

01:19:07.900 --> 01:19:09.540
on the wrong side of this.

01:19:09.540 --> 01:19:13.560
However, I'm kind of with Kai's, Judo's first comment here in chat, Kickstarter is still

01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:14.560
a thing.

01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:16.420
Like that's kinda like, I'm going to be honest, it's kind of where I'm at.

01:19:16.420 --> 01:19:19.660
I'm trying to think, like, when was the last time I backed a Kickstarter?

01:19:19.660 --> 01:19:24.040
Probably that and stream Kickstarter, which I don't, which I don't regret doing and stream

01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:25.720
has been a great service there.

01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:30.460
They're great on their discord and the service is coming along nicely.

01:19:30.460 --> 01:19:35.400
And part of the, a big part of the reason why I backed that one in particular was because

01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:39.020
they weren't asking me to fund something that hasn't even had a one line of code written

01:19:39.020 --> 01:19:40.020
yet.

01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:42.660
They were essentially taken pre-orders through Kickstarter.

01:19:42.660 --> 01:19:45.980
It's essentially what they were doing, trying to get kind of that seed money to get that

01:19:45.980 --> 01:19:51.500
oomph out the door when we've seen too many Kickstarter projects crash, burn, fail, never

01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:52.500
get out the door.

01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:59.020
So too many projects, unfortunately like Bloodstained, but more so other big floppy projects have

01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:01.020
kind of ruined it for everybody else.

01:20:01.020 --> 01:20:02.700
I did exactly three.

01:20:02.700 --> 01:20:04.540
We did Bloodstained.

01:20:04.540 --> 01:20:12.100
I did the asexual D20 pin, which I don't know where it is because my sash is missing.

01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:14.300
I think I lost it at Dracon.

01:20:14.300 --> 01:20:16.300
And then I did the hottiful boyfriend plushies.

01:20:16.300 --> 01:20:18.060
I'm not saying all Kickstarters are bad.

01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:23.200
Like I remember backing the first gamer X back in the day, which I don't regret doing.

01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:26.980
You know, it was a needed thing and I'm glad we had it for as long as we did, you know,

01:20:26.980 --> 01:20:27.980
and all that.

01:20:27.980 --> 01:20:30.340
Um, but like, I'm not saying all Kickstarter projects are bad.

01:20:30.340 --> 01:20:34.620
I'm just saying because of all the weird things that have happened over the years, like I'm

01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:35.980
more apprehensive to do it.

01:20:35.980 --> 01:20:39.380
And I see less of them get promoted these days because so much of it gets lost in the

01:20:39.380 --> 01:20:41.740
noise because you know what does get promoted.

01:20:41.740 --> 01:20:44.740
Now it's a GoFundMe to pay so-and-so's medical bills.

01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:49.020
That's the big thing you see all over Facebook, which is a whole nother commentary.

01:20:49.020 --> 01:20:53.140
I don't want to get into, but is that's where the conversation seems to be at.

01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:59.500
Whether or not though you believe in unions, this is highly suspect and it is illegal.

01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:04.740
It is illegal, especially, and even if it had nothing to do with it, I would still wait

01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:10.640
until there's like a gap of time between when this person just starts trying to unionize.

01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:14.080
You know, that just looks really shitty on you, Kickstarter.

01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:21.400
And on top of that, you know, one of my friends on my, one of my other Facebooks said, um,

01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:25.520
you know, but doesn't this harm the people who use Kickstarter to get their businesses

01:21:25.520 --> 01:21:27.560
started or don't have any other way to raise capital?

01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:29.880
I mean, there's other ways to raise capital.

01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:34.840
There are other crowdfunding sources on there and they are going to use this actively to

01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:36.340
protect their interests.

01:21:36.340 --> 01:21:41.200
They are going to use their, the, the people who are using their service as their meat

01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:43.940
shield and we cannot let that happen.

01:21:43.940 --> 01:21:48.820
We have to show them using a meat shield like this is not going to help you.

01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:51.180
We will hold your ass to the fire.

01:21:51.180 --> 01:21:54.100
And then that means they stop using the meat shield hopefully when they see it's not going

01:21:54.100 --> 01:21:55.100
to do shit.

01:21:55.100 --> 01:21:56.100
All right.

01:21:56.100 --> 01:22:02.660
I, I encourage everyone at this point, look hard and deep into it and actually sit and

01:22:02.660 --> 01:22:07.460
make a decision about it and make sure that if you continue to support them, you have

01:22:07.460 --> 01:22:09.420
a damn good reason why you're doing it.

01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:10.420
All right.

01:22:10.420 --> 01:22:13.540
Well, with that, in the interest of time, we're going to move on to the next story.

01:22:13.540 --> 01:22:16.580
So back to, uh, back to classic video game stuff.

01:22:16.580 --> 01:22:20.900
One thing that, yeah, they're, they're not funded, but they're, they're sure a dime a

01:22:20.900 --> 01:22:21.900
dozen these days.

01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:22.900
Yeah.

01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:26.380
We talked a little bit about this Neo Geo arcade stick that was out there that we didn't

01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:29.700
really know what it was aside from it's an arcade stick for the Neo Geo.

01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:32.620
Is it for like using on the Neo Geo?

01:22:32.620 --> 01:22:33.960
I mean, what the hell is it?

01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:40.500
So apparently though, this is going to be, um, you can plug it into a PC to use it with,

01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:47.740
I guess, uh, PC games that, you know, SNK PC games, I would assume, or it can also be,

01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:51.200
um, like a Neo Geo mini console.

01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:55.340
So you can actually hook up, um, other controllers to it as well.

01:22:55.340 --> 01:23:01.980
It's got 20 classic Neo Geo games inside, so you can also attach to TV via HDMI 20 Neo

01:23:01.980 --> 01:23:02.980
Geo games.

01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:06.920
So basically every king of fighters that they've made every fatal fury, every art of fighting

01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:08.060
and every samurai showdown.

01:23:08.060 --> 01:23:09.060
That's 20 games, right?

01:23:09.060 --> 01:23:10.060
Oh shit.

01:23:10.060 --> 01:23:13.680
No, there's at least eight summary showdown games.

01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:17.220
And keep in mind, there's been a KOF game ever since 90, 94.

01:23:17.220 --> 01:23:20.580
My joke there is that Neo Geo is like nothing but fighters, although we know, of course

01:23:20.580 --> 01:23:23.460
there's other metal slug.

01:23:23.460 --> 01:23:24.460
I know.

01:23:24.460 --> 01:23:25.460
I know.

01:23:25.460 --> 01:23:30.220
Uh, the, um, puzzle games, uh, puzzle bobble, all those games were, um, full star blazing

01:23:30.220 --> 01:23:35.780
star, uh, magical drop one of my favorite puzzlers anyway, do we know what the list

01:23:35.780 --> 01:23:37.180
of games that are on this yet?

01:23:37.180 --> 01:23:38.180
Nope.

01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:39.180
Oh, no idea.

01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:40.180
Stay tuned kids.

01:23:40.180 --> 01:23:41.180
Yep.

01:23:41.180 --> 01:23:42.180
All right.

01:23:42.180 --> 01:23:46.740
Well then, uh, let's move on and talk a little bit about, uh, something scary that, uh, is

01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:48.780
going to be coming soon to your mobile phone.

01:23:48.780 --> 01:23:52.340
It's a five nights at Freddy's AR game.

01:23:52.340 --> 01:23:56.140
Uh, so five nights at Freddy's soon going to be moving to AR.

01:23:56.140 --> 01:23:59.900
That sounds horrifying because when I first heard about this, I was like, Oh my God, is

01:23:59.900 --> 01:24:04.700
it like something for hololens that is going to tear, even though hololens really isn't

01:24:04.700 --> 01:24:07.020
a gaming thing at this point is going to terrify me.

01:24:07.020 --> 01:24:10.740
That's what I thought when I first read this, but no AR of course, uh, is becoming bigger

01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:12.860
and bigger on iOS and Android.

01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:17.700
So, uh, you know, like think like the Harry Potter game and Pokemon go have those AR so

01:24:17.700 --> 01:24:21.360
you can actually do AR through your phone and that's how it's going to work.

01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:27.160
So, uh, yeah, it actually uses the air, the area around you to, uh, play five nights at

01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:30.660
Freddy's is called five nights at Freddy's AR special delivery.

01:24:30.660 --> 01:24:33.000
It's being developed by illuminix.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:37.840
So I don't know to what extent the original creator, Scott Cawthon is, uh, involved with

01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:42.120
this, but he's also involved on other projects like the movie adaptation, which I guess really

01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:43.120
is coming in.

01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:46.120
I want to see the movie, even though I am not a fan of the game, I still want to see

01:24:46.120 --> 01:24:47.120
the movie.

01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:50.560
Apparently HD versions of the original games are going to be happening as well next year.

01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:53.080
And, uh, he's working on a triple a title apparently right now.

01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:59.120
So, uh, not just the AR game, but, uh, anyone interested in five nights at Freddy's on AR?

01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:00.120
I think that's cool.

01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:01.120
I don't know how it's going to work.

01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:02.120
It's going to be a little much.

01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:03.120
The VR game sounds cool.

01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:05.120
I'm like the cat gift that says nope.

01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:06.760
Yeah.

01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:07.760
Too scary for me.

01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:11.480
At least it's on a little iPhone or Android or so it's not going to be too pure.

01:25:11.480 --> 01:25:17.520
I actually think like not having all the lights off and playing in the dark and that whole

01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:18.520
thing.

01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:22.040
Too bad when they say, you know, five nights at Freddy's AR game, they're not talking about

01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:24.680
like a Pokemon go type of game.

01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:25.680
Act deaf.

01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:26.680
Just like we have Pokemon go.

01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:27.680
Now we have five nights.

01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:28.680
Run the fuck away.

01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:32.080
Both, both ends of the spectrum, both ends of the spectrum there.

01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:33.080
Love it.

01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:34.080
All right.

01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:37.600
Well, let's take a trip down memory lane to a more classic time when you know, games,

01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:39.040
games weren't AR.

01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:40.040
They were not.

01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:41.120
I was trying to find the music.

01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:44.840
If you wanted AR, you had to like draw things and put them up on your TV.

01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:45.840
No, I don't know.

01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:50.160
All right.

01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:52.280
It's the classic game of the week.

01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:54.680
Every week, dark soccer steps in the gaming vault and finds the game.

01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:57.400
She thinks, Hey, you guys should be respecting this game.

01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:00.200
Little surprise to your pick this week inspired by a tattoo I saw.

01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:01.200
Ah, okay.

01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:03.520
Cause I was like, not the type of game dark soccer usually talks about.

01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:08.080
No, but it's, it's relevant, I guess it's a, it's a, it's kind of a big deal for some

01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:09.080
people.

01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:10.080
Yeah.

01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:14.880
So, um, the game I picked was God of war.

01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:20.120
And I mean, I honestly, I watched like a full play through of the last God of war game and

01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:21.120
I thought it looked pretty good.

01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:23.080
So if it led to that, then this is cool.

01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:27.880
But anyway, it's a third person hack and slash adventure that was developed by Santa Monica

01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:30.840
studio and published by Sony.

01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:36.680
It came out March 22nd, 2005 for the PlayStation two is the first one in a long series and

01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:42.880
it is very loosely based on Greek mythology set in ancient Greece.

01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:51.520
You control Kratos who is a Spartan who serves the gods and Athena sells Kratos to go kill

01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:52.760
Ares.

01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:58.680
Um, and basically Ares did some bullshit and tricked him into killing his wife and daughter

01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:03.040
and was besieging Athens and all kinds of shit.

01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:14.320
So anyway, it is a big combat, you know, type of combo game where, uh, your main, uh, weapon,

01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:19.560
the blades of chaos, um, you work, uh, you basically are going to use that weapon.

01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:20.720
I think you can like another one in the game.

01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:26.700
I actually haven't played it, but it has different quick, hi smoosh, but, um, it has different

01:27:26.700 --> 01:27:30.440
quick time events in the game that you have to do through controller actions.

01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:32.640
Um, it's involved in the boss battles too.

01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:39.400
It has some puzzles and platforming, um, and it actually was, uh, at the time the 11th

01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:41.800
best PlayStation two game of all time now.

01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:47.880
So 4.6 million copies worldwide and it won several game of the year awards.

01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:53.920
Um, IGN considered it as a 2009 to be the seventh best PS two game of all time.

01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:56.920
It had great graphics, story, gameplay.

01:27:56.920 --> 01:28:00.200
It was just really a tight ship with that.

01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:06.000
And then that and its sequel were released in November, 2009 as the God of War collection

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:11.320
and then a remastered version in 2012 as God of War saga for PS three.

01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:16.880
There was a novelization and a film adaptation has been in development since 2005.

01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:24.560
Um, and you fight all kinds of new mythological creatures, the undead minotaurs, Gorgons,

01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:31.840
clopsies, sirens, uh, different bosses, and a minotaur called Pandora's guardian.

01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:33.440
I just think that's a cool name.

01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:39.720
Um, you also open chest, they have orbs and orbs do shit like heal you and give you experience

01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:41.000
and stuff.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:47.040
Um, and you get like special items that make you stronger and give you more help than magic

01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:48.520
and stuff like that.

01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:51.760
Um, but you use the blades of chaos in the game.

01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:56.160
They are blades attached to chains, they're wrapped around the wrists and forearms and

01:28:56.160 --> 01:29:00.880
the, they are used in special types of attacks and I'm sure if anyone's watching live right

01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:05.840
now, you can see how you can swing them out or use them in close quarters as a melee weapon.

01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:10.880
So it's quite fierce, it is hardcore.

01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:21.520
And then, um, there also is a quick time, but looky mini game where you have to do female

01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:22.520
twins.

01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:23.520
Anyway.

01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:29.040
Um, so yeah, um, then you get the challenge of the gods after you've beaten the game,

01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:34.720
which is an unlockable, and um, you have to complete certain tasks and then with that,

01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:37.880
you get costumes, behind the scenes videos, and concept art.

01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:43.400
So you get, instead of like, oh, you do well, let's give you some, you know, levels that

01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:48.720
are gonna just make you cry for an hour, here's actually stuff that you'll enjoy.

01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:56.440
And um, so the game has, you know, clearly had some staying power if we, you know, just,

01:29:56.440 --> 01:30:01.780
not too long ago, the last game that came out was really good and added sort of another,

01:30:01.780 --> 01:30:07.280
I would say angle to the character kind of, if anything, I think humanized him a bit more,

01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:14.960
even though he's now like this hardcore old god kind of guy now in the last game, right?

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:18.480
Yeah, I gotta admit, like talking about this game makes me, you know, I kind of missed

01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:23.320
the boat on this recent reimagining, I guess you will, of God of War where Kratos is now

01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:28.080
like daddy Kratos, um, and I was super interested in that game just because of the different

01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:33.840
tone and just sounding like the, um, the maturity, not to say this game was immature, it's not,

01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:38.000
but like, well it did have the like, gooey mini game, but like, you know, the certain

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:43.000
maturity of the developers in, as they're getting older, in wanting to make a game that

01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:46.360
kind of reflects that, like I just found that really fascinating and kind of interesting

01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:51.120
and like that was, and everybody says it's great, but you know, the thing is here, yes,

01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:54.240
we do a podcast about video games, we love video games, we don't have enough time to

01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:57.560
play every single game that gets released, you know, sometimes we miss things, but that

01:30:57.560 --> 01:31:00.840
one I've been meaning to pick up. I wanted to touch on this just because it is kind of

01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:05.480
near and dear to a lot of people, but you know, I do also like that storytelling now

01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:11.120
is really taking a bigger level of maturity to it and that people are being more sensitive

01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:15.840
to their audiences and actually trying, you know, the fan service is there, yeah, but

01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:20.880
you are also getting quite a bit more of, yeah, you have the fan service there, but

01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:27.720
it's a bonus to the good story and gameplay. But at any rate, the game itself is built

01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:34.720
on the Kinetica engine and it was inspired by two things, by Onimusha and by Clash of

01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:41.040
the Titans. I figured Clash of the Titans, I didn't figure Onimusha, that's neat.

01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:48.040
David Jaff, who, you know, was the game director and creator, he said that he had played Onimusha

01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:57.460
and said, let's do that with Greek mythology and then of course watching Clash of the Titans,

01:31:57.460 --> 01:32:02.120
he wanted to take that concept and kind of merge it with Heavy Metal, not like the movie,

01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:06.600
but like Heavy Metal magazine, which I mean the movie came from Heavy Metal magazine.

01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:13.720
And then he wanted to just bump up this to being really high level sex and violence.

01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:21.120
But then, you know, they wanted it brutal, they wanted it to be terrible, they wanted

01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:27.640
you to be a beast, but, you know, I think also that's kind of what the popularity and

01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:32.080
things were at that time was pushing those things and I think they've realized that you

01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:39.080
can have those things and have a mature story, have good storytelling, have great gameplay,

01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:46.800
and have it still be brutal and hard. At any rate, yeah, there have been, you know, like

01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:52.840
I said, there were multiple re-releases, there was, you know, lots of, you know, the soundtrack

01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:58.600
for it was actually pretty amazing. It had its own release on there and it was actually

01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:02.560
considered one of the best soundtracks that came out and that soundtrack was released

01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:07.800
in 2010, again, as downloadable content for the God of War trilogy soundtrack and God

01:33:07.800 --> 01:33:14.400
of War III Ultimate Edition. But it was received very well, the story was considered compelling

01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:20.520
and it won many, like I said, Game of the Year awards and David Jaff won Designer of

01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:26.080
the Year awards, I don't know if I'm mispronouncing his name, but whatever. And then there was,

01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:29.960
you know, a novelization about it, which I might actually bother to read the novelization.

01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:34.640
But, you know, whenever they do novelizations, they'll usually, like, get more elements that

01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:40.520
they want to put into the story, so I kind of dig those. And there's a film in, well,

01:33:40.520 --> 01:33:47.520
that's been announced in 2005. In development hell. They actually sent the script out to

01:33:50.420 --> 01:33:55.840
Daniel Craig and he turned it down. And then they said they've got someone else on there

01:33:55.840 --> 01:34:01.320
for it and they might like them. And they were bringing in the writers for Pacific Rim,

01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:06.480
so Pacific Rim was great. Second one, I didn't see it, not so much. But hey, I'll believe

01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:09.080
it when I see it. But there you go, it's God of War.

01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:14.960
Alright, your classic game of the week, God of War for the PlayStation 2. That's right,

01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:21.960
the PlayStation 2 is a classic console. Under our 10 years or more rule, a lot of PS3 games

01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:29.680
qualify as well. So, there it is. Alright, anyhow. Yeah, a series that I've played a

01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:33.440
little bit, but I've more, like, watched my friends play it. I haven't really got my hands

01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:38.560
on it myself. I would definitely, even if you don't play the game, just watch this last

01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:41.400
one. Well, even just, oh, the last one. I was gonna say, you were just putting together

01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:44.920
the footage for tonight. I was kind of, like, watching it going, oh, yeah, yeah, I remember

01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:50.400
this. So, yeah, I definitely wanna, it's one of those things, like, it's on my list. I'll

01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:55.960
get to that at some point. Horizon Zero Dawn, eventually. They're, like, on a list.

01:34:55.960 --> 01:34:59.440
So, it's Jaffe, pardon me. Yeah, it's alright. I didn't really care anything about God of

01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:02.960
War until I watched the playthrough of the last one. Gotcha. I would probably skip the

01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:09.160
first two, honestly, just because the last one was so, so much more interesting to me.

01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:12.320
Yeah. Well, they have that trilogy to the, like, you know, if you wanna catch up, they

01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:17.880
have that trilogy they put on PS4. We've got them somewhere in the vault. Just, I haven't

01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:22.360
cared enough, but this last one, you know, was definitely enough to make me wanna sit

01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:26.720
down and watch it and actually show some interest in playing it. And Questbuster kinda agrees

01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:30.480
there, saying the new God of War is rock solid and they added in a few things with patches.

01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:34.480
Alright, well, we're gonna go to our, uh, a little break here in studio. Um, I'm very

01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:39.560
happy because tonight we have a listener community submission for our break tonight. So, Darktetsuya,

01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:45.080
uh, often kinda gets associated with this game series, La Mulana. Yes. And so, we kinda,

01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:49.120
like, tongue in cheek make fun of him, but in a positive way for his love of La Mulana.

01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:54.040
But what I love that Darktetsuya has done is he's fucking owning it. And so, in a discussion,

01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:57.800
he's gonna talk about this a little bit in the video, but because La Mulana 2, uh, they're

01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:01.800
talking about this for consoles and so forth, he decided, you know what, let's, let's, let's

01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:07.040
show people this game that I always, uh, still have to play it. I think I have it in my library.

01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:11.040
So this is about seven minutes and I'm just saying that because the audio, I think I fixed

01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:15.160
the audio and I think it'll come through okay. Um, but you know, there is a lot of, um, like,

01:36:15.160 --> 01:36:20.040
visuals to this. So I, I was like, do I leave it in the podcast? Do I not? So I think ultimately

01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:23.320
I'm gonna leave it in just so you guys can hear from Darktetsuya and why he likes La,

01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:28.040
La Mulana so much. But if you find that you're not really, like, not being able to see it is

01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:31.480
kind of bothering you, then I am telling you it's about seven minutes long if you want to go ahead

01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:35.960
and fast forward. But, uh, for those of you that are, uh, watching live, uh, here you go. We're

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:42.120
gonna go to a break segment here where Darktetsuya is going to talk about his love of La Mulana.

01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:48.280
Okay. Hello everybody. It's, uh, Darktetsuya here. So I thought I would try and do a, uh,

01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:54.520
break video for, uh, friends over at OLR. And what better game to do it on than one that was

01:36:54.520 --> 01:37:02.440
just recently announced. So this last week was PAX, right? And they announced that the American

01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:06.200
version of La Mulana 2 coming to console is actually going to include the original. So

01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:11.080
thought I might show you a little bit of the beginning of the game here, show you what you're

01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:20.040
in for. Probably hear my name come up every time this game comes up, so.

01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:26.600
Yeah, I know a thing or two about this one. So yeah, start off. You come in here,

01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:34.440
see how far I can get in maybe, maybe 10 minutes, maybe a little less. So yeah, this elder's all

01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:43.400
pud. Let's see. So he'll explain to you what's, what's going on. You have to enter the ruins,

01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:44.920
ruins of La Mulana, find your dad.

01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:52.120
Okay, so let's see. Yep. Take your laptop, get an upgrade. All right.

01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:58.120
And yeah, he'll send you, uh, emails during the game to give you hints and whatnot.

01:37:58.120 --> 01:38:06.040
Okay, so let's see. Next stop. Oh, where is it? Actually, no. I, oh, well, there it is. Yeah.

01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:09.800
By this item, it's a hand scanner. It was inspired by a real, uh,

01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:15.800
peripheral they made for the, uh, MSX system. Yeah. The original version of that came out,

01:38:15.800 --> 01:38:23.880
what was it, 2005. It was a freeware indie game. Oh, there's something I need to get first. Yeah.

01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:29.400
It's a freeware indie game. The developers loved all the games to the old MSX computer system.

01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:34.600
So they took a lot of the inspiration from some of those games that they played,

01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:38.120
created this, uh, freeware game. Let's see.

01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:43.240
Now I'm, now I'm forgetting where I need to, oh, wait, I know where I need to go.

01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:52.120
Two minutes. Well, should be, oh, why did I do that? Anyway. Yeah. So that was originally released

01:38:52.760 --> 01:39:03.240
for freeware on PC in about 2005, I believe, 2005, 2006. And, uh, yeah, it was a freeware indie game.

01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:11.480
And, uh, Aeon Genesis was a translation group. They, uh, translated the game into English.

01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:17.640
And then guy by the name of Deceased Crab made it famous on YouTube. And

01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:19.880
that's kind of where I discovered it.

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:29.800
So anyway, yeah. Come up here. Got these birds. Okay. Yeah. Hold that. Push down to use weights

01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:35.960
on these pedestals. You know, just like in Indiana Jones. Kill the snake here and shell horn.

01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:41.320
Maybe you trigger a trap or solve a puzzle, you'll hear noise. It's different for each, but

01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:50.840
yeah. So very useful item if you're first playing the game. If you're speed running it,

01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:56.200
you probably won't need it, but I'm not at that level yet. Let's see if I can,

01:39:57.160 --> 01:40:04.120
ah, come on. I just, I'll just drop down then. I kill this guy. Oh, I don't have any weights.

01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:11.160
Really? Well, I have to come here. Is there a weight in here? Nope.

01:40:12.840 --> 01:40:15.720
I didn't want to have to detour to buy.

01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:23.400
Nope. Dang it. Well, that's gonna, nope.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:33.400
Anyway. Yeah. I'll try not to make this too long, but yeah. It's,

01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:38.520
all right. So what do we got? We'll go in the shop here. Yeah, there we go. Okay.

01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:47.720
That should do us for now. It's funny, yeah. I, watching his videos of the game, it looked like

01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:54.680
fun. Okay, actually the videos that we're watching is the, uh, I started with the, uh, the bonus

01:40:54.680 --> 01:41:03.000
dungeon, uh, Hell Temple. I would not recommend going in there. It is not fun. Anyway, yeah.

01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:04.760
See, end of the ruins here.

01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:13.160
Oh, wait a minute. I have to equip that. Yeah, that's just Cellpud telling you something.

01:41:14.120 --> 01:41:22.440
Say, I read this. They lurk within this land over deals. So yeah. Then this. Okay.

01:41:24.680 --> 01:41:44.520
So I really didn't want to talk over that part. That intro is just amazing. You step into the

01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:50.920
temple for the first time, and you hear that, like, the adventure begins here. So yeah. Now,

01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:52.600
this item you need to get to get a...

01:41:56.200 --> 01:42:02.600
Anyway, yeah. Let's see. See, yeah. See, yeah. That's solving a puzzle. Step on that tomb.

01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:06.280
Step on that tile there. Sacred Orb. Sacred Orb gives you some extra life.

01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:15.720
Anyway, yeah. So come down here. Yeah. Let's see. All right.

01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:22.360
So yeah. You know, you got enemies to kill, bosses to fight, these little skeleton guys.

01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:25.480
Oh yeah. There's an item you need to buy to get, to be able to read those,

01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:29.000
but that's up on the surface. Let's see.

01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:37.480
Um, why don't I end the video with this? Let's see. Do I have a way? Okay, yeah.

01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:39.960
Sometimes there's traps, like this one.

01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:51.000
Yep. Uh, anything else I have to say about the game? I mean, not really.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.640
I mean, it's... I think it's a lot of fun. I...

01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:01.640
Definitely pretty hard, though. I would absolutely recommend a walkthrough.

01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:10.440
Either a video walkthrough or game facts or, uh, what is that? Or there's a wiki, you know?

01:43:12.600 --> 01:43:16.040
But yeah, this is coming out early 2020 for consoles.

01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:20.360
There is also the sequel that's going to be included.

01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:27.160
Apparently a lot of the, uh, they made some tweaks to the, uh, hint system to help you get,

01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:32.680
to help you get, figure out where you need to go. And a lot of that is going to be retrofitted into

01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:38.360
the first game, so I thought that was neat. There's a, uh, there was a panel at PAX that

01:43:38.360 --> 01:43:42.200
they recorded that I definitely recommend looking up, so...

01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:51.560
Yeah, you know, exploring the ruins, solving puzzles, and trying to avoid traps, it's...

01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:53.320
I enjoyed it!

01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:54.600
Anyway.

01:43:57.560 --> 01:44:00.440
Anything else I have to say on this? I mean, not really.

01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:08.920
Anyway, yeah. I guess that was a brief look at, uh, La Mulana coming soon to consoles early 2020.

01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:14.360
So, maybe I'll do a video on this.

01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:20.520
All right, there it is. Thank you, Dr. Tuye, for that submission there for, uh, La Mulana.

01:44:20.680 --> 01:44:23.480
For that submission there for, uh, La Mulana.

01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:26.920
Uh, appreciate that. Uh, and some folks, some folks in chat, very nice,

01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:32.600
give me some helpful advice there, uh, about, uh, you know, uh, talking while playing video games.

01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:37.560
It's hard. It's a hard thing to do, but yeah, when we do those, and that's why I don't always make the

01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:42.360
break videos myself because, um, you know, trying to narrate the video game I'm playing can sometimes

01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:46.920
be a pain in the butt. And Bobby's, Bobby's needling me on the whole, uh, the DragonCon

01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:49.640
thing we did where we were trying to play Overwatch. It was just, it was just too much,

01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:53.400
like, going on at once. We had to, like, dial it back. I need to teach you the power of voiceover,

01:44:53.400 --> 01:44:59.800
Rob. Well, girl, I know how to talk, you know, but. Yeah, but you can record the footage.

01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:05.320
Which is a great suggestion that came up in chat is that you can also record the footage

01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:11.080
first and then. That's how I'm going to be doing my sim stuff. Yeah, yeah. So, um, but I super

01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:16.200
appreciate, uh, that Dr. Tuye sent that in and I welcome anybody in our community that has a game

01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:20.840
that they love like that, that they want to share with the show. Uh, please feel free to send in

01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:27.080
your submission, but do, do file that in the back of your mind that it is a podcast as well. And so

01:45:27.080 --> 01:45:31.800
you have to kind of think of both and it's not an easy thing to do. Trust me, you know, that's,

01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:36.680
that's, and that's one reason why here at OLR, I feel like we've been challenged with,

01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:40.680
we've got the radio, we've got the talking part down because this is what we've been doing for

01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:45.800
17 years. It's the visual part of the show that we've been like, I know this is not the

01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:49.800
most nice looking studio in the world and everything. That's the part where we're

01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:54.440
challenged is making it more visually compelling, visually challenged without having to spend my

01:45:54.440 --> 01:45:58.440
entire Sunday doing B-roll before the show, but you know, little bits here and there go a long

01:45:58.440 --> 01:46:02.920
way. So anyway, we're all working to improve. Anyway. Uh, let's move on though. Cause we,

01:46:02.920 --> 01:46:05.960
you know, we have been actually speaking and talking, we've been doing it for a while.

01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:10.120
We're coming up on eight o'clock here on the West coast. And I want to make sure we have some time

01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:14.520
to get some calls if there are any calls tonight. So let's get into some rapid fire news as we

01:46:14.520 --> 01:46:19.080
travel around the industry this week and see what else has been going on in gaming news.

01:46:19.080 --> 01:46:23.720
So this is very cool. So this is a great game that came out on the Xbox 360 and PC and Wabaks.

01:46:23.720 --> 01:46:28.920
So Castle Crashers is being remastered. It is coming now to PlayStation four and

01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:36.920
Nintendo switch on September 17th. They are going to be improving the textures and bumping the, uh,

01:46:37.640 --> 01:46:43.160
the FPS to 60 and, um, including all previously released DLC.

01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:49.400
So that'll be something to look forward to and it looks awesome. I'll have to check it out.

01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:54.680
If you want to play Castle Crashers yet again, but it is a really good game. I can't sound too

01:46:54.680 --> 01:46:59.160
shady. Um, and then this is kind of cool. So I watched a little bit of a video about this,

01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:07.960
called the floor is lava, the video game, which it's, it's great. So it's by the developers,

01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:14.600
uh, who did don't starve. And it's, uh, it's kind of funny because they have this,

01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:23.560
like almost like a parody GI Joe, um, you know, uh, type of cartoon thing that goes along with

01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:32.280
it as well. So they, uh, like they call it the G A T and it was just, it was really kind of funny,

01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:35.720
the, just the detail that they put into it. But yeah, it's, it's like what you would think it

01:47:35.720 --> 01:47:41.720
would be. It's like a parkour type of game with the floor being lava. Do your kids play that at

01:47:41.720 --> 01:47:47.480
home? The floor is lava. Um, they have probably played that in a Roblox. So I'm sure that they

01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:52.040
played several Roblox games that are like that, but this is also something that's also coming to

01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:57.720
Apple arcade as well. But, um, it is coming out on PC as well. You can book, you know, um,

01:47:58.600 --> 01:48:02.120
favorite it on steam or whatever. So look for, yeah, hot lava.

01:48:03.080 --> 01:48:07.560
Uh, jumping back to the castle crashers, one, a great tip in our chat from DJ Rama S who says,

01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:13.560
FYI, if you already have castle crashers on Xbox 360, you can get the remastered version for $4.99.

01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:17.480
You buy it under the same gamer tag as the original game. Well, I love that little,

01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:20.840
little incentive for having bought the game before. Um, and I should have mentioned,

01:48:20.840 --> 01:48:26.040
I didn't mention already, uh, games coming out in September 19. So very soon the lava game,

01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:30.760
yeah, hot lava. So, uh, check it out. Okay. Well, let's move on to another game,

01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:34.760
uh, coming soon that I don't know. I felt like it had some mixed reaction when we first talked

01:48:34.760 --> 01:48:41.560
about it, but, uh, Contra rogue core is a game that's, I think they showed off some more footage

01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:46.840
during Tokyo game show. They didn't just do footage. There's actually a demo that came out,

01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:52.840
uh, a demo for Contra rogue core is available. Is it core or corpse? I think core. That's what

01:48:52.840 --> 01:48:56.840
I thought core because corpse sounds like everybody's already dead. That's what I thought.

01:48:57.800 --> 01:49:02.360
Well, Hey, it's, it's a pronunciation thing I got right for a change. So let's celebrate that.

01:49:02.360 --> 01:49:06.840
All right. Anyway, so Contra rogue core, uh, a demo came out on PlayStation four,

01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:12.840
Xbox one and Nintendo switch on all the different digital stores. Uh, and you get to dive into the

01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:17.960
damn city. That's actually what it's called. It's damned city. So you get to dive into the damn

01:49:17.960 --> 01:49:23.000
city and actually play a little bit of the game. Uh, he, the demo is part of the single player

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:28.200
campaign of the twins, twin stick, third person shooter, a playable preview of one of the many

01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:33.160
large scale bosses in the game. Now I did not get a chance to check out the demo myself,

01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:37.800
but I thought that some of you or some of you guys, uh, had, because I know dark Tetsuya,

01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:41.480
I almost wish you'd done a video for that. I guess I should, I shouldn't say it because

01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:45.560
the Llamulana thing was great. And to be fair to dark to see it, he actually did the Llamulana

01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:50.760
thing last week. We didn't do it last week. Cause you had your footage from the, uh, the

01:49:50.760 --> 01:49:55.560
indie event that you went to. So we had to push it back a week, but, uh, I would like to see the demo

01:49:55.560 --> 01:50:00.520
if I don't get my hands on it myself this week. Um, dark to see it says in chat, I played the

01:50:00.520 --> 01:50:05.720
Contra demo and I actually really enjoyed it. And orange right also confirms its core because the

01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:11.960
Genesis game was hardcore. And that was, you know, it's a kind of play on words there with

01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:15.720
that when you do it that way. So anyway, I'm pretty cool that they actually released a demo.

01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:23.560
I feel like we never talk about video game demos anymore in this day and age. So, um, yeah, I, um,

01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:27.400
I don't have a lot of us to say with that. Uh, Hey, I got a pinch hit here live. Loki,

01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:32.600
can you do my second story? Cause the website will not work on this, uh, beast over here.

01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:36.680
Oh, it's it doesn't like the windows XP, I guess. I guess it's, it's more the,

01:50:36.680 --> 01:50:40.040
I think it's cause I'm using Chrome over here. I don't know. But anyway, it's just move on.

01:50:41.160 --> 01:50:46.040
So I think this is a really, I want to talk about this. Yeah. So super Nintendo world,

01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:51.000
of course is the theme park. That's supposed to be coming soon to universal parks and we've

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:57.400
got some more details on when that might be happening. So, uh, they wanted it by 2020 for

01:50:57.400 --> 01:51:01.960
the Tokyo, at least the Tokyo version for the Olympics. Right. So the first version,

01:51:01.960 --> 01:51:08.280
I think is supposed to be coming to Japan, but I don't believe that it's going to make 2020.

01:51:08.280 --> 01:51:14.760
Uh, bummer. Yeah. So I thought I saw like, was it 20, 22, but, um, well, the cut,

01:51:14.760 --> 01:51:18.040
the parts I thought were cool is that they were talking about like a wristband that was supposed

01:51:18.040 --> 01:51:22.040
to interact with the switch as well. Like there was actually going to be like interaction between,

01:51:22.040 --> 01:51:26.280
Oh good. More crap. I get the buy, but yeah, I think it's neat though. So yeah,

01:51:26.280 --> 01:51:29.000
they're talking a little bit about how they're going to, you know, of course they have a super

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:34.520
Mario cart ride and Yoshi's adventure ride are two of the first rides that they're going to have

01:51:34.520 --> 01:51:40.680
there in phase one. Um, Oh, they could do it in phases like star Wars land. It says, yeah,

01:51:40.680 --> 01:51:45.640
you're gonna have this wristband. That's got a big red Mario symbol on it. And it says, by the way,

01:51:45.640 --> 01:51:51.240
the wristband is super cool. It's magnetic. You slap it on your wrist and it just snaps on there.

01:51:51.240 --> 01:51:59.000
Yeah. Flat bracelet. Yes. Snap bracelet and allows you to, um, uh, on it, see a Tiberian

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:07.640
chat says, yeah, excuse me. Yay. Crap. It allows you to, uh, interact with, um, stuff all over the

01:52:07.640 --> 01:52:13.080
different lands. So they said they have three different levels. The first day of, um, Bowser's

01:52:13.080 --> 01:52:18.360
deal and Prince's peaches castle. Um, they have different key elements. You actually get to walk

01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:21.720
through Prince's peaches castle. Like it's sleeping beauty's castle Disneyland. That's so

01:52:21.720 --> 01:52:27.080
cool. Uh, maybe, but yeah, apparently you'll be able to go up and keep score with various games.

01:52:27.800 --> 01:52:31.720
Um, so that's kind of cool. You know what it kind of sounds like a little bit is like, um,

01:52:31.720 --> 01:52:36.760
toy story, uh, the, the midway mania and Disneyland. And I remember the midway mania

01:52:36.760 --> 01:52:41.160
had an app like, it wasn't there like an iPhone midway mania game. I swear that was a thing.

01:52:41.160 --> 01:52:45.240
And like, if you actually play and here's the, you could turn the GPS on because if you actually

01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:51.080
play toy story, midway mania wall in line for toy story based on your GPS, you unlocked like

01:52:51.080 --> 01:52:56.840
a special thing in the game. So I like it when the games kind of do things like that. Cause you know

01:52:56.840 --> 01:53:01.640
what you get. If you play Harry positor, if you play Harry Potter, wizards unite at universal

01:53:01.640 --> 01:53:07.400
studios, Harry Potter world, you know what you get? What? Nothing. So I like it when games kind

01:53:07.400 --> 01:53:11.160
of do stuff like that. So I think this will charge you additional money to get a Harry

01:53:11.160 --> 01:53:17.560
Potter badge or something like that. Fuck all the way off. To be honest. Uh, let's see.

01:53:17.560 --> 01:53:21.400
Kaishido says I want a Mario fencing game. Throwing it back to the kickoff topic tonight.

01:53:21.400 --> 01:53:25.960
Well, if you want a Mario fencing game, I believe wouldn't that be in the 2020 Olympics game?

01:53:25.960 --> 01:53:30.920
True. That true. That, uh, as 200, Matt says, parks are really all about the immersive experience.

01:53:30.920 --> 01:53:35.400
Harry Potter world led the charge and I will give universal credit for that as much as, you know,

01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:40.760
we've stand Disney parks on this show. Universal gets some credit. Like the one stuff that they

01:53:40.760 --> 01:53:45.320
have there. Oh yeah. Universal's got some kick ass stuff, like especially the newer stuff.

01:53:45.320 --> 01:53:50.040
Some of the dated stuff really shows at Sage. I actually, I heard they finally changed the

01:53:50.040 --> 01:53:54.200
Jurassic park ride because now it's Jurassic world. So they went through and completely

01:53:54.200 --> 01:53:58.760
redid that ride. And I think that'd be fun to go see. But anyway, I I'm excited to see universal's

01:53:58.760 --> 01:54:02.840
technology. Cause that, that Harry Potter ride, if you haven't been on that Harry Potter ride,

01:54:02.840 --> 01:54:07.320
it's, it's pretty fucking great. Like it's, it's pretty astounding. I really,

01:54:07.320 --> 01:54:10.680
really liked that ride. And that whole, that whole part of the park is very immersive.

01:54:10.680 --> 01:54:15.320
It's really cool. So I'm excited to see what they do in Nintendo magic. Yeah. All right. Anyway,

01:54:15.320 --> 01:54:19.880
let's move on a dark soccer. You have some rapid fire news too. A couple of quickies. Um,

01:54:19.880 --> 01:54:26.760
cave has finally updated, uh, their shmups. Um, cause they took them off, um, iOS before

01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:33.480
because they were 32 bit and 32 bit went away with iOS 11. So they now have brought them back as 64

01:54:33.480 --> 01:54:40.920
bit. Um, listed among those, as I see Dodonpach maximum, um, I've got death smiles. I'm hoping

01:54:40.920 --> 01:54:45.640
that they include mushihime sama with that. Cause I really enjoyed playing that. So we'll see what

01:54:45.640 --> 01:54:53.000
else comes out and then, um, monster rancher, um, it's going to be on switch of course, but it's

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:59.880
going to play like PS one and look the same. So it is legit. PS one monster rancher, maybe a little

01:54:59.880 --> 01:55:07.320
cleaner, but it's the same thing or monster farm as it was in Japan. And it will be out later this

01:55:07.320 --> 01:55:14.360
year as a Delo title. Uh, in chat, interesting name, obsolete woman in chat says I love cave

01:55:14.360 --> 01:55:22.280
shmups so much. Who doesn't honestly, cave shmups are great. They are hair pulling, you know, and

01:55:22.280 --> 01:55:26.600
not in a good way, more like the, you know, trichotillomania type of way. But it's also

01:55:26.680 --> 01:55:31.560
very nice that with a mobile phone, it's very easy to tilt it vertically. Right. And get your

01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:35.720
vertical shmup the way it's supposed to be done, which more Nintendo switch products need to do.

01:55:35.720 --> 01:55:41.240
I know a couple of them. I remember playing like some of the, this was like way back, like on the

01:55:41.240 --> 01:55:46.440
iPod touch, like way long time ago, they had like some of the cave shmups in there and the controls

01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:49.640
are pretty good because you can just put your finger anywhere on the actual thing and it auto

01:55:49.640 --> 01:55:53.880
fired for you. That's true. Some games work better than other. Yeah. You just, that's all you just

01:55:53.960 --> 01:55:58.040
fire consistently. Like w when do you not fire? You fire consistently and you can,

01:55:58.040 --> 01:56:02.360
you have pretty good precision over like the movement stuff. So it worked out really well.

01:56:03.160 --> 01:56:11.800
That'd be fun. Agreed. Um, that was it. Oh, did you do the monster answer? I did. Oh, I just,

01:56:12.920 --> 01:56:16.520
I'm sorry. Cause I went back and talked about the shmups. Sorry. My bad. It's gonna be weird

01:56:16.520 --> 01:56:20.440
though, how that's going to work though. Cause I can't imagine since this switch doesn't have,

01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:28.440
um, the ability to load discs in, how does it work? Because monster rancher for those who don't

01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:37.080
mean they have an online catalog of virtual CDs that you can choose from. That's not the same.

01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:42.520
It isn't the same, but they got to do something. They should let you hook it up to like Spotify

01:56:42.520 --> 01:56:46.120
or something. Like I know Nintendo doesn't have Spotify, YouTube. Oh my God. Nintendo

01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:50.840
does have YouTube. So imagine if you could hook it up to YouTube and do it that way.

01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:56.200
Or like they should have just, you know, QR codes or something like that. You know, have,

01:56:56.200 --> 01:57:01.240
have random QR codes or the barcode scanners. You may, besides you've got that stupid phone app that

01:57:01.240 --> 01:57:06.680
you don't use for anything. So platoon, you know, it's true. All right. Let's travel around the

01:57:06.680 --> 01:57:10.600
world and check out some games that are coming out a little sooner as we do some world release

01:57:10.600 --> 01:57:17.880
states. Loki. Yes. So we have AI, the Somnium files that's on PC, Nintendo switch and PlayStation

01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:24.920
four Lego, Jurassic world on Nintendo switch real fishing road trip adventure on Nintendo switch and

01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:31.240
PlayStation four, the legend of Zelda links awakening on Nintendo switch, the best game

01:57:31.240 --> 01:57:38.600
of the week, honestly, untitled goose game on Nintendo switch and PC. Um, and then Bobby's

01:57:38.600 --> 01:57:42.520
favorite game, Nino Cooney, wrath of the white witch coming out and into the switch. And if

01:57:42.520 --> 01:57:47.960
that's not enough, Nino Cooney wrath of the white witch remastered on PC and PlayStation four. And

01:57:47.960 --> 01:58:00.120
that's it. Rob is full of cookie. All right. So, uh, girl. Um, so on the 16th, we have bus,

01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:06.520
this is in the UK. We have bus simulator on the 18th. We have modern warfare, beta truck driver,

01:58:07.320 --> 01:58:14.520
on the 19th song, bird symphony AI, the Somnium files, Agalas, which actually was kind of cute.

01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:20.680
It looks very, um, I don't know, like a giant blast voice on the screenshot. Um, Lego, Jurassic

01:58:20.680 --> 01:58:28.120
world, Nintendo switch light Nino Cooney wrath of the white witch on a switch and PlayStation, um,

01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:34.200
legend of Zelda links awakening. Um, by the way, thank you, Deke man for getting me cups from

01:58:34.280 --> 01:58:39.240
seven 11 in Canada. Oh shit. He pulled through for you on that. That's awesome. Tempest fucking

01:58:39.240 --> 01:58:47.800
4,000. Is this really finally on PlayStation and X-Box sweet Tetris 99. You know, I've actually

01:58:47.800 --> 01:58:54.120
played, um, tempest 3000. Yeah, I have to mom, but they only had them like as a limited thing.

01:58:54.120 --> 01:58:58.840
And I played the Atari party. Tempest 3000 was actually like a beta thing for a long time. I

01:58:58.840 --> 01:59:02.920
played at Atari party. I did. I did too. And I think that's it for the week after look at the

01:59:02.920 --> 01:59:09.240
calendar. When did already happen? It did. Tempest 4,000 happened on PC. Yeah. Because we're

01:59:09.240 --> 01:59:13.480
getting it at home. Okay. Got it. That's the, I'm like, wait a minute. I swear I played to this 4,000

01:59:13.480 --> 01:59:18.440
it's on PC. That's it for the week. Okay, cool. Um, moving on to Japan. Very it's, it's one of

01:59:18.440 --> 01:59:22.440
those weeks where we have very similar releases around the world, which I know, but, but like,

01:59:22.440 --> 01:59:26.040
usually it's kind of different what each country is getting, but not this week because here we go

01:59:26.040 --> 01:59:31.000
again, AI, the Somnium files, uh, is also out in Japan this week. So you have that to look forward

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:36.680
to on the playlist station for card fight. Vanguard EX is also a release in Japan this week

01:59:36.680 --> 01:59:42.680
and, uh, Bobby Black Wolf, not approved Nino Cooney wrath of the white, rich, which remastered

01:59:42.680 --> 01:59:47.800
also coming out on PlayStation four. Um, you know, if they charged less for it, I might

01:59:47.800 --> 01:59:52.040
pick it up again on PS4. I would be down with trying to play that game again. Um,

01:59:52.840 --> 01:59:58.200
and I would live stream it, but I would have to somehow restrict Bobby Black Wolf's comments.

01:59:59.160 --> 02:00:09.000
He's allowed to talk just not every positive reacts only heart emojis only. All right. Anyway,

02:00:09.640 --> 02:00:13.960
I'm just, I'm just giving him a hard time. Uh, let's see. Also, uh, coming out in Japan,

02:00:13.960 --> 02:00:17.400
let's see, as we move to the Nintendo switch, I think we get a lot of the same stuff as well.

02:00:17.400 --> 02:00:24.920
Yeah. Card fight Vanguard EX AI, the Somnium files and, um, Jaku no Lila trap of musk.

02:00:25.800 --> 02:00:32.520
It's a game that comes out as well in Japan on the switch. Oh my, I'm looking at the cover art

02:00:33.080 --> 02:00:37.720
and, uh, I see this woman dressed in what looks like a bridal outfit type of thing.

02:00:37.720 --> 02:00:43.400
And then I see like a dude with his shirt open and she's definitely going for some of that musk

02:00:43.400 --> 02:00:51.000
right now. So, um, I guess, I guess that's that on the Nintendo switch are these two people for

02:00:51.640 --> 02:00:57.240
it? Katie, it looked like vampires. It's vampire stuff. Oh God. It's one of those.

02:00:57.240 --> 02:01:02.120
And there, what is it? This is a porny game. There's like, I'm sorry, I can't put this.

02:01:02.120 --> 02:01:07.480
It's a visual novel. That's is, is this, or is this not a threesome? That is what I'm looking

02:01:07.480 --> 02:01:13.800
at right now. They're just cuddling Peter, Paul and Mary. It doesn't, that could one, two, three,

02:01:13.800 --> 02:01:19.160
is it gross? Me and me. What is it gross? No, they're just all very androgynous on,

02:01:19.160 --> 02:01:23.960
but these two were kissing and the other ones like, you can't see their hand and I have no

02:01:23.960 --> 02:01:30.920
idea the pronouns for any of these people, but who cares? They're vampires. That's right.

02:01:30.920 --> 02:01:35.720
There's definitely some heavy petting in this game. Good Lord. All right. Let them pet

02:01:36.440 --> 02:01:41.160
trap of musk among other things. All right. So there's that. And then of course,

02:01:41.160 --> 02:01:47.400
legend is all the links awakening, but who cares? Trap of musk. All right, let's move on.

02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:55.400
I'm waiting for somebody in chat to be like, it's an anime. SSJ100 Matt says near my salad.

02:01:55.400 --> 02:02:00.280
You're so close. You're so close. It's it's really in front of my salad.

02:02:01.880 --> 02:02:08.440
All right. All right. DJ Rama S says you can stream that on anime jam session. We support that.

02:02:08.440 --> 02:02:13.240
What is, he's going crazy. He misses daddy. That's what's going on. He's, he has been,

02:02:14.040 --> 02:02:18.120
Mr. Smoosh has been fed. So while the B roll was going for classic game of the week,

02:02:18.120 --> 02:02:22.600
I was letting him out of kitty jail and feeding him. So, you know, we take care of Mr. Smoosh

02:02:22.600 --> 02:02:26.760
when you can't see me getting up from my chair, but, um, all right. Anyway,

02:02:27.800 --> 02:02:31.880
he's being very needy. Anyway, this is the part of the show where we would go to the mail bag,

02:02:31.880 --> 02:02:36.920
but, um, dark sock. What we do have one. Okay. Dark soccer is coming back so she can read the

02:02:36.920 --> 02:02:43.000
mail. Do you want me to have Loki do a story or okay. I was ready for this shit. All right.

02:02:43.640 --> 02:02:48.680
Did he go right back in kitty jail? No, he let me carry him to kitty jail. Wow. And he,

02:02:48.680 --> 02:02:54.200
I even played with his foot and he started to purr. Oh, good. So apparently he likes the feets.

02:02:54.760 --> 02:02:58.440
He just misses dad because dad would usually be home around eight o'clock.

02:02:58.440 --> 02:03:03.560
So, and he's just not right now. So, all right. Anyway, uh, dark soccer, mailbag,

02:03:03.560 --> 02:03:08.360
a very short email from Robert M. My head Canon for animal crossing is that the characters,

02:03:08.360 --> 02:03:13.320
including yours are living plush toys. Also has anything been said or theorized about

02:03:13.320 --> 02:03:17.240
pocket camp connection? First of all, pocket camp is not going to have a connection.

02:03:17.240 --> 02:03:23.240
They have said so. Oh, bummer. Well, I believe that's what they said. Everything I've indicated

02:03:23.240 --> 02:03:28.280
I've seen indicates that it's not going to have connection. I think I've seen that too.

02:03:29.080 --> 02:03:35.160
And then the other thing, um, I still believe in the hot to full boyfriend theory where, um,

02:03:35.160 --> 02:03:43.640
humans are, uh, are, uh, a dying breed. And actually we got another email from Y Y R

02:03:44.520 --> 02:03:47.560
while I was reading the other mail. Wow. Talk about timing.

02:03:47.560 --> 02:03:51.160
Well, maybe it got went out before then. I just didn't refresh. But anyway,

02:03:51.160 --> 02:03:57.560
um, this doesn't, yeah. Anyway, hello. This email has been sent to acknowledge the dream game

02:03:57.560 --> 02:04:03.000

submission is being processed. Please be patient while the process is completed.

02:04:14.520 --> 02:04:21.480
You remember what you said, right? It was vectors. Yeah. Thank you for using the Y Y R games,

02:04:21.480 --> 02:04:27.320
dream game submission service regards Aaron. Y Y R dude. I'll just be happy if it's turds, but plays

02:04:27.320 --> 02:04:35.400
like, um, like, uh, I just said the damn game a moment ago at tempest. He needs to say it like

02:04:35.400 --> 02:04:39.560
the Skype lady. When you call echo one, two, three, thank you for using the dream game

02:04:39.560 --> 02:04:45.160
submission service after the tone. Please leave your game. Thank you for using the Y Y R games,

02:04:45.160 --> 02:04:51.240
dream game submission service. How was that? In case of an emergency landing, there's two exits

02:04:51.240 --> 02:04:57.720
above the lava toy, two exits above the wings. I think my accent was pretty okay. No, your

02:04:57.720 --> 02:05:04.280
accent was good. Yeah. All right. Act F has a theory at animal crossing saying animal crossing

02:05:04.280 --> 02:05:09.320
is probably a kid-friendly version of Dr. Moreau's Island or whatever it's called. The Island of Dr.

02:05:09.320 --> 02:05:14.120
Island of Dr. Moreau, uh, which I think was a classic movie that was pretty well regarded.

02:05:14.120 --> 02:05:18.520
And then they remade it in the nineties. It was like one of Marlon Brando's last movies and

02:05:19.480 --> 02:05:26.200
girl, that movie was a mess. Didn't it go into like, they played off of that theme with like

02:05:26.200 --> 02:05:34.040
the nutty professor. Maybe I can't help but think of the Island of Dr. Brain by Sierra,

02:05:34.040 --> 02:05:40.040
which was superior in every way. Mr. Magoo did some of that too. Does anyone remember Mr. Magoo?

02:05:40.680 --> 02:05:46.360
Oh, Rob don't die. Yes, I remember it. I remember Mr. Magoo and I remember Captain Kangaroo.

02:05:47.160 --> 02:05:53.560
Tired Island of Dr. Moreau wired Island of Dr. Brain. Okay. Just say it.

02:05:55.480 --> 02:06:00.520
I need to find that. Can you, can you play that on some service? Maybe it's in the art on it.

02:06:00.520 --> 02:06:04.680
I think it's on the web archive, isn't it? The Dr. Brain thing. I want to play that on a live

02:06:04.680 --> 02:06:10.280
stream some night. I think that'd be fun. All right. I'm looking it up right now. The Island

02:06:10.280 --> 02:06:15.800
of Dr. Brain. Bobby Black Wolf says I have it on my DOS machine, Dr. Brain. Bobby stream it.

02:06:15.960 --> 02:06:20.600
Only available in DOS. But you can, can you still buy it?

02:06:21.720 --> 02:06:26.520
Not that Moby games has a link to it. I think so. I'm going to look it up later after the show.

02:06:26.520 --> 02:06:31.000
All right. Uh, let's move on though. We got to, uh, we're running a little long, so I can't find

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:34.920
it. Is this, it's as equal to a game though. The castle of Dr. Brain. They had, they had several

02:06:34.920 --> 02:06:42.920
Dr. Brain games. They were all fairly similar. There was yeah. Island castle return. I think

02:06:42.920 --> 02:06:48.440
there was a third game. I'm looking so, um, Oh God, there was a bunch. Uh, there was Dr.

02:06:48.440 --> 02:06:54.840
Brain action reaction in 99, uh, thinking games, IQ adventure, puzzle madness. Then there was the

02:06:54.840 --> 02:06:59.720
time warp of Dr. Brain, lost mind of Dr. Brain, the Island of Dr. Brain and castle of Dr. Brain.

02:06:59.720 --> 02:07:04.280
The time warp of Dr. Brain. The time warp of Captain Brain. To load this game,

02:07:04.280 --> 02:07:09.160
please jump to the left and step to the right. Right. And then bring your knees in tight.

02:07:09.160 --> 02:07:15.560
All right. Moving on Loki, please. Next story before we get too much more derailed.

02:07:15.560 --> 02:07:22.200
All right. So this is unfortunate, but apparently the discord nitro games, those are going away

02:07:22.200 --> 02:07:25.800
because apparently no one was playing them. I completely forgot. They even have that service.

02:07:26.680 --> 02:07:33.080
I didn't forget about the nitro service, but I also remember when we were like, Oh my God,

02:07:33.080 --> 02:07:37.880
discord stealth launched a game store onto everyone's PC. They're fucking brilliant and

02:07:37.880 --> 02:07:40.760
all this stuff. And it was so stealth that everyone forgot it was there.

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:49.320
Apparently we made a miscalculation in all this praise for discord is that oops,

02:07:49.320 --> 02:07:57.960
it was a little bit too stealth and I done forgot. Uh, but yes, apparently, um,

02:07:57.960 --> 02:08:04.600
they said they will be removing all games from nitro. Um, apparently the service will be no

02:08:04.600 --> 02:08:08.440
longer, uh, you will not be able to access the a hundred plus games that were included in the

02:08:08.440 --> 02:08:15.560
service after October 15th. And just, they said they were removing, they're still selling nitro

02:08:15.560 --> 02:08:21.320
cause they still want the, the emojis on every server and your price on your name. And you can

02:08:21.320 --> 02:08:26.760
do the boost cause, um, we want to, and Bobby talked about this a little bit on his show. We

02:08:26.760 --> 02:08:32.040
kind of wanted to boost the VOG network server, but you can't just directly do that. Like we

02:08:32.040 --> 02:08:37.960
can't just throw 20 bucks at them and say, boost the certain, like we have to actually get so many

02:08:37.960 --> 02:08:43.240
people to use their boost on the server. And that's silly. Yeah. That was a little weird.

02:08:43.240 --> 02:08:49.400
So discord, if you're out there, let us give you money the old fashioned way. Rob, for the record,

02:08:50.360 --> 02:08:57.960
I found, uh, the, uh, download for the island of dr brain and you can get, uh, the DAS emulators.

02:08:58.520 --> 02:09:03.320
Nice. Except the legal ease of that. Is that legal? Play in your browser.

02:09:03.880 --> 02:09:08.440
Okay. So that's what I thought. Web archive, I think had it at some point. Okay. I'm on my

02:09:08.440 --> 02:09:14.200
abandonware.com. Well, that's, that is a gray area as we know. And I just have to be careful

02:09:14.200 --> 02:09:19.480
what I stream on Twitch. Uh, but I, if it's still on web archive, then I think that's fair game

02:09:19.480 --> 02:09:26.520
because then you're just, I'm playing games at a library. All right. Anyhow, uh, let's move on.

02:09:26.680 --> 02:09:32.120
Actually quickly, um, uh, chat comments here. Tiger claw says discord nitro doesn't seem worth

02:09:32.120 --> 02:09:36.760
it because one of the features is being able to post animated emojis and stuff. Uh, Bobby says

02:09:36.760 --> 02:09:41.720
the feature we want for our server is the update up bit rate in the chat channels. Yes, that is true

02:09:41.720 --> 02:09:47.320
to make the voice quality even better and more pristine on these programs. Or, uh, for instance,

02:09:47.320 --> 02:09:53.320
when extra fur and I are doing a show and using discord to do it, he'll sound even better, um,

02:09:53.400 --> 02:09:58.040
with if we were to have it up server, but that is a, uh, that is a conversation for another day.

02:09:58.040 --> 02:10:01.720
Yeah. Bobby says we want to pay for that as a company and not make you guys subscribe to

02:10:01.720 --> 02:10:06.360
discord to get it. Exactly. You guys are already paying with your subs and your biddies. We could

02:10:06.360 --> 02:10:11.720
just take some of that money and give it to discord, but they won't let us. So, all right.

02:10:12.600 --> 02:10:17.000
Anyhow. I mean, I guess we could subscribe as individuals, but you need what you need,

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:21.880
like two people to boost it, to get to the first level, but then you need like 20 to get to the

02:10:21.880 --> 02:10:26.920
next. I don't know. It's a little weird. Anyway, let's move on though. Um, let's talk about,

02:10:26.920 --> 02:10:32.520
Ooh, let's talk about civilization six. You know, I will take any excuse to talk about civilization

02:10:32.520 --> 02:10:38.600
on this show, but I'm really curious for, um, Bobby's opinion on this because Bobby and I at

02:10:38.600 --> 02:10:45.400
dragon con did a battle royale one Oh one panel. And, uh, we were talking about what games would

02:10:45.400 --> 02:10:50.120
you like to see go the battle royale route. And we had a lot of games come up, but you know what

02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:57.480
game I don't think ever came up civilization, but guess what? For fire access, who of course

02:10:57.480 --> 02:11:01.720
is the company behind all the Civ games and two K who publishes them, uh, is taking their own

02:11:01.720 --> 02:11:07.400
approach on a battle royale mode, uh, for civilization six it's called red death. It's a

02:11:07.400 --> 02:11:13.800
12 player competitive game. So it's not 99. It's 12. I guess that's as many as Civ can handle. Uh,

02:11:13.800 --> 02:11:17.880
and it puts the battle royale on the strategy game, but what you're doing, you're not really,

02:11:17.880 --> 02:11:23.560
okay. So, you know, Civ is one type of game, but in this you're in a post apocalyptic world.

02:11:23.560 --> 02:11:29.880
And so it's like all military driven. So you're doing the military and strategic side of

02:11:29.880 --> 02:11:35.720
civilization. You're not doing the whole like science trees and development trees and all the

02:11:35.720 --> 02:11:41.400
other stuff, the other types of micromanaging in the game. It's not so much for X it's just X

02:11:41.400 --> 02:11:45.320
it's more the military side of things. That's probably the best way I can explain it.

02:11:45.320 --> 02:11:50.360
So you don't play the usual leaders. You play, um, a post apocalyptic type of thing,

02:11:50.360 --> 02:11:55.800
and you're trying to get off the planet by wiping everyone else out. Clearly it's the only way

02:11:55.800 --> 02:12:00.440
everyone in the game starts with one civilian, one infantry unit and one machine gun unit.

02:12:00.440 --> 02:12:05.640
And you grow your faction to crush the other factions. There's no wonders of the world.

02:12:05.640 --> 02:12:10.360
And this is interesting too. There is a storm that shrinks the safe space,

02:12:10.360 --> 02:12:14.680
just like you would see now that part I'm like, okay, that definitely seems more like traditional

02:12:14.680 --> 02:12:18.680
battle royale. Because otherwise, when I read about this, I'm like, this just sounds like a

02:12:18.680 --> 02:12:23.800
fancy mod that isn't really battle royale. It's just a military only model. Oh, okay.

02:12:23.800 --> 02:12:28.520
They're taking cues with the shrinking eye of the storm and things like that. Okay. All right. It

02:12:28.520 --> 02:12:33.480
pushes people more towards the center. I got that. Here's the other part, as much as you might want

02:12:33.480 --> 02:12:37.000
to say that doesn't really feel battle royale. Well, here's, here's something that might really

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:43.880
lessen the complaints. It's free as long as you own civ six. So, Hey, I'm all for enhancements

02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:49.480
and new things. So, it is a new free mode for anybody that already owns the core civ six.

02:12:49.480 --> 02:12:53.080
So, that's pretty cool. Because I have to admit, I bought civ six. I played it a little bit. And

02:12:53.080 --> 02:12:57.480
then I got distracted with other games as tends to happen. So, I need a reason to go back and

02:12:57.480 --> 02:13:04.760
visit civilization six. That's for sure. So, anyhow. So, I don't see any comments from Bobby

02:13:04.760 --> 02:13:08.120
Blackwell on this. I was wondering if he was going to say something on this. But I do see some

02:13:08.120 --> 02:13:13.080
comments from other people. Kaijuto says, as much as I love battle royale, this civ game sounds

02:13:13.080 --> 02:13:18.600
awful. Well, I think you kind of have to be into civ to get it. But like, if you don't really play

02:13:18.600 --> 02:13:26.360
civ, it doesn't sound action packed because civ is not. Act F says, imagine a 99 player battle

02:13:26.360 --> 02:13:34.280
royale game of civ. It would take years to finish. Maybe, but I would bet in a 99 player, I actually

02:13:34.280 --> 02:13:39.640
would be down for a 99 player version of the traditional civilization game because civilizations

02:13:39.640 --> 02:13:43.720
are going to get squashed fast. I think you would have to take out the barbarians to make it work

02:13:43.720 --> 02:13:48.360
and have a really big planet. But I think there could be something there. But then if you're in

02:13:48.360 --> 02:13:53.720
one of the top 10 civs, you're going to be playing for a long time. So, as Jonah and Matt says, I'm all

02:13:53.720 --> 02:13:58.760
for this. And here's the comment from Bobby saying, I need to see more of it. Well, there is a trailer

02:13:58.760 --> 02:14:03.480
out there. They did put out a trailer on YouTube. So, you can see a little bit more of it out there.

02:14:03.480 --> 02:14:07.160
Sorry, I didn't rip it in time for tonight's show. But I know a lot of you are tech savvy

02:14:07.160 --> 02:14:10.840
and probably already opening up YouTube in another window to take a look. So, there you go.

02:14:10.840 --> 02:14:15.640
All right, let's move on. A few more stories before we get to some phone calls and stuff via

02:14:15.640 --> 02:14:22.040
Discord. So, let's go to Dar Sakura. You've been kind of hinting at this one too all night.

02:14:22.040 --> 02:14:27.800
Yeah, I have it on my wishlist on Steam. It's coming out in a few days from what I understand.

02:14:27.800 --> 02:14:34.600
Sorry, on September 24th. A game designed by PsyOp and it is called I Love You, Colonel Sanders,

02:14:34.600 --> 02:14:42.840
a finger looking good data simulator. Yeah, it is KFC dating sim where you date a young hot Colonel

02:14:42.840 --> 02:14:50.200
and he looks just like. Oh, you remember when those like versions were coming out like fan art

02:14:50.200 --> 02:14:56.120
versions of different mascots were out like there's the cute Wendy's, the snarky cute Wendy's

02:14:56.120 --> 02:15:00.360
and the Burger King looking a little kind of younger and they had the hot Colonel Sanders.

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:06.680
Well, hot Colonel Sanders is in the game. I liked Reba as Colonel Sanders for the record.

02:15:07.560 --> 02:15:10.840
Reba, they had a commercial with Reba McEntire playing the Colonel. When?

02:15:11.720 --> 02:15:14.760
Only about a year ago. It wasn't that long ago. It was a recent memory. Guess who doesn't watch TV?

02:15:15.720 --> 02:15:20.200
But it was on Twitter. I'm a big Twitter, like of course. I have all that blocked.

02:15:20.200 --> 02:15:25.160
Just saying. And we have YouTube Red at home. I have a block too, but when I go outside,

02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:29.240
I have this mobile device that lets me see things. Yeah, but I also have ad block on my iPhone.

02:15:30.680 --> 02:15:34.600
Seriously? For everything. I actually don't use the Twitter app. I use echo phone. Oh,

02:15:34.600 --> 02:15:39.240
it's ad blood. This was something people were posting because it's, it's fucking Reba McEntire.

02:15:39.240 --> 02:15:43.240
She's allowed to go around. The moment that I see an ad about something, I just ignore it.

02:15:43.240 --> 02:15:49.560
Even if it's Reba? Even if it's Reba, because I'm not going to let my memory of her think of her as

02:15:49.560 --> 02:15:56.040
a sellout. Reba can do whatever she wants. And then I have to go listen to Fancy. Dark soccer

02:15:56.040 --> 02:15:59.480
is there. Here's your one chance, ad block. Don't let me down. Peter Parker says, yes,

02:15:59.480 --> 02:16:05.560
it's coming out on the day of KFC's founding. Well, a little bit more about this is that

02:16:07.240 --> 02:16:13.800
he is going to be a culinary student with you, that he's gone back to culinary school to become

02:16:13.800 --> 02:16:20.680
the world's greatest fried chicken salesman. And so that becomes one of your challenges to help

02:16:20.680 --> 02:16:28.440
him with that as well as you learn recipes and you have different, you know, other tasks to do

02:16:28.440 --> 02:16:34.440
in the game. But you know, this isn't the first time that KFC delved into romance, right? You

02:16:34.440 --> 02:16:40.760
know? Well, I can't say I've been following the Colonel's love life closely, but- In Mother's Day

02:16:40.760 --> 02:16:49.160
2017, KFC did a romance novel called The Tender Wings of Desire with a hotness version of the

02:16:49.160 --> 02:16:55.720
Colonel. Okay. I'm going to say it. I'm sorry. I can't. I'm going to say it. Can the Colonel be gay?

02:16:55.720 --> 02:17:06.520
Boy, play as girl. No, I'm kidding. No, I don't see why not. I mean- No, in this game.

02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:09.480
Yeah. I don't know. It doesn't say anything about it, but for people who don't know where

02:17:09.480 --> 02:17:15.560
that reference came from, what was that game we played at E3 that was like the dating fucking

02:17:15.560 --> 02:17:23.640
game? And we're like, can you play guys? Boy, play as girl. That's what the guy literally said.

02:17:24.200 --> 02:17:29.800
No, I'm laughing my ass off because this actually fucking happened. It was Feel 3 or something like

02:17:29.800 --> 02:17:34.120
that was the name of it. Yeah. And we were doing the demo at Dark Soccer literally as like, you

02:17:34.120 --> 02:17:40.840
know, the way you phrase it. Like, can two men play? Can two men play? And that was, boy, play

02:17:40.840 --> 02:17:49.960
as girl. Literally the response. And he turned red. This was also years ago. This was like the

02:17:50.440 --> 02:17:56.120
three feel, I think. Three feel, that's it. This was like 2005, I'm sure the game was.

02:17:56.120 --> 02:18:01.320
This was Kensha Hall, wasn't it? It was Kensha Hall. So that'll date our experience. It was a

02:18:01.320 --> 02:18:07.240
long time ago. Society has progressed a long way since the days of three feel. For the record,

02:18:07.240 --> 02:18:16.280
I think the game did come out because I found references to it. Yeah, there were some links

02:18:16.360 --> 02:18:19.720
about it out there, but yeah, I think that it still exists.

02:18:22.440 --> 02:18:28.600
Pixel Pacas in chat says, I actually had that question, Rob. Thank God some of you

02:18:28.600 --> 02:18:34.360
are doing the investigative journalism when we are unable. In the game, they do not specify

02:18:34.360 --> 02:18:41.720
who the protag is or if you can select a gender. So basically the protagonist is whoever you want

02:18:41.720 --> 02:18:48.760
them to be. I like that. I like that. Leave it up to your imagination. And Tiger Claw in chat says,

02:18:49.400 --> 02:18:53.560
so basically you're saying this game is finger lickin' good.

02:18:56.440 --> 02:19:00.120
Apparently you can still get three feel. Hold on, everyone. I just want everyone to note

02:19:00.120 --> 02:19:08.440
episode 792, September 15th, 2019 at approximately 8 29 PM on the West Coast. Tiger Claw said

02:19:08.440 --> 02:19:16.120
something really, really fucking funny. A winner is you.

02:19:19.720 --> 02:19:27.800
All right. And for the record, your is spelled Y O U apostrophe R E. I'm just saying.

02:19:27.800 --> 02:19:31.560
Right. Anything else we need to say about the KFC dating sim?

02:19:31.560 --> 02:19:33.640
Fuck no, but I'm going to stream the shit out of it.

02:19:33.640 --> 02:19:38.600
You should. You should. And don't forget in December, I'm going to be doing a holiday

02:19:38.600 --> 02:19:42.680
star for hot to full boyfriend. I'll be waiting with bated breath. All right. Moving on,

02:19:42.680 --> 02:19:52.520
Loki. I'll buy myself a pizza if I do it. All right. So this is kind of, I guess,

02:19:52.520 --> 02:20:00.200
unfortunate, but you may remember that Billy Mitchell of Donkey Kong high score fame had his

02:20:00.200 --> 02:20:04.920
and hot sauce and hot sauce. Well, pretty much only hot sauce anymore because his

02:20:04.920 --> 02:20:12.440
scores fake hair. I'm just saying his scores were invalidated a while ago.

02:20:13.320 --> 02:20:19.960
So basically his scores were invalidated and, you know, his record was taken out of the Guinness

02:20:19.960 --> 02:20:26.760
Book of World Records. And now, of course, because of that, he is threatening legal

02:20:26.760 --> 02:20:32.600
recourse against Guinness World Records and Twin Galaxies if they don't, uh, retract their

02:20:32.600 --> 02:20:39.560
defamatory statements against him and reinstate his high score world records within the next two

02:20:39.560 --> 02:20:48.280
weeks. You know who I haven't heard about in the news the past couple months? Who? Billy

02:20:48.280 --> 02:20:53.720
Mitchell. You know who I'm hearing about in the news all of a sudden? Billy Mitchell. Wow. Fancy

02:20:53.720 --> 02:21:00.200
that. Funny how that works. Isn't that crazy? Yeah. Isn't life funny? Isn't fame something else?

02:21:00.840 --> 02:21:06.520
It is funny. And, um, I just don't think they have a strong case to be honest. I mean,

02:21:07.160 --> 02:21:12.760
based on some of the stuff I've seen where they're showing you the video footage or whatever from his

02:21:12.760 --> 02:21:18.760
games, apparently versus what's out there and how they can't recreate this the way the screen is,

02:21:18.760 --> 02:21:26.680
um, kind of drawing in. It's just, I don't know, like it's ridiculous. It's not surprising though.

02:21:27.320 --> 02:21:30.600
If this goes to trial, does Bobby Black Wolf get called as a witness?

02:21:32.040 --> 02:21:35.880
That's all. And is there going to be a Bobby Black Wolf subpoena that happens? That's what

02:21:35.880 --> 02:21:38.440
I want to know. Is that, is that going to be a thing that happens? Will this be covered

02:21:38.440 --> 02:21:43.800
by Variety? And could they quote him again in Variety? Tiger call says he's been streaming

02:21:43.800 --> 02:21:47.480
on Twitch. Oh yeah. I heard Billy Mitchell got into Twitch streaming not that long ago.

02:21:48.440 --> 02:21:53.800
So streaming maim. I get, I don't know. How many viewers does he get on the regular? Not that

02:21:53.800 --> 02:21:59.960
that's important, but I'm just curious. Like how many people are watching him do his Donkey Kong

02:21:59.960 --> 02:22:04.280
speed runs or whatever he's working on next? He gets a few hundreds as Bobby Black Wolf.

02:22:04.280 --> 02:22:12.280
Interesting. Well, good for him, but I just, I'm curious to see where this goes. I don't think that

02:22:12.280 --> 02:22:16.040
they're going to, well, obviously they're not going to reinstate his records. I can't wait

02:22:16.040 --> 02:22:19.960
for there to be a settlement. So this can be in the news all over again in a few more months.

02:22:19.960 --> 02:22:24.120
And we can talk about Billy Mitchell again. I don't think there's anything needs to be settled.

02:22:24.120 --> 02:22:33.640
I don't think he has any evidence. So let him Sue. Uh, Bobby Black Wolf says he does the full

02:22:33.640 --> 02:22:37.400
TG thing, twin galaxy things where he shows the motherboard. Like they require,

02:22:37.400 --> 02:22:41.480
he follows all the rules. I think his thing is that they invalidated his Pac-Man record

02:22:41.480 --> 02:22:48.200
that was done in 1982 and Mame wasn't invented until 1997. So it wasn't so much about the Donkey

02:22:48.200 --> 02:22:53.960
Kong record as it was, Hey, when you threw that out, you threw out all this other stuff. When

02:22:53.960 --> 02:23:01.480
I set this record before there was an emulator, basically. So, I mean, I get that, but,

02:23:02.760 --> 02:23:08.760
but at the same time, uh, when Lance Armstrong got caught doping or whatever it was,

02:23:08.760 --> 02:23:11.640
they didn't just take the metal in the year that he was doping. They took them all.

02:23:12.280 --> 02:23:16.440
Yeah. So that is, that is the thing that happens in sports sometimes. So there's kind of two sides

02:23:16.440 --> 02:23:21.880
of it, right? Yeah. So anyway. All right. Well, let's move on and I got one more story for you

02:23:21.880 --> 02:23:27.720
guys. And this one's kind of an odd thing. And I think, I think, uh, you know, a lot of you guys,

02:23:27.720 --> 02:23:31.800
uh, probably heard about this this week and it's kind of a sweet thing, but, uh, it has to do with

02:23:31.800 --> 02:23:36.840
Masha hero, Sakurai, who of course is the great mind behind, uh, super smash brothers and the

02:23:36.840 --> 02:23:41.320
ultimate super smash brothers that was recently released on the switch. Um, and of course there's

02:23:41.320 --> 02:23:46.440
this great meme around the internet, uh, where there's a picture of Sakurai during one of the

02:23:46.440 --> 02:23:51.720
Nintendo directs, but someone has captioned it. Don't ask me for anything ever again. And that

02:23:51.720 --> 02:23:55.960
picture never fails to crack me up whenever there's a smash brothers announcement like

02:23:55.960 --> 02:24:01.240
Terry Bogart or, uh, uh, five more DLC characters coming than somebody replies to that picture.

02:24:01.240 --> 02:24:05.160
Don't ask me for anything ever again, but there's actually kind of like an

02:24:05.240 --> 02:24:11.880
ah moment about this because, uh, Sakurai took home some awards at the Japan game awards 2019.

02:24:11.880 --> 02:24:16.760
And he actually gave a speech and the translated version of the speech goes like this.

02:24:17.480 --> 02:24:22.760
I'm sorry for bringing up this personal story at a time like this, but making smash brothers

02:24:22.760 --> 02:24:28.680
on the switch was the last mission the late Satoru Iwata gave to me. I've put my all into the

02:24:28.680 --> 02:24:34.280
game and with more DLC, I will continue to work hard. So that is really sweet. It's one of those

02:24:34.280 --> 02:24:39.400
things where it's like, don't ask me for anything ever again, unless you're Satoru Iwata, right?

02:24:39.400 --> 02:24:44.840
Then you get whatever you want. And I think that is a very, very, uh, very cool little note to end

02:24:44.840 --> 02:24:49.960
on. And obviously everybody loves this new smash brothers game. It's doing very well and still don't

02:24:49.960 --> 02:24:55.400
have it yet. Still, I'm kind of surprised. It's never going to go on sale. So I don't know which

02:24:55.400 --> 02:25:00.600
I, well, I still remember to send my switch controller in to get fixed because the first

02:25:00.600 --> 02:25:05.960
thing I did wrong was I put that the wrong switch controller is broken. So I still have to send that

02:25:05.960 --> 02:25:10.120
in cause it's slightly broken, but not as bad as the other one. And then I had to eventually send

02:25:10.120 --> 02:25:16.840
the other one in, but I just haven't, I remember to do that. Yep. Which by the way, GameStop dude,

02:25:16.840 --> 02:25:22.280
your fucking controller is so goddamn broken that like, it's just the camera is just straight down

02:25:22.280 --> 02:25:29.320
in like, you know, Breath of the Wild. Just fucking take advantage of that Nintendo service

02:25:29.320 --> 02:25:35.400
to fix that shit or put a new fucking controller on your damn demo kiosk. Like shit. I'm going to

02:25:35.400 --> 02:25:39.240
move on to open up our discord, uh, for anybody that wants to call in. And if you want to be on

02:25:39.240 --> 02:25:43.240
the show tonight, just head on over to our discord and he can join the green room and we'll be taking

02:25:43.240 --> 02:25:47.160
calls there, uh, here shortly. Um, but I do want to read some of these comments from chat while

02:25:47.160 --> 02:25:52.200
we wait for folks to join, uh, cause it's a very kind words there for Sakurai. Um, actdeft in chat

02:25:52.200 --> 02:25:59.000
says Sakurai is wholesome and we don't deserve him. SSG100 Matt says, let Sakurai sleep. Uh,

02:25:59.480 --> 02:26:04.280
actdeft says Iwata was a mentor to Sakurai, almost a father figure. You know, you have to remember

02:26:04.280 --> 02:26:09.560
Satoru Iwata kind of worked his way up too. I mean, he balloon fight. Hello. That was him.

02:26:09.560 --> 02:26:14.920
And he worked on other games as well. And then DarkSakuraOLR in chat says Sakurai also has good

02:26:14.920 --> 02:26:20.920
hair. True. He does. He does. He doesn't really just really good hair. He does. Yeah. Yeah. I

02:26:20.920 --> 02:26:26.920
wish I had Sakurai's hair, but I don't genetics. They're a bitch. What? Very fashionable. True.

02:26:26.920 --> 02:26:31.000
But you know what? I really like hats. Do you like my hat today? By the way, I don't know if

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:34.600
it's, I don't know if it's coming through on Twitch very well, but it's a, it's a rainbow

02:26:34.600 --> 02:26:41.080
Pikachu hat. Uh, and I thought it was appropriate for community day today. Um, I'm almost embarrassed

02:26:41.080 --> 02:26:47.320
to say I got it at Spencer gifts, believe it or not. They were having a deal on hats. It was like,

02:26:47.320 --> 02:26:52.280
buy one, get one free. So I bought this hat and I bought one. I haven't worn on stream yet. Should

02:26:52.280 --> 02:27:00.200
I say what it is? Do it. It's a Waluigi hat. So I'll wear that on a future stream. I do changing

02:27:00.200 --> 02:27:05.480
the colors of it, but I have hair because I get bored. Yeah. I picked up a wild stallion shirt

02:27:05.480 --> 02:27:12.520
this week. Wild stallions. I haven't gotten it yet. You knew this shirt. This is the same one

02:27:12.520 --> 02:27:17.640
that Keanu Reeves had on this Sonic shirt that I'm wearing. You know where I got this shirt at a

02:27:17.640 --> 02:27:24.440
store target. I believe it. Yeah, I know. It's like crazy. So yeah, you can get some, because

02:27:24.440 --> 02:27:28.920
there's there, they're clearing out the pride stuff. I almost got one of those sequence shirts.

02:27:28.920 --> 02:27:32.440
Oh really? I want to get two of them and make it into a dress. I was going to say,

02:27:32.440 --> 02:27:35.880
I'm surprised you're not buying some of those things just to like get crafty and make your

02:27:35.880 --> 02:27:39.640
own thing. I'm kind of thinking of it, but I'm not that good at the seamstress yet. So I don't know

02:27:39.640 --> 02:27:46.360
how to sew around the sequence. Gotcha. It's a bummer that my good pal Aria snark lives so far

02:27:46.360 --> 02:27:51.000
away. Cause that's the seamstress. I have friends that are costumers. That's good. One of my,

02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:55.640
one of the other sisters is actually doing a quilt raffle. We're actually gonna be raffling

02:27:55.640 --> 02:28:01.480
out another quilt going on this labeled any way you turn it. Love is love is love is love is love.

02:28:01.480 --> 02:28:07.880
I love that. And it's all hearts, heart patches that were donated. I have a completely random

02:28:07.880 --> 02:28:10.440
question. I swear we'll get to the phone calls and we'll go back to video games. This is just

02:28:10.440 --> 02:28:13.480
something I was stewing on. And maybe since you're involved with sisters, you might know the answer

02:28:13.480 --> 02:28:19.240
to this. So, you know, we, we talk about like acronyms in LGBT, right? You know, there's LGBT,

02:28:19.240 --> 02:28:24.840
there's LGBTQ plus. Some people call it queer, but not everybody's cool with that. Cause there's

02:28:24.840 --> 02:28:29.400
a negative connotation of that word. Some people do the G first. Right. Yeah. Well, yeah, I've

02:28:29.400 --> 02:28:35.960
seen GLBT. Sure. Um, but here's my question. Why did the acronym quilt bag never catch on?

02:28:35.960 --> 02:28:39.960
Because it's all the same letters. You're the only person I've ever heard say it. Really? Yeah.

02:28:39.960 --> 02:28:44.840
I swear I've heard it somewhere else too. And I always love that because I love that

02:28:44.840 --> 02:28:49.800
image of a quilt that it's like all these different. I don't know. I will switch

02:28:49.800 --> 02:28:55.560
personally between using queer and LGBTQ a plus. I understand some people are really hesitant to

02:28:55.560 --> 02:29:01.480
use queer though, because, you know, I, and when I was in grade school, kids would play that game

02:29:01.480 --> 02:29:06.040
called smear the queer. Right. And so it has a lot of negative. And I think some people are still

02:29:06.040 --> 02:29:10.840
trying to kind of like figure that word out a little bit. Like it's still very negative for

02:29:10.840 --> 02:29:16.200
some people. My whole thing is that the words have the power that we give them. I mean,

02:29:16.200 --> 02:29:24.680
what bugs me is that there are words used for women and women's parts that are used very

02:29:24.680 --> 02:29:30.600
negatively. I am very much against the word fish used in the drag community because the origin of

02:29:30.600 --> 02:29:34.920
fish comes from an insult for the way that a woman's privates can smell if it's not washed.

02:29:35.720 --> 02:29:40.920
And to say something is fish is to use an insulting term toward women. I will not use it.

02:29:40.920 --> 02:29:46.920
I will not allow it to be used around me. That being said, there are women who are reclaiming

02:29:46.920 --> 02:29:56.440
the term to use for, for strength. I think that taking a word that has such trauma and stigma

02:29:56.440 --> 02:30:02.840
attached to it and turning it around to be something positive and good, because I mean,

02:30:03.560 --> 02:30:09.880
queer in its dictionary definition is just different outside the usual.

02:30:10.760 --> 02:30:16.440
If we take that and make it mean something that is normal, that's reclaiming the use of the word.

02:30:16.440 --> 02:30:20.280
And I have no problem with it, especially for people like me who are pretty much unicorns.

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:26.440
You know, I am an asexual woman. Bisexual people are getting a lot more accepted that are still

02:30:26.440 --> 02:30:31.240
kind of on that unicorn spectrum of erasure. Bisexual people also have to deal with the whole

02:30:31.240 --> 02:30:36.360
like, you know, oh, you're just loose, you know, like, and then all that kind of garbage,

02:30:36.360 --> 02:30:42.520
you know, or like, you know, we have a mutual friend who was in a relationship with a woman

02:30:42.520 --> 02:30:48.120
and then married a man that doesn't suddenly make her less bi. Right. Right. Yeah. You know,

02:30:49.080 --> 02:30:53.800
or intersex people get left out a lot. The non gender conforming get left out a lot.

02:30:54.360 --> 02:31:00.600
You know, I think that having a blanket term, we're all outside of what society deems to be

02:31:00.600 --> 02:31:07.800
normal. We are the unicorns. We should be helping each other instead of trying to gatekeep on who's

02:31:07.800 --> 02:31:12.280
more queer than someone else. Oh, I like that. We're all the unicorns. You're all that on a

02:31:12.280 --> 02:31:18.120
shirt. Although I still feel a little bit more mythical. Yeah. We're all the unicorns, but not

02:31:18.680 --> 02:31:22.920
in the never ending story because that I can't handle it. Anyway, that there wasn't a unicorn

02:31:22.920 --> 02:31:26.840
in the never ending story. Oh no, it was just a horse. Wasn't it? Our text was a horse. Or am

02:31:26.840 --> 02:31:33.800
I thinking of- Did you see that cosplay? I saw that at Dragon Con. Yes, I did. That was

02:31:33.800 --> 02:31:38.280
something else. That was some genius there. Yeah, it is. No, the sad unicorns are the ones in

02:31:38.280 --> 02:31:42.840
legend that got killed. That, okay. I crossed my eighties movies. Okay. Yeah. Cause that's the

02:31:42.840 --> 02:31:45.960
scene you still won't watch. I remember you talked about that. And Pixel Pacas, I'll tell you this.

02:31:46.520 --> 02:31:50.600
Pixel Pacas says, I feel like the term is being reclaimed, being reclaimed is totally fine.

02:31:50.600 --> 02:31:55.800
I, but I don't feel comfortable using it for myself. That's fine. Oh yeah. I know. Like,

02:31:55.800 --> 02:32:02.120
well, when it comes to the word fancy ass guy, take that as an acronym. Some

02:32:03.240 --> 02:32:06.600
guys like to use that as a term of empowerment. I'm a little,

02:32:08.440 --> 02:32:14.120
I don't know. I don't know how I feel about it. It was funny enough. And this happened at Dragon

02:32:14.120 --> 02:32:18.920
Con. A queen actually came up to me and said, you are a fish as fuck. And I'm like, that's because

02:32:18.920 --> 02:32:27.320
I have a real vagina. And she's like, oh, I thought you were kind of short. You know what

02:32:27.320 --> 02:32:31.080
though here? Okay. This is like totally tangent train. I'm sorry, but you know, we're getting

02:32:31.080 --> 02:32:34.760
towards the end of the show. Deal with it. I feel like you and I need a show where like,

02:32:34.760 --> 02:32:38.040
throughout the week when serious questions we have come up, like the one I just thought it,

02:32:38.040 --> 02:32:41.320
we just need to write it down, put it in a jar. And like each episode we just take something out

02:32:41.320 --> 02:32:46.280
of the jar and like have a serious fucking like discussion about doing because it's us. I know,

02:32:46.280 --> 02:32:49.960
but like, I feel like there's a little, like there's a little more purpose here.

02:32:49.960 --> 02:32:53.640
That was very like, what? It doesn't have a purpose. That's the, you know,

02:32:53.640 --> 02:33:01.800
but like, I feel like Robin, Jamie, explain it all or try, try Robin, Jamie, try, insert, try

02:33:02.360 --> 02:33:05.400
to explain to them. Oh my God. That would be great. And then the, the logo could just be

02:33:05.400 --> 02:33:12.680
that star when in comic sans Robin, Jamie tried. Yeah. I like that. We might have to do that.

02:33:13.560 --> 02:33:17.800
Yeah. That's it. Robin, Jamie tried. Okay. This is happening. Y'all eventually.

02:33:18.360 --> 02:33:21.800
You like that. You want to guest on this show? Loki, Robin, Jamie tried.

02:33:21.800 --> 02:33:26.680
Sure. Why not? Well, I am planning on doing a sister podcast that is coming around,

02:33:26.680 --> 02:33:30.920
but I think it would be great. I mean, cause I want to do things to talk about the special

02:33:30.920 --> 02:33:36.120
needs that sisters have. Cause I mean, we support so much in our fucking communities,

02:33:36.120 --> 02:33:41.320
but what supports us, right? And there's lots of, there's some fight and there's some drama.

02:33:41.400 --> 02:33:48.200
You cannot have people in a queer community that ain't got some drama. Just saying. So I'm trying

02:33:48.200 --> 02:33:52.120
to do something for that, but I would absolutely love to have them read, just sit and talk this

02:33:52.120 --> 02:33:57.000
shit about the stuff that's going on. Okay. We're going to plan it. Do you want, would you be willing

02:33:57.000 --> 02:34:01.880
to do it a video show so we can like premiere it on VOG? Do like a geek? I guess. All right.

02:34:03.240 --> 02:34:08.920
Okay. All right. I want to make Bobby perk up. I'm making content. We'll do this show while I'm

02:34:08.920 --> 02:34:15.240
doing my makeup. Yeah, sure. Why not? Why not? You can, you can do your makeup. I guess we have

02:34:15.240 --> 02:34:18.840
to be doing something different every show. What would I be doing? I'll learn needle point. You'll

02:34:18.840 --> 02:34:22.760
learn needle point. All right. I'll teach you how to crochet. Oh, I'll do Perler beads. I can do

02:34:22.760 --> 02:34:26.760
those. I have a bunch of Perler beads I hadn't used in a while. Yeah, we'll do Perler. That

02:34:26.760 --> 02:34:30.440
would be great because then we could like, I could give away the Perler beads. So it's arts

02:34:30.440 --> 02:34:36.040
and crafts and chat. I love that. And we tried. I'm going to fuck up. Sometimes you're going to

02:34:36.040 --> 02:34:41.400
fuck up. I actually want to learn needle point. Cause I went, I have a linen apron and I just

02:34:41.400 --> 02:34:47.080
wanted to say kitchen bitch and then have the B slashed out and do a W over it. That's funny.

02:34:47.080 --> 02:34:50.200
You talk about that. Cause I've been on a good place binge this past week. I've never watched

02:34:50.200 --> 02:34:56.680
that show. So I want a shirt that says dress bitch so bad. Or, um, what was, Oh God, what was

02:34:56.680 --> 02:35:04.840
the one help somebody it's season three when Chidi has a moment and he goes, he goes to the store

02:35:04.840 --> 02:35:09.960
and he takes it that they're like, sir, you have to wear a shirt right now. I have no fucking clue

02:35:09.960 --> 02:35:16.280
what he's talking about. He takes the shirt and it says, Oh my God. Oh wait. Is Shane texting me?

02:35:21.640 --> 02:35:28.680
It says who, what, where, when wine, I would wear that. Thank you, Shane. I would wear that.

02:35:29.640 --> 02:35:33.560
Sorry. That's too good. That's like fucking I'm sitting here blanking.

02:35:33.560 --> 02:35:36.440
Don't you wish you could do that in the real world? Like you're just there and you're like,

02:35:36.440 --> 02:35:39.080
try to like, you're at a meeting. You're like, I forgot what I was going to say.

02:35:39.080 --> 02:35:42.520
And then suddenly like God texts you and it's just, Oh, there's the answer.

02:35:42.520 --> 02:35:45.000
Seriously. Still want a shirt that says Jenna clock.

02:35:46.360 --> 02:35:49.960
All right. Uh, let's move on. Poor Rama has been singing there like,

02:35:49.960 --> 02:35:53.880
okay, Ron, for like 15 minutes while we're sitting here talking about

02:35:54.520 --> 02:35:57.320
everything else under the sun. Hi Rama. How are you?

02:35:58.040 --> 02:36:03.480
I'm fine, Rob. How are you? I'm great. Now that I remembered what that fucking shirt said,

02:36:03.480 --> 02:36:08.840
and now that we've had our queer discussion, one Oh one chat, but maybe you have a video game or

02:36:08.840 --> 02:36:15.000
two you'd like to talk about. I just want to say, I kind of feel bad cause I'm sitting here waiting

02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:20.520
and the chat's going and I'm like, I'm like randomly unmuting the show so I can hear what's

02:36:20.520 --> 02:36:25.800
going on. So that when you pick up the call, there's no feedback, you know? So I'm just trying

02:36:25.960 --> 02:36:30.280
to figure yourself out pro tip because I actually do this to monitor as well.

02:36:30.280 --> 02:36:33.160
So I'm going to give you a little inside baseball, what happens behind the scene.

02:36:33.160 --> 02:36:37.880
So I think everybody is figured out behind the scenes a little bit, actually. Okay. You know

02:36:37.880 --> 02:36:42.120
what? I'm in a real fuck it mode tonight and we'll, we'll do and do things a little unprofessional.

02:36:42.120 --> 02:36:46.360
Jamie, since you're right by the camera, would you tilt it just a little bit so that they can see the

02:36:46.360 --> 02:36:50.760
TV and they can actually see, thank you. You're going to have to set it back. Okay. So you can

02:36:50.760 --> 02:36:56.440
actually see, we have a TV that's here that actually lets us see like ourselves. So we know

02:36:56.440 --> 02:37:00.600
what's going out on the stream and we can see like the discord and all of that stuff that actually,

02:37:00.600 --> 02:37:06.360
um, goes, goes on out there. Um, so yeah, no, you're fine. That's, that's how it goes back.

02:37:06.360 --> 02:37:13.000
So it's like, it's just like sitting just barely off there. So usually before OLR starts Bobby

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:16.920
Black Wolf, we have the VOG network Twitch up there on the TV. It also gave me a chance to

02:37:16.920 --> 02:37:21.960
fix this corner of the tripod that was like about to fall off. It's been bothering me all night.

02:37:22.600 --> 02:37:28.600
Um, so we're usually watching Bobby Black Wolf on the TV, but when, when he does that call to us,

02:37:28.600 --> 02:37:34.760
we turn him off so that we can take the call, but we never put him back on because if he's on this

02:37:34.760 --> 02:37:39.560
computer, then that audio is going to go out when we take the feed. So what we do, and my point is,

02:37:39.560 --> 02:37:46.520
what we do is then I move the feed to the mobile phone and I watch on my mobile until he's done.

02:37:46.600 --> 02:37:51.800
And then that way I'm, I'm able to quickly turn it off and start the feed. So my pro tip is if

02:37:51.800 --> 02:37:55.800
you're sitting there on hold waiting, use your mobile phone to still, and then that way you're

02:37:55.800 --> 02:38:01.160
not going to get the feedback. Hold on. I forgot the horns apparently. Oh, okay. According to act

02:38:01.160 --> 02:38:05.400
deaf. So I had to throw up some horns. All right. Little look behind the scenes there. I'm sure. I

02:38:05.400 --> 02:38:08.920
think all you knew there was like a TV or some type of monitor here. Cause you can usually,

02:38:08.920 --> 02:38:13.800
we're just staring off and see us looking at it. We're really bad about that. I mean,

02:38:14.280 --> 02:38:20.360
sorry. In the, I have watched some Japanese Pokemon, so I have in the brain instead of me.

02:38:20.360 --> 02:38:26.120
Well, I'm hoping in a future studio, I'm hoping what is going to happen is that the TV will

02:38:26.120 --> 02:38:34.120
actually be there behind Jamie or next to Jamie. So we can see it, but then, well, I'm hoping that

02:38:34.120 --> 02:38:41.160
by then I'll have a 4k TV. So we'll have two TVs. So that's, but that's pie in the sky future

02:38:42.040 --> 02:38:45.000
improvements, et cetera. But that's not what Rama wanted to talk about.

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:46.920
Of course, as she went under Matt, just clip that.

02:38:47.800 --> 02:38:48.520
What's up Rama?

02:38:49.160 --> 02:38:53.800
I will say that's how I kind of have my setup when I do my stream, but, um, a couple of things

02:38:53.800 --> 02:39:00.680
now I've been reading about the whole GameStop closing stores. And normally I would sit here

02:39:00.680 --> 02:39:08.520
and laugh and be like, sucks to be you guys, but I think I I've matured somewhat. So I'm more like,

02:39:08.520 --> 02:39:13.560
well, maybe they do things differently because I have been saying for the longest time,

02:39:13.560 --> 02:39:19.960
what GameStop needs to do is start closing two stores that are between each other,

02:39:19.960 --> 02:39:26.040
find a location and between those stores, make it larger and make it sort of like a boutique

02:39:26.040 --> 02:39:31.080
X store. Because to be perfectly honest, when I walk into GameStop, it's almost like walking into

02:39:31.960 --> 02:39:37.080
a good, the Goodwill of video games. You walk in, there's shelves of games here,

02:39:37.080 --> 02:39:43.400
there's clothing there, there's merch there, there's geeks. It's just like a giant mess.

02:39:44.360 --> 02:39:48.920
You know, and I think when you talk about the whole like maturing and all that stuff,

02:39:48.920 --> 02:39:53.720
I think it's a similar perspective maybe to like where I was saying earlier. And I think, I think,

02:39:53.720 --> 02:39:58.920
Matt and Jamie are on a similar page where it's like, this story is a little harder to sit here

02:39:58.920 --> 02:40:03.640
and make fun of and like LOL GameStop, because you kind of realize the people who are really

02:40:03.640 --> 02:40:08.680
impacted by this are those workers that are really just trying to like pay their way at,

02:40:08.680 --> 02:40:12.760
you know, and get the job experience and so forth. And you kind of feel bad for them. Like,

02:40:12.760 --> 02:40:17.320
because this whole thing has been mismanaged for a while, and we all kind of know that,

02:40:17.320 --> 02:40:23.160
like you just kind of feel bad for those people that are just trying to have a fucking job. You

02:40:23.160 --> 02:40:27.000
know what I mean? I think that's where my head's at. Yeah, because I have a couple of friends who

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:32.520
are managers and yes, even they know they are asshole employees and so forth. And you know,

02:40:32.520 --> 02:40:38.120
I don't even talk about GameStop like in a negative aspect anymore. I just feel like,

02:40:38.120 --> 02:40:42.120
you know, they got a job to do. I totally get it. I've been on the other side of that,

02:40:42.120 --> 02:40:46.200
but I know if I want to go get good service, I know a couple of stores I can travel to,

02:40:46.200 --> 02:40:52.360
to get the best service. But you know what? Those who bust their asses in retail to give you the

02:40:52.360 --> 02:40:57.560
best service, they don't really get the attention that you deserve as opposed to 9,000 out of 10,

02:40:57.560 --> 02:41:01.320
it's more people complaining about the bad service instead of the good service, you know?

02:41:03.400 --> 02:41:09.720
I totally, I know how it is. And that's customer service in general. We can go on a whole tangent

02:41:09.720 --> 02:41:13.800
with that, how you remember the bad shit, but you know, the good shit doesn't always stick out as

02:41:13.800 --> 02:41:19.400
much, but well, that stuff does too. Like I think there's probably a restaurant you go to more often

02:41:19.400 --> 02:41:23.400
than others because you just really like some of the staff that works there. But anyway, I digress.

02:41:23.400 --> 02:41:26.040
Now I stopped working retail the moment I get held up at gunpoint.

02:41:27.480 --> 02:41:29.400
Well, yeah, that's a pretty-

02:41:29.400 --> 02:41:30.920
At a GN fucking C.

02:41:30.920 --> 02:41:33.160
But you know, that's kind of like an outlier type of experience too.

02:41:33.160 --> 02:41:34.600
Yeah, but at a GMC.

02:41:34.600 --> 02:41:36.600
Yeah. No, I know. No place is immune.

02:41:37.400 --> 02:41:41.880
To back up what Jamie said, that actually happened to a friend of mine about two years ago working at

02:41:42.680 --> 02:41:49.480
AT&T flagship store. Yeah, she worked about four months afterwards. Cause you know,

02:41:50.280 --> 02:41:53.960
to be perfectly honest, when you've been in retail for so long, it takes a while to make

02:41:53.960 --> 02:41:58.520
that adjustment from the retail sector to the private sector, you know, trying to find

02:41:59.080 --> 02:42:03.960
where, what type of job that you fit in and so forth, your skillset. Like I said,

02:42:03.960 --> 02:42:08.760
I got lucky being in IT my entire life. So I was able to make that jump a lot easier than others.

02:42:10.520 --> 02:42:13.880
It's so funny. You're talking about like this whole like private sector and stuff.

02:42:13.880 --> 02:42:15.960
I'm going to text you something cause I don't want to stay on here.

02:42:15.960 --> 02:42:23.800
I went, I went from mortgage servicing to IT and honestly, I love IT so much more.

02:42:24.920 --> 02:42:25.480
Yeah.

02:42:26.760 --> 02:42:28.040
Anything else on your mind, my friend?

02:42:29.240 --> 02:42:33.880
Can I talk a little gaming nerdy romance for a bit?

02:42:35.080 --> 02:42:39.160
Duh, of course, please. Is it going to be, is it going to be the Musk game?

02:42:39.800 --> 02:42:43.480
No, this is, this is actually ties into Castle Crashers.

02:42:45.960 --> 02:42:50.840
So I haven't really said, but I've been dating somebody for about, let's say about two,

02:42:50.840 --> 02:42:56.680
three months. And when she came to visit, we were hanging out gaming and she noticed I had

02:42:56.680 --> 02:43:03.720
Castle Crashers. So I'm like, she's like getting a little excited and I didn't realize that's like

02:43:03.720 --> 02:43:08.360
one of her all time favorite games. So while she was here, we played Castle Crashers.

02:43:08.360 --> 02:43:14.920
And I said, you know, I got free time on Sundays, so we should make it our gaming night. Now, due

02:43:14.920 --> 02:43:22.280
to us having odd schedules on the weekends, we couldn't do it until like tonight. Cause she was

02:43:22.280 --> 02:43:25.800
not in the best of mood. So I said, you know what, if you're feeling up to it,

02:43:25.800 --> 02:43:29.480
let's jump on live, play Castle Crashers, kind of get away from it all.

02:43:30.120 --> 02:43:36.280
So I, she goes, I got the game up and running, jump on it. I go and I fire up the game and I'm

02:43:36.280 --> 02:43:41.320
not seeing her. I didn't realize till tonight, there was a Castle Crashers remastered and she

02:43:41.320 --> 02:43:46.680
was on that one. I'm running, I'm playing the backwards compatible one. So I'm like, well,

02:43:46.680 --> 02:43:52.200
I'm kind of short on funds at the moment. So let me see what I can do. So while I'm looking up,

02:43:52.600 --> 02:43:57.800
how much it costs, and then I see the deal for the upgrade, she pings me a messenger with a code.

02:43:58.920 --> 02:44:04.760
She bought me Castle Crashers remastered just so we could game together. And I'm just sitting there

02:44:05.320 --> 02:44:11.800
stunned. I'm just like, you did what? She's like, that's sweet. You're going to buy her dinner.

02:44:12.840 --> 02:44:18.440
I've already bought her dinner. I bought her some cute stuff. So, you know, I've been spoiling her

02:44:18.440 --> 02:44:24.200
and she spoiled me. And here's the part that kind of also blew my mind. After we played,

02:44:24.200 --> 02:44:30.920
she sends me a picture of her with her gaming headset and she's wearing a Sailor Mars shirt.

02:44:30.920 --> 02:44:36.360
And I'm just looking at her like that shirt. And she's like, what do you mean? I sent her a picture

02:44:36.360 --> 02:44:42.200
of me with my headphones and I'm wearing the Venus version of that shirt, same artist,

02:44:42.200 --> 02:44:46.920
but two different send sheets. So we were like, we are on the same hive mind or something. So,

02:44:46.920 --> 02:44:56.200
you know, nerdy love in a nutshell. I love this story. I want regular updates on this story.

02:44:58.440 --> 02:45:04.520
Well, you'll be getting some updates. Um, we do have some future couple cosplays planned

02:45:04.520 --> 02:45:15.160
coming down the line. So you know, couple cosplay. Yes. I love it. I can't wait to

02:45:15.160 --> 02:45:21.960
keep making fun of you. Go right ahead. You know, but it's funny, you know, and, you know,

02:45:22.760 --> 02:45:27.320
we go a ways back. We met in the same fandom, Ranma what have, and it's like,

02:45:29.240 --> 02:45:37.880
she knows what Dan and I met. Yeah. Well, in town square Sailor Moon over our love of Ranma,

02:45:37.880 --> 02:45:41.960
you know, that's how Alan and I met in town square Sailor Moon over your love of Ranma.

02:45:41.960 --> 02:45:43.960
No, we actually didn't meet that way at all, but it sounded good.

02:45:45.720 --> 02:45:52.280
But what's cool is that we've met in the same fandom, but she is, she's like, she's my Midwest

02:45:52.280 --> 02:45:57.960
Ucchan. Cause I said to her, I already have an Ucchan. She gets that title cause we're,

02:45:58.600 --> 02:46:02.120
that's how it goes. And she's like, okay, I'm cool with that. So, you know,

02:46:02.120 --> 02:46:08.360
so now I got two awesome Ucchans in my life. That's so cute. I love it. All right. Well,

02:46:08.360 --> 02:46:14.040
sadly I do have to move on cause we have to wrap up here pretty soon, but I look forward to

02:46:14.040 --> 02:46:18.440
hearing from you again and hearing what other games y'all are playing together in the future.

02:46:18.440 --> 02:46:23.320
I will say this video games are fun cause you mentioned she's in the Midwest. So obviously

02:46:23.320 --> 02:46:28.600
you got some long distance thing going on there. I will mention video games are awesome for like

02:46:28.600 --> 02:46:33.080
bridging that, especially in this day and age with the multiplayer games. Um, because, you know,

02:46:33.080 --> 02:46:36.920
Alan and I, we weren't really long distance. We were like mid distance. Okay. He lived in South

02:46:36.920 --> 02:46:41.480
San Francisco. I lived up here in Sacramento. That's about a hundred, 120 miles apart. So like

02:46:41.480 --> 02:46:46.920
doable on the weekend, but not really doable during the week. So we played a lot of world

02:46:46.920 --> 02:46:50.680
Warcraft back in the day and it was like, we would go party and questing together and stuff.

02:46:50.680 --> 02:46:58.360
It was really like he had his Albear or Moonkin or whatever. Yeah. So, uh, video games,

02:46:58.360 --> 02:47:05.560
they bring people together. I love it. All right, Rama. Okay. I got to go. Cause I'm still kind of

02:47:05.720 --> 02:47:09.240
shocked slash blushing over this whole thing. I'm just like, I got to get back to my,

02:47:09.240 --> 02:47:16.200
my semi normal moody self, you know? I love it. All right. Well have fun blushing.

02:47:18.360 --> 02:47:24.440
Okay. Take care, buddy. Bye. Bye. Ah, so good to hear from Rama. And I love that I had no,

02:47:24.440 --> 02:47:28.280
am I just behind on social media? I had no idea that that was like a thing that was going on.

02:47:28.280 --> 02:47:34.040
I knew you knew, but we talked. Yeah, that's fair. And I I've been really out of the loop between

02:47:34.920 --> 02:47:39.320
going out of town for so long for dragon con coming back and having to wrap everything up

02:47:39.320 --> 02:47:42.680
at my last job and then immediately start a new job where I was out of town for a week.

02:47:42.680 --> 02:47:47.160
Like I've just been out of it y'all. So. Apologies if I've been behind on social media,

02:47:47.160 --> 02:47:51.000
if you like got married or something and I forgot to congratulate you or you had a baby or something,

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:54.440
like just send me a message and I'll give you your belated congratulations. You didn't like

02:47:54.440 --> 02:47:57.880
have another baby or anything. Did you? No, I didn't have anything like that happened this week.

02:47:58.040 --> 02:48:04.200
Besides that Nelly had the babies. You know what I mean? No, I didn't do any of that.

02:48:04.200 --> 02:48:10.040
Why are you laughing? Did something happen this week? Yeah. You mentioned it on Twitter.

02:48:14.440 --> 02:48:22.680
What happened this week? I started a new job. No. You did. I remember replying to you about

02:48:22.680 --> 02:48:29.560
something. You'll figure it out eventually. That is the worst possible fucking thing you

02:48:29.560 --> 02:48:34.360
can say to somebody that has like no fucking memory in the world. Now I'm on the spot here.

02:48:34.360 --> 02:48:38.200
Hold on. I'm looking because there was something Logie tweeted about and I was like,

02:48:39.080 --> 02:48:43.400
Oh God, I just went through the 20 tweet thread of my friend that was watching

02:48:44.120 --> 02:48:50.520
kidnapped in plain or what is that? Abducted in plain sight. That was it for the very first time.

02:48:51.480 --> 02:48:58.520
Oh my God. It was your fucking birthday earlier this week. And I'd forgot to say

02:48:58.520 --> 02:49:05.480
something on the show last week. I'm such an asshole. Happy birthday. I remember. Look,

02:49:05.480 --> 02:49:11.880
here's the thing. Loki's birthday. Very hard to forget. So I said, well, I was also busy making

02:49:11.880 --> 02:49:17.480
myself sad. His birthday. I had no problem. So I'm not that forgetful. I did say happy birthday on

02:49:17.480 --> 02:49:22.200
the birthday and tweet about it. But that was like Tuesday and today is Sunday. Tuesday might

02:49:22.200 --> 02:49:27.400
as well have been like 500 years ago. Like it's just, that's how fast things move. What did you

02:49:27.400 --> 02:49:32.280
get to do for your birthday? Um, I didn't really do anything on my birthday, but we went to being

02:49:32.280 --> 02:49:38.920
honest. Like you do. That's a great reward. Did you get the fried rice? Yeah. God, that's the best

02:49:38.920 --> 02:49:45.320
stuff in the world. I haven't eaten at Benihana. I will point out only like only like two people

02:49:45.320 --> 02:49:54.360
in chat caught on. So y'all are just as dumb as I am. I'm trying to redeem these keys for

02:49:54.360 --> 02:49:59.720
Borderlands three, but their site is just, I was wondering what that website was. It looked like,

02:49:59.720 --> 02:50:04.120
well, like, okay. So I went in and I had registered like earlier and then it linked,

02:50:04.120 --> 02:50:09.320
it created a whole new profile attached to my other email address. So I was like, okay,

02:50:09.320 --> 02:50:14.200
well that's not the one I use for Borderlands. So that's not going to work. So I have to redeem all

02:50:14.200 --> 02:50:19.880
the keys again. Did you, did, uh, did the kids get you anything for your birthday?

02:50:19.880 --> 02:50:26.280
No, no, no gaming stuff. No. What? We got to fix that. Did you buy yourself

02:50:26.280 --> 02:50:30.440
Borderlands three for your birthday? I was just going to buy it anyways. There's that. All right,

02:50:30.440 --> 02:50:33.560
well we gotta, we gotta pull our money together and get you something nice for your birthday.

02:50:34.120 --> 02:50:39.480
All right. Pod culture says I didn't catch it and my birthday is the day before Loki's.

02:50:39.480 --> 02:50:43.480
Thank you and happy belated to you as well. Pod culture. I hope you had a great day.

02:50:43.480 --> 02:50:48.520
So good. Um, SG100 Matt says, I also didn't say happy birthday on Loki's Facebook,

02:50:48.520 --> 02:50:52.920
but I don't go on it anymore. Fair. Excuse me. Happy birthday, Loki. Thank you. So there you go.

02:50:53.480 --> 02:50:57.160
It's just another, right? You hit a certain point where it's like, eh, it's just another year.

02:50:57.160 --> 02:51:03.160
Was this year 38 or 39? 39. Oh, so the big ones next year. So are you gonna do anything for 40?

02:51:03.800 --> 02:51:09.800
I don't know. Right answer. All right. Anyhow. Uh, I think that's gonna about wrap it up. Well,

02:51:09.800 --> 02:51:13.240
actually I do want to check if there are any last minute stories, uh, real quick here. I

02:51:13.720 --> 02:51:19.240
uh, caught anything for, uh, any other things people want to talk about Loki or dark Sakura

02:51:19.240 --> 02:51:23.240
with last minute stories. Not a thing from law. No, I forgot to put a box for last minute

02:51:23.240 --> 02:51:27.480
stories tonight. Whoops. Oh, Wells. I don't think we have any. So do you have anything?

02:51:28.440 --> 02:51:32.600
No, but now won't let me, I guess. Oh, I, okay. I get what's going on here. Cause I was like

02:51:32.600 --> 02:51:40.040
trying to redeem this and it, it did what I needed it to do, but it, it's just a weird,

02:51:40.120 --> 02:51:45.960
so yes, I got all my golden keys still and maybe two weapons because apparently they link.

02:51:45.960 --> 02:51:50.840
Cause I linked my Epic account to both of them. I had to unlink it from one. So

02:51:52.920 --> 02:51:56.840
I don't know. It's stupid. Uh, what level are you? Borderlands three.

02:51:56.840 --> 02:52:00.440
Oh, I'm like three. I haven't, I've only played for like a couple hours. Yeah. Well,

02:52:00.440 --> 02:52:03.400
hopefully you get to play some more. I almost don't want to play Zane anymore.

02:52:03.400 --> 02:52:06.840
I kind of want to play as the beast master again, but I can always play the game again.

02:52:06.840 --> 02:52:11.800
All right. Um, well, uh, any final thoughts, I guess, uh, we'll go around and get final thoughts.

02:52:11.800 --> 02:52:16.440
Oh, I did. I'm sorry. I did have one last minute, sir. Real quick. Um, so there's this,

02:52:16.440 --> 02:52:21.320
luckily it's your birthday, so I'll let it slide. There's this, uh, project that's being worked on

02:52:21.320 --> 02:52:28.040
called project 1999 green. It's going to be released October 25th. And what is it? You may

02:52:28.040 --> 02:52:36.680
ask? Well, it is Charlie XCX and a Troye Sivan collaboration. No, it is the original version

02:52:36.680 --> 02:52:42.840
of EverQuest. They are putting a, um, some fans are putting together a server that's like

02:52:42.840 --> 02:52:48.920
EverQuest classic. Oh, I was just so like, wow. Classic inspired type of thing. Interesting.

02:52:48.920 --> 02:52:53.080
Yeah. So they're going to, and the servers will then change progress through all of the patches

02:52:53.080 --> 02:52:57.960
in the same timeline as the original launch. So in January, 2020, you get plane of fear,

02:52:57.960 --> 02:53:06.760
April, 2020 plane of hate, uh, may, 2020 temple of the Celeste row. And then legacy items, uh,

02:53:06.760 --> 02:53:15.560
cease to drop November, 2020 ruins of, uh, Knark and 2021 April epics. And it goes on from there.

02:53:15.560 --> 02:53:22.680
Where's final fantasy 11 classic. Am I right? It is still classic. It is. It's still going

02:53:22.680 --> 02:53:30.120
to beta RO to come back just with the fast leveling warp, please. He'll please prompt,

02:53:30.120 --> 02:53:37.480
please prompt, please. One of my favorite pictures ever was when you and I were playing that game

02:53:37.480 --> 02:53:40.760
and we both had our little stars masks on and the characters that you were so cute. We were

02:53:40.760 --> 02:53:45.400
kneeling down next to each other. And I think I had a flower in my hair and a, Oh, it was a bow

02:53:45.400 --> 02:53:49.480
and the stars mask. I was like, I wish we could find that picture playing a priest. I have it

02:53:49.480 --> 02:53:53.640
somewhere on my computer and I think it was playing my assassin. We need to post it on

02:53:53.640 --> 02:53:58.840
social media somewhere. It's tiny. I mean, this was low res cause I think it was like windows 95,

02:53:58.840 --> 02:54:05.240
but still, yeah, I'll find this computer probably could run it. All right. Anyway. All right. Uh,

02:54:05.240 --> 02:54:08.680
that's going to do it for another episode of orange laundry tonight. Thank you guys so much

02:54:08.680 --> 02:54:13.560
for listening to the show, either on the podcast feed, of course, or if you were watching us live

02:54:13.560 --> 02:54:17.480
on Twitch or even in the archives on Twitch, cause you're a subscriber. Thank you so much for your

02:54:17.480 --> 02:54:22.360
support of orange lounge radio. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Um, been having a lot of fun

02:54:22.360 --> 02:54:27.880
these past few weeks and we're marching on, on to episode 800 and, uh, looking at doing some

02:54:27.880 --> 02:54:32.200
retooling of a few segments of the show, uh, which I still have yet to talk to Jamie and Matt about,

02:54:32.200 --> 02:54:36.680
but, uh, I know they have ideas too. So we have some fun stuff in store. Hopefully nothing too

02:54:36.680 --> 02:54:40.120
idea. I don't want you guys to freak out. It's not a big deal, but you know, just once, once in

02:54:40.120 --> 02:54:44.280
a while you got to fluff the pillows, zhuzh it up a little. So that's, that's what we're talking

02:54:44.280 --> 02:54:51.000
about. So anyhow, then pillows be even fluffier out, we'll be sleeping vertical. If you enjoyed

02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:54.200
what you heard here at orange launch radio, please tell a friend or two about the show.

02:54:54.200 --> 02:54:57.160
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

02:54:57.160 --> 02:55:01.400
but the voices have to be here to like put out on the air and stuff. So please

02:55:01.400 --> 02:55:05.720
help us spread the word. Um, we got to go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.

02:55:05.720 --> 02:55:11.880
Uh, dark, Oh, a nice five star review on iTunes goes a long way. Hosts on Twitch are the best.

02:55:11.880 --> 02:55:14.760
So if you have a Twitch account, even if you don't stream that much yourself,

02:55:14.760 --> 02:55:22.840
please consider adding VOG network and Rob Roberts and dark Sakura. I had to and Loki of course,

02:55:22.840 --> 02:55:28.040
to your auto host list, uh, on, but most of all VOG network to your auto host list, because that

02:55:28.040 --> 02:55:32.360
all goes a very, very long way in helping to spread the word. Cause I know I find new streams

02:55:32.360 --> 02:55:36.280
from what my friends are watching. So think about how you might've found this anyway. Uh,

02:55:36.280 --> 02:55:39.000
let's go around and get everybody's final thought. Uh, dark Sakura, since you're,

02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:42.600
you're packing up about ready to get out for the night. Well, if Dan will ever tell me what

02:55:42.600 --> 02:55:46.200
he needs from the freaking grocery store, if he wants to wait to go with me, I mean,

02:55:46.200 --> 02:55:51.960
geez, husband, how hard is it to answer your text messages? You've got car play. I mean, I love you.

02:55:54.040 --> 02:55:58.920
Uh, my final thought is speaking of cars, like I'm even though my current car is not paid off,

02:55:58.920 --> 02:56:03.880
I can't, they're, they're leaving me those flyers, like trade in your car and get a new car. And I'm

02:56:03.880 --> 02:56:09.000
like, Oh, they send those to everybody. I go, of course they do, but I'll be honest though,

02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:14.600
the roller skate is starting to have issues. No, it still makes me go. I kind of want a new car.

02:56:14.600 --> 02:56:19.000
Doesn't Alan want to take over the payments on my car so I can get a new roller skate. I was

02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:23.560
driving by the rink over here and I'm surprised how packed that thing is. Oh yeah. Oh, they do

02:56:23.560 --> 02:56:27.880
like private events and stuff. I think especially like, cause there's a lot of big churches in the

02:56:27.880 --> 02:56:31.960
area and a lot of them will rent it out and do like, you know, teen and kid events. I'm just

02:56:32.200 --> 02:56:38.360
people to suggest cars that are as small as a Fiat, but aren't a smart car or, um, a Chevy spark.

02:56:39.960 --> 02:56:44.760
So, all right. Uh, let's see. I was your final thought. My final thought, your final thought,

02:56:45.560 --> 02:56:49.640
uh, my final thought is hopefully get the place more Borderlands this week and I'm still working

02:56:49.640 --> 02:56:55.400
on my game. I hope so too. Don't forget your cookies. Oh yeah. Those cookies are, I ate

02:56:55.400 --> 02:56:59.800
fucking four cookies, dark soccer. They were really good. So I'm glad you enjoyed. All right,

02:56:59.800 --> 02:57:03.880
we'll see what cookies. I didn't bring them all with me as I have some waiting for me at home.

02:57:03.880 --> 02:57:07.880
We'll see what cookies are in store next week. We will be back next week to do this all again.

02:57:07.880 --> 02:57:11.400
You're still here next week, right? I know there's a show in the near future you're off, but

02:57:11.400 --> 02:57:18.840
that is after I have my surgery. Oh, that's October, right? That is the weekend after.

02:57:18.840 --> 02:57:22.760
Yeah. Cause October is getting crazy cause I have a bunch of hosting gigs, but none of them are on

02:57:22.760 --> 02:57:27.880
Sunday, but that actually may depend on my recovery. So it's a, it's a depends. All right.

02:57:27.880 --> 02:57:31.320
It depends because I have the week off of work after that to recover from my surgery,

02:57:31.320 --> 02:57:35.240
but they say that may only need two days. Oh, cool. All right. Well, we will be back in seven

02:57:35.240 --> 02:57:39.560
days. All of us to do this show all over again, and we hope you'll be joining us at that time.

02:57:39.560 --> 02:57:42.840
Thank you so much for sticking with us for another night of orange launch radio.
