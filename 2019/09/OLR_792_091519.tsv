0	17280	This week, Monster Rancher is getting remastered and coming to the Switch!
17280	21000	The love of my preteen and teenage years, this is one sim game that's possibly just
21000	22240	steeped in nostalgia.
22240	25520	This is just one story, stay tuned for the rest of the week's gaming news starting right
25520	32840	now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
32840	36840	Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where
36840	43200	every gamer has a voice, it is Orange Lounge Radio Live Tonight, episode number 792 for
43200	47260	this September the 15th of 2019.
47260	52600	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me here live tonight is my co-host, Mr. Smoosh, who
52600	61000	is off camera screaming up a storm because Tech Master Loki decided to bring KFC to the
61000	67080	studio tonight and Mr. Smoosh is one entitled kitty who feels that he should get to have
67080	68480	a piece of that chicken.
68480	72920	I think maybe I'll go step away and see to Mr. Smoosh.
72920	77840	Hi DarkSakura or Jamie Summers, I hope you're well.
77840	82440	She's gonna go be a kitty ant right now and take care of Mr. Smoosh.
82440	89960	Okay, here's what's funny about this and why I'm laughing is because Alan, he, okay
89960	94440	apparently, okay, I'm sorry, this is like horrible radio, I'm sorry, this is really
94440	95440	funny what's playing out.
95440	101040	Okay, so number one, Alan is out of town right now, he went to, he went to the Midwest for
101040	105040	a work conference, so he's not here, so he's usually gone during the show anyway because
105040	110000	he does stuff on Sunday nights, but he's usually not here, but Mr. Smoosh is usually has a
110000	114520	shit together because like Alan's around and, you know, able to like take care of him.
114520	119120	But so what happens is that when he's really misbehaving, sometimes we'll put him in the
119120	123200	spare bedroom and we'll shut him in there for, you know, 30 minutes or so and we call
123200	124200	it kitty jail.
124200	125200	Yeah.
125200	129440	And don't worry, we're not cruel, he has water and, you know, he's fine, but like at least
129440	131320	when he's in there, he can't like meow.
131320	135240	But DarkSakura, you said, so DarkSakura is the punisher on Sunday nights.
135240	138480	Yeah, well, he also lets me pick him up for five seconds.
138480	144720	So I guess he likes boobs or something, but at any rate, like I, he, you saw him do this.
144720	150280	He started turning and going down the hall and he went into kitty jail by himself and
150280	152320	all I did was shut the door.
152320	153400	That's pretty amazing.
153400	155040	Like he knows he's in trouble.
155040	157320	He just went into kitty jail of his own.
157320	160300	That's like when we get the carrier, like if he has to go to the vet or something, we'll
160300	161480	put the carrier on the ground.
161480	164320	He just walks right in and he's like, all right, I guess it's time.
164320	165540	Like he's not Midna.
165540	169140	She's such a weird cat, but like in the best possible way, not Midna.
169140	173300	She's like, Oh, is that thing like to the point that, I mean, I'm, I was thinking I
173300	176380	might have to take her to the vet this week cause she started wheezing last night.
176380	177380	Oh no.
177380	179220	Um, but she hasn't done it at all today.
179220	183180	So I think maybe she just got into something or had an allergy attack or something.
183180	188780	Um, but I was just thinking that maybe this time I was just going to take her on her leash
188780	192580	instead of put her in the carrier cause she resists the carrier, but she's okay with her
192580	193580	leash.
193580	195180	I have, I have a harness for my cat.
195180	196580	I take her for walks in the backyard.
196580	197580	Well, I have a harness.
197580	198580	Nevermind.
198580	199580	Uh, all right.
199580	203860	Well, I just ordered a harness, so, but not for that just because it's fashionable.
203860	204860	All right.
204860	207300	It's you were, you were saying you were, it was inspired by K-pop videos.
207300	208300	Yeah, it was.
208300	213300	I just like, I kind of like that aesthetic cause it's kind of like on trend right now
213300	219020	to wear like interesting, like leather accents or harnesses or things, but you wear it over
219020	223140	just like mundane clothes or with something sexy ish.
223140	224140	I don't know.
224140	230260	But I was like, I kind of dig that aesthetic and it would go with some of my gothy stuff
230260	233380	and I could wear it for sister outings if we go to the bolt or something.
233380	234380	I don't know.
234380	237220	Not that I'm into that, but I figured it would dress appropriately for a leather bar.
237220	238220	Yes.
238220	239220	Good.
239220	240220	All right.
240220	241220	You just, you just dress dress into impressing.
241220	244220	Uh, going to our chat room because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at the
244220	246660	voice of geeks network, twitch TV slash bog network.
246660	248700	Yes, it is a video game podcast.
248700	253680	You can see the video game topics along there on the side if you're watching live, but sometimes
253680	256100	the cat derails us in the first five minutes of the show.
256100	259960	Um, some of the comments in our chat over at twitch TV slash bog network, tiger claw
259960	262140	says Mr. Smoosh is quite the diva.
262140	265260	Um, pod culture says, damn, that's a loud smoosh.
265260	266260	Try sleeping around here.
266260	268140	I have to sleep with earplugs.
268140	269140	I know.
269140	270780	Oh, don't encourage him.
270780	271780	Um, let's see.
271780	276020	Dark Tetsuya says five minutes in and smoosh has already derailed everything.
276020	277020	Love it.
277020	278020	Yeah, you, you love it, but poof.
278340	279340	All right.
279340	280340	Anyway.
280340	281340	Uh, and it's all his fault.
281340	282340	Seriously.
282340	286900	He is loud and shrill for bringing that a KFC that smelled up the room and he felt entitled
286900	287900	to it, but that's okay.
287900	291180	I, I, I meow a lot at the scent of KFC as well.
291180	292300	Say hello to tech master Loki.
292300	297220	I didn't want KFC, but the other place in it would have gone to the Korean oven chicken
297220	298220	fried chicken.
298220	301940	Yeah, they were being special today.
301940	306540	So they, they had their, they weren't answering their phone, which was inconvenient for me.
306580	308340	They were like closed to that being closed.
308340	309340	Yeah.
309340	310340	So they, they weren't answering their phones.
310340	313540	I was like, okay, well I've had this before where I've called a couple of times and they
313540	315540	won't answer and then eventually they will.
315540	321860	Um, so they answer the phone, their door is unlocked, but like everything looked like
321860	323300	they're in the middle of construction.
323300	326420	So I'm like, okay, I can hear people in the back.
326420	331620	I see the ovens are on you guys open, you know, it's no one answered.
331620	334140	So like, okay, I'm leaving with the KFC.
334140	337180	There's a lot of churches in the area, so maybe they were doing a catering event or
337180	338180	something.
338180	342020	No, they were like doing some remodeling or something cause they had all the chairs stacked
342020	346460	and then they had like some, maybe they're putting central air in bringing the place
346460	350100	up to code after you were complimenting all the delicious chicken.
350100	351100	All right.
351100	354620	Anyway, uh, we're going to get into talking about video games, but I do want to mention
354620	359320	if you do want to see all the sites and sounds such as the occasional smush cameo or me pointing
359320	361340	at things along the side of the screen.
361340	366780	Of course the audio podcast is free and always has been for the last 17 plus years and will
366780	370500	continue to be, but if you want to get in on the video, it just takes a subscription
370500	373940	to VOG network over twitch.tv slash VOG network.
373940	376980	And many of you get one free with your Amazon prime.
376980	380340	But if you don't have Amazon prime or you've already used it somewhere else supporting
380340	385620	another fabulous indie streamer, then it is sub-tember and you can get those subscriptions
385620	386620	half off.
386620	390740	So, and every, oh, since we did the switch to video, every OLR is there, every Bobby
390740	392060	black Wolf is there.
392060	393900	Some of the impromptu specials are there.
393900	395800	Like the guys on a dragon con we did last week.
395800	398340	So you can check that out over at twitch.tv slash VOG network.
398340	399740	That's the only time I'm going to hype that though.
399740	403420	Uh, but I have to give that a shout out, um, because you know, there it is.
403420	406260	I also want to shout out dark soccer as cookies that she's holding up on cam.
406260	407260	They were pretty good.
407260	411380	Like, you know, sometimes your friends cook things and you're like, I don't know, but
411380	417460	your cookies are, are your cookies always deliver these, um, this batch is coffee, chocolate
417460	418460	chip.
419060	421420	And I'm like super happy with them.
421420	422420	Yeah.
422420	424420	They turned out even the burned ones are good.
424420	425420	Am I weird?
425420	429460	I like when it's like a little bit burnt, like I like toast a little bit burnt, not
429460	430620	like completely black.
430620	431620	That's gross.
431620	437580	But like, just like a little bit burnt, like that dark brown is my oven, not all the numbers
437580	439140	on it work.
439140	441700	So I have to bake it three 50 for my cookies.
441700	442700	That's just how you do it.
442700	443700	Yeah.
443700	444700	Three 58 minutes.
444700	445700	Perfect.
445700	446700	Perfect.
446860	451620	I have, because my zero doesn't work normally when I want to do three fifties, I do three
451620	456340	51 and automatically adjusted three 50 except now my three isn't working.
456340	461300	So I had to cook at four 10 by hitting four one one to get a little enough temperature
461300	463100	and then keep part of the lid open.
463100	467380	So I had to like keep watching it, see how the cookies were doing and it was a pain in
467380	468380	the tuchus.
468380	471940	Uh, act after reminding us as well with a little plug there, all subs on Twitch are
471940	473300	half off for September.
473300	477960	And if you use the sub timber bit emote, if you are feeling so generous to donate biddies,
477960	479980	it does give 10% more to the streamer.
479980	480980	Yes.
480980	484620	And, um, we, we do put your money back into making VOG better, uh, next on the agenda.
484620	488100	And I'm hoping probably by next week, I couldn't get around to it this week as I started the
488100	491380	new job and everything, but I'm hoping in the next week, I'm looking at getting mic
491380	493780	stands for dark soccer and myself at least.
493780	498180	Um, so that with our mics, because the adjustment noises, I know sometimes can be really bad
498180	501720	when we're picking up mics and putting them down, um, which is just, we've used handheld
501720	506400	mics for the 17 years we've done this show and because keep in mind, I do hosting on
506400	507400	the side too.
507400	508720	So I do a lot of like hosting gigs.
508720	511240	So like I live and breathe handheld mics.
511240	515680	So I realize a lot of podcasters use the ones that are in place, but that we do, we have
515680	516780	a lot of movement too.
516780	519560	So I don't know if the ones that are totally in place are good, but I do have an idea for
519560	523900	like stands that we can kind of grab the stand and you won't have as much of the adjustment
523900	524900	noise.
524900	528040	So that's something proud of me getting things ready for my streaming setup.
528040	529520	I got a pop cover.
529520	536240	I'm going to be even prouder when you start streaming because until you do until you stream,
536240	538840	you are him writing video games, money.
538840	544720	How much money did I just throw into things, mister, by the way, this is on sale at Best
544720	545720	Buy.
545720	546720	You should get it.
546720	548400	And I'm like, damn it.
548400	549400	And I got it.
549400	550400	What did I tell you to buy?
550400	552840	I think it was on the dragon con digital media discord.
552840	555320	I saw some sale and I was like, Oh, dark soccer.
555320	556760	It was the stream deck.
556760	557760	Oh yeah.
557800	558800	I love the thing.
558800	559800	We used to switch all the different scenes.
559800	563080	If I want to run, if I want to run B roll of something, I've got the blue hooked up
563080	570360	right now, the snowball, and I got a pop cover for it because I pop things a few times.
570360	573200	And I know these mics have not been the greatest on that.
573200	576000	So we are trying to make it better, but it's just, you know, little baby steps.
576000	579000	I have done recording with that mic on my iMac.
579000	580240	I need to hook my iMac back up.
580240	582280	I have my gaming rig set up right now.
582800	588520	But, um, you know, the only delay I see after I get everything started is when we pick up,
588520	591720	um, my new, uh, Mac that I'm going to do a boot.
591720	592720	Nice.
592720	596160	Uh, nifty eight Oh five and chat says I'm going to try and farm some bits at Twitch
596160	597160	con.
597160	602080	I want to go to Twitch con so bad, but with having just started the new job, I just, I
602080	603360	don't think I can swing the time.
603360	609280	I'm so sad about it, but Oh, well maybe next year, depending on where they have it.
609280	611320	So anyway, let's get into some gaming news.
611360	612640	We got to, uh, we got to get into it.
612640	615800	So, uh, Tokyo game show happened this past week.
615800	618120	So there was a bit of news that came out of Tokyo game show.
618120	620400	I forgot to ask before the show, Loki to do these.
620400	624760	So I guess I should, cause look, he's going to town on KFC, so I should start as I can
624760	625760	do it.
625760	626760	It's fine.
626760	627760	Oh, you got it.
627760	628760	Okay.
628760	629760	Yes.
629760	630760	Tell us a little bit about what happened to Tokyo game show.
630760	631760	Please.
631760	632760	They showed off games.
632760	633760	They sure did.
633760	634760	There's two big ones.
634760	635760	There's two big ones.
635760	636760	Lots of cosplay.
636760	637760	There's two.
637760	638760	We have some other stuff sprinkled throughout the show, but the two big ones I want to start
638760	639760	off with the two big ones.
639920	644080	Beat me in a 2d X ultimate mobile and sound voltage ultimate.
644080	646320	No, those aren't the ones I actually forgot.
646320	648400	They did have a beat me in a 2d X mobile.
648400	649400	What?
649400	650400	Okay.
650400	651680	Do you want it's, you know what?
651680	652680	I'll take it.
652680	654480	It's better than nothing, which is what I've got.
654480	659520	I did think it was funny though, when they're like showing them playing on the, um, they
659520	660880	did something, I don't remember what it was.
660880	661880	Something was wrong.
661880	666380	But like the first time that they showed the guy playing the game, like just fucking up
666380	667380	all of it.
667380	669440	And it's like, yeah.
669440	674040	For those that don't know, like the roots of our show are in music based video games,
674040	677320	dark soccer, Loki, and I all met playing dance, dance revolution.
677320	679760	So beat mania is like adjacent to that.
679760	684480	So we're always going to make these like tongue in cheek jokes about Konami's music game series.
684480	687560	And when it randomly decides to show up again, well, I shouldn't say randomly because I know
687560	690740	things like sound volt X are still very popular.
690740	692680	You know, I was just a dragon con a couple of weeks ago.
692680	696880	The Tokyo attack brings all those arcade machines and those sound volt X, you know, they're
696880	697880	popular throughout the night.
697880	701200	You don't have to, you beat is hugely popular.
701200	703300	You can get it on my mind.
703300	704840	Is that the one with the round?
704840	705840	Yeah.
705840	706840	Yes.
706840	707840	My mind is really fun.
707840	708840	Yeah.
708840	709840	Yeah.
709840	712120	Well now you can get it on your, your mobile device and they have controllers that you
712120	713120	can buy too.
713120	717360	They had, you know what they put UB on mobile reflect beat had like, I remember having those
717360	721600	in my iPad and they were decent translations, but these actually have physical controllers
721600	722600	now too.
722600	725040	Like 2d X and um, sound voltage.
725040	726040	Okay.
726040	727040	All right.
727200	728200	Cause that'd be weird.
728200	729200	That wasn't what I was planning to talk.
729200	730200	It's all right.
730200	731200	I know.
731200	733240	I appreciate the little aside for our music game loyalists that have been with us throughout
733240	734240	the years.
734240	735240	It's, it's a nice little touch.
735240	739720	I also say I'm super jealous of the dream cast and Sega Saturn bags that they were selling
739720	747040	at Tokyo game show just saying do want and um, uh, uh, uh, Genesis or mega drive controller
747040	748040	neck pillow.
748040	752040	I'm looking, I've been looking at all like just the stuff that they were selling.
752040	754840	And I also want like the mini Nakururu.
754840	759840	So no, one of the big gains, of course they showed off was the font 57 remake and some
759840	761680	cool new things coming out about that.
761680	766120	So, uh, one thing they announced was the classic gameplay options.
766120	772480	So if you don't necessarily like the final fantasy 13, uh, type gameplay, you can actually
772480	775960	do turn-based gameplay with menus and all that fun stuff.
775960	779920	I actually, um, uh, for those that are watching on Twitch, I prepared some B roll tonight.
779920	781000	I had a lot to do it.
781000	784720	So, uh, this is a little bit of the play through that they were doing at, um, and you can,
784720	788640	you can hear a little bit of it, probably bleed over on the podcast as the audio is
788640	789640	very down.
789640	792760	Um, but you can actually, this is part of them actually, and you hear, if you probably
792760	796360	hear them talking, cause this is them actually like doing a live play through.
796360	799120	So they're actually, and I, you know, the trailer was great.
799120	800200	I watched the trailer.
800200	803760	I encourage many of you to watch the trailer, but a trailer is a trailer.
803760	808000	I like this kind of stuff where you're actually seeing the game in progress.
808000	809800	It looks way better.
809800	811360	I've seen this before though.
811360	815560	They did, um, they did, they did do, um, like something really, well, this was also from
815560	816560	Tokyo Game Shows.
816560	817560	You may have just seen it this week.
817560	818560	No, no, no.
818560	820760	There was another one that they did a few months ago that was talking about what the
820760	824280	first mission was going to be like and how the battle system was going to look.
824280	825280	There you go.
825280	826280	Look, see, it's in wait mode.
826280	829320	And now he, now cloud can choose the ability magic or item.
829320	830320	It kind of pops up there.
830320	833480	So a little taste of what it kind of looks like there, which is great.
833480	836300	I love the way this looks like it's it.
836300	842500	I'm in such a weird place with Final Fantasy 7 remake because it looks so fucking good.
842500	846340	Like it just looks like such an evolution of the Final Fantasy engine.
846340	851140	And I'm like, okay with the actionist actiony type stuff because they've kind of mixed it
851140	855340	a little bit with the more traditional like, but I am totally down for them making remaking
855340	859260	six when they, or how about don't remake anything?
859260	862420	Like that's, that was my one hesitation is like, you know, here's the thing.
862420	863420	Yes.
863420	864420	Final Fantasy 7.
864420	865580	I understand a lot of you are attached to it.
865580	868420	It was the Final Fantasy when you were like 12 years old or whatever.
868420	872040	And it's the one you remember the best, but it's like, I just, I would have loved to see
872040	878180	a new game, a new Final Fantasy like this because Final Fantasy 15, like you definitely
878180	885500	see like elements of 15 in this, but you don't really see like, I just would have liked to
885500	888840	see like the evolution of that because let's be real what we're looking at here.
888840	893860	This is just Final Fantasy 15 engine pushed to the next level is what we're looking at,
893860	894860	but it's running out.
894860	898860	So I gotta go back to us life, but, uh, yeah, so, but my, the Final Fantasy 7 remakes looking
898860	899860	sweet.
899860	904220	Like I, despite the fact I'm kind of like, why did they, why did they use all this to
904220	905360	remake seven?
905360	906900	Why can't they just do a 16?
906900	908900	I'm still all about this.
908900	909900	Obviously I'm going to buy it.
909900	917580	Obviously like feelings on the story aside, it just looks like a painting in motion.
917580	918580	Like it's just so gorgeous.
918580	919860	It's so goddamn good looking.
919860	922580	I was in my early twenties when it came out.
922620	931220	I didn't even own a fucking PlayStation and I bought it and I moved out here with 53.5
931220	936900	floppies loaded with nothing but Vincent fan art and Dogenchi.
936900	937900	This is so you.
937900	939140	I'm not even kidding.
939140	940140	And you know what?
940140	942180	I found one of the discs the other day.
942180	947220	I have no way to read it, but I found one, um, some comp or some, uh, co-signs for your
947220	948220	thoughts.
948220	949220	Loki in our chat.
949220	950220	Dark Tetsuya says co-signed with Loki.
950220	953340	I'd love something like that, but for final fantasy six and quest buster says, I'd be
953340	956220	all over a fantasy six remake on this scale too.
956220	957220	Don't get me wrong.
957220	962140	I love final fantasy six and it is weird that they never did the light 3d treatment with
962140	963140	that.
963140	964140	You know, you know what I mean?
964140	967060	Like fantasy three, fantasy four kind of got that 3d remake, but they never did it with
967060	969260	fantasy six, which I thought was a little weird.
969260	970260	Yeah.
970260	971260	Um, but, uh, okay.
971260	975680	They didn't do a pharmacy five either, I guess, but they did those, they did those mobile
975680	976680	ports.
976680	977680	They did the one on the Wii.
977680	981600	They weren't the, the new mobile ports are like the new graphics that were, was that
981600	984660	four that was on the four was on the week.
984660	989340	The best version of Final Fantasy four, in my opinion is the PSP one because it was like
989340	994760	a remade 2d version and it had after years included, it was, it was a really solid package.
994760	1000520	Like I would love to see, uh, that game somehow re-released on like PlayStation four or something,
1000520	1007020	you know, it shouldn't be that hard to emulate a PSP game or just, I know I'm totally sounding
1007020	1010880	like ignorant when it comes to game making, but I guess maybe I am like recompile it for
1010880	1013900	the PS4 versus the PlayStation portable.
1013900	1017440	Like I realized it's not as easy as pushing a button, but I can't imagine it's going to
1017440	1019480	take vast amounts of resources either.
1019480	1020880	I don't know.
1020880	1021880	They've done it before.
1021880	1026960	You're saying a PlayStation four can emulate a PSP or anyway, that might be tough.
1026960	1028200	I mean, I go, I get it.
1028200	1029560	The cell phone can do that.
1029560	1034080	Like an old ass cell phone could do that, but PlayStation four with its ray tracing
1034080	1037640	and whatnot, can't handle the sheer power of the PSP.
1037640	1044180	But I'm ready for final fantasy 16 and I am so here for the fan wank where, and I don't,
1044180	1048580	I don't know to what extent these rumors were, you know, sourced or whatever, but there was
1048580	1054800	a big rumor that Naoki Ohshida, who is the producer on Final Fantasy 14, who really saved
1054800	1055800	that game.
1055800	1058840	He's the one that came in and turned it into realm reborn and so forth that he was going
1058840	1064440	to hand off Final Fantasy 14, and he's going to be part of the 16 development team.
1064440	1065980	And I want that to be true.
1065980	1067280	So fucking bad.
1067280	1070780	Like if Yoshida got to make a single player Final Fantasy game, and I just, I know I've
1070780	1074540	said this a lot on the show, I'm going to say it one more time.
1074540	1078900	The expansion storylines in Final Fantasy 14, heaven's words, storm blood, and now shadow
1078900	1084880	bringers are probably some of the best, if not the best, I don't know, Final Fantasy
1084880	1089420	six is hard to top, but like the best stories in the final fantasy universe.
1089420	1092920	And because it's an MMO, so few people are going to see them.
1092920	1094260	And it's, it's a real bummer.
1094260	1099180	So like if they were to let him do a single player Final Fantasy game, Oh my God.
1099180	1100180	Oh my God.
1100180	1101180	All right.
1101180	1102980	I've digressed completely from the Final Fantasy seven remake topic.
1102980	1108340	I'm sorry, but I needed to talk about that important sidebar.
1108340	1114460	So is anyone in here, show of hands, anyone here not interested in the seven remake at
1114460	1115460	this point?
1115460	1118120	I had a feeling, dark soccer.
1118120	1119800	Have you kind of Vincent?
1119800	1126320	Well, well remember episode one don't care Vincent, but he's not going to be in the first
1126320	1127320	one.
1127320	1128320	I don't care.
1128320	1129840	I will eventually have Vincent.
1129840	1130840	Okay.
1130840	1131840	Okay.
1131840	1133920	And I will get to watch the bitch die.
1133920	1135240	No, you won't.
1135240	1136240	Not in episode one.
1136240	1142560	As I said, eventually, I can't wait for when they like say, guess what?
1142560	1145420	We're taking, we're, we're taking the storyline in different directions.
1145420	1146900	She's not going to die this time.
1146900	1147900	I'll kill the bitch.
1147900	1149700	I, I will find a way.
1149700	1150820	I can't wait.
1150820	1152300	No, I'm putting this out there.
1152300	1155780	I'm going to put it in the atmosphere and then I can't take it back.
1155780	1158980	They're going to fucking pull one up because remember what a fucking shock it was when
1158980	1162260	Eris died in Final Fantasy seven the first time, because you didn't have the internet
1162260	1163780	and all that stuff as prolific as it is now.
1163780	1164780	What do you mean a shock?
1164780	1165780	I was happy.
1165780	1169100	Well, I know, but for most people, it was a pleasant surprise though for you.
1169100	1171100	I kind of saw it happening.
1171440	1175240	What if the gag is this time around, Oh, you re I'm about to be the most hated person on
1175240	1176240	the internet.
1176240	1177240	You ready?
1177240	1181160	This time they're like, we're really going to shock them this time through like a trick.
1181160	1184720	She's going to survive and Tifa dies.
1184720	1186080	That doesn't work for the story.
1186080	1190560	I mean, there's actually no logical reason and I'll put it this way because it was because
1190560	1196760	she was dead that the whole shit happened with the live stream business.
1196760	1199160	And Tifa has absolutely nothing to do with the life.
1199160	1200760	I'm just saying, I'm just waiting.
1200760	1209140	We have to kill the last survivor of their species because, and it ended up being like
1209140	1211180	a big story point anyways.
1211180	1213320	So I just don't see any way around it.
1213320	1218820	And even so if, if she lives, I'm just gonna, um, head cannon that I locked her in a trunk
1218820	1221820	and left her at the bottom of the pool.
1221820	1222820	That's true.
1222820	1223820	You still get to pick who's in your party.
1223820	1227640	She is the one woman I will allow to be in a refrigerator.
1227640	1233160	So are you saying you will be telling Aerith to just go back to the kitchen and not, no,
1233160	1236400	I'm just going to tell her to just not be around.
1236400	1237400	All right.
1237400	1244880	Don't get, don't get in the way of my, uh, Tifa cloud romance, uh, SSJ 100 Matt is saying,
1244880	1246760	I believe they will do something like that.
1246760	1250700	Oh, tiger claws saying, I wouldn't be surprised if she lives, it's a remake and the remake
1250700	1252500	doesn't have to be exactly like the original.
1252500	1255020	They can take some liberties with it to make it different enough.
1255020	1256980	I can just see dark soccer getting so angry.
1256980	1258940	Um, watch me be right though.
1258940	1262900	Then, uh, uh, uh, a newer name, I don't recognize rep cycled welcome.
1262900	1265980	Sorry if I mispronounced your name, said she dropped the materia.
1265980	1269220	So, but that, that doesn't mean it could have been in someone else's pocket.
1269220	1271060	No, no, I get it.
1271060	1275820	I, and I get what dark soccer say it like they would have to drastically shift the story
1275820	1279940	to kill somebody else, you know, but maybe they'll kill Kate Seth.
1279940	1284380	Would anybody be that upset if it, by the way, cat she, Oh, that's how it's pronounced
1284380	1285380	all these years.
1285380	1286860	I've said Kate Seth because it's cultic.
1286860	1287860	Interesting.
1287860	1288860	Good to know.
1288860	1293060	Uh, anyway, uh, just fake us out, making it look like that she's going to live, but instead
1293060	1297620	they'll go the whole tomb Raider route where she dies horribly.
1297620	1299340	Pixel Pacas says dark soccer.
1299340	1304500	I love your head Canon, LOL, uh, Meesh and chat says, I never even got to finish final
1304500	1307980	fantasy seven and now I don't want to, it's, it's worth it.
1307980	1309400	It's it's worth a play.
1309400	1310400	It is.
1310400	1311400	It's it's a little harder to play the original.
1311400	1312400	It's so kind of graphic.
1312400	1313620	I don't know why I hate her.
1313620	1316680	She was such a fucking stereotype character.
1316680	1320720	She had the personality of a noodle, but she was my healer.
1320720	1328480	She existed just for plot, which is kind of the same problem I have with as much as you
1328480	1331360	know, the mass effect fandom is all about Nylas.
1331360	1335280	It's the same problem I have with that writing and it pisses me off.
1335280	1342360	I'm here's the problem I have with final fantasy seven in the fact that, you know, she's dead
1343240	1348440	is because we have the Phoenix down, which can bring things back to life.
1348440	1350120	So why is anybody dead?
1350120	1351120	Anybody at all?
1351120	1355040	Because actually there's a, there's an explanation for this because you actually don't die.
1355040	1356040	You never die.
1356040	1357040	Your characters never die.
1357040	1362480	They get KO'd like wait for the, it says KO'd your characters or party KO'd.
1362480	1363480	Everybody's KO'd.
1363480	1364480	So it's different.
1364480	1365480	You don't die.
1365480	1368400	You just get KO'd and Phoenix down revives your KO status.
1368400	1369400	Fine.
1369400	1370400	Look it up.
1370440	1373840	It actually came up on a final fantasy 14 panel because somebody asked a question about
1373840	1378440	what happens when everybody dies and he did this whole thing where he goes, well, they're
1378440	1379440	KO'd.
1379440	1381960	He kind of did this whole like wink.
1381960	1383960	Nobody really dies except Harshvan.
1383960	1389160	Uh, anyway, that was their whole thing for explaining why, and what was the game with
1389160	1390800	Nathan Drake?
1390800	1392260	Uncharted Uncharted.
1392260	1398420	Why he can get shot so much and it's because he has a luck meter and so that finally when
1398460	1400740	his luck runs out, the bullet finally hits him.
1400740	1401740	Okay.
1401740	1403980	Before we move on to another game, I wanted to say, uh, Bobby Blackwolf and Chad says,
1403980	1407540	I mean the Marvel Cinematic Universe does things differently than the comics and everyone
1407540	1409580	hates and loves them for it.
1409580	1414060	So I don't, I'm just, I think it is very obvious going back to on topic with Final Fantasy
1414060	1419700	7 in the trailer, it does seem like characters that were like side characters before seem
1419700	1422540	to play a much bigger role this time.
1422540	1427700	They're definitely, and that probably is a nature of the game only being episode one
1427700	1431980	only being the Midgar part of the story is that they're probably some of these characters
1431980	1435600	that were more side characters are taking on a bigger role because I mean, otherwise,
1435600	1439100	you know, like we brought up earlier, you don't have Vincent yet.
1439100	1444280	You don't have, um, K cat, cat, cat seat, catchy.
1444280	1445980	You're not going to have that one yet.
1445980	1448340	You're not going to have, does red 13 show up in bigger?
1448340	1449340	Yes.
1449340	1452480	Red 13 is bigger, but you know, it's going to, it's going to be limited on what characters
1452480	1453480	you have.
1453480	1454900	So maybe some of these side characters will take a bigger role.
1454900	1455900	Who knows?
1455900	1456900	We'll see.
1457100	1458100	What's the show Tokyo game show?
1458100	1459100	They show Death Stranding.
1459100	1466660	They actually have like a long gameplay presentation to show off actually what you do in the game,
1466660	1468700	which I still don't know what you do.
1468700	1472100	Well, I, I watched a little bit of the video.
1472100	1475860	I mean, I didn't watch all 45 minutes, but I did a little bit of hunting and pecking
1475860	1479300	around the Death Stranding and I grabbed a little bit of footage here.
1479300	1483580	I like how everything you carry, you can see, well, yeah, it's, that's the interesting thing.
1483580	1488220	I've always thought it was funny, like in games you would have this gigantic inventory,
1488220	1491260	but it like just seems to all fit magically in this backpack.
1491260	1495260	But it really does seem like in this game and Death Stranding, like you see that he's
1495260	1499180	carrying everything and it seems to affect like his weight and stuff too.
1499180	1503360	There's a fucking baby in that thing or, you know, the, the fetus thing that's in the trailers
1503360	1504360	in that thing.
1504360	1506820	That's why it's like so awkward.
1506820	1509740	But when you're actually looking at the gameplay footage, you can see there's like an open
1509740	1510740	world.
1510740	1514820	So if you're looking at on the footage that they're showing off, the Hideo Kojima is playing,
1514820	1517360	they're going to a map and they're actually like setting a route.
1517360	1520540	So they're doing like, I guess you could say a fetch quest type of thing, but like the
1520540	1521540	delivery quest.
1521540	1525100	Uh, so you can see like there's this giant map and they're actually like plotting a course
1525100	1530340	on the map right now that Norman Reedus is going to run and I guess make some type of
1530340	1531340	like delivery here.
1531340	1533820	So you can actually kind of see, Oh, okay.
1533820	1537020	So it's like an open the world type of thing.
1537020	1539620	And you actually will see him run around a little bit.
1539700	1542340	Well, hopefully this will just be so you don't have to hold down the damn controller all
1542340	1543340	the time.
1543340	1544340	Yeah.
1544340	1545980	I mean, um, I don't know.
1545980	1551940	Like again, I've been, believe me, I've been like the first one to say they need to actually
1551940	1554620	show us what this fucking game is.
1554620	1559220	And so you, cause we've had like what three years worth of just like cinematic teases
1559220	1560220	and shit.
1560220	1561220	Right.
1561220	1564380	So I'm very happy that now what we're like two months from the game's release at this
1564380	1568380	point, but we're finally getting to see like, okay, here's what the game looks like in motion.
1568380	1571620	And I think they did, they did 45 minutes one day, they did like another 20 minutes
1571620	1572620	another day.
1572620	1576900	So you, you can get a full sense of like what the game actually kind of looks like, like
1576900	1577900	as you're playing it now.
1577900	1580980	He did, they just did a little thing that like was scanning the terrain too.
1580980	1584940	I just saw that kind of remind me of no man's sky when you go like you're scanning for different
1584940	1585940	materials.
1585940	1587580	So I thought that was kind of interesting.
1587580	1592740	So anyway, um, uh, rep cycled in our chat says it does seem like he's a courier.
1592740	1593740	Yeah.
1593740	1594740	I think that was part of the story.
1594740	1596860	Oh, did they just, did they do the part where he changed his hat?
1596860	1599740	So of course there's fashion accessories and things like that too, because you know
1599740	1604660	there is, um, let's see, Misha in our chat says, by the time this game comes out, I'm
1604660	1607860	not even sure I'll want it cause they're beating the source till it dies.
1607860	1609060	So much talking about it.
1609060	1612940	They're talking about this more than cyberpunk 2077 and we still don't know what this fucking
1612940	1613940	game is about.
1613940	1615820	Well, at least we finally learned a little more this week.
1615820	1619440	Like I feel a little better after this week, but I do agree.
1619440	1624760	It's been three years of like hype, but at the same time it is Hideo Kojima.
1624760	1629560	So a little bit of hype is to be expected, but um, yeah, I'm just excited that this game
1629560	1633300	is like finally about to come out and now I won't just get to see professionals like
1633300	1634300	Kojima playing it.
1634300	1637240	I'll get to watch people on Twitch play it and make a decision from there.
1637240	1640000	I haven't decided if I want to buy this day one or not.
1640000	1643360	I kind of think I do, but I'm not sure yet.
1643360	1644680	So it looks interesting.
1644680	1645680	Yeah, it does.
1645680	1648640	It looks like, and especially like, you know, with games like breath of the wild and stuff
1648640	1653360	being all the rage where like open world stuff is so like, I feel like there's going to be
1653360	1657120	a lot to do and a lot to explore and so we'll see.
1657120	1659360	But creepy silent hill creatures though.
1659360	1660360	Yes.
1660360	1661600	Yes.
1661600	1664480	Creepy shit and ghost babies and ghost babies.
1664480	1665800	Creepy shit and ghost babies.
1665800	1666800	Hashtag.
1666800	1667800	Um, let's see.
1667800	1671080	Questbuster in chat says there are some combat bits in the first day footage, but they're
1671080	1674520	later and they admittedly don't look bad, especially the part that submerges you in
1674520	1678480	black ink and then makes you fight a weird lion with tentacles.
1678480	1679480	Hmm.
1679480	1681300	Uh, Kaijuto in chat says I won't buy it.
1681300	1683040	It looks awful and too weird.
1683040	1684040	No, it is.
1684040	1685040	It is a little out there.
1685040	1686600	It's not going to be for everybody's tastes.
1686600	1687600	That's for sure.
1687600	1688600	So, all right.
1688600	1689600	Me.
1689600	1693960	Me should chat says, all I know is you can pee on mushrooms to make them grow and you
1693960	1695640	carry a baby.
1695640	1698400	Did you see there was a little and you can drink monster.
1698400	1700120	There was a clip on Twitter.
1700120	1705280	I saw there was a gift that somebody took of like Norman Reedus's character because
1705280	1710060	like what they did is they zoomed in on his crotch and the Norman Reedus character like
1710060	1713820	goes like this, like bumps the camera up and then punches the person in the face for
1713820	1715700	like staring at his crotch.
1715700	1719460	And I don't know, like some people were saying, is this homophobia question mark question
1719460	1720460	mark.
1720460	1726060	But because, especially because you compare that to quiet in metal gear solid five, which
1726060	1728140	does not react the same way.
1728140	1730020	I don't, it's a gift.
1730020	1733620	I haven't seen it in full context, so I'm not willing to hedge my bets on one side of
1733620	1734780	the fence or the other.
1734780	1739660	I do think it's interesting that a character is finally going to fight back for being sexualized
1739660	1742300	in a video game by the in game camera.
1742300	1745860	But yeah, that's a little breaking the fourth wall there a little bit.
1745860	1750820	So I just, I want to see the context before I say, Oh, this is bad or this is good.
1750820	1755040	But I thought it was interesting that a character finally kind of does something about that.
1755040	1756040	Come on.
1756040	1757040	Y'all have done it.
1757040	1760900	You've zoomed in on the crotch and the character creator mode or the or the boobies or the
1760900	1761900	butt or something.
1761900	1762900	Never, never, ever.
1762900	1765660	I'm not really interested in any of it.
1765660	1766660	All right.
1766660	1767660	Well, fair.
1767660	1770260	I want my character to like look a specific way when I make one.
1770260	1776500	So although I do think that the Conan one was just hilarious.
1776500	1781300	Questmaster says the combat stuff resembles what we've seen in ground zeros and Phantom
1781300	1782700	pain a bit.
1782700	1786900	And dark to see you says it, that footage is in part of day two when they're talking
1786900	1788180	about the safe house.
1788180	1792060	So I guess I could see more context of that outside the gift if I want to.
1792060	1796060	So those are two of the big games we've got huge updates on fantasy seven remake and death
1796060	1797060	stranding.
1797460	1800620	So, um, yeah, cause the Nintendo direct was last week.
1800620	1801620	We talked all about that.
1801620	1802620	Yeah.
1802620	1803620	Would you have a little more on Nintendo?
1803620	1804620	We'll get to that a little later in the show.
1804620	1807660	I'm sure you see it over there on the sidebar, but first before we get into all that, we're
1807660	1811060	gonna talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing
1811060	1812060	this week.
1812060	1813860	Uh, so dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?
1813860	1821460	I simmed, I've decided to now that I actually got the new expansion, the magic, whatever
1821460	1822460	they called it.
1822460	1824980	I don't remember the name of it, but it just has magic.
1824980	1830180	So I'm going to make a special, I'm inspired by the show called being human, which I didn't
1830180	1831180	watch the U S one.
1831180	1832180	I watched a little bit.
1832180	1833620	It was shitty, but the British one was great.
1833620	1837780	And on the British show, it's a vampire or werewolf and a ghost that all live in a flat
1837780	1838780	together.
1838780	1846420	Um, it's really a lot more serious than that, but, um, I'm going to have a vampire, a witch
1846420	1850900	and a ghost live in a house together and it's going to be amazing.
1850900	1854180	Do do do do snap, snap, do do do do do.
1854180	1857340	Well, I've already decided cause I have the cheats ready to do the ghost the way I want
1857340	1858340	them to.
1858340	1863820	Cause you know, whenever you have a ghost in the Sims, what they do to the household
1863820	1866620	depends on how they died.
1866620	1873820	I have decided that I am going to have one die by and no drowning is no, I'm going to
1873820	1880540	have one die in the sauna because if they die of relaxation, they actually absorb puddles.
1880540	1887720	So I won't have to do like any puddle cleaning when the toilet breaks, I'm planning ahead.
1887720	1888720	This is you.
1888720	1889720	This is dark.
1889720	1890720	This is very dark.
1890720	1894740	Well, I also, one of my favorite Halloween, one of my favorite YouTubers is, um, James
1894740	1895740	from the Sims supply.
1895740	1899860	He's just really fun to watch, but I watched a video that I had, I'd seen it and I passed
1899860	1904900	it and passed and passed over, but he did one about how Sims die and I was like, Oh,
1904900	1906500	Oh, ideas.
1906500	1911180	And so I'm gonna, it's probably, what's going to be my first series of streaming when I
1911180	1915660	get going is making my Sim family and cheating the fuck out of it and building their house
1915660	1916780	and doing all of that.
1916780	1922940	So y'all get to watch me some stuff until a particular dating Sim comes out that I already
1922940	1924900	have on my wishlist on steam.
1924900	1925900	It's free.
1925900	1926900	Sounds good.
1926900	1927900	All right.
1927900	1928900	Moving on.
1928900	1929900	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1929900	1934660	I played a Borderlands three this week, so yeah, I forgot that actually came out.
1934660	1936420	So I played a little bit of that.
1936420	1944140	Um, so I'm playing as, uh, Zane and it's a good sport lens.
1944140	1945740	What are you playing on a PC or console or what?
1945740	1946740	PC.
1946740	1947740	Yeah.
1947740	1948740	Oh, okay.
1948740	1949740	Oh, so you ponied up the money for the Epic store.
1949740	1950740	I know.
1950740	1954380	And I did the, uh, special edition with the, um, the DLC.
1954380	1956700	I know some people, some people still not happy with the Epic thing.
1956700	1960260	In fact, uh, Bobby referred to it on his show as the six month beta test on PC.
1960260	1962020	Well, I get it.
1962020	1967220	They don't, they don't have the prepaid cards like steam does, and it's a deal breaker for
1967220	1968220	me too, honestly.
1968220	1970140	But I would just get Borderlands three on console.
1970140	1974500	Um, but they don't have the prepaid cards and I don't kind of don't trust Epic with
1974500	1976660	my credit card because Epic's been hacked already.
1976660	1980820	Like I've, I've had my account hacked on there and it's like, I don't exactly like, I'm not
1980820	1982820	an idiot when it comes to password security.
1982820	1987060	So, and I don't think Epic has two FA don't have anything I care about.
1987060	1990620	Well, I, I would actually love to get, um, Tetris effect on PC.
1990620	1993060	I think I would double dip on that game just cause I'm crazy.
1993060	1997620	Um, especially if they do like a, but yeah, like the number one thing Epic needs to get
1997620	2002180	on is having those prepaid cards so that I don't have to give them my credit card number
2002180	2004660	like or can you do PayPal yet?
2004660	2005660	You can do PayPal.
2005660	2009260	I might, I might be okay with that because then it's going through third party.
2009260	2013700	The thing is about the PayPal stuff though is it seems to just, once you've authorized
2013700	2018100	it, it just goes through without having to put your password in, which I don't necessarily
2018100	2020540	like, but that could be a PayPal thing.
2020540	2024800	Um, and Bobby in chat says they do have two factor authentication.
2024800	2026180	I didn't realize that.
2026180	2027300	So that'll, that's on me.
2027300	2031400	I do try to do two FA on everything and I really encourage you guys to as well.
2031400	2035380	If you have a cell phone, get that two factor auth, especially on the two most important
2035380	2037860	things, your email account and your banking.
2037860	2040620	Get those locked down because those are the things you can never have hacked.
2040620	2044260	Uh, Bobby says, I trust them less with my PayPal because it goes directly from my bank.
2044260	2047300	Yeah, but don't, wouldn't you have to like log into PayPal every time to do it.
2047300	2050500	So it's not, you know, this time, no, it just, it, it just does it.
2050700	2051940	Oh, okay.
2051940	2052540	I don't like that.
2052540	2053740	I thought you had to log it.
2053740	2057820	Like it's, it's like, uh, when I've paid some bills on like, okay, so like the way I used
2057820	2061820	to pay for VOG, when it was a radio feed, I would go to PayPal, like I would go to their
2061820	2062660	site, it would be a link.
2062660	2063940	It would send me to PayPal.
2064020	2064740	I log into PayPal.
2064740	2068820	And then when I pay, PayPal sends a message back saying, Rob paid this much money.
2068900	2069900	So it's not like that.
2069940	2071280	It's like built in.
2071300	2074020	So you're, cause that was like, you felt like you were going through a third party
2074020	2075260	completely does the same thing.
2075420	2077820	Oh, interesting.
2078100	2086740	I have to say that I've set up my Apple card on a few things now because, um, all number
2086740	2090660	one, my card doesn't have a number that's public.
2091620	2096780	Um, so anything that's been taking, um, Apple pay, I've been able to do everything through
2096780	2097340	Apple pay.
2097420	2102020	Yeah, but I still feel like Apple card, MasterCard, Visa, either way, you're putting
2102020	2102780	yourself at risk.
2102820	2103100	Nope.
2103140	2108100	But the other thing on it too, is that if you have, you know, with an iPhone, your control
2108100	2112580	of the card goes into your iPhone, you get an immediate notice anytime there's a
2112580	2115860	transaction down to subscription transactions.
2115900	2121780	To be fair, my, I don't want to plug my bank cause they're not paying me to, um, but my
2121780	2124740	bank will also send me an alert that I can set.
2124740	2127620	If it's over X amount of dollars, it will send a push message to my phone.
2127620	2129940	So there's a site, my bank will do that too.
2129940	2131260	I just like that for anything.
2131260	2132740	So there's a site out there.
2132940	2134420	Um, wait, hold on.
2135260	2139780	Well, and on top of that, I get, um, it'll actually divide up my transactions based on
2139780	2141260	what type of transaction it was.
2141540	2144140	So it also is like budgeting and the usual stuff.
2144620	2149340	I don't mind getting money back, but not that I'm doing an advertisement for it, but I've
2149340	2151380	found the security has been really top notch on it.
2151420	2154180	You're not the only one I've heard that cause that's like a new thing that was just in the
2154180	2154900	past two or three weeks.
2154900	2157140	And my card is like legit titanium.
2157380	2158940	I've, I've heard it's metal.
2158980	2161220	You're not the only one I've heard kind of dipping their finger in the waters of
2161220	2163100	that, you know, kind of new, new thing.
2163260	2167500	So, um, you want to add, I was going to say they have a site called privacy.com that you
2167500	2172020	can set up virtual credit cards with certain limits on them so you can actually add money
2172020	2172340	to them.
2172340	2176060	So for example, say you want to do, you know, trials at different, I don't think you want
2176060	2176780	to put that on cam.
2178220	2179060	Oh yeah, that's right.
2179060	2179740	They don't have a number.
2179780	2180220	Okay.
2180620	2181980	You, you better think extra care.
2182020	2182460	All right.
2182500	2182900	All right.
2182900	2183300	There you go.
2183580	2183940	Okay.
2184620	2187260	I was, I would never put that on cam, but all right.
2189460	2191180	Yeah, no, they, they, they're sleek looking.
2191180	2194700	Things, which is very typical of Apple, but you know, anyway.
2195140	2196540	Um, let's see what I want to say.
2196580	2198900	Uh, but did you do, uh, Bobby?
2198940	2199580	Oh, I'm sorry.
2199580	2202300	Actually this, uh, rip cycle had this other good comment here.
2202300	2207500	I thought it was, um, worth noting is that, um, my bank gets spooked by repeated
2207500	2208340	transactions.
2208340	2209300	Wish they had a cart.
2209340	2210220	I forgot about that too.
2210220	2211300	Epic game store.
2211580	2214500	Does it like you have to keep buying one at a time, basically.
2214540	2214820	Yeah.
2214820	2216140	You can't just put everything in a cart.
2216140	2217180	That seems very silly.
2217540	2222060	So anyway, um, what else do we want to talk about with your gaming week?
2222100	2222500	Loki.
2222660	2225060	Oh, I worked, I worked on my stuff as well.
2225060	2229980	So I worked on my game and then, uh, pizza's fine.
2230300	2236620	Uh, but so I worked on that and they played a little Pokemon go.
2237340	2240340	That's pretty much it, but I had to take a break for border lands
2240340	2241540	because you know, it's for Lance.
2241860	2245380	I'm hearing there was a comment or something I saw on Twitter that
2245380	2248220	they've gearbox has commented that it's doing very well.
2248260	2251260	They're very happy with how, you know, despite this fact that some
2251260	2254660	people are, you know, a little huffy about the lack of availability
2254660	2258260	anywhere else on PC, but the Epic store, it seems to be doing very well.
2258260	2262140	And again, like I, if I decide to get in on it, I'll just get it on console.
2262180	2262700	Fine.
2262700	2266660	Because, you know, it's just like any of the other border land stuff, you know,
2266700	2270580	they'll, it'll go on a deep discount sometime in the future during a steam
2270580	2274660	sale, just buy it again, buy it again on the PlayStation story.
2274980	2275980	It's fine.
2276100	2278860	And whatever, you know, I'm fine with it.
2279820	2282060	Um, Bobby's telling us about the, the review.
2282060	2282940	And I heard about this too.
2282940	2283780	I thought this was weird.
2284340	2287500	One of the interesting things that two K did with border lands three is that
2287500	2289620	they're not providing an Epic store code.
2289860	2292540	They were providing a separate account with the game.
2293060	2293340	Yeah.
2293340	2296740	And apparently had really early builds on it, which is stupid because, and
2296740	2299820	then they, they were telling people not to mention certain bugs in the
2299820	2301140	game because those are going to be fixed.
2301420	2303860	So then they gives you the impression of, well, it's like, well, I don't
2303860	2306380	know which bugs I can mention, you know, it could be just something that
2306380	2309140	they're going to fix and, and then it just kind of skews her.
2309620	2311140	I wouldn't have played along with that.
2311140	2314220	I would've said I ran across these bugs, but they said that some of
2314220	2315500	these will be fixed by launch.
2315580	2317820	So we'll, we'll update our review at launch.
2317820	2322420	Like, I really wish reviewers would not play into those hands.
2323300	2325940	But yeah, I, there's nothing I can do about that.
2326220	2327500	So, all right.
2327700	2328820	Anyway, that's it for your game week.
2329100	2332500	Um, I was, I was out for training for my new job all week.
2332500	2336140	So I didn't, I wasn't really at home game to play a lot of stuff, but I've been
2336140	2338020	continuing to play world of Warcraft classic.
2338140	2342180	Um, I caught my priest up to level 14, which is like the equivalent of like
2342180	2344140	end game in a lot of MMOs today.
2344140	2344900	It takes a lot of work.
2345140	2347620	So I've been playing that I've also been playing ironically, final fantasy
2347620	2352980	14, uh, still playing that, uh, taking my, um, gunbreaker up a few more levels.
2352980	2354700	I'm almost a level 70 on my gunbreaker.
2354700	2356580	That's a lot of fun to play as a tank actually.
2356860	2358660	Um, otherwise I had my switch with me.
2358980	2363180	I could not get on the hotel wifi, which really bothered me because I wanted to
2363180	2367540	work on my Diablo three seasonal character on switch because for the first time I'm
2367540	2371780	finally playing a necromancer because after all this time, I still don't have
2371780	2376420	necromancer on the PC and as much as I love Diablo three, do you guys remember I
2376420	2379740	said I wasn't going to get it because I was pissed off that they didn't do a legit
2379740	2383340	expansion and they were just like, it was a money grab, so I never bought it.
2383420	2387540	And to this day I still haven't, but when I did get the switch version, so yes, I
2387540	2391100	bought another version, so maybe I'm not really helping, but when I bought the
2391100	2394740	switch version, which I still enjoy that version, it did come with the necromancer
2394740	2395700	just kind of like built in.
2395700	2397820	So that's, that was my first chance.
2397820	2401260	Finally getting to play that class, uh, in three anyway, as opposed to two.
2401460	2405300	So, um, yeah, but sadly the hotel internet didn't work, so I couldn't do very much
2405300	2405740	with that.
2405940	2409220	Um, but I was still able to play some Mario maker and some of the super Nintendo
2409220	2411220	catalog because you know, all those games came out.
2411460	2415420	Uh, and yeah, so that was, that was otherwise not a lot of new stuff this
2415420	2418380	week, but hopefully we'll get on that, uh, in the coming week.
2418380	2421860	Cause now I'll be at home this week and can jump in on some new games.
2421900	2425580	Um, I w that's, and if you wondered why I haven't been streaming at all last week,
2425580	2426980	that's why I w I haven't been home.
2427220	2431860	So, um, I did, I will mention quickly earlier today, I did go out for Pokemon
2431860	2432580	community day.
2432820	2437580	Um, I haven't really been playing Pokemon go a lot at all, but I did today.
2437820	2442380	I caught like maybe nine shiny turtwigs and I was that today.
2442420	2444660	Yeah, it was today, uh, from 11 to two this morning.
2444660	2446700	And I, there was still a lot of people at Capitol.
2446740	2448540	It's still very popular.
2448860	2453380	Um, I hatched a shiny Tauros, which, oh yeah, I forgot.
2453380	2455380	There's like a million shinies in the game all of a sudden.
2455380	2461140	So I hatched a shiny Tauros and I also hatched a shiny Igglybuff, which I would
2461140	2464180	have never known was a shiny if it didn't show that little icon.
2464180	2468700	Cause I swear to God, it looks exactly the same, but yeah, I had, I, I had a shiny
2468700	2470460	day that even Shane can be proud of.
2470460	2475260	That was like three different, uh, new Pokemon going in the shiny decks today.
2475260	2475940	So that was fun.
2476300	2479340	So, uh, yeah, uh, played a little bit of that.
2479980	2482700	Um, oh, I guess I can mention the Ingress thing I did yesterday.
2483060	2486660	Um, I don't talk a lot about Ingress on this show, but I did go to the, they did
2486660	2488060	a, what's called a field test.
2488340	2491780	Uh, hex hexathlon was the event they did yesterday.
2491780	2496100	So, um, myself and one of my Ingress buddies drove over to Santa Clara, uh, to
2496100	2497340	the university there.
2497620	2502060	And yes, I know MagWest was right there and I didn't go and I really wanted to,
2502060	2504500	but I was really only there for a few hours.
2504500	2506620	We went there, did the thing and came right back.
2506900	2510340	Um, I just, MagWest is always just, the timing is so terrible.
2510340	2510860	I feel bad.
2511100	2512740	But anyway, so we went to Santa Clara.
2512740	2514900	It was at the university there, which is really pretty.
2515180	2520340	Um, and, uh, basically you had to do these different events in an hour and a half.
2520540	2525100	So you had an hour and a half to hack as many portals as you can get as many
2525140	2529100	glyph points as you can walk as many kilometers as you can deploy as many
2529100	2533260	resonators as you can and hack artifacts from certain marked portals.
2533700	2537660	And if you got in the top 10% of a certain category, you got a special metal.
2537780	2539140	So you got an elite metal.
2539300	2542580	Well, the really cool thing, finally, in Ingress, you actually could see
2542580	2543860	your results in real time.
2544060	2545580	So you could hit a button within the scanner.
2545580	2548340	It would take you to a separate page cause they've done some new stuff in prime.
2548500	2551180	They're really trying to, as, as much as the player base has really been
2551180	2554020	resisting prime, they've been trying to add some new stuff to make it more
2554020	2554460	attractive.
2554460	2557340	So one of them was he could go right to this leaderboard and you could see how
2557340	2558700	you were doing every five minutes.
2558980	2562820	And within the first 30 minutes of the event, I was like, Oh my God, I'm in the
2562820	2567380	elite for every single category and number one for glyph app points.
2567700	2570580	So I just kept, I just kept pushing for the whole thing I would have.
2570820	2576540	And, uh, I ended up in the elite top 10% in every single category and number one
2576540	2579940	overall in glyph act points out of 210 registered people.
2579940	2580380	Nice.
2580420	2582340	So I was, yeah, it was pretty exciting.
2582340	2584460	So that was my super nerdy Ingress day.
2584460	2589020	But, um, I haven't been so fond on Ingress this whole week, cause I
2589020	2590220	should say something about this.
2590900	2593100	So they're doing these big anomalies, these live events.
2593620	2598460	They decided to, with a month's notice, spring it on people that, Oh, um, if you
2598460	2602220	want a badge for doing the anomaly, you're going to have to pay $13 for the badge,
2602500	2605540	which for years it's been free.
2605820	2611100	Like I understand they have to make money and that game is not making nearly the
2611100	2615340	same levels of money that Pokemon Go and Harry Potter probably are.
2615340	2621940	But to spring that on your player base, when mostly volunteers are organizing
2621940	2626980	these events for you with one month's notice is fucking tacky.
2627020	2627660	I'm sorry.
2627780	2632580	Like if they wanted to announce earlier this week that in 2020, this was going to
2632580	2634260	be the new design, then fine.
2634300	2637820	Then people can decide before they agree to, you know, volunteer and do all this
2637820	2640980	stuff, they at least will know what the rules are.
2640980	2644380	But to spring it with a month's notice when the planning started, like probably
2644380	2646740	five months ago, that was really shitty.
2647060	2651620	To be fair, they've gone back on it a little bit, but they're still being kind
2651620	2654540	of stingy when it comes to what they call offsite support.
2654860	2658940	So sometimes like, um, because there's so many people on the ground, they need
2658940	2663060	people to watch what's happening on their desktop on Intel and basically tell people
2663060	2666580	over walkie talkies, okay, ground team two, go to this portal ground team one.
2666580	2667900	So that's operations, right?
2668220	2672100	So, um, th those people have always gotten badges because they're, they're working
2672100	2672660	just as hard.
2672660	2673500	They're playing the game too.
2673500	2674780	They're just playing it in a different way.
2674980	2675380	Right?
2675660	2676020	Right.
2676260	2679340	They've decided and they've drawn a hard line there.
2679460	2681540	If those people want a badge, they have to pay money for it.
2682700	2686660	So I, I just thought that was a little shitty and Niantic needs to work on their
2686660	2687460	communications.
2687460	2688500	Cause that was junky.
2689140	2693860	Um, but then I went and did the hexathlon anyway.
2693860	2697580	So, but at least I can say, Hey, I know what I'm talking about with this game.
2697580	2701260	Cause I performed very well in that hexathlon.
2701260	2703740	So anyway, uh, that's enough about that game.
2703780	2705260	Let's get back into some more gaming news.
2705260	2708780	Cause there's been a lot of gaming news this week to get into not just Tokyo game
2708780	2711380	show, but other stuff around the world, literally the world, right?
2711380	2711660	Loki.
2711780	2716020	Yes, the world and the world's, uh, game here.
2716020	2721940	So the Olympics, of course, it's been talked about for a while that, you know,
2722660	2725500	they've been trying to get e-sports into the Olympics.
2725740	2729460	Um, and now we may be a little bit closer.
2729460	2736340	So originally, um, there was talks about getting e-sports into the 2020 summer
2736380	2738260	Olympics in Tokyo, Japan.
2739020	2742740	Uh, but apparently they're going to have a half a million dollar gaming tournament
2742740	2746700	hosted with Intel during the lead up to the Olympics.
2747140	2748860	So it's kind of close, I guess.
2749380	2754380	Um, they're saying they're going to have online qualifiers, which will be held to
2754420	2757100	fill out national teams of participating countries.
2757580	2764180	And then, um, the qualifying events going to be planned in June in Poland, and it's
2764180	2768260	going to decide who will move on to the official competition in Japan.
2769180	2776220	And then apparently they're going to, I guess, have this, uh, music hall that
2776220	2777300	they're going to do this in.
2777300	2783660	So right before like the start date, um, it's interesting that they're kind of
2783900	2785300	doing it and coincide with it.
2785300	2787860	I don't know if it's necessarily going to be something that's going to push them to
2787860	2789700	put it, make it officially in there.
2789860	2793220	But I think that wasn't this year that they're adding like a bunch of new, like,
2793340	2795140	like I want to say like skateboarding.
2795420	2799780	They do add new events every few years and they take events away too.
2799780	2805300	I want to say they got rid of something relatively popular and it
2805300	2806580	was getting heat for it.
2806620	2810460	Um, I don't want to speak out of turn, but I feel like it was like women's
2810460	2815700	baseball or something that they got rid of, that they got a lot of shit for.
2815700	2817180	Please correct me if I'm wrong in chat.
2817180	2819580	I'm sorry, I don't have the notes in front of me, but I feel like there was
2819580	2821340	some sport they got rid of that they're getting shit for.
2821420	2822860	So then they add sports.
2822860	2828940	So some of these like X games kind of stuff as you know, generation X has
2828940	2831980	grown up with those types of sports or what, what was it?
2832060	2834860	Uh, California games was really where all those remember that?
2834860	2836700	Remember that from the eighties, California games?
2836740	2836980	Yeah.
2837100	2839940	Um, I actually Olympic hacky sack against the Olympic hack.
2839980	2843300	I know a guy that worked on the programming for that game.
2843340	2845220	I really want to get him on the show at some point.
2845220	2846460	So we'll, we'll do that in the future though.
2846460	2848460	He actually was a writer on California games.
2848460	2850220	So I, anyway, we'll do that in the future.
2850460	2852020	But anyway, um, but yeah, like all those games.
2852020	2853740	So I, but it's like skateboarding and stuff.
2853780	2856180	So that's showing up in the Olympics now.
2856300	2859740	So they do badminton, I think was a sport they were going to add at some point too.
2859860	2860980	That's not in there already.
2861020	2862820	I thought, I thought that was the thing I was hearing.
2862820	2864860	I don't know if somebody in chat knows, but surprised.
2865100	2865420	Okay.
2865420	2869140	Bobby says they got rid of softball and baseball.
2869140	2870820	They got rid of softball women and base.
2870820	2874660	So they actually got rid of men's baseball, but they are bringing it back.
2874660	2875860	Apparently they're bringing back base.
2875860	2880500	I was going to say you can't have the Tokyo 2020 Olympics without baseball.
2880500	2883220	I mean, that's, and apparently badminton has been a sport for ages.
2883220	2883620	I'm sorry.
2883620	2887220	I can't remember what I was like, I was like, it's like, it's, if it's not a part
2887220	2891060	of the Olympics now, it's never going to be bad men.
2891780	2892620	That's super old.
2893540	2894660	Let's make lawn darts.
2895420	2898500	Lawn darts is part of a, it will be Olympics.
2899180	2900260	So I'm sorry, I might've missed it.
2900260	2902420	Did they say what games are going to be?
2902420	2906860	I mean, it makes sense that like with the Olympic games being in Tokyo, Japan
2906860	2909460	is very well known for being part of the video game industry.
2909460	2913020	So a lot of this makes sense that like, this is the, well, the two that they
2913020	2917220	were going to do, so they had street fighter five and rocket league as, um, so
2917220	2919820	each one of those is going to get a quarter million dollar prize pool.
2920220	2923220	Um, those are the two that they mentioned.
2923340	2931860	They were saying though, that apparently in the 2022 Asian, Asian games, um, there
2931860	2935900	was, they also had, um, competitions regarding league, league of legends,
2935900	2938780	Hearthstone, Starcraft two, among others.
2938860	2942420	So I don't know that it is tough.
2942420	2946460	Like, how would you pick which game that you play?
2947380	2948780	I mean, cause it would be changing almost.
2948780	2952700	I would imagine each time you go to the Olympics, they're talking like, you
2952700	2954100	know, several years in between.
2954540	2954940	Okay.
2954940	2956060	For what it's worth.
2956100	2959500	Um, I'm reading a Wikipedia article cause you know, that's the, that's
2959500	2962380	the source of all the information, but Hey, it's where you go when
2962380	2963220	you want to know stuff too.
2963620	2967700	It says in 2013, IOC leaders voted to drop wrestling from the
2967700	2969780	core program for the 2020 games.
2970020	2971580	And then that was surprising.
2971860	2975420	Um, but then later in 2013 in may, it says three of the eight sports under
2975420	2979100	consideration made the final shortlist, baseball, softball, squash, and wrestling.
2979300	2982220	Uh, the other five sports were rejected at this point.
2982460	2987740	Uh, karate, roller sports, sport, climate climbing, wakeboarding, and wushu.
2988180	2990660	Um, so roller sports, I'm sorry.
2990660	2992740	Wrestling was chosen to be included.
2992780	2993260	My bad.
2993420	2997460	So that was added for 2020 and 2024, but this is like.
2998060	3001500	Wrestling wrestling, not WWE wrestling.
3001540	3003980	There is a huge difference just so we're clear.
3004220	3006420	Well, yeah, this is, this is very different.
3006420	3008380	This is like, like high school wrestling.
3008380	3008620	Okay.
3008660	3012500	Um, so let's see, uh, the games are now an event based program
3012500	3014020	rather than sport gate based.
3014020	3014940	That's kind of interesting.
3015140	3019060	So, um, a list of eight sports was unveiled consisting of baseball, softball,
3019060	3022900	bowling, karate, roller sports, sport, climbing, squash, surfing, and wushu.
3023220	3025260	Um, interesting.
3026380	3026740	Hmm.
3027220	3031100	I still, I'm still, I wish I, there was just a fricking chart that said, added
3031140	3033100	these games, removed these games.
3033100	3036380	That would be a much easier for me to try to look through.
3036380	3037580	Maybe it's on this Olympic sport.
3037580	3040060	I'm trying to look, buy me time help.
3041740	3044340	Um, hi, but video games aren't there.
3044340	3045180	It's Mario and Sonic.
3045220	3047820	Oh, they're going to play discontinued sports.
3047860	3048620	There is a, okay.
3048620	3052060	I found the list discontinued rugby at one point was cricket.
3052300	3054340	No longer any limits, equestrian and vaulting.
3054900	3056620	Um, interesting.
3057380	3062060	So there is, there's an article on Olympic sports that I guess you can, uh, look up
3062060	3065340	if you want to know more information on that, um, but I guess there's a
3065500	3067300	look up if you want to know more information on that.
3067540	3071620	So, uh, SG 100, Matt says the hosting country gets more sway in terms
3071620	3072940	of what sports are at the Olympics.
3073140	3076100	When London got the Olympics, the EU voted out baseball because
3076100	3077260	it's not that popular there.
3077460	3080500	Since then the MLB pushed hard to get the games in Europe to
3080500	3081500	get it back in the Olympics.
3081540	3082220	Oh, interesting.
3082700	3086500	Um, Bobby also points out the IOC didn't want any e-sports
3086500	3088020	games that involved killing.
3088260	3090860	So no league of legends or counter-strike.
3090900	3091740	Oh, that's very interesting.
3091900	3096660	But I mean, even somebody else in chat said like rocket league makes a hell of a
3096660	3103900	lot of sense as like that game to push this discussion of sports, you know, video
3103900	3107940	games as an Olympic sport forward, like street fighter, even I have to admit.
3108180	3109060	Like I, and don't get me wrong.
3109100	3110100	I love street fighter.
3110260	3111900	I love street fighter two, I love street fighter four.
3112060	3112900	Street fighter five is okay.
3113180	3116180	But I, you know, but I like rocket league.
3116420	3119020	That one's really going to get people to go, okay.
3119020	3121260	It's like a little mix of all these different games.
3121420	3122540	It's not violent.
3122700	3123860	It's family friendly.
3124020	3128820	It's a good, it's a good barometer to see how video games can do in the Olympics.
3129180	3129540	Sure.
3129740	3132940	Anyways, anyway, so it's still an exhibition of sorts.
3132940	3136020	It's kind of something running side by side, but who knows, maybe in the future,
3136180	3141460	I still remember years ago on this show, maybe leading up to the 2004 Olympics, we
3141460	3144580	were talking about dance, dance revolution becoming an Olympic sport because didn't
3144580	3149820	one of those Nordic countries, um, decide to recognize DDR as a sport.
3150540	3153420	And I remember that was a whole discussion in one of the early episodes of OLR.
3153420	3156060	One of the, I don't even remember which country it was in Switzerland or
3156060	3159740	something like that, like actually, uh, recognized as a sport.
3159780	3166380	So anyway, cause you don't chat says in fencing, you pretend to stab a person.
3166420	3167540	That's in the Olympics.
3167940	3173820	I remember playing fencing in summer games too, by epics.
3173820	3178140	The, uh, you know, the, the, the precursor in many ways to, uh, California games,
3178300	3180660	there was summer games, there was winter games or some games too.
3180860	3182420	Fencing was in that and it was a lot of fun.
3182580	3187580	And then, do you know, when I saw fencing again in, uh, that James Bond movie with
3187580	3189580	Madonna, cause she was the fencing instructor.
3189700	3190460	Oh, that's right.
3190660	3197700	Cause so, so fencing is a very James Bond type of thing to me, like fencing, we're
3197700	3202460	going to go down to the yacht club and do some fencing today, posh posh, like it's
3202460	3206820	just, it's something posh by does in her spare time, it's not something for normal
3206820	3207340	people.
3207980	3208340	All right.
3208340	3208740	Anyway.
3209620	3209860	All right.
3209860	3210460	Let's move on.
3210500	3214300	Uh, let's talk about, let's talk about that Nintendo fitness, right?
3214300	3217580	Remember last week we saw the band, right?
3217580	3221700	So we saw that whole fitness device and this week we got a little more information
3221700	3222980	on what it is.
3223220	3226860	You know, I, you know what I started calling it because it's a device and you
3226860	3228140	can strap it onto your leg.
3228180	3229740	I've been calling it the Nintendo strap on.
3230180	3234140	So of course you have, can I, can I continue to call it that for the purposes
3234140	3234580	of this show?
3234620	3235540	Well, y'all know what I'm talking about.
3235540	3237500	If I talk about the Nintendo strap on.
3237980	3238340	Okay.
3238380	3238660	All right.
3238660	3243180	So anyway, uh, so the Nintendo's new fitness game was unveiled and the game is
3243180	3245380	going to be called ring fit adventure.
3245660	3249540	You strap on the joy con onto your leg and then you use the ring thing.
3249740	3253100	And then there's a whole little trail trailer that actually showed it's kind of
3253100	3254820	like a legit RPG.
3255140	3261220	And it makes me think of, do you remember in the three DS, how those me pass the
3261220	3264860	street pass games and there was the one, Oh, dark soccer helped me out here.
3264860	3266820	Cause you and I used to trade me's all the time.
3267020	3269380	And it was that adventure game where you would, you were saving.
3270580	3271260	Yeah.
3271260	3275620	And you like had different like abilities as you level through it.
3275660	3278740	And like depending on the colors of the shirts that people were wearing and they
3278740	3279660	were black all the time.
3279700	3280420	Yes, exactly.
3280420	3281020	Find me.
3281020	3281380	Thank you.
3281380	3282180	Thank you chat.
3282460	3286660	So, uh, find me, uh, was the, uh, uh, name of that game.
3286900	3289380	It kind of, I don't know, like with the arts on everything kind of reminded me
3289420	3291220	that, although obviously there's a little more to it.
3291220	3292740	Cause find me was very, very basic.
3292740	3295980	It was super basic, but let's talk a little bit before we talk about the game,
3295980	3300420	about the presentation, because what was up with that creepy ass dude?
3300820	3305100	Like fucking just like channeling Dennis from it's always sunny.
3305100	3307180	I swear to God, was she in danger?
3307340	3308900	Cause it looked like she was in danger.
3308900	3311500	It was getting his Jewish, like, what can you do?
3311540	3312020	All right.
3312260	3316620	Um, anyway, so if you want to move your character, you can actually jog or walk.
3316860	3319460	And then the ring con is what it's called.
3319460	3322380	So, you know, that looks like a little like hula hoop type of thing.
3322380	3326100	I don't know the ring con, uh, you actually interact with objects.
3326180	3330860	So you don't fight battles with magic, but you might do squats in
3330860	3333260	order to do cast a magic spell.
3333260	3336420	So it's, you know, it's gamifying exercise.
3336460	3339620	Well, when I saw that they were doing that, it's like, uh, doing like a bow
3339620	3342260	and arrow, like you pulled it back like a, a bow that was kind of cool.
3342820	3346340	So anyway, uh, so if you want your Nintendo ring con and strap
3346340	3350460	on, uh, it goes on sale on October 18th is the big day, $80.
3350780	3351500	Um, I don't know.
3351500	3352260	I might get it.
3352300	3355540	I'm all about like extra fit exercise gaming type of stuff.
3355540	3356300	Like why not?
3356460	3357380	What's another one?
3357900	3358420	Why not?
3358420	3360180	I got, we fit and all that stuff.
3360180	3360900	What's another one.
3361700	3362140	Yes.
3362140	3364940	I'm going to buy, I'm going to buy the Nintendo strap on.
3366540	3368100	Whereas it looks like an idiot.
3368140	3371860	I just don't want to buy more peripherals for the goddamn switch.
3372540	3376940	I have like, I have you buy the cardboard ship for your kids and we
3376940	3378820	haven't used it in like months.
3378860	3380340	It was a waste of money.
3380380	3382580	Why did I even buy that crap?
3382620	3383900	Cause you wanted to see VR.
3383940	3389260	It was fun to build it, but like it was like in the VR is okay, but
3389260	3392220	it's such a like minimal thing.
3392220	3393780	It's just, I don't know.
3393780	3396220	There's like not really much to it.
3397900	3400060	And it takes up a ton of fucking space.
3400300	3403540	Uh, so look, folks in chat are, are, are hype.
3403580	3406940	SSU 100 Matt says my girlfriend and I have already decided to go halves on this.
3407140	3410100	Bobby Black Wolf said my wife already has this pre-ordered
3410140	3412100	along with buying another doc.
3412340	3415140	I remember this cause they have like a fitness type area.
3415140	3416780	So, so wife gets a doc.
3416780	3419020	I'm going to tell you right now, I'm just going to wait for these to be
3419020	3422860	like piled up in Goodwill at some point because good, not going to
3422860	3426620	happen for a little bit because, because you know that Nintendo and
3426620	3429020	hardware is always a losing proposition.
3429020	3432500	So these things are going to be scarce on shelves because Nintendo
3432500	3434300	never makes enough of these things.
3434300	3437460	And the strap-ons are going to be in huge demand because that is what
3437460	3441020	happens when Nintendo products, every single goddamn time they
3441020	3442300	come out there on that shelf.
3442340	3446420	It's a piece of the audience is like, Oh, Nintendo, it's so beautiful.
3446420	3447940	You've put out another device.
3447940	3448980	I have to own it.
3450500	3453420	Nintendo could go out there wearing a fucking strap on and
3453420	3454540	the people would still buy it.
3455340	3458460	I'm probably not going to get that or many new games.
3458460	3460940	I'll be honest, other than the ones that are on my list, cause I do
3460940	3466820	have a unhealthy backlog and legit, a room full of games I'm not playing.
3466820	3469500	And I have DDR for a bunch of things.
3469500	3473300	If I want to exercise while I'm playing, I've got other things.
3473580	3476620	So sort of like, it's just the money grab.
3476820	3478940	I need something to encourage me to do sit-ups.
3478940	3481700	And since I can't like dark soccer, doesn't call me on a regular
3481700	3483620	basis to go wrap sit-ups.
3483660	3488020	So I saw this because I'm in a few different DDR communities
3488020	3491620	in Facebook and they have one for our, you know, if you own arcade
3491620	3495140	cabinets, um, and someone took one of their DDR cabinets, because
3495140	3497780	now MAME does support DDR and it runs at a full speed.
3498180	3502140	So they have, um, Hyper spin on it.
3502140	3506180	The front end that I was using for my, um, MAME cabinets and stuff like
3506180	3510780	that to select all the different official versions of DDR to play
3510780	3514260	them on your cabinet, using everything and step mania.
3514260	3515940	I'm like, Ooh, I'm doing that.
3516500	3517340	I'm doing that.
3517380	3517580	Okay.
3517660	3518620	So you've got, that's true.
3518620	3520140	You have a DDR machine in your house.
3520140	3521980	You've got your fitness routine down pat.
3522420	3525140	I don't, you know, we have a gym membership.
3525140	3530060	I was using until I decided to like, okay, like here's what every time I
3530060	3533580	saw like the footage that they're showing while it looks neat and stuff.
3533660	3537100	It reminds me of like the connect fitness games that they have or the
3537100	3539300	connect adventures type thing.
3539340	3543340	And it's going to be fun for a while and you're going to get bored
3543340	3545300	with it really fast is what I think.
3545300	3547580	And then you're stuck with this fucking peripheral that doesn't
3547580	3548900	do anything in any other game.
3549460	3550620	And that's my worry.
3550940	3554340	So that's why I'm just going to wait for the deep discount because people
3554340	3558020	are going to get bored with it really fast and then I'll pick it up.
3558660	3560940	And I just, I do want to send my love to those in the chat room.
3560940	3561980	They got my reference.
3562780	3564860	Nintendo, your smile is beautiful.
3564860	3565940	Did you stone that ring?
3565980	3566220	All right.
3566220	3568260	Anyway, uh, let's move on.
3568620	3570300	Meanwhile, Loki's like, I don't get it.
3571460	3572100	I don't.
3572220	3572740	It's fine.
3572900	3573580	That's all right.
3574380	3575740	Some things you don't have to.
3575740	3579580	Sometimes I speak a language that you can't hear and it's okay.
3580980	3583180	Anyway, moving on dark soccer.
3583180	3584500	Why don't you bring down the mood?
3584740	3587380	How about some game stop?
3588380	3591700	I know people like to call it the evil G, but man, they are suffering.
3592140	3599460	So, um, yeah, they're planning on closing about 180 to 200 poorly performing stores
3599460	3605580	by the end of the fiscal year and that's added to the 195 stores that already closed.
3606140	3610700	Um, this, uh, was announced during an earnings conference call.
3610700	3614780	There's no list of which stores are included in that right now.
3614780	3618020	They have over 5,700 stores in 14 countries.
3618580	3627620	Um, they said that basically, um, they're expecting that a lot of their, uh, in, in
3627620	3633540	store sales to fall, uh, like a five to 10% dip in earnings.
3634100	3640220	And, uh, it's pretty much looking like they are, they're on their way out.
3640260	3644020	They've lost over 415 million in their last quarter.
3645300	3649060	You need to carry less vinyl figures because there's a lot of like over a
3649060	3654020	hundred dollar vinyl figures in those stores and no kids size shirts, not the
3654020	3654540	pop fakes.
3654540	3657100	Those are fine because those are like cheap.
3657220	3662860	I'm talking like the Japanese anime, like busty, scantily clad, like figures that
3662860	3664540	they have there that are just cluttering.
3664540	3665940	I usually don't notice those, but yeah.
3665940	3671780	Um, but like they don't have kids size shirts, which seems like a big mistake to
3671780	3675340	me because you have kids going into the store buying stuff.
3675340	3680140	You have Ryan's world toys there, but you don't have like kids size t-shirts.
3680140	3682620	It's all adult size t-shirts, which is really weird.
3683140	3683940	Here's the thing.
3684020	3688540	I don't want to like shit on GameStop too much because the people that are really
3688540	3693300	being impacted by this and the stores closing are those retail workers.
3693340	3698140	Most of them making minimum wage and most of them pretty decent kids and adults
3698140	3700340	trying to just make some bucks.
3700340	3703260	Now, if you're one of those people that uses your GameStop job to go on a power
3703260	3707260	trip, as I think we've all run into that employee once in a while, then, you know,
3707340	3714220	buy, buy bitch, you know, but for the most, I would say a good 96% of people that
3714220	3716420	are working in the stores are just trying to make an honest living.
3716420	3720900	And for them, I feel bad and I don't want to bring on the snark too much, but I do
3720900	3723700	feel like a lot of us are sitting here going, well, we've kind of seen this
3723700	3726980	coming because GameStops are everywhere.
3726980	3729020	They are a bit saturated.
3729020	3730340	It's the same thing that happened with Subway.
3730420	3736380	They had a massive expansion and then a whole bunch of markets shifted over and
3736420	3741180	like Subway had this thing where they had like in some places, almost like how
3741180	3742380	Starbucks is spread out.
3742700	3747460	And but because they were all franchise stores, they weren't getting enough money
3747460	3748580	to keep one of them open yet.
3748580	3750100	They still had to pay their franchise fees.
3750500	3753780	But GameStop, I mean, it is corporate owned and all that, too.
3754020	3757940	But they did expand, I think, way too quickly for where the market was headed.
3758580	3763940	They did also put a statement on here that more people are turning to digital
3763940	3769740	outlets to buy. And so to compete, they're doing a new web platform with a buy
3769740	3771260	online pickup in store option.
3772180	3774860	Oh, yeah, because that that has worked out really well for Target.
3774860	3777060	They say they say Target does the same thing.
3777060	3780220	Yeah. Target had a really good quarter.
3780220	3784100	And they say that that type of stuff, like the app buying and picking up and that
3784100	3785620	stuff is doing like really good.
3785620	3788780	Sometimes their prices are cheaper online than they are in the store, which doesn't
3788780	3789900	make any goddamn sense.
3789900	3791100	But it's a promotion thing.
3791100	3792700	They're trying to push the usage of it.
3792700	3797260	Well, also, though, even though I'm trying not to give Amazon any more business, Amazon
3797260	3800700	recently had this thing where if you purchase something that you want to return, you can
3800700	3801940	actually return it to a Kohl's.
3802900	3805260	Oh, yeah, I heard about that. I did that just the other day and then Kohl's gave me a
3805260	3810860	coupon. I'm like, I will buy another stir fry pan that I don't need and then get they
3810860	3812260	give me like a 25 percent off coupon.
3812260	3816620	It was weird. So anyway, I hope the people that are going to be losing jobs over this,
3816620	3820180	like hopefully they're able to shuffle workers around, like maybe there's some seasonal
3820180	3823100	stuff and with school, maybe they can minimize some of that.
3823100	3828140	But I'm going to be honest, like where's the executive job loss to match?
3828340	3832220	I know they know they have the stuff for the magazine and there was something like where
3832220	3836260	the decision makers that made these shitty decisions, where are they at, though?
3836420	3841380	This takes me to another point about it, and it's going to come up again because I'm going
3841380	3844060	to bring up a point in another story that a friend came across to me.
3844660	3850140	But the problem is, is that a lot of times the companies are going to use this as an
3850140	3855300	excuse to try to guilt people into loyalty to the business because, oh, but our
3855300	3856900	employees are going to lose out on this.
3856900	3861780	Don't you care about the minimum wage workers when in reality we need to hold these big
3861780	3864220	businesses accountable for their treatment of their employees?
3864500	3868900	Like what's going on with well, this is what my beef is with the Amazon, with how they're
3868900	3874060	cutting health benefits to their part time employees at Whole Foods.
3874740	3881060	You know, this is I have a big problem with just the looser regulations are and the
3881060	3884140	terrible lack of ethics in a lot of these companies.
3884140	3885380	And it's all going back.
3885380	3887860	It's affecting their minimum wage workers.
3887860	3890820	It's affecting the people who are at the bottom of the food chain.
3891180	3896380	But even though we may feel sorry for them, we have to hold the people in power
3896380	3902460	accountable, make them hurt so that they because the companies that are most successful
3902460	3905420	that make the best money are the ones who invest in their employees.
3905620	3909180	Well, the government should provide health care for everyone, but that's sorry tangent.
3909180	3914700	Well, the government also needs to employ more energy efficient light bulbs.
3915500	3921300	Anyway, topic change, but I will point out in chat some of the other comments here, some
3921300	3926100	folks talking about how She-Hulk says they should have cut back a long time ago as the
3926100	3928060	talk of the ThinkGeek merger came up.
3928060	3931980	And I know we've talked about that GameStop has kind of evolved their stores a little
3931980	3935980	bit because they have seen the digital, you know what that's doing to the more physical
3935980	3937860	game sales and that whole thing.
3938620	3942020	So we've seen that they try to put more merchandise in their stores such as, I guess,
3942020	3946060	the vinyl. They have all sorts of stuff in their T-shirts and they do have they have a
3946060	3948420	ton of T-shirts and a lot of them are kind of cool.
3948420	3950180	I just wish they weren't polyester.
3950180	3953020	But I mean, they're like neat.
3953020	3955260	It's becoming more like hot topic every day.
3955260	3958020	But they also have a lot of garbage in there.
3958060	3963620	It's like I just don't like I was looking for Xbox One controllers the other day and I
3963620	3965500	couldn't find any, which was weird.
3966940	3971660	I'm assuming they're all behind the counter, though, but it's just I don't know.
3971660	3973740	They have like a section for like classic gaming.
3973740	3975500	It's such a pitiful looking thing.
3975500	3981660	It's like a few cartridges and stuff for the Super Nintendo and like a couple of Genesis
3981660	3983580	things and like a PlayStation one game.
3983580	3985020	It's like, why even have that here?
3985020	3986300	There's like nothing in it.
3986540	3988620	Let me read one more comment here and then we'll move on.
3988620	3992300	Questbuster in chat says their stock shot up earlier this year on news that they were
3992300	3993340	looking for a buyer.
3993340	3996860	But when no one stepped up, their stock tanked and kept declining since then.
3996860	4000980	So we'll see if if, you know, we'll see.
4000980	4002100	We'll see where it goes from here.
4002100	4005060	But it's it's it's not looking good right now.
4005060	4005980	But, you know, who knows?
4005980	4009420	Sometimes I'm trying to think of companies that have had like a success when they scaled
4009420	4013700	way back and then they kind of started to find their way again.
4013740	4017820	Well, I mean, I don't know if this is the best example, but like they say Toys R Us
4017820	4021980	is going to make a comeback like that now instead of being these giant stores, Toys
4021980	4024580	R Us are going to be more like boutique type of things like KB.
4024580	4025700	Yes, I know.
4025700	4026900	Funny, right?
4026900	4029500	And I guess that is where their strategical direction is.
4029500	4030060	But we'll see.
4030060	4033660	I'm trying to think of other like big companies, big, big companies that scaled way back and
4033660	4034980	have done well as a result.
4037620	4040140	I don't know, maybe somebody in chat knows, but anyway, let's move on.
4040140	4043060	I don't want to kill too much time because we have lots more news to cover.
4043100	4044620	So, Loki, why don't you go to our next story?
4044620	4047700	Yeah, so let's talk about Apple Arcade.
4047700	4051700	So they arcade they have happy about that.
4051700	4058260	The service is launching September 19th for $4.99 a month and you get access to more than
4058260	4059260	100 games.
4059260	4060260	It's cheaper.
4060260	4061260	And I thought it would be.
4061260	4062260	That's for sure.
4062260	4064420	They had some games that they're showing off.
4064420	4070340	It was part of the Rayman Pac-Man, Shantae, Steven Universe and Choo-Choo Rocket games.
4070340	4071620	I'm looking forward to Shantae.
4071620	4076340	There's a new Square Enix RPG called From the Creators of Bravely Default as well.
4076340	4079620	It's coming to that.
4079620	4085580	They're saying, though, that along with that, the service is also coming to Apple TV on
4085580	4092500	September 30th and Mac OS Catalina in October.
4092500	4093500	And what else?
4093500	4097100	I might be convinced to do this on Apple TV, like I'm going to be honest, like a lot of
4097100	4100980	these games I'm hearing, I'm like, I don't really want to play any of that on my phone.
4101060	4105340	But if it's coming to the TV and there's some type of like Bluetooth controller or something,
4105340	4106340	I don't know.
4106340	4107980	Like, I just don't want to play touch games.
4107980	4109460	I don't want to play these games touch.
4109460	4110460	What?
4110460	4115020	I might be selling my Apple TV to get the 4K one.
4115020	4117740	And I have a SteelSeries controller, which I can tell you works beautifully with the
4117740	4118740	Apple TV.
4118740	4119740	Fun.
4119740	4120740	Well, maybe I'd be into that.
4120740	4121740	We'll see.
4121740	4125540	One game that looks awesome that I want to check out is Exit the Gungeon, which is, of
4125540	4132140	course, a follow up to Enter the Gungeon and is a side scroller type game now, but still
4132140	4133140	a shooter.
4133140	4137460	And they even changed the theme song to Exit the Gungeon, which is great.
4137460	4138460	Some other cool stuff.
4138460	4140600	So they have a game called Overland.
4140600	4144540	It's kind of this apocalyptic road trip game.
4144540	4149740	They've got Choo Choo Rocket Universe, Ballistic Baseball.
4149740	4150740	What other cool stuff?
4150740	4158260	So yeah, the Pac-Man Party Royale, Projection First Light, Rayman Mini, looks like a new
4158260	4167380	game, Shantae and the Seven Sirens, Sneaky Sasquatch, and Super Impossible Road.
4167380	4168380	Lots of different games.
4168380	4171620	I will give it to Apple as much as I'm a little bit like, I don't know what I want to play
4171620	4176260	on my phone versus, I will say this, like $4.99 is less than I thought it would be.
4176260	4179500	I was for sure thinking it was going to be $9.99.
4179500	4187220	And they're not just putting out like a couple things, like their TV service, sorry, but
4187220	4190620	there's a lot of like big stuff here.
4190620	4194460	And you know, putting the two side by side, I think this arcade stands to do better than
4194460	4200660	their TV service, which I don't think is ready for prime time, but that's just my opinion.
4200660	4201660	But this looks great.
4201660	4204940	Yeah, it does look pretty, it looks decent.
4204940	4206540	I don't have any Apple devices.
4206540	4210980	So whatever, on purchase, exit the Gungeon whenever that comes out.
4210980	4213460	I know, I know you're all about the Gungeon games.
4213460	4217060	So when I first heard of exit the Gungeon, I was like, oh, I wonder if they took Loki's
4217060	4221420	idea because you kind of did a different twist on the Gungeon theory.
4221420	4222420	Oh, yeah.
4222420	4223420	Yeah.
4223420	4224420	It's funny.
4224420	4225420	So.
4225420	4226420	All right.
4226420	4227420	Anyway.
4227420	4228420	Yeah.
4228420	4230300	Apple Arcade coming out and that's really sets right around the time the new iPhone
4230300	4231300	is coming out.
4231300	4234100	Because of course, this is all part of that Apple announcement where what we had a new
4234100	4239260	iPhone 11 with the triple triad camera.
4239260	4240260	The new watch, right?
4240260	4241260	There's a new watch.
4241260	4242260	There's the new...
4242260	4244620	I feel like they, did they do a new computer?
4244620	4245620	I don't know.
4245620	4250180	I couldn't, I couldn't, I was in class so I couldn't watch or follow a live blog or
4250180	4253260	anything so I had to like get the data dump after the fact.
4253260	4257900	So yeah, but I definitely saw that new phone because I don't know, like there was a part
4257900	4260340	of me was like, do I really need those three cameras?
4260340	4263660	And then when I heard that it lets you take better animal pictures, I was like, yes I
4263660	4270060	do.
4270060	4271060	Come on.
4271060	4272340	You want the smoosh pics too.
4272340	4274340	You know you do.
4274340	4276860	All right.
4276860	4280580	Let's move on and talk about something else to look forward to in the future.
4280580	4284860	I don't know if this would be on iPhone or Android, but it's definitely something that'll
4284860	4288460	be on the next round of consoles or maybe the current round, maybe the next round.
4288460	4289460	I don't know.
4289460	4291780	But that is a new Mega Man game.
4291780	4292780	That's right.
4292780	4295900	Mega Man has confirmed a new Mega Man game is in development.
4295900	4300660	And that's great news because, you know, obviously Mega Man 11 came out and we all kind of think
4300660	4302820	it did well, but we haven't really had the hard facts to know that.
4302820	4305700	I still haven't played that other than the demo.
4305700	4308900	Well, you know what, we're getting into the time of year where there's probably gonna
4308900	4309900	be a ton of sales.
4309900	4313220	If you want to pick up on it, you know, now I still haven't played through 9 or 10 either.
4313220	4315860	I wish they'd do another X series.
4315860	4320040	Well to be fair, they did not say Mega Man 12 is happening.
4320040	4322460	They said another Mega Man title is in development.
4322460	4324220	In fact, let's get into the quotes.
4324220	4328940	It was an interview with the site 4gamer who asked, what can you tell us about the next
4328940	4329940	game to be developed?
4329940	4333780	The most recent game, Mega Man 11, was amazing, and we are expecting the revival of the Star
4333780	4334780	Force series.
4334780	4337860	Personally, I'd like to see the Command Mission saga be brought back.
4337860	4344900	And in this interview with producer Kazuhiro Tsuchiya said, I see, there's a lot of titles
4344900	4347960	I personally want to work on, but to tell you the truth, the next game to be developed
4347960	4349480	has already been decided on.
4349480	4352180	I'd just like to keep the specific details hidden for the moment.
4352180	4354540	Please wait until we make an announcement.
4354540	4355820	Please look forward to it.
4355820	4359780	Still, I think that there's no such thing as a spinoff in the Mega Man series.
4359780	4362020	Every saga is a main series on its own.
4362020	4367380	When speaking of Mega Man, there will always be people who think of X as well as people
4367380	4369220	who think of EXE.
4369220	4374780	And I think that's why each one's concept of what Mega Man is changes depending on the
4374780	4375780	generation.
4375780	4379140	For that reason, we don't want to deny any series of its future.
4379140	4380140	Legends!
4380140	4381540	I want legends, dammit!
4381540	4386500	You beat me to it because I was going to say, at this time Kazuhiro Tsuchiya, I would
4386500	4391820	like you to please consider three simple words, Mega Man Legends.
4391820	4395700	Come on, because it'd be way better now that the controls won't suck, right?
4395700	4396700	Oh my God.
4396700	4397700	But all right, fine.
4397700	4399340	If they do an X game, cool.
4399340	4402420	But I think it is worth noting, he's not saying Mega Man 12.
4402420	4406220	It could be, in fact, he's kind of shifting the conversation to be like, it's probably
4406220	4407380	going to be something else.
4407380	4411480	Or what was that Sonic game where they had like new Sonic and classic Sonic, let's have
4411480	4416640	like X and let's get Mega Man X and regular Mega Man in there.
4416640	4417640	I know what you're talking about.
4417640	4418640	Sonic Generations.
4418640	4419640	That's it, Generations.
4419640	4420640	Yeah.
4420640	4421640	So like, I want that.
4421640	4422640	Let's just take all the different Mega Man types.
4422640	4424980	We'll put it all into one game.
4424980	4428520	Like he can be a big RPG, open world.
4428520	4430140	It's not too much to ask for, right?
4430140	4432320	I like the way that Nifty 805 put it.
4432320	4436960	Category is legends only.
4436960	4437960	I like that.
4437960	4438960	All right.
4438960	4443040	Anyway, a new Mega Man coming soon, dot, dot, dot.
4443040	4444040	All right.
4444040	4446720	Uh, let's move on to the next story, Dark Sakura.
4446720	4449000	I think you were referencing this earlier.
4449000	4450360	Yes, I was.
4450360	4456480	So in other corporate bullshit, don't you just love that introduction to the story?
4456480	4459360	Kickstarter is now even more full of bullshit.
4459360	4462960	They fired and actually it's a little bit incorrect because I think they've now fired
4462960	4469760	three employees for participating in starting a union, which we've talked before about there
4469760	4473200	being a massive need for unions in the video game industry.
4473200	4479000	And Kickstarter definitely has like their, you know, hands, arms, feet, and legs somewhere
4479000	4481440	attached to the video game industry and not in their own cart.
4481440	4484640	Well, and if I remember right, what makes this video game related is that one of the
4484640	4490640	people, maybe the first one that was let go was their like video game like liaison.
4490640	4495040	And they had, um, like a guy who just started a podcast on it too, cause I follow him on
4495040	4496040	Twitter.
4496040	4498240	Oh, maybe it was the podcast person actually.
4498240	4500640	I knew it was, I knew it was relevant to one of my interests.
4500640	4503800	Well, I am so sad to hear that he's never going to be able to get his podcasts off the
4503800	4504800	ground now.
4504800	4507520	Actually he's got a new podcast and it's doing pretty well.
4507520	4511840	So anyway, um, cause I mean there's other crowdsourcing things out there anyway, but
4511840	4514360	he's already got name recognition on him.
4514360	4522280	So, um, but at any rate, they fired several employees for starting, uh, to unionize.
4522280	4531100	And um, and in fact I had a reposted it not long ago on my, uh, my thing, but they tried
4531100	4536480	to get him to sign an NDA to give him a month of severance after he had been with companies
4536480	4537840	since it started.
4537840	4540120	And he's like, no, I'm not signing your fucking NDA.
4540120	4541280	I'm going to be public about it.
4541280	4543400	And I'm like, good for you, dude.
4543440	4546960	So, um, I mean he probably said it nicer than I did.
4546960	4552080	So yeah, uh, Taylor Moore, um, said, and I'm going to read the quote this morning after
4552080	4555940	six years of pouring my life into the mission people and creators of Kickstarter, I was
4555940	4558840	fired for union organizing.
4558840	4562320	Last week, another member of the union organizing committee was fired and we have reason to
4562320	4565260	believe that more are being targeted.
4565260	4568900	The union busting campaign at Kickstarter that Kickstarter management is engaging in
4568900	4573700	is illegal and wrong and is a dramatic abandonment of the values of an organization that I've
4573700	4576220	loved and served with my whole heart.
4576220	4579220	Um, and in fact it actually is illegal.
4579220	4580220	Union busting is illegal.
4580220	4585920	Um, are, we have laws about this even though certain orange creatures in power are trying
4585920	4586920	to undo that.
4586920	4591020	Has Kickstarter responded trying to shift the conversation, trying to blame it on him
4591020	4592020	or something?
4592020	4593020	I mean, I don't know.
4593020	4594020	I'm just curious if they've responded.
4594140	4600000	So, um, a Kickstarter, uh, spokesperson said this, when someone has been through this process
4600000	4603620	and we have sufficient evidence that their performance is not improving, we must unfortunately
4603620	4604620	part ways with them.
4604620	4605620	See what they're doing?
4605620	4606620	Mm hmm.
4606620	4609900	This is not as interesting as the story about union busting, but it is the reality of what
4609900	4610900	happened here.
4610900	4614820	Not that it's fucking bullshit because this person has been with the company and started
4614820	4619420	very successful, um, uh, events.
4619820	4624420	Why'd you keep this guy for six years if his performance was questionable?
4624420	4629460	I mean, I know sometimes people can get senioritis and stuff and slip in their performance, but
4629460	4631100	this does seem awfully convenient.
4631100	4633160	Well, and there's more about this.
4633160	4638300	The company also said that of 28 members who have publicly come out in support of the union,
4638300	4644980	14 to 15 who are eligible for raise or promotion during this review cycle received one or both.
4644980	4649400	It's still though, I mean, you can, so they're trying to say, don't
4649400	4650400	look over here.
4650400	4651400	Look over here.
4651400	4657000	But on top of that, you can still perform well and want to benefit other people.
4657000	4660440	You know, this is why I get all those, you know, I don't understand all these people
4660440	4667360	who are like, well, you know, like they want to put a, um, a, uh, gosh, I can't make my
4667360	4668360	words come out.
4668360	4675480	Like for the people who want to tax anything over a higher income bracket and they're like,
4675480	4679920	it's not affecting you personally, the money is going to go back into you.
4679920	4684480	Just because these people are doing well doesn't mean they shouldn't contribute to the wellness
4684480	4685480	of other people.
4685480	4689680	And it's also kind of one of those, like, what about all the good things I did argument?
4689680	4691200	It doesn't negate the bad thing.
4691200	4695440	Well, I mean, there were medical advancements that came out of the Holocaust, but it was
4695440	4696440	still bullshit.
4696440	4699760	I wasn't going to go there, but you know, but I'm going to, I'm going to go there.
4699760	4701980	I'm going to throw that as an example.
4701980	4709380	You know, good people will try more Liberty to do that than I do, but yeah, and, but anyway,
4709380	4713460	you know, and on top of that, they sell, send out an email.
4713460	4719940	The Kickstarter United group, um, uh, basically said that was a vile, a violation of their
4719940	4725020	public benefit pledge that the company made in 2015 and they're saying, Kickstarter United
4725020	4726460	is under attack.
4726460	4729220	This is what it means to be a public benefit corporation.
4729220	4733560	How can we continue to reconcile the discrepancies between the flaunting of our company's mission
4733560	4735300	and the way we treat our employees?
4735300	4738300	Are these a value of Kickstarter PPC?
4738300	4742020	I'm going to be honest when it comes to this story, like I, and you know, all the, the
4742020	4747900	anti-union stuff is silly and you know, Kickstarter needs to just, you know, realize that they're
4747900	4749540	on the wrong side of this.
4749540	4753560	However, I'm kind of with Kai's, Judo's first comment here in chat, Kickstarter is still
4753560	4754560	a thing.
4754560	4756420	Like that's kinda like, I'm going to be honest, it's kind of where I'm at.
4756420	4759660	I'm trying to think, like, when was the last time I backed a Kickstarter?
4759660	4764040	Probably that and stream Kickstarter, which I don't, which I don't regret doing and stream
4764040	4765720	has been a great service there.
4765720	4770460	They're great on their discord and the service is coming along nicely.
4770460	4775400	And part of the, a big part of the reason why I backed that one in particular was because
4775400	4779020	they weren't asking me to fund something that hasn't even had a one line of code written
4779020	4780020	yet.
4780020	4782660	They were essentially taken pre-orders through Kickstarter.
4782660	4785980	It's essentially what they were doing, trying to get kind of that seed money to get that
4785980	4791500	oomph out the door when we've seen too many Kickstarter projects crash, burn, fail, never
4791500	4792500	get out the door.
4792500	4799020	So too many projects, unfortunately like Bloodstained, but more so other big floppy projects have
4799020	4801020	kind of ruined it for everybody else.
4801020	4802700	I did exactly three.
4802700	4804540	We did Bloodstained.
4804540	4812100	I did the asexual D20 pin, which I don't know where it is because my sash is missing.
4812100	4814300	I think I lost it at Dracon.
4814300	4816300	And then I did the hottiful boyfriend plushies.
4816300	4818060	I'm not saying all Kickstarters are bad.
4818060	4823200	Like I remember backing the first gamer X back in the day, which I don't regret doing.
4823200	4826980	You know, it was a needed thing and I'm glad we had it for as long as we did, you know,
4826980	4827980	and all that.
4827980	4830340	Um, but like, I'm not saying all Kickstarter projects are bad.
4830340	4834620	I'm just saying because of all the weird things that have happened over the years, like I'm
4834620	4835980	more apprehensive to do it.
4835980	4839380	And I see less of them get promoted these days because so much of it gets lost in the
4839380	4841740	noise because you know what does get promoted.
4841740	4844740	Now it's a GoFundMe to pay so-and-so's medical bills.
4844740	4849020	That's the big thing you see all over Facebook, which is a whole nother commentary.
4849020	4853140	I don't want to get into, but is that's where the conversation seems to be at.
4853140	4859500	Whether or not though you believe in unions, this is highly suspect and it is illegal.
4859500	4864740	It is illegal, especially, and even if it had nothing to do with it, I would still wait
4864740	4870640	until there's like a gap of time between when this person just starts trying to unionize.
4870640	4874080	You know, that just looks really shitty on you, Kickstarter.
4874080	4881400	And on top of that, you know, one of my friends on my, one of my other Facebooks said, um,
4881400	4885520	you know, but doesn't this harm the people who use Kickstarter to get their businesses
4885520	4887560	started or don't have any other way to raise capital?
4887560	4889880	I mean, there's other ways to raise capital.
4889880	4894840	There are other crowdfunding sources on there and they are going to use this actively to
4894840	4896340	protect their interests.
4896340	4901200	They are going to use their, the, the people who are using their service as their meat
4901200	4903940	shield and we cannot let that happen.
4903940	4908820	We have to show them using a meat shield like this is not going to help you.
4908820	4911180	We will hold your ass to the fire.
4911180	4914100	And then that means they stop using the meat shield hopefully when they see it's not going
4914100	4915100	to do shit.
4915100	4916100	All right.
4916100	4922660	I, I encourage everyone at this point, look hard and deep into it and actually sit and
4922660	4927460	make a decision about it and make sure that if you continue to support them, you have
4927460	4929420	a damn good reason why you're doing it.
4929420	4930420	All right.
4930420	4933540	Well, with that, in the interest of time, we're going to move on to the next story.
4933540	4936580	So back to, uh, back to classic video game stuff.
4936580	4940900	One thing that, yeah, they're, they're not funded, but they're, they're sure a dime a
4940900	4941900	dozen these days.
4941900	4942900	Yeah.
4942900	4946380	We talked a little bit about this Neo Geo arcade stick that was out there that we didn't
4946380	4949700	really know what it was aside from it's an arcade stick for the Neo Geo.
4949700	4952620	Is it for like using on the Neo Geo?
4952620	4953960	I mean, what the hell is it?
4953960	4960500	So apparently though, this is going to be, um, you can plug it into a PC to use it with,
4960500	4967740	I guess, uh, PC games that, you know, SNK PC games, I would assume, or it can also be,
4967740	4971200	um, like a Neo Geo mini console.
4971200	4975340	So you can actually hook up, um, other controllers to it as well.
4975340	4981980	It's got 20 classic Neo Geo games inside, so you can also attach to TV via HDMI 20 Neo
4981980	4982980	Geo games.
4982980	4986920	So basically every king of fighters that they've made every fatal fury, every art of fighting
4986920	4988060	and every samurai showdown.
4988060	4989060	That's 20 games, right?
4989060	4990060	Oh shit.
4990060	4993680	No, there's at least eight summary showdown games.
4993680	4997220	And keep in mind, there's been a KOF game ever since 90, 94.
4997220	5000580	My joke there is that Neo Geo is like nothing but fighters, although we know, of course
5000580	5003460	there's other metal slug.
5003460	5004460	I know.
5004460	5005460	I know.
5005460	5010220	Uh, the, um, puzzle games, uh, puzzle bobble, all those games were, um, full star blazing
5010220	5015780	star, uh, magical drop one of my favorite puzzlers anyway, do we know what the list
5015780	5017180	of games that are on this yet?
5017180	5018180	Nope.
5018180	5019180	Oh, no idea.
5019180	5020180	Stay tuned kids.
5020180	5021180	Yep.
5021180	5022180	All right.
5022180	5026740	Well then, uh, let's move on and talk a little bit about, uh, something scary that, uh, is
5026740	5028780	going to be coming soon to your mobile phone.
5028780	5032340	It's a five nights at Freddy's AR game.
5032340	5036140	Uh, so five nights at Freddy's soon going to be moving to AR.
5036140	5039900	That sounds horrifying because when I first heard about this, I was like, Oh my God, is
5039900	5044700	it like something for hololens that is going to tear, even though hololens really isn't
5044700	5047020	a gaming thing at this point is going to terrify me.
5047020	5050740	That's what I thought when I first read this, but no AR of course, uh, is becoming bigger
5050740	5052860	and bigger on iOS and Android.
5052860	5057700	So, uh, you know, like think like the Harry Potter game and Pokemon go have those AR so
5057700	5061360	you can actually do AR through your phone and that's how it's going to work.
5061400	5067160	So, uh, yeah, it actually uses the air, the area around you to, uh, play five nights at
5067160	5070660	Freddy's is called five nights at Freddy's AR special delivery.
5070660	5073000	It's being developed by illuminix.
5073000	5077840	So I don't know to what extent the original creator, Scott Cawthon is, uh, involved with
5077840	5082120	this, but he's also involved on other projects like the movie adaptation, which I guess really
5082120	5083120	is coming in.
5083120	5086120	I want to see the movie, even though I am not a fan of the game, I still want to see
5086120	5087120	the movie.
5087120	5090560	Apparently HD versions of the original games are going to be happening as well next year.
5090600	5093080	And, uh, he's working on a triple a title apparently right now.
5093080	5099120	So, uh, not just the AR game, but, uh, anyone interested in five nights at Freddy's on AR?
5099120	5100120	I think that's cool.
5100120	5101120	I don't know how it's going to work.
5101120	5102120	It's going to be a little much.
5102120	5103120	The VR game sounds cool.
5103120	5105120	I'm like the cat gift that says nope.
5105120	5106760	Yeah.
5106760	5107760	Too scary for me.
5107760	5111480	At least it's on a little iPhone or Android or so it's not going to be too pure.
5111480	5117520	I actually think like not having all the lights off and playing in the dark and that whole
5117520	5118520	thing.
5118520	5122040	Too bad when they say, you know, five nights at Freddy's AR game, they're not talking about
5122040	5124680	like a Pokemon go type of game.
5124680	5125680	Act deaf.
5125680	5126680	Just like we have Pokemon go.
5126680	5127680	Now we have five nights.
5127680	5128680	Run the fuck away.
5128680	5132080	Both, both ends of the spectrum, both ends of the spectrum there.
5132080	5133080	Love it.
5133080	5134080	All right.
5134080	5137600	Well, let's take a trip down memory lane to a more classic time when you know, games,
5137600	5139040	games weren't AR.
5139040	5140040	They were not.
5140040	5141120	I was trying to find the music.
5141120	5144840	If you wanted AR, you had to like draw things and put them up on your TV.
5144840	5145840	No, I don't know.
5145840	5150160	All right.
5150160	5152280	It's the classic game of the week.
5152280	5154680	Every week, dark soccer steps in the gaming vault and finds the game.
5154680	5157400	She thinks, Hey, you guys should be respecting this game.
5157400	5160200	Little surprise to your pick this week inspired by a tattoo I saw.
5160200	5161200	Ah, okay.
5161200	5163520	Cause I was like, not the type of game dark soccer usually talks about.
5163520	5168080	No, but it's, it's relevant, I guess it's a, it's a, it's kind of a big deal for some
5168080	5169080	people.
5169080	5170080	Yeah.
5170080	5174880	So, um, the game I picked was God of war.
5174920	5180120	And I mean, I honestly, I watched like a full play through of the last God of war game and
5180120	5181120	I thought it looked pretty good.
5181120	5183080	So if it led to that, then this is cool.
5183080	5187880	But anyway, it's a third person hack and slash adventure that was developed by Santa Monica
5187880	5190840	studio and published by Sony.
5190840	5196680	It came out March 22nd, 2005 for the PlayStation two is the first one in a long series and
5196680	5202880	it is very loosely based on Greek mythology set in ancient Greece.
5202880	5211520	You control Kratos who is a Spartan who serves the gods and Athena sells Kratos to go kill
5211520	5212760	Ares.
5212760	5218680	Um, and basically Ares did some bullshit and tricked him into killing his wife and daughter
5218680	5223040	and was besieging Athens and all kinds of shit.
5223080	5234320	So anyway, it is a big combat, you know, type of combo game where, uh, your main, uh, weapon,
5234320	5239560	the blades of chaos, um, you work, uh, you basically are going to use that weapon.
5239560	5240720	I think you can like another one in the game.
5240720	5246700	I actually haven't played it, but it has different quick, hi smoosh, but, um, it has different
5246700	5250440	quick time events in the game that you have to do through controller actions.
5250440	5252640	Um, it's involved in the boss battles too.
5252640	5259400	It has some puzzles and platforming, um, and it actually was, uh, at the time the 11th
5259400	5261800	best PlayStation two game of all time now.
5261800	5267880	So 4.6 million copies worldwide and it won several game of the year awards.
5267880	5273920	Um, IGN considered it as a 2009 to be the seventh best PS two game of all time.
5273920	5276920	It had great graphics, story, gameplay.
5276920	5280200	It was just really a tight ship with that.
5280240	5286000	And then that and its sequel were released in November, 2009 as the God of War collection
5286000	5291320	and then a remastered version in 2012 as God of War saga for PS three.
5291320	5296880	There was a novelization and a film adaptation has been in development since 2005.
5296880	5304560	Um, and you fight all kinds of new mythological creatures, the undead minotaurs, Gorgons,
5304560	5311840	clopsies, sirens, uh, different bosses, and a minotaur called Pandora's guardian.
5311840	5313440	I just think that's a cool name.
5313440	5319720	Um, you also open chest, they have orbs and orbs do shit like heal you and give you experience
5319720	5321000	and stuff.
5321000	5327040	Um, and you get like special items that make you stronger and give you more help than magic
5327040	5328520	and stuff like that.
5328520	5331760	Um, but you use the blades of chaos in the game.
5331760	5336160	They are blades attached to chains, they're wrapped around the wrists and forearms and
5336160	5340880	the, they are used in special types of attacks and I'm sure if anyone's watching live right
5340880	5345840	now, you can see how you can swing them out or use them in close quarters as a melee weapon.
5345840	5350880	So it's quite fierce, it is hardcore.
5350880	5361520	And then, um, there also is a quick time, but looky mini game where you have to do female
5361520	5362520	twins.
5362520	5363520	Anyway.
5363520	5369040	Um, so yeah, um, then you get the challenge of the gods after you've beaten the game,
5369040	5374720	which is an unlockable, and um, you have to complete certain tasks and then with that,
5374720	5377880	you get costumes, behind the scenes videos, and concept art.
5377880	5383400	So you get, instead of like, oh, you do well, let's give you some, you know, levels that
5383400	5388720	are gonna just make you cry for an hour, here's actually stuff that you'll enjoy.
5388720	5396440	And um, so the game has, you know, clearly had some staying power if we, you know, just,
5396440	5401780	not too long ago, the last game that came out was really good and added sort of another,
5401780	5407280	I would say angle to the character kind of, if anything, I think humanized him a bit more,
5407280	5414960	even though he's now like this hardcore old god kind of guy now in the last game, right?
5415000	5418480	Yeah, I gotta admit, like talking about this game makes me, you know, I kind of missed
5418480	5423320	the boat on this recent reimagining, I guess you will, of God of War where Kratos is now
5423320	5428080	like daddy Kratos, um, and I was super interested in that game just because of the different
5428080	5433840	tone and just sounding like the, um, the maturity, not to say this game was immature, it's not,
5433840	5438000	but like, well it did have the like, gooey mini game, but like, you know, the certain
5438000	5443000	maturity of the developers in, as they're getting older, in wanting to make a game that
5443040	5446360	kind of reflects that, like I just found that really fascinating and kind of interesting
5446360	5451120	and like that was, and everybody says it's great, but you know, the thing is here, yes,
5451120	5454240	we do a podcast about video games, we love video games, we don't have enough time to
5454240	5457560	play every single game that gets released, you know, sometimes we miss things, but that
5457560	5460840	one I've been meaning to pick up. I wanted to touch on this just because it is kind of
5460840	5465480	near and dear to a lot of people, but you know, I do also like that storytelling now
5465480	5471120	is really taking a bigger level of maturity to it and that people are being more sensitive
5471160	5475840	to their audiences and actually trying, you know, the fan service is there, yeah, but
5475840	5480880	you are also getting quite a bit more of, yeah, you have the fan service there, but
5480880	5487720	it's a bonus to the good story and gameplay. But at any rate, the game itself is built
5487720	5494720	on the Kinetica engine and it was inspired by two things, by Onimusha and by Clash of
5495440	5501040	the Titans. I figured Clash of the Titans, I didn't figure Onimusha, that's neat.
5501040	5508040	David Jaff, who, you know, was the game director and creator, he said that he had played Onimusha
5512600	5517460	and said, let's do that with Greek mythology and then of course watching Clash of the Titans,
5517460	5522120	he wanted to take that concept and kind of merge it with Heavy Metal, not like the movie,
5522120	5526600	but like Heavy Metal magazine, which I mean the movie came from Heavy Metal magazine.
5526720	5533720	And then he wanted to just bump up this to being really high level sex and violence.
5537240	5541120	But then, you know, they wanted it brutal, they wanted it to be terrible, they wanted
5541120	5547640	you to be a beast, but, you know, I think also that's kind of what the popularity and
5547640	5552080	things were at that time was pushing those things and I think they've realized that you
5552080	5559080	can have those things and have a mature story, have good storytelling, have great gameplay,
5559800	5566800	and have it still be brutal and hard. At any rate, yeah, there have been, you know, like
5567600	5572840	I said, there were multiple re-releases, there was, you know, lots of, you know, the soundtrack
5572840	5578600	for it was actually pretty amazing. It had its own release on there and it was actually
5578600	5582560	considered one of the best soundtracks that came out and that soundtrack was released
5582560	5587800	in 2010, again, as downloadable content for the God of War trilogy soundtrack and God
5587800	5594400	of War III Ultimate Edition. But it was received very well, the story was considered compelling
5594400	5600520	and it won many, like I said, Game of the Year awards and David Jaff won Designer of
5600520	5606080	the Year awards, I don't know if I'm mispronouncing his name, but whatever. And then there was,
5606080	5609960	you know, a novelization about it, which I might actually bother to read the novelization.
5609960	5614640	But, you know, whenever they do novelizations, they'll usually, like, get more elements that
5614640	5620520	they want to put into the story, so I kind of dig those. And there's a film in, well,
5620520	5627520	that's been announced in 2005. In development hell. They actually sent the script out to
5630420	5635840	Daniel Craig and he turned it down. And then they said they've got someone else on there
5635840	5641320	for it and they might like them. And they were bringing in the writers for Pacific Rim,
5641320	5646480	so Pacific Rim was great. Second one, I didn't see it, not so much. But hey, I'll believe
5646480	5649080	it when I see it. But there you go, it's God of War.
5649080	5654960	Alright, your classic game of the week, God of War for the PlayStation 2. That's right,
5654960	5661960	the PlayStation 2 is a classic console. Under our 10 years or more rule, a lot of PS3 games
5662680	5669680	qualify as well. So, there it is. Alright, anyhow. Yeah, a series that I've played a
5670120	5673440	little bit, but I've more, like, watched my friends play it. I haven't really got my hands
5673440	5678560	on it myself. I would definitely, even if you don't play the game, just watch this last
5678560	5681400	one. Well, even just, oh, the last one. I was gonna say, you were just putting together
5681400	5684920	the footage for tonight. I was kind of, like, watching it going, oh, yeah, yeah, I remember
5684920	5690400	this. So, yeah, I definitely wanna, it's one of those things, like, it's on my list. I'll
5690400	5695960	get to that at some point. Horizon Zero Dawn, eventually. They're, like, on a list.
5695960	5699440	So, it's Jaffe, pardon me. Yeah, it's alright. I didn't really care anything about God of
5699440	5702960	War until I watched the playthrough of the last one. Gotcha. I would probably skip the
5702960	5709160	first two, honestly, just because the last one was so, so much more interesting to me.
5709160	5712320	Yeah. Well, they have that trilogy to the, like, you know, if you wanna catch up, they
5712320	5717880	have that trilogy they put on PS4. We've got them somewhere in the vault. Just, I haven't
5717880	5722360	cared enough, but this last one, you know, was definitely enough to make me wanna sit
5722360	5726720	down and watch it and actually show some interest in playing it. And Questbuster kinda agrees
5726720	5730480	there, saying the new God of War is rock solid and they added in a few things with patches.
5730480	5734480	Alright, well, we're gonna go to our, uh, a little break here in studio. Um, I'm very
5734480	5739560	happy because tonight we have a listener community submission for our break tonight. So, Darktetsuya,
5739560	5745080	uh, often kinda gets associated with this game series, La Mulana. Yes. And so, we kinda,
5745080	5749120	like, tongue in cheek make fun of him, but in a positive way for his love of La Mulana.
5749120	5754040	But what I love that Darktetsuya has done is he's fucking owning it. And so, in a discussion,
5754040	5757800	he's gonna talk about this a little bit in the video, but because La Mulana 2, uh, they're
5757800	5761800	talking about this for consoles and so forth, he decided, you know what, let's, let's, let's
5761800	5767040	show people this game that I always, uh, still have to play it. I think I have it in my library.
5767040	5771040	So this is about seven minutes and I'm just saying that because the audio, I think I fixed
5771080	5775160	the audio and I think it'll come through okay. Um, but you know, there is a lot of, um, like,
5775160	5780040	visuals to this. So I, I was like, do I leave it in the podcast? Do I not? So I think ultimately
5780040	5783320	I'm gonna leave it in just so you guys can hear from Darktetsuya and why he likes La,
5783320	5788040	La Mulana so much. But if you find that you're not really, like, not being able to see it is
5788040	5791480	kind of bothering you, then I am telling you it's about seven minutes long if you want to go ahead
5791480	5795960	and fast forward. But, uh, for those of you that are, uh, watching live, uh, here you go. We're
5796000	5802120	gonna go to a break segment here where Darktetsuya is going to talk about his love of La Mulana.
5802840	5808280	Okay. Hello everybody. It's, uh, Darktetsuya here. So I thought I would try and do a, uh,
5808280	5814520	break video for, uh, friends over at OLR. And what better game to do it on than one that was
5814520	5822440	just recently announced. So this last week was PAX, right? And they announced that the American
5822440	5826200	version of La Mulana 2 coming to console is actually going to include the original. So
5827800	5831080	thought I might show you a little bit of the beginning of the game here, show you what you're
5831080	5840040	in for. Probably hear my name come up every time this game comes up, so.
5843160	5846600	Yeah, I know a thing or two about this one. So yeah, start off. You come in here,
5847080	5854440	see how far I can get in maybe, maybe 10 minutes, maybe a little less. So yeah, this elder's all
5854440	5863400	pud. Let's see. So he'll explain to you what's, what's going on. You have to enter the ruins,
5863400	5864920	ruins of La Mulana, find your dad.
5864920	5872120	Okay, so let's see. Yep. Take your laptop, get an upgrade. All right.
5874120	5878120	And yeah, he'll send you, uh, emails during the game to give you hints and whatnot.
5878120	5886040	Okay, so let's see. Next stop. Oh, where is it? Actually, no. I, oh, well, there it is. Yeah.
5886040	5889800	By this item, it's a hand scanner. It was inspired by a real, uh,
5889800	5895800	peripheral they made for the, uh, MSX system. Yeah. The original version of that came out,
5895800	5903880	what was it, 2005. It was a freeware indie game. Oh, there's something I need to get first. Yeah.
5903880	5909400	It's a freeware indie game. The developers loved all the games to the old MSX computer system.
5911240	5914600	So they took a lot of the inspiration from some of those games that they played,
5914600	5918120	created this, uh, freeware game. Let's see.
5920120	5923240	Now I'm, now I'm forgetting where I need to, oh, wait, I know where I need to go.
5924760	5932120	Two minutes. Well, should be, oh, why did I do that? Anyway. Yeah. So that was originally released
5932760	5943240	for freeware on PC in about 2005, I believe, 2005, 2006. And, uh, yeah, it was a freeware indie game.
5943880	5951480	And, uh, Aeon Genesis was a translation group. They, uh, translated the game into English.
5953720	5957640	And then guy by the name of Deceased Crab made it famous on YouTube. And
5958200	5959880	that's kind of where I discovered it.
5963000	5969800	So anyway, yeah. Come up here. Got these birds. Okay. Yeah. Hold that. Push down to use weights
5969800	5975960	on these pedestals. You know, just like in Indiana Jones. Kill the snake here and shell horn.
5976600	5981320	Maybe you trigger a trap or solve a puzzle, you'll hear noise. It's different for each, but
5983880	5990840	yeah. So very useful item if you're first playing the game. If you're speed running it,
5990840	5996200	you probably won't need it, but I'm not at that level yet. Let's see if I can,
5997160	6004120	ah, come on. I just, I'll just drop down then. I kill this guy. Oh, I don't have any weights.
6004120	6011160	Really? Well, I have to come here. Is there a weight in here? Nope.
6012840	6015720	I didn't want to have to detour to buy.
6018280	6023400	Nope. Dang it. Well, that's gonna, nope.
6027000	6033400	Anyway. Yeah. I'll try not to make this too long, but yeah. It's,
6034280	6038520	all right. So what do we got? We'll go in the shop here. Yeah, there we go. Okay.
6039240	6047720	That should do us for now. It's funny, yeah. I, watching his videos of the game, it looked like
6047720	6054680	fun. Okay, actually the videos that we're watching is the, uh, I started with the, uh, the bonus
6054680	6063000	dungeon, uh, Hell Temple. I would not recommend going in there. It is not fun. Anyway, yeah.
6063720	6064760	See, end of the ruins here.
6067160	6073160	Oh, wait a minute. I have to equip that. Yeah, that's just Cellpud telling you something.
6074120	6082440	Say, I read this. They lurk within this land over deals. So yeah. Then this. Okay.
6084680	6104520	So I really didn't want to talk over that part. That intro is just amazing. You step into the
6104520	6110920	temple for the first time, and you hear that, like, the adventure begins here. So yeah. Now,
6110920	6112600	this item you need to get to get a...
6116200	6122600	Anyway, yeah. Let's see. See, yeah. See, yeah. That's solving a puzzle. Step on that tomb.
6122600	6126280	Step on that tile there. Sacred Orb. Sacred Orb gives you some extra life.
6128120	6135720	Anyway, yeah. So come down here. Yeah. Let's see. All right.
6135720	6142360	So yeah. You know, you got enemies to kill, bosses to fight, these little skeleton guys.
6142360	6145480	Oh yeah. There's an item you need to buy to get, to be able to read those,
6146920	6149000	but that's up on the surface. Let's see.
6151880	6157480	Um, why don't I end the video with this? Let's see. Do I have a way? Okay, yeah.
6158200	6159960	Sometimes there's traps, like this one.
6159960	6171000	Yep. Uh, anything else I have to say about the game? I mean, not really.
6173000	6175640	I mean, it's... I think it's a lot of fun. I...
6177640	6181640	Definitely pretty hard, though. I would absolutely recommend a walkthrough.
6181640	6190440	Either a video walkthrough or game facts or, uh, what is that? Or there's a wiki, you know?
6192600	6196040	But yeah, this is coming out early 2020 for consoles.
6197400	6200360	There is also the sequel that's going to be included.
6202200	6207160	Apparently a lot of the, uh, they made some tweaks to the, uh, hint system to help you get,
6208120	6212680	to help you get, figure out where you need to go. And a lot of that is going to be retrofitted into
6212680	6218360	the first game, so I thought that was neat. There's a, uh, there was a panel at PAX that
6218360	6222200	they recorded that I definitely recommend looking up, so...
6225960	6231560	Yeah, you know, exploring the ruins, solving puzzles, and trying to avoid traps, it's...
6232520	6233320	I enjoyed it!
6233800	6234600	Anyway.
6237560	6240440	Anything else I have to say on this? I mean, not really.
6242200	6248920	Anyway, yeah. I guess that was a brief look at, uh, La Mulana coming soon to consoles early 2020.
6252040	6254360	So, maybe I'll do a video on this.
6256120	6260520	All right, there it is. Thank you, Dr. Tuye, for that submission there for, uh, La Mulana.
6260680	6263480	For that submission there for, uh, La Mulana.
6263480	6266920	Uh, appreciate that. Uh, and some folks, some folks in chat, very nice,
6266920	6272600	give me some helpful advice there, uh, about, uh, you know, uh, talking while playing video games.
6272600	6277560	It's hard. It's a hard thing to do, but yeah, when we do those, and that's why I don't always make the
6277560	6282360	break videos myself because, um, you know, trying to narrate the video game I'm playing can sometimes
6282360	6286920	be a pain in the butt. And Bobby's, Bobby's needling me on the whole, uh, the DragonCon
6286920	6289640	thing we did where we were trying to play Overwatch. It was just, it was just too much,
6289640	6293400	like, going on at once. We had to, like, dial it back. I need to teach you the power of voiceover,
6293400	6299800	Rob. Well, girl, I know how to talk, you know, but. Yeah, but you can record the footage.
6300680	6305320	Which is a great suggestion that came up in chat is that you can also record the footage
6305320	6311080	first and then. That's how I'm going to be doing my sim stuff. Yeah, yeah. So, um, but I super
6311080	6316200	appreciate, uh, that Dr. Tuye sent that in and I welcome anybody in our community that has a game
6316200	6320840	that they love like that, that they want to share with the show. Uh, please feel free to send in
6320840	6327080	your submission, but do, do file that in the back of your mind that it is a podcast as well. And so
6327080	6331800	you have to kind of think of both and it's not an easy thing to do. Trust me, you know, that's,
6331800	6336680	that's, and that's one reason why here at OLR, I feel like we've been challenged with,
6336680	6340680	we've got the radio, we've got the talking part down because this is what we've been doing for
6340680	6345800	17 years. It's the visual part of the show that we've been like, I know this is not the
6345800	6349800	most nice looking studio in the world and everything. That's the part where we're
6349800	6354440	challenged is making it more visually compelling, visually challenged without having to spend my
6354440	6358440	entire Sunday doing B-roll before the show, but you know, little bits here and there go a long
6358440	6362920	way. So anyway, we're all working to improve. Anyway. Uh, let's move on though. Cause we,
6362920	6365960	you know, we have been actually speaking and talking, we've been doing it for a while.
6365960	6370120	We're coming up on eight o'clock here on the West coast. And I want to make sure we have some time
6370120	6374520	to get some calls if there are any calls tonight. So let's get into some rapid fire news as we
6374520	6379080	travel around the industry this week and see what else has been going on in gaming news.
6379080	6383720	So this is very cool. So this is a great game that came out on the Xbox 360 and PC and Wabaks.
6383720	6388920	So Castle Crashers is being remastered. It is coming now to PlayStation four and
6388920	6396920	Nintendo switch on September 17th. They are going to be improving the textures and bumping the, uh,
6397640	6403160	the FPS to 60 and, um, including all previously released DLC.
6404600	6409400	So that'll be something to look forward to and it looks awesome. I'll have to check it out.
6410280	6414680	If you want to play Castle Crashers yet again, but it is a really good game. I can't sound too
6414680	6419160	shady. Um, and then this is kind of cool. So I watched a little bit of a video about this,
6419640	6427960	called the floor is lava, the video game, which it's, it's great. So it's by the developers,
6427960	6434600	uh, who did don't starve. And it's, uh, it's kind of funny because they have this,
6434600	6443560	like almost like a parody GI Joe, um, you know, uh, type of cartoon thing that goes along with
6443560	6452280	it as well. So they, uh, like they call it the G A T and it was just, it was really kind of funny,
6452280	6455720	the, just the detail that they put into it. But yeah, it's, it's like what you would think it
6455720	6461720	would be. It's like a parkour type of game with the floor being lava. Do your kids play that at
6461720	6467480	home? The floor is lava. Um, they have probably played that in a Roblox. So I'm sure that they
6467480	6472040	played several Roblox games that are like that, but this is also something that's also coming to
6472040	6477720	Apple arcade as well. But, um, it is coming out on PC as well. You can book, you know, um,
6478600	6482120	favorite it on steam or whatever. So look for, yeah, hot lava.
6483080	6487560	Uh, jumping back to the castle crashers, one, a great tip in our chat from DJ Rama S who says,
6487560	6493560	FYI, if you already have castle crashers on Xbox 360, you can get the remastered version for $4.99.
6493560	6497480	You buy it under the same gamer tag as the original game. Well, I love that little,
6497480	6500840	little incentive for having bought the game before. Um, and I should have mentioned,
6500840	6506040	I didn't mention already, uh, games coming out in September 19. So very soon the lava game,
6506040	6510760	yeah, hot lava. So, uh, check it out. Okay. Well, let's move on to another game,
6510760	6514760	uh, coming soon that I don't know. I felt like it had some mixed reaction when we first talked
6514760	6521560	about it, but, uh, Contra rogue core is a game that's, I think they showed off some more footage
6521560	6526840	during Tokyo game show. They didn't just do footage. There's actually a demo that came out,
6526840	6532840	uh, a demo for Contra rogue core is available. Is it core or corpse? I think core. That's what
6532840	6536840	I thought core because corpse sounds like everybody's already dead. That's what I thought.
6537800	6542360	Well, Hey, it's, it's a pronunciation thing I got right for a change. So let's celebrate that.
6542360	6546840	All right. Anyway, so Contra rogue core, uh, a demo came out on PlayStation four,
6546840	6552840	Xbox one and Nintendo switch on all the different digital stores. Uh, and you get to dive into the
6552840	6557960	damn city. That's actually what it's called. It's damned city. So you get to dive into the damn
6557960	6563000	city and actually play a little bit of the game. Uh, he, the demo is part of the single player
6563000	6568200	campaign of the twins, twin stick, third person shooter, a playable preview of one of the many
6568200	6573160	large scale bosses in the game. Now I did not get a chance to check out the demo myself,
6573160	6577800	but I thought that some of you or some of you guys, uh, had, because I know dark Tetsuya,
6578440	6581480	I almost wish you'd done a video for that. I guess I should, I shouldn't say it because
6581480	6585560	the Llamulana thing was great. And to be fair to dark to see it, he actually did the Llamulana
6585560	6590760	thing last week. We didn't do it last week. Cause you had your footage from the, uh, the
6590760	6595560	indie event that you went to. So we had to push it back a week, but, uh, I would like to see the demo
6595560	6600520	if I don't get my hands on it myself this week. Um, dark to see it says in chat, I played the
6600520	6605720	Contra demo and I actually really enjoyed it. And orange right also confirms its core because the
6605720	6611960	Genesis game was hardcore. And that was, you know, it's a kind of play on words there with
6611960	6615720	that when you do it that way. So anyway, I'm pretty cool that they actually released a demo.
6615720	6623560	I feel like we never talk about video game demos anymore in this day and age. So, um, yeah, I, um,
6623560	6627400	I don't have a lot of us to say with that. Uh, Hey, I got a pinch hit here live. Loki,
6627400	6632600	can you do my second story? Cause the website will not work on this, uh, beast over here.
6632600	6636680	Oh, it's it doesn't like the windows XP, I guess. I guess it's, it's more the,
6636680	6640040	I think it's cause I'm using Chrome over here. I don't know. But anyway, it's just move on.
6641160	6646040	So I think this is a really, I want to talk about this. Yeah. So super Nintendo world,
6646040	6651000	of course is the theme park. That's supposed to be coming soon to universal parks and we've
6651000	6657400	got some more details on when that might be happening. So, uh, they wanted it by 2020 for
6657400	6661960	the Tokyo, at least the Tokyo version for the Olympics. Right. So the first version,
6661960	6668280	I think is supposed to be coming to Japan, but I don't believe that it's going to make 2020.
6668280	6674760	Uh, bummer. Yeah. So I thought I saw like, was it 20, 22, but, um, well, the cut,
6674760	6678040	the parts I thought were cool is that they were talking about like a wristband that was supposed
6678040	6682040	to interact with the switch as well. Like there was actually going to be like interaction between,
6682040	6686280	Oh good. More crap. I get the buy, but yeah, I think it's neat though. So yeah,
6686280	6689000	they're talking a little bit about how they're going to, you know, of course they have a super
6689000	6694520	Mario cart ride and Yoshi's adventure ride are two of the first rides that they're going to have
6694520	6700680	there in phase one. Um, Oh, they could do it in phases like star Wars land. It says, yeah,
6700680	6705640	you're gonna have this wristband. That's got a big red Mario symbol on it. And it says, by the way,
6705640	6711240	the wristband is super cool. It's magnetic. You slap it on your wrist and it just snaps on there.
6711240	6719000	Yeah. Flat bracelet. Yes. Snap bracelet and allows you to, um, uh, on it, see a Tiberian
6719000	6727640	chat says, yeah, excuse me. Yay. Crap. It allows you to, uh, interact with, um, stuff all over the
6727640	6733080	different lands. So they said they have three different levels. The first day of, um, Bowser's
6733080	6738360	deal and Prince's peaches castle. Um, they have different key elements. You actually get to walk
6738360	6741720	through Prince's peaches castle. Like it's sleeping beauty's castle Disneyland. That's so
6741720	6747080	cool. Uh, maybe, but yeah, apparently you'll be able to go up and keep score with various games.
6747800	6751720	Um, so that's kind of cool. You know what it kind of sounds like a little bit is like, um,
6751720	6756760	toy story, uh, the, the midway mania and Disneyland. And I remember the midway mania
6756760	6761160	had an app like, it wasn't there like an iPhone midway mania game. I swear that was a thing.
6761160	6765240	And like, if you actually play and here's the, you could turn the GPS on because if you actually
6765240	6771080	play toy story, midway mania wall in line for toy story based on your GPS, you unlocked like
6771080	6776840	a special thing in the game. So I like it when the games kind of do things like that. Cause you know
6776840	6781640	what you get. If you play Harry positor, if you play Harry Potter, wizards unite at universal
6781640	6787400	studios, Harry Potter world, you know what you get? What? Nothing. So I like it when games kind
6787400	6791160	of do stuff like that. So I think this will charge you additional money to get a Harry
6791160	6797560	Potter badge or something like that. Fuck all the way off. To be honest. Uh, let's see.
6797560	6801400	Kaishido says I want a Mario fencing game. Throwing it back to the kickoff topic tonight.
6801400	6805960	Well, if you want a Mario fencing game, I believe wouldn't that be in the 2020 Olympics game?
6805960	6810920	True. That true. That, uh, as 200, Matt says, parks are really all about the immersive experience.
6810920	6815400	Harry Potter world led the charge and I will give universal credit for that as much as, you know,
6815400	6820760	we've stand Disney parks on this show. Universal gets some credit. Like the one stuff that they
6820760	6825320	have there. Oh yeah. Universal's got some kick ass stuff, like especially the newer stuff.
6825320	6830040	Some of the dated stuff really shows at Sage. I actually, I heard they finally changed the
6830040	6834200	Jurassic park ride because now it's Jurassic world. So they went through and completely
6834200	6838760	redid that ride. And I think that'd be fun to go see. But anyway, I I'm excited to see universal's
6838760	6842840	technology. Cause that, that Harry Potter ride, if you haven't been on that Harry Potter ride,
6842840	6847320	it's, it's pretty fucking great. Like it's, it's pretty astounding. I really,
6847320	6850680	really liked that ride. And that whole, that whole part of the park is very immersive.
6850680	6855320	It's really cool. So I'm excited to see what they do in Nintendo magic. Yeah. All right. Anyway,
6855320	6859880	let's move on a dark soccer. You have some rapid fire news too. A couple of quickies. Um,
6859880	6866760	cave has finally updated, uh, their shmups. Um, cause they took them off, um, iOS before
6866760	6873480	because they were 32 bit and 32 bit went away with iOS 11. So they now have brought them back as 64
6873480	6880920	bit. Um, listed among those, as I see Dodonpach maximum, um, I've got death smiles. I'm hoping
6880920	6885640	that they include mushihime sama with that. Cause I really enjoyed playing that. So we'll see what
6885640	6893000	else comes out and then, um, monster rancher, um, it's going to be on switch of course, but it's
6893000	6899880	going to play like PS one and look the same. So it is legit. PS one monster rancher, maybe a little
6899880	6907320	cleaner, but it's the same thing or monster farm as it was in Japan. And it will be out later this
6907320	6914360	year as a Delo title. Uh, in chat, interesting name, obsolete woman in chat says I love cave
6914360	6922280	shmups so much. Who doesn't honestly, cave shmups are great. They are hair pulling, you know, and
6922280	6926600	not in a good way, more like the, you know, trichotillomania type of way. But it's also
6926680	6931560	very nice that with a mobile phone, it's very easy to tilt it vertically. Right. And get your
6931560	6935720	vertical shmup the way it's supposed to be done, which more Nintendo switch products need to do.
6935720	6941240	I know a couple of them. I remember playing like some of the, this was like way back, like on the
6941240	6946440	iPod touch, like way long time ago, they had like some of the cave shmups in there and the controls
6946440	6949640	are pretty good because you can just put your finger anywhere on the actual thing and it auto
6949640	6953880	fired for you. That's true. Some games work better than other. Yeah. You just, that's all you just
6953960	6958040	fire consistently. Like w when do you not fire? You fire consistently and you can,
6958040	6962360	you have pretty good precision over like the movement stuff. So it worked out really well.
6963160	6971800	That'd be fun. Agreed. Um, that was it. Oh, did you do the monster answer? I did. Oh, I just,
6972920	6976520	I'm sorry. Cause I went back and talked about the shmups. Sorry. My bad. It's gonna be weird
6976520	6980440	though, how that's going to work though. Cause I can't imagine since this switch doesn't have,
6981240	6988440	um, the ability to load discs in, how does it work? Because monster rancher for those who don't
6988440	6997080	mean they have an online catalog of virtual CDs that you can choose from. That's not the same.
6997080	7002520	It isn't the same, but they got to do something. They should let you hook it up to like Spotify
7002520	7006120	or something. Like I know Nintendo doesn't have Spotify, YouTube. Oh my God. Nintendo
7006120	7010840	does have YouTube. So imagine if you could hook it up to YouTube and do it that way.
7010840	7016200	Or like they should have just, you know, QR codes or something like that. You know, have,
7016200	7021240	have random QR codes or the barcode scanners. You may, besides you've got that stupid phone app that
7021240	7026680	you don't use for anything. So platoon, you know, it's true. All right. Let's travel around the
7026680	7030600	world and check out some games that are coming out a little sooner as we do some world release
7030600	7037880	states. Loki. Yes. So we have AI, the Somnium files that's on PC, Nintendo switch and PlayStation
7037880	7044920	four Lego, Jurassic world on Nintendo switch real fishing road trip adventure on Nintendo switch and
7044920	7051240	PlayStation four, the legend of Zelda links awakening on Nintendo switch, the best game
7051240	7058600	of the week, honestly, untitled goose game on Nintendo switch and PC. Um, and then Bobby's
7058600	7062520	favorite game, Nino Cooney, wrath of the white witch coming out and into the switch. And if
7062520	7067960	that's not enough, Nino Cooney wrath of the white witch remastered on PC and PlayStation four. And
7067960	7080120	that's it. Rob is full of cookie. All right. So, uh, girl. Um, so on the 16th, we have bus,
7080120	7086520	this is in the UK. We have bus simulator on the 18th. We have modern warfare, beta truck driver,
7087320	7094520	on the 19th song, bird symphony AI, the Somnium files, Agalas, which actually was kind of cute.
7094520	7100680	It looks very, um, I don't know, like a giant blast voice on the screenshot. Um, Lego, Jurassic
7100680	7108120	world, Nintendo switch light Nino Cooney wrath of the white witch on a switch and PlayStation, um,
7108120	7114200	legend of Zelda links awakening. Um, by the way, thank you, Deke man for getting me cups from
7114280	7119240	seven 11 in Canada. Oh shit. He pulled through for you on that. That's awesome. Tempest fucking
7119240	7127800	4,000. Is this really finally on PlayStation and X-Box sweet Tetris 99. You know, I've actually
7127800	7134120	played, um, tempest 3000. Yeah, I have to mom, but they only had them like as a limited thing.
7134120	7138840	And I played the Atari party. Tempest 3000 was actually like a beta thing for a long time. I
7138840	7142920	played at Atari party. I did. I did too. And I think that's it for the week after look at the
7142920	7149240	calendar. When did already happen? It did. Tempest 4,000 happened on PC. Yeah. Because we're
7149240	7153480	getting it at home. Okay. Got it. That's the, I'm like, wait a minute. I swear I played to this 4,000
7153480	7158440	it's on PC. That's it for the week. Okay, cool. Um, moving on to Japan. Very it's, it's one of
7158440	7162440	those weeks where we have very similar releases around the world, which I know, but, but like,
7162440	7166040	usually it's kind of different what each country is getting, but not this week because here we go
7166040	7171000	again, AI, the Somnium files, uh, is also out in Japan this week. So you have that to look forward
7171000	7176680	to on the playlist station for card fight. Vanguard EX is also a release in Japan this week
7176680	7182680	and, uh, Bobby Black Wolf, not approved Nino Cooney wrath of the white, rich, which remastered
7182680	7187800	also coming out on PlayStation four. Um, you know, if they charged less for it, I might
7187800	7192040	pick it up again on PS4. I would be down with trying to play that game again. Um,
7192840	7198200	and I would live stream it, but I would have to somehow restrict Bobby Black Wolf's comments.
7199160	7209000	He's allowed to talk just not every positive reacts only heart emojis only. All right. Anyway,
7209640	7213960	I'm just, I'm just giving him a hard time. Uh, let's see. Also, uh, coming out in Japan,
7213960	7217400	let's see, as we move to the Nintendo switch, I think we get a lot of the same stuff as well.
7217400	7224920	Yeah. Card fight Vanguard EX AI, the Somnium files and, um, Jaku no Lila trap of musk.
7225800	7232520	It's a game that comes out as well in Japan on the switch. Oh my, I'm looking at the cover art
7233080	7237720	and, uh, I see this woman dressed in what looks like a bridal outfit type of thing.
7237720	7243400	And then I see like a dude with his shirt open and she's definitely going for some of that musk
7243400	7251000	right now. So, um, I guess, I guess that's that on the Nintendo switch are these two people for
7251640	7257240	it? Katie, it looked like vampires. It's vampire stuff. Oh God. It's one of those.
7257240	7262120	And there, what is it? This is a porny game. There's like, I'm sorry, I can't put this.
7262120	7267480	It's a visual novel. That's is, is this, or is this not a threesome? That is what I'm looking
7267480	7273800	at right now. They're just cuddling Peter, Paul and Mary. It doesn't, that could one, two, three,
7273800	7279160	is it gross? Me and me. What is it gross? No, they're just all very androgynous on,
7279160	7283960	but these two were kissing and the other ones like, you can't see their hand and I have no
7283960	7290920	idea the pronouns for any of these people, but who cares? They're vampires. That's right.
7290920	7295720	There's definitely some heavy petting in this game. Good Lord. All right. Let them pet
7296440	7301160	trap of musk among other things. All right. So there's that. And then of course,
7301160	7307400	legend is all the links awakening, but who cares? Trap of musk. All right, let's move on.
7307400	7315400	I'm waiting for somebody in chat to be like, it's an anime. SSJ100 Matt says near my salad.
7315400	7320280	You're so close. You're so close. It's it's really in front of my salad.
7321880	7328440	All right. All right. DJ Rama S says you can stream that on anime jam session. We support that.
7328440	7333240	What is, he's going crazy. He misses daddy. That's what's going on. He's, he has been,
7334040	7338120	Mr. Smoosh has been fed. So while the B roll was going for classic game of the week,
7338120	7342600	I was letting him out of kitty jail and feeding him. So, you know, we take care of Mr. Smoosh
7342600	7346760	when you can't see me getting up from my chair, but, um, all right. Anyway,
7347800	7351880	he's being very needy. Anyway, this is the part of the show where we would go to the mail bag,
7351880	7356920	but, um, dark sock. What we do have one. Okay. Dark soccer is coming back so she can read the
7356920	7363000	mail. Do you want me to have Loki do a story or okay. I was ready for this shit. All right.
7363640	7368680	Did he go right back in kitty jail? No, he let me carry him to kitty jail. Wow. And he,
7368680	7374200	I even played with his foot and he started to purr. Oh, good. So apparently he likes the feets.
7374760	7378440	He just misses dad because dad would usually be home around eight o'clock.
7378440	7383560	So, and he's just not right now. So, all right. Anyway, uh, dark soccer, mailbag,
7383560	7388360	a very short email from Robert M. My head Canon for animal crossing is that the characters,
7388360	7393320	including yours are living plush toys. Also has anything been said or theorized about
7393320	7397240	pocket camp connection? First of all, pocket camp is not going to have a connection.
7397240	7403240	They have said so. Oh, bummer. Well, I believe that's what they said. Everything I've indicated
7403240	7408280	I've seen indicates that it's not going to have connection. I think I've seen that too.
7409080	7415160	And then the other thing, um, I still believe in the hot to full boyfriend theory where, um,
7415160	7423640	humans are, uh, are, uh, a dying breed. And actually we got another email from Y Y R
7424520	7427560	while I was reading the other mail. Wow. Talk about timing.
7427560	7431160	Well, maybe it got went out before then. I just didn't refresh. But anyway,
7431160	7437560	um, this doesn't, yeah. Anyway, hello. This email has been sent to acknowledge the dream game
7437560	7443000	submission from last week's episode. Number seven 91, Sunday, September 8th. Your submission has

7454520	7461480	You remember what you said, right? It was vectors. Yeah. Thank you for using the Y Y R games,
7461480	7467320	dream game submission service regards Aaron. Y Y R dude. I'll just be happy if it's turds, but plays
7467320	7475400	like, um, like, uh, I just said the damn game a moment ago at tempest. He needs to say it like
7475400	7479560	the Skype lady. When you call echo one, two, three, thank you for using the dream game
7479560	7485160	submission service after the tone. Please leave your game. Thank you for using the Y Y R games,
7485160	7491240	dream game submission service. How was that? In case of an emergency landing, there's two exits
7491240	7497720	above the lava toy, two exits above the wings. I think my accent was pretty okay. No, your
7497720	7504280	accent was good. Yeah. All right. Act F has a theory at animal crossing saying animal crossing
7504280	7509320	is probably a kid-friendly version of Dr. Moreau's Island or whatever it's called. The Island of Dr.
7509320	7514120	Island of Dr. Moreau, uh, which I think was a classic movie that was pretty well regarded.
7514120	7518520	And then they remade it in the nineties. It was like one of Marlon Brando's last movies and
7519480	7526200	girl, that movie was a mess. Didn't it go into like, they played off of that theme with like
7526200	7534040	the nutty professor. Maybe I can't help but think of the Island of Dr. Brain by Sierra,
7534040	7540040	which was superior in every way. Mr. Magoo did some of that too. Does anyone remember Mr. Magoo?
7540680	7546360	Oh, Rob don't die. Yes, I remember it. I remember Mr. Magoo and I remember Captain Kangaroo.
7547160	7553560	Tired Island of Dr. Moreau wired Island of Dr. Brain. Okay. Just say it.
7555480	7560520	I need to find that. Can you, can you play that on some service? Maybe it's in the art on it.
7560520	7564680	I think it's on the web archive, isn't it? The Dr. Brain thing. I want to play that on a live
7564680	7570280	stream some night. I think that'd be fun. All right. I'm looking it up right now. The Island
7570280	7575800	of Dr. Brain. Bobby Black Wolf says I have it on my DOS machine, Dr. Brain. Bobby stream it.
7575960	7580600	Only available in DOS. But you can, can you still buy it?
7581720	7586520	Not that Moby games has a link to it. I think so. I'm going to look it up later after the show.
7586520	7591000	All right. Uh, let's move on though. We got to, uh, we're running a little long, so I can't find
7591000	7594920	it. Is this, it's as equal to a game though. The castle of Dr. Brain. They had, they had several
7594920	7602920	Dr. Brain games. They were all fairly similar. There was yeah. Island castle return. I think
7602920	7608440	there was a third game. I'm looking so, um, Oh God, there was a bunch. Uh, there was Dr.
7608440	7614840	Brain action reaction in 99, uh, thinking games, IQ adventure, puzzle madness. Then there was the
7614840	7619720	time warp of Dr. Brain, lost mind of Dr. Brain, the Island of Dr. Brain and castle of Dr. Brain.
7619720	7624280	The time warp of Dr. Brain. The time warp of Captain Brain. To load this game,
7624280	7629160	please jump to the left and step to the right. Right. And then bring your knees in tight.
7629160	7635560	All right. Moving on Loki, please. Next story before we get too much more derailed.
7635560	7642200	All right. So this is unfortunate, but apparently the discord nitro games, those are going away
7642200	7645800	because apparently no one was playing them. I completely forgot. They even have that service.
7646680	7653080	I didn't forget about the nitro service, but I also remember when we were like, Oh my God,
7653080	7657880	discord stealth launched a game store onto everyone's PC. They're fucking brilliant and
7657880	7660760	all this stuff. And it was so stealth that everyone forgot it was there.
7663000	7669320	Apparently we made a miscalculation in all this praise for discord is that oops,
7669320	7677960	it was a little bit too stealth and I done forgot. Uh, but yes, apparently, um,
7677960	7684600	they said they will be removing all games from nitro. Um, apparently the service will be no
7684600	7688440	longer, uh, you will not be able to access the a hundred plus games that were included in the
7688440	7695560	service after October 15th. And just, they said they were removing, they're still selling nitro
7695560	7701320	cause they still want the, the emojis on every server and your price on your name. And you can
7701320	7706760	do the boost cause, um, we want to, and Bobby talked about this a little bit on his show. We
7706760	7712040	kind of wanted to boost the VOG network server, but you can't just directly do that. Like we
7712040	7717960	can't just throw 20 bucks at them and say, boost the certain, like we have to actually get so many
7717960	7723240	people to use their boost on the server. And that's silly. Yeah. That was a little weird.
7723240	7729400	So discord, if you're out there, let us give you money the old fashioned way. Rob, for the record,
7730360	7737960	I found, uh, the, uh, download for the island of dr brain and you can get, uh, the DAS emulators.
7738520	7743320	Nice. Except the legal ease of that. Is that legal? Play in your browser.
7743880	7748440	Okay. So that's what I thought. Web archive, I think had it at some point. Okay. I'm on my
7748440	7754200	abandonware.com. Well, that's, that is a gray area as we know. And I just have to be careful
7754200	7759480	what I stream on Twitch. Uh, but I, if it's still on web archive, then I think that's fair game
7759480	7766520	because then you're just, I'm playing games at a library. All right. Anyhow, uh, let's move on.
7766680	7772120	Actually quickly, um, uh, chat comments here. Tiger claw says discord nitro doesn't seem worth
7772120	7776760	it because one of the features is being able to post animated emojis and stuff. Uh, Bobby says
7776760	7781720	the feature we want for our server is the update up bit rate in the chat channels. Yes, that is true
7781720	7787320	to make the voice quality even better and more pristine on these programs. Or, uh, for instance,
7787320	7793320	when extra fur and I are doing a show and using discord to do it, he'll sound even better, um,
7793400	7798040	with if we were to have it up server, but that is a, uh, that is a conversation for another day.
7798040	7801720	Yeah. Bobby says we want to pay for that as a company and not make you guys subscribe to
7801720	7806360	discord to get it. Exactly. You guys are already paying with your subs and your biddies. We could
7806360	7811720	just take some of that money and give it to discord, but they won't let us. So, all right.
7812600	7817000	Anyhow. I mean, I guess we could subscribe as individuals, but you need what you need,
7817000	7821880	like two people to boost it, to get to the first level, but then you need like 20 to get to the
7821880	7826920	next. I don't know. It's a little weird. Anyway, let's move on though. Um, let's talk about,
7826920	7832520	Ooh, let's talk about civilization six. You know, I will take any excuse to talk about civilization
7832520	7838600	on this show, but I'm really curious for, um, Bobby's opinion on this because Bobby and I at
7838600	7845400	dragon con did a battle royale one Oh one panel. And, uh, we were talking about what games would
7845400	7850120	you like to see go the battle royale route. And we had a lot of games come up, but you know what
7850120	7857480	game I don't think ever came up civilization, but guess what? For fire access, who of course
7857480	7861720	is the company behind all the Civ games and two K who publishes them, uh, is taking their own
7861720	7867400	approach on a battle royale mode, uh, for civilization six it's called red death. It's a
7867400	7873800	12 player competitive game. So it's not 99. It's 12. I guess that's as many as Civ can handle. Uh,
7873800	7877880	and it puts the battle royale on the strategy game, but what you're doing, you're not really,
7877880	7883560	okay. So, you know, Civ is one type of game, but in this you're in a post apocalyptic world.
7883560	7889880	And so it's like all military driven. So you're doing the military and strategic side of
7889880	7895720	civilization. You're not doing the whole like science trees and development trees and all the
7895720	7901400	other stuff, the other types of micromanaging in the game. It's not so much for X it's just X
7901400	7905320	it's more the military side of things. That's probably the best way I can explain it.
7905320	7910360	So you don't play the usual leaders. You play, um, a post apocalyptic type of thing,
7910360	7915800	and you're trying to get off the planet by wiping everyone else out. Clearly it's the only way
7915800	7920440	everyone in the game starts with one civilian, one infantry unit and one machine gun unit.
7920440	7925640	And you grow your faction to crush the other factions. There's no wonders of the world.
7925640	7930360	And this is interesting too. There is a storm that shrinks the safe space,
7930360	7934680	just like you would see now that part I'm like, okay, that definitely seems more like traditional
7934680	7938680	battle royale. Because otherwise, when I read about this, I'm like, this just sounds like a
7938680	7943800	fancy mod that isn't really battle royale. It's just a military only model. Oh, okay.
7943800	7948520	They're taking cues with the shrinking eye of the storm and things like that. Okay. All right. It
7948520	7953480	pushes people more towards the center. I got that. Here's the other part, as much as you might want
7953480	7957000	to say that doesn't really feel battle royale. Well, here's, here's something that might really
7957000	7963880	lessen the complaints. It's free as long as you own civ six. So, Hey, I'm all for enhancements
7963880	7969480	and new things. So, it is a new free mode for anybody that already owns the core civ six.
7969480	7973080	So, that's pretty cool. Because I have to admit, I bought civ six. I played it a little bit. And
7973080	7977480	then I got distracted with other games as tends to happen. So, I need a reason to go back and
7977480	7984760	visit civilization six. That's for sure. So, anyhow. So, I don't see any comments from Bobby
7984760	7988120	Blackwell on this. I was wondering if he was going to say something on this. But I do see some
7988120	7993080	comments from other people. Kaijuto says, as much as I love battle royale, this civ game sounds
7993080	7998600	awful. Well, I think you kind of have to be into civ to get it. But like, if you don't really play
7998600	8006360	civ, it doesn't sound action packed because civ is not. Act F says, imagine a 99 player battle
8006360	8014280	royale game of civ. It would take years to finish. Maybe, but I would bet in a 99 player, I actually
8014280	8019640	would be down for a 99 player version of the traditional civilization game because civilizations
8019640	8023720	are going to get squashed fast. I think you would have to take out the barbarians to make it work
8023720	8028360	and have a really big planet. But I think there could be something there. But then if you're in
8028360	8033720	one of the top 10 civs, you're going to be playing for a long time. So, as Jonah and Matt says, I'm all
8033720	8038760	for this. And here's the comment from Bobby saying, I need to see more of it. Well, there is a trailer
8038760	8043480	out there. They did put out a trailer on YouTube. So, you can see a little bit more of it out there.
8043480	8047160	Sorry, I didn't rip it in time for tonight's show. But I know a lot of you are tech savvy
8047160	8050840	and probably already opening up YouTube in another window to take a look. So, there you go.
8050840	8055640	All right, let's move on. A few more stories before we get to some phone calls and stuff via
8055640	8062040	Discord. So, let's go to Dar Sakura. You've been kind of hinting at this one too all night.
8062040	8067800	Yeah, I have it on my wishlist on Steam. It's coming out in a few days from what I understand.
8067800	8074600	Sorry, on September 24th. A game designed by PsyOp and it is called I Love You, Colonel Sanders,
8074600	8082840	a finger looking good data simulator. Yeah, it is KFC dating sim where you date a young hot Colonel
8082840	8090200	and he looks just like. Oh, you remember when those like versions were coming out like fan art
8090200	8096120	versions of different mascots were out like there's the cute Wendy's, the snarky cute Wendy's
8096120	8100360	and the Burger King looking a little kind of younger and they had the hot Colonel Sanders.
8101000	8106680	Well, hot Colonel Sanders is in the game. I liked Reba as Colonel Sanders for the record.
8107560	8110840	Reba, they had a commercial with Reba McEntire playing the Colonel. When?
8111720	8114760	Only about a year ago. It wasn't that long ago. It was a recent memory. Guess who doesn't watch TV?
8115720	8120200	But it was on Twitter. I'm a big Twitter, like of course. I have all that blocked.
8120200	8125160	Just saying. And we have YouTube Red at home. I have a block too, but when I go outside,
8125160	8129240	I have this mobile device that lets me see things. Yeah, but I also have ad block on my iPhone.
8130680	8134600	Seriously? For everything. I actually don't use the Twitter app. I use echo phone. Oh,
8134600	8139240	it's ad blood. This was something people were posting because it's, it's fucking Reba McEntire.
8139240	8143240	She's allowed to go around. The moment that I see an ad about something, I just ignore it.
8143240	8149560	Even if it's Reba? Even if it's Reba, because I'm not going to let my memory of her think of her as
8149560	8156040	a sellout. Reba can do whatever she wants. And then I have to go listen to Fancy. Dark soccer
8156040	8159480	is there. Here's your one chance, ad block. Don't let me down. Peter Parker says, yes,
8159480	8165560	it's coming out on the day of KFC's founding. Well, a little bit more about this is that
8167240	8173800	he is going to be a culinary student with you, that he's gone back to culinary school to become
8173800	8180680	the world's greatest fried chicken salesman. And so that becomes one of your challenges to help
8180680	8188440	him with that as well as you learn recipes and you have different, you know, other tasks to do
8188440	8194440	in the game. But you know, this isn't the first time that KFC delved into romance, right? You
8194440	8200760	know? Well, I can't say I've been following the Colonel's love life closely, but- In Mother's Day
8200760	8209160	2017, KFC did a romance novel called The Tender Wings of Desire with a hotness version of the
8209160	8215720	Colonel. Okay. I'm going to say it. I'm sorry. I can't. I'm going to say it. Can the Colonel be gay?
8215720	8226520	Boy, play as girl. No, I'm kidding. No, I don't see why not. I mean- No, in this game.
8226520	8229480	Yeah. I don't know. It doesn't say anything about it, but for people who don't know where
8229480	8235560	that reference came from, what was that game we played at E3 that was like the dating fucking
8235560	8243640	game? And we're like, can you play guys? Boy, play as girl. That's what the guy literally said.
8244200	8249800	No, I'm laughing my ass off because this actually fucking happened. It was Feel 3 or something like
8249800	8254120	that was the name of it. Yeah. And we were doing the demo at Dark Soccer literally as like, you
8254120	8260840	know, the way you phrase it. Like, can two men play? Can two men play? And that was, boy, play
8260840	8269960	as girl. Literally the response. And he turned red. This was also years ago. This was like the
8270440	8276120	three feel, I think. Three feel, that's it. This was like 2005, I'm sure the game was.
8276120	8281320	This was Kensha Hall, wasn't it? It was Kensha Hall. So that'll date our experience. It was a
8281320	8287240	long time ago. Society has progressed a long way since the days of three feel. For the record,
8287240	8296280	I think the game did come out because I found references to it. Yeah, there were some links
8296360	8299720	about it out there, but yeah, I think that it still exists.
8302440	8308600	Pixel Pacas in chat says, I actually had that question, Rob. Thank God some of you
8308600	8314360	are doing the investigative journalism when we are unable. In the game, they do not specify
8314360	8321720	who the protag is or if you can select a gender. So basically the protagonist is whoever you want
8321720	8328760	them to be. I like that. I like that. Leave it up to your imagination. And Tiger Claw in chat says,
8329400	8333560	so basically you're saying this game is finger lickin' good.
8336440	8340120	Apparently you can still get three feel. Hold on, everyone. I just want everyone to note
8340120	8348440	episode 792, September 15th, 2019 at approximately 8 29 PM on the West Coast. Tiger Claw said
8348440	8356120	something really, really fucking funny. A winner is you.
8359720	8367800	All right. And for the record, your is spelled Y O U apostrophe R E. I'm just saying.
8367800	8371560	Right. Anything else we need to say about the KFC dating sim?
8371560	8373640	Fuck no, but I'm going to stream the shit out of it.
8373640	8378600	You should. You should. And don't forget in December, I'm going to be doing a holiday
8378600	8382680	star for hot to full boyfriend. I'll be waiting with bated breath. All right. Moving on,
8382680	8392520	Loki. I'll buy myself a pizza if I do it. All right. So this is kind of, I guess,
8392520	8400200	unfortunate, but you may remember that Billy Mitchell of Donkey Kong high score fame had his
8400200	8404920	and hot sauce and hot sauce. Well, pretty much only hot sauce anymore because his
8404920	8412440	scores fake hair. I'm just saying his scores were invalidated a while ago.
8413320	8419960	So basically his scores were invalidated and, you know, his record was taken out of the Guinness
8419960	8426760	Book of World Records. And now, of course, because of that, he is threatening legal
8426760	8432600	recourse against Guinness World Records and Twin Galaxies if they don't, uh, retract their
8432600	8439560	defamatory statements against him and reinstate his high score world records within the next two
8439560	8448280	weeks. You know who I haven't heard about in the news the past couple months? Who? Billy
8448280	8453720	Mitchell. You know who I'm hearing about in the news all of a sudden? Billy Mitchell. Wow. Fancy
8453720	8460200	that. Funny how that works. Isn't that crazy? Yeah. Isn't life funny? Isn't fame something else?
8460840	8466520	It is funny. And, um, I just don't think they have a strong case to be honest. I mean,
8467160	8472760	based on some of the stuff I've seen where they're showing you the video footage or whatever from his
8472760	8478760	games, apparently versus what's out there and how they can't recreate this the way the screen is,
8478760	8486680	um, kind of drawing in. It's just, I don't know, like it's ridiculous. It's not surprising though.
8487320	8490600	If this goes to trial, does Bobby Black Wolf get called as a witness?
8492040	8495880	That's all. And is there going to be a Bobby Black Wolf subpoena that happens? That's what
8495880	8498440	I want to know. Is that, is that going to be a thing that happens? Will this be covered
8498440	8503800	by Variety? And could they quote him again in Variety? Tiger call says he's been streaming
8503800	8507480	on Twitch. Oh yeah. I heard Billy Mitchell got into Twitch streaming not that long ago.
8508440	8513800	So streaming maim. I get, I don't know. How many viewers does he get on the regular? Not that
8513800	8519960	that's important, but I'm just curious. Like how many people are watching him do his Donkey Kong
8519960	8524280	speed runs or whatever he's working on next? He gets a few hundreds as Bobby Black Wolf.
8524280	8532280	Interesting. Well, good for him, but I just, I'm curious to see where this goes. I don't think that
8532280	8536040	they're going to, well, obviously they're not going to reinstate his records. I can't wait
8536040	8539960	for there to be a settlement. So this can be in the news all over again in a few more months.
8539960	8544120	And we can talk about Billy Mitchell again. I don't think there's anything needs to be settled.
8544120	8553640	I don't think he has any evidence. So let him Sue. Uh, Bobby Black Wolf says he does the full
8553640	8557400	TG thing, twin galaxy things where he shows the motherboard. Like they require,
8557400	8561480	he follows all the rules. I think his thing is that they invalidated his Pac-Man record
8561480	8568200	that was done in 1982 and Mame wasn't invented until 1997. So it wasn't so much about the Donkey
8568200	8573960	Kong record as it was, Hey, when you threw that out, you threw out all this other stuff. When
8573960	8581480	I set this record before there was an emulator, basically. So, I mean, I get that, but,
8582760	8588760	but at the same time, uh, when Lance Armstrong got caught doping or whatever it was,
8588760	8591640	they didn't just take the metal in the year that he was doping. They took them all.
8592280	8596440	Yeah. So that is, that is the thing that happens in sports sometimes. So there's kind of two sides
8596440	8601880	of it, right? Yeah. So anyway. All right. Well, let's move on and I got one more story for you
8601880	8607720	guys. And this one's kind of an odd thing. And I think, I think, uh, you know, a lot of you guys,
8607720	8611800	uh, probably heard about this this week and it's kind of a sweet thing, but, uh, it has to do with
8611800	8616840	Masha hero, Sakurai, who of course is the great mind behind, uh, super smash brothers and the
8616840	8621320	ultimate super smash brothers that was recently released on the switch. Um, and of course there's
8621320	8626440	this great meme around the internet, uh, where there's a picture of Sakurai during one of the
8626440	8631720	Nintendo directs, but someone has captioned it. Don't ask me for anything ever again. And that
8631720	8635960	picture never fails to crack me up whenever there's a smash brothers announcement like
8635960	8641240	Terry Bogart or, uh, uh, five more DLC characters coming than somebody replies to that picture.
8641240	8645160	Don't ask me for anything ever again, but there's actually kind of like an
8645240	8651880	ah moment about this because, uh, Sakurai took home some awards at the Japan game awards 2019.
8651880	8656760	And he actually gave a speech and the translated version of the speech goes like this.
8657480	8662760	I'm sorry for bringing up this personal story at a time like this, but making smash brothers
8662760	8668680	on the switch was the last mission the late Satoru Iwata gave to me. I've put my all into the
8668680	8674280	game and with more DLC, I will continue to work hard. So that is really sweet. It's one of those
8674280	8679400	things where it's like, don't ask me for anything ever again, unless you're Satoru Iwata, right?
8679400	8684840	Then you get whatever you want. And I think that is a very, very, uh, very cool little note to end
8684840	8689960	on. And obviously everybody loves this new smash brothers game. It's doing very well and still don't
8689960	8695400	have it yet. Still, I'm kind of surprised. It's never going to go on sale. So I don't know which
8695400	8700600	I, well, I still remember to send my switch controller in to get fixed because the first
8700600	8705960	thing I did wrong was I put that the wrong switch controller is broken. So I still have to send that
8705960	8710120	in cause it's slightly broken, but not as bad as the other one. And then I had to eventually send
8710120	8716840	the other one in, but I just haven't, I remember to do that. Yep. Which by the way, GameStop dude,
8716840	8722280	your fucking controller is so goddamn broken that like, it's just the camera is just straight down
8722280	8729320	in like, you know, Breath of the Wild. Just fucking take advantage of that Nintendo service
8729320	8735400	to fix that shit or put a new fucking controller on your damn demo kiosk. Like shit. I'm going to
8735400	8739240	move on to open up our discord, uh, for anybody that wants to call in. And if you want to be on
8739240	8743240	the show tonight, just head on over to our discord and he can join the green room and we'll be taking
8743240	8747160	calls there, uh, here shortly. Um, but I do want to read some of these comments from chat while
8747160	8752200	we wait for folks to join, uh, cause it's a very kind words there for Sakurai. Um, actdeft in chat
8752200	8759000	says Sakurai is wholesome and we don't deserve him. SSG100 Matt says, let Sakurai sleep. Uh,
8759480	8764280	actdeft says Iwata was a mentor to Sakurai, almost a father figure. You know, you have to remember
8764280	8769560	Satoru Iwata kind of worked his way up too. I mean, he balloon fight. Hello. That was him.
8769560	8774920	And he worked on other games as well. And then DarkSakuraOLR in chat says Sakurai also has good
8774920	8780920	hair. True. He does. He does. He doesn't really just really good hair. He does. Yeah. Yeah. I
8780920	8786920	wish I had Sakurai's hair, but I don't genetics. They're a bitch. What? Very fashionable. True.
8786920	8791000	But you know what? I really like hats. Do you like my hat today? By the way, I don't know if
8791000	8794600	it's, I don't know if it's coming through on Twitch very well, but it's a, it's a rainbow
8794600	8801080	Pikachu hat. Uh, and I thought it was appropriate for community day today. Um, I'm almost embarrassed
8801080	8807320	to say I got it at Spencer gifts, believe it or not. They were having a deal on hats. It was like,
8807320	8812280	buy one, get one free. So I bought this hat and I bought one. I haven't worn on stream yet. Should
8812280	8820200	I say what it is? Do it. It's a Waluigi hat. So I'll wear that on a future stream. I do changing
8820200	8825480	the colors of it, but I have hair because I get bored. Yeah. I picked up a wild stallion shirt
8825480	8832520	this week. Wild stallions. I haven't gotten it yet. You knew this shirt. This is the same one
8832520	8837640	that Keanu Reeves had on this Sonic shirt that I'm wearing. You know where I got this shirt at a
8837640	8844440	store target. I believe it. Yeah, I know. It's like crazy. So yeah, you can get some, because
8844440	8848920	there's there, they're clearing out the pride stuff. I almost got one of those sequence shirts.
8848920	8852440	Oh really? I want to get two of them and make it into a dress. I was going to say,
8852440	8855880	I'm surprised you're not buying some of those things just to like get crafty and make your
8855880	8859640	own thing. I'm kind of thinking of it, but I'm not that good at the seamstress yet. So I don't know
8859640	8866360	how to sew around the sequence. Gotcha. It's a bummer that my good pal Aria snark lives so far
8866360	8871000	away. Cause that's the seamstress. I have friends that are costumers. That's good. One of my,
8871000	8875640	one of the other sisters is actually doing a quilt raffle. We're actually gonna be raffling
8875640	8881480	out another quilt going on this labeled any way you turn it. Love is love is love is love is love.
8881480	8887880	I love that. And it's all hearts, heart patches that were donated. I have a completely random
8887880	8890440	question. I swear we'll get to the phone calls and we'll go back to video games. This is just
8890440	8893480	something I was stewing on. And maybe since you're involved with sisters, you might know the answer
8893480	8899240	to this. So, you know, we, we talk about like acronyms in LGBT, right? You know, there's LGBT,
8899240	8904840	there's LGBTQ plus. Some people call it queer, but not everybody's cool with that. Cause there's
8904840	8909400	a negative connotation of that word. Some people do the G first. Right. Yeah. Well, yeah, I've
8909400	8915960	seen GLBT. Sure. Um, but here's my question. Why did the acronym quilt bag never catch on?
8915960	8919960	Because it's all the same letters. You're the only person I've ever heard say it. Really? Yeah.
8919960	8924840	I swear I've heard it somewhere else too. And I always love that because I love that
8924840	8929800	image of a quilt that it's like all these different. I don't know. I will switch
8929800	8935560	personally between using queer and LGBTQ a plus. I understand some people are really hesitant to
8935560	8941480	use queer though, because, you know, I, and when I was in grade school, kids would play that game
8941480	8946040	called smear the queer. Right. And so it has a lot of negative. And I think some people are still
8946040	8950840	trying to kind of like figure that word out a little bit. Like it's still very negative for
8950840	8956200	some people. My whole thing is that the words have the power that we give them. I mean,
8956200	8964680	what bugs me is that there are words used for women and women's parts that are used very
8964680	8970600	negatively. I am very much against the word fish used in the drag community because the origin of
8970600	8974920	fish comes from an insult for the way that a woman's privates can smell if it's not washed.
8975720	8980920	And to say something is fish is to use an insulting term toward women. I will not use it.
8980920	8986920	I will not allow it to be used around me. That being said, there are women who are reclaiming
8986920	8996440	the term to use for, for strength. I think that taking a word that has such trauma and stigma
8996440	9002840	attached to it and turning it around to be something positive and good, because I mean,
9003560	9009880	queer in its dictionary definition is just different outside the usual.
9010760	9016440	If we take that and make it mean something that is normal, that's reclaiming the use of the word.
9016440	9020280	And I have no problem with it, especially for people like me who are pretty much unicorns.
9021000	9026440	You know, I am an asexual woman. Bisexual people are getting a lot more accepted that are still
9026440	9031240	kind of on that unicorn spectrum of erasure. Bisexual people also have to deal with the whole
9031240	9036360	like, you know, oh, you're just loose, you know, like, and then all that kind of garbage,
9036360	9042520	you know, or like, you know, we have a mutual friend who was in a relationship with a woman
9042520	9048120	and then married a man that doesn't suddenly make her less bi. Right. Right. Yeah. You know,
9049080	9053800	or intersex people get left out a lot. The non gender conforming get left out a lot.
9054360	9060600	You know, I think that having a blanket term, we're all outside of what society deems to be
9060600	9067800	normal. We are the unicorns. We should be helping each other instead of trying to gatekeep on who's
9067800	9072280	more queer than someone else. Oh, I like that. We're all the unicorns. You're all that on a
9072280	9078120	shirt. Although I still feel a little bit more mythical. Yeah. We're all the unicorns, but not
9078680	9082920	in the never ending story because that I can't handle it. Anyway, that there wasn't a unicorn
9082920	9086840	in the never ending story. Oh no, it was just a horse. Wasn't it? Our text was a horse. Or am
9086840	9093800	I thinking of- Did you see that cosplay? I saw that at Dragon Con. Yes, I did. That was
9093800	9098280	something else. That was some genius there. Yeah, it is. No, the sad unicorns are the ones in
9098280	9102840	legend that got killed. That, okay. I crossed my eighties movies. Okay. Yeah. Cause that's the
9102840	9105960	scene you still won't watch. I remember you talked about that. And Pixel Pacas, I'll tell you this.
9106520	9110600	Pixel Pacas says, I feel like the term is being reclaimed, being reclaimed is totally fine.
9110600	9115800	I, but I don't feel comfortable using it for myself. That's fine. Oh yeah. I know. Like,
9115800	9122120	well, when it comes to the word fancy ass guy, take that as an acronym. Some
9123240	9126600	guys like to use that as a term of empowerment. I'm a little,
9128440	9134120	I don't know. I don't know how I feel about it. It was funny enough. And this happened at Dragon
9134120	9138920	Con. A queen actually came up to me and said, you are a fish as fuck. And I'm like, that's because
9138920	9147320	I have a real vagina. And she's like, oh, I thought you were kind of short. You know what
9147320	9151080	though here? Okay. This is like totally tangent train. I'm sorry, but you know, we're getting
9151080	9154760	towards the end of the show. Deal with it. I feel like you and I need a show where like,
9154760	9158040	throughout the week when serious questions we have come up, like the one I just thought it,
9158040	9161320	we just need to write it down, put it in a jar. And like each episode we just take something out
9161320	9166280	of the jar and like have a serious fucking like discussion about doing because it's us. I know,
9166280	9169960	but like, I feel like there's a little, like there's a little more purpose here.
9169960	9173640	That was very like, what? It doesn't have a purpose. That's the, you know,
9173640	9181800	but like, I feel like Robin, Jamie, explain it all or try, try Robin, Jamie, try, insert, try
9182360	9185400	to explain to them. Oh my God. That would be great. And then the, the logo could just be
9185400	9192680	that star when in comic sans Robin, Jamie tried. Yeah. I like that. We might have to do that.
9193560	9197800	Yeah. That's it. Robin, Jamie tried. Okay. This is happening. Y'all eventually.
9198360	9201800	You like that. You want to guest on this show? Loki, Robin, Jamie tried.
9201800	9206680	Sure. Why not? Well, I am planning on doing a sister podcast that is coming around,
9206680	9210920	but I think it would be great. I mean, cause I want to do things to talk about the special
9210920	9216120	needs that sisters have. Cause I mean, we support so much in our fucking communities,
9216120	9221320	but what supports us, right? And there's lots of, there's some fight and there's some drama.
9221400	9228200	You cannot have people in a queer community that ain't got some drama. Just saying. So I'm trying
9228200	9232120	to do something for that, but I would absolutely love to have them read, just sit and talk this
9232120	9237000	shit about the stuff that's going on. Okay. We're going to plan it. Do you want, would you be willing
9237000	9241880	to do it a video show so we can like premiere it on VOG? Do like a geek? I guess. All right.
9243240	9248920	Okay. All right. I want to make Bobby perk up. I'm making content. We'll do this show while I'm
9248920	9255240	doing my makeup. Yeah, sure. Why not? Why not? You can, you can do your makeup. I guess we have
9255240	9258840	to be doing something different every show. What would I be doing? I'll learn needle point. You'll
9258840	9262760	learn needle point. All right. I'll teach you how to crochet. Oh, I'll do Perler beads. I can do
9262760	9266760	those. I have a bunch of Perler beads I hadn't used in a while. Yeah, we'll do Perler. That
9266760	9270440	would be great because then we could like, I could give away the Perler beads. So it's arts
9270440	9276040	and crafts and chat. I love that. And we tried. I'm going to fuck up. Sometimes you're going to
9276040	9281400	fuck up. I actually want to learn needle point. Cause I went, I have a linen apron and I just
9281400	9287080	wanted to say kitchen bitch and then have the B slashed out and do a W over it. That's funny.
9287080	9290200	You talk about that. Cause I've been on a good place binge this past week. I've never watched
9290200	9296680	that show. So I want a shirt that says dress bitch so bad. Or, um, what was, Oh God, what was
9296680	9304840	the one help somebody it's season three when Chidi has a moment and he goes, he goes to the store
9304840	9309960	and he takes it that they're like, sir, you have to wear a shirt right now. I have no fucking clue
9309960	9316280	what he's talking about. He takes the shirt and it says, Oh my God. Oh wait. Is Shane texting me?
9321640	9328680	It says who, what, where, when wine, I would wear that. Thank you, Shane. I would wear that.
9329640	9333560	Sorry. That's too good. That's like fucking I'm sitting here blanking.
9333560	9336440	Don't you wish you could do that in the real world? Like you're just there and you're like,
9336440	9339080	try to like, you're at a meeting. You're like, I forgot what I was going to say.
9339080	9342520	And then suddenly like God texts you and it's just, Oh, there's the answer.
9342520	9345000	Seriously. Still want a shirt that says Jenna clock.
9346360	9349960	All right. Uh, let's move on. Poor Rama has been singing there like,
9349960	9353880	okay, Ron, for like 15 minutes while we're sitting here talking about
9354520	9357320	everything else under the sun. Hi Rama. How are you?
9358040	9363480	I'm fine, Rob. How are you? I'm great. Now that I remembered what that fucking shirt said,
9363480	9368840	and now that we've had our queer discussion, one Oh one chat, but maybe you have a video game or
9368840	9375000	two you'd like to talk about. I just want to say, I kind of feel bad cause I'm sitting here waiting
9375000	9380520	and the chat's going and I'm like, I'm like randomly unmuting the show so I can hear what's
9380520	9385800	going on. So that when you pick up the call, there's no feedback, you know? So I'm just trying
9385960	9390280	to figure yourself out pro tip because I actually do this to monitor as well.
9390280	9393160	So I'm going to give you a little inside baseball, what happens behind the scene.
9393160	9397880	So I think everybody is figured out behind the scenes a little bit, actually. Okay. You know
9397880	9402120	what? I'm in a real fuck it mode tonight and we'll, we'll do and do things a little unprofessional.
9402120	9406360	Jamie, since you're right by the camera, would you tilt it just a little bit so that they can see the
9406360	9410760	TV and they can actually see, thank you. You're going to have to set it back. Okay. So you can
9410760	9416440	actually see, we have a TV that's here that actually lets us see like ourselves. So we know
9416440	9420600	what's going out on the stream and we can see like the discord and all of that stuff that actually,
9420600	9426360	um, goes, goes on out there. Um, so yeah, no, you're fine. That's, that's how it goes back.
9426360	9433000	So it's like, it's just like sitting just barely off there. So usually before OLR starts Bobby
9433000	9436920	Black Wolf, we have the VOG network Twitch up there on the TV. It also gave me a chance to
9436920	9441960	fix this corner of the tripod that was like about to fall off. It's been bothering me all night.
9442600	9448600	Um, so we're usually watching Bobby Black Wolf on the TV, but when, when he does that call to us,
9448600	9454760	we turn him off so that we can take the call, but we never put him back on because if he's on this
9454760	9459560	computer, then that audio is going to go out when we take the feed. So what we do, and my point is,
9459560	9466520	what we do is then I move the feed to the mobile phone and I watch on my mobile until he's done.
9466600	9471800	And then that way I'm, I'm able to quickly turn it off and start the feed. So my pro tip is if
9471800	9475800	you're sitting there on hold waiting, use your mobile phone to still, and then that way you're
9475800	9481160	not going to get the feedback. Hold on. I forgot the horns apparently. Oh, okay. According to act
9481160	9485400	deaf. So I had to throw up some horns. All right. Little look behind the scenes there. I'm sure. I
9485400	9488920	think all you knew there was like a TV or some type of monitor here. Cause you can usually,
9488920	9493800	we're just staring off and see us looking at it. We're really bad about that. I mean,
9494280	9500360	sorry. In the, I have watched some Japanese Pokemon, so I have in the brain instead of me.
9500360	9506120	Well, I'm hoping in a future studio, I'm hoping what is going to happen is that the TV will
9506120	9514120	actually be there behind Jamie or next to Jamie. So we can see it, but then, well, I'm hoping that
9514120	9521160	by then I'll have a 4k TV. So we'll have two TVs. So that's, but that's pie in the sky future
9522040	9525000	improvements, et cetera. But that's not what Rama wanted to talk about.
9525000	9526920	Of course, as she went under Matt, just clip that.
9527800	9528520	What's up Rama?
9529160	9533800	I will say that's how I kind of have my setup when I do my stream, but, um, a couple of things
9533800	9540680	now I've been reading about the whole GameStop closing stores. And normally I would sit here
9540680	9548520	and laugh and be like, sucks to be you guys, but I think I I've matured somewhat. So I'm more like,
9548520	9553560	well, maybe they do things differently because I have been saying for the longest time,
9553560	9559960	what GameStop needs to do is start closing two stores that are between each other,
9559960	9566040	find a location and between those stores, make it larger and make it sort of like a boutique
9566040	9571080	X store. Because to be perfectly honest, when I walk into GameStop, it's almost like walking into
9571960	9577080	a good, the Goodwill of video games. You walk in, there's shelves of games here,
9577080	9583400	there's clothing there, there's merch there, there's geeks. It's just like a giant mess.
9584360	9588920	You know, and I think when you talk about the whole like maturing and all that stuff,
9588920	9593720	I think it's a similar perspective maybe to like where I was saying earlier. And I think, I think,
9593720	9598920	Matt and Jamie are on a similar page where it's like, this story is a little harder to sit here
9598920	9603640	and make fun of and like LOL GameStop, because you kind of realize the people who are really
9603640	9608680	impacted by this are those workers that are really just trying to like pay their way at,
9608680	9612760	you know, and get the job experience and so forth. And you kind of feel bad for them. Like,
9612760	9617320	because this whole thing has been mismanaged for a while, and we all kind of know that,
9617320	9623160	like you just kind of feel bad for those people that are just trying to have a fucking job. You
9623160	9627000	know what I mean? I think that's where my head's at. Yeah, because I have a couple of friends who
9627000	9632520	are managers and yes, even they know they are asshole employees and so forth. And you know,
9632520	9638120	I don't even talk about GameStop like in a negative aspect anymore. I just feel like,
9638120	9642120	you know, they got a job to do. I totally get it. I've been on the other side of that,
9642120	9646200	but I know if I want to go get good service, I know a couple of stores I can travel to,
9646200	9652360	to get the best service. But you know what? Those who bust their asses in retail to give you the
9652360	9657560	best service, they don't really get the attention that you deserve as opposed to 9,000 out of 10,
9657560	9661320	it's more people complaining about the bad service instead of the good service, you know?
9663400	9669720	I totally, I know how it is. And that's customer service in general. We can go on a whole tangent
9669720	9673800	with that, how you remember the bad shit, but you know, the good shit doesn't always stick out as
9673800	9679400	much, but well, that stuff does too. Like I think there's probably a restaurant you go to more often
9679400	9683400	than others because you just really like some of the staff that works there. But anyway, I digress.
9683400	9686040	Now I stopped working retail the moment I get held up at gunpoint.
9687480	9689400	Well, yeah, that's a pretty-
9689400	9690920	At a GN fucking C.
9690920	9693160	But you know, that's kind of like an outlier type of experience too.
9693160	9694600	Yeah, but at a GMC.
9694600	9696600	Yeah. No, I know. No place is immune.
9697400	9701880	To back up what Jamie said, that actually happened to a friend of mine about two years ago working at
9702680	9709480	AT&T flagship store. Yeah, she worked about four months afterwards. Cause you know,
9710280	9713960	to be perfectly honest, when you've been in retail for so long, it takes a while to make
9713960	9718520	that adjustment from the retail sector to the private sector, you know, trying to find
9719080	9723960	where, what type of job that you fit in and so forth, your skillset. Like I said,
9723960	9728760	I got lucky being in IT my entire life. So I was able to make that jump a lot easier than others.
9730520	9733880	It's so funny. You're talking about like this whole like private sector and stuff.
9733880	9735960	I'm going to text you something cause I don't want to stay on here.
9735960	9743800	I went, I went from mortgage servicing to IT and honestly, I love IT so much more.
9744920	9745480	Yeah.
9746760	9748040	Anything else on your mind, my friend?
9749240	9753880	Can I talk a little gaming nerdy romance for a bit?
9755080	9759160	Duh, of course, please. Is it going to be, is it going to be the Musk game?
9759800	9763480	No, this is, this is actually ties into Castle Crashers.
9765960	9770840	So I haven't really said, but I've been dating somebody for about, let's say about two,
9770840	9776680	three months. And when she came to visit, we were hanging out gaming and she noticed I had
9776680	9783720	Castle Crashers. So I'm like, she's like getting a little excited and I didn't realize that's like
9783720	9788360	one of her all time favorite games. So while she was here, we played Castle Crashers.
9788360	9794920	And I said, you know, I got free time on Sundays, so we should make it our gaming night. Now, due
9794920	9802280	to us having odd schedules on the weekends, we couldn't do it until like tonight. Cause she was
9802280	9805800	not in the best of mood. So I said, you know what, if you're feeling up to it,
9805800	9809480	let's jump on live, play Castle Crashers, kind of get away from it all.
9810120	9816280	So I, she goes, I got the game up and running, jump on it. I go and I fire up the game and I'm
9816280	9821320	not seeing her. I didn't realize till tonight, there was a Castle Crashers remastered and she
9821320	9826680	was on that one. I'm running, I'm playing the backwards compatible one. So I'm like, well,
9826680	9832200	I'm kind of short on funds at the moment. So let me see what I can do. So while I'm looking up,
9832600	9837800	how much it costs, and then I see the deal for the upgrade, she pings me a messenger with a code.
9838920	9844760	She bought me Castle Crashers remastered just so we could game together. And I'm just sitting there
9845320	9851800	stunned. I'm just like, you did what? She's like, that's sweet. You're going to buy her dinner.
9852840	9858440	I've already bought her dinner. I bought her some cute stuff. So, you know, I've been spoiling her
9858440	9864200	and she spoiled me. And here's the part that kind of also blew my mind. After we played,
9864200	9870920	she sends me a picture of her with her gaming headset and she's wearing a Sailor Mars shirt.
9870920	9876360	And I'm just looking at her like that shirt. And she's like, what do you mean? I sent her a picture
9876360	9882200	of me with my headphones and I'm wearing the Venus version of that shirt, same artist,
9882200	9886920	but two different send sheets. So we were like, we are on the same hive mind or something. So,
9886920	9896200	you know, nerdy love in a nutshell. I love this story. I want regular updates on this story.
9898440	9904520	Well, you'll be getting some updates. Um, we do have some future couple cosplays planned
9904520	9915160	coming down the line. So you know, couple cosplay. Yes. I love it. I can't wait to
9915160	9921960	keep making fun of you. Go right ahead. You know, but it's funny, you know, and, you know,
9922760	9927320	we go a ways back. We met in the same fandom, Ranma what have, and it's like,
9929240	9937880	she knows what Dan and I met. Yeah. Well, in town square Sailor Moon over our love of Ranma,
9937880	9941960	you know, that's how Alan and I met in town square Sailor Moon over your love of Ranma.
9941960	9943960	No, we actually didn't meet that way at all, but it sounded good.
9945720	9952280	But what's cool is that we've met in the same fandom, but she is, she's like, she's my Midwest
9952280	9957960	Ucchan. Cause I said to her, I already have an Ucchan. She gets that title cause we're,
9958600	9962120	that's how it goes. And she's like, okay, I'm cool with that. So, you know,
9962120	9968360	so now I got two awesome Ucchans in my life. That's so cute. I love it. All right. Well,
9968360	9974040	sadly I do have to move on cause we have to wrap up here pretty soon, but I look forward to
9974040	9978440	hearing from you again and hearing what other games y'all are playing together in the future.
9978440	9983320	I will say this video games are fun cause you mentioned she's in the Midwest. So obviously
9983320	9988600	you got some long distance thing going on there. I will mention video games are awesome for like
9988600	9993080	bridging that, especially in this day and age with the multiplayer games. Um, because, you know,
9993080	9996920	Alan and I, we weren't really long distance. We were like mid distance. Okay. He lived in South
9996920	10001480	San Francisco. I lived up here in Sacramento. That's about a hundred, 120 miles apart. So like
10001480	10006920	doable on the weekend, but not really doable during the week. So we played a lot of world
10006920	10010680	Warcraft back in the day and it was like, we would go party and questing together and stuff.
10010680	10018360	It was really like he had his Albear or Moonkin or whatever. Yeah. So, uh, video games,
10018360	10025560	they bring people together. I love it. All right, Rama. Okay. I got to go. Cause I'm still kind of
10025720	10029240	shocked slash blushing over this whole thing. I'm just like, I got to get back to my,
10029240	10036200	my semi normal moody self, you know? I love it. All right. Well have fun blushing.
10038360	10044440	Okay. Take care, buddy. Bye. Bye. Ah, so good to hear from Rama. And I love that I had no,
10044440	10048280	am I just behind on social media? I had no idea that that was like a thing that was going on.
10048280	10054040	I knew you knew, but we talked. Yeah, that's fair. And I I've been really out of the loop between
10054920	10059320	going out of town for so long for dragon con coming back and having to wrap everything up
10059320	10062680	at my last job and then immediately start a new job where I was out of town for a week.
10062680	10067160	Like I've just been out of it y'all. So. Apologies if I've been behind on social media,
10067160	10071000	if you like got married or something and I forgot to congratulate you or you had a baby or something,
10071000	10074440	like just send me a message and I'll give you your belated congratulations. You didn't like
10074440	10077880	have another baby or anything. Did you? No, I didn't have anything like that happened this week.
10078040	10084200	Besides that Nelly had the babies. You know what I mean? No, I didn't do any of that.
10084200	10090040	Why are you laughing? Did something happen this week? Yeah. You mentioned it on Twitter.
10094440	10102680	What happened this week? I started a new job. No. You did. I remember replying to you about
10102680	10109560	something. You'll figure it out eventually. That is the worst possible fucking thing you
10109560	10114360	can say to somebody that has like no fucking memory in the world. Now I'm on the spot here.
10114360	10118200	Hold on. I'm looking because there was something Logie tweeted about and I was like,
10119080	10123400	Oh God, I just went through the 20 tweet thread of my friend that was watching
10124120	10130520	kidnapped in plain or what is that? Abducted in plain sight. That was it for the very first time.
10131480	10138520	Oh my God. It was your fucking birthday earlier this week. And I'd forgot to say
10138520	10145480	something on the show last week. I'm such an asshole. Happy birthday. I remember. Look,
10145480	10151880	here's the thing. Loki's birthday. Very hard to forget. So I said, well, I was also busy making
10151880	10157480	myself sad. His birthday. I had no problem. So I'm not that forgetful. I did say happy birthday on
10157480	10162200	the birthday and tweet about it. But that was like Tuesday and today is Sunday. Tuesday might
10162200	10167400	as well have been like 500 years ago. Like it's just, that's how fast things move. What did you
10167400	10172280	get to do for your birthday? Um, I didn't really do anything on my birthday, but we went to being
10172280	10178920	honest. Like you do. That's a great reward. Did you get the fried rice? Yeah. God, that's the best
10178920	10185320	stuff in the world. I haven't eaten at Benihana. I will point out only like only like two people
10185320	10194360	in chat caught on. So y'all are just as dumb as I am. I'm trying to redeem these keys for
10194360	10199720	Borderlands three, but their site is just, I was wondering what that website was. It looked like,
10199720	10204120	well, like, okay. So I went in and I had registered like earlier and then it linked,
10204120	10209320	it created a whole new profile attached to my other email address. So I was like, okay,
10209320	10214200	well that's not the one I use for Borderlands. So that's not going to work. So I have to redeem all
10214200	10219880	the keys again. Did you, did, uh, did the kids get you anything for your birthday?
10219880	10226280	No, no, no gaming stuff. No. What? We got to fix that. Did you buy yourself
10226280	10230440	Borderlands three for your birthday? I was just going to buy it anyways. There's that. All right,
10230440	10233560	well we gotta, we gotta pull our money together and get you something nice for your birthday.
10234120	10239480	All right. Pod culture says I didn't catch it and my birthday is the day before Loki's.
10239480	10243480	Thank you and happy belated to you as well. Pod culture. I hope you had a great day.
10243480	10248520	So good. Um, SG100 Matt says, I also didn't say happy birthday on Loki's Facebook,
10248520	10252920	but I don't go on it anymore. Fair. Excuse me. Happy birthday, Loki. Thank you. So there you go.
10253480	10257160	It's just another, right? You hit a certain point where it's like, eh, it's just another year.
10257160	10263160	Was this year 38 or 39? 39. Oh, so the big ones next year. So are you gonna do anything for 40?
10263800	10269800	I don't know. Right answer. All right. Anyhow. Uh, I think that's gonna about wrap it up. Well,
10269800	10273240	actually I do want to check if there are any last minute stories, uh, real quick here. I
10273720	10279240	uh, caught anything for, uh, any other things people want to talk about Loki or dark Sakura
10279240	10283240	with last minute stories. Not a thing from law. No, I forgot to put a box for last minute
10283240	10287480	stories tonight. Whoops. Oh, Wells. I don't think we have any. So do you have anything?
10288440	10292600	No, but now won't let me, I guess. Oh, I, okay. I get what's going on here. Cause I was like
10292600	10300040	trying to redeem this and it, it did what I needed it to do, but it, it's just a weird,
10300120	10305960	so yes, I got all my golden keys still and maybe two weapons because apparently they link.
10305960	10310840	Cause I linked my Epic account to both of them. I had to unlink it from one. So
10312920	10316840	I don't know. It's stupid. Uh, what level are you? Borderlands three.
10316840	10320440	Oh, I'm like three. I haven't, I've only played for like a couple hours. Yeah. Well,
10320440	10323400	hopefully you get to play some more. I almost don't want to play Zane anymore.
10323400	10326840	I kind of want to play as the beast master again, but I can always play the game again.
10326840	10331800	All right. Um, well, uh, any final thoughts, I guess, uh, we'll go around and get final thoughts.
10331800	10336440	Oh, I did. I'm sorry. I did have one last minute, sir. Real quick. Um, so there's this,
10336440	10341320	luckily it's your birthday, so I'll let it slide. There's this, uh, project that's being worked on
10341320	10348040	called project 1999 green. It's going to be released October 25th. And what is it? You may
10348040	10356680	ask? Well, it is Charlie XCX and a Troye Sivan collaboration. No, it is the original version
10356680	10362840	of EverQuest. They are putting a, um, some fans are putting together a server that's like
10362840	10368920	EverQuest classic. Oh, I was just so like, wow. Classic inspired type of thing. Interesting.
10368920	10373080	Yeah. So they're going to, and the servers will then change progress through all of the patches
10373080	10377960	in the same timeline as the original launch. So in January, 2020, you get plane of fear,
10377960	10386760	April, 2020 plane of hate, uh, may, 2020 temple of the Celeste row. And then legacy items, uh,
10386760	10395560	cease to drop November, 2020 ruins of, uh, Knark and 2021 April epics. And it goes on from there.
10395560	10402680	Where's final fantasy 11 classic. Am I right? It is still classic. It is. It's still going
10402680	10410120	to beta RO to come back just with the fast leveling warp, please. He'll please prompt,
10410120	10417480	please prompt, please. One of my favorite pictures ever was when you and I were playing that game
10417480	10420760	and we both had our little stars masks on and the characters that you were so cute. We were
10420760	10425400	kneeling down next to each other. And I think I had a flower in my hair and a, Oh, it was a bow
10425400	10429480	and the stars mask. I was like, I wish we could find that picture playing a priest. I have it
10429480	10433640	somewhere on my computer and I think it was playing my assassin. We need to post it on
10433640	10438840	social media somewhere. It's tiny. I mean, this was low res cause I think it was like windows 95,
10438840	10445240	but still, yeah, I'll find this computer probably could run it. All right. Anyway. All right. Uh,
10445240	10448680	that's going to do it for another episode of orange laundry tonight. Thank you guys so much
10448680	10453560	for listening to the show, either on the podcast feed, of course, or if you were watching us live
10453560	10457480	on Twitch or even in the archives on Twitch, cause you're a subscriber. Thank you so much for your
10457480	10462360	support of orange lounge radio. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Um, been having a lot of fun
10462360	10467880	these past few weeks and we're marching on, on to episode 800 and, uh, looking at doing some
10467880	10472200	retooling of a few segments of the show, uh, which I still have yet to talk to Jamie and Matt about,
10472200	10476680	but, uh, I know they have ideas too. So we have some fun stuff in store. Hopefully nothing too
10476680	10480120	idea. I don't want you guys to freak out. It's not a big deal, but you know, just once, once in
10480120	10484280	a while you got to fluff the pillows, zhuzh it up a little. So that's, that's what we're talking
10484280	10491000	about. So anyhow, then pillows be even fluffier out, we'll be sleeping vertical. If you enjoyed
10491000	10494200	what you heard here at orange launch radio, please tell a friend or two about the show.
10494200	10497160	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,
10497160	10501400	but the voices have to be here to like put out on the air and stuff. So please
10501400	10505720	help us spread the word. Um, we got to go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.
10505720	10511880	Uh, dark, Oh, a nice five star review on iTunes goes a long way. Hosts on Twitch are the best.
10511880	10514760	So if you have a Twitch account, even if you don't stream that much yourself,
10514760	10522840	please consider adding VOG network and Rob Roberts and dark Sakura. I had to and Loki of course,
10522840	10528040	to your auto host list, uh, on, but most of all VOG network to your auto host list, because that
10528040	10532360	all goes a very, very long way in helping to spread the word. Cause I know I find new streams
10532360	10536280	from what my friends are watching. So think about how you might've found this anyway. Uh,
10536280	10539000	let's go around and get everybody's final thought. Uh, dark Sakura, since you're,
10539000	10542600	you're packing up about ready to get out for the night. Well, if Dan will ever tell me what
10542600	10546200	he needs from the freaking grocery store, if he wants to wait to go with me, I mean,
10546200	10551960	geez, husband, how hard is it to answer your text messages? You've got car play. I mean, I love you.
10554040	10558920	Uh, my final thought is speaking of cars, like I'm even though my current car is not paid off,
10558920	10563880	I can't, they're, they're leaving me those flyers, like trade in your car and get a new car. And I'm
10563880	10569000	like, Oh, they send those to everybody. I go, of course they do, but I'll be honest though,
10569000	10574600	the roller skate is starting to have issues. No, it still makes me go. I kind of want a new car.
10574600	10579000	Doesn't Alan want to take over the payments on my car so I can get a new roller skate. I was
10579000	10583560	driving by the rink over here and I'm surprised how packed that thing is. Oh yeah. Oh, they do
10583560	10587880	like private events and stuff. I think especially like, cause there's a lot of big churches in the
10587880	10591960	area and a lot of them will rent it out and do like, you know, teen and kid events. I'm just
10592200	10598360	people to suggest cars that are as small as a Fiat, but aren't a smart car or, um, a Chevy spark.
10599960	10604760	So, all right. Uh, let's see. I was your final thought. My final thought, your final thought,
10605560	10609640	uh, my final thought is hopefully get the place more Borderlands this week and I'm still working
10609640	10615400	on my game. I hope so too. Don't forget your cookies. Oh yeah. Those cookies are, I ate
10615400	10619800	fucking four cookies, dark soccer. They were really good. So I'm glad you enjoyed. All right,
10619800	10623880	we'll see what cookies. I didn't bring them all with me as I have some waiting for me at home.
10623880	10627880	We'll see what cookies are in store next week. We will be back next week to do this all again.
10627880	10631400	You're still here next week, right? I know there's a show in the near future you're off, but
10631400	10638840	that is after I have my surgery. Oh, that's October, right? That is the weekend after.
10638840	10642760	Yeah. Cause October is getting crazy cause I have a bunch of hosting gigs, but none of them are on
10642760	10647880	Sunday, but that actually may depend on my recovery. So it's a, it's a depends. All right.
10647880	10651320	It depends because I have the week off of work after that to recover from my surgery,
10651320	10655240	but they say that may only need two days. Oh, cool. All right. Well, we will be back in seven
10655240	10659560	days. All of us to do this show all over again, and we hope you'll be joining us at that time.
