0	18520	This week, classic game preservation, lawsuit three masters, teases, and the general lot.
18520	21640	If you'll excuse me, I'm going to go play the original medieval because I never did
21640	23520	when I was younger and its remake is coming out.
23520	26400	That's what I'll be doing over the next couple of hours while listening to the show
26400	28120	where every gamer has a voice.
28120	31120	Orange Lounge Radio.
31120	36000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
36000	37680	where every gamer has a voice.
37680	44080	It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 794 for this September 29th
44080	45480	of 2019.
45480	51680	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me here in Studio N7 in Sacramento, California, say
51680	54400	hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
54400	56440	Happy New Year, Jews.
56440	57800	Yes, Happy New Year.
57800	59880	Happy Jew Year.
59880	61280	You had last week off.
61280	62280	Yeah.
62280	66280	How you doing?
66280	67280	On fire.
67280	69240	There's a fire.
69240	70800	There's a fire in your heart?
70800	73600	In my dark, rotten heart.
73600	74600	I see.
74600	81480	Burning away the rottenness and leaving me in a mood, quote fingers, a mood.
81480	83000	And what's fanning those flames?
83000	84680	Is it the wings of a goose?
84680	86680	I haven't played it yet.
86680	87680	It's a lack of Pepto.
87680	88680	Oh, hi, Tech Master Loki.
88680	89680	How are you?
89680	90680	Hi, I'm here.
90680	91680	As you can see on the camera.
91680	92920	Or not, because you may be listening to us.
92920	94440	Yeah, they may be listening on the podcast feed.
94440	97160	Yeah, I think I need like a Zantac or something.
97160	102320	But if you want to watch us live, you can every week at Twitch TV slash VOG Network,
102320	106000	where we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right
106000	108280	after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
108280	111640	And you can chat along in our chat room and we read some of the comments throughout the
111640	112640	evening on chat.
113280	114760	Excuse me, on the stream and on our show.
114760	118840	And of course, later in the show, we'll invite your calls via Discord or if you're feeling
118840	122680	shy, of course, we take lots of questions from the chat room and all that good stuff.
122680	124920	So we have to catch things up on Dark Sakura.
124920	128440	We have to we have to go over the outstanding agenda items from our last meeting for meeting
128440	130000	number 793.
130000	131000	Did you write the minutes?
131000	135760	So yes, item number one, Dark Sakura, I brought you an offering.
135760	139040	It's a new little Mortal Kombat mini machine that I paid you for.
139040	140040	You did.
140040	141880	But I talked a little bit about this on last week's show.
141880	143960	I'm just kind of curious what you think of it in person.
143960	146200	This is kind of funky on it.
146200	147200	Yeah.
147200	148600	They're probably that way to be.
148600	153160	You know, I didn't even notice it right off the bat, but there's six buttons on it.
153160	154160	Yeah.
154160	155160	Five.
155160	156160	That's really weird.
156160	157160	I think Loki noticed that, like, right off the bat.
157160	158160	He was like, why is there six?
158160	161640	But I saw in the picture that you sent, but I was like, maybe it was just well, then it's
161640	162680	got there.
162680	163680	It's a block button.
163680	165820	It's a port of the Genesis version.
165820	169360	And although someone like I don't know if they've confirmed it or not.
169360	172800	You said that there was no blood in there, but it alludes to a blood code.
172800	175960	And since it's a Genesis version, you'd think that you'd still be able to put the blood
175960	176960	code in.
176960	179080	It doesn't say anything on it.
179080	180080	Yeah.
180080	181080	About licensing.
181080	182080	I didn't.
182080	184840	I haven't, to be honest, I haven't really turned it on and played with it yet.
184840	187980	That's something I hope to do a little later.
187980	188980	So we'll see.
188980	189980	Anyway.
189980	190980	I'm turning it on.
190980	191980	Yeah.
191980	194720	I already played a little bit with it on this feed last week, so I don't want to repeat
194720	195720	ourselves too bad.
195720	198080	But I just wanted to see what you thought of that in person now that you're here.
198080	200400	It doesn't look like the Genesis version though.
200400	201720	It's got better animation.
201720	205020	You think it looks like the Genesis version to me, but it might be different hardware
205020	206020	in there.
206020	207020	Who knows?
207020	208020	Anyway.
208020	209400	Um, there was another outstanding agenda item.
209400	210400	Oh yes.
210400	211400	Things of super importance.
211400	215000	Cause you know, we do talk video games here at Orange Lawn Radio, but once in a while
215000	216800	other things come up too.
216800	220340	So Loki tried to go back to the chicken place last week and guess what?
220340	221520	They're gone.
221520	222520	They're gone.
222520	223520	Out of business already.
223520	224520	It's been like a month.
224520	225520	Chicken.
225520	226520	The Korean chicken place.
226520	227520	Oh, that sucks.
227960	229440	A moment of silence, please.
229440	231400	They are officially gone.
231400	232400	Wow.
232400	237960	Because, uh, I did see like if you actually go up on Google reviews, someone posted the
237960	240640	eviction notice, so it's legit.
240640	241640	They've been evicted.
241640	242640	Yikes.
242640	244160	No more, no more awesome chicken.
244160	245280	At least I had it twice.
245280	248880	I hope it wasn't cause they failed a health inspection like real bad or something.
248880	253040	That's uh, whatever they were doing, whatever rat feces were in there, it was delicious.
253040	255200	So that was actually the flavor apparently.
255200	256200	All right.
256200	257200	Anyway, that's, that's what made it taste so good.
257880	261160	It's like, Hmm, maybe I should try Rafi says more often if it tastes like buttery chicken.
261160	262160	Yeah.
262160	263160	All right.
263160	264160	Let's get into games.
264160	265160	Dang it.
265160	268160	There's a, there's a lot going on this week in the gaming world.
268160	271840	Uh, TwitchCon was this week, which is TwitchCon is more one of those.
271840	276000	Like it's gaming culture, obviously, obviously we were fans of Twitch here cause we're doing
276000	279720	our show here live on Twitch, uh, before it goes to the podcast feed.
279720	283040	But I think there's lots of people that have certainly consumed Twitch in one way or the
283040	284040	other.
284040	287220	And I know you might be out there thinking, Oh, I'm more a mixer person.
287220	288220	Mixer is better.
288220	289220	Or I like to go on YouTube.
289220	291120	I think there's better stuff on YouTube.
291120	295600	I still kind of think even if you're a fan of an alternative platform for whatever reason,
295600	298820	these sorts of conventions are good to keep your eye on because you know, since there
298820	303520	is a little bit more competition coming from specifically mixer, I think in this space,
303520	307960	cause we all know the Ninja thing and by the way, on the tangent, no, I know what you're
307960	308960	talking about.
308960	309960	Y'all know.
309960	310960	Y'all know.
310960	311960	I watched that singing.
311960	312960	Who's under the mask show, right?
313560	318840	What was, I was not expecting freaking Ninja of all people to be one of the celebrities.
318840	320920	I mean, there's, there's your representative.
320920	322400	Oh, you know, it's funny though.
322400	325680	Cause when he got introduced, this is how you know it's not live and that they taped
325680	330640	this stuff like months ago because, uh, Nick Cannon, the host actually said Twitch streamer,
330640	334160	like Twitch guy, he actually said Twitch his name, even though all this shit about mixer
334160	336600	has happened when like several weeks ago.
336600	342020	But yeah, he, he was one of the celebrities that was, uh, in the mask.
342020	346260	Tim and Johnny Weir, who is a great figure skater if you've ever like watched that stuff.
346260	347260	Anyway.
347260	348260	He's so all right.
348260	349260	All right.
349260	350260	Yeah.
350260	352900	I mean, you know, but there's a, I just think I love the costumes.
352900	355220	So nobody, nobody's that great a singer.
355220	357100	It was very much a Fortnite costume.
357100	360260	Like I would not be surprised if that's a new skin that's coming to Fortnite.
360260	361260	Oh God.
361260	362260	Yeah, probably.
362260	363260	Anyway.
363260	364260	All right.
364260	365440	Not to get on that tension too much, but I couldn't help but bring it up.
365440	369140	But I still think, you know, in that competitive outlet with everything, like you kind of want
369140	374540	to watch what Twitch does because, you know, other people are going to, uh, respond to
374540	379020	it in various ways, whether it be with their own, you know, um, new features that are inspired
379020	383320	by Twitch or vice versa, sometimes Twitch kind of borrows things from other places.
383320	389660	So anyway, um, dark Tetsuya in our chat over Twitch TV slash vog network says, wow, he
389660	390660	got on that show.
390660	391660	Yeah.
391660	392660	Go, go figure.
392660	393660	Yeah.
393660	395460	How does that conversation even start?
395460	398860	Like who it's, what's our dream list of people we want to be on the mass singer.
398860	401240	Hey, someone get that Ninja guy.
401240	405300	And it's not like it can even be like, Oh, he'll promote it with his fans that he can't.
405300	410340	None of them can because you don't know who's in there until they get kicked off the show.
410340	411340	Right.
411340	412340	It's weird.
412340	413340	I don't know.
413340	414340	Anyway.
414340	415340	Act F says this is a gaming podcast.
415340	416340	Hypothetically.
416340	418820	I mean, that's the category things are under.
418820	419820	He plays games.
419820	420820	Yeah.
420820	421820	I mean, yeah.
421820	422820	Anyway.
422820	423820	All right.
423820	424820	Moving on.
425180	426180	Let me just say this again.
426180	427180	I'm a little bit sad.
427180	428180	I couldn't go.
428180	429580	I haven't been in several years.
429580	434300	The last Twitch con I went to was when they had it at the Moscone center.
434300	437340	And I want to say that was almost four years ago, maybe five years ago at this point.
437340	442000	But that actually, so, so it was actually our voiceover guy who's a big Twitch supporter
442000	445700	and community, you know, personally, he's in a lot of Twitch channels, including this
445700	446700	one.
446700	449540	Um, Jason like was like, no, no, I have an extra ticket.
449540	451820	You're going to Twitch con and come up here for the day.
451820	452820	Come on.
452820	453820	You know?
453820	458900	And so, and I'm actually really glad he forced me to go because that really helped me like
458900	465340	get Twitch a lot more and actually kind of inspired me to do kind of what's happening
465340	466340	now.
466340	470500	I mean, you know, eventually it wasn't a direct path to OLR being on Twitch, but I don't think
470500	472340	we would have got here without that.
472340	474900	So, um, yeah, Twitch con was very inspiring.
474900	479340	So I've kind of wanted to go every year since, but they've had it on really bad weekends.
479340	483180	They usually have it around Halloween and I'm almost always committed to hosting a show
483180	484180	like October.
484180	487700	Cause y'all know, I do hosting gigs here locally on the side for cult cinema and burlesque
487700	488700	and stuff.
488700	490380	And so I do like improv and stuff.
490380	493620	So October is a crazy month for that stuff.
493620	496740	September would have been great if I didn't start a new job just three weeks ago, so I
496740	497740	couldn't make it.
497740	500460	But next year they've already announced, that's one thing to point out.
500460	503820	They've already announced the dates for next year and there's two Twitch cons cause they're
503820	506060	going to have one in Amsterdam earlier in the year as well.
506060	510220	So, uh, but I will definitely, definitely go next year, assuming it doesn't like sell
510220	511780	out or something silly.
511780	514900	So as we mentioned, uh, there's going to be a European Twitch con that will happen May
514900	521140	2nd and 3rd, 2020 and San Diego will be the home once again, uh, for Twitch con, uh, next
521140	522140	year.
522140	523140	And it's not in October.
523140	524140	It's kind of the same weekend next year.
524140	528160	It's the last weekend of September, uh, the 25th through the 27th, some new things that
528160	529420	are going to be coming to Twitch.
529420	533880	There's going to be a creator dashboard so you can actually set up actions on your dashboard.
533880	539360	It sounds to me a little bit like, like these little stream deck clicky things, like that
539360	542560	the new dashboard is kind of inspired by that a little bit.
542560	545560	So, you know, we like our, our push buttons to be able to do things.
545560	547520	So it sounds like it might be a little bit like that.
547520	548640	This is really cool too.
548640	552120	Um, viewers will be able to earn points for doing things you're already doing that you
552120	557400	can use for rewards like tier one emotes, highlighting a message or other things that
557400	559040	we decide to turn on for you.
559040	562800	I'm sure we here at VOG Network will do something with that.
562800	564960	I just don't know what we'll do with that yet.
564960	568200	I'm not going to promise we'll turn everything on, but I mean, I could see where like the
568200	570880	highlighting the messages or I'm all I'm big on emotes.
570880	572880	Like we could, we could try to use some of that stuff.
572880	575280	So that sounds kind of interesting.
575280	578320	Um, this is also a big, big deal.
578320	580400	Ads are going to change on Twitch.
580400	586640	Um, so ads will not necessarily be right at the top of the fee.
586640	589400	You know how, like, if you go to a channel that you're not subscribed to, you get like
589400	590800	a pre-roll ad.
590800	596020	Those may not necessarily be there moving forward because now affiliates as well as
596020	599080	partners will be able to add drop midstream.
599080	604000	So if we wanted to, when we wanted to take a quick 30 second studio break or something,
604000	605000	we could play an ad.
605000	606200	I'm not saying we're doing that.
606200	608060	I don't know how it's going to work yet.
608060	609880	We got a lot to talk about and dissect.
609880	612880	And most importantly, we have to see it in action.
612880	616840	You gotta, you gotta know what tools you really have because there's, there's the spiel that
616840	617840	they give on stage.
617840	618840	Right?
618840	622040	There's nothing with E3 or any type of show where they're showing a new game.
622040	626600	There's the spiel they give you on stage and then it's what it really looks like, right?
626600	628240	There's no man's sky.
628240	630940	There's what they show you on stage and then there's what it really looks like when it
630940	631980	comes out.
631980	633960	And then it's awesome three years later, to be fair.
633960	637560	Uh, there's the Final Fantasy 7 remake, which looked pretty good on stage.
637560	639220	Like there's no way the game's going to look that good.
639220	641760	And now that they're actually showing it, it's like, oh, holy shit, it does kind of
641760	642760	actually look that good.
642760	646360	So, but anyway, we have to see kind of what the ads and all that stuff really look like.
646400	649080	So that'll, that'll be interesting.
649080	654120	And also they're going to be building in a new studio to make it easier for new creators
654120	656040	to get started with setup.
656040	660960	There's going to be templates, you know, kind of making the path to streaming a little bit
660960	662960	easier.
662960	669400	Let me ask a question of everybody here in studio as well as in our chat room.
669400	673560	Is this a good thing that the accessibility and the way to be able to stream is going
673560	680160	to get easier or is it going to saturate what might already be an oversaturated website?
680160	684080	Like is it, are too many people live streaming?
684080	688120	I don't necessarily think it's going to over saturate anything because people can already
688120	689120	stream.
689120	692280	It's just that you're not going to have all the, you know, templates and everything to
692280	694520	make it look more professional.
694520	699200	It's just, this is adding that kind of polish to your average stream.
699200	704880	So that kind of brings everybody up so that the quality's much better than just like some
704880	713040	really shit quality stream that is in a really low resolution with just, I don't know, graphics
713040	718480	made in paint and who knows, I don't know what the worst case scenario would be, but
718480	723240	I think it's just helpful tools that they have to kind of like make their platform seem
723240	727360	more desirable than say like Mixer or something like that.
727360	729240	So it's like, hey, look, you know, we'll make it easy.
729240	733440	Here's some, here's some pieces that you can use to kind of get yourself started.
733440	736200	Dr. Sacco, what do you think?
736200	737200	I agree with that.
737200	740640	And there's another aspect to this and that's branding.
740640	746200	Twitch has to provide a set standard that's going to fit their brand.
746200	753200	Everything, even if it's individual content providers doing their things, they're still
753240	757600	going to have to have something that ties it all back to Twitch and not just that you're
757600	760440	using their interface.
760440	763640	Actually you may not be aware of this and I think you should definitely look at this
763640	766160	and I'll have to send you the direct link if I can find it or maybe somebody can put
766160	767160	it in chat.
767160	770600	Twitch, as part of this whole Twitch kind of thing, did a massive rebranding.
770600	775440	Like they haven't reinvented the site completely, but they kind of went, here is our tweaked
775440	777560	logo and this is why we tweaked it.
777560	781140	Here is our new color of purple and this is why we went with a brighter purple.
781140	784860	And then they said, here's all the official shades that we will support.
784860	786980	And they named them all after video game related things.
786980	790180	So there's like a jiggly is one of the colors because it looks like Julie Puff and so on
790180	791180	and so on.
791180	792180	There's all these different colors.
792180	795380	And they said, we're changing our font and the new font is this and this is why we're
795380	796760	going with this font.
796760	799440	And I thought as I was reading it, I actually thought of you because I know you're a big,
799440	802300	like you went to school for design and all that stuff and I kind of thought, I bet Jamie
802300	805140	would appreciate that they're not just saying we're changing our brand, but they're kind
805140	807820	of explaining this is what we want to say with it.
807820	810940	We're picking a bolder purple because we want to be bolder, you know, that type of thing.
810940	811940	I thought that was interesting.
811940	817460	No, um, I, I'll be honest, I love the concept of rebranding.
817460	821860	I like it when it's done in a very seamless method.
821860	826220	Like when they say, you know, we're still using purple, but we're using this shade of
826220	827220	purple now.
827220	828220	You know what I mean?
828220	833000	Like if you look at this one shade of pink, you look at and you always think Barbie, right?
833000	839060	If you look at that combination of purple and black today, most of the time for branding,
839060	840680	we're going to think of Twitch.
840680	843740	And that's why they're, you know, with them choosing their specific colors that makes
843740	846360	brand recognition at a glance and just look at the color.
846360	851040	You know, if you look at, you know, a couple of V's and one of them's orange, one of them's
851040	855480	blue, you're going to think of Chevron, you know, it's that immediate recognition.
855480	859120	But I also think though that tying in all the rest of this is another part of that branding
859120	860120	re-effort.
860120	861120	That's right.
861120	862120	You know what?
862120	863120	You're right.
863120	865120	In certain, in certain circles anyway, cause I bet some people when they see the purple
865120	869280	and black or at least the old purple, I think this new purple is a brighter, bolder one
869280	870880	that's going to really stick out.
870880	873940	But like I would say the old purple and black kind of looked like a sports team.
873940	875260	Is it the Jaguars or something?
875260	880440	There's a sports team that has very, or no shit, the Kings here locally are like purple
880440	881440	and white.
881440	882440	Yeah.
882440	884080	Kings are more using the purple and white.
884080	885080	But it depends.
885080	886760	See, it depends what you're into, right?
886760	889760	But maybe Twitch is going with a different shade of purple too, cause it doesn't like
889760	891380	this new purple doesn't look like a sports team.
891380	892380	It's very interesting.
892380	894320	I did notice things are a little brighter.
894320	895320	Yeah.
895320	898240	So anyway, I just thought that was very interesting, the branding and especially you bring that
898240	899240	up like the brand.
899240	903720	Let me go back to the question at hand about should more people be getting into Twitch
903720	905920	or are there too many people in the pool?
905920	909120	Kaijuto says the more, the better.
909120	910120	Let's see.
910120	912780	Fifth Dream says it'd be nice if you could stream and make it look nice without having
912780	914160	to be a fucking wizard in OBS.
914160	915160	Yeah.
915160	917460	This'll be something that they're kind of working on there.
917460	922920	So obviously y'all know I'm a big proponent of more people getting their voices out there
922920	923920	and heard.
923920	924920	So yes, absolutely.
924920	928920	I think this is a great thing, but here's the thing.
928920	935120	I'm starting to notice a few too many people, including people I would consider good friends
935120	940960	of mine and stuff that think that they're going to make oodles of money by streaming
940960	946080	on Twitch that like you're going to get all of a sudden all these people are going to
946080	951160	show up and you're going to make money just because you play video games online.
951160	954760	And I kind of stick to myself because I feel like I've been down this road before with
954760	958760	podcasting is that people will ask, well, how much do you make by podcasting?
958760	963540	Because they think, oh, well, when I listen to RuPaul's podcast, I keep hearing ads for,
963540	964760	you know, new mattress companies.
964760	966920	I have a response to that.
966920	970920	How much do you make sitting in your pajamas?
970920	974680	How much do you make when you drive to the park?
974680	975680	Right?
975680	977880	Well, I don't get paid for that.
977880	980200	You do it because you enjoy it, right?
980200	983920	Why do you have to put monetary value on things that give you joy?
983920	984920	Right.
984920	989280	So I just, that's my only thing is that I am all for more people getting into Twitch
989280	991060	and streaming.
991060	995760	I really would ask somebody, what is your motivation for doing it?
995760	999420	And if your motivation for doing it is that I want to hang out, I want to make some friends
999420	1000840	and hang out and play games online.
1000840	1001840	Cool.
1001840	1002840	You're doing it for the right reason.
1002840	1003840	I want to start a community.
1003840	1004840	Awesome reason.
1004840	1008920	I want to get my voice out there because I don't feel represented by what's already out
1008920	1009920	there.
1009920	1011280	Fucking incredible, amazing reason.
1011280	1012800	Do it.
1012800	1017400	But if your reason is I want to make money, just stop, honey, stop.
1017400	1018400	Don't waste our time.
1018400	1019400	Well, you'll make money.
1019400	1022960	It's just, you're going to be disappointed a teeny bit and then everybody else is going
1022960	1023960	to be disappointed.
1023960	1026160	You're going to be able to buy that taco, dear.
1026160	1027560	You'll be able to buy that taco.
1027560	1032560	So you've got to really like ask yourself the motivation and at the end of the day,
1032560	1036560	if your motivation is making community, getting your voice out there, I want to be heard more
1036560	1038560	than anything else, then yes, do it.
1038560	1040400	And everybody should be out there doing it.
1041000	1045360	Kaijuto in chat says, I don't think people think they're going to make a lot of cash.
1045360	1048080	YouTube streamers broke the fourth wall on that.
1048080	1050960	Most know it's a little bit.
1050960	1051960	You'd be a little surprised.
1051960	1055040	Tigerclaw says, what about those that use places like Patreon?
1055040	1057160	As long as you're not using Kickstarter.
1057160	1064280	Patreon is fine, but I mean, again, you have to do what's best for you.
1064280	1067800	I would just say don't go into Patreon with the expectation.
1068200	1073920	Oh, if I sign up for a Patreon, I'm going to get $50 a month for sure.
1073920	1078520	You know, because that may not happen and you're just going to set yourself up for disappointment.
1078520	1081680	Like why are you going to make $50 a month?
1081680	1083480	That's the number one question to ask yourself.
1083480	1085480	Why are you going to make that money?
1085480	1088680	Anyway, let's see, what else do I have here?
1088680	1095680	Oh, I wanted to give a shout out in our chat to TSS Tech Angel, who back in the day, I'm
1095680	1100440	going to call her by her old name, DDR Angel, okay, back in the day, was actually at Twitch
1100440	1101440	Con.
1101440	1105080	And I know Angel is a big fan and proponent, I guess, of Twitch.
1105080	1107200	And she is in chat saying, hey guys, just got back.
1107200	1108800	I'm freaking exhausted.
1108800	1109800	It went well.
1109800	1112560	I gave away all 300 art cards that I'd painted.
1112560	1116200	Well, I'm super sad I didn't go to get one of those cards, but you know, new job and
1116200	1117260	everything.
1117260	1119360	And Angel says, I'm not in it for the money either.
1119360	1122720	If it happens, sure, but I'm there to enjoy doing what I do.
1122760	1127840	But you know what's awesome, Angel, is like what you just said, you gave away art.
1127840	1133480	You gave away, you didn't just give away art, you gave away 300 pieces of art.
1133480	1136640	And like that is something I don't think you can put a price on.
1136640	1137640	You know what I mean?
1137640	1139080	Like that's awesome.
1139080	1142240	So congrats and kudos.
1142240	1143240	That's amazing.
1143240	1146760	Bobby Blackwolf in chat talking about the money thing saying, I'm part of the local
1146760	1148280	Twitch streamer meetup group.
1148280	1152680	I am one of the few people who don't have aspirations of being a full time Twitch streamer.
1152680	1156520	And they think I'm crazy.
1156520	1160160	So anyway, now you're going to laugh because I'm going to say that.
1160160	1163720	And then at the same token, I'm going to say, but if you want to subscribe here to VOG
1163720	1166960	Network on Twitch, you can.
1166960	1169800	Doing so gives you access to the archives and so forth.
1169800	1172040	And we love the bits and all that stuff.
1172040	1176120	But it's one of those things where we don't expect it.
1176120	1181160	We've been doing this show for how many years, 17 plus?
1181160	1184480	Now you can see us.
1184480	1187480	Do we look like we're rolling in cash?
1187480	1195840	No, but we will be using money to buy nominal upgrades and kind of keep our website running
1195840	1196840	and things like that.
1196840	1197840	So it's good.
1197840	1199240	Is this just a facade?
1199240	1201520	It's really in our mansion that you just don't see.
1201520	1203080	It's my fucking mansion.
1203080	1204080	Here's the thing.
1204080	1205960	I will put it this way.
1205960	1208000	In the interest transparency, I will say this.
1208000	1211880	I was paying out of pocket to run VOG before.
1211880	1212880	And Bobby was too.
1212880	1213880	It's not just poor me.
1213880	1214920	Bobby was too.
1214920	1218240	We've all put in money here or there or whatever.
1218240	1223320	But now the nice thing is I'm not paying out of pocket to keep a radio feed running anymore
1223320	1224960	to deliver this show.
1224960	1227800	We're able to do that and so forth.
1227800	1231880	Some of the fees for running a business, and you'd be surprised, it costs money to have
1231880	1233720	an official business.
1233720	1238480	Some of that money was being fronted by folks, and now your stuff has gone to that a little
1238480	1240040	bit, which is really nice.
1240040	1242520	So you know, it all goes to that.
1242520	1246520	Looking in chat, Sia Tabiri in chat says, you guys don't look like you're rolling pennies
1246520	1247520	though.
1247520	1249520	Well, it's something we should start doing.
1249520	1253680	It's because they're all on my nightstand, just like pouring over.
1253680	1255440	One bit at a time.
1255440	1258640	Act Def says, I really need to get back to streaming Pokemon Go.
1258640	1261040	The Twitch Pokemon Go community needs more representatives.
1261040	1265880	Yeah, if you think there's a game that isn't being streamed enough on Twitch, by golly
1265880	1266880	do it.
1266880	1267880	This is a True Facts.
1267880	1274640	I was streaming Dragon Quest earlier this week, not Dragon Quest 11, but the original
1274640	1275640	Dragon Quest.
1275640	1277880	Because you might remember on last week's show, we talked about the HD remakes are coming
1277880	1278880	out same day, right?
1278880	1279880	Right.
1279880	1283480	So I jumped on that original Dragon Quest game, which of course was Dragon Warrior on
1283480	1287520	the NES here in the US, but we know that was a regional thing.
1287520	1291360	So I was streaming that and I was using the Dragon Warrior tag because there was no Dragon
1291360	1292360	Quest one.
1292360	1293360	So he's Dragon Warrior.
1293360	1298240	And somebody brand new found my stream and was like, hey, what do you think of the remake?
1298240	1303360	I was asking me questions about it and he was like, I can't believe only two people
1303360	1304920	are streaming this right now.
1304920	1307960	I follow this tag because I love this game.
1307960	1309920	He's like, I play this game once a month.
1309920	1311560	And I'm like, are you speed runner or something?
1311560	1313520	He's like, no, I just enjoy it.
1313520	1314780	And I'm like, you know what?
1314780	1317700	You never know who out there is going to appreciate that thing.
1317700	1318700	Who would have thought?
1318700	1322060	There's like a Dragon Warrior one hardcore stand out.
1322060	1324620	There's more than one, I'm sure that really appreciates that stuff.
1324620	1327940	I would have never known if I hadn't just said, oh, I want to play this cause the HD
1327940	1328940	remake.
1328940	1329940	And I remember this as a kid.
1329940	1330940	Maybe it's really cool.
1330940	1331940	Yeah.
1331940	1332940	It's pretty cool.
1332940	1333940	Yeah.
1333940	1334940	Anyway.
1334940	1335940	Um, let's see.
1335940	1336940	Was there anything else I wanted to talk about for TwitchCon?
1336940	1337940	Did I miss anything, uh, on the TwitchCon front?
1337940	1341740	I guess we talked about some of the redesign things and the ad stuff and some of the, it's
1341740	1342860	going to be like easier to stream.
1342940	1346180	They're going to let you subscribe via mobile, which I guess is kind of cool.
1346180	1347180	So you can do that.
1347180	1353380	Um, and, uh, some changes coming to like moderator views if you do that and then yeah, the channel
1353380	1354380	points.
1354380	1355380	So kind of neat.
1355380	1362420	I was a little bit disappointed though, that they did not give any follow up on the like
1362420	1367140	multi stream or being able to stream with other people, kind of like what Mixer does
1367140	1372620	natively and, um, on Twitch, I think partners can do it, but I was hoping they would roll
1372620	1375580	that out of the affiliate level and there wasn't anything like that at TwitchCon.
1375580	1380660	So I was a little sad about that, but obviously it's like one of those, this is my wishlist,
1380660	1381660	my pie in the sky thing.
1381660	1385380	And you know, okay, we didn't get that this time, maybe in the future, who knows?
1385380	1392180	So anyway, um, and Bobby's pointing out how the removal of some tags has really hurt some
1392180	1396220	people saying there used to be a virtual reality tag and that brought me viewers, but they
1396220	1397220	killed it.
1397220	1401900	The VR streaming community is actually abandoning Twitch over it.
1401900	1404860	That's been like, I'm trying to remember, like when I was doing streaming for like my
1404860	1409220	live development stuff during that game jam, I had these science and technology cause there's
1409220	1415540	nothing for like coding or game dev or something like that, which is weird.
1415540	1419540	Now rum, jump, stomp and chat with a fair counterpoint says you can do that.
1419540	1424740	The multi streaming thing with a site called multi Twitch, I recognize that and I respect
1424740	1425740	that.
1425740	1427060	However, here's the problem.
1427060	1431220	When it's not natively built into Twitch, this means that you have to go to this multi
1431220	1435580	Twitch thing to be able to view it the way you want to see it, which you can only do
1435580	1437320	from like a computer, right?
1437320	1442660	But part of what makes Twitch really awesome and part of why I love broadcasting on it
1442660	1450740	is that you can get Twitch on your PC, your Mac, your PlayStation, your Xbox, your mobile,
1450740	1451740	and so on.
1451740	1454600	You just can't get it on the Switch yet, but you know what I mean?
1454600	1458840	So you can't do like multi Twitch on mobile, you can't do on PS4.
1458840	1461200	So whereas it's like, okay, that's a good band-aid.
1461200	1466260	It's not really giving that full functionality that I'd like to see if that makes sense.
1466260	1470560	So anyway, yeah, everyone jumps, Tom says it isn't as good as native.
1470560	1471560	I agree.
1471560	1472560	Yeah.
1472560	1473560	So we agree on that part.
1473560	1474680	So anyway, so that's a little bit about TwitchCon.
1474680	1477600	I hope those of you that went and had a great time and I really look forward to being able
1477600	1478600	to go next year.
1478600	1480600	Although I feel like I'm going to be the oldest one there.
1480600	1486560	If I go, Angel, did you see, did you see, are there, are there people on Medicare?
1486560	1488680	Because they're 65 and older and they're streaming.
1488680	1493800	Do you see, was Wilford Brimley at TwitchCon or am I going to be the oldest one there if
1493800	1494800	I go?
1494800	1499360	Is that grandma Skyrim one that she's streaming Twitch?
1499360	1502280	If I go with you, I'll be older than you.
1502280	1503280	Yes.
1503280	1506280	So whatever.
1506280	1510460	That's you know, one thing I really, really like about DragonCon is that there really
1510460	1511880	is an age spread.
1511880	1515440	I mean, yeah, I see a lot of people in their twenties and thirties, but there's quite a
1515440	1519320	damn lot of people that go to DragonCon that are in their forties and fifties.
1519320	1521240	And honestly, I think even older than that.
1521240	1525040	So that's another, you know, obviously I'm a huge DragonCon fan at this point, but that
1525040	1528760	is one real reason I really love that con because you just, you get the spread of everything
1528760	1529760	there.
1529760	1530760	So anyway.
1530760	1531760	All right.
1531760	1532760	Let's move on.
1532760	1533760	Enough about TwitchCon.
1533760	1536120	Let's talk a little bit about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have
1536120	1538440	been playing this week.
1538440	1540760	Dark Sakura, you've been gone for a couple of weeks.
1540760	1541760	How was your gaming week?
1541760	1542760	What'd you do?
1543000	1546520	I have been playing a lot of patterned on Apple Arcade.
1546520	1551080	I really, really have been enjoying what I got on Apple Arcade, except there's this one
1551080	1553120	game that I thought I was going to like.
1553120	1556240	And so far the beginning of it is just like ridiculously boring.
1556240	1558960	It's the one that Square Enix did.
1558960	1559960	Hold on.
1559960	1560960	I'll get the name of it.
1560960	1561960	Various Day Life.
1561960	1562960	Yeah.
1562960	1563960	I'm kind of bored with it already.
1563960	1570400	But I've been playing patterned and I sort of pinball wizard, which the physics in it
1570400	1571400	are unique.
1571400	1575160	I don't really care for it that much.
1575160	1578360	Is the Apple Arcade thing free if you get a new phone or am I mixing it up with Apple
1578360	1579360	TV?
1579360	1580360	Or Apple TV Plus?
1580360	1581880	Apple TV Plus for a year.
1581880	1582880	Okay.
1582880	1583880	I'm mixing it up.
1583880	1584880	Never mind.
1584880	1587860	Apple Arcade has a one month free trial and after that it's $4.99 a month.
1587860	1591640	But if you've got family sharing, your entire family uses the one sub.
1591640	1592640	Yeah.
1592640	1594320	I was going to say, because we talked a little bit about Apple Arcade, I think last week
1594320	1595320	when you weren't here.
1595320	1597960	But I was like the $5, that's lower than I was expecting.
1597960	1598960	I would have thought $10.
1598960	1599960	So interesting.
1599960	1605920	I really enjoyed Tint and I played a little bit of Sayonara Wild Hearts.
1605920	1608160	I had a whole thing on that game last week.
1608160	1609160	I love that game.
1609160	1610160	It's really pretty.
1610160	1614280	I downloaded Shinsekai and I really am looking forward to playing that.
1614280	1619880	I got Cat Quest 2 and I'm probably, I got Shantae, but now that we've updated my Apple
1619880	1623040	TV, I'm probably going to be playing it on Apple TV.
1623040	1629120	So if I can get everything set up, I might actually be streaming from my Apple TV.
1629120	1630120	Why not?
1630120	1631120	For Apple Arcade stuff.
1631120	1634680	And then I got Oceanhorn 2, but I've got so many things on my plate.
1634680	1640920	I also went through Detroit Become Human so I could watch The Good Story.
1640920	1642600	Holy shit.
1642600	1646840	How come I never touched that game before or never watched anything about it?
1646840	1647840	That game is fucking amazing.
1647840	1650440	It took me like two years to find Mass Effect.
1650440	1651440	No longer than that.
1651440	1653920	I didn't find Mass Effect until the third game was just about to come out.
1653920	1657160	And then even after I was like, Jamie, play Mass Effect, Jamie, play Mass Effect.
1657200	1661040	And then finally after nine months, you were like, okay, I'll play Mass Effect, ooh, Garris.
1661040	1667120	Oh, look who has a Tumblr with over 10,000 followers about Mass Effect.
1667120	1668120	You're welcome.
1668120	1670240	That I haven't looked at in six months.
1670240	1671960	I finally let it die.
1671960	1675600	How interesting observation though, because before we talk about Detroit Become Human,
1675600	1678640	which I know a lot of people really love that game and people that like don't even play
1678640	1682040	a lot of games, like when I was doing my little survivor game and meeting people, like there
1682040	1685560	were people like, I don't play a lot of video games, but I love Detroit Become Human.
1685560	1686840	Like if you have PlayStation 4, you have to play that.
1686840	1690400	I was like, that's kind of a random one, but sometimes these story driven games are really big.
1690400	1691400	Oh, it's free now.
1691400	1692640	So, or it was free.
1692640	1694680	I think I did grab it during PlayStation Plus.
1694680	1695680	That's good.
1695680	1699640	But I want to kind of just, just like an observation, we've been doing this segment, the How Was
1699640	1702120	Your Gaming Week, a very long time.
1702120	1707720	And I can't remember the last time you talked about this many games in your gaming week.
1707720	1709280	Except for the cons.
1709280	1710280	Okay.
1710280	1711680	Well, it's just because like...
1712120	1716440	I'm saying it's a good thing because I'm kind of like, is this because of a subscription
1716440	1718040	service like Apple Arcade?
1718040	1721480	Is this like, now that you're at the buffet and you get to try everything, you're just
1721480	1722480	like...
1722480	1726360	It's easier for me to do things on my phone until Animal Crossing comes out and I take
1726360	1727360	the Switch with me.
1727360	1732800	It's just, there really hasn't been a lot that's like sparked my interest that much.
1732800	1741160	I mean, I'm looking at shit like, okay, okay, okay, you want to give me something that is
1741160	1748120	actually going to be interesting and fascinating for my kind of brain.
1748120	1752840	And the thing I liked about Detroit is the whole psychological aspect to it.
1752840	1756600	I will admit, I don't think I can do any of the bad playthroughs because they would just
1756600	1757600	make me sob.
1757600	1759040	They really would make me sob.
1759040	1762760	I would play it the same way every time.
1762760	1768240	But it was just such a really, really good story and I think that I need more narrative
1768240	1772720	games like that to really keep me into it.
1772720	1780320	I also went back and watched the Kara demo because I had watched that before and I thought
1780320	1781600	that was really interesting.
1781600	1787400	And I had interest in that game when they announced it and then I was just sort of like
1787400	1790560	very blase about my gaming.
1790560	1796200	We did also get Link's Awakening, which Dan has now beat twice, regular mode and hero
1796200	1798080	mode.
1798080	1802400	And it's cool, it's pretty, I love the music in it.
1802400	1804520	What do you think about it compared to the Game Boy version?
1804520	1806480	It doesn't feel like an old game.
1806480	1807480	It feels like a brand new game.
1807480	1811480	I lost interest in the Game Boy version really early on, I'll be honest, when it was new.
1811480	1814480	I didn't enjoy playing it that much.
1814480	1817320	But I really enjoy this one.
1817320	1818320	The music is great.
1818320	1823140	It's got the quirkiness and it's made me go back in and do comparisons on things.
1823140	1830040	And even though Totaka didn't work on this game, all of the easter eggs for Totaka's
1830040	1833760	theme from the Japanese version are even in the US one.
1833760	1839400	So if you put in your name as Totakeke, you get the, in fact I put a little video up on
1839400	1843680	it I think on my Instagram, but you get a jazzy version of it.
1843680	1847420	If you put your name in a Zelda you get like a really jazzy version of the old Legend of
1847420	1848420	Zelda theme.
1848420	1853380	Then if you go into the Prince's place, he was from a game called The Frog for Whom the
1853380	1855820	Bell Tolls, rough translation of it.
1855820	1860420	But if you go into the Prince's house and he's got all the frogs everywhere, if you
1860420	1864380	just hang around there for a little while after all and play Totaka's theme.
1864380	1866620	I noticed that the mayor from Sim City was in the game.
1866620	1868620	I was like, which, or Dr. Wright.
1868620	1869620	Dr. Wright.
1869620	1870620	Dr. Wright, yeah.
1870620	1871620	Dr. Wright, yeah.
1871620	1873340	But who kind of looks like Will Wright actually.
1873340	1874700	But a little bit.
1874700	1876140	Will Wright obviously doesn't have green hair.
1876140	1880380	But I was like, wow, it's weird that they put him in that game.
1880380	1881380	Kirby.
1881380	1882380	Cool.
1882380	1883380	Kirby's still there.
1883380	1884380	Oh really?
1884380	1885380	Shy guys are still there.
1885380	1886380	Yeah.
1886380	1887500	You got the Chain Chomps in there.
1887500	1893900	The thing that's cool is that they have, like in the crane game you get I think other types
1893900	1898220	of figures for Mario enemies.
1898220	1900220	And you can place them in people's houses.
1900220	1903260	They have like little pots and stands for them.
1903260	1905980	And that was really cool.
1905980	1909300	And Dan was doing just the fishing game and got a blooper.
1909300	1911700	I think I put a picture of that up on my Instagram too.
1911700	1914960	It's almost like Link's Awakening is almost in some ways like a Zelda parody game.
1914960	1917340	Did you ever watch The Gaming Historian about that one?
1917340	1918340	No.
1918340	1923700	It's really worth a watch because basically they started off making the game just to see
1923700	1926460	if it would be possible to make a Legend of Zelda game on the Game Boy.
1926460	1928660	It was sort of a what if.
1928660	1931740	And this was like their after hours personal project.
1931740	1934140	And then it actually got the right attention.
1934140	1935860	They pitched it as a game.
1935860	1938660	And basically their whole thing was, well, it's on Game Boy.
1938660	1939660	No one's going to care.
1939660	1941800	Let's put what we want in it.
1941800	1944420	That was like literally it.
1944420	1950720	And so like that's why you've got like Kirby's enemies and you have like really weird puzzles.
1950720	1952540	Like I love the chess puzzles.
1952540	1956020	It's basically if you pick up a knight piece, you have to throw it the way a knight moves
1956020	1957940	on a chess board.
1957940	1960260	And the puzzles in that one are really creative.
1960260	1963860	You know, just really, really clever.
1963860	1967660	And I like the really cutesy art style.
1967660	1972500	And the other thing that's pretty neat about it too, you know, and I'm not going to spoil
1972500	1975300	it if no one ever knows how that game is supposed to end.
1975300	1977540	And if you do, then whatever.
1977540	1978920	It's a, you know, old game.
1978920	1979920	I don't care.
1979920	1981180	I'm not still going to spoil it.
1981180	1987540	But the art styles, it kind of does to me this, like with the intro video and then the
1987540	1993640	ending video, it almost has a kind of Wizard of Oz vibe to me in the changes in the art
1993640	1994680	style.
1994680	1996480	I'll leave it at that.
1996480	2002160	It's like you've transitioned from one aspect of the story to the other and back.
2002160	2005920	So I really enjoyed it.
2005920	2007600	Toad's in the game, of course, but he doesn't.
2007600	2009240	Not Toad, Wart.
2009240	2010240	He doesn't get by Wart.
2010240	2012240	And the singing is absolutely terrible.
2012240	2013240	I love it.
2013240	2014640	It was very well done.
2014640	2016360	I was very happy with it.
2016360	2019000	And I loved going around finding the Easter eggs.
2019000	2021000	And then I cried about the ghost.
2021000	2024040	It was just sad.
2024040	2028680	And I like when you can throw the monkeys out of the trees because they're assholes.
2028680	2032760	So you played this game very thoroughly in the past couple of weeks.
2032760	2036320	Dan mostly did, because he wanted to go through hero mode.
2036320	2043480	So but sometimes you need your wife there saying, you need to look at the map.
2043480	2045220	Backseat driving, basically.
2045220	2048560	We're turning this link around.
2048560	2053600	So and I mean, I've been doing my usual Animal Crossing.
2053600	2057160	I finally got my levels high enough in idle pouring to rebirth.
2057160	2060640	And now I can't beat fucking Osiris to do the rebirth.
2060640	2061640	So like, whatever.
2061640	2064540	So I have to keep leveling so I can rebirth.
2064540	2069280	So I'm actually getting really tired of playing that game, and I'm probably not going to renew
2069280	2071920	my sub after it expires.
2071920	2076560	I'm just getting really tired of it.
2076560	2084720	I've been doing Pokemon and Harry Potter and oh, but patterned to me is one of the
2084720	2087700	best games on Apple TV, not Apple TV, but Apple Arcade.
2087700	2088700	It is absolutely.
2088700	2089700	What are you doing this game?
2089700	2090700	It's a puzzle game?
2090700	2094480	It's a puzzle game, but it's kind of unique.
2094480	2100720	It's a tiled, you know, like wallpaper, like a tiled picture where it's seamless, right?
2100720	2107240	But when you get the picture, it sketches, and you have different cut out pieces that
2107240	2109920	match the different parts of the sketch.
2109920	2113960	And as you move that piece in, it fills in color and it gets more and more opaque, the
2113960	2119760	more and more pieces that you bring in until you finish the whole piece.
2119760	2122480	And I actually put video up somewhere.
2122480	2125400	I will see if I can find that video.
2125400	2127900	I'll put it up on my Instagram and link it in chat.
2127900	2133020	So just like, you know, an example of moving a piece and so you can see what it looks like.
2133020	2134940	So I'll put that up in just a few minutes.
2134940	2139640	But yeah, that's been that's kind of like for me, my shining star, that and Tint, which
2139640	2144140	is another puzzle game where you start off with your primary colors, but you have to
2144140	2148420	mix them through one other color and get to your gold that matches this little flower
2148420	2150760	that's going to bloom and take on the next piece of the puzzle.
2150760	2155940	So it's using primary colors to create secondary colors, but sometimes you have to avoid another
2155940	2161780	color because if you cross a second color, it'll turn that mud gray color when you've
2161780	2163080	oversaturated.
2163080	2165160	So it's it's a pretty neat little game.
2165160	2168260	So those two are like probably my shining stars for Apple Arcade right now.
2168260	2169260	OK, great.
2169260	2170260	All right.
2170260	2173140	Well, you had a very busy past couple weeks.
2173140	2175600	Mine was not mine was not nearly as busy.
2175600	2177740	I'm drinking out of underwear, OK?
2177740	2181280	Oh, I grabbed a cup and I was like, oh, this is a niche.
2181280	2182280	It's underwear.
2182280	2184860	You can show it on the Twitch stream for our folks that are watching there.
2184860	2186600	I don't remember where that came from.
2186600	2190860	I think it was like a joke gift that that Alan got or something.
2190860	2191860	I don't remember.
2191860	2192860	It says Pansu.
2192860	2193860	Yeah.
2193860	2194860	All right.
2194860	2196100	Loki, how was your gaming week?
2196100	2204420	Well, I did also play Legend of Zelda Link's Awakening, not because I was like actually
2204420	2209780	playing is because my son won my my youngest son's been playing it and I've been helping
2209780	2213420	him with the parts that he can't do, which means I've played through like the dungeons
2213420	2214420	basically.
2214420	2215420	It's fun.
2215420	2220320	I'm noticing a lot of slowdown, though, as everyone's kind of pointed out.
2220320	2222180	But it's a decent game.
2222180	2227140	So it'd be fun to actually go back and play it on my own at some point.
2227140	2230380	The game, though, I did play on my own was Untitled Goose Game.
2230380	2234420	So I did finish that and then got the second set of challenges.
2234420	2236540	And I'm like halfway through those.
2236540	2240340	But there's some that I get the speed run, which I'm like, what do you think?
2240340	2243020	Because I feel like everybody has gotten around to playing this game except for me.
2243020	2246420	Like Bobby did it by Bobby did a live stream this week.
2246420	2249420	And Shane has been telling me I need to play this game, but I just I just didn't get around
2249420	2250420	to it.
2250420	2251500	I've had a lot of other stuff going on.
2251500	2252500	It's really fun.
2252500	2253500	Yeah.
2253500	2254500	Yeah.
2254500	2255500	Why?
2255500	2256500	Why?
2256500	2257500	Because you're a complete asshole to everybody.
2257500	2260980	And then once you get done with the game, you find out that the whole objective of the
2260980	2264780	game is just being a complete asshole.
2264780	2268060	And that's that's just like the best part of that.
2268060	2270700	Apparently, it is still 15 bucks.
2270700	2274100	And this may be the reason I make an epic account.
2274100	2283780	Well, it's also on sale on on the switch, which I can play on my Mac.
2283780	2288420	But yeah, so it's fun to be an asshole to everybody in the town.
2288420	2291260	It's great that on the back of the box and it's great to be an asshole.
2291260	2295900	It's great because like you just like like the way the goose looks at people and stuff
2295900	2300300	and the way people like look frustrated at it and you're just like.
2300300	2306180	What the fuck you want, you know, honk exactly like what the fuck you want.
2306180	2310780	So basically, can we just download a new skin for the goose that is just Mr. Smoosh?
2310780	2315060	Because I feel like there's lots of other asshole animals that would work very well
2315060	2316060	in this game.
2316060	2317060	Yes.
2317060	2318060	It's an excellent game.
2318060	2319060	So I have a lot of fun.
2319060	2323180	It is a very long game, but it's fun because you can kind of do whatever you want in there,
2323180	2326940	especially when you get later on into the game and you have some of those new challenges
2326940	2330980	that open up once you finish the game that require you to use stuff that's kind of not
2330980	2332220	specific to a certain level.
2332220	2336340	You see it to kind of move around the whole map and it kind of changes things up.
2336340	2343460	Plus the last mission of it, it's like you'd be very stealthy because you have a, you know,
2343460	2344460	some spoil.
2344460	2345460	Yeah.
2345460	2348160	You're making lots of noise and everybody's out to look for you now.
2348160	2353440	So it's, it's kind of like a little Metal Gear Solid action going on there, but, um,
2353440	2358220	I had, I had quite a bit of fun playing the game, so I hope that there's more at some
2358220	2363560	point and, um, I really hope that, uh, I actually get around to finishing it.
2363560	2368360	I don't know what the very, very last objective is, but I know the speed running ones are
2368360	2369360	gonna be hard.
2369360	2370360	All right.
2370360	2371360	That's it.
2371360	2372360	That's it.
2372360	2373360	All right.
2373360	2374360	My gaming week.
2374360	2375360	Not as exciting as everyone else's.
2375360	2378760	I didn't really get around to doing new stuff cause I was still playing the good old, uh,
2378760	2381040	mobile games like Pokemon Go and Ingress.
2381040	2385140	There's going to be a very interesting week in Ingress because Scanner redacted the old
2385140	2386140	version of the app.
2386140	2390540	The one that many people are still clinging to after all this time, uh, closes tomorrow
2390540	2393480	and they, they say they really are pulling the plug on redacted tomorrow.
2393480	2394760	So you're going to have to use Ingress primes.
2394760	2398640	It's going to be very interesting to see because a lot of people are threatening to quit with
2398640	2399640	that.
2399640	2403120	So I don't, we'll see what happens if people really do quit or they just need to scratch
2403120	2405560	the itch of taking over their neighborhood park or what.
2405560	2408620	So I'll be very curious to see where that game is in about a week, especially with a
2408620	2411840	big event coming up right here in Sacramento on the 12th.
2411840	2414720	So that will only be playable in the new scanner, which is interesting.
2414720	2415720	Hmm.
2415720	2416720	Uh, so there's that.
2416720	2420040	Uh, otherwise I've been continuing on in classic wow.
2420040	2421040	Uh, believe it.
2421040	2422560	I'm still playing classic world of Warcraft.
2422560	2425680	My priest is up to level 20 or yeah, 21.
2425680	2428120	I did a dead minds run on Saturday.
2428120	2432640	Now here's the thing, like now if you play retail wow and you do the dead minds, you'll
2432640	2433640	get through it.
2433640	2437400	And like 15 minutes, like you just, you pull your face, pull everything.
2437400	2438400	It's super easy.
2438400	2439400	Right?
2439400	2440400	Oh my God.
2440400	2441400	Classic.
2441400	2442400	Wow.
2442400	2444400	Is a humble reminder of really how much the game has changed, especially when it comes
2444400	2448800	to like quality of life, things like having a fucking map to get you through the dungeon
2448800	2454440	or not having to wait for the priest to drink after every single fight because she's out
2454440	2457080	of manna, which was happening to me all the time.
2457080	2462560	It took us, I shit you not two hours to get through dead minds, but I remember back in
2462560	2464040	the, I remember running that.
2464040	2467880	Dead minds is the very first instance, like group thing you do in world of Warcraft.
2467880	2471680	And I remember years ago, back in the day, that's how long it took.
2471680	2472900	Like that was your evening.
2472900	2475020	That was your D and D campaign for the night.
2475020	2476480	We're going to go to the dead minds.
2476480	2477480	Who needs to raid?
2477480	2478480	I know.
2478480	2479480	Right.
2479480	2480480	So that was.
2480480	2481480	Yeah.
2481480	2482480	Anyhow.
2482480	2489840	Um, so, uh, yeah, uh, that was a nice little humble taste of what things used to be like
2489840	2492120	and well, but it's interesting because I was doing that.
2492120	2494480	And then I was like, maybe I should go back and play a little retail.
2494480	2495480	Wow.
2495480	2499360	But I still really love my other MMO final fantasy 14.
2499360	2504440	And I'm up to level, I don't know, like 75 or something like that.
2504440	2507880	So yeah.
2507880	2511060	I'm almost max level on two different job classes.
2511060	2512060	So that's really fun.
2512060	2513060	Yeah.
2513060	2517720	Otherwise that's, I haven't, Oh, I've been playing a little bit of Diablo three on switch.
2517720	2518840	Very random.
2518840	2523480	But do you know, I've never played a necromancer in Diablo three and I finally did on the switch
2523480	2526300	version because I never bought that PC upgrade.
2526300	2529520	I said I wasn't going to, because I didn't want them putting out a half-assed expansion
2529520	2530520	and I never did.
2530520	2532980	But then of course I like quadruple dipped on Diablo three.
2532980	2536140	So w wait for me to show him a lesson, huh?
2536140	2540440	So I've, I picked that up and, uh, uh, on switch, I had bought it a while ago, but I
2540440	2541440	was picking it up and playing it again.
2541440	2543440	I was like, I should do a necromancer for this season.
2543440	2548360	So it's like the first time I'm finally playing that class and a exploding corpses is fun.
2548920	2550240	That's what necromancers do.
2550240	2551240	Explode corpses.
2551240	2552240	All right.
2552240	2553240	Yay.
2553240	2554240	Yay.
2554240	2555240	So that's, that's pretty much my gaming week.
2555240	2557360	So we'll move on and get into some gaming news.
2557360	2558360	Some housekeeping.
2558360	2563640	Uh, I don't think we're going to be here pretty much every week, but we will not have a show
2563640	2564640	live.
2564640	2570160	I, I have to talk to my lovely co-hosts about taping something during the week in advance,
2570160	2577240	but we will not have a show live the week of October 20th.
2577240	2580960	And we won't have one live the week of November.
2580960	2582080	I think it's night.
2582080	2586640	Uh, those dates may not be exact, uh, reason why I had a work thing come up at the end
2586640	2587640	of October.
2587640	2588640	So I'm not going to be here.
2588640	2590600	Uh, and, uh, November is my trip to New York.
2590600	2592260	I'm going to go see Broadway plays.
2592260	2595720	So on when OLR would usually be on, I'm going to go see Moulin Rouge.
2595720	2597120	I'm really excited about it.
2597120	2601500	So anyway, uh, yeah, so we'll do some, uh, tapes in it because that worked really well
2601500	2605120	last time when we did our show, like earlier in the week and then we, um, just premiered
2605120	2606120	it on Sunday.
2606120	2611660	Something like that again for you guys, but then episode 800 is like when we're back.
2611660	2616640	So the next live shot really close to 20 November actually will be episode 800.
2616640	2617640	So that'll be fun.
2617640	2620760	So, all right, let's get into some gaming news for this week.
2620760	2622280	Loki, why don't you start us off?
2622280	2623280	All right.
2623280	2626840	So there was the whole PlayStation state of play event that they did online.
2626840	2629120	So you could definitely watch that.
2629120	2634960	Um, that is pretty much the last of us part two show because they had a, you know, basically
2634960	2638560	a big rundown talking about the last of us part two, which is going to be coming out
2638560	2645240	February 21st, 2020, um, along with that, some other stuff that is going to be coming
2645240	2650520	civilization six and, um, yeah, I love six, six, six.
2650520	2653080	So that's coming to the PlayStation four in November 22nd.
2653080	2656960	I guess I didn't realize it wasn't on play cause it came out on switch and I was like,
2656960	2657960	that's weird.
2657960	2661760	They're doing a console release of six, six, six, six was on switch and it was kind of
2661760	2662760	a big deal when it happened.
2662760	2666680	Cause I was like, they're putting six, six on consoles, but, uh, well they put it on
2666680	2668200	the iPad too, to be fair.
2668200	2669760	So I guess consoles make sense.
2669760	2674760	Um, so yeah, it's, it's on a switch and now PS4 and I was like, Oh yeah, I guess it would
2674760	2678600	make sense that if you put it on switch, you probably would just, you know, make it for
2678600	2679720	PlayStation four.
2679720	2680720	Where's the Xbox one version?
2680720	2682760	Cause that seems very likely that's going to happen too.
2682760	2683760	Who knows?
2683760	2690400	Coming to the pipeline, I guess, um, they release a demo for the remake of MediEvil.
2690400	2693480	So you can check that out now and if you play it, which Jason said he was going to
2693480	2694480	do in the intro.
2694480	2695480	Yes.
2695480	2698120	You can get a game for the, or a special item for the full game.
2698120	2704880	If you actually finish that with, um, before the game comes out next month, um, Death Stranding,
2704880	2710000	they announced a pro bundle that's coming out November 8th that has like a hand print
2710000	2715120	design on it that looks like I could have just taken my hand and put it in paint and
2715120	2718960	just went, I don't know why you've waiting this long to get a PlayStation four if this
2718960	2721280	game is of interest to you, but shoot yourself.
2721280	2722280	Maybe it's a collectible.
2722280	2723280	I don't know.
2723280	2724280	Sure.
2724280	2729160	Uh, they had this game called humanity, uh, which I heard people comparing it to intelligent
2729160	2735260	cube, but I didn't really see that other than, you know, kind of, it's weird though.
2735260	2738880	It's a weird looking game where they basically have like crowds of people that you have to
2738880	2742960	kind of shuffle through to certain areas and they could fight each other.
2742960	2746040	And I don't know, it's really weird, but I like those weird puzzle games.
2746040	2751520	So that's coming out in 2020, uh, there's a game called the rise, a simple story, which
2751520	2754960	is an adventure game, um, coming soon, LA noir.
2754960	2761000	The VR case files are coming out for PlayStation VR, which I'm surprised that hasn't come out
2761000	2762000	before.
2762000	2767360	Um, and then they also showed off some other stuff, uh, coming out to PlayStation VR, including
2767360	2770880	space channel five, kind of funky, uh, newsflash.
2770880	2771880	Can't wait.
2771880	2772880	Yep.
2772960	2779160	And after the fall and aspire one, and then let's see what else, uh, the PlayStation plus
2779160	2785360	lineup for October is going to be MLB, the show 19 and the last of us remastered to get
2785360	2788160	you all ready for last of us too.
2788160	2789160	Well, yeah.
2789160	2796480	Um, and then finally there was one Tom, which is a new game from the creators of Katamari
2796480	2802040	Damacy and he's unretired for not making playground anymore.
2802080	2804520	I have no fucking clue what you do in this game.
2804520	2805520	I watched the trailer.
2805520	2808040	I'm like, I don't know what you do in this game.
2808040	2812400	I looked like more like a nobody, nobody boy than Katamari.
2812400	2818920	Um, I did see flying golden poops and someone vomited the rainbows, so it already looks
2818920	2820960	like a game I'm going to check out.
2820960	2821960	Yeah, this is something I'm into.
2821960	2825600	I know dark soccer is going to play this, has to play because the Katamari Damacy, nobody,
2825600	2826600	nobody boy.
2826600	2827600	Those like two of your favorite games.
2828240	2833680	Well, nobody, nobody boy on iOS was, I didn't play it too much on the console.
2833680	2835160	Same, same.
2835160	2836400	It just looks weird.
2836400	2838640	And I dig that.
2838640	2841160	A comment on a what I'm in our chat room.
2841160	2845360	Uh, Dr Tuya says over at twitch TV slash vog network, though that what I'm game sounds
2845360	2847920	all about as crazy as Katamari in those games.
2847920	2848920	Nobody nobody boy.
2848920	2850240	And I think there was another one.
2850240	2855440	Um, I don't remember if there was another, there may have been, there were several Katamari
2855440	2856440	games.
2856560	2857560	Mobile game.
2857560	2859640	Nobody, nobody boy was the mobile game at first.
2859640	2861000	I thought there was another mobile.
2861000	2867240	There might've been, I forget a lot of people also think that a donut game is them.
2867240	2868800	No, that's totally different.
2868800	2869800	Yeah.
2869800	2872760	It's similar to Katamari, but except it's very linear.
2872760	2878400	So it's, it's not, I wouldn't say it's the same feel as Katamari cause there's no time
2878400	2880040	limits or anything like that.
2880040	2885240	Um, but I don't know, I was trying to see if there was another game that I'm missing
2885240	2886240	here.
2886280	2893720	Glitch was a game that he worked on in 2011 and then he had a tenure or tenure Wanya teens
2893720	2894720	and alphabet.
2894720	2898280	He was a designer on what is glitch.
2898280	2902720	Um, a comment quickly on the civ six issue from a metal mayhem in our chat over at twitch
2902720	2906880	TV slash vog network, metal mayhem says, may as well put civ six on consoles.
2906880	2909280	After all, not everyone is a PC gamer.
2909280	2910280	True.
2910280	2913120	And the civ games are great and should get out to as many people as possible.
2913120	2914120	So why not?
2914120	2915120	Yeah.
2915120	2916120	All right.
2916120	2919520	Well, if that's it for the, uh, what'd you think overall of PlayStation's a state of
2919520	2920520	play update?
2920520	2921520	I thought it was okay.
2921520	2922520	Yeah.
2922520	2927880	Apparently the creator of, uh, Katamari he's, um, he moved to San Francisco.
2927880	2928880	Yeah.
2928880	2929880	I heard that too.
2929880	2930880	Living there.
2930880	2931880	Yeah.
2931880	2932880	He lives in San Francisco.
2932880	2933880	Cool.
2933880	2934880	He has an open invite to come on the show.
2934880	2935880	Anytime.
2935880	2936880	We're only a two hour drive away.
2936880	2937880	Keita Takahashi.
2937880	2938880	Yeah.
2938880	2939880	All right.
2939880	2940880	Anyhow.
2940880	2941880	Uh, let's move on.
2941880	2946040	This is going to be seemed like really random as a follow up to a PlayStation state of play,
2946040	2950720	but this is like one of those, like, what the hell, what, what kind of romper room fuckery
2950720	2954240	is this going on in the gaming industry up in here on this day?
2954240	2955240	Okay.
2955240	2961800	So this has to do with the classic eighties gaming icon, Ms. Pac-Man, not to be confused
2961800	2967000	with Pac-Man specifically this drama centers around Ms. Pac-Man.
2967000	2972240	Now there's a nice little summary on what's going on here from Twitter users, Sarah S
2972240	2976360	sour tea, and I'm reading some of the summary there directly from her Twitter, where it
2976360	2982240	says, um, uh, in summary at games wanted Ms. Pac-Man.
2982240	2985720	So at games, at games, make some of those like flashback type content.
2985720	2989280	Didn't they do the old Genesis things too?
2989280	2990280	Maybe I think so.
2990280	2992400	So they, they, they do retro hardware type stuff.
2992400	2993760	Like that's like their bread and butter.
2993760	2994760	Okay.
2994760	2996880	At games wanted Ms. Pac-Man.
2996880	2999000	Didn't get it because it's complicated.
2999000	3005480	Went to make a deal with GCC who owns the rights to Ms. Pac-Man and claim they 100%
3005480	3007280	have those rights to distributors.
3007280	3008600	And maybe they do.
3008600	3009600	Maybe they don't.
3009600	3010600	An exciting story.
3010600	3011600	Yeah.
3011600	3015580	At games actually put out a press release through PR news wires.
3015580	3020880	So this was on September 26 where at game, it says at games cloud holdings, a leader
3020880	3024740	in interactive entertainment announced that it has acquired all the rights of general
3024740	3030880	computer corporation, GCC with respect to Ms. Pac-Man's under agreement between GCC
3030880	3032640	and Bandai Namco.
3032640	3037440	So here's, I guess what it sounds like is that at games wanted to go to Bandai Namco
3037440	3038440	to do it.
3038440	3039760	And they were like, no.
3039760	3045880	So they went to this GCC general computer corporation who in the text here in their,
3045880	3051440	in their own press release, Mac game says GCC developed in 1981, certain source code
3051440	3057440	characters, music, gameplay, and cartoons expressed in various media, including, but
3057440	3064080	not limited to read only memory ROM used in running Ms. Pac-Man and pack baby sold as
3064080	3069920	junior Pac-Man games in 1983, GCC entered into an agreement with the predecessor of
3069920	3075640	Bandai Namco with regard to Ms. Pac-Man, which was later amended in 2008 in an agreement
3075640	3080540	with Bandai Namco and the former shareholders of GCC who become the successors in interest
3080540	3082480	to GCC after its dissolution.
3082480	3084080	If it sounds messy, it's because it is.
3084080	3090240	So this is essentially says Bandai Namco said, no, they went to the company who helped make
3090240	3095440	the ROMs of the original game and did like coding and they got it from them.
3095440	3099040	And because, Oh, they have the license because what does at games do?
3099040	3101440	They do these retro game devices, right?
3101440	3106120	So if they get the rights through these retro coding, you know, the code and the actual
3106120	3110640	like physical, and I guess, you know, the intellectual code and stuff.
3110640	3115000	Now they're saying they own the rights, but hold on here.
3115000	3120320	The CEO of at games, I'm sorry if I mispronounced this name, Dr. Ping Kang Seung.
3120320	3121320	I hope I said that right.
3121320	3125920	I'm sorry if I didn't says as part of our ongoing initiative to be caretakers of important
3125920	3130660	cultural touchstones, we are privileged to gain these valuable rights pertaining to the
3130660	3134380	iconic Ms. Pac-Man arcade game.
3134380	3140140	Now you want to see, you want to hear how things get even messier.
3140140	3149120	From gamesindustry.biz on the 25th of September, plug and play game maker at games is facing
3149120	3151180	another partner in court.
3151180	3156280	In addition to a trademark infringement from Bandai Namco over Ms. Pac-Man, the company
3156280	3162240	is embroiled in a lawsuit from Walgreens, the U S pharmacy chains, Walgreens, Walgreens
3162240	3166480	filed suit against at games for breach of contract in August, saying it had a deal with
3166480	3171600	the game company that provided products on a guaranteed sale basis, meaning at games
3171600	3177120	would take any unsold units back and refund the chain, whatever it paid them.
3177120	3181880	In addition for an additional fee and shipping costs, Walgreens said it returned more than
3181880	3188600	66,500 units for which it had paid between $15 and $38.
3188600	3190760	But at games refused to make payment.
3190760	3196760	As a result, Walgreens, Walgreens claimed it owed nearly 1.62 million from the company.
3196760	3199840	Again, that story from gamesindustry.biz, if you want to see some of the quotes.
3199840	3203640	Is this going to end up where Walgreens owns Ms. Pac-Man at some point?
3203640	3204640	Is this where we're in?
3204640	3205640	Is this where it's going?
3205640	3207400	I don't know, but this is weird.
3207400	3210800	It's certainly like, it seems I am inferring.
3210800	3216280	I'm not saying this as fact, but in my opinion, and my opinion does not represent those of
3216280	3218320	VOG Network or my co-hosts.
3218320	3221080	It sounds like this at games company is a little bit shady.
3221080	3225880	It just, I'm getting that impression from the fact that they are, mommy said no, so
3225880	3230720	we're going to go ask daddy and this whole, they're not paying Walgreens for this.
3230720	3232440	They made some weird deal with Walgreens.
3232440	3234160	I don't know guys.
3234160	3239480	It's allegedly sounds crazy.
3239480	3243120	Dark Titsy in chat says, yeah, this whole thing is nuts.
3243120	3245880	Snuck in futs.
3245880	3246880	Exactly.
3246880	3248960	Which is a good beer by the way.
3248960	3249960	Yeah.
3249960	3253880	And by the way, there's another Twitter thread from user Sean Musgrave, who's talking about
3253880	3260260	the real ass drama going on with at games and the way Sean puts it on Twitter.
3260260	3263640	They've been pestering Namco for ages for the Ms. Pac-Man license and Namco's turned
3263680	3269240	them down because of the complicated royalty structures and ownership of that game.
3269240	3273240	That's interesting to point out too, is that a character like Ms. Pac-Man, it isn't so
3273240	3274240	cut and dry.
3274240	3278760	We're like Namco Bando owns this because it does get complicated.
3278760	3279760	Doesn't it?
3279760	3284760	Because didn't like Midway or something published that in the U S at one point, like it, it
3284760	3290640	gets weird when it comes to Ms. Pac-Man because in the eighties video games were just kind
3290640	3292120	of like done differently.
3292120	3294280	I don't know how else to explain it.
3294280	3297960	And so all the deals that were in place were sometimes very straight.
3297960	3299760	Let's just say what it was.
3299760	3303460	The games industry was on a lot of cocaine in the 1980s.
3303460	3305760	And I mean a fucking lot of cocaine.
3305760	3306760	Okay.
3306760	3310760	If you watch any documentary about how your favorite Atari Atari games in the 1980s were
3310760	3313520	made, cocaine was probably involved.
3313520	3314880	Winners don't use drugs.
3314880	3315880	Remember that.
3315880	3320120	However, remember the video game industry crashed under the weight of all that cocaine.
3320120	3322440	So right.
3322440	3323440	Am I wrong?
3323440	3324440	Did I tell any lies?
3324440	3325440	No, I did not.
3325440	3334400	So a lot of these, a lot of these deals, cocaine infused deals are really, really strange.
3334400	3341600	And that's how 5,000 people claim ownership to Ms. Pac-Man anyway, Namco is in discussions
3341600	3345220	with GCC who developed Ms. Pac-Man trying to buy them out.
3345220	3349080	So they'd be the full owners of Ms. Pac-Man full stop, but at games went around Namco's
3349080	3352040	back and was directly negotiated with GCC.
3352040	3355960	Namco confronted at games about this and they deny it.
3355960	3360080	Namco is unable to verify if at games has or hasn't bought the rights from GCC.
3360080	3363200	That was two days before the at games press release when that tweet was written.
3363200	3367680	So I think we know if at games is saying there now.
3367680	3370680	So this is, but here's the thing, and this is why I bring this up.
3370680	3373140	Like sure, it's drama and it's LOL.
3373140	3374200	This is crazy.
3374200	3375200	And what the fuck?
3375320	3379480	But here's the reality, boys and girls.
3379480	3385020	How are we going to see Ms. Pac-Man in a retro collection ever again?
3385020	3387440	Because of these damn rights issues.
3387440	3393120	And I'll point out, I know I was talking about that Mortal Kombat machine an awful lot last
3393120	3397360	week, the little mini game, which is at games that do these.
3397360	3399240	This is not at games that do these, basic fun.
3399240	3401360	So it's a completely different company that does these.
3401400	3406760	But I didn't show off this one because I kind of whatevered it last week.
3406760	3409440	But there's also a regular Pac-Man machine, right?
3409440	3413840	There's a regular Pac-Man machine that they put out as well with this full color screen,
3413840	3416880	fancy, fancy, all this stuff that they have, right?
3416880	3419480	Is that the company?
3419480	3420480	No.
3420480	3427280	But Ms. Pac-Man is there too.
3427280	3430380	I even forgot they did this one, but I don't think this one is as good.
3430380	3433580	And I think, oh, these guys, I'm trying to see if they have a relationship.
3433580	3434580	Yes.
3434580	3438060	Ms. Pac-Man Bandai Namco Entertainment, Inc.
3438060	3441200	So they got the agreements for that one.
3441200	3443740	But it's interesting that that company could do it.
3443740	3445860	And it was easy.
3445860	3449700	But at games is having such crazy difficulty with it.
3449700	3452500	It's weird.
3452500	3459260	Anyway, looking in chat, Tiger Class says, what about that arcade one up TMNT arcade
3459260	3460260	cabinet?
3461140	3463540	You must have jumped through many hoops to be able to put that out.
3463540	3468580	Yeah, well, I mean, the Ninja Turtles arcade game, when it came out on Xbox 360, that was
3468580	3471940	a pleasant surprise because the rights were very complicated.
3471940	3473420	Rights have a way of working themselves out.
3473420	3479500	And also, also the Avengers and Capcom, or didn't they have like the whole like Avengers
3479500	3484300	cabinet and Marvel versus Capcom?
3484300	3486380	It was X-Men Street Fighter, was it?
3486380	3488500	I don't remember what they had, but they had one.
3488500	3492740	They had like a bunch of those in there, like Marvel stuff.
3492740	3495300	So obviously, I imagine the rights were complicated for that, too.
3495300	3500300	The point is rights issues will screw up all of the games that you loved in the past because
3500300	3502740	contracts were signed under the influence of drugs.
3502740	3503740	All right.
3503740	3504740	That's my point.
3504740	3509460	That means that they technically shouldn't be binding because anything signed under influence
3509460	3511340	can be considered a non-binding contract.
3511340	3512340	OK.
3512340	3516260	Guess where I can have a rights free utopia out there.
3516260	3518460	It's called the Internet.
3518460	3519460	Thank you.
3519460	3520460	Piracy.
3520460	3521460	I may also be...
3521460	3522460	That's what art thieves can do.
3522460	3523700	Kiss my ass.
3523700	3530100	I may also be slightly exaggerating a thing or two about the 1980s game industry.
3530100	3532680	Just a little bit.
3532680	3533680	Let's move on.
3533680	3537300	Speaking, speaking of things from the past, blast from the past, right, Dark Sakura?
3537300	3538300	Yeah.
3538300	3541740	You know me and prototypes and retro shit.
3541740	3547700	So the Nintendo 64, of course, had quite the unique controller, right?
3547940	3555700	Still to this day, like, it hurts if you fall on it just the right way where the bottom
3555700	3560940	part pokes into your ribs and then the cat looks at you while you're rolling around in
3560940	3561940	pain.
3561940	3563860	Sorry, that was a very recent experience.
3563860	3569900	So anyway, when this was still known, when the Nintendo 64 was still known as the Ultra
3569900	3575100	64, there were, of course, prototype controllers that were going around.
3575100	3576820	The controller didn't have like a name.
3576820	3579780	It was just a controller.
3579780	3589500	And so a video game preservationist called Shane Batty actually found a prototype controller
3589500	3593300	and shared pictures of it on a Twitter thread.
3593300	3596180	Which I actually prepared that for our Twitch folks tonight.
3596180	3597180	Look at you.
3597180	3598180	Look at me up in my game.
3598180	3599180	Gold star.
3599180	3602500	Gold star, Rob.
3602500	3609220	But as you can see in it, the prototype and the final one, a little bit bigger, you know,
3609220	3610380	a little bit different.
3610380	3614380	That thumb pad, you see how much bigger that is on there?
3614380	3615820	Oh yeah.
3615820	3624580	You know, and people were saying actually that it's a lot more comfortable to use.
3624580	3630700	And don't know why they opted out of it, but you know, there's actually a picture of that
3630700	3633460	thumb pad removed from it.
3633460	3634460	Don't think I captured that.
3634460	3635460	Hold on.
3635460	3639540	Um, because I will copy the image and paste it in chat.
3639540	3645660	But for our Twitch or for our podcast people, that's not going to help, sadly.
3645660	3646660	Yeah.
3646660	3653500	But, um, but at any rate, um, uh, the, uh, it's just got like a different, hold on it.
3653500	3659260	When you look at the two side by side, it actually looks to me like the controller is
3659260	3665500	a little bit narrower, but it seems to me that it's a little bit more comfortable.
3665500	3671140	It did keep a lot of the button design, you know, as far as the layout for the buttons,
3671140	3676580	but I think that the, normally the green and blue button, which are massive, were a little
3676580	3679660	bit smaller in this prototype and all like sort of flat.
3679660	3687500	They seemed like the six buttons are more in line where the, um, the controller that
3687500	3691880	we got has those three, sorry, the four yellow buttons and sort of a diamond.
3691880	3696940	They don't quite line up the, these line up more like a six button control.
3696940	3697940	Yeah.
3697940	3698940	Yeah.
3698940	3699940	It looks like a six button configuration in this.
3699940	3702100	I mean, honestly, I think it's really comfortable.
3702100	3708700	I would love for this dude to like market that design or whoever now can market that
3708700	3715880	design so that, you know, we would be able to, um, uh, that we would be able to use something
3715880	3718160	like that for our, our old machines.
3718160	3722580	It's weird that it's taken this long for a prototype like that to unveil itself.
3722580	3724080	You know, it's been years, right?
3724080	3729120	If you want to look in the chat right now, Rob, there's a picture I, um, I put posted
3729120	3730120	in there.
3730120	3733020	That's the thumb pad pulled out.
3733020	3737140	And I think that, um, I linked it in there for everyone to see, but it's just interesting
3737140	3743400	how just, just a small little unit on here, but it, it has like a deeper recess as well
3743400	3749920	instead of the more, uh, what's the word I'm thinking of, uh, convex shape.
3749920	3753680	It's a little bit more concave.
3753680	3756040	So do you think this was the better controller?
3756040	3759220	Would you like to be able to play your N64 games with this controller or?
3759220	3762280	I'd much rather.
3762280	3764860	Maybe maybe a third party will be controlled.
3764860	3765860	Probably not.
3765860	3769320	Cause this console is how old at this point, I guess it's a, it's definitely an artifact
3769320	3770560	of many, many years ago.
3770560	3776120	No, no, just because that may be the case, you know, all it takes for them to do is release
3776120	3780960	a N64 classic edition and there'll be a market for those controllers again.
3780960	3781960	Hmm.
3781960	3782960	Fair point.
3782960	3783960	You're right.
3783960	3787800	Nintendo might get on the classic bandwagon, uh, once again at some point.
3787800	3790760	So yeah, shenanigans will ensue.
3790760	3795040	Well, let's move on to a more classic things that Nintendo should get on the bandwagon
3795040	3796040	for.
3796040	3797040	Right?
3797040	3798040	Uh, yeah.
3798040	3799040	They're going to get on the bandwagon for cease and desist.
3799040	3800040	No.
3800520	3801720	Um, so this is actually kind of cool.
3801720	3808080	So this is a fan project being done by this animator, um, Jesus Lopez, who's actually
3808080	3811800	animated on several different, uh, games that are out there.
3811800	3817560	The Simpsons tapped out, DuckTales remastered, Shante, Half Genie Hero, Silent Hill.
3817560	3824440	Um, and so he has this fan project that he's working on that is a, a Super Mario Super
3824440	3826720	Show Mario game.
3826880	3832560	And so he's basically animating Mario in a game in the style of the Super Mario Super
3832560	3833560	Show.
3833560	3839560	So his first world that he's creating is Pastaland, which is from the first episode of the show.
3839560	3841280	And it's pretty, it looks so good.
3841280	3842280	We're showing a little bit.
3842280	3844460	This is from the developer's YouTube channel.
3844460	3848000	So he's like kind of filming his computer screen, so you can't even really get the full
3848000	3851520	realness of how much these colors pop and things, but it looks really good.
3851520	3853680	And it looks like a lawsuit will be on his desk.
3853760	3856920	Well, that's not necessarily true because it's really sad because this looks great.
3856920	3859720	He's been working on this for three years as like a family project.
3859720	3864580	So his, his son, um, I think his 10 year old son is coding the game.
3864580	3865960	He's doing the animation.
3865960	3872200	And then he said his daughter is working on like, uh, some other like animation stuff
3872200	3874880	or like kind of working with him on the animation stuff.
3874880	3876240	So, but it's pretty awesome.
3876240	3881680	Like he's recreated the first level, a level one, one from Super Mario Brothers in just,
3881680	3882680	that's not really level one.
3882680	3884800	It's sort of based on its fundamentals.
3884800	3885800	Yeah.
3885800	3886800	Yeah.
3886800	3891160	So he's sort of based it on a level one, one and he's got like just all sorts of animations
3891160	3892160	in there.
3892160	3894280	The sound effects are from like the actual show.
3894280	3898480	Even in other videos he has out there, there's like kind of this behind the scenes thing
3898480	3905520	that was done by a YouTuber swanky box who actually showed off some of the, um, animations
3905520	3906520	for the enemies.
3906520	3911040	So like they're from the show and animated really nice.
3911040	3914240	And he's talking about some of the things that he wants to work on.
3914240	3917080	He's got other characters like Princess Peach in there already.
3917080	3920920	And he has a mock-up of what Wario would look like in the art style.
3920920	3922840	So pretty cool.
3922840	3924680	So how long before Nintendo shuts it down?
3924680	3926280	Because it's on all the gaming blogs now.
3926280	3931560	So I don't know if he's, I don't know if he's necessarily planning on releasing it.
3931560	3935980	I think it's more of right now, just a project that's kind of for fun.
3935980	3939640	So I don't know if they would send him a cease and desist yet until he tries to like send
3939640	3941960	it, release it out on the internet.
3941960	3945560	Technically they could go after the YouTube.
3945560	3950040	I know you don't want to hear it, but technically they could go, but yes, I completely understand
3950040	3954120	if you have a fan game like that, that you're really interested on putting out there and
3954120	3955120	I get it.
3955120	3959240	If you spend a lot of time on it, you don't say anything until released, just release
3959240	3960240	it.
3960240	3961360	Then you say he's given it to somebody cause you're right.
3961360	3964360	There was the other YouTube that actually was doing like the game.
3964360	3968120	And the only reason I didn't use that for the stuff we were talking about talking to
3968120	3969320	because, well, it's not just the talking.
3969320	3973040	I mean, I can delete the audio, which is what I did, but then they also pop up all these
3973040	3974040	other game boxes.
3974040	3978080	There's a bunch of other bullshit that the YouTuber puts over it besides just the game,
3978080	3979320	which I get it.
3979320	3983720	It's his program or whatever, but yeah, so I didn't show that, but you, you know, you
3983720	3984720	can visit other YouTube.
3984720	3986040	You can actually see the game in motion.
3986040	3991240	But my point is it's not just on this guy's computer cause he sent it to this other YouTuber.
3991240	3995240	Well I know it says at least the graphics, I don't know being distributed privately.
3995240	3999920	So I don't know if they would do anything until it's like intent on releasing it near
3999920	4000920	right now.
4000920	4003280	It's just kind of, you know, fan thing, but it looks awesome.
4003280	4005160	I would love to see a game like that.
4005160	4008760	Well, we'll see if we get through tomorrow without the lawyers attacking, we might be
4008760	4009760	okay.
4009760	4010760	We might be in the clear.
4010760	4011760	Yeah.
4011760	4012760	So stay tuned.
4012760	4013760	Cause maybe next week we'll have a follow up.
4013760	4014760	You're going to keep an eye out.
4014760	4016080	See if this game is still around next week.
4016080	4017080	Sure.
4017080	4018080	Why not?
4018080	4019080	Sounds good.
4019080	4020080	All right.
4020080	4021320	Well let's move on and talk about Beat Saber.
4021320	4025200	Oh, that's a game I need to get back into playing cause, uh, yeah, clearly I was
4025240	4027440	I was a little skinnier when I was playing a Beat Saber a little bit.
4027440	4033080	I as well need to play that because, um, I played it once at that, um, Sacramento thing
4033080	4035360	and I was like, dude, I need to get this.
4035360	4038680	Well, there might be some more incentive for you to check out Beat Saber.
4038680	4043740	There is a brand new 360 degree mode coming in December.
4043740	4046700	So now the notes are coming at you from all directions.
4046700	4048560	Well that's a good way to get tangled up in the cords.
4048560	4049560	Right?
4049560	4050560	I don't know.
4050560	4051560	I don't know if that would work for me.
4051600	4055080	I don't know if it was on like the Oculus Go or something like that where it's only
4055080	4059580	the wireless ones, but like, ah, I don't know.
4059580	4060580	That sounds like a problem.
4060580	4061580	Yeah, it might.
4061580	4064400	Well, I mean, and again, I don't, I don't know how maybe the note charts are going to
4064400	4068280	be different on PlayStation four and maybe even though they say it's 360 degrees, like
4068280	4071200	180 or something, it's really only like 180 or something like that.
4071200	4074760	I don't know because I haven't been able to play one of these stages myself.
4074760	4076120	How would you be able to watch behind you?
4076120	4077120	I don't know.
4077120	4079200	That doesn't sound like it'd be fun.
4079200	4082960	I'm trying to see if they say it's like only 180 degrees or what have you.
4082960	4083960	Yeah.
4083960	4087320	It allows beat maps to send lines of blocks at you from arbitrary directions as the song
4087320	4088320	plays out.
4088320	4091420	Oh, so it's not just like spinning around behind you, but the note arrows can come in
4091420	4092680	from different directions too.
4092680	4094700	So I think that's what they mean by 360 degrees.
4094700	4098580	It's not just coming at you from here, but it could be up, left, right.
4098580	4100760	They could be coming from all sorts of different directions.
4100760	4101760	Yeah.
4101760	4106760	I mean, I like the, it's a neat gimmick, but yeah, I know.
4106760	4107760	I don't know.
4107760	4108760	All right.
4109040	4114800	Um, I probably won't actually play that mode just because there, why, why mess with perfection?
4114800	4116620	The original mode is good.
4116620	4121300	I know, but you ever, do you ever watch some people play Beat Saber on Twitch or whatever?
4121300	4126140	Like some people are like crazy good at Beat Saber and like some of the songs they're playing
4126140	4129260	are just, I don't even know if I would say it's like good at Beat Saber.
4129260	4134200	It's just like these mods and these custom things are just, they're just fast.
4134200	4138560	They're like lightning fast and it's, it's weird to watch almost.
4138560	4142360	But I like, I like the note charts for some of like the original, like Beat Saber stuff
4142360	4144980	that like the, the crab rave song.
4144980	4150520	You do like some fun little, like the way you like do the notes is fun.
4150520	4152420	That's why I don't always like, it's the same thing with DDR.
4152420	4155900	I don't always like the hell mode steps, so I don't always like all the hell modes.
4155900	4160320	Modern DDR where everything's hell mode steps almost.
4160320	4164260	Anyway, uh, also coming to Beat Saber, it doesn't end there.
4164260	4170500	It's not just the 360 degree mode, but there is a brand new music pack coming out next week.
4170500	4175360	So previously we had the music pack from Imagine Dragons.
4175360	4179300	So now we're going to be getting a music pack from Panic at the Disco is going to be the
4179300	4181420	next music pack that's going to be in the game.
4181420	4187520	So not techno or even like drum and bass or wow, wow, wow type of stuff.
4187520	4188940	Like it's kind of different.
4188940	4191500	It's like rock music that they keep putting in there.
4191500	4192500	So I don't know.
4192500	4193720	I'm kind of into it though.
4193720	4198400	I liked the Imagine Dragons stuff more than I thought I would.
4198400	4203120	So maybe I'll like the Panic at the Disco stuff a little better as well.
4203120	4210640	So, um, any, uh, Oh, I was going to say you've, uh, you've got your DDR machine at home.
4210640	4212560	Have you been playing music games at home lately?
4212560	4219340	I have not, um, I actually started taking it apart a little bit, uh, last yesterday
4219340	4224760	because I have, I've been sitting on a lot of parts that converted over to step mania
4224760	4226900	and also other things.
4226900	4231460	So I was looking at, uh, cause on this Facebook group that I follow, they have like a lot
4231460	4233980	of people that talk about doing different conversions for things.
4233980	4237720	And one of the conversions I was going to do is removing the fluorescent lights that
4237720	4242840	are in the actual pads themselves and replacing them with LEDs.
4242840	4244860	And so I have all the LEDs to do that.
4245060	4250020	Um, I just needed to see because I bought the ones that they recommended, but I guess
4250020	4253520	I don't know how you exactly plug all that together.
4253520	4258280	And so I was looking at what came with the LEDs and trying to see how that actually hooks
4258280	4259620	up to the board.
4259620	4263060	And I think I might just have to like solder stuff together.
4263060	4264620	Um, I don't know.
4264620	4268420	I don't know if it like actually replaces the whole inverter board that's in there and
4268420	4270980	just, I just plug it straight into that.
4270980	4274340	Um, so that's why I was trying to determine yesterday I was looking at, I was like, Oh,
4274340	4278300	and I want to kind of see how dirty these have gotten since I've been playing.
4278300	4279300	Actually not very dirty.
4279300	4280300	So that, that's good.
4280300	4282100	I still haven't cleaned my right side pads though.
4282100	4286860	I'm afraid to look at what's in there, but, um, but yeah, I have been going through that.
4286860	4290060	I was starting to try and work on cleaning my garage now that summer's over and we're
4290060	4292220	getting back into cooler temperatures.
4292220	4294100	I do want to play more DDR again.
4294100	4302160	I do want to get the conversion stuff done just, just so I can put the system into, um,
4302160	4303160	in there.
4303200	4306440	And like, I know at one point I just like talking about, Oh, I'm gonna make this new,
4306440	4308280	you know, step me a theme it's going to be awesome.
4308280	4311840	I just MVP, just put the minimal viable product in there.
4311840	4316600	Just get a theme on there that's not atrocious and just load it full songs and just play
4316600	4317600	it.
4317600	4318600	I just don't really care at this point.
4318600	4320720	I just want it playable.
4320720	4325040	I can do that stuff later at some other date, but, um, that's what I wanted to do.
4325040	4329360	So I'm going to try to get something in there so that I can actually play some different
4329360	4331160	songs and do all that.
4331160	4334320	Have you been tempted at all to add to Loki's arcade?
4334320	4338240	Let's let's assume that wife agro was not an issue.
4338240	4341600	Have you been tempted to add to Loki's arcade in the garage?
4341600	4347120	No, not at all because, um, I have to, well, I still have to fix the monitor on my actual
4347120	4350880	arcade cabinet I have out there cause it's not working right now.
4350880	4355400	Um, ever since they moved it in the garage, I don't know if something just, I think the
4355400	4361320	cap, uh, the caps on the board burned out and so I need to have like a TV repairman
4361320	4362840	come and fix it.
4362840	4367160	I would love to just replace it with an LCD panel, which would be nice, but no one makes
4367160	4369800	four by three LCD panels anymore.
4369800	4370800	So yeah.
4370800	4373240	Or you'd probably have to get like a real specialized thing online.
4373240	4374240	Yeah.
4374240	4379240	I was like, even like the actual like, uh, monitors that go in there are super expensive
4379240	4380460	and they don't sell them anymore.
4380460	4382520	Like good luck finding CRT monitors.
4382520	4387400	So I may just have to do something horrible, drastic, drastic.
4387400	4388400	Yeah.
4388400	4391880	I was like, Oh, can I find like an old LCD screen?
4391880	4395880	Like maybe buy like, can I have someone custom make an LCD panel for that?
4395880	4399460	Like I don't even know like how you would go about that.
4399460	4405320	So, um, right now it's sitting broken, but I would love to get that fixed up again.
4405320	4410480	Um, uh, originally the, the agreement was I would sell that when I got a DDR machine.
4410480	4416840	Um, but yeah, whatever, so there was an agreement that you were going to sell something before
4416840	4421680	getting the DDR machine, but you didn't follow through on that.
4421680	4422680	That's fine.
4422680	4423680	All right.
4423680	4428140	And so like, I would like to do that, but like, um, yeah, I just need to, I really want
4428140	4430080	to get like step man, you put on there cause I think that'd be fun.
4430080	4434120	Now I have all the lighting stuff now for two and a site like the actual boards that
4434120	4435120	control the lighting.
4435120	4441240	Um, I just need to see if it all works together and then figure out how to configure all that.
4441240	4444960	And I thought about like the main stuff I know, and I actually downloaded like a big
4444960	4450640	old zip file that someone put together for like doing a hyper spin with maim DDR and
4450640	4451640	stuff like that.
4451640	4453600	But I don't know if I'm going to do that.
4453600	4456000	I just think step mania and we'll just call it a day.
4456000	4457000	All right.
4457000	4458560	Well that was quite the tangent, but that's okay.
4458560	4462160	Cause we haven't had an update on Loki's arcade in a while, but I understand it is summertime
4462160	4463160	as well.
4463200	4466360	You've got, uh, you haven't been able to be out there in the garage cause when it's a
4466360	4467960	hundred degrees, DDR is no fun.
4467960	4468960	Yes.
4468960	4471400	It's, it's nicer now, but let's move on to our next story.
4471400	4474360	Uh, Dar Sakura has a Minecraft related thing for us.
4474360	4475360	I do.
4475360	4484280	Um, actually it is not just Minecraft, Minecraft is getting a board game.
4484280	4487180	Like have you noticed, like, have you gone through the board game section at target and
4487180	4489400	just looked like all the shenanigans they have there?
4489400	4490400	Yeah.
4490400	4491840	It's all like poop and pee jokes.
4491840	4493600	I feel like a trapper keeper game.
4493600	4495480	Do you know how many games there are?
4495480	4496480	It's so gross.
4496480	4502600	It comes in a mini trapper kids are obsessed and there's like, like, like other like eighties
4502600	4503880	themed light games.
4503880	4507200	But I think it's cool that Minecraft is getting a board game.
4507200	4508560	It's called builders and biomes.
4508560	4511840	It's a tabletop game that uses different elements.
4511840	4515280	So you're, you explore your overworld and you build your structures and you mind your
4515280	4516280	resources on this.
4516280	4522520	Sounds like a little monopoly ish, but then you have to, uh, create these connection connected
4522520	4528780	biomes of forests and mountains and Tundra and all this on your player board.
4528780	4533520	So you've got also got endermen and creepers that show up in there that you have to defeat
4533520	4535320	with weapons that you collect through the game.
4535320	4537480	It just looks like it's kind of cool.
4537480	4541680	Um, where's the part where Loki yells, I'm a creeper kaboom and flips the board over
4541680	4548320	flip board games over board games are expensive now.
4548320	4553640	Um, but it's as being a released by Ravens burger, which is an interesting name.
4553640	4554640	Okay.
4554640	4557980	They've also done a game called villainous that uses Disney villains and they've done
4557980	4564600	a Jaws one and the universal monsters game, but this one, it just looks kinda kinda cool.
4564600	4565600	I don't know.
4565600	4568840	Maybe we could get folks together and play a little bit of this.
4568840	4571040	So is it an $80 board games?
4571040	4572040	You're right.
4572040	4573040	Board games are expensive.
4573040	4574040	Let me look at the preorder.
4574040	4576400	Then again, video games are 60 bucks.
4576400	4581080	So preorder says 40 bucks.
4581080	4582080	Okay.
4582080	4583080	39 99.
4583080	4584080	That's a fair amount.
4584080	4585360	There's probably a lot of loose pieces of the game like that.
4585360	4586360	Yeah.
4586360	4588560	It looks like a lot of stuff that interconnects.
4588560	4593280	All right, well moving on with more Minecraft Loki.
4593280	4594280	Yes.
4594280	4599720	Um, so there was a lot of stuff that came out of the, uh, Minecraft, um, or mine con
4599720	4602280	live, which was this Saturday.
4602280	4607480	So, um, some of the things that they talked about there, one of which is Minecraft earth,
4607480	4610960	the game I've been looking forward to, um, it is going to be coming out.
4610960	4611960	That's there.
4611960	4616400	Like everybody says it's their answer to Pokemon go, but it, it, it, it's just an AR Pokemon
4616400	4617400	go.
4617400	4618400	It's just like Minecraft.
4618400	4619400	Yeah.
4619400	4620400	Minecraft game.
4620400	4621400	Yeah.
4621400	4623760	So it's a Minecraft AR game and that's going to be coming out in the next couple of weeks.
4623760	4631880	So looking forward to that, um, I've already preregistered in, um, uh, Android for that.
4631880	4634600	So I will have to check it out.
4634600	4636240	Um, some other stuff they announced.
4636240	4639440	So they had a vote on which biomes they're going to add to the game.
4639440	4643400	So there was a brand new biome that's going to be enhanced mountains.
4643400	4648400	That's going to have, um, you know, goats and they're going to be adding some more snow
4648400	4649400	and stuff like that.
4649400	4650800	And they're going to be really tall.
4650800	4651800	So that's pretty cool.
4651840	4656000	Uh, they showed off some more stuff for Minecraft dungeons that looked pretty cool.
4656000	4660400	They announced that next year is going to be a Minecraft festival from September 25th
4660400	4664260	to 27th in Orlando, Florida.
4664260	4669640	And they said it's going to be a three day celebration with all things Minecraft and
4669640	4670640	what else?
4670640	4676800	Uh, they talked about an update to the Java version with honey blocks and bees, not the
4676800	4677800	bees.
4677800	4678800	So you can get bees.
4679800	4684160	You can get attacked by bees now in Minecraft, they are neutral mobs, so don't attack them.
4684160	4685160	They won't attack you.
4685160	4686160	Okay.
4686160	4691040	Uh, they talked about some creator tools so you can do different scripting, um, and they
4691040	4696920	have like the editor stick that you can use to edit things, rotate stuff around, um, make
4696920	4699180	full crops and stuff like that.
4699180	4703960	So it sounds a little bit like, um, some of the other tools that they have and like world
4703960	4711880	edit or whatever, uh, realms plus that allows you to add, they've expanded the realms for
4711880	4717480	the same price and you still, I guess, get access to 10 player realms and then they have
4717480	4722320	50 pieces of content from the mark Minecraft marketplace at no extra cost.
4722320	4726340	They have a character creator and um, bedrock capes.
4726340	4732040	It's like a windows 10, xbox one, android app that you can create your own characters
4732040	4734720	and import them into Minecraft.
4734720	4737860	They did another update, which they have a lot of new biomes.
4737860	4744000	So soul sand valley, nether wart fortress red, nether wart forest blue, uh, they have
4744000	4750000	piglin beast, which is a new mob that appears in the nether and they've renamed the zombie
4750000	4756240	pigmen to zombified piglins and piglins are going to be these, um, kind of like caveman
4756240	4762240	characters that are pigs, I guess, cave pig characters and they will be hostile and then
4762240	4766880	new block, which is a target block that if you shoot with an arrow, it powers redstone.
4766880	4768840	So they're not doing Minecraft too.
4768840	4774200	They are continuing to make these big upgrades to the original Minecraft, but no 4k graphics.
4774200	4779840	Uh, well remember they do have the ray tracing, you know, ray tracing so you can get that.
4779840	4787720	But yeah, you have to have a beefed up computer to do that unless you use mods, right?
4787720	4788720	All right.
4788720	4792640	Well, uh, going from a Minecraft to another game that's a couple of years old, but people
4792640	4797240	are still really into it and that is Overwatch, but Overwatch going to be getting some major
4797240	4800520	character kind of rebalancing and character shuffling around.
4800520	4803560	There's no new characters or new stages or things being announced, but there is still
4803560	4809120	a very large patch that just went to the PTR or public test realm, which is for PC players
4809120	4811800	of the game because they don't have PTR on the consoles.
4811800	4815520	But September 24th saw a pretty big PTR patch be delivered.
4815520	4820060	And one could kind of also see that this is in advance of the switch version coming out.
4820060	4823340	So it's almost like they're doing some rebalancing before the switch version is out.
4823340	4827960	They're doing some pretty big juggling with heroes like D.Va where the defense matrix
4827960	4828960	is going to be changing.
4828960	4834640	The regeneration rate is increased and the delay before the regeneration begins is lowered.
4834640	4838000	And many characters are getting changes.
4838000	4842680	Sigma is getting quite a few changes as well, which is like Sigma is the one new character
4842680	4844920	in the game that I just can't get into.
4844920	4849640	Like I like Batiste, I like Orisa, I like a lot of the other characters they've added.
4849640	4850640	I don't really care for Sigma.
4850640	4851760	I don't get them.
4851760	4856760	But maybe these reshufflings will help a little bit because yeah, it sounds like they're making
4856760	4859220	them less powered, which this always happens.
4859220	4862280	They roll out a new hero, then they got to nerf them.
4862280	4866560	So Kinetic Grasp no longer blocks certain moves.
4866560	4870320	The experimental barrier regeneration rate was reduced and there's a cool down after
4870320	4871780	recalling the barrier.
4871780	4874520	So they're changing some things a little bit.
4874520	4876760	But like Winston, they're buffing up a little bit.
4876760	4882360	The duration of the barrier projector is increasing and the health is increasing as well.
4882360	4885840	Lucio's crossfade speed boost is going to get stronger.
4885840	4890100	And that sounds like that's going to be a pretty big change for Lucio.
4890100	4893540	So yeah, a lot of changes going to some of your favorite characters there.
4893540	4896980	Symmetra, again, getting a bunch of changes.
4896980	4899860	Photon barriers duration is being reduced.
4899860	4904540	Sentry turrets, their overall output damage is being reduced.
4904540	4909320	And yeah, a photon projector, if you're getting hit by it, you'll be able to hear it more.
4909320	4914720	So yeah, lots of heroes in Overwatch getting changes, but it also just goes to show, man,
4914720	4916780	this game just keeps on going.
4916780	4917780	Yeah.
4917780	4918780	Yeah.
4918780	4919780	Overwatch is still...
4919980	4923780	I didn't really play it this week, but just within the past couple of weeks, I will bring
4923780	4925700	up Overwatch and randomly play Quick Play.
4925700	4930580	I really liked the new role queuing because I like going in there knowing I'll get to
4930580	4934620	play a healer and there's a pretty good chance I can play Moira because usually I want to
4934620	4935620	play Moira.
4935620	4938580	But even if the other healer beats me to it, I like to do Lucio or something else.
4938580	4942380	And it's like, I know somebody else isn't going to snipe that hero position or that
4942380	4943380	healer position.
4943380	4947200	And we're going to have enough, like we're going to have a well-rounded team.
4947200	4950840	You don't have like everybody trying to pick Hanzo, like in the first week of the game,
4950840	4954280	it was like, wow, our team is entirely Hanzo and Widowmaker.
4954280	4958560	So yeah, that's really helped a lot, I think, when it comes to Overwatch.
4958560	4961100	Anyway, we're going to go back to a simpler time.
4961100	4966280	It's the classic game of the week where, you know, you couldn't patch games like this.
4966280	4970160	You couldn't keep a game going for years and years through patches.
4970160	4972080	You just did sequels.
4972080	4975400	But anyway, Dark Soccer is going to open up the gaming vault and we're going to take a
4975400	4979640	trip down memory lane with this week's classic game of the week.
4979640	4982800	Dark Soccer, what did you pick for us this week?
4982800	4985680	I picked a game called Osmond.
4985680	4986680	Are you familiar with it?
4986680	4987680	Um, not really.
4987680	4989680	I've got to admit.
4989680	4994080	Osmond was produced by a company called Mitchellcore.
4994080	5000920	However, the development staff was mostly ex-Capcom staff, including Yotsui Koichi,
5000920	5008640	who was the original designer, or one of the original creators of Strider.
5008640	5014080	And this game is considered an unofficial sequel to Strider.
5014080	5015800	Like a spiritual successor type of thing?
5015800	5019000	Well, at the time it was the sequel.
5019000	5021520	It was considered, I mean, not necessarily a spiritual.
5021520	5025720	He called it his Strider 2, you know?
5026160	5032040	You can see just in this little video here a lot of things in common with Strider.
5032040	5038400	Just with how it looks with the flashing, the climbing the walls, the acrobatics.
5038400	5042560	It was actually, he calls it an irregular sequel.
5042560	5054720	So where Strider was set in a sort of futuristic Soviet-ish setting, in this case it's more
5054720	5061680	of a cyberpunk Arabian style setting, where instead of Strider Hiryu being a Japanese
5061680	5065120	guy, you play a Middle Eastern protagonist named Kirin.
5065120	5070760	And he doesn't use any weapons, he's just full fight.
5070760	5078600	And you go through all these different exotic locations and fight enemies to stop this international
5078600	5085280	sort of federal government, or the federation that's taking over the entire world.
5085280	5093040	So you're going to try to infiltrate and try to fight everybody and be the man.
5093040	5099080	At any rate, yeah, as you'll see, it has a lot of the same attack sequences that Strider
5099080	5101080	Hiryu does.
5101080	5106560	It's A to attack, B to jump, C to do your screen clearing attack.
5106560	5112840	He also has some different power-ups and he has different techniques.
5112840	5116960	He has the sliding technique that's very much like Hiryu's slide.
5116960	5121520	He has some throws for human-sized characters only.
5121520	5125440	One of them is called the Hell Wheel, the other is called the Izuna Drop.
5125440	5133640	He has an attack called the Shredding Dance, where he does a three-punch combination and
5133640	5136520	it's stronger than the basic kits but difficult to use.
5136520	5140840	And the Kirin Star Festival, where he kills all the enemies on screen, I just think that's
5140840	5142640	a great name for it.
5142640	5150680	So you actually have different branching paths and there's no actual checkpoint.
5150680	5159160	When you die, you respawn where you were last killed, although in the final stage, you have
5159160	5161080	checkpoints there.
5161080	5165000	So it's a little bit more difficult.
5165000	5169720	You have your power-ups in here that are different than Hiryu's power-ups, so you get one that
5169720	5172680	changes his pants to purple.
5172680	5174320	That's the power-up, his pants turn purple.
5174320	5176080	Okay, a little bit more than that.
5176080	5181660	He gets an energy double of himself, think of Ninja Gaiden with this, and it does the
5181660	5187680	non-upgraded versions of Kirin's attacks and then it will fly away and re-merge with Kirin.
5187680	5192560	The second one gives him red pants and two shadows.
5192560	5196600	And the third one gives him white pants and three shadows.
5196600	5201920	The last one changes his pants back to black so he gets his original pants back and does
5201920	5206560	energy blades with his kicks that increase his melee range.
5206560	5210080	And then it's a limited set of attacks on here.
5210080	5218520	So the game is, I mean, it was pretty much just like if anyone wanted another Strider
5218520	5221440	game, then Osmond was going to be your game.
5221440	5222680	It's really fun.
5222680	5227800	It was only ever released in the arcades.
5227800	5236460	So you will not find any sort of home version for this outside of, you know, Maine.
5236460	5238940	It had a different name in Japan, by the way.
5238940	5247580	It was called Cannon Dancer, which I think is a cool name, you know, Osmond doesn't really
5247580	5252980	make a lot of sense because Osmond was the name of a Turkish, I want to say a Turkish
5252980	5253980	prince or king.
5253980	5258320	Why do you think that they've stayed away from putting this in any type of like retrospective
5258320	5261220	collection or the, I mean, is it a complicated rights issue or what?
5261220	5269280	I don't know, but I've never really heard of Mitchell Corps outside of this game.
5269280	5275120	It looks like that the hardware for this was a Data East 156.
5275120	5282280	So wait, in Japan it was released by Atlas, but I don't, let me look at the Mitchell Corporation.
5282280	5283360	I want to see what else they've done.
5283360	5286400	They were a Japanese company.
5286400	5298740	They are, they hired Capcom and TAD Corporation employees, and they were owned, the president
5298740	5299740	was Roy Ozaki.
5299740	5302180	I'm trying to see what else that they've done.
5302180	5307860	They did basically, they did titles for home consoles, handhelds, Japanese mobile games,
5307860	5313340	arcade and interactive kiosks, and printed circuit boards for the coin-op market.
5313340	5318480	And then they started developing games for Nintendo hardware.
5318480	5322720	They were best known as the developer of a game called Puzloop.
5322720	5327240	They did the Pang series, which we got as Buster Brothers and distributed by Capcom.
5327240	5328240	Oh, yeah.
5328240	5329240	Okay.
5329240	5334080	I knew I'd seen the name, but it didn't really stick out to me.
5334080	5339320	A Nintendo of America release, Puzloop for Nintendo DS, under the title of Magnetica.
5339320	5344260	And then there was a four player version called Magnetica Twist on We Were Servious.
5344260	5347740	Tokyo Crash Mobs is the last of the Puzloop series.
5347740	5354860	So they did Ballistik, they did Funky Jet, licensed by Data East.
5354860	5358060	Quest Buster's kind of confirming, Mitchell Company went under a few years ago.
5358060	5359060	Yeah.
5359060	5363180	I'm just looking at some of the other names to see if any of it just looks familiar.
5363180	5366460	Charlie Ninja, that's a fun name.
5366460	5370720	They did Pallarium, Chokan Hituhide.
5370720	5375760	Yeah, I'm not really seeing number battles.
5375760	5377920	Okay, nothing to do with Strider.
5377920	5379960	Yeah, Tokyo Crash Mobs.
5379960	5382600	Yeah I'm just looking through the list of everything to see if there's anything else
5382600	5384460	that looked familiar.
5384460	5392560	So yeah, funny enough, Osmond was a 1996 release and there were zero.
5392560	5396940	I would think that if it would get a home release, like I don't know who owns the rights
5396940	5399300	to it now.
5399300	5403780	I mean what company ate up Mitchell?
5403780	5406820	Their assets might have been liquidated in her all over the place, for all we know.
5406820	5411660	So yeah, then we don't actually know who owns the rights to it.
5411660	5414420	But I can tell you that it was published in Japan by Atlas.
5414420	5420820	So I think if there was going to be any kind of home version release, it would have to
5420820	5422960	go out by Atlas, at least in Japan.
5422960	5426360	Well, if you're going to pirate it using MAME, at least you can feel good about the fact
5426360	5429200	that there is no official way to support this game.
5429200	5430900	Pirating is pretty much the only way you can play it.
5430900	5435680	Not that I usually would endorse that route, but hey, you don't want me to pay for it.
5435680	5439760	Dude, wouldn't it be cool if we bought the rights to Osmond?
5439760	5443440	We'll give those to YYR as well, even though he doesn't, I think he's pretty clearly said
5443440	5445160	he doesn't want the rights.
5445160	5446160	He's trying to raise a child.
5446160	5447160	No, no.
5447160	5448160	No, just take the gift.
5448160	5452020	I want the rights for this and release them as mini cabs.
5452020	5453020	There you go.
5453020	5454380	Like, like the little Mortal Kombat thing.
5454380	5455380	No, no, no, no, no.
5455380	5456380	Oh, mini.
5456380	5457380	Oh, mini.
5457380	5458380	Oh, okay.
5458380	5459380	Like the $100 mini cabs or whatever.
5459380	5460380	Yeah.
5460380	5461380	Yeah.
5461380	5462380	That'd be cool.
5462380	5463380	Orange, Wright and Jetsons.
5463380	5464380	Come on, Walgreens.
5464380	5465380	This is your chance.
5465380	5466860	The Osmond and Ms. Pac-Man cabinet.
5466860	5471380	But you know, this game though is if you, if you like Strider and like the challenge
5471380	5475660	of the first Strider, this game is really, really amazing for that.
5475660	5480640	I would definitely encourage everyone to, to load it up and play it.
5480640	5486600	Or if you find an arcade machine, if you find an arcade machine of Osmond in the wild, fucking
5486600	5494760	tweet it to us and you take a video of yourself playing it, I will hand write you a letter
5494760	5495760	and mail it to you.
5495760	5496760	Thanks.
5496760	5499760	You will have, you will hand write a letter of thanks and send it to the listener.
5499760	5500760	It may not say thanks.
5500760	5509300	It may, it may have, uh, like an, uh, an Instax photo of me or the cat or Mr. Smoosh or my
5509300	5513020	foot, but I'll send you a picture.
5513020	5516540	I just can't guarantee what the picture will be.
5516540	5517780	That's your prize.
5517780	5518780	That's what I'm holding.
5518780	5521180	Um, while, uh, time to pizza is going on.
5521180	5523460	It's it's it's yes.
5523460	5528260	So while there is one person participating in time to pizza, everybody else gets to participate
5528260	5536200	in the find an Osmond machine, literally anywhere that works in the wild and send me a video
5536200	5540760	of you playing it and you will get a thing, a Polaroid or something.
5540760	5543600	You might get maybe an animal crossing trading card.
5543600	5544600	Okay.
5544600	5545600	All right.
5545600	5546600	I've got dupes anyway.
5546600	5547600	I think that's it.
5547600	5548600	My b-roll is running out.
5548600	5549600	So there it is.
5549600	5550600	A classic game of the week.
5550600	5551600	Osmond.
5551600	5553780	Ah, all right.
5553780	5556560	Orange Wright says this contest can be called Time to Osmond.
5556560	5557560	I like that.
5557560	5559680	It's time to play this game.
5559680	5560680	Check it out.
5560680	5561680	It really is a very good game.
5561680	5562680	It is.
5562680	5565480	And if you weren't, if you're on the podcast feed and you can't see the Twitch, you know,
5565480	5568560	stuff cause you don't subscribe on Twitch or whatever, like at least like go look up
5568560	5569960	a YouTube long play of it.
5569960	5570960	GGKS.
5570960	5571960	Yeah.
5571960	5572960	So you can see the game.
5572960	5573960	GGKS.
5573960	5574960	What's that?
5574960	5575960	Uh, Google.
5575960	5577360	It means look it up on Google.
5577360	5578360	Stupid.
5578360	5579760	Oh, let me Google that for you.com.
5579760	5580760	No.
5580760	5581760	All right.
5581760	5586020	O S M A N if you're curious or Canon Dan, but you do want to put, you don't want to
5586020	5587020	put Osmond video games.
5587020	5593140	I think there's some youtuber out there will know Osmond was a real Turkish dignitary of
5593140	5600740	some kind in the ancient ages, but also now some big youtuber because uh, when I searched
5600740	5604700	for the guy, I just put Osmond at first and I got some youtube dude and I was like, video
5604700	5605700	game.
5605700	5614560	It is Osmond the first or Osmond Ghazi who died in a 1323 who was a Questbuster says
5614560	5616080	founded the Ottoman dynasty.
5616080	5617080	Ottoman Turks.
5617080	5618080	Exactly.
5618080	5619080	Today.
5619080	5620080	Yeah.
5620080	5623600	Even old New York was once New Amsterdam.
5623600	5624600	Why they change it?
5624600	5629480	I can't say maybe they liked it better that way.
5629480	5630480	Sorry.
5630480	5634840	I, I can't help it whenever anybody talks about the Turks and stuff is that song comes
5634840	5635840	to mind.
5635840	5636840	All right.
5636840	5637840	Anyway, it's probably, I hope that's not disrespectful.
5637840	5638840	Yes.
5638840	5644000	The Ottoman dynasty bringers of, you know, footrests everywhere is careful.
5644000	5645340	You don't want to risk a mute.
5645340	5646340	Oh, come on.
5646340	5647900	Do you actually, do you know what else I played this week?
5647900	5649300	I just didn't put it on stream.
5649300	5652380	We'll talk about this and we'll get into rapid fire news cause we don't have a break saving
5652380	5653380	tonight.
5653380	5654380	I played Twitch sings.
5654380	5658740	I actually play, it's just, just because I was like, this icon is on my desktop and I've
5658740	5659740	never clicked it.
5659740	5660740	Click, click.
5660740	5662500	And I played a little bit to which things it is.
5662500	5663500	It's karaoke revolution.
5663500	5664800	It is pretty much exactly that game.
5664800	5665800	Did you get your ABBA on?
5665800	5666800	I, you fuck.
5666800	5667800	Yeah, I did.
5667800	5670160	It actually has a pretty robust library of songs.
5670160	5671160	I was pretty impressed.
5671160	5673000	It had my Atlanta song and everything.
5673000	5674720	Um, do they mute you though?
5674720	5678480	If you, I mean, I would assume that they don't know because it's their game.
5678480	5683160	So I mean, and you're, it's, they're all karaoke covers, so they're not the real song.
5683160	5686880	So, um, and I imagine they must've licensed the rights cause they don't have every song
5686880	5690080	ever made, but they have a, and you can do duets.
5690080	5691080	That's what I thought was the interesting thing.
5691080	5695480	So like a streamer could start and that there's a phone app that does this too.
5695480	5699100	And then you can go in and do your half while the other one is going, does that mean I can
5699100	5701200	get someone to do islands in the stream with me?
5701200	5702200	You could.
5702200	5703200	Yeah.
5703200	5706620	If I could, if I can fix my sink, um, I'll do islands in the stream, but I get to be
5706620	5707620	Dolly.
5707620	5709060	I don't want to be Kenny Rogers.
5709060	5711740	He's like full of preservatives.
5711740	5715300	Have you seen that man's face?
5715360	5717280	Islands in the stream.
5717280	5718280	Stop.
5721280	5722480	Knock it off.
5722480	5727080	I had to listen to my wife get triggered to sing songs like by every single word in the
5727080	5729720	goddamn like English language.
5729720	5730720	Can you just stop?
5730720	5733120	Can I get a break from that for just a little bit?
5733120	5737920	Dan and I just make up our own lyrics to things and we, then we sing songs about the cat.
5737920	5742800	Does that, is that an invite to sing a cat song?
5742800	5743800	All right.
5744780	5745780	Moving on.
5745780	5748220	Oh, you should wait, wait, wait.
5748220	5750580	Stop before I'm ready to derail this train a little bit more.
5750580	5755400	So like we watched, there's this show on Netflix now, it's like explaining different things
5755400	5756580	like that they have there.
5756580	5759820	Um, and so one of them was K-pop.
5759820	5763820	What is K-pop, you know, explaining what it's K-pop explains.
5763820	5769860	So my wife saw that and she does not like K-pop and she also doesn't like the fact that
5769920	5775080	I'm like, well, you know, I don't necessarily listen to this stuff, but I've listened to
5775080	5776080	some K-pop music.
5776080	5778080	Of course you would.
5778080	5783920	I liked Monsta X for a hot minute, but the rest of us really cookie cutter.
5783920	5788560	Speaking of karaoke, since we're derailing the train, um, I did not know we had one of
5788560	5791920	those places downtown, like right across the street from the crest.
5791920	5795580	There's one of those places you go upstairs and you can rent a room, a karaoke room and
5795580	5800040	like have it and you can get sushi and stuff and drinks like delivered to your little private
5800040	5801040	room.
5801040	5804600	Like there's a whole, like it's just like a legit karaoke and not just like drunk white
5804600	5805600	people karaoke.
5805600	5807040	Well, it's both.
5807040	5809640	But Coriana Plaza, you can do the same thing.
5809640	5811840	Well, but there's one right here.
5811840	5817640	There's the place actually that I like to go do karaoke is, um, in, uh, Japantown in
5817640	5818640	San Francisco.
5818640	5819640	Upstairs.
5819640	5823120	Um, they have like a little bar and then they have the karaoke rooms.
5823120	5824120	I don't think I've been there.
5824120	5825120	Really fun.
5825660	5827300	There's a better place in Alameda though.
5827300	5828820	Back to video games.
5828820	5830940	Let's get to rapid fire news.
5830940	5832660	All right.
5832660	5837900	Um, so we talked a little bit about what's coming to PlayStation plus in October.
5837900	5839580	Let's talk about Microsoft.
5839580	5843940	So Microsoft is getting, uh, I love this name.
5843940	5845180	This is awesome.
5845180	5848900	So the first game on the list is Tembo, the Badass Elephant.
5848900	5853000	That's coming to Xbox one and also Friday the 13th, the game that's getting to be the
5853020	5855700	second half of October through the middle of November.
5855700	5856700	Tembo the Badass Elephant.
5856700	5857700	Tembo the Badass Elephant.
5857700	5859700	Sign me the fuck up.
5859700	5860820	It is your free game.
5860820	5862020	He's not Dumbo.
5862020	5863440	He's Tembo.
5863440	5868500	And then your Xbox 360 compatible games really scraping the bottom of this barrel, Disney's
5868500	5869500	Bolt.
5869500	5871580	Remember that movie?
5871580	5875500	Um, and then Ninja Gaiden three, Razor's Edge.
5875500	5877580	That's going to be the second half of October.
5877580	5878580	Hmm.
5879000	5880000	Hmm.
5880000	5884080	And then, uh, let's celebrate 130 years of Nintendo.
5884080	5885080	That's right.
5885080	5890200	They turned 130 and you may be thinking, well, wait, what am I talking about?
5890200	5893680	You guys know that they've made card games before they made video games.
5893680	5894680	Jesus Christ.
5894680	5897120	I'm not going to explain it like, like it's a big shock or anything.
5897120	5898120	Okay.
5898120	5906400	But yeah, so 130 and they are, uh, the oldest, um, or they're one of the oldest gaming companies
5907380	5915460	Apparently, uh, Taito was founded in 1953 and Sega began in 1960 and they are much older.
5915460	5917740	So good for them.
5917740	5922460	Wait, not if you're in 1960, you're not older than Nintendo's way older than that.
5922460	5924660	No, I said Nintendo is much older than that.
5924660	5925660	Oh, okay.
5925660	5926660	I get it.
5926660	5927660	Yes.
5927660	5928660	I know math backwards.
5928660	5929660	Do you?
5929660	5930660	Okay.
5930660	5931660	Moving on.
5931660	5934620	Uh, let's talk about speaking of Nintendo.
5934620	5936560	Let's talk about the switch online collection.
5936560	5941720	Have you, uh, gotten a super Nintendo controller to use with your super Nintendo games on the
5941720	5942860	switch?
5942860	5947420	If the answer is no, then you're missing out on a cute little extra something, something.
5947420	5951040	If you have the switch online, super Nintendo collection and the controller that goes with
5951040	5957120	it, when you go into certain super Nintendo games, the collection menu will replace the
5957120	5961560	standard sound effects with some from super Mario world.
5961560	5963180	Ooh.
5963200	5967400	You get sound effect replacements for having spent all of that money on that controller.
5967400	5968400	Oh, whatever.
5968400	5974000	It's, it's cute, I guess, but, and you know, honestly, I'll, I'll snark in that stuff aside.
5974000	5978120	The super Nintendo controller really was like one of like, like the perfect controller in
5978120	5979120	many ways.
5979120	5982960	I mean, yeah, it didn't have analog cause gaming wasn't there yet, but for like non
5982960	5988000	analog stuff, I don't think there was a better controller in my opinion, anyway.
5988000	5989000	More Nintendo stuff.
5989660	5994300	This is interesting because apparently the brand new character, the Dragon Quest hero
5994300	6000140	was banned in competitive play in the official Nintendo France tournament.
6000140	6001140	That's right.
6001140	6005940	Nintendo in France banned one of their own, the Dragon Quest hero characters, but then
6005940	6008900	Nintendo ended up unbanning them.
6008900	6012900	So Nintendo is standardizing rule sets for all tournaments across the European team cup
6012900	6015520	in response to what France did.
6015540	6020180	So they're said in a quote, we're harmonizing these rules across Europe to make sure that
6020180	6026060	no community or country is disadvantaged when competing in the pan European final next year.
6026060	6030340	In terms of future fighter releases, we'll create more detailed guidelines for our tournament
6030340	6035140	organizers to make sure that we maintain a level playing field through consistent fighter
6035140	6036940	eligibility across Europe.
6036940	6042180	And I suppose France had no choice, but to surrender to this official designation from
6042180	6043600	Nintendo of Europe.
6043600	6045300	So there you go.
6045300	6047360	All right, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?
6047360	6048360	Stuff.
6048360	6053480	Um, anyway, uh, Grandia, the first and second game, which are actually a couple of games
6053480	6059880	that I super, super, super like, um, are going to have, um, HD remasters coming out for PC
6059880	6061800	on October 15th.
6061800	6066640	And you know, I'm gonna get it because I fucking love the first Grandia.
6066640	6069720	I mean, it'd be nice playing a version that looks good that I don't have to bust out my
6069720	6072720	Saturn for and then sit with a dictionary to play.
6072740	6079300	Um, but it will have, um, both the English and Japanese audio, um, it will have enhanced
6079300	6084700	sprites and texture art, UI improvements, widescreen support and customizable resolutions.
6084700	6090020	Um, and it will have steam achievements and you can also of course do custom, uh, controller,
6090020	6091780	uh, mapping.
6091780	6100140	And then, um, the, uh, I believe that these are already out on switch and there is a patch
6100160	6103480	coming out for it in November.
6103480	6105360	So there you go.
6105360	6106960	Um, but freaking grandia.
6106960	6107960	Oh my God.
6107960	6110400	One of the best RPGs ever.
6110400	6111880	I figured you'd like that news.
6111880	6113080	Heck yeah.
6113080	6118000	And then, um, house of the dead one and two are both coming to the switch.
6118000	6124520	Um, and it is being, uh, done by a Polish studio called forever entertainment and they're
6124520	6127280	bringing us the gun games.
6127460	6131460	Hopefully it'll be nice and pretty in the higher definition.
6131460	6137860	So about how is it like, if it's coming to the switch, is it a touch screen?
6137860	6142620	I mean, don't to, to be determined.
6142620	6146820	We don't know if when, when something gets listed on a, you know, rating, it doesn't
6146820	6147820	make any sense.
6147820	6148820	Like, well, we don't know.
6148820	6151980	Maybe we get a specific gun and sensor for it.
6151980	6152980	Maybe.
6152980	6153980	Hooray.
6153980	6156500	Or maybe it's just something you were just going to use the stick to aim and do it that
6156500	6157500	way.
6157500	6158500	Oh, horrible.
6158500	6162260	I know, but it might, it might be having, uh, dark to see this is just joy con aiming.
6162260	6166000	Maybe you point the joy con and move it that way using the HD sensor or whatever.
6166000	6167000	Who knows?
6167000	6168000	We'll see.
6168000	6169000	Yeah.
6169000	6170000	Yeah.
6170000	6171000	All right.
6171000	6172000	Insert Marge Simpson noise here.

6211820	6218300	Nintendo switch and PlayStation four one night stand on PlayStation four and X-Box one.
6218300	6219300	My heavens.

6246900	6251140	And last but not least, Tom Clancy's ghost recon break point on PC, PlayStation four
6251140	6252140	and X-Box one.
6252140	6253140	All right.
6253140	6257460	Well, going over to Japan and checking out the releases there, um, PlayStation four kind
6257460	6258460	of slow this week.
6258460	6263580	The only real major release that I see on the Japanese realist is the, um, Tom Clancy
6263580	6267100	ghost recon break point, cause that's like a world wide release pretty much it's coming
6267100	6268100	out everywhere.
6268100	6271100	Um, and that is also a, no exception in Japan that is coming out over there.
6271100	6275100	Uh, I was trying to see if maybe there's a huge game on Nintendo switch this week.
6275100	6280180	That is the reason why they're not putting out anything, um, really, uh, on the PlayStation
6280180	6281180	four.
6281180	6285040	But, uh, the biggest things I see is, uh, that there are some new Nintendo switch controllers
6285040	6286040	in different colors.
6286040	6288700	I know some people are going to be one of like the purple and the orange, maybe.
6288700	6291900	Although I think a lot of that, I think a lot of those colors are releasing here.
6292020	6294500	Um, that is on the list for the switch this week.
6294500	6299980	Otherwise the only other big thing I see is the amnesia later, uh, cross crowd crowd for
6299980	6305220	Nintendo switch in a regular and limited edition, uh, and super robot wars V.
6305220	6307520	Those are really the only big releases this week in Japan.
6307520	6311740	So, um, a bit of a slower week, all things considered, but there's a few things.
6311740	6312740	How about Europe?
6312740	6313740	Dark Sakura.
6313740	6317220	In Europe, we have a handful on the 30th.
6317220	6322860	We have ghost recon, break point, gold, ultimate edition, sniper elite three, ultimate edition.
6322860	6329940	Um, on October 3rd, we have Sega mega drive mini.
6329940	6332620	This is when it says Sega mega drive that fast.
6332620	6335900	I didn't realize it was so delayed for Europe because you know, the one here is out.
6335900	6336900	The Genesis one is out.
6336900	6341100	Um, Ghostbusters, the video game remastered comes out.
6341980	6348340	Friday the 13th, the game ultimate slasher edition also comes out and ghost recon break
6348340	6349340	point.
6349340	6355300	Um, I guess the normal version is that on October 3rd.
6355300	6356300	Cool.
6356300	6357300	That's it.
6357300	6362060	All right, let's go to our mailbag.
6362060	6366680	Every week we invite your emails to participate at orange lounge radio.com and we read our
6366680	6368180	favorites here on the show.
6368180	6369980	My favorites are zero cause there aren't any.
6369980	6371940	There are no emails this week.
6371940	6372940	What a pity.
6372940	6373940	You know what this means?
6373940	6374940	Oh, that's right.
6374940	6378820	We get to do drag race talk, but there's no drag race airing right now.
6378820	6380460	They're doing drag race Canada.
6380460	6381460	Okay.
6381460	6382620	So I'll ask this question.
6382620	6385820	What do you think of all the, cause remember folks, when you don't send us emails, we have
6385820	6389020	no choice but to talk about RuPaul's drag race, Loki's favorite thing in the world.
6389020	6391600	Um, so what do you think about all these international versions?
6391600	6392600	There's Canadian.
6392600	6393600	We're going to get Australian.
6393600	6394600	UK.
6394600	6395600	The UK is coming out soon.
6395600	6396600	Thailand's great.
6396600	6397600	Thailand's great.
6397600	6399200	I'm, I'm going to be honest.
6399200	6403080	This is why I'm a little bit like, Oh yeah, that was the threat we made to the listeners.
6403080	6405400	I'm kind of burned out on drag race.
6405400	6409920	Like I don't like, I know they're making a season 12 and I'm so burned out.
6409920	6413120	Like the time to do these international versions was six years ago.
6413120	6414120	Yeah.
6414120	6415120	I don't know though.
6415120	6419320	I was kind of wanting to watch Dragula this season because they have a drag king on their
6419320	6422640	land and cider who I've seen perform a few times in LA.
6422640	6423640	Absolutely phenomenal.
6423640	6424640	Yeah.
6424640	6428940	But you know, that big thing went on about how misogynist the word fish is.
6428940	6432180	And just for anyone who does not know, you should cover Dragula.
6432180	6436540	I thought they talked about it, but some of my local queen buddies were talking about
6436540	6442900	it that, you know, typically in drag, the word fish is used to mean extremely feminine,
6442900	6449880	which comes from a derogatory about female anatomy and about certain odors that could
6449880	6451700	come out of it.
6451700	6457300	And so basically you're calling femininity a smelly vagina.
6457300	6461060	And that in and of itself is highly misogynist.
6461060	6462060	Stop it.
6462060	6467740	At any rate, there's been, I had to block a couple of the, um, the Bay Area Queens over
6467740	6474300	it because they just didn't get it like, Oh, well, but I have a shrine to femininity and
6474300	6477620	um, yeah, so you're objectifying us then, right?
6477620	6484260	We're just something to have in a shrine and not to actually, I have a fish friend.
6484260	6486100	Our fish died this week.
6486100	6487100	I'm sorry to hear that.
6487100	6492580	Well, I say our, because it was basically the kid's fish, but I had to take care of
6492580	6493580	it.
6493580	6494580	You had to flush it down the toilet.
6494580	6495580	What kind of fish was it?
6495580	6496580	Oh, I just threw it away.
6496580	6497580	Oh, that's sad.
6497580	6498580	What kind of fish?
6498580	6499580	It was a beta.
6499580	6500580	Oh, okay.
6500580	6501580	Let's buy another one.
6501580	6502580	Anyway.
6502580	6506840	Um, the thing about Dragula, I don't like, I think it's very stylish and I like that
6506840	6507840	style of drag.
6507840	6508840	I think it's really fun.
6508840	6511540	I think those extermination challenges are the stupidest thing in the world.
6511540	6512540	They're too much.
6512540	6513540	They have nothing to do with drag.
6513540	6515060	I don't, it ruins the show for me.
6515060	6518820	So anyway, yeah, that's it though.
6518820	6522340	But I do think it's rad that Dragula has more variety in the performers.
6522340	6523340	That's pretty cool.
6523340	6524820	See what happens when we talk about fish and the cat cones.
6524820	6531420	I know it's like, it's like Mr. Smoosh got fish for me, chicken, chicken, no, now he's
6531420	6532420	just scratching his back.
6532420	6533420	All right.
6533420	6534420	Anyway, let's move on.
6534420	6537540	Uh, let's talk about, uh, more news.
6537540	6540380	We're going to get to, uh, Loki with another story for us.
6540380	6541420	All right.
6541420	6547140	So, uh, we talked a little bit about, like I said, the whole PlayStation event, and now
6547140	6551900	we're going to talk about the, uh, after the state of play, there was a whole Microsoft
6551900	6554100	inside Xbox presentation.
6554100	6557860	So stuff that they talked about then, of course, um, Xbox game pass came up.
6557860	6562140	So they talked about new games that are going to be coming out on Xbox game pass, including
6562140	6566300	Jump Force, Bloodstained, Ritual of the Night, and Lego worlds are being added on the Xbox
6566300	6567420	one side.
6567420	6573860	And then on PC, Cities Skylines, Saints Row IV, and Bad North, and Dirt Rally 2.0.
6573860	6580020	They said that the Xbox games app or pass app has been updated as well with some additional
6580020	6585180	improvements, including, uh, they said there's going to be more indie games coming to games
6585180	6592160	pass, including Genesis Noir, Lonely Mountain Downhill, and Demons Tilt.
6592160	6593660	And then what else?
6594660	6600980	There's going to be a brand new, um, game comedy puzzle game called Felix the Reaper
6600980	6605740	that's going to be available on October 17th, available on game pass that day as well.
6605740	6609900	They talked a little bit about Project xCloud, their streaming service that's going to be
6609900	6611100	available soon.
6611100	6616700	So apparently if you're in the US, UK, or Korea, you can apply to be able to test that
6616700	6617700	out.
6617700	6622940	And so if you have an Android device and a wireless Xbox one controller, you can sign
6622940	6629620	up to preview it and, um, so I will have to check it out except I don't have a wireless
6629620	6633100	Xbox one controller, although I could use another controller.
6633100	6635860	So might as well pick that up and maybe sign up for that.
6635860	6642340	Um, and then of course, early access for, uh, or the, there's the game Atlas that was
6642340	6644780	a pirate MMO game that was on steam early access.
6644780	6650660	That's coming to Xbox one on October 8th, and it's also going to be available simultaneously
6650660	6653200	on Xbox and PC.
6653200	6658620	I'm assuming, um, they're going to have the same game on both platforms.
6658620	6664940	And then there's a brand new Xbox one X and Xbox one S hardware bundles that include Forza
6664940	6669400	horizon four and the Lego speed champions expansion.
6669400	6670700	So that's about it.
6670700	6671700	I liked it.
6671700	6672700	That was time.
6672700	6673700	The same day as Sony's thing.
6673700	6677140	I'm sure that was completely coincidental and not intentional.
6677140	6681900	One bit, uh, she hold 10 in our chat over at Twitch TV slash VOG network says Xbox is
6681900	6684920	working hard or excuse me, Xbox is really working hard.
6684920	6686100	It will pay off soon.
6686100	6689540	You know, I do think the cloud thing is going to be very interesting.
6689540	6693580	I'm really curious to see how that's going to change up Microsoft's landscape.
6693580	6698940	I feel like I'm, I'm definitely personally and more excited about what Xbox is doing
6698940	6702740	with that and Microsoft, I guess with the cloud then maybe like Google stadium.
6702740	6707500	So does that X cloud stuff tie in with, is that only games that you own or is that like
6707500	6713980	if I have Xbox game pass and I have X cloud, then I also get access to all those games
6713980	6718240	and I can play them streaming cause that I could see would be very interesting, especially
6718240	6720140	with all the deals that they had with that.
6720140	6721140	Yeah.
6721140	6722460	Um, that may be worth it.
6722460	6723460	Yeah.
6723460	6726940	I would love if I don't have to do these huge downloads to do things on game pass anymore.
6726940	6729180	Like maybe I can just fire up gears five on the cloud.
6729180	6732220	I might be more inclined to test it out and see if it's something I would like want to
6732220	6733220	download.
6733220	6734220	Yeah.
6734220	6735500	So it'd be very curious to see how that all kind of comes together in the next couple
6735500	6736500	of months.
6736500	6737500	Yeah.
6737500	6738500	Okay.
6738500	6739500	Cause it's like October is supposed to be the launch month for this, right?
6739500	6744500	Or at least at the beta or like the preview or whatever they're calling it, it'd be interesting.
6744500	6745500	Excited for it.
6745500	6746500	All right.
6746500	6749580	Well, I'm also excited for an updated version of bloodstained.
6749580	6750580	That's right.
6750580	6754740	Bloodstained is going to be getting a switch update and it's been delayed and there's been
6754740	6755740	apologies.
6755740	6758940	And you know, the switch version, which is the version I have of bloodstain has some
6758940	6761780	problems that ended up getting apologized for.
6761780	6766100	There was supposed to be several small updates, but then there was a big one that got delayed
6766100	6767220	and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.
6767220	6772340	So they're saying that the new patch will be focusing on four areas, visual fidelity,
6772340	6775500	loading times, particle effects, and input lag.
6775500	6777700	And they really get into the weeds of this.
6777700	6781540	I'm not going to get into all the, you know, details, but they are working on it.
6781540	6786040	They're going to be doling out two updates and the first will sport the vast majority
6786040	6787040	of changes.
6787040	6788980	The second will improve performance.
6788980	6795700	So they are saying the goal is the end of November, assuming that there is no further
6795700	6796700	delay.
6796700	6799060	It should be noted that the game is not even out in Japan yet.
6799060	6804340	So October 24th is when the game is supposed to come out in Japan.
6804340	6810140	The Xbox edition is going to be getting some extra stuff, some DLC, a balance update and
6810140	6812600	some HDR fixes and so forth.
6812600	6818940	So there's still much more to come with bloodstained, but it should be pointed out that Igarashi
6818940	6824780	is still planning on making bloodstained a series in an interview with Game Informer
6824780	6829120	because, you know, I know we heard about the cutbacks, but there at least is still like
6829120	6831080	one or two more issues of Game Informer.
6831080	6837560	So Game Informer had an interview with Igarashi who talked about the pressure of Kickstarter
6837560	6841620	and so forth, because that's how the game was funded years ago, right?
6841620	6843600	Because it was years ago.
6843600	6847300	So anyway, quality control, he said was the hardest part.
6847300	6850420	When you're working with an outsourced studio, it can be difficult to match the quality line
6850420	6851740	when things changed.
6851740	6855100	With bloodstained, we would first share our goal with the outsourced studio and make sure
6855100	6859340	we both agree and determine the necessities, but even with proper planning, it's difficult
6859340	6860420	to reach.
6860420	6865260	So anyway, he does say that bloodstained is a starting ground for the next step and wants
6865260	6868740	to make a series after putting in the effort with this.
6868740	6872540	So we'll see if maybe there's going to be a bloodstained 2 or something else, maybe
6872540	6875220	in the same universe, maybe just not the same name.
6875220	6876220	Bring back my dude.
6876220	6877220	Who knows?
6877220	6879180	Bring back my dude.
6879180	6881860	Fifth Dream today in chat says, I'm mad about the Switch screw up.
6881860	6885140	They're delaying all the DLC I paid for and the Kickstarter to fix it.
6885140	6888620	So well, I'm glad that they are delaying DLC.
6888620	6890060	I'm glad they're fixing it.
6890060	6893140	You know, you know, not every company always fixes.
6893140	6894140	I get.
6894140	6895140	But like, you know what I'm saying?
6895140	6896140	Not necessarily that.
6896140	6900860	Yeah, it sucks that your DLC is being delayed, but I'm glad they're focusing on the fixes
6900860	6904660	versus the DLC like some other studios.
6904660	6905660	Trying to get more money first.
6905660	6906660	Yeah, I get it.
6906660	6907660	I get it.
6907660	6908660	So.
6908660	6909660	Cool.
6909660	6912720	I still need to sit down and really play the game more.
6912720	6915300	But when I heard they were going to fix the Switch version, I was like, well, let me just
6915300	6916740	wait till the fix comes out then.
6916740	6919180	I mean, I've waited this long to play bloodstained.
6919180	6920180	What's another couple of months?
6920180	6921180	Right.
6921180	6922180	I'd love to see you in chat.
6922180	6924180	The PS4 version is really good.
6924180	6925180	Was that?
6925180	6928100	The PS4 one is pretty, pretty good.
6928100	6929100	That's cool.
6929100	6930100	Yeah.
6930100	6932420	Looking back, I probably should have got a different console or something, but I don't
6932420	6933420	know.
6933420	6934420	I love my Switch.
6935180	6938140	At least they're trying to avoid another Mighty No. 9 situation.
6938140	6939140	Yeah, they are.
6939140	6940860	So at least there's that.
6940860	6941860	All right.
6941860	6943180	Let's move on to another story.
6943180	6946620	Speaking of things on the Nintendo Switch, right, DarkSakura?
6946620	6947620	Right.
6947620	6952500	So the original Yokai Watch, which I hate how they put the hyphen in it.
6952500	6955460	The word doesn't need a hyphen or whatever.
6955460	6961900	Anyway, Yokai Watch, the very original one, is going to be coming on to the Switch.
6961900	6968420	And there is a second trailer up for it now on the official YouTube channel, and they're
6968420	6970900	getting online battle support.
6970900	6975620	And so this is looking like it's going to give you quite a bit more about the original
6975620	6976620	Yokai Watch.
6976620	6980440	I mean, there's not really much else to say because it's Yokai Watch, but it's nice for
6980440	6986780	people who might not have had the experience of playing it when it came out.
6986780	6995220	Of course, the trailer for it is in Japanese, but hopefully we'll be getting an English
6995220	6997860	version for fans of the series.
6997860	6999860	So it looks pretty good though.
6999860	7004080	I mean, nice and clean, and looks like it could be fun.
7004080	7008300	So there you go, Yokai Watch.
7008300	7009300	So anyway.
7009300	7016500	All right, so something that came out of State of Play, the PlayStation event, was some more
7016500	7021980	details on Call of Duty Modern Warfare, which is releasing here pretty soon.
7021980	7029620	And one thing that they announced is, unfortunately, that the Modern Warfare survival mode, part
7029620	7035840	of the spec ops thing, is going to be exclusive on the PlayStation 4 until October 1st, 2020.
7035840	7042180	So if you're looking to play that part of spec or special ops, you're going to have
7042180	7046000	to buy it on PlayStation or wait a whole year for the brand new Call of Duty game to come
7046000	7051360	out and then they'll release that on there.
7051360	7058160	Of course, there's been some backlash regarding it, but according to the developers, they're
7058160	7062880	saying that, well, it's only like 1% of the game, to which I said, well, if it's only
7062880	7067660	1% of the game, then why lock it as a console exclusive feature then if it's not such a
7067660	7068660	big deal?
7068660	7069660	Obviously.
7069660	7073000	But you personally would pick up these games on PS4 anyway, right?
7073000	7074840	Yeah, or PC.
7074840	7075840	I don't know.
7075840	7076840	Depends.
7076840	7082520	So, yeah, probably on PlayStation 4, but I'd only really care.
7082520	7083520	It's the whole...
7083520	7085320	Yeah, I get it.
7085320	7089520	It's a very Activision thing to do.
7089520	7093680	Maybe that should just be like a trademark, a saying, it's an Activision thing to do.
7093680	7094680	Yeah.
7094680	7096800	So I, yeah, I don't know.
7096800	7099040	But that must be, what did they get in exchange for that?
7099040	7101120	They get like free ad dollars promotion.
7101120	7108340	They probably get more featuring on the PlayStation store, which I'm sure a lot of people just
7108340	7110040	impulse buy things like that.
7110040	7114360	They see the ad for it and just push X to spend money and they do it if they're a fan
7114360	7115360	of the series.
7115360	7119440	And I don't know if that necessarily is going to be a big push for that, but it still kind
7119440	7123920	of sucks that you feel like you're not really getting a full game on other platforms.
7123920	7124920	Right.
7124920	7125920	All right.
7125920	7130480	Well, before we get to some Discord calls, if you want to be on the show, head on over
7130480	7134360	to our green room at our Discord server, vognetwork.com slash Discord.
7134360	7136840	That's vognetwork.com slash Discord.
7136840	7140120	If you want to be on the show, or you can ask some questions in our chat room as well
7140120	7143040	over at twitch.tv slash vognetwork.
7143040	7148200	But before we get to that, we have one more story tonight and it's another yikes involving
7148200	7150560	the game Fallout 76.
7150560	7155420	Just when you thought it was over with all the yikes things going on with Fallout 76.
7155420	7158800	This actually has nothing to do with the game itself.
7158800	7164680	It has to do with the collectible edition of the game, the $150 collectible issue of
7164680	7165680	the game.
7165680	7171300	A recall was issued by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission for the power armor
7171300	7176280	helmet for Fallout 76 sold exclusively by GameStop, as if they haven't had enough bad
7176280	7177280	news.
7177280	7178960	Well, technically it's not the collector's edition of the game.
7178960	7181520	It was a collectible helmet that they released.
7181520	7186680	They did have now the two, you know, not to get it confused with the helmet that did come
7186680	7187680	with the collectors.
7188560	7194000	But it's a, it's another helmet that was also collectible that they were selling it games
7194000	7195000	up.
7195000	7196000	I see.
7196000	7201160	So anyhow, noted on the website, which you can see yourself because it is a government
7201160	7207400	website at, I think it's cpsc.gov and you can see this for yourself.
7207400	7211560	The fabric insert used for the helmet may contain mold.
7211560	7217080	And if you have a compromised immune system that could be trouble or allergies, even just
7217080	7221600	allergies, because depending on how bad they are, I mean, it could close air passages and
7221600	7222600	all that too.
7222600	7223600	So yikes.
7223600	7228340	Now, uh, and a quick follow up to this story running around the internet Chronicle collectibles
7228340	7234080	who made this helmet did want to clarify the only affected units are the Nuka Cola branded
7234080	7236020	red helmets.
7236020	7239640	Only 32 units were actually reported as being sold.
7239640	7240640	I'm sorry.
7240640	7241640	I'm sorry.
7241640	7251640	Well, then I guess it's not such a big deal now that I think of it only, only 32 units.
7251640	7259100	Only 32 of these were actually sold in the entire fucking country, 32 were sold.
7259100	7264520	And apparently the customers that were impacted have been reached any other power armor helmets.
7264520	7267640	Cause I guess there's other types were not recalled.
7267640	7275320	So to be fair, they may have sold more of them, but of this particular brand, they sold
7275320	7279640	32.
7279640	7283280	There's that many people watching on Twitch currently.
7283280	7285160	Congratulations.
7285160	7290680	We make up the entire population of the world of who bought this collectible.
7290680	7293040	Oh boy.
7293040	7295040	Fifth dream today just does want to point out.
7295040	7297400	It's only if you wear it, lol.
7297400	7300680	Thour 66 says, at least it's not radiation.
7300680	7301680	That's true.
7301680	7303320	Uh, here's the thing though.
7303320	7307920	It's just one of those things where like, like, again, I hate to dog pile on this game,
7307920	7312160	but you know, there's a lot of questionable stuff with this game to be, it's just like
7312160	7317020	another one of those things where it's just like, here's another one, even though it was
7317020	7319720	only 32 units, it's still like, it's mold.
7319720	7320720	It's gross.
7320720	7324480	People don't like to hear that their products that they paid $150 for have mold, whether
7324480	7326200	there's only 32 people or not.
7326200	7329320	So it's just, wow.
7329320	7331840	Anyway, let's move on.
7331840	7335080	Let's see if we have anybody in our discord server that wants to give us a call.
7335080	7336440	I actually have some good news.
7336440	7337440	Uh, sure.
7337440	7339720	Go for it while I get our discord service set up here.
7339720	7344000	One of our dear friends and listeners, um, who we haven't probably heard from in a little
7344000	7349960	while has been kind enough to arrange me to get the links awakening Slurpee cups from
7349960	7350960	Canada.
7350960	7351960	Oh yeah.
7351960	7354680	I was seeing some of this exchange on like Twitter or Facebook or something.
7354680	7356120	Hopefully it will arrive soon.
7356120	7361120	It was mailed out on Tuesday, so I'm doing the happy dance cause I want my Zelda cups
7361120	7364520	to stay in.
7364520	7365520	Okay.
7365520	7368640	Uh, you were saying, you were saying something else about Slurpees in our chat.
7368640	7373100	Like I guess yes, black cherry Slurpee and it's black.
7373100	7374360	It's goth as fuck.
7374360	7375880	Does that mean it makes your tongue black too?
7375880	7377960	I hope so.
7377960	7380840	I want everyone to see my deathly power from the inside.
7380840	7382840	The black is actually mold.
7383560	7387840	No black cherry deliciousness flavor and he makes that with the Coke though.
7387840	7389840	You know, and we'll tell you how to mix it with Coke.
7389840	7393720	All right, well we do have a call waiting in the green room to come on the show and
7393720	7397340	I knew this actually somebody that wanted to come on tonight to talk about something
7397340	7399080	a little, I thought this was kind of unique.
7399080	7401160	So hi, you're on orange on radio.
7401160	7402160	Who's this?
7402160	7403160	That's Shane.
7403160	7405360	Hey Shane, welcome back to OLR.
7405360	7406360	You've been on the show.
7406360	7407360	It's only been a week.
7407360	7408360	I know, right?
7408360	7410240	Like you've been calling a lot lately.
7410240	7411520	How's how's things been with you?
7411520	7412520	Things happen.
7412520	7413520	What?
7413520	7414520	Fine.
7414520	7417480	I said, well, a lot has like things keep happening that make me call.
7417480	7418480	So
7418480	7419480	Well, what do you want to talk about tonight?
7419480	7421680	Cause I think this, you told me a little bit about this beforehand.
7421680	7422680	I thought it was interesting.
7422680	7423680	So
7423680	7424680	yes.
7424680	7430360	So there is, I'm sure there are other ones, but we just found out about a virtual reality
7430360	7435560	gym here where we live and it's kind of interesting.
7435560	7436560	Okay.
7436560	7438700	So it's called black box VR.
7438700	7443580	First of all, it only has two locations according to the website, one in San Francisco and one
7443580	7444800	in Boise.
7444800	7449240	That's it, which is just really random.
7449240	7453080	But in it, it's you play a game basically.
7453080	7458140	And all the like attacks and stuff you do are different types of workouts.
7458140	7467160	Like some are rowing, some are chest presses, some are squats and the game is like a MOBA.
7467160	7472940	So you can send out units, your computer opponent will send out units and there's like an elemental
7472940	7478540	wheel and you can pick units to send out and you have to do to send out a unit.
7478540	7484640	You have to like do different like punches, just quickly for the Twitch people were playing
7484640	7486280	their little commercial.
7486280	7489260	That is the best kind of thing that you can sort of see it in action, like how this whole
7489260	7490260	thing works.
7490260	7491260	Yeah.
7491260	7492260	But it is their commercial.
7492260	7494320	That is pretty cool.
7494320	7496340	And yeah, it's, it's a lot of fun.
7496340	7502220	In fact, I kind of forget that I'm working out except I get tired so quick because I
7502220	7504820	hate working out.
7504820	7508920	But you've got like two force fields on the side of your crystal and they have two force
7508920	7513500	fields and you basically have to break down at least one of the force fields using these
7513500	7519220	different workouts in order to attack the crystal and if you break their crystal, then
7519220	7521780	you win that round.
7521780	7527060	And it goes for about three rounds per person you fight, but they'll send out different
7527060	7529720	types of units that have different elements attached.
7529720	7537820	So you have to counter them and it's, it's a lot of fun and I really can't stress how
7537820	7539860	awesome it is.
7539860	7547060	All I gotta say though, just normally playing VR stuff and then watching that last, the
7547060	7554100	last seconds of that clip where he's wiping his sweat off of his brow, I hope they disinfect
7554100	7556460	those headsets pretty well.
7556460	7559980	I hope that there's like, I assume they do.
7559980	7566140	They're not sparing any expense it feels like because they're using Vive Pros and they have
7566140	7571040	little things that attach to your hands and they have this like box once you're done that
7571040	7575700	like sanitizes everything and you keep the little wristbands but not the attachments
7575700	7576700	that go on them.
7576700	7579020	They give you a headband.
7579020	7580220	It's pricey though.
7580220	7584980	We're doing a 30 day free trial right now, but they've, I guess they're pretty new because
7584980	7589580	they've kind of fluctuated in price and they're still taking feedback to send to their engineers
7589580	7592880	on like, well this is too hard or this isn't working right.
7592880	7599340	But like for a 30 day membership where you go as much as you want, it's like $240.
7599340	7605420	Yeah, but it's been jumping around in price because I guess when they started it was over
7605420	7606700	$300.
7606700	7613260	So doing the 30 days is fine because we have unlimited for those 30 days.
7613260	7617460	And I don't know, Dustin really seems to like it and wants to continue it.
7617460	7620060	I'm like, that's pretty pricey, but it's fun.
7620060	7626420	There's an app, you unlock special rewards, you unlock new units to use, which is really
7626420	7631420	unlocking new workouts, which is terrible when you think of it that way.
7631420	7637100	But yeah, I did, I'm opening up my app right now, if it would load quicker.
7637100	7640540	Let me get some comments in chat while you get that ready.
7640540	7643220	You can take this home or do you do it at the gym?
7643220	7648140	You do it at a specialized location, but there's an app that you can track all your stats,
7648140	7652860	you set up your next appointment, you buy things with coins that you earn from playing.
7652860	7656020	I would just want something I could do at home.
7656020	7660620	Fifth Dream in chat had the exact same comment that Loki had, Oh man, I hope they wiped those
7660620	7663340	goggles down really well between customers.
7663340	7666380	Yeah, I'm pretty sure they do.
7666380	7669540	Thour66 says, I think this is coming in the Montreal area.
7669540	7674460	I read about it in the paper, but to be fair, this isn't the only type of VR gym thing that's
7674460	7675460	out there.
7675460	7678420	So it may be this, but it may be like a competing brand, right?
7678420	7680420	Yeah, probably.
7680420	7686940	So I pulled up my stats and just for today, for example, it tells me how many punches
7686940	7689380	I did, how many reps I did sets.
7690300	7691300	I don't know what volume is.
7691300	7695700	I should have asked, but whatever it is, I did 12,000 pounds of it.
7695700	7700580	And it also shows you your areas that you worked out the most per your session.
7700580	7705780	So like today I basically did just my back and then a little bit of my arms and my knees
7705780	7707420	were killing me from last time.
7707420	7708420	So I did no squats.
7708420	7712580	So I have zero in like that area on the graph here.
7712580	7713580	Yeah.
7713580	7714580	Yeah.
7714580	7718700	I'm not surprised that you're getting a heck of a workout when you're doing this though.
7718700	7722460	I mean, like watching all like the resistance, like those things in your arms, because even
7722460	7726360	just playing Beat Saber on my PlayStation VR, like I get tired.
7726360	7730980	My watch recognizes that as workout time when I'm playing it because my heart rate goes
7730980	7732940	so far up when I'm playing it.
7732940	7736660	So I mean, just like the VR gaming in general, I suppose it depends what you're playing.
7736660	7739940	Like if I'm just kind of chill in a no man's sky or Skyrim, I'm probably not.
7739940	7744020	I mean, I'm probably burning more calories than I am playing on a monitor.
7744020	7747620	But like even just like a music game like Beat Saber or that, that one game that feels
7747620	7750360	like you're rollerblading or whatever, like gets a lot of motion.
7750360	7755340	So it's like, I feel like a VR gym set up thing, which is very kind of like a modern
7755340	7756340	thing.
7756340	7758420	I mean, that just really like amps it up even further, you know?
7758420	7761660	Are those things weighted?
7761660	7764880	They do have some weight to them, but they are not actual.
7764880	7769140	Like they don't adjust in heaviness or weight or whatever.
7769140	7770780	They're just there for tracking.
7770780	7775180	I would want something that would hook up to a weight machine of some sort, because
7775180	7777740	I don't like straight up cardio.
7777740	7780620	Well, no, that's the thing.
7780620	7785100	So when Dustin plays, he's more focused on his workout.
7785100	7789340	So he's doing like the actual way to, you know, work out and doing everything right.
7789340	7796020	I just wanted to win, which is bad because so I was doing everything as fast.
7796020	7798940	Maybe I was doing everything as fast as I possibly could.
7798940	7800140	But in doing that.
7800140	7801140	Yeah.
7801140	7803520	OK, so I started out CrossFit, started out.
7803520	7809080	But the software and the equipment, when you're going really fast, when you say I'm doing
7809080	7811780	like really fast chest presses.
7811780	7818920	So the next time I grab the chest press orb and put it in the virtual slot to start it,
7818920	7823620	it actually ups the resistance to make it harder for me, because it saw me just like
7823620	7827000	blaze through these lighter reps of it.
7827000	7832400	And so you actually get more weight the faster you go.
7832400	7838380	But there is, as we learned later, a little virtual button you can press to kind of tailor
7838380	7839380	how you want to do it.
7839380	7844740	So if you want to do lighter weight, but faster reps, you can hit that button and then start.
7844740	7850940	Or if you want to go really hard with heavy weight and fewer reps, you can hit that button
7850940	7851940	too.
7851940	7853160	How does it add resistance, though?
7853160	7855040	Is it hooked up to something else?
7855040	7856040	Yes.
7856040	7859720	So if you saw if the video was up, I don't know if it is.
7859720	7863080	I just saw the two people fake punching.
7863080	7864080	Okay.
7864080	7874160	So there is two hand straps that depending on your attack slash workout you're doing,
7874160	7876160	it actually raises and lowers.
7876160	7882820	So there's some sort of mechanics in that machine that communicate through the software
7882820	7888680	to add the weight for you, because it has to adjust the height of the handles.
7888680	7889680	Oh, I see.
7889680	7892840	It kicks out the back thing too, or the chest thing if you're facing it.
7892840	7894360	It's like a cable machine.
7894360	7895360	Yeah.
7895360	7896360	That's exactly what it is.
7896360	7900600	It's like the standing cable machine, but it looks like it adjusts it based on the difference.
7900600	7901600	Yeah.
7901600	7903000	I've used the cable machines at the gym a lot.
7903000	7904000	I mean, I totally do that.
7904000	7905000	Yeah.
7905000	7906000	So to advise.
7906000	7907000	Not for that kind of money.
7907000	7908000	Yeah.
7908000	7909060	Well, do the 30-day free thing.
7909060	7912200	And like I said, they're adjusting their prices, it seems, since they've been open.
7912200	7913200	It started higher.
7913200	7914200	It's going lower.
7914200	7919900	I assume it'll probably still go lower, because it wasn't really popular when we were there.
7919900	7923960	We were the only two people there out of the eight boxes they had.
7923960	7926880	So it's also a Sunday morning.
7926880	7932140	Questbuster in chat shares, the high pricing doesn't seem that unusual for VR-type attractions
7932140	7933200	from what I'm seeing.
7933200	7937800	The void charge, 30 per visit for adventure-oriented experiences.
7937800	7938800	You know what, though?
7938800	7941760	I think this is one of those things where it's just the technology is kind of expensive,
7941760	7942760	and it's new.
7943320	7945120	The industry's trying to figure itself out.
7945120	7950520	But I honestly think in 10 years, which sounds like a long time, but it's not, but in 10
7950520	7955440	years' time, this is the type of technology that will probably be in many more gyms.
7955440	7957320	It's not going to be a specialty gym.
7957320	7961320	It's going to be the type of thing you see at an established chain, like 24-hour fitness
7961320	7964240	or LA Fitness or whatever it is you have near you.
7964240	7967780	You're going to start to see this type of stuff like you would see a racquetball court
7967780	7968780	or something.
7968780	7973580	I think as the technology progresses, I think it'll probably be more accessible like that.
7973580	7979500	As long as it's still a game style, because even the worker today told us, yeah, there's
7979500	7980500	leagues.
7980500	7984580	Once you do your first two, which we've done now, once you do your third, you are actually
7984580	7986460	ranking up and ranking down.
7986460	7989420	And say you hate squats like I do.
7989420	7998040	Well, there is a person that you have to fight in the game who is weak to all the leg workouts.
7998040	8000680	So that's going to be fun.
8000680	8001680	Huh.
8001680	8006160	This sounds kind of up your alley too, Loki, because you could do laser tag basically.
8006160	8007160	You're kind of workout.
8007160	8010960	I mean, it's not VR, but it's still like you're doing an intense workout.
8010960	8015160	I do dream of a day when they, well, actually I take that back.
8015160	8021960	They do have, I think, I haven't played it in the Disneyland, downtown Disney area or
8021960	8022960	whatever.
8022960	8026960	They do have a VR place that is sort of like laser tag, but it's like PVE stuff.
8026960	8029600	You're just like doing co-op with a team, but you're actually walking through like a
8029600	8032240	maze and fighting like stormtroopers and shit.
8032240	8039360	But I do dream of a day like AR laser tag where this is our holodeck.
8039360	8040360	But I'll be perfectly honest.
8040360	8045400	I mean, I would want something like this that I could do at home and stop it, you know,
8045400	8049560	but I just keep thinking that it would end up being really overwhelming for me with my
8049560	8050720	sensory issues.
8050720	8055080	You know, it's clearly not meant for autistic people.
8055080	8059680	If it's as flashy as what they were showing the video content to look like.
8059680	8060680	It's not.
8060680	8062120	I mean, that's an attraction video.
8062120	8063120	Yeah.
8063120	8064120	So it's not that flashy.
8064120	8069360	But virtual environments can be overstimulating anyway for an autistic person because it's
8069360	8071400	not just the visual input.
8071400	8074560	You're also dealing with the electric input, the heat, the pressure.
8074560	8076240	You've got a lot more than that you're dealing with.
8076240	8080160	And I would want something that I could like pause.
8080160	8085920	They do have an emergency stop, but yeah, it's, um, each session is 30 minutes and it
8085920	8089940	actually like, you know, I thought so too.
8089940	8094320	And I like you said with you, with those sorts of issues, it might actually be too long because
8094320	8096080	of all the stuff that's going on.
8096080	8101080	But for me, I was like in the middle of my third battle and I won because I was ahead
8101080	8102480	and I was like, wait, I didn't finish.
8102480	8103900	I want to keep going.
8103900	8108480	This is terrible for people that want to win at stuff terrible.
8108480	8112320	And to Jamie's point, this is all still like, and again, you say this only exists in two
8112320	8113320	different places.
8113320	8117000	This whole, this whole thing is kind of like uncharted territory.
8117000	8119860	Like we kind of look at it as gamers going like, okay, wow, cool.
8119860	8122880	This is like a workout thing to the next level, but there's still a lot to figure out.
8122880	8125660	I mean, we're trying to figure out what's the right price.
8125660	8128840	And then I think another question that's going to be asked with this is how do we make it
8128840	8132880	accessible to more people is going to be, you know, another question which would include,
8132880	8135760	you know, include these sorts of questions that you're raising.
8135760	8142640	What I want is sensory deprivation, weightlifting, because when I, um, when I lift, when I was
8142640	8146480	lifting heavy, you know, now that I've got the okay to go back and do it, I'm going to,
8146480	8152680	but I would, uh, close my eyes or wear a sweat band over my eyes so that I could focus on
8152680	8158440	how my body felt and not have any click clank over in the side or any bright lights or loud
8158440	8161480	music, um, interrupting my own progress.
8161480	8164240	Have you ever done one of those like water tank things?
8164240	8168280	I desperately want to, um, curious, I say sensory deprivation.
8168280	8169640	That's where my mind goes.
8169640	8172860	I really want to do a sensory deprivation tank because it's supposed to be the most
8172860	8174120	relaxing thing ever.
8174120	8177680	Um, but I mean, I kind of, I re I liked the concept.
8177680	8182640	I really liked the concept and me having a little bit of, you know, a background in having
8182640	8186760	done heavy weightlifting, it sounds really interesting and very motivating to a lot of
8186760	8187760	people.
8187760	8191340	I just don't know if, you know, it would be the right thing for me.
8191340	8195700	And on top of that, I would really be worried about people, Shane, no shade on you, but
8195700	8199960	I would be really afraid for people who are not paying attention to their form and are
8199960	8204420	not doing the exercises correctly because that is how you injure yourself.
8204420	8205660	Crossfit.
8205660	8206660	Definitely true.
8206660	8207660	Definitely true.
8207660	8212840	Crossfit has a big problem going on with that and I, you know, people will preach Crossfit
8212840	8215940	like they preach veganism, you know, it's their religion.
8215940	8218980	Guess who's husband has recently gotten into that bandwagon.
8218980	8223980	At any rate though, the Crossfit also is fairly dangerous if you're not paying attention to
8223980	8228060	your form and a lot of people will try to push their reps over and over, over paying
8228060	8232120	attention to, are they doing these exercises correctly?
8232120	8237060	You know, I know someone who had to take a break out of Crossfit because of torn ligaments
8237060	8242040	in her shoulder, you know, people injuring themselves because they're not paying attention
8242040	8245460	to form because all they want to do is hit those numbers, hit those numbers.
8245460	8248500	And that's a big problem I foresee with this service.
8248500	8256700	Well, what I will say, just to talk about that for a second, I think what you're saying
8256700	8261620	is a hundred percent true and the best I think that they can do is kind of the stuff they
8261620	8263300	have already implemented.
8263300	8268460	Every time you pick a workout, it's showing you a video as it's loading up and if you
8268460	8273280	try to cheat and really just, you know, go at it without paying attention to your form
8273280	8278000	at all, it doesn't know exactly that you're cheating, but if it feels like you're not
8278000	8283000	doing it right, because I may have done some of that today, it will say, you've got to,
8283000	8288120	you've got to stop in and check your form and it won't actually let you attack or account
8288120	8295040	for anything you're doing until you get back into what it believes is the correct form.
8295040	8297880	So they try at least.
8297880	8302240	And it's still probably uncharted territory in many ways, like, you know.
8302240	8306320	Now I would assume it would have like a profile for you, of course, but doesn't save anything
8306320	8313960	like body dimension, like your weight, your height, your hip to foot ratio, things like
8313960	8319000	that, so that it can accommodate for maybe having, like for me, I got short stubby little
8319000	8320620	hobbit legs.
8320620	8325660	My squat's going to go a lot lower than the average person, you know, but I have a bit
8325660	8327140	taller of an upper body.
8327140	8331440	So if I'm going to do say, hold on, I'm trying to do this on the camera, like, you know,
8331480	8336600	a shoulder press, my shoulder press is going to go a little bit taller than it might be expected
8336600	8342160	of my height. So, you know, the only thing really, I want to kind of deep dive on this one
8342160	8345160	now. I'm going to do a lot of research on it because it's very fascinating to me.
8345520	8346960	So, so two things to that.
8347240	8350640	One, they only ask for your height and weight when you sign up.
8350800	8356200	And when you go in there, it has you center your head so it can like accurately gauge if
8356200	8358080	you're right about how tall you are for these.
8358080	8363080	So I'm guessing it's, it's assuming that you are of average proportions, so to speak.
8363320	8368640	But the thing is, since it's still really new, every time you're done with it,
8368920	8372160	the app asks you for feedback for that stuff.
8372360	8380240	And the employees there have both times so far, like asked for feedback as to what's
8380240	8383560	working, what can be improved, stuff like that.
8383560	8391600	So I think for someone like you who wants it to go even further and it should go further,
8392280	8398160	maybe, maybe trying out that 30-day trial and just going down there once to tell them,
8398160	8400880	hey, this is what I noticed that you should be doing.
8401040	8402920	It's a good drive going to San Francisco.
8402920	8407280	Yeah, well, yeah. I mean, if you were going there for whatever reason already, like if
8407280	8409280	you're just taking like a weekend trip or something.
8409440	8415280	I will say I'm all for this gamification of exercising, and I'm sure this is just like,
8415280	8420960	you know, the next step, because I would say, you know, it's this or it's Wii Fit or it's,
8420960	8424360	you know, now we've got the Resistance band, right?
8424360	8428560	The Nintendo, what did I, what was the nasty name I gave it the other week on the show?
8428560	8429760	The Nintendo Strap-On.
8429760	8433680	The Nintendo Strap-On thing for your leg, because you strap it on your legs.
8433680	8434480	It's the Nintendo Strap-On.
8434480	8435480	Yes, OK.
8436360	8442280	So there's that or, you know, I'm really excited right now because we're starting a walking
8442280	8447280	challenge at work tomorrow, and I'm going to get all those steps in and be my co-workers.
8448560	8451360	So, you know, gamification, it goes a long way.
8451360	8453680	And we're starting the mindfulness challenge at work.
8453680	8458880	So is that, oh, is that the 10 minutes of the Breathe app and using a guided meditation?
8459120	8459480	Fun.
8459960	8461720	So kind of the reverse.
8462360	8465920	But no, thank you for thank you definitely for bringing that up to us, because I think
8465920	8469600	that it's an amazing concept.
8469600	8473760	I kind of saw something like this eventually happening, and I'm glad that they did.
8473760	8475720	It will definitely get more people into being active.
8475720	8479080	And I feel like this one company probably isn't the only one like it's the one that
8479080	8480960	Shane got to see and is reporting on.
8480960	8483440	But I have a feeling there's others very similar.
8483440	8484160	You know what?
8484160	8489920	Another application for something I think could definitely be incorporated into hospital,
8489920	8492920	hospice services, things like physical rehab.
8493600	8497800	Imagine having something like that for people who are just like, oh, this is boring.
8497800	8498760	This is boring. It's boring.
8498760	8503560	But you give them a virtual environment in which to motivate themselves to participate
8503560	8508560	in their physical therapy and then give them some sort of, you know, reward for actually.
8508560	8510320	I mean, my dad would probably need that.
8510320	8512240	He never wanted to do his physical therapy.
8512560	8516040	But if he got a reward out of like say that he did all of this physical therapy and he
8516040	8520080	got to get a snack out of the snack machine, my dad would be happy as a, you know,
8522280	8526240	Mr. Smoosh with the feeder broken and just piling food everywhere.
8526520	8528400	That's how happy my dad would be.
8528960	8529320	Okay.
8530040	8533480	Shane, before I let you go, I don't see any other callers waiting in the green room.
8533480	8537080	Again, if you do want to be on orange on radio tonight, head on over to the green room on
8537080	8540320	our discord server over at vognetwork.com slash discord.
8540520	8542600	That's VOGnetwork.com slash discord.
8542800	8547080	But before I let you go, Shane, any other gaming things going on you want to talk about
8547080	8547680	here on the show?
8550360	8556760	I accidentally started WoW again because I was on Ambien, I guess was really the best
8556760	8557640	explanation.
8559400	8563960	And I'm naming my character after the good place, which is great.
8564320	8571160	And I have a huge backlog of games and I just keep playing the goose game instead.
8571320	8572120	I don't even care.
8572280	8572880	Oh, yeah.
8572920	8574120	Quickly on the goose game.
8574120	8575760	Cause you said this is like the best video game.
8575760	8576040	Oh, no way.
8576040	8577680	You talked about this last week already, didn't you?
8577960	8579240	Yeah, I did.
8579800	8580760	Congratulations.
8580760	8584280	I finally broke my ban on Epic and got it.
8584600	8586320	It's going to be worth it.
8586440	8588160	So I can play it on my Mac.
8589280	8590880	It's just the funniest game.
8590880	8594040	I'm going to be at work on lunch playing the freaking goose game.
8594360	8594960	You're coworkers.
8594960	8597120	Just make sure to wear headphones.
8597200	8600160	I'm not the only one who plays games at lunch though at work.
8600200	8602080	Yeah, you used to get a coworker that did Diablo three.
8602200	8603560	Yeah, a couple of do Diablo.
8603560	8606080	Some people who've done cause Borderlands plays on Mac.
8606160	8607000	Oh yeah.
8607040	8608240	So, all right, cool.
8609040	8609480	All right.
8609600	8610400	Well, Shane, take care.
8610400	8610960	I'm going to let you go.
8610960	8611280	Okay.
8612120	8612360	Okay.
8612360	8614360	And everybody watched the Pokemon stream on Friday.
8614360	8615400	It's 24 hours.
8615400	8616480	Who knows what it's going to be?
8617120	8617920	It's a mystery.
8617960	8618160	All right.
8618160	8618480	Bye.
8618720	8618920	Yep.
8618920	8619200	Bye.
8620000	8620320	All right.
8620320	8621520	Oh, this'll be fun.
8621800	8622600	Oh gosh.
8622600	8625320	If this is who the label says it is, this is going to be so much fun.
8625560	8626880	Uh, let's go to the phones.
8627040	8627360	Hi.
8627360	8628280	You're on orange on radio.
8628280	8628840	Who's this?
8629800	8631040	This is Jim Sally motherfucker.
8631040	8632240	I'm back from the past.
8632560	8635160	Jim Sally is back, bitch.
8635160	8636280	I thought you were dead.
8637520	8638840	I was for a little while.
8639440	8639720	Wow.
8639720	8640640	Ooh, and the quality.
8640640	8645880	See, a lot of people give a shit for ditching Skype, but the quality, like Jim
8645880	8647560	Sally's coming through an HD now.
8647560	8648040	I love it.
8649360	8649960	Listen, brother.
8649960	8653240	It was so much easier before when I could use the fucking regular telephone.
8653600	8654520	I know.
8654920	8655280	I know.
8655280	8656400	Thanks for complicated now.
8657400	8658760	And I'm fucking dude.
8658800	8662800	I'm a little bit baked and I had to think of asking me if I was a robot.
8662800	8664480	And I'm like, dude, I'm not a robot.
8664520	8665960	And it was like, look at this picture.
8665960	8667600	And where's the traffic lights?
8667600	8668760	And I'm like, I don't know, man.
8669040	8670560	But look, you can see us.
8671040	8671600	We're a video.
8671600	8673280	What do you think of OLRB video now?
8674600	8675600	Dude, it was pretty crazy, man.
8675600	8678840	When I was watching fucking Bobby Black Wolf before, man, Jesus Christ, Bobby
8678840	8680280	Black Wolf looks a little bit Wolfie.
8680520	8681440	You forget sometimes.
8682200	8683080	You forget sometimes.
8683080	8684280	That's a compliment though.
8684440	8685880	Bobby Black Wolf's a good looking man.
8686720	8687720	He has a good looking man.
8687720	8690600	And when I hear his voice, I picture like a smooth Debonair, like, you know,
8690600	8693760	little short hobbit, he sort of, but still smooth and Debonair techie boy.
8694040	8695240	And then you see him now.
8695560	8699360	Shit, son, put that man in a moped and I'm stepping back.
8699720	8700560	That's all I'm saying.
8701240	8702200	That's all I'm saying.
8702800	8704760	Well, what, what the hell have you been up to?
8705040	8707800	What's been new over the past two years, however long it's been.
8708080	8708840	Jeez, man.
8708840	8709560	A couple of years.
8709560	8712960	Uh, I was, I was working at a marijuana farm for a while.
8712960	8716080	Getting that all set up for a couple of years, but it was about an hour away from
8716080	8720480	my house, so it was taking up a lot of my time, Sunday nights, I was always there.
8720800	8723800	There's no wifi service, no OLR, man.
8724040	8727960	And it's not the same listening to it as a podcast when it's not live.
8728440	8729120	I don't know why.
8729760	8730840	It doesn't seem as fresh.
8731080	8736000	It's um, you know, I, I, yeah, the podcast and I've, you know, cause I, I listen,
8736000	8738720	yes, I listen to myself sometimes just because I'm my own worst critic.
8738720	8741920	And I often come up with the ideas on how to do better things when I listen to this
8741960	8742920	when I listen to this show.
8743080	8745920	I think part of the fun is that you do kind of feel like you could influence
8745920	8748320	things through the chat room and stuff like that, where it's like, when you're
8748320	8751040	listening on the podcast, you can't really change anything.
8751080	8753200	You know, you can't influence the show on the fly.
8753440	8757760	We have had complete fucking utter derailments of this entire fucking show
8757760	8761200	that have happened because of a chat comment, you know, and when you're on the
8761200	8765600	podcast, although, sure, we, we still, we invite the tweets, we invite the emails.
8765840	8770000	It's not, I fully admit it's not quite the same when it isn't playing out live.
8770000	8770360	You know?
8773240	8773800	Yeah, man.
8773800	8775920	I know that I got my weekends back to myself.
8775920	8779440	I want to spend a little more time listening and calling in, man.
8779760	8780240	Well, good.
8780240	8781200	It's so good to hear from you.
8781440	8781920	I'm good.
8782280	8784360	Dude, I'm getting the game life back on.
8784720	8785160	Yeah.
8785200	8787840	So I was able to get my gaming life back together and I bought
8787840	8789920	this thing called a PS4.
8790080	8791520	Have you ever heard of this thing?
8791800	8795640	It went up from a three to a four, apparently, while I was away.
8796160	8798560	How far north in Canada are you?
8798560	8800640	It's too far.
8800640	8801400	You forget, man.
8801400	8804840	It's far, man, but it's fucking far.
8806360	8808880	I'm still living on the same goat farm that I lived on before.
8810000	8810200	No.
8810200	8813360	So the way in her majesty's Bush, we're not so the way in her majesty's Bush.
8813360	8818080	Cause I like to tell people, you live out the goat's real fat, but a girl's
8818080	8820200	go fat munching on her majesty's Bush.
8820480	8821840	Bitch don't pay no rent though.
8822520	8826680	That much put, put her face on the 20 and pay me.
8827680	8832920	While you've been working out in the Bush at the grass farm, what have you
8832920	8834920	been playing on the PlayStation four?
8835480	8838440	Well, I went out and I got, I got the fallout.
8838520	8840880	I got the fallout four, which is unbelievable.
8840880	8842320	I can't believe how amazing it is.
8842320	8844640	I just lose myself in the inside that world.
8844680	8845320	It's crazy.
8845400	8848280	The evil things that you can do to people with police around.
8848280	8849840	It's it's just spectacular.
8850160	8855240	But then I tried to play the fallout 76 and fuck, man, people are evil, man.
8855320	8856560	I can't play folks.
8856600	8860680	They should go follow 76 and follow fucking shoot Jim Sally in the face.
8860920	8863800	Cause every time I grow up with somebody, I think it's going to be a nice, Hey,
8863800	8866840	I'm going to use my, I did, I stumble around and I try to get the fucking
8866840	8868280	handshake emoji on and shut off.
8868280	8871600	The motherfucker will shoot my hand off and then kill me and steal my shit.
8871800	8872960	Like, wow, this is a great game.
8873400	8874160	This is a great game.
8874160	8876080	I get to be an NBC from followed for it.
8876360	8880120	Isn't that the worst when you try to go and do like the handshake emo and then
8880120	8882600	you accidentally do the one that's the middle finger instead.
8882600	8887320	Uh, and I don't want to be like cruel because you know, I know it's kind of
8887320	8892160	profiling and shit because I'm sure most people playing that game are a dick, but
8892160	8893560	there should be some sort of like mode.
8893560	8895720	I have where people know it's Jim Sally and not a dick.
8895760	8896680	Like you should be cool.
8896680	8900760	And I roll up on, have you thought about changing your PlayStation
8900760	8902280	four name to Jim Sally?
8902280	8902880	Not a dick.
8903960	8906960	I tried that, but then I got this thing that said it was bad.
8906960	8908360	Cause you can't have a dick in your name.
8908360	8909440	So I tried cock.
8910040	8910960	I tried pennant.
8911000	8911960	I tried penis.
8912120	8912560	That didn't work.
8912560	8913640	I tried 10, 15.
8913840	8917600	I tried to do about it, man.
8918200	8918840	Like shit.
8919160	8920680	I'm fucking behind the times, man.
8920920	8921800	I'm behind the times.
8921880	8924200	I just learned like, I just learned about Twitch today.
8925400	8926120	Well, welcome.
8926160	8928040	It's a, it's a beautiful world here.
8928280	8929960	Uh, this is unbelievable, man.
8930160	8933640	Fifth dream today in chat says the PVP has calmed down a lot since the early days.
8933840	8935120	Way less griefing.
8935120	8939280	And we have multiple suggestions for a former, a chatter from back in the day.
8939280	8944120	Pen 15 is another way you could do it, which is also a show on Hulu that
8944120	8945920	extra for like made me watch.
8945960	8947960	And it's pretty fucking funny anyway.
8950800	8955360	Oh, so Jim Sally, is there anything on your PlayStation four wishlist?
8955760	8956960	Like things you want to play?
8958000	8958960	Well, that's the thing, right?
8958960	8960320	Cause I'm just getting back into it now.
8960320	8962760	So I know that Christmas time is coming, which means all the old
8962760	8963920	games are going to be for sale.
8964120	8967640	I already bought the new grand tourismal Jesus Christ.
8967640	8969360	I was melting away on the grand tourismal.
8969880	8970960	I can't believe it.
8971000	8971680	You just fall.
8971960	8975720	And then I thought for the longest time that I was the greatest racer of all time.
8975720	8976360	I couldn't believe it.
8976360	8978080	I was flying through the corners.
8978240	8979200	Nothing could stop me.
8979240	8980280	Everything was perfect.
8980600	8984800	And then my friend came over and I played on his profile and I couldn't do it.
8984800	8985760	And I said, what's going on?
8986320	8988280	And he said, you got it on girlfriend mode.
8988840	8989960	What the fuck are you talking about?
8990000	8990800	Girlfriend mode.
8990800	8995400	And he explained to me, it was all like auto-breaking and no damage.
8996160	9003960	You know what, that mode got some strong feedback for what, what it was being called.
9003960	9006480	But, um, also, uh, there's no shame.
9006480	9009480	I think in playing video games on an easy mode, especially if you just want to
9009480	9013240	experience the narrative or the story, you know, um, but yeah, I mean, you're not
9013240	9016320	going to maybe get trophies or be able to say, Oh, I got the best score.
9016480	9018560	Cause you know, you're playing on an easier mode.
9018960	9022080	Um, you did make me think of something though that we didn't have in tonight's
9022080	9024880	show role, but as maybe like a little bit of a last minute story.
9025120	9028640	Since you are, you know, a little newer on the PlayStation four bandwagon, you
9028640	9032640	know, you're not the only one, uh, some of the games are coming down in price.
9032800	9034880	In fact, just two days ago, Jim Sally.
9034880	9042720	So recently this week, they have reduced the, the price because they have put some
9042720	9050760	new games in the greatest hits package PlayStation, so new games, 20 bucks for
9050760	9056000	these games, 20 American far cry four.
9056040	9061760	Just so you know, we call that a queenie God of war, Gran Turismo sport, Rayman
9061760	9068320	legends, the crew uncharted, the lost legacy and watchdogs are all down to 20
9068320	9068720	bucks.
9069360	9071800	Dude, I'm set the original watchdogs.
9071840	9073320	Yeah, I guess the original for whatever.
9073640	9074960	I think I bought that for 20 bucks.
9075000	9077600	Like a few years ago.
9079480	9082280	Is it going to be the super additions though, where I get all the extra bonus
9082280	9082640	shit?
9083520	9089560	Um, sometimes like, I know, like I just saw at a target or one of those places,
9089560	9093640	like the horizon zero Dawn, which, which is a game I've been meaning to try.
9093640	9096120	It's another one of those like open world exploration games.
9096120	9101840	It's got, if you like fall out of my piece of delicious 20 bucks and it was
9101840	9103160	the worst game and the DLC.
9103200	9103440	Yeah.
9103440	9103800	Right.
9105960	9107560	I love two games, man.
9108000	9108640	I love it.
9109040	9111200	I got a little boy.
9111200	9111840	I got a little boy.
9111840	9112520	It's four years old.
9112520	9112960	Daniel.
9112960	9116400	It's just like daddy, a little fucking little mini fucking captain America.
9116400	9117080	Oh, I love him.
9117400	9120440	And sometimes you get into the game bins and I used to always have a hard time
9120440	9123240	looking in those fucking game bins and shit because there's a lot of games in
9123240	9126040	the fucking game bins because you know, what's great at finding games in the
9126040	9128440	game bins for your old Johnny, you fucking pick them up.
9128440	9130480	You put them right in the middle and he fucking digs in there.
9130480	9132800	Like it's a fucking ball pit comes up.
9133720	9134360	What'd you got there?
9134360	9134880	Motherfucker.
9135080	9142200	I got the motherfucker follow with Daniel and Tony.
9142480	9145880	I put the sticker from the cheap game on it and see if we can get the cheap.
9146080	9146960	I said, God damn it.
9146960	9148040	That's a good boy.
9148480	9151480	You put it, that's when you let them ride in the little basket of the cart.
9151880	9152520	You know what I mean?
9152520	9154880	Proud little ride, a little basket of the cart.
9155880	9157320	Maybe push them across the parking lot.
9157320	9158040	See what happens.
9159040	9159840	Good job, son.
9160280	9161880	God, I fucking missed your calls.
9161880	9164680	Those are the kind of moments you can have together with your boy.
9164680	9168440	Loki, do you let your children go Walmart dumpster diving in those?
9168480	9171200	That's why they're just dumpsters where they put all the, I mean, they're not
9171200	9174520	like actual dumpsters, but they just put all the cheap Blu-rays and all the games
9174520	9175840	go in those big Walmart dumpsters.
9175840	9176920	Do you let them go dumpster diving?
9176920	9178440	Oh, they don't care about any of that stuff.
9178440	9178800	They want it.
9178800	9182040	They want to play the demo kiosk for the Nintendo switch for games that we already
9182040	9183840	have at home that they just got done playing.
9184480	9186680	You got a Pavlov dog, those motherfuckers, man.
9186680	9187640	You take them to the Walmart.
9187640	9190240	It's got the McDonald's built right in and you tell them you want a cone.
9191240	9198000	I always look at the closeout stuff, but they always have like, it's like Titan
9198000	9198880	fall two or something.
9198880	9199760	I'm like, I already own that.
9199760	9201920	I don't, I don't need another copy of Titanfall two.
9201960	9205760	If we gave our episodes titles, I would say this week would definitely be that a
9205760	9208160	Pavlov dog, that dog, that motherfucker.
9208440	9210520	You got a Pavlov dog, that motherfucker, man.
9210520	9211600	Kids are dumb, man.
9211680	9213680	How about that fucking shit, man?
9214000	9215280	Jim Sally, man.
9215600	9218880	I have missed you so much on this program, but I do have to let you go so we can
9218880	9219600	wrap things up.
9219920	9221560	I hope to God we hear from you again, though.
9222600	9222880	Dude.
9222880	9223200	Yeah, man.
9223200	9225440	I'm going to get my Twitch and my fucking discord game on Pat.
9225920	9226960	Try to figure out some shit.
9227080	9229840	I saw some fucking live streaming channels or some shit on you.
9229840	9230480	Fucking shit.
9230480	9231400	I should be checking out.
9231640	9233320	You should get into live streaming.
9233440	9233680	Now.
9233680	9237120	I just said earlier in the show, don't get into live streaming to make money, but Jim
9237120	9240080	Sally, you're like, you're going to be like Ninja two.
9240120	9240800	I just know it.
9242680	9245280	Well, I'm going to go karate chop the fuck out of the night, man.
9245600	9245960	All right.
9245960	9247160	Some good nights, brothers.
9247400	9247720	All right.
9247720	9248600	Take care, my friend.
9249280	9249920	Later, boys.
9253680	9255160	I love hearing from Jim Sally.
9255240	9256040	That was the best.
9256200	9256960	That made my night.
9258080	9261160	We're not going to take any more calls because nothing else is going to top that.
9261160	9265440	But if you want to send us an email, you sure can participate at orange
9265440	9268800	lounge, radio.com, uh, make our soccer work next week.
9268840	9270480	Y'all gave her the night off tonight.
9270480	9273720	So, uh, make our soccer work and read your emails next week.
9273760	9274200	Girl.
9274680	9277240	So if we don't get emails next week, though, we need to think of something
9277240	9278280	other than drag race talk.
9279280	9280400	Um, karaoke.
9280400	9280920	No, I'm kidding.
9280960	9282640	I won't torture Loki anymore.
9282680	9283920	Um, let's see.
9283920	9285840	I would say food talk, but we did that anyway.
9286440	9288200	Um, guess what my mom sent me?
9288560	9291720	Oh, my mom sent me a Southern care package.
9292640	9298840	They contained two bags of waffle house grits, two cans of boiled peanuts, and
9298840	9305480	it's B O I L T P dash N U T S if you're from the South and some, uh, jambalaya
9305480	9310320	mix and I am a happy little mud bug.
9310840	9311080	All right.
9311080	9313960	Well, we'll think of some site type of appropriate punishment during the week.
9313960	9316280	Crawl dads, mud bugs, mud bugs.
9316440	9316760	All right.
9317400	9317800	All right.
9317960	9322400	Well, we're going to wrap up the show so we can head on out and, uh, yeah.
9322440	9323680	Uh, thank you though.
9323720	9324840	Of course, as always for you.
9324840	9327080	So actually, wait, I didn't check for any other last minute stories.
9327080	9328840	I re I did one, but I don't know if you have any others.
9328840	9329120	Loki.
9329160	9330200	Um, I had a couple of things.
9330200	9335680	So, uh, the first one is the composer, um, Bobby Prince, who wrote music for
9335680	9341280	such games as doom, doom two Wolfenstein 3d, and most notably Duke Nukem 3d has
9341280	9347160	filed a lawsuit against gearbox software and Randy Pitchford and valve claiming
9347160	9351920	that his music was used in, uh, Duke Nukem 3d 20th anniversary world tour
9351920	9355080	without his permission and without him receiving compensation.
9357000	9359640	Oh, so he's saying in exchange.
9359760	9366320	Um, that he's requiring that a royalty of a dollar per unit sold be, um, given to
9366320	9366560	him.
9367080	9368920	So we'll have to see what happens with that.
9369280	9369600	Yeah.
9370400	9374000	And then last but not least, there is a new shooting collection.
9374000	9375520	That's coming to the Nintendo switch.
9375600	9381520	The, uh, psycho shooting stars alpha, which is coming here.
9381520	9388920	It's got strikers, 1945, uh, looks like strikers, 1945, three, um,
9388920	9395400	zero gunner to dragon blaze, uh, strikers, 1945, two and sold divide.
9397280	9398040	Looks pretty cool.
9398040	9402680	If you like your classic arcade shooter games and that's coming out January 24th,
9404120	9407960	I'm sorry, that's in Europe, uh, North America's game, January 21st.
9409240	9411600	Um, I have another quick little last minute story.
9411600	9414880	So metal mayhem was sharing this in our discord and usually I don't share all the
9414880	9417240	sales and everything cause there's a lot of sales are going out there.
9417440	9419960	This one's a little bit interesting though, because, um, devolver is doing a
9419960	9421280	sale through good old games.
9421600	9424200	Um, and it's not just games, but it's movies.
9424520	9428360	Um, which I know we sometimes forget that movies go on sale and on platforms and
9428360	9431760	things as well, but then I'm looking at some of these movies and there are things
9431760	9434080	that I haven't really heard of, but they're really cheap.
9434080	9435520	And I imagine these are indie movies.
9435680	9438680	For example, there's a movie called burning man beyond black rock.
9438680	9440400	So I imagine that it's from 2005.
9440400	9444280	So it's a little older at this point, but, um, I imagine there is, uh, you know,
9444480	9445360	like a documentary.
9445680	9449600	Uh, I did not know angry video game nerd made a movie, but it also doesn't surprise
9449600	9451400	me at the same time that is on sale as well.
9451400	9454280	That was about the, uh, et thing.
9455720	9456720	The angry video game nerd.
9456720	9456960	Really?
9456960	9457240	Yeah.
9457360	9457880	Interesting.
9458400	9461640	Um, there's a movie called Austin high, which I think I had heard about that one.
9461840	9463400	I'm trying to see what else is a little newer.
9463400	9464400	I mean, these they're there.
9464640	9467720	A lot of these are older movies cause they are only like a dollar 50 at this point.
9468000	9473120	Uh, pixel poetry, steam dream and good game are from about three years ago.
9473120	9474320	So kind of neat.
9474720	9475560	So there you go.
9475600	9476520	Check those out if you want.
9477200	9482000	So, and a dark to see who wants to point out the games done quick, did a little
9482000	9485160	like a Twitch con edition, GDQX.
9485600	9488480	They raised 150,000 for able gamers.
9488480	9489920	That's what I was talking about earlier.
9489960	9490480	Oh, that's right.
9490960	9492120	We got the final number though.
9492480	9492560	Yeah.
9492560	9495240	They actually exceeded last year's numbers.
9495840	9496080	Yeah.
9496120	9496520	Good job.
9496560	9497680	Able gamers is a good charity.
9497680	9499040	So, um, congrats to able gamers.
9499360	9500000	Yay.
9500240	9501520	Gamers doing good things.
9501560	9503240	That is a great note to end this show on.
9503240	9505520	So we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.
9505520	9506640	But I do want to say thank you.
9506640	9509400	Of course, as always for tuning into Orange Laundrio, thank you for your
9509400	9513160	support of our show, be it on the podcast feed or watching here live on Twitch.
9513320	9515000	We really appreciate you and your support.
9515040	9517840	Um, if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Laundrio, tell a
9517840	9518840	friend or two about the show.
9518840	9521600	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
9521760	9524760	But if the voices aren't here to put on air, what are we to do?
9524880	9528440	So, um, yeah, uh, a nice review, a five star review on one of
9528440	9529440	those sites goes a long way.
9529640	9530840	Hosting on Twitch.
9530840	9532720	I can't stress how magnificent that is.
9532720	9534520	It's discoverability.
9534520	9537800	It's very important and all that's even going to become bigger as Twitch
9537800	9540760	goes through some of these big changes in the next couple of months
9540760	9542320	to their main site design.
9542720	9543200	Anyway.
9543240	9544640	Um, thank you again.
9544640	9546240	So let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
9546240	9546960	I'll start with you tonight.
9546960	9548440	Loki, what do you, what's your final thought?
9548520	9549960	I did work on my game this week.
9549960	9551560	I forgot to mention that in my game week.
9551600	9555880	It was mostly bug fixing because I had done a bunch of changes and didn't.
9556360	9559760	I, cause I had done a bunch of changes, but that was the same time I had
9559960	9562720	deleted the actual pieces of my level.
9563040	9564280	And so then I put them all back.
9564280	9568280	And so they had a lot of stuff to fix because something broke and now it's
9568280	9570400	back up to where it should be now.
9570760	9573920	And so I can build from that, but that, that was my Saturday.
9574960	9575360	All right.
9575400	9575880	That's awesome.
9576360	9579600	Uh, my final thought for the night is you can't really see it on camera.
9579600	9584400	You can see way in the corner, you see some boxes sticking out just a little bit.
9584400	9587560	You can see it under underneath my golden girls, vinyl pop figures,
9587560	9588920	which is what's on the right side.
9588920	9589600	I got you on this.
9589760	9592240	There's a whole side over there.
9592560	9595600	That's just nothing but boxes and boxes.
9596040	9600400	And what that is, that is grandpa from the Horde house days or captain
9600400	9601880	Matt from starboard power coupling.
9602240	9609920	That is the, that is all pumpkin spice shit of different stuff.
9609920	9612880	I haven't opened it yet because I'm waiting for the last of it to arrive
9612880	9615120	tomorrow and then I'm going to do a Facebook live where I open it all.
9615520	9616800	And then I'm going to come over and help you eat it.
9616800	9619960	I'm kind of scared, but I'm also like, that's a lot of waste.
9620160	9622440	Like, why couldn't it just be in one fucking box?
9622640	9624720	Like, but you know what?
9624720	9626040	I'm cat condo.
9626120	9627640	You know what he gave me last year?
9628280	9629240	Do you know what he gave me last year?
9629240	9631680	That actually lasts a long time over there.
9631760	9635520	It, uh, it was the syrup and, but the pumpkin creamers, they actually, there
9635520	9640080	was like four boxes of pumpkin creamers gave me a box, I gave you a lot.
9640080	9643840	And then I, I put it out at work and I just invited coworkers to come
9643840	9645360	over and steal them and they did.
9645360	9646400	And you know, it was great.
9646760	9647360	Shared the love.
9647360	9650960	So anyway, uh, all I can say is the classic Jesse Spano line.
9650960	9651800	I'm so excited.
9651800	9652600	I'm so excited.
9652600	9653360	I'm so scared.
9653880	9655760	Last but not least, dark soccer, your final thought.
9656240	9658560	Um, I've got a really busy week.
9658600	9660000	I've got a con guide to finish.
9660000	9661800	I've got Rosh Hashanah service tomorrow.
9661840	9663000	I've got to take mid into the vet.
9663960	9667560	Got a lot of crap on my plate, but I can do it.
9668120	9669040	You can do it myself.
9669080	9669720	I believe in you.
9670480	9671920	And maybe there's another design thing.
9671920	9673240	I might be interested.
9673400	9674000	We'll talk later.
9674000	9676800	Rob, do you believe in life after love?
9677120	9677760	Uh, of course.
9680640	9681120	All right.
9681640	9683480	Anyway, uh, that's it.
9683520	9684240	Bye everybody.
9684280	9684720	Good night.
