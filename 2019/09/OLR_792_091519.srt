00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,280
This week, Monster Rancher is getting remastered and coming to the Switch!

2
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,000
The love of my preteen and teenage years, this is one sim game that's possibly just

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,240
steeped in nostalgia.

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,520
This is just one story, stay tuned for the rest of the week's gaming news starting right

5
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:32,840
now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,840
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back to another week of the show where

7
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:43,200
every gamer has a voice, it is Orange Lounge Radio Live Tonight, episode number 792 for

8
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,260
this September the 15th of 2019.

9
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,600
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me here live tonight is my co-host, Mr. Smoosh, who

10
00:00:52,600 --> 00:01:01,000
is off camera screaming up a storm because Tech Master Loki decided to bring KFC to the

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,080
studio tonight and Mr. Smoosh is one entitled kitty who feels that he should get to have

12
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,480
a piece of that chicken.

13
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,920
I think maybe I'll go step away and see to Mr. Smoosh.

14
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,840
Hi DarkSakura or Jamie Summers, I hope you're well.

15
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,440
She's gonna go be a kitty ant right now and take care of Mr. Smoosh.

16
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:29,960
Okay, here's what's funny about this and why I'm laughing is because Alan, he, okay

17
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,440
apparently, okay, I'm sorry, this is like horrible radio, I'm sorry, this is really

18
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,440
funny what's playing out.

19
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:41,040
Okay, so number one, Alan is out of town right now, he went to, he went to the Midwest for

20
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,040
a work conference, so he's not here, so he's usually gone during the show anyway because

21
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,000
he does stuff on Sunday nights, but he's usually not here, but Mr. Smoosh is usually has a

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,520
shit together because like Alan's around and, you know, able to like take care of him.

23
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,120
But so what happens is that when he's really misbehaving, sometimes we'll put him in the

24
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,200
spare bedroom and we'll shut him in there for, you know, 30 minutes or so and we call

25
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,200
it kitty jail.

26
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,200
Yeah.

27
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,440
And don't worry, we're not cruel, he has water and, you know, he's fine, but like at least

28
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,320
when he's in there, he can't like meow.

29
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:15,240
But DarkSakura, you said, so DarkSakura is the punisher on Sunday nights.

30
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,480
Yeah, well, he also lets me pick him up for five seconds.

31
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,720
So I guess he likes boobs or something, but at any rate, like I, he, you saw him do this.

32
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,280
He started turning and going down the hall and he went into kitty jail by himself and

33
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,320
all I did was shut the door.

34
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,400
That's pretty amazing.

35
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,040
Like he knows he's in trouble.

36
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,320
He just went into kitty jail of his own.

37
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,300
That's like when we get the carrier, like if he has to go to the vet or something, we'll

38
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,480
put the carrier on the ground.

39
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,320
He just walks right in and he's like, all right, I guess it's time.

40
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,540
Like he's not Midna.

41
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:49,140
She's such a weird cat, but like in the best possible way, not Midna.

42
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,300
She's like, Oh, is that thing like to the point that, I mean, I'm, I was thinking I

43
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,380
might have to take her to the vet this week cause she started wheezing last night.

44
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,380
Oh no.

45
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,220
Um, but she hasn't done it at all today.

46
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:03,180
So I think maybe she just got into something or had an allergy attack or something.

47
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:08,780
Um, but I was just thinking that maybe this time I was just going to take her on her leash

48
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,580
instead of put her in the carrier cause she resists the carrier, but she's okay with her

49
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,580
leash.

50
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,180
I have, I have a harness for my cat.

51
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,580
I take her for walks in the backyard.

52
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,580
Well, I have a harness.

53
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,580
Nevermind.

54
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,580
Uh, all right.

55
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:23,860
Well, I just ordered a harness, so, but not for that just because it's fashionable.

56
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:24,860
All right.

57
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,300
It's you were, you were saying you were, it was inspired by K-pop videos.

58
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,300
Yeah, it was.

59
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:33,300
I just like, I kind of like that aesthetic cause it's kind of like on trend right now

60
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:39,020
to wear like interesting, like leather accents or harnesses or things, but you wear it over

61
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:43,140
just like mundane clothes or with something sexy ish.

62
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,140
I don't know.

63
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:50,260
But I was like, I kind of dig that aesthetic and it would go with some of my gothy stuff

64
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,380
and I could wear it for sister outings if we go to the bolt or something.

65
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,380
I don't know.

66
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,220
Not that I'm into that, but I figured it would dress appropriately for a leather bar.

67
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,220
Yes.

68
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,220
Good.

69
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,220
All right.

70
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,220
You just, you just dress dress into impressing.

71
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,220
Uh, going to our chat room because of course we do tape live every Sunday night at the

72
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,660
voice of geeks network, twitch TV slash bog network.

73
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,700
Yes, it is a video game podcast.

74
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,680
You can see the video game topics along there on the side if you're watching live, but sometimes

75
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,100
the cat derails us in the first five minutes of the show.

76
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,960
Um, some of the comments in our chat over at twitch TV slash bog network, tiger claw

77
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,140
says Mr. Smoosh is quite the diva.

78
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,260
Um, pod culture says, damn, that's a loud smoosh.

79
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,260
Try sleeping around here.

80
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,140
I have to sleep with earplugs.

81
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,140
I know.

82
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,780
Oh, don't encourage him.

83
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,780
Um, let's see.

84
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:36,020
Dark Tetsuya says five minutes in and smoosh has already derailed everything.

85
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,020
Love it.

86
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,020
Yeah, you, you love it, but poof.

87
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,340
All right.

88
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,340
Anyway.

89
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,340
Uh, and it's all his fault.

90
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,340
Seriously.

91
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,900
He is loud and shrill for bringing that a KFC that smelled up the room and he felt entitled

92
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,900
to it, but that's okay.

93
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,180
I, I, I meow a lot at the scent of KFC as well.

94
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,300
Say hello to tech master Loki.

95
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:57,220
I didn't want KFC, but the other place in it would have gone to the Korean oven chicken

96
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,220
fried chicken.

97
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,940
Yeah, they were being special today.

98
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:06,540
So they, they had their, they weren't answering their phone, which was inconvenient for me.

99
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,340
They were like closed to that being closed.

100
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,340
Yeah.

101
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,340
So they, they weren't answering their phones.

102
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:13,540
I was like, okay, well I've had this before where I've called a couple of times and they

103
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,540
won't answer and then eventually they will.

104
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:21,860
Um, so they answer the phone, their door is unlocked, but like everything looked like

105
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,300
they're in the middle of construction.

106
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,420
So I'm like, okay, I can hear people in the back.

107
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:31,620
I see the ovens are on you guys open, you know, it's no one answered.

108
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:34,140
So like, okay, I'm leaving with the KFC.

109
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:37,180
There's a lot of churches in the area, so maybe they were doing a catering event or

110
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,180
something.

111
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,020
No, they were like doing some remodeling or something cause they had all the chairs stacked

112
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:46,460
and then they had like some, maybe they're putting central air in bringing the place

113
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,100
up to code after you were complimenting all the delicious chicken.

114
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,100
All right.

115
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,620
Anyway, uh, we're going to get into talking about video games, but I do want to mention

116
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:59,320
if you do want to see all the sites and sounds such as the occasional smush cameo or me pointing

117
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,340
at things along the side of the screen.

118
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:06,780
Of course the audio podcast is free and always has been for the last 17 plus years and will

119
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:10,500
continue to be, but if you want to get in on the video, it just takes a subscription

120
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,940
to VOG network over twitch.tv slash VOG network.

121
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,980
And many of you get one free with your Amazon prime.

122
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,340
But if you don't have Amazon prime or you've already used it somewhere else supporting

123
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:25,620
another fabulous indie streamer, then it is sub-tember and you can get those subscriptions

124
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,620
half off.

125
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,740
So, and every, oh, since we did the switch to video, every OLR is there, every Bobby

126
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,060
black Wolf is there.

127
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,900
Some of the impromptu specials are there.

128
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,800
Like the guys on a dragon con we did last week.

129
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,340
So you can check that out over at twitch.tv slash VOG network.

130
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,740
That's the only time I'm going to hype that though.

131
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,420
Uh, but I have to give that a shout out, um, because you know, there it is.

132
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,260
I also want to shout out dark soccer as cookies that she's holding up on cam.

133
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,260
They were pretty good.

134
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:51,380
Like, you know, sometimes your friends cook things and you're like, I don't know, but

135
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:57,460
your cookies are, are your cookies always deliver these, um, this batch is coffee, chocolate

136
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,460
chip.

137
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,420
And I'm like super happy with them.

138
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,420
Yeah.

139
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,420
They turned out even the burned ones are good.

140
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,420
Am I weird?

141
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:09,460
I like when it's like a little bit burnt, like I like toast a little bit burnt, not

142
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,620
like completely black.

143
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,620
That's gross.

144
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:17,580
But like, just like a little bit burnt, like that dark brown is my oven, not all the numbers

145
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,140
on it work.

146
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,700
So I have to bake it three 50 for my cookies.

147
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,700
That's just how you do it.

148
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,700
Yeah.

149
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,700
Three 58 minutes.

150
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,700
Perfect.

151
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,700
Perfect.

152
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:31,620
I have, because my zero doesn't work normally when I want to do three fifties, I do three

153
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:36,340
51 and automatically adjusted three 50 except now my three isn't working.

154
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:41,300
So I had to cook at four 10 by hitting four one one to get a little enough temperature

155
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,100
and then keep part of the lid open.

156
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:47,380
So I had to like keep watching it, see how the cookies were doing and it was a pain in

157
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,380
the tuchus.

158
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,940
Uh, act after reminding us as well with a little plug there, all subs on Twitch are

159
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,300
half off for September.

160
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,960
And if you use the sub timber bit emote, if you are feeling so generous to donate biddies,

161
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,980
it does give 10% more to the streamer.

162
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,980
Yes.

163
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:04,620
And, um, we, we do put your money back into making VOG better, uh, next on the agenda.

164
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:08,100
And I'm hoping probably by next week, I couldn't get around to it this week as I started the

165
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,380
new job and everything, but I'm hoping in the next week, I'm looking at getting mic

166
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,780
stands for dark soccer and myself at least.

167
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:18,180
Um, so that with our mics, because the adjustment noises, I know sometimes can be really bad

168
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,720
when we're picking up mics and putting them down, um, which is just, we've used handheld

169
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,400
mics for the 17 years we've done this show and because keep in mind, I do hosting on

170
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,400
the side too.

171
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,720
So I do a lot of like hosting gigs.

172
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,240
So like I live and breathe handheld mics.

173
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,680
So I realize a lot of podcasters use the ones that are in place, but that we do, we have

174
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,780
a lot of movement too.

175
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,560
So I don't know if the ones that are totally in place are good, but I do have an idea for

176
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,900
like stands that we can kind of grab the stand and you won't have as much of the adjustment

177
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,900
noise.

178
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,040
So that's something proud of me getting things ready for my streaming setup.

179
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,520
I got a pop cover.

180
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:56,240
I'm going to be even prouder when you start streaming because until you do until you stream,

181
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,840
you are him writing video games, money.

182
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:04,720
How much money did I just throw into things, mister, by the way, this is on sale at Best

183
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,720
Buy.

184
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,720
You should get it.

185
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,400
And I'm like, damn it.

186
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,400
And I got it.

187
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,400
What did I tell you to buy?

188
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,840
I think it was on the dragon con digital media discord.

189
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,320
I saw some sale and I was like, Oh, dark soccer.

190
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,760
It was the stream deck.

191
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,760
Oh yeah.

192
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,800
I love the thing.

193
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,800
We used to switch all the different scenes.

194
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,080
If I want to run, if I want to run B roll of something, I've got the blue hooked up

195
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:30,360
right now, the snowball, and I got a pop cover for it because I pop things a few times.

196
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,200
And I know these mics have not been the greatest on that.

197
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,000
So we are trying to make it better, but it's just, you know, little baby steps.

198
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I have done recording with that mic on my iMac.

199
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,240
I need to hook my iMac back up.

200
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,280
I have my gaming rig set up right now.

201
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,520
But, um, you know, the only delay I see after I get everything started is when we pick up,

202
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,720
um, my new, uh, Mac that I'm going to do a boot.

203
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,720
Nice.

204
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,160
Uh, nifty eight Oh five and chat says I'm going to try and farm some bits at Twitch

205
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,160
con.

206
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:02,080
I want to go to Twitch con so bad, but with having just started the new job, I just, I

207
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,360
don't think I can swing the time.

208
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,280
I'm so sad about it, but Oh, well maybe next year, depending on where they have it.

209
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,320
So anyway, let's get into some gaming news.

210
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,640
We got to, uh, we got to get into it.

211
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,800
So, uh, Tokyo game show happened this past week.

212
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,120
So there was a bit of news that came out of Tokyo game show.

213
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,400
I forgot to ask before the show, Loki to do these.

214
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,760
So I guess I should, cause look, he's going to town on KFC, so I should start as I can

215
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,760
do it.

216
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,760
It's fine.

217
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,760
Oh, you got it.

218
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,760
Okay.

219
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,760
Yes.

220
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,760
Tell us a little bit about what happened to Tokyo game show.

221
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,760
Please.

222
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,760
They showed off games.

223
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,760
They sure did.

224
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,760
There's two big ones.

225
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,760
There's two big ones.

226
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,760
Lots of cosplay.

227
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,760
There's two.

228
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,760
We have some other stuff sprinkled throughout the show, but the two big ones I want to start

229
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,760
off with the two big ones.

230
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,080
Beat me in a 2d X ultimate mobile and sound voltage ultimate.

231
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,320
No, those aren't the ones I actually forgot.

232
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,400
They did have a beat me in a 2d X mobile.

233
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
What?

234
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,400
Okay.

235
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,680
Do you want it's, you know what?

236
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,680
I'll take it.

237
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,480
It's better than nothing, which is what I've got.

238
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,520
I did think it was funny though, when they're like showing them playing on the, um, they

239
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,880
did something, I don't remember what it was.

240
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,880
Something was wrong.

241
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:06,380
But like the first time that they showed the guy playing the game, like just fucking up

242
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,380
all of it.

243
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,440
And it's like, yeah.

244
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,040
For those that don't know, like the roots of our show are in music based video games,

245
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,320
dark soccer, Loki, and I all met playing dance, dance revolution.

246
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,760
So beat mania is like adjacent to that.

247
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,480
So we're always going to make these like tongue in cheek jokes about Konami's music game series.

248
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,560
And when it randomly decides to show up again, well, I shouldn't say randomly because I know

249
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,740
things like sound volt X are still very popular.

250
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,680
You know, I was just a dragon con a couple of weeks ago.

251
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,880
The Tokyo attack brings all those arcade machines and those sound volt X, you know, they're

252
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,880
popular throughout the night.

253
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,200
You don't have to, you beat is hugely popular.

254
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,300
You can get it on my mind.

255
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,840
Is that the one with the round?

256
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,840
Yeah.

257
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,840
Yes.

258
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,840
My mind is really fun.

259
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,840
Yeah.

260
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,840
Yeah.

261
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,120
Well now you can get it on your, your mobile device and they have controllers that you

262
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,120
can buy too.

263
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,360
They had, you know what they put UB on mobile reflect beat had like, I remember having those

264
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,600
in my iPad and they were decent translations, but these actually have physical controllers

265
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,600
now too.

266
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,040
Like 2d X and um, sound voltage.

267
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,040
Okay.

268
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,040
All right.

269
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,200
Cause that'd be weird.

270
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,200
That wasn't what I was planning to talk.

271
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,200
It's all right.

272
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,200
I know.

273
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,240
I appreciate the little aside for our music game loyalists that have been with us throughout

274
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,240
the years.

275
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,240
It's, it's a nice little touch.

276
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,720
I also say I'm super jealous of the dream cast and Sega Saturn bags that they were selling

277
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:27,040
at Tokyo game show just saying do want and um, uh, uh, uh, Genesis or mega drive controller

278
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,040
neck pillow.

279
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:32,040
I'm looking, I've been looking at all like just the stuff that they were selling.

280
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,840
And I also want like the mini Nakururu.

281
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:39,840
So no, one of the big gains, of course they showed off was the font 57 remake and some

282
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,680
cool new things coming out about that.

283
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,120
So, uh, one thing they announced was the classic gameplay options.

284
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:52,480
So if you don't necessarily like the final fantasy 13, uh, type gameplay, you can actually

285
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,960
do turn-based gameplay with menus and all that fun stuff.

286
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:59,920
I actually, um, uh, for those that are watching on Twitch, I prepared some B roll tonight.

287
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,000
I had a lot to do it.

288
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,720
So, uh, this is a little bit of the play through that they were doing at, um, and you can,

289
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,640
you can hear a little bit of it, probably bleed over on the podcast as the audio is

290
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,640
very down.

291
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,760
Um, but you can actually, this is part of them actually, and you hear, if you probably

292
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,360
hear them talking, cause this is them actually like doing a live play through.

293
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,120
So they're actually, and I, you know, the trailer was great.

294
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,200
I watched the trailer.

295
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,760
I encourage many of you to watch the trailer, but a trailer is a trailer.

296
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,000
I like this kind of stuff where you're actually seeing the game in progress.

297
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,800
It looks way better.

298
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,360
I've seen this before though.

299
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,560
They did, um, they did, they did do, um, like something really, well, this was also from

300
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,560
Tokyo Game Shows.

301
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,560
You may have just seen it this week.

302
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,560
No, no, no.

303
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,760
There was another one that they did a few months ago that was talking about what the

304
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,280
first mission was going to be like and how the battle system was going to look.

305
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,280
There you go.

306
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,280
Look, see, it's in wait mode.

307
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,320
And now he, now cloud can choose the ability magic or item.

308
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,320
It kind of pops up there.

309
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,480
So a little taste of what it kind of looks like there, which is great.

310
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,300
I love the way this looks like it's it.

311
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:02,500
I'm in such a weird place with Final Fantasy 7 remake because it looks so fucking good.

312
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,340
Like it just looks like such an evolution of the Final Fantasy engine.

313
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:11,140
And I'm like, okay with the actionist actiony type stuff because they've kind of mixed it

314
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:15,340
a little bit with the more traditional like, but I am totally down for them making remaking

315
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:19,260
six when they, or how about don't remake anything?

316
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,420
Like that's, that was my one hesitation is like, you know, here's the thing.

317
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,420
Yes.

318
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,420
Final Fantasy 7.

319
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,580
I understand a lot of you are attached to it.

320
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:28,420
It was the Final Fantasy when you were like 12 years old or whatever.

321
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:32,040
And it's the one you remember the best, but it's like, I just, I would have loved to see

322
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:38,180
a new game, a new Final Fantasy like this because Final Fantasy 15, like you definitely

323
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:45,500
see like elements of 15 in this, but you don't really see like, I just would have liked to

324
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,840
see like the evolution of that because let's be real what we're looking at here.

325
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:53,860
This is just Final Fantasy 15 engine pushed to the next level is what we're looking at,

326
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,860
but it's running out.

327
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,860
So I gotta go back to us life, but, uh, yeah, so, but my, the Final Fantasy 7 remakes looking

328
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,860
sweet.

329
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:04,220
Like I, despite the fact I'm kind of like, why did they, why did they use all this to

330
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,360
remake seven?

331
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,900
Why can't they just do a 16?

332
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,900
I'm still all about this.

333
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,900
Obviously I'm going to buy it.

334
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:17,580
Obviously like feelings on the story aside, it just looks like a painting in motion.

335
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,580
Like it's just so gorgeous.

336
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,860
It's so goddamn good looking.

337
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,580
I was in my early twenties when it came out.

338
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:31,220
I didn't even own a fucking PlayStation and I bought it and I moved out here with 53.5

339
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:36,900
floppies loaded with nothing but Vincent fan art and Dogenchi.

340
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,900
This is so you.

341
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,140
I'm not even kidding.

342
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,140
And you know what?

343
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,180
I found one of the discs the other day.

344
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:47,220
I have no way to read it, but I found one, um, some comp or some, uh, co-signs for your

345
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,220
thoughts.

346
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,220
Loki in our chat.

347
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,220
Dark Tetsuya says co-signed with Loki.

348
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:53,340
I'd love something like that, but for final fantasy six and quest buster says, I'd be

349
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,220
all over a fantasy six remake on this scale too.

350
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,220
Don't get me wrong.

351
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:02,140
I love final fantasy six and it is weird that they never did the light 3d treatment with

352
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,140
that.

353
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,140
You know, you know what I mean?

354
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:07,060
Like fantasy three, fantasy four kind of got that 3d remake, but they never did it with

355
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:09,260
fantasy six, which I thought was a little weird.

356
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,260
Yeah.

357
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,260
Um, but, uh, okay.

358
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:15,680
They didn't do a pharmacy five either, I guess, but they did those, they did those mobile

359
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,680
ports.

360
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,680
They did the one on the Wii.

361
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,600
They weren't the, the new mobile ports are like the new graphics that were, was that

362
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,660
four that was on the four was on the week.

363
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:29,340
The best version of Final Fantasy four, in my opinion is the PSP one because it was like

364
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:34,760
a remade 2d version and it had after years included, it was, it was a really solid package.

365
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:40,520
Like I would love to see, uh, that game somehow re-released on like PlayStation four or something,

366
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:47,020
you know, it shouldn't be that hard to emulate a PSP game or just, I know I'm totally sounding

367
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:50,880
like ignorant when it comes to game making, but I guess maybe I am like recompile it for

368
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,900
the PS4 versus the PlayStation portable.

369
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,440
Like I realized it's not as easy as pushing a button, but I can't imagine it's going to

370
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,480
take vast amounts of resources either.

371
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,880
I don't know.

372
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,880
They've done it before.

373
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,960
You're saying a PlayStation four can emulate a PSP or anyway, that might be tough.

374
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,200
I mean, I go, I get it.

375
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,560
The cell phone can do that.

376
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:14,080
Like an old ass cell phone could do that, but PlayStation four with its ray tracing

377
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,640
and whatnot, can't handle the sheer power of the PSP.

378
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:24,180
But I'm ready for final fantasy 16 and I am so here for the fan wank where, and I don't,

379
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:28,580
I don't know to what extent these rumors were, you know, sourced or whatever, but there was

380
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:34,800
a big rumor that Naoki Ohshida, who is the producer on Final Fantasy 14, who really saved

381
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,800
that game.

382
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,840
He's the one that came in and turned it into realm reborn and so forth that he was going

383
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:44,440
to hand off Final Fantasy 14, and he's going to be part of the 16 development team.

384
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,980
And I want that to be true.

385
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,280
So fucking bad.

386
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,780
Like if Yoshida got to make a single player Final Fantasy game, and I just, I know I've

387
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:54,540
said this a lot on the show, I'm going to say it one more time.

388
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,900
The expansion storylines in Final Fantasy 14, heaven's words, storm blood, and now shadow

389
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:04,880
bringers are probably some of the best, if not the best, I don't know, Final Fantasy

390
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,420
six is hard to top, but like the best stories in the final fantasy universe.

391
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,920
And because it's an MMO, so few people are going to see them.

392
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,260
And it's, it's a real bummer.

393
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:19,180
So like if they were to let him do a single player Final Fantasy game, Oh my God.

394
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,180
Oh my God.

395
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,180
All right.

396
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,980
I've digressed completely from the Final Fantasy seven remake topic.

397
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:28,340
I'm sorry, but I needed to talk about that important sidebar.

398
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:34,460
So is anyone in here, show of hands, anyone here not interested in the seven remake at

399
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,460
this point?

400
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,120
I had a feeling, dark soccer.

401
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,800
Have you kind of Vincent?

402
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:46,320
Well, well remember episode one don't care Vincent, but he's not going to be in the first

403
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,320
one.

404
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,320
I don't care.

405
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,840
I will eventually have Vincent.

406
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,840
Okay.

407
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,840
Okay.

408
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,920
And I will get to watch the bitch die.

409
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,240
No, you won't.

410
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,240
Not in episode one.

411
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:02,560
As I said, eventually, I can't wait for when they like say, guess what?

412
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,420
We're taking, we're, we're taking the storyline in different directions.

413
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,900
She's not going to die this time.

414
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,900
I'll kill the bitch.

415
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,700
I, I will find a way.

416
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,820
I can't wait.

417
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,300
No, I'm putting this out there.

418
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,780
I'm going to put it in the atmosphere and then I can't take it back.

419
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,980
They're going to fucking pull one up because remember what a fucking shock it was when

420
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:22,260
Eris died in Final Fantasy seven the first time, because you didn't have the internet

421
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,780
and all that stuff as prolific as it is now.

422
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,780
What do you mean a shock?

423
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,780
I was happy.

424
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:29,100
Well, I know, but for most people, it was a pleasant surprise though for you.

425
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,100
I kind of saw it happening.

426
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,240
What if the gag is this time around, Oh, you re I'm about to be the most hated person on

427
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,240
the internet.

428
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,240
You ready?

429
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:41,160
This time they're like, we're really going to shock them this time through like a trick.

430
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,720
She's going to survive and Tifa dies.

431
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,080
That doesn't work for the story.

432
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,560
I mean, there's actually no logical reason and I'll put it this way because it was because

433
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:56,760
she was dead that the whole shit happened with the live stream business.

434
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,160
And Tifa has absolutely nothing to do with the life.

435
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,760
I'm just saying, I'm just waiting.

436
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:09,140
We have to kill the last survivor of their species because, and it ended up being like

437
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,180
a big story point anyways.

438
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,320
So I just don't see any way around it.

439
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:18,820
And even so if, if she lives, I'm just gonna, um, head cannon that I locked her in a trunk

440
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,820
and left her at the bottom of the pool.

441
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,820
That's true.

442
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,820
You still get to pick who's in your party.

443
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:27,640
She is the one woman I will allow to be in a refrigerator.

444
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:33,160
So are you saying you will be telling Aerith to just go back to the kitchen and not, no,

445
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,400
I'm just going to tell her to just not be around.

446
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,400
All right.

447
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:44,880
Don't get, don't get in the way of my, uh, Tifa cloud romance, uh, SSJ 100 Matt is saying,

448
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,760
I believe they will do something like that.

449
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:50,700
Oh, tiger claws saying, I wouldn't be surprised if she lives, it's a remake and the remake

450
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,500
doesn't have to be exactly like the original.

451
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,020
They can take some liberties with it to make it different enough.

452
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,980
I can just see dark soccer getting so angry.

453
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,940
Um, watch me be right though.

454
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:02,900
Then, uh, uh, uh, a newer name, I don't recognize rep cycled welcome.

455
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,980
Sorry if I mispronounced your name, said she dropped the materia.

456
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:09,220
So, but that, that doesn't mean it could have been in someone else's pocket.

457
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,060
No, no, I get it.

458
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:15,820
I, and I get what dark soccer say it like they would have to drastically shift the story

459
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:19,940
to kill somebody else, you know, but maybe they'll kill Kate Seth.

460
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:24,380
Would anybody be that upset if it, by the way, cat she, Oh, that's how it's pronounced

461
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,380
all these years.

462
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,860
I've said Kate Seth because it's cultic.

463
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,860
Interesting.

464
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,860
Good to know.

465
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:33,060
Uh, anyway, uh, just fake us out, making it look like that she's going to live, but instead

466
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:37,620
they'll go the whole tomb Raider route where she dies horribly.

467
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,340
Pixel Pacas says dark soccer.

468
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:44,500
I love your head Canon, LOL, uh, Meesh and chat says, I never even got to finish final

469
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,980
fantasy seven and now I don't want to, it's, it's worth it.

470
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,400
It's it's worth a play.

471
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,400
It is.

472
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,400
It's it's a little harder to play the original.

473
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,400
It's so kind of graphic.

474
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,620
I don't know why I hate her.

475
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:56,680
She was such a fucking stereotype character.

476
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:00,720
She had the personality of a noodle, but she was my healer.

477
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:08,480
She existed just for plot, which is kind of the same problem I have with as much as you

478
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,360
know, the mass effect fandom is all about Nylas.

479
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,280
It's the same problem I have with that writing and it pisses me off.

480
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:22,360
I'm here's the problem I have with final fantasy seven in the fact that, you know, she's dead

481
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:28,440
is because we have the Phoenix down, which can bring things back to life.

482
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,120
So why is anybody dead?

483
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,120
Anybody at all?

484
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,040
Because actually there's a, there's an explanation for this because you actually don't die.

485
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,040
You never die.

486
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,040
Your characters never die.

487
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:42,480
They get KO'd like wait for the, it says KO'd your characters or party KO'd.

488
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,480
Everybody's KO'd.

489
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,480
So it's different.

490
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,480
You don't die.

491
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,400
You just get KO'd and Phoenix down revives your KO status.

492
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,400
Fine.

493
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,400
Look it up.

494
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,840
It actually came up on a final fantasy 14 panel because somebody asked a question about

495
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,440
what happens when everybody dies and he did this whole thing where he goes, well, they're

496
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,440
KO'd.

497
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,960
He kind of did this whole like wink.

498
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,960
Nobody really dies except Harshvan.

499
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:09,160
Uh, anyway, that was their whole thing for explaining why, and what was the game with

500
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,800
Nathan Drake?

501
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,260
Uncharted Uncharted.

502
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:18,420
Why he can get shot so much and it's because he has a luck meter and so that finally when

503
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,740
his luck runs out, the bullet finally hits him.

504
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,740
Okay.

505
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,980
Before we move on to another game, I wanted to say, uh, Bobby Blackwolf and Chad says,

506
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,540
I mean the Marvel Cinematic Universe does things differently than the comics and everyone

507
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,580
hates and loves them for it.

508
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:34,060
So I don't, I'm just, I think it is very obvious going back to on topic with Final Fantasy

509
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:39,700
7 in the trailer, it does seem like characters that were like side characters before seem

510
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,540
to play a much bigger role this time.

511
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:47,700
They're definitely, and that probably is a nature of the game only being episode one

512
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,980
only being the Midgar part of the story is that they're probably some of these characters

513
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:55,600
that were more side characters are taking on a bigger role because I mean, otherwise,

514
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,100
you know, like we brought up earlier, you don't have Vincent yet.

515
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:04,280
You don't have, um, K cat, cat, cat seat, catchy.

516
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,980
You're not going to have that one yet.

517
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:08,340
You're not going to have, does red 13 show up in bigger?

518
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,340
Yes.

519
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:12,480
Red 13 is bigger, but you know, it's going to, it's going to be limited on what characters

520
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,480
you have.

521
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,900
So maybe some of these side characters will take a bigger role.

522
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:15,900
Who knows?

523
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,900
We'll see.

524
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,100
What's the show Tokyo game show?

525
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,100
They show Death Stranding.

526
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:26,660
They actually have like a long gameplay presentation to show off actually what you do in the game,

527
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,700
which I still don't know what you do.

528
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,100
Well, I, I watched a little bit of the video.

529
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:35,860
I mean, I didn't watch all 45 minutes, but I did a little bit of hunting and pecking

530
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:39,300
around the Death Stranding and I grabbed a little bit of footage here.

531
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:43,580
I like how everything you carry, you can see, well, yeah, it's, that's the interesting thing.

532
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:48,220
I've always thought it was funny, like in games you would have this gigantic inventory,

533
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,260
but it like just seems to all fit magically in this backpack.

534
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:55,260
But it really does seem like in this game and Death Stranding, like you see that he's

535
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:59,180
carrying everything and it seems to affect like his weight and stuff too.

536
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:03,360
There's a fucking baby in that thing or, you know, the, the fetus thing that's in the trailers

537
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,360
in that thing.

538
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,820
That's why it's like so awkward.

539
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:09,740
But when you're actually looking at the gameplay footage, you can see there's like an open

540
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,740
world.

541
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:14,820
So if you're looking at on the footage that they're showing off, the Hideo Kojima is playing,

542
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,360
they're going to a map and they're actually like setting a route.

543
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,540
So they're doing like, I guess you could say a fetch quest type of thing, but like the

544
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,540
delivery quest.

545
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:25,100
Uh, so you can see like there's this giant map and they're actually like plotting a course

546
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:30,340
on the map right now that Norman Reedus is going to run and I guess make some type of

547
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,340
like delivery here.

548
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,820
So you can actually kind of see, Oh, okay.

549
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:37,020
So it's like an open the world type of thing.

550
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:39,620
And you actually will see him run around a little bit.

551
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,340
Well, hopefully this will just be so you don't have to hold down the damn controller all

552
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,340
the time.

553
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,340
Yeah.

554
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,980
I mean, um, I don't know.

555
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:51,940
Like again, I've been, believe me, I've been like the first one to say they need to actually

556
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:54,620
show us what this fucking game is.

557
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:59,220
And so you, cause we've had like what three years worth of just like cinematic teases

558
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,220
and shit.

559
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,220
Right.

560
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:04,380
So I'm very happy that now what we're like two months from the game's release at this

561
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:08,380
point, but we're finally getting to see like, okay, here's what the game looks like in motion.

562
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:11,620
And I think they did, they did 45 minutes one day, they did like another 20 minutes

563
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,620
another day.

564
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:16,900
So you, you can get a full sense of like what the game actually kind of looks like, like

565
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,900
as you're playing it now.

566
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,980
He did, they just did a little thing that like was scanning the terrain too.

567
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:24,940
I just saw that kind of remind me of no man's sky when you go like you're scanning for different

568
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:25,940
materials.

569
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,580
So I thought that was kind of interesting.

570
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:32,740
So anyway, um, uh, rep cycled in our chat says it does seem like he's a courier.

571
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,740
Yeah.

572
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,740
I think that was part of the story.

573
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,860
Oh, did they just, did they do the part where he changed his hat?

574
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:39,740
So of course there's fashion accessories and things like that too, because you know

575
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:44,660
there is, um, let's see, Misha in our chat says, by the time this game comes out, I'm

576
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:47,860
not even sure I'll want it cause they're beating the source till it dies.

577
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,060
So much talking about it.

578
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:52,940
They're talking about this more than cyberpunk 2077 and we still don't know what this fucking

579
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:53,940
game is about.

580
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,820
Well, at least we finally learned a little more this week.

581
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:59,440
Like I feel a little better after this week, but I do agree.

582
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:04,760
It's been three years of like hype, but at the same time it is Hideo Kojima.

583
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:09,560
So a little bit of hype is to be expected, but um, yeah, I'm just excited that this game

584
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,300
is like finally about to come out and now I won't just get to see professionals like

585
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,300
Kojima playing it.

586
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,240
I'll get to watch people on Twitch play it and make a decision from there.

587
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,000
I haven't decided if I want to buy this day one or not.

588
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,360
I kind of think I do, but I'm not sure yet.

589
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,680
So it looks interesting.

590
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,680
Yeah, it does.

591
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,640
It looks like, and especially like, you know, with games like breath of the wild and stuff

592
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,360
being all the rage where like open world stuff is so like, I feel like there's going to be

593
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,120
a lot to do and a lot to explore and so we'll see.

594
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,360
But creepy silent hill creatures though.

595
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,360
Yes.

596
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,600
Yes.

597
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,480
Creepy shit and ghost babies and ghost babies.

598
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,800
Creepy shit and ghost babies.

599
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,800
Hashtag.

600
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,800
Um, let's see.

601
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,080
Questbuster in chat says there are some combat bits in the first day footage, but they're

602
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,520
later and they admittedly don't look bad, especially the part that submerges you in

603
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,480
black ink and then makes you fight a weird lion with tentacles.

604
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,480
Hmm.

605
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,300
Uh, Kaijuto in chat says I won't buy it.

606
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,040
It looks awful and too weird.

607
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,040
No, it is.

608
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,040
It is a little out there.

609
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,600
It's not going to be for everybody's tastes.

610
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,600
That's for sure.

611
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,600
So, all right.

612
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,600
Me.

613
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,960
Me should chat says, all I know is you can pee on mushrooms to make them grow and you

614
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,640
carry a baby.

615
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,400
Did you see there was a little and you can drink monster.

616
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,120
There was a clip on Twitter.

617
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:25,280
I saw there was a gift that somebody took of like Norman Reedus's character because

618
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:30,060
like what they did is they zoomed in on his crotch and the Norman Reedus character like

619
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:33,820
goes like this, like bumps the camera up and then punches the person in the face for

620
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,700
like staring at his crotch.

621
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,460
And I don't know, like some people were saying, is this homophobia question mark question

622
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,460
mark.

623
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:46,060
But because, especially because you compare that to quiet in metal gear solid five, which

624
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,140
does not react the same way.

625
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,020
I don't, it's a gift.

626
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:53,620
I haven't seen it in full context, so I'm not willing to hedge my bets on one side of

627
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,780
the fence or the other.

628
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:59,660
I do think it's interesting that a character is finally going to fight back for being sexualized

629
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:02,300
in a video game by the in game camera.

630
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:05,860
But yeah, that's a little breaking the fourth wall there a little bit.

631
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:10,820
So I just, I want to see the context before I say, Oh, this is bad or this is good.

632
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:15,040
But I thought it was interesting that a character finally kind of does something about that.

633
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,040
Come on.

634
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,040
Y'all have done it.

635
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:20,900
You've zoomed in on the crotch and the character creator mode or the or the boobies or the

636
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,900
butt or something.

637
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,900
Never, never, ever.

638
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,660
I'm not really interested in any of it.

639
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,660
All right.

640
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,660
Well, fair.

641
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:30,260
I want my character to like look a specific way when I make one.

642
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:36,500
So although I do think that the Conan one was just hilarious.

643
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:41,300
Questmaster says the combat stuff resembles what we've seen in ground zeros and Phantom

644
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:42,700
pain a bit.

645
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:46,900
And dark to see you says it, that footage is in part of day two when they're talking

646
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,180
about the safe house.

647
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:52,060
So I guess I could see more context of that outside the gift if I want to.

648
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:56,060
So those are two of the big games we've got huge updates on fantasy seven remake and death

649
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,060
stranding.

650
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:00,620
So, um, yeah, cause the Nintendo direct was last week.

651
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,620
We talked all about that.

652
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,620
Yeah.

653
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,620
Would you have a little more on Nintendo?

654
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,620
We'll get to that a little later in the show.

655
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:07,660
I'm sure you see it over there on the sidebar, but first before we get into all that, we're

656
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:11,060
gonna talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing

657
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,060
this week.

658
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,860
Uh, so dark Sakura, how was your gaming week?

659
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:21,460
I simmed, I've decided to now that I actually got the new expansion, the magic, whatever

660
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,460
they called it.

661
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,980
I don't remember the name of it, but it just has magic.

662
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:30,180
So I'm going to make a special, I'm inspired by the show called being human, which I didn't

663
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,180
watch the U S one.

664
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,180
I watched a little bit.

665
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,620
It was shitty, but the British one was great.

666
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:37,780
And on the British show, it's a vampire or werewolf and a ghost that all live in a flat

667
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,780
together.

668
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:46,420
Um, it's really a lot more serious than that, but, um, I'm going to have a vampire, a witch

669
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:50,900
and a ghost live in a house together and it's going to be amazing.

670
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:54,180
Do do do do snap, snap, do do do do do.

671
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:57,340
Well, I've already decided cause I have the cheats ready to do the ghost the way I want

672
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,340
them to.

673
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:03,820
Cause you know, whenever you have a ghost in the Sims, what they do to the household

674
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,620
depends on how they died.

675
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:13,820
I have decided that I am going to have one die by and no drowning is no, I'm going to

676
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:20,540
have one die in the sauna because if they die of relaxation, they actually absorb puddles.

677
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:27,720
So I won't have to do like any puddle cleaning when the toilet breaks, I'm planning ahead.

678
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,720
This is you.

679
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,720
This is dark.

680
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,720
This is very dark.

681
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,740
Well, I also, one of my favorite Halloween, one of my favorite YouTubers is, um, James

682
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,740
from the Sims supply.

683
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:39,860
He's just really fun to watch, but I watched a video that I had, I'd seen it and I passed

684
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:44,900
it and passed and passed over, but he did one about how Sims die and I was like, Oh,

685
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,500
Oh, ideas.

686
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:51,180
And so I'm gonna, it's probably, what's going to be my first series of streaming when I

687
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:55,660
get going is making my Sim family and cheating the fuck out of it and building their house

688
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,780
and doing all of that.

689
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:02,940
So y'all get to watch me some stuff until a particular dating Sim comes out that I already

690
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,900
have on my wishlist on steam.

691
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:05,900
It's free.

692
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,900
Sounds good.

693
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:07,900
All right.

694
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,900
Moving on.

695
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,900
Loki, how was your gaming week?

696
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:14,660
I played a Borderlands three this week, so yeah, I forgot that actually came out.

697
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,420
So I played a little bit of that.

698
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:24,140
Um, so I'm playing as, uh, Zane and it's a good sport lens.

699
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,740
What are you playing on a PC or console or what?

700
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,740
PC.

701
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,740
Yeah.

702
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,740
Oh, okay.

703
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,740
Oh, so you ponied up the money for the Epic store.

704
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,740
I know.

705
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:34,380
And I did the, uh, special edition with the, um, the DLC.

706
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,700
I know some people, some people still not happy with the Epic thing.

707
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,260
In fact, uh, Bobby referred to it on his show as the six month beta test on PC.

708
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,020
Well, I get it.

709
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:47,220
They don't, they don't have the prepaid cards like steam does, and it's a deal breaker for

710
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,220
me too, honestly.

711
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,140
But I would just get Borderlands three on console.

712
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:54,500
Um, but they don't have the prepaid cards and I don't kind of don't trust Epic with

713
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,660
my credit card because Epic's been hacked already.

714
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:00,820
Like I've, I've had my account hacked on there and it's like, I don't exactly like, I'm not

715
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,820
an idiot when it comes to password security.

716
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:07,060
So, and I don't think Epic has two FA don't have anything I care about.

717
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:10,620
Well, I, I would actually love to get, um, Tetris effect on PC.

718
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:13,060
I think I would double dip on that game just cause I'm crazy.

719
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:17,620
Um, especially if they do like a, but yeah, like the number one thing Epic needs to get

720
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:22,180
on is having those prepaid cards so that I don't have to give them my credit card number

721
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,660
like or can you do PayPal yet?

722
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,660
You can do PayPal.

723
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:29,260
I might, I might be okay with that because then it's going through third party.

724
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:33,700
The thing is about the PayPal stuff though is it seems to just, once you've authorized

725
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:38,100
it, it just goes through without having to put your password in, which I don't necessarily

726
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,540
like, but that could be a PayPal thing.

727
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:44,800
Um, and Bobby in chat says they do have two factor authentication.

728
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,180
I didn't realize that.

729
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,300
So that'll, that's on me.

730
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:51,400
I do try to do two FA on everything and I really encourage you guys to as well.

731
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,380
If you have a cell phone, get that two factor auth, especially on the two most important

732
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,860
things, your email account and your banking.

733
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:00,620
Get those locked down because those are the things you can never have hacked.

734
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:04,260
Uh, Bobby says, I trust them less with my PayPal because it goes directly from my bank.

735
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:07,300
Yeah, but don't, wouldn't you have to like log into PayPal every time to do it.

736
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:10,500
So it's not, you know, this time, no, it just, it, it just does it.

737
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:11,940
Oh, okay.

738
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:12,540
I don't like that.

739
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,740
I thought you had to log it.

740
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:17,820
Like it's, it's like, uh, when I've paid some bills on like, okay, so like the way I used

741
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:21,820
to pay for VOG, when it was a radio feed, I would go to PayPal, like I would go to their

742
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:22,660
site, it would be a link.

743
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,940
It would send me to PayPal.

744
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:24,740
I log into PayPal.

745
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:28,820
And then when I pay, PayPal sends a message back saying, Rob paid this much money.

746
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,900
So it's not like that.

747
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,280
It's like built in.

748
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:34,020
So you're, cause that was like, you felt like you were going through a third party

749
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,260
completely does the same thing.

750
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:37,820
Oh, interesting.

751
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:46,740
I have to say that I've set up my Apple card on a few things now because, um, all number

752
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:50,660
one, my card doesn't have a number that's public.

753
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:56,780
Um, so anything that's been taking, um, Apple pay, I've been able to do everything through

754
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,340
Apple pay.

755
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:02,020
Yeah, but I still feel like Apple card, MasterCard, Visa, either way, you're putting

756
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:02,780
yourself at risk.

757
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,100
Nope.

758
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:08,100
But the other thing on it too, is that if you have, you know, with an iPhone, your control

759
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:12,580
of the card goes into your iPhone, you get an immediate notice anytime there's a

760
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:15,860
transaction down to subscription transactions.

761
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:21,780
To be fair, my, I don't want to plug my bank cause they're not paying me to, um, but my

762
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,740
bank will also send me an alert that I can set.

763
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:27,620
If it's over X amount of dollars, it will send a push message to my phone.

764
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,940
So there's a site, my bank will do that too.

765
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,260
I just like that for anything.

766
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,740
So there's a site out there.

767
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,420
Um, wait, hold on.

768
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:39,780
Well, and on top of that, I get, um, it'll actually divide up my transactions based on

769
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,260
what type of transaction it was.

770
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:44,140
So it also is like budgeting and the usual stuff.

771
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:49,340
I don't mind getting money back, but not that I'm doing an advertisement for it, but I've

772
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,380
found the security has been really top notch on it.

773
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:54,180
You're not the only one I've heard that cause that's like a new thing that was just in the

774
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:54,900
past two or three weeks.

775
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,140
And my card is like legit titanium.

776
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,940
I've, I've heard it's metal.

777
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:01,220
You're not the only one I've heard kind of dipping their finger in the waters of

778
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,100
that, you know, kind of new, new thing.

779
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:07,500
So, um, you want to add, I was going to say they have a site called privacy.com that you

780
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:12,020
can set up virtual credit cards with certain limits on them so you can actually add money

781
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:12,340
to them.

782
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:16,060
So for example, say you want to do, you know, trials at different, I don't think you want

783
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:16,780
to put that on cam.

784
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,060
Oh yeah, that's right.

785
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:19,740
They don't have a number.

786
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,220
Okay.

787
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:21,980
You, you better think extra care.

788
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:22,460
All right.

789
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:22,900
All right.

790
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:23,300
There you go.

791
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:23,940
Okay.

792
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:27,260
I was, I would never put that on cam, but all right.

793
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,180
Yeah, no, they, they, they're sleek looking.

794
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:34,700
Things, which is very typical of Apple, but you know, anyway.

795
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,540
Um, let's see what I want to say.

796
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,900
Uh, but did you do, uh, Bobby?

797
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:39,580
Oh, I'm sorry.

798
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:42,300
Actually this, uh, rip cycle had this other good comment here.

799
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:47,500
I thought it was, um, worth noting is that, um, my bank gets spooked by repeated

800
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,340
transactions.

801
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,300
Wish they had a cart.

802
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,220
I forgot about that too.

803
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,300
Epic game store.

804
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:54,500
Does it like you have to keep buying one at a time, basically.

805
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:54,820
Yeah.

806
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,140
You can't just put everything in a cart.

807
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,180
That seems very silly.

808
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:02,060
So anyway, um, what else do we want to talk about with your gaming week?

809
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:02,500
Loki.

810
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:05,060
Oh, I worked, I worked on my stuff as well.

811
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:09,980
So I worked on my game and then, uh, pizza's fine.

812
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:16,620
Uh, but so I worked on that and they played a little Pokemon go.

813
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:20,340
That's pretty much it, but I had to take a break for border lands

814
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,540
because you know, it's for Lance.

815
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:25,380
I'm hearing there was a comment or something I saw on Twitter that

816
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:28,220
they've gearbox has commented that it's doing very well.

817
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:31,260
They're very happy with how, you know, despite this fact that some

818
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:34,660
people are, you know, a little huffy about the lack of availability

819
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:38,260
anywhere else on PC, but the Epic store, it seems to be doing very well.

820
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:42,140
And again, like I, if I decide to get in on it, I'll just get it on console.

821
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:42,700
Fine.

822
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:46,660
Because, you know, it's just like any of the other border land stuff, you know,

823
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:50,580
they'll, it'll go on a deep discount sometime in the future during a steam

824
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:54,660
sale, just buy it again, buy it again on the PlayStation story.

825
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:55,980
It's fine.

826
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,860
And whatever, you know, I'm fine with it.

827
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:02,060
Um, Bobby's telling us about the, the review.

828
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:02,940
And I heard about this too.

829
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:03,780
I thought this was weird.

830
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:07,500
One of the interesting things that two K did with border lands three is that

831
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,620
they're not providing an Epic store code.

832
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:12,540
They were providing a separate account with the game.

833
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:13,340
Yeah.

834
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:16,740
And apparently had really early builds on it, which is stupid because, and

835
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:19,820
then they, they were telling people not to mention certain bugs in the

836
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,140
game because those are going to be fixed.

837
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,860
So then they gives you the impression of, well, it's like, well, I don't

838
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,380
know which bugs I can mention, you know, it could be just something that

839
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:29,140
they're going to fix and, and then it just kind of skews her.

840
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,140
I wouldn't have played along with that.

841
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:34,220
I would've said I ran across these bugs, but they said that some of

842
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,500
these will be fixed by launch.

843
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,820
So we'll, we'll update our review at launch.

844
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:42,420
Like, I really wish reviewers would not play into those hands.

845
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,940
But yeah, I, there's nothing I can do about that.

846
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,500
So, all right.

847
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,820
Anyway, that's it for your game week.

848
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:52,500
Um, I was, I was out for training for my new job all week.

849
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:56,140
So I didn't, I wasn't really at home game to play a lot of stuff, but I've been

850
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,020
continuing to play world of Warcraft classic.

851
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:02,180
Um, I caught my priest up to level 14, which is like the equivalent of like

852
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:04,140
end game in a lot of MMOs today.

853
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:04,900
It takes a lot of work.

854
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,620
So I've been playing that I've also been playing ironically, final fantasy

855
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:12,980
14, uh, still playing that, uh, taking my, um, gunbreaker up a few more levels.

856
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,700
I'm almost a level 70 on my gunbreaker.

857
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,580
That's a lot of fun to play as a tank actually.

858
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,660
Um, otherwise I had my switch with me.

859
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:23,180
I could not get on the hotel wifi, which really bothered me because I wanted to

860
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:27,540
work on my Diablo three seasonal character on switch because for the first time I'm

861
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:31,780
finally playing a necromancer because after all this time, I still don't have

862
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:36,420
necromancer on the PC and as much as I love Diablo three, do you guys remember I

863
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:39,740
said I wasn't going to get it because I was pissed off that they didn't do a legit

864
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:43,340
expansion and they were just like, it was a money grab, so I never bought it.

865
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:47,540
And to this day I still haven't, but when I did get the switch version, so yes, I

866
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:51,100
bought another version, so maybe I'm not really helping, but when I bought the

867
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:54,740
switch version, which I still enjoy that version, it did come with the necromancer

868
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:55,700
just kind of like built in.

869
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,820
So that's, that was my first chance.

870
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:01,260
Finally getting to play that class, uh, in three anyway, as opposed to two.

871
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:05,300
So, um, yeah, but sadly the hotel internet didn't work, so I couldn't do very much

872
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:05,740
with that.

873
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:09,220
Um, but I was still able to play some Mario maker and some of the super Nintendo

874
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,220
catalog because you know, all those games came out.

875
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:15,420
Uh, and yeah, so that was, that was otherwise not a lot of new stuff this

876
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:18,380
week, but hopefully we'll get on that, uh, in the coming week.

877
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:21,860
Cause now I'll be at home this week and can jump in on some new games.

878
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:25,580
Um, I w that's, and if you wondered why I haven't been streaming at all last week,

879
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,980
that's why I w I haven't been home.

880
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:31,860
So, um, I did, I will mention quickly earlier today, I did go out for Pokemon

881
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:32,580
community day.

882
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:37,580
Um, I haven't really been playing Pokemon go a lot at all, but I did today.

883
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:42,380
I caught like maybe nine shiny turtwigs and I was that today.

884
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,660
Yeah, it was today, uh, from 11 to two this morning.

885
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,700
And I, there was still a lot of people at Capitol.

886
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,540
It's still very popular.

887
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:53,380
Um, I hatched a shiny Tauros, which, oh yeah, I forgot.

888
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,380
There's like a million shinies in the game all of a sudden.

889
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:01,140
So I hatched a shiny Tauros and I also hatched a shiny Igglybuff, which I would

890
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:04,180
have never known was a shiny if it didn't show that little icon.

891
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:08,700
Cause I swear to God, it looks exactly the same, but yeah, I had, I, I had a shiny

892
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,460
day that even Shane can be proud of.

893
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:15,260
That was like three different, uh, new Pokemon going in the shiny decks today.

894
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:15,940
So that was fun.

895
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:19,340
So, uh, yeah, uh, played a little bit of that.

896
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,700
Um, oh, I guess I can mention the Ingress thing I did yesterday.

897
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:26,660
Um, I don't talk a lot about Ingress on this show, but I did go to the, they did

898
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,060
a, what's called a field test.

899
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:31,780
Uh, hex hexathlon was the event they did yesterday.

900
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:36,100
So, um, myself and one of my Ingress buddies drove over to Santa Clara, uh, to

901
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,340
the university there.

902
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:42,060
And yes, I know MagWest was right there and I didn't go and I really wanted to,

903
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:44,500
but I was really only there for a few hours.

904
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,620
We went there, did the thing and came right back.

905
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:50,340
Um, I just, MagWest is always just, the timing is so terrible.

906
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:50,860
I feel bad.

907
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:52,740
But anyway, so we went to Santa Clara.

908
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,900
It was at the university there, which is really pretty.

909
00:41:55,180 --> 00:42:00,340
Um, and, uh, basically you had to do these different events in an hour and a half.

910
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:05,100
So you had an hour and a half to hack as many portals as you can get as many

911
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:09,100
glyph points as you can walk as many kilometers as you can deploy as many

912
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:13,260
resonators as you can and hack artifacts from certain marked portals.

913
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:17,660
And if you got in the top 10% of a certain category, you got a special metal.

914
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,140
So you got an elite metal.

915
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:22,580
Well, the really cool thing, finally, in Ingress, you actually could see

916
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:23,860
your results in real time.

917
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,580
So you could hit a button within the scanner.

918
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:28,340
It would take you to a separate page cause they've done some new stuff in prime.

919
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,180
They're really trying to, as, as much as the player base has really been

920
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:34,020
resisting prime, they've been trying to add some new stuff to make it more

921
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:34,460
attractive.

922
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:37,340
So one of them was he could go right to this leaderboard and you could see how

923
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,700
you were doing every five minutes.

924
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:42,820
And within the first 30 minutes of the event, I was like, Oh my God, I'm in the

925
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:47,380
elite for every single category and number one for glyph app points.

926
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:50,580
So I just kept, I just kept pushing for the whole thing I would have.

927
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:56,540
And, uh, I ended up in the elite top 10% in every single category and number one

928
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:59,940
overall in glyph act points out of 210 registered people.

929
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:00,380
Nice.

930
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,340
So I was, yeah, it was pretty exciting.

931
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:04,460
So that was my super nerdy Ingress day.

932
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:09,020
But, um, I haven't been so fond on Ingress this whole week, cause I

933
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,220
should say something about this.

934
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:13,100
So they're doing these big anomalies, these live events.

935
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:18,460
They decided to, with a month's notice, spring it on people that, Oh, um, if you

936
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:22,220
want a badge for doing the anomaly, you're going to have to pay $13 for the badge,

937
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,540
which for years it's been free.

938
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:31,100
Like I understand they have to make money and that game is not making nearly the

939
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:35,340
same levels of money that Pokemon Go and Harry Potter probably are.

940
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:41,940
But to spring that on your player base, when mostly volunteers are organizing

941
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:46,980
these events for you with one month's notice is fucking tacky.

942
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:47,660
I'm sorry.

943
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:52,580
Like if they wanted to announce earlier this week that in 2020, this was going to

944
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,260
be the new design, then fine.

945
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:57,820
Then people can decide before they agree to, you know, volunteer and do all this

946
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:00,980
stuff, they at least will know what the rules are.

947
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:04,380
But to spring it with a month's notice when the planning started, like probably

948
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:06,740
five months ago, that was really shitty.

949
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:11,620
To be fair, they've gone back on it a little bit, but they're still being kind

950
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:14,540
of stingy when it comes to what they call offsite support.

951
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:18,940
So sometimes like, um, because there's so many people on the ground, they need

952
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:23,060
people to watch what's happening on their desktop on Intel and basically tell people

953
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:26,580
over walkie talkies, okay, ground team two, go to this portal ground team one.

954
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,900
So that's operations, right?

955
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:32,100
So, um, th those people have always gotten badges because they're, they're working

956
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:32,660
just as hard.

957
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:33,500
They're playing the game too.

958
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:34,780
They're just playing it in a different way.

959
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:35,380
Right?

960
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:36,020
Right.

961
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:39,340
They've decided and they've drawn a hard line there.

962
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:41,540
If those people want a badge, they have to pay money for it.

963
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:46,660
So I, I just thought that was a little shitty and Niantic needs to work on their

964
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:47,460
communications.

965
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:48,500
Cause that was junky.

966
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:53,860
Um, but then I went and did the hexathlon anyway.

967
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:57,580
So, but at least I can say, Hey, I know what I'm talking about with this game.

968
00:44:57,580 --> 00:45:01,260
Cause I performed very well in that hexathlon.

969
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:03,740
So anyway, uh, that's enough about that game.

970
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,260
Let's get back into some more gaming news.

971
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:08,780
Cause there's been a lot of gaming news this week to get into not just Tokyo game

972
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:11,380
show, but other stuff around the world, literally the world, right?

973
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:11,660
Loki.

974
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:16,020
Yes, the world and the world's, uh, game here.

975
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:21,940
So the Olympics, of course, it's been talked about for a while that, you know,

976
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:25,500
they've been trying to get e-sports into the Olympics.

977
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:29,460
Um, and now we may be a little bit closer.

978
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:36,340
So originally, um, there was talks about getting e-sports into the 2020 summer

979
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:38,260
Olympics in Tokyo, Japan.

980
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:42,740
Uh, but apparently they're going to have a half a million dollar gaming tournament

981
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:46,700
hosted with Intel during the lead up to the Olympics.

982
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:48,860
So it's kind of close, I guess.

983
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:54,380
Um, they're saying they're going to have online qualifiers, which will be held to

984
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:57,100
fill out national teams of participating countries.

985
00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:04,180
And then, um, the qualifying events going to be planned in June in Poland, and it's

986
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:08,260
going to decide who will move on to the official competition in Japan.

987
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:16,220
And then apparently they're going to, I guess, have this, uh, music hall that

988
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:17,300
they're going to do this in.

989
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:23,660
So right before like the start date, um, it's interesting that they're kind of

990
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:25,300
doing it and coincide with it.

991
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:27,860
I don't know if it's necessarily going to be something that's going to push them to

992
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:29,700
put it, make it officially in there.

993
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:33,220
But I think that wasn't this year that they're adding like a bunch of new, like,

994
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:35,140
like I want to say like skateboarding.

995
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:39,780
They do add new events every few years and they take events away too.

996
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:45,300
I want to say they got rid of something relatively popular and it

997
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,580
was getting heat for it.

998
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:50,460
Um, I don't want to speak out of turn, but I feel like it was like women's

999
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:55,700
baseball or something that they got rid of, that they got a lot of shit for.

1000
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:57,180
Please correct me if I'm wrong in chat.

1001
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:59,580
I'm sorry, I don't have the notes in front of me, but I feel like there was

1002
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:01,340
some sport they got rid of that they're getting shit for.

1003
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:02,860
So then they add sports.

1004
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:08,940
So some of these like X games kind of stuff as you know, generation X has

1005
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:11,980
grown up with those types of sports or what, what was it?

1006
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:14,860
Uh, California games was really where all those remember that?

1007
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:16,700
Remember that from the eighties, California games?

1008
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:16,980
Yeah.

1009
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,940
Um, I actually Olympic hacky sack against the Olympic hack.

1010
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:23,300
I know a guy that worked on the programming for that game.

1011
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:25,220
I really want to get him on the show at some point.

1012
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:26,460
So we'll, we'll do that in the future though.

1013
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:28,460
He actually was a writer on California games.

1014
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:30,220
So I, anyway, we'll do that in the future.

1015
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:32,020
But anyway, um, but yeah, like all those games.

1016
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:33,740
So I, but it's like skateboarding and stuff.

1017
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:36,180
So that's showing up in the Olympics now.

1018
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:39,740
So they do badminton, I think was a sport they were going to add at some point too.

1019
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:40,980
That's not in there already.

1020
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:42,820
I thought, I thought that was the thing I was hearing.

1021
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:44,860
I don't know if somebody in chat knows, but surprised.

1022
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:45,420
Okay.

1023
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:49,140
Bobby says they got rid of softball and baseball.

1024
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:50,820
They got rid of softball women and base.

1025
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:54,660
So they actually got rid of men's baseball, but they are bringing it back.

1026
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:55,860
Apparently they're bringing back base.

1027
00:47:55,860 --> 00:48:00,500
I was going to say you can't have the Tokyo 2020 Olympics without baseball.

1028
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,220
I mean, that's, and apparently badminton has been a sport for ages.

1029
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:03,620
I'm sorry.

1030
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:07,220
I can't remember what I was like, I was like, it's like, it's, if it's not a part

1031
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:11,060
of the Olympics now, it's never going to be bad men.

1032
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:12,620
That's super old.

1033
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:14,660
Let's make lawn darts.

1034
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:18,500
Lawn darts is part of a, it will be Olympics.

1035
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:20,260
So I'm sorry, I might've missed it.

1036
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:22,420
Did they say what games are going to be?

1037
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:26,860
I mean, it makes sense that like with the Olympic games being in Tokyo, Japan

1038
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:29,460
is very well known for being part of the video game industry.

1039
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:33,020
So a lot of this makes sense that like, this is the, well, the two that they

1040
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:37,220
were going to do, so they had street fighter five and rocket league as, um, so

1041
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:39,820
each one of those is going to get a quarter million dollar prize pool.

1042
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:43,220
Um, those are the two that they mentioned.

1043
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:51,860
They were saying though, that apparently in the 2022 Asian, Asian games, um, there

1044
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:55,900
was, they also had, um, competitions regarding league, league of legends,

1045
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:58,780
Hearthstone, Starcraft two, among others.

1046
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:02,420
So I don't know that it is tough.

1047
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:06,460
Like, how would you pick which game that you play?

1048
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:08,780
I mean, cause it would be changing almost.

1049
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:12,700
I would imagine each time you go to the Olympics, they're talking like, you

1050
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,100
know, several years in between.

1051
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:14,940
Okay.

1052
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:16,060
For what it's worth.

1053
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:19,500
Um, I'm reading a Wikipedia article cause you know, that's the, that's

1054
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:22,380
the source of all the information, but Hey, it's where you go when

1055
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:23,220
you want to know stuff too.

1056
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:27,700
It says in 2013, IOC leaders voted to drop wrestling from the

1057
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:29,780
core program for the 2020 games.

1058
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:31,580
And then that was surprising.

1059
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:35,420
Um, but then later in 2013 in may, it says three of the eight sports under

1060
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:39,100
consideration made the final shortlist, baseball, softball, squash, and wrestling.

1061
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:42,220
Uh, the other five sports were rejected at this point.

1062
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:47,740
Uh, karate, roller sports, sport, climate climbing, wakeboarding, and wushu.

1063
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:50,660
Um, so roller sports, I'm sorry.

1064
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:52,740
Wrestling was chosen to be included.

1065
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:53,260
My bad.

1066
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:57,460
So that was added for 2020 and 2024, but this is like.

1067
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:01,500
Wrestling wrestling, not WWE wrestling.

1068
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,980
There is a huge difference just so we're clear.

1069
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:06,420
Well, yeah, this is, this is very different.

1070
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,380
This is like, like high school wrestling.

1071
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:08,620
Okay.

1072
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:12,500
Um, so let's see, uh, the games are now an event based program

1073
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,020
rather than sport gate based.

1074
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:14,940
That's kind of interesting.

1075
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:19,060
So, um, a list of eight sports was unveiled consisting of baseball, softball,

1076
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:22,900
bowling, karate, roller sports, sport, climbing, squash, surfing, and wushu.

1077
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,260
Um, interesting.

1078
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:26,740
Hmm.

1079
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:31,100
I still, I'm still, I wish I, there was just a fricking chart that said, added

1080
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:33,100
these games, removed these games.

1081
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:36,380
That would be a much easier for me to try to look through.

1082
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:37,580
Maybe it's on this Olympic sport.

1083
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:40,060
I'm trying to look, buy me time help.

1084
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:44,340
Um, hi, but video games aren't there.

1085
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:45,180
It's Mario and Sonic.

1086
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:47,820
Oh, they're going to play discontinued sports.

1087
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:48,620
There is a, okay.

1088
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:52,060
I found the list discontinued rugby at one point was cricket.

1089
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,340
No longer any limits, equestrian and vaulting.

1090
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:56,620
Um, interesting.

1091
00:50:57,380 --> 00:51:02,060
So there is, there's an article on Olympic sports that I guess you can, uh, look up

1092
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:05,340
if you want to know more information on that, um, but I guess there's a

1093
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,300
look up if you want to know more information on that.

1094
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:11,620
So, uh, SG 100, Matt says the hosting country gets more sway in terms

1095
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:12,940
of what sports are at the Olympics.

1096
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:16,100
When London got the Olympics, the EU voted out baseball because

1097
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:17,260
it's not that popular there.

1098
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:20,500
Since then the MLB pushed hard to get the games in Europe to

1099
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:21,500
get it back in the Olympics.

1100
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:22,220
Oh, interesting.

1101
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:26,500
Um, Bobby also points out the IOC didn't want any e-sports

1102
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,020
games that involved killing.

1103
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:30,860
So no league of legends or counter-strike.

1104
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:31,740
Oh, that's very interesting.

1105
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:36,660
But I mean, even somebody else in chat said like rocket league makes a hell of a

1106
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:43,900
lot of sense as like that game to push this discussion of sports, you know, video

1107
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:47,940
games as an Olympic sport forward, like street fighter, even I have to admit.

1108
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:49,060
Like I, and don't get me wrong.

1109
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:50,100
I love street fighter.

1110
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:51,900
I love street fighter two, I love street fighter four.

1111
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:52,900
Street fighter five is okay.

1112
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:56,180
But I, you know, but I like rocket league.

1113
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:59,020
That one's really going to get people to go, okay.

1114
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:01,260
It's like a little mix of all these different games.

1115
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:02,540
It's not violent.

1116
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:03,860
It's family friendly.

1117
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:08,820
It's a good, it's a good barometer to see how video games can do in the Olympics.

1118
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:09,540
Sure.

1119
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:12,940
Anyways, anyway, so it's still an exhibition of sorts.

1120
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:16,020
It's kind of something running side by side, but who knows, maybe in the future,

1121
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:21,460
I still remember years ago on this show, maybe leading up to the 2004 Olympics, we

1122
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:24,580
were talking about dance, dance revolution becoming an Olympic sport because didn't

1123
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:29,820
one of those Nordic countries, um, decide to recognize DDR as a sport.

1124
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:33,420
And I remember that was a whole discussion in one of the early episodes of OLR.

1125
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:36,060
One of the, I don't even remember which country it was in Switzerland or

1126
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:39,740
something like that, like actually, uh, recognized as a sport.

1127
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:46,380
So anyway, cause you don't chat says in fencing, you pretend to stab a person.

1128
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:47,540
That's in the Olympics.

1129
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:53,820
I remember playing fencing in summer games too, by epics.

1130
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:58,140
The, uh, you know, the, the, the precursor in many ways to, uh, California games,

1131
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,660
there was summer games, there was winter games or some games too.

1132
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:02,420
Fencing was in that and it was a lot of fun.

1133
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:07,580
And then, do you know, when I saw fencing again in, uh, that James Bond movie with

1134
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:09,580
Madonna, cause she was the fencing instructor.

1135
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:10,460
Oh, that's right.

1136
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:17,700
Cause so, so fencing is a very James Bond type of thing to me, like fencing, we're

1137
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:22,460
going to go down to the yacht club and do some fencing today, posh posh, like it's

1138
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:26,820
just, it's something posh by does in her spare time, it's not something for normal

1139
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:27,340
people.

1140
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:28,340
All right.

1141
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:28,740
Anyway.

1142
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:29,860
All right.

1143
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:30,460
Let's move on.

1144
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:34,300
Uh, let's talk about, let's talk about that Nintendo fitness, right?

1145
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:37,580
Remember last week we saw the band, right?

1146
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:41,700
So we saw that whole fitness device and this week we got a little more information

1147
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:42,980
on what it is.

1148
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:46,860
You know, I, you know what I started calling it because it's a device and you

1149
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:48,140
can strap it onto your leg.

1150
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:49,740
I've been calling it the Nintendo strap on.

1151
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:54,140
So of course you have, can I, can I continue to call it that for the purposes

1152
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:54,580
of this show?

1153
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:55,540
Well, y'all know what I'm talking about.

1154
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:57,500
If I talk about the Nintendo strap on.

1155
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:58,340
Okay.

1156
00:53:58,380 --> 00:53:58,660
All right.

1157
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:03,180
So anyway, uh, so the Nintendo's new fitness game was unveiled and the game is

1158
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:05,380
going to be called ring fit adventure.

1159
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:09,540
You strap on the joy con onto your leg and then you use the ring thing.

1160
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:13,100
And then there's a whole little trail trailer that actually showed it's kind of

1161
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:14,820
like a legit RPG.

1162
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:21,220
And it makes me think of, do you remember in the three DS, how those me pass the

1163
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:24,860
street pass games and there was the one, Oh, dark soccer helped me out here.

1164
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:26,820
Cause you and I used to trade me's all the time.

1165
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:29,380
And it was that adventure game where you would, you were saving.

1166
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:31,260
Yeah.

1167
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:35,620
And you like had different like abilities as you level through it.

1168
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:38,740
And like depending on the colors of the shirts that people were wearing and they

1169
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:39,660
were black all the time.

1170
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:40,420
Yes, exactly.

1171
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:41,020
Find me.

1172
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:41,380
Thank you.

1173
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:42,180
Thank you chat.

1174
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:46,660
So, uh, find me, uh, was the, uh, uh, name of that game.

1175
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:49,380
It kind of, I don't know, like with the arts on everything kind of reminded me

1176
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:51,220
that, although obviously there's a little more to it.

1177
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:52,740
Cause find me was very, very basic.

1178
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:55,980
It was super basic, but let's talk a little bit before we talk about the game,

1179
00:54:55,980 --> 00:55:00,420
about the presentation, because what was up with that creepy ass dude?

1180
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:05,100
Like fucking just like channeling Dennis from it's always sunny.

1181
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:07,180
I swear to God, was she in danger?

1182
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:08,900
Cause it looked like she was in danger.

1183
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:11,500
It was getting his Jewish, like, what can you do?

1184
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:12,020
All right.

1185
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:16,620
Um, anyway, so if you want to move your character, you can actually jog or walk.

1186
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:19,460
And then the ring con is what it's called.

1187
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:22,380
So, you know, that looks like a little like hula hoop type of thing.

1188
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:26,100
I don't know the ring con, uh, you actually interact with objects.

1189
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:30,860
So you don't fight battles with magic, but you might do squats in

1190
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:33,260
order to do cast a magic spell.

1191
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:36,420
So it's, you know, it's gamifying exercise.

1192
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:39,620
Well, when I saw that they were doing that, it's like, uh, doing like a bow

1193
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:42,260
and arrow, like you pulled it back like a, a bow that was kind of cool.

1194
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:46,340
So anyway, uh, so if you want your Nintendo ring con and strap

1195
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:50,460
on, uh, it goes on sale on October 18th is the big day, $80.

1196
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:51,500
Um, I don't know.

1197
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:52,260
I might get it.

1198
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:55,540
I'm all about like extra fit exercise gaming type of stuff.

1199
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:56,300
Like why not?

1200
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:57,380
What's another one?

1201
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:58,420
Why not?

1202
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:00,180
I got, we fit and all that stuff.

1203
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:00,900
What's another one.

1204
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:02,140
Yes.

1205
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:04,940
I'm going to buy, I'm going to buy the Nintendo strap on.

1206
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:08,100
Whereas it looks like an idiot.

1207
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:11,860
I just don't want to buy more peripherals for the goddamn switch.

1208
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:16,940
I have like, I have you buy the cardboard ship for your kids and we

1209
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:18,820
haven't used it in like months.

1210
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:20,340
It was a waste of money.

1211
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:22,580
Why did I even buy that crap?

1212
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:23,900
Cause you wanted to see VR.

1213
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:29,260
It was fun to build it, but like it was like in the VR is okay, but

1214
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:32,220
it's such a like minimal thing.

1215
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:33,780
It's just, I don't know.

1216
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:36,220
There's like not really much to it.

1217
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:40,060
And it takes up a ton of fucking space.

1218
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:43,540
Uh, so look, folks in chat are, are, are hype.

1219
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:46,940
SSU 100 Matt says my girlfriend and I have already decided to go halves on this.

1220
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:50,100
Bobby Black Wolf said my wife already has this pre-ordered

1221
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:52,100
along with buying another doc.

1222
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:55,140
I remember this cause they have like a fitness type area.

1223
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:56,780
So, so wife gets a doc.

1224
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:59,020
I'm going to tell you right now, I'm just going to wait for these to be

1225
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:02,860
like piled up in Goodwill at some point because good, not going to

1226
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:06,620
happen for a little bit because, because you know that Nintendo and

1227
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:09,020
hardware is always a losing proposition.

1228
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:12,500
So these things are going to be scarce on shelves because Nintendo

1229
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,300
never makes enough of these things.

1230
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:17,460
And the strap-ons are going to be in huge demand because that is what

1231
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:21,020
happens when Nintendo products, every single goddamn time they

1232
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,300
come out there on that shelf.

1233
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:26,420
It's a piece of the audience is like, Oh, Nintendo, it's so beautiful.

1234
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:27,940
You've put out another device.

1235
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:28,980
I have to own it.

1236
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:33,420
Nintendo could go out there wearing a fucking strap on and

1237
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:34,540
the people would still buy it.

1238
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:38,460
I'm probably not going to get that or many new games.

1239
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:40,940
I'll be honest, other than the ones that are on my list, cause I do

1240
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:46,820
have a unhealthy backlog and legit, a room full of games I'm not playing.

1241
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:49,500
And I have DDR for a bunch of things.

1242
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:53,300
If I want to exercise while I'm playing, I've got other things.

1243
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:56,620
So sort of like, it's just the money grab.

1244
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:58,940
I need something to encourage me to do sit-ups.

1245
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:01,700
And since I can't like dark soccer, doesn't call me on a regular

1246
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:03,620
basis to go wrap sit-ups.

1247
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:08,020
So I saw this because I'm in a few different DDR communities

1248
00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:11,620
in Facebook and they have one for our, you know, if you own arcade

1249
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:15,140
cabinets, um, and someone took one of their DDR cabinets, because

1250
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:17,780
now MAME does support DDR and it runs at a full speed.

1251
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:22,140
So they have, um, Hyper spin on it.

1252
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:26,180
The front end that I was using for my, um, MAME cabinets and stuff like

1253
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:30,780
that to select all the different official versions of DDR to play

1254
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:34,260
them on your cabinet, using everything and step mania.

1255
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:35,940
I'm like, Ooh, I'm doing that.

1256
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:37,340
I'm doing that.

1257
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:37,580
Okay.

1258
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:38,620
So you've got, that's true.

1259
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:40,140
You have a DDR machine in your house.

1260
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:41,980
You've got your fitness routine down pat.

1261
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:45,140
I don't, you know, we have a gym membership.

1262
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:50,060
I was using until I decided to like, okay, like here's what every time I

1263
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:53,580
saw like the footage that they're showing while it looks neat and stuff.

1264
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:57,100
It reminds me of like the connect fitness games that they have or the

1265
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:59,300
connect adventures type thing.

1266
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:03,340
And it's going to be fun for a while and you're going to get bored

1267
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:05,300
with it really fast is what I think.

1268
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:07,580
And then you're stuck with this fucking peripheral that doesn't

1269
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:08,900
do anything in any other game.

1270
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:10,620
And that's my worry.

1271
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:14,340
So that's why I'm just going to wait for the deep discount because people

1272
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:18,020
are going to get bored with it really fast and then I'll pick it up.

1273
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:20,940
And I just, I do want to send my love to those in the chat room.

1274
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:21,980
They got my reference.

1275
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:24,860
Nintendo, your smile is beautiful.

1276
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:25,940
Did you stone that ring?

1277
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:26,220
All right.

1278
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:28,260
Anyway, uh, let's move on.

1279
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:30,300
Meanwhile, Loki's like, I don't get it.

1280
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:32,100
I don't.

1281
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:32,740
It's fine.

1282
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:33,580
That's all right.

1283
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:35,740
Some things you don't have to.

1284
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:39,580
Sometimes I speak a language that you can't hear and it's okay.

1285
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:43,180
Anyway, moving on dark soccer.

1286
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:44,500
Why don't you bring down the mood?

1287
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:47,380
How about some game stop?

1288
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:51,700
I know people like to call it the evil G, but man, they are suffering.

1289
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:59,460
So, um, yeah, they're planning on closing about 180 to 200 poorly performing stores

1290
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:05,580
by the end of the fiscal year and that's added to the 195 stores that already closed.

1291
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:10,700
Um, this, uh, was announced during an earnings conference call.

1292
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:14,780
There's no list of which stores are included in that right now.

1293
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:18,020
They have over 5,700 stores in 14 countries.

1294
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:27,620
Um, they said that basically, um, they're expecting that a lot of their, uh, in, in

1295
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:33,540
store sales to fall, uh, like a five to 10% dip in earnings.

1296
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:40,220
And, uh, it's pretty much looking like they are, they're on their way out.

1297
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:44,020
They've lost over 415 million in their last quarter.

1298
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:49,060
You need to carry less vinyl figures because there's a lot of like over a

1299
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:54,020
hundred dollar vinyl figures in those stores and no kids size shirts, not the

1300
01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:54,540
pop fakes.

1301
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:57,100
Those are fine because those are like cheap.

1302
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:02,860
I'm talking like the Japanese anime, like busty, scantily clad, like figures that

1303
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:04,540
they have there that are just cluttering.

1304
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:05,940
I usually don't notice those, but yeah.

1305
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:11,780
Um, but like they don't have kids size shirts, which seems like a big mistake to

1306
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:15,340
me because you have kids going into the store buying stuff.

1307
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:20,140
You have Ryan's world toys there, but you don't have like kids size t-shirts.

1308
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:22,620
It's all adult size t-shirts, which is really weird.

1309
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:23,940
Here's the thing.

1310
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:28,540
I don't want to like shit on GameStop too much because the people that are really

1311
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:33,300
being impacted by this and the stores closing are those retail workers.

1312
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:38,140
Most of them making minimum wage and most of them pretty decent kids and adults

1313
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:40,340
trying to just make some bucks.

1314
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:43,260
Now, if you're one of those people that uses your GameStop job to go on a power

1315
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:47,260
trip, as I think we've all run into that employee once in a while, then, you know,

1316
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:54,220
buy, buy bitch, you know, but for the most, I would say a good 96% of people that

1317
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:56,420
are working in the stores are just trying to make an honest living.

1318
01:01:56,420 --> 01:02:00,900
And for them, I feel bad and I don't want to bring on the snark too much, but I do

1319
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:03,700
feel like a lot of us are sitting here going, well, we've kind of seen this

1320
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:06,980
coming because GameStops are everywhere.

1321
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:09,020
They are a bit saturated.

1322
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:10,340
It's the same thing that happened with Subway.

1323
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:16,380
They had a massive expansion and then a whole bunch of markets shifted over and

1324
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:21,180
like Subway had this thing where they had like in some places, almost like how

1325
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:22,380
Starbucks is spread out.

1326
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:27,460
And but because they were all franchise stores, they weren't getting enough money

1327
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:28,580
to keep one of them open yet.

1328
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:30,100
They still had to pay their franchise fees.

1329
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:33,780
But GameStop, I mean, it is corporate owned and all that, too.

1330
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:37,940
But they did expand, I think, way too quickly for where the market was headed.

1331
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:43,940
They did also put a statement on here that more people are turning to digital

1332
01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:49,740
outlets to buy. And so to compete, they're doing a new web platform with a buy

1333
01:02:49,740 --> 01:02:51,260
online pickup in store option.

1334
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:54,860
Oh, yeah, because that that has worked out really well for Target.

1335
01:02:54,860 --> 01:02:57,060
They say they say Target does the same thing.

1336
01:02:57,060 --> 01:03:00,220
Yeah. Target had a really good quarter.

1337
01:03:00,220 --> 01:03:04,100
And they say that that type of stuff, like the app buying and picking up and that

1338
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:05,620
stuff is doing like really good.

1339
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:08,780
Sometimes their prices are cheaper online than they are in the store, which doesn't

1340
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:09,900
make any goddamn sense.

1341
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:11,100
But it's a promotion thing.

1342
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:12,700
They're trying to push the usage of it.

1343
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:17,260
Well, also, though, even though I'm trying not to give Amazon any more business, Amazon

1344
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:20,700
recently had this thing where if you purchase something that you want to return, you can

1345
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:21,940
actually return it to a Kohl's.

1346
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:25,260
Oh, yeah, I heard about that. I did that just the other day and then Kohl's gave me a

1347
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:30,860
coupon. I'm like, I will buy another stir fry pan that I don't need and then get they

1348
01:03:30,860 --> 01:03:32,260
give me like a 25 percent off coupon.

1349
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:36,620
It was weird. So anyway, I hope the people that are going to be losing jobs over this,

1350
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:40,180
like hopefully they're able to shuffle workers around, like maybe there's some seasonal

1351
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:43,100
stuff and with school, maybe they can minimize some of that.

1352
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:48,140
But I'm going to be honest, like where's the executive job loss to match?

1353
01:03:48,340 --> 01:03:52,220
I know they know they have the stuff for the magazine and there was something like where

1354
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:56,260
the decision makers that made these shitty decisions, where are they at, though?

1355
01:03:56,420 --> 01:04:01,380
This takes me to another point about it, and it's going to come up again because I'm going

1356
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:04,060
to bring up a point in another story that a friend came across to me.

1357
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:10,140
But the problem is, is that a lot of times the companies are going to use this as an

1358
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:15,300
excuse to try to guilt people into loyalty to the business because, oh, but our

1359
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:16,900
employees are going to lose out on this.

1360
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:21,780
Don't you care about the minimum wage workers when in reality we need to hold these big

1361
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:24,220
businesses accountable for their treatment of their employees?

1362
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:28,900
Like what's going on with well, this is what my beef is with the Amazon, with how they're

1363
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:34,060
cutting health benefits to their part time employees at Whole Foods.

1364
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:41,060
You know, this is I have a big problem with just the looser regulations are and the

1365
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:44,140
terrible lack of ethics in a lot of these companies.

1366
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:45,380
And it's all going back.

1367
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:47,860
It's affecting their minimum wage workers.

1368
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:50,820
It's affecting the people who are at the bottom of the food chain.

1369
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:56,380
But even though we may feel sorry for them, we have to hold the people in power

1370
01:04:56,380 --> 01:05:02,460
accountable, make them hurt so that they because the companies that are most successful

1371
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:05,420
that make the best money are the ones who invest in their employees.

1372
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:09,180
Well, the government should provide health care for everyone, but that's sorry tangent.

1373
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:14,700
Well, the government also needs to employ more energy efficient light bulbs.

1374
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:21,300
Anyway, topic change, but I will point out in chat some of the other comments here, some

1375
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:26,100
folks talking about how She-Hulk says they should have cut back a long time ago as the

1376
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:28,060
talk of the ThinkGeek merger came up.

1377
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:31,980
And I know we've talked about that GameStop has kind of evolved their stores a little

1378
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:35,980
bit because they have seen the digital, you know what that's doing to the more physical

1379
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:37,860
game sales and that whole thing.

1380
01:05:38,620 --> 01:05:42,020
So we've seen that they try to put more merchandise in their stores such as, I guess,

1381
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:46,060
the vinyl. They have all sorts of stuff in their T-shirts and they do have they have a

1382
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:48,420
ton of T-shirts and a lot of them are kind of cool.

1383
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:50,180
I just wish they weren't polyester.

1384
01:05:50,180 --> 01:05:53,020
But I mean, they're like neat.

1385
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:55,260
It's becoming more like hot topic every day.

1386
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:58,020
But they also have a lot of garbage in there.

1387
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:03,620
It's like I just don't like I was looking for Xbox One controllers the other day and I

1388
01:06:03,620 --> 01:06:05,500
couldn't find any, which was weird.

1389
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:11,660
I'm assuming they're all behind the counter, though, but it's just I don't know.

1390
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:13,740
They have like a section for like classic gaming.

1391
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:15,500
It's such a pitiful looking thing.

1392
01:06:15,500 --> 01:06:21,660
It's like a few cartridges and stuff for the Super Nintendo and like a couple of Genesis

1393
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:23,580
things and like a PlayStation one game.

1394
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:25,020
It's like, why even have that here?

1395
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:26,300
There's like nothing in it.

1396
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:28,620
Let me read one more comment here and then we'll move on.

1397
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:32,300
Questbuster in chat says their stock shot up earlier this year on news that they were

1398
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:33,340
looking for a buyer.

1399
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:36,860
But when no one stepped up, their stock tanked and kept declining since then.

1400
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:40,980
So we'll see if if, you know, we'll see.

1401
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:42,100
We'll see where it goes from here.

1402
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:45,060
But it's it's it's not looking good right now.

1403
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:45,980
But, you know, who knows?

1404
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:49,420
Sometimes I'm trying to think of companies that have had like a success when they scaled

1405
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:53,700
way back and then they kind of started to find their way again.

1406
01:06:53,740 --> 01:06:57,820
Well, I mean, I don't know if this is the best example, but like they say Toys R Us

1407
01:06:57,820 --> 01:07:01,980
is going to make a comeback like that now instead of being these giant stores, Toys

1408
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:04,580
R Us are going to be more like boutique type of things like KB.

1409
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:05,700
Yes, I know.

1410
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:06,900
Funny, right?

1411
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:09,500
And I guess that is where their strategical direction is.

1412
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:10,060
But we'll see.

1413
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:13,660
I'm trying to think of other like big companies, big, big companies that scaled way back and

1414
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:14,980
have done well as a result.

1415
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:20,140
I don't know, maybe somebody in chat knows, but anyway, let's move on.

1416
01:07:20,140 --> 01:07:23,060
I don't want to kill too much time because we have lots more news to cover.

1417
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:24,620
So, Loki, why don't you go to our next story?

1418
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:27,700
Yeah, so let's talk about Apple Arcade.

1419
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:31,700
So they arcade they have happy about that.

1420
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:38,260
The service is launching September 19th for $4.99 a month and you get access to more than

1421
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:39,260
100 games.

1422
01:07:39,260 --> 01:07:40,260
It's cheaper.

1423
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:41,260
And I thought it would be.

1424
01:07:41,260 --> 01:07:42,260
That's for sure.

1425
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:44,420
They had some games that they're showing off.

1426
01:07:44,420 --> 01:07:50,340
It was part of the Rayman Pac-Man, Shantae, Steven Universe and Choo-Choo Rocket games.

1427
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:51,620
I'm looking forward to Shantae.

1428
01:07:51,620 --> 01:07:56,340
There's a new Square Enix RPG called From the Creators of Bravely Default as well.

1429
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:59,620
It's coming to that.

1430
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:05,580
They're saying, though, that along with that, the service is also coming to Apple TV on

1431
01:08:05,580 --> 01:08:12,500
September 30th and Mac OS Catalina in October.

1432
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:13,500
And what else?

1433
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:17,100
I might be convinced to do this on Apple TV, like I'm going to be honest, like a lot of

1434
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:20,980
these games I'm hearing, I'm like, I don't really want to play any of that on my phone.

1435
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:25,340
But if it's coming to the TV and there's some type of like Bluetooth controller or something,

1436
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:26,340
I don't know.

1437
01:08:26,340 --> 01:08:27,980
Like, I just don't want to play touch games.

1438
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:29,460
I don't want to play these games touch.

1439
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:30,460
What?

1440
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:35,020
I might be selling my Apple TV to get the 4K one.

1441
01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:37,740
And I have a SteelSeries controller, which I can tell you works beautifully with the

1442
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:38,740
Apple TV.

1443
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:39,740
Fun.

1444
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:40,740
Well, maybe I'd be into that.

1445
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:41,740
We'll see.

1446
01:08:41,740 --> 01:08:45,540
One game that looks awesome that I want to check out is Exit the Gungeon, which is, of

1447
01:08:45,540 --> 01:08:52,140
course, a follow up to Enter the Gungeon and is a side scroller type game now, but still

1448
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:53,140
a shooter.

1449
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:57,460
And they even changed the theme song to Exit the Gungeon, which is great.

1450
01:08:57,460 --> 01:08:58,460
Some other cool stuff.

1451
01:08:58,460 --> 01:09:00,600
So they have a game called Overland.

1452
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:04,540
It's kind of this apocalyptic road trip game.

1453
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:09,740
They've got Choo Choo Rocket Universe, Ballistic Baseball.

1454
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:10,740
What other cool stuff?

1455
01:09:10,740 --> 01:09:18,260
So yeah, the Pac-Man Party Royale, Projection First Light, Rayman Mini, looks like a new

1456
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:27,380
game, Shantae and the Seven Sirens, Sneaky Sasquatch, and Super Impossible Road.

1457
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:28,380
Lots of different games.

1458
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:31,620
I will give it to Apple as much as I'm a little bit like, I don't know what I want to play

1459
01:09:31,620 --> 01:09:36,260
on my phone versus, I will say this, like $4.99 is less than I thought it would be.

1460
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:39,500
I was for sure thinking it was going to be $9.99.

1461
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:47,220
And they're not just putting out like a couple things, like their TV service, sorry, but

1462
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:50,620
there's a lot of like big stuff here.

1463
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:54,460
And you know, putting the two side by side, I think this arcade stands to do better than

1464
01:09:54,460 --> 01:10:00,660
their TV service, which I don't think is ready for prime time, but that's just my opinion.

1465
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:01,660
But this looks great.

1466
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:04,940
Yeah, it does look pretty, it looks decent.

1467
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:06,540
I don't have any Apple devices.

1468
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:10,980
So whatever, on purchase, exit the Gungeon whenever that comes out.

1469
01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:13,460
I know, I know you're all about the Gungeon games.

1470
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:17,060
So when I first heard of exit the Gungeon, I was like, oh, I wonder if they took Loki's

1471
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:21,420
idea because you kind of did a different twist on the Gungeon theory.

1472
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:22,420
Oh, yeah.

1473
01:10:22,420 --> 01:10:23,420
Yeah.

1474
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:24,420
It's funny.

1475
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:25,420
So.

1476
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:26,420
All right.

1477
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:27,420
Anyway.

1478
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:28,420
Yeah.

1479
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:30,300
Apple Arcade coming out and that's really sets right around the time the new iPhone

1480
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:31,300
is coming out.

1481
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:34,100
Because of course, this is all part of that Apple announcement where what we had a new

1482
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:39,260
iPhone 11 with the triple triad camera.

1483
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:40,260
The new watch, right?

1484
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:41,260
There's a new watch.

1485
01:10:41,260 --> 01:10:42,260
There's the new...

1486
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:44,620
I feel like they, did they do a new computer?

1487
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:45,620
I don't know.

1488
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:50,180
I couldn't, I couldn't, I was in class so I couldn't watch or follow a live blog or

1489
01:10:50,180 --> 01:10:53,260
anything so I had to like get the data dump after the fact.

1490
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:57,900
So yeah, but I definitely saw that new phone because I don't know, like there was a part

1491
01:10:57,900 --> 01:11:00,340
of me was like, do I really need those three cameras?

1492
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:03,660
And then when I heard that it lets you take better animal pictures, I was like, yes I

1493
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:10,060
do.

1494
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:11,060
Come on.

1495
01:11:11,060 --> 01:11:12,340
You want the smoosh pics too.

1496
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:14,340
You know you do.

1497
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:16,860
All right.

1498
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:20,580
Let's move on and talk about something else to look forward to in the future.

1499
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:24,860
I don't know if this would be on iPhone or Android, but it's definitely something that'll

1500
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:28,460
be on the next round of consoles or maybe the current round, maybe the next round.

1501
01:11:28,460 --> 01:11:29,460
I don't know.

1502
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:31,780
But that is a new Mega Man game.

1503
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:32,780
That's right.

1504
01:11:32,780 --> 01:11:35,900
Mega Man has confirmed a new Mega Man game is in development.

1505
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:40,660
And that's great news because, you know, obviously Mega Man 11 came out and we all kind of think

1506
01:11:40,660 --> 01:11:42,820
it did well, but we haven't really had the hard facts to know that.

1507
01:11:42,820 --> 01:11:45,700
I still haven't played that other than the demo.

1508
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:48,900
Well, you know what, we're getting into the time of year where there's probably gonna

1509
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:49,900
be a ton of sales.

1510
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:53,220
If you want to pick up on it, you know, now I still haven't played through 9 or 10 either.

1511
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:55,860
I wish they'd do another X series.

1512
01:11:55,860 --> 01:12:00,040
Well to be fair, they did not say Mega Man 12 is happening.

1513
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:02,460
They said another Mega Man title is in development.

1514
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:04,220
In fact, let's get into the quotes.

1515
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:08,940
It was an interview with the site 4gamer who asked, what can you tell us about the next

1516
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:09,940
game to be developed?

1517
01:12:09,940 --> 01:12:13,780
The most recent game, Mega Man 11, was amazing, and we are expecting the revival of the Star

1518
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:14,780
Force series.

1519
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:17,860
Personally, I'd like to see the Command Mission saga be brought back.

1520
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:24,900
And in this interview with producer Kazuhiro Tsuchiya said, I see, there's a lot of titles

1521
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:27,960
I personally want to work on, but to tell you the truth, the next game to be developed

1522
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:29,480
has already been decided on.

1523
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:32,180
I'd just like to keep the specific details hidden for the moment.

1524
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:34,540
Please wait until we make an announcement.

1525
01:12:34,540 --> 01:12:35,820
Please look forward to it.

1526
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:39,780
Still, I think that there's no such thing as a spinoff in the Mega Man series.

1527
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:42,020
Every saga is a main series on its own.

1528
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:47,380
When speaking of Mega Man, there will always be people who think of X as well as people

1529
01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:49,220
who think of EXE.

1530
01:12:49,220 --> 01:12:54,780
And I think that's why each one's concept of what Mega Man is changes depending on the

1531
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:55,780
generation.

1532
01:12:55,780 --> 01:12:59,140
For that reason, we don't want to deny any series of its future.

1533
01:12:59,140 --> 01:13:00,140
Legends!

1534
01:13:00,140 --> 01:13:01,540
I want legends, dammit!

1535
01:13:01,540 --> 01:13:06,500
You beat me to it because I was going to say, at this time Kazuhiro Tsuchiya, I would

1536
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:11,820
like you to please consider three simple words, Mega Man Legends.

1537
01:13:11,820 --> 01:13:15,700
Come on, because it'd be way better now that the controls won't suck, right?

1538
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:16,700
Oh my God.

1539
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:17,700
But all right, fine.

1540
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:19,340
If they do an X game, cool.

1541
01:13:19,340 --> 01:13:22,420
But I think it is worth noting, he's not saying Mega Man 12.

1542
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:26,220
It could be, in fact, he's kind of shifting the conversation to be like, it's probably

1543
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:27,380
going to be something else.

1544
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:31,480
Or what was that Sonic game where they had like new Sonic and classic Sonic, let's have

1545
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:36,640
like X and let's get Mega Man X and regular Mega Man in there.

1546
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:37,640
I know what you're talking about.

1547
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:38,640
Sonic Generations.

1548
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:39,640
That's it, Generations.

1549
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:40,640
Yeah.

1550
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:41,640
So like, I want that.

1551
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:42,640
Let's just take all the different Mega Man types.

1552
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:44,980
We'll put it all into one game.

1553
01:13:44,980 --> 01:13:48,520
Like he can be a big RPG, open world.

1554
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:50,140
It's not too much to ask for, right?

1555
01:13:50,140 --> 01:13:52,320
I like the way that Nifty 805 put it.

1556
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:56,960
Category is legends only.

1557
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:57,960
I like that.

1558
01:13:57,960 --> 01:13:58,960
All right.

1559
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:03,040
Anyway, a new Mega Man coming soon, dot, dot, dot.

1560
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:04,040
All right.

1561
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:06,720
Uh, let's move on to the next story, Dark Sakura.

1562
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:09,000
I think you were referencing this earlier.

1563
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,360
Yes, I was.

1564
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:16,480
So in other corporate bullshit, don't you just love that introduction to the story?

1565
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:19,360
Kickstarter is now even more full of bullshit.

1566
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:22,960
They fired and actually it's a little bit incorrect because I think they've now fired

1567
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:29,760
three employees for participating in starting a union, which we've talked before about there

1568
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:33,200
being a massive need for unions in the video game industry.

1569
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:39,000
And Kickstarter definitely has like their, you know, hands, arms, feet, and legs somewhere

1570
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,440
attached to the video game industry and not in their own cart.

1571
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:44,640
Well, and if I remember right, what makes this video game related is that one of the

1572
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:50,640
people, maybe the first one that was let go was their like video game like liaison.

1573
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:55,040
And they had, um, like a guy who just started a podcast on it too, cause I follow him on

1574
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:56,040
Twitter.

1575
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:58,240
Oh, maybe it was the podcast person actually.

1576
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:00,640
I knew it was, I knew it was relevant to one of my interests.

1577
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:03,800
Well, I am so sad to hear that he's never going to be able to get his podcasts off the

1578
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:04,800
ground now.

1579
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,520
Actually he's got a new podcast and it's doing pretty well.

1580
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:11,840
So anyway, um, cause I mean there's other crowdsourcing things out there anyway, but

1581
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:14,360
he's already got name recognition on him.

1582
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:22,280
So, um, but at any rate, they fired several employees for starting, uh, to unionize.

1583
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:31,100
And um, and in fact I had a reposted it not long ago on my, uh, my thing, but they tried

1584
01:15:31,100 --> 01:15:36,480
to get him to sign an NDA to give him a month of severance after he had been with companies

1585
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:37,840
since it started.

1586
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:40,120
And he's like, no, I'm not signing your fucking NDA.

1587
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:41,280
I'm going to be public about it.

1588
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:43,400
And I'm like, good for you, dude.

1589
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:46,960
So, um, I mean he probably said it nicer than I did.

1590
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:52,080
So yeah, uh, Taylor Moore, um, said, and I'm going to read the quote this morning after

1591
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:55,940
six years of pouring my life into the mission people and creators of Kickstarter, I was

1592
01:15:55,940 --> 01:15:58,840
fired for union organizing.

1593
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:02,320
Last week, another member of the union organizing committee was fired and we have reason to

1594
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:05,260
believe that more are being targeted.

1595
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:08,900
The union busting campaign at Kickstarter that Kickstarter management is engaging in

1596
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:13,700
is illegal and wrong and is a dramatic abandonment of the values of an organization that I've

1597
01:16:13,700 --> 01:16:16,220
loved and served with my whole heart.

1598
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:19,220
Um, and in fact it actually is illegal.

1599
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:20,220
Union busting is illegal.

1600
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:25,920
Um, are, we have laws about this even though certain orange creatures in power are trying

1601
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:26,920
to undo that.

1602
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:31,020
Has Kickstarter responded trying to shift the conversation, trying to blame it on him

1603
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:32,020
or something?

1604
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:33,020
I mean, I don't know.

1605
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:34,020
I'm just curious if they've responded.

1606
01:16:34,140 --> 01:16:40,000
So, um, a Kickstarter, uh, spokesperson said this, when someone has been through this process

1607
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,620
and we have sufficient evidence that their performance is not improving, we must unfortunately

1608
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:44,620
part ways with them.

1609
01:16:44,620 --> 01:16:45,620
See what they're doing?

1610
01:16:45,620 --> 01:16:46,620
Mm hmm.

1611
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:49,900
This is not as interesting as the story about union busting, but it is the reality of what

1612
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:50,900
happened here.

1613
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:54,820
Not that it's fucking bullshit because this person has been with the company and started

1614
01:16:54,820 --> 01:16:59,420
very successful, um, uh, events.

1615
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:04,420
Why'd you keep this guy for six years if his performance was questionable?

1616
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:09,460
I mean, I know sometimes people can get senioritis and stuff and slip in their performance, but

1617
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:11,100
this does seem awfully convenient.

1618
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:13,160
Well, and there's more about this.

1619
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:18,300
The company also said that of 28 members who have publicly come out in support of the union,

1620
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:24,980
14 to 15 who are eligible for raise or promotion during this review cycle received one or both.

1621
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:29,400
It's still though, I mean, you can, so they're trying to say, don't

1622
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:30,400
look over here.

1623
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:31,400
Look over here.

1624
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:37,000
But on top of that, you can still perform well and want to benefit other people.

1625
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,440
You know, this is why I get all those, you know, I don't understand all these people

1626
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:47,360
who are like, well, you know, like they want to put a, um, a, uh, gosh, I can't make my

1627
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:48,360
words come out.

1628
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:55,480
Like for the people who want to tax anything over a higher income bracket and they're like,

1629
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:59,920
it's not affecting you personally, the money is going to go back into you.

1630
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:04,480
Just because these people are doing well doesn't mean they shouldn't contribute to the wellness

1631
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:05,480
of other people.

1632
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:09,680
And it's also kind of one of those, like, what about all the good things I did argument?

1633
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:11,200
It doesn't negate the bad thing.

1634
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:15,440
Well, I mean, there were medical advancements that came out of the Holocaust, but it was

1635
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:16,440
still bullshit.

1636
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:19,760
I wasn't going to go there, but you know, but I'm going to, I'm going to go there.

1637
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:21,980
I'm going to throw that as an example.

1638
01:18:21,980 --> 01:18:29,380
You know, good people will try more Liberty to do that than I do, but yeah, and, but anyway,

1639
01:18:29,380 --> 01:18:33,460
you know, and on top of that, they sell, send out an email.

1640
01:18:33,460 --> 01:18:39,940
The Kickstarter United group, um, uh, basically said that was a vile, a violation of their

1641
01:18:39,940 --> 01:18:45,020
public benefit pledge that the company made in 2015 and they're saying, Kickstarter United

1642
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:46,460
is under attack.

1643
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:49,220
This is what it means to be a public benefit corporation.

1644
01:18:49,220 --> 01:18:53,560
How can we continue to reconcile the discrepancies between the flaunting of our company's mission

1645
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:55,300
and the way we treat our employees?

1646
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:58,300
Are these a value of Kickstarter PPC?

1647
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:02,020
I'm going to be honest when it comes to this story, like I, and you know, all the, the

1648
01:19:02,020 --> 01:19:07,900
anti-union stuff is silly and you know, Kickstarter needs to just, you know, realize that they're

1649
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:09,540
on the wrong side of this.

1650
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:13,560
However, I'm kind of with Kai's, Judo's first comment here in chat, Kickstarter is still

1651
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:14,560
a thing.

1652
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:16,420
Like that's kinda like, I'm going to be honest, it's kind of where I'm at.

1653
01:19:16,420 --> 01:19:19,660
I'm trying to think, like, when was the last time I backed a Kickstarter?

1654
01:19:19,660 --> 01:19:24,040
Probably that and stream Kickstarter, which I don't, which I don't regret doing and stream

1655
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:25,720
has been a great service there.

1656
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:30,460
They're great on their discord and the service is coming along nicely.

1657
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:35,400
And part of the, a big part of the reason why I backed that one in particular was because

1658
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:39,020
they weren't asking me to fund something that hasn't even had a one line of code written

1659
01:19:39,020 --> 01:19:40,020
yet.

1660
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:42,660
They were essentially taken pre-orders through Kickstarter.

1661
01:19:42,660 --> 01:19:45,980
It's essentially what they were doing, trying to get kind of that seed money to get that

1662
01:19:45,980 --> 01:19:51,500
oomph out the door when we've seen too many Kickstarter projects crash, burn, fail, never

1663
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:52,500
get out the door.

1664
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:59,020
So too many projects, unfortunately like Bloodstained, but more so other big floppy projects have

1665
01:19:59,020 --> 01:20:01,020
kind of ruined it for everybody else.

1666
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:02,700
I did exactly three.

1667
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:04,540
We did Bloodstained.

1668
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:12,100
I did the asexual D20 pin, which I don't know where it is because my sash is missing.

1669
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:14,300
I think I lost it at Dracon.

1670
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:16,300
And then I did the hottiful boyfriend plushies.

1671
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:18,060
I'm not saying all Kickstarters are bad.

1672
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:23,200
Like I remember backing the first gamer X back in the day, which I don't regret doing.

1673
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:26,980
You know, it was a needed thing and I'm glad we had it for as long as we did, you know,

1674
01:20:26,980 --> 01:20:27,980
and all that.

1675
01:20:27,980 --> 01:20:30,340
Um, but like, I'm not saying all Kickstarter projects are bad.

1676
01:20:30,340 --> 01:20:34,620
I'm just saying because of all the weird things that have happened over the years, like I'm

1677
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:35,980
more apprehensive to do it.

1678
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:39,380
And I see less of them get promoted these days because so much of it gets lost in the

1679
01:20:39,380 --> 01:20:41,740
noise because you know what does get promoted.

1680
01:20:41,740 --> 01:20:44,740
Now it's a GoFundMe to pay so-and-so's medical bills.

1681
01:20:44,740 --> 01:20:49,020
That's the big thing you see all over Facebook, which is a whole nother commentary.

1682
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:53,140
I don't want to get into, but is that's where the conversation seems to be at.

1683
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:59,500
Whether or not though you believe in unions, this is highly suspect and it is illegal.

1684
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:04,740
It is illegal, especially, and even if it had nothing to do with it, I would still wait

1685
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:10,640
until there's like a gap of time between when this person just starts trying to unionize.

1686
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:14,080
You know, that just looks really shitty on you, Kickstarter.

1687
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:21,400
And on top of that, you know, one of my friends on my, one of my other Facebooks said, um,

1688
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:25,520
you know, but doesn't this harm the people who use Kickstarter to get their businesses

1689
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:27,560
started or don't have any other way to raise capital?

1690
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:29,880
I mean, there's other ways to raise capital.

1691
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:34,840
There are other crowdfunding sources on there and they are going to use this actively to

1692
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:36,340
protect their interests.

1693
01:21:36,340 --> 01:21:41,200
They are going to use their, the, the people who are using their service as their meat

1694
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:43,940
shield and we cannot let that happen.

1695
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:48,820
We have to show them using a meat shield like this is not going to help you.

1696
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:51,180
We will hold your ass to the fire.

1697
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:54,100
And then that means they stop using the meat shield hopefully when they see it's not going

1698
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:55,100
to do shit.

1699
01:21:55,100 --> 01:21:56,100
All right.

1700
01:21:56,100 --> 01:22:02,660
I, I encourage everyone at this point, look hard and deep into it and actually sit and

1701
01:22:02,660 --> 01:22:07,460
make a decision about it and make sure that if you continue to support them, you have

1702
01:22:07,460 --> 01:22:09,420
a damn good reason why you're doing it.

1703
01:22:09,420 --> 01:22:10,420
All right.

1704
01:22:10,420 --> 01:22:13,540
Well, with that, in the interest of time, we're going to move on to the next story.

1705
01:22:13,540 --> 01:22:16,580
So back to, uh, back to classic video game stuff.

1706
01:22:16,580 --> 01:22:20,900
One thing that, yeah, they're, they're not funded, but they're, they're sure a dime a

1707
01:22:20,900 --> 01:22:21,900
dozen these days.

1708
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:22,900
Yeah.

1709
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:26,380
We talked a little bit about this Neo Geo arcade stick that was out there that we didn't

1710
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:29,700
really know what it was aside from it's an arcade stick for the Neo Geo.

1711
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:32,620
Is it for like using on the Neo Geo?

1712
01:22:32,620 --> 01:22:33,960
I mean, what the hell is it?

1713
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:40,500
So apparently though, this is going to be, um, you can plug it into a PC to use it with,

1714
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:47,740
I guess, uh, PC games that, you know, SNK PC games, I would assume, or it can also be,

1715
01:22:47,740 --> 01:22:51,200
um, like a Neo Geo mini console.

1716
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:55,340
So you can actually hook up, um, other controllers to it as well.

1717
01:22:55,340 --> 01:23:01,980
It's got 20 classic Neo Geo games inside, so you can also attach to TV via HDMI 20 Neo

1718
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:02,980
Geo games.

1719
01:23:02,980 --> 01:23:06,920
So basically every king of fighters that they've made every fatal fury, every art of fighting

1720
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:08,060
and every samurai showdown.

1721
01:23:08,060 --> 01:23:09,060
That's 20 games, right?

1722
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:10,060
Oh shit.

1723
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:13,680
No, there's at least eight summary showdown games.

1724
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:17,220
And keep in mind, there's been a KOF game ever since 90, 94.

1725
01:23:17,220 --> 01:23:20,580
My joke there is that Neo Geo is like nothing but fighters, although we know, of course

1726
01:23:20,580 --> 01:23:23,460
there's other metal slug.

1727
01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:24,460
I know.

1728
01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:25,460
I know.

1729
01:23:25,460 --> 01:23:30,220
Uh, the, um, puzzle games, uh, puzzle bobble, all those games were, um, full star blazing

1730
01:23:30,220 --> 01:23:35,780
star, uh, magical drop one of my favorite puzzlers anyway, do we know what the list

1731
01:23:35,780 --> 01:23:37,180
of games that are on this yet?

1732
01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:38,180
Nope.

1733
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:39,180
Oh, no idea.

1734
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:40,180
Stay tuned kids.

1735
01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:41,180
Yep.

1736
01:23:41,180 --> 01:23:42,180
All right.

1737
01:23:42,180 --> 01:23:46,740
Well then, uh, let's move on and talk a little bit about, uh, something scary that, uh, is

1738
01:23:46,740 --> 01:23:48,780
going to be coming soon to your mobile phone.

1739
01:23:48,780 --> 01:23:52,340
It's a five nights at Freddy's AR game.

1740
01:23:52,340 --> 01:23:56,140
Uh, so five nights at Freddy's soon going to be moving to AR.

1741
01:23:56,140 --> 01:23:59,900
That sounds horrifying because when I first heard about this, I was like, Oh my God, is

1742
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:04,700
it like something for hololens that is going to tear, even though hololens really isn't

1743
01:24:04,700 --> 01:24:07,020
a gaming thing at this point is going to terrify me.

1744
01:24:07,020 --> 01:24:10,740
That's what I thought when I first read this, but no AR of course, uh, is becoming bigger

1745
01:24:10,740 --> 01:24:12,860
and bigger on iOS and Android.

1746
01:24:12,860 --> 01:24:17,700
So, uh, you know, like think like the Harry Potter game and Pokemon go have those AR so

1747
01:24:17,700 --> 01:24:21,360
you can actually do AR through your phone and that's how it's going to work.

1748
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:27,160
So, uh, yeah, it actually uses the air, the area around you to, uh, play five nights at

1749
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:30,660
Freddy's is called five nights at Freddy's AR special delivery.

1750
01:24:30,660 --> 01:24:33,000
It's being developed by illuminix.

1751
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:37,840
So I don't know to what extent the original creator, Scott Cawthon is, uh, involved with

1752
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:42,120
this, but he's also involved on other projects like the movie adaptation, which I guess really

1753
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:43,120
is coming in.

1754
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:46,120
I want to see the movie, even though I am not a fan of the game, I still want to see

1755
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:47,120
the movie.

1756
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:50,560
Apparently HD versions of the original games are going to be happening as well next year.

1757
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:53,080
And, uh, he's working on a triple a title apparently right now.

1758
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:59,120
So, uh, not just the AR game, but, uh, anyone interested in five nights at Freddy's on AR?

1759
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:00,120
I think that's cool.

1760
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:01,120
I don't know how it's going to work.

1761
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:02,120
It's going to be a little much.

1762
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:03,120
The VR game sounds cool.

1763
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:05,120
I'm like the cat gift that says nope.

1764
01:25:05,120 --> 01:25:06,760
Yeah.

1765
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:07,760
Too scary for me.

1766
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:11,480
At least it's on a little iPhone or Android or so it's not going to be too pure.

1767
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:17,520
I actually think like not having all the lights off and playing in the dark and that whole

1768
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:18,520
thing.

1769
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:22,040
Too bad when they say, you know, five nights at Freddy's AR game, they're not talking about

1770
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:24,680
like a Pokemon go type of game.

1771
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:25,680
Act deaf.

1772
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:26,680
Just like we have Pokemon go.

1773
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:27,680
Now we have five nights.

1774
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,680
Run the fuck away.

1775
01:25:28,680 --> 01:25:32,080
Both, both ends of the spectrum, both ends of the spectrum there.

1776
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:33,080
Love it.

1777
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:34,080
All right.

1778
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:37,600
Well, let's take a trip down memory lane to a more classic time when you know, games,

1779
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:39,040
games weren't AR.

1780
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:40,040
They were not.

1781
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:41,120
I was trying to find the music.

1782
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:44,840
If you wanted AR, you had to like draw things and put them up on your TV.

1783
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:45,840
No, I don't know.

1784
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:50,160
All right.

1785
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:52,280
It's the classic game of the week.

1786
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:54,680
Every week, dark soccer steps in the gaming vault and finds the game.

1787
01:25:54,680 --> 01:25:57,400
She thinks, Hey, you guys should be respecting this game.

1788
01:25:57,400 --> 01:26:00,200
Little surprise to your pick this week inspired by a tattoo I saw.

1789
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:01,200
Ah, okay.

1790
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:03,520
Cause I was like, not the type of game dark soccer usually talks about.

1791
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:08,080
No, but it's, it's relevant, I guess it's a, it's a, it's kind of a big deal for some

1792
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:09,080
people.

1793
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:10,080
Yeah.

1794
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:14,880
So, um, the game I picked was God of war.

1795
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:20,120
And I mean, I honestly, I watched like a full play through of the last God of war game and

1796
01:26:20,120 --> 01:26:21,120
I thought it looked pretty good.

1797
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:23,080
So if it led to that, then this is cool.

1798
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:27,880
But anyway, it's a third person hack and slash adventure that was developed by Santa Monica

1799
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:30,840
studio and published by Sony.

1800
01:26:30,840 --> 01:26:36,680
It came out March 22nd, 2005 for the PlayStation two is the first one in a long series and

1801
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:42,880
it is very loosely based on Greek mythology set in ancient Greece.

1802
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:51,520
You control Kratos who is a Spartan who serves the gods and Athena sells Kratos to go kill

1803
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:52,760
Ares.

1804
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:58,680
Um, and basically Ares did some bullshit and tricked him into killing his wife and daughter

1805
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:03,040
and was besieging Athens and all kinds of shit.

1806
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:14,320
So anyway, it is a big combat, you know, type of combo game where, uh, your main, uh, weapon,

1807
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:19,560
the blades of chaos, um, you work, uh, you basically are going to use that weapon.

1808
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:20,720
I think you can like another one in the game.

1809
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:26,700
I actually haven't played it, but it has different quick, hi smoosh, but, um, it has different

1810
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:30,440
quick time events in the game that you have to do through controller actions.

1811
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:32,640
Um, it's involved in the boss battles too.

1812
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:39,400
It has some puzzles and platforming, um, and it actually was, uh, at the time the 11th

1813
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:41,800
best PlayStation two game of all time now.

1814
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:47,880
So 4.6 million copies worldwide and it won several game of the year awards.

1815
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:53,920
Um, IGN considered it as a 2009 to be the seventh best PS two game of all time.

1816
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:56,920
It had great graphics, story, gameplay.

1817
01:27:56,920 --> 01:28:00,200
It was just really a tight ship with that.

1818
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:06,000
And then that and its sequel were released in November, 2009 as the God of War collection

1819
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:11,320
and then a remastered version in 2012 as God of War saga for PS three.

1820
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:16,880
There was a novelization and a film adaptation has been in development since 2005.

1821
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:24,560
Um, and you fight all kinds of new mythological creatures, the undead minotaurs, Gorgons,

1822
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:31,840
clopsies, sirens, uh, different bosses, and a minotaur called Pandora's guardian.

1823
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:33,440
I just think that's a cool name.

1824
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:39,720
Um, you also open chest, they have orbs and orbs do shit like heal you and give you experience

1825
01:28:39,720 --> 01:28:41,000
and stuff.

1826
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:47,040
Um, and you get like special items that make you stronger and give you more help than magic

1827
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:48,520
and stuff like that.

1828
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:51,760
Um, but you use the blades of chaos in the game.

1829
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:56,160
They are blades attached to chains, they're wrapped around the wrists and forearms and

1830
01:28:56,160 --> 01:29:00,880
the, they are used in special types of attacks and I'm sure if anyone's watching live right

1831
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:05,840
now, you can see how you can swing them out or use them in close quarters as a melee weapon.

1832
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:10,880
So it's quite fierce, it is hardcore.

1833
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:21,520
And then, um, there also is a quick time, but looky mini game where you have to do female

1834
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:22,520
twins.

1835
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:23,520
Anyway.

1836
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:29,040
Um, so yeah, um, then you get the challenge of the gods after you've beaten the game,

1837
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:34,720
which is an unlockable, and um, you have to complete certain tasks and then with that,

1838
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:37,880
you get costumes, behind the scenes videos, and concept art.

1839
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:43,400
So you get, instead of like, oh, you do well, let's give you some, you know, levels that

1840
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:48,720
are gonna just make you cry for an hour, here's actually stuff that you'll enjoy.

1841
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:56,440
And um, so the game has, you know, clearly had some staying power if we, you know, just,

1842
01:29:56,440 --> 01:30:01,780
not too long ago, the last game that came out was really good and added sort of another,

1843
01:30:01,780 --> 01:30:07,280
I would say angle to the character kind of, if anything, I think humanized him a bit more,

1844
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:14,960
even though he's now like this hardcore old god kind of guy now in the last game, right?

1845
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,480
Yeah, I gotta admit, like talking about this game makes me, you know, I kind of missed

1846
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:23,320
the boat on this recent reimagining, I guess you will, of God of War where Kratos is now

1847
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:28,080
like daddy Kratos, um, and I was super interested in that game just because of the different

1848
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:33,840
tone and just sounding like the, um, the maturity, not to say this game was immature, it's not,

1849
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:38,000
but like, well it did have the like, gooey mini game, but like, you know, the certain

1850
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:43,000
maturity of the developers in, as they're getting older, in wanting to make a game that

1851
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:46,360
kind of reflects that, like I just found that really fascinating and kind of interesting

1852
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:51,120
and like that was, and everybody says it's great, but you know, the thing is here, yes,

1853
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:54,240
we do a podcast about video games, we love video games, we don't have enough time to

1854
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:57,560
play every single game that gets released, you know, sometimes we miss things, but that

1855
01:30:57,560 --> 01:31:00,840
one I've been meaning to pick up. I wanted to touch on this just because it is kind of

1856
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:05,480
near and dear to a lot of people, but you know, I do also like that storytelling now

1857
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:11,120
is really taking a bigger level of maturity to it and that people are being more sensitive

1858
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:15,840
to their audiences and actually trying, you know, the fan service is there, yeah, but

1859
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:20,880
you are also getting quite a bit more of, yeah, you have the fan service there, but

1860
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:27,720
it's a bonus to the good story and gameplay. But at any rate, the game itself is built

1861
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:34,720
on the Kinetica engine and it was inspired by two things, by Onimusha and by Clash of

1862
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:41,040
the Titans. I figured Clash of the Titans, I didn't figure Onimusha, that's neat.

1863
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:48,040
David Jaff, who, you know, was the game director and creator, he said that he had played Onimusha

1864
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:57,460
and said, let's do that with Greek mythology and then of course watching Clash of the Titans,

1865
01:31:57,460 --> 01:32:02,120
he wanted to take that concept and kind of merge it with Heavy Metal, not like the movie,

1866
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:06,600
but like Heavy Metal magazine, which I mean the movie came from Heavy Metal magazine.

1867
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:13,720
And then he wanted to just bump up this to being really high level sex and violence.

1868
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:21,120
But then, you know, they wanted it brutal, they wanted it to be terrible, they wanted

1869
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:27,640
you to be a beast, but, you know, I think also that's kind of what the popularity and

1870
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:32,080
things were at that time was pushing those things and I think they've realized that you

1871
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:39,080
can have those things and have a mature story, have good storytelling, have great gameplay,

1872
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:46,800
and have it still be brutal and hard. At any rate, yeah, there have been, you know, like

1873
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:52,840
I said, there were multiple re-releases, there was, you know, lots of, you know, the soundtrack

1874
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:58,600
for it was actually pretty amazing. It had its own release on there and it was actually

1875
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:02,560
considered one of the best soundtracks that came out and that soundtrack was released

1876
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:07,800
in 2010, again, as downloadable content for the God of War trilogy soundtrack and God

1877
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:14,400
of War III Ultimate Edition. But it was received very well, the story was considered compelling

1878
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:20,520
and it won many, like I said, Game of the Year awards and David Jaff won Designer of

1879
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:26,080
the Year awards, I don't know if I'm mispronouncing his name, but whatever. And then there was,

1880
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:29,960
you know, a novelization about it, which I might actually bother to read the novelization.

1881
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:34,640
But, you know, whenever they do novelizations, they'll usually, like, get more elements that

1882
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:40,520
they want to put into the story, so I kind of dig those. And there's a film in, well,

1883
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:47,520
that's been announced in 2005. In development hell. They actually sent the script out to

1884
01:33:50,420 --> 01:33:55,840
Daniel Craig and he turned it down. And then they said they've got someone else on there

1885
01:33:55,840 --> 01:34:01,320
for it and they might like them. And they were bringing in the writers for Pacific Rim,

1886
01:34:01,320 --> 01:34:06,480
so Pacific Rim was great. Second one, I didn't see it, not so much. But hey, I'll believe

1887
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:09,080
it when I see it. But there you go, it's God of War.

1888
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:14,960
Alright, your classic game of the week, God of War for the PlayStation 2. That's right,

1889
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:21,960
the PlayStation 2 is a classic console. Under our 10 years or more rule, a lot of PS3 games

1890
01:34:22,680 --> 01:34:29,680
qualify as well. So, there it is. Alright, anyhow. Yeah, a series that I've played a

1891
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:33,440
little bit, but I've more, like, watched my friends play it. I haven't really got my hands

1892
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:38,560
on it myself. I would definitely, even if you don't play the game, just watch this last

1893
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:41,400
one. Well, even just, oh, the last one. I was gonna say, you were just putting together

1894
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:44,920
the footage for tonight. I was kind of, like, watching it going, oh, yeah, yeah, I remember

1895
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:50,400
this. So, yeah, I definitely wanna, it's one of those things, like, it's on my list. I'll

1896
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:55,960
get to that at some point. Horizon Zero Dawn, eventually. They're, like, on a list.

1897
01:34:55,960 --> 01:34:59,440
So, it's Jaffe, pardon me. Yeah, it's alright. I didn't really care anything about God of

1898
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:02,960
War until I watched the playthrough of the last one. Gotcha. I would probably skip the

1899
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:09,160
first two, honestly, just because the last one was so, so much more interesting to me.

1900
01:35:09,160 --> 01:35:12,320
Yeah. Well, they have that trilogy to the, like, you know, if you wanna catch up, they

1901
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:17,880
have that trilogy they put on PS4. We've got them somewhere in the vault. Just, I haven't

1902
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:22,360
cared enough, but this last one, you know, was definitely enough to make me wanna sit

1903
01:35:22,360 --> 01:35:26,720
down and watch it and actually show some interest in playing it. And Questbuster kinda agrees

1904
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:30,480
there, saying the new God of War is rock solid and they added in a few things with patches.

1905
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:34,480
Alright, well, we're gonna go to our, uh, a little break here in studio. Um, I'm very

1906
01:35:34,480 --> 01:35:39,560
happy because tonight we have a listener community submission for our break tonight. So, Darktetsuya,

1907
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:45,080
uh, often kinda gets associated with this game series, La Mulana. Yes. And so, we kinda,

1908
01:35:45,080 --> 01:35:49,120
like, tongue in cheek make fun of him, but in a positive way for his love of La Mulana.

1909
01:35:49,120 --> 01:35:54,040
But what I love that Darktetsuya has done is he's fucking owning it. And so, in a discussion,

1910
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:57,800
he's gonna talk about this a little bit in the video, but because La Mulana 2, uh, they're

1911
01:35:57,800 --> 01:36:01,800
talking about this for consoles and so forth, he decided, you know what, let's, let's, let's

1912
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:07,040
show people this game that I always, uh, still have to play it. I think I have it in my library.

1913
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:11,040
So this is about seven minutes and I'm just saying that because the audio, I think I fixed

1914
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:15,160
the audio and I think it'll come through okay. Um, but you know, there is a lot of, um, like,

1915
01:36:15,160 --> 01:36:20,040
visuals to this. So I, I was like, do I leave it in the podcast? Do I not? So I think ultimately

1916
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:23,320
I'm gonna leave it in just so you guys can hear from Darktetsuya and why he likes La,

1917
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:28,040
La Mulana so much. But if you find that you're not really, like, not being able to see it is

1918
01:36:28,040 --> 01:36:31,480
kind of bothering you, then I am telling you it's about seven minutes long if you want to go ahead

1919
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:35,960
and fast forward. But, uh, for those of you that are, uh, watching live, uh, here you go. We're

1920
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:42,120
gonna go to a break segment here where Darktetsuya is going to talk about his love of La Mulana.

1921
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:48,280
Okay. Hello everybody. It's, uh, Darktetsuya here. So I thought I would try and do a, uh,

1922
01:36:48,280 --> 01:36:54,520
break video for, uh, friends over at OLR. And what better game to do it on than one that was

1923
01:36:54,520 --> 01:37:02,440
just recently announced. So this last week was PAX, right? And they announced that the American

1924
01:37:02,440 --> 01:37:06,200
version of La Mulana 2 coming to console is actually going to include the original. So

1925
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:11,080
thought I might show you a little bit of the beginning of the game here, show you what you're

1926
01:37:11,080 --> 01:37:20,040
in for. Probably hear my name come up every time this game comes up, so.

1927
01:37:23,160 --> 01:37:26,600
Yeah, I know a thing or two about this one. So yeah, start off. You come in here,

1928
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:34,440
see how far I can get in maybe, maybe 10 minutes, maybe a little less. So yeah, this elder's all

1929
01:37:34,440 --> 01:37:43,400
pud. Let's see. So he'll explain to you what's, what's going on. You have to enter the ruins,

1930
01:37:43,400 --> 01:37:44,920
ruins of La Mulana, find your dad.

1931
01:37:44,920 --> 01:37:52,120
Okay, so let's see. Yep. Take your laptop, get an upgrade. All right.

1932
01:37:54,120 --> 01:37:58,120
And yeah, he'll send you, uh, emails during the game to give you hints and whatnot.

1933
01:37:58,120 --> 01:38:06,040
Okay, so let's see. Next stop. Oh, where is it? Actually, no. I, oh, well, there it is. Yeah.

1934
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:09,800
By this item, it's a hand scanner. It was inspired by a real, uh,

1935
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:15,800
peripheral they made for the, uh, MSX system. Yeah. The original version of that came out,

1936
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:23,880
what was it, 2005. It was a freeware indie game. Oh, there's something I need to get first. Yeah.

1937
01:38:23,880 --> 01:38:29,400
It's a freeware indie game. The developers loved all the games to the old MSX computer system.

1938
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:34,600
So they took a lot of the inspiration from some of those games that they played,

1939
01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:38,120
created this, uh, freeware game. Let's see.

1940
01:38:40,120 --> 01:38:43,240
Now I'm, now I'm forgetting where I need to, oh, wait, I know where I need to go.

1941
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:52,120
Two minutes. Well, should be, oh, why did I do that? Anyway. Yeah. So that was originally released

1942
01:38:52,760 --> 01:39:03,240
for freeware on PC in about 2005, I believe, 2005, 2006. And, uh, yeah, it was a freeware indie game.

1943
01:39:03,880 --> 01:39:11,480
And, uh, Aeon Genesis was a translation group. They, uh, translated the game into English.

1944
01:39:13,720 --> 01:39:17,640
And then guy by the name of Deceased Crab made it famous on YouTube. And

1945
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:19,880
that's kind of where I discovered it.

1946
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:29,800
So anyway, yeah. Come up here. Got these birds. Okay. Yeah. Hold that. Push down to use weights

1947
01:39:29,800 --> 01:39:35,960
on these pedestals. You know, just like in Indiana Jones. Kill the snake here and shell horn.

1948
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:41,320
Maybe you trigger a trap or solve a puzzle, you'll hear noise. It's different for each, but

1949
01:39:43,880 --> 01:39:50,840
yeah. So very useful item if you're first playing the game. If you're speed running it,

1950
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:56,200
you probably won't need it, but I'm not at that level yet. Let's see if I can,

1951
01:39:57,160 --> 01:40:04,120
ah, come on. I just, I'll just drop down then. I kill this guy. Oh, I don't have any weights.

1952
01:40:04,120 --> 01:40:11,160
Really? Well, I have to come here. Is there a weight in here? Nope.

1953
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:15,720
I didn't want to have to detour to buy.

1954
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:23,400
Nope. Dang it. Well, that's gonna, nope.

1955
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:33,400
Anyway. Yeah. I'll try not to make this too long, but yeah. It's,

1956
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:38,520
all right. So what do we got? We'll go in the shop here. Yeah, there we go. Okay.

1957
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:47,720
That should do us for now. It's funny, yeah. I, watching his videos of the game, it looked like

1958
01:40:47,720 --> 01:40:54,680
fun. Okay, actually the videos that we're watching is the, uh, I started with the, uh, the bonus

1959
01:40:54,680 --> 01:41:03,000
dungeon, uh, Hell Temple. I would not recommend going in there. It is not fun. Anyway, yeah.

1960
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:04,760
See, end of the ruins here.

1961
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:13,160
Oh, wait a minute. I have to equip that. Yeah, that's just Cellpud telling you something.

1962
01:41:14,120 --> 01:41:22,440
Say, I read this. They lurk within this land over deals. So yeah. Then this. Okay.

1963
01:41:24,680 --> 01:41:44,520
So I really didn't want to talk over that part. That intro is just amazing. You step into the

1964
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:50,920
temple for the first time, and you hear that, like, the adventure begins here. So yeah. Now,

1965
01:41:50,920 --> 01:41:52,600
this item you need to get to get a...

1966
01:41:56,200 --> 01:42:02,600
Anyway, yeah. Let's see. See, yeah. See, yeah. That's solving a puzzle. Step on that tomb.

1967
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:06,280
Step on that tile there. Sacred Orb. Sacred Orb gives you some extra life.

1968
01:42:08,120 --> 01:42:15,720
Anyway, yeah. So come down here. Yeah. Let's see. All right.

1969
01:42:15,720 --> 01:42:22,360
So yeah. You know, you got enemies to kill, bosses to fight, these little skeleton guys.

1970
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:25,480
Oh yeah. There's an item you need to buy to get, to be able to read those,

1971
01:42:26,920 --> 01:42:29,000
but that's up on the surface. Let's see.

1972
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:37,480
Um, why don't I end the video with this? Let's see. Do I have a way? Okay, yeah.

1973
01:42:38,200 --> 01:42:39,960
Sometimes there's traps, like this one.

1974
01:42:39,960 --> 01:42:51,000
Yep. Uh, anything else I have to say about the game? I mean, not really.

1975
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,640
I mean, it's... I think it's a lot of fun. I...

1976
01:42:57,640 --> 01:43:01,640
Definitely pretty hard, though. I would absolutely recommend a walkthrough.

1977
01:43:01,640 --> 01:43:10,440
Either a video walkthrough or game facts or, uh, what is that? Or there's a wiki, you know?

1978
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:16,040
But yeah, this is coming out early 2020 for consoles.

1979
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:20,360
There is also the sequel that's going to be included.

1980
01:43:22,200 --> 01:43:27,160
Apparently a lot of the, uh, they made some tweaks to the, uh, hint system to help you get,

1981
01:43:28,120 --> 01:43:32,680
to help you get, figure out where you need to go. And a lot of that is going to be retrofitted into

1982
01:43:32,680 --> 01:43:38,360
the first game, so I thought that was neat. There's a, uh, there was a panel at PAX that

1983
01:43:38,360 --> 01:43:42,200
they recorded that I definitely recommend looking up, so...

1984
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:51,560
Yeah, you know, exploring the ruins, solving puzzles, and trying to avoid traps, it's...

1985
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:53,320
I enjoyed it!

1986
01:43:53,800 --> 01:43:54,600
Anyway.

1987
01:43:57,560 --> 01:44:00,440
Anything else I have to say on this? I mean, not really.

1988
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:08,920
Anyway, yeah. I guess that was a brief look at, uh, La Mulana coming soon to consoles early 2020.

1989
01:44:12,040 --> 01:44:14,360
So, maybe I'll do a video on this.

1990
01:44:16,120 --> 01:44:20,520
All right, there it is. Thank you, Dr. Tuye, for that submission there for, uh, La Mulana.

1991
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:23,480
For that submission there for, uh, La Mulana.

1992
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:26,920
Uh, appreciate that. Uh, and some folks, some folks in chat, very nice,

1993
01:44:26,920 --> 01:44:32,600
give me some helpful advice there, uh, about, uh, you know, uh, talking while playing video games.

1994
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:37,560
It's hard. It's a hard thing to do, but yeah, when we do those, and that's why I don't always make the

1995
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:42,360
break videos myself because, um, you know, trying to narrate the video game I'm playing can sometimes

1996
01:44:42,360 --> 01:44:46,920
be a pain in the butt. And Bobby's, Bobby's needling me on the whole, uh, the DragonCon

1997
01:44:46,920 --> 01:44:49,640
thing we did where we were trying to play Overwatch. It was just, it was just too much,

1998
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:53,400
like, going on at once. We had to, like, dial it back. I need to teach you the power of voiceover,

1999
01:44:53,400 --> 01:44:59,800
Rob. Well, girl, I know how to talk, you know, but. Yeah, but you can record the footage.

2000
01:45:00,680 --> 01:45:05,320
Which is a great suggestion that came up in chat is that you can also record the footage

2001
01:45:05,320 --> 01:45:11,080
first and then. That's how I'm going to be doing my sim stuff. Yeah, yeah. So, um, but I super

2002
01:45:11,080 --> 01:45:16,200
appreciate, uh, that Dr. Tuye sent that in and I welcome anybody in our community that has a game

2003
01:45:16,200 --> 01:45:20,840
that they love like that, that they want to share with the show. Uh, please feel free to send in

2004
01:45:20,840 --> 01:45:27,080
your submission, but do, do file that in the back of your mind that it is a podcast as well. And so

2005
01:45:27,080 --> 01:45:31,800
you have to kind of think of both and it's not an easy thing to do. Trust me, you know, that's,

2006
01:45:31,800 --> 01:45:36,680
that's, and that's one reason why here at OLR, I feel like we've been challenged with,

2007
01:45:36,680 --> 01:45:40,680
we've got the radio, we've got the talking part down because this is what we've been doing for

2008
01:45:40,680 --> 01:45:45,800
17 years. It's the visual part of the show that we've been like, I know this is not the

2009
01:45:45,800 --> 01:45:49,800
most nice looking studio in the world and everything. That's the part where we're

2010
01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:54,440
challenged is making it more visually compelling, visually challenged without having to spend my

2011
01:45:54,440 --> 01:45:58,440
entire Sunday doing B-roll before the show, but you know, little bits here and there go a long

2012
01:45:58,440 --> 01:46:02,920
way. So anyway, we're all working to improve. Anyway. Uh, let's move on though. Cause we,

2013
01:46:02,920 --> 01:46:05,960
you know, we have been actually speaking and talking, we've been doing it for a while.

2014
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:10,120
We're coming up on eight o'clock here on the West coast. And I want to make sure we have some time

2015
01:46:10,120 --> 01:46:14,520
to get some calls if there are any calls tonight. So let's get into some rapid fire news as we

2016
01:46:14,520 --> 01:46:19,080
travel around the industry this week and see what else has been going on in gaming news.

2017
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:23,720
So this is very cool. So this is a great game that came out on the Xbox 360 and PC and Wabaks.

2018
01:46:23,720 --> 01:46:28,920
So Castle Crashers is being remastered. It is coming now to PlayStation four and

2019
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:36,920
Nintendo switch on September 17th. They are going to be improving the textures and bumping the, uh,

2020
01:46:37,640 --> 01:46:43,160
the FPS to 60 and, um, including all previously released DLC.

2021
01:46:44,600 --> 01:46:49,400
So that'll be something to look forward to and it looks awesome. I'll have to check it out.

2022
01:46:50,280 --> 01:46:54,680
If you want to play Castle Crashers yet again, but it is a really good game. I can't sound too

2023
01:46:54,680 --> 01:46:59,160
shady. Um, and then this is kind of cool. So I watched a little bit of a video about this,

2024
01:46:59,640 --> 01:47:07,960
called the floor is lava, the video game, which it's, it's great. So it's by the developers,

2025
01:47:07,960 --> 01:47:14,600
uh, who did don't starve. And it's, uh, it's kind of funny because they have this,

2026
01:47:14,600 --> 01:47:23,560
like almost like a parody GI Joe, um, you know, uh, type of cartoon thing that goes along with

2027
01:47:23,560 --> 01:47:32,280
it as well. So they, uh, like they call it the G A T and it was just, it was really kind of funny,

2028
01:47:32,280 --> 01:47:35,720
the, just the detail that they put into it. But yeah, it's, it's like what you would think it

2029
01:47:35,720 --> 01:47:41,720
would be. It's like a parkour type of game with the floor being lava. Do your kids play that at

2030
01:47:41,720 --> 01:47:47,480
home? The floor is lava. Um, they have probably played that in a Roblox. So I'm sure that they

2031
01:47:47,480 --> 01:47:52,040
played several Roblox games that are like that, but this is also something that's also coming to

2032
01:47:52,040 --> 01:47:57,720
Apple arcade as well. But, um, it is coming out on PC as well. You can book, you know, um,

2033
01:47:58,600 --> 01:48:02,120
favorite it on steam or whatever. So look for, yeah, hot lava.

2034
01:48:03,080 --> 01:48:07,560
Uh, jumping back to the castle crashers, one, a great tip in our chat from DJ Rama S who says,

2035
01:48:07,560 --> 01:48:13,560
FYI, if you already have castle crashers on Xbox 360, you can get the remastered version for $4.99.

2036
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:17,480
You buy it under the same gamer tag as the original game. Well, I love that little,

2037
01:48:17,480 --> 01:48:20,840
little incentive for having bought the game before. Um, and I should have mentioned,

2038
01:48:20,840 --> 01:48:26,040
I didn't mention already, uh, games coming out in September 19. So very soon the lava game,

2039
01:48:26,040 --> 01:48:30,760
yeah, hot lava. So, uh, check it out. Okay. Well, let's move on to another game,

2040
01:48:30,760 --> 01:48:34,760
uh, coming soon that I don't know. I felt like it had some mixed reaction when we first talked

2041
01:48:34,760 --> 01:48:41,560
about it, but, uh, Contra rogue core is a game that's, I think they showed off some more footage

2042
01:48:41,560 --> 01:48:46,840
during Tokyo game show. They didn't just do footage. There's actually a demo that came out,

2043
01:48:46,840 --> 01:48:52,840
uh, a demo for Contra rogue core is available. Is it core or corpse? I think core. That's what

2044
01:48:52,840 --> 01:48:56,840
I thought core because corpse sounds like everybody's already dead. That's what I thought.

2045
01:48:57,800 --> 01:49:02,360
Well, Hey, it's, it's a pronunciation thing I got right for a change. So let's celebrate that.

2046
01:49:02,360 --> 01:49:06,840
All right. Anyway, so Contra rogue core, uh, a demo came out on PlayStation four,

2047
01:49:06,840 --> 01:49:12,840
Xbox one and Nintendo switch on all the different digital stores. Uh, and you get to dive into the

2048
01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:17,960
damn city. That's actually what it's called. It's damned city. So you get to dive into the damn

2049
01:49:17,960 --> 01:49:23,000
city and actually play a little bit of the game. Uh, he, the demo is part of the single player

2050
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:28,200
campaign of the twins, twin stick, third person shooter, a playable preview of one of the many

2051
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:33,160
large scale bosses in the game. Now I did not get a chance to check out the demo myself,

2052
01:49:33,160 --> 01:49:37,800
but I thought that some of you or some of you guys, uh, had, because I know dark Tetsuya,

2053
01:49:38,440 --> 01:49:41,480
I almost wish you'd done a video for that. I guess I should, I shouldn't say it because

2054
01:49:41,480 --> 01:49:45,560
the Llamulana thing was great. And to be fair to dark to see it, he actually did the Llamulana

2055
01:49:45,560 --> 01:49:50,760
thing last week. We didn't do it last week. Cause you had your footage from the, uh, the

2056
01:49:50,760 --> 01:49:55,560
indie event that you went to. So we had to push it back a week, but, uh, I would like to see the demo

2057
01:49:55,560 --> 01:50:00,520
if I don't get my hands on it myself this week. Um, dark to see it says in chat, I played the

2058
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:05,720
Contra demo and I actually really enjoyed it. And orange right also confirms its core because the

2059
01:50:05,720 --> 01:50:11,960
Genesis game was hardcore. And that was, you know, it's a kind of play on words there with

2060
01:50:11,960 --> 01:50:15,720
that when you do it that way. So anyway, I'm pretty cool that they actually released a demo.

2061
01:50:15,720 --> 01:50:23,560
I feel like we never talk about video game demos anymore in this day and age. So, um, yeah, I, um,

2062
01:50:23,560 --> 01:50:27,400
I don't have a lot of us to say with that. Uh, Hey, I got a pinch hit here live. Loki,

2063
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:32,600
can you do my second story? Cause the website will not work on this, uh, beast over here.

2064
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:36,680
Oh, it's it doesn't like the windows XP, I guess. I guess it's, it's more the,

2065
01:50:36,680 --> 01:50:40,040
I think it's cause I'm using Chrome over here. I don't know. But anyway, it's just move on.

2066
01:50:41,160 --> 01:50:46,040
So I think this is a really, I want to talk about this. Yeah. So super Nintendo world,

2067
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:51,000
of course is the theme park. That's supposed to be coming soon to universal parks and we've

2068
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:57,400
got some more details on when that might be happening. So, uh, they wanted it by 2020 for

2069
01:50:57,400 --> 01:51:01,960
the Tokyo, at least the Tokyo version for the Olympics. Right. So the first version,

2070
01:51:01,960 --> 01:51:08,280
I think is supposed to be coming to Japan, but I don't believe that it's going to make 2020.

2071
01:51:08,280 --> 01:51:14,760
Uh, bummer. Yeah. So I thought I saw like, was it 20, 22, but, um, well, the cut,

2072
01:51:14,760 --> 01:51:18,040
the parts I thought were cool is that they were talking about like a wristband that was supposed

2073
01:51:18,040 --> 01:51:22,040
to interact with the switch as well. Like there was actually going to be like interaction between,

2074
01:51:22,040 --> 01:51:26,280
Oh good. More crap. I get the buy, but yeah, I think it's neat though. So yeah,

2075
01:51:26,280 --> 01:51:29,000
they're talking a little bit about how they're going to, you know, of course they have a super

2076
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:34,520
Mario cart ride and Yoshi's adventure ride are two of the first rides that they're going to have

2077
01:51:34,520 --> 01:51:40,680
there in phase one. Um, Oh, they could do it in phases like star Wars land. It says, yeah,

2078
01:51:40,680 --> 01:51:45,640
you're gonna have this wristband. That's got a big red Mario symbol on it. And it says, by the way,

2079
01:51:45,640 --> 01:51:51,240
the wristband is super cool. It's magnetic. You slap it on your wrist and it just snaps on there.

2080
01:51:51,240 --> 01:51:59,000
Yeah. Flat bracelet. Yes. Snap bracelet and allows you to, um, uh, on it, see a Tiberian

2081
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:07,640
chat says, yeah, excuse me. Yay. Crap. It allows you to, uh, interact with, um, stuff all over the

2082
01:52:07,640 --> 01:52:13,080
different lands. So they said they have three different levels. The first day of, um, Bowser's

2083
01:52:13,080 --> 01:52:18,360
deal and Prince's peaches castle. Um, they have different key elements. You actually get to walk

2084
01:52:18,360 --> 01:52:21,720
through Prince's peaches castle. Like it's sleeping beauty's castle Disneyland. That's so

2085
01:52:21,720 --> 01:52:27,080
cool. Uh, maybe, but yeah, apparently you'll be able to go up and keep score with various games.

2086
01:52:27,800 --> 01:52:31,720
Um, so that's kind of cool. You know what it kind of sounds like a little bit is like, um,

2087
01:52:31,720 --> 01:52:36,760
toy story, uh, the, the midway mania and Disneyland. And I remember the midway mania

2088
01:52:36,760 --> 01:52:41,160
had an app like, it wasn't there like an iPhone midway mania game. I swear that was a thing.

2089
01:52:41,160 --> 01:52:45,240
And like, if you actually play and here's the, you could turn the GPS on because if you actually

2090
01:52:45,240 --> 01:52:51,080
play toy story, midway mania wall in line for toy story based on your GPS, you unlocked like

2091
01:52:51,080 --> 01:52:56,840
a special thing in the game. So I like it when the games kind of do things like that. Cause you know

2092
01:52:56,840 --> 01:53:01,640
what you get. If you play Harry positor, if you play Harry Potter, wizards unite at universal

2093
01:53:01,640 --> 01:53:07,400
studios, Harry Potter world, you know what you get? What? Nothing. So I like it when games kind

2094
01:53:07,400 --> 01:53:11,160
of do stuff like that. So I think this will charge you additional money to get a Harry

2095
01:53:11,160 --> 01:53:17,560
Potter badge or something like that. Fuck all the way off. To be honest. Uh, let's see.

2096
01:53:17,560 --> 01:53:21,400
Kaishido says I want a Mario fencing game. Throwing it back to the kickoff topic tonight.

2097
01:53:21,400 --> 01:53:25,960
Well, if you want a Mario fencing game, I believe wouldn't that be in the 2020 Olympics game?

2098
01:53:25,960 --> 01:53:30,920
True. That true. That, uh, as 200, Matt says, parks are really all about the immersive experience.

2099
01:53:30,920 --> 01:53:35,400
Harry Potter world led the charge and I will give universal credit for that as much as, you know,

2100
01:53:35,400 --> 01:53:40,760
we've stand Disney parks on this show. Universal gets some credit. Like the one stuff that they

2101
01:53:40,760 --> 01:53:45,320
have there. Oh yeah. Universal's got some kick ass stuff, like especially the newer stuff.

2102
01:53:45,320 --> 01:53:50,040
Some of the dated stuff really shows at Sage. I actually, I heard they finally changed the

2103
01:53:50,040 --> 01:53:54,200
Jurassic park ride because now it's Jurassic world. So they went through and completely

2104
01:53:54,200 --> 01:53:58,760
redid that ride. And I think that'd be fun to go see. But anyway, I I'm excited to see universal's

2105
01:53:58,760 --> 01:54:02,840
technology. Cause that, that Harry Potter ride, if you haven't been on that Harry Potter ride,

2106
01:54:02,840 --> 01:54:07,320
it's, it's pretty fucking great. Like it's, it's pretty astounding. I really,

2107
01:54:07,320 --> 01:54:10,680
really liked that ride. And that whole, that whole part of the park is very immersive.

2108
01:54:10,680 --> 01:54:15,320
It's really cool. So I'm excited to see what they do in Nintendo magic. Yeah. All right. Anyway,

2109
01:54:15,320 --> 01:54:19,880
let's move on a dark soccer. You have some rapid fire news too. A couple of quickies. Um,

2110
01:54:19,880 --> 01:54:26,760
cave has finally updated, uh, their shmups. Um, cause they took them off, um, iOS before

2111
01:54:26,760 --> 01:54:33,480
because they were 32 bit and 32 bit went away with iOS 11. So they now have brought them back as 64

2112
01:54:33,480 --> 01:54:40,920
bit. Um, listed among those, as I see Dodonpach maximum, um, I've got death smiles. I'm hoping

2113
01:54:40,920 --> 01:54:45,640
that they include mushihime sama with that. Cause I really enjoyed playing that. So we'll see what

2114
01:54:45,640 --> 01:54:53,000
else comes out and then, um, monster rancher, um, it's going to be on switch of course, but it's

2115
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:59,880
going to play like PS one and look the same. So it is legit. PS one monster rancher, maybe a little

2116
01:54:59,880 --> 01:55:07,320
cleaner, but it's the same thing or monster farm as it was in Japan. And it will be out later this

2117
01:55:07,320 --> 01:55:14,360
year as a Delo title. Uh, in chat, interesting name, obsolete woman in chat says I love cave

2118
01:55:14,360 --> 01:55:22,280
shmups so much. Who doesn't honestly, cave shmups are great. They are hair pulling, you know, and

2119
01:55:22,280 --> 01:55:26,600
not in a good way, more like the, you know, trichotillomania type of way. But it's also

2120
01:55:26,680 --> 01:55:31,560
very nice that with a mobile phone, it's very easy to tilt it vertically. Right. And get your

2121
01:55:31,560 --> 01:55:35,720
vertical shmup the way it's supposed to be done, which more Nintendo switch products need to do.

2122
01:55:35,720 --> 01:55:41,240
I know a couple of them. I remember playing like some of the, this was like way back, like on the

2123
01:55:41,240 --> 01:55:46,440
iPod touch, like way long time ago, they had like some of the cave shmups in there and the controls

2124
01:55:46,440 --> 01:55:49,640
are pretty good because you can just put your finger anywhere on the actual thing and it auto

2125
01:55:49,640 --> 01:55:53,880
fired for you. That's true. Some games work better than other. Yeah. You just, that's all you just

2126
01:55:53,960 --> 01:55:58,040
fire consistently. Like w when do you not fire? You fire consistently and you can,

2127
01:55:58,040 --> 01:56:02,360
you have pretty good precision over like the movement stuff. So it worked out really well.

2128
01:56:03,160 --> 01:56:11,800
That'd be fun. Agreed. Um, that was it. Oh, did you do the monster answer? I did. Oh, I just,

2129
01:56:12,920 --> 01:56:16,520
I'm sorry. Cause I went back and talked about the shmups. Sorry. My bad. It's gonna be weird

2130
01:56:16,520 --> 01:56:20,440
though, how that's going to work though. Cause I can't imagine since this switch doesn't have,

2131
01:56:21,240 --> 01:56:28,440
um, the ability to load discs in, how does it work? Because monster rancher for those who don't

2132
01:56:28,440 --> 01:56:37,080
mean they have an online catalog of virtual CDs that you can choose from. That's not the same.

2133
01:56:37,080 --> 01:56:42,520
It isn't the same, but they got to do something. They should let you hook it up to like Spotify

2134
01:56:42,520 --> 01:56:46,120
or something. Like I know Nintendo doesn't have Spotify, YouTube. Oh my God. Nintendo

2135
01:56:46,120 --> 01:56:50,840
does have YouTube. So imagine if you could hook it up to YouTube and do it that way.

2136
01:56:50,840 --> 01:56:56,200
Or like they should have just, you know, QR codes or something like that. You know, have,

2137
01:56:56,200 --> 01:57:01,240
have random QR codes or the barcode scanners. You may, besides you've got that stupid phone app that

2138
01:57:01,240 --> 01:57:06,680
you don't use for anything. So platoon, you know, it's true. All right. Let's travel around the

2139
01:57:06,680 --> 01:57:10,600
world and check out some games that are coming out a little sooner as we do some world release

2140
01:57:10,600 --> 01:57:17,880
states. Loki. Yes. So we have AI, the Somnium files that's on PC, Nintendo switch and PlayStation

2141
01:57:17,880 --> 01:57:24,920
four Lego, Jurassic world on Nintendo switch real fishing road trip adventure on Nintendo switch and

2142
01:57:24,920 --> 01:57:31,240
PlayStation four, the legend of Zelda links awakening on Nintendo switch, the best game

2143
01:57:31,240 --> 01:57:38,600
of the week, honestly, untitled goose game on Nintendo switch and PC. Um, and then Bobby's

2144
01:57:38,600 --> 01:57:42,520
favorite game, Nino Cooney, wrath of the white witch coming out and into the switch. And if

2145
01:57:42,520 --> 01:57:47,960
that's not enough, Nino Cooney wrath of the white witch remastered on PC and PlayStation four. And

2146
01:57:47,960 --> 01:58:00,120
that's it. Rob is full of cookie. All right. So, uh, girl. Um, so on the 16th, we have bus,

2147
01:58:00,120 --> 01:58:06,520
this is in the UK. We have bus simulator on the 18th. We have modern warfare, beta truck driver,

2148
01:58:07,320 --> 01:58:14,520
on the 19th song, bird symphony AI, the Somnium files, Agalas, which actually was kind of cute.

2149
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:20,680
It looks very, um, I don't know, like a giant blast voice on the screenshot. Um, Lego, Jurassic

2150
01:58:20,680 --> 01:58:28,120
world, Nintendo switch light Nino Cooney wrath of the white witch on a switch and PlayStation, um,

2151
01:58:28,120 --> 01:58:34,200
legend of Zelda links awakening. Um, by the way, thank you, Deke man for getting me cups from

2152
01:58:34,280 --> 01:58:39,240
seven 11 in Canada. Oh shit. He pulled through for you on that. That's awesome. Tempest fucking

2153
01:58:39,240 --> 01:58:47,800
4,000. Is this really finally on PlayStation and X-Box sweet Tetris 99. You know, I've actually

2154
01:58:47,800 --> 01:58:54,120
played, um, tempest 3000. Yeah, I have to mom, but they only had them like as a limited thing.

2155
01:58:54,120 --> 01:58:58,840
And I played the Atari party. Tempest 3000 was actually like a beta thing for a long time. I

2156
01:58:58,840 --> 01:59:02,920
played at Atari party. I did. I did too. And I think that's it for the week after look at the

2157
01:59:02,920 --> 01:59:09,240
calendar. When did already happen? It did. Tempest 4,000 happened on PC. Yeah. Because we're

2158
01:59:09,240 --> 01:59:13,480
getting it at home. Okay. Got it. That's the, I'm like, wait a minute. I swear I played to this 4,000

2159
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:18,440
it's on PC. That's it for the week. Okay, cool. Um, moving on to Japan. Very it's, it's one of

2160
01:59:18,440 --> 01:59:22,440
those weeks where we have very similar releases around the world, which I know, but, but like,

2161
01:59:22,440 --> 01:59:26,040
usually it's kind of different what each country is getting, but not this week because here we go

2162
01:59:26,040 --> 01:59:31,000
again, AI, the Somnium files, uh, is also out in Japan this week. So you have that to look forward

2163
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:36,680
to on the playlist station for card fight. Vanguard EX is also a release in Japan this week

2164
01:59:36,680 --> 01:59:42,680
and, uh, Bobby Black Wolf, not approved Nino Cooney wrath of the white, rich, which remastered

2165
01:59:42,680 --> 01:59:47,800
also coming out on PlayStation four. Um, you know, if they charged less for it, I might

2166
01:59:47,800 --> 01:59:52,040
pick it up again on PS4. I would be down with trying to play that game again. Um,

2167
01:59:52,840 --> 01:59:58,200
and I would live stream it, but I would have to somehow restrict Bobby Black Wolf's comments.

2168
01:59:59,160 --> 02:00:09,000
He's allowed to talk just not every positive reacts only heart emojis only. All right. Anyway,

2169
02:00:09,640 --> 02:00:13,960
I'm just, I'm just giving him a hard time. Uh, let's see. Also, uh, coming out in Japan,

2170
02:00:13,960 --> 02:00:17,400
let's see, as we move to the Nintendo switch, I think we get a lot of the same stuff as well.

2171
02:00:17,400 --> 02:00:24,920
Yeah. Card fight Vanguard EX AI, the Somnium files and, um, Jaku no Lila trap of musk.

2172
02:00:25,800 --> 02:00:32,520
It's a game that comes out as well in Japan on the switch. Oh my, I'm looking at the cover art

2173
02:00:33,080 --> 02:00:37,720
and, uh, I see this woman dressed in what looks like a bridal outfit type of thing.

2174
02:00:37,720 --> 02:00:43,400
And then I see like a dude with his shirt open and she's definitely going for some of that musk

2175
02:00:43,400 --> 02:00:51,000
right now. So, um, I guess, I guess that's that on the Nintendo switch are these two people for

2176
02:00:51,640 --> 02:00:57,240
it? Katie, it looked like vampires. It's vampire stuff. Oh God. It's one of those.

2177
02:00:57,240 --> 02:01:02,120
And there, what is it? This is a porny game. There's like, I'm sorry, I can't put this.

2178
02:01:02,120 --> 02:01:07,480
It's a visual novel. That's is, is this, or is this not a threesome? That is what I'm looking

2179
02:01:07,480 --> 02:01:13,800
at right now. They're just cuddling Peter, Paul and Mary. It doesn't, that could one, two, three,

2180
02:01:13,800 --> 02:01:19,160
is it gross? Me and me. What is it gross? No, they're just all very androgynous on,

2181
02:01:19,160 --> 02:01:23,960
but these two were kissing and the other ones like, you can't see their hand and I have no

2182
02:01:23,960 --> 02:01:30,920
idea the pronouns for any of these people, but who cares? They're vampires. That's right.

2183
02:01:30,920 --> 02:01:35,720
There's definitely some heavy petting in this game. Good Lord. All right. Let them pet

2184
02:01:36,440 --> 02:01:41,160
trap of musk among other things. All right. So there's that. And then of course,

2185
02:01:41,160 --> 02:01:47,400
legend is all the links awakening, but who cares? Trap of musk. All right, let's move on.

2186
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:55,400
I'm waiting for somebody in chat to be like, it's an anime. SSJ100 Matt says near my salad.

2187
02:01:55,400 --> 02:02:00,280
You're so close. You're so close. It's it's really in front of my salad.

2188
02:02:01,880 --> 02:02:08,440
All right. All right. DJ Rama S says you can stream that on anime jam session. We support that.

2189
02:02:08,440 --> 02:02:13,240
What is, he's going crazy. He misses daddy. That's what's going on. He's, he has been,

2190
02:02:14,040 --> 02:02:18,120
Mr. Smoosh has been fed. So while the B roll was going for classic game of the week,

2191
02:02:18,120 --> 02:02:22,600
I was letting him out of kitty jail and feeding him. So, you know, we take care of Mr. Smoosh

2192
02:02:22,600 --> 02:02:26,760
when you can't see me getting up from my chair, but, um, all right. Anyway,

2193
02:02:27,800 --> 02:02:31,880
he's being very needy. Anyway, this is the part of the show where we would go to the mail bag,

2194
02:02:31,880 --> 02:02:36,920
but, um, dark sock. What we do have one. Okay. Dark soccer is coming back so she can read the

2195
02:02:36,920 --> 02:02:43,000
mail. Do you want me to have Loki do a story or okay. I was ready for this shit. All right.

2196
02:02:43,640 --> 02:02:48,680
Did he go right back in kitty jail? No, he let me carry him to kitty jail. Wow. And he,

2197
02:02:48,680 --> 02:02:54,200
I even played with his foot and he started to purr. Oh, good. So apparently he likes the feets.

2198
02:02:54,760 --> 02:02:58,440
He just misses dad because dad would usually be home around eight o'clock.

2199
02:02:58,440 --> 02:03:03,560
So, and he's just not right now. So, all right. Anyway, uh, dark soccer, mailbag,

2200
02:03:03,560 --> 02:03:08,360
a very short email from Robert M. My head Canon for animal crossing is that the characters,

2201
02:03:08,360 --> 02:03:13,320
including yours are living plush toys. Also has anything been said or theorized about

2202
02:03:13,320 --> 02:03:17,240
pocket camp connection? First of all, pocket camp is not going to have a connection.

2203
02:03:17,240 --> 02:03:23,240
They have said so. Oh, bummer. Well, I believe that's what they said. Everything I've indicated

2204
02:03:23,240 --> 02:03:28,280
I've seen indicates that it's not going to have connection. I think I've seen that too.

2205
02:03:29,080 --> 02:03:35,160
And then the other thing, um, I still believe in the hot to full boyfriend theory where, um,

2206
02:03:35,160 --> 02:03:43,640
humans are, uh, are, uh, a dying breed. And actually we got another email from Y Y R

2207
02:03:44,520 --> 02:03:47,560
while I was reading the other mail. Wow. Talk about timing.

2208
02:03:47,560 --> 02:03:51,160
Well, maybe it got went out before then. I just didn't refresh. But anyway,

2209
02:03:51,160 --> 02:03:57,560
um, this doesn't, yeah. Anyway, hello. This email has been sent to acknowledge the dream game

submission is being processed. Please be patient while the process is completed.

2214
02:04:14,520 --> 02:04:21,480
You remember what you said, right? It was vectors. Yeah. Thank you for using the Y Y R games,

2215
02:04:21,480 --> 02:04:27,320
dream game submission service regards Aaron. Y Y R dude. I'll just be happy if it's turds, but plays

2216
02:04:27,320 --> 02:04:35,400
like, um, like, uh, I just said the damn game a moment ago at tempest. He needs to say it like

2217
02:04:35,400 --> 02:04:39,560
the Skype lady. When you call echo one, two, three, thank you for using the dream game

2218
02:04:39,560 --> 02:04:45,160
submission service after the tone. Please leave your game. Thank you for using the Y Y R games,

2219
02:04:45,160 --> 02:04:51,240
dream game submission service. How was that? In case of an emergency landing, there's two exits

2220
02:04:51,240 --> 02:04:57,720
above the lava toy, two exits above the wings. I think my accent was pretty okay. No, your

2221
02:04:57,720 --> 02:05:04,280
accent was good. Yeah. All right. Act F has a theory at animal crossing saying animal crossing

2222
02:05:04,280 --> 02:05:09,320
is probably a kid-friendly version of Dr. Moreau's Island or whatever it's called. The Island of Dr.

2223
02:05:09,320 --> 02:05:14,120
Island of Dr. Moreau, uh, which I think was a classic movie that was pretty well regarded.

2224
02:05:14,120 --> 02:05:18,520
And then they remade it in the nineties. It was like one of Marlon Brando's last movies and

2225
02:05:19,480 --> 02:05:26,200
girl, that movie was a mess. Didn't it go into like, they played off of that theme with like

2226
02:05:26,200 --> 02:05:34,040
the nutty professor. Maybe I can't help but think of the Island of Dr. Brain by Sierra,

2227
02:05:34,040 --> 02:05:40,040
which was superior in every way. Mr. Magoo did some of that too. Does anyone remember Mr. Magoo?

2228
02:05:40,680 --> 02:05:46,360
Oh, Rob don't die. Yes, I remember it. I remember Mr. Magoo and I remember Captain Kangaroo.

2229
02:05:47,160 --> 02:05:53,560
Tired Island of Dr. Moreau wired Island of Dr. Brain. Okay. Just say it.

2230
02:05:55,480 --> 02:06:00,520
I need to find that. Can you, can you play that on some service? Maybe it's in the art on it.

2231
02:06:00,520 --> 02:06:04,680
I think it's on the web archive, isn't it? The Dr. Brain thing. I want to play that on a live

2232
02:06:04,680 --> 02:06:10,280
stream some night. I think that'd be fun. All right. I'm looking it up right now. The Island

2233
02:06:10,280 --> 02:06:15,800
of Dr. Brain. Bobby Black Wolf says I have it on my DOS machine, Dr. Brain. Bobby stream it.

2234
02:06:15,960 --> 02:06:20,600
Only available in DOS. But you can, can you still buy it?

2235
02:06:21,720 --> 02:06:26,520
Not that Moby games has a link to it. I think so. I'm going to look it up later after the show.

2236
02:06:26,520 --> 02:06:31,000
All right. Uh, let's move on though. We got to, uh, we're running a little long, so I can't find

2237
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:34,920
it. Is this, it's as equal to a game though. The castle of Dr. Brain. They had, they had several

2238
02:06:34,920 --> 02:06:42,920
Dr. Brain games. They were all fairly similar. There was yeah. Island castle return. I think

2239
02:06:42,920 --> 02:06:48,440
there was a third game. I'm looking so, um, Oh God, there was a bunch. Uh, there was Dr.

2240
02:06:48,440 --> 02:06:54,840
Brain action reaction in 99, uh, thinking games, IQ adventure, puzzle madness. Then there was the

2241
02:06:54,840 --> 02:06:59,720
time warp of Dr. Brain, lost mind of Dr. Brain, the Island of Dr. Brain and castle of Dr. Brain.

2242
02:06:59,720 --> 02:07:04,280
The time warp of Dr. Brain. The time warp of Captain Brain. To load this game,

2243
02:07:04,280 --> 02:07:09,160
please jump to the left and step to the right. Right. And then bring your knees in tight.

2244
02:07:09,160 --> 02:07:15,560
All right. Moving on Loki, please. Next story before we get too much more derailed.

2245
02:07:15,560 --> 02:07:22,200
All right. So this is unfortunate, but apparently the discord nitro games, those are going away

2246
02:07:22,200 --> 02:07:25,800
because apparently no one was playing them. I completely forgot. They even have that service.

2247
02:07:26,680 --> 02:07:33,080
I didn't forget about the nitro service, but I also remember when we were like, Oh my God,

2248
02:07:33,080 --> 02:07:37,880
discord stealth launched a game store onto everyone's PC. They're fucking brilliant and

2249
02:07:37,880 --> 02:07:40,760
all this stuff. And it was so stealth that everyone forgot it was there.

2250
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:49,320
Apparently we made a miscalculation in all this praise for discord is that oops,

2251
02:07:49,320 --> 02:07:57,960
it was a little bit too stealth and I done forgot. Uh, but yes, apparently, um,

2252
02:07:57,960 --> 02:08:04,600
they said they will be removing all games from nitro. Um, apparently the service will be no

2253
02:08:04,600 --> 02:08:08,440
longer, uh, you will not be able to access the a hundred plus games that were included in the

2254
02:08:08,440 --> 02:08:15,560
service after October 15th. And just, they said they were removing, they're still selling nitro

2255
02:08:15,560 --> 02:08:21,320
cause they still want the, the emojis on every server and your price on your name. And you can

2256
02:08:21,320 --> 02:08:26,760
do the boost cause, um, we want to, and Bobby talked about this a little bit on his show. We

2257
02:08:26,760 --> 02:08:32,040
kind of wanted to boost the VOG network server, but you can't just directly do that. Like we

2258
02:08:32,040 --> 02:08:37,960
can't just throw 20 bucks at them and say, boost the certain, like we have to actually get so many

2259
02:08:37,960 --> 02:08:43,240
people to use their boost on the server. And that's silly. Yeah. That was a little weird.

2260
02:08:43,240 --> 02:08:49,400
So discord, if you're out there, let us give you money the old fashioned way. Rob, for the record,

2261
02:08:50,360 --> 02:08:57,960
I found, uh, the, uh, download for the island of dr brain and you can get, uh, the DAS emulators.

2262
02:08:58,520 --> 02:09:03,320
Nice. Except the legal ease of that. Is that legal? Play in your browser.

2263
02:09:03,880 --> 02:09:08,440
Okay. So that's what I thought. Web archive, I think had it at some point. Okay. I'm on my

2264
02:09:08,440 --> 02:09:14,200
abandonware.com. Well, that's, that is a gray area as we know. And I just have to be careful

2265
02:09:14,200 --> 02:09:19,480
what I stream on Twitch. Uh, but I, if it's still on web archive, then I think that's fair game

2266
02:09:19,480 --> 02:09:26,520
because then you're just, I'm playing games at a library. All right. Anyhow, uh, let's move on.

2267
02:09:26,680 --> 02:09:32,120
Actually quickly, um, uh, chat comments here. Tiger claw says discord nitro doesn't seem worth

2268
02:09:32,120 --> 02:09:36,760
it because one of the features is being able to post animated emojis and stuff. Uh, Bobby says

2269
02:09:36,760 --> 02:09:41,720
the feature we want for our server is the update up bit rate in the chat channels. Yes, that is true

2270
02:09:41,720 --> 02:09:47,320
to make the voice quality even better and more pristine on these programs. Or, uh, for instance,

2271
02:09:47,320 --> 02:09:53,320
when extra fur and I are doing a show and using discord to do it, he'll sound even better, um,

2272
02:09:53,400 --> 02:09:58,040
with if we were to have it up server, but that is a, uh, that is a conversation for another day.

2273
02:09:58,040 --> 02:10:01,720
Yeah. Bobby says we want to pay for that as a company and not make you guys subscribe to

2274
02:10:01,720 --> 02:10:06,360
discord to get it. Exactly. You guys are already paying with your subs and your biddies. We could

2275
02:10:06,360 --> 02:10:11,720
just take some of that money and give it to discord, but they won't let us. So, all right.

2276
02:10:12,600 --> 02:10:17,000
Anyhow. I mean, I guess we could subscribe as individuals, but you need what you need,

2277
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:21,880
like two people to boost it, to get to the first level, but then you need like 20 to get to the

2278
02:10:21,880 --> 02:10:26,920
next. I don't know. It's a little weird. Anyway, let's move on though. Um, let's talk about,

2279
02:10:26,920 --> 02:10:32,520
Ooh, let's talk about civilization six. You know, I will take any excuse to talk about civilization

2280
02:10:32,520 --> 02:10:38,600
on this show, but I'm really curious for, um, Bobby's opinion on this because Bobby and I at

2281
02:10:38,600 --> 02:10:45,400
dragon con did a battle royale one Oh one panel. And, uh, we were talking about what games would

2282
02:10:45,400 --> 02:10:50,120
you like to see go the battle royale route. And we had a lot of games come up, but you know what

2283
02:10:50,120 --> 02:10:57,480
game I don't think ever came up civilization, but guess what? For fire access, who of course

2284
02:10:57,480 --> 02:11:01,720
is the company behind all the Civ games and two K who publishes them, uh, is taking their own

2285
02:11:01,720 --> 02:11:07,400
approach on a battle royale mode, uh, for civilization six it's called red death. It's a

2286
02:11:07,400 --> 02:11:13,800
12 player competitive game. So it's not 99. It's 12. I guess that's as many as Civ can handle. Uh,

2287
02:11:13,800 --> 02:11:17,880
and it puts the battle royale on the strategy game, but what you're doing, you're not really,

2288
02:11:17,880 --> 02:11:23,560
okay. So, you know, Civ is one type of game, but in this you're in a post apocalyptic world.

2289
02:11:23,560 --> 02:11:29,880
And so it's like all military driven. So you're doing the military and strategic side of

2290
02:11:29,880 --> 02:11:35,720
civilization. You're not doing the whole like science trees and development trees and all the

2291
02:11:35,720 --> 02:11:41,400
other stuff, the other types of micromanaging in the game. It's not so much for X it's just X

2292
02:11:41,400 --> 02:11:45,320
it's more the military side of things. That's probably the best way I can explain it.

2293
02:11:45,320 --> 02:11:50,360
So you don't play the usual leaders. You play, um, a post apocalyptic type of thing,

2294
02:11:50,360 --> 02:11:55,800
and you're trying to get off the planet by wiping everyone else out. Clearly it's the only way

2295
02:11:55,800 --> 02:12:00,440
everyone in the game starts with one civilian, one infantry unit and one machine gun unit.

2296
02:12:00,440 --> 02:12:05,640
And you grow your faction to crush the other factions. There's no wonders of the world.

2297
02:12:05,640 --> 02:12:10,360
And this is interesting too. There is a storm that shrinks the safe space,

2298
02:12:10,360 --> 02:12:14,680
just like you would see now that part I'm like, okay, that definitely seems more like traditional

2299
02:12:14,680 --> 02:12:18,680
battle royale. Because otherwise, when I read about this, I'm like, this just sounds like a

2300
02:12:18,680 --> 02:12:23,800
fancy mod that isn't really battle royale. It's just a military only model. Oh, okay.

2301
02:12:23,800 --> 02:12:28,520
They're taking cues with the shrinking eye of the storm and things like that. Okay. All right. It

2302
02:12:28,520 --> 02:12:33,480
pushes people more towards the center. I got that. Here's the other part, as much as you might want

2303
02:12:33,480 --> 02:12:37,000
to say that doesn't really feel battle royale. Well, here's, here's something that might really

2304
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:43,880
lessen the complaints. It's free as long as you own civ six. So, Hey, I'm all for enhancements

2305
02:12:43,880 --> 02:12:49,480
and new things. So, it is a new free mode for anybody that already owns the core civ six.

2306
02:12:49,480 --> 02:12:53,080
So, that's pretty cool. Because I have to admit, I bought civ six. I played it a little bit. And

2307
02:12:53,080 --> 02:12:57,480
then I got distracted with other games as tends to happen. So, I need a reason to go back and

2308
02:12:57,480 --> 02:13:04,760
visit civilization six. That's for sure. So, anyhow. So, I don't see any comments from Bobby

2309
02:13:04,760 --> 02:13:08,120
Blackwell on this. I was wondering if he was going to say something on this. But I do see some

2310
02:13:08,120 --> 02:13:13,080
comments from other people. Kaijuto says, as much as I love battle royale, this civ game sounds

2311
02:13:13,080 --> 02:13:18,600
awful. Well, I think you kind of have to be into civ to get it. But like, if you don't really play

2312
02:13:18,600 --> 02:13:26,360
civ, it doesn't sound action packed because civ is not. Act F says, imagine a 99 player battle

2313
02:13:26,360 --> 02:13:34,280
royale game of civ. It would take years to finish. Maybe, but I would bet in a 99 player, I actually

2314
02:13:34,280 --> 02:13:39,640
would be down for a 99 player version of the traditional civilization game because civilizations

2315
02:13:39,640 --> 02:13:43,720
are going to get squashed fast. I think you would have to take out the barbarians to make it work

2316
02:13:43,720 --> 02:13:48,360
and have a really big planet. But I think there could be something there. But then if you're in

2317
02:13:48,360 --> 02:13:53,720
one of the top 10 civs, you're going to be playing for a long time. So, as Jonah and Matt says, I'm all

2318
02:13:53,720 --> 02:13:58,760
for this. And here's the comment from Bobby saying, I need to see more of it. Well, there is a trailer

2319
02:13:58,760 --> 02:14:03,480
out there. They did put out a trailer on YouTube. So, you can see a little bit more of it out there.

2320
02:14:03,480 --> 02:14:07,160
Sorry, I didn't rip it in time for tonight's show. But I know a lot of you are tech savvy

2321
02:14:07,160 --> 02:14:10,840
and probably already opening up YouTube in another window to take a look. So, there you go.

2322
02:14:10,840 --> 02:14:15,640
All right, let's move on. A few more stories before we get to some phone calls and stuff via

2323
02:14:15,640 --> 02:14:22,040
Discord. So, let's go to Dar Sakura. You've been kind of hinting at this one too all night.

2324
02:14:22,040 --> 02:14:27,800
Yeah, I have it on my wishlist on Steam. It's coming out in a few days from what I understand.

2325
02:14:27,800 --> 02:14:34,600
Sorry, on September 24th. A game designed by PsyOp and it is called I Love You, Colonel Sanders,

2326
02:14:34,600 --> 02:14:42,840
a finger looking good data simulator. Yeah, it is KFC dating sim where you date a young hot Colonel

2327
02:14:42,840 --> 02:14:50,200
and he looks just like. Oh, you remember when those like versions were coming out like fan art

2328
02:14:50,200 --> 02:14:56,120
versions of different mascots were out like there's the cute Wendy's, the snarky cute Wendy's

2329
02:14:56,120 --> 02:15:00,360
and the Burger King looking a little kind of younger and they had the hot Colonel Sanders.

2330
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:06,680
Well, hot Colonel Sanders is in the game. I liked Reba as Colonel Sanders for the record.

2331
02:15:07,560 --> 02:15:10,840
Reba, they had a commercial with Reba McEntire playing the Colonel. When?

2332
02:15:11,720 --> 02:15:14,760
Only about a year ago. It wasn't that long ago. It was a recent memory. Guess who doesn't watch TV?

2333
02:15:15,720 --> 02:15:20,200
But it was on Twitter. I'm a big Twitter, like of course. I have all that blocked.

2334
02:15:20,200 --> 02:15:25,160
Just saying. And we have YouTube Red at home. I have a block too, but when I go outside,

2335
02:15:25,160 --> 02:15:29,240
I have this mobile device that lets me see things. Yeah, but I also have ad block on my iPhone.

2336
02:15:30,680 --> 02:15:34,600
Seriously? For everything. I actually don't use the Twitter app. I use echo phone. Oh,

2337
02:15:34,600 --> 02:15:39,240
it's ad blood. This was something people were posting because it's, it's fucking Reba McEntire.

2338
02:15:39,240 --> 02:15:43,240
She's allowed to go around. The moment that I see an ad about something, I just ignore it.

2339
02:15:43,240 --> 02:15:49,560
Even if it's Reba? Even if it's Reba, because I'm not going to let my memory of her think of her as

2340
02:15:49,560 --> 02:15:56,040
a sellout. Reba can do whatever she wants. And then I have to go listen to Fancy. Dark soccer

2341
02:15:56,040 --> 02:15:59,480
is there. Here's your one chance, ad block. Don't let me down. Peter Parker says, yes,

2342
02:15:59,480 --> 02:16:05,560
it's coming out on the day of KFC's founding. Well, a little bit more about this is that

2343
02:16:07,240 --> 02:16:13,800
he is going to be a culinary student with you, that he's gone back to culinary school to become

2344
02:16:13,800 --> 02:16:20,680
the world's greatest fried chicken salesman. And so that becomes one of your challenges to help

2345
02:16:20,680 --> 02:16:28,440
him with that as well as you learn recipes and you have different, you know, other tasks to do

2346
02:16:28,440 --> 02:16:34,440
in the game. But you know, this isn't the first time that KFC delved into romance, right? You

2347
02:16:34,440 --> 02:16:40,760
know? Well, I can't say I've been following the Colonel's love life closely, but- In Mother's Day

2348
02:16:40,760 --> 02:16:49,160
2017, KFC did a romance novel called The Tender Wings of Desire with a hotness version of the

2349
02:16:49,160 --> 02:16:55,720
Colonel. Okay. I'm going to say it. I'm sorry. I can't. I'm going to say it. Can the Colonel be gay?

2350
02:16:55,720 --> 02:17:06,520
Boy, play as girl. No, I'm kidding. No, I don't see why not. I mean- No, in this game.

2351
02:17:06,520 --> 02:17:09,480
Yeah. I don't know. It doesn't say anything about it, but for people who don't know where

2352
02:17:09,480 --> 02:17:15,560
that reference came from, what was that game we played at E3 that was like the dating fucking

2353
02:17:15,560 --> 02:17:23,640
game? And we're like, can you play guys? Boy, play as girl. That's what the guy literally said.

2354
02:17:24,200 --> 02:17:29,800
No, I'm laughing my ass off because this actually fucking happened. It was Feel 3 or something like

2355
02:17:29,800 --> 02:17:34,120
that was the name of it. Yeah. And we were doing the demo at Dark Soccer literally as like, you

2356
02:17:34,120 --> 02:17:40,840
know, the way you phrase it. Like, can two men play? Can two men play? And that was, boy, play

2357
02:17:40,840 --> 02:17:49,960
as girl. Literally the response. And he turned red. This was also years ago. This was like the

2358
02:17:50,440 --> 02:17:56,120
three feel, I think. Three feel, that's it. This was like 2005, I'm sure the game was.

2359
02:17:56,120 --> 02:18:01,320
This was Kensha Hall, wasn't it? It was Kensha Hall. So that'll date our experience. It was a

2360
02:18:01,320 --> 02:18:07,240
long time ago. Society has progressed a long way since the days of three feel. For the record,

2361
02:18:07,240 --> 02:18:16,280
I think the game did come out because I found references to it. Yeah, there were some links

2362
02:18:16,360 --> 02:18:19,720
about it out there, but yeah, I think that it still exists.

2363
02:18:22,440 --> 02:18:28,600
Pixel Pacas in chat says, I actually had that question, Rob. Thank God some of you

2364
02:18:28,600 --> 02:18:34,360
are doing the investigative journalism when we are unable. In the game, they do not specify

2365
02:18:34,360 --> 02:18:41,720
who the protag is or if you can select a gender. So basically the protagonist is whoever you want

2366
02:18:41,720 --> 02:18:48,760
them to be. I like that. I like that. Leave it up to your imagination. And Tiger Claw in chat says,

2367
02:18:49,400 --> 02:18:53,560
so basically you're saying this game is finger lickin' good.

2368
02:18:56,440 --> 02:19:00,120
Apparently you can still get three feel. Hold on, everyone. I just want everyone to note

2369
02:19:00,120 --> 02:19:08,440
episode 792, September 15th, 2019 at approximately 8 29 PM on the West Coast. Tiger Claw said

2370
02:19:08,440 --> 02:19:16,120
something really, really fucking funny. A winner is you.

2371
02:19:19,720 --> 02:19:27,800
All right. And for the record, your is spelled Y O U apostrophe R E. I'm just saying.

2372
02:19:27,800 --> 02:19:31,560
Right. Anything else we need to say about the KFC dating sim?

2373
02:19:31,560 --> 02:19:33,640
Fuck no, but I'm going to stream the shit out of it.

2374
02:19:33,640 --> 02:19:38,600
You should. You should. And don't forget in December, I'm going to be doing a holiday

2375
02:19:38,600 --> 02:19:42,680
star for hot to full boyfriend. I'll be waiting with bated breath. All right. Moving on,

2376
02:19:42,680 --> 02:19:52,520
Loki. I'll buy myself a pizza if I do it. All right. So this is kind of, I guess,

2377
02:19:52,520 --> 02:20:00,200
unfortunate, but you may remember that Billy Mitchell of Donkey Kong high score fame had his

2378
02:20:00,200 --> 02:20:04,920
and hot sauce and hot sauce. Well, pretty much only hot sauce anymore because his

2379
02:20:04,920 --> 02:20:12,440
scores fake hair. I'm just saying his scores were invalidated a while ago.

2380
02:20:13,320 --> 02:20:19,960
So basically his scores were invalidated and, you know, his record was taken out of the Guinness

2381
02:20:19,960 --> 02:20:26,760
Book of World Records. And now, of course, because of that, he is threatening legal

2382
02:20:26,760 --> 02:20:32,600
recourse against Guinness World Records and Twin Galaxies if they don't, uh, retract their

2383
02:20:32,600 --> 02:20:39,560
defamatory statements against him and reinstate his high score world records within the next two

2384
02:20:39,560 --> 02:20:48,280
weeks. You know who I haven't heard about in the news the past couple months? Who? Billy

2385
02:20:48,280 --> 02:20:53,720
Mitchell. You know who I'm hearing about in the news all of a sudden? Billy Mitchell. Wow. Fancy

2386
02:20:53,720 --> 02:21:00,200
that. Funny how that works. Isn't that crazy? Yeah. Isn't life funny? Isn't fame something else?

2387
02:21:00,840 --> 02:21:06,520
It is funny. And, um, I just don't think they have a strong case to be honest. I mean,

2388
02:21:07,160 --> 02:21:12,760
based on some of the stuff I've seen where they're showing you the video footage or whatever from his

2389
02:21:12,760 --> 02:21:18,760
games, apparently versus what's out there and how they can't recreate this the way the screen is,

2390
02:21:18,760 --> 02:21:26,680
um, kind of drawing in. It's just, I don't know, like it's ridiculous. It's not surprising though.

2391
02:21:27,320 --> 02:21:30,600
If this goes to trial, does Bobby Black Wolf get called as a witness?

2392
02:21:32,040 --> 02:21:35,880
That's all. And is there going to be a Bobby Black Wolf subpoena that happens? That's what

2393
02:21:35,880 --> 02:21:38,440
I want to know. Is that, is that going to be a thing that happens? Will this be covered

2394
02:21:38,440 --> 02:21:43,800
by Variety? And could they quote him again in Variety? Tiger call says he's been streaming

2395
02:21:43,800 --> 02:21:47,480
on Twitch. Oh yeah. I heard Billy Mitchell got into Twitch streaming not that long ago.

2396
02:21:48,440 --> 02:21:53,800
So streaming maim. I get, I don't know. How many viewers does he get on the regular? Not that

2397
02:21:53,800 --> 02:21:59,960
that's important, but I'm just curious. Like how many people are watching him do his Donkey Kong

2398
02:21:59,960 --> 02:22:04,280
speed runs or whatever he's working on next? He gets a few hundreds as Bobby Black Wolf.

2399
02:22:04,280 --> 02:22:12,280
Interesting. Well, good for him, but I just, I'm curious to see where this goes. I don't think that

2400
02:22:12,280 --> 02:22:16,040
they're going to, well, obviously they're not going to reinstate his records. I can't wait

2401
02:22:16,040 --> 02:22:19,960
for there to be a settlement. So this can be in the news all over again in a few more months.

2402
02:22:19,960 --> 02:22:24,120
And we can talk about Billy Mitchell again. I don't think there's anything needs to be settled.

2403
02:22:24,120 --> 02:22:33,640
I don't think he has any evidence. So let him Sue. Uh, Bobby Black Wolf says he does the full

2404
02:22:33,640 --> 02:22:37,400
TG thing, twin galaxy things where he shows the motherboard. Like they require,

2405
02:22:37,400 --> 02:22:41,480
he follows all the rules. I think his thing is that they invalidated his Pac-Man record

2406
02:22:41,480 --> 02:22:48,200
that was done in 1982 and Mame wasn't invented until 1997. So it wasn't so much about the Donkey

2407
02:22:48,200 --> 02:22:53,960
Kong record as it was, Hey, when you threw that out, you threw out all this other stuff. When

2408
02:22:53,960 --> 02:23:01,480
I set this record before there was an emulator, basically. So, I mean, I get that, but,

2409
02:23:02,760 --> 02:23:08,760
but at the same time, uh, when Lance Armstrong got caught doping or whatever it was,

2410
02:23:08,760 --> 02:23:11,640
they didn't just take the metal in the year that he was doping. They took them all.

2411
02:23:12,280 --> 02:23:16,440
Yeah. So that is, that is the thing that happens in sports sometimes. So there's kind of two sides

2412
02:23:16,440 --> 02:23:21,880
of it, right? Yeah. So anyway. All right. Well, let's move on and I got one more story for you

2413
02:23:21,880 --> 02:23:27,720
guys. And this one's kind of an odd thing. And I think, I think, uh, you know, a lot of you guys,

2414
02:23:27,720 --> 02:23:31,800
uh, probably heard about this this week and it's kind of a sweet thing, but, uh, it has to do with

2415
02:23:31,800 --> 02:23:36,840
Masha hero, Sakurai, who of course is the great mind behind, uh, super smash brothers and the

2416
02:23:36,840 --> 02:23:41,320
ultimate super smash brothers that was recently released on the switch. Um, and of course there's

2417
02:23:41,320 --> 02:23:46,440
this great meme around the internet, uh, where there's a picture of Sakurai during one of the

2418
02:23:46,440 --> 02:23:51,720
Nintendo directs, but someone has captioned it. Don't ask me for anything ever again. And that

2419
02:23:51,720 --> 02:23:55,960
picture never fails to crack me up whenever there's a smash brothers announcement like

2420
02:23:55,960 --> 02:24:01,240
Terry Bogart or, uh, uh, five more DLC characters coming than somebody replies to that picture.

2421
02:24:01,240 --> 02:24:05,160
Don't ask me for anything ever again, but there's actually kind of like an

2422
02:24:05,240 --> 02:24:11,880
ah moment about this because, uh, Sakurai took home some awards at the Japan game awards 2019.

2423
02:24:11,880 --> 02:24:16,760
And he actually gave a speech and the translated version of the speech goes like this.

2424
02:24:17,480 --> 02:24:22,760
I'm sorry for bringing up this personal story at a time like this, but making smash brothers

2425
02:24:22,760 --> 02:24:28,680
on the switch was the last mission the late Satoru Iwata gave to me. I've put my all into the

2426
02:24:28,680 --> 02:24:34,280
game and with more DLC, I will continue to work hard. So that is really sweet. It's one of those

2427
02:24:34,280 --> 02:24:39,400
things where it's like, don't ask me for anything ever again, unless you're Satoru Iwata, right?

2428
02:24:39,400 --> 02:24:44,840
Then you get whatever you want. And I think that is a very, very, uh, very cool little note to end

2429
02:24:44,840 --> 02:24:49,960
on. And obviously everybody loves this new smash brothers game. It's doing very well and still don't

2430
02:24:49,960 --> 02:24:55,400
have it yet. Still, I'm kind of surprised. It's never going to go on sale. So I don't know which

2431
02:24:55,400 --> 02:25:00,600
I, well, I still remember to send my switch controller in to get fixed because the first

2432
02:25:00,600 --> 02:25:05,960
thing I did wrong was I put that the wrong switch controller is broken. So I still have to send that

2433
02:25:05,960 --> 02:25:10,120
in cause it's slightly broken, but not as bad as the other one. And then I had to eventually send

2434
02:25:10,120 --> 02:25:16,840
the other one in, but I just haven't, I remember to do that. Yep. Which by the way, GameStop dude,

2435
02:25:16,840 --> 02:25:22,280
your fucking controller is so goddamn broken that like, it's just the camera is just straight down

2436
02:25:22,280 --> 02:25:29,320
in like, you know, Breath of the Wild. Just fucking take advantage of that Nintendo service

2437
02:25:29,320 --> 02:25:35,400
to fix that shit or put a new fucking controller on your damn demo kiosk. Like shit. I'm going to

2438
02:25:35,400 --> 02:25:39,240
move on to open up our discord, uh, for anybody that wants to call in. And if you want to be on

2439
02:25:39,240 --> 02:25:43,240
the show tonight, just head on over to our discord and he can join the green room and we'll be taking

2440
02:25:43,240 --> 02:25:47,160
calls there, uh, here shortly. Um, but I do want to read some of these comments from chat while

2441
02:25:47,160 --> 02:25:52,200
we wait for folks to join, uh, cause it's a very kind words there for Sakurai. Um, actdeft in chat

2442
02:25:52,200 --> 02:25:59,000
says Sakurai is wholesome and we don't deserve him. SSG100 Matt says, let Sakurai sleep. Uh,

2443
02:25:59,480 --> 02:26:04,280
actdeft says Iwata was a mentor to Sakurai, almost a father figure. You know, you have to remember

2444
02:26:04,280 --> 02:26:09,560
Satoru Iwata kind of worked his way up too. I mean, he balloon fight. Hello. That was him.

2445
02:26:09,560 --> 02:26:14,920
And he worked on other games as well. And then DarkSakuraOLR in chat says Sakurai also has good

2446
02:26:14,920 --> 02:26:20,920
hair. True. He does. He does. He doesn't really just really good hair. He does. Yeah. Yeah. I

2447
02:26:20,920 --> 02:26:26,920
wish I had Sakurai's hair, but I don't genetics. They're a bitch. What? Very fashionable. True.

2448
02:26:26,920 --> 02:26:31,000
But you know what? I really like hats. Do you like my hat today? By the way, I don't know if

2449
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:34,600
it's, I don't know if it's coming through on Twitch very well, but it's a, it's a rainbow

2450
02:26:34,600 --> 02:26:41,080
Pikachu hat. Uh, and I thought it was appropriate for community day today. Um, I'm almost embarrassed

2451
02:26:41,080 --> 02:26:47,320
to say I got it at Spencer gifts, believe it or not. They were having a deal on hats. It was like,

2452
02:26:47,320 --> 02:26:52,280
buy one, get one free. So I bought this hat and I bought one. I haven't worn on stream yet. Should

2453
02:26:52,280 --> 02:27:00,200
I say what it is? Do it. It's a Waluigi hat. So I'll wear that on a future stream. I do changing

2454
02:27:00,200 --> 02:27:05,480
the colors of it, but I have hair because I get bored. Yeah. I picked up a wild stallion shirt

2455
02:27:05,480 --> 02:27:12,520
this week. Wild stallions. I haven't gotten it yet. You knew this shirt. This is the same one

2456
02:27:12,520 --> 02:27:17,640
that Keanu Reeves had on this Sonic shirt that I'm wearing. You know where I got this shirt at a

2457
02:27:17,640 --> 02:27:24,440
store target. I believe it. Yeah, I know. It's like crazy. So yeah, you can get some, because

2458
02:27:24,440 --> 02:27:28,920
there's there, they're clearing out the pride stuff. I almost got one of those sequence shirts.

2459
02:27:28,920 --> 02:27:32,440
Oh really? I want to get two of them and make it into a dress. I was going to say,

2460
02:27:32,440 --> 02:27:35,880
I'm surprised you're not buying some of those things just to like get crafty and make your

2461
02:27:35,880 --> 02:27:39,640
own thing. I'm kind of thinking of it, but I'm not that good at the seamstress yet. So I don't know

2462
02:27:39,640 --> 02:27:46,360
how to sew around the sequence. Gotcha. It's a bummer that my good pal Aria snark lives so far

2463
02:27:46,360 --> 02:27:51,000
away. Cause that's the seamstress. I have friends that are costumers. That's good. One of my,

2464
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:55,640
one of the other sisters is actually doing a quilt raffle. We're actually gonna be raffling

2465
02:27:55,640 --> 02:28:01,480
out another quilt going on this labeled any way you turn it. Love is love is love is love is love.

2466
02:28:01,480 --> 02:28:07,880
I love that. And it's all hearts, heart patches that were donated. I have a completely random

2467
02:28:07,880 --> 02:28:10,440
question. I swear we'll get to the phone calls and we'll go back to video games. This is just

2468
02:28:10,440 --> 02:28:13,480
something I was stewing on. And maybe since you're involved with sisters, you might know the answer

2469
02:28:13,480 --> 02:28:19,240
to this. So, you know, we, we talk about like acronyms in LGBT, right? You know, there's LGBT,

2470
02:28:19,240 --> 02:28:24,840
there's LGBTQ plus. Some people call it queer, but not everybody's cool with that. Cause there's

2471
02:28:24,840 --> 02:28:29,400
a negative connotation of that word. Some people do the G first. Right. Yeah. Well, yeah, I've

2472
02:28:29,400 --> 02:28:35,960
seen GLBT. Sure. Um, but here's my question. Why did the acronym quilt bag never catch on?

2473
02:28:35,960 --> 02:28:39,960
Because it's all the same letters. You're the only person I've ever heard say it. Really? Yeah.

2474
02:28:39,960 --> 02:28:44,840
I swear I've heard it somewhere else too. And I always love that because I love that

2475
02:28:44,840 --> 02:28:49,800
image of a quilt that it's like all these different. I don't know. I will switch

2476
02:28:49,800 --> 02:28:55,560
personally between using queer and LGBTQ a plus. I understand some people are really hesitant to

2477
02:28:55,560 --> 02:29:01,480
use queer though, because, you know, I, and when I was in grade school, kids would play that game

2478
02:29:01,480 --> 02:29:06,040
called smear the queer. Right. And so it has a lot of negative. And I think some people are still

2479
02:29:06,040 --> 02:29:10,840
trying to kind of like figure that word out a little bit. Like it's still very negative for

2480
02:29:10,840 --> 02:29:16,200
some people. My whole thing is that the words have the power that we give them. I mean,

2481
02:29:16,200 --> 02:29:24,680
what bugs me is that there are words used for women and women's parts that are used very

2482
02:29:24,680 --> 02:29:30,600
negatively. I am very much against the word fish used in the drag community because the origin of

2483
02:29:30,600 --> 02:29:34,920
fish comes from an insult for the way that a woman's privates can smell if it's not washed.

2484
02:29:35,720 --> 02:29:40,920
And to say something is fish is to use an insulting term toward women. I will not use it.

2485
02:29:40,920 --> 02:29:46,920
I will not allow it to be used around me. That being said, there are women who are reclaiming

2486
02:29:46,920 --> 02:29:56,440
the term to use for, for strength. I think that taking a word that has such trauma and stigma

2487
02:29:56,440 --> 02:30:02,840
attached to it and turning it around to be something positive and good, because I mean,

2488
02:30:03,560 --> 02:30:09,880
queer in its dictionary definition is just different outside the usual.

2489
02:30:10,760 --> 02:30:16,440
If we take that and make it mean something that is normal, that's reclaiming the use of the word.

2490
02:30:16,440 --> 02:30:20,280
And I have no problem with it, especially for people like me who are pretty much unicorns.

2491
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:26,440
You know, I am an asexual woman. Bisexual people are getting a lot more accepted that are still

2492
02:30:26,440 --> 02:30:31,240
kind of on that unicorn spectrum of erasure. Bisexual people also have to deal with the whole

2493
02:30:31,240 --> 02:30:36,360
like, you know, oh, you're just loose, you know, like, and then all that kind of garbage,

2494
02:30:36,360 --> 02:30:42,520
you know, or like, you know, we have a mutual friend who was in a relationship with a woman

2495
02:30:42,520 --> 02:30:48,120
and then married a man that doesn't suddenly make her less bi. Right. Right. Yeah. You know,

2496
02:30:49,080 --> 02:30:53,800
or intersex people get left out a lot. The non gender conforming get left out a lot.

2497
02:30:54,360 --> 02:31:00,600
You know, I think that having a blanket term, we're all outside of what society deems to be

2498
02:31:00,600 --> 02:31:07,800
normal. We are the unicorns. We should be helping each other instead of trying to gatekeep on who's

2499
02:31:07,800 --> 02:31:12,280
more queer than someone else. Oh, I like that. We're all the unicorns. You're all that on a

2500
02:31:12,280 --> 02:31:18,120
shirt. Although I still feel a little bit more mythical. Yeah. We're all the unicorns, but not

2501
02:31:18,680 --> 02:31:22,920
in the never ending story because that I can't handle it. Anyway, that there wasn't a unicorn

2502
02:31:22,920 --> 02:31:26,840
in the never ending story. Oh no, it was just a horse. Wasn't it? Our text was a horse. Or am

2503
02:31:26,840 --> 02:31:33,800
I thinking of- Did you see that cosplay? I saw that at Dragon Con. Yes, I did. That was

2504
02:31:33,800 --> 02:31:38,280
something else. That was some genius there. Yeah, it is. No, the sad unicorns are the ones in

2505
02:31:38,280 --> 02:31:42,840
legend that got killed. That, okay. I crossed my eighties movies. Okay. Yeah. Cause that's the

2506
02:31:42,840 --> 02:31:45,960
scene you still won't watch. I remember you talked about that. And Pixel Pacas, I'll tell you this.

2507
02:31:46,520 --> 02:31:50,600
Pixel Pacas says, I feel like the term is being reclaimed, being reclaimed is totally fine.

2508
02:31:50,600 --> 02:31:55,800
I, but I don't feel comfortable using it for myself. That's fine. Oh yeah. I know. Like,

2509
02:31:55,800 --> 02:32:02,120
well, when it comes to the word fancy ass guy, take that as an acronym. Some

2510
02:32:03,240 --> 02:32:06,600
guys like to use that as a term of empowerment. I'm a little,

2511
02:32:08,440 --> 02:32:14,120
I don't know. I don't know how I feel about it. It was funny enough. And this happened at Dragon

2512
02:32:14,120 --> 02:32:18,920
Con. A queen actually came up to me and said, you are a fish as fuck. And I'm like, that's because

2513
02:32:18,920 --> 02:32:27,320
I have a real vagina. And she's like, oh, I thought you were kind of short. You know what

2514
02:32:27,320 --> 02:32:31,080
though here? Okay. This is like totally tangent train. I'm sorry, but you know, we're getting

2515
02:32:31,080 --> 02:32:34,760
towards the end of the show. Deal with it. I feel like you and I need a show where like,

2516
02:32:34,760 --> 02:32:38,040
throughout the week when serious questions we have come up, like the one I just thought it,

2517
02:32:38,040 --> 02:32:41,320
we just need to write it down, put it in a jar. And like each episode we just take something out

2518
02:32:41,320 --> 02:32:46,280
of the jar and like have a serious fucking like discussion about doing because it's us. I know,

2519
02:32:46,280 --> 02:32:49,960
but like, I feel like there's a little, like there's a little more purpose here.

2520
02:32:49,960 --> 02:32:53,640
That was very like, what? It doesn't have a purpose. That's the, you know,

2521
02:32:53,640 --> 02:33:01,800
but like, I feel like Robin, Jamie, explain it all or try, try Robin, Jamie, try, insert, try

2522
02:33:02,360 --> 02:33:05,400
to explain to them. Oh my God. That would be great. And then the, the logo could just be

2523
02:33:05,400 --> 02:33:12,680
that star when in comic sans Robin, Jamie tried. Yeah. I like that. We might have to do that.

2524
02:33:13,560 --> 02:33:17,800
Yeah. That's it. Robin, Jamie tried. Okay. This is happening. Y'all eventually.

2525
02:33:18,360 --> 02:33:21,800
You like that. You want to guest on this show? Loki, Robin, Jamie tried.

2526
02:33:21,800 --> 02:33:26,680
Sure. Why not? Well, I am planning on doing a sister podcast that is coming around,

2527
02:33:26,680 --> 02:33:30,920
but I think it would be great. I mean, cause I want to do things to talk about the special

2528
02:33:30,920 --> 02:33:36,120
needs that sisters have. Cause I mean, we support so much in our fucking communities,

2529
02:33:36,120 --> 02:33:41,320
but what supports us, right? And there's lots of, there's some fight and there's some drama.

2530
02:33:41,400 --> 02:33:48,200
You cannot have people in a queer community that ain't got some drama. Just saying. So I'm trying

2531
02:33:48,200 --> 02:33:52,120
to do something for that, but I would absolutely love to have them read, just sit and talk this

2532
02:33:52,120 --> 02:33:57,000
shit about the stuff that's going on. Okay. We're going to plan it. Do you want, would you be willing

2533
02:33:57,000 --> 02:34:01,880
to do it a video show so we can like premiere it on VOG? Do like a geek? I guess. All right.

2534
02:34:03,240 --> 02:34:08,920
Okay. All right. I want to make Bobby perk up. I'm making content. We'll do this show while I'm

2535
02:34:08,920 --> 02:34:15,240
doing my makeup. Yeah, sure. Why not? Why not? You can, you can do your makeup. I guess we have

2536
02:34:15,240 --> 02:34:18,840
to be doing something different every show. What would I be doing? I'll learn needle point. You'll

2537
02:34:18,840 --> 02:34:22,760
learn needle point. All right. I'll teach you how to crochet. Oh, I'll do Perler beads. I can do

2538
02:34:22,760 --> 02:34:26,760
those. I have a bunch of Perler beads I hadn't used in a while. Yeah, we'll do Perler. That

2539
02:34:26,760 --> 02:34:30,440
would be great because then we could like, I could give away the Perler beads. So it's arts

2540
02:34:30,440 --> 02:34:36,040
and crafts and chat. I love that. And we tried. I'm going to fuck up. Sometimes you're going to

2541
02:34:36,040 --> 02:34:41,400
fuck up. I actually want to learn needle point. Cause I went, I have a linen apron and I just

2542
02:34:41,400 --> 02:34:47,080
wanted to say kitchen bitch and then have the B slashed out and do a W over it. That's funny.

2543
02:34:47,080 --> 02:34:50,200
You talk about that. Cause I've been on a good place binge this past week. I've never watched

2544
02:34:50,200 --> 02:34:56,680
that show. So I want a shirt that says dress bitch so bad. Or, um, what was, Oh God, what was

2545
02:34:56,680 --> 02:35:04,840
the one help somebody it's season three when Chidi has a moment and he goes, he goes to the store

2546
02:35:04,840 --> 02:35:09,960
and he takes it that they're like, sir, you have to wear a shirt right now. I have no fucking clue

2547
02:35:09,960 --> 02:35:16,280
what he's talking about. He takes the shirt and it says, Oh my God. Oh wait. Is Shane texting me?

2548
02:35:21,640 --> 02:35:28,680
It says who, what, where, when wine, I would wear that. Thank you, Shane. I would wear that.

2549
02:35:29,640 --> 02:35:33,560
Sorry. That's too good. That's like fucking I'm sitting here blanking.

2550
02:35:33,560 --> 02:35:36,440
Don't you wish you could do that in the real world? Like you're just there and you're like,

2551
02:35:36,440 --> 02:35:39,080
try to like, you're at a meeting. You're like, I forgot what I was going to say.

2552
02:35:39,080 --> 02:35:42,520
And then suddenly like God texts you and it's just, Oh, there's the answer.

2553
02:35:42,520 --> 02:35:45,000
Seriously. Still want a shirt that says Jenna clock.

2554
02:35:46,360 --> 02:35:49,960
All right. Uh, let's move on. Poor Rama has been singing there like,

2555
02:35:49,960 --> 02:35:53,880
okay, Ron, for like 15 minutes while we're sitting here talking about

2556
02:35:54,520 --> 02:35:57,320
everything else under the sun. Hi Rama. How are you?

2557
02:35:58,040 --> 02:36:03,480
I'm fine, Rob. How are you? I'm great. Now that I remembered what that fucking shirt said,

2558
02:36:03,480 --> 02:36:08,840
and now that we've had our queer discussion, one Oh one chat, but maybe you have a video game or

2559
02:36:08,840 --> 02:36:15,000
two you'd like to talk about. I just want to say, I kind of feel bad cause I'm sitting here waiting

2560
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:20,520
and the chat's going and I'm like, I'm like randomly unmuting the show so I can hear what's

2561
02:36:20,520 --> 02:36:25,800
going on. So that when you pick up the call, there's no feedback, you know? So I'm just trying

2562
02:36:25,960 --> 02:36:30,280
to figure yourself out pro tip because I actually do this to monitor as well.

2563
02:36:30,280 --> 02:36:33,160
So I'm going to give you a little inside baseball, what happens behind the scene.

2564
02:36:33,160 --> 02:36:37,880
So I think everybody is figured out behind the scenes a little bit, actually. Okay. You know

2565
02:36:37,880 --> 02:36:42,120
what? I'm in a real fuck it mode tonight and we'll, we'll do and do things a little unprofessional.

2566
02:36:42,120 --> 02:36:46,360
Jamie, since you're right by the camera, would you tilt it just a little bit so that they can see the

2567
02:36:46,360 --> 02:36:50,760
TV and they can actually see, thank you. You're going to have to set it back. Okay. So you can

2568
02:36:50,760 --> 02:36:56,440
actually see, we have a TV that's here that actually lets us see like ourselves. So we know

2569
02:36:56,440 --> 02:37:00,600
what's going out on the stream and we can see like the discord and all of that stuff that actually,

2570
02:37:00,600 --> 02:37:06,360
um, goes, goes on out there. Um, so yeah, no, you're fine. That's, that's how it goes back.

2571
02:37:06,360 --> 02:37:13,000
So it's like, it's just like sitting just barely off there. So usually before OLR starts Bobby

2572
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:16,920
Black Wolf, we have the VOG network Twitch up there on the TV. It also gave me a chance to

2573
02:37:16,920 --> 02:37:21,960
fix this corner of the tripod that was like about to fall off. It's been bothering me all night.

2574
02:37:22,600 --> 02:37:28,600
Um, so we're usually watching Bobby Black Wolf on the TV, but when, when he does that call to us,

2575
02:37:28,600 --> 02:37:34,760
we turn him off so that we can take the call, but we never put him back on because if he's on this

2576
02:37:34,760 --> 02:37:39,560
computer, then that audio is going to go out when we take the feed. So what we do, and my point is,

2577
02:37:39,560 --> 02:37:46,520
what we do is then I move the feed to the mobile phone and I watch on my mobile until he's done.

2578
02:37:46,600 --> 02:37:51,800
And then that way I'm, I'm able to quickly turn it off and start the feed. So my pro tip is if

2579
02:37:51,800 --> 02:37:55,800
you're sitting there on hold waiting, use your mobile phone to still, and then that way you're

2580
02:37:55,800 --> 02:38:01,160
not going to get the feedback. Hold on. I forgot the horns apparently. Oh, okay. According to act

2581
02:38:01,160 --> 02:38:05,400
deaf. So I had to throw up some horns. All right. Little look behind the scenes there. I'm sure. I

2582
02:38:05,400 --> 02:38:08,920
think all you knew there was like a TV or some type of monitor here. Cause you can usually,

2583
02:38:08,920 --> 02:38:13,800
we're just staring off and see us looking at it. We're really bad about that. I mean,

2584
02:38:14,280 --> 02:38:20,360
sorry. In the, I have watched some Japanese Pokemon, so I have in the brain instead of me.

2585
02:38:20,360 --> 02:38:26,120
Well, I'm hoping in a future studio, I'm hoping what is going to happen is that the TV will

2586
02:38:26,120 --> 02:38:34,120
actually be there behind Jamie or next to Jamie. So we can see it, but then, well, I'm hoping that

2587
02:38:34,120 --> 02:38:41,160
by then I'll have a 4k TV. So we'll have two TVs. So that's, but that's pie in the sky future

2588
02:38:42,040 --> 02:38:45,000
improvements, et cetera. But that's not what Rama wanted to talk about.

2589
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:46,920
Of course, as she went under Matt, just clip that.

2590
02:38:47,800 --> 02:38:48,520
What's up Rama?

2591
02:38:49,160 --> 02:38:53,800
I will say that's how I kind of have my setup when I do my stream, but, um, a couple of things

2592
02:38:53,800 --> 02:39:00,680
now I've been reading about the whole GameStop closing stores. And normally I would sit here

2593
02:39:00,680 --> 02:39:08,520
and laugh and be like, sucks to be you guys, but I think I I've matured somewhat. So I'm more like,

2594
02:39:08,520 --> 02:39:13,560
well, maybe they do things differently because I have been saying for the longest time,

2595
02:39:13,560 --> 02:39:19,960
what GameStop needs to do is start closing two stores that are between each other,

2596
02:39:19,960 --> 02:39:26,040
find a location and between those stores, make it larger and make it sort of like a boutique

2597
02:39:26,040 --> 02:39:31,080
X store. Because to be perfectly honest, when I walk into GameStop, it's almost like walking into

2598
02:39:31,960 --> 02:39:37,080
a good, the Goodwill of video games. You walk in, there's shelves of games here,

2599
02:39:37,080 --> 02:39:43,400
there's clothing there, there's merch there, there's geeks. It's just like a giant mess.

2600
02:39:44,360 --> 02:39:48,920
You know, and I think when you talk about the whole like maturing and all that stuff,

2601
02:39:48,920 --> 02:39:53,720
I think it's a similar perspective maybe to like where I was saying earlier. And I think, I think,

2602
02:39:53,720 --> 02:39:58,920
Matt and Jamie are on a similar page where it's like, this story is a little harder to sit here

2603
02:39:58,920 --> 02:40:03,640
and make fun of and like LOL GameStop, because you kind of realize the people who are really

2604
02:40:03,640 --> 02:40:08,680
impacted by this are those workers that are really just trying to like pay their way at,

2605
02:40:08,680 --> 02:40:12,760
you know, and get the job experience and so forth. And you kind of feel bad for them. Like,

2606
02:40:12,760 --> 02:40:17,320
because this whole thing has been mismanaged for a while, and we all kind of know that,

2607
02:40:17,320 --> 02:40:23,160
like you just kind of feel bad for those people that are just trying to have a fucking job. You

2608
02:40:23,160 --> 02:40:27,000
know what I mean? I think that's where my head's at. Yeah, because I have a couple of friends who

2609
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:32,520
are managers and yes, even they know they are asshole employees and so forth. And you know,

2610
02:40:32,520 --> 02:40:38,120
I don't even talk about GameStop like in a negative aspect anymore. I just feel like,

2611
02:40:38,120 --> 02:40:42,120
you know, they got a job to do. I totally get it. I've been on the other side of that,

2612
02:40:42,120 --> 02:40:46,200
but I know if I want to go get good service, I know a couple of stores I can travel to,

2613
02:40:46,200 --> 02:40:52,360
to get the best service. But you know what? Those who bust their asses in retail to give you the

2614
02:40:52,360 --> 02:40:57,560
best service, they don't really get the attention that you deserve as opposed to 9,000 out of 10,

2615
02:40:57,560 --> 02:41:01,320
it's more people complaining about the bad service instead of the good service, you know?

2616
02:41:03,400 --> 02:41:09,720
I totally, I know how it is. And that's customer service in general. We can go on a whole tangent

2617
02:41:09,720 --> 02:41:13,800
with that, how you remember the bad shit, but you know, the good shit doesn't always stick out as

2618
02:41:13,800 --> 02:41:19,400
much, but well, that stuff does too. Like I think there's probably a restaurant you go to more often

2619
02:41:19,400 --> 02:41:23,400
than others because you just really like some of the staff that works there. But anyway, I digress.

2620
02:41:23,400 --> 02:41:26,040
Now I stopped working retail the moment I get held up at gunpoint.

2621
02:41:27,480 --> 02:41:29,400
Well, yeah, that's a pretty-

2622
02:41:29,400 --> 02:41:30,920
At a GN fucking C.

2623
02:41:30,920 --> 02:41:33,160
But you know, that's kind of like an outlier type of experience too.

2624
02:41:33,160 --> 02:41:34,600
Yeah, but at a GMC.

2625
02:41:34,600 --> 02:41:36,600
Yeah. No, I know. No place is immune.

2626
02:41:37,400 --> 02:41:41,880
To back up what Jamie said, that actually happened to a friend of mine about two years ago working at

2627
02:41:42,680 --> 02:41:49,480
AT&T flagship store. Yeah, she worked about four months afterwards. Cause you know,

2628
02:41:50,280 --> 02:41:53,960
to be perfectly honest, when you've been in retail for so long, it takes a while to make

2629
02:41:53,960 --> 02:41:58,520
that adjustment from the retail sector to the private sector, you know, trying to find

2630
02:41:59,080 --> 02:42:03,960
where, what type of job that you fit in and so forth, your skillset. Like I said,

2631
02:42:03,960 --> 02:42:08,760
I got lucky being in IT my entire life. So I was able to make that jump a lot easier than others.

2632
02:42:10,520 --> 02:42:13,880
It's so funny. You're talking about like this whole like private sector and stuff.

2633
02:42:13,880 --> 02:42:15,960
I'm going to text you something cause I don't want to stay on here.

2634
02:42:15,960 --> 02:42:23,800
I went, I went from mortgage servicing to IT and honestly, I love IT so much more.

2635
02:42:24,920 --> 02:42:25,480
Yeah.

2636
02:42:26,760 --> 02:42:28,040
Anything else on your mind, my friend?

2637
02:42:29,240 --> 02:42:33,880
Can I talk a little gaming nerdy romance for a bit?

2638
02:42:35,080 --> 02:42:39,160
Duh, of course, please. Is it going to be, is it going to be the Musk game?

2639
02:42:39,800 --> 02:42:43,480
No, this is, this is actually ties into Castle Crashers.

2640
02:42:45,960 --> 02:42:50,840
So I haven't really said, but I've been dating somebody for about, let's say about two,

2641
02:42:50,840 --> 02:42:56,680
three months. And when she came to visit, we were hanging out gaming and she noticed I had

2642
02:42:56,680 --> 02:43:03,720
Castle Crashers. So I'm like, she's like getting a little excited and I didn't realize that's like

2643
02:43:03,720 --> 02:43:08,360
one of her all time favorite games. So while she was here, we played Castle Crashers.

2644
02:43:08,360 --> 02:43:14,920
And I said, you know, I got free time on Sundays, so we should make it our gaming night. Now, due

2645
02:43:14,920 --> 02:43:22,280
to us having odd schedules on the weekends, we couldn't do it until like tonight. Cause she was

2646
02:43:22,280 --> 02:43:25,800
not in the best of mood. So I said, you know what, if you're feeling up to it,

2647
02:43:25,800 --> 02:43:29,480
let's jump on live, play Castle Crashers, kind of get away from it all.

2648
02:43:30,120 --> 02:43:36,280
So I, she goes, I got the game up and running, jump on it. I go and I fire up the game and I'm

2649
02:43:36,280 --> 02:43:41,320
not seeing her. I didn't realize till tonight, there was a Castle Crashers remastered and she

2650
02:43:41,320 --> 02:43:46,680
was on that one. I'm running, I'm playing the backwards compatible one. So I'm like, well,

2651
02:43:46,680 --> 02:43:52,200
I'm kind of short on funds at the moment. So let me see what I can do. So while I'm looking up,

2652
02:43:52,600 --> 02:43:57,800
how much it costs, and then I see the deal for the upgrade, she pings me a messenger with a code.

2653
02:43:58,920 --> 02:44:04,760
She bought me Castle Crashers remastered just so we could game together. And I'm just sitting there

2654
02:44:05,320 --> 02:44:11,800
stunned. I'm just like, you did what? She's like, that's sweet. You're going to buy her dinner.

2655
02:44:12,840 --> 02:44:18,440
I've already bought her dinner. I bought her some cute stuff. So, you know, I've been spoiling her

2656
02:44:18,440 --> 02:44:24,200
and she spoiled me. And here's the part that kind of also blew my mind. After we played,

2657
02:44:24,200 --> 02:44:30,920
she sends me a picture of her with her gaming headset and she's wearing a Sailor Mars shirt.

2658
02:44:30,920 --> 02:44:36,360
And I'm just looking at her like that shirt. And she's like, what do you mean? I sent her a picture

2659
02:44:36,360 --> 02:44:42,200
of me with my headphones and I'm wearing the Venus version of that shirt, same artist,

2660
02:44:42,200 --> 02:44:46,920
but two different send sheets. So we were like, we are on the same hive mind or something. So,

2661
02:44:46,920 --> 02:44:56,200
you know, nerdy love in a nutshell. I love this story. I want regular updates on this story.

2662
02:44:58,440 --> 02:45:04,520
Well, you'll be getting some updates. Um, we do have some future couple cosplays planned

2663
02:45:04,520 --> 02:45:15,160
coming down the line. So you know, couple cosplay. Yes. I love it. I can't wait to

2664
02:45:15,160 --> 02:45:21,960
keep making fun of you. Go right ahead. You know, but it's funny, you know, and, you know,

2665
02:45:22,760 --> 02:45:27,320
we go a ways back. We met in the same fandom, Ranma what have, and it's like,

2666
02:45:29,240 --> 02:45:37,880
she knows what Dan and I met. Yeah. Well, in town square Sailor Moon over our love of Ranma,

2667
02:45:37,880 --> 02:45:41,960
you know, that's how Alan and I met in town square Sailor Moon over your love of Ranma.

2668
02:45:41,960 --> 02:45:43,960
No, we actually didn't meet that way at all, but it sounded good.

2669
02:45:45,720 --> 02:45:52,280
But what's cool is that we've met in the same fandom, but she is, she's like, she's my Midwest

2670
02:45:52,280 --> 02:45:57,960
Ucchan. Cause I said to her, I already have an Ucchan. She gets that title cause we're,

2671
02:45:58,600 --> 02:46:02,120
that's how it goes. And she's like, okay, I'm cool with that. So, you know,

2672
02:46:02,120 --> 02:46:08,360
so now I got two awesome Ucchans in my life. That's so cute. I love it. All right. Well,

2673
02:46:08,360 --> 02:46:14,040
sadly I do have to move on cause we have to wrap up here pretty soon, but I look forward to

2674
02:46:14,040 --> 02:46:18,440
hearing from you again and hearing what other games y'all are playing together in the future.

2675
02:46:18,440 --> 02:46:23,320
I will say this video games are fun cause you mentioned she's in the Midwest. So obviously

2676
02:46:23,320 --> 02:46:28,600
you got some long distance thing going on there. I will mention video games are awesome for like

2677
02:46:28,600 --> 02:46:33,080
bridging that, especially in this day and age with the multiplayer games. Um, because, you know,

2678
02:46:33,080 --> 02:46:36,920
Alan and I, we weren't really long distance. We were like mid distance. Okay. He lived in South

2679
02:46:36,920 --> 02:46:41,480
San Francisco. I lived up here in Sacramento. That's about a hundred, 120 miles apart. So like

2680
02:46:41,480 --> 02:46:46,920
doable on the weekend, but not really doable during the week. So we played a lot of world

2681
02:46:46,920 --> 02:46:50,680
Warcraft back in the day and it was like, we would go party and questing together and stuff.

2682
02:46:50,680 --> 02:46:58,360
It was really like he had his Albear or Moonkin or whatever. Yeah. So, uh, video games,

2683
02:46:58,360 --> 02:47:05,560
they bring people together. I love it. All right, Rama. Okay. I got to go. Cause I'm still kind of

2684
02:47:05,720 --> 02:47:09,240
shocked slash blushing over this whole thing. I'm just like, I got to get back to my,

2685
02:47:09,240 --> 02:47:16,200
my semi normal moody self, you know? I love it. All right. Well have fun blushing.

2686
02:47:18,360 --> 02:47:24,440
Okay. Take care, buddy. Bye. Bye. Ah, so good to hear from Rama. And I love that I had no,

2687
02:47:24,440 --> 02:47:28,280
am I just behind on social media? I had no idea that that was like a thing that was going on.

2688
02:47:28,280 --> 02:47:34,040
I knew you knew, but we talked. Yeah, that's fair. And I I've been really out of the loop between

2689
02:47:34,920 --> 02:47:39,320
going out of town for so long for dragon con coming back and having to wrap everything up

2690
02:47:39,320 --> 02:47:42,680
at my last job and then immediately start a new job where I was out of town for a week.

2691
02:47:42,680 --> 02:47:47,160
Like I've just been out of it y'all. So. Apologies if I've been behind on social media,

2692
02:47:47,160 --> 02:47:51,000
if you like got married or something and I forgot to congratulate you or you had a baby or something,

2693
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:54,440
like just send me a message and I'll give you your belated congratulations. You didn't like

2694
02:47:54,440 --> 02:47:57,880
have another baby or anything. Did you? No, I didn't have anything like that happened this week.

2695
02:47:58,040 --> 02:48:04,200
Besides that Nelly had the babies. You know what I mean? No, I didn't do any of that.

2696
02:48:04,200 --> 02:48:10,040
Why are you laughing? Did something happen this week? Yeah. You mentioned it on Twitter.

2697
02:48:14,440 --> 02:48:22,680
What happened this week? I started a new job. No. You did. I remember replying to you about

2698
02:48:22,680 --> 02:48:29,560
something. You'll figure it out eventually. That is the worst possible fucking thing you

2699
02:48:29,560 --> 02:48:34,360
can say to somebody that has like no fucking memory in the world. Now I'm on the spot here.

2700
02:48:34,360 --> 02:48:38,200
Hold on. I'm looking because there was something Logie tweeted about and I was like,

2701
02:48:39,080 --> 02:48:43,400
Oh God, I just went through the 20 tweet thread of my friend that was watching

2702
02:48:44,120 --> 02:48:50,520
kidnapped in plain or what is that? Abducted in plain sight. That was it for the very first time.

2703
02:48:51,480 --> 02:48:58,520
Oh my God. It was your fucking birthday earlier this week. And I'd forgot to say

2704
02:48:58,520 --> 02:49:05,480
something on the show last week. I'm such an asshole. Happy birthday. I remember. Look,

2705
02:49:05,480 --> 02:49:11,880
here's the thing. Loki's birthday. Very hard to forget. So I said, well, I was also busy making

2706
02:49:11,880 --> 02:49:17,480
myself sad. His birthday. I had no problem. So I'm not that forgetful. I did say happy birthday on

2707
02:49:17,480 --> 02:49:22,200
the birthday and tweet about it. But that was like Tuesday and today is Sunday. Tuesday might

2708
02:49:22,200 --> 02:49:27,400
as well have been like 500 years ago. Like it's just, that's how fast things move. What did you

2709
02:49:27,400 --> 02:49:32,280
get to do for your birthday? Um, I didn't really do anything on my birthday, but we went to being

2710
02:49:32,280 --> 02:49:38,920
honest. Like you do. That's a great reward. Did you get the fried rice? Yeah. God, that's the best

2711
02:49:38,920 --> 02:49:45,320
stuff in the world. I haven't eaten at Benihana. I will point out only like only like two people

2712
02:49:45,320 --> 02:49:54,360
in chat caught on. So y'all are just as dumb as I am. I'm trying to redeem these keys for

2713
02:49:54,360 --> 02:49:59,720
Borderlands three, but their site is just, I was wondering what that website was. It looked like,

2714
02:49:59,720 --> 02:50:04,120
well, like, okay. So I went in and I had registered like earlier and then it linked,

2715
02:50:04,120 --> 02:50:09,320
it created a whole new profile attached to my other email address. So I was like, okay,

2716
02:50:09,320 --> 02:50:14,200
well that's not the one I use for Borderlands. So that's not going to work. So I have to redeem all

2717
02:50:14,200 --> 02:50:19,880
the keys again. Did you, did, uh, did the kids get you anything for your birthday?

2718
02:50:19,880 --> 02:50:26,280
No, no, no gaming stuff. No. What? We got to fix that. Did you buy yourself

2719
02:50:26,280 --> 02:50:30,440
Borderlands three for your birthday? I was just going to buy it anyways. There's that. All right,

2720
02:50:30,440 --> 02:50:33,560
well we gotta, we gotta pull our money together and get you something nice for your birthday.

2721
02:50:34,120 --> 02:50:39,480
All right. Pod culture says I didn't catch it and my birthday is the day before Loki's.

2722
02:50:39,480 --> 02:50:43,480
Thank you and happy belated to you as well. Pod culture. I hope you had a great day.

2723
02:50:43,480 --> 02:50:48,520
So good. Um, SG100 Matt says, I also didn't say happy birthday on Loki's Facebook,

2724
02:50:48,520 --> 02:50:52,920
but I don't go on it anymore. Fair. Excuse me. Happy birthday, Loki. Thank you. So there you go.

2725
02:50:53,480 --> 02:50:57,160
It's just another, right? You hit a certain point where it's like, eh, it's just another year.

2726
02:50:57,160 --> 02:51:03,160
Was this year 38 or 39? 39. Oh, so the big ones next year. So are you gonna do anything for 40?

2727
02:51:03,800 --> 02:51:09,800
I don't know. Right answer. All right. Anyhow. Uh, I think that's gonna about wrap it up. Well,

2728
02:51:09,800 --> 02:51:13,240
actually I do want to check if there are any last minute stories, uh, real quick here. I

2729
02:51:13,720 --> 02:51:19,240
uh, caught anything for, uh, any other things people want to talk about Loki or dark Sakura

2730
02:51:19,240 --> 02:51:23,240
with last minute stories. Not a thing from law. No, I forgot to put a box for last minute

2731
02:51:23,240 --> 02:51:27,480
stories tonight. Whoops. Oh, Wells. I don't think we have any. So do you have anything?

2732
02:51:28,440 --> 02:51:32,600
No, but now won't let me, I guess. Oh, I, okay. I get what's going on here. Cause I was like

2733
02:51:32,600 --> 02:51:40,040
trying to redeem this and it, it did what I needed it to do, but it, it's just a weird,

2734
02:51:40,120 --> 02:51:45,960
so yes, I got all my golden keys still and maybe two weapons because apparently they link.

2735
02:51:45,960 --> 02:51:50,840
Cause I linked my Epic account to both of them. I had to unlink it from one. So

2736
02:51:52,920 --> 02:51:56,840
I don't know. It's stupid. Uh, what level are you? Borderlands three.

2737
02:51:56,840 --> 02:52:00,440
Oh, I'm like three. I haven't, I've only played for like a couple hours. Yeah. Well,

2738
02:52:00,440 --> 02:52:03,400
hopefully you get to play some more. I almost don't want to play Zane anymore.

2739
02:52:03,400 --> 02:52:06,840
I kind of want to play as the beast master again, but I can always play the game again.

2740
02:52:06,840 --> 02:52:11,800
All right. Um, well, uh, any final thoughts, I guess, uh, we'll go around and get final thoughts.

2741
02:52:11,800 --> 02:52:16,440
Oh, I did. I'm sorry. I did have one last minute, sir. Real quick. Um, so there's this,

2742
02:52:16,440 --> 02:52:21,320
luckily it's your birthday, so I'll let it slide. There's this, uh, project that's being worked on

2743
02:52:21,320 --> 02:52:28,040
called project 1999 green. It's going to be released October 25th. And what is it? You may

2744
02:52:28,040 --> 02:52:36,680
ask? Well, it is Charlie XCX and a Troye Sivan collaboration. No, it is the original version

2745
02:52:36,680 --> 02:52:42,840
of EverQuest. They are putting a, um, some fans are putting together a server that's like

2746
02:52:42,840 --> 02:52:48,920
EverQuest classic. Oh, I was just so like, wow. Classic inspired type of thing. Interesting.

2747
02:52:48,920 --> 02:52:53,080
Yeah. So they're going to, and the servers will then change progress through all of the patches

2748
02:52:53,080 --> 02:52:57,960
in the same timeline as the original launch. So in January, 2020, you get plane of fear,

2749
02:52:57,960 --> 02:53:06,760
April, 2020 plane of hate, uh, may, 2020 temple of the Celeste row. And then legacy items, uh,

2750
02:53:06,760 --> 02:53:15,560
cease to drop November, 2020 ruins of, uh, Knark and 2021 April epics. And it goes on from there.

2751
02:53:15,560 --> 02:53:22,680
Where's final fantasy 11 classic. Am I right? It is still classic. It is. It's still going

2752
02:53:22,680 --> 02:53:30,120
to beta RO to come back just with the fast leveling warp, please. He'll please prompt,

2753
02:53:30,120 --> 02:53:37,480
please prompt, please. One of my favorite pictures ever was when you and I were playing that game

2754
02:53:37,480 --> 02:53:40,760
and we both had our little stars masks on and the characters that you were so cute. We were

2755
02:53:40,760 --> 02:53:45,400
kneeling down next to each other. And I think I had a flower in my hair and a, Oh, it was a bow

2756
02:53:45,400 --> 02:53:49,480
and the stars mask. I was like, I wish we could find that picture playing a priest. I have it

2757
02:53:49,480 --> 02:53:53,640
somewhere on my computer and I think it was playing my assassin. We need to post it on

2758
02:53:53,640 --> 02:53:58,840
social media somewhere. It's tiny. I mean, this was low res cause I think it was like windows 95,

2759
02:53:58,840 --> 02:54:05,240
but still, yeah, I'll find this computer probably could run it. All right. Anyway. All right. Uh,

2760
02:54:05,240 --> 02:54:08,680
that's going to do it for another episode of orange laundry tonight. Thank you guys so much

2761
02:54:08,680 --> 02:54:13,560
for listening to the show, either on the podcast feed, of course, or if you were watching us live

2762
02:54:13,560 --> 02:54:17,480
on Twitch or even in the archives on Twitch, cause you're a subscriber. Thank you so much for your

2763
02:54:17,480 --> 02:54:22,360
support of orange lounge radio. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Um, been having a lot of fun

2764
02:54:22,360 --> 02:54:27,880
these past few weeks and we're marching on, on to episode 800 and, uh, looking at doing some

2765
02:54:27,880 --> 02:54:32,200
retooling of a few segments of the show, uh, which I still have yet to talk to Jamie and Matt about,

2766
02:54:32,200 --> 02:54:36,680
but, uh, I know they have ideas too. So we have some fun stuff in store. Hopefully nothing too

2767
02:54:36,680 --> 02:54:40,120
idea. I don't want you guys to freak out. It's not a big deal, but you know, just once, once in

2768
02:54:40,120 --> 02:54:44,280
a while you got to fluff the pillows, zhuzh it up a little. So that's, that's what we're talking

2769
02:54:44,280 --> 02:54:51,000
about. So anyhow, then pillows be even fluffier out, we'll be sleeping vertical. If you enjoyed

2770
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:54,200
what you heard here at orange launch radio, please tell a friend or two about the show.

2771
02:54:54,200 --> 02:54:57,160
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice,

2772
02:54:57,160 --> 02:55:01,400
but the voices have to be here to like put out on the air and stuff. So please

2773
02:55:01,400 --> 02:55:05,720
help us spread the word. Um, we got to go around and get everybody's final thought for the night.

2774
02:55:05,720 --> 02:55:11,880
Uh, dark, Oh, a nice five star review on iTunes goes a long way. Hosts on Twitch are the best.

2775
02:55:11,880 --> 02:55:14,760
So if you have a Twitch account, even if you don't stream that much yourself,

2776
02:55:14,760 --> 02:55:22,840
please consider adding VOG network and Rob Roberts and dark Sakura. I had to and Loki of course,

2777
02:55:22,840 --> 02:55:28,040
to your auto host list, uh, on, but most of all VOG network to your auto host list, because that

2778
02:55:28,040 --> 02:55:32,360
all goes a very, very long way in helping to spread the word. Cause I know I find new streams

2779
02:55:32,360 --> 02:55:36,280
from what my friends are watching. So think about how you might've found this anyway. Uh,

2780
02:55:36,280 --> 02:55:39,000
let's go around and get everybody's final thought. Uh, dark Sakura, since you're,

2781
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:42,600
you're packing up about ready to get out for the night. Well, if Dan will ever tell me what

2782
02:55:42,600 --> 02:55:46,200
he needs from the freaking grocery store, if he wants to wait to go with me, I mean,

2783
02:55:46,200 --> 02:55:51,960
geez, husband, how hard is it to answer your text messages? You've got car play. I mean, I love you.

2784
02:55:54,040 --> 02:55:58,920
Uh, my final thought is speaking of cars, like I'm even though my current car is not paid off,

2785
02:55:58,920 --> 02:56:03,880
I can't, they're, they're leaving me those flyers, like trade in your car and get a new car. And I'm

2786
02:56:03,880 --> 02:56:09,000
like, Oh, they send those to everybody. I go, of course they do, but I'll be honest though,

2787
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:14,600
the roller skate is starting to have issues. No, it still makes me go. I kind of want a new car.

2788
02:56:14,600 --> 02:56:19,000
Doesn't Alan want to take over the payments on my car so I can get a new roller skate. I was

2789
02:56:19,000 --> 02:56:23,560
driving by the rink over here and I'm surprised how packed that thing is. Oh yeah. Oh, they do

2790
02:56:23,560 --> 02:56:27,880
like private events and stuff. I think especially like, cause there's a lot of big churches in the

2791
02:56:27,880 --> 02:56:31,960
area and a lot of them will rent it out and do like, you know, teen and kid events. I'm just

2792
02:56:32,200 --> 02:56:38,360
people to suggest cars that are as small as a Fiat, but aren't a smart car or, um, a Chevy spark.

2793
02:56:39,960 --> 02:56:44,760
So, all right. Uh, let's see. I was your final thought. My final thought, your final thought,

2794
02:56:45,560 --> 02:56:49,640
uh, my final thought is hopefully get the place more Borderlands this week and I'm still working

2795
02:56:49,640 --> 02:56:55,400
on my game. I hope so too. Don't forget your cookies. Oh yeah. Those cookies are, I ate

2796
02:56:55,400 --> 02:56:59,800
fucking four cookies, dark soccer. They were really good. So I'm glad you enjoyed. All right,

2797
02:56:59,800 --> 02:57:03,880
we'll see what cookies. I didn't bring them all with me as I have some waiting for me at home.

2798
02:57:03,880 --> 02:57:07,880
We'll see what cookies are in store next week. We will be back next week to do this all again.

2799
02:57:07,880 --> 02:57:11,400
You're still here next week, right? I know there's a show in the near future you're off, but

2800
02:57:11,400 --> 02:57:18,840
that is after I have my surgery. Oh, that's October, right? That is the weekend after.

2801
02:57:18,840 --> 02:57:22,760
Yeah. Cause October is getting crazy cause I have a bunch of hosting gigs, but none of them are on

2802
02:57:22,760 --> 02:57:27,880
Sunday, but that actually may depend on my recovery. So it's a, it's a depends. All right.

2803
02:57:27,880 --> 02:57:31,320
It depends because I have the week off of work after that to recover from my surgery,

2804
02:57:31,320 --> 02:57:35,240
but they say that may only need two days. Oh, cool. All right. Well, we will be back in seven

2805
02:57:35,240 --> 02:57:39,560
days. All of us to do this show all over again, and we hope you'll be joining us at that time.

2806
02:57:39,560 --> 02:57:42,840
Thank you so much for sticking with us for another night of orange launch radio.
