00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,520
This week, classic game preservation, lawsuit three masters, teases, and the general lot.

2
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,640
If you'll excuse me, I'm going to go play the original medieval because I never did

3
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,520
when I was younger and its remake is coming out.

4
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,400
That's what I'll be doing over the next couple of hours while listening to the show

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,120
where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:31,120
Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:36,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,680
where every gamer has a voice.

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:44,080
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 794 for this September 29th

10
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,480
of 2019.

11
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:51,680
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me here in Studio N7 in Sacramento, California, say

12
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,400
hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

13
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,440
Happy New Year, Jews.

14
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,800
Yes, Happy New Year.

15
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,880
Happy Jew Year.

16
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,280
You had last week off.

17
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,280
Yeah.

18
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,280
How you doing?

19
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,280
On fire.

20
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,240
There's a fire.

21
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,800
There's a fire in your heart?

22
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,600
In my dark, rotten heart.

23
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,600
I see.

24
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:21,480
Burning away the rottenness and leaving me in a mood, quote fingers, a mood.

25
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,000
And what's fanning those flames?

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,680
Is it the wings of a goose?

27
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,680
I haven't played it yet.

28
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,680
It's a lack of Pepto.

29
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,680
Oh, hi, Tech Master Loki.

30
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,680
How are you?

31
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,680
Hi, I'm here.

32
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,680
As you can see on the camera.

33
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,920
Or not, because you may be listening to us.

34
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,440
Yeah, they may be listening on the podcast feed.

35
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,160
Yeah, I think I need like a Zantac or something.

36
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:42,320
But if you want to watch us live, you can every week at Twitch TV slash VOG Network,

37
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,000
where we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,280
after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

39
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,640
And you can chat along in our chat room and we read some of the comments throughout the

40
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,640
evening on chat.

41
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,760
Excuse me, on the stream and on our show.

42
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,840
And of course, later in the show, we'll invite your calls via Discord or if you're feeling

43
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,680
shy, of course, we take lots of questions from the chat room and all that good stuff.

44
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,920
So we have to catch things up on Dark Sakura.

45
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,440
We have to we have to go over the outstanding agenda items from our last meeting for meeting

46
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,000
number 793.

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Did you write the minutes?

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,760
So yes, item number one, Dark Sakura, I brought you an offering.

49
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,040
It's a new little Mortal Kombat mini machine that I paid you for.

50
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,040
You did.

51
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,880
But I talked a little bit about this on last week's show.

52
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,960
I'm just kind of curious what you think of it in person.

53
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,200
This is kind of funky on it.

54
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,200
Yeah.

55
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,600
They're probably that way to be.

56
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,160
You know, I didn't even notice it right off the bat, but there's six buttons on it.

57
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,160
Yeah.

58
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,160
Five.

59
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,160
That's really weird.

60
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,160
I think Loki noticed that, like, right off the bat.

61
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,160
He was like, why is there six?

62
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,640
But I saw in the picture that you sent, but I was like, maybe it was just well, then it's

63
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,680
got there.

64
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,680
It's a block button.

65
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,820
It's a port of the Genesis version.

66
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,360
And although someone like I don't know if they've confirmed it or not.

67
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,800
You said that there was no blood in there, but it alludes to a blood code.

68
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,960
And since it's a Genesis version, you'd think that you'd still be able to put the blood

69
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,960
code in.

70
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,080
It doesn't say anything on it.

71
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,080
Yeah.

72
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,080
About licensing.

73
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,080
I didn't.

74
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,840
I haven't, to be honest, I haven't really turned it on and played with it yet.

75
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,980
That's something I hope to do a little later.

76
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:08,980
So we'll see.

77
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,980
Anyway.

78
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,980
I'm turning it on.

79
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:11,980
Yeah.

80
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,720
I already played a little bit with it on this feed last week, so I don't want to repeat

81
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,720
ourselves too bad.

82
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,080
But I just wanted to see what you thought of that in person now that you're here.

83
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,400
It doesn't look like the Genesis version though.

84
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,720
It's got better animation.

85
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,020
You think it looks like the Genesis version to me, but it might be different hardware

86
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,020
in there.

87
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,020
Who knows?

88
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,020
Anyway.

89
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,400
Um, there was another outstanding agenda item.

90
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,400
Oh yes.

91
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,400
Things of super importance.

92
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,000
Cause you know, we do talk video games here at Orange Lawn Radio, but once in a while

93
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,800
other things come up too.

94
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,340
So Loki tried to go back to the chicken place last week and guess what?

95
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,520
They're gone.

96
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,520
They're gone.

97
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,520
Out of business already.

98
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,520
It's been like a month.

99
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,520
Chicken.

100
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,520
The Korean chicken place.

101
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,520
Oh, that sucks.

102
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,440
A moment of silence, please.

103
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,400
They are officially gone.

104
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,400
Wow.

105
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,960
Because, uh, I did see like if you actually go up on Google reviews, someone posted the

106
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,640
eviction notice, so it's legit.

107
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,640
They've been evicted.

108
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,640
Yikes.

109
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,160
No more, no more awesome chicken.

110
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,280
At least I had it twice.

111
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,880
I hope it wasn't cause they failed a health inspection like real bad or something.

112
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,040
That's uh, whatever they were doing, whatever rat feces were in there, it was delicious.

113
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,200
So that was actually the flavor apparently.

114
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,200
All right.

115
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,200
Anyway, that's, that's what made it taste so good.

116
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,160
It's like, Hmm, maybe I should try Rafi says more often if it tastes like buttery chicken.

117
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,160
Yeah.

118
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,160
All right.

119
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,160
Let's get into games.

120
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,160
Dang it.

121
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,160
There's a, there's a lot going on this week in the gaming world.

122
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,840
Uh, TwitchCon was this week, which is TwitchCon is more one of those.

123
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,000
Like it's gaming culture, obviously, obviously we were fans of Twitch here cause we're doing

124
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,720
our show here live on Twitch, uh, before it goes to the podcast feed.

125
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:43,040
But I think there's lots of people that have certainly consumed Twitch in one way or the

126
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,040
other.

127
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,220
And I know you might be out there thinking, Oh, I'm more a mixer person.

128
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,220
Mixer is better.

129
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,220
Or I like to go on YouTube.

130
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,120
I think there's better stuff on YouTube.

131
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,600
I still kind of think even if you're a fan of an alternative platform for whatever reason,

132
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,820
these sorts of conventions are good to keep your eye on because you know, since there

133
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:03,520
is a little bit more competition coming from specifically mixer, I think in this space,

134
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,960
cause we all know the Ninja thing and by the way, on the tangent, no, I know what you're

135
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,960
talking about.

136
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,960
Y'all know.

137
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,960
Y'all know.

138
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,960
I watched that singing.

139
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,960
Who's under the mask show, right?

140
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,840
What was, I was not expecting freaking Ninja of all people to be one of the celebrities.

141
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,920
I mean, there's, there's your representative.

142
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,400
Oh, you know, it's funny though.

143
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,680
Cause when he got introduced, this is how you know it's not live and that they taped

144
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,640
this stuff like months ago because, uh, Nick Cannon, the host actually said Twitch streamer,

145
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,160
like Twitch guy, he actually said Twitch his name, even though all this shit about mixer

146
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,600
has happened when like several weeks ago.

147
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:42,020
But yeah, he, he was one of the celebrities that was, uh, in the mask.

148
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:46,260
Tim and Johnny Weir, who is a great figure skater if you've ever like watched that stuff.

149
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,260
Anyway.

150
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,260
He's so all right.

151
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,260
All right.

152
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,260
Yeah.

153
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,900
I mean, you know, but there's a, I just think I love the costumes.

154
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,220
So nobody, nobody's that great a singer.

155
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,100
It was very much a Fortnite costume.

156
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,260
Like I would not be surprised if that's a new skin that's coming to Fortnite.

157
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,260
Oh God.

158
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,260
Yeah, probably.

159
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,260
Anyway.

160
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,260
All right.

161
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,440
Not to get on that tension too much, but I couldn't help but bring it up.

162
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,140
But I still think, you know, in that competitive outlet with everything, like you kind of want

163
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:14,540
to watch what Twitch does because, you know, other people are going to, uh, respond to

164
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:19,020
it in various ways, whether it be with their own, you know, um, new features that are inspired

165
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:23,320
by Twitch or vice versa, sometimes Twitch kind of borrows things from other places.

166
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:29,660
So anyway, um, dark Tetsuya in our chat over Twitch TV slash vog network says, wow, he

167
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,660
got on that show.

168
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,660
Yeah.

169
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,660
Go, go figure.

170
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,660
Yeah.

171
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,460
How does that conversation even start?

172
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,860
Like who it's, what's our dream list of people we want to be on the mass singer.

173
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,240
Hey, someone get that Ninja guy.

174
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,300
And it's not like it can even be like, Oh, he'll promote it with his fans that he can't.

175
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:50,340
None of them can because you don't know who's in there until they get kicked off the show.

176
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,340
Right.

177
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,340
It's weird.

178
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,340
I don't know.

179
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,340
Anyway.

180
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,340
Act F says this is a gaming podcast.

181
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,340
Hypothetically.

182
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,820
I mean, that's the category things are under.

183
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,820
He plays games.

184
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,820
Yeah.

185
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:01,820
I mean, yeah.

186
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,820
Anyway.

187
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,820
All right.

188
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,820
Moving on.

189
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,180
Let me just say this again.

190
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,180
I'm a little bit sad.

191
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,180
I couldn't go.

192
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,580
I haven't been in several years.

193
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:14,300
The last Twitch con I went to was when they had it at the Moscone center.

194
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,340
And I want to say that was almost four years ago, maybe five years ago at this point.

195
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:22,000
But that actually, so, so it was actually our voiceover guy who's a big Twitch supporter

196
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,700
and community, you know, personally, he's in a lot of Twitch channels, including this

197
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,700
one.

198
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,540
Um, Jason like was like, no, no, I have an extra ticket.

199
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,820
You're going to Twitch con and come up here for the day.

200
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,820
Come on.

201
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,820
You know?

202
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:38,900
And so, and I'm actually really glad he forced me to go because that really helped me like

203
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:45,340
get Twitch a lot more and actually kind of inspired me to do kind of what's happening

204
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,340
now.

205
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:50,500
I mean, you know, eventually it wasn't a direct path to OLR being on Twitch, but I don't think

206
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,340
we would have got here without that.

207
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,900
So, um, yeah, Twitch con was very inspiring.

208
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:59,340
So I've kind of wanted to go every year since, but they've had it on really bad weekends.

209
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:03,180
They usually have it around Halloween and I'm almost always committed to hosting a show

210
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,180
like October.

211
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:07,700
Cause y'all know, I do hosting gigs here locally on the side for cult cinema and burlesque

212
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,700
and stuff.

213
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,380
And so I do like improv and stuff.

214
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,620
So October is a crazy month for that stuff.

215
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,740
September would have been great if I didn't start a new job just three weeks ago, so I

216
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,740
couldn't make it.

217
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,460
But next year they've already announced, that's one thing to point out.

218
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,820
They've already announced the dates for next year and there's two Twitch cons cause they're

219
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,060
going to have one in Amsterdam earlier in the year as well.

220
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,220
So, uh, but I will definitely, definitely go next year, assuming it doesn't like sell

221
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,780
out or something silly.

222
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:34,900
So as we mentioned, uh, there's going to be a European Twitch con that will happen May

223
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:41,140
2nd and 3rd, 2020 and San Diego will be the home once again, uh, for Twitch con, uh, next

224
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,140
year.

225
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,140
And it's not in October.

226
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,140
It's kind of the same weekend next year.

227
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:48,160
It's the last weekend of September, uh, the 25th through the 27th, some new things that

228
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,420
are going to be coming to Twitch.

229
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:53,880
There's going to be a creator dashboard so you can actually set up actions on your dashboard.

230
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:59,360
It sounds to me a little bit like, like these little stream deck clicky things, like that

231
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,560
the new dashboard is kind of inspired by that a little bit.

232
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,560
So, you know, we like our, our push buttons to be able to do things.

233
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,520
So it sounds like it might be a little bit like that.

234
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,640
This is really cool too.

235
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,120
Um, viewers will be able to earn points for doing things you're already doing that you

236
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,400
can use for rewards like tier one emotes, highlighting a message or other things that

237
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,040
we decide to turn on for you.

238
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,800
I'm sure we here at VOG Network will do something with that.

239
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,960
I just don't know what we'll do with that yet.

240
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,200
I'm not going to promise we'll turn everything on, but I mean, I could see where like the

241
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,880
highlighting the messages or I'm all I'm big on emotes.

242
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,880
Like we could, we could try to use some of that stuff.

243
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,280
So that sounds kind of interesting.

244
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,320
Um, this is also a big, big deal.

245
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,400
Ads are going to change on Twitch.

246
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:46,640
Um, so ads will not necessarily be right at the top of the fee.

247
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,400
You know how, like, if you go to a channel that you're not subscribed to, you get like

248
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,800
a pre-roll ad.

249
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,020
Those may not necessarily be there moving forward because now affiliates as well as

250
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,080
partners will be able to add drop midstream.

251
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:04,000
So if we wanted to, when we wanted to take a quick 30 second studio break or something,

252
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
we could play an ad.

253
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,200
I'm not saying we're doing that.

254
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,060
I don't know how it's going to work yet.

255
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,880
We got a lot to talk about and dissect.

256
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,880
And most importantly, we have to see it in action.

257
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,840
You gotta, you gotta know what tools you really have because there's, there's the spiel that

258
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,840
they give on stage.

259
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,840
Right?

260
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,040
There's nothing with E3 or any type of show where they're showing a new game.

261
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,600
There's the spiel they give you on stage and then it's what it really looks like, right?

262
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,240
There's no man's sky.

263
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,940
There's what they show you on stage and then there's what it really looks like when it

264
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,980
comes out.

265
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,960
And then it's awesome three years later, to be fair.

266
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,560
Uh, there's the Final Fantasy 7 remake, which looked pretty good on stage.

267
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,220
Like there's no way the game's going to look that good.

268
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,760
And now that they're actually showing it, it's like, oh, holy shit, it does kind of

269
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,760
actually look that good.

270
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,360
So, but anyway, we have to see kind of what the ads and all that stuff really look like.

271
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,080
So that'll, that'll be interesting.

272
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:54,120
And also they're going to be building in a new studio to make it easier for new creators

273
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,040
to get started with setup.

274
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,960
There's going to be templates, you know, kind of making the path to streaming a little bit

275
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,960
easier.

276
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:09,400
Let me ask a question of everybody here in studio as well as in our chat room.

277
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,560
Is this a good thing that the accessibility and the way to be able to stream is going

278
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:20,160
to get easier or is it going to saturate what might already be an oversaturated website?

279
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,080
Like is it, are too many people live streaming?

280
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:28,120
I don't necessarily think it's going to over saturate anything because people can already

281
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,120
stream.

282
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,280
It's just that you're not going to have all the, you know, templates and everything to

283
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,520
make it look more professional.

284
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:39,200
It's just, this is adding that kind of polish to your average stream.

285
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,880
So that kind of brings everybody up so that the quality's much better than just like some

286
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:53,040
really shit quality stream that is in a really low resolution with just, I don't know, graphics

287
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,480
made in paint and who knows, I don't know what the worst case scenario would be, but

288
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,240
I think it's just helpful tools that they have to kind of like make their platform seem

289
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:07,360
more desirable than say like Mixer or something like that.

290
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,240
So it's like, hey, look, you know, we'll make it easy.

291
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,440
Here's some, here's some pieces that you can use to kind of get yourself started.

292
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,200
Dr. Sacco, what do you think?

293
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,200
I agree with that.

294
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,640
And there's another aspect to this and that's branding.

295
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:26,200
Twitch has to provide a set standard that's going to fit their brand.

296
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:33,200
Everything, even if it's individual content providers doing their things, they're still

297
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,600
going to have to have something that ties it all back to Twitch and not just that you're

298
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,440
using their interface.

299
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,640
Actually you may not be aware of this and I think you should definitely look at this

300
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,160
and I'll have to send you the direct link if I can find it or maybe somebody can put

301
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,160
it in chat.

302
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,600
Twitch, as part of this whole Twitch kind of thing, did a massive rebranding.

303
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,440
Like they haven't reinvented the site completely, but they kind of went, here is our tweaked

304
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,560
logo and this is why we tweaked it.

305
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,140
Here is our new color of purple and this is why we went with a brighter purple.

306
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:04,860
And then they said, here's all the official shades that we will support.

307
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,980
And they named them all after video game related things.

308
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,180
So there's like a jiggly is one of the colors because it looks like Julie Puff and so on

309
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,180
and so on.

310
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,180
There's all these different colors.

311
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,380
And they said, we're changing our font and the new font is this and this is why we're

312
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,760
going with this font.

313
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,440
And I thought as I was reading it, I actually thought of you because I know you're a big,

314
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,300
like you went to school for design and all that stuff and I kind of thought, I bet Jamie

315
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,140
would appreciate that they're not just saying we're changing our brand, but they're kind

316
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,820
of explaining this is what we want to say with it.

317
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,940
We're picking a bolder purple because we want to be bolder, you know, that type of thing.

318
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,940
I thought that was interesting.

319
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:37,460
No, um, I, I'll be honest, I love the concept of rebranding.

320
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:41,860
I like it when it's done in a very seamless method.

321
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:46,220
Like when they say, you know, we're still using purple, but we're using this shade of

322
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,220
purple now.

323
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,220
You know what I mean?

324
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:53,000
Like if you look at this one shade of pink, you look at and you always think Barbie, right?

325
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,060
If you look at that combination of purple and black today, most of the time for branding,

326
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,680
we're going to think of Twitch.

327
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,740
And that's why they're, you know, with them choosing their specific colors that makes

328
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,360
brand recognition at a glance and just look at the color.

329
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,040
You know, if you look at, you know, a couple of V's and one of them's orange, one of them's

330
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,480
blue, you're going to think of Chevron, you know, it's that immediate recognition.

331
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,120
But I also think though that tying in all the rest of this is another part of that branding

332
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,120
re-effort.

333
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,120
That's right.

334
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,120
You know what?

335
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,120
You're right.

336
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,120
In certain, in certain circles anyway, cause I bet some people when they see the purple

337
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,280
and black or at least the old purple, I think this new purple is a brighter, bolder one

338
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,880
that's going to really stick out.

339
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,940
But like I would say the old purple and black kind of looked like a sports team.

340
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,260
Is it the Jaguars or something?

341
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:40,440
There's a sports team that has very, or no shit, the Kings here locally are like purple

342
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,440
and white.

343
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,440
Yeah.

344
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,080
Kings are more using the purple and white.

345
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,080
But it depends.

346
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,760
See, it depends what you're into, right?

347
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,760
But maybe Twitch is going with a different shade of purple too, cause it doesn't like

348
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,380
this new purple doesn't look like a sports team.

349
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,380
It's very interesting.

350
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,320
I did notice things are a little brighter.

351
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,320
Yeah.

352
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,240
So anyway, I just thought that was very interesting, the branding and especially you bring that

353
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,240
up like the brand.

354
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,720
Let me go back to the question at hand about should more people be getting into Twitch

355
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,920
or are there too many people in the pool?

356
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,120
Kaijuto says the more, the better.

357
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,120
Let's see.

358
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,780
Fifth Dream says it'd be nice if you could stream and make it look nice without having

359
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,160
to be a fucking wizard in OBS.

360
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,160
Yeah.

361
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,460
This'll be something that they're kind of working on there.

362
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:22,920
So obviously y'all know I'm a big proponent of more people getting their voices out there

363
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,920
and heard.

364
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,920
So yes, absolutely.

365
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,920
I think this is a great thing, but here's the thing.

366
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:35,120
I'm starting to notice a few too many people, including people I would consider good friends

367
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:40,960
of mine and stuff that think that they're going to make oodles of money by streaming

368
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:46,080
on Twitch that like you're going to get all of a sudden all these people are going to

369
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:51,160
show up and you're going to make money just because you play video games online.

370
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,760
And I kind of stick to myself because I feel like I've been down this road before with

371
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,760
podcasting is that people will ask, well, how much do you make by podcasting?

372
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:03,540
Because they think, oh, well, when I listen to RuPaul's podcast, I keep hearing ads for,

373
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,760
you know, new mattress companies.

374
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:06,920
I have a response to that.

375
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,920
How much do you make sitting in your pajamas?

376
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,680
How much do you make when you drive to the park?

377
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,680
Right?

378
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,880
Well, I don't get paid for that.

379
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,200
You do it because you enjoy it, right?

380
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,920
Why do you have to put monetary value on things that give you joy?

381
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,920
Right.

382
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:29,280
So I just, that's my only thing is that I am all for more people getting into Twitch

383
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,060
and streaming.

384
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:35,760
I really would ask somebody, what is your motivation for doing it?

385
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,420
And if your motivation for doing it is that I want to hang out, I want to make some friends

386
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,840
and hang out and play games online.

387
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,840
Cool.

388
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,840
You're doing it for the right reason.

389
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,840
I want to start a community.

390
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,840
Awesome reason.

391
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,920
I want to get my voice out there because I don't feel represented by what's already out

392
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,920
there.

393
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,280
Fucking incredible, amazing reason.

394
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,800
Do it.

395
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,400
But if your reason is I want to make money, just stop, honey, stop.

396
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,400
Don't waste our time.

397
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,400
Well, you'll make money.

398
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,960
It's just, you're going to be disappointed a teeny bit and then everybody else is going

399
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,960
to be disappointed.

400
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,160
You're going to be able to buy that taco, dear.

401
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,560
You'll be able to buy that taco.

402
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:12,560
So you've got to really like ask yourself the motivation and at the end of the day,

403
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:16,560
if your motivation is making community, getting your voice out there, I want to be heard more

404
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,560
than anything else, then yes, do it.

405
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,400
And everybody should be out there doing it.

406
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,360
Kaijuto in chat says, I don't think people think they're going to make a lot of cash.

407
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,080
YouTube streamers broke the fourth wall on that.

408
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,960
Most know it's a little bit.

409
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,960
You'd be a little surprised.

410
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:35,040
Tigerclaw says, what about those that use places like Patreon?

411
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,160
As long as you're not using Kickstarter.

412
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:44,280
Patreon is fine, but I mean, again, you have to do what's best for you.

413
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,800
I would just say don't go into Patreon with the expectation.

414
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:53,920
Oh, if I sign up for a Patreon, I'm going to get $50 a month for sure.

415
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,520
You know, because that may not happen and you're just going to set yourself up for disappointment.

416
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:01,680
Like why are you going to make $50 a month?

417
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,480
That's the number one question to ask yourself.

418
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,480
Why are you going to make that money?

419
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,680
Anyway, let's see, what else do I have here?

420
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:15,680
Oh, I wanted to give a shout out in our chat to TSS Tech Angel, who back in the day, I'm

421
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:20,440
going to call her by her old name, DDR Angel, okay, back in the day, was actually at Twitch

422
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,440
Con.

423
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,080
And I know Angel is a big fan and proponent, I guess, of Twitch.

424
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,200
And she is in chat saying, hey guys, just got back.

425
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,800
I'm freaking exhausted.

426
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,800
It went well.

427
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,560
I gave away all 300 art cards that I'd painted.

428
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,200
Well, I'm super sad I didn't go to get one of those cards, but you know, new job and

429
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,260
everything.

430
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,360
And Angel says, I'm not in it for the money either.

431
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,720
If it happens, sure, but I'm there to enjoy doing what I do.

432
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:47,840
But you know what's awesome, Angel, is like what you just said, you gave away art.

433
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:53,480
You gave away, you didn't just give away art, you gave away 300 pieces of art.

434
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,640
And like that is something I don't think you can put a price on.

435
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,640
You know what I mean?

436
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,080
Like that's awesome.

437
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,240
So congrats and kudos.

438
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,240
That's amazing.

439
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,760
Bobby Blackwolf in chat talking about the money thing saying, I'm part of the local

440
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,280
Twitch streamer meetup group.

441
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,680
I am one of the few people who don't have aspirations of being a full time Twitch streamer.

442
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:16,520
And they think I'm crazy.

443
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:20,160
So anyway, now you're going to laugh because I'm going to say that.

444
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,720
And then at the same token, I'm going to say, but if you want to subscribe here to VOG

445
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,960
Network on Twitch, you can.

446
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,800
Doing so gives you access to the archives and so forth.

447
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,040
And we love the bits and all that stuff.

448
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:36,120
But it's one of those things where we don't expect it.

449
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:41,160
We've been doing this show for how many years, 17 plus?

450
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,480
Now you can see us.

451
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,480
Do we look like we're rolling in cash?

452
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:55,840
No, but we will be using money to buy nominal upgrades and kind of keep our website running

453
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,840
and things like that.

454
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,840
So it's good.

455
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,240
Is this just a facade?

456
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,520
It's really in our mansion that you just don't see.

457
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,080
It's my fucking mansion.

458
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,080
Here's the thing.

459
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,960
I will put it this way.

460
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,000
In the interest transparency, I will say this.

461
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,880
I was paying out of pocket to run VOG before.

462
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,880
And Bobby was too.

463
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,880
It's not just poor me.

464
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:14,920
Bobby was too.

465
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:18,240
We've all put in money here or there or whatever.

466
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,320
But now the nice thing is I'm not paying out of pocket to keep a radio feed running anymore

467
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,960
to deliver this show.

468
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,800
We're able to do that and so forth.

469
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,880
Some of the fees for running a business, and you'd be surprised, it costs money to have

470
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,720
an official business.

471
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:38,480
Some of that money was being fronted by folks, and now your stuff has gone to that a little

472
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,040
bit, which is really nice.

473
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,520
So you know, it all goes to that.

474
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:46,520
Looking in chat, Sia Tabiri in chat says, you guys don't look like you're rolling pennies

475
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,520
though.

476
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,520
Well, it's something we should start doing.

477
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,680
It's because they're all on my nightstand, just like pouring over.

478
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,440
One bit at a time.

479
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,640
Act Def says, I really need to get back to streaming Pokemon Go.

480
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,040
The Twitch Pokemon Go community needs more representatives.

481
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:05,880
Yeah, if you think there's a game that isn't being streamed enough on Twitch, by golly

482
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,880
do it.

483
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,880
This is a True Facts.

484
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:14,640
I was streaming Dragon Quest earlier this week, not Dragon Quest 11, but the original

485
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,640
Dragon Quest.

486
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,880
Because you might remember on last week's show, we talked about the HD remakes are coming

487
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,880
out same day, right?

488
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,880
Right.

489
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,480
So I jumped on that original Dragon Quest game, which of course was Dragon Warrior on

490
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,520
the NES here in the US, but we know that was a regional thing.

491
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,360
So I was streaming that and I was using the Dragon Warrior tag because there was no Dragon

492
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,360
Quest one.

493
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,360
So he's Dragon Warrior.

494
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,240
And somebody brand new found my stream and was like, hey, what do you think of the remake?

495
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,360
I was asking me questions about it and he was like, I can't believe only two people

496
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,920
are streaming this right now.

497
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,960
I follow this tag because I love this game.

498
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,920
He's like, I play this game once a month.

499
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,560
And I'm like, are you speed runner or something?

500
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,520
He's like, no, I just enjoy it.

501
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,780
And I'm like, you know what?

502
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,700
You never know who out there is going to appreciate that thing.

503
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,700
Who would have thought?

504
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:02,060
There's like a Dragon Warrior one hardcore stand out.

505
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,620
There's more than one, I'm sure that really appreciates that stuff.

506
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,940
I would have never known if I hadn't just said, oh, I want to play this cause the HD

507
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,940
remake.

508
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:09,940
And I remember this as a kid.

509
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,940
Maybe it's really cool.

510
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,940
Yeah.

511
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,940
It's pretty cool.

512
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,940
Yeah.

513
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,940
Anyway.

514
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,940
Um, let's see.

515
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:16,940
Was there anything else I wanted to talk about for TwitchCon?

516
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,940
Did I miss anything, uh, on the TwitchCon front?

517
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:21,740
I guess we talked about some of the redesign things and the ad stuff and some of the, it's

518
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,860
going to be like easier to stream.

519
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:26,180
They're going to let you subscribe via mobile, which I guess is kind of cool.

520
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,180
So you can do that.

521
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:33,380
Um, and, uh, some changes coming to like moderator views if you do that and then yeah, the channel

522
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,380
points.

523
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,380
So kind of neat.

524
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:42,420
I was a little bit disappointed though, that they did not give any follow up on the like

525
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:47,140
multi stream or being able to stream with other people, kind of like what Mixer does

526
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:52,620
natively and, um, on Twitch, I think partners can do it, but I was hoping they would roll

527
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,580
that out of the affiliate level and there wasn't anything like that at TwitchCon.

528
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:00,660
So I was a little sad about that, but obviously it's like one of those, this is my wishlist,

529
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,660
my pie in the sky thing.

530
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:05,380
And you know, okay, we didn't get that this time, maybe in the future, who knows?

531
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:12,180
So anyway, um, and Bobby's pointing out how the removal of some tags has really hurt some

532
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:16,220
people saying there used to be a virtual reality tag and that brought me viewers, but they

533
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,220
killed it.

534
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:21,900
The VR streaming community is actually abandoning Twitch over it.

535
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,860
That's been like, I'm trying to remember, like when I was doing streaming for like my

536
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:29,220
live development stuff during that game jam, I had these science and technology cause there's

537
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:35,540
nothing for like coding or game dev or something like that, which is weird.

538
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,540
Now rum, jump, stomp and chat with a fair counterpoint says you can do that.

539
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:44,740
The multi streaming thing with a site called multi Twitch, I recognize that and I respect

540
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,740
that.

541
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,060
However, here's the problem.

542
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:51,220
When it's not natively built into Twitch, this means that you have to go to this multi

543
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:55,580
Twitch thing to be able to view it the way you want to see it, which you can only do

544
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,320
from like a computer, right?

545
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:02,660
But part of what makes Twitch really awesome and part of why I love broadcasting on it

546
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:10,740
is that you can get Twitch on your PC, your Mac, your PlayStation, your Xbox, your mobile,

547
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,740
and so on.

548
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:14,600
You just can't get it on the Switch yet, but you know what I mean?

549
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,840
So you can't do like multi Twitch on mobile, you can't do on PS4.

550
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,200
So whereas it's like, okay, that's a good band-aid.

551
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,260
It's not really giving that full functionality that I'd like to see if that makes sense.

552
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:30,560
So anyway, yeah, everyone jumps, Tom says it isn't as good as native.

553
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,560
I agree.

554
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,560
Yeah.

555
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,560
So we agree on that part.

556
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,680
So anyway, so that's a little bit about TwitchCon.

557
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,600
I hope those of you that went and had a great time and I really look forward to being able

558
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,600
to go next year.

559
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,600
Although I feel like I'm going to be the oldest one there.

560
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:46,560
If I go, Angel, did you see, did you see, are there, are there people on Medicare?

561
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,680
Because they're 65 and older and they're streaming.

562
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:53,800
Do you see, was Wilford Brimley at TwitchCon or am I going to be the oldest one there if

563
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,800
I go?

564
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:59,360
Is that grandma Skyrim one that she's streaming Twitch?

565
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,280
If I go with you, I'll be older than you.

566
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,280
Yes.

567
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:06,280
So whatever.

568
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:10,460
That's you know, one thing I really, really like about DragonCon is that there really

569
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,880
is an age spread.

570
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,440
I mean, yeah, I see a lot of people in their twenties and thirties, but there's quite a

571
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,320
damn lot of people that go to DragonCon that are in their forties and fifties.

572
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,240
And honestly, I think even older than that.

573
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:25,040
So that's another, you know, obviously I'm a huge DragonCon fan at this point, but that

574
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,760
is one real reason I really love that con because you just, you get the spread of everything

575
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,760
there.

576
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,760
So anyway.

577
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,760
All right.

578
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,760
Let's move on.

579
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,760
Enough about TwitchCon.

580
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,120
Let's talk a little bit about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have

581
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,440
been playing this week.

582
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,760
Dark Sakura, you've been gone for a couple of weeks.

583
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,760
How was your gaming week?

584
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,760
What'd you do?

585
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,520
I have been playing a lot of patterned on Apple Arcade.

586
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:51,080
I really, really have been enjoying what I got on Apple Arcade, except there's this one

587
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,120
game that I thought I was going to like.

588
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,240
And so far the beginning of it is just like ridiculously boring.

589
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,960
It's the one that Square Enix did.

590
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,960
Hold on.

591
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,960
I'll get the name of it.

592
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,960
Various Day Life.

593
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,960
Yeah.

594
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,960
I'm kind of bored with it already.

595
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:10,400
But I've been playing patterned and I sort of pinball wizard, which the physics in it

596
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,400
are unique.

597
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,160
I don't really care for it that much.

598
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,360
Is the Apple Arcade thing free if you get a new phone or am I mixing it up with Apple

599
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,360
TV?

600
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,360
Or Apple TV Plus?

601
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,880
Apple TV Plus for a year.

602
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,880
Okay.

603
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,880
I'm mixing it up.

604
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:24,880
Never mind.

605
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,860
Apple Arcade has a one month free trial and after that it's $4.99 a month.

606
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:31,640
But if you've got family sharing, your entire family uses the one sub.

607
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,640
Yeah.

608
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,320
I was going to say, because we talked a little bit about Apple Arcade, I think last week

609
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,320
when you weren't here.

610
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,960
But I was like the $5, that's lower than I was expecting.

611
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,960
I would have thought $10.

612
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,960
So interesting.

613
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:45,920
I really enjoyed Tint and I played a little bit of Sayonara Wild Hearts.

614
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,160
I had a whole thing on that game last week.

615
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,160
I love that game.

616
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,160
It's really pretty.

617
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:54,280
I downloaded Shinsekai and I really am looking forward to playing that.

618
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:59,880
I got Cat Quest 2 and I'm probably, I got Shantae, but now that we've updated my Apple

619
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,040
TV, I'm probably going to be playing it on Apple TV.

620
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:09,120
So if I can get everything set up, I might actually be streaming from my Apple TV.

621
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,120
Why not?

622
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,120
For Apple Arcade stuff.

623
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,680
And then I got Oceanhorn 2, but I've got so many things on my plate.

624
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:20,920
I also went through Detroit Become Human so I could watch The Good Story.

625
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,600
Holy shit.

626
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,840
How come I never touched that game before or never watched anything about it?

627
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,840
That game is fucking amazing.

628
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,440
It took me like two years to find Mass Effect.

629
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,440
No longer than that.

630
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,920
I didn't find Mass Effect until the third game was just about to come out.

631
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:37,160
And then even after I was like, Jamie, play Mass Effect, Jamie, play Mass Effect.

632
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,040
And then finally after nine months, you were like, okay, I'll play Mass Effect, ooh, Garris.

633
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:47,120
Oh, look who has a Tumblr with over 10,000 followers about Mass Effect.

634
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,120
You're welcome.

635
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,240
That I haven't looked at in six months.

636
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,960
I finally let it die.

637
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,600
How interesting observation though, because before we talk about Detroit Become Human,

638
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,640
which I know a lot of people really love that game and people that like don't even play

639
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,040
a lot of games, like when I was doing my little survivor game and meeting people, like there

640
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:05,560
were people like, I don't play a lot of video games, but I love Detroit Become Human.

641
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,840
Like if you have PlayStation 4, you have to play that.

642
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,400
I was like, that's kind of a random one, but sometimes these story driven games are really big.

643
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,400
Oh, it's free now.

644
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,640
So, or it was free.

645
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,680
I think I did grab it during PlayStation Plus.

646
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,680
That's good.

647
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:19,640
But I want to kind of just, just like an observation, we've been doing this segment, the How Was

648
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,120
Your Gaming Week, a very long time.

649
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:27,720
And I can't remember the last time you talked about this many games in your gaming week.

650
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,280
Except for the cons.

651
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,280
Okay.

652
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,680
Well, it's just because like...

653
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:36,440
I'm saying it's a good thing because I'm kind of like, is this because of a subscription

654
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,040
service like Apple Arcade?

655
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,480
Is this like, now that you're at the buffet and you get to try everything, you're just

656
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,480
like...

657
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,360
It's easier for me to do things on my phone until Animal Crossing comes out and I take

658
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,360
the Switch with me.

659
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:52,800
It's just, there really hasn't been a lot that's like sparked my interest that much.

660
00:28:52,800 --> 00:29:01,160
I mean, I'm looking at shit like, okay, okay, okay, you want to give me something that is

661
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:08,120
actually going to be interesting and fascinating for my kind of brain.

662
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:12,840
And the thing I liked about Detroit is the whole psychological aspect to it.

663
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,600
I will admit, I don't think I can do any of the bad playthroughs because they would just

664
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,600
make me sob.

665
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,040
They really would make me sob.

666
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:22,760
I would play it the same way every time.

667
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:28,240
But it was just such a really, really good story and I think that I need more narrative

668
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,720
games like that to really keep me into it.

669
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:40,320
I also went back and watched the Kara demo because I had watched that before and I thought

670
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,600
that was really interesting.

671
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:47,400
And I had interest in that game when they announced it and then I was just sort of like

672
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,560
very blase about my gaming.

673
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:56,200
We did also get Link's Awakening, which Dan has now beat twice, regular mode and hero

674
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,080
mode.

675
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:02,400
And it's cool, it's pretty, I love the music in it.

676
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,520
What do you think about it compared to the Game Boy version?

677
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,480
It doesn't feel like an old game.

678
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,480
It feels like a brand new game.

679
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,480
I lost interest in the Game Boy version really early on, I'll be honest, when it was new.

680
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,480
I didn't enjoy playing it that much.

681
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,320
But I really enjoy this one.

682
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,320
The music is great.

683
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:23,140
It's got the quirkiness and it's made me go back in and do comparisons on things.

684
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:30,040
And even though Totaka didn't work on this game, all of the easter eggs for Totaka's

685
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:33,760
theme from the Japanese version are even in the US one.

686
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:39,400
So if you put in your name as Totakeke, you get the, in fact I put a little video up on

687
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,680
it I think on my Instagram, but you get a jazzy version of it.

688
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:47,420
If you put your name in a Zelda you get like a really jazzy version of the old Legend of

689
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,420
Zelda theme.

690
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:53,380
Then if you go into the Prince's place, he was from a game called The Frog for Whom the

691
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,820
Bell Tolls, rough translation of it.

692
00:30:55,820 --> 00:31:00,420
But if you go into the Prince's house and he's got all the frogs everywhere, if you

693
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:04,380
just hang around there for a little while after all and play Totaka's theme.

694
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,620
I noticed that the mayor from Sim City was in the game.

695
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,620
I was like, which, or Dr. Wright.

696
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,620
Dr. Wright.

697
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,620
Dr. Wright, yeah.

698
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,620
Dr. Wright, yeah.

699
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,340
But who kind of looks like Will Wright actually.

700
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,700
But a little bit.

701
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,140
Will Wright obviously doesn't have green hair.

702
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:20,380
But I was like, wow, it's weird that they put him in that game.

703
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,380
Kirby.

704
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,380
Cool.

705
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,380
Kirby's still there.

706
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,380
Oh really?

707
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,380
Shy guys are still there.

708
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,380
Yeah.

709
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,500
You got the Chain Chomps in there.

710
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:33,900
The thing that's cool is that they have, like in the crane game you get I think other types

711
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:38,220
of figures for Mario enemies.

712
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,220
And you can place them in people's houses.

713
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:43,260
They have like little pots and stands for them.

714
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,980
And that was really cool.

715
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:49,300
And Dan was doing just the fishing game and got a blooper.

716
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,700
I think I put a picture of that up on my Instagram too.

717
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,960
It's almost like Link's Awakening is almost in some ways like a Zelda parody game.

718
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,340
Did you ever watch The Gaming Historian about that one?

719
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,340
No.

720
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:03,700
It's really worth a watch because basically they started off making the game just to see

721
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,460
if it would be possible to make a Legend of Zelda game on the Game Boy.

722
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,660
It was sort of a what if.

723
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,740
And this was like their after hours personal project.

724
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:14,140
And then it actually got the right attention.

725
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,860
They pitched it as a game.

726
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,660
And basically their whole thing was, well, it's on Game Boy.

727
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,660
No one's going to care.

728
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,800
Let's put what we want in it.

729
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,420
That was like literally it.

730
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:30,720
And so like that's why you've got like Kirby's enemies and you have like really weird puzzles.

731
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,540
Like I love the chess puzzles.

732
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:36,020
It's basically if you pick up a knight piece, you have to throw it the way a knight moves

733
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,940
on a chess board.

734
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:40,260
And the puzzles in that one are really creative.

735
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:43,860
You know, just really, really clever.

736
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:47,660
And I like the really cutesy art style.

737
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:52,500
And the other thing that's pretty neat about it too, you know, and I'm not going to spoil

738
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,300
it if no one ever knows how that game is supposed to end.

739
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,540
And if you do, then whatever.

740
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,920
It's a, you know, old game.

741
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,920
I don't care.

742
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,180
I'm not still going to spoil it.

743
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:07,540
But the art styles, it kind of does to me this, like with the intro video and then the

744
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:13,640
ending video, it almost has a kind of Wizard of Oz vibe to me in the changes in the art

745
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,680
style.

746
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,480
I'll leave it at that.

747
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:22,160
It's like you've transitioned from one aspect of the story to the other and back.

748
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,920
So I really enjoyed it.

749
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,600
Toad's in the game, of course, but he doesn't.

750
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,240
Not Toad, Wart.

751
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,240
He doesn't get by Wart.

752
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,240
And the singing is absolutely terrible.

753
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,240
I love it.

754
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,640
It was very well done.

755
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,360
I was very happy with it.

756
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,000
And I loved going around finding the Easter eggs.

757
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
And then I cried about the ghost.

758
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,040
It was just sad.

759
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:48,680
And I like when you can throw the monkeys out of the trees because they're assholes.

760
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:52,760
So you played this game very thoroughly in the past couple of weeks.

761
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:56,320
Dan mostly did, because he wanted to go through hero mode.

762
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:03,480
So but sometimes you need your wife there saying, you need to look at the map.

763
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,220
Backseat driving, basically.

764
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:08,560
We're turning this link around.

765
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,600
So and I mean, I've been doing my usual Animal Crossing.

766
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,160
I finally got my levels high enough in idle pouring to rebirth.

767
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:20,640
And now I can't beat fucking Osiris to do the rebirth.

768
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:21,640
So like, whatever.

769
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,540
So I have to keep leveling so I can rebirth.

770
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:29,280
So I'm actually getting really tired of playing that game, and I'm probably not going to renew

771
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,920
my sub after it expires.

772
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:36,560
I'm just getting really tired of it.

773
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:44,720
I've been doing Pokemon and Harry Potter and oh, but patterned to me is one of the

774
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,700
best games on Apple TV, not Apple TV, but Apple Arcade.

775
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,700
It is absolutely.

776
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:49,700
What are you doing this game?

777
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,700
It's a puzzle game?

778
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:54,480
It's a puzzle game, but it's kind of unique.

779
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:00,720
It's a tiled, you know, like wallpaper, like a tiled picture where it's seamless, right?

780
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:07,240
But when you get the picture, it sketches, and you have different cut out pieces that

781
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,920
match the different parts of the sketch.

782
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,960
And as you move that piece in, it fills in color and it gets more and more opaque, the

783
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:19,760
more and more pieces that you bring in until you finish the whole piece.

784
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,480
And I actually put video up somewhere.

785
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,400
I will see if I can find that video.

786
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,900
I'll put it up on my Instagram and link it in chat.

787
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:33,020
So just like, you know, an example of moving a piece and so you can see what it looks like.

788
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,940
So I'll put that up in just a few minutes.

789
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:39,640
But yeah, that's been that's kind of like for me, my shining star, that and Tint, which

790
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:44,140
is another puzzle game where you start off with your primary colors, but you have to

791
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:48,420
mix them through one other color and get to your gold that matches this little flower

792
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,760
that's going to bloom and take on the next piece of the puzzle.

793
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:55,940
So it's using primary colors to create secondary colors, but sometimes you have to avoid another

794
00:35:55,940 --> 00:36:01,780
color because if you cross a second color, it'll turn that mud gray color when you've

795
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,080
oversaturated.

796
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,160
So it's it's a pretty neat little game.

797
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,260
So those two are like probably my shining stars for Apple Arcade right now.

798
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,260
OK, great.

799
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,260
All right.

800
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:13,140
Well, you had a very busy past couple weeks.

801
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,600
Mine was not mine was not nearly as busy.

802
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,740
I'm drinking out of underwear, OK?

803
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:21,280
Oh, I grabbed a cup and I was like, oh, this is a niche.

804
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,280
It's underwear.

805
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,860
You can show it on the Twitch stream for our folks that are watching there.

806
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,600
I don't remember where that came from.

807
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,860
I think it was like a joke gift that that Alan got or something.

808
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:31,860
I don't remember.

809
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:32,860
It says Pansu.

810
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,860
Yeah.

811
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:34,860
All right.

812
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,100
Loki, how was your gaming week?

813
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:44,420
Well, I did also play Legend of Zelda Link's Awakening, not because I was like actually

814
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:49,780
playing is because my son won my my youngest son's been playing it and I've been helping

815
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:53,420
him with the parts that he can't do, which means I've played through like the dungeons

816
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,420
basically.

817
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,420
It's fun.

818
00:36:55,420 --> 00:37:00,320
I'm noticing a lot of slowdown, though, as everyone's kind of pointed out.

819
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,180
But it's a decent game.

820
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:07,140
So it'd be fun to actually go back and play it on my own at some point.

821
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:10,380
The game, though, I did play on my own was Untitled Goose Game.

822
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:14,420
So I did finish that and then got the second set of challenges.

823
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,540
And I'm like halfway through those.

824
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:20,340
But there's some that I get the speed run, which I'm like, what do you think?

825
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:23,020
Because I feel like everybody has gotten around to playing this game except for me.

826
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:26,420
Like Bobby did it by Bobby did a live stream this week.

827
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:29,420
And Shane has been telling me I need to play this game, but I just I just didn't get around

828
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,420
to it.

829
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,500
I've had a lot of other stuff going on.

830
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,500
It's really fun.

831
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,500
Yeah.

832
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,500
Yeah.

833
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,500
Why?

834
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,500
Why?

835
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,500
Because you're a complete asshole to everybody.

836
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,980
And then once you get done with the game, you find out that the whole objective of the

837
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:44,780
game is just being a complete asshole.

838
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:48,060
And that's that's just like the best part of that.

839
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:50,700
Apparently, it is still 15 bucks.

840
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:54,100
And this may be the reason I make an epic account.

841
00:37:54,100 --> 00:38:03,780
Well, it's also on sale on on the switch, which I can play on my Mac.

842
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:08,420
But yeah, so it's fun to be an asshole to everybody in the town.

843
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,260
It's great that on the back of the box and it's great to be an asshole.

844
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:15,900
It's great because like you just like like the way the goose looks at people and stuff

845
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:20,300
and the way people like look frustrated at it and you're just like.

846
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:26,180
What the fuck you want, you know, honk exactly like what the fuck you want.

847
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:30,780
So basically, can we just download a new skin for the goose that is just Mr. Smoosh?

848
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:35,060
Because I feel like there's lots of other asshole animals that would work very well

849
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,060
in this game.

850
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,060
Yes.

851
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,060
It's an excellent game.

852
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,060
So I have a lot of fun.

853
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:43,180
It is a very long game, but it's fun because you can kind of do whatever you want in there,

854
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:46,940
especially when you get later on into the game and you have some of those new challenges

855
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:50,980
that open up once you finish the game that require you to use stuff that's kind of not

856
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,220
specific to a certain level.

857
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:56,340
You see it to kind of move around the whole map and it kind of changes things up.

858
00:38:56,340 --> 00:39:03,460
Plus the last mission of it, it's like you'd be very stealthy because you have a, you know,

859
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,460
some spoil.

860
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:05,460
Yeah.

861
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:08,160
You're making lots of noise and everybody's out to look for you now.

862
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:13,440
So it's, it's kind of like a little Metal Gear Solid action going on there, but, um,

863
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:18,220
I had, I had quite a bit of fun playing the game, so I hope that there's more at some

864
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:23,560
point and, um, I really hope that, uh, I actually get around to finishing it.

865
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:28,360
I don't know what the very, very last objective is, but I know the speed running ones are

866
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,360
gonna be hard.

867
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,360
All right.

868
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,360
That's it.

869
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,360
That's it.

870
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,360
All right.

871
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,360
My gaming week.

872
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,360
Not as exciting as everyone else's.

873
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:38,760
I didn't really get around to doing new stuff cause I was still playing the good old, uh,

874
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:41,040
mobile games like Pokemon Go and Ingress.

875
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:45,140
There's going to be a very interesting week in Ingress because Scanner redacted the old

876
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,140
version of the app.

877
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:50,540
The one that many people are still clinging to after all this time, uh, closes tomorrow

878
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:53,480
and they, they say they really are pulling the plug on redacted tomorrow.

879
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,760
So you're going to have to use Ingress primes.

880
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:58,640
It's going to be very interesting to see because a lot of people are threatening to quit with

881
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,640
that.

882
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:03,120
So I don't, we'll see what happens if people really do quit or they just need to scratch

883
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,560
the itch of taking over their neighborhood park or what.

884
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,620
So I'll be very curious to see where that game is in about a week, especially with a

885
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:11,840
big event coming up right here in Sacramento on the 12th.

886
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,720
So that will only be playable in the new scanner, which is interesting.

887
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,720
Hmm.

888
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,720
Uh, so there's that.

889
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,040
Uh, otherwise I've been continuing on in classic wow.

890
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,040
Uh, believe it.

891
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,560
I'm still playing classic world of Warcraft.

892
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,680
My priest is up to level 20 or yeah, 21.

893
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,120
I did a dead minds run on Saturday.

894
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:32,640
Now here's the thing, like now if you play retail wow and you do the dead minds, you'll

895
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,640
get through it.

896
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,400
And like 15 minutes, like you just, you pull your face, pull everything.

897
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,400
It's super easy.

898
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,400
Right?

899
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,400
Oh my God.

900
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,400
Classic.

901
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,400
Wow.

902
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,400
Is a humble reminder of really how much the game has changed, especially when it comes

903
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,800
to like quality of life, things like having a fucking map to get you through the dungeon

904
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:54,440
or not having to wait for the priest to drink after every single fight because she's out

905
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,080
of manna, which was happening to me all the time.

906
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:02,560
It took us, I shit you not two hours to get through dead minds, but I remember back in

907
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,040
the, I remember running that.

908
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:07,880
Dead minds is the very first instance, like group thing you do in world of Warcraft.

909
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:11,680
And I remember years ago, back in the day, that's how long it took.

910
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,900
Like that was your evening.

911
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,020
That was your D and D campaign for the night.

912
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,480
We're going to go to the dead minds.

913
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,480
Who needs to raid?

914
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,480
I know.

915
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,480
Right.

916
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,480
So that was.

917
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,480
Yeah.

918
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,480
Anyhow.

919
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:29,840
Um, so, uh, yeah, uh, that was a nice little humble taste of what things used to be like

920
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,120
and well, but it's interesting because I was doing that.

921
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,480
And then I was like, maybe I should go back and play a little retail.

922
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,480
Wow.

923
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:39,360
But I still really love my other MMO final fantasy 14.

924
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:44,440
And I'm up to level, I don't know, like 75 or something like that.

925
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,880
So yeah.

926
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,060
I'm almost max level on two different job classes.

927
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,060
So that's really fun.

928
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,060
Yeah.

929
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:57,720
Otherwise that's, I haven't, Oh, I've been playing a little bit of Diablo three on switch.

930
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,840
Very random.

931
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:03,480
But do you know, I've never played a necromancer in Diablo three and I finally did on the switch

932
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,300
version because I never bought that PC upgrade.

933
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:09,520
I said I wasn't going to, because I didn't want them putting out a half-assed expansion

934
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,520
and I never did.

935
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,980
But then of course I like quadruple dipped on Diablo three.

936
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:16,140
So w wait for me to show him a lesson, huh?

937
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:20,440
So I've, I picked that up and, uh, uh, on switch, I had bought it a while ago, but I

938
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,440
was picking it up and playing it again.

939
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,440
I was like, I should do a necromancer for this season.

940
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:28,360
So it's like the first time I'm finally playing that class and a exploding corpses is fun.

941
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,240
That's what necromancers do.

942
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,240
Explode corpses.

943
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,240
All right.

944
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,240
Yay.

945
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,240
Yay.

946
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,240
So that's, that's pretty much my gaming week.

947
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,360
So we'll move on and get into some gaming news.

948
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,360
Some housekeeping.

949
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:43,640
Uh, I don't think we're going to be here pretty much every week, but we will not have a show

950
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,640
live.

951
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:50,160
I, I have to talk to my lovely co-hosts about taping something during the week in advance,

952
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:57,240
but we will not have a show live the week of October 20th.

953
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:00,960
And we won't have one live the week of November.

954
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,080
I think it's night.

955
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:06,640
Uh, those dates may not be exact, uh, reason why I had a work thing come up at the end

956
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,640
of October.

957
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,640
So I'm not going to be here.

958
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,600
Uh, and, uh, November is my trip to New York.

959
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,260
I'm going to go see Broadway plays.

960
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:15,720
So on when OLR would usually be on, I'm going to go see Moulin Rouge.

961
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,120
I'm really excited about it.

962
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:21,500
So anyway, uh, yeah, so we'll do some, uh, tapes in it because that worked really well

963
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:25,120
last time when we did our show, like earlier in the week and then we, um, just premiered

964
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,120
it on Sunday.

965
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:31,660
Something like that again for you guys, but then episode 800 is like when we're back.

966
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:36,640
So the next live shot really close to 20 November actually will be episode 800.

967
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,640
So that'll be fun.

968
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,760
So, all right, let's get into some gaming news for this week.

969
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,280
Loki, why don't you start us off?

970
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,280
All right.

971
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,840
So there was the whole PlayStation state of play event that they did online.

972
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,120
So you could definitely watch that.

973
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:54,960
Um, that is pretty much the last of us part two show because they had a, you know, basically

974
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,560
a big rundown talking about the last of us part two, which is going to be coming out

975
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:05,240
February 21st, 2020, um, along with that, some other stuff that is going to be coming

976
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:10,520
civilization six and, um, yeah, I love six, six, six.

977
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:13,080
So that's coming to the PlayStation four in November 22nd.

978
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:16,960
I guess I didn't realize it wasn't on play cause it came out on switch and I was like,

979
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:17,960
that's weird.

980
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:21,760
They're doing a console release of six, six, six, six was on switch and it was kind of

981
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:22,760
a big deal when it happened.

982
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:26,680
Cause I was like, they're putting six, six on consoles, but, uh, well they put it on

983
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,200
the iPad too, to be fair.

984
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,760
So I guess consoles make sense.

985
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,760
Um, so yeah, it's, it's on a switch and now PS4 and I was like, Oh yeah, I guess it would

986
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:38,600
make sense that if you put it on switch, you probably would just, you know, make it for

987
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,720
PlayStation four.

988
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:40,720
Where's the Xbox one version?

989
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,760
Cause that seems very likely that's going to happen too.

990
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:43,760
Who knows?

991
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:50,400
Coming to the pipeline, I guess, um, they release a demo for the remake of MediEvil.

992
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,480
So you can check that out now and if you play it, which Jason said he was going to

993
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,480
do in the intro.

994
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,480
Yes.

995
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,120
You can get a game for the, or a special item for the full game.

996
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:04,880
If you actually finish that with, um, before the game comes out next month, um, Death Stranding,

997
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:10,000
they announced a pro bundle that's coming out November 8th that has like a hand print

998
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,120
design on it that looks like I could have just taken my hand and put it in paint and

999
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:18,960
just went, I don't know why you've waiting this long to get a PlayStation four if this

1000
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,280
game is of interest to you, but shoot yourself.

1001
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,280
Maybe it's a collectible.

1002
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,280
I don't know.

1003
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,280
Sure.

1004
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:29,160
Uh, they had this game called humanity, uh, which I heard people comparing it to intelligent

1005
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:35,260
cube, but I didn't really see that other than, you know, kind of, it's weird though.

1006
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:38,880
It's a weird looking game where they basically have like crowds of people that you have to

1007
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,960
kind of shuffle through to certain areas and they could fight each other.

1008
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,040
And I don't know, it's really weird, but I like those weird puzzle games.

1009
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:51,520
So that's coming out in 2020, uh, there's a game called the rise, a simple story, which

1010
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,960
is an adventure game, um, coming soon, LA noir.

1011
00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:01,000
The VR case files are coming out for PlayStation VR, which I'm surprised that hasn't come out

1012
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
before.

1013
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,360
Um, and then they also showed off some other stuff, uh, coming out to PlayStation VR, including

1014
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:10,880
space channel five, kind of funky, uh, newsflash.

1015
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:11,880
Can't wait.

1016
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:12,880
Yep.

1017
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:19,160
And after the fall and aspire one, and then let's see what else, uh, the PlayStation plus

1018
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:25,360
lineup for October is going to be MLB, the show 19 and the last of us remastered to get

1019
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:28,160
you all ready for last of us too.

1020
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,160
Well, yeah.

1021
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:36,480
Um, and then finally there was one Tom, which is a new game from the creators of Katamari

1022
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:42,040
Damacy and he's unretired for not making playground anymore.

1023
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,520
I have no fucking clue what you do in this game.

1024
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:45,520
I watched the trailer.

1025
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,040
I'm like, I don't know what you do in this game.

1026
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:52,400
I looked like more like a nobody, nobody boy than Katamari.

1027
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:58,920
Um, I did see flying golden poops and someone vomited the rainbows, so it already looks

1028
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,960
like a game I'm going to check out.

1029
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:01,960
Yeah, this is something I'm into.

1030
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:05,600
I know dark soccer is going to play this, has to play because the Katamari Damacy, nobody,

1031
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:06,600
nobody boy.

1032
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:07,600
Those like two of your favorite games.

1033
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:13,680
Well, nobody, nobody boy on iOS was, I didn't play it too much on the console.

1034
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,160
Same, same.

1035
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,400
It just looks weird.

1036
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,640
And I dig that.

1037
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,160
A comment on a what I'm in our chat room.

1038
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:25,360
Uh, Dr Tuya says over at twitch TV slash vog network, though that what I'm game sounds

1039
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,920
all about as crazy as Katamari in those games.

1040
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:28,920
Nobody nobody boy.

1041
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,240
And I think there was another one.

1042
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:35,440
Um, I don't remember if there was another, there may have been, there were several Katamari

1043
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:36,440
games.

1044
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:37,560
Mobile game.

1045
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,640
Nobody, nobody boy was the mobile game at first.

1046
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,000
I thought there was another mobile.

1047
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:47,240
There might've been, I forget a lot of people also think that a donut game is them.

1048
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:48,800
No, that's totally different.

1049
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:49,800
Yeah.

1050
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,760
It's similar to Katamari, but except it's very linear.

1051
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:58,400
So it's, it's not, I wouldn't say it's the same feel as Katamari cause there's no time

1052
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,040
limits or anything like that.

1053
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:05,240
Um, but I don't know, I was trying to see if there was another game that I'm missing

1054
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,240
here.

1055
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:13,720
Glitch was a game that he worked on in 2011 and then he had a tenure or tenure Wanya teens

1056
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:14,720
and alphabet.

1057
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:18,280
He was a designer on what is glitch.

1058
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:22,720
Um, a comment quickly on the civ six issue from a metal mayhem in our chat over at twitch

1059
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:26,880
TV slash vog network, metal mayhem says, may as well put civ six on consoles.

1060
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,280
After all, not everyone is a PC gamer.

1061
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,280
True.

1062
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:33,120
And the civ games are great and should get out to as many people as possible.

1063
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,120
So why not?

1064
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,120
Yeah.

1065
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,120
All right.

1066
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:39,520
Well, if that's it for the, uh, what'd you think overall of PlayStation's a state of

1067
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,520
play update?

1068
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,520
I thought it was okay.

1069
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,520
Yeah.

1070
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:47,880
Apparently the creator of, uh, Katamari he's, um, he moved to San Francisco.

1071
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:48,880
Yeah.

1072
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:49,880
I heard that too.

1073
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:50,880
Living there.

1074
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:51,880
Yeah.

1075
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:52,880
He lives in San Francisco.

1076
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:53,880
Cool.

1077
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:54,880
He has an open invite to come on the show.

1078
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:55,880
Anytime.

1079
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:56,880
We're only a two hour drive away.

1080
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:57,880
Keita Takahashi.

1081
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:58,880
Yeah.

1082
00:48:58,880 --> 00:48:59,880
All right.

1083
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:00,880
Anyhow.

1084
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:01,880
Uh, let's move on.

1085
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:06,040
This is going to be seemed like really random as a follow up to a PlayStation state of play,

1086
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:10,720
but this is like one of those, like, what the hell, what, what kind of romper room fuckery

1087
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:14,240
is this going on in the gaming industry up in here on this day?

1088
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,240
Okay.

1089
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:21,800
So this has to do with the classic eighties gaming icon, Ms. Pac-Man, not to be confused

1090
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:27,000
with Pac-Man specifically this drama centers around Ms. Pac-Man.

1091
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:32,240
Now there's a nice little summary on what's going on here from Twitter users, Sarah S

1092
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:36,360
sour tea, and I'm reading some of the summary there directly from her Twitter, where it

1093
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:42,240
says, um, uh, in summary at games wanted Ms. Pac-Man.

1094
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,720
So at games, at games, make some of those like flashback type content.

1095
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:49,280
Didn't they do the old Genesis things too?

1096
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,280
Maybe I think so.

1097
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,400
So they, they, they do retro hardware type stuff.

1098
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,760
Like that's like their bread and butter.

1099
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,760
Okay.

1100
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,880
At games wanted Ms. Pac-Man.

1101
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,000
Didn't get it because it's complicated.

1102
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:05,480
Went to make a deal with GCC who owns the rights to Ms. Pac-Man and claim they 100%

1103
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:07,280
have those rights to distributors.

1104
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,600
And maybe they do.

1105
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:09,600
Maybe they don't.

1106
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:10,600
An exciting story.

1107
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,600
Yeah.

1108
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:15,580
At games actually put out a press release through PR news wires.

1109
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:20,880
So this was on September 26 where at game, it says at games cloud holdings, a leader

1110
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,740
in interactive entertainment announced that it has acquired all the rights of general

1111
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:30,880
computer corporation, GCC with respect to Ms. Pac-Man's under agreement between GCC

1112
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,640
and Bandai Namco.

1113
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:37,440
So here's, I guess what it sounds like is that at games wanted to go to Bandai Namco

1114
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,440
to do it.

1115
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:39,760
And they were like, no.

1116
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:45,880
So they went to this GCC general computer corporation who in the text here in their,

1117
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:51,440
in their own press release, Mac game says GCC developed in 1981, certain source code

1118
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:57,440
characters, music, gameplay, and cartoons expressed in various media, including, but

1119
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:04,080
not limited to read only memory ROM used in running Ms. Pac-Man and pack baby sold as

1120
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:09,920
junior Pac-Man games in 1983, GCC entered into an agreement with the predecessor of

1121
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:15,640
Bandai Namco with regard to Ms. Pac-Man, which was later amended in 2008 in an agreement

1122
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:20,540
with Bandai Namco and the former shareholders of GCC who become the successors in interest

1123
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:22,480
to GCC after its dissolution.

1124
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,080
If it sounds messy, it's because it is.

1125
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:30,240
So this is essentially says Bandai Namco said, no, they went to the company who helped make

1126
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:35,440
the ROMs of the original game and did like coding and they got it from them.

1127
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:39,040
And because, Oh, they have the license because what does at games do?

1128
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:41,440
They do these retro game devices, right?

1129
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:46,120
So if they get the rights through these retro coding, you know, the code and the actual

1130
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:50,640
like physical, and I guess, you know, the intellectual code and stuff.

1131
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:55,000
Now they're saying they own the rights, but hold on here.

1132
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:00,320
The CEO of at games, I'm sorry if I mispronounced this name, Dr. Ping Kang Seung.

1133
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,320
I hope I said that right.

1134
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:05,920
I'm sorry if I didn't says as part of our ongoing initiative to be caretakers of important

1135
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:10,660
cultural touchstones, we are privileged to gain these valuable rights pertaining to the

1136
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:14,380
iconic Ms. Pac-Man arcade game.

1137
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:20,140
Now you want to see, you want to hear how things get even messier.

1138
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:29,120
From gamesindustry.biz on the 25th of September, plug and play game maker at games is facing

1139
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,180
another partner in court.

1140
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:36,280
In addition to a trademark infringement from Bandai Namco over Ms. Pac-Man, the company

1141
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:42,240
is embroiled in a lawsuit from Walgreens, the U S pharmacy chains, Walgreens, Walgreens

1142
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:46,480
filed suit against at games for breach of contract in August, saying it had a deal with

1143
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:51,600
the game company that provided products on a guaranteed sale basis, meaning at games

1144
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:57,120
would take any unsold units back and refund the chain, whatever it paid them.

1145
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:01,880
In addition for an additional fee and shipping costs, Walgreens said it returned more than

1146
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:08,600
66,500 units for which it had paid between $15 and $38.

1147
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,760
But at games refused to make payment.

1148
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:16,760
As a result, Walgreens, Walgreens claimed it owed nearly 1.62 million from the company.

1149
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:19,840
Again, that story from gamesindustry.biz, if you want to see some of the quotes.

1150
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:23,640
Is this going to end up where Walgreens owns Ms. Pac-Man at some point?

1151
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:24,640
Is this where we're in?

1152
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:25,640
Is this where it's going?

1153
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:27,400
I don't know, but this is weird.

1154
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:30,800
It's certainly like, it seems I am inferring.

1155
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:36,280
I'm not saying this as fact, but in my opinion, and my opinion does not represent those of

1156
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,320
VOG Network or my co-hosts.

1157
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:41,080
It sounds like this at games company is a little bit shady.

1158
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:45,880
It just, I'm getting that impression from the fact that they are, mommy said no, so

1159
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:50,720
we're going to go ask daddy and this whole, they're not paying Walgreens for this.

1160
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,440
They made some weird deal with Walgreens.

1161
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:54,160
I don't know guys.

1162
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:59,480
It's allegedly sounds crazy.

1163
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:03,120
Dark Titsy in chat says, yeah, this whole thing is nuts.

1164
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:05,880
Snuck in futs.

1165
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:06,880
Exactly.

1166
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,960
Which is a good beer by the way.

1167
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:09,960
Yeah.

1168
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:13,880
And by the way, there's another Twitter thread from user Sean Musgrave, who's talking about

1169
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:20,260
the real ass drama going on with at games and the way Sean puts it on Twitter.

1170
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:23,640
They've been pestering Namco for ages for the Ms. Pac-Man license and Namco's turned

1171
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:29,240
them down because of the complicated royalty structures and ownership of that game.

1172
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:33,240
That's interesting to point out too, is that a character like Ms. Pac-Man, it isn't so

1173
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:34,240
cut and dry.

1174
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:38,760
We're like Namco Bando owns this because it does get complicated.

1175
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:39,760
Doesn't it?

1176
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:44,760
Because didn't like Midway or something published that in the U S at one point, like it, it

1177
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:50,640
gets weird when it comes to Ms. Pac-Man because in the eighties video games were just kind

1178
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,120
of like done differently.

1179
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:54,280
I don't know how else to explain it.

1180
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:57,960
And so all the deals that were in place were sometimes very straight.

1181
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:59,760
Let's just say what it was.

1182
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:03,460
The games industry was on a lot of cocaine in the 1980s.

1183
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:05,760
And I mean a fucking lot of cocaine.

1184
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:06,760
Okay.

1185
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:10,760
If you watch any documentary about how your favorite Atari Atari games in the 1980s were

1186
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:13,520
made, cocaine was probably involved.

1187
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:14,880
Winners don't use drugs.

1188
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:15,880
Remember that.

1189
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:20,120
However, remember the video game industry crashed under the weight of all that cocaine.

1190
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:22,440
So right.

1191
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,440
Am I wrong?

1192
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:24,440
Did I tell any lies?

1193
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:25,440
No, I did not.

1194
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:34,400
So a lot of these, a lot of these deals, cocaine infused deals are really, really strange.

1195
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:41,600
And that's how 5,000 people claim ownership to Ms. Pac-Man anyway, Namco is in discussions

1196
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:45,220
with GCC who developed Ms. Pac-Man trying to buy them out.

1197
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:49,080
So they'd be the full owners of Ms. Pac-Man full stop, but at games went around Namco's

1198
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:52,040
back and was directly negotiated with GCC.

1199
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:55,960
Namco confronted at games about this and they deny it.

1200
00:55:55,960 --> 00:56:00,080
Namco is unable to verify if at games has or hasn't bought the rights from GCC.

1201
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:03,200
That was two days before the at games press release when that tweet was written.

1202
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:07,680
So I think we know if at games is saying there now.

1203
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,680
So this is, but here's the thing, and this is why I bring this up.

1204
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:13,140
Like sure, it's drama and it's LOL.

1205
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:14,200
This is crazy.

1206
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,200
And what the fuck?

1207
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:19,480
But here's the reality, boys and girls.

1208
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:25,020
How are we going to see Ms. Pac-Man in a retro collection ever again?

1209
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:27,440
Because of these damn rights issues.

1210
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:33,120
And I'll point out, I know I was talking about that Mortal Kombat machine an awful lot last

1211
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:37,360
week, the little mini game, which is at games that do these.

1212
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,240
This is not at games that do these, basic fun.

1213
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:41,360
So it's a completely different company that does these.

1214
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:46,760
But I didn't show off this one because I kind of whatevered it last week.

1215
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:49,440
But there's also a regular Pac-Man machine, right?

1216
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:53,840
There's a regular Pac-Man machine that they put out as well with this full color screen,

1217
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:56,880
fancy, fancy, all this stuff that they have, right?

1218
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,480
Is that the company?

1219
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,480
No.

1220
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:07,280
But Ms. Pac-Man is there too.

1221
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,380
I even forgot they did this one, but I don't think this one is as good.

1222
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:13,580
And I think, oh, these guys, I'm trying to see if they have a relationship.

1223
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:14,580
Yes.

1224
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:18,060
Ms. Pac-Man Bandai Namco Entertainment, Inc.

1225
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:21,200
So they got the agreements for that one.

1226
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,740
But it's interesting that that company could do it.

1227
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:25,860
And it was easy.

1228
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:29,700
But at games is having such crazy difficulty with it.

1229
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:32,500
It's weird.

1230
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:39,260
Anyway, looking in chat, Tiger Class says, what about that arcade one up TMNT arcade

1231
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:40,260
cabinet?

1232
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:43,540
You must have jumped through many hoops to be able to put that out.

1233
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:48,580
Yeah, well, I mean, the Ninja Turtles arcade game, when it came out on Xbox 360, that was

1234
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:51,940
a pleasant surprise because the rights were very complicated.

1235
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:53,420
Rights have a way of working themselves out.

1236
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:59,500
And also, also the Avengers and Capcom, or didn't they have like the whole like Avengers

1237
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:04,300
cabinet and Marvel versus Capcom?

1238
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:06,380
It was X-Men Street Fighter, was it?

1239
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:08,500
I don't remember what they had, but they had one.

1240
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:12,740
They had like a bunch of those in there, like Marvel stuff.

1241
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:15,300
So obviously, I imagine the rights were complicated for that, too.

1242
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:20,300
The point is rights issues will screw up all of the games that you loved in the past because

1243
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:22,740
contracts were signed under the influence of drugs.

1244
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:23,740
All right.

1245
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:24,740
That's my point.

1246
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:29,460
That means that they technically shouldn't be binding because anything signed under influence

1247
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:31,340
can be considered a non-binding contract.

1248
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:32,340
OK.

1249
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:36,260
Guess where I can have a rights free utopia out there.

1250
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:38,460
It's called the Internet.

1251
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:39,460
Thank you.

1252
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:40,460
Piracy.

1253
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:41,460
I may also be...

1254
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:42,460
That's what art thieves can do.

1255
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:43,700
Kiss my ass.

1256
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:50,100
I may also be slightly exaggerating a thing or two about the 1980s game industry.

1257
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:52,680
Just a little bit.

1258
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:53,680
Let's move on.

1259
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:57,300
Speaking, speaking of things from the past, blast from the past, right, Dark Sakura?

1260
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:58,300
Yeah.

1261
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:01,740
You know me and prototypes and retro shit.

1262
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:07,700
So the Nintendo 64, of course, had quite the unique controller, right?

1263
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:15,700
Still to this day, like, it hurts if you fall on it just the right way where the bottom

1264
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:20,940
part pokes into your ribs and then the cat looks at you while you're rolling around in

1265
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:21,940
pain.

1266
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:23,860
Sorry, that was a very recent experience.

1267
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:29,900
So anyway, when this was still known, when the Nintendo 64 was still known as the Ultra

1268
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:35,100
64, there were, of course, prototype controllers that were going around.

1269
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:36,820
The controller didn't have like a name.

1270
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:39,780
It was just a controller.

1271
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:49,500
And so a video game preservationist called Shane Batty actually found a prototype controller

1272
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:53,300
and shared pictures of it on a Twitter thread.

1273
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:56,180
Which I actually prepared that for our Twitch folks tonight.

1274
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:57,180
Look at you.

1275
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:58,180
Look at me up in my game.

1276
00:59:58,180 --> 00:59:59,180
Gold star.

1277
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:02,500
Gold star, Rob.

1278
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:09,220
But as you can see in it, the prototype and the final one, a little bit bigger, you know,

1279
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:10,380
a little bit different.

1280
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:14,380
That thumb pad, you see how much bigger that is on there?

1281
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:15,820
Oh yeah.

1282
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:24,580
You know, and people were saying actually that it's a lot more comfortable to use.

1283
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:30,700
And don't know why they opted out of it, but you know, there's actually a picture of that

1284
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:33,460
thumb pad removed from it.

1285
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:34,460
Don't think I captured that.

1286
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:35,460
Hold on.

1287
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:39,540
Um, because I will copy the image and paste it in chat.

1288
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:45,660
But for our Twitch or for our podcast people, that's not going to help, sadly.

1289
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:46,660
Yeah.

1290
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:53,500
But, um, but at any rate, um, uh, the, uh, it's just got like a different, hold on it.

1291
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:59,260
When you look at the two side by side, it actually looks to me like the controller is

1292
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:05,500
a little bit narrower, but it seems to me that it's a little bit more comfortable.

1293
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:11,140
It did keep a lot of the button design, you know, as far as the layout for the buttons,

1294
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:16,580
but I think that the, normally the green and blue button, which are massive, were a little

1295
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:19,660
bit smaller in this prototype and all like sort of flat.

1296
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:27,500
They seemed like the six buttons are more in line where the, um, the controller that

1297
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:31,880
we got has those three, sorry, the four yellow buttons and sort of a diamond.

1298
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:36,940
They don't quite line up the, these line up more like a six button control.

1299
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:37,940
Yeah.

1300
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:38,940
Yeah.

1301
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:39,940
It looks like a six button configuration in this.

1302
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:42,100
I mean, honestly, I think it's really comfortable.

1303
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:48,700
I would love for this dude to like market that design or whoever now can market that

1304
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:55,880
design so that, you know, we would be able to, um, uh, that we would be able to use something

1305
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:58,160
like that for our, our old machines.

1306
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:02,580
It's weird that it's taken this long for a prototype like that to unveil itself.

1307
01:02:02,580 --> 01:02:04,080
You know, it's been years, right?

1308
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:09,120
If you want to look in the chat right now, Rob, there's a picture I, um, I put posted

1309
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:10,120
in there.

1310
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:13,020
That's the thumb pad pulled out.

1311
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:17,140
And I think that, um, I linked it in there for everyone to see, but it's just interesting

1312
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:23,400
how just, just a small little unit on here, but it, it has like a deeper recess as well

1313
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:29,920
instead of the more, uh, what's the word I'm thinking of, uh, convex shape.

1314
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:33,680
It's a little bit more concave.

1315
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:36,040
So do you think this was the better controller?

1316
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:39,220
Would you like to be able to play your N64 games with this controller or?

1317
01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:42,280
I'd much rather.

1318
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:44,860
Maybe maybe a third party will be controlled.

1319
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:45,860
Probably not.

1320
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:49,320
Cause this console is how old at this point, I guess it's a, it's definitely an artifact

1321
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:50,560
of many, many years ago.

1322
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:56,120
No, no, just because that may be the case, you know, all it takes for them to do is release

1323
01:02:56,120 --> 01:03:00,960
a N64 classic edition and there'll be a market for those controllers again.

1324
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:01,960
Hmm.

1325
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:02,960
Fair point.

1326
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:03,960
You're right.

1327
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:07,800
Nintendo might get on the classic bandwagon, uh, once again at some point.

1328
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:10,760
So yeah, shenanigans will ensue.

1329
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:15,040
Well, let's move on to a more classic things that Nintendo should get on the bandwagon

1330
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:16,040
for.

1331
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:17,040
Right?

1332
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:18,040
Uh, yeah.

1333
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:19,040
They're going to get on the bandwagon for cease and desist.

1334
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:20,040
No.

1335
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:21,720
Um, so this is actually kind of cool.

1336
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:28,080
So this is a fan project being done by this animator, um, Jesus Lopez, who's actually

1337
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:31,800
animated on several different, uh, games that are out there.

1338
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:37,560
The Simpsons tapped out, DuckTales remastered, Shante, Half Genie Hero, Silent Hill.

1339
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:44,440
Um, and so he has this fan project that he's working on that is a, a Super Mario Super

1340
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:46,720
Show Mario game.

1341
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:52,560
And so he's basically animating Mario in a game in the style of the Super Mario Super

1342
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:53,560
Show.

1343
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:59,560
So his first world that he's creating is Pastaland, which is from the first episode of the show.

1344
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:01,280
And it's pretty, it looks so good.

1345
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:02,280
We're showing a little bit.

1346
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:04,460
This is from the developer's YouTube channel.

1347
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:08,000
So he's like kind of filming his computer screen, so you can't even really get the full

1348
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,520
realness of how much these colors pop and things, but it looks really good.

1349
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,680
And it looks like a lawsuit will be on his desk.

1350
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:16,920
Well, that's not necessarily true because it's really sad because this looks great.

1351
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:19,720
He's been working on this for three years as like a family project.

1352
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:24,580
So his, his son, um, I think his 10 year old son is coding the game.

1353
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:25,960
He's doing the animation.

1354
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:32,200
And then he said his daughter is working on like, uh, some other like animation stuff

1355
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,880
or like kind of working with him on the animation stuff.

1356
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,240
So, but it's pretty awesome.

1357
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:41,680
Like he's recreated the first level, a level one, one from Super Mario Brothers in just,

1358
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:42,680
that's not really level one.

1359
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:44,800
It's sort of based on its fundamentals.

1360
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:45,800
Yeah.

1361
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:46,800
Yeah.

1362
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:51,160
So he's sort of based it on a level one, one and he's got like just all sorts of animations

1363
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:52,160
in there.

1364
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,280
The sound effects are from like the actual show.

1365
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:58,480
Even in other videos he has out there, there's like kind of this behind the scenes thing

1366
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:05,520
that was done by a YouTuber swanky box who actually showed off some of the, um, animations

1367
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:06,520
for the enemies.

1368
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:11,040
So like they're from the show and animated really nice.

1369
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:14,240
And he's talking about some of the things that he wants to work on.

1370
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:17,080
He's got other characters like Princess Peach in there already.

1371
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:20,920
And he has a mock-up of what Wario would look like in the art style.

1372
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:22,840
So pretty cool.

1373
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:24,680
So how long before Nintendo shuts it down?

1374
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:26,280
Because it's on all the gaming blogs now.

1375
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:31,560
So I don't know if he's, I don't know if he's necessarily planning on releasing it.

1376
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:35,980
I think it's more of right now, just a project that's kind of for fun.

1377
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:39,640
So I don't know if they would send him a cease and desist yet until he tries to like send

1378
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:41,960
it, release it out on the internet.

1379
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:45,560
Technically they could go after the YouTube.

1380
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:50,040
I know you don't want to hear it, but technically they could go, but yes, I completely understand

1381
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:54,120
if you have a fan game like that, that you're really interested on putting out there and

1382
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:55,120
I get it.

1383
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:59,240
If you spend a lot of time on it, you don't say anything until released, just release

1384
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:00,240
it.

1385
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,360
Then you say he's given it to somebody cause you're right.

1386
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:04,360
There was the other YouTube that actually was doing like the game.

1387
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:08,120
And the only reason I didn't use that for the stuff we were talking about talking to

1388
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:09,320
because, well, it's not just the talking.

1389
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:13,040
I mean, I can delete the audio, which is what I did, but then they also pop up all these

1390
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:14,040
other game boxes.

1391
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:18,080
There's a bunch of other bullshit that the YouTuber puts over it besides just the game,

1392
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:19,320
which I get it.

1393
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:23,720
It's his program or whatever, but yeah, so I didn't show that, but you, you know, you

1394
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:24,720
can visit other YouTube.

1395
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:26,040
You can actually see the game in motion.

1396
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:31,240
But my point is it's not just on this guy's computer cause he sent it to this other YouTuber.

1397
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:35,240
Well I know it says at least the graphics, I don't know being distributed privately.

1398
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:39,920
So I don't know if they would do anything until it's like intent on releasing it near

1399
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:40,920
right now.

1400
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:43,280
It's just kind of, you know, fan thing, but it looks awesome.

1401
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,160
I would love to see a game like that.

1402
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:48,760
Well, we'll see if we get through tomorrow without the lawyers attacking, we might be

1403
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:49,760
okay.

1404
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:50,760
We might be in the clear.

1405
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:51,760
Yeah.

1406
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:52,760
So stay tuned.

1407
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:53,760
Cause maybe next week we'll have a follow up.

1408
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:54,760
You're going to keep an eye out.

1409
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,080
See if this game is still around next week.

1410
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:57,080
Sure.

1411
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:58,080
Why not?

1412
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:59,080
Sounds good.

1413
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:00,080
All right.

1414
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:01,320
Well let's move on and talk about Beat Saber.

1415
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:05,200
Oh, that's a game I need to get back into playing cause, uh, yeah, clearly I was

1416
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:07,440
I was a little skinnier when I was playing a Beat Saber a little bit.

1417
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:13,080
I as well need to play that because, um, I played it once at that, um, Sacramento thing

1418
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:15,360
and I was like, dude, I need to get this.

1419
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:18,680
Well, there might be some more incentive for you to check out Beat Saber.

1420
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:23,740
There is a brand new 360 degree mode coming in December.

1421
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:26,700
So now the notes are coming at you from all directions.

1422
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:28,560
Well that's a good way to get tangled up in the cords.

1423
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:29,560
Right?

1424
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:30,560
I don't know.

1425
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:31,560
I don't know if that would work for me.

1426
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:35,080
I don't know if it was on like the Oculus Go or something like that where it's only

1427
01:07:35,080 --> 01:07:39,580
the wireless ones, but like, ah, I don't know.

1428
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:40,580
That sounds like a problem.

1429
01:07:40,580 --> 01:07:41,580
Yeah, it might.

1430
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:44,400
Well, I mean, and again, I don't, I don't know how maybe the note charts are going to

1431
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:48,280
be different on PlayStation four and maybe even though they say it's 360 degrees, like

1432
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:51,200
180 or something, it's really only like 180 or something like that.

1433
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:54,760
I don't know because I haven't been able to play one of these stages myself.

1434
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:56,120
How would you be able to watch behind you?

1435
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:57,120
I don't know.

1436
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:59,200
That doesn't sound like it'd be fun.

1437
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:02,960
I'm trying to see if they say it's like only 180 degrees or what have you.

1438
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:03,960
Yeah.

1439
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:07,320
It allows beat maps to send lines of blocks at you from arbitrary directions as the song

1440
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:08,320
plays out.

1441
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:11,420
Oh, so it's not just like spinning around behind you, but the note arrows can come in

1442
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:12,680
from different directions too.

1443
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:14,700
So I think that's what they mean by 360 degrees.

1444
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:18,580
It's not just coming at you from here, but it could be up, left, right.

1445
01:08:18,580 --> 01:08:20,760
They could be coming from all sorts of different directions.

1446
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:21,760
Yeah.

1447
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:26,760
I mean, I like the, it's a neat gimmick, but yeah, I know.

1448
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:27,760
I don't know.

1449
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:28,760
All right.

1450
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:34,800
Um, I probably won't actually play that mode just because there, why, why mess with perfection?

1451
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,620
The original mode is good.

1452
01:08:36,620 --> 01:08:41,300
I know, but you ever, do you ever watch some people play Beat Saber on Twitch or whatever?

1453
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:46,140
Like some people are like crazy good at Beat Saber and like some of the songs they're playing

1454
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:49,260
are just, I don't even know if I would say it's like good at Beat Saber.

1455
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:54,200
It's just like these mods and these custom things are just, they're just fast.

1456
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:58,560
They're like lightning fast and it's, it's weird to watch almost.

1457
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:02,360
But I like, I like the note charts for some of like the original, like Beat Saber stuff

1458
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:04,980
that like the, the crab rave song.

1459
01:09:04,980 --> 01:09:10,520
You do like some fun little, like the way you like do the notes is fun.

1460
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:12,420
That's why I don't always like, it's the same thing with DDR.

1461
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:15,900
I don't always like the hell mode steps, so I don't always like all the hell modes.

1462
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:20,320
Modern DDR where everything's hell mode steps almost.

1463
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:24,260
Anyway, uh, also coming to Beat Saber, it doesn't end there.

1464
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:30,500
It's not just the 360 degree mode, but there is a brand new music pack coming out next week.

1465
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:35,360
So previously we had the music pack from Imagine Dragons.

1466
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:39,300
So now we're going to be getting a music pack from Panic at the Disco is going to be the

1467
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:41,420
next music pack that's going to be in the game.

1468
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:47,520
So not techno or even like drum and bass or wow, wow, wow type of stuff.

1469
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:48,940
Like it's kind of different.

1470
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:51,500
It's like rock music that they keep putting in there.

1471
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:52,500
So I don't know.

1472
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:53,720
I'm kind of into it though.

1473
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:58,400
I liked the Imagine Dragons stuff more than I thought I would.

1474
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:03,120
So maybe I'll like the Panic at the Disco stuff a little better as well.

1475
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:10,640
So, um, any, uh, Oh, I was going to say you've, uh, you've got your DDR machine at home.

1476
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,560
Have you been playing music games at home lately?

1477
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:19,340
I have not, um, I actually started taking it apart a little bit, uh, last yesterday

1478
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:24,760
because I have, I've been sitting on a lot of parts that converted over to step mania

1479
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:26,900
and also other things.

1480
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:31,460
So I was looking at, uh, cause on this Facebook group that I follow, they have like a lot

1481
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:33,980
of people that talk about doing different conversions for things.

1482
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:37,720
And one of the conversions I was going to do is removing the fluorescent lights that

1483
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:42,840
are in the actual pads themselves and replacing them with LEDs.

1484
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:44,860
And so I have all the LEDs to do that.

1485
01:10:45,060 --> 01:10:50,020
Um, I just needed to see because I bought the ones that they recommended, but I guess

1486
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:53,520
I don't know how you exactly plug all that together.

1487
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:58,280
And so I was looking at what came with the LEDs and trying to see how that actually hooks

1488
01:10:58,280 --> 01:10:59,620
up to the board.

1489
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:03,060
And I think I might just have to like solder stuff together.

1490
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:04,620
Um, I don't know.

1491
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:08,420
I don't know if it like actually replaces the whole inverter board that's in there and

1492
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:10,980
just, I just plug it straight into that.

1493
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:14,340
Um, so that's why I was trying to determine yesterday I was looking at, I was like, Oh,

1494
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:18,300
and I want to kind of see how dirty these have gotten since I've been playing.

1495
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:19,300
Actually not very dirty.

1496
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:20,300
So that, that's good.

1497
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:22,100
I still haven't cleaned my right side pads though.

1498
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:26,860
I'm afraid to look at what's in there, but, um, but yeah, I have been going through that.

1499
01:11:26,860 --> 01:11:30,060
I was starting to try and work on cleaning my garage now that summer's over and we're

1500
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:32,220
getting back into cooler temperatures.

1501
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:34,100
I do want to play more DDR again.

1502
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:42,160
I do want to get the conversion stuff done just, just so I can put the system into, um,

1503
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:43,160
in there.

1504
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:46,440
And like, I know at one point I just like talking about, Oh, I'm gonna make this new,

1505
01:11:46,440 --> 01:11:48,280
you know, step me a theme it's going to be awesome.

1506
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:51,840
I just MVP, just put the minimal viable product in there.

1507
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:56,600
Just get a theme on there that's not atrocious and just load it full songs and just play

1508
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:57,600
it.

1509
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:58,600
I just don't really care at this point.

1510
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:00,720
I just want it playable.

1511
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:05,040
I can do that stuff later at some other date, but, um, that's what I wanted to do.

1512
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:09,360
So I'm going to try to get something in there so that I can actually play some different

1513
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:11,160
songs and do all that.

1514
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:14,320
Have you been tempted at all to add to Loki's arcade?

1515
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:18,240
Let's let's assume that wife agro was not an issue.

1516
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:21,600
Have you been tempted to add to Loki's arcade in the garage?

1517
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:27,120
No, not at all because, um, I have to, well, I still have to fix the monitor on my actual

1518
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:30,880
arcade cabinet I have out there cause it's not working right now.

1519
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:35,400
Um, ever since they moved it in the garage, I don't know if something just, I think the

1520
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:41,320
cap, uh, the caps on the board burned out and so I need to have like a TV repairman

1521
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:42,840
come and fix it.

1522
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:47,160
I would love to just replace it with an LCD panel, which would be nice, but no one makes

1523
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:49,800
four by three LCD panels anymore.

1524
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:50,800
So yeah.

1525
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:53,240
Or you'd probably have to get like a real specialized thing online.

1526
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:54,240
Yeah.

1527
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:59,240
I was like, even like the actual like, uh, monitors that go in there are super expensive

1528
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:00,460
and they don't sell them anymore.

1529
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:02,520
Like good luck finding CRT monitors.

1530
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:07,400
So I may just have to do something horrible, drastic, drastic.

1531
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:08,400
Yeah.

1532
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:11,880
I was like, Oh, can I find like an old LCD screen?

1533
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:15,880
Like maybe buy like, can I have someone custom make an LCD panel for that?

1534
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:19,460
Like I don't even know like how you would go about that.

1535
01:13:19,460 --> 01:13:25,320
So, um, right now it's sitting broken, but I would love to get that fixed up again.

1536
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:30,480
Um, uh, originally the, the agreement was I would sell that when I got a DDR machine.

1537
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:36,840
Um, but yeah, whatever, so there was an agreement that you were going to sell something before

1538
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:41,680
getting the DDR machine, but you didn't follow through on that.

1539
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:42,680
That's fine.

1540
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:43,680
All right.

1541
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:48,140
And so like, I would like to do that, but like, um, yeah, I just need to, I really want

1542
01:13:48,140 --> 01:13:50,080
to get like step man, you put on there cause I think that'd be fun.

1543
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:54,120
Now I have all the lighting stuff now for two and a site like the actual boards that

1544
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:55,120
control the lighting.

1545
01:13:55,120 --> 01:14:01,240
Um, I just need to see if it all works together and then figure out how to configure all that.

1546
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:04,960
And I thought about like the main stuff I know, and I actually downloaded like a big

1547
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:10,640
old zip file that someone put together for like doing a hyper spin with maim DDR and

1548
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:11,640
stuff like that.

1549
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:13,600
But I don't know if I'm going to do that.

1550
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:16,000
I just think step mania and we'll just call it a day.

1551
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:17,000
All right.

1552
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,560
Well that was quite the tangent, but that's okay.

1553
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:22,160
Cause we haven't had an update on Loki's arcade in a while, but I understand it is summertime

1554
01:14:22,160 --> 01:14:23,160
as well.

1555
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:26,360
You've got, uh, you haven't been able to be out there in the garage cause when it's a

1556
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:27,960
hundred degrees, DDR is no fun.

1557
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:28,960
Yes.

1558
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:31,400
It's, it's nicer now, but let's move on to our next story.

1559
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:34,360
Uh, Dar Sakura has a Minecraft related thing for us.

1560
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:35,360
I do.

1561
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:44,280
Um, actually it is not just Minecraft, Minecraft is getting a board game.

1562
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:47,180
Like have you noticed, like, have you gone through the board game section at target and

1563
01:14:47,180 --> 01:14:49,400
just looked like all the shenanigans they have there?

1564
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:50,400
Yeah.

1565
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:51,840
It's all like poop and pee jokes.

1566
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,600
I feel like a trapper keeper game.

1567
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,480
Do you know how many games there are?

1568
01:14:55,480 --> 01:14:56,480
It's so gross.

1569
01:14:56,480 --> 01:15:02,600
It comes in a mini trapper kids are obsessed and there's like, like, like other like eighties

1570
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:03,880
themed light games.

1571
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:07,200
But I think it's cool that Minecraft is getting a board game.

1572
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:08,560
It's called builders and biomes.

1573
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:11,840
It's a tabletop game that uses different elements.

1574
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:15,280
So you're, you explore your overworld and you build your structures and you mind your

1575
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:16,280
resources on this.

1576
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:22,520
Sounds like a little monopoly ish, but then you have to, uh, create these connection connected

1577
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:28,780
biomes of forests and mountains and Tundra and all this on your player board.

1578
01:15:28,780 --> 01:15:33,520
So you've got also got endermen and creepers that show up in there that you have to defeat

1579
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:35,320
with weapons that you collect through the game.

1580
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:37,480
It just looks like it's kind of cool.

1581
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:41,680
Um, where's the part where Loki yells, I'm a creeper kaboom and flips the board over

1582
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:48,320
flip board games over board games are expensive now.

1583
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:53,640
Um, but it's as being a released by Ravens burger, which is an interesting name.

1584
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:54,640
Okay.

1585
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:57,980
They've also done a game called villainous that uses Disney villains and they've done

1586
01:15:57,980 --> 01:16:04,600
a Jaws one and the universal monsters game, but this one, it just looks kinda kinda cool.

1587
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:05,600
I don't know.

1588
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:08,840
Maybe we could get folks together and play a little bit of this.

1589
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:11,040
So is it an $80 board games?

1590
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:12,040
You're right.

1591
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:13,040
Board games are expensive.

1592
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:14,040
Let me look at the preorder.

1593
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:16,400
Then again, video games are 60 bucks.

1594
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:21,080
So preorder says 40 bucks.

1595
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:22,080
Okay.

1596
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:23,080
39 99.

1597
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:24,080
That's a fair amount.

1598
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,360
There's probably a lot of loose pieces of the game like that.

1599
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:26,360
Yeah.

1600
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:28,560
It looks like a lot of stuff that interconnects.

1601
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:33,280
All right, well moving on with more Minecraft Loki.

1602
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:34,280
Yes.

1603
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:39,720
Um, so there was a lot of stuff that came out of the, uh, Minecraft, um, or mine con

1604
01:16:39,720 --> 01:16:42,280
live, which was this Saturday.

1605
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:47,480
So, um, some of the things that they talked about there, one of which is Minecraft earth,

1606
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:50,960
the game I've been looking forward to, um, it is going to be coming out.

1607
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:51,960
That's there.

1608
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:56,400
Like everybody says it's their answer to Pokemon go, but it, it, it, it's just an AR Pokemon

1609
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:57,400
go.

1610
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:58,400
It's just like Minecraft.

1611
01:16:58,400 --> 01:16:59,400
Yeah.

1612
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:00,400
Minecraft game.

1613
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:01,400
Yeah.

1614
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:03,760
So it's a Minecraft AR game and that's going to be coming out in the next couple of weeks.

1615
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:11,880
So looking forward to that, um, I've already preregistered in, um, uh, Android for that.

1616
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:14,600
So I will have to check it out.

1617
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:16,240
Um, some other stuff they announced.

1618
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:19,440
So they had a vote on which biomes they're going to add to the game.

1619
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:23,400
So there was a brand new biome that's going to be enhanced mountains.

1620
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:28,400
That's going to have, um, you know, goats and they're going to be adding some more snow

1621
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:29,400
and stuff like that.

1622
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:30,800
And they're going to be really tall.

1623
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:31,800
So that's pretty cool.

1624
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:36,000
Uh, they showed off some more stuff for Minecraft dungeons that looked pretty cool.

1625
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:40,400
They announced that next year is going to be a Minecraft festival from September 25th

1626
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:44,260
to 27th in Orlando, Florida.

1627
01:17:44,260 --> 01:17:49,640
And they said it's going to be a three day celebration with all things Minecraft and

1628
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:50,640
what else?

1629
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:56,800
Uh, they talked about an update to the Java version with honey blocks and bees, not the

1630
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:57,800
bees.

1631
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:58,800
So you can get bees.

1632
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:04,160
You can get attacked by bees now in Minecraft, they are neutral mobs, so don't attack them.

1633
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:05,160
They won't attack you.

1634
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:06,160
Okay.

1635
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:11,040
Uh, they talked about some creator tools so you can do different scripting, um, and they

1636
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:16,920
have like the editor stick that you can use to edit things, rotate stuff around, um, make

1637
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:19,180
full crops and stuff like that.

1638
01:18:19,180 --> 01:18:23,960
So it sounds a little bit like, um, some of the other tools that they have and like world

1639
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:31,880
edit or whatever, uh, realms plus that allows you to add, they've expanded the realms for

1640
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:37,480
the same price and you still, I guess, get access to 10 player realms and then they have

1641
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:42,320
50 pieces of content from the mark Minecraft marketplace at no extra cost.

1642
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:46,340
They have a character creator and um, bedrock capes.

1643
01:18:46,340 --> 01:18:52,040
It's like a windows 10, xbox one, android app that you can create your own characters

1644
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:54,720
and import them into Minecraft.

1645
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:57,860
They did another update, which they have a lot of new biomes.

1646
01:18:57,860 --> 01:19:04,000
So soul sand valley, nether wart fortress red, nether wart forest blue, uh, they have

1647
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:10,000
piglin beast, which is a new mob that appears in the nether and they've renamed the zombie

1648
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:16,240
pigmen to zombified piglins and piglins are going to be these, um, kind of like caveman

1649
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:22,240
characters that are pigs, I guess, cave pig characters and they will be hostile and then

1650
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:26,880
new block, which is a target block that if you shoot with an arrow, it powers redstone.

1651
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,840
So they're not doing Minecraft too.

1652
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:34,200
They are continuing to make these big upgrades to the original Minecraft, but no 4k graphics.

1653
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:39,840
Uh, well remember they do have the ray tracing, you know, ray tracing so you can get that.

1654
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:47,720
But yeah, you have to have a beefed up computer to do that unless you use mods, right?

1655
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:48,720
All right.

1656
01:19:48,720 --> 01:19:52,640
Well, uh, going from a Minecraft to another game that's a couple of years old, but people

1657
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:57,240
are still really into it and that is Overwatch, but Overwatch going to be getting some major

1658
01:19:57,240 --> 01:20:00,520
character kind of rebalancing and character shuffling around.

1659
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:03,560
There's no new characters or new stages or things being announced, but there is still

1660
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:09,120
a very large patch that just went to the PTR or public test realm, which is for PC players

1661
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:11,800
of the game because they don't have PTR on the consoles.

1662
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:15,520
But September 24th saw a pretty big PTR patch be delivered.

1663
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:20,060
And one could kind of also see that this is in advance of the switch version coming out.

1664
01:20:20,060 --> 01:20:23,340
So it's almost like they're doing some rebalancing before the switch version is out.

1665
01:20:23,340 --> 01:20:27,960
They're doing some pretty big juggling with heroes like D.Va where the defense matrix

1666
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:28,960
is going to be changing.

1667
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:34,640
The regeneration rate is increased and the delay before the regeneration begins is lowered.

1668
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:38,000
And many characters are getting changes.

1669
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:42,680
Sigma is getting quite a few changes as well, which is like Sigma is the one new character

1670
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:44,920
in the game that I just can't get into.

1671
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:49,640
Like I like Batiste, I like Orisa, I like a lot of the other characters they've added.

1672
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:50,640
I don't really care for Sigma.

1673
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:51,760
I don't get them.

1674
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:56,760
But maybe these reshufflings will help a little bit because yeah, it sounds like they're making

1675
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:59,220
them less powered, which this always happens.

1676
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:02,280
They roll out a new hero, then they got to nerf them.

1677
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:06,560
So Kinetic Grasp no longer blocks certain moves.

1678
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:10,320
The experimental barrier regeneration rate was reduced and there's a cool down after

1679
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:11,780
recalling the barrier.

1680
01:21:11,780 --> 01:21:14,520
So they're changing some things a little bit.

1681
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:16,760
But like Winston, they're buffing up a little bit.

1682
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:22,360
The duration of the barrier projector is increasing and the health is increasing as well.

1683
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:25,840
Lucio's crossfade speed boost is going to get stronger.

1684
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:30,100
And that sounds like that's going to be a pretty big change for Lucio.

1685
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:33,540
So yeah, a lot of changes going to some of your favorite characters there.

1686
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:36,980
Symmetra, again, getting a bunch of changes.

1687
01:21:36,980 --> 01:21:39,860
Photon barriers duration is being reduced.

1688
01:21:39,860 --> 01:21:44,540
Sentry turrets, their overall output damage is being reduced.

1689
01:21:44,540 --> 01:21:49,320
And yeah, a photon projector, if you're getting hit by it, you'll be able to hear it more.

1690
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:54,720
So yeah, lots of heroes in Overwatch getting changes, but it also just goes to show, man,

1691
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:56,780
this game just keeps on going.

1692
01:21:56,780 --> 01:21:57,780
Yeah.

1693
01:21:57,780 --> 01:21:58,780
Yeah.

1694
01:21:58,780 --> 01:21:59,780
Overwatch is still...

1695
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:03,780
I didn't really play it this week, but just within the past couple of weeks, I will bring

1696
01:22:03,780 --> 01:22:05,700
up Overwatch and randomly play Quick Play.

1697
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:10,580
I really liked the new role queuing because I like going in there knowing I'll get to

1698
01:22:10,580 --> 01:22:14,620
play a healer and there's a pretty good chance I can play Moira because usually I want to

1699
01:22:14,620 --> 01:22:15,620
play Moira.

1700
01:22:15,620 --> 01:22:18,580
But even if the other healer beats me to it, I like to do Lucio or something else.

1701
01:22:18,580 --> 01:22:22,380
And it's like, I know somebody else isn't going to snipe that hero position or that

1702
01:22:22,380 --> 01:22:23,380
healer position.

1703
01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:27,200
And we're going to have enough, like we're going to have a well-rounded team.

1704
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:30,840
You don't have like everybody trying to pick Hanzo, like in the first week of the game,

1705
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:34,280
it was like, wow, our team is entirely Hanzo and Widowmaker.

1706
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:38,560
So yeah, that's really helped a lot, I think, when it comes to Overwatch.

1707
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:41,100
Anyway, we're going to go back to a simpler time.

1708
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:46,280
It's the classic game of the week where, you know, you couldn't patch games like this.

1709
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:50,160
You couldn't keep a game going for years and years through patches.

1710
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:52,080
You just did sequels.

1711
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:55,400
But anyway, Dark Soccer is going to open up the gaming vault and we're going to take a

1712
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:59,640
trip down memory lane with this week's classic game of the week.

1713
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:02,800
Dark Soccer, what did you pick for us this week?

1714
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:05,680
I picked a game called Osmond.

1715
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:06,680
Are you familiar with it?

1716
01:23:06,680 --> 01:23:07,680
Um, not really.

1717
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:09,680
I've got to admit.

1718
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:14,080
Osmond was produced by a company called Mitchellcore.

1719
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:20,920
However, the development staff was mostly ex-Capcom staff, including Yotsui Koichi,

1720
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:28,640
who was the original designer, or one of the original creators of Strider.

1721
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:34,080
And this game is considered an unofficial sequel to Strider.

1722
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:35,800
Like a spiritual successor type of thing?

1723
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:39,000
Well, at the time it was the sequel.

1724
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,520
It was considered, I mean, not necessarily a spiritual.

1725
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:45,720
He called it his Strider 2, you know?

1726
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:52,040
You can see just in this little video here a lot of things in common with Strider.

1727
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:58,400
Just with how it looks with the flashing, the climbing the walls, the acrobatics.

1728
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:02,560
It was actually, he calls it an irregular sequel.

1729
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:14,720
So where Strider was set in a sort of futuristic Soviet-ish setting, in this case it's more

1730
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:21,680
of a cyberpunk Arabian style setting, where instead of Strider Hiryu being a Japanese

1731
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:25,120
guy, you play a Middle Eastern protagonist named Kirin.

1732
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:30,760
And he doesn't use any weapons, he's just full fight.

1733
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:38,600
And you go through all these different exotic locations and fight enemies to stop this international

1734
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:45,280
sort of federal government, or the federation that's taking over the entire world.

1735
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:53,040
So you're going to try to infiltrate and try to fight everybody and be the man.

1736
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:59,080
At any rate, yeah, as you'll see, it has a lot of the same attack sequences that Strider

1737
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:01,080
Hiryu does.

1738
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:06,560
It's A to attack, B to jump, C to do your screen clearing attack.

1739
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:12,840
He also has some different power-ups and he has different techniques.

1740
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:16,960
He has the sliding technique that's very much like Hiryu's slide.

1741
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:21,520
He has some throws for human-sized characters only.

1742
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:25,440
One of them is called the Hell Wheel, the other is called the Izuna Drop.

1743
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:33,640
He has an attack called the Shredding Dance, where he does a three-punch combination and

1744
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:36,520
it's stronger than the basic kits but difficult to use.

1745
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:40,840
And the Kirin Star Festival, where he kills all the enemies on screen, I just think that's

1746
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:42,640
a great name for it.

1747
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:50,680
So you actually have different branching paths and there's no actual checkpoint.

1748
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:59,160
When you die, you respawn where you were last killed, although in the final stage, you have

1749
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:01,080
checkpoints there.

1750
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:05,000
So it's a little bit more difficult.

1751
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:09,720
You have your power-ups in here that are different than Hiryu's power-ups, so you get one that

1752
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:12,680
changes his pants to purple.

1753
01:26:12,680 --> 01:26:14,320
That's the power-up, his pants turn purple.

1754
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:16,080
Okay, a little bit more than that.

1755
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:21,660
He gets an energy double of himself, think of Ninja Gaiden with this, and it does the

1756
01:26:21,660 --> 01:26:27,680
non-upgraded versions of Kirin's attacks and then it will fly away and re-merge with Kirin.

1757
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:32,560
The second one gives him red pants and two shadows.

1758
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:36,600
And the third one gives him white pants and three shadows.

1759
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:41,920
The last one changes his pants back to black so he gets his original pants back and does

1760
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:46,560
energy blades with his kicks that increase his melee range.

1761
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:50,080
And then it's a limited set of attacks on here.

1762
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:58,520
So the game is, I mean, it was pretty much just like if anyone wanted another Strider

1763
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:01,440
game, then Osmond was going to be your game.

1764
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:02,680
It's really fun.

1765
01:27:02,680 --> 01:27:07,800
It was only ever released in the arcades.

1766
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:16,460
So you will not find any sort of home version for this outside of, you know, Maine.

1767
01:27:16,460 --> 01:27:18,940
It had a different name in Japan, by the way.

1768
01:27:18,940 --> 01:27:27,580
It was called Cannon Dancer, which I think is a cool name, you know, Osmond doesn't really

1769
01:27:27,580 --> 01:27:32,980
make a lot of sense because Osmond was the name of a Turkish, I want to say a Turkish

1770
01:27:32,980 --> 01:27:33,980
prince or king.

1771
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:38,320
Why do you think that they've stayed away from putting this in any type of like retrospective

1772
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:41,220
collection or the, I mean, is it a complicated rights issue or what?

1773
01:27:41,220 --> 01:27:49,280
I don't know, but I've never really heard of Mitchell Corps outside of this game.

1774
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:55,120
It looks like that the hardware for this was a Data East 156.

1775
01:27:55,120 --> 01:28:02,280
So wait, in Japan it was released by Atlas, but I don't, let me look at the Mitchell Corporation.

1776
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:03,360
I want to see what else they've done.

1777
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:06,400
They were a Japanese company.

1778
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:18,740
They are, they hired Capcom and TAD Corporation employees, and they were owned, the president

1779
01:28:18,740 --> 01:28:19,740
was Roy Ozaki.

1780
01:28:19,740 --> 01:28:22,180
I'm trying to see what else that they've done.

1781
01:28:22,180 --> 01:28:27,860
They did basically, they did titles for home consoles, handhelds, Japanese mobile games,

1782
01:28:27,860 --> 01:28:33,340
arcade and interactive kiosks, and printed circuit boards for the coin-op market.

1783
01:28:33,340 --> 01:28:38,480
And then they started developing games for Nintendo hardware.

1784
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:42,720
They were best known as the developer of a game called Puzloop.

1785
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:47,240
They did the Pang series, which we got as Buster Brothers and distributed by Capcom.

1786
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:48,240
Oh, yeah.

1787
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:49,240
Okay.

1788
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:54,080
I knew I'd seen the name, but it didn't really stick out to me.

1789
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:59,320
A Nintendo of America release, Puzloop for Nintendo DS, under the title of Magnetica.

1790
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:04,260
And then there was a four player version called Magnetica Twist on We Were Servious.

1791
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:07,740
Tokyo Crash Mobs is the last of the Puzloop series.

1792
01:29:07,740 --> 01:29:14,860
So they did Ballistik, they did Funky Jet, licensed by Data East.

1793
01:29:14,860 --> 01:29:18,060
Quest Buster's kind of confirming, Mitchell Company went under a few years ago.

1794
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:19,060
Yeah.

1795
01:29:19,060 --> 01:29:23,180
I'm just looking at some of the other names to see if any of it just looks familiar.

1796
01:29:23,180 --> 01:29:26,460
Charlie Ninja, that's a fun name.

1797
01:29:26,460 --> 01:29:30,720
They did Pallarium, Chokan Hituhide.

1798
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:35,760
Yeah, I'm not really seeing number battles.

1799
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:37,920
Okay, nothing to do with Strider.

1800
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:39,960
Yeah, Tokyo Crash Mobs.

1801
01:29:39,960 --> 01:29:42,600
Yeah I'm just looking through the list of everything to see if there's anything else

1802
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:44,460
that looked familiar.

1803
01:29:44,460 --> 01:29:52,560
So yeah, funny enough, Osmond was a 1996 release and there were zero.

1804
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:56,940
I would think that if it would get a home release, like I don't know who owns the rights

1805
01:29:56,940 --> 01:29:59,300
to it now.

1806
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:03,780
I mean what company ate up Mitchell?

1807
01:30:03,780 --> 01:30:06,820
Their assets might have been liquidated in her all over the place, for all we know.

1808
01:30:06,820 --> 01:30:11,660
So yeah, then we don't actually know who owns the rights to it.

1809
01:30:11,660 --> 01:30:14,420
But I can tell you that it was published in Japan by Atlas.

1810
01:30:14,420 --> 01:30:20,820
So I think if there was going to be any kind of home version release, it would have to

1811
01:30:20,820 --> 01:30:22,960
go out by Atlas, at least in Japan.

1812
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:26,360
Well, if you're going to pirate it using MAME, at least you can feel good about the fact

1813
01:30:26,360 --> 01:30:29,200
that there is no official way to support this game.

1814
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:30,900
Pirating is pretty much the only way you can play it.

1815
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:35,680
Not that I usually would endorse that route, but hey, you don't want me to pay for it.

1816
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:39,760
Dude, wouldn't it be cool if we bought the rights to Osmond?

1817
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:43,440
We'll give those to YYR as well, even though he doesn't, I think he's pretty clearly said

1818
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:45,160
he doesn't want the rights.

1819
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:46,160
He's trying to raise a child.

1820
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:47,160
No, no.

1821
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:48,160
No, just take the gift.

1822
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:52,020
I want the rights for this and release them as mini cabs.

1823
01:30:52,020 --> 01:30:53,020
There you go.

1824
01:30:53,020 --> 01:30:54,380
Like, like the little Mortal Kombat thing.

1825
01:30:54,380 --> 01:30:55,380
No, no, no, no, no.

1826
01:30:55,380 --> 01:30:56,380
Oh, mini.

1827
01:30:56,380 --> 01:30:57,380
Oh, mini.

1828
01:30:57,380 --> 01:30:58,380
Oh, okay.

1829
01:30:58,380 --> 01:30:59,380
Like the $100 mini cabs or whatever.

1830
01:30:59,380 --> 01:31:00,380
Yeah.

1831
01:31:00,380 --> 01:31:01,380
Yeah.

1832
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:02,380
That'd be cool.

1833
01:31:02,380 --> 01:31:03,380
Orange, Wright and Jetsons.

1834
01:31:03,380 --> 01:31:04,380
Come on, Walgreens.

1835
01:31:04,380 --> 01:31:05,380
This is your chance.

1836
01:31:05,380 --> 01:31:06,860
The Osmond and Ms. Pac-Man cabinet.

1837
01:31:06,860 --> 01:31:11,380
But you know, this game though is if you, if you like Strider and like the challenge

1838
01:31:11,380 --> 01:31:15,660
of the first Strider, this game is really, really amazing for that.

1839
01:31:15,660 --> 01:31:20,640
I would definitely encourage everyone to, to load it up and play it.

1840
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:26,600
Or if you find an arcade machine, if you find an arcade machine of Osmond in the wild, fucking

1841
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:34,760
tweet it to us and you take a video of yourself playing it, I will hand write you a letter

1842
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:35,760
and mail it to you.

1843
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:36,760
Thanks.

1844
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:39,760
You will have, you will hand write a letter of thanks and send it to the listener.

1845
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:40,760
It may not say thanks.

1846
01:31:40,760 --> 01:31:49,300
It may, it may have, uh, like an, uh, an Instax photo of me or the cat or Mr. Smoosh or my

1847
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:53,020
foot, but I'll send you a picture.

1848
01:31:53,020 --> 01:31:56,540
I just can't guarantee what the picture will be.

1849
01:31:56,540 --> 01:31:57,780
That's your prize.

1850
01:31:57,780 --> 01:31:58,780
That's what I'm holding.

1851
01:31:58,780 --> 01:32:01,180
Um, while, uh, time to pizza is going on.

1852
01:32:01,180 --> 01:32:03,460
It's it's it's yes.

1853
01:32:03,460 --> 01:32:08,260
So while there is one person participating in time to pizza, everybody else gets to participate

1854
01:32:08,260 --> 01:32:16,200
in the find an Osmond machine, literally anywhere that works in the wild and send me a video

1855
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:20,760
of you playing it and you will get a thing, a Polaroid or something.

1856
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:23,600
You might get maybe an animal crossing trading card.

1857
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:24,600
Okay.

1858
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:25,600
All right.

1859
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:26,600
I've got dupes anyway.

1860
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:27,600
I think that's it.

1861
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:28,600
My b-roll is running out.

1862
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:29,600
So there it is.

1863
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:30,600
A classic game of the week.

1864
01:32:30,600 --> 01:32:31,600
Osmond.

1865
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:33,780
Ah, all right.

1866
01:32:33,780 --> 01:32:36,560
Orange Wright says this contest can be called Time to Osmond.

1867
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:37,560
I like that.

1868
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:39,680
It's time to play this game.

1869
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:40,680
Check it out.

1870
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:41,680
It really is a very good game.

1871
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:42,680
It is.

1872
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:45,480
And if you weren't, if you're on the podcast feed and you can't see the Twitch, you know,

1873
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:48,560
stuff cause you don't subscribe on Twitch or whatever, like at least like go look up

1874
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:49,960
a YouTube long play of it.

1875
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:50,960
GGKS.

1876
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:51,960
Yeah.

1877
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:52,960
So you can see the game.

1878
01:32:52,960 --> 01:32:53,960
GGKS.

1879
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:54,960
What's that?

1880
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:55,960
Uh, Google.

1881
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:57,360
It means look it up on Google.

1882
01:32:57,360 --> 01:32:58,360
Stupid.

1883
01:32:58,360 --> 01:32:59,760
Oh, let me Google that for you.com.

1884
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:00,760
No.

1885
01:33:00,760 --> 01:33:01,760
All right.

1886
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:06,020
O S M A N if you're curious or Canon Dan, but you do want to put, you don't want to

1887
01:33:06,020 --> 01:33:07,020
put Osmond video games.

1888
01:33:07,020 --> 01:33:13,140
I think there's some youtuber out there will know Osmond was a real Turkish dignitary of

1889
01:33:13,140 --> 01:33:20,740
some kind in the ancient ages, but also now some big youtuber because uh, when I searched

1890
01:33:20,740 --> 01:33:24,700
for the guy, I just put Osmond at first and I got some youtube dude and I was like, video

1891
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:25,700
game.

1892
01:33:25,700 --> 01:33:34,560
It is Osmond the first or Osmond Ghazi who died in a 1323 who was a Questbuster says

1893
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:36,080
founded the Ottoman dynasty.

1894
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:37,080
Ottoman Turks.

1895
01:33:37,080 --> 01:33:38,080
Exactly.

1896
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:39,080
Today.

1897
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:40,080
Yeah.

1898
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:43,600
Even old New York was once New Amsterdam.

1899
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:44,600
Why they change it?

1900
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:49,480
I can't say maybe they liked it better that way.

1901
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:50,480
Sorry.

1902
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:54,840
I, I can't help it whenever anybody talks about the Turks and stuff is that song comes

1903
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:55,840
to mind.

1904
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:56,840
All right.

1905
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:57,840
Anyway, it's probably, I hope that's not disrespectful.

1906
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:58,840
Yes.

1907
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:04,000
The Ottoman dynasty bringers of, you know, footrests everywhere is careful.

1908
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,340
You don't want to risk a mute.

1909
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:06,340
Oh, come on.

1910
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:07,900
Do you actually, do you know what else I played this week?

1911
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:09,300
I just didn't put it on stream.

1912
01:34:09,300 --> 01:34:12,380
We'll talk about this and we'll get into rapid fire news cause we don't have a break saving

1913
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:13,380
tonight.

1914
01:34:13,380 --> 01:34:14,380
I played Twitch sings.

1915
01:34:14,380 --> 01:34:18,740
I actually play, it's just, just because I was like, this icon is on my desktop and I've

1916
01:34:18,740 --> 01:34:19,740
never clicked it.

1917
01:34:19,740 --> 01:34:20,740
Click, click.

1918
01:34:20,740 --> 01:34:22,500
And I played a little bit to which things it is.

1919
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:23,500
It's karaoke revolution.

1920
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:24,800
It is pretty much exactly that game.

1921
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:25,800
Did you get your ABBA on?

1922
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:26,800
I, you fuck.

1923
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:27,800
Yeah, I did.

1924
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:30,160
It actually has a pretty robust library of songs.

1925
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:31,160
I was pretty impressed.

1926
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:33,000
It had my Atlanta song and everything.

1927
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,720
Um, do they mute you though?

1928
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:38,480
If you, I mean, I would assume that they don't know because it's their game.

1929
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:43,160
So I mean, and you're, it's, they're all karaoke covers, so they're not the real song.

1930
01:34:43,160 --> 01:34:46,880
So, um, and I imagine they must've licensed the rights cause they don't have every song

1931
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:50,080
ever made, but they have a, and you can do duets.

1932
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:51,080
That's what I thought was the interesting thing.

1933
01:34:51,080 --> 01:34:55,480
So like a streamer could start and that there's a phone app that does this too.

1934
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:59,100
And then you can go in and do your half while the other one is going, does that mean I can

1935
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:01,200
get someone to do islands in the stream with me?

1936
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:02,200
You could.

1937
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:03,200
Yeah.

1938
01:35:03,200 --> 01:35:06,620
If I could, if I can fix my sink, um, I'll do islands in the stream, but I get to be

1939
01:35:06,620 --> 01:35:07,620
Dolly.

1940
01:35:07,620 --> 01:35:09,060
I don't want to be Kenny Rogers.

1941
01:35:09,060 --> 01:35:11,740
He's like full of preservatives.

1942
01:35:11,740 --> 01:35:15,300
Have you seen that man's face?

1943
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:17,280
Islands in the stream.

1944
01:35:17,280 --> 01:35:18,280
Stop.

1945
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:22,480
Knock it off.

1946
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:27,080
I had to listen to my wife get triggered to sing songs like by every single word in the

1947
01:35:27,080 --> 01:35:29,720
goddamn like English language.

1948
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:30,720
Can you just stop?

1949
01:35:30,720 --> 01:35:33,120
Can I get a break from that for just a little bit?

1950
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:37,920
Dan and I just make up our own lyrics to things and we, then we sing songs about the cat.

1951
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:42,800
Does that, is that an invite to sing a cat song?

1952
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:43,800
All right.

1953
01:35:44,780 --> 01:35:45,780
Moving on.

1954
01:35:45,780 --> 01:35:48,220
Oh, you should wait, wait, wait.

1955
01:35:48,220 --> 01:35:50,580
Stop before I'm ready to derail this train a little bit more.

1956
01:35:50,580 --> 01:35:55,400
So like we watched, there's this show on Netflix now, it's like explaining different things

1957
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:56,580
like that they have there.

1958
01:35:56,580 --> 01:35:59,820
Um, and so one of them was K-pop.

1959
01:35:59,820 --> 01:36:03,820
What is K-pop, you know, explaining what it's K-pop explains.

1960
01:36:03,820 --> 01:36:09,860
So my wife saw that and she does not like K-pop and she also doesn't like the fact that

1961
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:15,080
I'm like, well, you know, I don't necessarily listen to this stuff, but I've listened to

1962
01:36:15,080 --> 01:36:16,080
some K-pop music.

1963
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:18,080
Of course you would.

1964
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:23,920
I liked Monsta X for a hot minute, but the rest of us really cookie cutter.

1965
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:28,560
Speaking of karaoke, since we're derailing the train, um, I did not know we had one of

1966
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:31,920
those places downtown, like right across the street from the crest.

1967
01:36:31,920 --> 01:36:35,580
There's one of those places you go upstairs and you can rent a room, a karaoke room and

1968
01:36:35,580 --> 01:36:40,040
like have it and you can get sushi and stuff and drinks like delivered to your little private

1969
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:41,040
room.

1970
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:44,600
Like there's a whole, like it's just like a legit karaoke and not just like drunk white

1971
01:36:44,600 --> 01:36:45,600
people karaoke.

1972
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:47,040
Well, it's both.

1973
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:49,640
But Coriana Plaza, you can do the same thing.

1974
01:36:49,640 --> 01:36:51,840
Well, but there's one right here.

1975
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:57,640
There's the place actually that I like to go do karaoke is, um, in, uh, Japantown in

1976
01:36:57,640 --> 01:36:58,640
San Francisco.

1977
01:36:58,640 --> 01:36:59,640
Upstairs.

1978
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:03,120
Um, they have like a little bar and then they have the karaoke rooms.

1979
01:37:03,120 --> 01:37:04,120
I don't think I've been there.

1980
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:05,120
Really fun.

1981
01:37:05,660 --> 01:37:07,300
There's a better place in Alameda though.

1982
01:37:07,300 --> 01:37:08,820
Back to video games.

1983
01:37:08,820 --> 01:37:10,940
Let's get to rapid fire news.

1984
01:37:10,940 --> 01:37:12,660
All right.

1985
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:17,900
Um, so we talked a little bit about what's coming to PlayStation plus in October.

1986
01:37:17,900 --> 01:37:19,580
Let's talk about Microsoft.

1987
01:37:19,580 --> 01:37:23,940
So Microsoft is getting, uh, I love this name.

1988
01:37:23,940 --> 01:37:25,180
This is awesome.

1989
01:37:25,180 --> 01:37:28,900
So the first game on the list is Tembo, the Badass Elephant.

1990
01:37:28,900 --> 01:37:33,000
That's coming to Xbox one and also Friday the 13th, the game that's getting to be the

1991
01:37:33,020 --> 01:37:35,700
second half of October through the middle of November.

1992
01:37:35,700 --> 01:37:36,700
Tembo the Badass Elephant.

1993
01:37:36,700 --> 01:37:37,700
Tembo the Badass Elephant.

1994
01:37:37,700 --> 01:37:39,700
Sign me the fuck up.

1995
01:37:39,700 --> 01:37:40,820
It is your free game.

1996
01:37:40,820 --> 01:37:42,020
He's not Dumbo.

1997
01:37:42,020 --> 01:37:43,440
He's Tembo.

1998
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:48,500
And then your Xbox 360 compatible games really scraping the bottom of this barrel, Disney's

1999
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:49,500
Bolt.

2000
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:51,580
Remember that movie?

2001
01:37:51,580 --> 01:37:55,500
Um, and then Ninja Gaiden three, Razor's Edge.

2002
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:57,580
That's going to be the second half of October.

2003
01:37:57,580 --> 01:37:58,580
Hmm.

2004
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Hmm.

2005
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:04,080
And then, uh, let's celebrate 130 years of Nintendo.

2006
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:05,080
That's right.

2007
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:10,200
They turned 130 and you may be thinking, well, wait, what am I talking about?

2008
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:13,680
You guys know that they've made card games before they made video games.

2009
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:14,680
Jesus Christ.

2010
01:38:14,680 --> 01:38:17,120
I'm not going to explain it like, like it's a big shock or anything.

2011
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:18,120
Okay.

2012
01:38:18,120 --> 01:38:26,400
But yeah, so 130 and they are, uh, the oldest, um, or they're one of the oldest gaming companies

2013
01:38:27,380 --> 01:38:35,460
Apparently, uh, Taito was founded in 1953 and Sega began in 1960 and they are much older.

2014
01:38:35,460 --> 01:38:37,740
So good for them.

2015
01:38:37,740 --> 01:38:42,460
Wait, not if you're in 1960, you're not older than Nintendo's way older than that.

2016
01:38:42,460 --> 01:38:44,660
No, I said Nintendo is much older than that.

2017
01:38:44,660 --> 01:38:45,660
Oh, okay.

2018
01:38:45,660 --> 01:38:46,660
I get it.

2019
01:38:46,660 --> 01:38:47,660
Yes.

2020
01:38:47,660 --> 01:38:48,660
I know math backwards.

2021
01:38:48,660 --> 01:38:49,660
Do you?

2022
01:38:49,660 --> 01:38:50,660
Okay.

2023
01:38:50,660 --> 01:38:51,660
Moving on.

2024
01:38:51,660 --> 01:38:54,620
Uh, let's talk about speaking of Nintendo.

2025
01:38:54,620 --> 01:38:56,560
Let's talk about the switch online collection.

2026
01:38:56,560 --> 01:39:01,720
Have you, uh, gotten a super Nintendo controller to use with your super Nintendo games on the

2027
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:02,860
switch?

2028
01:39:02,860 --> 01:39:07,420
If the answer is no, then you're missing out on a cute little extra something, something.

2029
01:39:07,420 --> 01:39:11,040
If you have the switch online, super Nintendo collection and the controller that goes with

2030
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:17,120
it, when you go into certain super Nintendo games, the collection menu will replace the

2031
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:21,560
standard sound effects with some from super Mario world.

2032
01:39:21,560 --> 01:39:23,180
Ooh.

2033
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:27,400
You get sound effect replacements for having spent all of that money on that controller.

2034
01:39:27,400 --> 01:39:28,400
Oh, whatever.

2035
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:34,000
It's, it's cute, I guess, but, and you know, honestly, I'll, I'll snark in that stuff aside.

2036
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:38,120
The super Nintendo controller really was like one of like, like the perfect controller in

2037
01:39:38,120 --> 01:39:39,120
many ways.

2038
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:42,960
I mean, yeah, it didn't have analog cause gaming wasn't there yet, but for like non

2039
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:48,000
analog stuff, I don't think there was a better controller in my opinion, anyway.

2040
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,000
More Nintendo stuff.

2041
01:39:49,660 --> 01:39:54,300
This is interesting because apparently the brand new character, the Dragon Quest hero

2042
01:39:54,300 --> 01:40:00,140
was banned in competitive play in the official Nintendo France tournament.

2043
01:40:00,140 --> 01:40:01,140
That's right.

2044
01:40:01,140 --> 01:40:05,940
Nintendo in France banned one of their own, the Dragon Quest hero characters, but then

2045
01:40:05,940 --> 01:40:08,900
Nintendo ended up unbanning them.

2046
01:40:08,900 --> 01:40:12,900
So Nintendo is standardizing rule sets for all tournaments across the European team cup

2047
01:40:12,900 --> 01:40:15,520
in response to what France did.

2048
01:40:15,540 --> 01:40:20,180
So they're said in a quote, we're harmonizing these rules across Europe to make sure that

2049
01:40:20,180 --> 01:40:26,060
no community or country is disadvantaged when competing in the pan European final next year.

2050
01:40:26,060 --> 01:40:30,340
In terms of future fighter releases, we'll create more detailed guidelines for our tournament

2051
01:40:30,340 --> 01:40:35,140
organizers to make sure that we maintain a level playing field through consistent fighter

2052
01:40:35,140 --> 01:40:36,940
eligibility across Europe.

2053
01:40:36,940 --> 01:40:42,180
And I suppose France had no choice, but to surrender to this official designation from

2054
01:40:42,180 --> 01:40:43,600
Nintendo of Europe.

2055
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:45,300
So there you go.

2056
01:40:45,300 --> 01:40:47,360
All right, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

2057
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:48,360
Stuff.

2058
01:40:48,360 --> 01:40:53,480
Um, anyway, uh, Grandia, the first and second game, which are actually a couple of games

2059
01:40:53,480 --> 01:40:59,880
that I super, super, super like, um, are going to have, um, HD remasters coming out for PC

2060
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:01,800
on October 15th.

2061
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:06,640
And you know, I'm gonna get it because I fucking love the first Grandia.

2062
01:41:06,640 --> 01:41:09,720
I mean, it'd be nice playing a version that looks good that I don't have to bust out my

2063
01:41:09,720 --> 01:41:12,720
Saturn for and then sit with a dictionary to play.

2064
01:41:12,740 --> 01:41:19,300
Um, but it will have, um, both the English and Japanese audio, um, it will have enhanced

2065
01:41:19,300 --> 01:41:24,700
sprites and texture art, UI improvements, widescreen support and customizable resolutions.

2066
01:41:24,700 --> 01:41:30,020
Um, and it will have steam achievements and you can also of course do custom, uh, controller,

2067
01:41:30,020 --> 01:41:31,780
uh, mapping.

2068
01:41:31,780 --> 01:41:40,140
And then, um, the, uh, I believe that these are already out on switch and there is a patch

2069
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:43,480
coming out for it in November.

2070
01:41:43,480 --> 01:41:45,360
So there you go.

2071
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:46,960
Um, but freaking grandia.

2072
01:41:46,960 --> 01:41:47,960
Oh my God.

2073
01:41:47,960 --> 01:41:50,400
One of the best RPGs ever.

2074
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:51,880
I figured you'd like that news.

2075
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:53,080
Heck yeah.

2076
01:41:53,080 --> 01:41:58,000
And then, um, house of the dead one and two are both coming to the switch.

2077
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:04,520
Um, and it is being, uh, done by a Polish studio called forever entertainment and they're

2078
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:07,280
bringing us the gun games.

2079
01:42:07,460 --> 01:42:11,460
Hopefully it'll be nice and pretty in the higher definition.

2080
01:42:11,460 --> 01:42:17,860
So about how is it like, if it's coming to the switch, is it a touch screen?

2081
01:42:17,860 --> 01:42:22,620
I mean, don't to, to be determined.

2082
01:42:22,620 --> 01:42:26,820
We don't know if when, when something gets listed on a, you know, rating, it doesn't

2083
01:42:26,820 --> 01:42:27,820
make any sense.

2084
01:42:27,820 --> 01:42:28,820
Like, well, we don't know.

2085
01:42:28,820 --> 01:42:31,980
Maybe we get a specific gun and sensor for it.

2086
01:42:31,980 --> 01:42:32,980
Maybe.

2087
01:42:32,980 --> 01:42:33,980
Hooray.

2088
01:42:33,980 --> 01:42:36,500
Or maybe it's just something you were just going to use the stick to aim and do it that

2089
01:42:36,500 --> 01:42:37,500
way.

2090
01:42:37,500 --> 01:42:38,500
Oh, horrible.

2091
01:42:38,500 --> 01:42:42,260
I know, but it might, it might be having, uh, dark to see this is just joy con aiming.

2092
01:42:42,260 --> 01:42:46,000
Maybe you point the joy con and move it that way using the HD sensor or whatever.

2093
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:47,000
Who knows?

2094
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:48,000
We'll see.

2095
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,000
Yeah.

2096
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Yeah.

2097
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,000
All right.

2098
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Insert Marge Simpson noise here.

2099
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:53,000
All right.

2100
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:56,200
Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates.

2101
01:42:56,200 --> 01:43:00,160
Uh, what is coming out a little sooner than the questionable house of the dead remake

01:43:26,940 --> 01:43:27,940
Wow.

2108
01:43:27,940 --> 01:43:28,940
That's a name.

2109
01:43:28,940 --> 01:43:31,820
Uh, that is a name that's on PC.

2110
01:43:31,820 --> 01:43:38,300
Nintendo switch and PlayStation four one night stand on PlayStation four and X-Box one.

It's a visual novel season.

2113
01:43:41,580 --> 01:43:49,220
Apparently, um, we have a CSO Nia when they cry a phase one for you.

01:44:12,140 --> 01:44:13,140
All right.

2120
01:44:13,140 --> 01:44:17,460
Well, going over to Japan and checking out the releases there, um, PlayStation four kind

2121
01:44:17,460 --> 01:44:18,460
of slow this week.

2122
01:44:18,460 --> 01:44:23,580
The only real major release that I see on the Japanese realist is the, um, Tom Clancy

2123
01:44:23,580 --> 01:44:27,100
ghost recon break point, cause that's like a world wide release pretty much it's coming

2124
01:44:27,100 --> 01:44:28,100
out everywhere.

2125
01:44:28,100 --> 01:44:31,100
Um, and that is also a, no exception in Japan that is coming out over there.

2126
01:44:31,100 --> 01:44:35,100
Uh, I was trying to see if maybe there's a huge game on Nintendo switch this week.

2127
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:40,180
That is the reason why they're not putting out anything, um, really, uh, on the PlayStation

2128
01:44:40,180 --> 01:44:41,180
four.

2129
01:44:41,180 --> 01:44:45,040
But, uh, the biggest things I see is, uh, that there are some new Nintendo switch controllers

2130
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:46,040
in different colors.

2131
01:44:46,040 --> 01:44:48,700
I know some people are going to be one of like the purple and the orange, maybe.

2132
01:44:48,700 --> 01:44:51,900
Although I think a lot of that, I think a lot of those colors are releasing here.

2133
01:44:52,020 --> 01:44:54,500
Um, that is on the list for the switch this week.

2134
01:44:54,500 --> 01:44:59,980
Otherwise the only other big thing I see is the amnesia later, uh, cross crowd crowd for

2135
01:44:59,980 --> 01:45:05,220
Nintendo switch in a regular and limited edition, uh, and super robot wars V.

2136
01:45:05,220 --> 01:45:07,520
Those are really the only big releases this week in Japan.

2137
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:11,740
So, um, a bit of a slower week, all things considered, but there's a few things.

2138
01:45:11,740 --> 01:45:12,740
How about Europe?

2139
01:45:12,740 --> 01:45:13,740
Dark Sakura.

2140
01:45:13,740 --> 01:45:17,220
In Europe, we have a handful on the 30th.

2141
01:45:17,220 --> 01:45:22,860
We have ghost recon, break point, gold, ultimate edition, sniper elite three, ultimate edition.

2142
01:45:22,860 --> 01:45:29,940
Um, on October 3rd, we have Sega mega drive mini.

2143
01:45:29,940 --> 01:45:32,620
This is when it says Sega mega drive that fast.

2144
01:45:32,620 --> 01:45:35,900
I didn't realize it was so delayed for Europe because you know, the one here is out.

2145
01:45:35,900 --> 01:45:36,900
The Genesis one is out.

2146
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:41,100
Um, Ghostbusters, the video game remastered comes out.

2147
01:45:41,980 --> 01:45:48,340
Friday the 13th, the game ultimate slasher edition also comes out and ghost recon break

2148
01:45:48,340 --> 01:45:49,340
point.

2149
01:45:49,340 --> 01:45:55,300
Um, I guess the normal version is that on October 3rd.

2150
01:45:55,300 --> 01:45:56,300
Cool.

2151
01:45:56,300 --> 01:45:57,300
That's it.

2152
01:45:57,300 --> 01:46:02,060
All right, let's go to our mailbag.

2153
01:46:02,060 --> 01:46:06,680
Every week we invite your emails to participate at orange lounge radio.com and we read our

2154
01:46:06,680 --> 01:46:08,180
favorites here on the show.

2155
01:46:08,180 --> 01:46:09,980
My favorites are zero cause there aren't any.

2156
01:46:09,980 --> 01:46:11,940
There are no emails this week.

2157
01:46:11,940 --> 01:46:12,940
What a pity.

2158
01:46:12,940 --> 01:46:13,940
You know what this means?

2159
01:46:13,940 --> 01:46:14,940
Oh, that's right.

2160
01:46:14,940 --> 01:46:18,820
We get to do drag race talk, but there's no drag race airing right now.

2161
01:46:18,820 --> 01:46:20,460
They're doing drag race Canada.

2162
01:46:20,460 --> 01:46:21,460
Okay.

2163
01:46:21,460 --> 01:46:22,620
So I'll ask this question.

2164
01:46:22,620 --> 01:46:25,820
What do you think of all the, cause remember folks, when you don't send us emails, we have

2165
01:46:25,820 --> 01:46:29,020
no choice but to talk about RuPaul's drag race, Loki's favorite thing in the world.

2166
01:46:29,020 --> 01:46:31,600
Um, so what do you think about all these international versions?

2167
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:32,600
There's Canadian.

2168
01:46:32,600 --> 01:46:33,600
We're going to get Australian.

2169
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:34,600
UK.

2170
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:35,600
The UK is coming out soon.

2171
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:36,600
Thailand's great.

2172
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:37,600
Thailand's great.

2173
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:39,200
I'm, I'm going to be honest.

2174
01:46:39,200 --> 01:46:43,080
This is why I'm a little bit like, Oh yeah, that was the threat we made to the listeners.

2175
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:45,400
I'm kind of burned out on drag race.

2176
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:49,920
Like I don't like, I know they're making a season 12 and I'm so burned out.

2177
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:53,120
Like the time to do these international versions was six years ago.

2178
01:46:53,120 --> 01:46:54,120
Yeah.

2179
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:55,120
I don't know though.

2180
01:46:55,120 --> 01:46:59,320
I was kind of wanting to watch Dragula this season because they have a drag king on their

2181
01:46:59,320 --> 01:47:02,640
land and cider who I've seen perform a few times in LA.

2182
01:47:02,640 --> 01:47:03,640
Absolutely phenomenal.

2183
01:47:03,640 --> 01:47:04,640
Yeah.

2184
01:47:04,640 --> 01:47:08,940
But you know, that big thing went on about how misogynist the word fish is.

2185
01:47:08,940 --> 01:47:12,180
And just for anyone who does not know, you should cover Dragula.

2186
01:47:12,180 --> 01:47:16,540
I thought they talked about it, but some of my local queen buddies were talking about

2187
01:47:16,540 --> 01:47:22,900
it that, you know, typically in drag, the word fish is used to mean extremely feminine,

2188
01:47:22,900 --> 01:47:29,880
which comes from a derogatory about female anatomy and about certain odors that could

2189
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:31,700
come out of it.

2190
01:47:31,700 --> 01:47:37,300
And so basically you're calling femininity a smelly vagina.

2191
01:47:37,300 --> 01:47:41,060
And that in and of itself is highly misogynist.

2192
01:47:41,060 --> 01:47:42,060
Stop it.

2193
01:47:42,060 --> 01:47:47,740
At any rate, there's been, I had to block a couple of the, um, the Bay Area Queens over

2194
01:47:47,740 --> 01:47:54,300
it because they just didn't get it like, Oh, well, but I have a shrine to femininity and

2195
01:47:54,300 --> 01:47:57,620
um, yeah, so you're objectifying us then, right?

2196
01:47:57,620 --> 01:48:04,260
We're just something to have in a shrine and not to actually, I have a fish friend.

2197
01:48:04,260 --> 01:48:06,100
Our fish died this week.

2198
01:48:06,100 --> 01:48:07,100
I'm sorry to hear that.

2199
01:48:07,100 --> 01:48:12,580
Well, I say our, because it was basically the kid's fish, but I had to take care of

2200
01:48:12,580 --> 01:48:13,580
it.

2201
01:48:13,580 --> 01:48:14,580
You had to flush it down the toilet.

2202
01:48:14,580 --> 01:48:15,580
What kind of fish was it?

2203
01:48:15,580 --> 01:48:16,580
Oh, I just threw it away.

2204
01:48:16,580 --> 01:48:17,580
Oh, that's sad.

2205
01:48:17,580 --> 01:48:18,580
What kind of fish?

2206
01:48:18,580 --> 01:48:19,580
It was a beta.

2207
01:48:19,580 --> 01:48:20,580
Oh, okay.

2208
01:48:20,580 --> 01:48:21,580
Let's buy another one.

2209
01:48:21,580 --> 01:48:22,580
Anyway.

2210
01:48:22,580 --> 01:48:26,840
Um, the thing about Dragula, I don't like, I think it's very stylish and I like that

2211
01:48:26,840 --> 01:48:27,840
style of drag.

2212
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:28,840
I think it's really fun.

2213
01:48:28,840 --> 01:48:31,540
I think those extermination challenges are the stupidest thing in the world.

2214
01:48:31,540 --> 01:48:32,540
They're too much.

2215
01:48:32,540 --> 01:48:33,540
They have nothing to do with drag.

2216
01:48:33,540 --> 01:48:35,060
I don't, it ruins the show for me.

2217
01:48:35,060 --> 01:48:38,820
So anyway, yeah, that's it though.

2218
01:48:38,820 --> 01:48:42,340
But I do think it's rad that Dragula has more variety in the performers.

2219
01:48:42,340 --> 01:48:43,340
That's pretty cool.

2220
01:48:43,340 --> 01:48:44,820
See what happens when we talk about fish and the cat cones.

2221
01:48:44,820 --> 01:48:51,420
I know it's like, it's like Mr. Smoosh got fish for me, chicken, chicken, no, now he's

2222
01:48:51,420 --> 01:48:52,420
just scratching his back.

2223
01:48:52,420 --> 01:48:53,420
All right.

2224
01:48:53,420 --> 01:48:54,420
Anyway, let's move on.

2225
01:48:54,420 --> 01:48:57,540
Uh, let's talk about, uh, more news.

2226
01:48:57,540 --> 01:49:00,380
We're going to get to, uh, Loki with another story for us.

2227
01:49:00,380 --> 01:49:01,420
All right.

2228
01:49:01,420 --> 01:49:07,140
So, uh, we talked a little bit about, like I said, the whole PlayStation event, and now

2229
01:49:07,140 --> 01:49:11,900
we're going to talk about the, uh, after the state of play, there was a whole Microsoft

2230
01:49:11,900 --> 01:49:14,100
inside Xbox presentation.

2231
01:49:14,100 --> 01:49:17,860
So stuff that they talked about then, of course, um, Xbox game pass came up.

2232
01:49:17,860 --> 01:49:22,140
So they talked about new games that are going to be coming out on Xbox game pass, including

2233
01:49:22,140 --> 01:49:26,300
Jump Force, Bloodstained, Ritual of the Night, and Lego worlds are being added on the Xbox

2234
01:49:26,300 --> 01:49:27,420
one side.

2235
01:49:27,420 --> 01:49:33,860
And then on PC, Cities Skylines, Saints Row IV, and Bad North, and Dirt Rally 2.0.

2236
01:49:33,860 --> 01:49:40,020
They said that the Xbox games app or pass app has been updated as well with some additional

2237
01:49:40,020 --> 01:49:45,180
improvements, including, uh, they said there's going to be more indie games coming to games

2238
01:49:45,180 --> 01:49:52,160
pass, including Genesis Noir, Lonely Mountain Downhill, and Demons Tilt.

2239
01:49:52,160 --> 01:49:53,660
And then what else?

2240
01:49:54,660 --> 01:50:00,980
There's going to be a brand new, um, game comedy puzzle game called Felix the Reaper

2241
01:50:00,980 --> 01:50:05,740
that's going to be available on October 17th, available on game pass that day as well.

2242
01:50:05,740 --> 01:50:09,900
They talked a little bit about Project xCloud, their streaming service that's going to be

2243
01:50:09,900 --> 01:50:11,100
available soon.

2244
01:50:11,100 --> 01:50:16,700
So apparently if you're in the US, UK, or Korea, you can apply to be able to test that

2245
01:50:16,700 --> 01:50:17,700
out.

2246
01:50:17,700 --> 01:50:22,940
And so if you have an Android device and a wireless Xbox one controller, you can sign

2247
01:50:22,940 --> 01:50:29,620
up to preview it and, um, so I will have to check it out except I don't have a wireless

2248
01:50:29,620 --> 01:50:33,100
Xbox one controller, although I could use another controller.

2249
01:50:33,100 --> 01:50:35,860
So might as well pick that up and maybe sign up for that.

2250
01:50:35,860 --> 01:50:42,340
Um, and then of course, early access for, uh, or the, there's the game Atlas that was

2251
01:50:42,340 --> 01:50:44,780
a pirate MMO game that was on steam early access.

2252
01:50:44,780 --> 01:50:50,660
That's coming to Xbox one on October 8th, and it's also going to be available simultaneously

2253
01:50:50,660 --> 01:50:53,200
on Xbox and PC.

2254
01:50:53,200 --> 01:50:58,620
I'm assuming, um, they're going to have the same game on both platforms.

2255
01:50:58,620 --> 01:51:04,940
And then there's a brand new Xbox one X and Xbox one S hardware bundles that include Forza

2256
01:51:04,940 --> 01:51:09,400
horizon four and the Lego speed champions expansion.

2257
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:10,700
So that's about it.

2258
01:51:10,700 --> 01:51:11,700
I liked it.

2259
01:51:11,700 --> 01:51:12,700
That was time.

2260
01:51:12,700 --> 01:51:13,700
The same day as Sony's thing.

2261
01:51:13,700 --> 01:51:17,140
I'm sure that was completely coincidental and not intentional.

2262
01:51:17,140 --> 01:51:21,900
One bit, uh, she hold 10 in our chat over at Twitch TV slash VOG network says Xbox is

2263
01:51:21,900 --> 01:51:24,920
working hard or excuse me, Xbox is really working hard.

2264
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:26,100
It will pay off soon.

2265
01:51:26,100 --> 01:51:29,540
You know, I do think the cloud thing is going to be very interesting.

2266
01:51:29,540 --> 01:51:33,580
I'm really curious to see how that's going to change up Microsoft's landscape.

2267
01:51:33,580 --> 01:51:38,940
I feel like I'm, I'm definitely personally and more excited about what Xbox is doing

2268
01:51:38,940 --> 01:51:42,740
with that and Microsoft, I guess with the cloud then maybe like Google stadium.

2269
01:51:42,740 --> 01:51:47,500
So does that X cloud stuff tie in with, is that only games that you own or is that like

2270
01:51:47,500 --> 01:51:53,980
if I have Xbox game pass and I have X cloud, then I also get access to all those games

2271
01:51:53,980 --> 01:51:58,240
and I can play them streaming cause that I could see would be very interesting, especially

2272
01:51:58,240 --> 01:52:00,140
with all the deals that they had with that.

2273
01:52:00,140 --> 01:52:01,140
Yeah.

2274
01:52:01,140 --> 01:52:02,460
Um, that may be worth it.

2275
01:52:02,460 --> 01:52:03,460
Yeah.

2276
01:52:03,460 --> 01:52:06,940
I would love if I don't have to do these huge downloads to do things on game pass anymore.

2277
01:52:06,940 --> 01:52:09,180
Like maybe I can just fire up gears five on the cloud.

2278
01:52:09,180 --> 01:52:12,220
I might be more inclined to test it out and see if it's something I would like want to

2279
01:52:12,220 --> 01:52:13,220
download.

2280
01:52:13,220 --> 01:52:14,220
Yeah.

2281
01:52:14,220 --> 01:52:15,500
So it'd be very curious to see how that all kind of comes together in the next couple

2282
01:52:15,500 --> 01:52:16,500
of months.

2283
01:52:16,500 --> 01:52:17,500
Yeah.

2284
01:52:17,500 --> 01:52:18,500
Okay.

2285
01:52:18,500 --> 01:52:19,500
Cause it's like October is supposed to be the launch month for this, right?

2286
01:52:19,500 --> 01:52:24,500
Or at least at the beta or like the preview or whatever they're calling it, it'd be interesting.

2287
01:52:24,500 --> 01:52:25,500
Excited for it.

2288
01:52:25,500 --> 01:52:26,500
All right.

2289
01:52:26,500 --> 01:52:29,580
Well, I'm also excited for an updated version of bloodstained.

2290
01:52:29,580 --> 01:52:30,580
That's right.

2291
01:52:30,580 --> 01:52:34,740
Bloodstained is going to be getting a switch update and it's been delayed and there's been

2292
01:52:34,740 --> 01:52:35,740
apologies.

2293
01:52:35,740 --> 01:52:38,940
And you know, the switch version, which is the version I have of bloodstain has some

2294
01:52:38,940 --> 01:52:41,780
problems that ended up getting apologized for.

2295
01:52:41,780 --> 01:52:46,100
There was supposed to be several small updates, but then there was a big one that got delayed

2296
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:47,220
and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

2297
01:52:47,220 --> 01:52:52,340
So they're saying that the new patch will be focusing on four areas, visual fidelity,

2298
01:52:52,340 --> 01:52:55,500
loading times, particle effects, and input lag.

2299
01:52:55,500 --> 01:52:57,700
And they really get into the weeds of this.

2300
01:52:57,700 --> 01:53:01,540
I'm not going to get into all the, you know, details, but they are working on it.

2301
01:53:01,540 --> 01:53:06,040
They're going to be doling out two updates and the first will sport the vast majority

2302
01:53:06,040 --> 01:53:07,040
of changes.

2303
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:08,980
The second will improve performance.

2304
01:53:08,980 --> 01:53:15,700
So they are saying the goal is the end of November, assuming that there is no further

2305
01:53:15,700 --> 01:53:16,700
delay.

2306
01:53:16,700 --> 01:53:19,060
It should be noted that the game is not even out in Japan yet.

2307
01:53:19,060 --> 01:53:24,340
So October 24th is when the game is supposed to come out in Japan.

2308
01:53:24,340 --> 01:53:30,140
The Xbox edition is going to be getting some extra stuff, some DLC, a balance update and

2309
01:53:30,140 --> 01:53:32,600
some HDR fixes and so forth.

2310
01:53:32,600 --> 01:53:38,940
So there's still much more to come with bloodstained, but it should be pointed out that Igarashi

2311
01:53:38,940 --> 01:53:44,780
is still planning on making bloodstained a series in an interview with Game Informer

2312
01:53:44,780 --> 01:53:49,120
because, you know, I know we heard about the cutbacks, but there at least is still like

2313
01:53:49,120 --> 01:53:51,080
one or two more issues of Game Informer.

2314
01:53:51,080 --> 01:53:57,560
So Game Informer had an interview with Igarashi who talked about the pressure of Kickstarter

2315
01:53:57,560 --> 01:54:01,620
and so forth, because that's how the game was funded years ago, right?

2316
01:54:01,620 --> 01:54:03,600
Because it was years ago.

2317
01:54:03,600 --> 01:54:07,300
So anyway, quality control, he said was the hardest part.

2318
01:54:07,300 --> 01:54:10,420
When you're working with an outsourced studio, it can be difficult to match the quality line

2319
01:54:10,420 --> 01:54:11,740
when things changed.

2320
01:54:11,740 --> 01:54:15,100
With bloodstained, we would first share our goal with the outsourced studio and make sure

2321
01:54:15,100 --> 01:54:19,340
we both agree and determine the necessities, but even with proper planning, it's difficult

2322
01:54:19,340 --> 01:54:20,420
to reach.

2323
01:54:20,420 --> 01:54:25,260
So anyway, he does say that bloodstained is a starting ground for the next step and wants

2324
01:54:25,260 --> 01:54:28,740
to make a series after putting in the effort with this.

2325
01:54:28,740 --> 01:54:32,540
So we'll see if maybe there's going to be a bloodstained 2 or something else, maybe

2326
01:54:32,540 --> 01:54:35,220
in the same universe, maybe just not the same name.

2327
01:54:35,220 --> 01:54:36,220
Bring back my dude.

2328
01:54:36,220 --> 01:54:37,220
Who knows?

2329
01:54:37,220 --> 01:54:39,180
Bring back my dude.

2330
01:54:39,180 --> 01:54:41,860
Fifth Dream today in chat says, I'm mad about the Switch screw up.

2331
01:54:41,860 --> 01:54:45,140
They're delaying all the DLC I paid for and the Kickstarter to fix it.

2332
01:54:45,140 --> 01:54:48,620
So well, I'm glad that they are delaying DLC.

2333
01:54:48,620 --> 01:54:50,060
I'm glad they're fixing it.

2334
01:54:50,060 --> 01:54:53,140
You know, you know, not every company always fixes.

2335
01:54:53,140 --> 01:54:54,140
I get.

2336
01:54:54,140 --> 01:54:55,140
But like, you know what I'm saying?

2337
01:54:55,140 --> 01:54:56,140
Not necessarily that.

2338
01:54:56,140 --> 01:55:00,860
Yeah, it sucks that your DLC is being delayed, but I'm glad they're focusing on the fixes

2339
01:55:00,860 --> 01:55:04,660
versus the DLC like some other studios.

2340
01:55:04,660 --> 01:55:05,660
Trying to get more money first.

2341
01:55:05,660 --> 01:55:06,660
Yeah, I get it.

2342
01:55:06,660 --> 01:55:07,660
I get it.

2343
01:55:07,660 --> 01:55:08,660
So.

2344
01:55:08,660 --> 01:55:09,660
Cool.

2345
01:55:09,660 --> 01:55:12,720
I still need to sit down and really play the game more.

2346
01:55:12,720 --> 01:55:15,300
But when I heard they were going to fix the Switch version, I was like, well, let me just

2347
01:55:15,300 --> 01:55:16,740
wait till the fix comes out then.

2348
01:55:16,740 --> 01:55:19,180
I mean, I've waited this long to play bloodstained.

2349
01:55:19,180 --> 01:55:20,180
What's another couple of months?

2350
01:55:20,180 --> 01:55:21,180
Right.

2351
01:55:21,180 --> 01:55:22,180
I'd love to see you in chat.

2352
01:55:22,180 --> 01:55:24,180
The PS4 version is really good.

2353
01:55:24,180 --> 01:55:25,180
Was that?

2354
01:55:25,180 --> 01:55:28,100
The PS4 one is pretty, pretty good.

2355
01:55:28,100 --> 01:55:29,100
That's cool.

2356
01:55:29,100 --> 01:55:30,100
Yeah.

2357
01:55:30,100 --> 01:55:32,420
Looking back, I probably should have got a different console or something, but I don't

2358
01:55:32,420 --> 01:55:33,420
know.

2359
01:55:33,420 --> 01:55:34,420
I love my Switch.

2360
01:55:35,180 --> 01:55:38,140
At least they're trying to avoid another Mighty No. 9 situation.

2361
01:55:38,140 --> 01:55:39,140
Yeah, they are.

2362
01:55:39,140 --> 01:55:40,860
So at least there's that.

2363
01:55:40,860 --> 01:55:41,860
All right.

2364
01:55:41,860 --> 01:55:43,180
Let's move on to another story.

2365
01:55:43,180 --> 01:55:46,620
Speaking of things on the Nintendo Switch, right, DarkSakura?

2366
01:55:46,620 --> 01:55:47,620
Right.

2367
01:55:47,620 --> 01:55:52,500
So the original Yokai Watch, which I hate how they put the hyphen in it.

2368
01:55:52,500 --> 01:55:55,460
The word doesn't need a hyphen or whatever.

2369
01:55:55,460 --> 01:56:01,900
Anyway, Yokai Watch, the very original one, is going to be coming on to the Switch.

2370
01:56:01,900 --> 01:56:08,420
And there is a second trailer up for it now on the official YouTube channel, and they're

2371
01:56:08,420 --> 01:56:10,900
getting online battle support.

2372
01:56:10,900 --> 01:56:15,620
And so this is looking like it's going to give you quite a bit more about the original

2373
01:56:15,620 --> 01:56:16,620
Yokai Watch.

2374
01:56:16,620 --> 01:56:20,440
I mean, there's not really much else to say because it's Yokai Watch, but it's nice for

2375
01:56:20,440 --> 01:56:26,780
people who might not have had the experience of playing it when it came out.

2376
01:56:26,780 --> 01:56:35,220
Of course, the trailer for it is in Japanese, but hopefully we'll be getting an English

2377
01:56:35,220 --> 01:56:37,860
version for fans of the series.

2378
01:56:37,860 --> 01:56:39,860
So it looks pretty good though.

2379
01:56:39,860 --> 01:56:44,080
I mean, nice and clean, and looks like it could be fun.

2380
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:48,300
So there you go, Yokai Watch.

2381
01:56:48,300 --> 01:56:49,300
So anyway.

2382
01:56:49,300 --> 01:56:56,500
All right, so something that came out of State of Play, the PlayStation event, was some more

2383
01:56:56,500 --> 01:57:01,980
details on Call of Duty Modern Warfare, which is releasing here pretty soon.

2384
01:57:01,980 --> 01:57:09,620
And one thing that they announced is, unfortunately, that the Modern Warfare survival mode, part

2385
01:57:09,620 --> 01:57:15,840
of the spec ops thing, is going to be exclusive on the PlayStation 4 until October 1st, 2020.

2386
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:22,180
So if you're looking to play that part of spec or special ops, you're going to have

2387
01:57:22,180 --> 01:57:26,000
to buy it on PlayStation or wait a whole year for the brand new Call of Duty game to come

2388
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:31,360
out and then they'll release that on there.

2389
01:57:31,360 --> 01:57:38,160
Of course, there's been some backlash regarding it, but according to the developers, they're

2390
01:57:38,160 --> 01:57:42,880
saying that, well, it's only like 1% of the game, to which I said, well, if it's only

2391
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:47,660
1% of the game, then why lock it as a console exclusive feature then if it's not such a

2392
01:57:47,660 --> 01:57:48,660
big deal?

2393
01:57:48,660 --> 01:57:49,660
Obviously.

2394
01:57:49,660 --> 01:57:53,000
But you personally would pick up these games on PS4 anyway, right?

2395
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:54,840
Yeah, or PC.

2396
01:57:54,840 --> 01:57:55,840
I don't know.

2397
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:56,840
Depends.

2398
01:57:56,840 --> 01:58:02,520
So, yeah, probably on PlayStation 4, but I'd only really care.

2399
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:03,520
It's the whole...

2400
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:05,320
Yeah, I get it.

2401
01:58:05,320 --> 01:58:09,520
It's a very Activision thing to do.

2402
01:58:09,520 --> 01:58:13,680
Maybe that should just be like a trademark, a saying, it's an Activision thing to do.

2403
01:58:13,680 --> 01:58:14,680
Yeah.

2404
01:58:14,680 --> 01:58:16,800
So I, yeah, I don't know.

2405
01:58:16,800 --> 01:58:19,040
But that must be, what did they get in exchange for that?

2406
01:58:19,040 --> 01:58:21,120
They get like free ad dollars promotion.

2407
01:58:21,120 --> 01:58:28,340
They probably get more featuring on the PlayStation store, which I'm sure a lot of people just

2408
01:58:28,340 --> 01:58:30,040
impulse buy things like that.

2409
01:58:30,040 --> 01:58:34,360
They see the ad for it and just push X to spend money and they do it if they're a fan

2410
01:58:34,360 --> 01:58:35,360
of the series.

2411
01:58:35,360 --> 01:58:39,440
And I don't know if that necessarily is going to be a big push for that, but it still kind

2412
01:58:39,440 --> 01:58:43,920
of sucks that you feel like you're not really getting a full game on other platforms.

2413
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:44,920
Right.

2414
01:58:44,920 --> 01:58:45,920
All right.

2415
01:58:45,920 --> 01:58:50,480
Well, before we get to some Discord calls, if you want to be on the show, head on over

2416
01:58:50,480 --> 01:58:54,360
to our green room at our Discord server, vognetwork.com slash Discord.

2417
01:58:54,360 --> 01:58:56,840
That's vognetwork.com slash Discord.

2418
01:58:56,840 --> 01:59:00,120
If you want to be on the show, or you can ask some questions in our chat room as well

2419
01:59:00,120 --> 01:59:03,040
over at twitch.tv slash vognetwork.

2420
01:59:03,040 --> 01:59:08,200
But before we get to that, we have one more story tonight and it's another yikes involving

2421
01:59:08,200 --> 01:59:10,560
the game Fallout 76.

2422
01:59:10,560 --> 01:59:15,420
Just when you thought it was over with all the yikes things going on with Fallout 76.

2423
01:59:15,420 --> 01:59:18,800
This actually has nothing to do with the game itself.

2424
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:24,680
It has to do with the collectible edition of the game, the $150 collectible issue of

2425
01:59:24,680 --> 01:59:25,680
the game.

2426
01:59:25,680 --> 01:59:31,300
A recall was issued by the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission for the power armor

2427
01:59:31,300 --> 01:59:36,280
helmet for Fallout 76 sold exclusively by GameStop, as if they haven't had enough bad

2428
01:59:36,280 --> 01:59:37,280
news.

2429
01:59:37,280 --> 01:59:38,960
Well, technically it's not the collector's edition of the game.

2430
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:41,520
It was a collectible helmet that they released.

2431
01:59:41,520 --> 01:59:46,680
They did have now the two, you know, not to get it confused with the helmet that did come

2432
01:59:46,680 --> 01:59:47,680
with the collectors.

2433
01:59:48,560 --> 01:59:54,000
But it's a, it's another helmet that was also collectible that they were selling it games

2434
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:55,000
up.

2435
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:56,000
I see.

2436
01:59:56,000 --> 02:00:01,160
So anyhow, noted on the website, which you can see yourself because it is a government

2437
02:00:01,160 --> 02:00:07,400
website at, I think it's cpsc.gov and you can see this for yourself.

2438
02:00:07,400 --> 02:00:11,560
The fabric insert used for the helmet may contain mold.

2439
02:00:11,560 --> 02:00:17,080
And if you have a compromised immune system that could be trouble or allergies, even just

2440
02:00:17,080 --> 02:00:21,600
allergies, because depending on how bad they are, I mean, it could close air passages and

2441
02:00:21,600 --> 02:00:22,600
all that too.

2442
02:00:22,600 --> 02:00:23,600
So yikes.

2443
02:00:23,600 --> 02:00:28,340
Now, uh, and a quick follow up to this story running around the internet Chronicle collectibles

2444
02:00:28,340 --> 02:00:34,080
who made this helmet did want to clarify the only affected units are the Nuka Cola branded

2445
02:00:34,080 --> 02:00:36,020
red helmets.

2446
02:00:36,020 --> 02:00:39,640
Only 32 units were actually reported as being sold.

2447
02:00:39,640 --> 02:00:40,640
I'm sorry.

2448
02:00:40,640 --> 02:00:41,640
I'm sorry.

2449
02:00:41,640 --> 02:00:51,640
Well, then I guess it's not such a big deal now that I think of it only, only 32 units.

2450
02:00:51,640 --> 02:00:59,100
Only 32 of these were actually sold in the entire fucking country, 32 were sold.

2451
02:00:59,100 --> 02:01:04,520
And apparently the customers that were impacted have been reached any other power armor helmets.

2452
02:01:04,520 --> 02:01:07,640
Cause I guess there's other types were not recalled.

2453
02:01:07,640 --> 02:01:15,320
So to be fair, they may have sold more of them, but of this particular brand, they sold

2454
02:01:15,320 --> 02:01:19,640
32.

2455
02:01:19,640 --> 02:01:23,280
There's that many people watching on Twitch currently.

2456
02:01:23,280 --> 02:01:25,160
Congratulations.

2457
02:01:25,160 --> 02:01:30,680
We make up the entire population of the world of who bought this collectible.

2458
02:01:30,680 --> 02:01:33,040
Oh boy.

2459
02:01:33,040 --> 02:01:35,040
Fifth dream today just does want to point out.

2460
02:01:35,040 --> 02:01:37,400
It's only if you wear it, lol.

2461
02:01:37,400 --> 02:01:40,680
Thour 66 says, at least it's not radiation.

2462
02:01:40,680 --> 02:01:41,680
That's true.

2463
02:01:41,680 --> 02:01:43,320
Uh, here's the thing though.

2464
02:01:43,320 --> 02:01:47,920
It's just one of those things where like, like, again, I hate to dog pile on this game,

2465
02:01:47,920 --> 02:01:52,160
but you know, there's a lot of questionable stuff with this game to be, it's just like

2466
02:01:52,160 --> 02:01:57,020
another one of those things where it's just like, here's another one, even though it was

2467
02:01:57,020 --> 02:01:59,720
only 32 units, it's still like, it's mold.

2468
02:01:59,720 --> 02:02:00,720
It's gross.

2469
02:02:00,720 --> 02:02:04,480
People don't like to hear that their products that they paid $150 for have mold, whether

2470
02:02:04,480 --> 02:02:06,200
there's only 32 people or not.

2471
02:02:06,200 --> 02:02:09,320
So it's just, wow.

2472
02:02:09,320 --> 02:02:11,840
Anyway, let's move on.

2473
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:15,080
Let's see if we have anybody in our discord server that wants to give us a call.

2474
02:02:15,080 --> 02:02:16,440
I actually have some good news.

2475
02:02:16,440 --> 02:02:17,440
Uh, sure.

2476
02:02:17,440 --> 02:02:19,720
Go for it while I get our discord service set up here.

2477
02:02:19,720 --> 02:02:24,000
One of our dear friends and listeners, um, who we haven't probably heard from in a little

2478
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:29,960
while has been kind enough to arrange me to get the links awakening Slurpee cups from

2479
02:02:29,960 --> 02:02:30,960
Canada.

2480
02:02:30,960 --> 02:02:31,960
Oh yeah.

2481
02:02:31,960 --> 02:02:34,680
I was seeing some of this exchange on like Twitter or Facebook or something.

2482
02:02:34,680 --> 02:02:36,120
Hopefully it will arrive soon.

2483
02:02:36,120 --> 02:02:41,120
It was mailed out on Tuesday, so I'm doing the happy dance cause I want my Zelda cups

2484
02:02:41,120 --> 02:02:44,520
to stay in.

2485
02:02:44,520 --> 02:02:45,520
Okay.

2486
02:02:45,520 --> 02:02:48,640
Uh, you were saying, you were saying something else about Slurpees in our chat.

2487
02:02:48,640 --> 02:02:53,100
Like I guess yes, black cherry Slurpee and it's black.

2488
02:02:53,100 --> 02:02:54,360
It's goth as fuck.

2489
02:02:54,360 --> 02:02:55,880
Does that mean it makes your tongue black too?

2490
02:02:55,880 --> 02:02:57,960
I hope so.

2491
02:02:57,960 --> 02:03:00,840
I want everyone to see my deathly power from the inside.

2492
02:03:00,840 --> 02:03:02,840
The black is actually mold.

2493
02:03:03,560 --> 02:03:07,840
No black cherry deliciousness flavor and he makes that with the Coke though.

2494
02:03:07,840 --> 02:03:09,840
You know, and we'll tell you how to mix it with Coke.

2495
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:13,720
All right, well we do have a call waiting in the green room to come on the show and

2496
02:03:13,720 --> 02:03:17,340
I knew this actually somebody that wanted to come on tonight to talk about something

2497
02:03:17,340 --> 02:03:19,080
a little, I thought this was kind of unique.

2498
02:03:19,080 --> 02:03:21,160
So hi, you're on orange on radio.

2499
02:03:21,160 --> 02:03:22,160
Who's this?

2500
02:03:22,160 --> 02:03:23,160
That's Shane.

2501
02:03:23,160 --> 02:03:25,360
Hey Shane, welcome back to OLR.

2502
02:03:25,360 --> 02:03:26,360
You've been on the show.

2503
02:03:26,360 --> 02:03:27,360
It's only been a week.

2504
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:28,360
I know, right?

2505
02:03:28,360 --> 02:03:30,240
Like you've been calling a lot lately.

2506
02:03:30,240 --> 02:03:31,520
How's how's things been with you?

2507
02:03:31,520 --> 02:03:32,520
Things happen.

2508
02:03:32,520 --> 02:03:33,520
What?

2509
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:34,520
Fine.

2510
02:03:34,520 --> 02:03:37,480
I said, well, a lot has like things keep happening that make me call.

2511
02:03:37,480 --> 02:03:38,480
So

2512
02:03:38,480 --> 02:03:39,480
Well, what do you want to talk about tonight?

2513
02:03:39,480 --> 02:03:41,680
Cause I think this, you told me a little bit about this beforehand.

2514
02:03:41,680 --> 02:03:42,680
I thought it was interesting.

2515
02:03:42,680 --> 02:03:43,680
So

2516
02:03:43,680 --> 02:03:44,680
yes.

2517
02:03:44,680 --> 02:03:50,360
So there is, I'm sure there are other ones, but we just found out about a virtual reality

2518
02:03:50,360 --> 02:03:55,560
gym here where we live and it's kind of interesting.

2519
02:03:55,560 --> 02:03:56,560
Okay.

2520
02:03:56,560 --> 02:03:58,700
So it's called black box VR.

2521
02:03:58,700 --> 02:04:03,580
First of all, it only has two locations according to the website, one in San Francisco and one

2522
02:04:03,580 --> 02:04:04,800
in Boise.

2523
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:09,240
That's it, which is just really random.

2524
02:04:09,240 --> 02:04:13,080
But in it, it's you play a game basically.

2525
02:04:13,080 --> 02:04:18,140
And all the like attacks and stuff you do are different types of workouts.

2526
02:04:18,140 --> 02:04:27,160
Like some are rowing, some are chest presses, some are squats and the game is like a MOBA.

2527
02:04:27,160 --> 02:04:32,940
So you can send out units, your computer opponent will send out units and there's like an elemental

2528
02:04:32,940 --> 02:04:38,540
wheel and you can pick units to send out and you have to do to send out a unit.

2529
02:04:38,540 --> 02:04:44,640
You have to like do different like punches, just quickly for the Twitch people were playing

2530
02:04:44,640 --> 02:04:46,280
their little commercial.

2531
02:04:46,280 --> 02:04:49,260
That is the best kind of thing that you can sort of see it in action, like how this whole

2532
02:04:49,260 --> 02:04:50,260
thing works.

2533
02:04:50,260 --> 02:04:51,260
Yeah.

2534
02:04:51,260 --> 02:04:52,260
But it is their commercial.

2535
02:04:52,260 --> 02:04:54,320
That is pretty cool.

2536
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:56,340
And yeah, it's, it's a lot of fun.

2537
02:04:56,340 --> 02:05:02,220
In fact, I kind of forget that I'm working out except I get tired so quick because I

2538
02:05:02,220 --> 02:05:04,820
hate working out.

2539
02:05:04,820 --> 02:05:08,920
But you've got like two force fields on the side of your crystal and they have two force

2540
02:05:08,920 --> 02:05:13,500
fields and you basically have to break down at least one of the force fields using these

2541
02:05:13,500 --> 02:05:19,220
different workouts in order to attack the crystal and if you break their crystal, then

2542
02:05:19,220 --> 02:05:21,780
you win that round.

2543
02:05:21,780 --> 02:05:27,060
And it goes for about three rounds per person you fight, but they'll send out different

2544
02:05:27,060 --> 02:05:29,720
types of units that have different elements attached.

2545
02:05:29,720 --> 02:05:37,820
So you have to counter them and it's, it's a lot of fun and I really can't stress how

2546
02:05:37,820 --> 02:05:39,860
awesome it is.

2547
02:05:39,860 --> 02:05:47,060
All I gotta say though, just normally playing VR stuff and then watching that last, the

2548
02:05:47,060 --> 02:05:54,100
last seconds of that clip where he's wiping his sweat off of his brow, I hope they disinfect

2549
02:05:54,100 --> 02:05:56,460
those headsets pretty well.

2550
02:05:56,460 --> 02:05:59,980
I hope that there's like, I assume they do.

2551
02:05:59,980 --> 02:06:06,140
They're not sparing any expense it feels like because they're using Vive Pros and they have

2552
02:06:06,140 --> 02:06:11,040
little things that attach to your hands and they have this like box once you're done that

2553
02:06:11,040 --> 02:06:15,700
like sanitizes everything and you keep the little wristbands but not the attachments

2554
02:06:15,700 --> 02:06:16,700
that go on them.

2555
02:06:16,700 --> 02:06:19,020
They give you a headband.

2556
02:06:19,020 --> 02:06:20,220
It's pricey though.

2557
02:06:20,220 --> 02:06:24,980
We're doing a 30 day free trial right now, but they've, I guess they're pretty new because

2558
02:06:24,980 --> 02:06:29,580
they've kind of fluctuated in price and they're still taking feedback to send to their engineers

2559
02:06:29,580 --> 02:06:32,880
on like, well this is too hard or this isn't working right.

2560
02:06:32,880 --> 02:06:39,340
But like for a 30 day membership where you go as much as you want, it's like $240.

2561
02:06:39,340 --> 02:06:45,420
Yeah, but it's been jumping around in price because I guess when they started it was over

2562
02:06:45,420 --> 02:06:46,700
$300.

2563
02:06:46,700 --> 02:06:53,260
So doing the 30 days is fine because we have unlimited for those 30 days.

2564
02:06:53,260 --> 02:06:57,460
And I don't know, Dustin really seems to like it and wants to continue it.

2565
02:06:57,460 --> 02:07:00,060
I'm like, that's pretty pricey, but it's fun.

2566
02:07:00,060 --> 02:07:06,420
There's an app, you unlock special rewards, you unlock new units to use, which is really

2567
02:07:06,420 --> 02:07:11,420
unlocking new workouts, which is terrible when you think of it that way.

2568
02:07:11,420 --> 02:07:17,100
But yeah, I did, I'm opening up my app right now, if it would load quicker.

2569
02:07:17,100 --> 02:07:20,540
Let me get some comments in chat while you get that ready.

2570
02:07:20,540 --> 02:07:23,220
You can take this home or do you do it at the gym?

2571
02:07:23,220 --> 02:07:28,140
You do it at a specialized location, but there's an app that you can track all your stats,

2572
02:07:28,140 --> 02:07:32,860
you set up your next appointment, you buy things with coins that you earn from playing.

2573
02:07:32,860 --> 02:07:36,020
I would just want something I could do at home.

2574
02:07:36,020 --> 02:07:40,620
Fifth Dream in chat had the exact same comment that Loki had, Oh man, I hope they wiped those

2575
02:07:40,620 --> 02:07:43,340
goggles down really well between customers.

2576
02:07:43,340 --> 02:07:46,380
Yeah, I'm pretty sure they do.

2577
02:07:46,380 --> 02:07:49,540
Thour66 says, I think this is coming in the Montreal area.

2578
02:07:49,540 --> 02:07:54,460
I read about it in the paper, but to be fair, this isn't the only type of VR gym thing that's

2579
02:07:54,460 --> 02:07:55,460
out there.

2580
02:07:55,460 --> 02:07:58,420
So it may be this, but it may be like a competing brand, right?

2581
02:07:58,420 --> 02:08:00,420
Yeah, probably.

2582
02:08:00,420 --> 02:08:06,940
So I pulled up my stats and just for today, for example, it tells me how many punches

2583
02:08:06,940 --> 02:08:09,380
I did, how many reps I did sets.

2584
02:08:10,300 --> 02:08:11,300
I don't know what volume is.

2585
02:08:11,300 --> 02:08:15,700
I should have asked, but whatever it is, I did 12,000 pounds of it.

2586
02:08:15,700 --> 02:08:20,580
And it also shows you your areas that you worked out the most per your session.

2587
02:08:20,580 --> 02:08:25,780
So like today I basically did just my back and then a little bit of my arms and my knees

2588
02:08:25,780 --> 02:08:27,420
were killing me from last time.

2589
02:08:27,420 --> 02:08:28,420
So I did no squats.

2590
02:08:28,420 --> 02:08:32,580
So I have zero in like that area on the graph here.

2591
02:08:32,580 --> 02:08:33,580
Yeah.

2592
02:08:33,580 --> 02:08:34,580
Yeah.

2593
02:08:34,580 --> 02:08:38,700
I'm not surprised that you're getting a heck of a workout when you're doing this though.

2594
02:08:38,700 --> 02:08:42,460
I mean, like watching all like the resistance, like those things in your arms, because even

2595
02:08:42,460 --> 02:08:46,360
just playing Beat Saber on my PlayStation VR, like I get tired.

2596
02:08:46,360 --> 02:08:50,980
My watch recognizes that as workout time when I'm playing it because my heart rate goes

2597
02:08:50,980 --> 02:08:52,940
so far up when I'm playing it.

2598
02:08:52,940 --> 02:08:56,660
So I mean, just like the VR gaming in general, I suppose it depends what you're playing.

2599
02:08:56,660 --> 02:08:59,940
Like if I'm just kind of chill in a no man's sky or Skyrim, I'm probably not.

2600
02:08:59,940 --> 02:09:04,020
I mean, I'm probably burning more calories than I am playing on a monitor.

2601
02:09:04,020 --> 02:09:07,620
But like even just like a music game like Beat Saber or that, that one game that feels

2602
02:09:07,620 --> 02:09:10,360
like you're rollerblading or whatever, like gets a lot of motion.

2603
02:09:10,360 --> 02:09:15,340
So it's like, I feel like a VR gym set up thing, which is very kind of like a modern

2604
02:09:15,340 --> 02:09:16,340
thing.

2605
02:09:16,340 --> 02:09:18,420
I mean, that just really like amps it up even further, you know?

2606
02:09:18,420 --> 02:09:21,660
Are those things weighted?

2607
02:09:21,660 --> 02:09:24,880
They do have some weight to them, but they are not actual.

2608
02:09:24,880 --> 02:09:29,140
Like they don't adjust in heaviness or weight or whatever.

2609
02:09:29,140 --> 02:09:30,780
They're just there for tracking.

2610
02:09:30,780 --> 02:09:35,180
I would want something that would hook up to a weight machine of some sort, because

2611
02:09:35,180 --> 02:09:37,740
I don't like straight up cardio.

2612
02:09:37,740 --> 02:09:40,620
Well, no, that's the thing.

2613
02:09:40,620 --> 02:09:45,100
So when Dustin plays, he's more focused on his workout.

2614
02:09:45,100 --> 02:09:49,340
So he's doing like the actual way to, you know, work out and doing everything right.

2615
02:09:49,340 --> 02:09:56,020
I just wanted to win, which is bad because so I was doing everything as fast.

2616
02:09:56,020 --> 02:09:58,940
Maybe I was doing everything as fast as I possibly could.

2617
02:09:58,940 --> 02:10:00,140
But in doing that.

2618
02:10:00,140 --> 02:10:01,140
Yeah.

2619
02:10:01,140 --> 02:10:03,520
OK, so I started out CrossFit, started out.

2620
02:10:03,520 --> 02:10:09,080
But the software and the equipment, when you're going really fast, when you say I'm doing

2621
02:10:09,080 --> 02:10:11,780
like really fast chest presses.

2622
02:10:11,780 --> 02:10:18,920
So the next time I grab the chest press orb and put it in the virtual slot to start it,

2623
02:10:18,920 --> 02:10:23,620
it actually ups the resistance to make it harder for me, because it saw me just like

2624
02:10:23,620 --> 02:10:27,000
blaze through these lighter reps of it.

2625
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:32,400
And so you actually get more weight the faster you go.

2626
02:10:32,400 --> 02:10:38,380
But there is, as we learned later, a little virtual button you can press to kind of tailor

2627
02:10:38,380 --> 02:10:39,380
how you want to do it.

2628
02:10:39,380 --> 02:10:44,740
So if you want to do lighter weight, but faster reps, you can hit that button and then start.

2629
02:10:44,740 --> 02:10:50,940
Or if you want to go really hard with heavy weight and fewer reps, you can hit that button

2630
02:10:50,940 --> 02:10:51,940
too.

2631
02:10:51,940 --> 02:10:53,160
How does it add resistance, though?

2632
02:10:53,160 --> 02:10:55,040
Is it hooked up to something else?

2633
02:10:55,040 --> 02:10:56,040
Yes.

2634
02:10:56,040 --> 02:10:59,720
So if you saw if the video was up, I don't know if it is.

2635
02:10:59,720 --> 02:11:03,080
I just saw the two people fake punching.

2636
02:11:03,080 --> 02:11:04,080
Okay.

2637
02:11:04,080 --> 02:11:14,160
So there is two hand straps that depending on your attack slash workout you're doing,

2638
02:11:14,160 --> 02:11:16,160
it actually raises and lowers.

2639
02:11:16,160 --> 02:11:22,820
So there's some sort of mechanics in that machine that communicate through the software

2640
02:11:22,820 --> 02:11:28,680
to add the weight for you, because it has to adjust the height of the handles.

2641
02:11:28,680 --> 02:11:29,680
Oh, I see.

2642
02:11:29,680 --> 02:11:32,840
It kicks out the back thing too, or the chest thing if you're facing it.

2643
02:11:32,840 --> 02:11:34,360
It's like a cable machine.

2644
02:11:34,360 --> 02:11:35,360
Yeah.

2645
02:11:35,360 --> 02:11:36,360
That's exactly what it is.

2646
02:11:36,360 --> 02:11:40,600
It's like the standing cable machine, but it looks like it adjusts it based on the difference.

2647
02:11:40,600 --> 02:11:41,600
Yeah.

2648
02:11:41,600 --> 02:11:43,000
I've used the cable machines at the gym a lot.

2649
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:44,000
I mean, I totally do that.

2650
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:45,000
Yeah.

2651
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:46,000
So to advise.

2652
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:47,000
Not for that kind of money.

2653
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:48,000
Yeah.

2654
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:49,060
Well, do the 30-day free thing.

2655
02:11:49,060 --> 02:11:52,200
And like I said, they're adjusting their prices, it seems, since they've been open.

2656
02:11:52,200 --> 02:11:53,200
It started higher.

2657
02:11:53,200 --> 02:11:54,200
It's going lower.

2658
02:11:54,200 --> 02:11:59,900
I assume it'll probably still go lower, because it wasn't really popular when we were there.

2659
02:11:59,900 --> 02:12:03,960
We were the only two people there out of the eight boxes they had.

2660
02:12:03,960 --> 02:12:06,880
So it's also a Sunday morning.

2661
02:12:06,880 --> 02:12:12,140
Questbuster in chat shares, the high pricing doesn't seem that unusual for VR-type attractions

2662
02:12:12,140 --> 02:12:13,200
from what I'm seeing.

2663
02:12:13,200 --> 02:12:17,800
The void charge, 30 per visit for adventure-oriented experiences.

2664
02:12:17,800 --> 02:12:18,800
You know what, though?

2665
02:12:18,800 --> 02:12:21,760
I think this is one of those things where it's just the technology is kind of expensive,

2666
02:12:21,760 --> 02:12:22,760
and it's new.

2667
02:12:23,320 --> 02:12:25,120
The industry's trying to figure itself out.

2668
02:12:25,120 --> 02:12:30,520
But I honestly think in 10 years, which sounds like a long time, but it's not, but in 10

2669
02:12:30,520 --> 02:12:35,440
years' time, this is the type of technology that will probably be in many more gyms.

2670
02:12:35,440 --> 02:12:37,320
It's not going to be a specialty gym.

2671
02:12:37,320 --> 02:12:41,320
It's going to be the type of thing you see at an established chain, like 24-hour fitness

2672
02:12:41,320 --> 02:12:44,240
or LA Fitness or whatever it is you have near you.

2673
02:12:44,240 --> 02:12:47,780
You're going to start to see this type of stuff like you would see a racquetball court

2674
02:12:47,780 --> 02:12:48,780
or something.

2675
02:12:48,780 --> 02:12:53,580
I think as the technology progresses, I think it'll probably be more accessible like that.

2676
02:12:53,580 --> 02:12:59,500
As long as it's still a game style, because even the worker today told us, yeah, there's

2677
02:12:59,500 --> 02:13:00,500
leagues.

2678
02:13:00,500 --> 02:13:04,580
Once you do your first two, which we've done now, once you do your third, you are actually

2679
02:13:04,580 --> 02:13:06,460
ranking up and ranking down.

2680
02:13:06,460 --> 02:13:09,420
And say you hate squats like I do.

2681
02:13:09,420 --> 02:13:18,040
Well, there is a person that you have to fight in the game who is weak to all the leg workouts.

2682
02:13:18,040 --> 02:13:20,680
So that's going to be fun.

2683
02:13:20,680 --> 02:13:21,680
Huh.

2684
02:13:21,680 --> 02:13:26,160
This sounds kind of up your alley too, Loki, because you could do laser tag basically.

2685
02:13:26,160 --> 02:13:27,160
You're kind of workout.

2686
02:13:27,160 --> 02:13:30,960
I mean, it's not VR, but it's still like you're doing an intense workout.

2687
02:13:30,960 --> 02:13:35,160
I do dream of a day when they, well, actually I take that back.

2688
02:13:35,160 --> 02:13:41,960
They do have, I think, I haven't played it in the Disneyland, downtown Disney area or

2689
02:13:41,960 --> 02:13:42,960
whatever.

2690
02:13:42,960 --> 02:13:46,960
They do have a VR place that is sort of like laser tag, but it's like PVE stuff.

2691
02:13:46,960 --> 02:13:49,600
You're just like doing co-op with a team, but you're actually walking through like a

2692
02:13:49,600 --> 02:13:52,240
maze and fighting like stormtroopers and shit.

2693
02:13:52,240 --> 02:13:59,360
But I do dream of a day like AR laser tag where this is our holodeck.

2694
02:13:59,360 --> 02:14:00,360
But I'll be perfectly honest.

2695
02:14:00,360 --> 02:14:05,400
I mean, I would want something like this that I could do at home and stop it, you know,

2696
02:14:05,400 --> 02:14:09,560
but I just keep thinking that it would end up being really overwhelming for me with my

2697
02:14:09,560 --> 02:14:10,720
sensory issues.

2698
02:14:10,720 --> 02:14:15,080
You know, it's clearly not meant for autistic people.

2699
02:14:15,080 --> 02:14:19,680
If it's as flashy as what they were showing the video content to look like.

2700
02:14:19,680 --> 02:14:20,680
It's not.

2701
02:14:20,680 --> 02:14:22,120
I mean, that's an attraction video.

2702
02:14:22,120 --> 02:14:23,120
Yeah.

2703
02:14:23,120 --> 02:14:24,120
So it's not that flashy.

2704
02:14:24,120 --> 02:14:29,360
But virtual environments can be overstimulating anyway for an autistic person because it's

2705
02:14:29,360 --> 02:14:31,400
not just the visual input.

2706
02:14:31,400 --> 02:14:34,560
You're also dealing with the electric input, the heat, the pressure.

2707
02:14:34,560 --> 02:14:36,240
You've got a lot more than that you're dealing with.

2708
02:14:36,240 --> 02:14:40,160
And I would want something that I could like pause.

2709
02:14:40,160 --> 02:14:45,920
They do have an emergency stop, but yeah, it's, um, each session is 30 minutes and it

2710
02:14:45,920 --> 02:14:49,940
actually like, you know, I thought so too.

2711
02:14:49,940 --> 02:14:54,320
And I like you said with you, with those sorts of issues, it might actually be too long because

2712
02:14:54,320 --> 02:14:56,080
of all the stuff that's going on.

2713
02:14:56,080 --> 02:15:01,080
But for me, I was like in the middle of my third battle and I won because I was ahead

2714
02:15:01,080 --> 02:15:02,480
and I was like, wait, I didn't finish.

2715
02:15:02,480 --> 02:15:03,900
I want to keep going.

2716
02:15:03,900 --> 02:15:08,480
This is terrible for people that want to win at stuff terrible.

2717
02:15:08,480 --> 02:15:12,320
And to Jamie's point, this is all still like, and again, you say this only exists in two

2718
02:15:12,320 --> 02:15:13,320
different places.

2719
02:15:13,320 --> 02:15:17,000
This whole, this whole thing is kind of like uncharted territory.

2720
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,860
Like we kind of look at it as gamers going like, okay, wow, cool.

2721
02:15:19,860 --> 02:15:22,880
This is like a workout thing to the next level, but there's still a lot to figure out.

2722
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:25,660
I mean, we're trying to figure out what's the right price.

2723
02:15:25,660 --> 02:15:28,840
And then I think another question that's going to be asked with this is how do we make it

2724
02:15:28,840 --> 02:15:32,880
accessible to more people is going to be, you know, another question which would include,

2725
02:15:32,880 --> 02:15:35,760
you know, include these sorts of questions that you're raising.

2726
02:15:35,760 --> 02:15:42,640
What I want is sensory deprivation, weightlifting, because when I, um, when I lift, when I was

2727
02:15:42,640 --> 02:15:46,480
lifting heavy, you know, now that I've got the okay to go back and do it, I'm going to,

2728
02:15:46,480 --> 02:15:52,680
but I would, uh, close my eyes or wear a sweat band over my eyes so that I could focus on

2729
02:15:52,680 --> 02:15:58,440
how my body felt and not have any click clank over in the side or any bright lights or loud

2730
02:15:58,440 --> 02:16:01,480
music, um, interrupting my own progress.

2731
02:16:01,480 --> 02:16:04,240
Have you ever done one of those like water tank things?

2732
02:16:04,240 --> 02:16:08,280
I desperately want to, um, curious, I say sensory deprivation.

2733
02:16:08,280 --> 02:16:09,640
That's where my mind goes.

2734
02:16:09,640 --> 02:16:12,860
I really want to do a sensory deprivation tank because it's supposed to be the most

2735
02:16:12,860 --> 02:16:14,120
relaxing thing ever.

2736
02:16:14,120 --> 02:16:17,680
Um, but I mean, I kind of, I re I liked the concept.

2737
02:16:17,680 --> 02:16:22,640
I really liked the concept and me having a little bit of, you know, a background in having

2738
02:16:22,640 --> 02:16:26,760
done heavy weightlifting, it sounds really interesting and very motivating to a lot of

2739
02:16:26,760 --> 02:16:27,760
people.

2740
02:16:27,760 --> 02:16:31,340
I just don't know if, you know, it would be the right thing for me.

2741
02:16:31,340 --> 02:16:35,700
And on top of that, I would really be worried about people, Shane, no shade on you, but

2742
02:16:35,700 --> 02:16:39,960
I would be really afraid for people who are not paying attention to their form and are

2743
02:16:39,960 --> 02:16:44,420
not doing the exercises correctly because that is how you injure yourself.

2744
02:16:44,420 --> 02:16:45,660
Crossfit.

2745
02:16:45,660 --> 02:16:46,660
Definitely true.

2746
02:16:46,660 --> 02:16:47,660
Definitely true.

2747
02:16:47,660 --> 02:16:52,840
Crossfit has a big problem going on with that and I, you know, people will preach Crossfit

2748
02:16:52,840 --> 02:16:55,940
like they preach veganism, you know, it's their religion.

2749
02:16:55,940 --> 02:16:58,980
Guess who's husband has recently gotten into that bandwagon.

2750
02:16:58,980 --> 02:17:03,980
At any rate though, the Crossfit also is fairly dangerous if you're not paying attention to

2751
02:17:03,980 --> 02:17:08,060
your form and a lot of people will try to push their reps over and over, over paying

2752
02:17:08,060 --> 02:17:12,120
attention to, are they doing these exercises correctly?

2753
02:17:12,120 --> 02:17:17,060
You know, I know someone who had to take a break out of Crossfit because of torn ligaments

2754
02:17:17,060 --> 02:17:22,040
in her shoulder, you know, people injuring themselves because they're not paying attention

2755
02:17:22,040 --> 02:17:25,460
to form because all they want to do is hit those numbers, hit those numbers.

2756
02:17:25,460 --> 02:17:28,500
And that's a big problem I foresee with this service.

2757
02:17:28,500 --> 02:17:36,700
Well, what I will say, just to talk about that for a second, I think what you're saying

2758
02:17:36,700 --> 02:17:41,620
is a hundred percent true and the best I think that they can do is kind of the stuff they

2759
02:17:41,620 --> 02:17:43,300
have already implemented.

2760
02:17:43,300 --> 02:17:48,460
Every time you pick a workout, it's showing you a video as it's loading up and if you

2761
02:17:48,460 --> 02:17:53,280
try to cheat and really just, you know, go at it without paying attention to your form

2762
02:17:53,280 --> 02:17:58,000
at all, it doesn't know exactly that you're cheating, but if it feels like you're not

2763
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:03,000
doing it right, because I may have done some of that today, it will say, you've got to,

2764
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:08,120
you've got to stop in and check your form and it won't actually let you attack or account

2765
02:18:08,120 --> 02:18:15,040
for anything you're doing until you get back into what it believes is the correct form.

2766
02:18:15,040 --> 02:18:17,880
So they try at least.

2767
02:18:17,880 --> 02:18:22,240
And it's still probably uncharted territory in many ways, like, you know.

2768
02:18:22,240 --> 02:18:26,320
Now I would assume it would have like a profile for you, of course, but doesn't save anything

2769
02:18:26,320 --> 02:18:33,960
like body dimension, like your weight, your height, your hip to foot ratio, things like

2770
02:18:33,960 --> 02:18:39,000
that, so that it can accommodate for maybe having, like for me, I got short stubby little

2771
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:40,620
hobbit legs.

2772
02:18:40,620 --> 02:18:45,660
My squat's going to go a lot lower than the average person, you know, but I have a bit

2773
02:18:45,660 --> 02:18:47,140
taller of an upper body.

2774
02:18:47,140 --> 02:18:51,440
So if I'm going to do say, hold on, I'm trying to do this on the camera, like, you know,

2775
02:18:51,480 --> 02:18:56,600
a shoulder press, my shoulder press is going to go a little bit taller than it might be expected

2776
02:18:56,600 --> 02:19:02,160
of my height. So, you know, the only thing really, I want to kind of deep dive on this one

2777
02:19:02,160 --> 02:19:05,160
now. I'm going to do a lot of research on it because it's very fascinating to me.

2778
02:19:05,520 --> 02:19:06,960
So, so two things to that.

2779
02:19:07,240 --> 02:19:10,640
One, they only ask for your height and weight when you sign up.

2780
02:19:10,800 --> 02:19:16,200
And when you go in there, it has you center your head so it can like accurately gauge if

2781
02:19:16,200 --> 02:19:18,080
you're right about how tall you are for these.

2782
02:19:18,080 --> 02:19:23,080
So I'm guessing it's, it's assuming that you are of average proportions, so to speak.

2783
02:19:23,320 --> 02:19:28,640
But the thing is, since it's still really new, every time you're done with it,

2784
02:19:28,920 --> 02:19:32,160
the app asks you for feedback for that stuff.

2785
02:19:32,360 --> 02:19:40,240
And the employees there have both times so far, like asked for feedback as to what's

2786
02:19:40,240 --> 02:19:43,560
working, what can be improved, stuff like that.

2787
02:19:43,560 --> 02:19:51,600
So I think for someone like you who wants it to go even further and it should go further,

2788
02:19:52,280 --> 02:19:58,160
maybe, maybe trying out that 30-day trial and just going down there once to tell them,

2789
02:19:58,160 --> 02:20:00,880
hey, this is what I noticed that you should be doing.

2790
02:20:01,040 --> 02:20:02,920
It's a good drive going to San Francisco.

2791
02:20:02,920 --> 02:20:07,280
Yeah, well, yeah. I mean, if you were going there for whatever reason already, like if

2792
02:20:07,280 --> 02:20:09,280
you're just taking like a weekend trip or something.

2793
02:20:09,440 --> 02:20:15,280
I will say I'm all for this gamification of exercising, and I'm sure this is just like,

2794
02:20:15,280 --> 02:20:20,960
you know, the next step, because I would say, you know, it's this or it's Wii Fit or it's,

2795
02:20:20,960 --> 02:20:24,360
you know, now we've got the Resistance band, right?

2796
02:20:24,360 --> 02:20:28,560
The Nintendo, what did I, what was the nasty name I gave it the other week on the show?

2797
02:20:28,560 --> 02:20:29,760
The Nintendo Strap-On.

2798
02:20:29,760 --> 02:20:33,680
The Nintendo Strap-On thing for your leg, because you strap it on your legs.

2799
02:20:33,680 --> 02:20:34,480
It's the Nintendo Strap-On.

2800
02:20:34,480 --> 02:20:35,480
Yes, OK.

2801
02:20:36,360 --> 02:20:42,280
So there's that or, you know, I'm really excited right now because we're starting a walking

2802
02:20:42,280 --> 02:20:47,280
challenge at work tomorrow, and I'm going to get all those steps in and be my co-workers.

2803
02:20:48,560 --> 02:20:51,360
So, you know, gamification, it goes a long way.

2804
02:20:51,360 --> 02:20:53,680
And we're starting the mindfulness challenge at work.

2805
02:20:53,680 --> 02:20:58,880
So is that, oh, is that the 10 minutes of the Breathe app and using a guided meditation?

2806
02:20:59,120 --> 02:20:59,480
Fun.

2807
02:20:59,960 --> 02:21:01,720
So kind of the reverse.

2808
02:21:02,360 --> 02:21:05,920
But no, thank you for thank you definitely for bringing that up to us, because I think

2809
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:09,600
that it's an amazing concept.

2810
02:21:09,600 --> 02:21:13,760
I kind of saw something like this eventually happening, and I'm glad that they did.

2811
02:21:13,760 --> 02:21:15,720
It will definitely get more people into being active.

2812
02:21:15,720 --> 02:21:19,080
And I feel like this one company probably isn't the only one like it's the one that

2813
02:21:19,080 --> 02:21:20,960
Shane got to see and is reporting on.

2814
02:21:20,960 --> 02:21:23,440
But I have a feeling there's others very similar.

2815
02:21:23,440 --> 02:21:24,160
You know what?

2816
02:21:24,160 --> 02:21:29,920
Another application for something I think could definitely be incorporated into hospital,

2817
02:21:29,920 --> 02:21:32,920
hospice services, things like physical rehab.

2818
02:21:33,600 --> 02:21:37,800
Imagine having something like that for people who are just like, oh, this is boring.

2819
02:21:37,800 --> 02:21:38,760
This is boring. It's boring.

2820
02:21:38,760 --> 02:21:43,560
But you give them a virtual environment in which to motivate themselves to participate

2821
02:21:43,560 --> 02:21:48,560
in their physical therapy and then give them some sort of, you know, reward for actually.

2822
02:21:48,560 --> 02:21:50,320
I mean, my dad would probably need that.

2823
02:21:50,320 --> 02:21:52,240
He never wanted to do his physical therapy.

2824
02:21:52,560 --> 02:21:56,040
But if he got a reward out of like say that he did all of this physical therapy and he

2825
02:21:56,040 --> 02:22:00,080
got to get a snack out of the snack machine, my dad would be happy as a, you know,

2826
02:22:02,280 --> 02:22:06,240
Mr. Smoosh with the feeder broken and just piling food everywhere.

2827
02:22:06,520 --> 02:22:08,400
That's how happy my dad would be.

2828
02:22:08,960 --> 02:22:09,320
Okay.

2829
02:22:10,040 --> 02:22:13,480
Shane, before I let you go, I don't see any other callers waiting in the green room.

2830
02:22:13,480 --> 02:22:17,080
Again, if you do want to be on orange on radio tonight, head on over to the green room on

2831
02:22:17,080 --> 02:22:20,320
our discord server over at vognetwork.com slash discord.

2832
02:22:20,520 --> 02:22:22,600
That's VOGnetwork.com slash discord.

2833
02:22:22,800 --> 02:22:27,080
But before I let you go, Shane, any other gaming things going on you want to talk about

2834
02:22:27,080 --> 02:22:27,680
here on the show?

2835
02:22:30,360 --> 02:22:36,760
I accidentally started WoW again because I was on Ambien, I guess was really the best

2836
02:22:36,760 --> 02:22:37,640
explanation.

2837
02:22:39,400 --> 02:22:43,960
And I'm naming my character after the good place, which is great.

2838
02:22:44,320 --> 02:22:51,160
And I have a huge backlog of games and I just keep playing the goose game instead.

2839
02:22:51,320 --> 02:22:52,120
I don't even care.

2840
02:22:52,280 --> 02:22:52,880
Oh, yeah.

2841
02:22:52,920 --> 02:22:54,120
Quickly on the goose game.

2842
02:22:54,120 --> 02:22:55,760
Cause you said this is like the best video game.

2843
02:22:55,760 --> 02:22:56,040
Oh, no way.

2844
02:22:56,040 --> 02:22:57,680
You talked about this last week already, didn't you?

2845
02:22:57,960 --> 02:22:59,240
Yeah, I did.

2846
02:22:59,800 --> 02:23:00,760
Congratulations.

2847
02:23:00,760 --> 02:23:04,280
I finally broke my ban on Epic and got it.

2848
02:23:04,600 --> 02:23:06,320
It's going to be worth it.

2849
02:23:06,440 --> 02:23:08,160
So I can play it on my Mac.

2850
02:23:09,280 --> 02:23:10,880
It's just the funniest game.

2851
02:23:10,880 --> 02:23:14,040
I'm going to be at work on lunch playing the freaking goose game.

2852
02:23:14,360 --> 02:23:14,960
You're coworkers.

2853
02:23:14,960 --> 02:23:17,120
Just make sure to wear headphones.

2854
02:23:17,200 --> 02:23:20,160
I'm not the only one who plays games at lunch though at work.

2855
02:23:20,200 --> 02:23:22,080
Yeah, you used to get a coworker that did Diablo three.

2856
02:23:22,200 --> 02:23:23,560
Yeah, a couple of do Diablo.

2857
02:23:23,560 --> 02:23:26,080
Some people who've done cause Borderlands plays on Mac.

2858
02:23:26,160 --> 02:23:27,000
Oh yeah.

2859
02:23:27,040 --> 02:23:28,240
So, all right, cool.

2860
02:23:29,040 --> 02:23:29,480
All right.

2861
02:23:29,600 --> 02:23:30,400
Well, Shane, take care.

2862
02:23:30,400 --> 02:23:30,960
I'm going to let you go.

2863
02:23:30,960 --> 02:23:31,280
Okay.

2864
02:23:32,120 --> 02:23:32,360
Okay.

2865
02:23:32,360 --> 02:23:34,360
And everybody watched the Pokemon stream on Friday.

2866
02:23:34,360 --> 02:23:35,400
It's 24 hours.

2867
02:23:35,400 --> 02:23:36,480
Who knows what it's going to be?

2868
02:23:37,120 --> 02:23:37,920
It's a mystery.

2869
02:23:37,960 --> 02:23:38,160
All right.

2870
02:23:38,160 --> 02:23:38,480
Bye.

2871
02:23:38,720 --> 02:23:38,920
Yep.

2872
02:23:38,920 --> 02:23:39,200
Bye.

2873
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:40,320
All right.

2874
02:23:40,320 --> 02:23:41,520
Oh, this'll be fun.

2875
02:23:41,800 --> 02:23:42,600
Oh gosh.

2876
02:23:42,600 --> 02:23:45,320
If this is who the label says it is, this is going to be so much fun.

2877
02:23:45,560 --> 02:23:46,880
Uh, let's go to the phones.

2878
02:23:47,040 --> 02:23:47,360
Hi.

2879
02:23:47,360 --> 02:23:48,280
You're on orange on radio.

2880
02:23:48,280 --> 02:23:48,840
Who's this?

2881
02:23:49,800 --> 02:23:51,040
This is Jim Sally motherfucker.

2882
02:23:51,040 --> 02:23:52,240
I'm back from the past.

2883
02:23:52,560 --> 02:23:55,160
Jim Sally is back, bitch.

2884
02:23:55,160 --> 02:23:56,280
I thought you were dead.

2885
02:23:57,520 --> 02:23:58,840
I was for a little while.

2886
02:23:59,440 --> 02:23:59,720
Wow.

2887
02:23:59,720 --> 02:24:00,640
Ooh, and the quality.

2888
02:24:00,640 --> 02:24:05,880
See, a lot of people give a shit for ditching Skype, but the quality, like Jim

2889
02:24:05,880 --> 02:24:07,560
Sally's coming through an HD now.

2890
02:24:07,560 --> 02:24:08,040
I love it.

2891
02:24:09,360 --> 02:24:09,960
Listen, brother.

2892
02:24:09,960 --> 02:24:13,240
It was so much easier before when I could use the fucking regular telephone.

2893
02:24:13,600 --> 02:24:14,520
I know.

2894
02:24:14,920 --> 02:24:15,280
I know.

2895
02:24:15,280 --> 02:24:16,400
Thanks for complicated now.

2896
02:24:17,400 --> 02:24:18,760
And I'm fucking dude.

2897
02:24:18,800 --> 02:24:22,800
I'm a little bit baked and I had to think of asking me if I was a robot.

2898
02:24:22,800 --> 02:24:24,480
And I'm like, dude, I'm not a robot.

2899
02:24:24,520 --> 02:24:25,960
And it was like, look at this picture.

2900
02:24:25,960 --> 02:24:27,600
And where's the traffic lights?

2901
02:24:27,600 --> 02:24:28,760
And I'm like, I don't know, man.

2902
02:24:29,040 --> 02:24:30,560
But look, you can see us.

2903
02:24:31,040 --> 02:24:31,600
We're a video.

2904
02:24:31,600 --> 02:24:33,280
What do you think of OLRB video now?

2905
02:24:34,600 --> 02:24:35,600
Dude, it was pretty crazy, man.

2906
02:24:35,600 --> 02:24:38,840
When I was watching fucking Bobby Black Wolf before, man, Jesus Christ, Bobby

2907
02:24:38,840 --> 02:24:40,280
Black Wolf looks a little bit Wolfie.

2908
02:24:40,520 --> 02:24:41,440
You forget sometimes.

2909
02:24:42,200 --> 02:24:43,080
You forget sometimes.

2910
02:24:43,080 --> 02:24:44,280
That's a compliment though.

2911
02:24:44,440 --> 02:24:45,880
Bobby Black Wolf's a good looking man.

2912
02:24:46,720 --> 02:24:47,720
He has a good looking man.

2913
02:24:47,720 --> 02:24:50,600
And when I hear his voice, I picture like a smooth Debonair, like, you know,

2914
02:24:50,600 --> 02:24:53,760
little short hobbit, he sort of, but still smooth and Debonair techie boy.

2915
02:24:54,040 --> 02:24:55,240
And then you see him now.

2916
02:24:55,560 --> 02:24:59,360
Shit, son, put that man in a moped and I'm stepping back.

2917
02:24:59,720 --> 02:25:00,560
That's all I'm saying.

2918
02:25:01,240 --> 02:25:02,200
That's all I'm saying.

2919
02:25:02,800 --> 02:25:04,760
Well, what, what the hell have you been up to?

2920
02:25:05,040 --> 02:25:07,800
What's been new over the past two years, however long it's been.

2921
02:25:08,080 --> 02:25:08,840
Jeez, man.

2922
02:25:08,840 --> 02:25:09,560
A couple of years.

2923
02:25:09,560 --> 02:25:12,960
Uh, I was, I was working at a marijuana farm for a while.

2924
02:25:12,960 --> 02:25:16,080
Getting that all set up for a couple of years, but it was about an hour away from

2925
02:25:16,080 --> 02:25:20,480
my house, so it was taking up a lot of my time, Sunday nights, I was always there.

2926
02:25:20,800 --> 02:25:23,800
There's no wifi service, no OLR, man.

2927
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:27,960
And it's not the same listening to it as a podcast when it's not live.

2928
02:25:28,440 --> 02:25:29,120
I don't know why.

2929
02:25:29,760 --> 02:25:30,840
It doesn't seem as fresh.

2930
02:25:31,080 --> 02:25:36,000
It's um, you know, I, I, yeah, the podcast and I've, you know, cause I, I listen,

2931
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,720
yes, I listen to myself sometimes just because I'm my own worst critic.

2932
02:25:38,720 --> 02:25:41,920
And I often come up with the ideas on how to do better things when I listen to this

2933
02:25:41,960 --> 02:25:42,920
when I listen to this show.

2934
02:25:43,080 --> 02:25:45,920
I think part of the fun is that you do kind of feel like you could influence

2935
02:25:45,920 --> 02:25:48,320
things through the chat room and stuff like that, where it's like, when you're

2936
02:25:48,320 --> 02:25:51,040
listening on the podcast, you can't really change anything.

2937
02:25:51,080 --> 02:25:53,200
You know, you can't influence the show on the fly.

2938
02:25:53,440 --> 02:25:57,760
We have had complete fucking utter derailments of this entire fucking show

2939
02:25:57,760 --> 02:26:01,200
that have happened because of a chat comment, you know, and when you're on the

2940
02:26:01,200 --> 02:26:05,600
podcast, although, sure, we, we still, we invite the tweets, we invite the emails.

2941
02:26:05,840 --> 02:26:10,000
It's not, I fully admit it's not quite the same when it isn't playing out live.

2942
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:10,360
You know?

2943
02:26:13,240 --> 02:26:13,800
Yeah, man.

2944
02:26:13,800 --> 02:26:15,920
I know that I got my weekends back to myself.

2945
02:26:15,920 --> 02:26:19,440
I want to spend a little more time listening and calling in, man.

2946
02:26:19,760 --> 02:26:20,240
Well, good.

2947
02:26:20,240 --> 02:26:21,200
It's so good to hear from you.

2948
02:26:21,440 --> 02:26:21,920
I'm good.

2949
02:26:22,280 --> 02:26:24,360
Dude, I'm getting the game life back on.

2950
02:26:24,720 --> 02:26:25,160
Yeah.

2951
02:26:25,200 --> 02:26:27,840
So I was able to get my gaming life back together and I bought

2952
02:26:27,840 --> 02:26:29,920
this thing called a PS4.

2953
02:26:30,080 --> 02:26:31,520
Have you ever heard of this thing?

2954
02:26:31,800 --> 02:26:35,640
It went up from a three to a four, apparently, while I was away.

2955
02:26:36,160 --> 02:26:38,560
How far north in Canada are you?

2956
02:26:38,560 --> 02:26:40,640
It's too far.

2957
02:26:40,640 --> 02:26:41,400
You forget, man.

2958
02:26:41,400 --> 02:26:44,840
It's far, man, but it's fucking far.

2959
02:26:46,360 --> 02:26:48,880
I'm still living on the same goat farm that I lived on before.

2960
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:50,200
No.

2961
02:26:50,200 --> 02:26:53,360
So the way in her majesty's Bush, we're not so the way in her majesty's Bush.

2962
02:26:53,360 --> 02:26:58,080
Cause I like to tell people, you live out the goat's real fat, but a girl's

2963
02:26:58,080 --> 02:27:00,200
go fat munching on her majesty's Bush.

2964
02:27:00,480 --> 02:27:01,840
Bitch don't pay no rent though.

2965
02:27:02,520 --> 02:27:06,680
That much put, put her face on the 20 and pay me.

2966
02:27:07,680 --> 02:27:12,920
While you've been working out in the Bush at the grass farm, what have you

2967
02:27:12,920 --> 02:27:14,920
been playing on the PlayStation four?

2968
02:27:15,480 --> 02:27:18,440
Well, I went out and I got, I got the fallout.

2969
02:27:18,520 --> 02:27:20,880
I got the fallout four, which is unbelievable.

2970
02:27:20,880 --> 02:27:22,320
I can't believe how amazing it is.

2971
02:27:22,320 --> 02:27:24,640
I just lose myself in the inside that world.

2972
02:27:24,680 --> 02:27:25,320
It's crazy.

2973
02:27:25,400 --> 02:27:28,280
The evil things that you can do to people with police around.

2974
02:27:28,280 --> 02:27:29,840
It's it's just spectacular.

2975
02:27:30,160 --> 02:27:35,240
But then I tried to play the fallout 76 and fuck, man, people are evil, man.

2976
02:27:35,320 --> 02:27:36,560
I can't play folks.

2977
02:27:36,600 --> 02:27:40,680
They should go follow 76 and follow fucking shoot Jim Sally in the face.

2978
02:27:40,920 --> 02:27:43,800
Cause every time I grow up with somebody, I think it's going to be a nice, Hey,

2979
02:27:43,800 --> 02:27:46,840
I'm going to use my, I did, I stumble around and I try to get the fucking

2980
02:27:46,840 --> 02:27:48,280
handshake emoji on and shut off.

2981
02:27:48,280 --> 02:27:51,600
The motherfucker will shoot my hand off and then kill me and steal my shit.

2982
02:27:51,800 --> 02:27:52,960
Like, wow, this is a great game.

2983
02:27:53,400 --> 02:27:54,160
This is a great game.

2984
02:27:54,160 --> 02:27:56,080
I get to be an NBC from followed for it.

2985
02:27:56,360 --> 02:28:00,120
Isn't that the worst when you try to go and do like the handshake emo and then

2986
02:28:00,120 --> 02:28:02,600
you accidentally do the one that's the middle finger instead.

2987
02:28:02,600 --> 02:28:07,320
Uh, and I don't want to be like cruel because you know, I know it's kind of

2988
02:28:07,320 --> 02:28:12,160
profiling and shit because I'm sure most people playing that game are a dick, but

2989
02:28:12,160 --> 02:28:13,560
there should be some sort of like mode.

2990
02:28:13,560 --> 02:28:15,720
I have where people know it's Jim Sally and not a dick.

2991
02:28:15,760 --> 02:28:16,680
Like you should be cool.

2992
02:28:16,680 --> 02:28:20,760
And I roll up on, have you thought about changing your PlayStation

2993
02:28:20,760 --> 02:28:22,280
four name to Jim Sally?

2994
02:28:22,280 --> 02:28:22,880
Not a dick.

2995
02:28:23,960 --> 02:28:26,960
I tried that, but then I got this thing that said it was bad.

2996
02:28:26,960 --> 02:28:28,360
Cause you can't have a dick in your name.

2997
02:28:28,360 --> 02:28:29,440
So I tried cock.

2998
02:28:30,040 --> 02:28:30,960
I tried pennant.

2999
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:31,960
I tried penis.

3000
02:28:32,120 --> 02:28:32,560
That didn't work.

3001
02:28:32,560 --> 02:28:33,640
I tried 10, 15.

3002
02:28:33,840 --> 02:28:37,600
I tried to do about it, man.

3003
02:28:38,200 --> 02:28:38,840
Like shit.

3004
02:28:39,160 --> 02:28:40,680
I'm fucking behind the times, man.

3005
02:28:40,920 --> 02:28:41,800
I'm behind the times.

3006
02:28:41,880 --> 02:28:44,200
I just learned like, I just learned about Twitch today.

3007
02:28:45,400 --> 02:28:46,120
Well, welcome.

3008
02:28:46,160 --> 02:28:48,040
It's a, it's a beautiful world here.

3009
02:28:48,280 --> 02:28:49,960
Uh, this is unbelievable, man.

3010
02:28:50,160 --> 02:28:53,640
Fifth dream today in chat says the PVP has calmed down a lot since the early days.

3011
02:28:53,840 --> 02:28:55,120
Way less griefing.

3012
02:28:55,120 --> 02:28:59,280
And we have multiple suggestions for a former, a chatter from back in the day.

3013
02:28:59,280 --> 02:29:04,120
Pen 15 is another way you could do it, which is also a show on Hulu that

3014
02:29:04,120 --> 02:29:05,920
extra for like made me watch.

3015
02:29:05,960 --> 02:29:07,960
And it's pretty fucking funny anyway.

3016
02:29:10,800 --> 02:29:15,360
Oh, so Jim Sally, is there anything on your PlayStation four wishlist?

3017
02:29:15,760 --> 02:29:16,960
Like things you want to play?

3018
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:18,960
Well, that's the thing, right?

3019
02:29:18,960 --> 02:29:20,320
Cause I'm just getting back into it now.

3020
02:29:20,320 --> 02:29:22,760
So I know that Christmas time is coming, which means all the old

3021
02:29:22,760 --> 02:29:23,920
games are going to be for sale.

3022
02:29:24,120 --> 02:29:27,640
I already bought the new grand tourismal Jesus Christ.

3023
02:29:27,640 --> 02:29:29,360
I was melting away on the grand tourismal.

3024
02:29:29,880 --> 02:29:30,960
I can't believe it.

3025
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:31,680
You just fall.

3026
02:29:31,960 --> 02:29:35,720
And then I thought for the longest time that I was the greatest racer of all time.

3027
02:29:35,720 --> 02:29:36,360
I couldn't believe it.

3028
02:29:36,360 --> 02:29:38,080
I was flying through the corners.

3029
02:29:38,240 --> 02:29:39,200
Nothing could stop me.

3030
02:29:39,240 --> 02:29:40,280
Everything was perfect.

3031
02:29:40,600 --> 02:29:44,800
And then my friend came over and I played on his profile and I couldn't do it.

3032
02:29:44,800 --> 02:29:45,760
And I said, what's going on?

3033
02:29:46,320 --> 02:29:48,280
And he said, you got it on girlfriend mode.

3034
02:29:48,840 --> 02:29:49,960
What the fuck are you talking about?

3035
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:50,800
Girlfriend mode.

3036
02:29:50,800 --> 02:29:55,400
And he explained to me, it was all like auto-breaking and no damage.

3037
02:29:56,160 --> 02:30:03,960
You know what, that mode got some strong feedback for what, what it was being called.

3038
02:30:03,960 --> 02:30:06,480
But, um, also, uh, there's no shame.

3039
02:30:06,480 --> 02:30:09,480
I think in playing video games on an easy mode, especially if you just want to

3040
02:30:09,480 --> 02:30:13,240
experience the narrative or the story, you know, um, but yeah, I mean, you're not

3041
02:30:13,240 --> 02:30:16,320
going to maybe get trophies or be able to say, Oh, I got the best score.

3042
02:30:16,480 --> 02:30:18,560
Cause you know, you're playing on an easier mode.

3043
02:30:18,960 --> 02:30:22,080
Um, you did make me think of something though that we didn't have in tonight's

3044
02:30:22,080 --> 02:30:24,880
show role, but as maybe like a little bit of a last minute story.

3045
02:30:25,120 --> 02:30:28,640
Since you are, you know, a little newer on the PlayStation four bandwagon, you

3046
02:30:28,640 --> 02:30:32,640
know, you're not the only one, uh, some of the games are coming down in price.

3047
02:30:32,800 --> 02:30:34,880
In fact, just two days ago, Jim Sally.

3048
02:30:34,880 --> 02:30:42,720
So recently this week, they have reduced the, the price because they have put some

3049
02:30:42,720 --> 02:30:50,760
new games in the greatest hits package PlayStation, so new games, 20 bucks for

3050
02:30:50,760 --> 02:30:56,000
these games, 20 American far cry four.

3051
02:30:56,040 --> 02:31:01,760
Just so you know, we call that a queenie God of war, Gran Turismo sport, Rayman

3052
02:31:01,760 --> 02:31:08,320
legends, the crew uncharted, the lost legacy and watchdogs are all down to 20

3053
02:31:08,320 --> 02:31:08,720
bucks.

3054
02:31:09,360 --> 02:31:11,800
Dude, I'm set the original watchdogs.

3055
02:31:11,840 --> 02:31:13,320
Yeah, I guess the original for whatever.

3056
02:31:13,640 --> 02:31:14,960
I think I bought that for 20 bucks.

3057
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:17,600
Like a few years ago.

3058
02:31:19,480 --> 02:31:22,280
Is it going to be the super additions though, where I get all the extra bonus

3059
02:31:22,280 --> 02:31:22,640
shit?

3060
02:31:23,520 --> 02:31:29,560
Um, sometimes like, I know, like I just saw at a target or one of those places,

3061
02:31:29,560 --> 02:31:33,640
like the horizon zero Dawn, which, which is a game I've been meaning to try.

3062
02:31:33,640 --> 02:31:36,120
It's another one of those like open world exploration games.

3063
02:31:36,120 --> 02:31:41,840
It's got, if you like fall out of my piece of delicious 20 bucks and it was

3064
02:31:41,840 --> 02:31:43,160
the worst game and the DLC.

3065
02:31:43,200 --> 02:31:43,440
Yeah.

3066
02:31:43,440 --> 02:31:43,800
Right.

3067
02:31:45,960 --> 02:31:47,560
I love two games, man.

3068
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:48,640
I love it.

3069
02:31:49,040 --> 02:31:51,200
I got a little boy.

3070
02:31:51,200 --> 02:31:51,840
I got a little boy.

3071
02:31:51,840 --> 02:31:52,520
It's four years old.

3072
02:31:52,520 --> 02:31:52,960
Daniel.

3073
02:31:52,960 --> 02:31:56,400
It's just like daddy, a little fucking little mini fucking captain America.

3074
02:31:56,400 --> 02:31:57,080
Oh, I love him.

3075
02:31:57,400 --> 02:32:00,440
And sometimes you get into the game bins and I used to always have a hard time

3076
02:32:00,440 --> 02:32:03,240
looking in those fucking game bins and shit because there's a lot of games in

3077
02:32:03,240 --> 02:32:06,040
the fucking game bins because you know, what's great at finding games in the

3078
02:32:06,040 --> 02:32:08,440
game bins for your old Johnny, you fucking pick them up.

3079
02:32:08,440 --> 02:32:10,480
You put them right in the middle and he fucking digs in there.

3080
02:32:10,480 --> 02:32:12,800
Like it's a fucking ball pit comes up.

3081
02:32:13,720 --> 02:32:14,360
What'd you got there?

3082
02:32:14,360 --> 02:32:14,880
Motherfucker.

3083
02:32:15,080 --> 02:32:22,200
I got the motherfucker follow with Daniel and Tony.

3084
02:32:22,480 --> 02:32:25,880
I put the sticker from the cheap game on it and see if we can get the cheap.

3085
02:32:26,080 --> 02:32:26,960
I said, God damn it.

3086
02:32:26,960 --> 02:32:28,040
That's a good boy.

3087
02:32:28,480 --> 02:32:31,480
You put it, that's when you let them ride in the little basket of the cart.

3088
02:32:31,880 --> 02:32:32,520
You know what I mean?

3089
02:32:32,520 --> 02:32:34,880
Proud little ride, a little basket of the cart.

3090
02:32:35,880 --> 02:32:37,320
Maybe push them across the parking lot.

3091
02:32:37,320 --> 02:32:38,040
See what happens.

3092
02:32:39,040 --> 02:32:39,840
Good job, son.

3093
02:32:40,280 --> 02:32:41,880
God, I fucking missed your calls.

3094
02:32:41,880 --> 02:32:44,680
Those are the kind of moments you can have together with your boy.

3095
02:32:44,680 --> 02:32:48,440
Loki, do you let your children go Walmart dumpster diving in those?

3096
02:32:48,480 --> 02:32:51,200
That's why they're just dumpsters where they put all the, I mean, they're not

3097
02:32:51,200 --> 02:32:54,520
like actual dumpsters, but they just put all the cheap Blu-rays and all the games

3098
02:32:54,520 --> 02:32:55,840
go in those big Walmart dumpsters.

3099
02:32:55,840 --> 02:32:56,920
Do you let them go dumpster diving?

3100
02:32:56,920 --> 02:32:58,440
Oh, they don't care about any of that stuff.

3101
02:32:58,440 --> 02:32:58,800
They want it.

3102
02:32:58,800 --> 02:33:02,040
They want to play the demo kiosk for the Nintendo switch for games that we already

3103
02:33:02,040 --> 02:33:03,840
have at home that they just got done playing.

3104
02:33:04,480 --> 02:33:06,680
You got a Pavlov dog, those motherfuckers, man.

3105
02:33:06,680 --> 02:33:07,640
You take them to the Walmart.

3106
02:33:07,640 --> 02:33:10,240
It's got the McDonald's built right in and you tell them you want a cone.

3107
02:33:11,240 --> 02:33:18,000
I always look at the closeout stuff, but they always have like, it's like Titan

3108
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:18,880
fall two or something.

3109
02:33:18,880 --> 02:33:19,760
I'm like, I already own that.

3110
02:33:19,760 --> 02:33:21,920
I don't, I don't need another copy of Titanfall two.

3111
02:33:21,960 --> 02:33:25,760
If we gave our episodes titles, I would say this week would definitely be that a

3112
02:33:25,760 --> 02:33:28,160
Pavlov dog, that dog, that motherfucker.

3113
02:33:28,440 --> 02:33:30,520
You got a Pavlov dog, that motherfucker, man.

3114
02:33:30,520 --> 02:33:31,600
Kids are dumb, man.

3115
02:33:31,680 --> 02:33:33,680
How about that fucking shit, man?

3116
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:35,280
Jim Sally, man.

3117
02:33:35,600 --> 02:33:38,880
I have missed you so much on this program, but I do have to let you go so we can

3118
02:33:38,880 --> 02:33:39,600
wrap things up.

3119
02:33:39,920 --> 02:33:41,560
I hope to God we hear from you again, though.

3120
02:33:42,600 --> 02:33:42,880
Dude.

3121
02:33:42,880 --> 02:33:43,200
Yeah, man.

3122
02:33:43,200 --> 02:33:45,440
I'm going to get my Twitch and my fucking discord game on Pat.

3123
02:33:45,920 --> 02:33:46,960
Try to figure out some shit.

3124
02:33:47,080 --> 02:33:49,840
I saw some fucking live streaming channels or some shit on you.

3125
02:33:49,840 --> 02:33:50,480
Fucking shit.

3126
02:33:50,480 --> 02:33:51,400
I should be checking out.

3127
02:33:51,640 --> 02:33:53,320
You should get into live streaming.

3128
02:33:53,440 --> 02:33:53,680
Now.

3129
02:33:53,680 --> 02:33:57,120
I just said earlier in the show, don't get into live streaming to make money, but Jim

3130
02:33:57,120 --> 02:34:00,080
Sally, you're like, you're going to be like Ninja two.

3131
02:34:00,120 --> 02:34:00,800
I just know it.

3132
02:34:02,680 --> 02:34:05,280
Well, I'm going to go karate chop the fuck out of the night, man.

3133
02:34:05,600 --> 02:34:05,960
All right.

3134
02:34:05,960 --> 02:34:07,160
Some good nights, brothers.

3135
02:34:07,400 --> 02:34:07,720
All right.

3136
02:34:07,720 --> 02:34:08,600
Take care, my friend.

3137
02:34:09,280 --> 02:34:09,920
Later, boys.

3138
02:34:13,680 --> 02:34:15,160
I love hearing from Jim Sally.

3139
02:34:15,240 --> 02:34:16,040
That was the best.

3140
02:34:16,200 --> 02:34:16,960
That made my night.

3141
02:34:18,080 --> 02:34:21,160
We're not going to take any more calls because nothing else is going to top that.

3142
02:34:21,160 --> 02:34:25,440
But if you want to send us an email, you sure can participate at orange

3143
02:34:25,440 --> 02:34:28,800
lounge, radio.com, uh, make our soccer work next week.

3144
02:34:28,840 --> 02:34:30,480
Y'all gave her the night off tonight.

3145
02:34:30,480 --> 02:34:33,720
So, uh, make our soccer work and read your emails next week.

3146
02:34:33,760 --> 02:34:34,200
Girl.

3147
02:34:34,680 --> 02:34:37,240
So if we don't get emails next week, though, we need to think of something

3148
02:34:37,240 --> 02:34:38,280
other than drag race talk.

3149
02:34:39,280 --> 02:34:40,400
Um, karaoke.

3150
02:34:40,400 --> 02:34:40,920
No, I'm kidding.

3151
02:34:40,960 --> 02:34:42,640
I won't torture Loki anymore.

3152
02:34:42,680 --> 02:34:43,920
Um, let's see.

3153
02:34:43,920 --> 02:34:45,840
I would say food talk, but we did that anyway.

3154
02:34:46,440 --> 02:34:48,200
Um, guess what my mom sent me?

3155
02:34:48,560 --> 02:34:51,720
Oh, my mom sent me a Southern care package.

3156
02:34:52,640 --> 02:34:58,840
They contained two bags of waffle house grits, two cans of boiled peanuts, and

3157
02:34:58,840 --> 02:35:05,480
it's B O I L T P dash N U T S if you're from the South and some, uh, jambalaya

3158
02:35:05,480 --> 02:35:10,320
mix and I am a happy little mud bug.

3159
02:35:10,840 --> 02:35:11,080
All right.

3160
02:35:11,080 --> 02:35:13,960
Well, we'll think of some site type of appropriate punishment during the week.

3161
02:35:13,960 --> 02:35:16,280
Crawl dads, mud bugs, mud bugs.

3162
02:35:16,440 --> 02:35:16,760
All right.

3163
02:35:17,400 --> 02:35:17,800
All right.

3164
02:35:17,960 --> 02:35:22,400
Well, we're going to wrap up the show so we can head on out and, uh, yeah.

3165
02:35:22,440 --> 02:35:23,680
Uh, thank you though.

3166
02:35:23,720 --> 02:35:24,840
Of course, as always for you.

3167
02:35:24,840 --> 02:35:27,080
So actually, wait, I didn't check for any other last minute stories.

3168
02:35:27,080 --> 02:35:28,840
I re I did one, but I don't know if you have any others.

3169
02:35:28,840 --> 02:35:29,120
Loki.

3170
02:35:29,160 --> 02:35:30,200
Um, I had a couple of things.

3171
02:35:30,200 --> 02:35:35,680
So, uh, the first one is the composer, um, Bobby Prince, who wrote music for

3172
02:35:35,680 --> 02:35:41,280
such games as doom, doom two Wolfenstein 3d, and most notably Duke Nukem 3d has

3173
02:35:41,280 --> 02:35:47,160
filed a lawsuit against gearbox software and Randy Pitchford and valve claiming

3174
02:35:47,160 --> 02:35:51,920
that his music was used in, uh, Duke Nukem 3d 20th anniversary world tour

3175
02:35:51,920 --> 02:35:55,080
without his permission and without him receiving compensation.

3176
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,640
Oh, so he's saying in exchange.

3177
02:35:59,760 --> 02:36:06,320
Um, that he's requiring that a royalty of a dollar per unit sold be, um, given to

3178
02:36:06,320 --> 02:36:06,560
him.

3179
02:36:07,080 --> 02:36:08,920
So we'll have to see what happens with that.

3180
02:36:09,280 --> 02:36:09,600
Yeah.

3181
02:36:10,400 --> 02:36:14,000
And then last but not least, there is a new shooting collection.

3182
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:15,520
That's coming to the Nintendo switch.

3183
02:36:15,600 --> 02:36:21,520
The, uh, psycho shooting stars alpha, which is coming here.

3184
02:36:21,520 --> 02:36:28,920
It's got strikers, 1945, uh, looks like strikers, 1945, three, um,

3185
02:36:28,920 --> 02:36:35,400
zero gunner to dragon blaze, uh, strikers, 1945, two and sold divide.

3186
02:36:37,280 --> 02:36:38,040
Looks pretty cool.

3187
02:36:38,040 --> 02:36:42,680
If you like your classic arcade shooter games and that's coming out January 24th,

3188
02:36:44,120 --> 02:36:47,960
I'm sorry, that's in Europe, uh, North America's game, January 21st.

3189
02:36:49,240 --> 02:36:51,600
Um, I have another quick little last minute story.

3190
02:36:51,600 --> 02:36:54,880
So metal mayhem was sharing this in our discord and usually I don't share all the

3191
02:36:54,880 --> 02:36:57,240
sales and everything cause there's a lot of sales are going out there.

3192
02:36:57,440 --> 02:36:59,960
This one's a little bit interesting though, because, um, devolver is doing a

3193
02:36:59,960 --> 02:37:01,280
sale through good old games.

3194
02:37:01,600 --> 02:37:04,200
Um, and it's not just games, but it's movies.

3195
02:37:04,520 --> 02:37:08,360
Um, which I know we sometimes forget that movies go on sale and on platforms and

3196
02:37:08,360 --> 02:37:11,760
things as well, but then I'm looking at some of these movies and there are things

3197
02:37:11,760 --> 02:37:14,080
that I haven't really heard of, but they're really cheap.

3198
02:37:14,080 --> 02:37:15,520
And I imagine these are indie movies.

3199
02:37:15,680 --> 02:37:18,680
For example, there's a movie called burning man beyond black rock.

3200
02:37:18,680 --> 02:37:20,400
So I imagine that it's from 2005.

3201
02:37:20,400 --> 02:37:24,280
So it's a little older at this point, but, um, I imagine there is, uh, you know,

3202
02:37:24,480 --> 02:37:25,360
like a documentary.

3203
02:37:25,680 --> 02:37:29,600
Uh, I did not know angry video game nerd made a movie, but it also doesn't surprise

3204
02:37:29,600 --> 02:37:31,400
me at the same time that is on sale as well.

3205
02:37:31,400 --> 02:37:34,280
That was about the, uh, et thing.

3206
02:37:35,720 --> 02:37:36,720
The angry video game nerd.

3207
02:37:36,720 --> 02:37:36,960
Really?

3208
02:37:36,960 --> 02:37:37,240
Yeah.

3209
02:37:37,360 --> 02:37:37,880
Interesting.

3210
02:37:38,400 --> 02:37:41,640
Um, there's a movie called Austin high, which I think I had heard about that one.

3211
02:37:41,840 --> 02:37:43,400
I'm trying to see what else is a little newer.

3212
02:37:43,400 --> 02:37:44,400
I mean, these they're there.

3213
02:37:44,640 --> 02:37:47,720
A lot of these are older movies cause they are only like a dollar 50 at this point.

3214
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:53,120
Uh, pixel poetry, steam dream and good game are from about three years ago.

3215
02:37:53,120 --> 02:37:54,320
So kind of neat.

3216
02:37:54,720 --> 02:37:55,560
So there you go.

3217
02:37:55,600 --> 02:37:56,520
Check those out if you want.

3218
02:37:57,200 --> 02:38:02,000
So, and a dark to see who wants to point out the games done quick, did a little

3219
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:05,160
like a Twitch con edition, GDQX.

3220
02:38:05,600 --> 02:38:08,480
They raised 150,000 for able gamers.

3221
02:38:08,480 --> 02:38:09,920
That's what I was talking about earlier.

3222
02:38:09,960 --> 02:38:10,480
Oh, that's right.

3223
02:38:10,960 --> 02:38:12,120
We got the final number though.

3224
02:38:12,480 --> 02:38:12,560
Yeah.

3225
02:38:12,560 --> 02:38:15,240
They actually exceeded last year's numbers.

3226
02:38:15,840 --> 02:38:16,080
Yeah.

3227
02:38:16,120 --> 02:38:16,520
Good job.

3228
02:38:16,560 --> 02:38:17,680
Able gamers is a good charity.

3229
02:38:17,680 --> 02:38:19,040
So, um, congrats to able gamers.

3230
02:38:19,360 --> 02:38:20,000
Yay.

3231
02:38:20,240 --> 02:38:21,520
Gamers doing good things.

3232
02:38:21,560 --> 02:38:23,240
That is a great note to end this show on.

3233
02:38:23,240 --> 02:38:25,520
So we're going to go around and get everybody's final thought.

3234
02:38:25,520 --> 02:38:26,640
But I do want to say thank you.

3235
02:38:26,640 --> 02:38:29,400
Of course, as always for tuning into Orange Laundrio, thank you for your

3236
02:38:29,400 --> 02:38:33,160
support of our show, be it on the podcast feed or watching here live on Twitch.

3237
02:38:33,320 --> 02:38:35,000
We really appreciate you and your support.

3238
02:38:35,040 --> 02:38:37,840
Um, if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Laundrio, tell a

3239
02:38:37,840 --> 02:38:38,840
friend or two about the show.

3240
02:38:38,840 --> 02:38:41,600
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

3241
02:38:41,760 --> 02:38:44,760
But if the voices aren't here to put on air, what are we to do?

3242
02:38:44,880 --> 02:38:48,440
So, um, yeah, uh, a nice review, a five star review on one of

3243
02:38:48,440 --> 02:38:49,440
those sites goes a long way.

3244
02:38:49,640 --> 02:38:50,840
Hosting on Twitch.

3245
02:38:50,840 --> 02:38:52,720
I can't stress how magnificent that is.

3246
02:38:52,720 --> 02:38:54,520
It's discoverability.

3247
02:38:54,520 --> 02:38:57,800
It's very important and all that's even going to become bigger as Twitch

3248
02:38:57,800 --> 02:39:00,760
goes through some of these big changes in the next couple of months

3249
02:39:00,760 --> 02:39:02,320
to their main site design.

3250
02:39:02,720 --> 02:39:03,200
Anyway.

3251
02:39:03,240 --> 02:39:04,640
Um, thank you again.

3252
02:39:04,640 --> 02:39:06,240
So let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

3253
02:39:06,240 --> 02:39:06,960
I'll start with you tonight.

3254
02:39:06,960 --> 02:39:08,440
Loki, what do you, what's your final thought?

3255
02:39:08,520 --> 02:39:09,960
I did work on my game this week.

3256
02:39:09,960 --> 02:39:11,560
I forgot to mention that in my game week.

3257
02:39:11,600 --> 02:39:15,880
It was mostly bug fixing because I had done a bunch of changes and didn't.

3258
02:39:16,360 --> 02:39:19,760
I, cause I had done a bunch of changes, but that was the same time I had

3259
02:39:19,960 --> 02:39:22,720
deleted the actual pieces of my level.

3260
02:39:23,040 --> 02:39:24,280
And so then I put them all back.

3261
02:39:24,280 --> 02:39:28,280
And so they had a lot of stuff to fix because something broke and now it's

3262
02:39:28,280 --> 02:39:30,400
back up to where it should be now.

3263
02:39:30,760 --> 02:39:33,920
And so I can build from that, but that, that was my Saturday.

3264
02:39:34,960 --> 02:39:35,360
All right.

3265
02:39:35,400 --> 02:39:35,880
That's awesome.

3266
02:39:36,360 --> 02:39:39,600
Uh, my final thought for the night is you can't really see it on camera.

3267
02:39:39,600 --> 02:39:44,400
You can see way in the corner, you see some boxes sticking out just a little bit.

3268
02:39:44,400 --> 02:39:47,560
You can see it under underneath my golden girls, vinyl pop figures,

3269
02:39:47,560 --> 02:39:48,920
which is what's on the right side.

3270
02:39:48,920 --> 02:39:49,600
I got you on this.

3271
02:39:49,760 --> 02:39:52,240
There's a whole side over there.

3272
02:39:52,560 --> 02:39:55,600
That's just nothing but boxes and boxes.

3273
02:39:56,040 --> 02:40:00,400
And what that is, that is grandpa from the Horde house days or captain

3274
02:40:00,400 --> 02:40:01,880
Matt from starboard power coupling.

3275
02:40:02,240 --> 02:40:09,920
That is the, that is all pumpkin spice shit of different stuff.

3276
02:40:09,920 --> 02:40:12,880
I haven't opened it yet because I'm waiting for the last of it to arrive

3277
02:40:12,880 --> 02:40:15,120
tomorrow and then I'm going to do a Facebook live where I open it all.

3278
02:40:15,520 --> 02:40:16,800
And then I'm going to come over and help you eat it.

3279
02:40:16,800 --> 02:40:19,960
I'm kind of scared, but I'm also like, that's a lot of waste.

3280
02:40:20,160 --> 02:40:22,440
Like, why couldn't it just be in one fucking box?

3281
02:40:22,640 --> 02:40:24,720
Like, but you know what?

3282
02:40:24,720 --> 02:40:26,040
I'm cat condo.

3283
02:40:26,120 --> 02:40:27,640
You know what he gave me last year?

3284
02:40:28,280 --> 02:40:29,240
Do you know what he gave me last year?

3285
02:40:29,240 --> 02:40:31,680
That actually lasts a long time over there.

3286
02:40:31,760 --> 02:40:35,520
It, uh, it was the syrup and, but the pumpkin creamers, they actually, there

3287
02:40:35,520 --> 02:40:40,080
was like four boxes of pumpkin creamers gave me a box, I gave you a lot.

3288
02:40:40,080 --> 02:40:43,840
And then I, I put it out at work and I just invited coworkers to come

3289
02:40:43,840 --> 02:40:45,360
over and steal them and they did.

3290
02:40:45,360 --> 02:40:46,400
And you know, it was great.

3291
02:40:46,760 --> 02:40:47,360
Shared the love.

3292
02:40:47,360 --> 02:40:50,960
So anyway, uh, all I can say is the classic Jesse Spano line.

3293
02:40:50,960 --> 02:40:51,800
I'm so excited.

3294
02:40:51,800 --> 02:40:52,600
I'm so excited.

3295
02:40:52,600 --> 02:40:53,360
I'm so scared.

3296
02:40:53,880 --> 02:40:55,760
Last but not least, dark soccer, your final thought.

3297
02:40:56,240 --> 02:40:58,560
Um, I've got a really busy week.

3298
02:40:58,600 --> 02:41:00,000
I've got a con guide to finish.

3299
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:01,800
I've got Rosh Hashanah service tomorrow.

3300
02:41:01,840 --> 02:41:03,000
I've got to take mid into the vet.

3301
02:41:03,960 --> 02:41:07,560
Got a lot of crap on my plate, but I can do it.

3302
02:41:08,120 --> 02:41:09,040
You can do it myself.

3303
02:41:09,080 --> 02:41:09,720
I believe in you.

3304
02:41:10,480 --> 02:41:11,920
And maybe there's another design thing.

3305
02:41:11,920 --> 02:41:13,240
I might be interested.

3306
02:41:13,400 --> 02:41:14,000
We'll talk later.

3307
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,800
Rob, do you believe in life after love?

3308
02:41:17,120 --> 02:41:17,760
Uh, of course.

3309
02:41:20,640 --> 02:41:21,120
All right.

3310
02:41:21,640 --> 02:41:23,480
Anyway, uh, that's it.

3311
02:41:23,520 --> 02:41:24,240
Bye everybody.

3312
02:41:24,280 --> 02:41:24,720
Good night.

3313
02:41:24,760 --> 02:41:25,680
We'll see you next time.

3314
02:41:25,760 --> 02:41:26,760
Uh, here at orange sounds radio.

3315
02:41:26,760 --> 02:41:27,920

3316
02:41:27,920 --> 02:41:28,480
Sound good.

3317
02:41:28,720 --> 02:41:29,040
Bye.

3318
02:41:29,040 --> 02:41:29,360
Bye.

3319
02:41:30,120 --> 02:41:32,760
