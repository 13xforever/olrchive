7000	14000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	18000	This week, we want WoW Classic. You don't want WoW Classic. Okay, you can have WoW Classic.
18000	21000	WoW Classic is too crowded. We are de-dossing WoW Classic.
21000	27000	This is just another week in Gaming Society. Stay tuned for the rest of the updates and gaming news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	38000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
38000	46000	It is Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight with episode number 791 for this September the 8th of 2019.
46000	52000	Yes, we're back live here at Twitch.tv slash VOG Network after a break for a couple weeks.
52000	56000	We had a show that was recorded in advance a couple weeks ago and that went pretty well.
56000	61000	I saw the chat and you guys participated along with that. That was great. I think we'll do that again in the future.
61000	64000	We're going to have a pre-planned show that we're missing.
64000	71000	And then we were off last week because of Dragon Con Labor Day anniversary for the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
71000	72000	Yep, that was fun.
72000	74000	Hi, how are you and Dan?
74000	75000	We're good.
75000	79000	Good. Weird question. How was your anniversary? I should specifically have asked.
79000	84000	It was fun. We went to Midtown and had dinner at the Waterboy.
84000	86000	Oh, that's a fancy place.
86000	87000	It's a little fancy.
87000	88000	Fancy pants.
88000	94000	And they brought us out, you know, a Prosecco toast and we were happy. A little booze.
94000	100000	Just chilled. It was a nice chill five day weekend for me.
100000	106000	Good, good. Yeah, it was a long weekend for me too, obviously. I was out of town for 10 days.
106000	112000	And Saturday, I think I went to a little bit of a fancy pants restaurant, too. We were in Atlanta, Dragon Con, obviously.
112000	121000	And sometimes it is honestly faster, instead of trying to eat at the food courts down there, to just walk one block away from Dragon Con.
121000	129000	Call a Lyft or Uber, whatever you like, to pick you up and take you to Midtown a mile away where there's lots of nice restaurants.
129000	131000	That's an expert I did one night. It was fantastic.
131000	139000	And Metal Mayhem, no, it is not themed after a stupid ass Adam Sandler movie because people actually have taste.
139000	142000	Unlike, you know, I mean, some places here in Sacramento have taste.
142000	151000	There's another bar that is under a lot of scrutiny for having a very racist disclaimer outside of their restaurant or whatever.
151000	154000	I only heard about that when I got back. Sometimes I'm glad to miss news.
154000	156000	Actually, the news came up after you got back.
156000	158000	Oh, I thought it was when I was gone.
158000	163000	No, but at any rate, the water boy is like super fancy. So just saying.
163000	164000	Cool.
164000	165000	Casual fancy, actually.
165000	175000	All right. And of course, that comment and more in our chat room because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geekies Network, vognetwork.com at twitch.tv slash vognetwork.
175000	178000	And you can chat along with us here at Twitch with myself, DarkSakura.
178000	182000	And of course, we cannot forget right there. He's right there. You can't miss him. It's Techmaster Loki.
182000	183000	I'm right here.
183000	184000	How are you?
184000	185000	I'm good.
185000	186000	What are you reading about with Animal Crossing?
186000	189000	Oh, that's our kickoff topic coming up. I see. I thought it was an Animal Crossing related thing.
189000	191000	I was like, oh, technically, I guess.
191000	192000	OK.
192000	195000	But you should see the groups I'm in.
195000	198000	Everyone has psych has analyzed every little frame.
198000	200000	But we'll get into that.
200000	208000	Is that one of those like when a new Pokemon trailer comes out, there's like a three hour discussion, YouTube, about the 15 second trailer.
208000	209000	Yeah, pretty much.
209000	212000	I'm in an Animal Crossing New Horizons group on Facebook.
212000	214000	And yes, that's what people do.
214000	221000	Fun. We have like lots of like there's like lots of little things we've got to catch up on for not having been here for a few weeks.
221000	228000	So before we get into the kickoff topic, let's address some of those outstanding news, outstanding agenda items from last week's meeting.
228000	229000	Yes.
229000	233000	Let's let's go over the action items from last time last time we had a meeting.
233000	241000	So first off, I want to give a big thank you to everybody I saw and met, networked with, talked to, had fun with at Dragon Con 2019.
241000	247000	I'm actually wearing my Dragon Con badge tonight and sprinkled some effects from the con throughout the studio tonight.
247000	251000	But I had a great time at Dragon Con. Awesome panels. Great.
251000	259000	Some some some familiar faces from Twitch, places like giant size team up and so forth that I've worked with before they got to work with again.
259000	267000	And new faces as well on many panels, some great like cosplay folks on Twitch here, some other video game channels and so forth.
267000	275000	Just a great year for like networking and talking a big, big thank you to the video game track for having me back to do a last minute Battle Royale panel,
275000	278000	which we talked a little bit about at the tail end of the Bobby Blackwell show this week.
278000	283000	And also, I got to moderate the World of Warcraft voice actors panel, which was great.
283000	287000	The talent on there was so, so good.
287000	295000	So many great voice actors loved hearing Dave Fennoy, who's the voice actor for Volgen, was actually doing so he does a lot with The Walking Dead.
295000	298000	He's a very nice buddy. Oh, yeah. He's a very well-known voice actor.
298000	305000	He's great. Dino does a lot of the like a goblin gnome type voices like Professor Putricide and stuff.
305000	310000	He's hilarious. He has a lot of the comedy events there as well. Let's see. Samantha, you know, a heart.
310000	314000	She was really she was just adorable and she she has a really high pitched voice.
314000	320000	So I was like, I already know what characters you're seeing just based on your voice. But she was so sweet.
320000	326000	I liked her a lot. Quentin Flynn, I had a panel with him last year because he's also a voice in Mass Effect.
326000	330000	But he's also the voice of Kael'Thas, which, you know, he's very commanding presence and voice.
330000	335000	So it was a lot of fun to be with him. That's a very dramatic voice. Yes. Yes.
335000	340000	It's funny because some of the voices are like, oh, you're a boss that I've wiped to in this game a lot of times.
340000	347000	And then not that I'm going to play favorites, but maybe a little bit just because I love Kimberly Brooks.
347000	353000	Like she was just I love them all, but I really love Kimberly Brooks. And she, of course, is Ashley in Mass Effect.
353000	355000	But she has a resume. She's also a Laura. OK, yeah.
355000	361000	If I were to open up Kimberly Brooks's resume, it would be like that thing where I open up the scroll and then the scroll falls on the ground and starts rolling.
361000	367000	Because that's like her resume. And yeah, she was she was so friendly and nice and great.
367000	371000	So, yeah, just it was a real honor to work with everybody on that panel.
371000	375000	So, yeah. And yeah, Dragon Con was was wonderful.
375000	385000	A big thank you. Just personally, I don't think he listens to this program, but I have to thank Charles McFall for who is the director of the digital media track for like just everything.
385000	390000	Like the belief he's had in myself and Bobby and our abilities and so forth over the years.
390000	394000	And I feel like I really owe him a lot for a lot of the opportunities I've gotten at Dragon Con.
394000	397000	So I just want to give a big thank you. And of course, you know, not to leave anybody.
397000	403000	Obviously, I get to spend the weekend with Bobby Blackwolf and Jennifer and we had a lot of fun.
403000	408000	And my pal Extrofer from Guys on a Show back in the day went to his first Dragon Con.
408000	415000	Cool. And we had a lot of fun. If you want to hear more about it, you can check out the archives here at VOG Network on Twitch.
415000	419000	We did a little special show midweek. We did Guys on a Dragon Con.
419000	425000	So we were playing Overwatch, which it was it was tough because it was we were getting really distracted by Overwatch the first 15 minutes.
425000	430000	But when we kind of scaled it back and did one on one matches instead, we were able to like talk a lot about.
430000	438000	So if you want to hear the stories about how Extrofer and I got invited to meet Twitter friends at a public gathering where all the men were not wearing pants.
438000	445000	Just I'm gonna leave that I'm gonna leave that teaser right there so you can go check that out Guys on a Dragon Con in the Twitch archive.
445000	449000	You do have to be a subscriber to access the video archive here on Twitch.
449000	455000	But good news. A lot of you guys get your free subscription with Twitch Prime and it's September.
455000	462000	So it's really cheap. This it's like half off this month. So if you are feeling so inclined, you can subscribe to VOG Network on Twitch.
462000	466000	That's the last I'll plug that though. I don't want to I don't want to commercial commercial commercial all the things.
466000	473000	But thank you. Thank you. Thank you to everybody involved with Dragon Con. I had a fantastic time once again, and I will see you in 2020.
474000	477000	Okay, an outstanding agenda item. I have to ask you about Loki.
477000	483000	We've been following this on the past few weeks of the show. So you were going to participate in a game jam.
483000	489000	And I did. And now here's the thing. I could see you were broadcasting, but obviously I'm at a con. I can't really watch.
489000	496000	Yeah. And you're the three hour time difference is really killer too. So I could see you were broadcasting, but I never got to see past like day two.
496000	500000	What became. So walk me through your game jam journey quickly.
500000	506000	So I had taken a couple of days off to work on my game jam game.
506000	512000	But I knew like from the get go that time was going to be a problem because I have a day job and family.
512000	519000	And it's just hard to be able to dedicate enough time to a game jam at all.
519000	524000	So I thought, hey, maybe, you know, if it's a week long, maybe I might have a better chance. Still was a problem.
524000	527000	So but it I thought it went OK.
527000	534000	Like so I got the concept down and I started building the game and I'm still working on it.
534000	538000	I'm not going to give up on it. It's just that I didn't finish it by the deadline, which is fine.
538000	542000	But like looking at what other people did, like my initial focus.
542000	549000	OK, so let me back up. So I did the thing called a community game jam and the theme ended up being the game is a liar.
549000	552000	And so that was the theme. And we had to kind of figure out what to do with that.
552000	559000	Now, my initial thought was, OK, let's just make it. I want to be the guy type of game or something like that or Kaizo Mario type of game.
559000	565000	But a lot of people did that shit. And so I was like, I don't want to do that because that's just the obvious thing.
565000	570000	Did you fall into the typical Loki trap of I may I picked because I had to be different.
570000	575000	I picked a project that was too big for me to take on in the time frame.
575000	579000	No, it wasn't really. I did. I kept simplifying it as I went along.
579000	584000	So I don't think it was that it was just I didn't have enough time to work on it because I had to do it.
584000	590000	I ended up having less time dedicated to it than I could have been dedicated to it.
590000	594000	So but you are committing to finish. Yes. Yes, I'm going to finish.
594000	602000	So so what it ended up being, it was this game called Bullshot because the premise of it is that Loki, this is a family show.
602000	608000	Watch your language. No, of course, you know, that's industry term for like media that represents something.
608000	614000	At a much better quality than it actually ends up being not representative of the final product, if you will.
614000	624000	So the premise is that you're testing these weapons made by this company called Bullshot Arms, where all of the guns look really amazing,
624000	634000	but they all suck in a different way. And so you have to overcome the the flaws in these weapons to in order to progress through the game.
635000	639000	You went with like a reverse Gungeon idea kind of. It sounds like sort of.
639000	644000	Yeah. So it's basically it's a top down twin six shooter like Smash TV.
644000	651000	And that's kind of how I set it up. And so I've been just going through right now and getting the gameplay stuff done.
651000	662000	I recently just deleted my level because I'm rebuilding it with a 3D tileset instead of just it was just like a template thing that I built out of cubes.
662000	672000	So I'm kind of taking it a little further with that. It's just been adding stuff to it, but it just got to the point where like I knew that like I could feel like more of my progress was time wise.
672000	677000	And like I think by like the end of Tuesday, I'm like, I'm not going to finish this on time. There's no way.
677000	687000	So but I kept going through it. But I did stream the entire time. Well, not the entire time, but like each day I did stream and I did end up hitting Twitch affiliate this that last week.
687000	704000	So that was cool. And I like the actually the live development stuff. And as I'm going along doing it, I kind of got more ideas with like, oh, hey, this would be kind of cool to like come up with a concept and just keep working at it like slowly and not necessarily under the time pressure of a game jam.
704000	715000	I still want to do more of them, but like I just I'm not like a college student or somebody that can like that has like, OK, I'm a block out 48 hours dedicated to that.
715000	721000	Like, I can't do that. I can't just just commit to finishing the one. It's OK. You can finish late. It's OK.
721000	728000	Our listeners will be so happy to play a Loki game. Exactly. And looking at some of the other game people finish too soon and looking well, looking at some.
729000	739000	Well, I see what you did there. Your little your little bull shot jab there now. But, you know, I bet a lot of the people that did finish something, they're probably going to still refine it.
739000	749000	Right. And there's some that like were out there, like I played some of the games that were like, you know, I feel that they were really rough. But then maybe that's I'm maybe I'm set my standards way too high for a game jam.
749000	754000	Yeah, but even yes, even warmer, warmer.
754000	762000	Fine, whatever. But like I thought I lowered my standards enough and I kept like I kept going, OK, well, I got to make this easier and easier and easier.
762000	768000	But like, I don't know, I just didn't want to do the obvious thing, which is like a Kaiser Mario thing, because I saw so many of those out there.
768000	772000	In fact, like the guys, those are annoying. Let's slam all those people that chose to.
772000	782000	No, no, no. And it's not that's not bad. Like even the guy like one of the the you guys finished one of the guys that did it like Braxis or whatever he's one put one of the creators putting on the thing.
782000	790000	That's what he did. He did one of those. But like the his twist on it was that like he using the mouse, you can kind of see where all the traps are and stuff.
790000	796000	And so that was kind of cool. But, OK, that's clever. I mean, I guess next time I'll just do something even simpler.
796000	799000	But I like where I was going with this and I think it'll be cool.
799000	808000	I will say this. I think it is really cool that you kind of like I don't want I don't know if it was like holding yourself accountable or whatever, but like the fact that you chose to like live stream it and do it that way.
808000	814000	I thought was a really cool idea. And I do see in chat like Quest Buster in chat says, I watched a few of Loki streams. It was looking good.
814000	819000	His concept was cool. And so I do think that is really cool that at least you like documented what you have.
819000	825000	And I hope you want to continue it. And I probably will start live streaming it again at some point.
825000	830000	You know, obviously not as often, but I have been working on it almost every day.
830000	837000	So it does look much better than it was. I mean, I'm looking over his shoulder.
837000	842000	It's hard to see. I can't just magically put it on the camera, but I can see he's working on something.
842000	847000	I don't know what the fuck any of it is, but I see I see vectors and shapes and things.
847000	854000	It's it's basically a level with the doors still there, but the level parts deleted out of it because because I deleted it out.
854000	859000	I just had an inspiration for a name of an L.A. game, but I don't know what it's going to be.
859000	863000	It's along the lines of Pixel Shit's Vecturds. Vecturds.
863000	868000	It would be that it would be when Pixel Shit's goes 3D. Vecturds. Vecturds. Yes.
868000	872000	Hey, Y Y R. Sequel Vecturd. I'm sure he'll get the right.
872000	876000	Oh, yeah. Like just even like going and we'll talk about it later.
876000	881000	I went to an event this weekend. Also watch, you know, looking at what some other indie developers are working on.
881000	890000	That's upcoming business. I understand. But like, you know, like what they do, there's a thing called a progressive game jam where they're working on game jam games over the course of like several months.
890000	898000	Also, though, at a time frame that I can't participate, I would love to participate in that, but I can't at the time that it's at.
898000	904000	It's like five hours every Saturday. I'm very nervous to propose another vog game jam after the last one.
904000	907000	I took so long to follow. Oh, we need to do it.
907000	916000	But OK, well, what if we did some type of like virtual progressive thing at a time you can do it and we all like stream a certain.
916000	921000	Why not? Not we. Because I I'll I'll do something. I won't do a game making, but maybe something else.
921000	928000	You can do a game jam like they have like a game. There's like play make a twine game.
928000	931000	Well, they have like playmaker and stuff. That's all it's all visual, like block based stuff.
931000	938000	So, I mean, we could do something, but maybe choose a block of time that you can do and we can we can do that for a few weeks.
938000	944000	Yeah. Well, and also like the thing is like it's nice to be in this and keep doing it and stuff.
944000	949000	And as I'm going along, of course, every time you do it, you learn stuff from it and you get better.
949000	955000	And that's that's the whole point. Why do it like I knew that there was a very slim chance that I would make it in time.
955000	959000	I was hoping that I would, but it's it's the learning process.
959000	961000	And you already have your first sign up.
961000	965000	Dar Tetsuya says, if you want to do a game jam, let me know. I'd love to dust off multimedia fusion two again.
965000	968000	I'll even stream it. I think we should do it.
968000	972000	Yeah, I really do. But yeah, soon. But yeah, we'll see.
972000	976000	We'll see more of this project. This is not something I'm going to be giving up on.
976000	980000	And it's been actually really fun. So the game plays there, which is the important part.
980000	988000	So now I'm just getting the level stuff done and then I have to add a ton of guns because that's the whole point is there's a ton of guns in the game.
988000	991000	And I only have two right now.
991000	994000	All right. One more outstanding action item that I can think of.
994000	998000	And then we need to get into our kickoff topic. What? We're only like 15 minutes into the show.
998000	1001000	Haven't gotten to gaming news yet, but this one is really important.
1001000	1008000	So over the summer, I was giving you all the saga of the online survivor game that I was playing.
1008000	1012000	The survivor LARP that I was participating is what I kind of referred to it as.
1012000	1016000	And I won. Shock and awe. I actually won. It was first place out.
1017000	1022000	22 people. Do you all remember what my prize was? What I was going to win for?
1022000	1028000	Because the budget didn't have a million dollars. A blanket with either the game's logo or my face on it.
1028000	1033000	And guess what, everybody? All right. The blanket. It looks like a towel, kind of.
1033000	1038000	Can you guys talk for the podcast? Rob has a giant towel with his face on it.
1038000	1044000	I assume it's his face on it. Oh, my God.
1044000	1051000	Oh, good Lord. Yeah.
1051000	1058000	It's Princess Rob. And now because is it like your name is over the top of it at the bottom, but you had your shirt.
1058000	1063000	This is Princess on it. So this is Princess Rob. It does kind of say Princess Rob.
1063000	1067000	I don't know if the host intended that, but I think it's hilarious.
1067000	1071000	But the other thing is that this is the princess daddy shirt.
1071000	1075000	I think this is. Is this the one that Delvin got me? I think.
1075000	1079000	No, he got me the strawberry beefcake one. No. Princess Daddy I found somewhere else.
1079000	1085000	And it was just it was I don't know. It was funny. So I wore it and I wore it when I took the picture.
1085000	1090000	Not knowing that at some point it would end up being on a victor's blanket.
1094000	1100000	Funny. So I thought. So here's my next idea. So you notice how, like, it's all like white, like around the outside.
1100000	1104000	Like it's just like it's just begging to be defaced. Right. With sharpies.
1104000	1114000	So dark, dark soccer's eyes, just like like it totally just did the cartoon thing where they slanted downwards like evil thoughts are entering your mind.
1114000	1122000	But no, it's not for you. But I actually so I'm meeting one of the other players is going to be out here in San Francisco in like three weeks.
1122000	1127000	So I'm going to get him to sign it and then I'm going to be out in New York and one of the other players lives out there.
1127000	1136000	I'm going to get him to sign it. So I'm going to try my next goal is to get all the players and people that were involved in the game to sign it in the upcoming years.
1136000	1141000	I'll stop the order for the incredible glow in the dark paint called Lit.
1141000	1146000	So I was like one of the players is in the UK. One of the producers was in Australia.
1146000	1150000	I was going to take a little time to travel the world and get all that.
1150000	1156000	So there we go. Awesome. Except it's really hot. I would love to wear this for the whole show, but it's it's really hot.
1156000	1162000	So I think I'll be in the winter. Maybe in the winter I will. So I'm going to give this blanket back to Pikachu.
1162000	1167000	So let's get into our actual kickoff topic tonight. Get into video games.
1167000	1171000	There was a pretty big, pretty big Nintendo news event this year, wasn't there?
1171000	1180000	So they did Nintendo Direct. And as we figured, because it is coming up on the one year anniversary of Nintendo Switch Online,
1180000	1188000	they announced, as we figured they would, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System Nintendo channel type thing.
1188000	1196000	So basically you can play retro Super Nintendo games much like you could with the NES classics.
1196000	1201000	Some of the games or the games that are included in the initial release.
1201000	1209000	Brawl Brothers, Demon's Crest, Breath of Fire F-Zero, Joan Mack 2, Lost in the Tropics, Kirby's Dream Course,
1209000	1217000	Kirby's Dream Land 3, Pilot Wing, Star Fox, Stunt Race FX, Super EDF, Super Ghouls and Ghosts, Super Mario Kart,
1217000	1224000	Super Mario World, Super Mario World 2, Yoshi's Island, Super Metroid, Super Puyo Puyo 2, Super Soccer, Super Tennis,
1224000	1229000	and The Legend of Zelda, A Link to the Past. So that's pretty awesome.
1229000	1234000	One thing, though, that was interesting that kind of...
1234000	1243000	is that they mentioned that they're not going to be adding games regularly anymore to the NES and Super NES stuff.
1243000	1252000	So that's kind of... I'm surprised. Like, it wasn't a lot already, and now we're getting even less. I don't know.
1252000	1259000	I'm not surprised about that at all, actually, just because it takes them off that monthly schedule that everybody's kind of like beholding them to,
1259000	1265000	and they just might not have enough agreements or whatever in there. I mean, I'm disappointed, don't get me wrong, because I am a big fan of...
1265000	1270000	and by the way, just totally ate a story that's coming up later, but that's okay. We'll correct the sidebar here in a moment.
1270000	1271000	Sorry.
1271000	1278000	That's okay. So they obviously kind of feel like they're held to this monthly schedule of game releases,
1278000	1286000	and the reality is that maybe they don't want to be held to that monthly standard because they may just not have enough agreements
1286000	1295000	on the Super Nintendo side from third parties and what have you, especially since we know companies like Square Enix released that collection of Mana,
1295000	1300000	which that's where Secret of Mana is at, and it did very... I'm assuming it did pretty well for themselves.
1300000	1310000	So I wouldn't expect, you know, unlike the hardware SNES classic, I would not expect that we're going to get like Final Fantasy 2 and 3.
1310000	1316000	I use my quotey fingers because we all know they're 4 and 6 Japan, but when they were released here, they were Final Fantasy 2 and 3.
1316000	1325000	I would not hold my breath that those will ever come to this online service because the reality is if Square Enix wants to do that,
1325000	1332000	they're going to just release those games independently. What I really wish they do is do a port of Final Fantasy 4 on PSP.
1332000	1335000	That's the version I really want on Switch, to be honest.
1335000	1340000	But anyway, I don't necessarily see that maybe the third party participation is going to be as high.
1340000	1344000	Obviously, it's there. Yes, we have Capcom games in here. We have Data East in here.
1344000	1347000	We do have third parties. I'm not saying third parties are not going to happen.
1347000	1351000	I just feel like maybe Nintendo does not have all those agreements lined up.
1351000	1358000	They're probably projecting their schedule and they can't stay on a monthly schedule, so they're going to do basically more when they feel like it.
1358000	1369000	Maybe it'll work out a little better actually because as interesting as those SP releases were, let's be real, they're just glorified save states.
1369000	1380000	That's all they are, right? So maybe they'll incorporate those somewhat differently so they don't feel they have to release these SP games just to buff up the number of games they're offering.
1380000	1388000	So maybe if we only get releases every three months, well maybe we're going to get ten games every three months.
1388000	1391000	That's still probably a little high, but it's like seven games every three months or something.
1391000	1398000	We're still feeling like, ooh, this is a big gush of games. We'll see.
1398000	1406000	They announced a new character for Smash Ultimate, so Terry Bogard from Fatal Fury is going to be coming to Smash Ultimate.
1407000	1412000	And they also announced that there are going to be even more DLC characters coming as well outside of the Fighter's Pass.
1415000	1417000	What else? We've got Tokio...
1417000	1424000	Can I say the Terry Bogard thing? There's a lot of people on Twitter and so forth that are just kind of like, what? Who? Huh?
1424000	1429000	But I really like Fatal Fury. Fatal Fury is my favorite of the Neo-Jovians.
1429000	1434000	I like the video they did where the thing going through everybody's different hands.
1434000	1435000	Wasn't that great?
1435000	1442000	Yeah, and Dan and I were like, we were just like, could you imagine Yuri in Smash? That would be hilarious.
1442000	1446000	Now, I don't want a tinfoil hat, but maybe I'm going to tinfoil hat a little bit, okay?
1446000	1451000	So they announced as part of that that they're not going to end it after one more character.
1451000	1455000	Originally they said five DLC characters, but they announced there's going to be more, right?
1455000	1462000	I will just point out, in that little montage of people grabbing the envelopes and flopping, you know who else wasn't there?
1462000	1470000	Mai. And I'm just saying, if there's another Fatal Fury character that is kind of legendary, it's Mai.
1470000	1472000	And I would love it if she was there.
1472000	1479000	And there's also other characters they didn't show like Shizumaru or Cham Cham or so many other SNK characters.
1479000	1486000	But I'm thinking of flagship SNK characters just because obviously Terry Bogard and Mai were in almost every single Fatal Fury game.
1486000	1487000	Mai wasn't in the first one.
1487000	1492000	They were skipping through a lot of the Samurai Shodown characters, which were really big characters.
1492000	1495000	Fair. So again, I'm tinfoil hatting a little bit.
1495000	1497000	If they brought in Hanzo, though, that would be pretty badass.
1497000	1503000	But I love that Terry Bogard's in there just because of the SNK fighting games, I love Fatal Fury. It's a good one.
1503000	1512000	I like the Mii characters. One of them is Sans from Undertale.
1512000	1514000	So that was pretty cool.
1514000	1523000	I'm surprised with the Terry Bogard character that they did in there. They didn't do the gender swap Terry Bogard from the all female fighting game that SNK did just recently.
1523000	1530000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. The one that was, I can't remember the name of it, but you're right. They had the whole female fighter thing that came out.
1530000	1532000	But they had, yeah, female Terry Bogard.
1532000	1536000	Tammy Bogard. No, I don't know what the name was. But yeah, they gender swapped a lot of characters.
1536000	1539000	I just, I don't know. Did they bring back Ms. X?
1539000	1545000	Oh, Bobby got a good point. Don't forget all the SNK, all the Smash characters have like eight different costumes.
1545000	1549000	Perhaps one of the Terry costumes will be the gender swap Terry.
1549000	1550000	Maybe.
1550000	1553000	That's a very good thought from Bobby. SNK heroines.
1553000	1556000	Terry is a girl's name. You died of dysentery.
1557000	1567000	Alright, anyway. Let's see. So, there's a Wii U port of Tokyo Mirage Sessions, FE Encore.
1567000	1572000	And that's coming out in January. That was a Wii U game at one time.
1572000	1583000	Deadly Premonition was getting a sequel and then they ported Deadly Premonition, I guess the original one is Deadly Premonition Origins, which came out the same day.
1583000	1594000	They'll be doing Assassin's Creed Rebel Collection, which is a port of Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag and Assassin's Creed Rogue.
1594000	1599000	The Xenoblade Chronicles Definitive Edition coming in 2020.
1599000	1604000	This was a big one. Overwatch is coming to the Switch in October.
1604000	1610000	Yeah, those rumors were really gaining steam through the Wii. Ever since we kind of finished our last episode, it was like there was lots of the Overwatch stuff.
1610000	1613000	Well, that's one less thing that's going to be at a...
1613000	1619000	Blizzcon. Yeah, one less Blizzcon. Well, I'm sure it'll be there and they might do tournaments or something, but yeah.
1619000	1622000	What do you think about Overwatch on the Switch?
1622000	1623000	That's cool.
1623000	1626000	Yeah, I think it's cool and there's definitely a lot of people that want it.
1626000	1636000	I'm just going to say it is a little bit that this game's been out for several years now and it seems to be they're releasing mostly the same game again.
1636000	1641000	I hear there are like, ooh, you can do tilt controls and you do Junkrat's little rip tire and stuff.
1641000	1645000	Okay, cute, but let's be real. That's not a real feature, okay?
1645000	1652000	So like I would have thought it would have been cool if maybe like you could play offline in like a LAN mode.
1652000	1656000	Like Overwatch has one versus one in it.
1656000	1660000	Hello. That's what Xfer and I did most of our streaming on earlier this week was one versus one.
1660000	1670000	So you could do like some LAN stuff or if I'm at a convention like Dragoncon or Blizzcon and I want to play with a bunch of other people, we should be able to do an impromptu match, not necessarily tied to online.
1670000	1675000	It would be unranked and you wouldn't get any of the points for loot boxes. Sure, all that would...
1675000	1682000	But there's a way you can do it. Like if you're going to say, but, but, but this particular online restriction, you're nickel and diming it.
1682000	1691000	They could do it offline if they really wanted to, but they're not. And that's further exacerbated by the fact that you can't even really buy the cartridge.
1691000	1698000	You just buy the physical edition is just a code, which I get like Overwatch is a very like online centric game. Yes.
1698000	1702000	But I'm just saying it would have been nice. They could have done these kind of like extra little things.
1702000	1706000	They're not going to charge $60 for it, are they? Do we know the MSRP for this?
1706000	1711000	I don't know, but I just, you know, I don't think they would charge 60 bucks for that.
1711000	1718000	I don't think so either. I heard 40, but I didn't hear it like in a, that is 100% the way it's going to be way.
1718000	1724000	But I'm just going to point out Overwatch has been a game that's been on sale for $20 multiple times now.
1724000	1729000	So to kind of justify the Switch thing, like as rad as I think it is that it's on the Switch.
1730000	1734000	Like A, this should have happened probably at least a year ago.
1734000	1741000	B, I need the price to be a little bit more reasonable because 40. So they are going to charge 40 for it.
1741000	1745000	But here's the thing. So that's on that's on the high end.
1745000	1754000	Hold on. So it's $40, but it also includes three months of Nintendo Switch Online with the physical version that's out.
1754000	1760000	I don't know what the online version is going to be costing. Maybe like 30?
1760000	1767000	Maybe. Well, we'll see. Some folks in chat over Twitch TV slash VOG Network.
1767000	1773000	Kaijuto says Overwatch is a sports game, so don't expect it to change. They won't do an Overwatch 2.
1773000	1780000	I wouldn't rule out an Overwatch 2 completely, but I do completely understand what you mean about like Overwatch League and all this.
1780000	1783000	Like they don't want to roll out a replacement for the game that's in the league.
1783000	1786000	They're going to continue making enhancements to what they have.
1786000	1792000	But I could see an Overwatch expansion. Blizzard is very big on expansions, right?
1792000	1798000	And not necessarily expansions with like characters. Not that, but I would think like maybe a single player campaign expansion.
1798000	1805000	Think along the lines of those events they do for the rising, the rising events they do.
1805000	1808000	Something where you could kind of do that a little more in like a single player type of way.
1808000	1813000	I could see Overwatch going in that direction for Switch, PC, and all the platforms really.
1813000	1816000	That's what I could see happening as opposed to like an Overwatch 2.
1816000	1821000	I would agree that their base Overwatch game probably not going to change for a while.
1821000	1831000	They'll probably do another version of it for PlayStation 5 and the next Xbox that runs on the same engine, but just more better-er graphics.
1831000	1834000	To use a technical term.
1834000	1840000	Some other announcements. Divinity Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition is out on the Switch.
1840000	1848000	Game Freak's town is now being called Little Town Hero. It's coming out October 16th.
1848000	1856000	Bethesda is re-releasing Doom 64 on the Switch on November 22nd.
1856000	1859000	Will I need to be logged into my Bethesda.net account to continue?
1859000	1861000	Hopefully they won't do that this time.
1861000	1867000	Star Wars Jedi Knight 2 Jedi Outcast will be available on the Switch later this month.
1867000	1870000	I'm reporting some of these old games here.
1870000	1877000	Super Kirby Clash, which is a free-to-play Kirby game, was released.
1877000	1884000	Luigi's Mansion 3 Scream Park mode. They say it's like a multiplayer version of it.
1884000	1889000	It's two to eight players against each other in like an arena with ghost battles.
1889000	1892000	They showed some more stuff for Pokemon Sword and Shield.
1892000	1897000	They had a new mode called Pokemon Camp.
1897000	1901000	I guess you can play with your Pokemon and do customization.
1901000	1902000	And cook things.
1902000	1903000	And cook things.
1903000	1905000	Lots and lots of hot dogs.
1905000	1907000	Hot dogs or curry rice?
1907000	1908000	Yes.
1908000	1915000	And then Animal Crossing New Horizons. They showed also some updates with that, including some of the crafting stuff that you can do.
1915000	1919000	And now Darkstalker and I will start the four-hour dissection of the information that was discussed.
1919000	1926000	Some of the other things that were noticed, though, by the way, is that they did change some textures between the build they showed before and this one.
1926000	1932000	They also carry around bags. There's a fishing box that you can carry around.
1932000	1933000	I can have a murse?
1933000	1934000	You can have a murse.
1934000	1935000	Yes.
1935000	1941000	But they also have badges that you can put on different doors and things. So more outside house customization.
1942000	1949000	I'm really impressed. I've been sitting here beating the drum of the core Animal Crossing game needs to freaking be updated.
1949000	1953000	Because essentially it didn't really change from the GameCube version to the Wii version.
1953000	1955000	Like little tweaks here and there.
1955000	1959000	But this one looks like you're decorating the outdoors and shit.
1959000	1961000	There's more stuff you're doing.
1961000	1963000	Animals can wear pants.
1963000	1967000	What kind of oppressive society are we creating?
1967000	1974000	Can we do one thing, though? Because this is an online game, which I'm assuming requires Nintendo Switch Online.
1974000	1983000	So we already have established that I probably would have Nintendo Switch Online, which includes Nintendo and Super Nintendo games.
1983000	1989000	Can we put those back in there and have consoles and everything like we used to do in the original Animal Crossing?
1989000	1991000	Since we technically already have access to those.
1991000	1994000	Technically the original Animal Crossing didn't have the games in them.
1994000	1997000	Fine. The one that came out on the GameCube.
1997000	2001000	That is original to us here in the States, yes.
2004000	2006000	I love it when she drills us on the 10-pound.
2006000	2009000	And technically when I said Animal Crossing I wasn't talking about Animal Kingdom.
2009000	2012000	Or Animal Forest, whatever.
2012000	2014000	Anyway.
2014000	2019000	Well, I mean, the suggestion you make, it seems workable.
2019000	2024000	But we're also assuming that Animal Crossing will require Nintendo Online.
2024000	2026000	It probably won't, actually.
2026000	2028000	It probably won't require it.
2028000	2032000	It's only going to require it if you want one of those gates.
2032000	2035000	You go visit other people's town and use any of the online features.
2035000	2040000	Fine. How about it allows you to do it if you have Nintendo Online.
2040000	2043000	So if you don't have it, you can't play them.
2043000	2050000	Yeah, maybe the Nintendo games only come from doing some type of exchange with your friends.
2050000	2053000	Or going somewhere you can only get to outside the gate.
2053000	2057000	Like in Animal Crossing Mega Mall or something that has the games. I don't know.
2057000	2060000	Alright. Anyways, some other stuff that they announced.
2060000	2068000	Trials of Mana, I guess remake of Desuetsu 3 will be available next April.
2068000	2070000	Nice.
2070000	2074000	Return of Obra Dinn is coming out this fall.
2074000	2078000	That's a cool looking, kind of like a pirate type game.
2078000	2083000	Which is all done in black and white dither graphics, which is kind of cool.
2083000	2089000	Rogue Company is a new team based shooter from Hi-Rez Studios coming out in 2020.
2089000	2092000	Tetris 99 is getting a new mode called Invictus.
2092000	2098000	Which is basically Tetris 99 with the best of the best players.
2099000	2103000	Also there's going to be a two player versus CPU mode.
2103000	2109000	And those are going to be coming out as well as part of a packaged version of the game coming out.
2109000	2111000	Or actually already came out.
2113000	2119000	And then there's another Daemon X Machina demo that was launched last week.
2119000	2121000	Which will probably be the last one.
2121000	2124000	So friends of mine were playing that and thought the character customization was fun.
2124000	2128000	What was that game though where you're on the British battleship or something?
2128000	2131000	That's the Return of Obra Dinn.
2131000	2134000	Yeah that game was interesting. Really interesting.
2134000	2141000	Yeah you have a watch that you can set stuff back in time so you can see how people died to solve some puzzle or something.
2141000	2145000	Bobby Blackwolf with a hot take on the NES games in Animal Crossing.
2145000	2150000	He's saying, I'd hate to have to open Animal Crossing and then go somewhere in the game to play an NES game.
2150000	2153000	Instead of going into the NES online app on my Switch to play them.
2153000	2157000	It's kind of like how I don't want to use VR to play an 80's arcade game in VR.
2157000	2159000	A screen inside a screen.
2159000	2162000	It's like we now have a better delivery mechanism for NES and SNES games.
2162000	2164000	We don't need Animal Crossing for it anymore.
2164000	2168000	Well here's the thing. I'm not saying that would be the only way to play the games.
2168000	2172000	Or like those little cartridges sitting in your house.
2172000	2174000	Little NES systems or cute little decorations.
2174000	2175000	And took up space.
2175000	2179000	Sure and it might be fun to have your little arcade and you could actually play the game.
2179000	2182000	Just as a cute little thing.
2182000	2184000	They lived in my basement.
2184000	2190000	But I'm saying that the only way to get those machines for your house is to go out, get a machine, bring it back to your village type of thing.
2190000	2192000	And you have to use the internet to do that.
2192000	2197000	So it's just a cute little decorative thing.
2197000	2199000	If you don't like it, don't do it. Sheesh.
2199000	2202000	It would be cool though if you could build an arcade.
2202000	2204000	Yeah, it would be fun.
2204000	2209000	Do a few Sims-ish kind of things where you can build commercial properties.
2209000	2211000	And we said that for when they did Animal Crossing on the Wii.
2211000	2213000	And break the Nook monopoly.
2213000	2219000	Is that it would have been cool if they're not going to do these NES games anymore because they realized they could sell them for $5 a pop.
2219000	2221000	Or do what they're doing now, the Nesflix thing.
2221000	2228000	It would have been cool if they just did some original little Animal Crossing crappy little Atari reimaginings.
2228000	2232000	Or Game & Watch reimaginings with Animal Crossing characters and have those be the things in your house.
2232000	2235000	But instead they made Nintendo Land.
2236000	2240000	Bobby says it's a deserted island. There are no commercial properties.
2240000	2243000	It's a deserted island with other people on it.
2243000	2246000	Yeah, but as you can see, you can...
2246000	2249000	What's a good word? Domesticate the island.
2249000	2251000	And people have homes.
2251000	2253000	You can gentrify the island very easily.
2253000	2254000	Yes, gentrify.
2254000	2256000	Is it really deserted if there's other people on it?
2256000	2259000	You know what? Eventually you build a nuclear power plant in SimCity.
2259000	2265000	Eventually, you know, drill baby drill.
2265000	2270000	Sorry, can't have video games on a deserted island, but we can talk to animals.
2270000	2272000	Although I am...
2272000	2274000	That's where I draw the line in reality here.
2274000	2281000	For Sims 4, I'm saying right now that I am working on a commercial property in my game that is a fitness gym and wine bar.
2281000	2283000	I would go there.
2283000	2286000	And Bobby does want to remind us, I'm getting it day one.
2286000	2287000	Yes, of course.
2287000	2291000	As the CEO 100 Matt says, what Rob really wants is Game Room the game.
2291000	2292000	Fuck yes, I do.
2292000	2296000	Why didn't Microsoft just completely...
2296000	2300000	Instead of like kind of half-assing it with Viva Pinata...
2300000	2302000	I know some of you love Viva Pinata, sorry.
2302000	2307000	Why didn't they just fully fucking rip off Animal Crossing with Viva Pinata characters and make it Game Room?
2307000	2309000	Like, come on.
2309000	2311000	Alright, anyway.
2311000	2312000	Sorry, Nintendo Direct.
2312000	2313000	That's it.
2313000	2314000	Oh, okay.
2315000	2317000	Did you mention the Xenoblade Chronicles thing?
2317000	2318000	Yes.
2318000	2319000	Okay, I must have spaced out.
2319000	2321000	Yeah, the Xenoblade Chronicles.
2321000	2322000	So it was...
2322000	2323000	Yeah, no, it's fine.
2323000	2324000	Yeah, I mentioned it.
2324000	2327000	So they're doing the HD reimagining of Xenoblade Chronicles.
2327000	2329000	I'm really excited for that.
2329000	2332000	Because that game has had an interesting history.
2332000	2334000	It's a very good RPG.
2334000	2341000	I think when I played it on the Wii finally, I think I said it was the best PlayStation 2 RPG I played on the Nintendo Wii.
2342000	2344000	That's kind of how I feel about Xenoblade Chronicles.
2344000	2346000	But here's the thing.
2346000	2349000	That game was really hard to play previously.
2349000	2351000	Because remember, it was that whole Operation Rainfall.
2351000	2353000	They didn't release it here for the longest time.
2353000	2354000	They had it in the UK.
2354000	2355000	They had it in Japan.
2355000	2356000	I'm gonna fess up.
2356000	2359000	I pirated it because they didn't want me to buy it.
2359000	2360000	They didn't release the game yet.
2360000	2363000	Then finally, they finally decided,
2363000	2368000	Oh, okay, fine, we'll release Xenoblade Chronicles in the US as a GameStop exclusive.
2369000	2371000	Or you can buy it in the Nintendo online store.
2371000	2374000	It's a remaster GameStop exclusive as well.
2374000	2376000	No, no, thank heavens it's not.
2376000	2378000	And then they released it one more time.
2378000	2381000	But only for the new 3DS.
2381000	2383000	Not the old 3DS that many people already have.
2383000	2384000	But only for the new 3DS.
2384000	2386000	So I'm not saying you couldn't play that game.
2386000	2390000	But I just feel like that game was always somehow limited to the base.
2390000	2393000	But now to see that they're gonna do an HD remaster,
2393000	2395000	it will probably be on the digital shop.
2395000	2397000	It will be very easy to get a hold of.
2397000	2402000	We are not gonna have to worry about how the audience for the game is going to be limited in one way or the other.
2402000	2404000	So I feel like more people will finally get to experience it.
2404000	2406000	I'm sorry, I know you've been dying to comment.
2406000	2408000	This is actually going back to Animal Crossing.
2408000	2409000	I just had a brainwave.
2409000	2413000	What if the universe of Animal Crossing is kind of like the world of Hot to Full Boyfriend,
2413000	2416000	where humans are dying off,
2416000	2419000	and animals have taken over everything,
2419000	2425000	and they've grown anthropomorphic qualities?
2425000	2430000	What if the Mayans were right, and the world actually ended in 2012,
2430000	2433000	and our reality is the fake reality,
2433000	2436000	and Animal Crossing is the real reality?
2436000	2439000	Can you prove that I'm wrong?
2439000	2443000	The burden of proof should be on proving that you're right.
2443000	2446000	Not proving that you're wrong.
2446000	2448000	Look who got elected president.
2448000	2452000	I rest my case.
2452000	2453000	That's not in my reality.
2453000	2456000	He could have had an animal controlling him from the top of his head.
2456000	2458000	I rest my case.
2458000	2461000	Anyway, moving on.
2461000	2463000	I couldn't resist. I'm sorry.
2463000	2468000	Internet conspiracy theories was like a thing that came up at Dragon Con.
2468000	2470000	I am so proud.
2470000	2473000	Can I just state how proud I am of Bobby Black Wolf?
2473000	2476000	When an Avril Lavigne song came on at the food court, he said,
2476000	2478000	Hey Rob, it's Melissa.
2478000	2480000	He just said that in chat.
2480000	2486000	What if Avril Lavigne died in 2003 and was replaced by a body double named Melissa?
2486000	2488000	Anyway.
2488000	2490000	All right, I'm sorry. Where were we?
2490000	2492000	Xenoblade Chronicles. Oh, yes. Great game.
2492000	2495000	Why do you have to be so complicated?
2495000	2499000	Bobby, with another comment that I think is worth addressing, saying,
2499000	2504000	I know some people are waiting for Xenoblade Chronicles X to come to Switch
2504000	2507000	so they can finally get rid of their Wii U.
2507000	2510000	I would assume if this version does really well
2510000	2513000	and sells oodles and oodles of copies
2513000	2516000	that they'll look at doing a Xenoblade Chronicles X. Why not?
2516000	2519000	Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is already on the Switch.
2519000	2522000	So, yeah, why not Xenoblade Chronicles X? That'd be fun.
2522000	2524000	All right.
2524000	2526000	So that's it for the Nintendo Direct then. Let's move on.
2526000	2530000	Let's talk about our gaming weeks now that we're almost an hour into the show.
2530000	2534000	How is your gaming week? The types of video games that we have been playing this week.
2534000	2536000	Meaning if you want to go back three weeks, you can...
2536000	2538000	This weeks?
2538000	2540000	Yeah. How is your gaming weeks, DarkSakura? Why don't you start us off?
2540000	2542000	Sims.
2542000	2544000	You don't have to name every single thing.
2544000	2546000	My usual phone stuff in Sims 4
2546000	2549000	because I now have finally made a vampire,
2549000	2551000	which is really distracting when you're trying to design your vampire
2551000	2555000	and they stop and hiss when you're trying to change their eye color.
2555000	2559000	So I'm making this weird vampire family
2559000	2562000	where there's this old lady who doesn't give a shit.
2562000	2565000	She's just a vampire and she's living her best vampire life.
2565000	2567000	And there's one who's trying to be the extra vampire
2567000	2569000	and trying to bite everybody.
2569000	2572000	And then there's the young vampire who's kind of in denial.
2572000	2574000	And then I'm going to have a ghost live in their house too.
2576000	2578000	Only 53 more days until Halloween?
2578000	2580000	Something like that?
2580000	2582000	It's Halloween season now.
2582000	2584000	I've already decorated it at work.
2584000	2586000	Anything can happen on Halloween.
2586000	2588000	Anything.
2588000	2590000	Stop it.
2590000	2592000	I'm sorry. I can't help it.
2592000	2594000	All right. That's it. Sims, Sims, more Sims.
2594000	2596000	And baking.
2596000	2598000	Hey, I was going to ask you during the agenda items
2598000	2600000	because I didn't want to leave you out of the discussion.
2600000	2602000	We haven't really talked about this,
2602000	2604000	but I know you're prepping streaming stuff.
2604000	2606000	Yep.
2606000	2608000	Have you set a date yet?
2608000	2610000	Nope.
2610000	2616000	Well, because I just ordered a shield for the pop cover for the mic.
2616000	2618000	Oh, okay.
2618000	2620000	That I guess is on indefinite loan now.
2620000	2622000	Yeah, no, because I got a Yeti.
2622000	2626000	I think that blue mic was donated to me anyway.
2626000	2629000	So I'm pretty sure that was the one that Code Man gave to me.
2629000	2633000	So I'm pretty sure he will be completely okay with a pay it forward situation.
2633000	2635000	All right.
2635000	2638000	You know, the thing I'm missing is a webcam right now.
2638000	2640000	And I'm probably not going to do cam stuff anyway.
2640000	2642000	Maybe just like as a switchover.
2644000	2649000	But, um, and then we are, I still have the El Gato capture
2649000	2651000	that you loaned us a need to go.
2651000	2653000	Oh, yeah, I have a new one now.
2653000	2660000	Okay, so we're planning on trying to hook up some of the HD friendly stuff,
2660000	2663000	but I'm actually going to start off with just sim stuff because it's easy
2663000	2666000	and I can, you know, take feedback while I build houses.
2666000	2669000	Yeah, just try to get the habit, make the habit of actually doing streaming.
2669000	2671000	That's the hardest part.
2671000	2673000	And I say that for myself too.
2673000	2677000	But I found the equipment I actually want to get is there's James from The Sim Supply
2677000	2680000	who listed all of the stuff on his website.
2680000	2684000	And I really like the way he sounds on this mic.
2684000	2686000	I really like the sound of it.
2686000	2688000	And I was kind of looking into the same equipment.
2688000	2690000	Although I'm not going to, you know, if I get a camera set up,
2690000	2694000	I'm not going to like pay the bucks for like a, you know,
2694000	2698000	I'm just going to deal with like a Canon or Sony or something.
2698000	2701000	I want to address this comment from our chat because she hold 10 and chat says,
2701000	2704000	You guys should think about using Mixer. It is fresh and new.
2704000	2708000	You know, I did give Mixer a serious consideration
2708000	2711000	when we were looking at moving VOG Network to, you know, like,
2711000	2713000	are we going to go to Twitch, Mixer, YouTube?
2713000	2716000	You know, nothing was really off limits completely.
2716000	2719000	I think ultimately we chose to go with Twitch just because
2719000	2723000	at the time we made the decision, it's the larger community.
2723000	2727000	The monetization elements and how you can kind of work with that,
2727000	2731000	it seemed a lot easier to kind of get through that barrier of entry
2731000	2734000	where I'm not sure we would have met Mixer's barrier of entry.
2734000	2737000	So those were like, I don't want to sound anti-Mixer or anything by any means
2737000	2738000	because I'm really not.
2738000	2741000	Like, I'm really excited that there are like competing platforms
2741000	2743000	because I think that's going to be great for everybody.
2743000	2746000	And I actually see the Ninja, even though I don't watch him,
2746000	2748000	Ninja moving to Mixer, I actually see that as a good thing.
2748000	2751000	Like that's really healthy for what these two sites are going through
2751000	2755000	with their growing pains and other people that want to enter this, you know, thing as well.
2755000	2759000	So I watch Mixer, but as of right now, especially because of the fact that,
2759000	2762000	you know, we have to think not just for ourselves,
2762000	2766000	but the other folks that stream on Twitch that make up
2766000	2772000	the Voice of Geeks network, I do see us staying on Twitch for an extended period of time.
2772000	2775000	But if I have friends that are streaming on Mixer, I'd absolutely support them.
2775000	2780000	It's a fun platform and I like how they do the sparks, you know, it does different stuff.
2780000	2786000	I'm going to monetize for one reason and it's two words, student loans.
2786000	2787000	Seriously.
2787000	2788000	Right.
2788000	2789000	Debt consolidation.
2789000	2790000	All right, anyway.
2790000	2791000	Yeah.
2791000	2792000	Let's see, moving on.
2792000	2794000	Let's talk about more gaming weeks.
2794000	2795000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
2795000	2799000	I didn't play a whole time because I've been busy working on my game.
2799000	2805000	So I did end up playing for the first time yesterday Beat Saber.
2805000	2807000	So that was fun.
2807000	2809000	I got to play that.
2809000	2810000	How'd you like it?
2810000	2811000	It was fun.
2811000	2817000	I did pretty well for my first time because they had like a competition they were doing on hard for one thing.
2817000	2819000	I was like, I can probably do that.
2819000	2821000	You know, I can play rhythm games.
2821000	2822000	God, I should have gone.
2822000	2824000	Because I've actually played Beat Saber.
2824000	2826000	Bobby saw me play a hard song in the vogs.
2826000	2827000	Yeah.
2827000	2828000	And I did okay on it.
2828000	2834000	Like for the first, like having not played the game before, the only problem I had was hitting stuff the wrong way sometimes.
2834000	2839000	But I mean, considering it's the first song I played and the first time I played the game.
2839000	2840000	I don't know.
2840000	2841000	I did okay.
2841000	2842000	I got like a D.
2842000	2843000	Meh, whatever.
2843000	2844000	But it was fun.
2844000	2845000	I had a lot of fun with it.
2845000	2847000	My kids want me to get it now because they got to play it as well.
2847000	2848000	So I was like, okay, fine.
2848000	2850000	I got to buy this now.
2850000	2852000	So yeah, I played that.
2852000	2855000	And I mean, a lot of other stuff I'll get into later.
2855000	2856000	A lot of indie games.
2856000	2858000	But it was mainly just that.
2858000	2860000	And a little bit of Pokemon Go.
2860000	2862000	I've been playing some of that.
2862000	2865000	And yeah, not much in the console stuff.
2865000	2867000	This week though, I probably will.
2867000	2870000	Because there's some bigger games coming out that I've been looking forward to.
2870000	2872000	That's it.
2872000	2873000	I've been playing a lot.
2873000	2875000	I can't fit everything in.
2875000	2879000	Just because while I was flying on the plane, I played Mario Maker 2.
2879000	2881000	I played some of the NES Classic Library.
2881000	2884000	I played Diablo 3 for a little bit on Switch.
2884000	2888000	But finally, the first time I played the Necromancer, I played at the Dragon Con arcade.
2888000	2890000	I played some Neon FM.
2890000	2896000	I had a friend of mine play Dance Dance Revolution for the very first time, mind you, at Dragon Con.
2896000	2897000	So that was fun.
2897000	2898000	So I played some DDR out of that.
2898000	2902000	Oh, and I played DDR at a random arcade, Barcade, in North Carolina as well.
2902000	2904000	Because there's a video on my Instagram or something of it.
2904000	2906000	And it was fun.
2906000	2907000	Because I was like, yeah, I'm 41.
2907000	2909000	Dom Darian.
2909000	2910000	So it was fun.
2910000	2916000	And then various things at Dragon Con, like I mentioned Beat Saber.
2916000	2919000	And I think I saw Bobby playing some Attica and stuff.
2919000	2921000	And then I came home and I was playing things too.
2921000	2923000	I was still playing quite a bit of Final Fantasy XIV.
2923000	2926000	A little bit of No Man's Sky as well.
2926000	2929000	I know I was doing some streaming earlier this week.
2929000	2932000	The main thing I think I want to talk about as far as games going and what I've been playing.
2932000	2937000	I started playing World of Warcraft Classic, which came out...
2937000	2938000	I'm sorry.
2938000	2942000	It was like the Monday or Tuesday that I left, it came out.
2942000	2946000	So it was when I was out visiting Extifer in North Carolina, that game came out.
2946000	2954000	Which, by the way, I don't know if we have any listeners or folks out there that were impacted by Hurricane Dorian in North or South Carolina.
2954000	2959000	But it was kind of eerie, the fact that I was out in Wilmington, North Carolina, in Cape Fear.
2959000	2962000	I did an Ingress banner out in Cape Fear.
2962000	2966000	It's an actual banner on my Ingress profile that says, Bye, Felicia.
2966000	2970000	And it's actually in Wilmington, so that's kind of fun.
2970000	2973000	So it was neat to be out there.
2973000	2976000	We went to the beach side, so there's the cape side and the beach side.
2976000	2978000	We went to the beach side, I was out of the pier.
2978000	2983000	So it blows my mind to think that a week later, then this hurricane is coming.
2983000	2987000	So again, just my thoughts to anybody that was impacted.
2987000	2989000	Especially, of course, the Bahamas.
2989000	2992000	We know we're impacted very, very seriously.
2992000	2999000	Just thinking of anybody we know that may have been impacted by all that and hope all our folks are doing A-OK.
2999000	3003000	Anyway, sorry, that just kind of sprung to mind when I was thinking about my trip to North Carolina.
3003000	3007000	So I played World of Warcraft Classic, finally, when I got back.
3007000	3013000	So luckily, the queues and all that stuff weren't an issue for me, because a lot of that died down.
3013000	3016000	And I think they released some expansion servers.
3016000	3020000	So my buddy Slagkick over at Game Buoy was like,
3020000	3024000	you should play on old Blanchy, like Blanch from the Golden Girls.
3024000	3025000	So we're on old Blanchy.
3025000	3027000	So I was like, all right, I'll play on old Blanchy.
3027000	3029000	And there's no queue over there, so it's fine.
3029000	3031000	So I rolled a Dwarf Priest.
3031000	3034000	I don't want to hear the Alliance versus Horde thing.
3034000	3037000	It's where they were on Alliance, so I win Alliance as well.
3037000	3043000	I will do a Horde someday, but I've played both sides in the main game thoroughly throughout the years.
3043000	3046000	I consider myself bi-factional.
3046000	3050000	But I've been leveling a Dwarf Priest, and I think she's now up to level 11.
3050000	3053000	I streamed the first seven levels or so.
3053000	3058000	But anyway, to kind of make a long story short, and even Dark Soccer made a comment like, I'm sorry,
3058000	3063000	and how when WoW Classic was first announced, I think there were some of us that were like,
3063000	3069000	why are people begging for this game that had no quality of life things in it whatsoever?
3069000	3071000	And are people really going to appreciate it and so forth?
3071000	3076000	And I've got to say, now that I've spent a couple hours with WoW Classic, I'm going to put it this way.
3076000	3079000	I like it more than I thought I would. I do.
3079000	3086000	There's something about the slow burn and the fact that you really do have to earn those levels
3086000	3095000	and that maybe the difficulty is a little bit harder because you get into situations where you're pulling one mob
3095000	3098000	and if you're not careful, another one's going to add and that's it, you're going to die.
3098000	3101000	And some of that they made easier in the later games.
3101000	3105000	So I'm not saying easy equals bad, I'm not saying that at all,
3105000	3109000	but I think I am starting to understand a little bit more maybe the challenge side of it
3109000	3114000	and for the gaming audience that does like to play games on challenging and very hard,
3114000	3122000	perhaps that WoW Classic has some of that for them and that's what they were missing maybe a little bit
3122000	3125000	when WoW started to get all the quality of life upgrades to it.
3125000	3130000	Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not going to be leaving Final Fantasy XIV for this
3130000	3137000	and if regular Warcraft releases a new expansion, I'd kind of rather take a look at that for a little bit and so forth.
3137000	3144000	But is WoW Classic like the, I don't know, is WoW Classic the like flash in the pan I thought it would be?
3144000	3150000	Not necessarily. I do think they're going to run into a problem where all these people bombarded it early on
3150000	3157000	and I think that well will dry up after a couple months when regular WoW releases a new expansion
3157000	3163000	or after BlizzCon happens and something kind of draws all the Blizzard fans back to another product.
3163000	3168000	I hope Blizzard has a strategy for how they're going to consolidate old servers
3168000	3172000	because I just feel like that's something that's going to happen with WoW Classic, but I don't know.
3172000	3181000	Also, I would like to see WoW Classic progress like Burning Crusade and like Wrath of the Lich King
3181000	3184000	because I really think Wrath of the Lich King was like peak World of Warcraft
3184000	3190000	and I'd like to see it maybe progress to that point and then maybe be frozen in time there.
3190000	3195000	But not everybody would agree with me. Some folks think it might be a little too easy mode at that point as well.
3195000	3200000	I don't know, but I think it would be fun if I could take this character maybe a little bit further
3200000	3203000	and still experience some of that WoW expansion stuff a little later on.
3203000	3207000	But WoW Classic, I liked it more than I thought I would
3207000	3212000	and I think I understand a little more why people were into it, but I'm not sure.
3212000	3219000	It's neat that it's there. It's neat. That's it. And that's kind of like where it ends.
3219000	3225000	I think it's not the MMO I'm going to play solely by any means. That's for sure.
3226000	3234000	Anyway, looking at comments from chat, Bobby Blackwolf says, Rob tried the Valve Index.
3234000	3240000	I did. I played Beat Saber on that device and that was the one where the little ear pieces kind of float
3240000	3243000	and the sound on that was really good.
3243000	3248000	Playing Beat Saber on that felt a lot better than it does playing it on PlayStation 4.
3248000	3252000	Maybe that's what I played it on. I don't remember. It was a blue headset. I don't remember what that is.
3252000	3253000	Did it have little floating earbuds?
3253000	3258000	It did have the earbuds that kind of slide or whatever, like the ear headphones almost.
3258000	3263000	Sounds like it, but Bobby is better at telling all those things apart than I am.
3263000	3267000	No, the one I played on was really nice. The controls were kind of neat too.
3267000	3276000	It wasn't a Vive of some sort, so I don't know if it was the Index or if it was the HTC Vive or something like that.
3276000	3279000	I don't know, but it was nice.
3280000	3283000	And Bobby says the HTC Vive Pro is blue.
3283000	3286000	So it's probably the Vive Pro that I played on then.
3286000	3289000	Alright, but that was my gaming week. That's enough to talk about.
3289000	3294000	I'll mention one other thing. Harry Potter, Wizards Unite, I'm still playing a little bit of that.
3294000	3300000	And the reason why I brought it up is because they had the whole Day of the Dragons thing happen on Saturday.
3300000	3306000	And as much as I understand there's some people that are kind of over that game already because the tracing kind of gets repetitive,
3306000	3312000	I will say the Day of the Dragons event they did was probably better than any Community Day event that they've done.
3312000	3320000	Because those dragons gave big XP and you really felt, and then by collecting them you were able to get a lot of scrolls.
3320000	3324000	So I felt a lot of progression during that event.
3324000	3328000	Whereas the last couple of Community Day events I thought were kind of, like they weren't that great.
3328000	3332000	So I will say, you know, game companies should get props and they do things well.
3332000	3337000	So I thought that Dragon Day event was actually one of the better Harry Potter events.
3337000	3339000	So I'm glad I got to spend a little time doing that.
3339000	3343000	It just worked out that way. My car was being worked on yesterday.
3343000	3347000	So Alan came to get me and we went out to the Palladio out in Folsom.
3347000	3350000	And we were, because that's a good place for Pokemon Go and all that stuff too.
3350000	3354000	So we were playing the Harry Potter game out there and able to do some trapping.
3354000	3355000	So it was good.
3356000	3360000	Before we get into the news tonight, I'll mention something a little bit on a personal note.
3360000	3364000	Because I wasn't able to talk about this the last time we did a show.
3364000	3369000	Because we taped that show on a Thursday night to air that Sunday, right?
3369000	3373000	Which again, thanks to those of you guys that showed up or listened to the podcast or what have you to 790.
3373000	3375000	Which we'd actually done a little bit in advance.
3375000	3381000	So I have not been able to talk about that the day after we taped that show.
3381000	3386000	I actually gave my two weeks notice to my prior job because I am starting a new job on Monday.
3386000	3388000	So that's my little kind of like personal thing.
3388000	3390000	So that's also why I want to go shopping.
3390000	3392000	Because it's fun to start a new job and new clothes.
3392000	3394000	So that was a big part of it.
3394000	3397000	So I don't work in the gaming industry.
3397000	3399000	I don't do anything related to gaming stuff.
3399000	3401000	And I kind of like to keep my personal stuff private.
3401000	3405000	Just especially how volatile things on social media can be and things like that.
3405000	3410000	I think I've said on the show before, I'm in the field of corporate training.
3410000	3412000	Like I teach people how to do their jobs and stuff like that.
3412000	3415000	So I talk all day long as well as on Sunday nights.
3415000	3419000	But obviously I try to keep my professional life, my personal life very separate.
3419000	3425000	And I've been working in the health insurance industry for the past 18 years.
3425000	3429000	So I'm not going to be working exactly that industry anymore.
3429000	3431000	It's similar but not the same.
3431000	3433000	That's all I'm going to say about that.
3433000	3434000	So it's kind of a big change for me.
3434000	3435000	So I'm a little bit like eek.
3435000	3437000	But really excited about it.
3437000	3439000	I post about it on Twitter and stuff.
3439000	3441000	So thanks for all the kind words.
3441000	3444000	But I wanted to say something about it here because it's going to be a big change.
3444000	3445000	So there you go.
3445000	3448000	Anyhow, let's move on.
3448000	3455000	Let's get into some gaming news now that we're this far into the show here.
3455000	3458000	Let's actually talk about some things that have gone on this week in the gaming world.
3458000	3460000	Besides just the Nintendo Direct.
3460000	3463000	This is something we don't quite know all about yet.
3463000	3466000	And it wasn't part of the Nintendo Direct.
3466000	3468000	It was a separate type of teaser.
3468000	3473000	So they had a teaser that it was for this new experience for Nintendo Switch.
3473000	3480000	And it definitely looks like a sort of fitness style app or fitness thing that they're going to be offering for the Nintendo Switch.
3480000	3482000	Kind of like a Wii Fit type of thing.
3482000	3488000	So what it includes is they basically have a strap for one of the joy cons that goes around your leg.
3489000	3496000	And then they have this kind of resistance band circle thing that you kind of squeeze in.
3496000	3498000	And I've actually seen something like that before.
3498000	3500000	Like some sort of fitness stuff.
3500000	3505000	It's basically for resistance training or whatever that you put the other joy con in.
3505000	3507000	And using that you do different...
3507000	3510000	I think it guides you through different exercises and stuff like that.
3510000	3512000	Or different games.
3512000	3517000	So right now it's a teaser because we're going to get the full announcement on Thursday.
3517000	3519000	And figure out what's going on with it.
3519000	3521000	But it looks interesting.
3521000	3524000	More crap I get to have in my house for the Switch.
3526000	3529000	Is Thursday the same day Apple's doing their phone announcement?
3529000	3531000	Or is that Tuesday?
3531000	3533000	It's Tuesday.
3533000	3537000	Tuesday is the press thing.
3537000	3540000	You know how sometimes Apple does their thing the same day as E3?
3540000	3543000	And it's kind of like, it's too much tech news today.
3543000	3546000	I'm glad they're on separate days next week. Sorry.
3546000	3548000	And then we have Tokyo Game Show later this week too.
3548000	3550000	Never mind.
3550000	3552000	That's the same day as the fitness stuff.
3552000	3554000	Oh, so this is what Nintendo's doing instead.
3554000	3556000	Because we know Nintendo doesn't do Tokyo Game Show.
3556000	3558000	So maybe this is their way.
3558000	3560000	Okay, okay, interesting.
3560000	3564000	This is the way to sell the Switch units to your mom.
3564000	3566000	For the moms out there.
3566000	3568000	I mean...
3568000	3570000	I say that.
3570000	3573000	If we want to go stereotypes, the soccer mom, sure.
3573000	3575000	I only say that because...
3575000	3577000	I mean, that's what's pictured.
3577000	3579000	Sure, look what's highlighted in the commercial.
3579000	3581000	Granted, they also had, you know...
3581000	3585000	Stereotypical dads as well doing yoga.
3585000	3588000	It's funny because uncoordinated dads trying to do yoga.
3588000	3590000	Hahaha.
3590000	3592000	Hilarious.
3592000	3594000	I guess we'll find out more about it.
3594000	3599000	But yeah, it looks like they're going to try to do something similar to Wii Fit.
3599000	3601000	Thank God I don't have to buy a balance board.
3601000	3603000	Maybe it'll support the balance board.
3604000	3606000	God knows it's just taking up space in my garage.
3606000	3609000	Why do we think they walked away from Wii Fit?
3609000	3611000	Assuming this is a fitness thing.
3611000	3613000	I mean, it has to be, right?
3613000	3615000	It looks like a fitness thing.
3615000	3617000	Why are they shifting away from Wii Fit?
3617000	3619000	Why not do a new version of Wii Fit?
3619000	3623000	Because I think Wii Fit was just basically a weight sensor.
3623000	3628000	So there wasn't necessarily much you could do with it.
3628000	3630000	Aside from just kind of standing on it.
3630000	3633000	It did detect your balance a little bit.
3633000	3636000	But I think this, there's more exercises that you could do.
3636000	3640000	With the sensor positioning, with the two different joy cons.
3640000	3644000	I think there's more that they can capture as far as what you're doing.
3644000	3646000	I don't know.
3646000	3648000	It's also smaller.
3648000	3652000	Because I know the Wii Fit balance board was just this monstrous thing that would take up a ton of space.
3652000	3654000	I think that also might be it.
3654000	3658000	I think they might be tapping into one of the key features of the Switch.
3658000	3660000	Which is that it's portable.
3660000	3667000	And so this resistance thing kind of looks like it might unclamp or whatever it holds it together.
3667000	3669000	And maybe ends up being very portable.
3669000	3672000	And obviously that thing that goes around the leg is going to be very portable as well.
3672000	3676000	So they've come up with some type of solution that is portable as well as the Switch.
3676000	3678000	And I think that's very important, certainly.
3678000	3682000	I mean, as much as I'm like, oh it would be nice if they would reuse some old technology.
3682000	3685000	I can see where the Wii balance board is hard to go into.
3685000	3690000	Although when I did see them squeezing the resistance band thing like rapidly or whatever.
3690000	3693000	It just reminded me of the shake weight a little bit.
3695000	3697000	We'll have to see what it is.
3697000	3702000	Nifty805 in chat says the Switch fitness thing might actually get me in shape for Pride season or not.
3702000	3704000	Well you've got a good ten months to go.
3704000	3706000	How about get in shape for yourself?
3706000	3708000	Yeah, do something for yourself.
3708000	3710000	Do for you.
3710000	3712000	Screw those judgy hoes at Pride.
3713000	3717000	Since it is like a resistance band, they had something that looked like you were firing bow and arrow.
3717000	3722000	So you were holding one end of it with your one hand and the other end you're kind of pulling back.
3722000	3724000	And there's a little bit of resistance that way.
3724000	3731000	So there might be some interesting game experiences here that aren't just like Woohoo Island mini games.
3731000	3735000	And you remember Woohoo Island was the Wii Fit and Wii Sports and all that.
3735000	3737000	All that universe was all there.
3737000	3740000	Yeah, so it looks like they have yoga stuff.
3740000	3745000	They've got some other movement things that they're doing, stretching.
3745000	3747000	Do you think the fact that they...
3747000	3752000	Okay, look at the way this trailer is put together where they're like Madrid, Rome, Dallas.
3752000	3754000	And they're highlighting all these cities.
3754000	3761000	Do you think that maybe this fitness around the world is a theme to what it is?
3761000	3762000	Maybe.
3762000	3764000	It's going to be like something around the world?
3764000	3767000	Nintendo Fit world or something?
3767000	3772000	I feel like there's a reason why they've built this the way that they did.
3772000	3774000	I don't know. Maybe I'm tinfoil-hatting a little bit.
3774000	3782000	But I feel like something around like the whole world does this together is some sort of key thing about what the product is.
3782000	3783000	Maybe.
3783000	3784000	Anyway.
3784000	3789000	It says we'll find out more September 12th in the course.
3789000	3792000	It is tied around Tokyo Game Show.
3792000	3796000	So by this time next week when we're on the show we'll know a little more about what this specifically is.
3796000	3798000	So we'll talk more about it then.
3798000	3805000	Let's say Bobby Blackwolf in chat says my wife immediately said now we got to buy another doc so we can put it in our workout room,
3805000	3810000	which is where our Wii is hooked up for Wii Fit and EA Active, which still get played.
3810000	3816000	SG100Matt says my girlfriend hasn't seen this device yet, but I'm sure when she does she'll get it as well.
3816000	3817000	Questbuster says...
3817000	3818000	Oh, I like this comment a lot.
3818000	3825000	Questbuster says it looks like it could be something useful for hospitals too, like physical rehab.
3825000	3831000	And remember how we used to have all those stories about, you know, the senior citizens home does Wii Fit bowling...
3831000	3834000	or not Wii Fit, but Nintendo Wii bowling tournaments.
3834000	3838000	And I'm sure when Wii Fit was out that kind of got coverage in some of those as well.
3838000	3840000	Or what they'll say is like, you know what?
3840000	3845000	The average adult working at a very sedentary job, guess what?
3845000	3848000	You can bring your Nintendo Switch with you and you can do a workout on your break.
3848000	3853000	Just a really quick office workout to kind of stretch out and do all that little like...
3853000	3854000	I can see them...
3854000	3856000	Work out wherever you go. That's it.
3856000	3860000	It's because of all these... It's workout wherever you go.
3860000	3862000	That's going to be the theme.
3862000	3863000	Yes.
3863000	3865000	Mark, we're going to play that clip back.
3865000	3867000	Clip it and play it back in a week.
3867000	3868000	That's going to be what it is.
3868000	3869000	It's good.
3869000	3871000	And that's a workout wherever you go.
3871000	3874000	No matter wherever in the world you are, you've got this.
3874000	3876000	You can workout.
3876000	3877000	You've got a gym with you.
3877000	3879000	That's what it's going to be.
3879000	3880000	A wonderful...
3880000	3882000	W-E-R-K workout.
3882000	3885000	I wonder if they'll tie it in with a phone app or something like that.
3885000	3889000	Honestly, Dark Soccer, wouldn't that be the better marketing campaign?
3889000	3892000	Is for Michelle Visage to pop out of the corner and go,
3892000	3894000	You better work.
3896000	3897000	I'd be all about that.
3897000	3899000	I know, but then she would go back and say,
3899000	3902000	Stop relying on that body-ody-ody.
3903000	3905000	Alright, let's see.
3905000	3906000	Kaijuto in chat says,
3906000	3909000	The reason they showed Greece is because it's going to be an Olympic event.
3909000	3911000	Well, aren't the next Olympics in Paris?
3911000	3913000	Well, sorry, Tokyo.
3913000	3914000	No, Tokyo is 2020.
3914000	3915000	My bad.
3915000	3916000	Tokyo is 2020.
3916000	3917000	Paris is 2024.
3917000	3918000	So...
3918000	3921000	And then did LA finally get a Games?
3921000	3922000	I feel like that's a thing.
3922000	3924000	Like, 2028, LA finally has one.
3924000	3925000	I don't...
3925000	3926000	Maybe.
3926000	3927000	I say finally.
3927000	3928000	They were there in like 1984.
3928000	3930000	But how long ago was that, right?
3930000	3931000	It's been a little while.
3931000	3932000	So, anyway.
3932000	3933000	Alright, moving on.
3933000	3935000	Let's get into another story.
3935000	3938000	So, we already kind of touched on that thing I was going to talk about
3938000	3941000	with the NES and SNES updates.
3941000	3942000	Sorry.
3942000	3943000	No, that's fine.
3943000	3944000	We talked about it.
3944000	3946000	So, we can change up the order when we want, Loki.
3946000	3947000	It's okay.
3947000	3948000	Alright.
3948000	3949000	So, we'll move on to DarkSakura,
3949000	3951000	who has something about a game I was talking about.
3951000	3953000	I was buying a webcam, sorry.
3953000	3955000	Just now you bought a webcam?
3955000	3956000	No.
3956000	3958000	Well, I'm actually going to get one on Wish.
3958000	3959000	Okay.
3959000	3962000	Because I've gotten tripods and things on Wish.
3962000	3963000	I've bought wigs.
3963000	3965000	I bought a wig stand.
3965000	3967000	Like, I'll see what a $5 webcam is going to do.
3967000	3969000	What a $5 webcam is going to do is $5.
3969000	3970000	That's, what, three tacos?
3970000	3971000	Mm-hmm.
3971000	3972000	Depending.
3972000	3973000	Maybe two if you go to a good place.
3973000	3975000	They'll just get a PlayStation Eye.
3975000	3977000	If you go to the taco place Alan and I went to for brunch,
3977000	3981000	the Paladio would be a taco and a half, if that.
3981000	3985000	Well, actually, we do still have our...
3985000	3989000	What was the Xbox one?
3989000	3991000	The vision camera or the Kinect?
3991000	3992000	The Kinect.
3992000	3994000	We still have a Kinect somewhere in a box.
3994000	3996000	I will say this really quickly before you get to the story.
3996000	3998000	Speaking of upgrades and things we want to do.
3998000	4001000	You and I getting mic stands for these things to cut out.
4001000	4005000	Because I did not realize how bad the shaky shake noise is
4005000	4007000	when we pick up and put down these things.
4007000	4008000	Mm-hmm.
4008000	4010000	It's really bad because these things are sensitive
4010000	4011000	and I've tried doing some rebalancing.
4011000	4012000	It's not working.
4012000	4013000	But if you and I had stands,
4013000	4015000	I think it would get rid of a lot of that.
4015000	4016000	Shopping trip on Thursday?
4016000	4018000	No, because I had the new job.
4018000	4019000	That's right.
4019000	4021000	Shopping trick next week.
4021000	4024000	I'm going to set a realistic goal.
4024000	4028000	Before episode 800, we're going to make some big changes to OLR.
4028000	4030000	Because I've got other stuff on my brain too
4030000	4031000	that I didn't talk to you guys about.
4031000	4033000	But not bad or anything.
4033000	4034000	Change is good.
4034000	4036000	We're just going to zhuzh it up.
4036000	4039000	We're just going to zhuzh it up a little around here.
4039000	4040000	That's all.
4040000	4041000	I'm giving Rob the scrunch face.
4041000	4043000	You'll like it, I think.
4043000	4045000	What if I said it's less work for you?
4045000	4046000	I like work.
4046000	4047000	Okay.
4047000	4048000	Well, good.
4048000	4049000	You can...
4049000	4050000	We'll do more.
4050000	4051000	Good.
4051000	4053000	You can get me my B-roll every week.
4053000	4054000	Girl.
4054000	4056000	Hey, I provided B-roll this week.
4056000	4057000	You did.
4057000	4059000	Look, Loki did provide B-roll this week.
4059000	4060000	We just haven't got to it yet.
4060000	4062000	You can just do B-rolls of me playing The Sims.
4062000	4063000	Alright, moving on.
4063000	4065000	Like, look at this bitch.
4065000	4067000	This bitch needs, like, a butt.
4067000	4070000	Anyway, World of Warcraft classic.
4070000	4073000	I have nightmares, though, about fucking World of Warcraft.
4073000	4076000	The old days when you had to level up everything.
4076000	4077000	Oh my god.
4077000	4082000	Anyway, they were actually, though, getting DDOS attacks.
4083000	4087000	It started happening around 11 AM.
4087000	4089000	I'm trying to get the date on this one.
4089000	4090000	Yesterday?
4090000	4092000	A couple days ago?
4092000	4093000	No, September 7th.
4093000	4095000	So that was yesterday for us.
4095000	4098000	At any rate, there was...
4100000	4102000	It looks like they might have narrowed it down to who did it.
4102000	4104000	It was at UK Drilas.
4104000	4107000	Which, I mean, whatever.
4107000	4110000	I'm sure you now think you've got the biggest dick in the world.
4110000	4113000	But really, it's just the one that shoved up your own ass, I don't know.
4115000	4117000	That's not really a real dick.
4117000	4118000	Anyway.
4118000	4121000	I mean, if you were into that, some people could use it.
4121000	4123000	But anyway, moving forward.
4123000	4128000	At any rate, they put up a post saying that about every 20 to 30 minutes
4128000	4131000	they were going to attack the US PvP WoW server.
4131000	4134000	And so the servers did go down.
4134000	4137000	They posted more as the day went on.
4138000	4144000	But Blizzard did a post that, as of yesterday at 6.10 PM,
4144000	4146000	doesn't say what time zone,
4146000	4151000	that all the WoW realms except Rattle Gore were back online and stable.
4151000	4153000	And that they are continuing to investigate
4153000	4157000	and they have some players that might still experience persistent login issues
4157000	4159000	until the maintenance finishes.
4159000	4160000	But yeah.
4160000	4165000	Because somebody is uppity and trying to be a shit.
4165000	4167000	Stop being a shit.
4167000	4169000	It hasn't affected me on Classic WoW Fortsworth,
4169000	4170000	but I'm not on a PvP server.
4170000	4171000	Old Blanchey's PvE.
4171000	4174000	I'm not going to level a fucking priest,
4174000	4176000	an alliance priest on a PvP server.
4176000	4178000	Are you fucking kidding me?
4178000	4181000	That is hard mode, boys and girls.
4181000	4183000	Level a priest on a PvP server.
4183000	4184000	You know what?
4184000	4185000	What?
4185000	4186000	I've done it.
4187000	4188000	How far?
4188000	4190000	You didn't get to 60.
4190000	4193000	Actually, yeah I did.
4193000	4196000	It was when I was playing with...
4196000	4198000	I'm armoring that fucking character right now.
4198000	4199000	What was the name?
4199000	4201000	When? Where? How? What?
4201000	4203000	No, because I deleted him.
4203000	4204000	No, I didn't get it to 60.
4204000	4206000	I got it to 45.
4206000	4207000	That's pretty good.
4207000	4210000	And it was when I was playing on...
4210000	4213000	God, one of my coworkers wanted me to play on their server.
4213000	4216000	I mean, I hardly remember all of my character's names
4216000	4219000	because how many fucking characters did I have?
4219000	4221000	I only remember Rebecca Black, your paladin.
4221000	4223000	You remember Erisa?
4223000	4224000	Oh yeah, that's right.
4224000	4225000	My goat.
4225000	4226000	Not until you say...
4226000	4227000	How can I forget Rebecca Black?
4227000	4228000	But Rebecca Black was the best.
4228000	4231000	Rebecca Black's probably like fucking 21 at this point.
4231000	4233000	I have that screenshot.
4233000	4234000	Oh no, she's older than that.
4234000	4236000	She actually did another song too.
4236000	4239000	But I had a screenshot of some dude following me around in...
4239000	4244000	What was that place in Outworld or Outland or whatever.
4244000	4245000	Oh.
4245000	4246000	That was really pretty.
4246000	4247000	Negrand.
4247000	4248000	Negrand, yeah.
4248000	4251000	Follow me around Negrand, making up lyrics to Friday,
4251000	4252000	following my character around.
4252000	4254000	And I have screenshots of it.
4254000	4255000	But anyway.
4255000	4258000	SSG100Matt says, Rob is demanding receipts.
4258000	4261000	I don't have to prove anything to anybody.
4261000	4265000	Don't gatekeep me.
4265000	4267000	You know, that actually...
4267000	4269000	I'll bring this up as a later topic,
4269000	4274000	but a big con thing is that when a woman dresses as a geeky character,
4274000	4277000	you know, either in a video game or from a comic book,
4277000	4280000	then some dude's gonna pop out out of the bushes.
4280000	4283000	Even if it's inside the hotel, a bush will appear
4283000	4286000	and some gatekeeping bro dude is gonna pop out,
4286000	4289000	quizzing this woman on everything she fucking knows about the game.
4289000	4291000	Should I be concerned that Mr. Smoosh just walked in here?
4291000	4294000	And I think Mr. Smoosh has this look on his face of,
4294000	4295000	well, actually...
4295000	4298000	Mr. Smoosh is not a gatekeeping bro dude.
4298000	4300000	Not all cats.
4300000	4303000	And I want to encourage every woman listening right now,
4303000	4305000	if some guy comes up to you at a con and does that,
4305000	4308000	just say, I don't got shit to prove to you.
4308000	4310000	Do it.
4310000	4312000	We don't have to defend ourselves.
4312000	4313000	Anyway.
4313000	4316000	Can I say on the whole, like, you know, I don't know,
4316000	4317000	stereotypical gender thing.
4317000	4319000	Can I mention one thing about Dragon Con?
4319000	4320000	No, I think this is a good thing.
4320000	4322000	It's a very good thing.
4322000	4325000	Is that, you know, a lot of times,
4325000	4329000	women who wear costumes that are revealing
4329000	4333000	are branded slutatious or whatever you want to say.
4333000	4334000	We all know that's crap.
4334000	4336000	Well, right. I'm not saying I support that,
4336000	4340000	but I was just, I'm very impressed and happy
4340000	4343000	to see that more men and a lot,
4343000	4346000	like just even in the seven years I've been going to Dragon Con,
4346000	4348000	like this year at Dragon Con,
4348000	4353000	the men are fully participating on a similar level at this point.
4353000	4358000	We have, like, it started with Final Fantasy 14 armor
4359000	4361000	and we're seeing it play out in person.
4361000	4362000	The leather underwear?
4362000	4367000	Yes, the men can be just as slutatious or whatever.
4367000	4370000	This show is sponsored by Sublegar.
4370000	4374000	Out of curiosity, did you see a gender-bent Winter Soldier?
4374000	4377000	Do you know how many fucking costumes I saw last weekend?
4377000	4380000	Well, I'm just saying because one of my favorite podcasters
4380000	4383000	was cosplaying at Dragon Con with that costume.
4383000	4385000	Here's the problem, Darsagra.
4385000	4388000	I'm pretty sure I did, but more than one.
4389000	4392000	Well, I just want to say if it ever gets back,
4392000	4395000	shout out to Annie at Stuff Mom Never Told You.
4397000	4401000	I love having other podcasting women who cosplay.
4401000	4403000	Do you know who else was there cosplaying,
4403000	4405000	just fully out, walking the convention, but in full cosplay
4405000	4408000	so nobody knew who he was? T-Pain was there.
4408000	4411000	Oh yeah, he had the, he put the costume up of the,
4411000	4413000	Leroy, what's his face?
4413000	4416000	He was a Tekken character, yeah, Leroy from Tekken.
4416000	4419000	So yeah, I love that.
4419000	4422000	And Jamie Lee Curtis does the same thing at BlizzCon,
4422000	4425000	but she does the full-on mask because nobody, right?
4425000	4429000	He had makeup and was very made-over.
4429000	4432000	And I don't know, the last time I remember seeing T-Pain,
4432000	4435000	he was on that show with all the costumes anyway.
4435000	4438000	He won that show with the Masked Singer.
4438000	4441000	He won that because T-Pain can fucking sing.
4441000	4443000	Have you heard T-Pain?
4443000	4446000	I know people give him shit for the whole auto-tune
4446000	4450000	because he kind of brought that into, he can fucking sing.
4450000	4453000	That was impressive. Anyway, tangent.
4453000	4458000	Anyway, anyway, I know that went from wow, but just like,
4458000	4461000	I'm kind of on this hair trigger now because I've been trying
4461000	4464000	to get my stuff back together to start cosplaying again.
4464000	4467000	And it's, it happens online.
4467000	4469000	It happens in person. It's just bullshit.
4469000	4472000	You know what's interesting is I was on a panel,
4472000	4477000	I think the Twitch 102 panel, and we had a very high-level
4477000	4479000	cosplayer on that panel on the Twitch 102.
4479000	4483000	She actually won the cosplay thing at the last TwitchCon.
4483000	4484000	She's very good at what she does.
4484000	4487000	And I remember making a comment about how one of my friends
4487000	4490000	said DragonCon is kind of like the Super Bowl of cosplay.
4490000	4493000	And she said, in her opinion, she kind of felt KatsuCon
4493000	4497000	was the Super Bowl of cosplay because she thought DragonCon
4497000	4501000	was kind of like an everybody can do cosplay sort of thing,
4501000	4504000	where it's like, and I don't think she meant it in a way
4504000	4506000	like that, I know when I repeat it, it makes it sound like,
4506000	4509000	oh, DragonCon is like the amateurs and KatsuCon is the pro.
4509000	4510000	She didn't mean it like that at all.
4510000	4513000	DragonCon's more like the buffet.
4513000	4516000	I think it is that like at DragonCon, it's like, no,
4516000	4519000	you fucking cosplay, no matter how good or bad you are,
4519000	4522000	you just fucking put on a costume and have fun and go to it.
4522000	4525000	Whereas I think maybe like KatsuCon probably just because
4525000	4529000	KatsuCon has more, and I think I can totally see her comment
4529000	4531000	in context of like the masquerade.
4531000	4534000	Well, it's her past anime expo for anime costumes.
4534000	4537000	Yeah, the masquerade at DragonCon is like,
4537000	4539000	we watch it and drink and make fun of it, okay?
4539000	4542000	It's not, I think if you compare the two masquerades,
4542000	4546000	then her comment makes complete sense in that context
4546000	4550000	because it's the masquerade there and probably KatsuCon's masquerade.
4550000	4553000	Granted, I haven't been to KatsuCon since they,
4553000	4555000	they used to be at a different hotel in DC.
4555000	4556000	They're at the Gaylord.
4556000	4559000	The last cosplay contest I was in was hosted by Trixie Mattel.
4559000	4561000	Yeah, it's been a while.
4561000	4563000	With my Grey Warden.
4563000	4565000	So anyway, but my point is, Dark Sakura,
4565000	4568000	this whole like cosplay thing, I really,
4568000	4570000	I know it's a long way to go,
4570000	4573000	but I also know you miss the South sometimes.
4573000	4575000	You got to come to DragonCon some year.
4575000	4577000	Well, the next year, you know what I'm doing
4577000	4580000	when DragonCon's going on, it's the same weekend as my anniversary.
4580000	4581000	Oh, yeah.
4581000	4583000	So Dan and I are going to New Orleans.
4583000	4584000	Okay, fair, fair.
4584000	4586000	I mean, I could try to say you want to go to DragonCon
4586000	4588000	and then go to New Orleans.
4588000	4590000	But you're going to get snow.
4590000	4592000	But no, we have a plan.
4592000	4594000	Next year's 15, we're going to go to New Orleans
4594000	4595000	and hang out in Jackson Square for a bit
4595000	4598000	and then go visit the family in Mobile.
4598000	4600000	So.
4600000	4601000	All right.
4601000	4602000	Maybe.
4602000	4603000	Are they still doing Mobicon?
4603000	4605000	I have to find out they're still doing Mobicon
4605000	4606000	because I would go back to that.
4606000	4608000	I love the small conventions.
4608000	4610000	Yeah, but S200 Matt says swing both.
4610000	4613000	I did North Carolina and Atlanta one trip
4613000	4615000	but granted, I was gone forever.
4615000	4617000	I feel like I aged while I was gone
4617000	4618000	but I had a great time.
4618000	4619000	Time of my life.
4619000	4622000	Anyway, the little bar says we're still talking about World of Warcraft.
4622000	4623000	Clearly, that's a lie.
4623000	4625000	So let's level set with our next story.
4625000	4626000	Loki.
4626000	4627000	Yes, let's talk about Steam
4627000	4629000	and how they're making some changes.
4629000	4633000	So there was some, I want to say this is stuff
4633000	4637000	that they had like mock-ups that leaked out or whatever
4637000	4640000	but then they also had these like beta programs you can go into.
4640000	4644000	So now there's going to be a whole new change to your library
4644000	4646000	that's going to have lots more pictures and stuff.
4646000	4650000	So they're going to have basically showing different activity
4650000	4652000	with recent games you played,
4652000	4654000	new games that are out,
4654000	4656000	games that your friends are playing,
4656000	4659000	and other categories as well.
4659000	4661000	So it's kind of cool.
4661000	4665000	So with that, they also have like,
4665000	4669000	there'll be stuff that's populated based on what developers
4669000	4670000	and friends are up to.
4670000	4674000	They've got different collections that you can drop your games into
4674000	4676000	to kind of organize them.
4676000	4679000	I'm hoping that there's a, well,
4679000	4682000	maybe it might not be helpful with games you haven't played yet
4682000	4686000	because that's going to be most of my library.
4686000	4688000	But yeah, a lot more content.
4688000	4692000	Definitely going to be looking more updated.
4692000	4695000	Now when this is actually going to go into place,
4695000	4699000	I'm not really sure, but I know that
4699000	4701000	they had some more stuff that,
4701000	4703000	I think there was part of that Steam Labs stuff
4703000	4707000	that they're going to start incorporating into it as well.
4707000	4709000	But it looks interesting.
4709000	4712000	I'm looking forward to a refresh of my Steam library
4712000	4715000	because it's kind of been looking that way.
4715000	4718000	Steam has kind of had the same look for a very long time.
4718000	4719000	Yes.
4719000	4721000	So I'm kind of happy that they're going to, you know,
4721000	4724000	kind of re-approach it and make some changes
4724000	4727000	and kind of freshen up the way your game library looks.
4727000	4729000	It's time to kind of take another approach.
4729000	4731000	I mean, it's kind of a bummer it's not the store
4731000	4733000	because I feel like the store is just like a blah.
4733000	4735000	We have games.
4735000	4738000	It's just like this big barf of games all over
4738000	4740000	and it's hard to find really anything.
4740000	4742000	And they try to make it custom to like,
4742000	4744000	because you play this, you be into this.
4744000	4747000	But I feel like there really needs to be a switch
4747000	4750000	because sometimes I don't want you to tell me
4750000	4752000	what you think I'd like.
4752000	4754000	I want to see what is everybody else playing
4754000	4757000	or what's the featured thing, what's the new indie hotness,
4757000	4758000	those types of things.
4758000	4760000	I feel like the way the Steam store is right now
4760000	4761000	is kind of a mess.
4761000	4763000	But I'm glad they're going to update the library a little bit.
4763000	4766000	And that might have to do with the What's New stuff.
4766000	4768000	So it looks like the What's New is kind of covering
4768000	4774000	different games that you may have had updates to them.
4774000	4776000	So I don't know.
4776000	4778000	It looks interesting. I'm looking forward to it.
4778000	4780000	Okay.
4780000	4782000	We have another, our next story is also about Steam.
4782000	4785000	This one comes to us from Discord.
4785000	4790000	From our user on Discord, 13x4ever sent us an FYI on Discord.
4790000	4792000	By the way, if you want to join the VoG Network Discord,
4792000	4793000	you sure can.
4793000	4797000	vognetwork.com, vognetwork.com slash Discord
4797000	4798000	is the place to get an invite.
4798000	4802000	And we do want to work in more story submissions from Discord.
4802000	4804000	I've already kind of been using them
4804000	4806000	and like thinking about what to plan out for the show.
4806000	4808000	But I haven't been very good at saying,
4808000	4811000	this person submitted this and wants us to talk about it.
4811000	4813000	So I'm going to be better about that in the future.
4813000	4814000	So I have two Discord stories tonight.
4814000	4815000	This is the first.
4815000	4817000	Because it's not really a story, it's a tweet.
4817000	4819000	But it's a tweet worth talking about.
4819000	4823000	So 13x4ever linked us this tweet from a Twitter user named Watsu,
4823000	4825000	underscore Watsu, who said,
4825000	4828000	Steam is changing their contract to guarantee devs
4828000	4832000	will release their games alongside other PC platforms
4832000	4835000	because people were pulling out to Epic Games Store
4835000	4838000	while still using the Steam page and forums
4838000	4842000	to communicate with players because EGS has none of those, LMAO.
4842000	4844000	That's the tweet from Watsu.
4844000	4845000	That is kind of lame.
4845000	4847000	That is super lame.
4847000	4849000	And it's one of those things where I'm like, wow.
4849000	4852000	No, and super lame that Epic doesn't have that
4852000	4854000	and that developers are doing that.
4854000	4856000	Like, I actually think Steam is totally...
4856000	4857000	It's gaming.
4857000	4859000	This is business.
4859000	4861000	Yeah, you want all of this.
4861000	4863000	Well, then you got to go for that.
4863000	4865000	You have to take that with knowing that
4865000	4867000	you're not going to have this and this and this feature.
4867000	4869000	So you got to weigh that.
4869000	4870000	I think this is a great...
4870000	4872000	With as much shit as I've given Steam over the years,
4872000	4874000	rightfully so in my opinion,
4874000	4878000	this is a good moving the chess piece
4878000	4880000	in another direction type of thing
4880000	4882000	to balance some of all these devs
4882000	4884000	taking the oodles and oodles of money
4884000	4886000	that the Epic Store is offering them
4886000	4889000	and then turning around and using the Steam forums for support.
4889000	4891000	I'm sorry, that is pretty fucking old.
4891000	4893000	You're paying for a lot of money for all these Epic exclusives
4893000	4895000	that are these big AAA titles you get.
4895000	4898000	I don't know, put that money into developing these features.
4898000	4900000	Yeah. Well, let me just read the passage.
4900000	4902000	So Watsu, and again, I read a tweet from Watsu.
4902000	4904000	I don't want to own those words.
4904000	4906000	Watsu wrote that tweet and deserves the credit.
4906000	4909000	But in the tweet, there's a screenshot of the updated passage
4909000	4913000	from the Steam distribution agreement under Valve.
4913000	4915000	So it reads like this.
4915000	4917000	Where's our lawyers in the house?
4917000	4918000	Any lawyers in the house?
4918000	4920000	OK, how many of you watch a lot of Law & Order at least?
4920000	4922000	All right, anyway, here it is.
4922000	4924000	The legalese from the Steam distribution agreement.
4924000	4926000	2.1, delivery.
4926000	4929000	Companies shall submit the applications to Steam for release
4929000	4932000	no later than the first commercial release of each application
4932000	4936000	or localized version, or if already commercially released
4936000	4939000	as of the effective date within 30 days of the effective date.
4939000	4942000	Thereafter, companies shall submit to Steam
4942000	4945000	any localized version and application updates
4945000	4947000	in beta and final form when available,
4947000	4950000	but in no event later than they are provided
4950000	4953000	to any other third party for commercial release.
4953000	4957000	Companies shall provide these copies in object code form
4957000	4960000	in whatever format Valve reasonably requests.
4962000	4965000	So it's kind of one of those,
4965000	4967000	if you're going to update on these other platforms,
4967000	4971000	you're basically agreeing you're going to update on ours as well.
4971000	4973000	So you can't just yank off the store
4973000	4975000	and now go release on the Epic Store
4975000	4977000	because they're throwing money at you.
4977000	4980000	I think that's a pretty interesting thing they're doing.
4980000	4982000	Like, it don't work that way.
4982000	4985000	Yeah, so Valve putting the fist down on that.
4985000	4988000	So we'll see what their next move ends up being after this.
4988000	4991000	It's basically the guarantee of don't be a dick.
4991000	4994000	Well, it's...
4994000	4998000	But is taking money that someone is throwing at you being a dick?
4998000	4999000	I mean...
4999000	5003000	But manipulating, you know, it's like...
5003000	5007000	When you break up with somebody,
5007000	5011000	but you date other people, but you still live with them.
5011000	5012000	Make sense?
5012000	5013000	Yes.
5013000	5015000	It's really, really dickly.
5015000	5018000	I think it's less like targeted devs themselves
5018000	5020000	and more of like, hey, listen Epic Games,
5020000	5023000	you can't just lean on our features that we have,
5023000	5025000	like our forms and stuff,
5025000	5029000	just because you're not, you know...
5029000	5030000	You can't just like,
5030000	5032000	oh, hey, we're going to offer you guys money
5032000	5033000	to come to our platform,
5033000	5035000	but if you want, you know, all that stuff,
5035000	5037000	you can just use the Steam forums for that, you know,
5037000	5038000	because we just haven't built it yet,
5038000	5040000	or we haven't built a shopping cart yet or anything else.
5040000	5042000	You can't lean on them for that stuff.
5042000	5043000	You got to develop your own stuff
5043000	5045000	if you want this platform to be successful.
5045000	5048000	Can we do things a little out of order here, actually,
5048000	5050000	because the next logical follow-up to this,
5050000	5052000	now that this is playing out live,
5052000	5054000	I think we have to go to your next story, Loki,
5054000	5055000	and talk about this.
5055000	5056000	I'm going to jump to...
5056000	5058000	We'll come back to what you had, Dark Soccer,
5058000	5062000	because this is like a super logical follow-up to this story.
5062000	5064000	So speaking of Epic Games,
5064000	5067000	so they've had to change their roadmap a little bit,
5067000	5070000	because apparently they haven't hit some of their promises,
5070000	5072000	their targets that they had put out there.
5072000	5078000	So, for example, they had, you know,
5078000	5081000	they had actually promised to do a few things.
5081000	5086000	So one of those was they had a public Trello board
5086000	5088000	that showcased their roadmap
5088000	5090000	of different features that were coming out.
5090000	5094000	And with that, they had to actually change some things.
5094000	5096000	So the Trello roadmap is not fulfilling the goal
5096000	5099000	we had set when we had introduced it.
5099000	5101000	The goal with the Trello roadmap
5101000	5103000	is to provide visibility to the development cycle
5103000	5106000	for the store's more player-centric feature set.
5106000	5110000	While it's accomplished that to some degree,
5110000	5111000	we have missed the mark,
5111000	5114000	accurately displaying that timeline for feature delivery.
5114000	5117000	We regularly delay feature releases
5117000	5122000	due to shifting priorities and need for further iteration.
5122000	5126000	We're always focusing on improving,
5126000	5129000	and we believe that Trello can be improved as well.
5129000	5132000	So apparently, though,
5132000	5135000	they've had some stuff missed from that.
5135000	5138000	So big items that are on their future development
5138000	5142000	include wish lists, a shopping cart, automated refunds,
5142000	5145000	gifting, achievements, and user reviews,
5145000	5148000	kind of, you know, with the bare bones functionality
5148000	5150000	for a storefront.
5150000	5154000	Well, I'd be curious which of these things happen first.
5154000	5156000	I mean, I'm sure we could look at the dates or whatever,
5156000	5158000	but it is very interesting that this is happening
5158000	5161000	around the same time as Steam makes this counter move
5161000	5163000	because it's almost like Epic is missing these marks,
5163000	5166000	and now Steam is putting their iron fist down saying,
5166000	5168000	well, you're not going to be using us
5168000	5169000	as your Band-Aid for this.
5169000	5171000	If you can't deliver on this to your people,
5171000	5173000	then fuck off type of thing, you know?
5173000	5176000	That's kind of like what I'm getting from it.
5176000	5178000	I'm not saying one led to the other or what have you,
5178000	5180000	but it's just, you know, it is interesting
5180000	5183000	that these are timed right around the same week, you know?
5183000	5186000	Yeah, so some things that they're talking about,
5186000	5189000	like I'm looking at their like development
5189000	5191000	and stuff that they've got.
5191000	5194000	So stuff that they've said they've recently shipped.
5194000	5197000	They've had improved patch sizes,
5197000	5201000	the store page redesign, store video hosting,
5201000	5205000	humble bundle integration, that's pretty much it.
5205000	5208000	Up next they have, it says Ubisoft titles
5208000	5211000	require large installs, library list view,
5211000	5216000	player playtime tracking, storefront discovery.
5216000	5219000	I mean, I don't know, there's not a lot of stuff
5219000	5220000	on their storefront.
5220000	5223000	Curated collections, trending, price protection,
5223000	5226000	mod support for games, stuff that's still out there
5226000	5227000	in future development.
5227000	5229000	Of course, we mentioned the wish list, shopping cart,
5229000	5232000	automated refunds, gifting, social overall,
5232000	5236000	direct carrier billing, achievements,
5236000	5238000	additional payment methods.
5238000	5241000	Just like, I don't know, it's very bare bones right now,
5241000	5244000	but I get it, you know, like developers are getting
5244000	5246000	more money and where that is, you know,
5246000	5249000	it is a good thing for smaller developers.
5249000	5252000	You also have to weigh in the fact that there's
5252000	5255000	a lot of community features that are built into
5255000	5256000	the Steam storefront.
5256000	5259000	Maybe you might have to supplement that with something
5259000	5261000	else in the meantime if you're going exclusively
5261000	5263000	with Epic Games.
5263000	5265000	Some comments from our chat over at twitch.tv
5265000	5266000	slash vog network.
5266000	5269000	Kaijuto says, Epic isn't leaning on Steam,
5269000	5271000	it's for devs that want to be shady.
5271000	5273000	You know, and I suppose that is a true point,
5273000	5275000	that this isn't so much about the fact that like,
5275000	5278000	you know, Epic is not telling people to use
5278000	5279000	Steam as a Band-Aid.
5279000	5282000	The reality is the devs are using Steam as a Band-Aid
5282000	5284000	because they want the best of both worlds.
5284000	5286000	They want to be able to have that user interaction
5286000	5289000	and take the check from Epic Games for being exclusive
5289000	5290000	on their store.
5290000	5294000	So it would be unfair to fault Steam,
5294000	5298000	or excuse me, to fault Epic for that.
5298000	5300000	It is the devs' choice to do that.
5300000	5302000	But I think Steam is just putting up this wall saying,
5302000	5304000	you don't, you go to the Epic store,
5304000	5307000	you don't get to have your cake and pie.
5307000	5308000	You don't get to have both.
5308000	5309000	Yeah.
5309000	5311000	So that's what it is.
5311000	5313000	Or, well, I mean, you can be on both stores.
5313000	5315000	You just can't be exclusive to the Epic
5315000	5316000	and take all that money.
5316000	5318000	Anyway, another quick little item here,
5318000	5319000	and then we'll move on to our next story.
5319000	5322000	But a comment from chat I wanted to address
5322000	5324000	is that SheHulk10 in chat says,
5324000	5328000	rapid fire news, Gears 5 released, broken,
5328000	5329000	the worst I've ever seen.
5329000	5330000	Oh, dear.
5330000	5332000	I was watching a friend stream that.
5332000	5334000	Somebody I follow on Twitch was streaming it earlier.
5334000	5335000	It looked kind of neat.
5335000	5338000	I have the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate thing.
5338000	5340000	So I meant to download and play, but it's just, you know,
5340000	5342000	with starting a new job on Monday and everything.
5342000	5343000	And all the traveling I've been doing,
5343000	5345000	I haven't really had a chance to sit down and play it yet,
5345000	5348000	but I hope to in the next week.
5348000	5350000	I'm hoping I can sit down and play some Gears.
5350000	5352000	That's a bummer if it's super broken though.
5352000	5354000	I haven't, I haven't heard a lot of the.
5354000	5355000	Yeah, I haven't heard anything.
5355000	5356000	Yeah.
5356000	5358000	But I'm not a fan of Gears, so.
5358000	5359000	Yeah, I mean.
5359000	5361000	Yeah, I haven't really given a shit.
5361000	5363000	If you have Game Pass though.
5363000	5366000	I haven't really been big on Gears in a long time either,
5366000	5367000	but when I was.
5367000	5368000	I've heard Gear reviews for it though.
5368000	5370000	Yeah, when I was watching this person play on Twitch,
5370000	5372000	I was like, I could, I might try this out.
5372000	5374000	Like I might, I'd be into this.
5374000	5376000	So yeah, I'm gonna check it out.
5376000	5378000	All right. Anyway, let's move on.
5378000	5382000	So we're going to go to a story that Dark Sakura had for us about phones.
5382000	5383000	I did.
5383000	5386000	So, you know, Sony is still in the phone business.
5386000	5391000	Their Xperia 5 is going to be supporting the PS4's DualShock controller.
5391000	5397000	So you can actually game with a legit controller on their phone.
5397000	5402000	I mean, I still don't know why someone would do that,
5402000	5405000	because it's still kind of a small screen.
5405000	5407000	Ambulators.
5407000	5410000	Wanting to be a Switch, I don't know.
5410000	5414000	But, I mean, it's going to have DualShock support.
5414000	5419000	They were, and they also announced that it's eventually going to be coming to,
5419000	5421000	down all the way to the Xperia 1.
5421000	5426000	So it looks like they're going to make that retroactively, I guess, go in there.
5426000	5431000	So it will also work with Fortnite.
5431000	5434000	So they're going to have it go out to a bunch of other games,
5434000	5436000	though, that operate in a mobile space.
5436000	5440000	Oh, that actually says a lot right there, because...
5440000	5442000	Yeah, Fortnite was the big one they mentioned.
5442000	5445000	Yeah, one thing I learned doing that Battle Royale panel with Bobby,
5445000	5449000	Bobby talks about this on his show, so I won't repeat it too much,
5449000	5452000	that you can go download Bobby's show if you want to check that out.
5452000	5458000	But we talked a little bit about how I pinch hit on a Battle Royale panel at Dragon Con.
5458000	5462000	And one thing I kind of learned from the audience about that panel is that
5462000	5465000	there are some people that wouldn't be playing Battle Royale games
5465000	5468000	if it weren't for the fact that Fortnite was such a huge mobile release.
5468000	5471000	That, you know, not everybody has a console or acts as a console,
5471000	5474000	so the fact that it was on the mobile phone was a big deal for some people.
5474000	5478000	So actually, I think when we talk about why do we need a controller on the phone,
5478000	5481000	you telling me that I can play Fortnite on my mobile phone
5481000	5483000	now with a controller as opposed to those touchscreen controllers.
5483000	5484000	Ooh, that's a big deal, I think.
5484000	5488000	I've seen a lot of people, just, you know, different places,
5488000	5492000	I mean, playing on their phones, so...
5493000	5497000	But still, I mean, I don't know, it just seems a little bit of overkill.
5497000	5501000	I don't know how one would set that up, but if they want it, whatever.
5502000	5503000	More power to them.
5503000	5508000	Bobby points out that you can use your Xbox One controller with your Android phone for Xbox.
5508000	5514000	Tigerclaw says some games on mobile let you use USB controllers like DuckTales Remastered, so...
5514000	5518000	I mean, my SteelSeries controller will play with my iPhone and my iPad.
5518000	5522000	Yeah, and I have that Bluetooth iCade thing that you can put, my old iPad goes in there,
5522000	5523000	you can play some of the arcade games.
5523000	5524000	But you know how many times I've used that feature?
5524000	5525000	Yeah.
5525000	5528000	Exactly once, just to see what it was like, and I was like, this is stupid.
5528000	5531000	I play, I use that controller on my Apple TV.
5532000	5534000	I thought that iCade thing was pretty fun, it's just now that...
5534000	5535000	It was fun, but...
5535000	5541000	My iPad's kind of dated now, it was the new iPad, iPad 3, the new iPad, so...
5541000	5544000	Well, and on top of that, it has to have that particular dock.
5544000	5548000	Yeah, oh yeah, because they're all lightning now, yeah, yeah, yeah.
5548000	5549000	That was the old school plug.
5549000	5552000	But I'm sure that there's some kind of mod or converter or something.
5552000	5554000	I gave my mother my old iPad.
5555000	5556000	Dan's won't work with it.
5556000	5557000	Fair enough.
5557000	5562000	All right, anyhow, let's move on and talk a little bit about Uplay Plus,
5562000	5567000	because a lot of these companies are starting to release their own premium gaming services,
5567000	5569000	and Ubisoft is one of them as well.
5569000	5574000	Ubisoft mentioned at E3 in June that they were going to start their own gaming subscription service,
5574000	5577000	and that gaming subscription service is now here.
5577000	5583000	Windows PC users can now subscribe to Uplay Plus to play a library of more than 100 Ubisoft games,
5583000	5588000	including games like Far Cry, Prince of Persia, Assassin's Creed, Rayman.
5588000	5592000	Subscribers will have access to these premium editions,
5592000	5597000	and you get included in beta and early access programs, including Ghost Recon Breakpoint,
5597000	5600000	which just started, it started on September 5th,
5600000	5606000	and the opportunity to play the Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Breakpoint Ultimate Edition on October 1st
5606000	5608000	with three-day early access.
5608000	5611000	So doing a lot of that stuff that EA is doing, basically.
5611000	5616000	The service will cost $15 a month, but here's where the news comes in, really,
5616000	5619000	is that if you want, there's a free trial.
5619000	5624000	So they're just opening it up to everybody from September 3rd to September 30th.
5624000	5627000	So if you want to get in, if you're a free games person,
5627000	5631000	hello, metal mayhem is probably out there,
5631000	5633000	you can play this whole thing.
5633000	5636000	It's Uplayplus.com.
5636000	5640000	But I imagine there's a trick to it, and I haven't signed up myself yet,
5640000	5643000	but almost always when I hear about a free trial deal like this,
5643000	5645000	you have to give them your credit card information,
5645000	5649000	and if you forget to cancel, guess what happens October 1st?
5649000	5652000	Yep, you're going to get charged, as is going to happen.
5652000	5655000	So just keep that in mind if you do decide to sign up for the free trial.
5655000	5658000	But hey, it is still a free trial if you remember to cancel.
5658000	5662000	So, all right, that's Uplayplus.
5662000	5665000	Well, let's travel back. Let's go back to a simpler time.
5665000	5670000	We're going to go back to a simpler time when there was no gaming subscription service.
5670000	5673000	There was Blockbuster, if you wanted to go renegade.
5673000	5675000	This predates so tell of you.
5675000	5679000	This is a classic game, but that's because once a month,
5679000	5684000	you actually like to go way back and visit a soundtrack that you actually think.
5684000	5686000	It's the 2019 twist.
5686000	5688000	You once a month, instead of spotlighting a game,
5688000	5691000	you may pick a game you've done before, which I think is the case tonight,
5691000	5695000	but instead it's like, oh no, we got to talk about the soundtrack,
5695000	5697000	and I totally know why you picked tonight's game, so let's get to it.
5697000	5698000	All right.
5698000	5704000	So tonight's game in Japan was known as Akumajou Densetsu,
5704000	5707000	which we got as Castlevania III.
5707000	5712000	And the music in this one, and I picked this particular piece of music
5712000	5715000	if we can play the very beginning of the level.
5715000	5719000	The timestamp was here, so the intro, and then I did the whole take out
5719000	5724000	and put the actual stereo mix music here to take out the game noises.
5724000	5727000	And I verify it is the Famicom because I know there's a big difference.
5727000	5729000	No, Famicom Disk.
5729000	5730000	Right, yes.
5730000	5731000	Not Famicom Disk, sorry, yeah.
5731000	5733000	But there's two different things about this one anyway.
5733000	5741000	So basically, the Japanese version of this game had a VRC6 coprocessor chip
5741000	5746000	that was actually partially created by the game's audio programmer,
5746000	5748000	Maezawa Hidenori.
5748000	5753000	It has two extra pulse wave channels and a salt wave channel
5753000	5758000	that adds to the system's initial set of five sound channels.
5758000	5764000	So basically, it's going to put out more sound.
5764000	5767000	It's got better audio quality.
5767000	5773000	But the US NES did not have the ability to support those external sound chips.
5773000	5780000	So it replaced that with the memory management controller 5, the MMC5,
5780000	5784000	that just wasn't anywhere near.
5784000	5790000	So basically, this version of the game has far better music
5790000	5792000	than we got here in the United States.
5792000	5794000	It was ethically stellar.
5794000	5797000	It's not to say that the soundtrack here was bad,
5797000	5802000	but it's just like imagine a yummy piece of cake
5802000	5806000	and then you put ice cream on top of the cake.
5806000	5814000	Or more relevant, think of the Sega Master System with the FM chip.
5814000	5816000	I just wanted to think about cake.
5816000	5821000	Or listening to a mono CD and suddenly being able to listen to it in stereo.
5821000	5823000	But yeah, I like cake.
5823000	5825000	Cake sounds good.
5825000	5832000	Anyway, so that is really the biggest reason that I wanted to highlight this.
5832000	5839000	And I also do want to think that the Switch version that we got.
5839000	5843000	Yeah, the Famicom version was made available on the Switch
5843000	5846000	as an update to the collection that came out.
5846000	5851000	So you can now experience this beauty without having to import anything.
5851000	5855000	But a little bit more about the music for Castlevania III.
5855000	5859000	Like I said, it was composed by Maizawa Hidenori.
5859000	5866000	Also by Funahashi Jun and Morimoto Yukie.
5866000	5872000	And again, the sound chip was the Konami VRC6.
5872000	5878000	And the good thing about this as well is that because this was considered so iconic,
5878000	5884000	we actually now have multiple releases of the soundtrack for this, including a vinyl.
5884000	5892000	So this, I do also believe, is the first game that had the song beginning in it,
5892000	5898000	which has become one of the staples of the Castlevania series.
5898000	5906000	Also, the songs Mad Forest and Prelude have been used in other titles as well.
5906000	5909000	The other thing that, you know, because I also like to bring up things
5909000	5913000	that the sound designers have also created for other games.
5913000	5919000	Maizawa has done Parodius for MSX, Gradius and Salamander.
5919000	5923000	He did Ditana Twinbee, I mean, it's Konami.
5923000	5929000	Zexus, Contra Spirits, Konami All-Stars 1993.
5929000	5934000	I'm just going through, you know, a bunch of more Parodius, more Twinbee.
5934000	5937000	I'm trying to find some more recent stuff.
5937000	5945000	Because he also did music for a couple of live concerts as well.
5945000	5947000	For Kouda Mariko.
5947000	5950000	Also, let's see where the recent stuff is.
5950000	5955000	So Suikoden, a little bit more recent.
5955000	5957000	What were you laughing about?
5957000	5958000	I'll tell you later.
5958000	5959000	Okay.
5959000	5962000	Ys Ark of Napishtim.
5962000	5965000	I always mispronounce that one anyway.
5965000	5968000	Sora Tokazu no Kimi Toboku.
5968000	5971000	He did that one.
5971000	5973000	Just looking through the list on here.
5973000	5979000	Some more Contra as of late.
5979000	5987000	And he worked on remastering for the Castlevania III Dracula's Curse vinyl release.
5987000	5990000	And the Girlfriend Beta Character Song series.
5990000	5998000	So anyway, he's done a lot of the staples here in a lot of Konami games and other projects.
5998000	6005000	But at any rate, this is, to some people, a lot of the pinnacle of the Castlevania series.
6005000	6009000	If you're going to go with the 8-bit era.
6009000	6014000	I mean, there's people who will argue that Super Castlevania IV is the best of the series.
6014000	6017000	I think you're lying because it's Rondo of Blood.
6018000	6023000	But here we go. This is still considered one of the best video game soundtracks ever.
6023000	6027000	And really, just to reiterate something you said a moment ago about the whole Castlevania collection.
6027000	6035000	There is a way you can play this in its intended form with that glorious Famicom disc soundtrack right now on the Switch.
6035000	6037000	And it is through that collection.
6037000	6041000	And I know you're spotlighting this game, but just to kind of take it aside.
6041000	6045000	There's other Famicom disc games that have better soundtracks thanks to that chip.
6045000	6049000	Namely, The Legend of Zelda and Metroid are two that come to mind.
6049000	6052000	And you can even play, if you have that Nintendo Online subscription.
6052000	6053000	I've done livestreams of this.
6053000	6056000	Actually, I think I did it as a break segment early on.
6056000	6057000	I think we've talked about it.
6057000	6061000	Is that you can go play those on the Famicom.
6061000	6063000	You just create a Japanese account on your Switch, you go download the Famicom.
6063000	6066000	And it still works as long as you have a Nintendo Online subscription in any country.
6066000	6070000	And you can actually play the Famicom version of Zelda or Metroid.
6071000	6074000	And you can see Metroid with save files instead of passwords.
6074000	6076000	And with that extra chip.
6076000	6078000	Now, Castlevania isn't in that collection.
6078000	6080000	You'll have to buy Konami's collection separately to hear that.
6080000	6082000	But it's still really cool.
6082000	6083000	That's it.
6083000	6084000	Alright.
6084000	6085000	There it is.
6085000	6086000	Your classic soundtrack.
6086000	6087000	Go play it.
6087000	6088000	But not right now.
6088000	6090000	Yeah, go play it, but not right now.
6090000	6093000	Put it on hold to go play a little later on.
6093000	6095000	Alright, great pick.
6095000	6096000	Great pick.
6096000	6099000	We are going to move on with our show.
6099000	6101000	And we're going to actually go over to Loki.
6101000	6106000	Because, Loki, so you actually, you took like a video that we're going to play here as our break.
6106000	6112000	We're not going to be able to play this on the podcast because you just have video with like music playing over it.
6112000	6114000	So it's not really going to work for the podcast.
6114000	6117000	Because there's not a lot for the podcast to listen to.
6117000	6122000	But I still want you to talk about where you were at and what you saw and kind of set this up for us.
6122000	6124000	It's like four and a half minute video we're going to look at.
6124000	6129000	Yeah, so I went to a thing called the Capital Creative Showcase.
6129000	6135000	You may remember in the past we've done an event called the Sacramento Indie Arcade.
6135000	6138000	So that's what this has become is this new showcase.
6138000	6143000	Because now it's no longer the Sacramento chapter of the IGDA.
6143000	6145000	It's now the Game Dev Association.
6145000	6146000	Yeah, the game.
6146000	6149000	Yeah, now it's the Sacramento Development Crew.
6149000	6151000	Oh no, it's the Indie Collective or something like that.
6151000	6153000	Sacramento Developer Collective.
6153000	6156000	The Developer Collective is what's now called the SDC.
6156000	6162000	So it's their new event. This was put on by Capital or sponsored by Capital Games, the EA company there.
6162000	6167000	So it's basically it's a bunch of indie developers showing off stuff.
6167000	6172000	So they've got this the SDC does a thing called the Progressive Game Jam.
6172000	6180000	So they have like I think like six teams or so that will do work on a game over the course of a few months every Saturday for a few hours.
6180000	6188000	And so they're showing off their progress on their games as well as other local developers in the area showing off what they're working on.
6188000	6191000	And then there's also like artists and they have local businesses.
6191000	6199000	So like there was a VR experience company that can go in there and rent time at one of their booths with high end VR stuff and play games.
6199000	6203000	That's why I played the Beat Saber in.
6203000	6209000	So I took some video of that because I took my kids because my oldest son who's doing a coding class.
6209000	6218000	And I thought, hey, it would be kind of cool to get him kind of excited about game development and show what like other kids, you know, are working on as well as adults.
6218000	6222000	You know, just like, hey, look, see, this is what you can be doing and stuff like that.
6222000	6225000	Did they have like local gaming media and Twitch streamers and stuff there, too?
6225000	6232000	Well, you see, they did invite the number one podcast, the gaming podcast of the Sacramento area there.
6232000	6239000	No, I'm just kidding. No, no. We did. I did see I did talk to Corey over it.
6239000	6245000	But the banner still says that, doesn't it? Video game bang. Yes. And the banner still say that. I don't remember. I didn't notice.
6245000	6251000	I think I saw a picture. I think it still says that's right. That's right. That's fine. Give him crap. But so they have them.
6251000	6257000	The theme this year was women in gaming. So they had like a bunch of panels at their black box theater.
6257000	6261000	I didn't take any of my kids to that because they would not not have behaved.
6261000	6267000	I was just asking because I noted that I just I can't help but notice I just I guess our invite was was lost somewhere.
6267000	6272000	I don't I don't know what happened. It was a much smaller event this year. So I don't know if they had their idea.
6272000	6276000	I have to give a little I was just surprised to come back to my trip. I didn't get to run into.
6276000	6281000	Oh, this is. Yeah, I didn't get to run into Gabriel or Brianna.
6281000	6286000	So I didn't get to run into either of them because they were gone.
6286000	6290000	But yeah, I hope they had a great event. I'm just being saucy. I hope they legit had a great event.
6290000	6294000	I'm sad. I'm sad I miss. I would have just gone like once you told me about it. I was like, oh, I should go.
6294000	6300000	But like literally the worst weekend you could possibly picked with me having just been out of town and starting a new job.
6300000	6306000	So but next time we'd love to help out again. Just you know where to find us.
6306000	6311000	Yeah. But I'm glad at least you got to go and take the kids. I mean, that's that's even better that you get to.
6311000	6316000	Yeah, because I wasn't sure I was going to be able to go. But thankfully, we had plans canceled the last minute.
6316000	6320000	So I was able to take them for a couple hours and go check out what they had there.
6320000	6325000	Like I didn't get to check out any of the speakers, but they had a lot of like they had a female twitch streamers.
6325000	6329000	They had game developers, different business entrepreneurs in the area.
6329000	6336000	They had while we were there, they had other like there was a twitch streamer streaming stuff as well.
6336000	6341000	So it was it's definitely low key, but I got to play everything.
6341000	6345000	I didn't get to film everything, but I played pretty much all of the games that were there.
6345000	6351000	So we'll talk a little bit about those. I think low key cons are great. Not low key cons, but low key conventions are great, too.
6351000	6355000	They're some of my favorite to go to. I would go to low key condos.
6355000	6360000	Me, too. But no, I like the smaller conventions are awesome.
6360000	6366000	Even that year, it was remember the first year we went to the showcase and it was in that the colony thing where they did the.
6366000	6370000	Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. One room. It was like a real tight fit. Yeah. That was a great.
6370000	6374000	It was fun. It was. Yeah. So anyway. All right.
6374000	6378000	So we're just going to play this program. Yeah. They had a program with a map and everything.
6378000	6383000	So that reminds me so I can talk about everything. So some of the things that aren't featured in there.
6384000	6390000	I just want to see who is there. So they had they had this one game.
6390000	6393000	They had like not only are there like video games there, but there's also like board games.
6393000	6398000	So that one of the guys actually did a video game that I did film in here.
6398000	6405000	He's working on a board game right now called Bike Route Sacramento. So he's got that, which he's looking to release pretty soon.
6405000	6410000	They had actually like a developer of some middleware stuff that was there.
6410000	6417000	A capital games was there as well. They were showing off some stuff. I think also recruiting and whatnot.
6417000	6421000	Like I said, there is I got to play a robot dating sim, which was kind of cool.
6421000	6429000	So they had that there. There was this one game I played that was kind of a cross between a match three and kind of like an idol clicker type thing.
6429000	6437000	So you're you have this minor guy who is mining a cave and then he would be knocking out gems that would end up in your match three stuff.
6437000	6443000	And then you use the match three stuff, matching gems, get you gold, which you use to upgrade your minor and do all that.
6443000	6449000	So that was kind of cool. The back and forth mobile game that they're going to be putting out at some point.
6449000	6455000	But yeah, so we can show the video and maybe I don't know if I could I can talk a little bit more about like what is in the video as well.
6455000	6460000	Yes, of course. Let's do that. So for the podcast listeners, though, we're going to do a little fast forward here.
6460000	6469000	But for those of you that are watching live at Twitch TV, here is some of the footage that was shot from the Capitol Creative Showcase that Loki attended over this last weekend.
6469000	6478000	Roll it. So we're back after looking at the Capitol Creative Showcase and some of the games that you saw around there.
6478000	6480000	So those are your kids playing the games. Those are my kids.
6480000	6485000	Yeah. So like that was a little treat for our Twitch people, because I don't know if they've ever like your kids.
6485000	6488000	One of your kids has been on the show, but that was when we were before we were on Twitch.
6488000	6499000	So, yeah, there was like some of their favorite games that Luminous Flux was the last one that they showed was sort of the the that's one of the progressive game jam games that they were working on.
6499000	6506000	So that was it's like a described as a one on one like battle royale type game where you jump between planets and stuff.
6506000	6509000	So it kind of like a Mario Galaxy type feel to where you can like fly around.
6509000	6516000	So and they were having fun just playing around with like the physics of it. There wasn't really a whole game there, but they were kind of making their own fun with it.
6516000	6521000	And then there was another one that was like a dodgeball game that's set on a planet.
6521000	6526000	I think that's what I was asking about. What was that other game? Onionhead Dodgeball from our channel?
6526000	6534000	I don't remember the name off the top of my head. It was on the video there, but it was I have to look up here.
6534000	6540000	It was Fizzy Fuse Games was the one that she they had like one of the three team members there.
6540000	6546000	And she was like, hand out her resume and stuff. But it was kind of a spherical dodgeball game.
6546000	6553000	So you could actually get different power ups and stuff with the dodgeballs and you're supposed to be fighting these two bots in there.
6553000	6557000	So they had they had a lot of fun. They're like they were just, you know.
6557000	6563000	Yeah. You were telling me that one of your kids like didn't really want to go. But then when he went, he was like, yeah, they just had like a blast.
6564000	6575000	That's how it usually goes. So I mean, I know like the luminous flux stuff like those like they were pretty happy with like how excited my kids were getting about their games.
6575000	6583000	I mean, that's got to feel good. Just I think that is like the whole point of doing these types of things is to actually get to see people playing your game for the first time is a pretty big trip.
6583000	6588000	Yeah. So like there was there's a lot of cool stuff. The lonely zombie thing. I loved how they had there.
6588000	6595000	You kind of saw in the very beginning of the video, they they had the whole booth set up, you know, with kind of this broken streetlight thing.
6595000	6602000	And it was a pretty polished game. I liked checking it out. The one version I got to play because I was helping my youngest and played.
6602000	6607000	You saw it in the beginning where he couldn't jump on the platforms or whatever, but they had like two different builds.
6607000	6613000	So the one we played was like very early than the one in my other son was playing was like much more polished and finished.
6613000	6619000	And it was pretty cool. I like to check it out. And then there was one where he was spawning a thousand bats.
6619000	6624000	It wasn't his game. They're showing that some tools that they're making. So that was actually an in-game.
6624000	6635000	They can play the game and edit the level in real time and like actually save the progress that they do and then change stats like of their players at the same time in real time.
6635000	6639000	So like if they wanted to say, OK, this power is going to make me jump, you know, this high.
6639000	6646000	They can type it in and then start developing a level around that power up or something like that and just change it in real time, which is really cool.
6646000	6653000	So it's shown off that there are some other stuff that we didn't see. There was a cube combat game.
6653000	6656000	You didn't have a whole lot there yet. It was just basically movement.
6656000	6662000	So kind of just showing the movement and testing some of the shooting and stuff, very basic things.
6662000	6669000	But it's kind of cool to see some of that stuff there. And like I said, I played a robot dating sim game that was kind of interesting.
6669000	6674000	So, you know, not my usual cup of tea, but it was it was cool to see that there.
6674000	6684000	And they had this weird golf game with this monster that would pick you had to pick up the ball and run around while these worms were chasing after you.
6684000	6687000	I didn't really see how that was golf, but it was it was something that was there.
6687000	6694000	And then can't be any worse than ninja golf. And then, yeah, they just have like a bunch of cool stuff there.
6694000	6702000	So it was really fun like to do that. I would love I mean, I would love to just be actually there displaying my games at some point.
6702000	6707000	So I would love to do that. And one of the things that they have with the SCC is you can actually become a member and stuff.
6707000	6713000	So you pay like a membership of 50 bucks a year or whatever. And with that comes like free booth space if you want.
6713000	6721000	Although I think if you want like a really tiny booth, they don't really charge you for it. But that might be something worth while.
6721000	6724000	They're also going to do another. Could we share the space and promote Sacramento? Yeah.
6724000	6731000	Number two. We could. Well, we can we could actually pick up. Boot space isn't really that expensive, so we could do that.
6731000	6736000	And then they also have I think there's there's like we have there's like a budget and stuff for sponsorship now.
6736000	6741000	I have to like ask questions. OK, well, you know, it's it's pretty I mean, small spaces, but I'm sure we can swing it.
6741000	6749000	And I'm sure we could talk them swing. But they're also doing a sack gamer expo that's in December that they're also going to have some developers there as well.
6749000	6753000	And they're always that that's the the people that do sack anime doing that thing. I think so.
6753000	6757000	Yeah. So they're going to do that. They're going to have the voice actor that does Bowser there and stuff.
6757000	6761000	So it'll be OK. It'll be interesting. So I may go to that.
6761000	6766000	Those folks, because I think I think the people with sack horror that I do a lot with work with them.
6766000	6771000	So I'd probably know people. But yeah. So maybe I'll get on that. So we good.
6771000	6775000	But yeah, it was fun. So I had a pretty good time and I definitely want to go back next year.
6775000	6784000	I'd love to be able to actually show some stuff off next year. Would be kind of fun to have people play stuff, but we'll see.
6784000	6789000	All right. Well, I'm I'm actually like all the sass aside about the invite and stuff.
6789000	6794000	I understand there. There's they they had to start over in many ways when they separated from my GDA and so forth.
6794000	6799000	So it's almost like they're kind of like this is like their year one. So I'm really happy to see that it's gone well.
6799000	6802000	It seemed to be very well received and it's just going to grow from there. And that's awesome.
6802000	6808000	And whatever we can do to support developers in the Sacramento area, like I'm I'm all about it, you know,
6808000	6813000	and that just indie developers in general, like, you know, I say Sacramento because that's where we're at.
6813000	6818000	But if somebody from the Bay Area want to drive up here, pitch their game. Hell, yeah. Like, I'm all about that.
6818000	6821000	So, you know, exactly. We haven't had a lot of guests since we made them. Exactly.
6821000	6825000	Well, I was studio space is a little weird. Yeah. But yeah, I talked to I talked to them.
6825000	6829000	In fact, that luminous arc thing, I got one of the developers emails and stuff.
6829000	6834000	I mean, they're like high school kids, but like it would be it'd be cool just to get like some different developers.
6834000	6839000	And we can always tape it for a break or at some point. And I've threatened this on the show before.
6839000	6844000	Either we're going to have a long term reshuffle of this studio or we're moving.
6844000	6848000	So and that's that the second number two seems more likely at this point.
6848000	6858000	So and the nice thing is the next studio space studio and eight or whatever we decide to call the next one will be designed with streaming in mind because this one was the studio.
6858000	6869000	Crazy eight. We were that's actually going we were still radio only for those of you that are like tuning in on Twitch, you know, for the first time or whatever and going, God, these guys have kind of a crap layout.
6869000	6875000	Well, it's because we've been an audio only presentation for like 16 plus years. And this this isn't even how we were laid out for audio.
6875000	6882000	We were kind of it was actually even different here. I think I completely faced this way and I didn't I didn't even look at him.
6882000	6890000	I didn't even look at him. I can't even look at him. Don't look. I contact only when I say the first word.
6890000	6897000	All right. Anyway, moving on. Let's move on and get back into some rapid fire news.
6897000	6905000	Thanks again. I'm I'm glad at least one of us went to the Capitol Creative Showcase. And I do want to wish best of luck to all the local game developers and the gamer collective as they continue to grow.
6905000	6916000	Well, I also was you're welcome back to the show anytime. The other thing, too, is like I had mentioned it to the owner of the business that my son does this coding stuff that actually ran into them.
6916000	6922000	So they actually went as well. I'm trying to get them to I think that if they had a booth there as well, that would be kind of cool.
6922000	6930000	And also maybe like show off some games. And I don't know. I just want that John Cena game your kid made. Yeah, we could be funny.
6930000	6935000	All right. Now, dude, when you like, I wish I could have been doing that shit when I was like seven years old.
6935000	6940000	Are you fucking kidding? Like, I think it's so awesome what the kids today are doing.
6940000	6945000	You know, when I was seven, the most I was doing was typing in a program in basic in the back.
6945000	6951000	And maybe I would learn that if I change like this number, it would make the text red instead of yellow or something.
6951000	6955000	And I was like, oh, I did that. You know, so you got to start somewhere, I guess. Yeah. All right.
6955000	6958000	Moving on. Let's get to some rapid fire news and travel around the world.
6958000	6966000	It gave me news a little quickly with some quick headlines. Loki. So apparently Cyberpunk 2077 is getting multiplayer.
6966000	6973000	So that's kind of cool. Apparently, the game's going to launch with just the single player, of course, in April after DLC is released.
6973000	6977000	The multiplayer is going to be rolled out. So curious to see what that's all about.
6977000	6982000	But I'm very excited for Cyberpunk 2077. So we'll have to see what it is.
6982000	6987000	This is kind of cool. So it's been a while since we talked about Grand Theft Auto.
6987000	6993000	And Grand Theft Auto San Andreas was ported to mobile devices back in 2013.
6993000	6997000	So it's been a long time. I mean, they ported to Xbox 360 after that.
6997000	7005000	And so apparently, though, there's some YouTubers have discovered that there's some hidden developer codes in there.
7005000	7016000	So on top of what cheat codes were already in the game, they've discovered that there's additional stuff that they added specifically for the mobile version, which is kind of cool.
7016000	7025000	So some of these cheats apparently give certain weapons and stuff that aren't easily available in the game.
7025000	7031000	There's some that pass some of the missions. So it's a script bypass cheat.
7031000	7039000	And yeah, it's kind of cool. So they have some of these outlined now that you can check out.
7039000	7041000	Very cool.
7041000	7045000	This is relevant to all of your interests. Like it's Grand Theft Auto and it's cheating in games.
7045000	7047000	I love both. Yes.
7047000	7050000	Perfect. Somebody gets somebody gets there.
7050000	7053000	It's been a while since they played the mobile version of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
7053000	7056000	But like, I'll check it out.
7056000	7058000	This is worth a reinstall at least.
7058000	7059000	Sure.
7059000	7063000	All right. Moving on to kind of a coming and going in the gaming industry.
7063000	7069000	Ikumi Nakamura has actually departed from Tango and Zenimax.
7069000	7073000	Ikumi Nakamura was working on a game called Ghostwire Tokyo.
7073000	7080000	And this is how a lot of you got to know her, because she was a very positive, kind of peppy individual that was on stage at E3 this year.
7080000	7085000	And everybody was like, oh, you know, like somebody who seems to enjoy working games and having fun.
7085000	7087000	And that energy is kind of infectious.
7087000	7091000	So it's a little bit like, oh, shucks to hear that on the Twitter announcement.
7091000	7094000	After not from Nakamura one nine three is her handle on Twitter.
7094000	7100000	After nine years as creative director and art director at Tango and Zenimax, I felt here is one ends of the journeys.
7100000	7103000	I learned from the talented people I worked with and I respect.
7103000	7106000	Contact me if anyone wants to work with me.
7106000	7108000	And then left a link to her LinkedIn.
7108000	7112000	So they didn't really say like, why, what's going on?
7112000	7115000	It is interesting that she leaves the LinkedIn at the end.
7115000	7119000	So that means there isn't something else immediately lined up potentially.
7119000	7121000	So not sure. Not sure what to read into that.
7121000	7129000	It's not really my business anyway, but we wish her all the best and hope she finds a dream job to her liking very soon.
7129000	7132000	Because she was a lot of she should be on stage representing somebody at E3.
7132000	7136000	Yeah. So anyway, maybe maybe Konami will have availability.
7136000	7141000	I know. I know. Konami has been kind of like the laughing joke of the industry for a couple of years now,
7141000	7148000	which has always pained our hearts because obviously this shows roots are in Dance Dance Revolution and other Konami created franchises.
7148000	7153000	But you know what? You got to give credit when credit is due.
7153000	7158000	And some of the recent Konami offerings, like they're a Bomberman Reinvention was pretty good.
7158000	7164000	The Castlevania collection and the Gradius all those new collections, you know, even though their collections just re releases of their old games.
7164000	7168000	But they've it's they hey, at least they included the Japanese versions.
7168000	7170000	At least they did some like extra things with them.
7170000	7173000	So, you know, we'll give credit where credit is due.
7173000	7180000	But they have plans for new console games involving, quote, globally known IPs.
7180000	7198000	This was in an interview with Konami Europe President Masami Saso saying that the publisher is still looking at high end console games and plans to make more games beyond Pro Evo Soccer and Yu-Gi-Oh to, quote, work on projects with other globally known IPs in the near future.
7198000	7203000	Which leaves many people to fan wank away at could they just do a Metal Gear without Kojima?
7203000	7206000	Because, I mean, they could. They'd be within their rights.
7206000	7216000	Well, we do have the basically their streaming or stage show timeline for Tokyo Game Show.
7216000	7220000	OK, but so but this is coming off of is that a NeoGaf logo?
7220000	7223000	OK, that's what it's from the official site, though.
7223000	7224000	All right. Is it OK?
7224000	7227000	I was like, he's reading a NeoGaf post.
7227000	7229000	OK, so what's the timeline?
7229000	7235000	So, like, some of the stuff that they're going to be talking about, of course, Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links.
7235000	7241000	They've got Super Bomberman RX Bonk, they said Bonkuri collaboration stage.
7241000	7242000	I don't know what that is.
7242000	7244000	Death March Club.
7244000	7247000	They have several games that have to do with baseball.
7247000	7251000	Of course, they're powerful pro baseball stuff.
7251000	7253000	A-Train.
7253000	7256000	Why have they never put out an A-Train game here?
7256000	7257000	I don't know.
7257000	7259000	Dude, the A-Train goes back.
7259000	7267000	But don't worry, they haven't forgotten about you Bomani fans because they have the Bomani Ultimate Mobile special stage.
7267000	7271000	It's going to be showing off some stuff for that.
7271000	7273000	That's on September 12th.
7273000	7275000	Oh, that's it? That's the big thing?
7275000	7277000	That one's on September 12th. That's it.
7277000	7281000	The rest of the days, you know, they have some stuff talking about the PC Engine Mini.
7281000	7286000	There's another Konami thing people were excited about. That's right, the PC Engine. That sounded really cool.
7286000	7290000	And to be fair, this is just Tokyo Game Show. They may still have something else in the works.
7290000	7295000	Who knows? We're left here to imagine maybe A-Castlevania or something else in the future.
7295000	7297000	Who knows? Anything's possible, right?
7297000	7300000	I'm just curious. There may be more stuff that they haven't announced.
7300000	7305000	They're not going to probably put all their announcements into their timeline here.
7306000	7309000	Anyway, nice rapid story, but no, that's alright.
7309000	7311000	It was worth digging in a little deeper with.
7311000	7314000	But Dark Sakura has a few quick things for us, then we'll move on.
7314000	7320000	Yeah, SNK put out an announcement that they are doing a Neo Geo Arcade Stick Pro.
7320000	7326000	Quote, Pro Gear Spec Advanced Entertainment System based off of the Neo Geo CD controller.
7326000	7330000	Which was okay. I mean, I've got one.
7330000	7335000	But yeah, it's going to be the next thing they put out after the Neo Geo Mini.
7335000	7337000	No real information on that yet.
7337000	7343000	Yeah, I couldn't tell if that's just for their Neo Geo systems, or if that's going to be for console systems.
7343000	7345000	Yeah, I didn't say.
7345000	7352000	And also, Sony has confirmed they will not be hosting a press conference at Tokyo Game Show 2019.
7352000	7355000	They said on their website that they weren't doing it.
7355000	7364000	They'll be livestreaming from their booth at the event, but they are going to focus on games like Final Fantasy VII Remake and...
7364000	7367000	Is it Naya or Neo? Neo 2?
7369000	7375000	And there's rumors that they might talk about a next PlayStation, but not really.
7375000	7380000	But at least the fans there are going to get to play Final Fantasy VII.
7380000	7382000	Oh, they get to get their hands on it.
7382000	7385000	Well, I mean, actually E3 had a demo too, right? But that was just...
7385000	7387000	Release the demo! Release the demo!
7387000	7388000	I know, right?
7388000	7389000	Release the demo!
7389000	7390000	Release the hounds.
7390000	7396000	But, I mean, Sony just is basically taking the E3 playbook and applying it here too.
7396000	7400000	They're sitting out because they've got a slower year ahead.
7400000	7404000	Because they're locking and loading for PlayStation 5, likely next year.
7404000	7406000	So, all right.
7406000	7410000	Tokyo Game Show doesn't get treated any differently than E3 did, it sounds like, at the end of the day.
7410000	7411000	So, all right.
7411000	7412000	Let's see.
7412000	7417000	Oh, and Bobby Blackwolf points out the Evil G Expo, which took place during our break.
7417000	7423000	I think maybe the weekend of our tape show had the Final Fantasy VII Remake demo playable.
7423000	7426000	One of the local Twitch streamers is a store manager.
7426000	7427000	So, that's right.
7427000	7433000	I got to meet some Twitch people at Dragon Con because there was a couple Twitch meetups I got taken to.
7433000	7435000	And then, of course, there were a few panels.
7435000	7439000	So, I really should have said a big hello at the top to anyone I met at Dragon Con.
7439000	7445000	But I imagine most people, if they looked up the feed, probably heard last week's show first instead.
7445000	7449000	But this one's the full show as opposed to the hour and a half.
7449000	7453000	Although, I will say quickly about the tape show that we did.
7453000	7457000	The Twitter thing, those questions were so good.
7457000	7461000	And a lot of the discussion that we had, I think, as a result, I thought was really good.
7461000	7466000	You can look forward to Twitter being an important part of the show moving forward.
7466000	7470000	I think we'll probably incorporate that back into the show a little more formally.
7470000	7473000	But more info on that to continue.
7473000	7476000	Nifty805 says, come to TwitchCon.
7476000	7477000	I would love to.
7477000	7479000	I would absolutely love to.
7479000	7484000	The reality is because I'm starting a new job, I can't.
7484000	7487000	But I want to go so bad.
7487000	7488000	You guys don't even know.
7488000	7493000	Just because it's such a great networking opportunity and to just learn about the craft
7493000	7495000	and really try to better what we're doing on Twitch.
7495000	7497000	I badly want to go.
7497000	7501000	But again, because I'm starting a new job and the day job is more.
7501000	7503000	Paying my rent is more important than anything else.
7503000	7505000	I have to make a tough choice.
7505000	7507000	So no TwitchCon for me.
7507000	7509000	Sad face.
7509000	7511000	But don't.
7511000	7513000	One of my best friends just moved to San Diego.
7513000	7515000	So it's like I have a place to stay.
7515000	7517000	So don't think I'm not turning the gears.
7517000	7519000	Is there a way this could work one way or the other?
7519000	7520000	So we'll see.
7520000	7521000	Anyway.
7521000	7522000	All right.
7522000	7528000	Let's move on and travel around the world and check out some world release dates.
7528000	7529000	All right.
7529000	7530000	Both your stories.
7530000	7531000	I'm sorry.
7531000	7532000	I'm sorry.
7532000	7533000	OK.
7533000	7534000	Sorry.
7534000	7535000	It was the Neo Geo and then Sony.
7535000	7536000	Right.
7536000	7537000	I'm sorry.
7537000	7538000	I had a space cadet moment.
7538000	7539000	OK.
7539000	7540000	So let's move on and talk about world release dates and what's coming out in the gaming
7540000	7541000	store near you.
7541000	7544000	We've got caravan stories on PlayStation 4.
7544000	7548000	E-Football Pro Evolution Soccer 2020.
7548000	7552000	That's on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
7552000	7556000	Gears 5 on PC and Xbox One.
7556000	7560000	Greed Fall on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
7560000	7562000	We have.
7562000	7565000	And I'm going to mispronounce this already.
7565000	7567000	Uta War.
7567000	7568000	I'm not even going to pronounce it.
7568000	7570000	There's a game coming out on PlayStation 4.
7570000	7572000	Let's just put it that way.
7572000	7573000	I'm not going to try to butcher the Japanese.
7573000	7574000	It is a game.
7574000	7575000	It is a game.
7575000	7576000	It is an action role playing.
7576000	7579000	You might decide to beat him up game.
7579000	7580000	Uta War.
7580000	7581000	Yeah.
7581000	7584000	My American mouth cannot say the Japanese name.
7584000	7585000	That hasn't.
7585000	7588000	That hasn't stopped me in 15 years.
7588000	7589000	This.
7589000	7592000	I don't know how to pronounce it.
7592000	7595000	Uta Waru Monozon.
7595000	7597000	Uta Waru Monozon.
7597000	7598000	All right.
7598000	7599000	That's that'll work.
7599000	7600000	Sure.
7600000	7601000	Why not?
7602000	7603000	Yeah.
7603000	7605000	It's it's it's the thing.
7605000	7607000	Speaking of beat him up games.
7607000	7611000	While we've been out that River City Girls came out and I got to check that out at some
7611000	7612000	point.
7612000	7614000	I was watching some let's plays of that and that looks fun.
7614000	7617000	So I'm just throwing that out there.
7617000	7619000	One of the big games I'm looking forward to this week.
7619000	7623000	Borderlands 3 coming on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
7623000	7626000	Damon X Machina on Nintendo Switch.
7626000	7630000	And last but not least, NHL 20 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
7630000	7631000	All right.
7631000	7633000	Well, that game actually looks kind of good.
7633000	7637000	Traveling over to Japan and checking out the releases over there because butchering Japanese
7637000	7639000	names hasn't stopped me in the history of this show.
7639000	7645000	And every time Akuma JP is here, he's like crying because for me is butchering all this
7645000	7646000	stuff.
7646000	7649000	But actually, the releases I have on PS4 this week have pretty English names.
7649000	7655000	These are not or these these are difficult to screw up.
7655000	7659000	Konami is releasing E Football winning 11 2020 in Japan this week.
7659000	7660000	So there is that.
7660000	7664000	And then Lethal League Blaze is another game that is coming out this week.
7664000	7667000	Again, both those releases in Japan on the 12th.
7667000	7671000	Going over to the Nintendo Switch and seeing what's coming out over there.
7671000	7675000	Lethal League Blaze is also released on the Nintendo Switch and then a game called Amnesia.
7675000	7680000	Is that the scary game coming out on Nintendo Switch?
7680000	7681000	Because it's called.
7681000	7682000	No, it's not.
7682000	7683000	No, it's different.
7683000	7684000	Amnesia.
7684000	7685000	OK, that's why I had to look.
7685000	7690000	It is a port of the December 2013 PS Vita title Amnesia.
7690000	7693000	I don't know if that's Amnesia five or Amnesia V edition.
7693000	7696000	It is a memory loss suspense mystery game.
7696000	7702000	So I it looks like it's like a graphic novel or I would say more graphic novel than anime.
7702000	7706000	But yeah, it's I like the art actually on the cover.
7706000	7711000	It's like this character holding like this white rose and like surrounded with these
7711000	7713000	cards and interesting patterns.
7713000	7714000	Kind of kind of cool.
7714000	7716000	Yeah, I think it's a pixel pockets is probably a visual novel.
7716000	7717000	I tend to agree.
7717000	7722000	So not to be confused with the scary game Amnesia here in the States.
7722000	7723000	It could be the same.
7723000	7724000	You never know.
7724000	7725000	It could have been.
7725000	7726000	Yeah, why not?
7726000	7728000	Why not a version of that on Switch?
7728000	7731000	Let's go over to the UK and dark soccer.
7731000	7733000	This patch of games are on the ninth.
7733000	7740000	We have Pool Nation for PS4 goat simulator, the goatee on Switch.
7740000	7742000	And it's GOATY.
7742000	7744000	I don't know what the Y is standing for.
7744000	7745000	I know what the goat is.
7745000	7746000	Game of the year.
7746000	7747000	Goat of the year.
7747000	7749000	Greatest of all time.
7749000	7750000	Yo.
7750000	7752000	Yo.
7752000	7754000	Greatest of all the years.
7754000	7755000	Maybe.
7755000	7759000	Greed Fall on Xbox and PlayStation.
7759000	7761000	The Walking Dead, the Telltale Definitive Series.
7761000	7767000	We have E Football PES 2020, which is real football and not this crap in America.
7767000	7769000	We have Gears 5.
7769000	7770000	What?
7770000	7772000	I just.
7772000	7774000	Sometimes your shade makes me laugh.
7774000	7775000	It's OK, right?
7775000	7776000	Do you know what?
7776000	7777000	OK.
7777000	7781000	Do you know that I will say this one thing about Dragon Con that I noticed.
7781000	7783000	Sorry, I'm I'm in a tangent mood tonight.
7783000	7784000	We've been gone for so long.
7784000	7785000	OK, not.
7785000	7786000	Here's the thing.
7786000	7794000	I've noticed how much straight culture has appropriated fans because like and I feel
7794000	7797000	like when you do shade, you need a thing to go through because I.
7797000	7798000	OK, here's the thing.
7798000	7805000	I went to the LGBT dance party that they do every year, Spectrum, and the music at Spectrum,
7805000	7806000	not doing it for me.
7806000	7811000	Like when I go to the LGBT event at Dragon Con, you know what I expect to hear?
7811000	7817000	Britney Spears, Sia, the Spice Girls, which I heard at the Zombie Prom, but I didn't hear
7817000	7818000	it at Spectrum.
7818000	7823000	You know, I expect to hear icons and that type of thing, not this club kid rave music
7823000	7825000	thing they've played every single year.
7825000	7831000	So me and my new friend I met at Dragon Con and we became fast friends because of all
7831000	7836000	the people in the universe, of the 85,000 people at Dragon Con, I, by coincidence, meet
7836000	7839000	the other guy who plays Survivor games online.
7839000	7845000	So we became fast friends and we went instead and him and his roommate, we went from the
7845000	7846000	Spectrum party.
7846000	7849000	We went to the Heroes and Villains Ball, which is what the video game track does.
7849000	7852000	And it's it's a really big to do production.
7852000	7855000	And it's, you know, it's the more traditional dance party.
7855000	7861000	It was a lot of, dude, they had pyrotechnics, like fucking sparks would shoot from the stage
7861000	7862000	and shit.
7862000	7863000	And I was like, is this legal?
7863000	7864000	Who cares?
7864000	7865000	You know, we were having fun.
7865000	7869000	But I would notice when the when the music and the music they were playing was much better,
7869000	7873000	when the music would have this flat that that that people like the girls were getting out
7873000	7877000	their fans, black, black, black, black, and they would like black in unison.
7877000	7879000	And I was like, hey, wait a minute.
7879000	7881000	Hey, wait a minute.
7881000	7885000	You know, you stole that from drag queens who in turn stole it from somebody else, I'm
7885000	7886000	sure.
7886000	7889000	One of my friends was there, actually, who's also a sister.
7889000	7890000	Yeah.
7890000	7892000	So much extra.
7892000	7895000	I should have I should have had eighty five thousand people.
7895000	7896000	No, I know.
7896000	7900000	I should have, though, had some of the sisters out there say hi or something.
7900000	7902000	But they're all wonderful people.
7902000	7905000	Just I'm sure I did not see anyone dressed up like a nun, for what it's worth.
7905000	7908000	No, I think I think that Soma was there in drag.
7908000	7912000	I have to ask and make sure, because I know that she posted something about Drag Con,
7912000	7914000	but I'll have to check.
7914000	7919000	Anyway, on the 10th, we have No Man's Sky Beyond.
7919000	7922000	On the 11th, Modern Warfare PS4 Beta.
7922000	7926000	On the 12th, we have Borderlands 3.
7926000	7932000	Damon Ex Machina, NHL 20, Star Wars Pinball.
7932000	7935000	And that's it for that week.
7935000	7939000	Tiger, I'm not sure if this is I'm not sure if this is like pro or anti what I just said,
7939000	7942000	but I do want to respond to what Tiger was saying in chat, saying as someone who listens
7942000	7946000	to electronic music, the EDM they've been playing sounds so cheesy and soulless to me,
7946000	7950000	like the people who made this music is just capitalizing on what's popular with the kids
7950000	7951000	these days.
7951000	7954000	Like, I don't I don't really know the genre of music I was listening to at that party.
7954000	7955000	It just wasn't good.
7955000	7956000	And here's the thing.
7956000	7958000	I like a lot of electronic music, actually.
7958000	7961000	Like, I love my melodic trance playlist on Spotify.
7961000	7966000	So, you know, I have a feeling the type of music is not what they were playing.
7966000	7969000	It's just it was just like it was circuit party stuff.
7969000	7971000	You know, it's the stuff that people are twirling flags and things.
7971000	7974000	It's just it wasn't it's not what I wanted.
7974000	7980000	You know what? Stop with the stereotype and just make it fun and glittery.
7980000	7983000	Lots of glitter, lots of fun, lots of balloons.
7983000	7987000	That was a big big balloons were these big balls that were being bounced around.
7987000	7989000	It's like I'd be dancing and then all of a sudden.
7989000	7992000	Now, which is fucking think of disco.
7992000	7994000	Have yourself a mirror ball.
7994000	7998000	Yeah. Have yourself some some Donna Summer and back.
7998000	8000000	Yes. Where was the Donna Summer at?
8000000	8001000	Right. Yeah. There you go.
8001000	8006000	You know what? You know what? You know what we if I can make it to Dragon Con,
8006000	8011000	I'm going to talk to my sisters out there and we'll see about having a ball.
8011000	8015000	Category is cosplay realness.
8015000	8016000	Oh, my God.
8016000	8018000	Dark soccer. You're a genius.
8018000	8023000	Why is there not a cosplay ball at Dragon Con?
8023000	8025000	There is and I just don't know where category.
8025000	8030000	Instead of having a masquerade or any of that, you have the cosplay ball.
8030000	8034000	You have it. You know, category wig, fighting, fighting.
8034000	8037000	Like I'm just like, this needs to be a thing at Dragon Con.
8037000	8043000	Absolutely. You also have to have casual gamer realness.
8043000	8046000	You know, where it's like the girls who wear their son,
8046000	8048000	their Han Solo outfits, you know, because it's fall.
8048000	8051000	You carry around the pumpkin spice lattes, but they've got glasses on.
8051000	8055000	The only thing I'm worried about with doing that is that people would feel like it's extremely appropriated.
8055000	8059000	So I do think we if something like that were to happen,
8059000	8063000	there just needs to be some sort of way to make sure that it's done respectfully.
8063000	8068000	It would be different, though, if we got the Atlanta sisters involved.
8068000	8072000	So that way you bring it in for charity as well.
8072000	8076000	You have the ball for charity. Part of the proceeds go to the con.
8076000	8080000	Part of the proceeds go to the sisters to give to LGBT charities.
8080000	8082000	Sorry, I'm screaming at this conversation.
8082000	8084000	And I have to say the ball.
8084000	8087000	SSU 100 Matt is like, Loki is lost in this conversation.
8087000	8089000	I'm laughing my ass off because Loki's over there.
8089000	8093000	I'm just programming.
8093000	8097000	I'm just excluded from the conversation.
8098000	8101000	First time in a unity engine butch realness.
8103000	8105000	All right, moving on.
8106000	8108000	Let's move on. What the fuck is our next topic?
8108000	8110000	I don't even know anywhere. I have to look up there.
8110000	8112000	Actually, you know what, though?
8112000	8113000	What?
8113000	8115000	We could do something like that here. We'll talk later.
8115000	8118000	Okay, let's talk later, because I just know I am.
8118000	8119000	How about some email?
8119000	8121000	No, I'm sorry. I am all about this.
8121000	8122000	Like, this is a genius idea.
8122000	8124000	Because I'm smart.
8124000	8125000	Once in a while.
8125000	8128000	Girl, please. I am smart all the time.
8128000	8129000	You just don't listen.
8129000	8130000	Respectfully. You're right.
8130000	8134000	We need to involve the right people to make sure that it is not a parody of itself.
8134000	8138000	That it is legit and pays respect to the people who brought this culture to us.
8138000	8139000	Absolutely.
8139000	8142000	So, I'll reach out to my sisters out there.
8142000	8144000	I'm on pretty good terms with...
8144000	8148000	I mean, I met a few of them in person because they were out here for Conclave.
8148000	8149000	So, I'll reach out.
8149000	8150000	Yeah.
8150000	8153000	Instead of having this bullshit balloon party...
8153000	8154000	Well, they can have that too.
8154000	8156000	Just call it the bullshit balloon party.
8156000	8160000	I'm always for more, more, more, instead of replace, replace, replace.
8160000	8161000	You know?
8161000	8163000	So, they can have the bullshit party.
8163000	8164000	That's right. Yes.
8164000	8166000	The bullshit balloon party is what it's going to be called.
8166000	8167000	But I'm going to the ball.
8167000	8168000	But we're having the ball.
8168000	8169000	Alright. Anyway.
8169000	8170000	The cosplay ball.
8170000	8171000	The cosplay ball.
8171000	8173000	Anyway, it's just so good.
8173000	8174000	Anyway, moving on.
8174000	8175000	I'm smart. Anyway.
8175000	8176000	Mailbag.
8176000	8181000	Hello, Alar. Thanks for the little pre-recorded show that you made a few weeks back.
8182000	8187000	I just wanted to toss in a thought about the Saturn import question posed by one of the listeners.
8187000	8191000	If you haven't already found one, look for a little cartridge called an Action Replay 4M+.
8191000	8194000	I have a couple of them. Just sayin'.
8195000	8197000	It wears a few different hats.
8197000	8199000	It lets you play import games without needing a mod chip.
8199000	8202000	It acts as a backup memory for your saved games.
8202000	8210000	It also acts as a RAM expansion cart for games that require it, such as Vampire Saver, Marvel Super Heroes, and Street Fighter, some King of Fighters games and others.
8210000	8211000	I'm going to throw in an anecdote.
8211000	8215000	You need the one that's got the switch on it that switches it between 4 and 1 meg cart.
8215000	8221000	Because the KOF games do not play nice with, or the SNK games do not play nice with the 4 meg cart.
8221000	8222000	Just sayin'.
8223000	8225000	It vastly improves your Saturn owning experience.
8225000	8226000	You really ought to grab one.
8226000	8229000	They can be had on eBay for under $40.
8229000	8231000	You might be able to find them at other places too.
8231000	8233000	The only thing they don't let you do is play burns.
8233000	8235000	So, just saying.
8235000	8236000	I'll end with this.
8236000	8245000	While I'm greatly appreciative that you would entrust me with this extremely valuable President Cat IP, I'm not quite sure that I'm best equipped to handle it.
8245000	8250000	Actually, I'm terrified that I would not live up to the cat, the myth, the legend that is President Cat.
8250000	8255000	So, thanks, but I'm going to keep plaguing away at my projects over here that I'm about to delay again.
8255000	8257000	Babies are so time consuming.
8257000	8261000	I say this as I turn back to Forza Horizon 4 yet again because this game is digital crack.
8261000	8262000	Oh well.
8262000	8264000	Warm regards, Aaron YYR.
8264000	8266000	A humble and respectful declination.
8266000	8268000	But don't forget about Vectords.
8268000	8270000	Yeah, don't forget about Vectords though.
8270000	8272000	Vectords needs to happen.
8272000	8273000	Alright.
8273000	8275000	So, would it be done in the style of like Vectrex?
8275000	8276000	Yes.
8276000	8280000	Not necessarily Vectrex, but like, uh, what the hell is that game?
8280000	8281000	Tempest.
8281000	8285000	Tempest or I was thinking of like, um, God, they had him accuse her.
8285000	8288000	I'm trying to think, what the hell was that tank game?
8288000	8289000	Oh, fuck.
8289000	8290000	No, I'm thinking something like-
8290000	8291000	Battlezone?
8291000	8292000	Not Battlezone.
8292000	8293000	I know what you mean though.
8293000	8294000	Maybe Battlezone.
8294000	8296000	But I'm thinking something like Tempest.
8296000	8297000	TMEC.
8297000	8298000	Like TMEC.
8298000	8299000	Yeah, TMEC.
8299000	8300000	But I want something like Tempest.
8300000	8305000	Where all the turds are coming at you and you have to dodge the Vectords or else they
8305000	8306000	shit on you.
8306000	8308000	Let the man raise his baby.
8308000	8310000	But, but, this is good influence.
8310000	8311000	You know what though?
8311000	8315000	There is another person in this room that can make games, not necessarily finish them,
8315000	8317000	but can start making games.
8317000	8320000	You know, I would have if you haven't finished one.
8320000	8321000	I was about to read you and you, you, you.
8321000	8322000	Okay, good for you.
8322000	8327000	If you would finish one, I would actually even give you an entire pizza.
8330000	8331000	If, okay.
8331000	8332000	It'll be fucking gluten free or some shit.
8332000	8333000	You don't want that.
8333000	8334000	Fuck that.
8334000	8335000	If, okay.
8335000	8342000	If Loki finishes his game on the show, I will buy him the pizza of his choice.
8342000	8344000	The, the quadruple bacon pizza.
8344000	8345000	I will buy you-
8345000	8346000	That's too much bacon.
8346000	8347000	Triple bacon pizza.
8347000	8353000	I will buy you whatever pizza you want and garlic twists.
8353000	8355000	Rob will help me.
8355000	8357000	All right.
8357000	8358000	All right, Bobby.
8358000	8361000	It has to be finished this, this year.
8361000	8362000	Okay.
8362000	8363000	Okay.
8363000	8364000	This year.
8364000	8368000	You have to the end of the year for pizza and we're going to call this contest, which
8368000	8371000	only has one contestant.
8371000	8373000	Time to pizza.
8374000	8375000	All right.
8375000	8376000	I like it.
8376000	8377000	Time to pizza.
8377000	8378000	It has one contestant.
8378000	8379000	This guy's got one contestant.
8379000	8380000	There's one contestant in this contest.
8380000	8382000	I have a good shot of winning this one.
8382000	8384000	So you're saying I have a chance.
8384000	8385000	I have a chance.
8385000	8389000	So you have at least a 50% chance of winning.
8389000	8391000	You either do it or you don't.
8391000	8394000	There is no try.
8394000	8395000	And maybe-
8395000	8397000	Maybe I'll make you a blanket, Loki.
8397000	8400000	I'll ask Jordan what, what, what, what.
8400000	8401000	If-
8401000	8402000	Online coverage.
8402000	8403000	If-
8403000	8404000	Online company he uses.
8404000	8409000	If time to pizza is successful, I will open up time to pizza for the listeners.
8409000	8412000	Girl, that's a big, oh, that's a big order.
8412000	8419000	And whoever does a game worthy of getting the OLR stamp of approval on it one game next
8419000	8421000	year, I will buy you a pizza.
8421000	8422000	All right.
8422000	8424000	I will have it delivered to your house.
8424000	8425000	I'm serious.
8425000	8431000	Do you, do you know what I was told by somebody on one of those panels?
8431000	8436000	I'm sorry, I forget who, but apparently I think it was, I think, uh, Bobby, were you
8436000	8437000	there?
8437000	8440000	Was it the girl that was in the too many cooks thing?
8440000	8444000	Cause you know, we had a girl from the too many cooks video on one of our panels.
8444000	8445000	That's awesome.
8445000	8449000	And I think she was mentioning that you have, you have a plugin that you can put in on Twitch
8449000	8453000	and you can, Oh God, I almost, I almost don't want to finish this because dark soccer is
8453000	8455000	going to immediately go, we're fucking doing it.
8455000	8458000	I'm already thinking we're going to do it, whatever it is.
8458000	8464000	You can actually install a thing where the viewers can buy you Uber eats and have it
8464000	8469000	delivered to you, but they never see your address because it's through the plugin.
8469000	8473000	So they just do it through the plugin and have you like actually like shit, I don't
8473000	8474000	want random garbage.
8474000	8475000	It's like, no, no.
8475000	8480000	You have like a list of like your preferred dishes and they just choose what it is.
8480000	8482000	But do you have to activate it if you're like actually hungry?
8482000	8483000	I don't know.
8483000	8487000	I didn't actually research this cause I didn't think we were actually going to do it because
8487000	8488000	I thought I would do it on my channel.
8488000	8491000	I thought it would be smart enough to not mention it here on the show.
8491000	8492000	Whoops.
8492000	8494000	I'm going to do it on my channel.
8494000	8496000	When I go up, y'all can feed me.
8496000	8501000	I mean, I have the stomach the size of like an apple, but y'all can feed me.
8501000	8503000	I like Korean food.
8503000	8507000	Now that the words are leaving my mouth, I'm like, Oh my God, can you imagine if we had
8507000	8509000	that button on this show?
8509000	8512000	Dark soccer is like, I want a taco.
8512000	8513000	Bing dong.
8513000	8514000	Taco.
8514000	8516000	Anyway, back to time to pizza.
8516000	8517000	Okay.
8517000	8518000	Cause I'm forming this right now.
8518000	8519000	Okay.
8519000	8520000	We're the only contestant in this.
8520000	8521000	Do you see my finger on the thing?
8521000	8523000	Yes, but it's two, two and a half hours in girl.
8523000	8525000	We got to finish the show.
8525000	8526000	Okay.
8526000	8528000	This year, you're the only contestant next year.
8528000	8530000	Top 10 entries.
8530000	8537000	I will consider one and December of next year, the winner gets a pizza because I'm a cheap
8537000	8538000	bitch.
8538000	8539000	That's at least 25 bucks.
8539000	8540000	All right.
8540000	8541000	Do we have another email?
8541000	8542000	Fuck no.
8542000	8543000	All right.
8543000	8544000	I have breaking news.
8544000	8545000	You ready?
8545000	8549000	I would argue this is better than pizza, but you're probably going to disagree.
8549000	8552000	It's it's a text message from Shane and shouldn't those be treasured.
8552000	8558000	And he's actually in chat, uh, and said, check your phone when Shane was the one who said,
8558000	8562000	I shouldn't be checking my phone while doing OLR, but here I am because he said so, but
8562000	8563000	this is important.
8563000	8568560	Um, I don't know if you said in your show already, but just announced crystal Chronicles
8568560	8577040	is January 23rd with cross platform support for PS4, switch iOS, and Android girl.
8577040	8578040	Cool.
8578040	8579040	That's cool.
8579040	8580040	Good.
8580040	8583040	I, that cross platform on a game like that is a game changer.
8583040	8587120	You had to clip that time to pizza.
8587120	8589280	I love the clipping system on Twitch.
8589280	8590280	It's wonderful.
8590280	8591280	Keep me honest.
8591280	8598280	I will get somebody a pizza, but it has, I do have a few criteria because I am a weirdo.
8598720	8603200	And you have to be able to frame it in something that's going to be quirky enough for us to
8603200	8609640	go, damn, you know, we have to be all right, let's cross the bridge of contestant number
8609640	8613680	one finishing, and then we'll worry about unlight unloading it on the masses and the
8613680	8618040	specifics of how that works because then when I talk about giveaways, there's going to be,
8618040	8621720	there's going to be the Bobby Black Wolf on my shoulder that says, that says, give away
8621720	8622720	laws.
8622720	8624640	We've got to be careful what we're doing.
8624640	8626640	This is me buying someone a pizza.
8626640	8627640	Okay.
8628280	8633040	I just have a criteria moving on next story, please.
8633040	8634040	Loki.
8635040	8636040	All right.
8636040	8641360	Uh, so there's a new plants versus zombies game that's, uh, coming out and now let's
8641360	8642360	be clear.
8642360	8647720	This is not necessarily a new plants versus zombies puzzle game, but it's, you know, they're
8647720	8650200	plants versus zombies, garden warfare type of game.
8650200	8653520	So they have one now it's called battle for the neighborhood.
8653520	8660400	It is a third person shooter, and of course they have now, um, different co-op units and
8660400	8664800	there's free roam areas as well as an interactive social hub.
8664800	8673480	Apparently you can play it now on PC, PlayStation four or Xbox one, and they have new characters.
8673480	8679380	So three new characters, two co-op classes, um, and you can team up and battle together
8679380	8681120	with other people.
8681120	8685960	And then of course, uh, free roam maps, as I mentioned before, and some amusement park
8685960	8688560	themed stuff as well.
8688560	8693520	And I think this is a, I want, I thought this was a free to play game, but they also have
8693520	8696680	a founder's edition, which is 29 99.
8696680	8701840	Free to play stuff usually has founders packs that are like, you get extras stuff in the
8701840	8704240	game because you're an early supporter.
8704240	8705240	Yeah.
8705240	8709960	So, um, yeah, so they also have a non founders version of the game is going to cost 10 bucks
8709960	8711200	as well.
8711200	8713920	Um, it looks okay.
8713920	8718120	I never really played the second or first game of this.
8718120	8723000	I know I have it in my library from one of those free PlayStation plus months, but I
8723000	8724000	don't know.
8724000	8729680	I just, I'm worried of any EA game, especially if it has microtransactions in it, but I don't
8729680	8730680	know.
8730680	8731680	It looks cute.
8731680	8734680	It's nice to see that the plans versus zombie franchise is still going, even though it's
8734680	8738080	not really the puzzle game it used to be, but the shooter game was cute.
8738080	8739080	It was a free game.
8739120	8742680	The other one was like a free download on Xbox at some point and I checked it out.
8742680	8743680	It was cute.
8743680	8744680	Yeah.
8744680	8745680	It looks great.
8745680	8746680	Shooters go.
8746680	8747680	So yeah, I'm glad, I'm glad it's still going.
8747680	8748680	I'm sure that's someone's cup of tea.
8748680	8749680	Yep.
8749680	8750680	All right.
8750680	8752540	Moving on to another, uh, discord submitted story for this week.
8752540	8757040	This one from dungeon buster actually sent us this story about, and it's from the guardian,
8757040	8760200	which is kind of a, I think it's bigger in the UK, but this was actually the guardian's
8760200	8761200	us edition.
8761200	8766240	Um, and this is a story about, Oh boy, it's does loot boxes lead to gambling
8766240	8774080	but I'm sure this is being presented to us because of the fact that here is a larger
8774080	8776920	media site, you know, and the angle that they're taking on it.
8776920	8782160	Well, I want to see what they say, but I have a thing to add to that too, to how it is.
8782160	8783160	Sure.
8783160	8787560	Um, and this is a story again, the guardian is reporting this about a gentleman named
8787560	8788560	Nate.
8788560	8791160	Nate, I'm not going to read the whole story for you guys, but, um, Adam Bradford is the
8791160	8793680	kind of the subject of the story and the father David.
8794400	8798640	And I guess what was happening is that the, the father was jailed for two years for stealing
8798640	8803960	from employers to fund a compulsive online gaming habit, which is like, and then showed
8803960	8805320	up in all the papers.
8805320	8808320	So Adam was quoted in the story saying we were devastated because we didn't know what
8808320	8809900	a gambling addiction really was.
8809900	8815280	And so he made this organization called a safer online gambling group.
8815280	8819280	And they're saying that basically the addiction was a psychological problem, it needed treatment
8819280	8820280	and so forth.
8820280	8823280	And then they talk about kind of like how it was portrayed in the media about like,
8823280	8825440	you know, he was just an addict and all this stuff.
8825440	8830960	Um, but, uh, the point about this is because this, this forum that they created this club,
8830960	8834320	they created the safer online gambling group, a SOG.
8834320	8837060	It looks like it says soggy, but it's SOG.
8837060	8843520	So SOG made this and they launched a campaign, this SOG organization, tackling what happens
8843520	8849000	to children and what they are saying is a link between gambling and gaming because of
8849000	8850480	loot boxes.
8850480	8854980	And of course, as we all know, loot boxes are the in game rewards and so forth.
8854980	8859240	And Adam, one of the founders of this says it's a game of chance as to whether or not
8859240	8862560	you're going to get a better weapon or a better player or extra points.
8862560	8865000	Um, odds are not disclosed.
8865000	8867240	That's why we're comparing it to gambling.
8867240	8871660	And then they're saying that this simulated gambling leads to betting for children.
8871660	8876240	One more quote here from the older one that was in jail for the gambling, David, uh, gambling
8876240	8879700	and gaming have been neighbors divided by a brick wall.
8879700	8881820	But now there's a gateway in it.
8881820	8884800	And I don't think that gateway is being policed.
8884800	8888340	Now I don't see anywhere in this article, unless it comes up much later, but it doesn't
8888340	8892460	talk about what's happening, um, in the U S with Nintendo.
8892460	8893460	Yeah.
8893460	8897920	I don't see the Nintendo Microsoft PlayStation Alliance, you know, about how they're going
8897920	8900060	to force the disclosure in the stores.
8900060	8902020	That's not mentioned in here.
8902020	8905420	Um, surprised they didn't do the research or whatever.
8905420	8906420	What's the date.
8906420	8908460	I want to make sure this article has a recent date on it.
8908620	8909860	Yeah. Third of September.
8909860	8911220	So it was just from this last week.
8911220	8914660	Yeah. So you want to talk about bad timing on the part of the games industry.
8914660	8918540	So you know how there's this whole thing where they're investigating, you know, kind of ties
8918540	8920460	between loot boxes and gambling and stuff like that.
8921340	8927140	So what's a company like take two you say going to do in their brand new sports game to
8927340	8929820	help make sure that that line isn't crossed.
8930340	8932980	Oh, I know. Let's put fucking gambling in the game.
8932980	8935700	So they literally have in their loot boxes.
8936380	8938180	It's a fucking slot machine.
8938580	8941140	Mind you that the game is rated E for everyone.
8941140	8947300	It's a fucking slot machine that you have to pull that they literally like simulates
8947300	8950940	pulling a slot machine to see what fucking player card you're going.
8951100	8954500	They had a whole trailer dedicated to the goddamn loot boxes.
8954780	8956220	I do. I do remember seeing that trailer.
8956340	8958060	Like what the fuck is wrong with you?
8958060	8959940	Stupid idiots. I mean, like you're right.
8959940	8961780	That is why we have this.
8961780	8966180	And as much as we want to sit here and say these guys are well, I don't know.
8966180	8969540	I don't know if I want to sit here and say these guys are full of it because we haven't
8969540	8971380	really been on this.
8971380	8973620	Like, I don't really love the loot box thing.
8973620	8977660	And I think, yeah, they need to disclose the odds on all this stuff and those loot boxes.
8977820	8981020	Although what I don't want, I don't want to see the loot boxes regulated by the
8981020	8984980	government because I don't necessarily trust our government to regulate things correctly.
8984980	8987700	That's just the reality of the year we live in in twenty nineteen.
8987980	8994180	So I would prefer that the, you know, the publishers and the storefronts, which to be
8994220	8995460	fair, they did.
8995460	8998900	And that was the big, you know, kind of footnote we had a couple of weeks ago was that,
8998900	9002340	you know, Nintendo and Microsoft and Sony are going to address this on their end and
9002340	9004420	they're going to do something within the stores to regulate it.
9004540	9008780	So hopefully the government doesn't feel the need to step in and regulate it, because
9008780	9014380	unfortunately, when you've got what Take-Two is doing, it plays right into this.
9014900	9015860	And so.
9016940	9022660	Yeah, and to clarify, you don't win money with the slot machine, but the fact is that
9022860	9026260	they keep comparing loot boxes with the random chance to get something.
9026260	9030580	And yes, it's not necessarily money and you're not necessarily spending real money
9031660	9036220	for that, but you're you're spending real money to buy fake money to spend on the, you
9036220	9038180	know, the random chance to get something.
9038580	9042860	But the problem is, though, is they've been trying to say, well, it's not, you know,
9042860	9048460	exactly the same as gambling because, you know, there's it's not really going through
9048460	9050260	the same motions as gambling.
9050260	9055860	It's kind of like a random loop, you know, like random surprise egg or something like
9055860	9060420	that. But then you make it look like a casino game and that's the problem.
9060420	9062380	It's like, OK, well, you can't use that excuse.
9062380	9065620	Well, it doesn't it's not it's not teaching kids how to gamble.
9065740	9068660	It's fucking teaching them how to play a slot machine.
9068660	9070100	I mean, that's I get it.
9070100	9075660	You're winning the loot cards and stuff they have, but the cards have different values
9075660	9079860	to them because you're paying money to try to get a chance to get these cards.
9079900	9086180	It's that would be like saying that, like, if I go and buy, you know, a Magic the
9086180	9090260	Gathering pack or something like that and there's a rare card in there, that rare card
9090260	9092940	has value because you could technically sell it.
9093660	9097940	Granted, in this game, you can't sell any of the stuff that you get in these loot boxes,
9097940	9102300	but that's kind of they're basically writing the line as much as they can.
9102900	9106740	Let me read this very honest comment here from SSJ100Matt in our chat room at
9106740	9108060	twitch.tv slash VOG Network.
9108260	9112660	SSJ100Matt says, I used to buy ultimate team card packs for the NHL franchise.
9112900	9117140	I once spent two hundred and fifty dollars just on these card packs in an NHL game.
9117420	9120860	The ultimate team structure is set up that in order for you to have a good team, you
9120860	9122660	need to spend money to get better players.
9122860	9125140	If you don't, you fall behind and have a trash team.
9125300	9127460	I realize this, but I kept putting money into it.
9127460	9130660	Why? Because I was addicted to it and wanted to have a better team.
9130860	9134620	I've stopped playing that mode years ago when I realized it wasn't worth it.
9134940	9141460	So some very real, harsh, true feedback from our chat about how, you know,
9141460	9145780	sometimes this maybe that desire, the competitive edge, that desire for
9145780	9149620	competition, like drives us to spend a lot of money.
9149620	9152580	And they know that more than I care to admit on Pokemon Go.
9152780	9155620	At least I don't feel like I'm gambling, like I know what I'm buying.
9155620	9161340	But at the same time, you know, it is kind of when you throw the balls at the raid
9161340	9162980	things, there's no guarantee you're going to catch it.
9163020	9165300	Shinies are a random chance as well, right?
9165900	9169620	Right. Well, they know, though, like when they're designing games, they create a
9169620	9173460	problem that they then also create the solution for with these loot boxes or in
9173460	9177620	game purchases. You know, like they have a lot of games where you can buy XP
9177620	9180060	bonus or XP boosts or whatever.
9180380	9184580	They purposely slow down the XP in the game so that you want to buy those XP
9184580	9188620	boosts. That's why. And they say it's just, you know, well, it's we're giving you the
9188620	9190860	opportunity to do that. You don't have to do that.
9190860	9194980	But yes, they're forcing you in the direction or they're trying to prod you in
9194980	9198980	the right direction for them, because that's how they're designing the game.
9198980	9202420	They have to balance it around that, just like when, for example, they removed the
9202420	9205260	loot boxes from that Lord of the Rings game.
9205460	9209500	They had to rebalance the whole game because while they said, oh, the loot boxes
9209500	9212980	don't really affect the gameplay, they did affect the gameplay and they had to
9212980	9216380	rebalance the whole game in order for it to feel right after they removed the loot
9216380	9217900	boxes. All right.
9218060	9221860	So anyway, just to just to kind of wrap this up so we can move on.
9221860	9226420	So our show isn't too long tonight, but it just goes to show that, you know, despite
9226420	9230300	the fact that we have the Microsoft Nintendo Sony news about the storefronts, this
9230300	9231820	issue still is not over.
9231820	9234980	This article that got linked to us in Discord is still from this week.
9235180	9237380	This is a conversation that is still continuing.
9237540	9241020	This trailer that you talked about from Take Two is still very recent.
9241020	9244460	So this issue not on the other side of it yet.
9244500	9247740	So this is something the gaming industry really has to think about how they're going
9247740	9251500	to tackle. Anyway, in the interest of time, we're going to move on to our next story,
9251500	9252620	which is from Dark Sakura.
9253500	9254700	EA won an award.
9255180	9256860	They won a Guinness World Record.
9257300	9262660	You know what for? For having the most downvoted comment in Reddit history.
9263420	9269900	Yep. And also it was ironically the record for the 2020 Guinness book was also posted
9269900	9271500	on Reddit. So, yay.
9272500	9280940	But anyway, the comment, sorry, had 683,000 downvotes.
9281580	9282860	And this was the comment.
9282860	9285580	I'm going to read it and everyone will go, oh, that?
9287580	9289540	And this was about Star Wars Battlefront.
9290340	9294620	The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment from unlocking
9294620	9295820	different heroes. Yep.
9295860	9297300	You guessed it, it's loot boxes.
9298020	9303620	As for costs, we selected initial values based upon data from the open beta and adjustments
9303620	9305420	made to milestone rewards before launch.
9305660	9310420	Among other things, we're looking at average per player credit earn rates on a daily basis
9310420	9313820	and would be making constant adjustments to ensure that players have challenges that are
9313820	9317180	compelling, rewarding and, of course, attainable via gameplay.
9317500	9321620	We appreciate the candid feedback and the passion the community has put forth around the
9321620	9325220	current topics here on Reddit, our forums and across numerous social media outlets.
9325460	9328940	Our team will continue to make changes and monitor community feedback and update, blah,
9328940	9335620	blah, blah. Anyways, so, yeah, it was regarding having to unlock characters like Darth
9335620	9340940	Vader and Luke Skywalker in Star Wars Battlefront 2 in 2017 through loot boxes.
9341620	9345300	Yep. Not surprised to hear that that was the winner.
9345300	9347980	Well, I remember talking about was the most downvoted comment in Reddit history at the
9347980	9352140	time. But now the fact that, like, the Guinness World Record book has, like, certified,
9352140	9355020	like, wow, your comment was sucky.
9355220	9361140	Like the fact that that is like, here's this piece of paper from Guinness acknowledging
9361300	9362980	you wrote a dumb thing.
9363540	9364780	You did a stupid.
9365180	9366540	You did a stupid thing.
9366540	9368140	Congratulations, EA.
9368380	9369860	You win at sucking.
9371300	9377620	There's just some type of like very sad satisfaction coming out of that.
9377620	9380020	There is an absolute sad trombone moment.
9380020	9383660	How hard is it? How much does it cost to get Guinness to, like, certify something?
9383980	9388580	Like, should we try to see if we really are the longest running, like, video game show
9388580	9390140	Internet thing? I don't know what we'd call it.
9390380	9395700	I know. I know. But, like, you know, the having the actual Guinness name behind it, I
9395700	9398540	could put that on the fucking banner world record holder.
9398540	9399580	I'll look into it.
9399740	9400820	Yeah, look into it.
9401100	9402740	With all the other things I'm looking into.
9402740	9404180	Can you bring that to the next meeting?
9406620	9408620	You better invest in the good coffee.
9409820	9412220	Farina, we just bought. I got pumpkin spice coffee.
9412220	9413140	That is the good coffee.
9413140	9415260	Girl, I brought you basic bitch cookies.
9415460	9416540	I suggest you eat one.
9416540	9418700	I will eat one. I might eat one later after the credits.
9418700	9420580	All right. I want to know what you think.
9420940	9424780	I know I might eat one after the credits, but I had Panda Express earlier, so I'm still
9424780	9424940	like.
9424940	9426580	I had Panda Express earlier too.
9426580	9428020	I know. We're on the same wavelength.
9428020	9430660	All right. Anyway, next story.
9430980	9436620	Loki, this this this involves another host here at the Voice of the Geeks network, right?
9436860	9438460	Yeah. So it's an inside joke.
9438460	9439460	It's not. Yeah.
9439620	9446980	So Kojima mentioned that he is incorporating a very easy mode into Death Stranding.
9447420	9453260	So basically, this would be kind of geared towards like Bobby Black Wolf.
9453740	9454220	Maybe.
9455580	9459860	He basically said, you know, normally there is only an easy mode, but we added a very
9459860	9466100	easy mode for movie fans, since we have real actors like Norman Reedus, Mads Mikkelsen,
9466100	9473820	and Lea Sido starred in, even though even Yano-san, who never completed the first stage
9473820	9477660	of Pac-Man, was able to complete the game on very easy mode.
9479740	9483340	So they have normal or hard mode for action game fans.
9483340	9487420	So, you know, accessibility is not bad, especially with a game that's like very
9489140	9490220	cinematic like this.
9490220	9493500	I mean, I could see how some people just may not want to.
9493540	9498700	They may, I don't know, maybe just they don't want to play through it or like, yeah.
9498740	9503380	Even a game like Mass Effect, correct me if I'm wrong, Darsakha, didn't Mass Effect 3
9503380	9508340	like have a mode where you could like up the combat and just like forget the story and
9508340	9509300	just play the combat mode?
9510060	9514220	You could do a mode that was like just the story elements without any of the combat
9514220	9514900	sequences.
9514900	9518220	Yeah, but I always did both because I like to explore the levels.
9518260	9522220	Right. And I think there was there was also a thing where like you make some decisions
9522220	9526220	during combat sometimes, so you actually are missing a little bit if you do it that
9526220	9531100	way. But, you know, this whole concept of let's have the
9531100	9535460	game be more of a narrative thing like a movie is not completely new.
9535500	9540500	We know. I mean, you know, for all the discussion we've had about a walking
9540500	9541820	simulator. Right.
9541820	9545380	And those types of games, like everybody's gone to the rapture and stuff, these games
9545380	9546900	that you don't die, you don't lose.
9547100	9549780	You just have to walk around and talk to the right people, you know.
9549780	9553060	But I still think those games can be very powerful and very good.
9553060	9556020	So, yeah, I think it's I think it's fine that Death Stranding is having it.
9556140	9559740	And if you don't know, the inside joke comes from a long way back.
9559740	9563580	There was a controversy about the game Borderlands and the BFF mode.
9563940	9567660	Anyway, Bobby Black Wolf had one of the developers on his show and suggested I don't
9567660	9571980	remember how it all came to I'm really paraphrasing here, but essentially BFF was
9571980	9576940	recategorized to mean Black Wolf Friends Forever mode because Bobby Black Wolf confessed
9576940	9581620	that he is he's not necessarily the most skilled game player in the world, which is
9581620	9584140	fine. You can love video games and suck at them.
9584140	9585420	I'm living proof as well.
9586460	9592260	But I'll probably if if I do play Death Stranding, which I I probably will, but I'm
9592260	9595420	like, there's a lot of games that are asking for my money over these next couple of
9595420	9598860	months. We'll see. I'll probably play an easy mode.
9599740	9604420	I won't play in very easy mode, but I'll play in an easy mode.
9604900	9606940	All right, so Alan's coming on camera.
9607140	9609420	Yeah. Make sure you have pants on, please, or something that.
9609700	9612460	So what you brought Oreos to the studio.
9612620	9613900	Oh, and what are these?
9613900	9616260	So these are what flavors is maple cream.
9616980	9618620	Oh, hmm.
9618940	9621060	It does because of all those freaking candles.
9621060	9623860	I brought cookies. I made pumpkin spice cookies.
9623860	9626980	Oh, yeah. You can you can have the first of these cookies.
9626980	9628020	I need to know what they taste like.
9628020	9629940	Take one of those and and enjoy them.
9630860	9633780	All right. But well, if I don't eat one of those, she's going to be very upset.
9633820	9635980	She made them like these were made in a factory.
9635980	9638460	Those were made at home with those were made with my heart.
9638460	9641020	All right. Anyway, just watch it for the red stuff.
9642540	9647300	All right. Also, yeah, Tiger Club giving us a related tweet in our chat room saying
9647300	9649860	Keanu Reeves stopped by to see Kojima recently.
9649860	9651220	That's true. I did see that picture.
9651220	9652260	That's fun. Cool.
9652260	9654260	I wonder what project they're working on.
9654260	9655420	I'd be curious about that.
9655420	9660940	Hmm. Anyway, as you know, Matt says, why should someone get good in order to beat a
9660940	9663740	game that they just want to finish for the story or other reasons?
9663740	9671340	Yeah, exactly. I looked at oh, Pixelpaca says, I looked up Guinness records.
9671580	9677740	There is one for longest running weekly podcast, same host and no submittals for it.
9678740	9683060	But I well, but here OK, here's the thing, because if we go to the level like Guinness,
9683460	9689100	do we get tripped up on a technicality that this show wasn't a podcast in 2002, the show
9689100	9693940	existed in 2002, but it wasn't a podcast until 2004.
9695060	9698700	I don't know, so that's that's that's where things get tricky.
9698860	9702660	So technically, I'm OK with saying we're the longest running video game online show.
9702940	9706860	How about longest running live video game show?
9706860	9712500	That's a good one, too, because we've always been mostly live except for like 98 percent
9712500	9714500	live. Yeah, I don't know.
9714900	9716020	We'll look into it. We will.
9716220	9717220	Anyway, we need to move on.
9718220	9721220	One more story. Guess what tomorrow is?
9721540	9727300	Tomorrow is or well, today, for many of you listening on the podcast feed, September
9727300	9733820	9th, 2019, which means 20 years ago was nine nine ninety nine.
9733980	9735860	And what happened on that day?
9735860	9738220	Nine, nine, ninety nine Dreamcast.
9738380	9739620	No, it's Final Fantasy eight.
9741860	9743540	No, nine, nine, ninety nine was the U.S.
9743540	9745020	release of the Dreamcast. No, I know it was both.
9746780	9747780	But you're right. Yes, of course.
9747900	9749380	Yes, of course. Why is what's written up there?
9749380	9750580	It's this Dreamcast anniversary.
9750580	9751860	Dreamcast is the most important.
9751860	9755900	That's right. Dreamcast was released on nine nine ninety nine.
9756540	9761580	And what's interesting about the whole kind of coincidence of the 20th anniversary coming
9761580	9764340	up, you know, Shenmue three is finally coming out soon.
9764820	9768340	There's actually going to be a PlayStation four collector's edition that will come with a
9768340	9772540	Dreamcast style case from Limited Run Games.
9772700	9778460	And of course, the preorders are going up on nine nine at twelve Eastern.
9778860	9780580	That's nine a.m. Pacific.
9781420	9783020	So, yeah, check that out.
9783180	9785860	So you can order that if you want at limited run games dot com.
9785860	9789620	And it does have like a little Dreamcast pack for Shenmue three, which I thought is pretty
9789620	9794260	cool. But I also thought quickly before we open up the discord and take some calls.
9794260	9798020	And if you want to call us tonight, head on over to our discord server over at vog network
9798020	9801460	dot com slash discord and join the green room.
9803060	9808740	And before we get to those calls, I'm just curious of some Dreamcast memories here in
9808740	9812940	studio. So what are some of your favorite like Dreamcast memories?
9813220	9815860	Darcy, are you guys like camped out and got that?
9816140	9817540	Did you see the Japanese system?
9817660	9821180	Well, we already had that. Yeah, but we we did camp out.
9821340	9827780	We we were in the line for the I don't think it was I think it was a game stop.
9828060	9830220	Finally, or maybe it was the E.B.
9831260	9837620	I'm trying to remember, but we we camped out at Arden Fair Mall and my friend Melissa and
9837620	9842060	I went over to Barnes and Noble to buy books from the cheap section to read in line.
9842860	9843540	So.
9845220	9850540	Yeah, we we camped and got a Dreamcast and Dan and I were like, OK, we've got another
9850540	9852500	Dreamcast. What are we going to do?
9853180	9857660	And because we'd already been playing our Dreamcast for a while.
9858580	9859820	But it was cool.
9860060	9864020	It was it wasn't the last time I camped out for a system, but it was one of the last few
9864020	9868220	times I camped out. So I would say the Nintendo Wii was last time I remember camping
9868220	9870540	out. That was a big to do because that was when we went around.
9870540	9872140	We were giving out doughnuts to people locally.
9872380	9875660	That was a lot of fun. I wish I wasn't camping out for the Wii U.
9875660	9876980	I camped out for the Wii. No, I know.
9877340	9879340	I'm sorry. I meant the Wii. But you weren't there with me.
9879340	9881340	That was me and Kristen. No, I went with you guys for a little.
9881340	9883060	I didn't stay overnight. You were there overnight.
9883060	9884220	Chris and I stayed overnight. Yeah.
9884260	9885940	Extra for when that was I pay.
9886100	9890260	I said extra for if you go camp out for it, I'll let you pick one of the games I buy.
9890260	9893660	And he did it because he he knew he'd have access to it because we'd be in the same
9893660	9896180	house. So he did it because I was like, I can't stay up all night.
9896300	9900180	Chris and I went out and and then they went out to go get
9902100	9904700	it was doughnuts and orange soda and coffee.
9904700	9906020	We got doughnuts and coffee.
9906140	9910260	Yeah, there was orange soda involved, though, because someone let us cut a place in
9910260	9912900	line because it was like it was the people who recognized our show.
9913020	9915540	Yeah, they were like, you're on my iPod like right now.
9915620	9917100	Yeah, I remember that. That was awesome.
9917100	9918580	I wonder if that guy still isn't.
9918580	9920620	Well, anyway, that was that was a really fun time.
9920620	9925140	And we just hung out like we had, um, we had their laptop
9925420	9928660	and we just like did chat based role play
9929260	9931660	the night and just talked about stuff and hung out.
9931660	9933180	It was actually really cool. Yeah.
9933180	9934540	So, yeah, that was a fun night.
9934540	9936580	Anyway, sorry. It was supposed to be the Dreamcast, not the Wii.
9936580	9937540	What about you, Loki?
9937540	9939620	Uh, my Dreamcast. I got it.
9939620	9941060	Accuse our all nighter.
9941060	9943820	I won it in a raffle.
9943820	9947660	Yeah. So I wasn't actually planning on picking up a Dreamcast ever.
9947660	9949460	And then I won it.
9949460	9952060	And so I was like, OK, cool. Buy some games.
9952700	9955580	And I bought games for it.
9955580	9958540	Shad Starzik or Shane in our chat wants to point out.
9959020	9960460	Oops, this comment just scrolled off.
9960460	9963020	I camped out at an EB Games for my Dreamcast.
9963220	9966180	I was so freaking excited for it, and it was not a disappointment.
9966180	9967740	And I miss it so much.
9967740	9969100	Also kind of piggybacking on that.
9969140	9972380	I camp out for like every system, even if I preorder it in advance.
9972620	9975140	Yeah, but I feel like so many people just like order it off Amazon now
9975140	9976540	and it's just waiting for them when they get home.
9976540	9978500	But that's how the PlayStation five is going to work.
9978500	9980020	I don't think people are going to camp out for it.
9980020	9981980	They're just going to order it online and it'll be delivered
9981980	9982660	while they're at work.
9982660	9984700	You know, that's I feel like that's kind of where it's going.
9984740	9985900	We'll see. I don't know.
9985900	9988780	Maybe we will still have the camp outs because it's not like every system
9988780	9989860	is going to go to Amazon.
9989860	9991780	Best Buy will still have some.
9991780	9993420	GameStop will still have some.
9993420	9995180	And, you know, Walmarts and Targets.
9995180	9998860	So who knows? Maybe the systems will see the camping out thing happen again.
9998860	10000420	So we'll see.
10001820	10005100	Let's see my dream, because I didn't get on board with Dreamcast until later,
10005340	10009020	because I actually fell out of gaming for a couple of years
10009020	10011900	around the time I was in college and right after and trying to get my
10012100	10014700	my bearings and like my career and things like that.
10014900	10019580	So I didn't get the Dreamcast until they were marked down to like forty dollars.
10019900	10024020	And I went and I bought a Dreamcast way after the fact, because I learned
10024020	10027620	that you could like burn your own discs with a homebrew, including it.
10027620	10029740	This is probably like after I knew you and you,
10029740	10034460	because I remember like we we burned a disc of NES games.
10034820	10037540	Julie had that server, remember?
10037540	10038780	Oh, that's right.
10038780	10041900	Because I remember I just remember using the Dreamcast to play the guardian
10041900	10044780	legend, which is a perfectly acceptable use of a Sega Dreamcast.
10045140	10050700	But then I also discovered the wonders and awesomes of Phantasy Star online.
10050700	10053540	And I was playing I found a cheap copy of that and started playing that.
10053540	10055700	And I was like, this game is fucking awesome.
10055700	10058940	So like I was really late to the party, but I loved it.
10058940	10061980	So that was that was my Dreamcast story.
10062300	10065620	So anyway, there you go.
10065860	10068020	So some Dreamcast reflection.
10068020	10071100	What was your favorite Dreamcast game when all is said and done?
10071100	10074660	And last call for any Discord callers tonight over at
10075460	10078300	our Discord server, vognetwork.com slash Discord.
10081060	10083660	I really did like Phantasy Star online.
10083660	10087660	And I liked oh, crap.
10088740	10091620	Puyo Da, the music, the Puyo Puyo music game.
10092220	10092900	That was really fun.
10094100	10095620	Wasn't Capcom SNK 2?
10095620	10097780	Yeah. Yeah. The fighting games are, of course, fantastic.
10097780	10098540	I was one of my faves.
10098540	10100700	But I'm like trying not to focus on the obvious.
10100700	10103180	Yeah. Power Stone, I have to say.
10103180	10104260	I mean, powerful.
10104260	10105420	Yeah, it's obvious.
10105420	10107260	But I'm sorry, I can't help it.
10107260	10110900	But honestly, Phantasy Star online, like I feel like that game
10110900	10112340	changed everything.
10112340	10113100	It really did.
10113100	10117460	Like that is when I started like loving online game experiences,
10117460	10120700	MMO type things that that game is revolutionary.
10120700	10123620	And I'm so excited that PSO2, even if it's supposed to be
10123620	10125460	like a different thing, I'm happy that we're actually getting
10125460	10126860	a release of it here in the US.
10127220	10128180	It's about fucking time.
10128820	10130660	Loki, what about you when it comes to the Dreamcast?
10130940	10132260	Probably Power Stone as well.
10132460	10133540	I really like that game.
10133780	10136700	Yeah. Dark Tetsuya says, oh, man, tough call.
10136700	10139620	Crazy Taxi is in my top five easily.
10139860	10141500	Also had Tony Hawk Pro Skater on there.
10141500	10142220	That was pretty fun.
10142220	10143660	Yeah, good choices.
10143660	10144140	Good choices.
10144260	10144500	All right.
10144500	10146100	We had a couple of people join the green room, so I'm going
10146100	10148700	to get through these two calls here and then we can wrap up.
10148700	10149820	But first, we'll take some calls.
10150020	10150780	So hello.
10150780	10152020	You are on Orange Launch Radio.
10152020	10152540	Who's this?
10153540	10154820	This is Shane.
10154860	10156260	Hey, Shane, it's good to hear from you.
10156260	10156900	What's up, buddy?
10157740	10164380	Um, I wanted to say that first of all, moving is a blast and
10164380	10167020	is super fun and everybody should do it.
10167500	10170500	Uh, is this the introduction to the opposite sketch?
10170500	10172260	Because that is such a lie.
10172260	10173220	Moving is terrible.
10173820	10174780	It really is.
10175420	10178540	But once you, once you get it done, it's awesome.
10178980	10182260	I've got my new Shane cave thing.
10182700	10186380	It looks really good with the lights and it's less cluttered.
10186420	10187500	Wait, send me pictures.
10187540	10188100	I want proof.
10188100	10189340	I want to see the Shane cave.
10189940	10190260	Okay.
10190260	10190620	I can.
10190620	10190900	Okay.
10190900	10191220	Hold on.
10191700	10192020	All right.
10192020	10193740	We don't have to do it right this second, but I'm just saying
10193740	10195980	eventually I can do it and talk.
10196020	10198900	I've only been on one ambient so far tonight.
10198900	10199540	So it's okay.
10200020	10200340	Oh yeah.
10200340	10203660	By the way, guys, Shane tried to tank an instance in final
10203660	10206260	fantasy 14 last night while he had taken two ambient, which
10206260	10207260	you're not supposed to do.
10207620	10210820	And like, he literally fell asleep during one of the boss encounters.
10210820	10214140	And I'm like, why, why are you forcing yourself to stay awake?
10214140	10214820	And I'm going to yell at you.
10215300	10216380	I wasn't tanking.
10216380	10217460	You were tanking.
10217740	10220780	Whatever you were healing and you were like standing in bad.
10220900	10221900	You fell asleep.
10221900	10222580	It was terrible.
10223980	10227300	So two not so appropriate for dungeons.
10227300	10227740	Got it.
10228500	10235540	Anyway, I'm taking a picture of this room and I just wanted
10235540	10240740	to talk about now my feelings about Dreamcast because more
10240740	10245180	to my story from earlier is I worked at target for that launch.
10245180	10248780	Like I worked that launch, but I went over to the EB games
10248780	10253420	or electronics boutique just because I knew the person there
10253420	10254700	and I wanted to help them out.
10254780	10262140	And it was, I don't think I had felt that like amazed at buying
10262140	10265300	a console until the switch.
10265340	10268780	So from the Dreamcast to the switch, that's where I was
10268780	10271020	in terms of like being in awe.
10271300	10274460	I forgot that you ever worked at a target for one.
10274580	10275460	I mean, but that was before.
10275900	10277620	That was my first job ever.
10277740	10278340	So, yeah.
10278620	10282420	So, so you, but you went over to EB games, even though you could have
10282420	10285980	just, were you allowed to put one aside for yourself?
10285980	10286540	Probably not.
10286540	10287460	That's probably why you had to do that.
10289020	10289740	Oh, I don't know.
10289740	10293100	Because back then to me, there was no huge, okay.
10293100	10295500	Cause GameStop is the thing everybody hates.
10295740	10296660	These were EB games.
10296660	10298420	These were like cool people.
10298620	10303020	They didn't really do a lot of tracking for like pre-sales
10303020	10304260	or upsell you as much.
10304260	10308620	It was more like a, the way you'd want to be treated as a customer.
10308620	10311020	And it was all funko land here in California.
10311420	10313420	Same idea or a software, et cetera.
10313420	10314180	It was the other big one.
10314180	10316020	So yeah, yeah, exactly.
10316580	10321700	So I didn't, I was like, I feel responsible to go over there
10321700	10323700	and buy the stuff I want.
10324340	10327780	But, um, anyway, I'm trying to take a good picture right now of this
10327780	10328820	so I can send it to you.
10329100	10333340	Cause it's, it's your, uh, it's your screen right now.
10333340	10335500	So I'm backing up.
10337500	10337940	Okay.
10337980	10341700	So, uh, yeah, some comments in chat saying, uh, Kaijuna says, not everybody.
10341700	10342620	I love GameStop.
10342940	10346100	Uh, as soon as Matt says the electronic boutiques back in the day were great.
10346220	10347500	We did have EB games here though.
10347500	10348700	Cause they used to have one in our mall.
10348700	10350980	So there's, there's, there were a couple of them, but I remember
10350980	10352180	Softworks said it was a good one.
10353020	10359740	Once a GameStop body EB games, that's why you wouldn't have a, have them anymore.
10359980	10360380	Yeah.
10360660	10365060	Uh, well for the longest time, there was a GameStop and an EB games in the
10365060	10366700	mall, even after one bought the other.
10366860	10369860	It was only like, God, it feels like it was only like five years ago.
10369860	10371140	They finally closed that EB games.
10371140	10372060	It really wasn't that long ago.
10372340	10375780	A lot of folks reminiscing about Babbage's I noticed as well.
10376020	10380300	So that was another one of those chains that was in the, uh, uh, the collective
10380300	10381580	that GameStop ultimately bought.
10381940	10386020	And I did post something on Twitter about GameStop actually
10386020	10387940	going to bat for me this week.
10388220	10394900	I had a funky Joy-Con situation on the new model switch and we talked it out
10394940	10398380	and she opened up another box to see if it was having the same issue.
10398900	10401780	And it wasn't, sorry, it wasn't just the Joy-Con, it was like the railings
10401780	10407820	on the Joy-Con, um, and she swapped it out for me and it's, it made me
10407820	10414300	realize that as harsh as I am on people that work at GameStop, they are
10414300	10420260	people that for the most part will try to help you out and I can't,
10420340	10422060	it's their corporate that sucks.
10422140	10423660	And yeah, that's absolutely right.
10423860	10427380	Any criticism I've ever had a GameStop is usually about their corporate and
10427380	10432820	not, not usually the employee, but there are some, and this is, you know,
10432820	10434060	obviously the exception is not the rule.
10434060	10437700	There are some employees that use it as a power trip.
10437740	10439980	Like they're the fucking gatekeeper of video games.
10440020	10440660	You know what I mean?
10441140	10444140	And that's always like dumb, but not everybody does that.
10444140	10447100	Obviously you've had some good experiences as well with that.
10449620	10450180	Yeah.
10450340	10453180	And so I actually went over there and pre-ordered something.
10453460	10454620	Sucks to be them though.
10454620	10456380	I found it cheaper at other places.
10456380	10461140	So I'm going to go cancel it, but they should have known better.
10461700	10462220	Um, okay.
10462220	10469220	I'm almost on my last picture for you and then I'm going to send it.
10469740	10470420	That's that button.
10470620	10470940	Okay.
10471220	10472820	So it's coming in.
10473020	10474060	It's not finished.
10474300	10477020	I'm still getting another bookshelf delivered.
10477220	10480900	Um, I think sometime this week that we'll put together.
10487860	10488660	Oh, sorry.
10488940	10489500	Do you trade?
10490900	10491580	It got quiet.
10491700	10492220	Yes.
10492260	10492780	Sorry.
10492780	10495420	Is there, did you want to share more Dreamcast memories?
10496620	10497340	Oh, me?
10497740	10498060	Sorry.
10498060	10500180	I was like all over the place.
10500540	10500940	Yeah.
10500980	10502060	Um, yes.
10502100	10511140	So two others, I got somebody amigo and my dog peed all over the mat.
10512100	10513820	I totally forgot about somebody amigo.
10513820	10515060	That was such a good game though.
10515700	10517420	Yeah, it was such a good game.
10520140	10524740	And then a game I got obsessed with that I don't think ever came out here.
10524740	10527420	I had to be shown like a burned game of it.
10527820	10528980	Cool, cool tune.
10529380	10530940	That game was awesome.
10531620	10537540	It has great music and I recently tried to look up some videos on it on YouTube and I
10537540	10539460	didn't find nearly as many as I wanted.
10539500	10540700	So, okay.
10540700	10544060	So I'm just getting all the pictures of your little Shane cave and all the blue
10544060	10545900	and purple and red and stuff in there.
10546220	10551860	Um, it does look really nice, but like, um, I feel like that would be hard on the
10551860	10552500	eyes.
10552540	10553300	It's kind of dark.
10553300	10558060	It's actually, no, the lighting is actually easier on my eyes.
10558380	10558980	Interesting.
10559860	10561220	All right.
10562580	10563020	All right.
10563020	10566620	Well, uh, any else, anything else you want to, uh, bring up here before I get to
10566620	10567780	another call here and then wrap up?
10568820	10570180	No, that's fine.
10570660	10571060	All right.
10571340	10573900	Well, um, good night and I'll talk to you later.
10575020	10575660	Good night.
10576060	10576420	All right.
10576420	10576740	Bye.
10577500	10577860	Bye.
10578660	10579140	All right.
10579140	10580460	Let's go to one more call here.
10580500	10582220	And, uh, after this we'll wrap up.
10582220	10583220	Hi, you're on orange on radio.
10583220	10583620	Who's this?
10584340	10585820	Hey, what's up everybody?
10585820	10586500	It's Ronma.
10586740	10587260	Hey, Ronma.
10587260	10587980	It's good to hear from you.
10587980	10588580	What's on your mind?
10589300	10590300	Not too much.
10590340	10593420	Uh, it's great to hear from you all again and welcome back from DragonCon.
10593500	10594580	Um, thank you.
10595500	10595980	You're welcome.
10596300	10597060	A couple of things.
10597060	10600100	I'm going to be about my way, cause it is getting a little late here.
10600140	10605540	Um, early on when you mentioned Castlevania, I know I shared this with
10605540	10611860	Jamie last week, but I came across this amazing heavy metal cover of Vampire
10611860	10612180	Killer.
10613300	10613780	Yes.
10614740	10615460	That was really good.
10616460	10618940	And I think she also has a couple of other covers as well.
10618940	10620020	That is just as great.
10623780	10626540	I will gladly go ahead and link that into chat.
10626540	10629380	Cause I think everybody needs to hear this cause it's so good.
10630660	10634500	Sadly, I can't really play it here on the show, but you can link that in the chat
10634500	10636260	and uh, yeah, we'll have to, I'll check that out.
10636300	10637620	I want to, I didn't hear this, so.
10638420	10638820	That's good.
10638820	10639100	Done.
10639900	10644140	Now the second thing you're talking about DragonCon and the cosplay and
10644140	10647820	the guys doing cosplay, I'm just here beaming as I'm sitting here
10647860	10650060	editing convention photos.
10651420	10655460	Let me tell you, when you were talking about dudes, just revealing,
10655900	10657660	there was one convention I went to.
10658620	10661820	They had a Virgin Killer photo shoot meetup.
10662140	10666620	Basically it was most, I missed this, but it was in this video of it.
10666620	10670820	There was a bunch of guys wearing Virgin Killer sweaters for, for the photo shoot.
10670820	10673340	And it was like one of the best things I've ever seen in my entire life.
10674260	10675660	The sweaters are ugly.
10677860	10684140	It kind of is, but you know, I mean, I have seen people match them with certain
10684140	10689100	outfits and looks pretty well, you know, but you just have to have
10689100	10690540	a really nice back for that.
10691300	10692460	Well, that too.
10693180	10696740	And as long as the back is shaven too, you know what I'm saying?
10696940	10698020	There is that, yes.
10698860	10699380	I don't know.
10699380	10701700	I know a few bears that might be into that look.
10702580	10703660	Oh, so do I.
10703780	10704620	So do I.
10706700	10710220	But yeah, um, do you notice like the trend I was mentioning about like
10710220	10713300	DragonCon and you know, all these guys, is this something you're noticing too?
10713300	10717660	Is that you see a lot more like, like, uh, dudes that are getting more and more
10717660	10718740	comfortable with what they're wearing?
10719660	10720700	Absolutely.
10720740	10722940	I mean, not for nothing.
10722940	10727340	Like for one, the cosplays that I do is Human Artemis from Sailor Moon.
10728180	10733300	Part of his outfit, part of his stomach is showing and I got that, you know,
10733300	10737620	Buddha belly, so I'm like, I don't like to show it, but lately it's like,
10737620	10741100	when I do the costume, I'm like, you know what, F it, I'll just, I'll
10741100	10744980	just go as is and it, and it's, and it goes over pretty well.
10745340	10748100	It's like, it's just the confidence of people.
10748100	10750140	It's just going over.
10750140	10754020	It's like if that person A can do it, person B can do it.
10754100	10755380	Let's just roll with it.
10755380	10758180	You know, cause I will say this.
10758260	10764660	I went to BronyCon last month and I will say, I have all the conventions I've gone
10764660	10771420	to, I have never seen so many people comfortable in their cosplays, their
10771420	10774860	original concept, cosplay designs, everything.
10774940	10779140	It was just people, people were just absolutely happy being who they were.
10779420	10782900	I have not felt something like this in a very long time.
10783820	10787140	I will say there is something very empowering about the whole like, fuck it
10787140	10788420	mentality, you know what I mean?
10789060	10789460	Mm-hmm.
10790580	10793580	So, and I'm, I'm all for it.
10793580	10798100	And I'm just like, and I understand that there are some cosplays that are a little
10798100	10802460	bit too revealing, which I totally get, but you can always like do slight
10802460	10806380	adjustments to it for your body type.
10806380	10808820	So you can still rock it however you want.
10808820	10812340	And if you want to do it just the way it is, then you do you.
10813820	10814780	Very true.
10814900	10816180	Very good message.
10816180	10817580	And I think we'll leave it on that.
10817660	10820220	Uh, but more to come on this week's anime jam session, right?
10820860	10824380	Yeah, we have a lot to catch up on because we didn't have a show last week.
10824940	10825500	Yeah, yeah.
10825500	10828220	I know you guys like had a flight issue or something, right?
10828220	10830900	Cause I got delayed, but you got like super delayed cause you got
10830900	10831940	canceled or something, right?
10832500	10837060	Yes, I got canceled and I was up at four o'clock in the morning to
10837060	10841140	catch a flight to Philly, then catch a train to New York so I could be to work.
10842140	10842780	Yikes.
10842780	10845580	All right, well, yeah, Mr.
10845580	10847020	Smoosh is distracting the show.
10847020	10847580	What else is new?
10847780	10850780	Anyway, Rama, I'm going to say good night so we can wrap up, but
10850780	10851740	thank you so much for your call.
10852300	10852780	No problem.
10852780	10854380	Good night and good luck.
10854620	10854940	All right.
10854940	10855420	Take care, buddy.
10857100	10857660	All right.
10857660	10861180	Well, I think with that, we're going to wrap up for the night ourselves here.
10861220	10863260	Cause, uh, we've been, we've been running a long time.
10863260	10866780	It's over a three hour show tonight, but not that that's a bad thing whatsoever.
10866780	10869420	We had a lot to say after we've been gone for a little bit, but it is that
10869420	10872940	time for us to wrap up the show and get everybody's final thoughts so we
10872940	10874220	can get on out of here for the night.
10874620	10877900	Um, but we'll be back in seven days to talk about the latest in gaming.
10877900	10880780	We know Tokyo game show is fast approaching, so that's going to be a thing.
10881260	10882620	No, he's probably whining about that.
10882620	10883100	Sorry.
10883100	10887420	Um, and, uh, we, uh, also know we're going to have the news on
10887420	10889900	Nintendo's fitness thing to talk about next Sunday.
10889900	10891180	So it's going to be a very busy show.
10891180	10895180	And so we hope you'll be here live at Twitch TV to experience it, or at

10903340	10904460	but that's something I'm working on.
10904460	10907500	So by the end of the year, it's one of those things on the list in the next few
10907500	10907980	weeks.
10907980	10912460	Um, but anyway, uh, before we wrap up, I'll also say, if you enjoyed what you

10944780	10947500	Anyway, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts tonight.
10947500	10949900	So, um, I'll start cause usually I end up last.
10949900	10954540	So my final thought is, um, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go move this blanket onto the
10954540	10956700	bed now and make Alan sleep with this blanket.
10956700	10959580	I think that would be fun, especially when I'm going to be gone with
10959580	10960940	orientation for my new job.
10960940	10964780	He could sleep with a blanket and it'll be like I never left.
10964780	10967500	So anyway, uh, Loki, your final thought.
10967500	10970300	My final thought is I'm going to keep working on my game.
10971180	10971680	Good.
10972300	10974460	And last but not least, Star Soccer, your final thought.
10975020	10978700	Uh, did you know that text from superheroes is still an active website?
10979740	10980140	No, I didn't.
10980140	10980940	And it's still funny.
10981580	10981900	Okay.
10981900	10982780	I'll take your word for it.
10983660	10984160	Okay.
