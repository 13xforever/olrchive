Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
This week, we want WoW Classic. You don't want WoW Classic. Okay, you can have WoW Classic.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
WoW Classic is too crowded. We are de-dossing WoW Classic.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
This is just another week in Gaming Society. Stay tuned for the rest of the updates and gaming news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:32.000 --> 00:38.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet. Welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:38.000 --> 00:46.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio. Live tonight with episode number 791 for this September the 8th of 2019.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.000
Yes, we're back live here at Twitch.tv slash VOG Network after a break for a couple weeks.

00:52.000 --> 00:56.000
We had a show that was recorded in advance a couple weeks ago and that went pretty well.

00:56.000 --> 01:01.000
I saw the chat and you guys participated along with that. That was great. I think we'll do that again in the future.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
We're going to have a pre-planned show that we're missing.

01:04.000 --> 01:11.000
And then we were off last week because of Dragon Con Labor Day anniversary for the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.000
Yep, that was fun.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
Hi, how are you and Dan?

01:14.000 --> 01:15.000
We're good.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
Good. Weird question. How was your anniversary? I should specifically have asked.

01:19.000 --> 01:24.000
It was fun. We went to Midtown and had dinner at the Waterboy.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Oh, that's a fancy place.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
It's a little fancy.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Fancy pants.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.000
And they brought us out, you know, a Prosecco toast and we were happy. A little booze.

01:34.000 --> 01:40.000
Just chilled. It was a nice chill five day weekend for me.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
Good, good. Yeah, it was a long weekend for me too, obviously. I was out of town for 10 days.

01:46.000 --> 01:52.000
And Saturday, I think I went to a little bit of a fancy pants restaurant, too. We were in Atlanta, Dragon Con, obviously.

01:52.000 --> 02:01.000
And sometimes it is honestly faster, instead of trying to eat at the food courts down there, to just walk one block away from Dragon Con.

02:01.000 --> 02:09.000
Call a Lyft or Uber, whatever you like, to pick you up and take you to Midtown a mile away where there's lots of nice restaurants.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
That's an expert I did one night. It was fantastic.

02:11.000 --> 02:19.000
And Metal Mayhem, no, it is not themed after a stupid ass Adam Sandler movie because people actually have taste.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
Unlike, you know, I mean, some places here in Sacramento have taste.

02:22.000 --> 02:31.000
There's another bar that is under a lot of scrutiny for having a very racist disclaimer outside of their restaurant or whatever.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.000
I only heard about that when I got back. Sometimes I'm glad to miss news.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Actually, the news came up after you got back.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
Oh, I thought it was when I was gone.

02:38.000 --> 02:43.000
No, but at any rate, the water boy is like super fancy. So just saying.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Cool.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Casual fancy, actually.

02:45.000 --> 02:55.000
All right. And of course, that comment and more in our chat room because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice Geekies Network, vognetwork.com at twitch.tv slash vognetwork.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
And you can chat along with us here at Twitch with myself, DarkSakura.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.000
And of course, we cannot forget right there. He's right there. You can't miss him. It's Techmaster Loki.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
I'm right here.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
How are you?

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
I'm good.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
What are you reading about with Animal Crossing?

03:06.000 --> 03:09.000
Oh, that's our kickoff topic coming up. I see. I thought it was an Animal Crossing related thing.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
I was like, oh, technically, I guess.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
OK.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
But you should see the groups I'm in.

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
Everyone has psych has analyzed every little frame.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
But we'll get into that.

03:20.000 --> 03:28.000
Is that one of those like when a new Pokemon trailer comes out, there's like a three hour discussion, YouTube, about the 15 second trailer.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Yeah, pretty much.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
I'm in an Animal Crossing New Horizons group on Facebook.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
And yes, that's what people do.

03:34.000 --> 03:41.000
Fun. We have like lots of like there's like lots of little things we've got to catch up on for not having been here for a few weeks.

03:41.000 --> 03:48.000
So before we get into the kickoff topic, let's address some of those outstanding news, outstanding agenda items from last week's meeting.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Yes.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
Let's let's go over the action items from last time last time we had a meeting.

03:53.000 --> 04:01.000
So first off, I want to give a big thank you to everybody I saw and met, networked with, talked to, had fun with at Dragon Con 2019.

04:01.000 --> 04:07.000
I'm actually wearing my Dragon Con badge tonight and sprinkled some effects from the con throughout the studio tonight.

04:07.000 --> 04:11.000
But I had a great time at Dragon Con. Awesome panels. Great.

04:11.000 --> 04:19.000
Some some some familiar faces from Twitch, places like giant size team up and so forth that I've worked with before they got to work with again.

04:19.000 --> 04:27.000
And new faces as well on many panels, some great like cosplay folks on Twitch here, some other video game channels and so forth.

04:27.000 --> 04:35.000
Just a great year for like networking and talking a big, big thank you to the video game track for having me back to do a last minute Battle Royale panel,

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
which we talked a little bit about at the tail end of the Bobby Blackwell show this week.

04:38.000 --> 04:43.000
And also, I got to moderate the World of Warcraft voice actors panel, which was great.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
The talent on there was so, so good.

04:47.000 --> 04:55.000
So many great voice actors loved hearing Dave Fennoy, who's the voice actor for Volgen, was actually doing so he does a lot with The Walking Dead.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
He's a very nice buddy. Oh, yeah. He's a very well-known voice actor.

04:58.000 --> 05:05.000
He's great. Dino does a lot of the like a goblin gnome type voices like Professor Putricide and stuff.

05:05.000 --> 05:10.000
He's hilarious. He has a lot of the comedy events there as well. Let's see. Samantha, you know, a heart.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.000
She was really she was just adorable and she she has a really high pitched voice.

05:14.000 --> 05:20.000
So I was like, I already know what characters you're seeing just based on your voice. But she was so sweet.

05:20.000 --> 05:26.000
I liked her a lot. Quentin Flynn, I had a panel with him last year because he's also a voice in Mass Effect.

05:26.000 --> 05:30.000
But he's also the voice of Kael'Thas, which, you know, he's very commanding presence and voice.

05:30.000 --> 05:35.000
So it was a lot of fun to be with him. That's a very dramatic voice. Yes. Yes.

05:35.000 --> 05:40.000
It's funny because some of the voices are like, oh, you're a boss that I've wiped to in this game a lot of times.

05:40.000 --> 05:47.000
And then not that I'm going to play favorites, but maybe a little bit just because I love Kimberly Brooks.

05:47.000 --> 05:53.000
Like she was just I love them all, but I really love Kimberly Brooks. And she, of course, is Ashley in Mass Effect.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
But she has a resume. She's also a Laura. OK, yeah.

05:55.000 --> 06:01.000
If I were to open up Kimberly Brooks's resume, it would be like that thing where I open up the scroll and then the scroll falls on the ground and starts rolling.

06:01.000 --> 06:07.000
Because that's like her resume. And yeah, she was she was so friendly and nice and great.

06:07.000 --> 06:11.000
So, yeah, just it was a real honor to work with everybody on that panel.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.000
So, yeah. And yeah, Dragon Con was was wonderful.

06:15.000 --> 06:25.000
A big thank you. Just personally, I don't think he listens to this program, but I have to thank Charles McFall for who is the director of the digital media track for like just everything.

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
Like the belief he's had in myself and Bobby and our abilities and so forth over the years.

06:30.000 --> 06:34.000
And I feel like I really owe him a lot for a lot of the opportunities I've gotten at Dragon Con.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
So I just want to give a big thank you. And of course, you know, not to leave anybody.

06:37.000 --> 06:43.000
Obviously, I get to spend the weekend with Bobby Blackwolf and Jennifer and we had a lot of fun.

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
And my pal Extrofer from Guys on a Show back in the day went to his first Dragon Con.

06:48.000 --> 06:55.000
Cool. And we had a lot of fun. If you want to hear more about it, you can check out the archives here at VOG Network on Twitch.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.000
We did a little special show midweek. We did Guys on a Dragon Con.

06:59.000 --> 07:05.000
So we were playing Overwatch, which it was it was tough because it was we were getting really distracted by Overwatch the first 15 minutes.

07:05.000 --> 07:10.000
But when we kind of scaled it back and did one on one matches instead, we were able to like talk a lot about.

07:10.000 --> 07:18.000
So if you want to hear the stories about how Extrofer and I got invited to meet Twitter friends at a public gathering where all the men were not wearing pants.

07:18.000 --> 07:25.000
Just I'm gonna leave that I'm gonna leave that teaser right there so you can go check that out Guys on a Dragon Con in the Twitch archive.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
You do have to be a subscriber to access the video archive here on Twitch.

07:29.000 --> 07:35.000
But good news. A lot of you guys get your free subscription with Twitch Prime and it's September.

07:35.000 --> 07:42.000
So it's really cheap. This it's like half off this month. So if you are feeling so inclined, you can subscribe to VOG Network on Twitch.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
That's the last I'll plug that though. I don't want to I don't want to commercial commercial commercial all the things.

07:46.000 --> 07:53.000
But thank you. Thank you. Thank you to everybody involved with Dragon Con. I had a fantastic time once again, and I will see you in 2020.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
Okay, an outstanding agenda item. I have to ask you about Loki.

07:57.000 --> 08:03.000
We've been following this on the past few weeks of the show. So you were going to participate in a game jam.

08:03.000 --> 08:09.000
And I did. And now here's the thing. I could see you were broadcasting, but obviously I'm at a con. I can't really watch.

08:09.000 --> 08:16.000
Yeah. And you're the three hour time difference is really killer too. So I could see you were broadcasting, but I never got to see past like day two.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
What became. So walk me through your game jam journey quickly.

08:20.000 --> 08:26.000
So I had taken a couple of days off to work on my game jam game.

08:26.000 --> 08:32.000
But I knew like from the get go that time was going to be a problem because I have a day job and family.

08:32.000 --> 08:39.000
And it's just hard to be able to dedicate enough time to a game jam at all.

08:39.000 --> 08:44.000
So I thought, hey, maybe, you know, if it's a week long, maybe I might have a better chance. Still was a problem.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
So but it I thought it went OK.

08:47.000 --> 08:54.000
Like so I got the concept down and I started building the game and I'm still working on it.

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
I'm not going to give up on it. It's just that I didn't finish it by the deadline, which is fine.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
But like looking at what other people did, like my initial focus.

09:02.000 --> 09:09.000
OK, so let me back up. So I did the thing called a community game jam and the theme ended up being the game is a liar.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
And so that was the theme. And we had to kind of figure out what to do with that.

09:12.000 --> 09:19.000
Now, my initial thought was, OK, let's just make it. I want to be the guy type of game or something like that or Kaizo Mario type of game.

09:19.000 --> 09:25.000
But a lot of people did that shit. And so I was like, I don't want to do that because that's just the obvious thing.

09:25.000 --> 09:30.000
Did you fall into the typical Loki trap of I may I picked because I had to be different.

09:30.000 --> 09:35.000
I picked a project that was too big for me to take on in the time frame.

09:35.000 --> 09:39.000
No, it wasn't really. I did. I kept simplifying it as I went along.

09:39.000 --> 09:44.000
So I don't think it was that it was just I didn't have enough time to work on it because I had to do it.

09:44.000 --> 09:50.000
I ended up having less time dedicated to it than I could have been dedicated to it.

09:50.000 --> 09:54.000
So but you are committing to finish. Yes. Yes, I'm going to finish.

09:54.000 --> 10:02.000
So so what it ended up being, it was this game called Bullshot because the premise of it is that Loki, this is a family show.

10:02.000 --> 10:08.000
Watch your language. No, of course, you know, that's industry term for like media that represents something.

10:08.000 --> 10:14.000
At a much better quality than it actually ends up being not representative of the final product, if you will.

10:14.000 --> 10:24.000
So the premise is that you're testing these weapons made by this company called Bullshot Arms, where all of the guns look really amazing,

10:24.000 --> 10:34.000
but they all suck in a different way. And so you have to overcome the the flaws in these weapons to in order to progress through the game.

10:35.000 --> 10:39.000
You went with like a reverse Gungeon idea kind of. It sounds like sort of.

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
Yeah. So it's basically it's a top down twin six shooter like Smash TV.

10:44.000 --> 10:51.000
And that's kind of how I set it up. And so I've been just going through right now and getting the gameplay stuff done.

10:51.000 --> 11:02.000
I recently just deleted my level because I'm rebuilding it with a 3D tileset instead of just it was just like a template thing that I built out of cubes.

11:02.000 --> 11:12.000
So I'm kind of taking it a little further with that. It's just been adding stuff to it, but it just got to the point where like I knew that like I could feel like more of my progress was time wise.

11:12.000 --> 11:17.000
And like I think by like the end of Tuesday, I'm like, I'm not going to finish this on time. There's no way.

11:17.000 --> 11:27.000
So but I kept going through it. But I did stream the entire time. Well, not the entire time, but like each day I did stream and I did end up hitting Twitch affiliate this that last week.

11:27.000 --> 11:44.000
So that was cool. And I like the actually the live development stuff. And as I'm going along doing it, I kind of got more ideas with like, oh, hey, this would be kind of cool to like come up with a concept and just keep working at it like slowly and not necessarily under the time pressure of a game jam.

11:44.000 --> 11:55.000
I still want to do more of them, but like I just I'm not like a college student or somebody that can like that has like, OK, I'm a block out 48 hours dedicated to that.

11:55.000 --> 12:01.000
Like, I can't do that. I can't just just commit to finishing the one. It's OK. You can finish late. It's OK.

12:01.000 --> 12:08.000
Our listeners will be so happy to play a Loki game. Exactly. And looking at some of the other game people finish too soon and looking well, looking at some.

12:09.000 --> 12:19.000
Well, I see what you did there. Your little your little bull shot jab there now. But, you know, I bet a lot of the people that did finish something, they're probably going to still refine it.

12:19.000 --> 12:29.000
Right. And there's some that like were out there, like I played some of the games that were like, you know, I feel that they were really rough. But then maybe that's I'm maybe I'm set my standards way too high for a game jam.

12:29.000 --> 12:34.000
Yeah, but even yes, even warmer, warmer.

12:34.000 --> 12:42.000
Fine, whatever. But like I thought I lowered my standards enough and I kept like I kept going, OK, well, I got to make this easier and easier and easier.

12:42.000 --> 12:48.000
But like, I don't know, I just didn't want to do the obvious thing, which is like a Kaiser Mario thing, because I saw so many of those out there.

12:48.000 --> 12:52.000
In fact, like the guys, those are annoying. Let's slam all those people that chose to.

12:52.000 --> 13:02.000
No, no, no. And it's not that's not bad. Like even the guy like one of the the you guys finished one of the guys that did it like Braxis or whatever he's one put one of the creators putting on the thing.

13:02.000 --> 13:10.000
That's what he did. He did one of those. But like the his twist on it was that like he using the mouse, you can kind of see where all the traps are and stuff.

13:10.000 --> 13:16.000
And so that was kind of cool. But, OK, that's clever. I mean, I guess next time I'll just do something even simpler.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
But I like where I was going with this and I think it'll be cool.

13:19.000 --> 13:28.000
I will say this. I think it is really cool that you kind of like I don't want I don't know if it was like holding yourself accountable or whatever, but like the fact that you chose to like live stream it and do it that way.

13:28.000 --> 13:34.000
I thought was a really cool idea. And I do see in chat like Quest Buster in chat says, I watched a few of Loki streams. It was looking good.

13:34.000 --> 13:39.000
His concept was cool. And so I do think that is really cool that at least you like documented what you have.

13:39.000 --> 13:45.000
And I hope you want to continue it. And I probably will start live streaming it again at some point.

13:45.000 --> 13:50.000
You know, obviously not as often, but I have been working on it almost every day.

13:50.000 --> 13:57.000
So it does look much better than it was. I mean, I'm looking over his shoulder.

13:57.000 --> 14:02.000
It's hard to see. I can't just magically put it on the camera, but I can see he's working on something.

14:02.000 --> 14:07.000
I don't know what the fuck any of it is, but I see I see vectors and shapes and things.

14:07.000 --> 14:14.000
It's it's basically a level with the doors still there, but the level parts deleted out of it because because I deleted it out.

14:14.000 --> 14:19.000
I just had an inspiration for a name of an L.A. game, but I don't know what it's going to be.

14:19.000 --> 14:23.000
It's along the lines of Pixel Shit's Vecturds. Vecturds.

14:23.000 --> 14:28.000
It would be that it would be when Pixel Shit's goes 3D. Vecturds. Vecturds. Yes.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
Hey, Y Y R. Sequel Vecturd. I'm sure he'll get the right.

14:32.000 --> 14:36.000
Oh, yeah. Like just even like going and we'll talk about it later.

14:36.000 --> 14:41.000
I went to an event this weekend. Also watch, you know, looking at what some other indie developers are working on.

14:41.000 --> 14:50.000
That's upcoming business. I understand. But like, you know, like what they do, there's a thing called a progressive game jam where they're working on game jam games over the course of like several months.

14:50.000 --> 14:58.000
Also, though, at a time frame that I can't participate, I would love to participate in that, but I can't at the time that it's at.

14:58.000 --> 15:04.000
It's like five hours every Saturday. I'm very nervous to propose another vog game jam after the last one.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.000
I took so long to follow. Oh, we need to do it.

15:07.000 --> 15:16.000
But OK, well, what if we did some type of like virtual progressive thing at a time you can do it and we all like stream a certain.

15:16.000 --> 15:21.000
Why not? Not we. Because I I'll I'll do something. I won't do a game making, but maybe something else.

15:21.000 --> 15:28.000
You can do a game jam like they have like a game. There's like play make a twine game.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.000
Well, they have like playmaker and stuff. That's all it's all visual, like block based stuff.

15:31.000 --> 15:38.000
So, I mean, we could do something, but maybe choose a block of time that you can do and we can we can do that for a few weeks.

15:38.000 --> 15:44.000
Yeah. Well, and also like the thing is like it's nice to be in this and keep doing it and stuff.

15:44.000 --> 15:49.000
And as I'm going along, of course, every time you do it, you learn stuff from it and you get better.

15:49.000 --> 15:55.000
And that's that's the whole point. Why do it like I knew that there was a very slim chance that I would make it in time.

15:55.000 --> 15:59.000
I was hoping that I would, but it's it's the learning process.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
And you already have your first sign up.

16:01.000 --> 16:05.000
Dar Tetsuya says, if you want to do a game jam, let me know. I'd love to dust off multimedia fusion two again.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.000
I'll even stream it. I think we should do it.

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
Yeah, I really do. But yeah, soon. But yeah, we'll see.

16:12.000 --> 16:16.000
We'll see more of this project. This is not something I'm going to be giving up on.

16:16.000 --> 16:20.000
And it's been actually really fun. So the game plays there, which is the important part.

16:20.000 --> 16:28.000
So now I'm just getting the level stuff done and then I have to add a ton of guns because that's the whole point is there's a ton of guns in the game.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
And I only have two right now.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.000
All right. One more outstanding action item that I can think of.

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
And then we need to get into our kickoff topic. What? We're only like 15 minutes into the show.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
Haven't gotten to gaming news yet, but this one is really important.

16:41.000 --> 16:48.000
So over the summer, I was giving you all the saga of the online survivor game that I was playing.

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
The survivor LARP that I was participating is what I kind of referred to it as.

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
And I won. Shock and awe. I actually won. It was first place out.

16:57.000 --> 17:02.000
22 people. Do you all remember what my prize was? What I was going to win for?

17:02.000 --> 17:08.000
Because the budget didn't have a million dollars. A blanket with either the game's logo or my face on it.

17:08.000 --> 17:13.000
And guess what, everybody? All right. The blanket. It looks like a towel, kind of.

17:13.000 --> 17:18.000
Can you guys talk for the podcast? Rob has a giant towel with his face on it.

17:18.000 --> 17:24.000
I assume it's his face on it. Oh, my God.

17:24.000 --> 17:31.000
Oh, good Lord. Yeah.

17:31.000 --> 17:38.000
It's Princess Rob. And now because is it like your name is over the top of it at the bottom, but you had your shirt.

17:38.000 --> 17:43.000
This is Princess on it. So this is Princess Rob. It does kind of say Princess Rob.

17:43.000 --> 17:47.000
I don't know if the host intended that, but I think it's hilarious.

17:47.000 --> 17:51.000
But the other thing is that this is the princess daddy shirt.

17:51.000 --> 17:55.000
I think this is. Is this the one that Delvin got me? I think.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.000
No, he got me the strawberry beefcake one. No. Princess Daddy I found somewhere else.

17:59.000 --> 18:05.000
And it was just it was I don't know. It was funny. So I wore it and I wore it when I took the picture.

18:05.000 --> 18:10.000
Not knowing that at some point it would end up being on a victor's blanket.

18:14.000 --> 18:20.000
Funny. So I thought. So here's my next idea. So you notice how, like, it's all like white, like around the outside.

18:20.000 --> 18:24.000
Like it's just like it's just begging to be defaced. Right. With sharpies.

18:24.000 --> 18:34.000
So dark, dark soccer's eyes, just like like it totally just did the cartoon thing where they slanted downwards like evil thoughts are entering your mind.

18:34.000 --> 18:42.000
But no, it's not for you. But I actually so I'm meeting one of the other players is going to be out here in San Francisco in like three weeks.

18:42.000 --> 18:47.000
So I'm going to get him to sign it and then I'm going to be out in New York and one of the other players lives out there.

18:47.000 --> 18:56.000
I'm going to get him to sign it. So I'm going to try my next goal is to get all the players and people that were involved in the game to sign it in the upcoming years.

18:56.000 --> 19:01.000
I'll stop the order for the incredible glow in the dark paint called Lit.

19:01.000 --> 19:06.000
So I was like one of the players is in the UK. One of the producers was in Australia.

19:06.000 --> 19:10.000
I was going to take a little time to travel the world and get all that.

19:10.000 --> 19:16.000
So there we go. Awesome. Except it's really hot. I would love to wear this for the whole show, but it's it's really hot.

19:16.000 --> 19:22.000
So I think I'll be in the winter. Maybe in the winter I will. So I'm going to give this blanket back to Pikachu.

19:22.000 --> 19:27.000
So let's get into our actual kickoff topic tonight. Get into video games.

19:27.000 --> 19:31.000
There was a pretty big, pretty big Nintendo news event this year, wasn't there?

19:31.000 --> 19:40.000
So they did Nintendo Direct. And as we figured, because it is coming up on the one year anniversary of Nintendo Switch Online,

19:40.000 --> 19:48.000
they announced, as we figured they would, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System Nintendo channel type thing.

19:48.000 --> 19:56.000
So basically you can play retro Super Nintendo games much like you could with the NES classics.

19:56.000 --> 20:01.000
Some of the games or the games that are included in the initial release.

20:01.000 --> 20:09.000
Brawl Brothers, Demon's Crest, Breath of Fire F-Zero, Joan Mack 2, Lost in the Tropics, Kirby's Dream Course,

20:09.000 --> 20:17.000
Kirby's Dream Land 3, Pilot Wing, Star Fox, Stunt Race FX, Super EDF, Super Ghouls and Ghosts, Super Mario Kart,

20:17.000 --> 20:24.000
Super Mario World, Super Mario World 2, Yoshi's Island, Super Metroid, Super Puyo Puyo 2, Super Soccer, Super Tennis,

20:24.000 --> 20:29.000
and The Legend of Zelda, A Link to the Past. So that's pretty awesome.

20:29.000 --> 20:34.000
One thing, though, that was interesting that kind of...

20:34.000 --> 20:43.000
is that they mentioned that they're not going to be adding games regularly anymore to the NES and Super NES stuff.

20:43.000 --> 20:52.000
So that's kind of... I'm surprised. Like, it wasn't a lot already, and now we're getting even less. I don't know.

20:52.000 --> 20:59.000
I'm not surprised about that at all, actually, just because it takes them off that monthly schedule that everybody's kind of like beholding them to,

20:59.000 --> 21:05.000
and they just might not have enough agreements or whatever in there. I mean, I'm disappointed, don't get me wrong, because I am a big fan of...

21:05.000 --> 21:10.000
and by the way, just totally ate a story that's coming up later, but that's okay. We'll correct the sidebar here in a moment.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.000
Sorry.

21:11.000 --> 21:18.000
That's okay. So they obviously kind of feel like they're held to this monthly schedule of game releases,

21:18.000 --> 21:26.000
and the reality is that maybe they don't want to be held to that monthly standard because they may just not have enough agreements

21:26.000 --> 21:35.000
on the Super Nintendo side from third parties and what have you, especially since we know companies like Square Enix released that collection of Mana,

21:35.000 --> 21:40.000
which that's where Secret of Mana is at, and it did very... I'm assuming it did pretty well for themselves.

21:40.000 --> 21:50.000
So I wouldn't expect, you know, unlike the hardware SNES classic, I would not expect that we're going to get like Final Fantasy 2 and 3.

21:50.000 --> 21:56.000
I use my quotey fingers because we all know they're 4 and 6 Japan, but when they were released here, they were Final Fantasy 2 and 3.

21:56.000 --> 22:05.000
I would not hold my breath that those will ever come to this online service because the reality is if Square Enix wants to do that,

22:05.000 --> 22:12.000
they're going to just release those games independently. What I really wish they do is do a port of Final Fantasy 4 on PSP.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
That's the version I really want on Switch, to be honest.

22:15.000 --> 22:20.000
But anyway, I don't necessarily see that maybe the third party participation is going to be as high.

22:20.000 --> 22:24.000
Obviously, it's there. Yes, we have Capcom games in here. We have Data East in here.

22:24.000 --> 22:27.000
We do have third parties. I'm not saying third parties are not going to happen.

22:27.000 --> 22:31.000
I just feel like maybe Nintendo does not have all those agreements lined up.

22:31.000 --> 22:38.000
They're probably projecting their schedule and they can't stay on a monthly schedule, so they're going to do basically more when they feel like it.

22:38.000 --> 22:49.000
Maybe it'll work out a little better actually because as interesting as those SP releases were, let's be real, they're just glorified save states.

22:49.000 --> 23:00.000
That's all they are, right? So maybe they'll incorporate those somewhat differently so they don't feel they have to release these SP games just to buff up the number of games they're offering.

23:00.000 --> 23:08.000
So maybe if we only get releases every three months, well maybe we're going to get ten games every three months.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.000
That's still probably a little high, but it's like seven games every three months or something.

23:11.000 --> 23:18.000
We're still feeling like, ooh, this is a big gush of games. We'll see.

23:18.000 --> 23:26.000
They announced a new character for Smash Ultimate, so Terry Bogard from Fatal Fury is going to be coming to Smash Ultimate.

23:27.000 --> 23:32.000
And they also announced that there are going to be even more DLC characters coming as well outside of the Fighter's Pass.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
What else? We've got Tokio...

23:37.000 --> 23:44.000
Can I say the Terry Bogard thing? There's a lot of people on Twitter and so forth that are just kind of like, what? Who? Huh?

23:44.000 --> 23:49.000
But I really like Fatal Fury. Fatal Fury is my favorite of the Neo-Jovians.

23:49.000 --> 23:54.000
I like the video they did where the thing going through everybody's different hands.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.000
Wasn't that great?

23:55.000 --> 24:02.000
Yeah, and Dan and I were like, we were just like, could you imagine Yuri in Smash? That would be hilarious.

24:02.000 --> 24:06.000
Now, I don't want a tinfoil hat, but maybe I'm going to tinfoil hat a little bit, okay?

24:06.000 --> 24:11.000
So they announced as part of that that they're not going to end it after one more character.

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
Originally they said five DLC characters, but they announced there's going to be more, right?

24:15.000 --> 24:22.000
I will just point out, in that little montage of people grabbing the envelopes and flopping, you know who else wasn't there?

24:22.000 --> 24:30.000
Mai. And I'm just saying, if there's another Fatal Fury character that is kind of legendary, it's Mai.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
And I would love it if she was there.

24:32.000 --> 24:39.000
And there's also other characters they didn't show like Shizumaru or Cham Cham or so many other SNK characters.

24:39.000 --> 24:46.000
But I'm thinking of flagship SNK characters just because obviously Terry Bogard and Mai were in almost every single Fatal Fury game.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
Mai wasn't in the first one.

24:47.000 --> 24:52.000
They were skipping through a lot of the Samurai Shodown characters, which were really big characters.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
Fair. So again, I'm tinfoil hatting a little bit.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
If they brought in Hanzo, though, that would be pretty badass.

24:57.000 --> 25:03.000
But I love that Terry Bogard's in there just because of the SNK fighting games, I love Fatal Fury. It's a good one.

25:03.000 --> 25:12.000
I like the Mii characters. One of them is Sans from Undertale.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
So that was pretty cool.

25:14.000 --> 25:23.000
I'm surprised with the Terry Bogard character that they did in there. They didn't do the gender swap Terry Bogard from the all female fighting game that SNK did just recently.

25:23.000 --> 25:30.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. The one that was, I can't remember the name of it, but you're right. They had the whole female fighter thing that came out.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
But they had, yeah, female Terry Bogard.

25:32.000 --> 25:36.000
Tammy Bogard. No, I don't know what the name was. But yeah, they gender swapped a lot of characters.

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
I just, I don't know. Did they bring back Ms. X?

25:39.000 --> 25:45.000
Oh, Bobby got a good point. Don't forget all the SNK, all the Smash characters have like eight different costumes.

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
Perhaps one of the Terry costumes will be the gender swap Terry.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
Maybe.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
That's a very good thought from Bobby. SNK heroines.

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
Terry is a girl's name. You died of dysentery.

25:57.000 --> 26:07.000
Alright, anyway. Let's see. So, there's a Wii U port of Tokyo Mirage Sessions, FE Encore.

26:07.000 --> 26:12.000
And that's coming out in January. That was a Wii U game at one time.

26:12.000 --> 26:23.000
Deadly Premonition was getting a sequel and then they ported Deadly Premonition, I guess the original one is Deadly Premonition Origins, which came out the same day.

26:23.000 --> 26:34.000
They'll be doing Assassin's Creed Rebel Collection, which is a port of Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag and Assassin's Creed Rogue.

26:34.000 --> 26:39.000
The Xenoblade Chronicles Definitive Edition coming in 2020.

26:39.000 --> 26:44.000
This was a big one. Overwatch is coming to the Switch in October.

26:44.000 --> 26:50.000
Yeah, those rumors were really gaining steam through the Wii. Ever since we kind of finished our last episode, it was like there was lots of the Overwatch stuff.

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
Well, that's one less thing that's going to be at a...

26:53.000 --> 26:59.000
Blizzcon. Yeah, one less Blizzcon. Well, I'm sure it'll be there and they might do tournaments or something, but yeah.

26:59.000 --> 27:02.000
What do you think about Overwatch on the Switch?

27:02.000 --> 27:03.000
That's cool.

27:03.000 --> 27:06.000
Yeah, I think it's cool and there's definitely a lot of people that want it.

27:06.000 --> 27:16.000
I'm just going to say it is a little bit that this game's been out for several years now and it seems to be they're releasing mostly the same game again.

27:16.000 --> 27:21.000
I hear there are like, ooh, you can do tilt controls and you do Junkrat's little rip tire and stuff.

27:21.000 --> 27:25.000
Okay, cute, but let's be real. That's not a real feature, okay?

27:25.000 --> 27:32.000
So like I would have thought it would have been cool if maybe like you could play offline in like a LAN mode.

27:32.000 --> 27:36.000
Like Overwatch has one versus one in it.

27:36.000 --> 27:40.000
Hello. That's what Xfer and I did most of our streaming on earlier this week was one versus one.

27:40.000 --> 27:50.000
So you could do like some LAN stuff or if I'm at a convention like Dragoncon or Blizzcon and I want to play with a bunch of other people, we should be able to do an impromptu match, not necessarily tied to online.

27:50.000 --> 27:55.000
It would be unranked and you wouldn't get any of the points for loot boxes. Sure, all that would...

27:55.000 --> 28:02.000
But there's a way you can do it. Like if you're going to say, but, but, but this particular online restriction, you're nickel and diming it.

28:02.000 --> 28:11.000
They could do it offline if they really wanted to, but they're not. And that's further exacerbated by the fact that you can't even really buy the cartridge.

28:11.000 --> 28:18.000
You just buy the physical edition is just a code, which I get like Overwatch is a very like online centric game. Yes.

28:18.000 --> 28:22.000
But I'm just saying it would have been nice. They could have done these kind of like extra little things.

28:22.000 --> 28:26.000
They're not going to charge $60 for it, are they? Do we know the MSRP for this?

28:26.000 --> 28:31.000
I don't know, but I just, you know, I don't think they would charge 60 bucks for that.

28:31.000 --> 28:38.000
I don't think so either. I heard 40, but I didn't hear it like in a, that is 100% the way it's going to be way.

28:38.000 --> 28:44.000
But I'm just going to point out Overwatch has been a game that's been on sale for $20 multiple times now.

28:44.000 --> 28:49.000
So to kind of justify the Switch thing, like as rad as I think it is that it's on the Switch.

28:50.000 --> 28:54.000
Like A, this should have happened probably at least a year ago.

28:54.000 --> 29:01.000
B, I need the price to be a little bit more reasonable because 40. So they are going to charge 40 for it.

29:01.000 --> 29:05.000
But here's the thing. So that's on that's on the high end.

29:05.000 --> 29:14.000
Hold on. So it's $40, but it also includes three months of Nintendo Switch Online with the physical version that's out.

29:14.000 --> 29:20.000
I don't know what the online version is going to be costing. Maybe like 30?

29:20.000 --> 29:27.000
Maybe. Well, we'll see. Some folks in chat over Twitch TV slash VOG Network.

29:27.000 --> 29:33.000
Kaijuto says Overwatch is a sports game, so don't expect it to change. They won't do an Overwatch 2.

29:33.000 --> 29:40.000
I wouldn't rule out an Overwatch 2 completely, but I do completely understand what you mean about like Overwatch League and all this.

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
Like they don't want to roll out a replacement for the game that's in the league.

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
They're going to continue making enhancements to what they have.

29:46.000 --> 29:52.000
But I could see an Overwatch expansion. Blizzard is very big on expansions, right?

29:52.000 --> 29:58.000
And not necessarily expansions with like characters. Not that, but I would think like maybe a single player campaign expansion.

29:58.000 --> 30:05.000
Think along the lines of those events they do for the rising, the rising events they do.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.000
Something where you could kind of do that a little more in like a single player type of way.

30:08.000 --> 30:13.000
I could see Overwatch going in that direction for Switch, PC, and all the platforms really.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
That's what I could see happening as opposed to like an Overwatch 2.

30:16.000 --> 30:21.000
I would agree that their base Overwatch game probably not going to change for a while.

30:21.000 --> 30:31.000
They'll probably do another version of it for PlayStation 5 and the next Xbox that runs on the same engine, but just more better-er graphics.

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
To use a technical term.

30:34.000 --> 30:40.000
Some other announcements. Divinity Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition is out on the Switch.

30:40.000 --> 30:48.000
Game Freak's town is now being called Little Town Hero. It's coming out October 16th.

30:48.000 --> 30:56.000
Bethesda is re-releasing Doom 64 on the Switch on November 22nd.

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
Will I need to be logged into my Bethesda.net account to continue?

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Hopefully they won't do that this time.

31:01.000 --> 31:07.000
Star Wars Jedi Knight 2 Jedi Outcast will be available on the Switch later this month.

31:07.000 --> 31:10.000
I'm reporting some of these old games here.

31:10.000 --> 31:17.000
Super Kirby Clash, which is a free-to-play Kirby game, was released.

31:17.000 --> 31:24.000
Luigi's Mansion 3 Scream Park mode. They say it's like a multiplayer version of it.

31:24.000 --> 31:29.000
It's two to eight players against each other in like an arena with ghost battles.

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
They showed some more stuff for Pokemon Sword and Shield.

31:32.000 --> 31:37.000
They had a new mode called Pokemon Camp.

31:37.000 --> 31:41.000
I guess you can play with your Pokemon and do customization.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.000
And cook things.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
And cook things.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Lots and lots of hot dogs.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
Hot dogs or curry rice?

31:47.000 --> 31:48.000
Yes.

31:48.000 --> 31:55.000
And then Animal Crossing New Horizons. They showed also some updates with that, including some of the crafting stuff that you can do.

31:55.000 --> 31:59.000
And now Darkstalker and I will start the four-hour dissection of the information that was discussed.

31:59.000 --> 32:06.000
Some of the other things that were noticed, though, by the way, is that they did change some textures between the build they showed before and this one.

32:06.000 --> 32:12.000
They also carry around bags. There's a fishing box that you can carry around.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.000
I can have a murse?

32:13.000 --> 32:14.000
You can have a murse.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.000
Yes.

32:15.000 --> 32:21.000
But they also have badges that you can put on different doors and things. So more outside house customization.

32:22.000 --> 32:29.000
I'm really impressed. I've been sitting here beating the drum of the core Animal Crossing game needs to freaking be updated.

32:29.000 --> 32:33.000
Because essentially it didn't really change from the GameCube version to the Wii version.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
Like little tweaks here and there.

32:35.000 --> 32:39.000
But this one looks like you're decorating the outdoors and shit.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
There's more stuff you're doing.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
Animals can wear pants.

32:43.000 --> 32:47.000
What kind of oppressive society are we creating?

32:47.000 --> 32:54.000
Can we do one thing, though? Because this is an online game, which I'm assuming requires Nintendo Switch Online.

32:54.000 --> 33:03.000
So we already have established that I probably would have Nintendo Switch Online, which includes Nintendo and Super Nintendo games.

33:03.000 --> 33:09.000
Can we put those back in there and have consoles and everything like we used to do in the original Animal Crossing?

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
Since we technically already have access to those.

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
Technically the original Animal Crossing didn't have the games in them.

33:14.000 --> 33:17.000
Fine. The one that came out on the GameCube.

33:17.000 --> 33:21.000
That is original to us here in the States, yes.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.000
I love it when she drills us on the 10-pound.

33:26.000 --> 33:29.000
And technically when I said Animal Crossing I wasn't talking about Animal Kingdom.

33:29.000 --> 33:32.000
Or Animal Forest, whatever.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
Anyway.

33:34.000 --> 33:39.000
Well, I mean, the suggestion you make, it seems workable.

33:39.000 --> 33:44.000
But we're also assuming that Animal Crossing will require Nintendo Online.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
It probably won't, actually.

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
It probably won't require it.

33:48.000 --> 33:52.000
It's only going to require it if you want one of those gates.

33:52.000 --> 33:55.000
You go visit other people's town and use any of the online features.

33:55.000 --> 34:00.000
Fine. How about it allows you to do it if you have Nintendo Online.

34:00.000 --> 34:03.000
So if you don't have it, you can't play them.

34:03.000 --> 34:10.000
Yeah, maybe the Nintendo games only come from doing some type of exchange with your friends.

34:10.000 --> 34:13.000
Or going somewhere you can only get to outside the gate.

34:13.000 --> 34:17.000
Like in Animal Crossing Mega Mall or something that has the games. I don't know.

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
Alright. Anyways, some other stuff that they announced.

34:20.000 --> 34:28.000
Trials of Mana, I guess remake of Desuetsu 3 will be available next April.

34:28.000 --> 34:30.000
Nice.

34:30.000 --> 34:34.000
Return of Obra Dinn is coming out this fall.

34:34.000 --> 34:38.000
That's a cool looking, kind of like a pirate type game.

34:38.000 --> 34:43.000
Which is all done in black and white dither graphics, which is kind of cool.

34:43.000 --> 34:49.000
Rogue Company is a new team based shooter from Hi-Rez Studios coming out in 2020.

34:49.000 --> 34:52.000
Tetris 99 is getting a new mode called Invictus.

34:52.000 --> 34:58.000
Which is basically Tetris 99 with the best of the best players.

34:59.000 --> 35:03.000
Also there's going to be a two player versus CPU mode.

35:03.000 --> 35:09.000
And those are going to be coming out as well as part of a packaged version of the game coming out.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
Or actually already came out.

35:13.000 --> 35:19.000
And then there's another Daemon X Machina demo that was launched last week.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
Which will probably be the last one.

35:21.000 --> 35:24.000
So friends of mine were playing that and thought the character customization was fun.

35:24.000 --> 35:28.000
What was that game though where you're on the British battleship or something?

35:28.000 --> 35:31.000
That's the Return of Obra Dinn.

35:31.000 --> 35:34.000
Yeah that game was interesting. Really interesting.

35:34.000 --> 35:41.000
Yeah you have a watch that you can set stuff back in time so you can see how people died to solve some puzzle or something.

35:41.000 --> 35:45.000
Bobby Blackwolf with a hot take on the NES games in Animal Crossing.

35:45.000 --> 35:50.000
He's saying, I'd hate to have to open Animal Crossing and then go somewhere in the game to play an NES game.

35:50.000 --> 35:53.000
Instead of going into the NES online app on my Switch to play them.

35:53.000 --> 35:57.000
It's kind of like how I don't want to use VR to play an 80's arcade game in VR.

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
A screen inside a screen.

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
It's like we now have a better delivery mechanism for NES and SNES games.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
We don't need Animal Crossing for it anymore.

36:04.000 --> 36:08.000
Well here's the thing. I'm not saying that would be the only way to play the games.

36:08.000 --> 36:12.000
Or like those little cartridges sitting in your house.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.000
Little NES systems or cute little decorations.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.000
And took up space.

36:15.000 --> 36:19.000
Sure and it might be fun to have your little arcade and you could actually play the game.

36:19.000 --> 36:22.000
Just as a cute little thing.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
They lived in my basement.

36:24.000 --> 36:30.000
But I'm saying that the only way to get those machines for your house is to go out, get a machine, bring it back to your village type of thing.

36:30.000 --> 36:32.000
And you have to use the internet to do that.

36:32.000 --> 36:37.000
So it's just a cute little decorative thing.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
If you don't like it, don't do it. Sheesh.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
It would be cool though if you could build an arcade.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
Yeah, it would be fun.

36:44.000 --> 36:49.000
Do a few Sims-ish kind of things where you can build commercial properties.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
And we said that for when they did Animal Crossing on the Wii.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
And break the Nook monopoly.

36:53.000 --> 36:59.000
Is that it would have been cool if they're not going to do these NES games anymore because they realized they could sell them for $5 a pop.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Or do what they're doing now, the Nesflix thing.

37:01.000 --> 37:08.000
It would have been cool if they just did some original little Animal Crossing crappy little Atari reimaginings.

37:08.000 --> 37:12.000
Or Game & Watch reimaginings with Animal Crossing characters and have those be the things in your house.

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
But instead they made Nintendo Land.

37:16.000 --> 37:20.000
Bobby says it's a deserted island. There are no commercial properties.

37:20.000 --> 37:23.000
It's a deserted island with other people on it.

37:23.000 --> 37:26.000
Yeah, but as you can see, you can...

37:26.000 --> 37:29.000
What's a good word? Domesticate the island.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
And people have homes.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.000
You can gentrify the island very easily.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
Yes, gentrify.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
Is it really deserted if there's other people on it?

37:36.000 --> 37:39.000
You know what? Eventually you build a nuclear power plant in SimCity.

37:39.000 --> 37:45.000
Eventually, you know, drill baby drill.

37:45.000 --> 37:50.000
Sorry, can't have video games on a deserted island, but we can talk to animals.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Although I am...

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
That's where I draw the line in reality here.

37:54.000 --> 38:01.000
For Sims 4, I'm saying right now that I am working on a commercial property in my game that is a fitness gym and wine bar.

38:01.000 --> 38:03.000
I would go there.

38:03.000 --> 38:06.000
And Bobby does want to remind us, I'm getting it day one.

38:06.000 --> 38:07.000
Yes, of course.

38:07.000 --> 38:11.000
As the CEO 100 Matt says, what Rob really wants is Game Room the game.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
Fuck yes, I do.

38:12.000 --> 38:16.000
Why didn't Microsoft just completely...

38:16.000 --> 38:20.000
Instead of like kind of half-assing it with Viva Pinata...

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
I know some of you love Viva Pinata, sorry.

38:22.000 --> 38:27.000
Why didn't they just fully fucking rip off Animal Crossing with Viva Pinata characters and make it Game Room?

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
Like, come on.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.000
Alright, anyway.

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
Sorry, Nintendo Direct.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.000
That's it.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.000
Oh, okay.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Did you mention the Xenoblade Chronicles thing?

38:37.000 --> 38:38.000
Yes.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
Okay, I must have spaced out.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Yeah, the Xenoblade Chronicles.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
So it was...

38:42.000 --> 38:43.000
Yeah, no, it's fine.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
Yeah, I mentioned it.

38:44.000 --> 38:47.000
So they're doing the HD reimagining of Xenoblade Chronicles.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.000
I'm really excited for that.

38:49.000 --> 38:52.000
Because that game has had an interesting history.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
It's a very good RPG.

38:54.000 --> 39:01.000
I think when I played it on the Wii finally, I think I said it was the best PlayStation 2 RPG I played on the Nintendo Wii.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
That's kind of how I feel about Xenoblade Chronicles.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
But here's the thing.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.000
That game was really hard to play previously.

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
Because remember, it was that whole Operation Rainfall.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
They didn't release it here for the longest time.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.000
They had it in the UK.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.000
They had it in Japan.

39:15.000 --> 39:16.000
I'm gonna fess up.

39:16.000 --> 39:19.000
I pirated it because they didn't want me to buy it.

39:19.000 --> 39:20.000
They didn't release the game yet.

39:20.000 --> 39:23.000
Then finally, they finally decided,

39:23.000 --> 39:28.000
Oh, okay, fine, we'll release Xenoblade Chronicles in the US as a GameStop exclusive.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.000
Or you can buy it in the Nintendo online store.

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
It's a remaster GameStop exclusive as well.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.000
No, no, thank heavens it's not.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.000
And then they released it one more time.

39:38.000 --> 39:41.000
But only for the new 3DS.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
Not the old 3DS that many people already have.

39:43.000 --> 39:44.000
But only for the new 3DS.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.000
So I'm not saying you couldn't play that game.

39:46.000 --> 39:50.000
But I just feel like that game was always somehow limited to the base.

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
But now to see that they're gonna do an HD remaster,

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
it will probably be on the digital shop.

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
It will be very easy to get a hold of.

39:57.000 --> 40:02.000
We are not gonna have to worry about how the audience for the game is going to be limited in one way or the other.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
So I feel like more people will finally get to experience it.

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
I'm sorry, I know you've been dying to comment.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
This is actually going back to Animal Crossing.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.000
I just had a brainwave.

40:09.000 --> 40:13.000
What if the universe of Animal Crossing is kind of like the world of Hot to Full Boyfriend,

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
where humans are dying off,

40:16.000 --> 40:19.000
and animals have taken over everything,

40:19.000 --> 40:25.000
and they've grown anthropomorphic qualities?

40:25.000 --> 40:30.000
What if the Mayans were right, and the world actually ended in 2012,

40:30.000 --> 40:33.000
and our reality is the fake reality,

40:33.000 --> 40:36.000
and Animal Crossing is the real reality?

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
Can you prove that I'm wrong?

40:39.000 --> 40:43.000
The burden of proof should be on proving that you're right.

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
Not proving that you're wrong.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Look who got elected president.

40:48.000 --> 40:52.000
I rest my case.

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
That's not in my reality.

40:53.000 --> 40:56.000
He could have had an animal controlling him from the top of his head.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
I rest my case.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.000
Anyway, moving on.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
I couldn't resist. I'm sorry.

41:03.000 --> 41:08.000
Internet conspiracy theories was like a thing that came up at Dragon Con.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
I am so proud.

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
Can I just state how proud I am of Bobby Black Wolf?

41:13.000 --> 41:16.000
When an Avril Lavigne song came on at the food court, he said,

41:16.000 --> 41:18.000
Hey Rob, it's Melissa.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.000
He just said that in chat.

41:20.000 --> 41:26.000
What if Avril Lavigne died in 2003 and was replaced by a body double named Melissa?

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Anyway.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
All right, I'm sorry. Where were we?

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
Xenoblade Chronicles. Oh, yes. Great game.

41:32.000 --> 41:35.000
Why do you have to be so complicated?

41:35.000 --> 41:39.000
Bobby, with another comment that I think is worth addressing, saying,

41:39.000 --> 41:44.000
I know some people are waiting for Xenoblade Chronicles X to come to Switch

41:44.000 --> 41:47.000
so they can finally get rid of their Wii U.

41:47.000 --> 41:50.000
I would assume if this version does really well

41:50.000 --> 41:53.000
and sells oodles and oodles of copies

41:53.000 --> 41:56.000
that they'll look at doing a Xenoblade Chronicles X. Why not?

41:56.000 --> 41:59.000
Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is already on the Switch.

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
So, yeah, why not Xenoblade Chronicles X? That'd be fun.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.000
All right.

42:04.000 --> 42:06.000
So that's it for the Nintendo Direct then. Let's move on.

42:06.000 --> 42:10.000
Let's talk about our gaming weeks now that we're almost an hour into the show.

42:10.000 --> 42:14.000
How is your gaming week? The types of video games that we have been playing this week.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
Meaning if you want to go back three weeks, you can...

42:16.000 --> 42:18.000
This weeks?

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Yeah. How is your gaming weeks, DarkSakura? Why don't you start us off?

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
Sims.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
You don't have to name every single thing.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.000
My usual phone stuff in Sims 4

42:26.000 --> 42:29.000
because I now have finally made a vampire,

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
which is really distracting when you're trying to design your vampire

42:31.000 --> 42:35.000
and they stop and hiss when you're trying to change their eye color.

42:35.000 --> 42:39.000
So I'm making this weird vampire family

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
where there's this old lady who doesn't give a shit.

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
She's just a vampire and she's living her best vampire life.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
And there's one who's trying to be the extra vampire

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
and trying to bite everybody.

42:49.000 --> 42:52.000
And then there's the young vampire who's kind of in denial.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
And then I'm going to have a ghost live in their house too.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
Only 53 more days until Halloween?

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
Something like that?

43:00.000 --> 43:02.000
It's Halloween season now.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
I've already decorated it at work.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.000
Anything can happen on Halloween.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.000
Anything.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
Stop it.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.000
I'm sorry. I can't help it.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
All right. That's it. Sims, Sims, more Sims.

43:14.000 --> 43:16.000
And baking.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Hey, I was going to ask you during the agenda items

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
because I didn't want to leave you out of the discussion.

43:20.000 --> 43:22.000
We haven't really talked about this,

43:22.000 --> 43:24.000
but I know you're prepping streaming stuff.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Yep.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.000
Have you set a date yet?

43:28.000 --> 43:30.000
Nope.

43:30.000 --> 43:36.000
Well, because I just ordered a shield for the pop cover for the mic.

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
Oh, okay.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
That I guess is on indefinite loan now.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
Yeah, no, because I got a Yeti.

43:42.000 --> 43:46.000
I think that blue mic was donated to me anyway.

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
So I'm pretty sure that was the one that Code Man gave to me.

43:49.000 --> 43:53.000
So I'm pretty sure he will be completely okay with a pay it forward situation.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
All right.

43:55.000 --> 43:58.000
You know, the thing I'm missing is a webcam right now.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
And I'm probably not going to do cam stuff anyway.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.000
Maybe just like as a switchover.

44:04.000 --> 44:09.000
But, um, and then we are, I still have the El Gato capture

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
that you loaned us a need to go.

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
Oh, yeah, I have a new one now.

44:13.000 --> 44:20.000
Okay, so we're planning on trying to hook up some of the HD friendly stuff,

44:20.000 --> 44:23.000
but I'm actually going to start off with just sim stuff because it's easy

44:23.000 --> 44:26.000
and I can, you know, take feedback while I build houses.

44:26.000 --> 44:29.000
Yeah, just try to get the habit, make the habit of actually doing streaming.

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
That's the hardest part.

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
And I say that for myself too.

44:33.000 --> 44:37.000
But I found the equipment I actually want to get is there's James from The Sim Supply

44:37.000 --> 44:40.000
who listed all of the stuff on his website.

44:40.000 --> 44:44.000
And I really like the way he sounds on this mic.

44:44.000 --> 44:46.000
I really like the sound of it.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.000
And I was kind of looking into the same equipment.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.000
Although I'm not going to, you know, if I get a camera set up,

44:50.000 --> 44:54.000
I'm not going to like pay the bucks for like a, you know,

44:54.000 --> 44:58.000
I'm just going to deal with like a Canon or Sony or something.

44:58.000 --> 45:01.000
I want to address this comment from our chat because she hold 10 and chat says,

45:01.000 --> 45:04.000
You guys should think about using Mixer. It is fresh and new.

45:04.000 --> 45:08.000
You know, I did give Mixer a serious consideration

45:08.000 --> 45:11.000
when we were looking at moving VOG Network to, you know, like,

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
are we going to go to Twitch, Mixer, YouTube?

45:13.000 --> 45:16.000
You know, nothing was really off limits completely.

45:16.000 --> 45:19.000
I think ultimately we chose to go with Twitch just because

45:19.000 --> 45:23.000
at the time we made the decision, it's the larger community.

45:23.000 --> 45:27.000
The monetization elements and how you can kind of work with that,

45:27.000 --> 45:31.000
it seemed a lot easier to kind of get through that barrier of entry

45:31.000 --> 45:34.000
where I'm not sure we would have met Mixer's barrier of entry.

45:34.000 --> 45:37.000
So those were like, I don't want to sound anti-Mixer or anything by any means

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
because I'm really not.

45:38.000 --> 45:41.000
Like, I'm really excited that there are like competing platforms

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
because I think that's going to be great for everybody.

45:43.000 --> 45:46.000
And I actually see the Ninja, even though I don't watch him,

45:46.000 --> 45:48.000
Ninja moving to Mixer, I actually see that as a good thing.

45:48.000 --> 45:51.000
Like that's really healthy for what these two sites are going through

45:51.000 --> 45:55.000
with their growing pains and other people that want to enter this, you know, thing as well.

45:55.000 --> 45:59.000
So I watch Mixer, but as of right now, especially because of the fact that,

45:59.000 --> 46:02.000
you know, we have to think not just for ourselves,

46:02.000 --> 46:06.000
but the other folks that stream on Twitch that make up

46:06.000 --> 46:12.000
the Voice of Geeks network, I do see us staying on Twitch for an extended period of time.

46:12.000 --> 46:15.000
But if I have friends that are streaming on Mixer, I'd absolutely support them.

46:15.000 --> 46:20.000
It's a fun platform and I like how they do the sparks, you know, it does different stuff.

46:20.000 --> 46:26.000
I'm going to monetize for one reason and it's two words, student loans.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
Seriously.

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
Right.

46:28.000 --> 46:29.000
Debt consolidation.

46:29.000 --> 46:30.000
All right, anyway.

46:30.000 --> 46:31.000
Yeah.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.000
Let's see, moving on.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.000
Let's talk about more gaming weeks.

46:34.000 --> 46:35.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

46:35.000 --> 46:39.000
I didn't play a whole time because I've been busy working on my game.

46:39.000 --> 46:45.000
So I did end up playing for the first time yesterday Beat Saber.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
So that was fun.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
I got to play that.

46:49.000 --> 46:50.000
How'd you like it?

46:50.000 --> 46:51.000
It was fun.

46:51.000 --> 46:57.000
I did pretty well for my first time because they had like a competition they were doing on hard for one thing.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
I was like, I can probably do that.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
You know, I can play rhythm games.

47:01.000 --> 47:02.000
God, I should have gone.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
Because I've actually played Beat Saber.

47:04.000 --> 47:06.000
Bobby saw me play a hard song in the vogs.

47:06.000 --> 47:07.000
Yeah.

47:07.000 --> 47:08.000
And I did okay on it.

47:08.000 --> 47:14.000
Like for the first, like having not played the game before, the only problem I had was hitting stuff the wrong way sometimes.

47:14.000 --> 47:19.000
But I mean, considering it's the first song I played and the first time I played the game.

47:19.000 --> 47:20.000
I don't know.

47:20.000 --> 47:21.000
I did okay.

47:21.000 --> 47:22.000
I got like a D.

47:22.000 --> 47:23.000
Meh, whatever.

47:23.000 --> 47:24.000
But it was fun.

47:24.000 --> 47:25.000
I had a lot of fun with it.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
My kids want me to get it now because they got to play it as well.

47:27.000 --> 47:28.000
So I was like, okay, fine.

47:28.000 --> 47:30.000
I got to buy this now.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
So yeah, I played that.

47:32.000 --> 47:35.000
And I mean, a lot of other stuff I'll get into later.

47:35.000 --> 47:36.000
A lot of indie games.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
But it was mainly just that.

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
And a little bit of Pokemon Go.

47:40.000 --> 47:42.000
I've been playing some of that.

47:42.000 --> 47:45.000
And yeah, not much in the console stuff.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
This week though, I probably will.

47:47.000 --> 47:50.000
Because there's some bigger games coming out that I've been looking forward to.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
That's it.

47:52.000 --> 47:53.000
I've been playing a lot.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
I can't fit everything in.

47:55.000 --> 47:59.000
Just because while I was flying on the plane, I played Mario Maker 2.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
I played some of the NES Classic Library.

48:01.000 --> 48:04.000
I played Diablo 3 for a little bit on Switch.

48:04.000 --> 48:08.000
But finally, the first time I played the Necromancer, I played at the Dragon Con arcade.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.000
I played some Neon FM.

48:10.000 --> 48:16.000
I had a friend of mine play Dance Dance Revolution for the very first time, mind you, at Dragon Con.

48:16.000 --> 48:17.000
So that was fun.

48:17.000 --> 48:18.000
So I played some DDR out of that.

48:18.000 --> 48:22.000
Oh, and I played DDR at a random arcade, Barcade, in North Carolina as well.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
Because there's a video on my Instagram or something of it.

48:24.000 --> 48:26.000
And it was fun.

48:26.000 --> 48:27.000
Because I was like, yeah, I'm 41.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
Dom Darian.

48:29.000 --> 48:30.000
So it was fun.

48:30.000 --> 48:36.000
And then various things at Dragon Con, like I mentioned Beat Saber.

48:36.000 --> 48:39.000
And I think I saw Bobby playing some Attica and stuff.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
And then I came home and I was playing things too.

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
I was still playing quite a bit of Final Fantasy XIV.

48:43.000 --> 48:46.000
A little bit of No Man's Sky as well.

48:46.000 --> 48:49.000
I know I was doing some streaming earlier this week.

48:49.000 --> 48:52.000
The main thing I think I want to talk about as far as games going and what I've been playing.

48:52.000 --> 48:57.000
I started playing World of Warcraft Classic, which came out...

48:57.000 --> 48:58.000
I'm sorry.

48:58.000 --> 49:02.000
It was like the Monday or Tuesday that I left, it came out.

49:02.000 --> 49:06.000
So it was when I was out visiting Extifer in North Carolina, that game came out.

49:06.000 --> 49:14.000
Which, by the way, I don't know if we have any listeners or folks out there that were impacted by Hurricane Dorian in North or South Carolina.

49:14.000 --> 49:19.000
But it was kind of eerie, the fact that I was out in Wilmington, North Carolina, in Cape Fear.

49:19.000 --> 49:22.000
I did an Ingress banner out in Cape Fear.

49:22.000 --> 49:26.000
It's an actual banner on my Ingress profile that says, Bye, Felicia.

49:26.000 --> 49:30.000
And it's actually in Wilmington, so that's kind of fun.

49:30.000 --> 49:33.000
So it was neat to be out there.

49:33.000 --> 49:36.000
We went to the beach side, so there's the cape side and the beach side.

49:36.000 --> 49:38.000
We went to the beach side, I was out of the pier.

49:38.000 --> 49:43.000
So it blows my mind to think that a week later, then this hurricane is coming.

49:43.000 --> 49:47.000
So again, just my thoughts to anybody that was impacted.

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Especially, of course, the Bahamas.

49:49.000 --> 49:52.000
We know we're impacted very, very seriously.

49:52.000 --> 49:59.000
Just thinking of anybody we know that may have been impacted by all that and hope all our folks are doing A-OK.

49:59.000 --> 50:03.000
Anyway, sorry, that just kind of sprung to mind when I was thinking about my trip to North Carolina.

50:03.000 --> 50:07.000
So I played World of Warcraft Classic, finally, when I got back.

50:07.000 --> 50:13.000
So luckily, the queues and all that stuff weren't an issue for me, because a lot of that died down.

50:13.000 --> 50:16.000
And I think they released some expansion servers.

50:16.000 --> 50:20.000
So my buddy Slagkick over at Game Buoy was like,

50:20.000 --> 50:24.000
you should play on old Blanchy, like Blanch from the Golden Girls.

50:24.000 --> 50:25.000
So we're on old Blanchy.

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
So I was like, all right, I'll play on old Blanchy.

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
And there's no queue over there, so it's fine.

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
So I rolled a Dwarf Priest.

50:31.000 --> 50:34.000
I don't want to hear the Alliance versus Horde thing.

50:34.000 --> 50:37.000
It's where they were on Alliance, so I win Alliance as well.

50:37.000 --> 50:43.000
I will do a Horde someday, but I've played both sides in the main game thoroughly throughout the years.

50:43.000 --> 50:46.000
I consider myself bi-factional.

50:46.000 --> 50:50.000
But I've been leveling a Dwarf Priest, and I think she's now up to level 11.

50:50.000 --> 50:53.000
I streamed the first seven levels or so.

50:53.000 --> 50:58.000
But anyway, to kind of make a long story short, and even Dark Soccer made a comment like, I'm sorry,

50:58.000 --> 51:03.000
and how when WoW Classic was first announced, I think there were some of us that were like,

51:03.000 --> 51:09.000
why are people begging for this game that had no quality of life things in it whatsoever?

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
And are people really going to appreciate it and so forth?

51:11.000 --> 51:16.000
And I've got to say, now that I've spent a couple hours with WoW Classic, I'm going to put it this way.

51:16.000 --> 51:19.000
I like it more than I thought I would. I do.

51:19.000 --> 51:26.000
There's something about the slow burn and the fact that you really do have to earn those levels

51:26.000 --> 51:35.000
and that maybe the difficulty is a little bit harder because you get into situations where you're pulling one mob

51:35.000 --> 51:38.000
and if you're not careful, another one's going to add and that's it, you're going to die.

51:38.000 --> 51:41.000
And some of that they made easier in the later games.

51:41.000 --> 51:45.000
So I'm not saying easy equals bad, I'm not saying that at all,

51:45.000 --> 51:49.000
but I think I am starting to understand a little bit more maybe the challenge side of it

51:49.000 --> 51:54.000
and for the gaming audience that does like to play games on challenging and very hard,

51:54.000 --> 52:02.000
perhaps that WoW Classic has some of that for them and that's what they were missing maybe a little bit

52:02.000 --> 52:05.000
when WoW started to get all the quality of life upgrades to it.

52:05.000 --> 52:10.000
Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not going to be leaving Final Fantasy XIV for this

52:10.000 --> 52:17.000
and if regular Warcraft releases a new expansion, I'd kind of rather take a look at that for a little bit and so forth.

52:17.000 --> 52:24.000
But is WoW Classic like the, I don't know, is WoW Classic the like flash in the pan I thought it would be?

52:24.000 --> 52:30.000
Not necessarily. I do think they're going to run into a problem where all these people bombarded it early on

52:30.000 --> 52:37.000
and I think that well will dry up after a couple months when regular WoW releases a new expansion

52:37.000 --> 52:43.000
or after BlizzCon happens and something kind of draws all the Blizzard fans back to another product.

52:43.000 --> 52:48.000
I hope Blizzard has a strategy for how they're going to consolidate old servers

52:48.000 --> 52:52.000
because I just feel like that's something that's going to happen with WoW Classic, but I don't know.

52:52.000 --> 53:01.000
Also, I would like to see WoW Classic progress like Burning Crusade and like Wrath of the Lich King

53:01.000 --> 53:04.000
because I really think Wrath of the Lich King was like peak World of Warcraft

53:04.000 --> 53:10.000
and I'd like to see it maybe progress to that point and then maybe be frozen in time there.

53:10.000 --> 53:15.000
But not everybody would agree with me. Some folks think it might be a little too easy mode at that point as well.

53:15.000 --> 53:20.000
I don't know, but I think it would be fun if I could take this character maybe a little bit further

53:20.000 --> 53:23.000
and still experience some of that WoW expansion stuff a little later on.

53:23.000 --> 53:27.000
But WoW Classic, I liked it more than I thought I would

53:27.000 --> 53:32.000
and I think I understand a little more why people were into it, but I'm not sure.

53:32.000 --> 53:39.000
It's neat that it's there. It's neat. That's it. And that's kind of like where it ends.

53:39.000 --> 53:45.000
I think it's not the MMO I'm going to play solely by any means. That's for sure.

53:46.000 --> 53:54.000
Anyway, looking at comments from chat, Bobby Blackwolf says, Rob tried the Valve Index.

53:54.000 --> 54:00.000
I did. I played Beat Saber on that device and that was the one where the little ear pieces kind of float

54:00.000 --> 54:03.000
and the sound on that was really good.

54:03.000 --> 54:08.000
Playing Beat Saber on that felt a lot better than it does playing it on PlayStation 4.

54:08.000 --> 54:12.000
Maybe that's what I played it on. I don't remember. It was a blue headset. I don't remember what that is.

54:12.000 --> 54:13.000
Did it have little floating earbuds?

54:13.000 --> 54:18.000
It did have the earbuds that kind of slide or whatever, like the ear headphones almost.

54:18.000 --> 54:23.000
Sounds like it, but Bobby is better at telling all those things apart than I am.

54:23.000 --> 54:27.000
No, the one I played on was really nice. The controls were kind of neat too.

54:27.000 --> 54:36.000
It wasn't a Vive of some sort, so I don't know if it was the Index or if it was the HTC Vive or something like that.

54:36.000 --> 54:39.000
I don't know, but it was nice.

54:40.000 --> 54:43.000
And Bobby says the HTC Vive Pro is blue.

54:43.000 --> 54:46.000
So it's probably the Vive Pro that I played on then.

54:46.000 --> 54:49.000
Alright, but that was my gaming week. That's enough to talk about.

54:49.000 --> 54:54.000
I'll mention one other thing. Harry Potter, Wizards Unite, I'm still playing a little bit of that.

54:54.000 --> 55:00.000
And the reason why I brought it up is because they had the whole Day of the Dragons thing happen on Saturday.

55:00.000 --> 55:06.000
And as much as I understand there's some people that are kind of over that game already because the tracing kind of gets repetitive,

55:06.000 --> 55:12.000
I will say the Day of the Dragons event they did was probably better than any Community Day event that they've done.

55:12.000 --> 55:20.000
Because those dragons gave big XP and you really felt, and then by collecting them you were able to get a lot of scrolls.

55:20.000 --> 55:24.000
So I felt a lot of progression during that event.

55:24.000 --> 55:28.000
Whereas the last couple of Community Day events I thought were kind of, like they weren't that great.

55:28.000 --> 55:32.000
So I will say, you know, game companies should get props and they do things well.

55:32.000 --> 55:37.000
So I thought that Dragon Day event was actually one of the better Harry Potter events.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
So I'm glad I got to spend a little time doing that.

55:39.000 --> 55:43.000
It just worked out that way. My car was being worked on yesterday.

55:43.000 --> 55:47.000
So Alan came to get me and we went out to the Palladio out in Folsom.

55:47.000 --> 55:50.000
And we were, because that's a good place for Pokemon Go and all that stuff too.

55:50.000 --> 55:54.000
So we were playing the Harry Potter game out there and able to do some trapping.

55:54.000 --> 55:55.000
So it was good.

55:56.000 --> 56:00.000
Before we get into the news tonight, I'll mention something a little bit on a personal note.

56:00.000 --> 56:04.000
Because I wasn't able to talk about this the last time we did a show.

56:04.000 --> 56:09.000
Because we taped that show on a Thursday night to air that Sunday, right?

56:09.000 --> 56:13.000
Which again, thanks to those of you guys that showed up or listened to the podcast or what have you to 790.

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
Which we'd actually done a little bit in advance.

56:15.000 --> 56:21.000
So I have not been able to talk about that the day after we taped that show.

56:21.000 --> 56:26.000
I actually gave my two weeks notice to my prior job because I am starting a new job on Monday.

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
So that's my little kind of like personal thing.

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
So that's also why I want to go shopping.

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
Because it's fun to start a new job and new clothes.

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
So that was a big part of it.

56:34.000 --> 56:37.000
So I don't work in the gaming industry.

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
I don't do anything related to gaming stuff.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
And I kind of like to keep my personal stuff private.

56:41.000 --> 56:45.000
Just especially how volatile things on social media can be and things like that.

56:45.000 --> 56:50.000
I think I've said on the show before, I'm in the field of corporate training.

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
Like I teach people how to do their jobs and stuff like that.

56:52.000 --> 56:55.000
So I talk all day long as well as on Sunday nights.

56:55.000 --> 56:59.000
But obviously I try to keep my professional life, my personal life very separate.

56:59.000 --> 57:05.000
And I've been working in the health insurance industry for the past 18 years.

57:05.000 --> 57:09.000
So I'm not going to be working exactly that industry anymore.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
It's similar but not the same.

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
That's all I'm going to say about that.

57:13.000 --> 57:14.000
So it's kind of a big change for me.

57:14.000 --> 57:15.000
So I'm a little bit like eek.

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
But really excited about it.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
I post about it on Twitter and stuff.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
So thanks for all the kind words.

57:21.000 --> 57:24.000
But I wanted to say something about it here because it's going to be a big change.

57:24.000 --> 57:25.000
So there you go.

57:25.000 --> 57:28.000
Anyhow, let's move on.

57:28.000 --> 57:35.000
Let's get into some gaming news now that we're this far into the show here.

57:35.000 --> 57:38.000
Let's actually talk about some things that have gone on this week in the gaming world.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
Besides just the Nintendo Direct.

57:40.000 --> 57:43.000
This is something we don't quite know all about yet.

57:43.000 --> 57:46.000
And it wasn't part of the Nintendo Direct.

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
It was a separate type of teaser.

57:48.000 --> 57:53.000
So they had a teaser that it was for this new experience for Nintendo Switch.

57:53.000 --> 58:00.000
And it definitely looks like a sort of fitness style app or fitness thing that they're going to be offering for the Nintendo Switch.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
Kind of like a Wii Fit type of thing.

58:02.000 --> 58:08.000
So what it includes is they basically have a strap for one of the joy cons that goes around your leg.

58:09.000 --> 58:16.000
And then they have this kind of resistance band circle thing that you kind of squeeze in.

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
And I've actually seen something like that before.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
Like some sort of fitness stuff.

58:20.000 --> 58:25.000
It's basically for resistance training or whatever that you put the other joy con in.

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
And using that you do different...

58:27.000 --> 58:30.000
I think it guides you through different exercises and stuff like that.

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
Or different games.

58:32.000 --> 58:37.000
So right now it's a teaser because we're going to get the full announcement on Thursday.

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
And figure out what's going on with it.

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
But it looks interesting.

58:41.000 --> 58:44.000
More crap I get to have in my house for the Switch.

58:46.000 --> 58:49.000
Is Thursday the same day Apple's doing their phone announcement?

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
Or is that Tuesday?

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
It's Tuesday.

58:53.000 --> 58:57.000
Tuesday is the press thing.

58:57.000 --> 59:00.000
You know how sometimes Apple does their thing the same day as E3?

59:00.000 --> 59:03.000
And it's kind of like, it's too much tech news today.

59:03.000 --> 59:06.000
I'm glad they're on separate days next week. Sorry.

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
And then we have Tokyo Game Show later this week too.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
Never mind.

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
That's the same day as the fitness stuff.

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
Oh, so this is what Nintendo's doing instead.

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
Because we know Nintendo doesn't do Tokyo Game Show.

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
So maybe this is their way.

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
Okay, okay, interesting.

59:20.000 --> 59:24.000
This is the way to sell the Switch units to your mom.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
For the moms out there.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
I mean...

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
I say that.

59:30.000 --> 59:33.000
If we want to go stereotypes, the soccer mom, sure.

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
I only say that because...

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
I mean, that's what's pictured.

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
Sure, look what's highlighted in the commercial.

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
Granted, they also had, you know...

59:41.000 --> 59:45.000
Stereotypical dads as well doing yoga.

59:45.000 --> 59:48.000
It's funny because uncoordinated dads trying to do yoga.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
Hahaha.

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
Hilarious.

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
I guess we'll find out more about it.

59:54.000 --> 59:59.000
But yeah, it looks like they're going to try to do something similar to Wii Fit.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Thank God I don't have to buy a balance board.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Maybe it'll support the balance board.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
God knows it's just taking up space in my garage.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Why do we think they walked away from Wii Fit?

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Assuming this is a fitness thing.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
I mean, it has to be, right?

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
It looks like a fitness thing.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Why are they shifting away from Wii Fit?

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Why not do a new version of Wii Fit?

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Because I think Wii Fit was just basically a weight sensor.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:28.000
So there wasn't necessarily much you could do with it.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Aside from just kind of standing on it.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000
It did detect your balance a little bit.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.000
But I think this, there's more exercises that you could do.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:40.000
With the sensor positioning, with the two different joy cons.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000
I think there's more that they can capture as far as what you're doing.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
I don't know.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
It's also smaller.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Because I know the Wii Fit balance board was just this monstrous thing that would take up a ton of space.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
I think that also might be it.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.000
I think they might be tapping into one of the key features of the Switch.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Which is that it's portable.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:07.000
And so this resistance thing kind of looks like it might unclamp or whatever it holds it together.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
And maybe ends up being very portable.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.000
And obviously that thing that goes around the leg is going to be very portable as well.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000
So they've come up with some type of solution that is portable as well as the Switch.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
And I think that's very important, certainly.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.000
I mean, as much as I'm like, oh it would be nice if they would reuse some old technology.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.000
I can see where the Wii balance board is hard to go into.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Although when I did see them squeezing the resistance band thing like rapidly or whatever.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:33.000
It just reminded me of the shake weight a little bit.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
We'll have to see what it is.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Nifty805 in chat says the Switch fitness thing might actually get me in shape for Pride season or not.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Well you've got a good ten months to go.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
How about get in shape for yourself?

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Yeah, do something for yourself.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Do for you.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Screw those judgy hoes at Pride.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Since it is like a resistance band, they had something that looked like you were firing bow and arrow.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:02.000
So you were holding one end of it with your one hand and the other end you're kind of pulling back.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
And there's a little bit of resistance that way.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:11.000
So there might be some interesting game experiences here that aren't just like Woohoo Island mini games.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.000
And you remember Woohoo Island was the Wii Fit and Wii Sports and all that.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
All that universe was all there.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Yeah, so it looks like they have yoga stuff.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:25.000
They've got some other movement things that they're doing, stretching.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Do you think the fact that they...

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Okay, look at the way this trailer is put together where they're like Madrid, Rome, Dallas.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
And they're highlighting all these cities.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Do you think that maybe this fitness around the world is a theme to what it is?

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Maybe.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
It's going to be like something around the world?

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Nintendo Fit world or something?

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:52.000
I feel like there's a reason why they've built this the way that they did.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
I don't know. Maybe I'm tinfoil-hatting a little bit.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:02.000
But I feel like something around like the whole world does this together is some sort of key thing about what the product is.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Maybe.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Anyway.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:09.000
It says we'll find out more September 12th in the course.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.000
It is tied around Tokyo Game Show.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.000
So by this time next week when we're on the show we'll know a little more about what this specifically is.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
So we'll talk more about it then.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Let's say Bobby Blackwolf in chat says my wife immediately said now we got to buy another doc so we can put it in our workout room,

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:30.000
which is where our Wii is hooked up for Wii Fit and EA Active, which still get played.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:36.000
SG100Matt says my girlfriend hasn't seen this device yet, but I'm sure when she does she'll get it as well.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Questbuster says...

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Oh, I like this comment a lot.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Questbuster says it looks like it could be something useful for hospitals too, like physical rehab.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:51.000
And remember how we used to have all those stories about, you know, the senior citizens home does Wii Fit bowling...

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.000
or not Wii Fit, but Nintendo Wii bowling tournaments.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.000
And I'm sure when Wii Fit was out that kind of got coverage in some of those as well.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Or what they'll say is like, you know what?

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:05.000
The average adult working at a very sedentary job, guess what?

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.000
You can bring your Nintendo Switch with you and you can do a workout on your break.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Just a really quick office workout to kind of stretch out and do all that little like...

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000
I can see them...

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Work out wherever you go. That's it.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.000
It's because of all these... It's workout wherever you go.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
That's going to be the theme.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Yes.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Mark, we're going to play that clip back.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Clip it and play it back in a week.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.000
That's going to be what it is.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000
It's good.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
And that's a workout wherever you go.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000
No matter wherever in the world you are, you've got this.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
You can workout.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000
You've got a gym with you.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
That's what it's going to be.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000
A wonderful...

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
W-E-R-K workout.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:45.000
I wonder if they'll tie it in with a phone app or something like that.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Honestly, Dark Soccer, wouldn't that be the better marketing campaign?

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Is for Michelle Visage to pop out of the corner and go,

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
You better work.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000
I'd be all about that.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
I know, but then she would go back and say,

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Stop relying on that body-ody-ody.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Alright, let's see.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Kaijuto in chat says,

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000
The reason they showed Greece is because it's going to be an Olympic event.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Well, aren't the next Olympics in Paris?

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Well, sorry, Tokyo.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000
No, Tokyo is 2020.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000
My bad.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Tokyo is 2020.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Paris is 2024.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000
So...

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000
And then did LA finally get a Games?

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000
I feel like that's a thing.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Like, 2028, LA finally has one.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.000
I don't...

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Maybe.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000
I say finally.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.000
They were there in like 1984.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
But how long ago was that, right?

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.000
It's been a little while.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.000
So, anyway.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Alright, moving on.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Let's get into another story.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000
So, we already kind of touched on that thing I was going to talk about

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000
with the NES and SNES updates.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Sorry.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000
No, that's fine.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000
We talked about it.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
So, we can change up the order when we want, Loki.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000
It's okay.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Alright.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000
So, we'll move on to DarkSakura,

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
who has something about a game I was talking about.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
I was buying a webcam, sorry.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Just now you bought a webcam?

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000
No.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
Well, I'm actually going to get one on Wish.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Okay.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Because I've gotten tripods and things on Wish.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000
I've bought wigs.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
I bought a wig stand.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Like, I'll see what a $5 webcam is going to do.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
What a $5 webcam is going to do is $5.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.000
That's, what, three tacos?

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Mm-hmm.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Depending.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Maybe two if you go to a good place.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
They'll just get a PlayStation Eye.

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
If you go to the taco place Alan and I went to for brunch,

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.000
the Paladio would be a taco and a half, if that.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Well, actually, we do still have our...

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.000
What was the Xbox one?

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
The vision camera or the Kinect?

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000
The Kinect.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
We still have a Kinect somewhere in a box.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
I will say this really quickly before you get to the story.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Speaking of upgrades and things we want to do.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:41.000
You and I getting mic stands for these things to cut out.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Because I did not realize how bad the shaky shake noise is

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
when we pick up and put down these things.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Mm-hmm.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
It's really bad because these things are sensitive

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.000
and I've tried doing some rebalancing.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.000
It's not working.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.000
But if you and I had stands,

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
I think it would get rid of a lot of that.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Shopping trip on Thursday?

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
No, because I had the new job.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.000
That's right.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Shopping trick next week.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.000
I'm going to set a realistic goal.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:08.000
Before episode 800, we're going to make some big changes to OLR.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Because I've got other stuff on my brain too

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.000
that I didn't talk to you guys about.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
But not bad or anything.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Change is good.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
We're just going to zhuzh it up.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.000
We're just going to zhuzh it up a little around here.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.000
That's all.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000
I'm giving Rob the scrunch face.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
You'll like it, I think.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
What if I said it's less work for you?

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000
I like work.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Okay.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Well, good.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000
You can...

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000
We'll do more.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Good.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
You can get me my B-roll every week.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Girl.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Hey, I provided B-roll this week.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.000
You did.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Look, Loki did provide B-roll this week.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000
We just haven't got to it yet.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
You can just do B-rolls of me playing The Sims.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Alright, moving on.

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Like, look at this bitch.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
This bitch needs, like, a butt.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Anyway, World of Warcraft classic.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000
I have nightmares, though, about fucking World of Warcraft.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.000
The old days when you had to level up everything.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Oh my god.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Anyway, they were actually, though, getting DDOS attacks.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:07.000
It started happening around 11 AM.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
I'm trying to get the date on this one.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Yesterday?

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
A couple days ago?

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000
No, September 7th.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
So that was yesterday for us.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.000
At any rate, there was...

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
It looks like they might have narrowed it down to who did it.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
It was at UK Drilas.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Which, I mean, whatever.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000
I'm sure you now think you've got the biggest dick in the world.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.000
But really, it's just the one that shoved up your own ass, I don't know.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
That's not really a real dick.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Anyway.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.000
I mean, if you were into that, some people could use it.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
But anyway, moving forward.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:48.000
At any rate, they put up a post saying that about every 20 to 30 minutes

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000
they were going to attack the US PvP WoW server.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.000
And so the servers did go down.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.000
They posted more as the day went on.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:04.000
But Blizzard did a post that, as of yesterday at 6.10 PM,

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
doesn't say what time zone,

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:11.000
that all the WoW realms except Rattle Gore were back online and stable.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
And that they are continuing to investigate

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:17.000
and they have some players that might still experience persistent login issues

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
until the maintenance finishes.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000
But yeah.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Because somebody is uppity and trying to be a shit.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Stop being a shit.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
It hasn't affected me on Classic WoW Fortsworth,

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.000
but I'm not on a PvP server.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Old Blanchey's PvE.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.000
I'm not going to level a fucking priest,

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
an alliance priest on a PvP server.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.000
That is hard mode, boys and girls.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Level a priest on a PvP server.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000
You know what?

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.000
What?

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.000
I've done it.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.000
How far?

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
You didn't get to 60.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Actually, yeah I did.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.000
It was when I was playing with...

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
I'm armoring that fucking character right now.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.000
What was the name?

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
When? Where? How? What?

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
No, because I deleted him.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.000
No, I didn't get it to 60.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
I got it to 45.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.000
That's pretty good.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.000
And it was when I was playing on...

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.000
God, one of my coworkers wanted me to play on their server.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:16.000
I mean, I hardly remember all of my character's names

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000
because how many fucking characters did I have?

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:21.000
I only remember Rebecca Black, your paladin.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
You remember Erisa?

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Oh yeah, that's right.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.000
My goat.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Not until you say...

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.000
How can I forget Rebecca Black?

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.000
But Rebecca Black was the best.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Rebecca Black's probably like fucking 21 at this point.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
I have that screenshot.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000
Oh no, she's older than that.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
She actually did another song too.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.000
But I had a screenshot of some dude following me around in...

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:44.000
What was that place in Outworld or Outland or whatever.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Oh.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.000
That was really pretty.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Negrand.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.000
Negrand, yeah.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Follow me around Negrand, making up lyrics to Friday,

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.000
following my character around.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
And I have screenshots of it.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.000
But anyway.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.000
SSG100Matt says, Rob is demanding receipts.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:01.000
I don't have to prove anything to anybody.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Don't gatekeep me.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
You know, that actually...

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
I'll bring this up as a later topic,

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:14.000
but a big con thing is that when a woman dresses as a geeky character,

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.000
you know, either in a video game or from a comic book,

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.000
then some dude's gonna pop out out of the bushes.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Even if it's inside the hotel, a bush will appear

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:26.000
and some gatekeeping bro dude is gonna pop out,

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.000
quizzing this woman on everything she fucking knows about the game.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Should I be concerned that Mr. Smoosh just walked in here?

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000
And I think Mr. Smoosh has this look on his face of,

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000
well, actually...

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Mr. Smoosh is not a gatekeeping bro dude.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
Not all cats.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.000
And I want to encourage every woman listening right now,

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
if some guy comes up to you at a con and does that,

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.000
just say, I don't got shit to prove to you.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Do it.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
We don't have to defend ourselves.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Anyway.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000
Can I say on the whole, like, you know, I don't know,

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.000
stereotypical gender thing.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Can I mention one thing about Dragon Con?

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.000
No, I think this is a good thing.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
It's a very good thing.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:05.000
Is that, you know, a lot of times,

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:09.000
women who wear costumes that are revealing

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.000
are branded slutatious or whatever you want to say.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.000
We all know that's crap.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Well, right. I'm not saying I support that,

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:20.000
but I was just, I'm very impressed and happy

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.000
to see that more men and a lot,

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:26.000
like just even in the seven years I've been going to Dragon Con,

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
like this year at Dragon Con,

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:33.000
the men are fully participating on a similar level at this point.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:38.000
We have, like, it started with Final Fantasy 14 armor

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
and we're seeing it play out in person.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.000
The leather underwear?

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Yes, the men can be just as slutatious or whatever.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.000
This show is sponsored by Sublegar.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Out of curiosity, did you see a gender-bent Winter Soldier?

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Do you know how many fucking costumes I saw last weekend?

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Well, I'm just saying because one of my favorite podcasters

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.000
was cosplaying at Dragon Con with that costume.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Here's the problem, Darsagra.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000
I'm pretty sure I did, but more than one.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Well, I just want to say if it ever gets back,

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.000
shout out to Annie at Stuff Mom Never Told You.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:21.000
I love having other podcasting women who cosplay.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Do you know who else was there cosplaying,

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
just fully out, walking the convention, but in full cosplay

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.000
so nobody knew who he was? T-Pain was there.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Oh yeah, he had the, he put the costume up of the,

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
Leroy, what's his face?

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:36.000
He was a Tekken character, yeah, Leroy from Tekken.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.000
So yeah, I love that.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:42.000
And Jamie Lee Curtis does the same thing at BlizzCon,

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.000
but she does the full-on mask because nobody, right?

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.000
He had makeup and was very made-over.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:52.000
And I don't know, the last time I remember seeing T-Pain,

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.000
he was on that show with all the costumes anyway.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.000
He won that show with the Masked Singer.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:01.000
He won that because T-Pain can fucking sing.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Have you heard T-Pain?

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.000
I know people give him shit for the whole auto-tune

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.000
because he kind of brought that into, he can fucking sing.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.000
That was impressive. Anyway, tangent.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Anyway, anyway, I know that went from wow, but just like,

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.000
I'm kind of on this hair trigger now because I've been trying

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.000
to get my stuff back together to start cosplaying again.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.000
And it's, it happens online.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
It happens in person. It's just bullshit.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.000
You know what's interesting is I was on a panel,

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:37.000
I think the Twitch 102 panel, and we had a very high-level

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
cosplayer on that panel on the Twitch 102.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:43.000
She actually won the cosplay thing at the last TwitchCon.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000
She's very good at what she does.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.000
And I remember making a comment about how one of my friends

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:50.000
said DragonCon is kind of like the Super Bowl of cosplay.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.000
And she said, in her opinion, she kind of felt KatsuCon

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:57.000
was the Super Bowl of cosplay because she thought DragonCon

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:01.000
was kind of like an everybody can do cosplay sort of thing,

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:04.000
where it's like, and I don't think she meant it in a way

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
like that, I know when I repeat it, it makes it sound like,

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.000
oh, DragonCon is like the amateurs and KatsuCon is the pro.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.000
She didn't mean it like that at all.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:13.000
DragonCon's more like the buffet.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000
I think it is that like at DragonCon, it's like, no,

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.000
you fucking cosplay, no matter how good or bad you are,

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:22.000
you just fucking put on a costume and have fun and go to it.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Whereas I think maybe like KatsuCon probably just because

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:29.000
KatsuCon has more, and I think I can totally see her comment

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
in context of like the masquerade.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Well, it's her past anime expo for anime costumes.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Yeah, the masquerade at DragonCon is like,

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
we watch it and drink and make fun of it, okay?

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.000
It's not, I think if you compare the two masquerades,

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:46.000
then her comment makes complete sense in that context

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:50.000
because it's the masquerade there and probably KatsuCon's masquerade.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Granted, I haven't been to KatsuCon since they,

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
they used to be at a different hotel in DC.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:56.000
They're at the Gaylord.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:59.000
The last cosplay contest I was in was hosted by Trixie Mattel.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Yeah, it's been a while.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
With my Grey Warden.

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
So anyway, but my point is, Dark Sakura,

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:08.000
this whole like cosplay thing, I really,

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
I know it's a long way to go,

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:13.000
but I also know you miss the South sometimes.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
You got to come to DragonCon some year.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
Well, the next year, you know what I'm doing

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:20.000
when DragonCon's going on, it's the same weekend as my anniversary.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.000
Oh, yeah.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
So Dan and I are going to New Orleans.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Okay, fair, fair.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
I mean, I could try to say you want to go to DragonCon

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
and then go to New Orleans.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
But you're going to get snow.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
But no, we have a plan.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Next year's 15, we're going to go to New Orleans

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.000
and hang out in Jackson Square for a bit

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.000
and then go visit the family in Mobile.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
So.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.000
All right.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.000
Maybe.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Are they still doing Mobicon?

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
I have to find out they're still doing Mobicon

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.000
because I would go back to that.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
I love the small conventions.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000
Yeah, but S200 Matt says swing both.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.000
I did North Carolina and Atlanta one trip

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
but granted, I was gone forever.

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
I feel like I aged while I was gone

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.000
but I had a great time.

01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Time of my life.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.000
Anyway, the little bar says we're still talking about World of Warcraft.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.000
Clearly, that's a lie.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
So let's level set with our next story.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.000
Loki.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.000
Yes, let's talk about Steam

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
and how they're making some changes.

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:13.000
So there was some, I want to say this is stuff

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:17.000
that they had like mock-ups that leaked out or whatever

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.000
but then they also had these like beta programs you can go into.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.000
So now there's going to be a whole new change to your library

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
that's going to have lots more pictures and stuff.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:30.000
So they're going to have basically showing different activity

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
with recent games you played,

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
new games that are out,

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
games that your friends are playing,

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.000
and other categories as well.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
So it's kind of cool.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:45.000
So with that, they also have like,

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:49.000
there'll be stuff that's populated based on what developers

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.000
and friends are up to.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:54.000
They've got different collections that you can drop your games into

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
to kind of organize them.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.000
I'm hoping that there's a, well,

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:02.000
maybe it might not be helpful with games you haven't played yet

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:06.000
because that's going to be most of my library.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
But yeah, a lot more content.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Definitely going to be looking more updated.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Now when this is actually going to go into place,

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:19.000
I'm not really sure, but I know that

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
they had some more stuff that,

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
I think there was part of that Steam Labs stuff

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:27.000
that they're going to start incorporating into it as well.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
But it looks interesting.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:32.000
I'm looking forward to a refresh of my Steam library

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:35.000
because it's kind of been looking that way.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Steam has kind of had the same look for a very long time.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.000
Yes.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
So I'm kind of happy that they're going to, you know,

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:44.000
kind of re-approach it and make some changes

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:47.000
and kind of freshen up the way your game library looks.

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
It's time to kind of take another approach.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
I mean, it's kind of a bummer it's not the store

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
because I feel like the store is just like a blah.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
We have games.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:58.000
It's just like this big barf of games all over

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
and it's hard to find really anything.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
And they try to make it custom to like,

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
because you play this, you be into this.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:07.000
But I feel like there really needs to be a switch

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.000
because sometimes I don't want you to tell me

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
what you think I'd like.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
I want to see what is everybody else playing

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.000
or what's the featured thing, what's the new indie hotness,

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.000
those types of things.

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
I feel like the way the Steam store is right now

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.000
is kind of a mess.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
But I'm glad they're going to update the library a little bit.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:26.000
And that might have to do with the What's New stuff.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
So it looks like the What's New is kind of covering

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:34.000
different games that you may have had updates to them.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
So I don't know.

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
It looks interesting. I'm looking forward to it.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Okay.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
We have another, our next story is also about Steam.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:45.000
This one comes to us from Discord.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:50.000
From our user on Discord, 13x4ever sent us an FYI on Discord.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
By the way, if you want to join the VoG Network Discord,

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000
you sure can.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:57.000
vognetwork.com, vognetwork.com slash Discord

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.000
is the place to get an invite.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:02.000
And we do want to work in more story submissions from Discord.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
I've already kind of been using them

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
and like thinking about what to plan out for the show.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
But I haven't been very good at saying,

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.000
this person submitted this and wants us to talk about it.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
So I'm going to be better about that in the future.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.000
So I have two Discord stories tonight.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.000
This is the first.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
Because it's not really a story, it's a tweet.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
But it's a tweet worth talking about.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:23.000
So 13x4ever linked us this tweet from a Twitter user named Watsu,

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
underscore Watsu, who said,

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Steam is changing their contract to guarantee devs

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:32.000
will release their games alongside other PC platforms

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:35.000
because people were pulling out to Epic Games Store

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:38.000
while still using the Steam page and forums

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:42.000
to communicate with players because EGS has none of those, LMAO.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
That's the tweet from Watsu.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.000
That is kind of lame.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
That is super lame.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
And it's one of those things where I'm like, wow.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:52.000
No, and super lame that Epic doesn't have that

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
and that developers are doing that.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Like, I actually think Steam is totally...

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.000
It's gaming.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
This is business.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Yeah, you want all of this.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Well, then you got to go for that.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
You have to take that with knowing that

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
you're not going to have this and this and this feature.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
So you got to weigh that.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.000
I think this is a great...

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
With as much shit as I've given Steam over the years,

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
rightfully so in my opinion,

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:18.000
this is a good moving the chess piece

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
in another direction type of thing

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
to balance some of all these devs

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
taking the oodles and oodles of money

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
that the Epic Store is offering them

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:29.000
and then turning around and using the Steam forums for support.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
I'm sorry, that is pretty fucking old.

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
You're paying for a lot of money for all these Epic exclusives

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
that are these big AAA titles you get.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:38.000
I don't know, put that money into developing these features.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Yeah. Well, let me just read the passage.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
So Watsu, and again, I read a tweet from Watsu.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
I don't want to own those words.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
Watsu wrote that tweet and deserves the credit.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:49.000
But in the tweet, there's a screenshot of the updated passage

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:53.000
from the Steam distribution agreement under Valve.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
So it reads like this.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
Where's our lawyers in the house?

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Any lawyers in the house?

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
OK, how many of you watch a lot of Law & Order at least?

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
All right, anyway, here it is.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
The legalese from the Steam distribution agreement.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
2.1, delivery.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:09.000
Companies shall submit the applications to Steam for release

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:12.000
no later than the first commercial release of each application

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.000
or localized version, or if already commercially released

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:19.000
as of the effective date within 30 days of the effective date.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.000
Thereafter, companies shall submit to Steam

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:25.000
any localized version and application updates

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
in beta and final form when available,

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:30.000
but in no event later than they are provided

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.000
to any other third party for commercial release.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Companies shall provide these copies in object code form

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:40.000
in whatever format Valve reasonably requests.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.000
So it's kind of one of those,

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
if you're going to update on these other platforms,

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:51.000
you're basically agreeing you're going to update on ours as well.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
So you can't just yank off the store

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
and now go release on the Epic Store

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
because they're throwing money at you.

01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:00.000
I think that's a pretty interesting thing they're doing.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Like, it don't work that way.

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Yeah, so Valve putting the fist down on that.

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:08.000
So we'll see what their next move ends up being after this.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.000
It's basically the guarantee of don't be a dick.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Well, it's...

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:18.000
But is taking money that someone is throwing at you being a dick?

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.000
I mean...

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:23.000
But manipulating, you know, it's like...

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:27.000
When you break up with somebody,

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:31.000
but you date other people, but you still live with them.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Make sense?

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Yes.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
It's really, really dickly.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:38.000
I think it's less like targeted devs themselves

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
and more of like, hey, listen Epic Games,

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:43.000
you can't just lean on our features that we have,

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
like our forms and stuff,

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:49.000
just because you're not, you know...

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.000
You can't just like,

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
oh, hey, we're going to offer you guys money

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.000
to come to our platform,

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
but if you want, you know, all that stuff,

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
you can just use the Steam forums for that, you know,

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.000
because we just haven't built it yet,

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
or we haven't built a shopping cart yet or anything else.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
You can't lean on them for that stuff.

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:03.000
You got to develop your own stuff

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
if you want this platform to be successful.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Can we do things a little out of order here, actually,

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
because the next logical follow-up to this,

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
now that this is playing out live,

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
I think we have to go to your next story, Loki,

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.000
and talk about this.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.000
I'm going to jump to...

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
We'll come back to what you had, Dark Soccer,

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:22.000
because this is like a super logical follow-up to this story.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
So speaking of Epic Games,

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:27.000
so they've had to change their roadmap a little bit,

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.000
because apparently they haven't hit some of their promises,

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
their targets that they had put out there.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:38.000
So, for example, they had, you know,

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:41.000
they had actually promised to do a few things.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:46.000
So one of those was they had a public Trello board

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
that showcased their roadmap

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
of different features that were coming out.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:54.000
And with that, they had to actually change some things.

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
So the Trello roadmap is not fulfilling the goal

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:59.000
we had set when we had introduced it.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:01.000
The goal with the Trello roadmap

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
is to provide visibility to the development cycle

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:06.000
for the store's more player-centric feature set.

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:10.000
While it's accomplished that to some degree,

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.000
we have missed the mark,

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:14.000
accurately displaying that timeline for feature delivery.

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:17.000
We regularly delay feature releases

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:22.000
due to shifting priorities and need for further iteration.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:26.000
We're always focusing on improving,

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:29.000
and we believe that Trello can be improved as well.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:32.000
So apparently, though,

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:35.000
they've had some stuff missed from that.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:38.000
So big items that are on their future development

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:42.000
include wish lists, a shopping cart, automated refunds,

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.000
gifting, achievements, and user reviews,

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.000
kind of, you know, with the bare bones functionality

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
for a storefront.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:54.000
Well, I'd be curious which of these things happen first.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
I mean, I'm sure we could look at the dates or whatever,

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
but it is very interesting that this is happening

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:01.000
around the same time as Steam makes this counter move

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
because it's almost like Epic is missing these marks,

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:06.000
and now Steam is putting their iron fist down saying,

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
well, you're not going to be using us

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:09.000
as your Band-Aid for this.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000
If you can't deliver on this to your people,

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000
then fuck off type of thing, you know?

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.000
That's kind of like what I'm getting from it.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
I'm not saying one led to the other or what have you,

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
but it's just, you know, it is interesting

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.000
that these are timed right around the same week, you know?

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Yeah, so some things that they're talking about,

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:29.000
like I'm looking at their like development

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
and stuff that they've got.

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:34.000
So stuff that they've said they've recently shipped.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:37.000
They've had improved patch sizes,

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:41.000
the store page redesign, store video hosting,

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:45.000
humble bundle integration, that's pretty much it.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:48.000
Up next they have, it says Ubisoft titles

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.000
require large installs, library list view,

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:56.000
player playtime tracking, storefront discovery.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.000
I mean, I don't know, there's not a lot of stuff

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:00.000
on their storefront.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.000
Curated collections, trending, price protection,

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:06.000
mod support for games, stuff that's still out there

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.000
in future development.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Of course, we mentioned the wish list, shopping cart,

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:12.000
automated refunds, gifting, social overall,

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:16.000
direct carrier billing, achievements,

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
additional payment methods.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Just like, I don't know, it's very bare bones right now,

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.000
but I get it, you know, like developers are getting

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
more money and where that is, you know,

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:29.000
it is a good thing for smaller developers.

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:32.000
You also have to weigh in the fact that there's

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:35.000
a lot of community features that are built into

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.000
the Steam storefront.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:39.000
Maybe you might have to supplement that with something

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
else in the meantime if you're going exclusively

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000
with Epic Games.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000
Some comments from our chat over at twitch.tv

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.000
slash vog network.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:49.000
Kaijuto says, Epic isn't leaning on Steam,

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000
it's for devs that want to be shady.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000
You know, and I suppose that is a true point,

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
that this isn't so much about the fact that like,

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:58.000
you know, Epic is not telling people to use

01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.000
Steam as a Band-Aid.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:02.000
The reality is the devs are using Steam as a Band-Aid

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
because they want the best of both worlds.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
They want to be able to have that user interaction

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:09.000
and take the check from Epic Games for being exclusive

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:10.000
on their store.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:14.000
So it would be unfair to fault Steam,

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:18.000
or excuse me, to fault Epic for that.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
It is the devs' choice to do that.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
But I think Steam is just putting up this wall saying,

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
you don't, you go to the Epic store,

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:27.000
you don't get to have your cake and pie.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.000
You don't get to have both.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.000
Yeah.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000
So that's what it is.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
Or, well, I mean, you can be on both stores.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
You just can't be exclusive to the Epic

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:36.000
and take all that money.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
Anyway, another quick little item here,

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.000
and then we'll move on to our next story.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:42.000
But a comment from chat I wanted to address

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
is that SheHulk10 in chat says,

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:48.000
rapid fire news, Gears 5 released, broken,

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.000
the worst I've ever seen.

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Oh, dear.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
I was watching a friend stream that.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Somebody I follow on Twitch was streaming it earlier.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.000
It looked kind of neat.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:58.000
I have the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate thing.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
So I meant to download and play, but it's just, you know,

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
with starting a new job on Monday and everything.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:03.000
And all the traveling I've been doing,

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000
I haven't really had a chance to sit down and play it yet,

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:08.000
but I hope to in the next week.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
I'm hoping I can sit down and play some Gears.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
That's a bummer if it's super broken though.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
I haven't, I haven't heard a lot of the.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Yeah, I haven't heard anything.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Yeah.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
But I'm not a fan of Gears, so.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:19.000
Yeah, I mean.

01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000
Yeah, I haven't really given a shit.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
If you have Game Pass though.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:26.000
I haven't really been big on Gears in a long time either,

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:27.000
but when I was.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.000
I've heard Gear reviews for it though.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Yeah, when I was watching this person play on Twitch,

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
I was like, I could, I might try this out.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Like I might, I'd be into this.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
So yeah, I'm gonna check it out.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
All right. Anyway, let's move on.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:42.000
So we're going to go to a story that Dark Sakura had for us about phones.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:43.000
I did.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:46.000
So, you know, Sony is still in the phone business.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:51.000
Their Xperia 5 is going to be supporting the PS4's DualShock controller.

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:57.000
So you can actually game with a legit controller on their phone.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:02.000
I mean, I still don't know why someone would do that,

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:05.000
because it's still kind of a small screen.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000
Ambulators.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:10.000
Wanting to be a Switch, I don't know.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:14.000
But, I mean, it's going to have DualShock support.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:19.000
They were, and they also announced that it's eventually going to be coming to,

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:21.000
down all the way to the Xperia 1.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:26.000
So it looks like they're going to make that retroactively, I guess, go in there.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:31.000
So it will also work with Fortnite.

01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:34.000
So they're going to have it go out to a bunch of other games,

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
though, that operate in a mobile space.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Oh, that actually says a lot right there, because...

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Yeah, Fortnite was the big one they mentioned.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.000
Yeah, one thing I learned doing that Battle Royale panel with Bobby,

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:49.000
Bobby talks about this on his show, so I won't repeat it too much,

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:52.000
that you can go download Bobby's show if you want to check that out.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:58.000
But we talked a little bit about how I pinch hit on a Battle Royale panel at Dragon Con.

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:02.000
And one thing I kind of learned from the audience about that panel is that

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:05.000
there are some people that wouldn't be playing Battle Royale games

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:08.000
if it weren't for the fact that Fortnite was such a huge mobile release.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:11.000
That, you know, not everybody has a console or acts as a console,

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:14.000
so the fact that it was on the mobile phone was a big deal for some people.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:18.000
So actually, I think when we talk about why do we need a controller on the phone,

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:21.000
you telling me that I can play Fortnite on my mobile phone

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
now with a controller as opposed to those touchscreen controllers.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.000
Ooh, that's a big deal, I think.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:28.000
I've seen a lot of people, just, you know, different places,

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:32.000
I mean, playing on their phones, so...

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:37.000
But still, I mean, I don't know, it just seems a little bit of overkill.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:41.000
I don't know how one would set that up, but if they want it, whatever.

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:43.000
More power to them.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:48.000
Bobby points out that you can use your Xbox One controller with your Android phone for Xbox.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:54.000
Tigerclaw says some games on mobile let you use USB controllers like DuckTales Remastered, so...

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:58.000
I mean, my SteelSeries controller will play with my iPhone and my iPad.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:02.000
Yeah, and I have that Bluetooth iCade thing that you can put, my old iPad goes in there,

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.000
you can play some of the arcade games.

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:04.000
But you know how many times I've used that feature?

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.000
Yeah.

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:08.000
Exactly once, just to see what it was like, and I was like, this is stupid.

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:11.000
I play, I use that controller on my Apple TV.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
I thought that iCade thing was pretty fun, it's just now that...

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:15.000
It was fun, but...

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:21.000
My iPad's kind of dated now, it was the new iPad, iPad 3, the new iPad, so...

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:24.000
Well, and on top of that, it has to have that particular dock.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:28.000
Yeah, oh yeah, because they're all lightning now, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.000
That was the old school plug.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:32.000
But I'm sure that there's some kind of mod or converter or something.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
I gave my mother my old iPad.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:36.000
Dan's won't work with it.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:37.000
Fair enough.

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:42.000
All right, anyhow, let's move on and talk a little bit about Uplay Plus,

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:47.000
because a lot of these companies are starting to release their own premium gaming services,

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000
and Ubisoft is one of them as well.

01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:54.000
Ubisoft mentioned at E3 in June that they were going to start their own gaming subscription service,

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:57.000
and that gaming subscription service is now here.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Windows PC users can now subscribe to Uplay Plus to play a library of more than 100 Ubisoft games,

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:08.000
including games like Far Cry, Prince of Persia, Assassin's Creed, Rayman.

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:12.000
Subscribers will have access to these premium editions,

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:17.000
and you get included in beta and early access programs, including Ghost Recon Breakpoint,

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:20.000
which just started, it started on September 5th,

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:26.000
and the opportunity to play the Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Breakpoint Ultimate Edition on October 1st

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
with three-day early access.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:31.000
So doing a lot of that stuff that EA is doing, basically.

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:36.000
The service will cost $15 a month, but here's where the news comes in, really,

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:39.000
is that if you want, there's a free trial.

01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:44.000
So they're just opening it up to everybody from September 3rd to September 30th.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:47.000
So if you want to get in, if you're a free games person,

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:51.000
hello, metal mayhem is probably out there,

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
you can play this whole thing.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:56.000
It's Uplayplus.com.

01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:00.000
But I imagine there's a trick to it, and I haven't signed up myself yet,

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:03.000
but almost always when I hear about a free trial deal like this,

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000
you have to give them your credit card information,

01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:09.000
and if you forget to cancel, guess what happens October 1st?

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:12.000
Yep, you're going to get charged, as is going to happen.

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:15.000
So just keep that in mind if you do decide to sign up for the free trial.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:18.000
But hey, it is still a free trial if you remember to cancel.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:22.000
So, all right, that's Uplayplus.

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:25.000
Well, let's travel back. Let's go back to a simpler time.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:30.000
We're going to go back to a simpler time when there was no gaming subscription service.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:33.000
There was Blockbuster, if you wanted to go renegade.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000
This predates so tell of you.

01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:39.000
This is a classic game, but that's because once a month,

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:44.000
you actually like to go way back and visit a soundtrack that you actually think.

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
It's the 2019 twist.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
You once a month, instead of spotlighting a game,

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:51.000
you may pick a game you've done before, which I think is the case tonight,

01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:55.000
but instead it's like, oh no, we got to talk about the soundtrack,

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000
and I totally know why you picked tonight's game, so let's get to it.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:58.000
All right.

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:04.000
So tonight's game in Japan was known as Akumajou Densetsu,

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:07.000
which we got as Castlevania III.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:12.000
And the music in this one, and I picked this particular piece of music

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:15.000
if we can play the very beginning of the level.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:19.000
The timestamp was here, so the intro, and then I did the whole take out

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:24.000
and put the actual stereo mix music here to take out the game noises.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:27.000
And I verify it is the Famicom because I know there's a big difference.

01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000
No, Famicom Disk.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:30.000
Right, yes.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:31.000
Not Famicom Disk, sorry, yeah.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000
But there's two different things about this one anyway.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:41.000
So basically, the Japanese version of this game had a VRC6 coprocessor chip

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:46.000
that was actually partially created by the game's audio programmer,

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
Maezawa Hidenori.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:53.000
It has two extra pulse wave channels and a salt wave channel

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:58.000
that adds to the system's initial set of five sound channels.

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:04.000
So basically, it's going to put out more sound.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:07.000
It's got better audio quality.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:13.000
But the US NES did not have the ability to support those external sound chips.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:20.000
So it replaced that with the memory management controller 5, the MMC5,

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:24.000
that just wasn't anywhere near.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:30.000
So basically, this version of the game has far better music

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
than we got here in the United States.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
It was ethically stellar.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:37.000
It's not to say that the soundtrack here was bad,

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:42.000
but it's just like imagine a yummy piece of cake

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:46.000
and then you put ice cream on top of the cake.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:54.000
Or more relevant, think of the Sega Master System with the FM chip.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
I just wanted to think about cake.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:01.000
Or listening to a mono CD and suddenly being able to listen to it in stereo.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000
But yeah, I like cake.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
Cake sounds good.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:12.000
Anyway, so that is really the biggest reason that I wanted to highlight this.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:19.000
And I also do want to think that the Switch version that we got.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Yeah, the Famicom version was made available on the Switch

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:26.000
as an update to the collection that came out.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:31.000
So you can now experience this beauty without having to import anything.

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:35.000
But a little bit more about the music for Castlevania III.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:39.000
Like I said, it was composed by Maizawa Hidenori.

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:46.000
Also by Funahashi Jun and Morimoto Yukie.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:52.000
And again, the sound chip was the Konami VRC6.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:58.000
And the good thing about this as well is that because this was considered so iconic,

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:04.000
we actually now have multiple releases of the soundtrack for this, including a vinyl.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:12.000
So this, I do also believe, is the first game that had the song beginning in it,

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:18.000
which has become one of the staples of the Castlevania series.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:26.000
Also, the songs Mad Forest and Prelude have been used in other titles as well.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:29.000
The other thing that, you know, because I also like to bring up things

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:33.000
that the sound designers have also created for other games.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:39.000
Maizawa has done Parodius for MSX, Gradius and Salamander.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:43.000
He did Ditana Twinbee, I mean, it's Konami.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:49.000
Zexus, Contra Spirits, Konami All-Stars 1993.

01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:54.000
I'm just going through, you know, a bunch of more Parodius, more Twinbee.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:57.000
I'm trying to find some more recent stuff.

01:38:57.000 --> 01:39:05.000
Because he also did music for a couple of live concerts as well.

01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000
For Kouda Mariko.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:10.000
Also, let's see where the recent stuff is.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:15.000
So Suikoden, a little bit more recent.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000
What were you laughing about?

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:18.000
I'll tell you later.

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Okay.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:22.000
Ys Ark of Napishtim.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:25.000
I always mispronounce that one anyway.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:28.000
Sora Tokazu no Kimi Toboku.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:31.000
He did that one.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
Just looking through the list on here.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Some more Contra as of late.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:47.000
And he worked on remastering for the Castlevania III Dracula's Curse vinyl release.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:50.000
And the Girlfriend Beta Character Song series.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:58.000
So anyway, he's done a lot of the staples here in a lot of Konami games and other projects.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:05.000
But at any rate, this is, to some people, a lot of the pinnacle of the Castlevania series.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:09.000
If you're going to go with the 8-bit era.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:14.000
I mean, there's people who will argue that Super Castlevania IV is the best of the series.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:17.000
I think you're lying because it's Rondo of Blood.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:23.000
But here we go. This is still considered one of the best video game soundtracks ever.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:27.000
And really, just to reiterate something you said a moment ago about the whole Castlevania collection.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:35.000
There is a way you can play this in its intended form with that glorious Famicom disc soundtrack right now on the Switch.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000
And it is through that collection.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:41.000
And I know you're spotlighting this game, but just to kind of take it aside.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:45.000
There's other Famicom disc games that have better soundtracks thanks to that chip.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:49.000
Namely, The Legend of Zelda and Metroid are two that come to mind.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:52.000
And you can even play, if you have that Nintendo Online subscription.

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:53.000
I've done livestreams of this.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Actually, I think I did it as a break segment early on.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:57.000
I think we've talked about it.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Is that you can go play those on the Famicom.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
You just create a Japanese account on your Switch, you go download the Famicom.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:06.000
And it still works as long as you have a Nintendo Online subscription in any country.

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:10.000
And you can actually play the Famicom version of Zelda or Metroid.

01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:14.000
And you can see Metroid with save files instead of passwords.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
And with that extra chip.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
Now, Castlevania isn't in that collection.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
You'll have to buy Konami's collection separately to hear that.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
But it's still really cool.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:23.000
That's it.

01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:24.000
Alright.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:25.000
There it is.

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Your classic soundtrack.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:27.000
Go play it.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:28.000
But not right now.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
Yeah, go play it, but not right now.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Put it on hold to go play a little later on.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
Alright, great pick.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:36.000
Great pick.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:39.000
We are going to move on with our show.

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
And we're going to actually go over to Loki.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:46.000
Because, Loki, so you actually, you took like a video that we're going to play here as our break.

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:52.000
We're not going to be able to play this on the podcast because you just have video with like music playing over it.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
So it's not really going to work for the podcast.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:57.000
Because there's not a lot for the podcast to listen to.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:02.000
But I still want you to talk about where you were at and what you saw and kind of set this up for us.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
It's like four and a half minute video we're going to look at.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:09.000
Yeah, so I went to a thing called the Capital Creative Showcase.

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:15.000
You may remember in the past we've done an event called the Sacramento Indie Arcade.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:18.000
So that's what this has become is this new showcase.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:23.000
Because now it's no longer the Sacramento chapter of the IGDA.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
It's now the Game Dev Association.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:26.000
Yeah, the game.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:29.000
Yeah, now it's the Sacramento Development Crew.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
Oh no, it's the Indie Collective or something like that.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
Sacramento Developer Collective.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:36.000
The Developer Collective is what's now called the SDC.

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:42.000
So it's their new event. This was put on by Capital or sponsored by Capital Games, the EA company there.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:47.000
So it's basically it's a bunch of indie developers showing off stuff.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:52.000
So they've got this the SDC does a thing called the Progressive Game Jam.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:43:00.000
So they have like I think like six teams or so that will do work on a game over the course of a few months every Saturday for a few hours.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:08.000
And so they're showing off their progress on their games as well as other local developers in the area showing off what they're working on.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:11.000
And then there's also like artists and they have local businesses.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:19.000
So like there was a VR experience company that can go in there and rent time at one of their booths with high end VR stuff and play games.

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:23.000
That's why I played the Beat Saber in.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:29.000
So I took some video of that because I took my kids because my oldest son who's doing a coding class.

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:38.000
And I thought, hey, it would be kind of cool to get him kind of excited about game development and show what like other kids, you know, are working on as well as adults.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:42.000
You know, just like, hey, look, see, this is what you can be doing and stuff like that.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:45.000
Did they have like local gaming media and Twitch streamers and stuff there, too?

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:52.000
Well, you see, they did invite the number one podcast, the gaming podcast of the Sacramento area there.

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:59.000
No, I'm just kidding. No, no. We did. I did see I did talk to Corey over it.

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:05.000
But the banner still says that, doesn't it? Video game bang. Yes. And the banner still say that. I don't remember. I didn't notice.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:11.000
I think I saw a picture. I think it still says that's right. That's right. That's fine. Give him crap. But so they have them.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:17.000
The theme this year was women in gaming. So they had like a bunch of panels at their black box theater.

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:21.000
I didn't take any of my kids to that because they would not not have behaved.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:27.000
I was just asking because I noted that I just I can't help but notice I just I guess our invite was was lost somewhere.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:32.000
I don't I don't know what happened. It was a much smaller event this year. So I don't know if they had their idea.

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:36.000
I have to give a little I was just surprised to come back to my trip. I didn't get to run into.

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:41.000
Oh, this is. Yeah, I didn't get to run into Gabriel or Brianna.

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:46.000
So I didn't get to run into either of them because they were gone.

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:50.000
But yeah, I hope they had a great event. I'm just being saucy. I hope they legit had a great event.

01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:54.000
I'm sad. I'm sad I miss. I would have just gone like once you told me about it. I was like, oh, I should go.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:45:00.000
But like literally the worst weekend you could possibly picked with me having just been out of town and starting a new job.

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:06.000
So but next time we'd love to help out again. Just you know where to find us.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:11.000
Yeah. But I'm glad at least you got to go and take the kids. I mean, that's that's even better that you get to.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Yeah, because I wasn't sure I was going to be able to go. But thankfully, we had plans canceled the last minute.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:20.000
So I was able to take them for a couple hours and go check out what they had there.

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:25.000
Like I didn't get to check out any of the speakers, but they had a lot of like they had a female twitch streamers.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:29.000
They had game developers, different business entrepreneurs in the area.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:36.000
They had while we were there, they had other like there was a twitch streamer streaming stuff as well.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:41.000
So it was it's definitely low key, but I got to play everything.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:45.000
I didn't get to film everything, but I played pretty much all of the games that were there.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:51.000
So we'll talk a little bit about those. I think low key cons are great. Not low key cons, but low key conventions are great, too.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:55.000
They're some of my favorite to go to. I would go to low key condos.

01:45:55.000 --> 01:46:00.000
Me, too. But no, I like the smaller conventions are awesome.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:06.000
Even that year, it was remember the first year we went to the showcase and it was in that the colony thing where they did the.

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:10.000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. One room. It was like a real tight fit. Yeah. That was a great.

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:14.000
It was fun. It was. Yeah. So anyway. All right.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:18.000
So we're just going to play this program. Yeah. They had a program with a map and everything.

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:23.000
So that reminds me so I can talk about everything. So some of the things that aren't featured in there.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:30.000
I just want to see who is there. So they had they had this one game.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:33.000
They had like not only are there like video games there, but there's also like board games.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:38.000
So that one of the guys actually did a video game that I did film in here.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:45.000
He's working on a board game right now called Bike Route Sacramento. So he's got that, which he's looking to release pretty soon.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:50.000
They had actually like a developer of some middleware stuff that was there.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:57.000
A capital games was there as well. They were showing off some stuff. I think also recruiting and whatnot.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:01.000
Like I said, there is I got to play a robot dating sim, which was kind of cool.

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:09.000
So they had that there. There was this one game I played that was kind of a cross between a match three and kind of like an idol clicker type thing.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:17.000
So you're you have this minor guy who is mining a cave and then he would be knocking out gems that would end up in your match three stuff.

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:23.000
And then you use the match three stuff, matching gems, get you gold, which you use to upgrade your minor and do all that.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:29.000
So that was kind of cool. The back and forth mobile game that they're going to be putting out at some point.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:35.000
But yeah, so we can show the video and maybe I don't know if I could I can talk a little bit more about like what is in the video as well.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:40.000
Yes, of course. Let's do that. So for the podcast listeners, though, we're going to do a little fast forward here.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:49.000
But for those of you that are watching live at Twitch TV, here is some of the footage that was shot from the Capitol Creative Showcase that Loki attended over this last weekend.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:58.000
Roll it. So we're back after looking at the Capitol Creative Showcase and some of the games that you saw around there.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
So those are your kids playing the games. Those are my kids.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:05.000
Yeah. So like that was a little treat for our Twitch people, because I don't know if they've ever like your kids.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:08.000
One of your kids has been on the show, but that was when we were before we were on Twitch.

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:19.000
So, yeah, there was like some of their favorite games that Luminous Flux was the last one that they showed was sort of the the that's one of the progressive game jam games that they were working on.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:26.000
So that was it's like a described as a one on one like battle royale type game where you jump between planets and stuff.

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:29.000
So it kind of like a Mario Galaxy type feel to where you can like fly around.

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:36.000
So and they were having fun just playing around with like the physics of it. There wasn't really a whole game there, but they were kind of making their own fun with it.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:41.000
And then there was another one that was like a dodgeball game that's set on a planet.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:46.000
I think that's what I was asking about. What was that other game? Onionhead Dodgeball from our channel?

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:54.000
I don't remember the name off the top of my head. It was on the video there, but it was I have to look up here.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:49:00.000
It was Fizzy Fuse Games was the one that she they had like one of the three team members there.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:06.000
And she was like, hand out her resume and stuff. But it was kind of a spherical dodgeball game.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:13.000
So you could actually get different power ups and stuff with the dodgeballs and you're supposed to be fighting these two bots in there.

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:17.000
So they had they had a lot of fun. They're like they were just, you know.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:23.000
Yeah. You were telling me that one of your kids like didn't really want to go. But then when he went, he was like, yeah, they just had like a blast.

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:35.000
That's how it usually goes. So I mean, I know like the luminous flux stuff like those like they were pretty happy with like how excited my kids were getting about their games.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:43.000
I mean, that's got to feel good. Just I think that is like the whole point of doing these types of things is to actually get to see people playing your game for the first time is a pretty big trip.

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:48.000
Yeah. So like there was there's a lot of cool stuff. The lonely zombie thing. I loved how they had there.

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:55.000
You kind of saw in the very beginning of the video, they they had the whole booth set up, you know, with kind of this broken streetlight thing.

01:49:55.000 --> 01:50:02.000
And it was a pretty polished game. I liked checking it out. The one version I got to play because I was helping my youngest and played.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:07.000
You saw it in the beginning where he couldn't jump on the platforms or whatever, but they had like two different builds.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:13.000
So the one we played was like very early than the one in my other son was playing was like much more polished and finished.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:19.000
And it was pretty cool. I like to check it out. And then there was one where he was spawning a thousand bats.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:24.000
It wasn't his game. They're showing that some tools that they're making. So that was actually an in-game.

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:35.000
They can play the game and edit the level in real time and like actually save the progress that they do and then change stats like of their players at the same time in real time.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:39.000
So like if they wanted to say, OK, this power is going to make me jump, you know, this high.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:46.000
They can type it in and then start developing a level around that power up or something like that and just change it in real time, which is really cool.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:53.000
So it's shown off that there are some other stuff that we didn't see. There was a cube combat game.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:56.000
You didn't have a whole lot there yet. It was just basically movement.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:51:02.000
So kind of just showing the movement and testing some of the shooting and stuff, very basic things.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:09.000
But it's kind of cool to see some of that stuff there. And like I said, I played a robot dating sim game that was kind of interesting.

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:14.000
So, you know, not my usual cup of tea, but it was it was cool to see that there.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:24.000
And they had this weird golf game with this monster that would pick you had to pick up the ball and run around while these worms were chasing after you.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:27.000
I didn't really see how that was golf, but it was it was something that was there.

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:34.000
And then can't be any worse than ninja golf. And then, yeah, they just have like a bunch of cool stuff there.

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:42.000
So it was really fun like to do that. I would love I mean, I would love to just be actually there displaying my games at some point.

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:47.000
So I would love to do that. And one of the things that they have with the SCC is you can actually become a member and stuff.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:53.000
So you pay like a membership of 50 bucks a year or whatever. And with that comes like free booth space if you want.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:52:01.000
Although I think if you want like a really tiny booth, they don't really charge you for it. But that might be something worth while.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:04.000
They're also going to do another. Could we share the space and promote Sacramento? Yeah.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:11.000
Number two. We could. Well, we can we could actually pick up. Boot space isn't really that expensive, so we could do that.

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:16.000
And then they also have I think there's there's like we have there's like a budget and stuff for sponsorship now.

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:21.000
I have to like ask questions. OK, well, you know, it's it's pretty I mean, small spaces, but I'm sure we can swing it.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:29.000
And I'm sure we could talk them swing. But they're also doing a sack gamer expo that's in December that they're also going to have some developers there as well.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:33.000
And they're always that that's the the people that do sack anime doing that thing. I think so.

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:37.000
Yeah. So they're going to do that. They're going to have the voice actor that does Bowser there and stuff.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:41.000
So it'll be OK. It'll be interesting. So I may go to that.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:46.000
Those folks, because I think I think the people with sack horror that I do a lot with work with them.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:51.000
So I'd probably know people. But yeah. So maybe I'll get on that. So we good.

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:55.000
But yeah, it was fun. So I had a pretty good time and I definitely want to go back next year.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:53:04.000
I'd love to be able to actually show some stuff off next year. Would be kind of fun to have people play stuff, but we'll see.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:09.000
All right. Well, I'm I'm actually like all the sass aside about the invite and stuff.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:14.000
I understand there. There's they they had to start over in many ways when they separated from my GDA and so forth.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:19.000
So it's almost like they're kind of like this is like their year one. So I'm really happy to see that it's gone well.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:22.000
It seemed to be very well received and it's just going to grow from there. And that's awesome.

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:28.000
And whatever we can do to support developers in the Sacramento area, like I'm I'm all about it, you know,

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:33.000
and that just indie developers in general, like, you know, I say Sacramento because that's where we're at.

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:38.000
But if somebody from the Bay Area want to drive up here, pitch their game. Hell, yeah. Like, I'm all about that.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:41.000
So, you know, exactly. We haven't had a lot of guests since we made them. Exactly.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:45.000
Well, I was studio space is a little weird. Yeah. But yeah, I talked to I talked to them.

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:49.000
In fact, that luminous arc thing, I got one of the developers emails and stuff.

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:54.000
I mean, they're like high school kids, but like it would be it'd be cool just to get like some different developers.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:59.000
And we can always tape it for a break or at some point. And I've threatened this on the show before.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:04.000
Either we're going to have a long term reshuffle of this studio or we're moving.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:08.000
So and that's that the second number two seems more likely at this point.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:18.000
So and the nice thing is the next studio space studio and eight or whatever we decide to call the next one will be designed with streaming in mind because this one was the studio.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:29.000
Crazy eight. We were that's actually going we were still radio only for those of you that are like tuning in on Twitch, you know, for the first time or whatever and going, God, these guys have kind of a crap layout.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:35.000
Well, it's because we've been an audio only presentation for like 16 plus years. And this this isn't even how we were laid out for audio.

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:42.000
We were kind of it was actually even different here. I think I completely faced this way and I didn't I didn't even look at him.

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:50.000
I didn't even look at him. I can't even look at him. Don't look. I contact only when I say the first word.

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:57.000
All right. Anyway, moving on. Let's move on and get back into some rapid fire news.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:05.000
Thanks again. I'm I'm glad at least one of us went to the Capitol Creative Showcase. And I do want to wish best of luck to all the local game developers and the gamer collective as they continue to grow.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:16.000
Well, I also was you're welcome back to the show anytime. The other thing, too, is like I had mentioned it to the owner of the business that my son does this coding stuff that actually ran into them.

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:22.000
So they actually went as well. I'm trying to get them to I think that if they had a booth there as well, that would be kind of cool.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:30.000
And also maybe like show off some games. And I don't know. I just want that John Cena game your kid made. Yeah, we could be funny.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:35.000
All right. Now, dude, when you like, I wish I could have been doing that shit when I was like seven years old.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:40.000
Are you fucking kidding? Like, I think it's so awesome what the kids today are doing.

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:45.000
You know, when I was seven, the most I was doing was typing in a program in basic in the back.

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:51.000
And maybe I would learn that if I change like this number, it would make the text red instead of yellow or something.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:55.000
And I was like, oh, I did that. You know, so you got to start somewhere, I guess. Yeah. All right.

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:58.000
Moving on. Let's get to some rapid fire news and travel around the world.

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:06.000
It gave me news a little quickly with some quick headlines. Loki. So apparently Cyberpunk 2077 is getting multiplayer.

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:13.000
So that's kind of cool. Apparently, the game's going to launch with just the single player, of course, in April after DLC is released.

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:17.000
The multiplayer is going to be rolled out. So curious to see what that's all about.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:22.000
But I'm very excited for Cyberpunk 2077. So we'll have to see what it is.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:27.000
This is kind of cool. So it's been a while since we talked about Grand Theft Auto.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:33.000
And Grand Theft Auto San Andreas was ported to mobile devices back in 2013.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:37.000
So it's been a long time. I mean, they ported to Xbox 360 after that.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:45.000
And so apparently, though, there's some YouTubers have discovered that there's some hidden developer codes in there.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:56.000
So on top of what cheat codes were already in the game, they've discovered that there's additional stuff that they added specifically for the mobile version, which is kind of cool.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:05.000
So some of these cheats apparently give certain weapons and stuff that aren't easily available in the game.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:11.000
There's some that pass some of the missions. So it's a script bypass cheat.

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:19.000
And yeah, it's kind of cool. So they have some of these outlined now that you can check out.

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
Very cool.

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:25.000
This is relevant to all of your interests. Like it's Grand Theft Auto and it's cheating in games.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
I love both. Yes.

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:30.000
Perfect. Somebody gets somebody gets there.

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:33.000
It's been a while since they played the mobile version of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:36.000
But like, I'll check it out.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
This is worth a reinstall at least.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:39.000
Sure.

01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:43.000
All right. Moving on to kind of a coming and going in the gaming industry.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Ikumi Nakamura has actually departed from Tango and Zenimax.

01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:53.000
Ikumi Nakamura was working on a game called Ghostwire Tokyo.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:58:00.000
And this is how a lot of you got to know her, because she was a very positive, kind of peppy individual that was on stage at E3 this year.

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:05.000
And everybody was like, oh, you know, like somebody who seems to enjoy working games and having fun.

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
And that energy is kind of infectious.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:11.000
So it's a little bit like, oh, shucks to hear that on the Twitter announcement.

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:14.000
After not from Nakamura one nine three is her handle on Twitter.

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:20.000
After nine years as creative director and art director at Tango and Zenimax, I felt here is one ends of the journeys.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:23.000
I learned from the talented people I worked with and I respect.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:26.000
Contact me if anyone wants to work with me.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
And then left a link to her LinkedIn.

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:32.000
So they didn't really say like, why, what's going on?

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:35.000
It is interesting that she leaves the LinkedIn at the end.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:39.000
So that means there isn't something else immediately lined up potentially.

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
So not sure. Not sure what to read into that.

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:49.000
It's not really my business anyway, but we wish her all the best and hope she finds a dream job to her liking very soon.

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:52.000
Because she was a lot of she should be on stage representing somebody at E3.

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:56.000
Yeah. So anyway, maybe maybe Konami will have availability.

01:58:56.000 --> 01:59:01.000
I know. I know. Konami has been kind of like the laughing joke of the industry for a couple of years now,

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:08.000
which has always pained our hearts because obviously this shows roots are in Dance Dance Revolution and other Konami created franchises.

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:13.000
But you know what? You got to give credit when credit is due.

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:18.000
And some of the recent Konami offerings, like they're a Bomberman Reinvention was pretty good.

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:24.000
The Castlevania collection and the Gradius all those new collections, you know, even though their collections just re releases of their old games.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:28.000
But they've it's they hey, at least they included the Japanese versions.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
At least they did some like extra things with them.

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:33.000
So, you know, we'll give credit where credit is due.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:40.000
But they have plans for new console games involving, quote, globally known IPs.

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:58.000
This was in an interview with Konami Europe President Masami Saso saying that the publisher is still looking at high end console games and plans to make more games beyond Pro Evo Soccer and Yu-Gi-Oh to, quote, work on projects with other globally known IPs in the near future.

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:03.000
Which leaves many people to fan wank away at could they just do a Metal Gear without Kojima?

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:06.000
Because, I mean, they could. They'd be within their rights.

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:16.000
Well, we do have the basically their streaming or stage show timeline for Tokyo Game Show.

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:20.000
OK, but so but this is coming off of is that a NeoGaf logo?

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:23.000
OK, that's what it's from the official site, though.

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:24.000
All right. Is it OK?

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:27.000
I was like, he's reading a NeoGaf post.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
OK, so what's the timeline?

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:35.000
So, like, some of the stuff that they're going to be talking about, of course, Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links.

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:41.000
They've got Super Bomberman RX Bonk, they said Bonkuri collaboration stage.

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:42.000
I don't know what that is.

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
Death March Club.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:47.000
They have several games that have to do with baseball.

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:51.000
Of course, they're powerful pro baseball stuff.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
A-Train.

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:56.000
Why have they never put out an A-Train game here?

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:57.000
I don't know.

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
Dude, the A-Train goes back.

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:07.000
But don't worry, they haven't forgotten about you Bomani fans because they have the Bomani Ultimate Mobile special stage.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:11.000
It's going to be showing off some stuff for that.

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
That's on September 12th.

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
Oh, that's it? That's the big thing?

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
That one's on September 12th. That's it.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:21.000
The rest of the days, you know, they have some stuff talking about the PC Engine Mini.

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:26.000
There's another Konami thing people were excited about. That's right, the PC Engine. That sounded really cool.

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:30.000
And to be fair, this is just Tokyo Game Show. They may still have something else in the works.

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:35.000
Who knows? We're left here to imagine maybe A-Castlevania or something else in the future.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
Who knows? Anything's possible, right?

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:40.000
I'm just curious. There may be more stuff that they haven't announced.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:45.000
They're not going to probably put all their announcements into their timeline here.

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:49.000
Anyway, nice rapid story, but no, that's alright.

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
It was worth digging in a little deeper with.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:54.000
But Dark Sakura has a few quick things for us, then we'll move on.

02:01:54.000 --> 02:02:00.000
Yeah, SNK put out an announcement that they are doing a Neo Geo Arcade Stick Pro.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:06.000
Quote, Pro Gear Spec Advanced Entertainment System based off of the Neo Geo CD controller.

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:10.000
Which was okay. I mean, I've got one.

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:15.000
But yeah, it's going to be the next thing they put out after the Neo Geo Mini.

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
No real information on that yet.

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:23.000
Yeah, I couldn't tell if that's just for their Neo Geo systems, or if that's going to be for console systems.

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
Yeah, I didn't say.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:32.000
And also, Sony has confirmed they will not be hosting a press conference at Tokyo Game Show 2019.

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:35.000
They said on their website that they weren't doing it.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:44.000
They'll be livestreaming from their booth at the event, but they are going to focus on games like Final Fantasy VII Remake and...

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:47.000
Is it Naya or Neo? Neo 2?

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:55.000
And there's rumors that they might talk about a next PlayStation, but not really.

02:02:55.000 --> 02:03:00.000
But at least the fans there are going to get to play Final Fantasy VII.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
Oh, they get to get their hands on it.

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:05.000
Well, I mean, actually E3 had a demo too, right? But that was just...

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
Release the demo! Release the demo!

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:08.000
I know, right?

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:09.000
Release the demo!

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:10.000
Release the hounds.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:16.000
But, I mean, Sony just is basically taking the E3 playbook and applying it here too.

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:20.000
They're sitting out because they've got a slower year ahead.

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:24.000
Because they're locking and loading for PlayStation 5, likely next year.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
So, all right.

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:30.000
Tokyo Game Show doesn't get treated any differently than E3 did, it sounds like, at the end of the day.

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:31.000
So, all right.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:32.000
Let's see.

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:37.000
Oh, and Bobby Blackwolf points out the Evil G Expo, which took place during our break.

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:43.000
I think maybe the weekend of our tape show had the Final Fantasy VII Remake demo playable.

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:46.000
One of the local Twitch streamers is a store manager.

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:47.000
So, that's right.

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:53.000
I got to meet some Twitch people at Dragon Con because there was a couple Twitch meetups I got taken to.

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
And then, of course, there were a few panels.

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:59.000
So, I really should have said a big hello at the top to anyone I met at Dragon Con.

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:05.000
But I imagine most people, if they looked up the feed, probably heard last week's show first instead.

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:09.000
But this one's the full show as opposed to the hour and a half.

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:13.000
Although, I will say quickly about the tape show that we did.

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:17.000
The Twitter thing, those questions were so good.

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:21.000
And a lot of the discussion that we had, I think, as a result, I thought was really good.

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:26.000
You can look forward to Twitter being an important part of the show moving forward.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:30.000
I think we'll probably incorporate that back into the show a little more formally.

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:33.000
But more info on that to continue.

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:36.000
Nifty805 says, come to TwitchCon.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:37.000
I would love to.

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
I would absolutely love to.

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:44.000
The reality is because I'm starting a new job, I can't.

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:47.000
But I want to go so bad.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:48.000
You guys don't even know.

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:53.000
Just because it's such a great networking opportunity and to just learn about the craft

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
and really try to better what we're doing on Twitch.

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
I badly want to go.

02:04:57.000 --> 02:05:01.000
But again, because I'm starting a new job and the day job is more.

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
Paying my rent is more important than anything else.

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
I have to make a tough choice.

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
So no TwitchCon for me.

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
Sad face.

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
But don't.

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
One of my best friends just moved to San Diego.

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
So it's like I have a place to stay.

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
So don't think I'm not turning the gears.

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
Is there a way this could work one way or the other?

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:20.000
So we'll see.

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:21.000
Anyway.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:22.000
All right.

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:28.000
Let's move on and travel around the world and check out some world release dates.

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:29.000
All right.

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:30.000
Both your stories.

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:31.000
I'm sorry.

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:32.000
I'm sorry.

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:33.000
OK.

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:34.000
Sorry.

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:35.000
It was the Neo Geo and then Sony.

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:36.000
Right.

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:37.000
I'm sorry.

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:38.000
I had a space cadet moment.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:39.000
OK.

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:40.000
So let's move on and talk about world release dates and what's coming out in the gaming

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:41.000
store near you.

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:44.000
We've got caravan stories on PlayStation 4.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:48.000
E-Football Pro Evolution Soccer 2020.

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:52.000
That's on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:56.000
Gears 5 on PC and Xbox One.

02:05:56.000 --> 02:06:00.000
Greed Fall on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
We have.

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:05.000
And I'm going to mispronounce this already.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
Uta War.

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:08.000
I'm not even going to pronounce it.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
There's a game coming out on PlayStation 4.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
Let's just put it that way.

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:13.000
I'm not going to try to butcher the Japanese.

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:14.000
It is a game.

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:15.000
It is a game.

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:16.000
It is an action role playing.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:19.000
You might decide to beat him up game.

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:20.000
Uta War.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:21.000
Yeah.

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:24.000
My American mouth cannot say the Japanese name.

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:25.000
That hasn't.

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:28.000
That hasn't stopped me in 15 years.

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:29.000
This.

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:32.000
I don't know how to pronounce it.

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:35.000
Uta Waru Monozon.

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
Uta Waru Monozon.

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:38.000
All right.

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:39.000
That's that'll work.

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:40.000
Sure.

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:41.000
Why not?

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:43.000
Yeah.

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
It's it's it's the thing.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
Speaking of beat him up games.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:51.000
While we've been out that River City Girls came out and I got to check that out at some

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:52.000
point.

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
I was watching some let's plays of that and that looks fun.

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:57.000
So I'm just throwing that out there.

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
One of the big games I'm looking forward to this week.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:03.000
Borderlands 3 coming on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:06.000
Damon X Machina on Nintendo Switch.

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:10.000
And last but not least, NHL 20 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:11.000
All right.

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
Well, that game actually looks kind of good.

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:17.000
Traveling over to Japan and checking out the releases over there because butchering Japanese

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
names hasn't stopped me in the history of this show.

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:25.000
And every time Akuma JP is here, he's like crying because for me is butchering all this

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:26.000
stuff.

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:29.000
But actually, the releases I have on PS4 this week have pretty English names.

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:35.000
These are not or these these are difficult to screw up.

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:39.000
Konami is releasing E Football winning 11 2020 in Japan this week.

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:40.000
So there is that.

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:44.000
And then Lethal League Blaze is another game that is coming out this week.

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:47.000
Again, both those releases in Japan on the 12th.

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:51.000
Going over to the Nintendo Switch and seeing what's coming out over there.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:55.000
Lethal League Blaze is also released on the Nintendo Switch and then a game called Amnesia.

02:07:55.000 --> 02:08:00.000
Is that the scary game coming out on Nintendo Switch?

02:08:00.000 --> 02:08:01.000
Because it's called.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:02.000
No, it's not.

02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:03.000
No, it's different.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:04.000
Amnesia.

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:05.000
OK, that's why I had to look.

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:10.000
It is a port of the December 2013 PS Vita title Amnesia.

02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:13.000
I don't know if that's Amnesia five or Amnesia V edition.

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:16.000
It is a memory loss suspense mystery game.

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:22.000
So I it looks like it's like a graphic novel or I would say more graphic novel than anime.

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:26.000
But yeah, it's I like the art actually on the cover.

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:31.000
It's like this character holding like this white rose and like surrounded with these

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
cards and interesting patterns.

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:34.000
Kind of kind of cool.

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.000
Yeah, I think it's a pixel pockets is probably a visual novel.

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:37.000
I tend to agree.

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:42.000
So not to be confused with the scary game Amnesia here in the States.

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:43.000
It could be the same.

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:44.000
You never know.

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:45.000
It could have been.

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:46.000
Yeah, why not?

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:48.000
Why not a version of that on Switch?

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:51.000
Let's go over to the UK and dark soccer.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
This patch of games are on the ninth.

02:08:53.000 --> 02:09:00.000
We have Pool Nation for PS4 goat simulator, the goatee on Switch.

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.000
And it's GOATY.

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:04.000
I don't know what the Y is standing for.

02:09:04.000 --> 02:09:05.000
I know what the goat is.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:06.000
Game of the year.

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:07.000
Goat of the year.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
Greatest of all time.

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:10.000
Yo.

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:12.000
Yo.

02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:14.000
Greatest of all the years.

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:15.000
Maybe.

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:19.000
Greed Fall on Xbox and PlayStation.

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
The Walking Dead, the Telltale Definitive Series.

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:27.000
We have E Football PES 2020, which is real football and not this crap in America.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
We have Gears 5.

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:30.000
What?

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
I just.

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:34.000
Sometimes your shade makes me laugh.

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:35.000
It's OK, right?

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:36.000
Do you know what?

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:37.000
OK.

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:41.000
Do you know that I will say this one thing about Dragon Con that I noticed.

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
Sorry, I'm I'm in a tangent mood tonight.

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:44.000
We've been gone for so long.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:45.000
OK, not.

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:46.000
Here's the thing.

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:54.000
I've noticed how much straight culture has appropriated fans because like and I feel

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:57.000
like when you do shade, you need a thing to go through because I.

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:58.000
OK, here's the thing.

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:05.000
I went to the LGBT dance party that they do every year, Spectrum, and the music at Spectrum,

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:06.000
not doing it for me.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:11.000
Like when I go to the LGBT event at Dragon Con, you know what I expect to hear?

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:17.000
Britney Spears, Sia, the Spice Girls, which I heard at the Zombie Prom, but I didn't hear

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:18.000
it at Spectrum.

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:23.000
You know, I expect to hear icons and that type of thing, not this club kid rave music

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
thing they've played every single year.

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:31.000
So me and my new friend I met at Dragon Con and we became fast friends because of all

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:36.000
the people in the universe, of the 85,000 people at Dragon Con, I, by coincidence, meet

02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:39.000
the other guy who plays Survivor games online.

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:45.000
So we became fast friends and we went instead and him and his roommate, we went from the

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:46.000
Spectrum party.

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:49.000
We went to the Heroes and Villains Ball, which is what the video game track does.

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:52.000
And it's it's a really big to do production.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:55.000
And it's, you know, it's the more traditional dance party.

02:10:55.000 --> 02:11:01.000
It was a lot of, dude, they had pyrotechnics, like fucking sparks would shoot from the stage

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:02.000
and shit.

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:03.000
And I was like, is this legal?

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:04.000
Who cares?

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:05.000
You know, we were having fun.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:09.000
But I would notice when the when the music and the music they were playing was much better,

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:13.000
when the music would have this flat that that that people like the girls were getting out

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:17.000
their fans, black, black, black, black, and they would like black in unison.

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
And I was like, hey, wait a minute.

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
Hey, wait a minute.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:25.000
You know, you stole that from drag queens who in turn stole it from somebody else, I'm

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:26.000
sure.

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:29.000
One of my friends was there, actually, who's also a sister.

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:30.000
Yeah.

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000
So much extra.

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:35.000
I should have I should have had eighty five thousand people.

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:36.000
No, I know.

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:40.000
I should have, though, had some of the sisters out there say hi or something.

02:11:40.000 --> 02:11:42.000
But they're all wonderful people.

02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:45.000
Just I'm sure I did not see anyone dressed up like a nun, for what it's worth.

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:48.000
No, I think I think that Soma was there in drag.

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:52.000
I have to ask and make sure, because I know that she posted something about Drag Con,

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
but I'll have to check.

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:59.000
Anyway, on the 10th, we have No Man's Sky Beyond.

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:02.000
On the 11th, Modern Warfare PS4 Beta.

02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:06.000
On the 12th, we have Borderlands 3.

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:12.000
Damon Ex Machina, NHL 20, Star Wars Pinball.

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:15.000
And that's it for that week.

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:19.000
Tiger, I'm not sure if this is I'm not sure if this is like pro or anti what I just said,

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:22.000
but I do want to respond to what Tiger was saying in chat, saying as someone who listens

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:26.000
to electronic music, the EDM they've been playing sounds so cheesy and soulless to me,

02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:30.000
like the people who made this music is just capitalizing on what's popular with the kids

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:31.000
these days.

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:34.000
Like, I don't I don't really know the genre of music I was listening to at that party.

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:35.000
It just wasn't good.

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:36.000
And here's the thing.

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:38.000
I like a lot of electronic music, actually.

02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:41.000
Like, I love my melodic trance playlist on Spotify.

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:46.000
So, you know, I have a feeling the type of music is not what they were playing.

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:49.000
It's just it was just like it was circuit party stuff.

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
You know, it's the stuff that people are twirling flags and things.

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:54.000
It's just it wasn't it's not what I wanted.

02:12:54.000 --> 02:13:00.000
You know what? Stop with the stereotype and just make it fun and glittery.

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:03.000
Lots of glitter, lots of fun, lots of balloons.

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:07.000
That was a big big balloons were these big balls that were being bounced around.

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
It's like I'd be dancing and then all of a sudden.

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:12.000
Now, which is fucking think of disco.

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
Have yourself a mirror ball.

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:18.000
Yeah. Have yourself some some Donna Summer and back.

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:20.000
Yes. Where was the Donna Summer at?

02:13:20.000 --> 02:13:21.000
Right. Yeah. There you go.

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:26.000
You know what? You know what? You know what we if I can make it to Dragon Con,

02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:31.000
I'm going to talk to my sisters out there and we'll see about having a ball.

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:35.000
Category is cosplay realness.

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:36.000
Oh, my God.

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:38.000
Dark soccer. You're a genius.

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:43.000
Why is there not a cosplay ball at Dragon Con?

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
There is and I just don't know where category.

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:50.000
Instead of having a masquerade or any of that, you have the cosplay ball.

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:54.000
You have it. You know, category wig, fighting, fighting.

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:57.000
Like I'm just like, this needs to be a thing at Dragon Con.

02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:03.000
Absolutely. You also have to have casual gamer realness.

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:06.000
You know, where it's like the girls who wear their son,

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:08.000
their Han Solo outfits, you know, because it's fall.

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:11.000
You carry around the pumpkin spice lattes, but they've got glasses on.

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:15.000
The only thing I'm worried about with doing that is that people would feel like it's extremely appropriated.

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:19.000
So I do think we if something like that were to happen,

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:23.000
there just needs to be some sort of way to make sure that it's done respectfully.

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:28.000
It would be different, though, if we got the Atlanta sisters involved.

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:32.000
So that way you bring it in for charity as well.

02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:36.000
You have the ball for charity. Part of the proceeds go to the con.

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:40.000
Part of the proceeds go to the sisters to give to LGBT charities.

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:42.000
Sorry, I'm screaming at this conversation.

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:44.000
And I have to say the ball.

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:47.000
SSU 100 Matt is like, Loki is lost in this conversation.

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
I'm laughing my ass off because Loki's over there.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:53.000
I'm just programming.

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:57.000
I'm just excluded from the conversation.

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:01.000
First time in a unity engine butch realness.

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
All right, moving on.

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:08.000
Let's move on. What the fuck is our next topic?

02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:10.000
I don't even know anywhere. I have to look up there.

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:12.000
Actually, you know what, though?

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:13.000
What?

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
We could do something like that here. We'll talk later.

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:18.000
Okay, let's talk later, because I just know I am.

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:19.000
How about some email?

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:21.000
No, I'm sorry. I am all about this.

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:22.000
Like, this is a genius idea.

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
Because I'm smart.

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:25.000
Once in a while.

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:28.000
Girl, please. I am smart all the time.

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:29.000
You just don't listen.

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:30.000
Respectfully. You're right.

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:34.000
We need to involve the right people to make sure that it is not a parody of itself.

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:38.000
That it is legit and pays respect to the people who brought this culture to us.

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:39.000
Absolutely.

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:42.000
So, I'll reach out to my sisters out there.

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
I'm on pretty good terms with...

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:48.000
I mean, I met a few of them in person because they were out here for Conclave.

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:49.000
So, I'll reach out.

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:50.000
Yeah.

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:53.000
Instead of having this bullshit balloon party...

02:15:53.000 --> 02:15:54.000
Well, they can have that too.

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
Just call it the bullshit balloon party.

02:15:56.000 --> 02:16:00.000
I'm always for more, more, more, instead of replace, replace, replace.

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:01.000
You know?

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:03.000
So, they can have the bullshit party.

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:04.000
That's right. Yes.

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
The bullshit balloon party is what it's going to be called.

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:07.000
But I'm going to the ball.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:08.000
But we're having the ball.

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:09.000
Alright. Anyway.

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:10.000
The cosplay ball.

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:11.000
The cosplay ball.

02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:13.000
Anyway, it's just so good.

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:14.000
Anyway, moving on.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:15.000
I'm smart. Anyway.

02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:16.000
Mailbag.

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:21.000
Hello, Alar. Thanks for the little pre-recorded show that you made a few weeks back.

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:27.000
I just wanted to toss in a thought about the Saturn import question posed by one of the listeners.

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:31.000
If you haven't already found one, look for a little cartridge called an Action Replay 4M+.

02:16:31.000 --> 02:16:34.000
I have a couple of them. Just sayin'.

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
It wears a few different hats.

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:39.000
It lets you play import games without needing a mod chip.

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:42.000
It acts as a backup memory for your saved games.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:50.000
It also acts as a RAM expansion cart for games that require it, such as Vampire Saver, Marvel Super Heroes, and Street Fighter, some King of Fighters games and others.

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:51.000
I'm going to throw in an anecdote.

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:55.000
You need the one that's got the switch on it that switches it between 4 and 1 meg cart.

02:16:55.000 --> 02:17:01.000
Because the KOF games do not play nice with, or the SNK games do not play nice with the 4 meg cart.

02:17:01.000 --> 02:17:02.000
Just sayin'.

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:05.000
It vastly improves your Saturn owning experience.

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:06.000
You really ought to grab one.

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:09.000
They can be had on eBay for under $40.

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:11.000
You might be able to find them at other places too.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:13.000
The only thing they don't let you do is play burns.

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:15.000
So, just saying.

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:16.000
I'll end with this.

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:25.000
While I'm greatly appreciative that you would entrust me with this extremely valuable President Cat IP, I'm not quite sure that I'm best equipped to handle it.

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:30.000
Actually, I'm terrified that I would not live up to the cat, the myth, the legend that is President Cat.

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:35.000
So, thanks, but I'm going to keep plaguing away at my projects over here that I'm about to delay again.

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
Babies are so time consuming.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:41.000
I say this as I turn back to Forza Horizon 4 yet again because this game is digital crack.

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:42.000
Oh well.

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
Warm regards, Aaron YYR.

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
A humble and respectful declination.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
But don't forget about Vectords.

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
Yeah, don't forget about Vectords though.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
Vectords needs to happen.

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:53.000
Alright.

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:55.000
So, would it be done in the style of like Vectrex?

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:56.000
Yes.

02:17:56.000 --> 02:18:00.000
Not necessarily Vectrex, but like, uh, what the hell is that game?

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:01.000
Tempest.

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:05.000
Tempest or I was thinking of like, um, God, they had him accuse her.

02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:08.000
I'm trying to think, what the hell was that tank game?

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:09.000
Oh, fuck.

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:10.000
No, I'm thinking something like-

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:11.000
Battlezone?

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:12.000
Not Battlezone.

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:13.000
I know what you mean though.

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:14.000
Maybe Battlezone.

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
But I'm thinking something like Tempest.

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:17.000
TMEC.

02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:18.000
Like TMEC.

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:19.000
Yeah, TMEC.

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:20.000
But I want something like Tempest.

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:25.000
Where all the turds are coming at you and you have to dodge the Vectords or else they

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:26.000
shit on you.

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
Let the man raise his baby.

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
But, but, this is good influence.

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:31.000
You know what though?

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:35.000
There is another person in this room that can make games, not necessarily finish them,

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
but can start making games.

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:40.000
You know, I would have if you haven't finished one.

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:41.000
I was about to read you and you, you, you.

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:42.000
Okay, good for you.

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:47.000
If you would finish one, I would actually even give you an entire pizza.

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:51.000
If, okay.

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:52.000
It'll be fucking gluten free or some shit.

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:53.000
You don't want that.

02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:54.000
Fuck that.

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:55.000
If, okay.

02:18:55.000 --> 02:19:02.000
If Loki finishes his game on the show, I will buy him the pizza of his choice.

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
The, the quadruple bacon pizza.

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:05.000
I will buy you-

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:06.000
That's too much bacon.

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:07.000
Triple bacon pizza.

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:13.000
I will buy you whatever pizza you want and garlic twists.

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:15.000
Rob will help me.

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:17.000
All right.

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:18.000
All right, Bobby.

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:21.000
It has to be finished this, this year.

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:22.000
Okay.

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:23.000
Okay.

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:24.000
This year.

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:28.000
You have to the end of the year for pizza and we're going to call this contest, which

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:31.000
only has one contestant.

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
Time to pizza.

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:35.000
All right.

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:36.000
I like it.

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:37.000
Time to pizza.

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:38.000
It has one contestant.

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:39.000
This guy's got one contestant.

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:40.000
There's one contestant in this contest.

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
I have a good shot of winning this one.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
So you're saying I have a chance.

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:45.000
I have a chance.

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:49.000
So you have at least a 50% chance of winning.

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
You either do it or you don't.

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:54.000
There is no try.

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:55.000
And maybe-

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:57.000
Maybe I'll make you a blanket, Loki.

02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:00.000
I'll ask Jordan what, what, what, what.

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:01.000
If-

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:02.000
Online coverage.

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:03.000
If-

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:04.000
Online company he uses.

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:09.000
If time to pizza is successful, I will open up time to pizza for the listeners.

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:12.000
Girl, that's a big, oh, that's a big order.

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:19.000
And whoever does a game worthy of getting the OLR stamp of approval on it one game next

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
year, I will buy you a pizza.

02:20:21.000 --> 02:20:22.000
All right.

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
I will have it delivered to your house.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:25.000
I'm serious.

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:31.000
Do you, do you know what I was told by somebody on one of those panels?

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:36.000
I'm sorry, I forget who, but apparently I think it was, I think, uh, Bobby, were you

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:37.000
there?

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:40.000
Was it the girl that was in the too many cooks thing?

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:44.000
Cause you know, we had a girl from the too many cooks video on one of our panels.

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:45.000
That's awesome.

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:49.000
And I think she was mentioning that you have, you have a plugin that you can put in on Twitch

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:53.000
and you can, Oh God, I almost, I almost don't want to finish this because dark soccer is

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.000
going to immediately go, we're fucking doing it.

02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:58.000
I'm already thinking we're going to do it, whatever it is.

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:04.000
You can actually install a thing where the viewers can buy you Uber eats and have it

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:09.000
delivered to you, but they never see your address because it's through the plugin.

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:13.000
So they just do it through the plugin and have you like actually like shit, I don't

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:14.000
want random garbage.

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:15.000
It's like, no, no.

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:20.000
You have like a list of like your preferred dishes and they just choose what it is.

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
But do you have to activate it if you're like actually hungry?

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:23.000
I don't know.

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:27.000
I didn't actually research this cause I didn't think we were actually going to do it because

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:28.000
I thought I would do it on my channel.

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:31.000
I thought it would be smart enough to not mention it here on the show.

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:32.000
Whoops.

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
I'm going to do it on my channel.

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
When I go up, y'all can feed me.

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:41.000
I mean, I have the stomach the size of like an apple, but y'all can feed me.

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
I like Korean food.

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:47.000
Now that the words are leaving my mouth, I'm like, Oh my God, can you imagine if we had

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
that button on this show?

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:52.000
Dark soccer is like, I want a taco.

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:53.000
Bing dong.

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:54.000
Taco.

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
Anyway, back to time to pizza.

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:57.000
Okay.

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:58.000
Cause I'm forming this right now.

02:21:58.000 --> 02:21:59.000
Okay.

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:00.000
We're the only contestant in this.

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:01.000
Do you see my finger on the thing?

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
Yes, but it's two, two and a half hours in girl.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:05.000
We got to finish the show.

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:06.000
Okay.

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
This year, you're the only contestant next year.

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
Top 10 entries.

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:17.000
I will consider one and December of next year, the winner gets a pizza because I'm a cheap

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:18.000
bitch.

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:19.000
That's at least 25 bucks.

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:20.000
All right.

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:21.000
Do we have another email?

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:22.000
Fuck no.

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:23.000
All right.

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:24.000
I have breaking news.

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:25.000
You ready?

02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:29.000
I would argue this is better than pizza, but you're probably going to disagree.

02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:32.000
It's it's a text message from Shane and shouldn't those be treasured.

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:38.000
And he's actually in chat, uh, and said, check your phone when Shane was the one who said,

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:42.000
I shouldn't be checking my phone while doing OLR, but here I am because he said so, but

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:43.000
this is important.

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:48.560
Um, I don't know if you said in your show already, but just announced crystal Chronicles

02:22:48.560 --> 02:22:57.040
is January 23rd with cross platform support for PS4, switch iOS, and Android girl.

02:22:57.040 --> 02:22:58.040
Cool.

02:22:58.040 --> 02:22:59.040
That's cool.

02:22:59.040 --> 02:23:00.040
Good.

02:23:00.040 --> 02:23:03.040
I, that cross platform on a game like that is a game changer.

02:23:03.040 --> 02:23:07.120
You had to clip that time to pizza.

02:23:07.120 --> 02:23:09.280
I love the clipping system on Twitch.

02:23:09.280 --> 02:23:10.280
It's wonderful.

02:23:10.280 --> 02:23:11.280
Keep me honest.

02:23:11.280 --> 02:23:18.280
I will get somebody a pizza, but it has, I do have a few criteria because I am a weirdo.

02:23:18.720 --> 02:23:23.200
And you have to be able to frame it in something that's going to be quirky enough for us to

02:23:23.200 --> 02:23:29.640
go, damn, you know, we have to be all right, let's cross the bridge of contestant number

02:23:29.640 --> 02:23:33.680
one finishing, and then we'll worry about unlight unloading it on the masses and the

02:23:33.680 --> 02:23:38.040
specifics of how that works because then when I talk about giveaways, there's going to be,

02:23:38.040 --> 02:23:41.720
there's going to be the Bobby Black Wolf on my shoulder that says, that says, give away

02:23:41.720 --> 02:23:42.720
laws.

02:23:42.720 --> 02:23:44.640
We've got to be careful what we're doing.

02:23:44.640 --> 02:23:46.640
This is me buying someone a pizza.

02:23:46.640 --> 02:23:47.640
Okay.

02:23:48.280 --> 02:23:53.040
I just have a criteria moving on next story, please.

02:23:53.040 --> 02:23:54.040
Loki.

02:23:55.040 --> 02:23:56.040
All right.

02:23:56.040 --> 02:24:01.360
Uh, so there's a new plants versus zombies game that's, uh, coming out and now let's

02:24:01.360 --> 02:24:02.360
be clear.

02:24:02.360 --> 02:24:07.720
This is not necessarily a new plants versus zombies puzzle game, but it's, you know, they're

02:24:07.720 --> 02:24:10.200
plants versus zombies, garden warfare type of game.

02:24:10.200 --> 02:24:13.520
So they have one now it's called battle for the neighborhood.

02:24:13.520 --> 02:24:20.400
It is a third person shooter, and of course they have now, um, different co-op units and

02:24:20.400 --> 02:24:24.800
there's free roam areas as well as an interactive social hub.

02:24:24.800 --> 02:24:33.480
Apparently you can play it now on PC, PlayStation four or Xbox one, and they have new characters.

02:24:33.480 --> 02:24:39.380
So three new characters, two co-op classes, um, and you can team up and battle together

02:24:39.380 --> 02:24:41.120
with other people.

02:24:41.120 --> 02:24:45.960
And then of course, uh, free roam maps, as I mentioned before, and some amusement park

02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:48.560
themed stuff as well.

02:24:48.560 --> 02:24:53.520
And I think this is a, I want, I thought this was a free to play game, but they also have

02:24:53.520 --> 02:24:56.680
a founder's edition, which is 29 99.

02:24:56.680 --> 02:25:01.840
Free to play stuff usually has founders packs that are like, you get extras stuff in the

02:25:01.840 --> 02:25:04.240
game because you're an early supporter.

02:25:04.240 --> 02:25:05.240
Yeah.

02:25:05.240 --> 02:25:09.960
So, um, yeah, so they also have a non founders version of the game is going to cost 10 bucks

02:25:09.960 --> 02:25:11.200
as well.

02:25:11.200 --> 02:25:13.920
Um, it looks okay.

02:25:13.920 --> 02:25:18.120
I never really played the second or first game of this.

02:25:18.120 --> 02:25:23.000
I know I have it in my library from one of those free PlayStation plus months, but I

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:24.000
don't know.

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:29.680
I just, I'm worried of any EA game, especially if it has microtransactions in it, but I don't

02:25:29.680 --> 02:25:30.680
know.

02:25:30.680 --> 02:25:31.680
It looks cute.

02:25:31.680 --> 02:25:34.680
It's nice to see that the plans versus zombie franchise is still going, even though it's

02:25:34.680 --> 02:25:38.080
not really the puzzle game it used to be, but the shooter game was cute.

02:25:38.080 --> 02:25:39.080
It was a free game.

02:25:39.120 --> 02:25:42.680
The other one was like a free download on Xbox at some point and I checked it out.

02:25:42.680 --> 02:25:43.680
It was cute.

02:25:43.680 --> 02:25:44.680
Yeah.

02:25:44.680 --> 02:25:45.680
It looks great.

02:25:45.680 --> 02:25:46.680
Shooters go.

02:25:46.680 --> 02:25:47.680
So yeah, I'm glad, I'm glad it's still going.

02:25:47.680 --> 02:25:48.680
I'm sure that's someone's cup of tea.

02:25:48.680 --> 02:25:49.680
Yep.

02:25:49.680 --> 02:25:50.680
All right.

02:25:50.680 --> 02:25:52.540
Moving on to another, uh, discord submitted story for this week.

02:25:52.540 --> 02:25:57.040
This one from dungeon buster actually sent us this story about, and it's from the guardian,

02:25:57.040 --> 02:26:00.200
which is kind of a, I think it's bigger in the UK, but this was actually the guardian's

02:26:00.200 --> 02:26:01.200
us edition.

02:26:01.200 --> 02:26:06.240
Um, and this is a story about, Oh boy, it's does loot boxes lead to gambling

02:26:06.240 --> 02:26:14.080
but I'm sure this is being presented to us because of the fact that here is a larger

02:26:14.080 --> 02:26:16.920
media site, you know, and the angle that they're taking on it.

02:26:16.920 --> 02:26:22.160
Well, I want to see what they say, but I have a thing to add to that too, to how it is.

02:26:22.160 --> 02:26:23.160
Sure.

02:26:23.160 --> 02:26:27.560
Um, and this is a story again, the guardian is reporting this about a gentleman named

02:26:27.560 --> 02:26:28.560
Nate.

02:26:28.560 --> 02:26:31.160
Nate, I'm not going to read the whole story for you guys, but, um, Adam Bradford is the

02:26:31.160 --> 02:26:33.680
kind of the subject of the story and the father David.

02:26:34.400 --> 02:26:38.640
And I guess what was happening is that the, the father was jailed for two years for stealing

02:26:38.640 --> 02:26:43.960
from employers to fund a compulsive online gaming habit, which is like, and then showed

02:26:43.960 --> 02:26:45.320
up in all the papers.

02:26:45.320 --> 02:26:48.320
So Adam was quoted in the story saying we were devastated because we didn't know what

02:26:48.320 --> 02:26:49.900
a gambling addiction really was.

02:26:49.900 --> 02:26:55.280
And so he made this organization called a safer online gambling group.

02:26:55.280 --> 02:26:59.280
And they're saying that basically the addiction was a psychological problem, it needed treatment

02:26:59.280 --> 02:27:00.280
and so forth.

02:27:00.280 --> 02:27:03.280
And then they talk about kind of like how it was portrayed in the media about like,

02:27:03.280 --> 02:27:05.440
you know, he was just an addict and all this stuff.

02:27:05.440 --> 02:27:10.960
Um, but, uh, the point about this is because this, this forum that they created this club,

02:27:10.960 --> 02:27:14.320
they created the safer online gambling group, a SOG.

02:27:14.320 --> 02:27:17.060
It looks like it says soggy, but it's SOG.

02:27:17.060 --> 02:27:23.520
So SOG made this and they launched a campaign, this SOG organization, tackling what happens

02:27:23.520 --> 02:27:29.000
to children and what they are saying is a link between gambling and gaming because of

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:30.480
loot boxes.

02:27:30.480 --> 02:27:34.980
And of course, as we all know, loot boxes are the in game rewards and so forth.

02:27:34.980 --> 02:27:39.240
And Adam, one of the founders of this says it's a game of chance as to whether or not

02:27:39.240 --> 02:27:42.560
you're going to get a better weapon or a better player or extra points.

02:27:42.560 --> 02:27:45.000
Um, odds are not disclosed.

02:27:45.000 --> 02:27:47.240
That's why we're comparing it to gambling.

02:27:47.240 --> 02:27:51.660
And then they're saying that this simulated gambling leads to betting for children.

02:27:51.660 --> 02:27:56.240
One more quote here from the older one that was in jail for the gambling, David, uh, gambling

02:27:56.240 --> 02:27:59.700
and gaming have been neighbors divided by a brick wall.

02:27:59.700 --> 02:28:01.820
But now there's a gateway in it.

02:28:01.820 --> 02:28:04.800
And I don't think that gateway is being policed.

02:28:04.800 --> 02:28:08.340
Now I don't see anywhere in this article, unless it comes up much later, but it doesn't

02:28:08.340 --> 02:28:12.460
talk about what's happening, um, in the U S with Nintendo.

02:28:12.460 --> 02:28:13.460
Yeah.

02:28:13.460 --> 02:28:17.920
I don't see the Nintendo Microsoft PlayStation Alliance, you know, about how they're going

02:28:17.920 --> 02:28:20.060
to force the disclosure in the stores.

02:28:20.060 --> 02:28:22.020
That's not mentioned in here.

02:28:22.020 --> 02:28:25.420
Um, surprised they didn't do the research or whatever.

02:28:25.420 --> 02:28:26.420
What's the date.

02:28:26.420 --> 02:28:28.460
I want to make sure this article has a recent date on it.

02:28:28.620 --> 02:28:29.860
Yeah. Third of September.

02:28:29.860 --> 02:28:31.220
So it was just from this last week.

02:28:31.220 --> 02:28:34.660
Yeah. So you want to talk about bad timing on the part of the games industry.

02:28:34.660 --> 02:28:38.540
So you know how there's this whole thing where they're investigating, you know, kind of ties

02:28:38.540 --> 02:28:40.460
between loot boxes and gambling and stuff like that.

02:28:41.340 --> 02:28:47.140
So what's a company like take two you say going to do in their brand new sports game to

02:28:47.340 --> 02:28:49.820
help make sure that that line isn't crossed.

02:28:50.340 --> 02:28:52.980
Oh, I know. Let's put fucking gambling in the game.

02:28:52.980 --> 02:28:55.700
So they literally have in their loot boxes.

02:28:56.380 --> 02:28:58.180
It's a fucking slot machine.

02:28:58.580 --> 02:29:01.140
Mind you that the game is rated E for everyone.

02:29:01.140 --> 02:29:07.300
It's a fucking slot machine that you have to pull that they literally like simulates

02:29:07.300 --> 02:29:10.940
pulling a slot machine to see what fucking player card you're going.

02:29:11.100 --> 02:29:14.500
They had a whole trailer dedicated to the goddamn loot boxes.

02:29:14.780 --> 02:29:16.220
I do. I do remember seeing that trailer.

02:29:16.340 --> 02:29:18.060
Like what the fuck is wrong with you?

02:29:18.060 --> 02:29:19.940
Stupid idiots. I mean, like you're right.

02:29:19.940 --> 02:29:21.780
That is why we have this.

02:29:21.780 --> 02:29:26.180
And as much as we want to sit here and say these guys are well, I don't know.

02:29:26.180 --> 02:29:29.540
I don't know if I want to sit here and say these guys are full of it because we haven't

02:29:29.540 --> 02:29:31.380
really been on this.

02:29:31.380 --> 02:29:33.620
Like, I don't really love the loot box thing.

02:29:33.620 --> 02:29:37.660
And I think, yeah, they need to disclose the odds on all this stuff and those loot boxes.

02:29:37.820 --> 02:29:41.020
Although what I don't want, I don't want to see the loot boxes regulated by the

02:29:41.020 --> 02:29:44.980
government because I don't necessarily trust our government to regulate things correctly.

02:29:44.980 --> 02:29:47.700
That's just the reality of the year we live in in twenty nineteen.

02:29:47.980 --> 02:29:54.180
So I would prefer that the, you know, the publishers and the storefronts, which to be

02:29:54.220 --> 02:29:55.460
fair, they did.

02:29:55.460 --> 02:29:58.900
And that was the big, you know, kind of footnote we had a couple of weeks ago was that,

02:29:58.900 --> 02:30:02.340
you know, Nintendo and Microsoft and Sony are going to address this on their end and

02:30:02.340 --> 02:30:04.420
they're going to do something within the stores to regulate it.

02:30:04.540 --> 02:30:08.780
So hopefully the government doesn't feel the need to step in and regulate it, because

02:30:08.780 --> 02:30:14.380
unfortunately, when you've got what Take-Two is doing, it plays right into this.

02:30:14.900 --> 02:30:15.860
And so.

02:30:16.940 --> 02:30:22.660
Yeah, and to clarify, you don't win money with the slot machine, but the fact is that

02:30:22.860 --> 02:30:26.260
they keep comparing loot boxes with the random chance to get something.

02:30:26.260 --> 02:30:30.580
And yes, it's not necessarily money and you're not necessarily spending real money

02:30:31.660 --> 02:30:36.220
for that, but you're you're spending real money to buy fake money to spend on the, you

02:30:36.220 --> 02:30:38.180
know, the random chance to get something.

02:30:38.580 --> 02:30:42.860
But the problem is, though, is they've been trying to say, well, it's not, you know,

02:30:42.860 --> 02:30:48.460
exactly the same as gambling because, you know, there's it's not really going through

02:30:48.460 --> 02:30:50.260
the same motions as gambling.

02:30:50.260 --> 02:30:55.860
It's kind of like a random loop, you know, like random surprise egg or something like

02:30:55.860 --> 02:31:00.420
that. But then you make it look like a casino game and that's the problem.

02:31:00.420 --> 02:31:02.380
It's like, OK, well, you can't use that excuse.

02:31:02.380 --> 02:31:05.620
Well, it doesn't it's not it's not teaching kids how to gamble.

02:31:05.740 --> 02:31:08.660
It's fucking teaching them how to play a slot machine.

02:31:08.660 --> 02:31:10.100
I mean, that's I get it.

02:31:10.100 --> 02:31:15.660
You're winning the loot cards and stuff they have, but the cards have different values

02:31:15.660 --> 02:31:19.860
to them because you're paying money to try to get a chance to get these cards.

02:31:19.900 --> 02:31:26.180
It's that would be like saying that, like, if I go and buy, you know, a Magic the

02:31:26.180 --> 02:31:30.260
Gathering pack or something like that and there's a rare card in there, that rare card

02:31:30.260 --> 02:31:32.940
has value because you could technically sell it.

02:31:33.660 --> 02:31:37.940
Granted, in this game, you can't sell any of the stuff that you get in these loot boxes,

02:31:37.940 --> 02:31:42.300
but that's kind of they're basically writing the line as much as they can.

02:31:42.900 --> 02:31:46.740
Let me read this very honest comment here from SSJ100Matt in our chat room at

02:31:46.740 --> 02:31:48.060
twitch.tv slash VOG Network.

02:31:48.260 --> 02:31:52.660
SSJ100Matt says, I used to buy ultimate team card packs for the NHL franchise.

02:31:52.900 --> 02:31:57.140
I once spent two hundred and fifty dollars just on these card packs in an NHL game.

02:31:57.420 --> 02:32:00.860
The ultimate team structure is set up that in order for you to have a good team, you

02:32:00.860 --> 02:32:02.660
need to spend money to get better players.

02:32:02.860 --> 02:32:05.140
If you don't, you fall behind and have a trash team.

02:32:05.300 --> 02:32:07.460
I realize this, but I kept putting money into it.

02:32:07.460 --> 02:32:10.660
Why? Because I was addicted to it and wanted to have a better team.

02:32:10.860 --> 02:32:14.620
I've stopped playing that mode years ago when I realized it wasn't worth it.

02:32:14.940 --> 02:32:21.460
So some very real, harsh, true feedback from our chat about how, you know,

02:32:21.460 --> 02:32:25.780
sometimes this maybe that desire, the competitive edge, that desire for

02:32:25.780 --> 02:32:29.620
competition, like drives us to spend a lot of money.

02:32:29.620 --> 02:32:32.580
And they know that more than I care to admit on Pokemon Go.

02:32:32.780 --> 02:32:35.620
At least I don't feel like I'm gambling, like I know what I'm buying.

02:32:35.620 --> 02:32:41.340
But at the same time, you know, it is kind of when you throw the balls at the raid

02:32:41.340 --> 02:32:42.980
things, there's no guarantee you're going to catch it.

02:32:43.020 --> 02:32:45.300
Shinies are a random chance as well, right?

02:32:45.900 --> 02:32:49.620
Right. Well, they know, though, like when they're designing games, they create a

02:32:49.620 --> 02:32:53.460
problem that they then also create the solution for with these loot boxes or in

02:32:53.460 --> 02:32:57.620
game purchases. You know, like they have a lot of games where you can buy XP

02:32:57.620 --> 02:33:00.060
bonus or XP boosts or whatever.

02:33:00.380 --> 02:33:04.580
They purposely slow down the XP in the game so that you want to buy those XP

02:33:04.580 --> 02:33:08.620
boosts. That's why. And they say it's just, you know, well, it's we're giving you the

02:33:08.620 --> 02:33:10.860
opportunity to do that. You don't have to do that.

02:33:10.860 --> 02:33:14.980
But yes, they're forcing you in the direction or they're trying to prod you in

02:33:14.980 --> 02:33:18.980
the right direction for them, because that's how they're designing the game.

02:33:18.980 --> 02:33:22.420
They have to balance it around that, just like when, for example, they removed the

02:33:22.420 --> 02:33:25.260
loot boxes from that Lord of the Rings game.

02:33:25.460 --> 02:33:29.500
They had to rebalance the whole game because while they said, oh, the loot boxes

02:33:29.500 --> 02:33:32.980
don't really affect the gameplay, they did affect the gameplay and they had to

02:33:32.980 --> 02:33:36.380
rebalance the whole game in order for it to feel right after they removed the loot

02:33:36.380 --> 02:33:37.900
boxes. All right.

02:33:38.060 --> 02:33:41.860
So anyway, just to just to kind of wrap this up so we can move on.

02:33:41.860 --> 02:33:46.420
So our show isn't too long tonight, but it just goes to show that, you know, despite

02:33:46.420 --> 02:33:50.300
the fact that we have the Microsoft Nintendo Sony news about the storefronts, this

02:33:50.300 --> 02:33:51.820
issue still is not over.

02:33:51.820 --> 02:33:54.980
This article that got linked to us in Discord is still from this week.

02:33:55.180 --> 02:33:57.380
This is a conversation that is still continuing.

02:33:57.540 --> 02:34:01.020
This trailer that you talked about from Take Two is still very recent.

02:34:01.020 --> 02:34:04.460
So this issue not on the other side of it yet.

02:34:04.500 --> 02:34:07.740
So this is something the gaming industry really has to think about how they're going

02:34:07.740 --> 02:34:11.500
to tackle. Anyway, in the interest of time, we're going to move on to our next story,

02:34:11.500 --> 02:34:12.620
which is from Dark Sakura.

02:34:13.500 --> 02:34:14.700
EA won an award.

02:34:15.180 --> 02:34:16.860
They won a Guinness World Record.

02:34:17.300 --> 02:34:22.660
You know what for? For having the most downvoted comment in Reddit history.

02:34:23.420 --> 02:34:29.900
Yep. And also it was ironically the record for the 2020 Guinness book was also posted

02:34:29.900 --> 02:34:31.500
on Reddit. So, yay.

02:34:32.500 --> 02:34:40.940
But anyway, the comment, sorry, had 683,000 downvotes.

02:34:41.580 --> 02:34:42.860
And this was the comment.

02:34:42.860 --> 02:34:45.580
I'm going to read it and everyone will go, oh, that?

02:34:47.580 --> 02:34:49.540
And this was about Star Wars Battlefront.

02:34:50.340 --> 02:34:54.620
The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment from unlocking

02:34:54.620 --> 02:34:55.820
different heroes. Yep.

02:34:55.860 --> 02:34:57.300
You guessed it, it's loot boxes.

02:34:58.020 --> 02:35:03.620
As for costs, we selected initial values based upon data from the open beta and adjustments

02:35:03.620 --> 02:35:05.420
made to milestone rewards before launch.

02:35:05.660 --> 02:35:10.420
Among other things, we're looking at average per player credit earn rates on a daily basis

02:35:10.420 --> 02:35:13.820
and would be making constant adjustments to ensure that players have challenges that are

02:35:13.820 --> 02:35:17.180
compelling, rewarding and, of course, attainable via gameplay.

02:35:17.500 --> 02:35:21.620
We appreciate the candid feedback and the passion the community has put forth around the

02:35:21.620 --> 02:35:25.220
current topics here on Reddit, our forums and across numerous social media outlets.

02:35:25.460 --> 02:35:28.940
Our team will continue to make changes and monitor community feedback and update, blah,

02:35:28.940 --> 02:35:35.620
blah, blah. Anyways, so, yeah, it was regarding having to unlock characters like Darth

02:35:35.620 --> 02:35:40.940
Vader and Luke Skywalker in Star Wars Battlefront 2 in 2017 through loot boxes.

02:35:41.620 --> 02:35:45.300
Yep. Not surprised to hear that that was the winner.

02:35:45.300 --> 02:35:47.980
Well, I remember talking about was the most downvoted comment in Reddit history at the

02:35:47.980 --> 02:35:52.140
time. But now the fact that, like, the Guinness World Record book has, like, certified,

02:35:52.140 --> 02:35:55.020
like, wow, your comment was sucky.

02:35:55.220 --> 02:36:01.140
Like the fact that that is like, here's this piece of paper from Guinness acknowledging

02:36:01.300 --> 02:36:02.980
you wrote a dumb thing.

02:36:03.540 --> 02:36:04.780
You did a stupid.

02:36:05.180 --> 02:36:06.540
You did a stupid thing.

02:36:06.540 --> 02:36:08.140
Congratulations, EA.

02:36:08.380 --> 02:36:09.860
You win at sucking.

02:36:11.300 --> 02:36:17.620
There's just some type of like very sad satisfaction coming out of that.

02:36:17.620 --> 02:36:20.020
There is an absolute sad trombone moment.

02:36:20.020 --> 02:36:23.660
How hard is it? How much does it cost to get Guinness to, like, certify something?

02:36:23.980 --> 02:36:28.580
Like, should we try to see if we really are the longest running, like, video game show

02:36:28.580 --> 02:36:30.140
Internet thing? I don't know what we'd call it.

02:36:30.380 --> 02:36:35.700
I know. I know. But, like, you know, the having the actual Guinness name behind it, I

02:36:35.700 --> 02:36:38.540
could put that on the fucking banner world record holder.

02:36:38.540 --> 02:36:39.580
I'll look into it.

02:36:39.740 --> 02:36:40.820
Yeah, look into it.

02:36:41.100 --> 02:36:42.740
With all the other things I'm looking into.

02:36:42.740 --> 02:36:44.180
Can you bring that to the next meeting?

02:36:46.620 --> 02:36:48.620
You better invest in the good coffee.

02:36:49.820 --> 02:36:52.220
Farina, we just bought. I got pumpkin spice coffee.

02:36:52.220 --> 02:36:53.140
That is the good coffee.

02:36:53.140 --> 02:36:55.260
Girl, I brought you basic bitch cookies.

02:36:55.460 --> 02:36:56.540
I suggest you eat one.

02:36:56.540 --> 02:36:58.700
I will eat one. I might eat one later after the credits.

02:36:58.700 --> 02:37:00.580
All right. I want to know what you think.

02:37:00.940 --> 02:37:04.780
I know I might eat one after the credits, but I had Panda Express earlier, so I'm still

02:37:04.780 --> 02:37:04.940
like.

02:37:04.940 --> 02:37:06.580
I had Panda Express earlier too.

02:37:06.580 --> 02:37:08.020
I know. We're on the same wavelength.

02:37:08.020 --> 02:37:10.660
All right. Anyway, next story.

02:37:10.980 --> 02:37:16.620
Loki, this this this involves another host here at the Voice of the Geeks network, right?

02:37:16.860 --> 02:37:18.460
Yeah. So it's an inside joke.

02:37:18.460 --> 02:37:19.460
It's not. Yeah.

02:37:19.620 --> 02:37:26.980
So Kojima mentioned that he is incorporating a very easy mode into Death Stranding.

02:37:27.420 --> 02:37:33.260
So basically, this would be kind of geared towards like Bobby Black Wolf.

02:37:33.740 --> 02:37:34.220
Maybe.

02:37:35.580 --> 02:37:39.860
He basically said, you know, normally there is only an easy mode, but we added a very

02:37:39.860 --> 02:37:46.100
easy mode for movie fans, since we have real actors like Norman Reedus, Mads Mikkelsen,

02:37:46.100 --> 02:37:53.820
and Lea Sido starred in, even though even Yano-san, who never completed the first stage

02:37:53.820 --> 02:37:57.660
of Pac-Man, was able to complete the game on very easy mode.

02:37:59.740 --> 02:38:03.340
So they have normal or hard mode for action game fans.

02:38:03.340 --> 02:38:07.420
So, you know, accessibility is not bad, especially with a game that's like very

02:38:09.140 --> 02:38:10.220
cinematic like this.

02:38:10.220 --> 02:38:13.500
I mean, I could see how some people just may not want to.

02:38:13.540 --> 02:38:18.700
They may, I don't know, maybe just they don't want to play through it or like, yeah.

02:38:18.740 --> 02:38:23.380
Even a game like Mass Effect, correct me if I'm wrong, Darsakha, didn't Mass Effect 3

02:38:23.380 --> 02:38:28.340
like have a mode where you could like up the combat and just like forget the story and

02:38:28.340 --> 02:38:29.300
just play the combat mode?

02:38:30.060 --> 02:38:34.220
You could do a mode that was like just the story elements without any of the combat

02:38:34.220 --> 02:38:34.900
sequences.

02:38:34.900 --> 02:38:38.220
Yeah, but I always did both because I like to explore the levels.

02:38:38.260 --> 02:38:42.220
Right. And I think there was there was also a thing where like you make some decisions

02:38:42.220 --> 02:38:46.220
during combat sometimes, so you actually are missing a little bit if you do it that

02:38:46.220 --> 02:38:51.100
way. But, you know, this whole concept of let's have the

02:38:51.100 --> 02:38:55.460
game be more of a narrative thing like a movie is not completely new.

02:38:55.500 --> 02:39:00.500
We know. I mean, you know, for all the discussion we've had about a walking

02:39:00.500 --> 02:39:01.820
simulator. Right.

02:39:01.820 --> 02:39:05.380
And those types of games, like everybody's gone to the rapture and stuff, these games

02:39:05.380 --> 02:39:06.900
that you don't die, you don't lose.

02:39:07.100 --> 02:39:09.780
You just have to walk around and talk to the right people, you know.

02:39:09.780 --> 02:39:13.060
But I still think those games can be very powerful and very good.

02:39:13.060 --> 02:39:16.020
So, yeah, I think it's I think it's fine that Death Stranding is having it.

02:39:16.140 --> 02:39:19.740
And if you don't know, the inside joke comes from a long way back.

02:39:19.740 --> 02:39:23.580
There was a controversy about the game Borderlands and the BFF mode.

02:39:23.940 --> 02:39:27.660
Anyway, Bobby Black Wolf had one of the developers on his show and suggested I don't

02:39:27.660 --> 02:39:31.980
remember how it all came to I'm really paraphrasing here, but essentially BFF was

02:39:31.980 --> 02:39:36.940
recategorized to mean Black Wolf Friends Forever mode because Bobby Black Wolf confessed

02:39:36.940 --> 02:39:41.620
that he is he's not necessarily the most skilled game player in the world, which is

02:39:41.620 --> 02:39:44.140
fine. You can love video games and suck at them.

02:39:44.140 --> 02:39:45.420
I'm living proof as well.

02:39:46.460 --> 02:39:52.260
But I'll probably if if I do play Death Stranding, which I I probably will, but I'm

02:39:52.260 --> 02:39:55.420
like, there's a lot of games that are asking for my money over these next couple of

02:39:55.420 --> 02:39:58.860
months. We'll see. I'll probably play an easy mode.

02:39:59.740 --> 02:40:04.420
I won't play in very easy mode, but I'll play in an easy mode.

02:40:04.900 --> 02:40:06.940
All right, so Alan's coming on camera.

02:40:07.140 --> 02:40:09.420
Yeah. Make sure you have pants on, please, or something that.

02:40:09.700 --> 02:40:12.460
So what you brought Oreos to the studio.

02:40:12.620 --> 02:40:13.900
Oh, and what are these?

02:40:13.900 --> 02:40:16.260
So these are what flavors is maple cream.

02:40:16.980 --> 02:40:18.620
Oh, hmm.

02:40:18.940 --> 02:40:21.060
It does because of all those freaking candles.

02:40:21.060 --> 02:40:23.860
I brought cookies. I made pumpkin spice cookies.

02:40:23.860 --> 02:40:26.980
Oh, yeah. You can you can have the first of these cookies.

02:40:26.980 --> 02:40:28.020
I need to know what they taste like.

02:40:28.020 --> 02:40:29.940
Take one of those and and enjoy them.

02:40:30.860 --> 02:40:33.780
All right. But well, if I don't eat one of those, she's going to be very upset.

02:40:33.820 --> 02:40:35.980
She made them like these were made in a factory.

02:40:35.980 --> 02:40:38.460
Those were made at home with those were made with my heart.

02:40:38.460 --> 02:40:41.020
All right. Anyway, just watch it for the red stuff.

02:40:42.540 --> 02:40:47.300
All right. Also, yeah, Tiger Club giving us a related tweet in our chat room saying

02:40:47.300 --> 02:40:49.860
Keanu Reeves stopped by to see Kojima recently.

02:40:49.860 --> 02:40:51.220
That's true. I did see that picture.

02:40:51.220 --> 02:40:52.260
That's fun. Cool.

02:40:52.260 --> 02:40:54.260
I wonder what project they're working on.

02:40:54.260 --> 02:40:55.420
I'd be curious about that.

02:40:55.420 --> 02:41:00.940
Hmm. Anyway, as you know, Matt says, why should someone get good in order to beat a

02:41:00.940 --> 02:41:03.740
game that they just want to finish for the story or other reasons?

02:41:03.740 --> 02:41:11.340
Yeah, exactly. I looked at oh, Pixelpaca says, I looked up Guinness records.

02:41:11.580 --> 02:41:17.740
There is one for longest running weekly podcast, same host and no submittals for it.

02:41:18.740 --> 02:41:23.060
But I well, but here OK, here's the thing, because if we go to the level like Guinness,

02:41:23.460 --> 02:41:29.100
do we get tripped up on a technicality that this show wasn't a podcast in 2002, the show

02:41:29.100 --> 02:41:33.940
existed in 2002, but it wasn't a podcast until 2004.

02:41:35.060 --> 02:41:38.700
I don't know, so that's that's that's where things get tricky.

02:41:38.860 --> 02:41:42.660
So technically, I'm OK with saying we're the longest running video game online show.

02:41:42.940 --> 02:41:46.860
How about longest running live video game show?

02:41:46.860 --> 02:41:52.500
That's a good one, too, because we've always been mostly live except for like 98 percent

02:41:52.500 --> 02:41:54.500
live. Yeah, I don't know.

02:41:54.900 --> 02:41:56.020
We'll look into it. We will.

02:41:56.220 --> 02:41:57.220
Anyway, we need to move on.

02:41:58.220 --> 02:42:01.220
One more story. Guess what tomorrow is?

02:42:01.540 --> 02:42:07.300
Tomorrow is or well, today, for many of you listening on the podcast feed, September

02:42:07.300 --> 02:42:13.820
9th, 2019, which means 20 years ago was nine nine ninety nine.

02:42:13.980 --> 02:42:15.860
And what happened on that day?

02:42:15.860 --> 02:42:18.220
Nine, nine, ninety nine Dreamcast.

02:42:18.380 --> 02:42:19.620
No, it's Final Fantasy eight.

02:42:21.860 --> 02:42:23.540
No, nine, nine, ninety nine was the U.S.

02:42:23.540 --> 02:42:25.020
release of the Dreamcast. No, I know it was both.

02:42:26.780 --> 02:42:27.780
But you're right. Yes, of course.

02:42:27.900 --> 02:42:29.380
Yes, of course. Why is what's written up there?

02:42:29.380 --> 02:42:30.580
It's this Dreamcast anniversary.

02:42:30.580 --> 02:42:31.860
Dreamcast is the most important.

02:42:31.860 --> 02:42:35.900
That's right. Dreamcast was released on nine nine ninety nine.

02:42:36.540 --> 02:42:41.580
And what's interesting about the whole kind of coincidence of the 20th anniversary coming

02:42:41.580 --> 02:42:44.340
up, you know, Shenmue three is finally coming out soon.

02:42:44.820 --> 02:42:48.340
There's actually going to be a PlayStation four collector's edition that will come with a

02:42:48.340 --> 02:42:52.540
Dreamcast style case from Limited Run Games.

02:42:52.700 --> 02:42:58.460
And of course, the preorders are going up on nine nine at twelve Eastern.

02:42:58.860 --> 02:43:00.580
That's nine a.m. Pacific.

02:43:01.420 --> 02:43:03.020
So, yeah, check that out.

02:43:03.180 --> 02:43:05.860
So you can order that if you want at limited run games dot com.

02:43:05.860 --> 02:43:09.620
And it does have like a little Dreamcast pack for Shenmue three, which I thought is pretty

02:43:09.620 --> 02:43:14.260
cool. But I also thought quickly before we open up the discord and take some calls.

02:43:14.260 --> 02:43:18.020
And if you want to call us tonight, head on over to our discord server over at vog network

02:43:18.020 --> 02:43:21.460
dot com slash discord and join the green room.

02:43:23.060 --> 02:43:28.740
And before we get to those calls, I'm just curious of some Dreamcast memories here in

02:43:28.740 --> 02:43:32.940
studio. So what are some of your favorite like Dreamcast memories?

02:43:33.220 --> 02:43:35.860
Darcy, are you guys like camped out and got that?

02:43:36.140 --> 02:43:37.540
Did you see the Japanese system?

02:43:37.660 --> 02:43:41.180
Well, we already had that. Yeah, but we we did camp out.

02:43:41.340 --> 02:43:47.780
We we were in the line for the I don't think it was I think it was a game stop.

02:43:48.060 --> 02:43:50.220
Finally, or maybe it was the E.B.

02:43:51.260 --> 02:43:57.620
I'm trying to remember, but we we camped out at Arden Fair Mall and my friend Melissa and

02:43:57.620 --> 02:44:02.060
I went over to Barnes and Noble to buy books from the cheap section to read in line.

02:44:02.860 --> 02:44:03.540
So.

02:44:05.220 --> 02:44:10.540
Yeah, we we camped and got a Dreamcast and Dan and I were like, OK, we've got another

02:44:10.540 --> 02:44:12.500
Dreamcast. What are we going to do?

02:44:13.180 --> 02:44:17.660
And because we'd already been playing our Dreamcast for a while.

02:44:18.580 --> 02:44:19.820
But it was cool.

02:44:20.060 --> 02:44:24.020
It was it wasn't the last time I camped out for a system, but it was one of the last few

02:44:24.020 --> 02:44:28.220
times I camped out. So I would say the Nintendo Wii was last time I remember camping

02:44:28.220 --> 02:44:30.540
out. That was a big to do because that was when we went around.

02:44:30.540 --> 02:44:32.140
We were giving out doughnuts to people locally.

02:44:32.380 --> 02:44:35.660
That was a lot of fun. I wish I wasn't camping out for the Wii U.

02:44:35.660 --> 02:44:36.980
I camped out for the Wii. No, I know.

02:44:37.340 --> 02:44:39.340
I'm sorry. I meant the Wii. But you weren't there with me.

02:44:39.340 --> 02:44:41.340
That was me and Kristen. No, I went with you guys for a little.

02:44:41.340 --> 02:44:43.060
I didn't stay overnight. You were there overnight.

02:44:43.060 --> 02:44:44.220
Chris and I stayed overnight. Yeah.

02:44:44.260 --> 02:44:45.940
Extra for when that was I pay.

02:44:46.100 --> 02:44:50.260
I said extra for if you go camp out for it, I'll let you pick one of the games I buy.

02:44:50.260 --> 02:44:53.660
And he did it because he he knew he'd have access to it because we'd be in the same

02:44:53.660 --> 02:44:56.180
house. So he did it because I was like, I can't stay up all night.

02:44:56.300 --> 02:45:00.180
Chris and I went out and and then they went out to go get

02:45:02.100 --> 02:45:04.700
it was doughnuts and orange soda and coffee.

02:45:04.700 --> 02:45:06.020
We got doughnuts and coffee.

02:45:06.140 --> 02:45:10.260
Yeah, there was orange soda involved, though, because someone let us cut a place in

02:45:10.260 --> 02:45:12.900
line because it was like it was the people who recognized our show.

02:45:13.020 --> 02:45:15.540
Yeah, they were like, you're on my iPod like right now.

02:45:15.620 --> 02:45:17.100
Yeah, I remember that. That was awesome.

02:45:17.100 --> 02:45:18.580
I wonder if that guy still isn't.

02:45:18.580 --> 02:45:20.620
Well, anyway, that was that was a really fun time.

02:45:20.620 --> 02:45:25.140
And we just hung out like we had, um, we had their laptop

02:45:25.420 --> 02:45:28.660
and we just like did chat based role play

02:45:29.260 --> 02:45:31.660
the night and just talked about stuff and hung out.

02:45:31.660 --> 02:45:33.180
It was actually really cool. Yeah.

02:45:33.180 --> 02:45:34.540
So, yeah, that was a fun night.

02:45:34.540 --> 02:45:36.580
Anyway, sorry. It was supposed to be the Dreamcast, not the Wii.

02:45:36.580 --> 02:45:37.540
What about you, Loki?

02:45:37.540 --> 02:45:39.620
Uh, my Dreamcast. I got it.

02:45:39.620 --> 02:45:41.060
Accuse our all nighter.

02:45:41.060 --> 02:45:43.820
I won it in a raffle.

02:45:43.820 --> 02:45:47.660
Yeah. So I wasn't actually planning on picking up a Dreamcast ever.

02:45:47.660 --> 02:45:49.460
And then I won it.

02:45:49.460 --> 02:45:52.060
And so I was like, OK, cool. Buy some games.

02:45:52.700 --> 02:45:55.580
And I bought games for it.

02:45:55.580 --> 02:45:58.540
Shad Starzik or Shane in our chat wants to point out.

02:45:59.020 --> 02:46:00.460
Oops, this comment just scrolled off.

02:46:00.460 --> 02:46:03.020
I camped out at an EB Games for my Dreamcast.

02:46:03.220 --> 02:46:06.180
I was so freaking excited for it, and it was not a disappointment.

02:46:06.180 --> 02:46:07.740
And I miss it so much.

02:46:07.740 --> 02:46:09.100
Also kind of piggybacking on that.

02:46:09.140 --> 02:46:12.380
I camp out for like every system, even if I preorder it in advance.

02:46:12.620 --> 02:46:15.140
Yeah, but I feel like so many people just like order it off Amazon now

02:46:15.140 --> 02:46:16.540
and it's just waiting for them when they get home.

02:46:16.540 --> 02:46:18.500
But that's how the PlayStation five is going to work.

02:46:18.500 --> 02:46:20.020
I don't think people are going to camp out for it.

02:46:20.020 --> 02:46:21.980
They're just going to order it online and it'll be delivered

02:46:21.980 --> 02:46:22.660
while they're at work.

02:46:22.660 --> 02:46:24.700
You know, that's I feel like that's kind of where it's going.

02:46:24.740 --> 02:46:25.900
We'll see. I don't know.

02:46:25.900 --> 02:46:28.780
Maybe we will still have the camp outs because it's not like every system

02:46:28.780 --> 02:46:29.860
is going to go to Amazon.

02:46:29.860 --> 02:46:31.780
Best Buy will still have some.

02:46:31.780 --> 02:46:33.420
GameStop will still have some.

02:46:33.420 --> 02:46:35.180
And, you know, Walmarts and Targets.

02:46:35.180 --> 02:46:38.860
So who knows? Maybe the systems will see the camping out thing happen again.

02:46:38.860 --> 02:46:40.420
So we'll see.

02:46:41.820 --> 02:46:45.100
Let's see my dream, because I didn't get on board with Dreamcast until later,

02:46:45.340 --> 02:46:49.020
because I actually fell out of gaming for a couple of years

02:46:49.020 --> 02:46:51.900
around the time I was in college and right after and trying to get my

02:46:52.100 --> 02:46:54.700
my bearings and like my career and things like that.

02:46:54.900 --> 02:46:59.580
So I didn't get the Dreamcast until they were marked down to like forty dollars.

02:46:59.900 --> 02:47:04.020
And I went and I bought a Dreamcast way after the fact, because I learned

02:47:04.020 --> 02:47:07.620
that you could like burn your own discs with a homebrew, including it.

02:47:07.620 --> 02:47:09.740
This is probably like after I knew you and you,

02:47:09.740 --> 02:47:14.460
because I remember like we we burned a disc of NES games.

02:47:14.820 --> 02:47:17.540
Julie had that server, remember?

02:47:17.540 --> 02:47:18.780
Oh, that's right.

02:47:18.780 --> 02:47:21.900
Because I remember I just remember using the Dreamcast to play the guardian

02:47:21.900 --> 02:47:24.780
legend, which is a perfectly acceptable use of a Sega Dreamcast.

02:47:25.140 --> 02:47:30.700
But then I also discovered the wonders and awesomes of Phantasy Star online.

02:47:30.700 --> 02:47:33.540
And I was playing I found a cheap copy of that and started playing that.

02:47:33.540 --> 02:47:35.700
And I was like, this game is fucking awesome.

02:47:35.700 --> 02:47:38.940
So like I was really late to the party, but I loved it.

02:47:38.940 --> 02:47:41.980
So that was that was my Dreamcast story.

02:47:42.300 --> 02:47:45.620
So anyway, there you go.

02:47:45.860 --> 02:47:48.020
So some Dreamcast reflection.

02:47:48.020 --> 02:47:51.100
What was your favorite Dreamcast game when all is said and done?

02:47:51.100 --> 02:47:54.660
And last call for any Discord callers tonight over at

02:47:55.460 --> 02:47:58.300
our Discord server, vognetwork.com slash Discord.

02:48:01.060 --> 02:48:03.660
I really did like Phantasy Star online.

02:48:03.660 --> 02:48:07.660
And I liked oh, crap.

02:48:08.740 --> 02:48:11.620
Puyo Da, the music, the Puyo Puyo music game.

02:48:12.220 --> 02:48:12.900
That was really fun.

02:48:14.100 --> 02:48:15.620
Wasn't Capcom SNK 2?

02:48:15.620 --> 02:48:17.780
Yeah. Yeah. The fighting games are, of course, fantastic.

02:48:17.780 --> 02:48:18.540
I was one of my faves.

02:48:18.540 --> 02:48:20.700
But I'm like trying not to focus on the obvious.

02:48:20.700 --> 02:48:23.180
Yeah. Power Stone, I have to say.

02:48:23.180 --> 02:48:24.260
I mean, powerful.

02:48:24.260 --> 02:48:25.420
Yeah, it's obvious.

02:48:25.420 --> 02:48:27.260
But I'm sorry, I can't help it.

02:48:27.260 --> 02:48:30.900
But honestly, Phantasy Star online, like I feel like that game

02:48:30.900 --> 02:48:32.340
changed everything.

02:48:32.340 --> 02:48:33.100
It really did.

02:48:33.100 --> 02:48:37.460
Like that is when I started like loving online game experiences,

02:48:37.460 --> 02:48:40.700
MMO type things that that game is revolutionary.

02:48:40.700 --> 02:48:43.620
And I'm so excited that PSO2, even if it's supposed to be

02:48:43.620 --> 02:48:45.460
like a different thing, I'm happy that we're actually getting

02:48:45.460 --> 02:48:46.860
a release of it here in the US.

02:48:47.220 --> 02:48:48.180
It's about fucking time.

02:48:48.820 --> 02:48:50.660
Loki, what about you when it comes to the Dreamcast?

02:48:50.940 --> 02:48:52.260
Probably Power Stone as well.

02:48:52.460 --> 02:48:53.540
I really like that game.

02:48:53.780 --> 02:48:56.700
Yeah. Dark Tetsuya says, oh, man, tough call.

02:48:56.700 --> 02:48:59.620
Crazy Taxi is in my top five easily.

02:48:59.860 --> 02:49:01.500
Also had Tony Hawk Pro Skater on there.

02:49:01.500 --> 02:49:02.220
That was pretty fun.

02:49:02.220 --> 02:49:03.660
Yeah, good choices.

02:49:03.660 --> 02:49:04.140
Good choices.

02:49:04.260 --> 02:49:04.500
All right.

02:49:04.500 --> 02:49:06.100
We had a couple of people join the green room, so I'm going

02:49:06.100 --> 02:49:08.700
to get through these two calls here and then we can wrap up.

02:49:08.700 --> 02:49:09.820
But first, we'll take some calls.

02:49:10.020 --> 02:49:10.780
So hello.

02:49:10.780 --> 02:49:12.020
You are on Orange Launch Radio.

02:49:12.020 --> 02:49:12.540
Who's this?

02:49:13.540 --> 02:49:14.820
This is Shane.

02:49:14.860 --> 02:49:16.260
Hey, Shane, it's good to hear from you.

02:49:16.260 --> 02:49:16.900
What's up, buddy?

02:49:17.740 --> 02:49:24.380
Um, I wanted to say that first of all, moving is a blast and

02:49:24.380 --> 02:49:27.020
is super fun and everybody should do it.

02:49:27.500 --> 02:49:30.500
Uh, is this the introduction to the opposite sketch?

02:49:30.500 --> 02:49:32.260
Because that is such a lie.

02:49:32.260 --> 02:49:33.220
Moving is terrible.

02:49:33.820 --> 02:49:34.780
It really is.

02:49:35.420 --> 02:49:38.540
But once you, once you get it done, it's awesome.

02:49:38.980 --> 02:49:42.260
I've got my new Shane cave thing.

02:49:42.700 --> 02:49:46.380
It looks really good with the lights and it's less cluttered.

02:49:46.420 --> 02:49:47.500
Wait, send me pictures.

02:49:47.540 --> 02:49:48.100
I want proof.

02:49:48.100 --> 02:49:49.340
I want to see the Shane cave.

02:49:49.940 --> 02:49:50.260
Okay.

02:49:50.260 --> 02:49:50.620
I can.

02:49:50.620 --> 02:49:50.900
Okay.

02:49:50.900 --> 02:49:51.220
Hold on.

02:49:51.700 --> 02:49:52.020
All right.

02:49:52.020 --> 02:49:53.740
We don't have to do it right this second, but I'm just saying

02:49:53.740 --> 02:49:55.980
eventually I can do it and talk.

02:49:56.020 --> 02:49:58.900
I've only been on one ambient so far tonight.

02:49:58.900 --> 02:49:59.540
So it's okay.

02:50:00.020 --> 02:50:00.340
Oh yeah.

02:50:00.340 --> 02:50:03.660
By the way, guys, Shane tried to tank an instance in final

02:50:03.660 --> 02:50:06.260
fantasy 14 last night while he had taken two ambient, which

02:50:06.260 --> 02:50:07.260
you're not supposed to do.

02:50:07.620 --> 02:50:10.820
And like, he literally fell asleep during one of the boss encounters.

02:50:10.820 --> 02:50:14.140
And I'm like, why, why are you forcing yourself to stay awake?

02:50:14.140 --> 02:50:14.820
And I'm going to yell at you.

02:50:15.300 --> 02:50:16.380
I wasn't tanking.

02:50:16.380 --> 02:50:17.460
You were tanking.

02:50:17.740 --> 02:50:20.780
Whatever you were healing and you were like standing in bad.

02:50:20.900 --> 02:50:21.900
You fell asleep.

02:50:21.900 --> 02:50:22.580
It was terrible.

02:50:23.980 --> 02:50:27.300
So two not so appropriate for dungeons.

02:50:27.300 --> 02:50:27.740
Got it.

02:50:28.500 --> 02:50:35.540
Anyway, I'm taking a picture of this room and I just wanted

02:50:35.540 --> 02:50:40.740
to talk about now my feelings about Dreamcast because more

02:50:40.740 --> 02:50:45.180
to my story from earlier is I worked at target for that launch.

02:50:45.180 --> 02:50:48.780
Like I worked that launch, but I went over to the EB games

02:50:48.780 --> 02:50:53.420
or electronics boutique just because I knew the person there

02:50:53.420 --> 02:50:54.700
and I wanted to help them out.

02:50:54.780 --> 02:51:02.140
And it was, I don't think I had felt that like amazed at buying

02:51:02.140 --> 02:51:05.300
a console until the switch.

02:51:05.340 --> 02:51:08.780
So from the Dreamcast to the switch, that's where I was

02:51:08.780 --> 02:51:11.020
in terms of like being in awe.

02:51:11.300 --> 02:51:14.460
I forgot that you ever worked at a target for one.

02:51:14.580 --> 02:51:15.460
I mean, but that was before.

02:51:15.900 --> 02:51:17.620
That was my first job ever.

02:51:17.740 --> 02:51:18.340
So, yeah.

02:51:18.620 --> 02:51:22.420
So, so you, but you went over to EB games, even though you could have

02:51:22.420 --> 02:51:25.980
just, were you allowed to put one aside for yourself?

02:51:25.980 --> 02:51:26.540
Probably not.

02:51:26.540 --> 02:51:27.460
That's probably why you had to do that.

02:51:29.020 --> 02:51:29.740
Oh, I don't know.

02:51:29.740 --> 02:51:33.100
Because back then to me, there was no huge, okay.

02:51:33.100 --> 02:51:35.500
Cause GameStop is the thing everybody hates.

02:51:35.740 --> 02:51:36.660
These were EB games.

02:51:36.660 --> 02:51:38.420
These were like cool people.

02:51:38.620 --> 02:51:43.020
They didn't really do a lot of tracking for like pre-sales

02:51:43.020 --> 02:51:44.260
or upsell you as much.

02:51:44.260 --> 02:51:48.620
It was more like a, the way you'd want to be treated as a customer.

02:51:48.620 --> 02:51:51.020
And it was all funko land here in California.

02:51:51.420 --> 02:51:53.420
Same idea or a software, et cetera.

02:51:53.420 --> 02:51:54.180
It was the other big one.

02:51:54.180 --> 02:51:56.020
So yeah, yeah, exactly.

02:51:56.580 --> 02:52:01.700
So I didn't, I was like, I feel responsible to go over there

02:52:01.700 --> 02:52:03.700
and buy the stuff I want.

02:52:04.340 --> 02:52:07.780
But, um, anyway, I'm trying to take a good picture right now of this

02:52:07.780 --> 02:52:08.820
so I can send it to you.

02:52:09.100 --> 02:52:13.340
Cause it's, it's your, uh, it's your screen right now.

02:52:13.340 --> 02:52:15.500
So I'm backing up.

02:52:17.500 --> 02:52:17.940
Okay.

02:52:17.980 --> 02:52:21.700
So, uh, yeah, some comments in chat saying, uh, Kaijuna says, not everybody.

02:52:21.700 --> 02:52:22.620
I love GameStop.

02:52:22.940 --> 02:52:26.100
Uh, as soon as Matt says the electronic boutiques back in the day were great.

02:52:26.220 --> 02:52:27.500
We did have EB games here though.

02:52:27.500 --> 02:52:28.700
Cause they used to have one in our mall.

02:52:28.700 --> 02:52:30.980
So there's, there's, there were a couple of them, but I remember

02:52:30.980 --> 02:52:32.180
Softworks said it was a good one.

02:52:33.020 --> 02:52:39.740
Once a GameStop body EB games, that's why you wouldn't have a, have them anymore.

02:52:39.980 --> 02:52:40.380
Yeah.

02:52:40.660 --> 02:52:45.060
Uh, well for the longest time, there was a GameStop and an EB games in the

02:52:45.060 --> 02:52:46.700
mall, even after one bought the other.

02:52:46.860 --> 02:52:49.860
It was only like, God, it feels like it was only like five years ago.

02:52:49.860 --> 02:52:51.140
They finally closed that EB games.

02:52:51.140 --> 02:52:52.060
It really wasn't that long ago.

02:52:52.340 --> 02:52:55.780
A lot of folks reminiscing about Babbage's I noticed as well.

02:52:56.020 --> 02:53:00.300
So that was another one of those chains that was in the, uh, uh, the collective

02:53:00.300 --> 02:53:01.580
that GameStop ultimately bought.

02:53:01.940 --> 02:53:06.020
And I did post something on Twitter about GameStop actually

02:53:06.020 --> 02:53:07.940
going to bat for me this week.

02:53:08.220 --> 02:53:14.900
I had a funky Joy-Con situation on the new model switch and we talked it out

02:53:14.940 --> 02:53:18.380
and she opened up another box to see if it was having the same issue.

02:53:18.900 --> 02:53:21.780
And it wasn't, sorry, it wasn't just the Joy-Con, it was like the railings

02:53:21.780 --> 02:53:27.820
on the Joy-Con, um, and she swapped it out for me and it's, it made me

02:53:27.820 --> 02:53:34.300
realize that as harsh as I am on people that work at GameStop, they are

02:53:34.300 --> 02:53:40.260
people that for the most part will try to help you out and I can't,

02:53:40.340 --> 02:53:42.060
it's their corporate that sucks.

02:53:42.140 --> 02:53:43.660
And yeah, that's absolutely right.

02:53:43.860 --> 02:53:47.380
Any criticism I've ever had a GameStop is usually about their corporate and

02:53:47.380 --> 02:53:52.820
not, not usually the employee, but there are some, and this is, you know,

02:53:52.820 --> 02:53:54.060
obviously the exception is not the rule.

02:53:54.060 --> 02:53:57.700
There are some employees that use it as a power trip.

02:53:57.740 --> 02:53:59.980
Like they're the fucking gatekeeper of video games.

02:54:00.020 --> 02:54:00.660
You know what I mean?

02:54:01.140 --> 02:54:04.140
And that's always like dumb, but not everybody does that.

02:54:04.140 --> 02:54:07.100
Obviously you've had some good experiences as well with that.

02:54:09.620 --> 02:54:10.180
Yeah.

02:54:10.340 --> 02:54:13.180
And so I actually went over there and pre-ordered something.

02:54:13.460 --> 02:54:14.620
Sucks to be them though.

02:54:14.620 --> 02:54:16.380
I found it cheaper at other places.

02:54:16.380 --> 02:54:21.140
So I'm going to go cancel it, but they should have known better.

02:54:21.700 --> 02:54:22.220
Um, okay.

02:54:22.220 --> 02:54:29.220
I'm almost on my last picture for you and then I'm going to send it.

02:54:29.740 --> 02:54:30.420
That's that button.

02:54:30.620 --> 02:54:30.940
Okay.

02:54:31.220 --> 02:54:32.820
So it's coming in.

02:54:33.020 --> 02:54:34.060
It's not finished.

02:54:34.300 --> 02:54:37.020
I'm still getting another bookshelf delivered.

02:54:37.220 --> 02:54:40.900
Um, I think sometime this week that we'll put together.

02:54:47.860 --> 02:54:48.660
Oh, sorry.

02:54:48.940 --> 02:54:49.500
Do you trade?

02:54:50.900 --> 02:54:51.580
It got quiet.

02:54:51.700 --> 02:54:52.220
Yes.

02:54:52.260 --> 02:54:52.780
Sorry.

02:54:52.780 --> 02:54:55.420
Is there, did you want to share more Dreamcast memories?

02:54:56.620 --> 02:54:57.340
Oh, me?

02:54:57.740 --> 02:54:58.060
Sorry.

02:54:58.060 --> 02:55:00.180
I was like all over the place.

02:55:00.540 --> 02:55:00.940
Yeah.

02:55:00.980 --> 02:55:02.060
Um, yes.

02:55:02.100 --> 02:55:11.140
So two others, I got somebody amigo and my dog peed all over the mat.

02:55:12.100 --> 02:55:13.820
I totally forgot about somebody amigo.

02:55:13.820 --> 02:55:15.060
That was such a good game though.

02:55:15.700 --> 02:55:17.420
Yeah, it was such a good game.

02:55:20.140 --> 02:55:24.740
And then a game I got obsessed with that I don't think ever came out here.

02:55:24.740 --> 02:55:27.420
I had to be shown like a burned game of it.

02:55:27.820 --> 02:55:28.980
Cool, cool tune.

02:55:29.380 --> 02:55:30.940
That game was awesome.

02:55:31.620 --> 02:55:37.540
It has great music and I recently tried to look up some videos on it on YouTube and I

02:55:37.540 --> 02:55:39.460
didn't find nearly as many as I wanted.

02:55:39.500 --> 02:55:40.700
So, okay.

02:55:40.700 --> 02:55:44.060
So I'm just getting all the pictures of your little Shane cave and all the blue

02:55:44.060 --> 02:55:45.900
and purple and red and stuff in there.

02:55:46.220 --> 02:55:51.860
Um, it does look really nice, but like, um, I feel like that would be hard on the

02:55:51.860 --> 02:55:52.500
eyes.

02:55:52.540 --> 02:55:53.300
It's kind of dark.

02:55:53.300 --> 02:55:58.060
It's actually, no, the lighting is actually easier on my eyes.

02:55:58.380 --> 02:55:58.980
Interesting.

02:55:59.860 --> 02:56:01.220
All right.

02:56:02.580 --> 02:56:03.020
All right.

02:56:03.020 --> 02:56:06.620
Well, uh, any else, anything else you want to, uh, bring up here before I get to

02:56:06.620 --> 02:56:07.780
another call here and then wrap up?

02:56:08.820 --> 02:56:10.180
No, that's fine.

02:56:10.660 --> 02:56:11.060
All right.

02:56:11.340 --> 02:56:13.900
Well, um, good night and I'll talk to you later.

02:56:15.020 --> 02:56:15.660
Good night.

02:56:16.060 --> 02:56:16.420
All right.

02:56:16.420 --> 02:56:16.740
Bye.

02:56:17.500 --> 02:56:17.860
Bye.

02:56:18.660 --> 02:56:19.140
All right.

02:56:19.140 --> 02:56:20.460
Let's go to one more call here.

02:56:20.500 --> 02:56:22.220
And, uh, after this we'll wrap up.

02:56:22.220 --> 02:56:23.220
Hi, you're on orange on radio.

02:56:23.220 --> 02:56:23.620
Who's this?

02:56:24.340 --> 02:56:25.820
Hey, what's up everybody?

02:56:25.820 --> 02:56:26.500
It's Ronma.

02:56:26.740 --> 02:56:27.260
Hey, Ronma.

02:56:27.260 --> 02:56:27.980
It's good to hear from you.

02:56:27.980 --> 02:56:28.580
What's on your mind?

02:56:29.300 --> 02:56:30.300
Not too much.

02:56:30.340 --> 02:56:33.420
Uh, it's great to hear from you all again and welcome back from DragonCon.

02:56:33.500 --> 02:56:34.580
Um, thank you.

02:56:35.500 --> 02:56:35.980
You're welcome.

02:56:36.300 --> 02:56:37.060
A couple of things.

02:56:37.060 --> 02:56:40.100
I'm going to be about my way, cause it is getting a little late here.

02:56:40.140 --> 02:56:45.540
Um, early on when you mentioned Castlevania, I know I shared this with

02:56:45.540 --> 02:56:51.860
Jamie last week, but I came across this amazing heavy metal cover of Vampire

02:56:51.860 --> 02:56:52.180
Killer.

02:56:53.300 --> 02:56:53.780
Yes.

02:56:54.740 --> 02:56:55.460
That was really good.

02:56:56.460 --> 02:56:58.940
And I think she also has a couple of other covers as well.

02:56:58.940 --> 02:57:00.020
That is just as great.

02:57:03.780 --> 02:57:06.540
I will gladly go ahead and link that into chat.

02:57:06.540 --> 02:57:09.380
Cause I think everybody needs to hear this cause it's so good.

02:57:10.660 --> 02:57:14.500
Sadly, I can't really play it here on the show, but you can link that in the chat

02:57:14.500 --> 02:57:16.260
and uh, yeah, we'll have to, I'll check that out.

02:57:16.300 --> 02:57:17.620
I want to, I didn't hear this, so.

02:57:18.420 --> 02:57:18.820
That's good.

02:57:18.820 --> 02:57:19.100
Done.

02:57:19.900 --> 02:57:24.140
Now the second thing you're talking about DragonCon and the cosplay and

02:57:24.140 --> 02:57:27.820
the guys doing cosplay, I'm just here beaming as I'm sitting here

02:57:27.860 --> 02:57:30.060
editing convention photos.

02:57:31.420 --> 02:57:35.460
Let me tell you, when you were talking about dudes, just revealing,

02:57:35.900 --> 02:57:37.660
there was one convention I went to.

02:57:38.620 --> 02:57:41.820
They had a Virgin Killer photo shoot meetup.

02:57:42.140 --> 02:57:46.620
Basically it was most, I missed this, but it was in this video of it.

02:57:46.620 --> 02:57:50.820
There was a bunch of guys wearing Virgin Killer sweaters for, for the photo shoot.

02:57:50.820 --> 02:57:53.340
And it was like one of the best things I've ever seen in my entire life.

02:57:54.260 --> 02:57:55.660
The sweaters are ugly.

02:57:57.860 --> 02:58:04.140
It kind of is, but you know, I mean, I have seen people match them with certain

02:58:04.140 --> 02:58:09.100
outfits and looks pretty well, you know, but you just have to have

02:58:09.100 --> 02:58:10.540
a really nice back for that.

02:58:11.300 --> 02:58:12.460
Well, that too.

02:58:13.180 --> 02:58:16.740
And as long as the back is shaven too, you know what I'm saying?

02:58:16.940 --> 02:58:18.020
There is that, yes.

02:58:18.860 --> 02:58:19.380
I don't know.

02:58:19.380 --> 02:58:21.700
I know a few bears that might be into that look.

02:58:22.580 --> 02:58:23.660
Oh, so do I.

02:58:23.780 --> 02:58:24.620
So do I.

02:58:26.700 --> 02:58:30.220
But yeah, um, do you notice like the trend I was mentioning about like

02:58:30.220 --> 02:58:33.300
DragonCon and you know, all these guys, is this something you're noticing too?

02:58:33.300 --> 02:58:37.660
Is that you see a lot more like, like, uh, dudes that are getting more and more

02:58:37.660 --> 02:58:38.740
comfortable with what they're wearing?

02:58:39.660 --> 02:58:40.700
Absolutely.

02:58:40.740 --> 02:58:42.940
I mean, not for nothing.

02:58:42.940 --> 02:58:47.340
Like for one, the cosplays that I do is Human Artemis from Sailor Moon.

02:58:48.180 --> 02:58:53.300
Part of his outfit, part of his stomach is showing and I got that, you know,

02:58:53.300 --> 02:58:57.620
Buddha belly, so I'm like, I don't like to show it, but lately it's like,

02:58:57.620 --> 02:59:01.100
when I do the costume, I'm like, you know what, F it, I'll just, I'll

02:59:01.100 --> 02:59:04.980
just go as is and it, and it's, and it goes over pretty well.

02:59:05.340 --> 02:59:08.100
It's like, it's just the confidence of people.

02:59:08.100 --> 02:59:10.140
It's just going over.

02:59:10.140 --> 02:59:14.020
It's like if that person A can do it, person B can do it.

02:59:14.100 --> 02:59:15.380
Let's just roll with it.

02:59:15.380 --> 02:59:18.180
You know, cause I will say this.

02:59:18.260 --> 02:59:24.660
I went to BronyCon last month and I will say, I have all the conventions I've gone

02:59:24.660 --> 02:59:31.420
to, I have never seen so many people comfortable in their cosplays, their

02:59:31.420 --> 02:59:34.860
original concept, cosplay designs, everything.

02:59:34.940 --> 02:59:39.140
It was just people, people were just absolutely happy being who they were.

02:59:39.420 --> 02:59:42.900
I have not felt something like this in a very long time.

02:59:43.820 --> 02:59:47.140
I will say there is something very empowering about the whole like, fuck it

02:59:47.140 --> 02:59:48.420
mentality, you know what I mean?

02:59:49.060 --> 02:59:49.460
Mm-hmm.

02:59:50.580 --> 02:59:53.580
So, and I'm, I'm all for it.

02:59:53.580 --> 02:59:58.100
And I'm just like, and I understand that there are some cosplays that are a little

02:59:58.100 --> 03:00:02.460
bit too revealing, which I totally get, but you can always like do slight

03:00:02.460 --> 03:00:06.380
adjustments to it for your body type.

03:00:06.380 --> 03:00:08.820
So you can still rock it however you want.

03:00:08.820 --> 03:00:12.340
And if you want to do it just the way it is, then you do you.

03:00:13.820 --> 03:00:14.780
Very true.

03:00:14.900 --> 03:00:16.180
Very good message.

03:00:16.180 --> 03:00:17.580
And I think we'll leave it on that.

03:00:17.660 --> 03:00:20.220
Uh, but more to come on this week's anime jam session, right?

03:00:20.860 --> 03:00:24.380
Yeah, we have a lot to catch up on because we didn't have a show last week.

03:00:24.940 --> 03:00:25.500
Yeah, yeah.

03:00:25.500 --> 03:00:28.220
I know you guys like had a flight issue or something, right?

03:00:28.220 --> 03:00:30.900
Cause I got delayed, but you got like super delayed cause you got

03:00:30.900 --> 03:00:31.940
canceled or something, right?

03:00:32.500 --> 03:00:37.060
Yes, I got canceled and I was up at four o'clock in the morning to

03:00:37.060 --> 03:00:41.140
catch a flight to Philly, then catch a train to New York so I could be to work.

03:00:42.140 --> 03:00:42.780
Yikes.

03:00:42.780 --> 03:00:45.580
All right, well, yeah, Mr.

03:00:45.580 --> 03:00:47.020
Smoosh is distracting the show.

03:00:47.020 --> 03:00:47.580
What else is new?

03:00:47.780 --> 03:00:50.780
Anyway, Rama, I'm going to say good night so we can wrap up, but

03:00:50.780 --> 03:00:51.740
thank you so much for your call.

03:00:52.300 --> 03:00:52.780
No problem.

03:00:52.780 --> 03:00:54.380
Good night and good luck.

03:00:54.620 --> 03:00:54.940
All right.

03:00:54.940 --> 03:00:55.420
Take care, buddy.

03:00:57.100 --> 03:00:57.660
All right.

03:00:57.660 --> 03:01:01.180
Well, I think with that, we're going to wrap up for the night ourselves here.

03:01:01.220 --> 03:01:03.260
Cause, uh, we've been, we've been running a long time.

03:01:03.260 --> 03:01:06.780
It's over a three hour show tonight, but not that that's a bad thing whatsoever.

03:01:06.780 --> 03:01:09.420
We had a lot to say after we've been gone for a little bit, but it is that

03:01:09.420 --> 03:01:12.940
time for us to wrap up the show and get everybody's final thoughts so we

03:01:12.940 --> 03:01:14.220
can get on out of here for the night.

03:01:14.620 --> 03:01:17.900
Um, but we'll be back in seven days to talk about the latest in gaming.

03:01:17.900 --> 03:01:20.780
We know Tokyo game show is fast approaching, so that's going to be a thing.

03:01:21.260 --> 03:01:22.620
No, he's probably whining about that.

03:01:22.620 --> 03:01:23.100
Sorry.

03:01:23.100 --> 03:01:27.420
Um, and, uh, we, uh, also know we're going to have the news on

03:01:27.420 --> 03:01:29.900
Nintendo's fitness thing to talk about next Sunday.

03:01:29.900 --> 03:01:31.180
So it's going to be a very busy show.

03:01:31.180 --> 03:01:35.180
And so we hope you'll be here live at Twitch TV to experience it, or at

03:01:35.180 --> 03:01:36.700
least check it out on our podcast feed.

03:01:36.700 --> 03:01:40.060
Uh, which is available, of course, on iTunes and Google play.

03:01:40.060 --> 03:01:43.340
And most of the places where podcasts are available, just not Spotify yet,

03:01:43.340 --> 03:01:44.460
but that's something I'm working on.

03:01:44.460 --> 03:01:47.500
So by the end of the year, it's one of those things on the list in the next few

03:01:47.500 --> 03:01:47.980
weeks.

03:01:47.980 --> 03:01:52.460
Um, but anyway, uh, before we wrap up, I'll also say, if you enjoyed what you

03:01:52.460 --> 03:01:56.140
heard here at Orange, Ontario, please leave us a nice five star review.

03:01:56.140 --> 03:02:01.660
Um, those go an awful long way in, um, helping the show, uh, get promoted and

03:02:01.660 --> 03:02:02.540
exposed and all that.

03:02:03.100 --> 03:02:06.060
Uh, hosts on Twitter, uh, are going to be here.

03:02:06.140 --> 03:02:08.860
On Twitch go a really long way as well.

03:02:08.860 --> 03:02:11.820
Please consider adding VOG network to your auto host list.

03:02:11.820 --> 03:02:15.660
Those are all super, super helpful, um, and really help with the exposure.

03:02:15.660 --> 03:02:19.740
So thank you everybody, uh, who does support the show, be it, uh, here live at

03:02:19.740 --> 03:02:21.100
Twitch or via the podcast.

03:02:21.100 --> 03:02:24.780
We appreciate all of you guys, uh, how, however you consume the show.

03:02:24.780 --> 03:02:27.500
Anyway, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts tonight.

03:02:27.500 --> 03:02:29.900
So, um, I'll start cause usually I end up last.

03:02:29.900 --> 03:02:34.540
So my final thought is, um, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go move this blanket onto the

03:02:34.540 --> 03:02:36.700
bed now and make Alan sleep with this blanket.

03:02:36.700 --> 03:02:39.580
I think that would be fun, especially when I'm going to be gone with

03:02:39.580 --> 03:02:40.940
orientation for my new job.

03:02:40.940 --> 03:02:44.780
He could sleep with a blanket and it'll be like I never left.

03:02:44.780 --> 03:02:47.500
So anyway, uh, Loki, your final thought.

03:02:47.500 --> 03:02:50.300
My final thought is I'm going to keep working on my game.

03:02:51.180 --> 03:02:51.680
Good.

03:02:52.300 --> 03:02:54.460
And last but not least, Star Soccer, your final thought.

03:02:55.020 --> 03:02:58.700
Uh, did you know that text from superheroes is still an active website?

03:02:59.740 --> 03:03:00.140
No, I didn't.

03:03:00.140 --> 03:03:00.940
And it's still funny.

03:03:01.580 --> 03:03:01.900
Okay.

03:03:01.900 --> 03:03:02.780
I'll take your word for it.

03:03:03.660 --> 03:03:04.160
Okay.

03:03:05.660 --> 03:03:07.980
Well with that, we're going to wrap up the show.

03:03:07.980 --> 03:03:11.900
Thank you everybody for being here and we will see you again in seven days.

03:03:11.900 --> 03:03:13.180
