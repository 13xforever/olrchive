00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,960
This week it's been enough generations that everything old is new again.

2
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,360
Katamari Damacy Encore was just the first of Bandai Namco's offerings with many more

3
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,120
to come, at least in Japan.

4
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,900
This is just one revival in tonight's news, stay tuned for the rest, starting right now

5
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,000
on the show where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,880
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

7
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,600
where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,600
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 793, whoops at that title,

9
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,560
for September the 22nd of 2019.

10
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,900
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm going to fix away at this title here that's incorrect on

11
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:58,260
our Twitch TV stream, because we do tape live, errors and all, every Sunday night at

12
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,380
the Voice of Geeks Network, Twitch TV slash VOG Network.

13
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:06,020
And while I'm fixing away that title, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

14
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,020
Hello.

15
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,020
How are you, Loki?

16
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:09,020
I'm fine.

17
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:10,020
Good.

18
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,040
Me too, except for the little broken chat there, or sorry, the broken title and then

19
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,040
my broken chat over here as well.

20
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,920
So Twitch started doing this thing where you can do community gifting, which is really

21
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,920
cool.

22
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,300
It's like, if you're a Twitch Prime person, you can throw items into this chest and people

23
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:30,180
are doing that right now in our chat room and at some point later during the show, around

24
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,380
the time we take a break, what we'll do is we're going to open the chest and all the

25
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,840
non Twitch Prime people, it'll give it away at random.

26
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,660
So because Twitch Prime people already have it, so it's like you're putting your extra

27
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,660
copies or whatever.

28
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,660
I don't know.

29
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:42,660
It gives you three codes to get away.

30
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,580
You put it in this treasure chest and then we get to dole out all that loot to all the

31
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,820
non Twitch Prime subscribers in chat.

32
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,820
So it's fun.

33
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,960
The problem is it kind of breaks the chat room on my side because it keeps hounding

34
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,680
me like, donate more, put more in the chest.

35
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,680
I'm like, okay.

36
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,680
Do it.

37
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,280
And it's, I'm happy to do that, but it's just like, Oh my God.

38
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,920
Then it like breaks the little chat sidebar.

39
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,300
So now I have to reopen it, but whatever.

40
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,300
I'll deal with it.

41
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,360
I will get around to your chat comments here very soon.

42
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,760
As soon as I can actually read it.

43
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,400
In the meantime, how was your week, Loki?

44
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,760
How have you been?

45
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,760
It's been okay.

46
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,580
I didn't do a whole lot this week.

47
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,820
I did play some more laser tag though.

48
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:27,420
We went yesterday and I'm just kind of like, I was going to take the kids out cause my

49
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,340
wife is going out with some friends to eat.

50
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:34,580
And so I took the kids out to go eat and then we had like, it was around seven o'clock.

51
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:39,560
We can squeeze in a game of laser tag before they have to go to bed, I guess.

52
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,500
So we squeezed in a game of laser tag and it was just the three of us.

53
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:49,500
And then like, as we were leaving, then there's like, Oh, all these other people want to play

54
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,360
and it's like, okay, let's play with them.

55
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:58,980
And then it was just like a ton of people and we just just destroyed them.

56
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,400
Like it was just, well, there's actually people going there now.

57
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,400
You said a ton of people.

58
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,600
Well, yeah, it ended up working out.

59
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,120
I think it was just a fluke, but like, yeah, there's like at least like 15, 20 people in

60
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,220
the game and I, we just destroyed them.

61
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:17,880
And when I say we, I mean myself and my kids, cause my kids are actually doing all right.

62
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,560
Like they know how to like tag people and stuff.

63
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,720
And my one youngest son likes flanking people.

64
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,440
Some dads will go out there and throw the baseball with their kids.

65
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,480
You teach people, you teach your kids how to annihilate others at laser tag.

66
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,480
Yes.

67
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,480
Fun.

68
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,480
Yes.

69
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,480
I like that.

70
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,200
Anyhow, since I was, I was distracted by broken title and distracted by broken chat room,

71
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,400
I forgot to address, hello, where's dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

72
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,160
She's not here tonight.

73
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,200
She's a little under the weather.

74
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,100
She's she's got a voice thing going on.

75
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:49,780
So because she has to talk for her job, she felt it would be best to take the night off

76
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,780
and rest her voice.

77
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,940
And we can certainly understand that work is very important.

78
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,080
So work is work is the most important thing.

79
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,300
In fact, I just found out, well, I mean, it's a good thing.

80
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,740
I'm going to be traveling for work and I love to do the travel thing, but we're not going

81
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,420
to have a show towards the end of October because of it.

82
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:10,020
So work comes first sometimes y'all and that's where a dark soccer is taken care of herself.

83
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,020
So she can be ready for work.

84
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,160
So she's not here tonight.

85
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,020
She may pop into chat though.

86
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,020
I see slag kick.

87
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,020
Hello.

88
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,640
Isn't our chat room saying heart for dark soccer.

89
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,300
If she's here in chat, she has been known to pop into the chat room sometimes when she's

90
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,660
not here, but she also may be using this time to catch up on errands.

91
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,780
I don't know, but for whatever reason, she's not, or I'm sorry.

92
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:32,300
We know the reason, but whether she's here in chat or I'm not, God, now I've got, look

93
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,300
at this, look at this.

94
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,100
Now my phone's popping up telemarketer or you can't see that on the thing.

95
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,640
Telemarketer is calling me my God.

96
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,100
Can anything.

97
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,840
That's the worst name for a company.

98
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,840
I know, right?

99
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,120
No, it actually, did you know that the phones show that to you now it'll say like telemarketer

100
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,520
or potential spam or yeah, it'll actually show you when, uh, it's, it's suspects.

101
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,280
It's kind of a bullshit call or something going on.

102
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,800
So yeah, anyway, let's talk about video games.

103
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,840
My God, get this show on track people.

104
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,760
It's been a great week for games.

105
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,520
We've had a lot of big games that came out this week, namely, uh, links awakening on

106
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,520
the switch.

107
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,740
A lot of people are playing that game and having a blast with that game.

108
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,100
Um, I, I actually was playing that game quite a bit.

109
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,860
I'll talk a little more about it in my gaming week.

110
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,300
Have you, have you checked out links awakening?

111
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,220
I just picked it up, but I haven't played it yet.

112
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,940
My kids had played it or my son's played it, but he doesn't understand what to do in that.

113
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:26,700
So his game right now is I'm collecting rupees.

114
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,980
That's all I'm doing is collecting rupees.

115
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:28,980
Not a bad thing.

116
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:29,980
Having money is good.

117
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,980
It'll lie to buy.

118
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:31,980
That's all he's doing.

119
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,060
He's like, I'm like, well, you can have your brother help you with reading and stuff.

120
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,700
He's like, well, I don't do the readings.

121
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,920
So I'm just going to cut the, that's me playing games too.

122
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,560
I don't read.

123
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,120
So I'm like, okay, well that's cool.

124
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,800
You know, you can do whatever you want in the game.

125
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,800
That's fine.

126
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,960
I'm like, why don't you play the untitled goose game instead?

127
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,600
So um, another big game that came out this week.

128
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,960
So I picked that up and I think they were playing that too.

129
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,960
And he had fun.

130
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,920
I'm trying to create a picnic cause I know that's one of the, uh, goals you have to do

131
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,920
in the game.

132
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,920
All right.

133
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,480
Well, I won't get too ahead of ourselves and get into our gaming weeks.

134
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,340
Let's get into our kickoff topic though, uh, which is a pretty big, uh, international

135
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,340
story, I suppose.

136
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,780
But this is one of those things that you kind of wonder how could this trickle down and

137
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,720
affect other places.

138
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,720
So Loki.

139
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,720
Yeah.

140
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:22,060
So apparently valve in 2015 was sued by an organization in France called, uh, UFC, Q,

141
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:27,180
uh, I can't even pronounce what it was, but, uh, French legal words.

142
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,180
Yes.

143
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,700
So it's, um, some organization there.

144
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:38,640
And basically, uh, they were saying that, uh, out of this, the ruling stated that, well,

145
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,640
basically this backup.

146
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:45,720
So valve was saying that they were basically selling like a service for these games.

147
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:52,320
It was like a subscription to them versus, um, you know, actually owning copies of the

148
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,320
games.

149
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:59,800
Well, apparently the court decided that, no, they're not selling a subscription service.

150
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:05,380
That's not compelling argument and users should be allowed to resell games.

151
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,740
Um, so that is what's happening there.

152
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:15,180
So apparently now in France, valve has to allow users to resell their games.

153
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,620
Now this, you know, the, the resale of digital games, I think is something that, you know,

154
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,020
a lot of us now, obviously, again, this is happening in France.

155
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:27,020
This is a French court decision and you know, just because it happened there doesn't mean

156
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:32,280
it's something that's going to happen in the US or Canada or Mexico or Japan or wherever

157
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,660
our listeners are that happened to be listening to this show.

158
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:39,920
But sometimes where one place goes, other places tend to follow.

159
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,080
And I think, you know, many of us that have been playing digital games, I mean, how many

160
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,120
of y'all out there buy digital games?

161
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,800
And I'm sure many hands in the room just went up, right?

162
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:53,100
And many of you are buying digital games probably for that convenience, digital games, uh, sometimes

163
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:57,000
because these games go on like deep discount sales and they're pretty hard to resist, right?

164
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,880
Like the, uh, humble bundles, right?

165
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,880
That's all digital sales.

166
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,880
Right.

167
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:05,120
So, um, you know, y'all have probably bought a digital game or two in your day or hell

168
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:11,720
if you've ever gotten one of the free games on Epic store, Epic game store, right, then

169
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,160
that is a digital transaction, even though it's like free or whatever, uh, PlayStation

170
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:21,020
plus X-Box games of gold and all this you're getting, you're participating in the digital

171
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:24,920
distribution of games, which as we know is getting bigger and bigger in our industry.

172
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,060
It's getting so big in this industry.

173
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:31,360
We just had a story on last week's show about the GameStop struggling because the industry

174
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,360
has changed.

175
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,120
GameStop's having to compete with the local GameStop here and they've actually remodeled

176
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,120
quite a bit.

177
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,480
Um, you see a lot of that pot, they have a whole section that, well, they've always had

178
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,000
a section for pop figs, but now it's more prominent by the door.

179
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,160
Um, and this doesn't necessarily mean that things are going to change because they still

180
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,520
have an appeal.

181
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:56,640
Um, also the judge ruled that, um, they have to comply within a month's time.

182
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:02,160
If they don't, then they'll have to pay a fine of 3000 euros per day, up to six months.

183
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,480
They may just take the fine.

184
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,260
If you think about it, wow.

185
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:10,320
So they could probably, if they feel that they're going to lose more money after all,

186
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,800
they could just, there's going to be a meeting at valve headquarters up there in Washington

187
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,800
on Monday.

188
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,160
There's going to be a big meet and Gabe Newell's going to be in that meeting because something's

189
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,440
going to have to happen here.

190
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,440
You're right.

191
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,440
Either.

192
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,440
They're just going to suck it up and take the fine.

193
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,320
Uh, do you, do you think there's a possibility steam pulls out of France?

194
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,120
Steam says, you know what, fuck it.

195
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,120
I'm out.

196
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,120
They could.

197
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,400
I mean, if the, if the amount of money that they're making from that territory isn't worth

198
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:41,800
it, then they could just easily block people in France from using the service.

199
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,800
Wow.

200
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,960
So, and, and so we may see that's interesting because if steam does pull out of France and

201
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,720
I know this is a very like pie in the sky type of thing, I imagine there will be appeals

202
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,360
and all that stuff, but I don't, I don't know if the French courts work like the courts

203
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,760
here because I think, Oh, when a judgment comes out in America, it'll be tied up in

204
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,720
appeals courts for years to come.

205
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,200
But this is a very like defined, you start this in 30 days or you're getting paid, you're

206
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,360
going to be paying a fine.

207
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,840
That seems pretty definitive as opposed to what I might hear if this were coming out

208
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,920
at an, uh, out of an American court.

209
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,920
Right?

210
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,920
Yeah.

211
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,920
Yeah.

212
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,920
Our court system is notorious for being slow as hell.

213
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,920
Right.

214
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,880
Anyway.

215
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,880
Yeah.

216
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,880
I mean, it's, it's possible that they just pull out of France altogether or, you know,

217
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,240
maybe they'll move forward with it.

218
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,240
Who knows?

219
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,520
But it was, Oh, I was going to say, we might get to see you.

220
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,720
You remember how Gabe has this big red button on his desk.

221
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,720
Okay.

222
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,240
I'm kind of making this up, but in theory, he has a big red button on his desk.

223
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,960
And if steam ever goes down or is like closed and shuts down, that button gets pushed and

224
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,120
what happens?

225
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:48,420
That means the DRM it's gone and you will get access to your games without needing steam.

226
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:54,120
We may, we may be 30 days from seeing that button get pushed in France.

227
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,700
I doubt that, but it's interesting to see them argue the game licenses because you know,

228
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,840
with most software nowadays, you don't own the software.

229
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:07,360
You're just licensing, licensing, licensing it from the company.

230
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,040
And so that's why they're saying, Oh, resale's not really allowed there because it's a digital

231
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,040
license.

232
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:18,400
But the argument that they made there with the court was that word, just digital subscription

233
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:25,120
service, meaning that think of it like Netflix, where I pay $10 a month and I get access to

234
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,120
all these titles.

235
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,760
Whereas this is more like paying money and getting access to the title.

236
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,160
That's why I didn't end up flying.

237
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,720
You might be able to say that if your PlayStation network or Xbox games with gold or even game

238
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,040
pass, I think something like that might be fine.

239
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,320
I think if it was one of them on trial, they could probably get away with that, but valve,

240
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,320
not so much, which by the way, would be the exact same setup as Google stadia.

241
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,320
Right?

242
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,680
I mean, I realized there's a difference here because steam is a store.

243
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,680
Google is going to be streaming.

244
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,040
It's, it's like a way to play the game, but Google will be selling you.

245
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:03,300
It's not, and Google has even said on the record, this is not the Netflix model, right?

246
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,760
So what happens here could affect Google stadia.

247
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,680
Google's probably watching what's happening in France.

248
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,360
Google's I still don't know how Google stadia is going to work.

249
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,640
Hey, you pay us $10 a month for like 4k or whatever it is.

250
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,640
And you get nothing with that.

251
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,640
All right.

252
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,760
I'm going to turn this car around before it turns into a Google thing.

253
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,880
Cause this really is about the valve and this, this whole thing going on.

254
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:30,080
So you know what, okay, let me, let me say this too, because I bet a lot of the listeners

255
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:34,720
and a lot of, you know, and even there's that part of me that goes, well, Hey, it's about

256
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,720
time.

257
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,080
The other thing that's been a limitation to me buying games digitally is that they have

258
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,400
no equity, right?

259
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:45,400
They have no, no value once you have them in your library, because you cannot turn around

260
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,640
and resell them.

261
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,000
Whereas I'm sure many of you grew up in an era where when you were done with your Nintendo

262
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,880
game or your super Nintendo game or your PlayStation PS two game, depending on how old you are,

263
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,240
you could take that game, sell it to somebody else.

264
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:04,800
I remember going onto a BBS and selling my NES cartridges to another person.

265
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,320
And obviously this is the whole thing behind GameStop, right?

266
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,800
The sale of used games.

267
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,800
Well, now if what happens in France, you know, is goes through and really happens, then you're

268
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,440
going to have all these digital games that have equity.

269
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,220
And I think most people are probably cheering or celebrating that because it's yay, my games

270
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,220
have value.

271
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:28,880
Well, the problem is, so it doesn't really hurt the platform holder too much because

272
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,680
yeah, I'm sure that they would be totally fine with selling used games.

273
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:40,240
Let's just say we go the model with the Steam items that they have, whether it be Counter

274
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,320
Strike stuff or it could be, you know, card packs or whatever.

275
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,360
They take a portion of that profit every time there's a sale.

276
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,520
And you could say, oh, well, we could give some of that to the developer as well.

277
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:57,160
But in the end, it ends up hurting the developer because, you know, I could buy this indie

278
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:02,200
game for $14.99 or I could pay whatever the use price is for it.

279
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,320
Well, Counterpoint, haven't we gone down this road before when the used game market first

280
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,600
started to show itself or held the video game rental market?

281
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,540
Didn't Nintendo hate that shit?

282
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,640
Like isn't that why there was a code with StarTropics?

283
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:20,160
Like Nintendo actually designed a game where you could not get past the halfway point or

284
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,720
wherever it was, two thirds point.

285
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,880
You could not get past that point without a secret letter that you dip in water.

286
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,400
Now, look, we all know that code is everywhere now.

287
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,080
It's 747, right?

288
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,340
You should know that code by now.

289
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:36,140
But the reality is Nintendo did that to try to fight the rental market and some of that

290
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,140
stuff.

291
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:40,380
I mean, it wasn't the most brilliant plan in the world, but they did take a page out

292
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,100
of Computer Gaming's book, right?

293
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:49,020
Remember when this software is copy protected, turn to page 34 in the manual and match the

294
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,540
design with, right?

295
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:55,860
That was all the combat used gaming and rental gaming and all that shit, right?

296
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:01,700
So one could argue we've been down this road before, the industry sided with the gamer

297
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,780
and having equity in the game, we weren't ruined.

298
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,260
So what makes this different now?

299
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:12,060
Well, it's because indie game, I think it's because the indie game development, you have

300
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:17,180
a lot of, there's like hundreds of developers out there just putting out these products,

301
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:20,260
making barely any money off of the software.

302
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,740
And now you're saying, oh boy, you're gonna make even less off of it now.

303
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:27,120
So it's kind of about like the indie game specifically, because now we live in an era,

304
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,840
you know, when we were talking to Star Tropics, NES cartridge era, every game was 50 bucks.

305
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,980
You know, maybe 40, maybe if you found a sale, it would be a little cheaper.

306
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:36,980
Every game was expensive.

307
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,920
And I get it, like there's the same amount of copies out there still.

308
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:45,420
So like, if you're, I remember the use game argument was, well, you know, back when they

309
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:49,340
were selling the online pass, you know, oh, well, if you buy a used copy of the buy an

310
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:53,660
online pass because we have to keep our servers running and shit like that, which didn't make

311
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:58,340
any sense because they already made that money the first time when they sold it originally.

312
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,800
But now this is a digital copy.

313
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,700
And I guess you could make the same argument for that.

314
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,580
But a lot of these indie studios, I don't think are necessarily charging like they don't

315
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:11,220
have that same model where they're charging you for an online pass or something like that.

316
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,500
So it would end up hurting these studios a lot more because they're making less money

317
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,500
off of it.

318
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,500
And plus, you know, that's a problem already with like keys getting leaked out there and

319
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,100
being sold by like G2A and stuff like that.

320
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,540
What's this going to happen?

321
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:28,180
You know, we get like key farmers coming in, buying shit like really cheap and then selling

322
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:32,680
stuff really cheap, you know, tanking the market on something.

323
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:37,060
Or you could even like, you know, play it like, I don't know if you'd be able to purchase

324
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:41,900
multiple copies of stuff, but like, you know, you take the market with one thing and you

325
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,700
purchase all those copies up and then wait for the value to go back out.

326
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:49,040
And I don't know, it's just, I want to open this up to chat and your guys's thoughts.

327
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,320
Do you guys think that digital resale of games, which we're about 30 days away from likely

328
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,000
seeing in France, do you think this is a good thing for the industry or a bad thing from

329
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
the industry?

330
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,920
And, you know, let's respect all the voices out there because I know this is probably

331
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,560
a contentious topic because we're talking about money.

332
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,320
But I think in many ways, this is uncharted territory.

333
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,720
So we don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing yet.

334
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,720
I mean, yeah.

335
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,960
I mean, there's that part of me that instinctively goes, oh, yay, that's free money for me.

336
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,560
So I think, oh, it's a good thing.

337
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,560
But then I definitely kind of pull back and I think, ah, shit, like things like Humble

338
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:27,360
Bundle probably wouldn't exist if those games held some sort of value in them.

339
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:32,380
But of course, you know, I don't know, like how much value do certain games really have?

340
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:36,680
I know that sounds like a really shitty thing to say, but I think the reality is too, is

341
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:41,360
that, okay, like, look, like here, the local chain Dimple Records just finally went under,

342
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,360
right?

343
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,460
I think they had like their last sale last week and Dimple Records was this local place

344
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:51,340
here in Sacramento where our show is based, where you could buy like DVDs and CDs and

345
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,340
things like that.

346
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,340
Vinyl, yeah.

347
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:58,400
Well, if you went in this last week to go look at the Slim Pickens, you got to go see

348
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:05,380
like those 25 cent DVDs where it's like Jillian from The Biggest Loser's Workout Tape number

349
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,940
12 on, you know, like it's the, it's that, right?

350
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:14,140
You know, and I think the reality is there are some games out there and I know this sounds

351
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,900
terrible, but there are some games out there that are the Jillian Michaels Workout Tape

352
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:24,420
number 12 of the gaming industry because, and I think some of them have done it to themselves.

353
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:28,220
Like I would say one of those games, ooh, now I'm going to get real nasty already.

354
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,220
I'm going to name names.

355
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,260
I'm gonna say one of those games is Fez.

356
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:34,340
Why do I, why do I say Fez is one of those games?

357
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:37,520
Because it's, I have like eight copies of it from all the Humble Bundles.

358
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:45,260
Because every time there's some giveaway on some platform, Fez has been there, right?

359
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:51,740
So I kind of think in that regard, like, well, how much is a copy of Fez really worth?

360
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:55,960
And I know that is a shitty thing to say, because Fez, your opinions on indie game,

361
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:01,540
the movie aside, Fez is a good game, you know, it should be, but like, it's so saturated

362
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,540
at this point.

363
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,640
It's like, who fucking doesn't have Fez at this point?

364
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,980
Like you've made a conscious decision, you don't want to play that game if you haven't

365
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,120
played it at this point.

366
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,300
I haven't played it yet.

367
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:16,420
It's not that I don't want to, it's just, it's, it's in the backlog of all the other

368
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,420
games.

369
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,420
All right.

370
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,880
Let's get into some of the comments in chat.

371
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,620
So Bobby talking about the online pass thing, saying a system administrators don't work

372
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,620
for free.

373
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:28,260
The idea was that the $60 price paid for the game developers who made the game and the

374
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:32,240
online pass paid for the separate people who were the system administrators who maintain

375
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,240
the game.

376
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,760
It made perfect sense.

377
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,880
It just wasn't a popular model.

378
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,160
Well, one could, I already know what Bobby's comment to that is going to be because it

379
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,240
would depend on who is hosting those servers.

380
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,360
Whereas on PC, there isn't exactly a front end to that.

381
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,720
I'm going to just, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

382
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,720
Let's not do that.

383
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,240
What about all the billions of dollars they're making for microtransactions?

384
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,120
Can't that pay for servers, but they need the extra $5 on top of all of that.

385
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,120
To be fair.

386
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,120
That is the point I was going to make.

387
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,840
I was just going to say it a little differently.

388
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,560
It wasn't snarky enough.

389
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,840
All right.

390
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,400
Uh, let's see.

391
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,080
Bobby does also say AAA games should actually cost way more than $60 because of inflation

392
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,920
of both the worth and the size of development teams.

393
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,620
Well, honestly, I'm actually going to say, I agree.

394
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:19,700
And I've been saying that for a while here on this show is that instead of doing these

395
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:24,160
online pass, nickel diming, loot boxes, just fucking suck it up and charge 70 bucks for

396
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,160
the game already.

397
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,840
Just, you know, I know that's not going to be popular.

398
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,840
Yes.

399
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,320
People are going to bellyache about it, but you know what?

400
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,320
Just fucking charge it.

401
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,320
They already do.

402
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,880
They plan out the DLC.

403
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:38,220
That's why they have this whole, you know, season pass crap that you're buying.

404
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:43,400
They split it off purposefully so that they do charge you more money because splitting

405
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:48,760
it up saying, Oh, well you're paying $60 here and then you pay for an online pass.

406
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,520
People can say, Oh, well it feels like it's an option, you know, but a lot of that content

407
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:57,280
that was in there originally in a lot of these games, they're purposely taking out and putting

408
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,960
in like online pass stuff or not online pass in the season passes.

409
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,040
They're at, they're taking the content out of the original game and piece mailing it

410
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,040
to you.

411
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,040
All right.

412
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,560
Getting into some of the comments about what do you think about this change or, you know,

413
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,600
I keep saying it's a change, but I guess still it's a potential change because you still

414
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,320
don't know how the chess pieces are going to move.

415
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:21,460
We don't know if steam's going to react that, but, uh, your reactions in chat fifth dream

416
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:26,080
today says, I think I can't wrap my head around it because a copy of a digital code is just

417
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,080
that.

418
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,480
Which costs a fraction of a set to transmit.

419
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,480
I agree.

420
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,800
The original sale has value to pay for labor to create it, but after that, I don't know.

421
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,480
She hold 10 says physical should cost more than digital.

422
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,040
Other than that, anything goes as far as reselling what you own.

423
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,400
Is that interesting though?

424
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,960
Like things are coming full circle in a way and that we have this whole limited run games

425
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:48,960
thing, right?

426
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,960
Yeah.

427
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,400
Limited run games is taking a lot of these digital games and creating these light collectibles,

428
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,200
collector's editions, and like really enhanced, cool things that sell out within seconds.

429
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,340
And they do cost a little bit of money, but I think some people like, that's really cool.

430
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,380
That's all the GameStop is nowadays is collectible things.

431
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,060
That's what they have in their story.

432
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,520
It's it's collectibles.

433
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:15,480
I mean, they have their games, they sell the used games, but it's mostly collectibles is

434
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:21,600
like a third, if not half of the store Questbuster in chat with another comment here saying everything's

435
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,520
going to games as a service now.

436
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,360
And one of the reasons is to keep devs employed instead of losing heads at the end of every

437
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,580
project, but also to keep players engaged.

438
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,840
Not everyone does games as a service well though.

439
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,960
Oh, what a good point because look at what's happening with Anthem right now.

440
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,960
Yikes.

441
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,120
Versus what's happening with Blizzard and Overwatch still going strong years after the

442
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,480
release of the game, right?

443
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,360
Now they've got the Switch version coming out, which, you know, people are going crazy

444
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,360
about as well.

445
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,640
So it just kind of depends on, I think the company in a big way and the game that they're

446
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,500
doing for sure.

447
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,800
Also I want to point out, cause I thought this was really funny, Slag Kick actually

448
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:02,820
linked us to a copy of, from the year 2009, Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum, which

449
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:07,740
was a game on the Nintendo Wii, and saying Jillian Michaels Fitness Ultimatum is the

450
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:12,380
Jillian Michaels volume 12 of video games.

451
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:17,140
If we did name episodes of OLR, I feel like the title of tonight's show would be in there

452
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,140
somewhere.

453
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,140
It would be Fitness Ultimatum.

454
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:25,140
Michael Pacas in chat says, I forgot Anthem existed.

455
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:31,220
The power that that has, the influence that that has, the international implications that

456
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,220
has.

457
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,660
No, it's like, it's what a true statement.

458
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:36,260
Like y'all remember Anthem?

459
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:42,900
Let's do a retro throw, but the classic game of the week this week is Anthem.

460
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,260
Remember when people were really excited about Anthem?

461
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:48,540
Yeah, that's gonna be fun because in 10 years time you're not gonna be able to play that

462
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,540
game.

463
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,940
At all.

464
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:54,380
It'll be just completely dead.

465
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:57,020
Bobby does want to say a little more on what's going on.

466
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,460
I am kind of cherry picking some comments here for time.

467
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,540
But Bobby does say realize with, if you want to see all the comments, you got to go to

468
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:08,540
our Twitch page over twitch.tv slash vog network, where we do tape live every Sunday night right

469
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:12,660
after the Bobby Black Wolf show at six o'clock, seven, nine o'clock Eastern and chats do save

470
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,660
for two weeks.

471
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:17,780
They don't say forever, sadly, but they do save for two weeks.

472
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:21,660
And you can, what does save forever is episodes of Orange Launch Radio.

473
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:26,740
If you are a subscriber at vog network, you can watch endless episodes of Orange Launch

474
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:31,340
Radio and the Bobby Black Wolf show and other vog network specials as they occur, hopefully

475
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,700
more to happen in the future, but you get access to all that.

476
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:39,100
And I plug all of that because it's September and this is actually the last night that you

477
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:42,740
can actually get a half off subscription.

478
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:46,180
So if you want, at least last Sunday night, I think the actual September promotion has

479
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:50,980
a couple more days in it, however much longer September is, but September is tonight.

480
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:54,140
So if you do want to subscribe, you want to do a half off, tonight's a great time to do

481
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,140
that.

482
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:58,580
Don't forget if you are Twitch, excuse me, an Amazon prime person, you get one free prime

483
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:02,580
subscription and you can use that and then you're basically getting it for free, although

484
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,000
you already paid through it for it through Amazon prime.

485
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,380
So anyway, sorry, I had to make sure I get the little pitch.

486
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,380
I would do it once.

487
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:11,540
I don't like to sit here and beg all night long, but I had to make sure I get it out

488
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,540
at some point.

489
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:17,860
I'd be a bad broadcaster if I didn't at least try to try to course you to subscribe at least

490
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:20,100
once throughout this three hour stream.

491
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,100
Okay.

492
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:24,940
Bobby does say, realize that with the digital code, there's also server space and bandwidth

493
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:30,180
costs to transmit the game to you a little more than a fraction of a cent.

494
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:34,440
And a lot of people do kind of write that off, but it is, for example, Steam has to

495
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:40,500
run those servers to redeem keys and things like that, it ain't free.

496
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:46,460
But yeah, we can also remember that most games that are $60 out there, the actual price

497
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:51,380
that like, say your GameStop or whatever is paying is closer to $50.

498
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:57,280
So there's that markup there, which they just pocket that when they are selling it digitally.

499
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:01,280
Bobby Blackwell says, but nowadays, the vast majority of DLC doesn't get started until

500
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,280
the game is out.

501
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:07,360
Do you consider the extra Smash Brothers fighter fighters to have been ripped out of the game?

502
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,020
I'm not saying every company does it.

503
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,260
And I think that's an important point.

504
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:15,580
This is company by company and which companies do we trust and which do we not?

505
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,580
Let's put it this way.

506
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,580
It's not necessarily...

507
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:21,900
Okay, I'm trying to think of a good example of stuff that's been ripped out of games.

508
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,460
A lot of it seems to be...

509
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,060
Street Fighter 5 characters were on the disc.

510
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,280
Well, yeah, there's that.

511
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,660
The Oblivion horse armor, for God's sake.

512
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:35,740
Go throw back to the classic DLC that was on the disc.

513
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,840
The horse armor was just kind of stupid.

514
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,300
It was just kind of a dumb example of like, hey, here's something we're selling for $5.

515
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,360
You're an idiot if you buy it type of thing.

516
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,880
Whereas then the rest of the DLC that they had for like the other Oblivion stuff was

517
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,880
actually all right.

518
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,000
But there is stuff though that is, especially when you're talking about games in a franchise

519
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,500
where it's sequel to sequel, where there's features that they had before and they're

520
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:05,000
taking them out and then selling them back to you later.

521
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,120
There's stuff that's just been kind of like...

522
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:17,640
Oh, for example, so in Madden NFL, okay, Madden NFL 19, I believe, they had like X number

523
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,320
of faces that you could choose from for your characters.

524
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:26,080
This year, they have those same faces, like literally the faces are exactly the same.

525
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,120
They didn't remodel anything, they didn't do anything.

526
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:32,280
This is for your player characters, but they actually have less of them and the additional

527
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:37,680
faces that are offered that were in the last game, they're selling to you as DLC.

528
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,380
You have to buy it to those faces.

529
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,380
They're already made.

530
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:44,600
It is the same fucking model, the same...

531
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,600
They didn't change anything.

532
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:51,480
It is exactly the same and they're selling you those pieces because EA is fucking shit.

533
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,480
That's why.

534
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,920
And actually it's funny because Bobby in chat says we're giving examples from many years

535
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,920
ago.

536
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,920
Do you have games that were released in the last two years?

537
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,920
So funny enough there.

538
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,920
Yes.

539
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:00,920
And he just...

540
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,920
Madden NFL.

541
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:05,680
Actually, I was going to say, I would have said Star Wars Battlefront 2.

542
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:10,120
I mean, it wasn't so much DLC, but it was that loot box shit, right?

543
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,480
Like we all know that was like loot boxes, the new DLC, right?

544
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:19,440
But regardless, what are these two games we just gave you have in common?

545
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,440
It's EA.

546
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,440
Yeah.

547
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,440
Wow.

548
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,080
And Anthem isn't doing too well because people all kind of knew that the game was...

549
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,560
What does Anthem have in common with these games that we mentioned?

550
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,560
EA.

551
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,700
Let's not forget though.

552
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:37,880
Let's not say it's just EA, 2K games also take two, Interactive also very bad about

553
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,880
this stuff.

554
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,040
And I say that as a fan of Grand Theft Auto.

555
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,040
That's Rockstar Games.

556
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:49,400
Rockstar Games is awesome, but holy shit is like the monetization really just like ridiculous.

557
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:55,160
I don't play Grand Theft Auto online anymore, but it's gotten ridiculous is the amount of

558
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,960
money because they smell the money.

559
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,400
They know it's there.

560
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:04,120
They're just going to try to monetize the show and same with like NBA 2K 20.

561
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:09,440
That's all you hear about now is all of the monetization of loot boxes and actual gambling

562
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,440
in the game.

563
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,920
Like that's all that people are talking about.

564
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,480
I am going to reign it back a bit because we've got to distance ourselves a little bit

565
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,920
from the original topic.

566
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,120
So let me kind of like to try to wrap this up, put a bow on it.

567
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,560
Like what, where do we go from here?

568
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,920
Do we think that, you know, there's an appeal that's going to happen?

569
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,480
What's your prediction for what happens in the next 30 days?

570
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,840
I think they're going to appeal and then we'll see another court case, another argument regarding

571
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,840
it.

572
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,260
And I think if they actually are forced to do it, then they'll probably just pay the

573
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:42,260
fine and see, I don't know if the court will force them to do it after that six months,

574
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:47,720
but I think the fine would be less than what they would have to pay with.

575
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,240
I don't know if they would do that to the developers.

576
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,860
And also with, with that, it's kind of weird.

577
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,540
Why would it only be valve?

578
00:29:55,540 --> 00:30:04,780
It should be not only games, but movies, music, like anything that you're buying digital books,

579
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:10,720
anything digitally that you're purchasing that all should fall under the same thing.

580
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:16,140
So I would be, I would, whereas valve might not make a big stink about it.

581
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:19,940
The RIAA will make a big fucking stink about it.

582
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:23,020
And the movie industry will make a huge fucking stink about it.

583
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,020
Interesting.

584
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:27,980
Why would there be some type of alliance between steam and Hollywood based on what you're saying?

585
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:33,220
Because it's, it's just a slippery slope because it, why would it only pertain to games?

586
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,760
You know, it's the same model.

587
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:38,720
You're purchasing a digital license for this product.

588
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,640
So I would see that it's very much in a line.

589
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,860
And so if they're probably closely watching what's going to happen here, because if it,

590
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:51,660
if the court says, yeah, they have to be able to resell that stuff, then that would go the

591
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:56,260
same for music and all this other stuff, which they're not going to want.

592
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,260
All right.

593
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:01,340
And, and who influences YouTube the most?

594
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,540
It's the music industry and the movie industry.

595
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:07,620
So obviously they have some pole when it comes to that kind of stuff.

596
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,620
Okay.

597
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,900
Um, interesting because I would have said, I actually think it's a really interesting

598
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:14,220
point because I would have said, I bet steam just pulls out of France.

599
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,660
I bet steam cuts their losses and just pulls out of France.

600
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:20,820
But um, you know, sorry France, but I think you believe it or not.

601
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:25,040
I think you bring up a great point because it doesn't end with seem like they can decide

602
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,500
to do that, but there's going to be more.

603
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:32,700
If Hollywood isn't watching what's happening here, they damn well ought to be because it

604
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:36,800
could have, you know, especially because what Hollywood is making a shit ton of money off

605
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,800
digital now too.

606
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:42,060
I'm not just talking about things like Netflix and Hulu, but they release movies digital

607
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,180
before they're out on Blu-ray, right?

608
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:49,300
That's like a common trend now is to sell digital and why, why if I'm Hollywood, if

609
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:53,520
I'm Paramount pictures, if I'm Sony pictures, classics, if I'm, if I'm any of these movie

610
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:59,740
companies, why do I want to allow you to buy it digitally a week or two before it's out

611
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,740
on Blu-ray?

612
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,900
Why do I want you to do that?

613
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,100
So you don't rent it from red box.

614
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,940
And so I don't sell it back.

615
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,580
And so I don't take it.

616
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,260
I can't, I can't give it to a friend.

617
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,260
I can't do anything.

618
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:15,340
But like, honestly, like what is the used market for DVDs nowaday?

619
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:20,140
I mean, like, aside from, I guess, selling on like eBay or Amazon or something like that,

620
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:25,940
I mean, locally, like places that do like buy, sell, trade, I think those are very like,

621
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,860
they're almost all gone nowadays.

622
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:31,460
Like I don't think that there's a large market of aside from, I guess, you know what, there

623
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:36,660
is more of a market out there because there's, you know, the Facebook marketplace type stuff.

624
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:41,100
It is more accessible, like kind of the online marketplaces, but definitely like physical

625
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,100
marketplaces.

626
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:46,220
And, you know, we just had one of those businesses go out and because the buy, sell, trade model

627
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,620
isn't working out for them.

628
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,900
Well, physical media isn't working out for them either.

629
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,180
But yeah, I don't know.

630
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:55,580
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, usually it's France who retweet retreats.

631
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:58,540
Sorry, I screwed up your punchline.

632
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,540
Zing.

633
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,540
All right.

634
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,140
Anyway, let's move on.

635
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,140
Good discussion, though.

636
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:06,300
I'm very curious to see what the next 30, I think we'll be revisiting this topic very

637
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:10,340
soon in the next 30 days as that deadline gets closer.

638
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:14,020
But in the meantime, let's take a trip around what we've been playing this week.

639
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,900
I mentioned earlier in the show, it's been a very big week for video games.

640
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,220
I think a lot of big releases this week.

641
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,820
Let's talk about what we've gotten our hands on.

642
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:24,900
But speaking of things that you have your hands on folks in our chat room now, this

643
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:25,900
is an audio podcast.

644
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,100
Of course, it has been for forever.

645
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,740
So you guys can't see what the Twitch people are saying.

646
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:33,580
But the Twitch people are noticing like, what the hell is Loki eating?

647
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,180
Is he having like breadsticks for dinner?

648
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,180
Yes, I am.

649
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,300
Okay, so what is this?

650
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:41,580
It's Italian cheese bread from Little Caesars.

651
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,180
Okay, so there it is.

652
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,300
And it does.

653
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,300
It's it looks like a carbolicious meal.

654
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,300
It sure does.

655
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,300
It is.

656
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:51,940
You've mentioned this before that one reason you prefer to do breadsticks to pizza is that

657
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:54,700
it's like way cheaper to just not have sauce.

658
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,700
Yeah.

659
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,820
And also their pizza is not that great.

660
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:01,340
And I was short on time today and my and as I mentioned on Twitter, I don't know if anyone

661
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,340
actually follows.

662
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:08,860
The chicken place I was really loving this Korean chicken, you know, oven chicken place.

663
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:11,680
It went out of business.

664
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,980
That was a recorded episode.

665
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,580
That was the week I was out of town.

666
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,180
It was super good.

667
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:19,900
But like, and I got all my co-workers hooked on it.

668
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:24,460
And then they went out of business and they're like, no, this is horrible.

669
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,980
Why did you do that?

670
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:30,780
You know, they don't pay their rent, I guess, you know, they get evicted.

671
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,780
Yeah.

672
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,020
Pod culture says smooshes favorite chicken.

673
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,020
Yeah.

674
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,540
I will say this, even though Smoosh was going a little crazy earlier, I thought I saw him

675
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,540
lying down over here earlier.

676
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,540
He left.

677
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,540
He must have left.

678
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:43,140
He when Loki brings something like this, the cat doesn't give a shit about cheesy bread.

679
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,140
Yeah.

680
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,140
It's the chicken that he wants.

681
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:46,140
He doesn't care about.

682
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:48,380
And I wanted to get chicken, but like, sorry, this isn't crazy.

683
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,260
You very distinctly said this is not not crazy, right?

684
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,100
Because this stuff's way better than crazy bread.

685
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:56,660
It's more like a kind of a thick crust pizza without sauce and with cheese on it.

686
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:57,660
All right.

687
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,660
Let's get into video games.

688
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,660
Can't talk about food all night.

689
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,660
How was your gaming week?

690
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:04,540
Um, I did not play any of the new games that came out this week and said I played Borderlands

691
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:05,540
three.

692
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,540
So I've been playing more of that.

693
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:11,660
I'm on the second planet, probably leaving the second or leave, yeah, leaving the second

694
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,660
planet.

695
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:17,420
Um, I've been doing a lot of the side missions, so I don't have to go back.

696
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,420
It's pretty fun.

697
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:20,420
I like the game a lot.

698
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:24,820
Um, yeah, I mean, there's not much really I can say about it.

699
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:28,460
I've been wanting to do the Twitch streaming thing, but I haven't figured out how to download

700
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:34,380
the plug in or whatever that you need to do that, because that would be pretty cool to,

701
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:39,140
I guess, people that watch you can actually get loot and stuff in their games and they

702
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:43,580
can give you loot or something somehow.

703
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:46,100
So I do want to try that out at some point.

704
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:50,420
But I've been doing that and then I've been working a little bit on my game, not so much

705
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:54,940
this weekend, because like yesterday I was really tired.

706
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:58,940
I did work on it yesterday, but this morning I wanted to work on it and I was up early

707
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:02,400
because I couldn't sleep, but I couldn't sleep because I had a migraine.

708
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:05,560
And so I couldn't really work on it because my brain hurt.

709
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,820
And so, um, I'm getting there.

710
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:14,280
I'm just trying to, I had the, I shifted everything to a different, so Unity has like their standard

711
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,180
lighting engine and then they also have these new ones now.

712
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:22,840
It's um, the lightweight render engine or render pipeline is what they call it.

713
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:27,980
And so I switched all my assets over to that because you can do a thing called a shader

714
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:33,700
graph that allows you to build shaders visually using like a graph and it's pretty cool.

715
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,800
You can do all sorts of cool effects with it.

716
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:40,420
So I switched everything over that and that took a long time to get everything to be where

717
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:46,600
I wanted it to be and to actually show up like I wanted to and get the lighting correct.

718
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:49,840
And then after I got done with that, I'm like, man, I'm wasting a lot of time on stuff that

719
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,860
really should be part of polish and not actually part of the game.

720
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:57,180
But I was doing that because I was trying to get respawning of stuff in and what I was

721
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,420
doing was taking too long.

722
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:01,620
And so I was like, well, just have stuff, just teleport in and like, I don't have a

723
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,780
teleport effect.

724
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,060
Let me build one of those.

725
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:09,900
And so I did, but it was just kind of, it was a side mission on the, on the game development

726
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,900
thing.

727
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,860
So, um, but yeah, we're back, back on track of that and I'll be working through more of

728
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:17,720
that game and play more Borderlands 3.

729
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:23,540
I do want to play the untitled goose game and go through legends all as well, but not

730
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,540
yet.

731
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,540
Oh, and then Pokemon go.

732
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,540
I've been playing a little bit of that.

733
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,700
We'll talk a little more about that since it's coming up.

734
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,620
They put a new poke stop at my park.

735
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:35,740
I can't, I can't get my son's programming place to be a focus up, but they'll make the

736
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:40,740
slide at my park, a pokey site structures are acceptable portals.

737
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:43,220
So yeah, it makes sense.

738
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:47,020
Whatever it works out for me because the next time we go to the park, I don't have to like

739
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:50,040
walk over to where the, the pokey stop is or whatever.

740
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:54,840
I can just sit and watch them play and just, aren't you level 10 and ingress, can you submit

741
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,840
your own stuff?

742
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,840
I do.

743
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,840
Yeah, you should.

744
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,840
I did.

745
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,840
Cause you tried to get you.

746
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,840
Okay.

747
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,840
Yeah.

748
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:02,840
And I submitted several times.

749
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,840
I haven't gotten a rejection, but I haven't gotten an acceptance either.

750
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,840
And that was back in may.

751
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,840
Hmm.

752
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,840
Interesting.

753
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,120
I use using Ingers prime to submit is so much easier because you get to take the two photos

754
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,400
and write a justification on why it should be accepted.

755
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,400
Yeah.

756
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,680
I think when I was doing it and probably wasn't letting me, I think I did it in, um, redacted,

757
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,700
which I obviously won't be able to do very soon.

758
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,700
So yeah.

759
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:20,700
Yeah.

760
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,700
Interesting.

761
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,700
All right.

762
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,700
Oh, I did.

763
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,700
I did play ingress a little bit today too.

764
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:28,260
Oh, cause we went to a new park that I, we know we've hit all the parks in the area,

765
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,000
but apparently there was one that I missed.

766
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,040
And so I went there and you know, I was like, well, I'm done with poke stop rate or I've

767
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,320
hit all this, the Pokemon, the area, I'll leave a little bit over the ingress real quick.

768
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,860
And then I captured the two portals there and get some uniques.

769
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:42,860
Yeah.

770
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,860
Yeah.

771
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,860
That works.

772
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:45,860
All right.

773
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:50,560
Um, my gaming week, uh, Oh, real quickly, I want to mention before we get into my gaming

774
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,880
week, cause I was talking about the subscription and all that stuff and how, uh, it's September

775
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,880
and all that.

776
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:00,840
I forgot to mention, uh, Bobby Blackwell found this cool little plugin for our discord server,

777
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:04,840
where if you have your Twitch and your discord accounts, like connected, like you tell discord,

778
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,480
like this is your Twitch and whatever.

779
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:11,720
If you're actually a subscriber of our channel, you get access to a brand new chat room.

780
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,120
That's only for subscribers.

781
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,000
Um, I don't know.

782
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:18,940
I mean, obviously we kind of want to limit the use of that because you know, we want

783
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:23,140
everybody to have, you know, we don't want people to be limited by it like a money thing,

784
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:26,300
but I've been like, okay, what are some, what are some things I can put in the subscriber

785
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:29,780
chat to make people feel like, Ooh, I'm getting extra value.

786
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:32,460
So I've been posting a cat picture.

787
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:35,140
I posted some behind the scenes pictures today too.

788
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,300
I did that during Bobby's show.

789
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:39,460
I was like, Oh, maybe people would want to see like a little extra, like, what does it

790
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,320
look like here in the studio from some other angles and things like that.

791
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,700
So maybe, maybe I'll try to keep doing that.

792
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:44,700
I don't know.

793
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,600
I'll do what you want and I'll do my best to, uh, try to add that.

794
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:50,800
But if you are a subscriber, make sure you got your Twitch and your discord kind of linked

795
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,760
and then take out, take, cause it's all automated.

796
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:56,440
We're not like manually adding people, uh, take a look at our discord server over at

797
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:01,500
vog at network.com slash discord, and you can see that bonus little chat room that's

798
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,500
right there.

799
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,500
All right.

800
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,500
Let's talk about my gaming week.

801
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,560
So I have played, um, it's been a really good week for games.

802
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,800
And of course, one of the big releases that came out this week was the remake of the legend

803
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,480
of Zelda links awakening, right?

804
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,840
So, um, this is actually video that we're showing on the Twitch feed.

805
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,880
This is me playing, you can tell cause it's a Mr. Smoosh.

806
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,660
So I did a little bit of a stream earlier in the week and, uh, I continue doing some

807
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:28,380
playthrough and I did a little recording of like the first little bit of that.

808
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:31,300
Um, and you can see just how cute this game is.

809
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:35,860
I love the graphic style, um, that they went with, with the game.

810
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:40,380
Uh, it kind of reminds me of, let's say a link to the past, which is ironic because

811
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:45,520
I believe the game boy version started as a portable version of a link to the past that

812
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,360
they kind of kind of turned into its own thing.

813
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,960
Um, but you just saw on the Twitch feed, I access the map.

814
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:55,960
I love how detailed this map is that they've added in the game because you can actually

815
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,960
use map markers to help you find stuff.

816
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,440
And um, I love the sense of humor this game has.

817
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,240
Of course that was there a little bit in the original game as well, but man, it's just

818
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,040
such, I mean, remember this game was on the fricking brick game boy.

819
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,560
It was in black and white.

820
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:13,260
The resolution on those things was what, like 144 pixels wide.

821
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:16,400
Like it wasn't a lot that you could really fit on those things, but then they have like

822
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,660
gameplay color version practically like a new, yes, it was one of those games that would

823
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:23,500
play on the black and white and it would play on the color.

824
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:28,660
Um, so, uh, yeah, uh, it, it would have some enhanced color, but come on, it looks nothing

825
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:29,660
like this, right?

826
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:34,080
Still, you're really limited by that, um, resolution, but, um, some of the re-imagining

827
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,760
is some of the songs is done really well.

828
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,180
Even the little doo, doo, doo, doo tone sounds like really cool.

829
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:45,220
Um, Oh, which I think I just kind of hit in the video there.

830
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,220
How ironic.

831
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:52,880
Um, but yeah, so, um, it just looks so good and it's, it's like kind of like that classic

832
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,880
Zelda.

833
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:57,060
I mean, obviously Zelda's kind of gone like two different directions, right?

834
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:01,620
Like this is the more Nintendo super Nintendo style, which we, which we got to revisit a

835
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:05,220
little bit when they did a link between two worlds on the 3DS, right?

836
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:10,480
So it's like we haven't had like a 2D or a 2.5 D Zelda in a long time.

837
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:15,600
So this fills a void that I think a lot of us like people that really like their old

838
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,600
school games.

839
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:21,100
I think this game really fills a void that many of us have been like craving, even if

840
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,960
it is a re-imagining of an older game.

841
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:23,960
You know what?

842
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,000
I barely fricking remember that old game.

843
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I never played the old game.

844
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,160
Oh, well then it's practically like playing a new game for you.

845
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:35,580
But I think even for me, like I kind of remembered the beginning-ish of the game a little bit,

846
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:40,320
but then from there, I don't, I didn't even remember that you were trying to collect instruments.

847
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,860
Like I didn't even remember that that was a thing in the game at all.

848
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:47,500
So, um, it's almost like playing a brand new Zelda game to me, honestly.

849
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,400
So I'm a big fan.

850
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,180
I have not, however, sadly gotten to the dungeon maker mode yet.

851
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:55,980
Um, that's something I think that I get a little later.

852
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:59,180
Um, I, it does not seem to be in the game by default.

853
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:04,100
Somebody was saying that it replaces like an older mode in the, um, old, uh, Link's Awakening

854
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,340
game on the Game Boy.

855
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:09,220
So it's something that I'll come across probably a little later in the game.

856
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:13,900
So, uh, Slidekick in chat says it looks like a toy village and I want toys out of it.

857
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:14,900
Yeah.

858
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:17,900
I mean, it's just, well, you can get an amiibo, which I have resisted.

859
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,260
I haven't really bought a lot of amiibo in a long time.

860
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:24,100
It doesn't seem like it did, did very much other than like, it said it put a dark version

861
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,820
of Link in your dungeon when you do the dungeon maker.

862
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:27,820
Interesting.

863
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:28,820
Yeah.

864
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:34,180
The amiibo in these games shouldn't do a lot, you know, it shouldn't, it shouldn't like

865
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:36,340
radically affect the game, right?

866
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:39,460
So a little something, something is, is okay.

867
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:42,340
So anyway, I am enjoying Link's Awakening.

868
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:45,260
I just, I, I love the 2D Zelda.

869
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:46,260
Don't get me wrong.

870
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:51,600
Like Breath of the Wild really kind of really won me over on 3D Zelda games the way I'm

871
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,260
not sure any other Zelda game has in a long time.

872
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:57,460
I don't know when I first played Twilight Princess on the Wii, like I fricking loved

873
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:58,460
that game too.

874
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:02,620
You know, the 3D Zeldas have always been kind of just like a different direction to me.

875
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:05,620
It's really great to revisit the old school Zelda games as well.

876
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:09,180
So I am a big fan of that.

877
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:14,060
I've also been playing a little bit of classic World of Warcraft, still leveling my priest.

878
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:15,340
I see slykicks in chat.

879
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:17,340
We've been actually teaming up on some things a little bit.

880
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:22,400
I hit level 17 on my priest today, which for classic wow, that's like hitting end game

881
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,400
and current wow.

882
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,580
So I would say I'm doing pretty well so far.

883
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:29,860
I'm at a high enough level where I could go to the dead mines pretty soon.

884
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:32,660
I've still been playing Final Fantasy 14 as well.

885
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:33,660
I don't know if Shane's in chat.

886
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:37,700
I thought I saw him earlier, but we've still been teaming up a little bit.

887
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:42,940
My gun blade, I always mess up the name of the, I was, I almost said gunslinger because

888
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:47,260
I can never remember the right name of the class, but my gun blade I've, who have actually

889
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:51,500
really been enjoying playing as a tank class.

890
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:56,500
I love playing that class, um, is now level 72.

891
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,500
I think I'm going to hit 72 yesterday.

892
00:44:58,500 --> 00:44:59,500
So that's, that's it.

893
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:00,500
Oh, good.

894
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,500
I still can't get the name right.

895
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,500
It's gunbreaker.

896
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,900
Shane, you know what ruined me?

897
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:11,700
It's that one night when we were sitting there and we were calling it all these random wrong

898
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:12,700
names.

899
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,700
Now I can't remember the right names anymore.

900
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:16,940
Uh, I'm dying.

901
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:20,520
See my gunbreaker, whatever it's called is like level 72, which getting pretty close

902
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,360
to max level, max levels 80.

903
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,760
So I'm, I'm doing good.

904
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:25,760
Just so you know.

905
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:26,760
All right.

906
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:30,040
That cat, what can you do?

907
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,040
All right.

908
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:35,040
Is his other dad should be home maybe in about 30 minutes and hopefully we'll shut him up.

909
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,040
All right.

910
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:39,800
Anyhow, I got to talk about one other game that I played this week because I love this

911
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,800
game.

912
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:42,920
So, you know, a lot of people are saying that this is like a new music game that you really

913
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,480
have to check out, right?

914
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:48,720
I don't know if I would say that this is a music game, but it's a game you really should

915
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,720
check out.

916
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:55,360
Sayonara Wild Hearts and uh, Willie has some gameplay on Twitch, uh, that again, I recorded

917
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,600
this myself, so there's flaws and everything.

918
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:02,240
You're going to see me hit a wall at some point and it just kind of, it just drops you

919
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,740
back a little bit and you have to kind of keep going.

920
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:09,320
So folks are calling this a music game and I felt like it was something I kind of had

921
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:12,840
to check out because I am a fan of music games and things like that.

922
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:17,200
Um, I actually, I'm not sure this is a music game.

923
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:21,440
Are there parts of the game where you have to like hit a button in a certain rhythm?

924
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,840
Yes, that does exist.

925
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,840
Is the soundtrack incredible?

926
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:26,840
Fuck yes it is.

927
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:27,840
This is an incredible soundtrack.

928
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:31,660
I know it's really hard for you to hear in the studio because we have to lower the audio

929
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:35,440
or they can't hear over our voices and we have to echo, um, but hopefully over the stream

930
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,640
and on the podcast you can hear a little bit of music in the background.

931
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:40,640
It is a great soundtrack.

932
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:44,640
I mean, it's just like, I actually looked up the soundtrack on Spotify and I've been

933
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:45,640
listening to it in my car.

934
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:46,640
It's so good.

935
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:49,560
Um, so what is the game if it's not really a music game?

936
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,960
You know what it is to me?

937
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:51,960
Okay.

938
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,680
It kind of, see, here's the rhythm part.

939
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:57,400
That's where like, I'm actually like hitting the button with it, but this game is so fucking

940
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,400
stylish.

941
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,400
I mean, look at it.

942
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:04,920
Like they're freaking jumping and doing twirls and going down this road and now she's flying

943
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:09,500
through the air and it's like this pilot wings type of sequence or something and it just,

944
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:10,500
it looks beautiful.

945
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:15,040
This is one of those games where it's like, you're going to sit there and tell me video

946
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,040
games aren't art.

947
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:20,800
Fucking play Sayonara Wild Hearts because this is like art in motion.

948
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,800
It's beautiful.

949
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:24,960
Um, but I would say this game, you know what it reminds me of?

950
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:25,960
Okay.

951
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,600
Do you guys remember the bonus stage in Sonic the Hedgehog 2?

952
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:29,600
No.

953
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,600
No.

954
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:33,400
You remember you had that big tail pipe and you would run up and down and collect the

955
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:37,560
rings and like you would try to avoid the little spikes and things.

956
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,560
Okay.

957
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:41,480
That, but make it 2019.

958
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:47,200
I kind of feel like that's the best way I can describe Sayonara Wild Hearts.

959
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:54,880
Imagine Sonic the Hedgehog 2's bonus stage, but like 2019 and a beautiful as hell.

960
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,820
Oh, this is another stage that, cause I wanted to make sure I included more than one song.

961
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:01,860
So there's another stage that's a little more of a first person view.

962
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:06,440
So it almost feels like you're playing like a racing game at some points until you know,

963
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:08,160
again, it gets very stylish.

964
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,580
Now it's a shooter.

965
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:12,660
You're like auto shooting these obstacles that are ahead of you.

966
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:16,940
And at some point if I talk long, long enough, you get to see like the big three headed dog

967
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:18,940
that comes out and all this stuff.

968
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:23,980
Um, S200 Matt in chat says Annapurna Interactive does such amazing games like this.

969
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:24,980
Yeah.

970
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:25,980
They're a great publishing company.

971
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:30,860
Uh, the developer was another company out of Sweden whose name I forget in the moment,

972
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:35,660
but they are very big on like iPhone games has been their bread and butter.

973
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:40,660
Um, and so this is their first game that was kind of beyond just the iPhone.

974
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:42,140
Now this game is available on iPhone.

975
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:46,340
It's actually a Apple arcade because that was the whole big thing last week.

976
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,340
Right?

977
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:48,340
Yeah.

978
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:51,340
So some people are experienced because all it is, it's just, uh, even if you are playing

979
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:55,340
on the Nintendo switch where I captured this game, it's just using the controller and then

980
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:56,340
using the button.

981
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:57,340
That's it.

982
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:58,340
It's controller slash one button.

983
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:02,340
So I imagine on a mobile, it's just probably like dragging around the screen, probably

984
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:03,340
very simple.

985
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:11,020
Uh, it is also available on PlayStation four, not available on Android and also not available

986
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:12,020
on PC.

987
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:16,620
So you would have to do PS4, no Xbox, no Xbox right now.

988
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:20,460
No, it's, it's an interesting kind of lineup, but I think I'm a fat out of B roll there.

989
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:25,180
It's an interesting lineup though of, uh, you know, the, uh, the iPhone and then two

990
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:29,100
more traditional consoles with the switch and the PlayStation four, but I highly recommend

991
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:30,100
it.

992
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,500
I think if you are a fan of music games, you're going to like this enough.

993
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:35,500
I just, you know, when I first heard it was a music game, I was like, Oh, it's going to

994
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:40,100
be like elite beat agents, or it's going to be like, you know, guitar, Roman or something.

995
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:44,260
I don't know if I really see that, but I just think the soundtrack is so good and kind of

996
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:45,460
adjacent to the music.

997
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:46,460
I really enjoyed it.

998
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:49,940
A lot of those games, I think most music game fans are going to get a kick enough out of

999
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:50,940
this.

1000
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:53,100
I, I, I think this will be one of my top games of the year.

1001
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:54,100
I really do.

1002
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:56,860
Uh, the one complaint it's really short, it's a short game.

1003
00:49:56,860 --> 00:50:00,780
So there's a lot of people that are probably going to be like, Oh, I beat it in two hours.

1004
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:01,780
That's it.

1005
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:05,460
Um, you know, like most music games, there's only what, like 20 songs in it or something

1006
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:06,460
like that.

1007
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:09,460
So once you kind of get there, it does tell a story it's, uh, you know, kind of from start

1008
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:12,220
to finish, I'll, I'll let you all kind of experience that on your own if you want to

1009
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:13,220
play it.

1010
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:14,440
Um, but it is a short game.

1011
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:18,300
I would say though, it's one of those games where there's a lot of room for improvement.

1012
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:24,100
Um, and, uh, if you, uh, you might, I have yet to get a gold rank on a stage.

1013
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,100
Let me put it that way.

1014
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:28,260
I've gotten some bronze ranks, some silver ranks, but it's really hard.

1015
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:31,500
You really have to memorize the patterns and what's coming up in order to get a gold

1016
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:32,500
rank.

1017
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,500
So there is some replay value in that regard.

1018
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,540
And here's some other interesting news.

1019
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:39,980
The game kind of has a Bobby Black Wolf mode sort of built in.

1020
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:44,780
So what'll happen, um, if you keep slamming into the same tree over and over, let's say

1021
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:50,220
once you screw up like three or four times, what'll happen is one of the like spirits,

1022
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:53,900
it's kind of part of the game's mythology will show up and say, it seems that you're

1023
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:55,780
having difficulty passing this part.

1024
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:57,540
Would you like to skip this part?

1025
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:59,660
And you can just skip right past it and go to the next part.

1026
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:05,360
Um, or you can say no, or you can say no and never offer this again.

1027
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:09,060
So depending on the type of gamer you are, you know, if you're Bobby Black Wolf, you

1028
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:11,020
might say, yeah, I'm going to skip this one part.

1029
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:12,020
It's kind of hard.

1030
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:15,020
But if you're like, you know, that hardcore gamer, you can say no and never bother me

1031
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:16,060
ever again.

1032
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:17,340
So there is that.

1033
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:21,940
So, uh, uh, Shad is in chat saying, have you tackled the hidden riddles yet?

1034
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:22,940
No, I have not.

1035
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:26,640
I've, I've, I feel like I've barely scratched the surface on what this game has to offer.

1036
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:30,720
So, um, I've got plenty more to explore, but, uh, it's just, what can I say?

1037
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,040
It's been a crazy week for games, lots of stuff.

1038
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,660
There's other games that came out that I haven't gotten around to yet.

1039
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:40,080
I know a lot of people are really excited about the, um, I keep wanting to say asshole

1040
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:44,480
goose game, but I guess they really did officially change the title, untitled goose game.

1041
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,460
I guess it's probably easier to convince more families to play it, uh, when it's untitled

1042
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:51,320
goose game, but y'all know wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

1043
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,320
That's why it's untitled.

1044
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,320
Right?

1045
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,520
Cause it wasn't the development name, asshole goose game.

1046
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,520
I don't know.

1047
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,520
All right.

1048
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:58,520
Anyway, I swear.

1049
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:00,280
I think that's what they just, people are calling it.

1050
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,280
Yeah.

1051
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:05,120
So, uh, I still need to get on that, but it's been, and, and Shane is in chat saying, yeah,

1052
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,120
you haven't played the best game of the year that came out this week.

1053
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:08,400
I know he's a big fan of it.

1054
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,600
Uh, hopefully we'll hear from the, uh, hear from him later in the show to tell us more

1055
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,600
about the game.

1056
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:16,120
Um, but, uh, yeah, it's just, there's, this has been a really good week for games.

1057
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:18,480
The fall season is here, right?

1058
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:24,360
Like the first leaf falls from the tree, pumpkin spice lattes are in full swing and here come

1059
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:27,360
the fall video game releases like big time.

1060
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:31,160
This week was huge and it's just, what are some other big, I mean, borderlands as well

1061
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,560
was just within the past two weeks.

1062
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:33,560
Yeah.

1063
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:34,560
I mean that was a huge kickoff too.

1064
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:35,920
What do we have coming up in the next couple weeks?

1065
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:36,920
Control was another one.

1066
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:37,920
Oh yeah.

1067
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:38,920
Control.

1068
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:39,920
Oh my God.

1069
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:40,920
I want to play that one too.

1070
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,720
And in the next couple of weeks, what, we have a big one coming out this week too.

1071
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:43,720
Right.

1072
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:46,280
Um, I feel like there was something this weekend that's a big deal.

1073
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,280
That's coming out too.

1074
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,760
There's a lot of stuff going on.

1075
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:53,400
So there's probably, I mean, there's always big stuff coming out in the fourth quarter.

1076
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,400
Yeah.

1077
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:59,200
Don't say leading up to the, uh, it was a big release this weekend.

1078
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:05,400
Maybe I'm, yeah, there's, um, a few things coming out.

1079
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:12,320
Um, you know, anything really huge that jumps out at me, there was something, I don't know.

1080
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:13,320
It's fine.

1081
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:14,320
You know, CUNY was last week.

1082
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:17,040
So you know, well, yeah, there's another one I got to pick up, although that one's just

1083
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:20,920
kind of like a redo on the switch, so I feel a little okay skipping that one cause I did

1084
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:21,920
play that.

1085
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:26,000
Um, also I guess I could say this one other little FIFA, that's another one.

1086
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:32,040
One other little thing that I picked up was I found, um, at Walmart, another for my little

1087
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:36,800
mini arcade machine collection, they have mortal combat now in the collection.

1088
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,520
That's actually, um, on Twitch.

1089
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:41,400
For those that are looking towards the right side of the screen, there's a Pac-Man that's

1090
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,960
brand new as well in color, but you know, Pac-Man y'all seen Pac-Man, but now there's

1091
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,000
a mortal combat.

1092
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,200
And what's funny about the mortal combat, um, I'm actually going to show this on screen

1093
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,200
here.

1094
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,200
I'll walk up.

1095
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:56,440
But there's actually six buttons on the mortal combat machine and look, he was like, what's

1096
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,440
that for?

1097
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,600
It has two block buttons for whatever reason.

1098
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,040
I don't know why they set it up.

1099
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:03,240
Like you said that it was emulated off of the Genesis version.

1100
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,460
So when you look at it, it really looks like the Genesis version.

1101
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:07,460
So here's the funny thing.

1102
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:11,480
I bought two because the other was for dark Sakura.

1103
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:15,680
So I want to show you, uh, what it looks like real quick on the Twitch stream, but you're

1104
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:18,040
going to have to talk through this here while I do this.

1105
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:19,040
Yeah.

1106
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,080
Um, yeah.

1107
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:22,960
Cause I noticed something like, well, doesn't that normally have five buttons?

1108
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,760
That's kind of weird, but yeah, there it is.

1109
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:30,840
And it's, it's glory.

1110
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:36,800
It's very, uh, lifelike and you can tell it kind of looks like the Genesis version to

1111
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:37,800
me.

1112
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:43,200
I mean, but I mean, I mean, it's still like, you know, can you imagine back when you're

1113
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:48,160
playing moral combat when it first came out that, Hey, you know, someday they're going

1114
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,980
to have a tabletop version of that.

1115
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:53,840
That's really, you know, I know a few bucks.

1116
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:57,000
I'm trying to think of how to like tell people how big that is.

1117
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,280
It's about like, it's not that much bigger than like maybe my stream tech.

1118
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,280
I don't know.

1119
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:05,320
I don't know how to like relate the size of that thing, but it's really not that big.

1120
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:09,960
So, uh, dark Tetsuya does point out moral combat is the Genesis one, but there's no

1121
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:10,960
blood code.

1122
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:11,960
See, I knew it.

1123
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:15,400
I knew there was going to be something with those that they wouldn't, that I was like,

1124
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,800
they sell these in the kid's aisle.

1125
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,840
They've got to do something because I was even talking to the checkout lady about it.

1126
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:23,120
Uh, she was saying something like, Oh, mortal combat.

1127
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:26,880
They have this in one of these little machines and I was like, yeah, uh, I'm like, it's,

1128
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:27,880
it's back there.

1129
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:31,280
I said, I bet though I wouldn't buy it for kids, but they have Pac-Man as well.

1130
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,920
I don't remember the topic kind of came up, but, um, yeah, I kind of figured if it was

1131
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:37,280
the Genesis version, it may not, a lot of people forget.

1132
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,280
Yes.

1133
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:41,480
The Genesis version had blood, but you had to put in a code.

1134
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:42,480
What was it?

1135
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,480
A B B A C A Abiaka or something.

1136
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,480
I don't remember.

1137
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,480
Do you guys remember the code?

1138
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:51,160
Who remembers the blood code, but I don't think you can just put it in, in that machine.

1139
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:54,960
Sadly, um, uh, sort of adjacent to this one, Abba cab.

1140
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:59,080
Oh, I was really close Abba cab, uh, ABB, AC ABB.

1141
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:03,280
Um, tiger class says, speaking of mortal combat, I posted a video that had the actors who played

1142
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,440
Lou Kang and Johnny cage playing on the mortal combat arcade.

1143
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:09,200
One up cabinet, the actors from the original mortal combat movie.

1144
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,520
That is not the new one.

1145
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:14,920
Um, Oh, from the movie, like, see, when I originally saw actors from moral combat, I

1146
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:19,360
thought it was the people that they performance captured for the moral combat was the original.

1147
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,360
That's weird.

1148
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:21,360
It was the original mortal combat movie.

1149
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,360
Oh yeah.

1150
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:23,360
Tiger club.

1151
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:27,800
Put that in our discord over, uh, vog network.com VOG network.com slash discord, um, actually

1152
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:28,800
put that video.

1153
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:33,280
I imagine the whole thing was probably a sales pitch for the arcade one up because, uh, actually

1154
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,420
not only do you see the baby machine, but then when I went over to the software area,

1155
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:40,840
they had those big arcade one up cabinets for like 299 bucks or however they went.

1156
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:43,680
And I saw the mortal combat one sitting there, Lord.

1157
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,160
I was tempted.

1158
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:52,320
I was tempted, but since I'm like new at my job still, and I'm in that awkward, I got

1159
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:55,320
paid from the last job, but I haven't gotten paid at the new job yet.

1160
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:59,040
You know, y'all know, if you ever change, y'all know that you end up in that weird kind

1161
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:03,720
of like times where you don't have a paycheck for a little bit.

1162
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,600
Um, so that's in that weird gap that I'm at right now.

1163
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:11,120
So, um, I have to wait until I spoil myself with things like that.

1164
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:15,680
Uh, Tochen says, go get the mortal combat to arcade one up bundle from Costco.

1165
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:16,680
It's upgrading.

1166
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:17,680
You get more for your dollar.

1167
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:18,760
You know, it's like $300.

1168
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:19,760
That one was 20 bucks.

1169
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,000
Not even that was like 1980, something like that.

1170
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,880
So I do want those arcade one up machines though.

1171
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:25,880
Don't get me wrong.

1172
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:28,120
But then I'm also like, where the fuck am I going to fit that in this house?

1173
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:31,420
I have, I need less crap in this house, not more crap.

1174
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:32,420
That's the other big problem.

1175
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:33,420
All right.

1176
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:35,200
Anyway, that's enough for our gaming weeks.

1177
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:38,200
I think we should get into some of the news stories from this week.

1178
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:42,560
We're going to start off with, we were just talking about this during our gaming weeks.

1179
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,280
So let's get into, uh, Pokemon.

1180
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:45,280
Yeah.

1181
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:50,200
So Pokemon go has expanded into the Unova region, which I thought it was just a few

1182
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,200
of them that came out.

1183
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:54,840
I didn't realize that it was the whole thing, but, um, apparently, yeah, they've got quite

1184
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,760
a few new Pokemon.

1185
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:05,360
So um, right now it's, it looks like about like maybe like eight to 10 new Pokemon that

1186
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,360
are popping up.

1187
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,200
I've gotten a few of the angry chipmunk one and also the pigeon.

1188
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,640
I love the pigeon one.

1189
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,480
It's my new favorite.

1190
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:17,400
Um, and Shane's bringing up a very important point in our chat room is that it's not all

1191
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:18,400
a gen five.

1192
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,080
It's like the first part.

1193
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,800
They're doing this like they did gen four.

1194
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:25,840
They're giving you the starters and some of the trashy Mon, you know, a little taste.

1195
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:30,520
Um, but it's not the whole thing, but Shane, I'm surprised your reaction wasn't more like,

1196
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:33,680
we got Oshawa and that's all that we need.

1197
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,520
You want to hear what I did this week?

1198
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:39,320
You want to hear, I'm going to expose Shane as the cheater he is, but I enabled it a little

1199
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:40,320
bit.

1200
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:44,240
So Shane's favorite Pokemon is Oshawa, which is one of the starters in gen five, right?

1201
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:48,600
The, the cute little like otter thing with the shell on its chest, which I never realized

1202
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:51,200
he actually like rips off the chest and like attacks with.

1203
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,600
It's like super cute.

1204
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:58,120
Um, so, uh, that's his favorite, but that one's, it's really hard to find.

1205
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,920
They don't have those everywhere.

1206
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:05,360
So I think Shane was able to catch like one, uh, in his adventures well in looking at the

1207
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:09,520
local discord down in Elk Grove here locally at the sports park there.

1208
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:10,520
Guess what?

1209
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:12,180
It's an Oshawa nest.

1210
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:16,920
So Shane logged out of his account, stayed out of his account for five hours and then

1211
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:24,680
had me log into his account at this nest and just catch Oshawa at the park so that then

1212
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:28,300
we stayed out of it for another five hours or whatever the travel time would feasibly

1213
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:31,000
be at a Boise to hop on a plane or whatever.

1214
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,880
And uh, he logged into back into the account and he had a ton of Oshawa because actually

1215
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:35,920
it wasn't just that.

1216
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:40,520
So it wasn't just me catching them, but then Alan, and this was Alan's idea, Alan caught

1217
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:45,400
a bunch as well and was like, well, why don't I just trade Shane?

1218
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:48,760
Like like I'm going to have 20 of these, only two or three of them are going to be decently

1219
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:49,760
appraised.

1220
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:54,760
I'll just trade all these one star zero star Oshawa and he can have more.

1221
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:57,240
And I was like, Shane would probably really like that.

1222
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,780
So we filled up his account with Oshawa.

1223
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:04,400
So I know, and, and one of those Oshawa when we traded one of them went lucky.

1224
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:07,040
So he got like a lucky on his account.

1225
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:09,200
So I know he's got to be happy with all that thing.

1226
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:13,460
So, uh, so yeah, the gen five starters, they do nest.

1227
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:17,040
It's just that since they're competing with all the other nests out there, they can be

1228
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,040
hard to find.

1229
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:23,680
Um, but I imagine the other, uh, uh, starters, the little fire piggy, uh, and the grass thing

1230
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:25,600
that looks like all the other grass things.

1231
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:30,400
Um, they also nest, uh, as well, which I haven't caught either of those other starters.

1232
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,360
Oshawa's the only starter I've caught so far, but I did.

1233
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:37,440
I went out there and caught, you know, P dove and there was one, one little cat things

1234
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:40,080
per something was on the house earlier.

1235
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:46,160
Um, I got the, like I said, it looked like an angry chipmunk or something.

1236
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:47,360
I don't know what that is.

1237
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:49,320
Oh, the, uh, Pat rat.

1238
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:52,160
Uh, maybe I know they get my decks here.

1239
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,160
Let's see.

1240
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:54,160
Yeah.

1241
01:00:54,160 --> 01:01:01,620
So it was, I got the, um, yeah, Pat rat and then, um, the little pup and I swear the pigeon

1242
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:02,960
one was one as well.

1243
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,520
But maybe is that last gen still?

1244
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,320
No P dove is gen five.

1245
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:08,320
Really?

1246
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:09,320
Yeah.

1247
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:10,320
Where is it then?

1248
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:11,320
Did I not catch it?

1249
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:12,320
Maybe you haven't caught it yet.

1250
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:13,960
I started to get this from gen five.

1251
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:17,200
I actually, I just caught, there was an evolved because I had a silhouette.

1252
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,200
Oh no, here it is.

1253
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,200
Here it is.

1254
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,200
I didn't know it.

1255
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:21,240
See, it was stuck at the bottom there.

1256
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:23,600
One of the evolved, one of those I caught in the wild randomly.

1257
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:27,240
I didn't think I'd find one of those, but it was at the park and I was walking around

1258
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:28,240
there earlier today.

1259
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:32,920
So, um, but yeah, uh, I got to say gen five kind of has me interested in Pokemon again.

1260
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:36,600
Cause I was, I was really burned out on it, um, honestly.

1261
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:39,480
And then when Harry Potter came out, I was like, Oh, something else to play.

1262
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:45,040
But now it's like, I'm kind of burned out on Ingress at this point, which is bad because

1263
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:51,200
Ingress, uh, we have that anomaly coming up here locally, but I think it's all the, and

1264
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,440
I don't know how much I can really talk about it.

1265
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,540
It's all the planning that goes into an anomaly.

1266
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:59,680
I'm like already like, can this anomaly be done please?

1267
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:01,480
So I'm kind of like burned out on Ingress at this point.

1268
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:04,660
So Pokemon goes kind of like the thing where I'm like, okay, Ooh, there's something new

1269
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:06,480
and shiny going on over here.

1270
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,520
So I want to go play this game for a little bit.

1271
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:10,760
So it's fun kind of catching the new stuff.

1272
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:14,240
So people are like finally getting presents from me again when people were like, why haven't

1273
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,720
you sent me a present in two months?

1274
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:20,120
Cause I haven't been playing, I got distracted by like Harry Potter and stuff.

1275
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:21,480
What can I, what can I say?

1276
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:22,480
All right.

1277
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:27,000
Um, uh, Totion says, Rob, don't forget about those hot Mr. Mime eggs.

1278
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:32,760
I didn't get a shiny Mr. Mime, but I did get a shiny, um, Tauros hatched from an egg.

1279
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:37,560
And I caught shiny, two of them, shiny Yanma are going on this weekend.

1280
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:41,880
Those really gross looking bug things, but they're green and blue and the shiny one,

1281
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:44,120
they're kind of a cute little, uh, color combination.

1282
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:48,560
I caught two randomly at work, so I guess I shouldn't complain cause I bet some people

1283
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:51,620
are having a hard time even, uh, capturing one.

1284
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:55,120
So now act deaf to screaming at me to open my damn gifts.

1285
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:56,320
I'm sorry.

1286
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:58,760
It's because we're already four star friends act deaf.

1287
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:02,420
So I tend to prioritize the people that are lower on the list.

1288
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:03,420
So sorry.

1289
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:09,480
Um, I will do my best, but yeah, if we weren't limited to 20 a day, I'd open more gifts,

1290
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:14,320
but yeah, it's, I am really bad at opening gifts, but like when I'm out there for community

1291
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:19,420
day, I think on community day, I sent a gift to every single person on my list.

1292
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:23,280
If I could, unless you like had one in the backlog, I don't know.

1293
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:24,280
Anyway.

1294
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:24,820
All right.

1295
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:27,200
So Pokemon go, we'll see how long the gen five thing lasts for.

1296
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:31,840
And hopefully, um, people will be, um, continue to be interested in the game.

1297
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:35,160
Uh, but what long, what long legs this game has had?

1298
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:35,660
Yes.

1299
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:36,160
Right.

1300
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:40,720
When most people thought it was, yeah, most people said it was a dead game a long time

1301
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:41,720
ago.

1302
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:44,480
Um, this game has a very long life.

1303
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:49,880
This series anyway, dragon quest is the next series to talk about dragon quest one, two,

1304
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:55,960
and three, those new little remakes, uh, the little, uh, reimagining of the game.

1305
01:03:55,960 --> 01:04:00,800
They are coming out in the U S that's very exciting because these were available in Japan

1306
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:01,800
previously.

1307
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:05,420
Uh, it's kind of like a reimagined version of dragon quest one, two, and three, which

1308
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:08,760
of course with the NES games in the series back in the day.

1309
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:13,580
Um, so they, the, the reimagining or it's just kind of like HD textures and things like

1310
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:20,220
that are coming out, uh, on the Nintendo switch eShop on September 27th, just in time

1311
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:26,480
for dragon quest 11 S echoes of an elusive age that is also launching the same day.

1312
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,620
And I'm sure many people are looking forward to that.

1313
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:33,860
Um, I don't, I want to get dragon quest 11, but it's like, I already bought it on PlayStation

1314
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:34,860
four.

1315
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:38,820
So I'm kind of waiting to see if maybe there will be a price reduction or something like

1316
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:39,820
that.

1317
01:04:39,820 --> 01:04:40,820
Couple of things.

1318
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:42,700
We'll see what one, we became lucky friends.

1319
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:45,620
Did we really to your cat's eating plastic?

1320
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:46,620
So I'm not really sure.

1321
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:47,620
All right.

1322
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:48,820
I need to take care of the smush thing.

1323
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:53,700
Can you, uh, talk about, uh, dragon quest memories or something on topic?

1324
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:58,460
So yeah, I remember playing dragon warrior because that's how I remember it.

1325
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:02,180
And um, it was like one of the first games that I borrowed from a friend actually.

1326
01:05:02,180 --> 01:05:06,020
Um, cause I, I don't know, it was just different.

1327
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:09,340
I think I remember seeing in like a Nintendo power or something, I was like, Oh, I got

1328
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:10,340
to try that.

1329
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:16,020
Um, I don't think I ever finished it unless I cheated with the game genie, but I don't

1330
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:17,980
think I ever finished the dragon warrior game.

1331
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,180
I think I gave up on them.

1332
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:20,740
I mean, you follow fancy though.

1333
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:22,020
I went through some of those.

1334
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:24,920
I did beat the original dragon warrior actually.

1335
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:27,380
And it was thanks to, uh, the, uh, guide.

1336
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:28,380
Oh yeah.

1337
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:29,380
Yeah.

1338
01:05:29,380 --> 01:05:32,740
You got, remember Nintendo power, put out that guy to try to really get that, uh, series

1339
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:34,100
hyped out here.

1340
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:36,820
So now what are we going to trade?

1341
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:37,820
I don't know.

1342
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:38,820
I don't know.

1343
01:05:38,820 --> 01:05:39,820
I think shinies.

1344
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:43,540
I want a shiny to go lucky and then I can, cause that'll guarantee that it'll be a high

1345
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:46,820
appraisal and then we can really, uh, amp it up.

1346
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:49,140
So I think that's, do you have shinies that are worth a damn?

1347
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:52,180
Uh, I mean, I don't really care about my shiny, so that's fine.

1348
01:05:52,180 --> 01:05:53,180
All right.

1349
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:56,260
We'll have to look, we'll have to decide later, maybe during the break, uh, uh, later tonight

1350
01:05:56,260 --> 01:05:57,260
we'll figure that out.

1351
01:05:57,260 --> 01:05:59,140
But I'm excited for the dragon quest reimagines.

1352
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:01,100
I definitely want to pick up at least part one.

1353
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:05,660
I never really played part two or part three as much, but maybe I will.

1354
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:06,740
I'm not sure yet.

1355
01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:11,660
The original dragon quest, $5, four 99, five bucks, excuse me.

1356
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:17,580
Dragon quest two will be six 49 drag quest three, 12 49, but a dragon quest three was

1357
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:19,960
a pretty beefy game if I remember right.

1358
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:22,020
So yeah, not too surprised.

1359
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:26,180
Uh, active says trade either a legendary or a shiny or a shiny legendary.

1360
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:27,180
Yeah.

1361
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:28,180
I don't know what Loki has available.

1362
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:36,620
Got a cast form, boo, uh, uh, Charmeleon shinies, gold duck, uh, magnum megalith.

1363
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:37,860
I don't know how to pronounce that thing.

1364
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:39,340
The weird like thing.

1365
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:40,340
And then a Venusaur.

1366
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:41,340
Okay.

1367
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:44,260
He's, he's looking pretty skimpy on the shiny, so we're gonna have to see if we can trade

1368
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:45,260
a legendary or something.

1369
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:46,260
We'll see.

1370
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:47,260
All right.

1371
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:48,260
Anyway, we'll figure that out later.

1372
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:49,500
That's fun that we went lucky though.

1373
01:06:49,500 --> 01:06:51,500
Uh, let's move on.

1374
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:52,500
Next story.

1375
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:53,500
All right.

1376
01:06:53,500 --> 01:07:03,340
Um, so Sony had purchased, uh, is insomniac games and you may remember insomniac games,

1377
01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:08,340
um, also happened to put out a game aside from, you know, Spiderman and ratchet and

1378
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:13,980
clank a game on the Xbox, uh, one called sunset overdrive.

1379
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:20,060
And well now because of that purchase, you know, apparently Sony interactive entertainment

1380
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:25,980
does now hold the rights to, um, their past work, including sunset overdrive.

1381
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:33,100
So, but right now though, they don't have any sort of interest in working out an agreement

1382
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:38,420
to port sunset or sunset overdrive to the PlayStation four, but they are looking forward

1383
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:46,980
to future titles according to, um, Sony interactive entertainment president, uh, Shahey Yoshida.

1384
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:51,300
So that's unfortunate cause sunset overdrive, I thought was pretty cool.

1385
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:54,840
Um, I still haven't played it though, but it looked cool.

1386
01:07:54,840 --> 01:08:01,180
Maybe we'll see a sequel to sunset overdrive come to, uh, the PlayStation four, much like

1387
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:04,980
we did with Titanfall where Titanfall one never made it to the PlayStation four, but

1388
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:06,180
Titanfall two did.

1389
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:10,980
So maybe there's hope in that sense if they decide to, um, do a new game.

1390
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:16,060
But I don't believe that the first game sold all that well, but that's never stopped people

1391
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:17,140
in the past.

1392
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:20,900
So we'll have to wait and see, I guess.

1393
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:21,900
Yeah.

1394
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:25,900
Um, I would be curious, uh, what Sony's going to do with this.

1395
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:28,820
I feel like a sequel might be a thing on PlayStation five.

1396
01:08:28,820 --> 01:08:34,580
Like, you know, this game was kind of like cults hit enough that maybe they're gonna,

1397
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:40,340
you know, use this new acquisition to make it happen on PlayStation five to make some

1398
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:43,500
of those Xbox folks a little bit jealous.

1399
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:45,540
I mean, that's, that's what happens sometimes.

1400
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:47,780
I'm sure Microsoft's done the same thing to them.

1401
01:08:47,780 --> 01:08:49,940
So yeah, it happens.

1402
01:08:49,940 --> 01:08:52,060
So Dr. Sia says, yeah, I agree with Rob.

1403
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:54,020
I'm sure we'll see the next one on PlayStation five.

1404
01:08:54,020 --> 01:08:55,020
Yeah.

1405
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:56,700
I kind of think that's the direction this stuff is headed into.

1406
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:58,380
So we'll see.

1407
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:02,460
Uh, going a little bit to retro game news.

1408
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:06,020
There's this new video that folks have been reporting on.

1409
01:09:06,020 --> 01:09:11,380
Then I saw this, uh, over on Eurogamer ran a story on this whole thing that apparently

1410
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:16,500
they have done an analysis on the old video game street fighter two in the arcades.

1411
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:20,740
And as it turns out, if you felt that the computer was a dirty cheater when playing

1412
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:23,700
street fighter two, it turns out you were right.

1413
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:27,540
The computer does do some things that make it a dirty cheater.

1414
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:32,500
Uh, it was actually desk was the name of the, uh, street fighter player that put out the

1415
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:33,500
video.

1416
01:09:33,500 --> 01:09:38,500
Uh, and it actually does like a frame by frame analysis to see how the computer can actually

1417
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:44,300
turn invisible or invisible, invincible that for a short moment to actually dodge some

1418
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:45,300
attacks basically.

1419
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:51,780
Uh, so the AI of the game will just turn invincible at some points, uh, to help block your tax.

1420
01:09:51,780 --> 01:09:55,420
Uh, also the CPU can break out of dizziness.

1421
01:09:55,420 --> 01:09:57,740
You remember when your character would get dizzy and street fire, you have to like mash

1422
01:09:57,740 --> 01:09:59,140
all the buttons to snap out of it.

1423
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:00,140
Yeah.

1424
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:03,760
The computer just snaps out of it instantly, way faster than you would possibly be able

1425
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:04,760
to do.

1426
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:07,860
Uh, and then let's see, like, uh, the charge moves.

1427
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:10,100
Like let's say you want to do guile's flash kick, right?

1428
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:13,680
And where we had to have charged down and then hit up and kick in order to do the flash

1429
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:14,680
kick.

1430
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:15,680
Well, guess what?

1431
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:16,680
The computer doesn't have to charge.

1432
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:18,380
You can just do those moves whenever they want.

1433
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:25,060
So confirmed street fighter two is a dirty cheater, but here's, here's my kind of counterpoint

1434
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:27,360
to this whole thing.

1435
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:32,220
When you are, well for one counterpoint get good counterpoint one, get good bitch.

1436
01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:37,620
No, uh, is that, uh, one arcade owners can kind of set the difficulty level of these

1437
01:10:37,620 --> 01:10:41,460
machines so they can make, cause you know, some machines were harder than others and

1438
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:42,460
that's why.

1439
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:47,860
But also, um, this is, you know, when you do play on harder modes and video games, street

1440
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:51,140
fighter isn't the only one that cheats.

1441
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:54,300
It's some games will be more transparent about it than others.

1442
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:59,180
For example, let's take a game that's near and dear to my heart civilization, right?

1443
01:10:59,180 --> 01:11:00,700
Or civ six, whatever.

1444
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:02,220
Pick, pick any game in the series.

1445
01:11:02,220 --> 01:11:04,120
They all work the same way.

1446
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:08,000
When you play on the easiest level, something like Chieftain, and this is very transparent

1447
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:13,500
in the game, but when you play on something like Chieftain, you basically are normal and

1448
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:17,780
the computer players get weakened by like 60% or maybe even half.

1449
01:11:17,780 --> 01:11:21,000
I don't remember the exact percentage, but the computer players actually get weakened.

1450
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:25,780
They get multipliers that work against them and actually, uh, being able to like conquer

1451
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:27,380
you and take over your territory.

1452
01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:30,320
So it makes it a lot easier for you to win the game.

1453
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:34,880
Whereas if you play in the hardest mode of the game, guess what?

1454
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:36,160
It's reversed.

1455
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:39,340
Now you get multipliers that work against you.

1456
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:43,780
Whereas the computer is in kind of a, a more standard type of mode.

1457
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:47,300
So in a way, like even though I know we're kind of talking about like, Oh, street fighter

1458
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:50,300
two is a dirty cheater and there's videos and stories all about it.

1459
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:54,580
It's kind of like, I kind of feel in some way, this is just how difficulty works in

1460
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:55,580
video games.

1461
01:11:55,580 --> 01:11:59,700
Sometimes it is some ways that they can do difficulties.

1462
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:04,820
It's hard to program difficulty in, you mean it's usually, you know, one of the easiest

1463
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:09,020
ways to do it is, you know, some sort of multiplier that you can adjust on the fly.

1464
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:13,260
Um, you know, you also have like stuff like Mario Kart where they will try to balance

1465
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:16,580
the game by, you know, the rubber band AI.

1466
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:22,000
So you know, whereas when they're further back, they go faster or they'll get stronger

1467
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,580
power ups in the back.

1468
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:28,540
Great call out on super Mario Kart that especially, especially the original, I mean all the games

1469
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:32,500
have it, but you know, with the super Nintendo library now being on the switch, if you're

1470
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:37,220
a Nintendo online person, go back and play the original Mario Kart because it is very

1471
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:40,100
obvious in that game, very obvious in that game.

1472
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:44,940
And it's not even that they rubber band, it's that the characters will always finish in

1473
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:49,780
a certain order, like always, unless something really extreme happens.

1474
01:12:49,820 --> 01:12:50,320
Yeah.

1475
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:53,660
Like there could be like, Oh, Hey, I just hit Donkey Kong, three different red shells

1476
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:56,660
and yet somehow he's up my ass with yet another red shell.

1477
01:12:56,660 --> 01:12:57,660
Yeah.

1478
01:12:57,660 --> 01:12:58,660
Uh, it's, it's crazy.

1479
01:12:58,660 --> 01:12:59,660
Yeah.

1480
01:12:59,660 --> 01:13:02,060
I would say Mario Kart's the dirtiest cheater game I've ever seen.

1481
01:13:02,060 --> 01:13:05,700
It puts, it puts what we're talking about in street fighter to shame, uh, dark to see

1482
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:09,180
you says, I mean, I think we all kind of suspected, but it's nice.

1483
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:11,380
Someone went to the trouble to try and confirm that.

1484
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:14,640
And I think there's a lot of that kind of playing into the nostalgia of this story going

1485
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:19,420
around the game blogs and Twitter feeds and stuff this week is because it confirms what

1486
01:13:19,460 --> 01:13:22,740
we all knew when we were 12 and now we're in our thirties, right?

1487
01:13:22,740 --> 01:13:26,780
When we were 12, we're like, this game's a fucking cheater that computer, they fucking

1488
01:13:26,780 --> 01:13:27,780
cheated.

1489
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:28,780
No, this stuff.

1490
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:29,780
Right.

1491
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:33,500
And now it's like, well, yes, they, they did in fact cheat and somebody brought the receipts

1492
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:34,500
to prove it.

1493
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:38,620
But, uh, I guess my point is, is that if you amp up the difficulty in video games, they

1494
01:13:38,620 --> 01:13:39,900
all kind of cheat.

1495
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:40,900
And especially, yeah.

1496
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:42,500
In arcades, this is notorious.

1497
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:47,220
Um, let's see, act depth and chat says, isn't the arcade being tougher than they actually

1498
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:50,820
are common knowledge now, uh, especially with ticket spitters.

1499
01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:51,820
Yeah.

1500
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:52,820
Especially depending on the arcade.

1501
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:57,820
Again, there are dip switches, what they're called, but they're basically switches inside

1502
01:13:57,820 --> 01:13:58,820
the game.

1503
01:13:58,820 --> 01:14:02,540
They, cause I think back in the day they really were physical switches, but obviously a lot

1504
01:14:02,540 --> 01:14:06,220
of that went electronic over the years so that when you boot up the game, when you first

1505
01:14:06,220 --> 01:14:09,900
plug it in for the first time, the arcade operator can set what difficulty they want

1506
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:11,100
the game to play on.

1507
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:15,060
So there were some arcades when you would go play something like street fighter and

1508
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:18,100
it, yes, it would be harder than it would be at other arcades.

1509
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:22,980
Um, especially depending on if the arcade operator knew how to set that or not.

1510
01:14:22,980 --> 01:14:23,980
Right.

1511
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:28,140
Cause I'm sure you have some stories from Roosevelt golf land about messing with those

1512
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:29,380
switches in certain games.

1513
01:14:29,380 --> 01:14:34,100
I don't mess with any of that stuff, but like, yeah, I know just from, you know, Mame and

1514
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:41,300
also accessing the operation like menu and stuff in like just my dance house revolution,

1515
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:47,400
you can set the difficulty on that if you want it or like you can, um, I mean, yeah,

1516
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,420
you can do it all, all sorts of stuff with that.

1517
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:53,620
Not even just Mame, but like if you were to play like an arcade collection, like let's

1518
01:14:53,620 --> 01:14:56,900
say you're playing that and this is going to be random, but maybe that collection that

1519
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:59,820
had like magic sword and was it final fight?

1520
01:14:59,820 --> 01:15:00,820
Yeah.

1521
01:15:00,820 --> 01:15:01,820
Yeah.

1522
01:15:01,820 --> 01:15:02,820
It was like, it was an awesome collection.

1523
01:15:02,820 --> 01:15:05,940
It was on Xbox 360 cause I love magic sword, but you can go to the options menu and you

1524
01:15:05,940 --> 01:15:08,380
can set how many points for an extra life.

1525
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:09,940
How many lives do you start with?

1526
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:13,900
Those were all dip switches that the arcade operator could set.

1527
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:18,140
Like at some arcades you would spend a lot more money to beat Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

1528
01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:22,280
from start to finish than you would in others because of the switches.

1529
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:26,660
So anyway, uh, questmaster kind of confirming this in chat saying, yep, arcade operators

1530
01:15:26,660 --> 01:15:27,980
can set difficulty.

1531
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:32,140
How many tokens are needed to continue or even if players are allowed to continue all

1532
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:37,180
the more help to squeeze just a few more quarters from players and dark to see it says that

1533
01:15:37,180 --> 01:15:42,180
beat em up bundle that Capcom did has a lot of those options you can tweak to SSG100 Matt

1534
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:43,300
talking about pinball.

1535
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:49,460
Uh, there were places that raised pinball tables to make the ball fall faster.

1536
01:15:49,460 --> 01:15:50,460
That's right.

1537
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:51,460
Pinball tables.

1538
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:52,960
Some people kind of mess with those as well.

1539
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:56,660
So interesting how those arcades worked at least back in the day.

1540
01:15:56,660 --> 01:16:00,380
You probably see less of it now because no, you see it totally now cause you know what

1541
01:16:00,380 --> 01:16:01,760
those tickets, you're right.

1542
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:04,880
Tickets, spitter, ticket, spitters, all those more traditional games because the ticket

1543
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:09,000
spitter games that you think are skill based where you have to time like, you know, hitting

1544
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,600
a button or something like that.

1545
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:14,320
It's nice how there's artificial random lag in there sometimes.

1546
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:17,440
Funny how that works because it's on purpose.

1547
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:22,960
It's ensure to make sure they don't give the big prize away, but once every like 500 plays

1548
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:27,720
or something like that, whatever it's set to and those crazy, crazy sneaky, sneaky.

1549
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:28,720
All right.

1550
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:29,720
Anyway, let's move on.

1551
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:32,840
Um, some people would say this is sneaky, sneaky, another steam story tonight.

1552
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:33,840
Yeah.

1553
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:37,560
As we were talking about how the previous steam story, whereas if they were going to

1554
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:41,520
allow use game sales that could possibly hurt developers.

1555
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:46,920
Well, here's the real thing that already is hurting developers and that's the redesign

1556
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:50,080
to their discovery system that they have.

1557
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:54,560
So they have that big update where they've changed how, um, stuff is going to come into

1558
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:57,000
your feed, uh, different discovery stuff.

1559
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:02,800
And they found based on like, you know, sales and wishlist ads or whatever and deletions

1560
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:08,480
that the wishlist ads have gone down dramatically since they've implemented that.

1561
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:16,040
So there's a game for a game unbound worlds apart that was showing, you know, the trend

1562
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:24,040
in their steam wishlist ads and how once that, you know, once they September 10th hit, it's

1563
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:26,840
just straight down.

1564
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:28,320
So that is kind of blame.

1565
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:32,560
Um, there's another game, bright red skies, similar type of thing where September 11th

1566
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:37,760
straight down, um, people stopped seeing their game says it was actually performing.

1567
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:45,040
Um, it dropped 66% and all time low yikes months, months of effort ruined in an instant.

1568
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:46,040
I forgot.

1569
01:17:46,040 --> 01:17:50,240
I did notice that the steam store like redid stuff or is that because I'm in the beta?

1570
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:54,280
Like I got that new games library push that shows your games library all differently.

1571
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:55,280
Yeah.

1572
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:58,680
It might be to the beta cause I don't have it yet cause I have the beta version.

1573
01:17:58,680 --> 01:17:59,680
Yeah.

1574
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:02,000
If you're, if you opt into the beta, you can see what it looks like now.

1575
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
So that's interesting.

1576
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,600
I, I honestly didn't spend a lot of time with it.

1577
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:06,600
You know, it's funny.

1578
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:10,160
I was only in there to uninstall games because I was running out of space in my primary drive

1579
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:12,880
and I've been trying to do some more video stuff, wink, wink.

1580
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:17,760
Um, so I need to clear up some space and I was like, why do I have some of these games

1581
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:18,760
installed?

1582
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:19,760
I'm literally never going to play.

1583
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:23,000
So I just had to go through and do uninstall and I was like, Oh, I got the new steam library

1584
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:24,000
at some point.

1585
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,000
Yeah.

1586
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:29,280
So there's a lot of, a lot of different developers reaching out saying that they've kind of seen

1587
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:30,280
similar things.

1588
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:36,720
Um, their wish list has dropped 80%, um, another developer of the platform, a room fencer,

1589
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:43,360
um, Ilia and you know, what's unfortunate cause you know, you want those wish lists

1590
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:48,800
to be on there, especially pre-release of a game because then they're going to get notified

1591
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:52,760
when the game gets released or notified when the game goes on sales and you're trying to

1592
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:56,000
convert those wish lists into actual purchases.

1593
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:01,720
Um, it's kind of like a way to just, you know, help promote your discovery of your game.

1594
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:06,040
But being that they've redesigned how it works, it's fine.

1595
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:12,040
People are having trouble actually discovering those games as if that wasn't a problem before

1596
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:16,520
with so many games out in that platform.

1597
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:18,120
So I don't know what they're going to do.

1598
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:19,760
I guess continue to tweak it.

1599
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:25,800
Um, because it's basically their algorithm, but, um, you know, pays basically, I don't

1600
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:31,040
know, it's maybe over time it'll get better, but I don't know.

1601
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:34,240
It's hard to say steam's running into a lot of problems this week.

1602
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:39,120
I mean, between the, you know, thing going on in France and now this like, you know,

1603
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:43,080
and we were picking on steam a little bit, but, um, you know, maybe this story, not so

1604
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:46,440
much the Epic store, but you know, the, the, yeah, there's not enough on the Epic store

1605
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:47,920
to be able to not find it.

1606
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:48,920
Yeah.

1607
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:51,620
The first thing we were talking about with the France decision, you know, that could

1608
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:53,680
trickle down and affect other stores too.

1609
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:59,280
So a lot of the digital storefronts are having issues this week and you know, and it is interesting

1610
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:03,320
how big changes when it comes to discoverability can really trickle down.

1611
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:06,160
I know YouTube has kind of had a lot with this too, right?

1612
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:11,600
They need some changes, their discoverability algorithm to try to push back on some of the

1613
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:14,060
extremism we'll say that goes on on YouTube.

1614
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:17,000
And it's had this like ripple effect that's affected normal people.

1615
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,000
They have that.

1616
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:23,920
And they also had the thing where they were retooling how that you would, how you would

1617
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:27,920
get the, uh, verified tags on your account.

1618
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:34,860
So they said that that was supposed to combat channels that are impersonating other channels,

1619
01:20:34,860 --> 01:20:37,960
but some of those channels that they were impersonating were verified.

1620
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:39,800
Now they're removing their verification tag.

1621
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:42,280
So how does that help again?

1622
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:44,520
It's just, it's stupid.

1623
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:48,640
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says devil's advocate steam is prioritizing games consumers can

1624
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:53,200
buy today because they can spend their money today.

1625
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:59,760
So steam is doing these today because you're, you're on the store ready to spend money,

1626
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:02,920
but you're not necessarily on the store spending money.

1627
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:06,120
Like I'm signing into steam and I go kind of browse and see what's there.

1628
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:08,160
I'm not like, Oh, I'm going to spend money today.

1629
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:10,160
It's just to see what's out there.

1630
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:14,920
Whereas you know, if this is going to be something that developers are aware of, it's going to

1631
01:21:14,920 --> 01:21:19,720
make them less likely wanting to put their game on steam because they're like, Hey, Hmm,

1632
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:23,800
I could put it on Epic, which, you know, granted people are kind of, it has a stigma right

1633
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:30,000
now because it has less features, but there's less games on there and it's easier to discover

1634
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,000
my game.

1635
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,460
And I get a larger cut than I would with steam.

1636
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:38,720
So it's just another box ticked, I guess in Epic's favor in that sense.

1637
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:44,860
But I just think that there needs to be some ways to be able to discover that stuff.

1638
01:21:44,860 --> 01:21:48,240
Like having some of those pre-release games or something like that, and then maybe their

1639
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:54,800
own section or maybe that, I don't know, you can say, Hey, I'm interested in finding out

1640
01:21:54,800 --> 01:22:00,600
about these types of games and having to show that stuff, maybe cater to what you actually

1641
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:01,600
play.

1642
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,280
I don't know.

1643
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:07,840
Well, let's move on, uh, for time so we can get to the classic game of the week here.

1644
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:12,600
But first we have one more story for this half of the show talking about Xbox game pass

1645
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:16,240
and kind of how it ties into some additional rewards, because I think a lot of you guys

1646
01:22:16,240 --> 01:22:19,640
out there probably heard about the whole, like you can kind of upgrade your regular

1647
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:22,760
Xbox live to the Xbox game passing for like a dollar, right?

1648
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:26,920
So I think a lot of you probably took advantage of that well, because you took advantage of

1649
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:27,920
that.

1650
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:29,160
You have access to this as well.

1651
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:32,080
There is a Microsoft reward point promotion going on right now.

1652
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:37,260
You can earn up to 10,000 reward points for every gamer score point that you get.

1653
01:22:37,260 --> 01:22:39,040
You get one Microsoft for world point.

1654
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:42,260
So yeah, unlocking achievements right now you get reward points.

1655
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:43,260
So that's kind of interesting.

1656
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:44,260
Yeah.

1657
01:22:44,260 --> 01:22:45,260
And there's other weird things.

1658
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:47,900
Well, I should, I shouldn't say weird, but there's other interesting kind of tie-ins

1659
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:48,900
with this too.

1660
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:53,900
Um, let's say like, I guess some of the points depends on what game you play.

1661
01:22:53,900 --> 01:22:57,660
So like devil may cry five, you might get like a hundred points, but achievements in

1662
01:22:57,660 --> 01:23:01,860
middle earth, shadow of war, middle earth, shadow of Mordor, you get 300 points.

1663
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:06,660
But I thought this was interesting too, is that if you play the Blair witch game, cause

1664
01:23:06,660 --> 01:23:08,620
you know, that just came out on game pass, right?

1665
01:23:08,620 --> 01:23:09,620
Yeah.

1666
01:23:09,620 --> 01:23:13,020
If you play that, you get the Blair witch film.

1667
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:18,620
So you can relieve all that or re relieve, relive all that 1999 realness all over again.

1668
01:23:18,620 --> 01:23:20,620
I, it probably doesn't hold up very well.

1669
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:24,060
And a lot of people probably watch that movie and think it's lame, but like, you have to

1670
01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:28,540
remember when that movie first came out, it was, there was nothing like it like ever.

1671
01:23:28,540 --> 01:23:31,500
And that movie literally scared the shit out of so many people.

1672
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:33,740
So, um, interesting.

1673
01:23:33,740 --> 01:23:37,420
But I think that's kind of interesting that Microsoft's, you know, continuing to really

1674
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:42,140
push this game pass thing, you know, 10,000 Microsoft points, I think is the equivalent

1675
01:23:42,140 --> 01:23:43,520
of like 10 bucks.

1676
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:47,700
So it's not like they're giving away the whole farm, but it's something, Hey, it's something

1677
01:23:47,700 --> 01:23:48,700
for nothing.

1678
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:51,880
I mean, are you really doing nothing for game pass?

1679
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:57,420
Probably not, but it's still something a little bit of an added value, so, all right.

1680
01:23:57,420 --> 01:24:00,860
So we are going to go to the classic game of the week.

1681
01:24:00,860 --> 01:24:04,740
And before we jump right into the classic game of the week, I will say that during this

1682
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:08,980
segment, we're actually going to do the whole little Twitch giveaway for those of you that

1683
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:11,000
are watching live tonight.

1684
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:16,920
If you contributed to the Twitch prime loot chest, we are about to give those away.

1685
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:21,740
There are 16 gifts in the chest of the Dauntless gunslinger.

1686
01:24:21,740 --> 01:24:26,140
I don't even know what that is, but it's probably for some, Hey, it's for a game called Dauntless,

1687
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:27,900
apparently something for nothing.

1688
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:28,900
Remember that?

1689
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:34,260
I'm just going to theorize with that many gifts in the pot, probably all of you that

1690
01:24:34,260 --> 01:24:36,860
are not on Twitch prime are about to get one.

1691
01:24:36,860 --> 01:24:40,620
I mean, don't call me on that, but I can see how many people are watching and how many

1692
01:24:40,620 --> 01:24:41,620
people are on prime.

1693
01:24:41,620 --> 01:24:44,880
I'm thinking all of you are about to get a free something, something here.

1694
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:47,180
So please enjoy it.

1695
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:51,520
And thank you to everybody who put something into the gift basket.

1696
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:52,820
We really appreciate it.

1697
01:24:52,820 --> 01:24:53,820
Oh, thank you, Shane.

1698
01:24:53,820 --> 01:24:57,580
Dauntless is like a monster hunter clone, it seems, but I hear it's pretty decent.

1699
01:24:57,580 --> 01:25:01,100
Well, maybe this code will be some incentive to go check it out, which is probably exactly

1700
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:03,300
what they want in giving this away.

1701
01:25:03,300 --> 01:25:06,320
But we're going to check that out while we go to the classic game of the week.

1702
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:11,180
So for the classic game of the week tonight, Dark Sakura, she would usually do the classic

1703
01:25:11,180 --> 01:25:15,120
game of the week, take a step down memory lane and pick a game out of the vault.

1704
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:18,480
But as you guys know, she has the night off while she's resting her voice.

1705
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:22,980
So we've been trying to invite some friends to come on the show and do this segment.

1706
01:25:22,980 --> 01:25:25,980
Like we had what a VG realness was here a few months ago.

1707
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:30,900
The guys from Game Buoy have both been on, uh, what like Shane did one, of course, eating

1708
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:31,900
Pokemon, right?

1709
01:25:31,900 --> 01:25:34,820
But you know, out of all the people like we've had on the show doing the guest segment, you

1710
01:25:34,820 --> 01:25:41,380
know, we like haven't had on who the guy that has us on every single week at the end of

1711
01:25:41,380 --> 01:25:42,640
his show.

1712
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:49,280
So it was probably about fucking time that we asked our pal Bobby Black Wolf to contribute

1713
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:51,220
to this week's classic game of the week.

1714
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:55,480
So after all of these years, Bobby Black Wolf, we're going to throw it over to you.

1715
01:25:55,480 --> 01:26:00,440
Please tell us your selection for this week's classic game of the week.

1716
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:02,720
Hello all our, my name is Bobby Black Wolf.

1717
01:26:02,720 --> 01:26:06,200
I have been doing podcasting for 14 years.

1718
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:11,060
Most of that leading up to all our, and they have never, ever asked me to do the classic

1719
01:26:11,060 --> 01:26:12,060
game of the week.

1720
01:26:12,060 --> 01:26:15,040
Probably because they were scared I was going to do halo, which has already been done as

1721
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:16,040
a class game of the week.

1722
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:21,000
So I think now I actually, it's safe for me to do a classic game of the week.

1723
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,000
I can't do halo.

1724
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,040
It's already been done.

1725
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:28,520
I can't do my little prank to, you know, subvert the rules and put halo in because halo's already

1726
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:29,520
in.

1727
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:30,520
So I'm not going to do that.

1728
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:31,520
So I'm actually going to do something that's more on brand.

1729
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:37,040
I've got my DOS machine from the nineties here running MS-DOS 622.

1730
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:43,640
I've got my Roland MT-32 turned on and hooked up so we can actually see some of these, see

1731
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:48,040
this game and hear the game the way it was supposed to be played and heard.

1732
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:56,120
And I'm looking forward to sharing this game with all of you and giving it the respect

1733
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:59,980
that I believe it deserves here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1734
01:26:59,980 --> 01:27:03,340
So thank you very much for allowing me to do the classic game of the week.

1735
01:27:03,340 --> 01:27:04,340
And that's right.

1736
01:27:04,340 --> 01:27:11,200
It is Jones in the Fast Lane, a 1990 PC title for DOS.

1737
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:14,480
Also came out on CD-ROM in 1992 by Sierra On-Line.

1738
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:15,480
It's a board game.

1739
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:16,960
It's about keeping up with the Joneses.

1740
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:25,120
You want to get your life better in career, education, wealth, or happiness, or one of

1741
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:30,120
them, or all of them, and you're racing against Jones, a little cartoon Jones.

1742
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:31,120
It's a board game.

1743
01:27:31,120 --> 01:27:35,920
You play as a little marble that goes and gets a job and has a life and does some boring

1744
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:45,440
stuff on the weekend and, hang on a second, hang on, I'm getting a text message.

1745
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:50,560
Dear Bobby, Jones in the Fast Lane has already been done as an O.L.R. classic game of the

1746
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:52,680
week.

1747
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:54,680
You cannot repeat.

1748
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:56,680
Oh.

1749
01:27:56,680 --> 01:27:58,680
Okay.

1750
01:27:58,680 --> 01:28:00,680
Um.

1751
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:08,680
I guess we'll have to do something different.

1752
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:11,640
Okay, okay, okay.

1753
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:12,640
So I got it now.

1754
01:28:12,640 --> 01:28:14,800
I checked the wiki.

1755
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:20,760
I am not doing a game that has already been done, so I think we're good, so we're going

1756
01:28:20,760 --> 01:28:23,800
to try game number two.

1757
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:25,520
I'm going to load it up right here.

1758
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:33,320
This was also a game that made a mark on me, and I thought this game, this was the future,

1759
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:37,160
like this was the best graphics was ever going to get.

1760
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:46,680
I thought this was going to be just the pinnacle of graphics and storytelling, and I was wrong

1761
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:50,040
a little bit, but it's by Dynamics.

1762
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:51,040
A subsidiary.

1763
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:52,040
It was part of the Sierra family.

1764
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:53,760
It really was.

1765
01:28:53,760 --> 01:29:01,040
But this game came out on DOS, later on Sega CD actually, and it's one that I really enjoyed.

1766
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:04,520
It's called The Adventures of Willie Beamish.

1767
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:10,840
So it's a point-and-click adventure game about this kid who's going to be an esports superstar.

1768
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:20,440
Now esports wasn't a term back then, but he wanted to be an esports superstar winner.

1769
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:24,920
This was around the same time as the Super Mario Brothers 3 Nintendo Direct, which they

1770
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:27,080
released in theaters, called it The Wizard.

1771
01:29:27,080 --> 01:29:28,760
So it's kind of like that.

1772
01:29:28,760 --> 01:29:35,160
And so Willie Beamish is this kid who wants to be the Nintari champion.

1773
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:38,920
Yes, Nintari is what he plays.

1774
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:45,480
And it was all done with animators, like actual former Disney animators worked on all the

1775
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:51,720
graphics for this game, which is why when this came out in the early 90s, we were like,

1776
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:54,080
wow, this looks like a cartoon.

1777
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:59,880
Now obviously we look at it nowadays, and it doesn't look that much like a cartoon.

1778
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:02,480
It's very pixelated, and we're like, oh, that's nothing.

1779
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:07,240
That's like, you know, we have plug-and-play games that look better than this.

1780
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:15,440
But it really did have, it broke through a lot of stuff on this.

1781
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:24,080
So as we kind of go, as on the video here, we're going through the intro here.

1782
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:25,920
There were a couple of different aspects to this game.

1783
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:30,920
It was a traditional Sierra game, and there were many, many ways to fail.

1784
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:34,240
You could die in so many hilarious ways.

1785
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:38,920
But the game starts out that it's the last day of school at Carbunkle Elementary.

1786
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:42,080
And Principal Frick, these are all stereotypes, by the way.

1787
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:43,960
Everything's stereotypical.

1788
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:47,480
He's addressing the students at a farewell assembly, and he's going, blah, blah, blah,

1789
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:48,480
blah, blah, blah, blah.

1790
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:54,360
And of course, of course, Willy Beamish has a pet frog, because of course every kid in

1791
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:57,680
the 80s, late 80s, had a pet frog.

1792
01:30:57,680 --> 01:31:04,880
And he's asleep in there, and the frog comes out, and he steals the toupee of the principal

1793
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:07,680
and embarrasses him in front of the entire class.

1794
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:08,680
Ha, ha, ha.

1795
01:31:08,680 --> 01:31:09,920
Isn't that funny, ladies and gentlemen?

1796
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:12,240
Well, he goes to detention.

1797
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:14,900
He's after school detention, the last session.

1798
01:31:14,900 --> 01:31:16,800
Of course, he's in there.

1799
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:20,420
And he's dreaming of eSports.

1800
01:31:20,420 --> 01:31:24,200
He's dreaming of being an Evo, except it's called the Nintari Championship.

1801
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:27,420
They're sitting at a computer, but using a joystick.

1802
01:31:27,420 --> 01:31:33,120
And I don't know if he's doing WASD or not, but he's going up against this other kid.

1803
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:35,560
And then he wakes up.

1804
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:41,920
He wakes up from the dream, and his teacher starts asking him questions.

1805
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:47,600
And of course, the teacher is this really old lady, note called Ms. Glass.

1806
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:49,760
No stereotypes whatsoever.

1807
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:55,760
Now, what I'm not showing you right here is the actual voice acting, because in the CD-ROM

1808
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:59,440
version and in the Sega CD version of this game, there is voice acting.

1809
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:04,560
I am playing on the floppy disk version, because it allows Roland MT-32 stuff.

1810
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:08,200
If you have the CD-ROM version, it does not allow you to use the Roland MT-32, so you

1811
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:09,840
don't get the better music.

1812
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:12,680
So this is really the best music, the game here.

1813
01:32:24,680 --> 01:32:31,680
And so you're basically trying to get through and solve puzzles without continually dying.

1814
01:32:31,680 --> 01:32:36,940
And you have a frog, like I said, named Horny, which, by the way, is a banned word on Twitch.

1815
01:32:36,940 --> 01:32:39,480
You need to get moderator approval to say the name of the frog.

1816
01:32:39,480 --> 01:32:42,840
That was fun, because I streamed this entire game on Twitch.

1817
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:47,840
Now one of the other things I do want to point out is that since this was a game of the 90s,

1818
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:49,880
it actually came with stuff in the box.

1819
01:32:49,880 --> 01:32:56,080
So I actually got, and I still have my stickers here, of Willy Horny Leona, who was one of

1820
01:32:56,080 --> 01:33:01,560
the bad guys, and then Monster Squad, which was the game in the bottom right-hand corner.

1821
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:04,660
That was technically the game they were playing.

1822
01:33:04,660 --> 01:33:10,540
And I got a menu from the Pizzeria, which also doubles as the installation instructors

1823
01:33:10,540 --> 01:33:12,380
on the back side of the menu.

1824
01:33:12,380 --> 01:33:19,260
And then also, there was a little notebook, spiral notebook, that it would give you.

1825
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:24,600
That actually, it was top secret notebook, you were supposed to keep out or die, stop

1826
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:26,640
before it's too late, and you go through there.

1827
01:33:26,640 --> 01:33:31,080
And it's basically, it's got little doodles, but it also has newspaper clippings of things

1828
01:33:31,080 --> 01:33:32,200
going on in the town.

1829
01:33:32,200 --> 01:33:36,800
And one of the things that they would do back in this time, and it was kind of copy protection,

1830
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:42,240
kind of not, but they would actually have things, so like in here, there's like an ad

1831
01:33:42,240 --> 01:33:49,400
for a hypnosis course, where you actually need the contents of this ad to actually get

1832
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:50,440
past something.

1833
01:33:50,440 --> 01:33:54,300
You actually need to put someone under hypnosis, and you need to select three words, and the

1834
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:56,660
three words are in this book.

1835
01:33:56,660 --> 01:34:01,120
So that was, that's kind of some of the stuff they did a lot in the late 80s, early 90s,

1836
01:34:01,120 --> 01:34:03,120
especially the early Sierra games.

1837
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:08,040
So I'm going to real quick go through and just show what the gameplay looks like once

1838
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:14,640
I get to the, I'm going to load a game from my Twitch feed.

1839
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:18,920
So I actually played this on Twitch, but this is kind of like, this was in Willy Beamish's

1840
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:24,480
home, so as you click and walk on things, he actually goes through hand-drawn animations,

1841
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:26,800
which was kind of a big deal in the 90s.

1842
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:33,260
And then, you know, you could talk to your dog and stuff.

1843
01:34:33,260 --> 01:34:39,560
But it really looked like a cartoon, and that was what really made us all excited for it

1844
01:34:39,560 --> 01:34:40,560
when it came out.

1845
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:42,720
And the game was okay.

1846
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:45,720
And I mean, it didn't win too many awards, but it was a lot better than a lot of the

1847
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:47,460
other ones.

1848
01:34:47,460 --> 01:34:53,120
And there are some action elements in it as well.

1849
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:57,200
But there is a timer, so if you spend too long going around, you're actually going to

1850
01:34:57,200 --> 01:35:03,220
get in trouble, because this game I loaded, I'm not in bed.

1851
01:35:03,220 --> 01:35:07,600
So if I go all the way to cadet school on that trouble meter, which is a temperature

1852
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:14,240
gauge that basically rises, your mom's temperature rises, then the game ends, and you get sent

1853
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:15,240
to military school.

1854
01:35:15,240 --> 01:35:17,900
So I'm going to go into Willy Beamish's room on this.

1855
01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:23,040
So I'm upstairs in the house, and in his room, there's like, there's the Enterprise, I hang

1856
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:24,720
it on, he's got a lot of planes.

1857
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:27,280
It's a typical kid's room in the late 80s.

1858
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:32,040
Big pirate ship and stuff like that, but he's got a Nintari system, so we're going to play

1859
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:33,700
Nintari instead of going to bed.

1860
01:35:33,700 --> 01:35:34,700
Why not?

1861
01:35:34,700 --> 01:35:38,240
Because this shows the esports of 1989.

1862
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:41,700
So this is the game, they look like Battletoads.

1863
01:35:41,700 --> 01:35:47,320
Like this is Battletoads coming in on the Nintari system, so this is the game that he's

1864
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:48,760
actually playing.

1865
01:35:48,760 --> 01:35:52,000
The actual main characters, it's Monster Squad, they look like Battletoads, and then they

1866
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,540
play Mario Brothers.

1867
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:55,460
This was supposed to be esports.

1868
01:35:55,460 --> 01:35:58,400
This was esports in 1989.

1869
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:01,360
I'm not actually playing it because this is not an action game.

1870
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:07,060
And he's, I'm playing, there's a cupcake, I don't know, I don't get it.

1871
01:36:07,060 --> 01:36:13,440
So now I've practiced, and because I'm supposed to be in bed, well, you know, unfortunately,

1872
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:18,640
mom is now really upset, the temperature gauge has gone all the way up, and so I have just

1873
01:36:18,640 --> 01:36:24,600
lost the game here live on OLR, because I'm now being sent to military school, getting

1874
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:32,380
a buzz cut, and they're all, that was it.

1875
01:36:32,380 --> 01:36:38,440
And that's the end of the game, and that is the end of this classic Game of the Week segment.

1876
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:44,560
Like I said, it was out on PC, it came out for Sega CD as well, with diminished graphics,

1877
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:47,800
but it was an old CD-ROM game from 1993.

1878
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:51,480
The Adventures of Willie Beamish.

1879
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:52,480
Thanks OLR.

1880
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:59,800
Now let's go back to Studio N7 in Sacramento for the rest of the show.

1881
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:03,540
Thank you, Bobby Blackwell, for sharing that with us, that was a great video.

1882
01:37:03,540 --> 01:37:08,380
If you are watching live here at Twitch TV, for the podcast folks, you didn't notice anything

1883
01:37:08,380 --> 01:37:10,920
was wrong at all, because you could hear the segment wonderfully.

1884
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:16,000
Unfortunately for us live here on Sunday night, the video froze at one part, so I had to make

1885
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:21,760
a judgment call on the fly, because I can't actually have a video, I can't play right

1886
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:25,400
from the middle of a video when I'm using OBS and playing a video back.

1887
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:27,920
So I would have had to do the whole thing over again, which just would have been kind

1888
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:28,920
of weird.

1889
01:37:28,920 --> 01:37:31,640
So I did just let it play through for the sake of the podcast.

1890
01:37:31,640 --> 01:37:34,740
So what I'm gonna do for those of you that are watching here at Twitch TV, because Bobby

1891
01:37:34,740 --> 01:37:38,240
did do a great job with that video, so I'm actually like, I'm a little pissed, like why

1892
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:40,720
can't it, why couldn't it do that with one of the B-roll things, where it's like not

1893
01:37:40,720 --> 01:37:41,720
a big deal, right?

1894
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:44,160
But it does it on that video for whatever reason.

1895
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:47,440
I wonder if it was the audio, because it was when the audio kind of spiked, when I, so

1896
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:51,000
I don't know, like now I'm kind of like running through scenarios, why did this happen?

1897
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:55,000
So anyway, for those of you that are watching live, I'll replay that at the end of the show

1898
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:56,920
tonight, so hopefully you can kind of see that.

1899
01:37:56,920 --> 01:38:00,280
And I think Bobby and I are talking behind the scenes, and it sounds like we might put

1900
01:38:00,280 --> 01:38:03,400
it up on your YouTube so you guys can see that, because he did do a really good job

1901
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:07,080
with the segment, and Willy Beamish is, it's a fun game.

1902
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:10,500
That's a game I remember playing too, and I also played the floppy disk version, although

1903
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:15,740
I didn't have one of them fancy rolling cards, I had an AdLib card, which was still pretty

1904
01:38:15,740 --> 01:38:16,740
awesome of the day.

1905
01:38:16,740 --> 01:38:17,740
Did you ever play Willy Beamish?

1906
01:38:17,740 --> 01:38:18,740
No.

1907
01:38:18,740 --> 01:38:19,740
Really?

1908
01:38:19,740 --> 01:38:20,740
I did not.

1909
01:38:20,740 --> 01:38:23,420
It was such a, like, it was a great game, because it felt like-

1910
01:38:23,420 --> 01:38:25,860
I am aware of it, I just don't know.

1911
01:38:25,860 --> 01:38:29,500
The story about, you know, playing the video, it's like you, it's like you're playing

1912
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:30,500
a game about yourself.

1913
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:31,500
Yeah.

1914
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:34,940
And I'm sure that is exactly the way it was designed, was, you know, kind of like what

1915
01:38:34,940 --> 01:38:37,620
they would be like as kids and so forth, so.

1916
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:42,620
Very good pick from Bobby Blackwell, I'm glad he didn't use his valuable segment to, like,

1917
01:38:42,620 --> 01:38:46,220
pull a Halo joke or something, I'm just kidding.

1918
01:38:46,220 --> 01:38:50,380
He did a great job, it took us way too long to work him into that segment, so I'm glad

1919
01:38:50,380 --> 01:38:51,380
it all worked out.

1920
01:38:51,380 --> 01:38:55,100
I just feel really bad that, like, now that he got on the show, his fucking video that

1921
01:38:55,100 --> 01:38:58,300
he worked so hard on froze, but what can you do?

1922
01:38:58,300 --> 01:39:01,500
Live radio, boys and girls, as I always say.

1923
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:07,020
Some other comments in chat, Dr. Sees says, the Jones and the Fast Lane bit had me going.

1924
01:39:07,060 --> 01:39:08,060
Yeah, me too.

1925
01:39:08,060 --> 01:39:12,260
I told him he could, I said, if you want to redo it, you can redo it, but I also said,

1926
01:39:12,260 --> 01:39:15,580
you could also use this opportunity to pick a game that we're probably never going to

1927
01:39:15,580 --> 01:39:18,820
pick otherwise, and so I think he did do the smart thing there.

1928
01:39:18,820 --> 01:39:23,020
At least, at least Jones and the Fast Game is, Jones and the Fast Lane is in the list.

1929
01:39:23,020 --> 01:39:25,500
Willie Beamish now is too, thanks to Bobby.

1930
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:29,980
As Joe and Hunter Matt says, I played it on Sega CD, I rented it because I couldn't rent

1931
01:39:29,980 --> 01:39:32,500
the Jurassic Park Sega CD game.

1932
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:36,860
I totally forgot there was a Jurassic Park Sega CD game, that's awesome.

1933
01:39:37,180 --> 01:39:39,660
All right, well, let's get back into some news.

1934
01:39:39,660 --> 01:39:43,900
We're going to travel around and check out some news real quickly here in this rapid

1935
01:39:43,900 --> 01:39:44,900
fire news segment.

1936
01:39:44,900 --> 01:39:49,660
This is going to be like the third week we're talking about the Neo Geo arcade stick, and

1937
01:39:49,660 --> 01:39:53,820
ironically enough, the joke that was made last week when we talked about, oh, what games

1938
01:39:53,820 --> 01:39:54,820
are going to be?

1939
01:39:54,820 --> 01:39:59,820
Was it all the King of Fighters and all the samurai showdowns and world hero games?

1940
01:39:59,820 --> 01:40:01,540
Yeah, that's exactly what it is.

1941
01:40:01,540 --> 01:40:03,700
So they announced the 20 games that are in there.

1942
01:40:03,700 --> 01:40:08,420
So the King of Fighters, 95, 97, 98, 99, 2000, 2002.

1943
01:40:08,420 --> 01:40:15,500
Fatal Fury Special, Fatal Fury 3, Garo, Mark of Wolves, Samurai Shodown 2, 3, 4, 5, The

1944
01:40:15,500 --> 01:40:21,940
Art of Fighting, World Heroes 2, World Heroes 2 Jet, World Heroes Perfect, Ninja Masters,

1945
01:40:21,940 --> 01:40:25,820
The Last Blade 2, and Kizuna Encounter.

1946
01:40:25,820 --> 01:40:31,020
And those are your games that are going to be a part of that fighting stick that is not

1947
01:40:31,020 --> 01:40:34,140
only a fighting stick for PC, but it also plugs into your TV.

1948
01:40:34,140 --> 01:40:38,940
The fact that it also works on PC is pretty rad, actually.

1949
01:40:38,940 --> 01:40:41,420
So like, I don't know, I'm on the fence.

1950
01:40:41,420 --> 01:40:43,420
It's probably too much money.

1951
01:40:43,420 --> 01:40:48,540
Yeah, I don't remember how much it costs, but I don't need a fighting stick.

1952
01:40:48,540 --> 01:40:49,780
I don't need one that bad.

1953
01:40:49,780 --> 01:40:50,780
So, alright.

1954
01:40:50,780 --> 01:40:56,900
And then, well this is kind of funny, there is a patch to Borderlands 3 that apparently

1955
01:40:56,900 --> 01:41:06,860
there was a problem where I guess one of the bosses in the game had some incessant screaming

1956
01:41:06,860 --> 01:41:11,260
that was patched out now because apparently there was too much.

1957
01:41:11,260 --> 01:41:17,060
And apparently, I don't know, so they had actually gone through the game.

1958
01:41:17,060 --> 01:41:24,780
I don't want to actually spoil too much here, but apparently towards the end of the game

1959
01:41:24,780 --> 01:41:32,500
one of the bosses, I guess, takes some damage and starts screaming and it's just, you know,

1960
01:41:32,500 --> 01:41:37,300
apparently it just keeps on going and so they wanted to fix some other stuff that was in

1961
01:41:37,300 --> 01:41:42,780
the game and with that they removed the pain sounds from Troy for his last boss fight because

1962
01:41:42,780 --> 01:41:45,100
apparently it was very unpleasant.

1963
01:41:45,100 --> 01:41:51,300
Well, I mean, if it was to the point where it was annoying, I can see, I mean I haven't

1964
01:41:51,300 --> 01:41:56,620
played this game yet, so, although I've been making my way through the first Borderlands

1965
01:41:56,620 --> 01:42:01,740
game, but it's just, of course, I put that down when all this other stuff came up, right?

1966
01:42:01,740 --> 01:42:04,340
But I'm sure a lot of people were very annoyed by that.

1967
01:42:04,340 --> 01:42:06,540
Anybody in chat, did you get this far in Borderlands 3?

1968
01:42:06,540 --> 01:42:09,060
At the very end, so it's like the last boss fight.

1969
01:42:09,060 --> 01:42:11,660
Probably nobody in our chat even was that far.

1970
01:42:11,660 --> 01:42:17,020
Apparently, I guess, if you do any sort of stats effect on him, he just screams constantly,

1971
01:42:17,020 --> 01:42:19,180
so that's actually kind of funny.

1972
01:42:19,180 --> 01:42:24,340
I kind of wish they didn't patch it out, but what are you going to do?

1973
01:42:24,340 --> 01:42:25,340
Yeah.

1974
01:42:25,340 --> 01:42:26,340
All right.

1975
01:42:26,340 --> 01:42:28,620
Well, moving on to some other stories.

1976
01:42:28,620 --> 01:42:33,340
This one is about some trademarks by Bandai Namco, which Jason referenced at the top of

1977
01:42:33,340 --> 01:42:35,220
the show tonight in the intro.

1978
01:42:35,220 --> 01:42:36,780
I think this is really cool.

1979
01:42:36,780 --> 01:42:37,780
So here's the thing.

1980
01:42:37,780 --> 01:42:44,260
Some new trademarks were filed with some games in the Encore series for Bandai Namco.

1981
01:42:44,260 --> 01:42:48,980
This is important because Bandai Namco already did this for a game in Japan.

1982
01:42:48,980 --> 01:42:51,500
It was called Katamari Damacy Encore.

1983
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:55,460
It doesn't sound as familiar here to us because when they released it here, it was Katamari

1984
01:42:55,460 --> 01:42:57,660
Damacy Reroll.

1985
01:42:57,660 --> 01:43:01,740
There was also a puzzle game on the Nintendo Switch that was based on a Wii release.

1986
01:43:01,740 --> 01:43:07,180
I don't think we had it here called Kotoba No Puzzle Moji Pitan Encore.

1987
01:43:07,180 --> 01:43:10,940
So this Encore thing is something Bandai Namco has been doing.

1988
01:43:10,940 --> 01:43:11,940
Guess what?

1989
01:43:11,940 --> 01:43:15,100
There's more games apparently coming, thanks to these trademark filings.

1990
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:22,580
Mr. Driller, Klonoa, which I know will have people very excited, Splatterhouse.

1991
01:43:22,580 --> 01:43:25,900
So that is all in a report that ran in Gamatsu.

1992
01:43:25,900 --> 01:43:30,220
Apparently Mr. Driller W was specifically the game there in the Encore line.

1993
01:43:30,220 --> 01:43:32,700
That was originally a WiiWare exclusive.

1994
01:43:32,700 --> 01:43:42,760
And apparently Klonoa's 2009 remake, Door to Phantomile is going to be the other game

1995
01:43:42,760 --> 01:43:46,280
potentially there in the Encore series.

1996
01:43:46,280 --> 01:43:48,440
So that's kind of neat.

1997
01:43:48,440 --> 01:43:49,820
We don't know about Splatterhouse.

1998
01:43:49,820 --> 01:43:54,680
It could be the 2010 reboot that was on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360.

1999
01:43:54,680 --> 01:43:56,380
Could be maybe the arcade version.

2000
01:43:56,380 --> 01:43:57,380
Don't know.

2001
01:43:57,380 --> 01:43:59,520
Hard to say at this point.

2002
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:05,080
I think it should just be a blend of both Splatterhouse and Katamari where you're just

2003
01:44:05,080 --> 01:44:08,000
crushing things in violent gore.

2004
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:14,000
All right, let's talk about that game Control that came out that I really want to play.

2005
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:17,880
But Epic Games paid to have the exclusive rights on their store.

2006
01:44:17,880 --> 01:44:20,820
I just saw this one in Discord as well.

2007
01:44:20,820 --> 01:44:27,160
They paid about 9.49 million euros, which I think in Discord they had the American number

2008
01:44:27,160 --> 01:44:34,000
of about 10.5 US dollars, I think, to actually get the PC exclusive rights to Control.

2009
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:38,640
This was paid out to Digital Brothers, which is the parent company, to 505 Games.

2010
01:44:38,640 --> 01:44:43,680
According to a recent financial report, that's how they were able to find out that number

2011
01:44:43,680 --> 01:44:46,960
because when you're a traded company, you have to publish reports to talk about your

2012
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:47,960
income.

2013
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:51,000
It just happened to be the timing of everything because the game hadn't released yet, but

2014
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,320
they had the report earnings from it.

2015
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:56,160
And so they're like, where did those earnings come from?

2016
01:44:56,160 --> 01:44:59,920
Oh, it was from the exclusivity deal.

2017
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:01,360
Clever.

2018
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:02,360
Very clever.

2019
01:45:02,440 --> 01:45:05,920
Now we know about how much Epic is willing to pony up for exclusive games.

2020
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:07,440
That's a nice chunk of change.

2021
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:11,440
Hey, Epic, I'm working on a game willing to make it exclusive.

2022
01:45:11,440 --> 01:45:15,680
You have to throw me some people really waiting to play this, too.

2023
01:45:15,680 --> 01:45:19,200
I'll take like a tenth of that.

2024
01:45:19,200 --> 01:45:20,200
You can lowball me.

2025
01:45:20,200 --> 01:45:21,200
It's fine.

2026
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:22,200
Reach for the sky.

2027
01:45:22,200 --> 01:45:23,200
All right.

2028
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:27,000
Let's travel around and check out what's coming out in stores this week as we check out world

2029
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:28,000
release dates.

2030
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:29,000
All right.

2031
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:33,480
Baldur's Gate enhanced edition on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2032
01:45:33,480 --> 01:45:38,640

2033
01:45:38,640 --> 01:45:42,880

2034
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:43,880
Xbox One.

2035
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:45,440
And I swear that's the last Baldur's Gate.

2036
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:51,320
Oh, well, maybe not actually, because then we get down to Icewind Dale enhanced edition.

2037
01:45:51,320 --> 01:45:53,920
That's the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2038
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:58,640
Landscape Torment enhanced edition on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2039
01:45:58,640 --> 01:45:59,640
All right.

2040
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:01,600
I think we're good there.

2041
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:07,960
Contra Rogue Corps on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2042
01:46:07,960 --> 01:46:12,680
The Surge 2 on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2043
01:46:12,680 --> 01:46:17,520
Mario Kart Tour coming out of beta on iOS and Android this week.

2044
01:46:17,520 --> 01:46:21,920
Darksiders 2 definitive edition on Nintendo Switch.

2045
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:25,360
I'm wearing a Mario Kart shirt, so I'll show that off.

2046
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:33,720
Gunvolt Chronicles Luminous Avenger that's coming out on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation

2047
01:46:33,720 --> 01:46:35,680
4 and Xbox One.

2048
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:40,880
Ys IX on Monstrum Nox on PlayStation 4.

2049
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:44,560

Dragon Quest, Dragon Quest II, Dragon Quest III and Dragon Quest XI S on Nintendo Switch

2051
01:46:50,560 --> 01:46:51,560
this week.

01:46:51,560 --> 01:46:56,600
FIFA 20 on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2053
01:46:56,600 --> 01:47:02,080

2054
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:04,800
Ori and the Blind Forest on Nintendo Switch.

2055
01:47:04,800 --> 01:47:08,400
And last but not least, Tropico 6 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2056
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:09,400
That's it.

2057
01:47:09,400 --> 01:47:10,400
Nice.

2058
01:47:10,400 --> 01:47:11,400
All right.

2059
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:13,680
Traveling over to Japan and looking at the releases there.

2060
01:47:13,680 --> 01:47:17,880
They're also getting Ys IX this week, which is probably the biggest deal in the list.

2061
01:47:17,880 --> 01:47:18,880
But Ys IX.

2062
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:22,960
Some of you think it might be Ys, because it's Y-S, but it's Ys.

2063
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:27,280
So Ys IX, Monstrum Nox is out in Japan this week on the 26th.

2064
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:30,700
There's an Atelier game out this week too, Atelier Ryza, Ever Darkness and the Secret

2065
01:47:30,700 --> 01:47:31,700
Hideout.

2066
01:47:31,700 --> 01:47:35,680
That's an irregular premium and special collector's box, because they love the collectibles over

2067
01:47:35,680 --> 01:47:37,040
there in Japan.

2068
01:47:37,040 --> 01:47:41,920
Gunvolt Chronicles Luminous Avenger IX also out in Japan this week.

2069
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:45,640
MotoGP 19 gets a Japanese release this week as well.

2070
01:47:45,640 --> 01:47:48,080
And oh, there's a limited edition for Ys IX as well.

2071
01:47:48,080 --> 01:47:49,960
I didn't notice that at first.

2072
01:47:49,960 --> 01:47:53,280
There's also Contra Rogue Core is out in Japan this week.

2073
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:56,840
MelKiss and I'm sorry, I love the name of this game.

2074
01:47:56,840 --> 01:47:57,840
You ready?

2075
01:47:57,840 --> 01:47:59,300
AmazingGrace.

2076
01:47:59,300 --> 01:48:02,400
What color is your attribute?

2077
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:04,040
That's the name of the game, Loki.

2078
01:48:04,040 --> 01:48:05,120
AmazingGrace.

2079
01:48:05,120 --> 01:48:07,160
What color is your attribute?

2080
01:48:07,160 --> 01:48:08,160
What would you say?

2081
01:48:08,160 --> 01:48:10,520
What would you say is what color is your attribute, Loki?

2082
01:48:10,520 --> 01:48:11,520
I don't know.

2083
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:12,520
What is that?

2084
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:13,520
Some sort of slang?

2085
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:14,520
Is that like...

2086
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:15,520
I don't know.

2087
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:23,920
Does your attribute match the drapes?

2088
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:27,120
Loki's jokes have officially killed me.

2089
01:48:27,120 --> 01:48:30,480
All right, anyway.

2090
01:48:30,480 --> 01:48:33,920
Judging from the box art for this game, I would think maybe it's pink, because they're

2091
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:35,960
all wearing little like...

2092
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:40,980
It's for anime girls, of course, all wearing these like pink suits on the cover of the

2093
01:48:40,980 --> 01:48:41,980
game.

2094
01:48:41,980 --> 01:48:42,980
And I don't know.

2095
01:48:43,220 --> 01:48:45,340
Do you want to hear the description of AmazingGrace?

2096
01:48:45,340 --> 01:48:46,660
What color is your attribute?

2097
01:48:46,660 --> 01:48:47,660
Yes.

2098
01:48:47,660 --> 01:48:51,840
Shu woke up in a snowy town with no recollection of his past.

2099
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:55,900
He thought it was a strange place with an antique feel of Europe in the Middle Ages

2100
01:48:55,900 --> 01:48:58,220
and a deep appreciation of the arts.

2101
01:48:58,220 --> 01:49:02,960
There was also a towering wall known as Aurora, which surrounded by the town and sealed it

2102
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:04,100
off from the outside.

2103
01:49:04,100 --> 01:49:09,540
However, he was taken in by the townspeople and eventually attended St. Alia Academy and

2104
01:49:09,540 --> 01:49:12,060
enjoyed his time with the other students there.

2105
01:49:12,060 --> 01:49:17,740
However, this newfound happiness was snatched in an instant when a mysterious fire destroyed

2106
01:49:17,740 --> 01:49:19,260
the town on Christmas Day.

2107
01:49:19,260 --> 01:49:22,340
Well, that's a fucking bummer, isn't it?

2108
01:49:22,340 --> 01:49:26,420
Yune loved the town more than anyone and vowed from the bottom of her heart to change the

2109
01:49:26,420 --> 01:49:31,340
town's fate, turning back time to December the 2nd, the first day of Advent.

2110
01:49:31,340 --> 01:49:33,420
Why did the disaster occur?

2111
01:49:33,420 --> 01:49:37,620
Why did the town's fate remain unchanged no matter how many times they turned back time?

2112
01:49:37,620 --> 01:49:41,980
Why were they able to turn back time in the first place?

2113
01:49:41,980 --> 01:49:45,860
That description literally has nothing to do with the fucking title.

2114
01:49:45,860 --> 01:49:47,060
What color is your attribute?

2115
01:49:47,060 --> 01:49:48,600
The color of fire.

2116
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:53,180
And we have to stop it, I guess, is what's going on there.

2117
01:49:53,180 --> 01:49:57,140
If I could turn back time.

2118
01:49:57,140 --> 01:50:02,340
I'm sorry I asked.

2119
01:50:02,340 --> 01:50:05,780
Going to the Nintendo Switch and checking out the releases there.

2120
01:50:05,780 --> 01:50:12,980
Ninja Box is out this week, as well as Hakuyoki Shinkai is out this week, as well as Atley

2121
01:50:12,980 --> 01:50:17,880
Arisa is also released there, and Gunvolt Chronicles Luminous Avenger.

2122
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:24,260
There's also a game called Disaster Report 4 Plus Summer Memories for the Nintendo Switch

2123
01:50:24,260 --> 01:50:26,700
is also out this week.

2124
01:50:26,700 --> 01:50:29,580
I want to say, I think that was on the Wii at one point.

2125
01:50:29,580 --> 01:50:31,940
I had like the Disaster Report series.

2126
01:50:31,940 --> 01:50:36,120
It does, because it is a plus game, so it wouldn't surprise me if it's like a reimagining

2127
01:50:36,120 --> 01:50:37,120
of that series.

2128
01:50:37,120 --> 01:50:38,260
I don't know.

2129
01:50:38,260 --> 01:50:43,180
But anyhow, let's go over to Europe and see what the release dates are out there.

2130
01:50:43,180 --> 01:50:52,480
Alright, so in Europe we've got a few things, starting off with Songbird Symphony.

2131
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:54,820
Let's see here.

2132
01:50:54,820 --> 01:50:57,380
Why did they not seem to know what the date is?

2133
01:50:57,380 --> 01:50:58,860
Oh, here we go.

2134
01:50:58,860 --> 01:51:04,220
Contra Rogue Corps, that's coming out on PlayStation 4 and the Nintendo Switch.

2135
01:51:04,220 --> 01:51:08,340
The Surge 2 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2136
01:51:08,340 --> 01:51:13,740
We have FIFA 20, that's coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2137
01:51:13,740 --> 01:51:17,900
Dead by Daylight on the Nintendo Switch.

2138
01:51:17,900 --> 01:51:22,300
Darksiders II Definitive Edition, that's on the Switch.

2139
01:51:22,300 --> 01:51:25,660
Telsiligrad, that's on the Switch.

2140
01:51:25,660 --> 01:51:30,700
Dragon Quest XI Echoes of an Elusive Age on Nintendo Switch.

2141
01:51:30,700 --> 01:51:35,820
FIFA 20, oh I said that again, but I guess they have a collector's edition coming out

2142
01:51:35,820 --> 01:51:36,820
as well.

2143
01:51:36,820 --> 01:51:42,740
Yes, the, what was it, the Definitive Edition or Champion's Edition.

2144
01:51:42,740 --> 01:51:48,180
You know, more of the, what was it, Ultimate Team Card Packs Edition is what they really

2145
01:51:48,180 --> 01:51:49,180
should call it.

2146
01:51:50,060 --> 01:51:55,420
And then Tropico 6, we've got that coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2147
01:51:55,420 --> 01:51:59,420
Code Vein on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2148
01:51:59,420 --> 01:52:01,700
And that is it.

2149
01:52:01,700 --> 01:52:04,060
All right.

2150
01:52:04,060 --> 01:52:05,500
Let's go to the mailbag.

2151
01:52:05,500 --> 01:52:07,860
Every week we invite your emails.

2152
01:52:07,860 --> 01:52:12,020
Participate at Orangeloungeradio.com is the place to send your emails.

2153
01:52:12,020 --> 01:52:15,900
And we dive into the mailbag and read your emails here on the program.

2154
01:52:15,900 --> 01:52:19,460
DarkSakura usually reads these emails, but since she isn't here specifically for the

2155
01:52:19,460 --> 01:52:23,700
purpose of saving her voice, I suppose I will have to read them instead.

2156
01:52:23,700 --> 01:52:28,700
So we have two emails in the mailbag this week, but this first one, Loki, uh oh, I think

2157
01:52:28,700 --> 01:52:33,900
this is from the, uh, Wasterbaiting account again, because the first one is from The Virus

2158
01:52:33,900 --> 01:52:34,900
Developer.

2159
01:52:34,900 --> 01:52:35,900
Oh my gosh.

2160
01:52:35,900 --> 01:52:40,220
And the subject is, my virus recorded you masturbating.

2161
01:52:40,220 --> 01:52:41,580
No.

2162
01:52:41,580 --> 01:52:43,620
I feel- Again?

2163
01:52:43,620 --> 01:52:48,860
I feel sorry for your virus because nobody should have to be subjected to that.

2164
01:52:48,860 --> 01:52:49,860
I'm trying to see what's actually-

2165
01:52:49,860 --> 01:52:53,500
Like I'm seeking damages for you and harming my virus.

2166
01:52:53,500 --> 01:52:57,180
Recently you visited one of the porn websites I attacked with my ex-plate.

2167
01:52:57,180 --> 01:52:58,180
Oh my God.

2168
01:52:58,180 --> 01:53:01,060
This, okay, this gets really serious.

2169
01:53:01,060 --> 01:53:05,460
Like I, I wouldn't usually give spam emails the time of day.

2170
01:53:05,460 --> 01:53:06,460
It's Worldcraft.

2171
01:53:06,460 --> 01:53:09,340
There's, there's a tone in this email.

2172
01:53:09,340 --> 01:53:10,340
World building is-

2173
01:53:10,340 --> 01:53:11,700
No, wait, wait, here we go.

2174
01:53:11,700 --> 01:53:15,020
So when you started watching videos, it executed payload on your device.

2175
01:53:15,020 --> 01:53:17,480
So that's what you get for not sticking with the payload.

2176
01:53:17,480 --> 01:53:19,820
Now it's on your device.

2177
01:53:19,820 --> 01:53:23,740
As soon as I infected your device, it started to act like a remote desktop with full read-write

2178
01:53:23,740 --> 01:53:24,740
access.

2179
01:53:24,740 --> 01:53:29,340
Uh, your camera, my virus started recording your web browser and your camera every time

2180
01:53:29,340 --> 01:53:31,980
you masturbated during the last two weeks.

2181
01:53:31,980 --> 01:53:37,060
While my virus is not perfect.

2182
01:53:37,060 --> 01:53:38,320
How humble they are.

2183
01:53:38,320 --> 01:53:40,740
What a humble, what a humble virus.

2184
01:53:40,740 --> 01:53:48,340
While my virus is not perfect, it managed to record six videos clearly showing you masturbating.

2185
01:53:48,340 --> 01:53:54,700
Call me whatever you want, a criminal or a dick, but this is just my job.

2186
01:53:54,700 --> 01:53:55,860
It's it's-

2187
01:53:55,860 --> 01:53:59,580
I'm employed to make viruses that watch you masturbate.

2188
01:53:59,580 --> 01:54:00,580
That's-

2189
01:54:00,580 --> 01:54:06,180
Oh God, we got Rob masturbating on video again.

2190
01:54:06,180 --> 01:54:07,660
Well, it's a living.

2191
01:54:07,660 --> 01:54:10,420
Yours is waster baiting in and out.

2192
01:54:10,420 --> 01:54:11,420
Okay.

2193
01:54:11,420 --> 01:54:12,420
Yeah.

2194
01:54:12,420 --> 01:54:15,900
SSG100 Matt says this storyline sounds better than what colors your attribute.

2195
01:54:15,900 --> 01:54:17,860
Wait folks, it gets better.

2196
01:54:17,860 --> 01:54:21,100
I'm just, I'm just reading an email in the box cause this shit gets crazy.

2197
01:54:21,100 --> 01:54:22,100
You ready?

2198
01:54:22,100 --> 01:54:24,700
Uh, call me what you want, a criminal or a dick, but this is just my job.

2199
01:54:24,700 --> 01:54:31,380
I do this on a regular basis and I recorded hundreds of people, but you are special in

2200
01:54:31,380 --> 01:54:33,740
all caps.

2201
01:54:33,740 --> 01:54:35,420
You're special.

2202
01:54:35,420 --> 01:54:36,620
Why?

2203
01:54:36,620 --> 01:54:41,660
Because of the apparent and perverse videos you were watching while masturbating.

2204
01:54:41,660 --> 01:54:43,060
You know what I mean?

2205
01:54:43,060 --> 01:54:47,620
Now I am your master and you are my slave.

2206
01:54:47,620 --> 01:54:49,420
This is just taking over.

2207
01:54:49,420 --> 01:54:54,060
I did not consent to this role play virus, master Jesus.

2208
01:54:54,060 --> 01:54:55,060
All right.

2209
01:54:55,060 --> 01:54:56,060
Thank you.

2210
01:54:56,060 --> 01:54:57,060
Oh yeah.

2211
01:54:57,060 --> 01:55:03,740
I'm so happy we get raided by another esteemed podcast network while I'm in the middle of

2212
01:55:03,740 --> 01:55:10,660
reading the spam email we got to our box that is threatening to spread our masturbating

2213
01:55:10,660 --> 01:55:12,060
videos all over the internet.

2214
01:55:12,060 --> 01:55:21,660
So come on, come on in, pull up a chair or as our emailer said, now I am your master.

2215
01:55:21,660 --> 01:55:22,740
Let's see where were we at?

2216
01:55:22,740 --> 01:55:24,300
Oh, let me ask you a question.

2217
01:55:24,300 --> 01:55:25,900
The email continues.

2218
01:55:25,900 --> 01:55:30,860
How would you feel if I uploaded a porn hub, all the videos with you masturbating and send

2219
01:55:30,860 --> 01:55:36,300
the links to everyone on your contact list, including your family and business partners?

2220
01:55:36,300 --> 01:55:37,860
You don't want me to do this, right?

2221
01:55:37,860 --> 01:55:41,900
There is only one way you can stop me from exposing your fantasies.

2222
01:55:41,900 --> 01:55:45,700
I talk about my fantasies very openly.

2223
01:55:45,700 --> 01:55:46,700
You're on this program.

2224
01:55:46,700 --> 01:55:47,700
Subscribe to PewDiePie.

2225
01:55:47,700 --> 01:55:48,700
Ryan Reynolds.

2226
01:55:48,700 --> 01:55:51,140
And actually we were not going to talk about that.

2227
01:55:51,140 --> 01:55:52,740
Anyway, moving on.

2228
01:55:52,740 --> 01:55:53,960
You have to pay.

2229
01:55:53,960 --> 01:55:55,840
Let me be straightforward with you.

2230
01:55:55,840 --> 01:55:57,580
You know what Bitcoin is, right?

2231
01:55:57,580 --> 01:56:03,820
Buy $2,000 worth of Bitcoin and send to me immediately.

2232
01:56:03,820 --> 01:56:07,120
You can buy Bitcoin in many places like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, I'm not going to read

2233
01:56:07,120 --> 01:56:08,120
these websites.

2234
01:56:08,120 --> 01:56:12,900
I'm giving you three days to complete this payment after which I will start uploading

2235
01:56:12,900 --> 01:56:15,140
and sending your masturbation videos.

2236
01:56:15,140 --> 01:56:18,580
Just imagine your family and colleagues reaction to these videos.

2237
01:56:18,580 --> 01:56:25,620
Save your life now.

2238
01:56:25,620 --> 01:56:26,940
I have three days, huh?

2239
01:56:27,300 --> 01:56:28,300
Well, guess what, y'all?

2240
01:56:28,300 --> 01:56:31,420
That email was sent on Monday.

2241
01:56:31,420 --> 01:56:33,340
Have fun on Pornhub.

2242
01:56:33,340 --> 01:56:34,340
Sick bucks.

2243
01:56:34,340 --> 01:56:35,340
All right.

2244
01:56:35,340 --> 01:56:36,340
Let's get to the real email.

2245
01:56:36,340 --> 01:56:40,020
By the way, welcome to all the new viewers here at Orange Town Studio.

2246
01:56:40,020 --> 01:56:41,460
We're a video game podcast.

2247
01:56:41,460 --> 01:56:42,460
Did you know that?

2248
01:56:42,460 --> 01:56:44,880
We talk about video games once in a while.

2249
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:50,020
But then once in this blue moon, we get like the crazy masturbating email spammer thing

2250
01:56:50,020 --> 01:56:51,020
here.

2251
01:56:51,020 --> 01:56:52,020
All right.

2252
01:56:52,020 --> 01:56:55,780
Anyway, moving on.

2253
01:56:55,780 --> 01:56:58,540
I'm loving all the comments we're getting.

2254
01:56:58,540 --> 01:57:03,660
Havoc978 says, this is literally more detailed than any versions of the email I've gotten.

2255
01:57:03,660 --> 01:57:05,180
That's why I had to read it.

2256
01:57:05,180 --> 01:57:09,020
It was much more like the urgency and the tone in that email.

2257
01:57:09,020 --> 01:57:12,780
I was like, I have to like, this person has a message.

2258
01:57:12,780 --> 01:57:14,820
It's their job, Loki.

2259
01:57:14,820 --> 01:57:15,820
It's my job.

2260
01:57:15,820 --> 01:57:17,180
It's a living.

2261
01:57:17,180 --> 01:57:23,100
I've recorded hundreds of people, but you, you're special.

2262
01:57:23,100 --> 01:57:26,100
WBin26 in chat says, spam them back.

2263
01:57:26,100 --> 01:57:30,200
I just, I feel like you don't want to let them know that somebody's actually reading

2264
01:57:30,200 --> 01:57:34,820
the emails live on the internet to a captive audience of dozens of people, because then

2265
01:57:34,820 --> 01:57:36,400
they'll just invite to send me more.

2266
01:57:36,400 --> 01:57:38,780
So I don't really want to do that.

2267
01:57:38,780 --> 01:57:40,780
Pesalpaca says, that was beautiful.

2268
01:57:40,780 --> 01:57:41,780
Thank you.

2269
01:57:41,780 --> 01:57:48,140
Nicole0991 says, as a girl, I'm amused by the amount of these kinds of emails I've received.

2270
01:57:48,140 --> 01:57:51,100
Will you notice the tone in that email had no gender?

2271
01:57:51,100 --> 01:57:54,700
You know, gender is merely a suggestion in the year 2019.

2272
01:57:54,700 --> 01:58:01,020
So the virus developer whose virus will record you masturbating cares not of what parts you're

2273
01:58:01,020 --> 01:58:02,720
using to masturbate.

2274
01:58:02,720 --> 01:58:05,580
They just want you to know it's their job.

2275
01:58:05,580 --> 01:58:06,580
And that you're special.

2276
01:58:06,580 --> 01:58:07,580
And that you're special.

2277
01:58:07,580 --> 01:58:08,580
All right.

2278
01:58:08,580 --> 01:58:11,740
Anyway, can we get to the real email?

2279
01:58:11,740 --> 01:58:17,580
I guess now everybody in chat is like, all right, we have to talk about games.

2280
01:58:17,580 --> 01:58:19,060
Pretty high bar you have to live up to.

2281
01:58:19,060 --> 01:58:20,060
All right.

2282
01:58:20,060 --> 01:58:21,060
Well, luckily it's Flaco Jones.

2283
01:58:21,060 --> 01:58:22,060
Okay.

2284
01:58:22,060 --> 01:58:27,140
And if anybody can follow up the virus master or whatever his name was, the Flaco Jones,

2285
01:58:27,140 --> 01:58:28,140
I'm sure, sure can.

2286
01:58:28,140 --> 01:58:29,140
So here we go.

2287
01:58:29,140 --> 01:58:34,460
Hey, OLR, a couple of weeks ago, you mentioned a story about Konami bringing back globally

2288
01:58:34,460 --> 01:58:39,020
known IPs and went on to discuss whether that could mean a new Metal Gear game or something

2289
01:58:39,020 --> 01:58:40,780
big along those lines.

2290
01:58:40,780 --> 01:58:44,480
Well fast forward to the Apple keynote from last week when they brought a rep from Konami

2291
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:49,100
on stage and what did they announce but a new Frogger game exclusive to the Apple Arcade

2292
01:58:49,100 --> 01:58:53,140
service joy.

2293
01:58:53,140 --> 01:58:57,380
I about died laughing in part because I thought of your discussion on the show the previous

2294
01:58:57,380 --> 01:59:03,700
week where we were sitting here, you know, that's, that's what the virus guy got is he

2295
01:59:03,700 --> 01:59:08,860
saw us here with our wank about, Ooh, it's going to be Castlevania or it could be something

2296
01:59:08,860 --> 01:59:13,180
like the Winx Club coming back, but no, it's gotta be fucking Frogger.

2297
01:59:13,180 --> 01:59:14,180
That's what that guy recorded.

2298
01:59:14,180 --> 01:59:17,220
And you know how much I love when they have new Frogger announcements.

2299
01:59:17,220 --> 01:59:18,220
I know.

2300
01:59:18,220 --> 01:59:19,220
Weren't you excited about Frogger?

2301
01:59:19,220 --> 01:59:20,220
Oh yeah.

2302
01:59:20,220 --> 01:59:21,220
All right.

2303
01:59:21,220 --> 01:59:26,500
Anyway, uh, let's see where was I did it, but also the last time Konami tried to bring

2304
01:59:26,500 --> 01:59:30,920
back Frogger was when I worked there as a tester and the Frogger games they were making

2305
01:59:30,920 --> 01:59:33,500
were complete garbage.

2306
01:59:33,500 --> 01:59:34,500
Spoiler alert.

2307
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:38,660
Now, I haven't been on Apple Arcade myself, but if I'm to believe what my friends are

2308
01:59:38,660 --> 01:59:42,140
saying about the new Frogger game, guess what?

2309
01:59:42,140 --> 01:59:44,500
There's still garbage.

2310
01:59:44,500 --> 01:59:46,900
How do you make, how do you make Frogger garbage?

2311
01:59:46,900 --> 01:59:51,340
I mean, you, you have a game that like knocked it off, you know, in Crossy Roads.

2312
01:59:51,340 --> 01:59:52,940
Do your kids play the Frogger games?

2313
01:59:52,940 --> 01:59:54,260
Cause I bet they don't care.

2314
01:59:54,260 --> 01:59:55,740
I think that's what it boils down to.

2315
01:59:55,740 --> 01:59:58,220
They don't play Frogger at all, but they play Crossy Roads.

2316
01:59:58,220 --> 01:59:59,220
Interesting.

2317
01:59:59,220 --> 02:00:00,220
They love Crossy Roads.

2318
02:00:00,220 --> 02:00:05,300
Well, I remember when they, when they redid Frogger on the PlayStation one, it was kind

2319
02:00:05,300 --> 02:00:07,180
of like, Whoa, this is different.

2320
02:00:07,180 --> 02:00:08,180
Right?

2321
02:00:08,180 --> 02:00:10,180
Cause like Frogger in the arcade was kind of basic as hell.

2322
02:00:10,180 --> 02:00:11,180
Right.

2323
02:00:11,180 --> 02:00:12,180
It was just like, you know, don't get me wrong.

2324
02:00:12,180 --> 02:00:13,180
It was a great game for what?

2325
02:00:13,180 --> 02:00:14,420
1983 or whenever that came out.

2326
02:00:14,420 --> 02:00:15,420
But you know, you're going to bloop, bloop, bloop.

2327
02:00:15,940 --> 02:00:16,940
You're just going up to the top of the screen.

2328
02:00:16,940 --> 02:00:17,940
It's kind of basic.

2329
02:00:17,940 --> 02:00:18,940
Right.

2330
02:00:18,940 --> 02:00:22,260
But like, then it was like, Holy shit on the PlayStation.

2331
02:00:22,260 --> 02:00:27,500
Now Frogger can go four different directions and like the levels are like mazes and stuff.

2332
02:00:27,500 --> 02:00:30,020
They're not like, it was kind of like a whole new thing.

2333
02:00:30,020 --> 02:00:34,540
And when they sold oodles and oodles of that game, now Konami was like, Oh shit, we just

2334
02:00:34,540 --> 02:00:35,960
found the formula for success.

2335
02:00:35,960 --> 02:00:38,780
We have to repeat that formula every single time.

2336
02:00:38,780 --> 02:00:43,060
And now here we are in the year 2019 and they're still making Frogger on the PlayStation one

2337
02:00:43,060 --> 02:00:44,060
for Apple arcade.

2338
02:00:45,060 --> 02:00:46,060
Better graphics.

2339
02:00:46,060 --> 02:00:47,060
Yeah.

2340
02:00:47,060 --> 02:00:48,060
Yeah.

2341
02:00:48,060 --> 02:00:49,060
But apparently it doesn't run very well.

2342
02:00:49,060 --> 02:00:50,060
It seems like it's very poorly.

2343
02:00:50,060 --> 02:00:53,820
Apparently it was a highlight because they have the showed off during the keynote.

2344
02:00:53,820 --> 02:00:57,700
Kaijuto in chat says, I want to combine Frogger with Grand Theft Auto.

2345
02:00:57,700 --> 02:00:59,180
Well, you know what?

2346
02:00:59,180 --> 02:01:05,980
Konami just, I don't think they understand this concept of like, you know, make it 2019

2347
02:01:05,980 --> 02:01:08,540
Sonic two bonus level, but make it 2019.

2348
02:01:08,540 --> 02:01:11,100
Like I just, I just don't see Konami able to do that.

2349
02:01:11,100 --> 02:01:13,500
Frogger, but battle royale is pretty good.

2350
02:01:13,940 --> 02:01:14,940
What?

2351
02:01:14,940 --> 02:01:18,500
Frogger, but battle royale.

2352
02:01:18,500 --> 02:01:19,940
How would you make Frogger royale?

2353
02:01:19,940 --> 02:01:21,140
I don't know.

2354
02:01:21,140 --> 02:01:24,220
One frog and 99 people driving a car.

2355
02:01:24,220 --> 02:01:25,220
There.

2356
02:01:25,220 --> 02:01:26,220
Okay.

2357
02:01:26,220 --> 02:01:28,220
Maybe not battle royale.

2358
02:01:28,220 --> 02:01:29,220
Okay.

2359
02:01:29,220 --> 02:01:30,980
I like, I like where we're going with this.

2360
02:01:30,980 --> 02:01:32,360
Let's game design.

2361
02:01:32,360 --> 02:01:36,820
How about instead of the battle royale formula, how about the evolve formula?

2362
02:01:36,820 --> 02:01:38,220
The four versus one, right?

2363
02:01:38,220 --> 02:01:39,740
Cause those games are super in right now.

2364
02:01:39,740 --> 02:01:40,740
Right?

2365
02:01:40,740 --> 02:01:41,740
Dead by daylight.

2366
02:01:41,740 --> 02:01:42,740
All that, all that shit's huge.

2367
02:01:42,980 --> 02:01:48,900
So how about one person is the frog and the others are the cars and the other methods

2368
02:01:48,900 --> 02:01:51,020
to try to kill Frogger.

2369
02:01:51,020 --> 02:01:52,600
Would y'all play that game?

2370
02:01:52,600 --> 02:01:53,860
Quick poll in chat.

2371
02:01:53,860 --> 02:01:55,940
Would you play, what do we call the game?

2372
02:01:55,940 --> 02:01:58,340
I don't know.

2373
02:01:58,340 --> 02:02:01,360
Frogger survivor, Frogger survive.

2374
02:02:01,360 --> 02:02:02,740
One word titles are in right now.

2375
02:02:02,740 --> 02:02:03,740
Right?

2376
02:02:03,740 --> 02:02:04,740
Frog, Frogger survive.

2377
02:02:04,740 --> 02:02:05,940
Would you play frog survive?

2378
02:02:05,940 --> 02:02:07,020
Let's see.

2379
02:02:07,020 --> 02:02:08,020
Looking in chat.

2380
02:02:08,020 --> 02:02:09,820
Havok978 says, ship it.

2381
02:02:09,820 --> 02:02:11,320
Dr. Sia says, sure.

2382
02:02:11,320 --> 02:02:13,280
Bobby Blackwool says, somebody should be an alligator.

2383
02:02:13,280 --> 02:02:14,920
Well, you should get to pick.

2384
02:02:14,920 --> 02:02:16,520
You should get, do you want to be the car?

2385
02:02:16,520 --> 02:02:20,220
Do you want to be, uh, do you want to be one of those logs that sinks into the water every

2386
02:02:20,220 --> 02:02:21,220
now and then?

2387
02:02:21,220 --> 02:02:22,220
Uh, do you want to be an alligator?

2388
02:02:22,220 --> 02:02:23,720
Like what do you want to do?

2389
02:02:23,720 --> 02:02:29,520
Uh, Dr. Sia says, Frogger survive, but use the same survive from that metal gear solid

2390
02:02:29,520 --> 02:02:30,520
spinoff.

2391
02:02:30,520 --> 02:02:33,960
Oh, uh, quiet could be in it for no particular reason.

2392
02:02:33,960 --> 02:02:39,520
Or frog dressed up like quiet.

2393
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:41,400
Let's reskin the whole thing.

2394
02:02:41,400 --> 02:02:44,240
Yeah, well I got it.

2395
02:02:44,240 --> 02:02:46,800
Like cause we can't really come up with a unique idea.

2396
02:02:46,800 --> 02:02:52,800
Let's just take Melgasol five, we'll reskin it as Frogger and just rerelease that.

2397
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:56,240
Bobby Blackwool says, Norman Reedus is the frog.

2398
02:02:56,240 --> 02:02:58,440
I like it.

2399
02:02:58,440 --> 02:02:59,440
Okay.

2400
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:00,440
Uh, where were we?

2401
02:03:00,440 --> 02:03:03,440
I was, this, this was a Flaco Jones email at one point.

2402
02:03:03,440 --> 02:03:04,960
Um, Oh yes.

2403
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:07,360
Surprised you didn't bring this up on last week's show.

2404
02:03:07,360 --> 02:03:10,400
There was a pretty packed news week, so it makes sense.

2405
02:03:10,400 --> 02:03:14,120
Flaco, let me tell you a little bit about my thought process when I'm constructing the

2406
02:03:14,120 --> 02:03:15,960
show role for orange launch radio.

2407
02:03:15,960 --> 02:03:20,160
I see a story about Frogger and I think, Hmm, I really don't give a shit.

2408
02:03:20,160 --> 02:03:22,920
And I move on to the next thing on the list.

2409
02:03:22,920 --> 02:03:27,440
Now this week was a little bit of a slower news week, so it might've made the cut this

2410
02:03:27,440 --> 02:03:30,520
week, but obviously, but you know what?

2411
02:03:30,520 --> 02:03:33,160
We, we work for our listeners.

2412
02:03:33,160 --> 02:03:37,240
So when you guys are saying, this is what you want to talk about Flaco is like, Hey,

2413
02:03:37,240 --> 02:03:41,480
well then talk about Frogger and Anita, you would have never had Frogger survive.

2414
02:03:41,480 --> 02:03:45,920
And this concept we're going to make millions off of if, which by the way, Konami, we own

2415
02:03:45,920 --> 02:03:46,920
that idea.

2416
02:03:46,920 --> 02:03:50,040
Now Frogger survive is ours and, uh, you patent pending, right?

2417
02:03:50,040 --> 02:03:52,480
That's how you ensure patent pending.

2418
02:03:52,480 --> 02:03:53,480
So there it is.

2419
02:03:53,480 --> 02:03:54,480
All right.

2420
02:03:54,480 --> 02:03:59,840
Uh, pod culture is says playing Frogger now it sucks.

2421
02:03:59,840 --> 02:04:02,920
Bobby Blackwool says, Jeff Keeley is the girlfriend.

2422
02:04:02,920 --> 02:04:03,920
Wasn't there?

2423
02:04:03,920 --> 02:04:09,040
Was a lady frog that would sometimes be on the, the, or there was a lady frog on the

2424
02:04:09,040 --> 02:04:10,940
log that you would pick up on your way.

2425
02:04:10,940 --> 02:04:12,520
So yes, Jeff Keeley can be the lady frog.

2426
02:04:12,520 --> 02:04:13,520
Uh, and that's true.

2427
02:04:13,520 --> 02:04:17,040
And her mat says Nolan North as the voice of frog number one, you guys are doing really

2428
02:04:17,040 --> 02:04:19,840
man Questbuster says Troy Baker is the red car.

2429
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:20,960
We're going to start a game company.

2430
02:04:20,960 --> 02:04:21,960
You guys.

2431
02:04:21,960 --> 02:04:22,960
All right.

2432
02:04:22,960 --> 02:04:23,960
Where were we?

2433
02:04:23,960 --> 02:04:24,960
Oh yes.

2434
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:25,960
Flaco's email.

2435
02:04:25,960 --> 02:04:30,080
Um, that just really got me laughing and thinking about old times at Konami QA.

2436
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:32,160
Well, I hope we give you a laugh here too.

2437
02:04:32,160 --> 02:04:33,680
Have a great rest of your stream.

2438
02:04:33,680 --> 02:04:34,680
We'll try.

2439
02:04:34,680 --> 02:04:35,680
Uh, thanks.

2440
02:04:35,680 --> 02:04:36,680
Flaco Jones.

2441
02:04:36,680 --> 02:04:37,680
PS.

2442
02:04:37,680 --> 02:04:40,420
Here's the link to the keynote where the Konami brand manager comes on stage.

2443
02:04:40,420 --> 02:04:43,760
It's just a short two minute clip and the game does not look great.

2444
02:04:43,760 --> 02:04:44,760
Uh, yeah.

2445
02:04:44,760 --> 02:04:47,880
One of my friends was talking about it online and I was like, yeah, I'm looking at it right

2446
02:04:47,880 --> 02:04:52,980
now and it's like, it's sorry if I don't rip the video beforehand, I can't just put it

2447
02:04:52,980 --> 02:04:53,980
on stream.

2448
02:04:53,980 --> 02:04:57,960
So, um, for those of you guys that were joining us from the giant size team up rate, hello

2449
02:04:57,960 --> 02:05:01,440
by the way, and welcome to orange launch radio here at the voice of geeks network.

2450
02:05:02,160 --> 02:05:05,120
We're totally a show about video games and we take ourselves very seriously.

2451
02:05:05,120 --> 02:05:08,160
This is a very fine craft that we do here, just so you know.

2452
02:05:08,160 --> 02:05:12,760
Um, but also since we're very low budget operation, if I didn't grab the video before we started,

2453
02:05:12,760 --> 02:05:13,760
then I can't put it on air.

2454
02:05:13,760 --> 02:05:16,360
So, uh, and I forgot to grab this one tonight.

2455
02:05:16,360 --> 02:05:17,360
So yeah.

2456
02:05:17,360 --> 02:05:18,360
It looks really lame.

2457
02:05:18,360 --> 02:05:19,360
Yeah.

2458
02:05:19,360 --> 02:05:20,360
It does kind of look lame.

2459
02:05:20,360 --> 02:05:21,360
That's all you need to know.

2460
02:05:21,360 --> 02:05:22,360
It looks lame.

2461
02:05:22,360 --> 02:05:23,360
All right.

2462
02:05:23,360 --> 02:05:24,360
Uh, that's it for the emails.

2463
02:05:24,360 --> 02:05:27,560
If you want to send us an email in a future week, participate at orange launch radio.com

2464
02:05:27,560 --> 02:05:32,640
is the place to send your emails for consideration for reading here on air.

2465
02:05:32,640 --> 02:05:34,320
Let's get to our next story.

2466
02:05:34,320 --> 02:05:35,320
Loki.

2467
02:05:35,320 --> 02:05:36,320
All right.

2468
02:05:36,320 --> 02:05:39,200
I got to close my Frogger video here, which why is he eating jelly beans?

2469
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:41,980
It doesn't make any sense, whatever.

2470
02:05:41,980 --> 02:05:45,300
So red dead online, apparently red dead online.

2471
02:05:45,300 --> 02:05:50,140
There may be some teasing going on, um, regarding a possible update soon.

2472
02:05:50,140 --> 02:05:56,320
So apparently people have been spotting whether it's part of a glitch or not, uh, NPCs that

2473
02:05:56,320 --> 02:06:01,300
sort of look zombie like, um, they have like a screenshot.

2474
02:06:01,300 --> 02:06:07,240
For example, this old woman who has clearly a zombie face and kind of dead eyes.

2475
02:06:07,240 --> 02:06:14,600
Could this possibly be a hint at an undead nightmare type DLC or red dead online type

2476
02:06:14,600 --> 02:06:17,160
of event that's going to go on?

2477
02:06:17,160 --> 02:06:23,240
I'm guessing yes, because this is too obvious and too easy of an way for them to get money.

2478
02:06:23,240 --> 02:06:27,600
So it makes sense that this is going to be a thing that they'll probably do, especially

2479
02:06:27,600 --> 02:06:29,320
since Halloween is right around the corner.

2480
02:06:29,320 --> 02:06:33,080
Now earlier in the show, we kind of talked about how some companies like EA are really,

2481
02:06:33,080 --> 02:06:35,240
you know, nickel and timing the crap out of things.

2482
02:06:35,240 --> 02:06:39,340
And you know, why aren't people just charging the real cost for games and so forth?

2483
02:06:39,340 --> 02:06:43,280
But I feel like when it comes to like rock star in some ways, are you, where do you,

2484
02:06:43,280 --> 02:06:44,600
how do you feel about this?

2485
02:06:44,600 --> 02:06:52,480
Well, red dead, like I feel that they do kind of, they take the whole like online portion

2486
02:06:52,520 --> 02:06:53,520
of it.

2487
02:06:53,520 --> 02:06:57,120
So there are games as a service model for like the online, Grand Theft Auto online.

2488
02:06:57,120 --> 02:07:02,880
There's tons of updates for it, but they do like nickel and dime stuff on there a ton.

2489
02:07:02,880 --> 02:07:08,880
Like they're really trying to push those shark cards in red dead redemption to the red dead

2490
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:13,960
online, which I never actually played, but I heard enough of it where it's kind of even

2491
02:07:13,960 --> 02:07:18,340
worse where they nickel and dime stuff in there, but they do a lot of content as well.

2492
02:07:18,340 --> 02:07:25,060
So it's kind of, it's hard to say whether or not that's, you know, something that people

2493
02:07:25,060 --> 02:07:29,700
are interested in, but I don't feel so cheated necessarily by Grand Theft Auto five and rather

2494
02:07:29,700 --> 02:07:33,280
redemption too, because the single player campaigns for those are fucking amazing.

2495
02:07:33,280 --> 02:07:37,100
Like they're just great games by themselves and you're getting that for $60.

2496
02:07:37,100 --> 02:07:40,260
This online portion is above and beyond that.

2497
02:07:40,260 --> 02:07:45,000
So that's kind of like, I could see them treating it like their DLC because they don't do single

2498
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:49,040
player DLC anymore for the Grand Theft Auto games or red dead redemption.

2499
02:07:49,040 --> 02:07:52,040
It's all in online, which that's fine.

2500
02:07:52,040 --> 02:07:55,400
That makes sense because you're, you know, hosting this whole other game.

2501
02:07:55,400 --> 02:07:59,680
So you're like, okay with it because there's the single player, which is fully featured,

2502
02:07:59,680 --> 02:08:00,680
fully functional for $60.

2503
02:08:00,680 --> 02:08:05,160
But then like this multiplayer is like something extra, you know, to be fair to EA, that used

2504
02:08:05,160 --> 02:08:08,000
to be the way it was when they first dipped their toe in all this stuff with like Mass

2505
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:11,840
Effect multiplayer, which I loved like, and even though Mass Effect multiplayer, when

2506
02:08:11,840 --> 02:08:16,280
they put that in Mass Effect 3 got a lot of pushback and, and, um, you know, shit for

2507
02:08:16,280 --> 02:08:19,720
just being a money grab or whatever they're calling it at the time, I actually kind of

2508
02:08:19,720 --> 02:08:23,480
loved it because Mass Effect 3 as a standalone game was great.

2509
02:08:23,480 --> 02:08:28,280
You know, I even liked it before they did all the patches, whatever fight me.

2510
02:08:28,280 --> 02:08:32,560
But when they did the multiplayer stuff on top of that, like I really enjoyed that.

2511
02:08:32,560 --> 02:08:35,840
And the loot box stuff didn't feel so mandatory.

2512
02:08:35,840 --> 02:08:40,720
You really could grind your way to free loot boxes at a non obscene pace.

2513
02:08:40,720 --> 02:08:43,120
Yeah. Like for example, like we want to go back to that server.

2514
02:08:43,120 --> 02:08:46,200
We're talking about how like companies abuse stuff like that.

2515
02:08:46,200 --> 02:08:54,560
Um, look at Activision where they pay walled a call of duty, um, modern warfare remastered

2516
02:08:54,560 --> 02:08:59,480
behind having the purchase call of duty, infinite warfare.

2517
02:08:59,480 --> 02:09:04,960
And on top of that, that it's a remaster you would think, oh, it's going to be remastered

2518
02:09:04,960 --> 02:09:05,960
all the content in there.

2519
02:09:05,960 --> 02:09:06,960
Additional things.

2520
02:09:06,960 --> 02:09:07,960
No, no.

2521
02:09:07,960 --> 02:09:12,040
The DLC pack that they had in call of duty four, they're going to resell that to you.

2522
02:09:12,040 --> 02:09:15,880
Oh, and they're selling it to you for more than what it was originally in the original

2523
02:09:15,880 --> 02:09:16,880
game.

2524
02:09:16,880 --> 02:09:20,960
Oh, and we're adding loot boxes that no one ever wanted into the game as well.

2525
02:09:20,960 --> 02:09:22,120
That is what I'm talking about.

2526
02:09:22,120 --> 02:09:26,080
Like taking it to an extreme because they know they can get money and so they're going

2527
02:09:26,080 --> 02:09:27,640
to get all of the money is what they want.

2528
02:09:27,640 --> 02:09:28,640
All right.

2529
02:09:28,640 --> 02:09:29,920
Just wanted to mention the other rockstar related.

2530
02:09:29,920 --> 02:09:30,920
Yes.

2531
02:09:30,920 --> 02:09:34,640
So I was going to say that they're also, cause this is also something that people really

2532
02:09:34,640 --> 02:09:39,600
want is they're rolling out their own PC games launcher.

2533
02:09:39,600 --> 02:09:42,240
Why, why do we need to do this?

2534
02:09:42,240 --> 02:09:46,000
But apparently they have their own games launcher on PC.

2535
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:50,160
If you own any rockstar titles, you can launch them all in one place.

2536
02:09:50,160 --> 02:09:54,680
I think these are more of the ones that you purchase actually through like their game.

2537
02:09:54,680 --> 02:09:59,040
Like they have like my grand theft auto five copy for example, is not through steam.

2538
02:09:59,040 --> 02:10:02,840
It's actually just through like, I don't even remember where it's through.

2539
02:10:02,840 --> 02:10:04,640
I think it was a box copy in it.

2540
02:10:04,640 --> 02:10:08,480
You redeem it through the rockstar social club, I want to say at one time.

2541
02:10:08,480 --> 02:10:11,320
So I guess this is just a launcher that ties in with that.

2542
02:10:11,320 --> 02:10:15,240
And apparently if you install the launcher, you can also claim a free copy of grand theft

2543
02:10:15,240 --> 02:10:16,240
auto San Andreas.

2544
02:10:16,240 --> 02:10:17,240
Oh wow.

2545
02:10:17,240 --> 02:10:22,580
Um, so that's a good way to get me to install it on my computer, offer me a pretty solid

2546
02:10:22,580 --> 02:10:23,580
free game.

2547
02:10:23,580 --> 02:10:24,580
Yeah.

2548
02:10:24,580 --> 02:10:30,000
I don't know if they're suggesting that, um, maybe that red dead redemption twos come into

2549
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,800
PC as well or what, but it's about that time.

2550
02:10:32,800 --> 02:10:33,760
Right?

2551
02:10:33,760 --> 02:10:36,760
Doesn't red dead, or I'm sorry, don't like rockstar games usually show up about a year

2552
02:10:36,760 --> 02:10:37,760
later on PC.

2553
02:10:37,760 --> 02:10:40,760
Um, sometimes I don't, they're less worried about the piracy.

2554
02:10:40,760 --> 02:10:41,760
Yeah.

2555
02:10:41,760 --> 02:10:46,680
I don't know if, I don't know if it was going to get that pirated, I guess it would, but

2556
02:10:46,680 --> 02:10:49,720
I think times have changed with that kind of times have changed with that kind of stuff

2557
02:10:49,720 --> 02:10:50,720
too.

2558
02:10:50,720 --> 02:10:53,240
But for whatever reason, rockstar is still kind of on that pattern, but yeah, you can

2559
02:10:53,240 --> 02:10:57,120
get this launcher, I guess if you want, I'm not gonna pick it up because I already have

2560
02:10:57,120 --> 02:11:02,180
grand theft auto San Andreas on steam and I don't need another copy of it.

2561
02:11:02,180 --> 02:11:07,900
And also because I have grand theft five standalone launcher and I honestly haven't played that

2562
02:11:07,900 --> 02:11:08,900
in months.

2563
02:11:08,900 --> 02:11:11,740
Is this a case of too many launchers out there available?

2564
02:11:11,740 --> 02:11:14,980
It is, but I don't really get bent out of shape about that stuff so much.

2565
02:11:14,980 --> 02:11:18,620
I mean, I just take them out of my like auto startup thing.

2566
02:11:18,620 --> 02:11:22,260
Like I say, no, you can't start up unless I, so I just take them all out of my store.

2567
02:11:22,260 --> 02:11:24,940
Like with Epic, like for example, like they've been offering free games.

2568
02:11:24,940 --> 02:11:28,700
So like they have had like this week they have the Batman games free because of the

2569
02:11:28,700 --> 02:11:31,280
whole tie in with the Fortnite stuff.

2570
02:11:31,280 --> 02:11:36,760
So you can get the Lego Batman one, two and three and then Batman Arkham, the Arkham city

2571
02:11:36,760 --> 02:11:41,380
night and asylum, I think all free as well.

2572
02:11:41,380 --> 02:11:45,920
So I added those to my queue even though I have them already on other platforms and then

2573
02:11:45,920 --> 02:11:50,920
my kid, I was like, Hey, I'm like, let's add Lego Batman because you may want to play that

2574
02:11:50,920 --> 02:11:55,200
Sunday even if you don't, I didn't even think I put the Batman Arkham stuff in there too.

2575
02:11:55,200 --> 02:11:56,200
Ah, you'll play it Sunday.

2576
02:11:56,200 --> 02:11:57,200
It's fine.

2577
02:11:57,200 --> 02:11:58,200
It's free.

2578
02:11:58,200 --> 02:11:59,200
Put it in your library.

2579
02:11:59,200 --> 02:12:00,560
Who cares if you don't want it, it doesn't matter.

2580
02:12:00,840 --> 02:12:01,840
Let's put it in there.

2581
02:12:01,840 --> 02:12:02,840
Well, funny you bring that up.

2582
02:12:02,840 --> 02:12:03,840
Cause I think we're going to come back to that.

2583
02:12:03,840 --> 02:12:04,840
Oh, sorry.

2584
02:12:04,840 --> 02:12:05,840
I real stories.

2585
02:12:05,840 --> 02:12:06,840
Oh, you're fine.

2586
02:12:06,840 --> 02:12:07,840
It's spoiler alert.

2587
02:12:07,840 --> 02:12:08,840
Oh my God.

2588
02:12:08,840 --> 02:12:11,200
Anyway, I do want to read some comments in our chat over Twitch TV slash vog network,

2589
02:12:11,200 --> 02:12:12,200
VOG network.

2590
02:12:12,200 --> 02:12:16,520
Cause you just says I got a free copy of grand theft auto, San Andreas, San Andreas is worth

2591
02:12:16,520 --> 02:12:17,520
it.

2592
02:12:17,520 --> 02:12:20,680
If you want to see how they got the idea for grand theft auto five online grand theft auto

2593
02:12:20,680 --> 02:12:25,320
San Andreas has an online mod that works a lot like GTA five online, but you can be a

2594
02:12:25,320 --> 02:12:26,320
cop in it.

2595
02:12:26,320 --> 02:12:27,320
It's dope.

2596
02:12:27,320 --> 02:12:28,320
So yeah.

2597
02:12:28,320 --> 02:12:29,320
Yeah.

2598
02:12:29,320 --> 02:12:32,880
You see a lot of the roots of where the games is now in the early.

2599
02:12:32,880 --> 02:12:33,880
Yeah.

2600
02:12:33,880 --> 02:12:34,880
Don't get me wrong.

2601
02:12:34,880 --> 02:12:37,320
I don't like what they've done necessarily with grand theft auto online and how like

2602
02:12:37,320 --> 02:12:42,000
it's just such a money grab and same with red dead online.

2603
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:45,000
But with that said, I am there day one when grand theft auto six comes out.

2604
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
So I don't give a shit about any of that.

2605
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:48,000
All right.

2606
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:51,240
Well, speaking of going back to your roots, uh, this next story we're going to talk about

2607
02:12:51,240 --> 02:12:56,320
is a music game story and our voiceover guy, Jason brought this to my attention cause I'm

2608
02:12:56,320 --> 02:13:00,560
a little bit out of the loop on music game news these days, but this one does look pretty

2609
02:13:00,560 --> 02:13:01,560
cool.

2610
02:13:01,560 --> 02:13:02,560
I actually have video of it.

2611
02:13:02,560 --> 02:13:03,560
You ready?

2612
02:13:03,560 --> 02:13:05,600
I don't know if I, I don't know if I am pronouncing the name of this game, right?

2613
02:13:05,600 --> 02:13:06,600
I'm sorry.

2614
02:13:06,600 --> 02:13:07,600
I'm going to call it Waka.

2615
02:13:07,600 --> 02:13:13,640
It's w a C. Well, I'm thinking Waka, Waka, you know, the old DDR, like Fossey bear Waka,

2616
02:13:13,640 --> 02:13:14,640
Waka, Waka.

2617
02:13:14,640 --> 02:13:18,240
I, I, yeah, I'm thinking it's Waka, but that's what, that's what I'm sticking to it, but

2618
02:13:18,240 --> 02:13:19,240
here's what it looks like.

2619
02:13:19,240 --> 02:13:22,000
Uh, for those of you that are watching on Twitch, for those of you that are on the podcast

2620
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:25,240
feed, uh, at least you can kind of hear what the game sounds like a little bit, but it's

2621
02:13:25,240 --> 02:13:28,120
got a really neat little kind of neon look to it, huh?

2622
02:13:28,120 --> 02:13:36,000
Uh, this is from red Alice's hardcore label, hardcore Tano C. This is the new arcade game.

2623
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:38,840
It is showing up at round ones around the world.

2624
02:13:38,840 --> 02:13:42,560
Um, you might be able to find it at Sega arcades in Japan as well.

2625
02:13:42,560 --> 02:13:48,240
Um, but, um, I don't think we really have to say I saw, um, someone had posted that

2626
02:13:48,240 --> 02:13:52,760
there's, okay, there's a game very similar also has an old look like this because they

2627
02:13:52,760 --> 02:13:55,560
had it at dragon con and I've seen it in arcades.

2628
02:13:55,560 --> 02:13:58,960
So this is actually like the second, what they call, I love this washing machine looking

2629
02:13:58,960 --> 02:13:59,960
game.

2630
02:13:59,960 --> 02:14:03,120
Well, there was one that like they showed it was like a Dave and busters, I think in

2631
02:14:03,120 --> 02:14:05,160
a run at park or something like that.

2632
02:14:05,160 --> 02:14:06,160
Yeah.

2633
02:14:06,160 --> 02:14:10,280
But look at this guy is wearing gloves when he plays, which actually considering how many

2634
02:14:10,280 --> 02:14:13,880
people touch that machine and kids that pick their nose and probably put their hands all

2635
02:14:13,880 --> 02:14:14,880
over the pretty lights.

2636
02:14:14,880 --> 02:14:16,400
Um, I don't blame them at all.

2637
02:14:16,400 --> 02:14:19,160
Um, but yeah, this, it looks fun, doesn't it?

2638
02:14:19,160 --> 02:14:22,680
So for those watching on the, excuse me, listening on the podcast feed, basically these notes

2639
02:14:22,680 --> 02:14:25,720
kind of go around the circle and the guy, it's like tempest the music game.

2640
02:14:25,720 --> 02:14:26,720
Yeah.

2641
02:14:26,720 --> 02:14:27,720
Oh my God.

2642
02:14:27,720 --> 02:14:28,720
That's a great way to describe it.

2643
02:14:28,720 --> 02:14:29,720
It's tempest the music game.

2644
02:14:29,720 --> 02:14:30,720
That is exactly what it is.

2645
02:14:30,720 --> 02:14:31,720
That's great.

2646
02:14:31,720 --> 02:14:38,600
Um, man, I remember when red Alice was just like, we'd see just a BMS files back in, you

2647
02:14:38,600 --> 02:14:46,400
know, the PC beat mania SIM days and now it's like spun off into like actual music games

2648
02:14:46,400 --> 02:14:47,800
and crazy.

2649
02:14:47,800 --> 02:14:52,400
As Jason describes this, uh, you tap and hold or swipe or draw.

2650
02:14:52,400 --> 02:14:58,560
Um, and when you do that, you can swipe clockwise or counterclockwise, you swipe in, swipe out,

2651
02:14:58,560 --> 02:15:04,880
uh, and all with a degree of accuracy from which, uh, you can go like not so great to

2652
02:15:04,880 --> 02:15:05,880
really, really tight.

2653
02:15:05,880 --> 02:15:08,440
Um, the entire ring is touch sensitive.

2654
02:15:08,440 --> 02:15:12,420
So the top, the bottom everywhere, it's a very expressive game with lots of vocal Lloyd

2655
02:15:12,420 --> 02:15:16,840
and Tano C songs as seen in other music games, some new to music game ones.

2656
02:15:16,880 --> 02:15:21,720
And of course, Tano C artists exclusives, uh, Jason says it's a super fun game.

2657
02:15:21,720 --> 02:15:28,480
And my, my is the name of the other game that's kind of like a, uh, a washing machine or dryer

2658
02:15:28,480 --> 02:15:29,480
shape sort of thing.

2659
02:15:29,480 --> 02:15:31,480
So yeah, it looks really fun.

2660
02:15:31,480 --> 02:15:33,120
Like I just want to check that out.

2661
02:15:33,120 --> 02:15:38,800
Uh, they opened like another round one, uh, the one in Hayward, I think I'm anticipating

2662
02:15:38,800 --> 02:15:41,800
I'm like there, you know, on the windows or they don't have a window.

2663
02:15:41,800 --> 02:15:43,800
There is the door.

2664
02:15:44,760 --> 02:15:50,060
Um, some comments in our chat, uh, Shane says gloves are necessary for these types of games.

2665
02:15:50,060 --> 02:15:51,680
Learn that the hard and painful way.

2666
02:15:51,680 --> 02:15:53,400
When I was in Japan, good point.

2667
02:15:53,400 --> 02:15:58,320
A lot more people probably go prepared to these types of arcades to like, you know,

2668
02:15:58,320 --> 02:16:01,400
really like play and do well at these songs.

2669
02:16:01,400 --> 02:16:05,120
And some people around one, when I've been to those arcades are, you know, they get into

2670
02:16:05,120 --> 02:16:06,120
it, they're prepared.

2671
02:16:06,120 --> 02:16:08,900
If they're playing DDR, they've got their, like, like they're going to the gym, they've

2672
02:16:08,900 --> 02:16:13,200
got their water bottle and their little, you know, cloth to pat down all the sweat, which

2673
02:16:13,200 --> 02:16:14,320
is a nice thing to do.

2674
02:16:14,320 --> 02:16:15,800
That's just, it's a necessity.

2675
02:16:15,800 --> 02:16:17,320
Yeah, it really is.

2676
02:16:17,320 --> 02:16:21,320
So a dark to see it says, Oh yeah, a lot of the, my, my vids, uh, I've seen they wear

2677
02:16:21,320 --> 02:16:22,320
gloves.

2678
02:16:22,320 --> 02:16:23,960
Um, I hope I'm saying this name right.

2679
02:16:23,960 --> 02:16:24,960
Sorry if I'm not.

2680
02:16:24,960 --> 02:16:29,000
Thour six, six says, this guy makes it look easy, but maybe it's not.

2681
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:32,760
It's probably like a lot of music games where it's a learning curve, right?

2682
02:16:32,760 --> 02:16:34,840
You get used to reading it more and more.

2683
02:16:34,840 --> 02:16:38,680
The more you play, like imagine the first time you played dance, dance revolution, if

2684
02:16:38,680 --> 02:16:41,760
you ever did play dance, dance revolution, you know, it's really like you would not

2685
02:16:41,760 --> 02:16:44,260
be able to do the hardest songs in that game right off the bat.

2686
02:16:44,260 --> 02:16:46,500
You've got to learn like, Oh, the arrow hit the top.

2687
02:16:46,500 --> 02:16:49,080
You kind of are learning to read the note chart.

2688
02:16:49,080 --> 02:16:53,800
And that game is similar to, it takes a lot of practice is basically what it boils down

2689
02:16:53,800 --> 02:16:54,800
to.

2690
02:16:54,800 --> 02:16:58,480
And I used to be good at games like we'd be in a two DX, but since I haven't played

2691
02:16:58,480 --> 02:17:03,520
in so long, if I had to play them now, yikes, uh, that were also, we'll follow set up with

2692
02:17:03,520 --> 02:17:04,520
another question.

2693
02:17:04,520 --> 02:17:05,640
What happens when you goof?

2694
02:17:05,640 --> 02:17:07,640
Usually you probably saw the combo ticking up there.

2695
02:17:07,640 --> 02:17:10,080
Let me run the B roll again real quick here.

2696
02:17:10,080 --> 02:17:15,280
You'll notice as the person plays, um, there's a combo that kind of ticks up as they are

2697
02:17:15,280 --> 02:17:16,280
doing the notes.

2698
02:17:16,280 --> 02:17:18,000
You can see it's like 10, 11, 12, 16, 19.

2699
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:19,920
So as they're hitting all the notes, this combo goes up.

2700
02:17:19,920 --> 02:17:24,880
If this player were to screw up, that combo would break, which I mean, big deal, right?

2701
02:17:24,880 --> 02:17:30,360
But if you mess up too many notes, usually the song will fail and you will, you know,

2702
02:17:30,360 --> 02:17:31,360
you basically you lose.

2703
02:17:31,360 --> 02:17:34,800
But I also like the little things that comes over the top bonus get and that whole type

2704
02:17:34,800 --> 02:17:35,800
of thing.

2705
02:17:35,800 --> 02:17:37,360
So a really cute how they have that whole thing.

2706
02:17:37,640 --> 02:17:40,960
But of course if you want a high score, which is what this is all about, then you want to

2707
02:17:40,960 --> 02:17:43,560
try to make sure you get the highest combo if possible.

2708
02:17:43,560 --> 02:17:46,480
People really like to brag when they get full combos and things like that.

2709
02:17:46,480 --> 02:17:47,480
Yeah.

2710
02:17:47,480 --> 02:17:48,760
So that's what that's all about.

2711
02:17:48,760 --> 02:17:50,560
So a Waka looks pretty cool.

2712
02:17:50,560 --> 02:17:54,680
I can't wait to go to a round one and check this out for myself.

2713
02:17:54,680 --> 02:17:57,680
Meanwhile, Loki, um, you alluded to this a little bit ago.

2714
02:17:57,680 --> 02:17:58,680
Yeah.

2715
02:17:58,680 --> 02:18:02,600
So as I mentioned, there's free stuff on Epic game store right now for Batman.

2716
02:18:02,840 --> 02:18:08,520
Um, and of course all that stuff is tying in with a, um, I don't know if it's the new

2717
02:18:08,520 --> 02:18:09,520
season.

2718
02:18:09,520 --> 02:18:14,520
I assume it's a new season for Batman or a Fortnite that they're doing a crossover Batman

2719
02:18:14,520 --> 02:18:21,440
right now, uh, through and from now through October 6th and you basically can buy different

2720
02:18:21,440 --> 02:18:27,380
things including a cosmetics there from the comic book and movies.

2721
02:18:27,380 --> 02:18:32,980
So they have, you can get a Cape, um, you can buy a Cape Crusader pack and also they've

2722
02:18:32,980 --> 02:18:35,820
got different weapons, new gliders.

2723
02:18:35,820 --> 02:18:41,700
Um, so some of the gear that they're going to offer, a grapple gun that allows you to

2724
02:18:41,700 --> 02:18:50,200
be able to, uh, kind of, you know, fly through the air, the explosive batarangs and yeah.

2725
02:18:50,200 --> 02:18:55,880
So they'll have those, uh, you can earn like a cat wing glider as well, Batman themed imagery

2726
02:18:55,880 --> 02:18:57,220
and other fun stuff.

2727
02:18:57,220 --> 02:19:02,180
So that's going on between now and this, uh, the six admittedly, I don't play a lot of

2728
02:19:02,180 --> 02:19:04,340
Fortnite, but I really do like Batman stuff.

2729
02:19:04,340 --> 02:19:05,860
So I almost kind of want to check it out.

2730
02:19:05,860 --> 02:19:06,860
Is that weird?

2731
02:19:06,860 --> 02:19:07,860
It's free.

2732
02:19:07,860 --> 02:19:11,180
I picked it and I, you know, I picked up that Arkham trilogy on, uh, the Epic store too.

2733
02:19:11,180 --> 02:19:14,060
I was like, dang, I was like, cause they, they were showing the little teaser and I

2734
02:19:14,060 --> 02:19:16,300
was like, what are they going to, are they going to give away the whole trilogy?

2735
02:19:16,300 --> 02:19:17,300
What are they giving away?

2736
02:19:17,300 --> 02:19:20,820
And sure enough, they're giving away like a ton of Batman games, but to make hype for

2737
02:19:20,820 --> 02:19:21,820
their Fortnite thing.

2738
02:19:21,820 --> 02:19:22,820
Yeah.

2739
02:19:22,820 --> 02:19:24,220
Trilogy and uh, the Lego stuff too.

2740
02:19:24,220 --> 02:19:27,220
Wait, Fortnite's making oodles of cash for Epic.

2741
02:19:27,220 --> 02:19:31,760
They can pay $10 million to have control, be exclusive, they can give away these Batman

2742
02:19:31,760 --> 02:19:32,760
games.

2743
02:19:32,760 --> 02:19:33,760
It's pretty crazy.

2744
02:19:33,760 --> 02:19:34,760
Yeah.

2745
02:19:34,760 --> 02:19:35,760
Oh no.

2746
02:19:35,760 --> 02:19:36,760
Does it have all the DLC?

2747
02:19:36,760 --> 02:19:38,220
Maybe that's another thing too.

2748
02:19:38,220 --> 02:19:41,180
Sometimes they'll give away games, but you still have to buy the DLC or buy the extra

2749
02:19:41,180 --> 02:19:42,180
stuff.

2750
02:19:42,180 --> 02:19:43,180
I don't know.

2751
02:19:43,180 --> 02:19:44,820
I don't know either, but it was, I think it was like the Arkham collection.

2752
02:19:44,820 --> 02:19:46,600
So maybe it does have all the DLC in it.

2753
02:19:46,600 --> 02:19:48,580
Maybe somebody in chat can clarify that for us over at TwitchTV.

2754
02:19:48,580 --> 02:19:49,580
I mean I could look, I guess.

2755
02:19:49,580 --> 02:19:51,940
FlashVog network if you've played, I don't know.

2756
02:19:51,940 --> 02:19:56,500
Um, so, uh, but you mentioned the kids were checking out the Lego Batman stuff.

2757
02:19:56,500 --> 02:20:00,980
Well, I just downloaded it for them cause they liked Lego Batman 2 at one point cause

2758
02:20:00,980 --> 02:20:04,260
that was the one that was more open, like more open world.

2759
02:20:04,260 --> 02:20:10,180
Um, so the, yeah, the Batman Arkham Asylum and Arkham City are the game of the year editions.

2760
02:20:10,180 --> 02:20:14,180
Arkham Knight doesn't state that it's the game of the year edition, so I assume, I don't

2761
02:20:14,180 --> 02:20:16,260
know if all the DLC is in that one.

2762
02:20:16,260 --> 02:20:18,740
Um, same with the Lego Batman stuff.

2763
02:20:18,740 --> 02:20:24,420
I don't know if DLC is in there, but I don't think, um, no, I don't want to install that.

2764
02:20:24,420 --> 02:20:31,060
I don't, I do they, I mean, I assume they sell DLC on here, but like, I don't know.

2765
02:20:31,060 --> 02:20:32,060
I'm sure they do too.

2766
02:20:32,060 --> 02:20:34,060
Cause I, I, let me, let me find out.

2767
02:20:34,060 --> 02:20:35,060
Let's see.

2768
02:20:35,060 --> 02:20:38,140
Well actually, if you could do me a favor, can you pull up the next story for me?

2769
02:20:38,140 --> 02:20:41,120
Cause it's on one of the sites that's not working on this browser over here.

2770
02:20:41,120 --> 02:20:45,100
So I'm going to need you to help me out here in talking about it.

2771
02:20:45,260 --> 02:20:49,220
The next story is about Contra Rogue Corps and I know one part of it is that they're

2772
02:20:49,220 --> 02:20:53,980
going to be giving away, uh, basically DLC type stuff after launch, which is kind of

2773
02:20:53,980 --> 02:20:54,980
similar.

2774
02:20:54,980 --> 02:20:57,700
If I remember right, how like the bomber man reimagining did is that they had like, then

2775
02:20:57,700 --> 02:21:01,420
you had like pyramid head bomber man and you had other characters that were available in

2776
02:21:01,420 --> 02:21:04,780
the game after launch and you didn't have to like pay extra money for them.

2777
02:21:04,780 --> 02:21:08,280
So that's always kind of nice, you know, especially amongst the ranting or raving we've been doing

2778
02:21:08,280 --> 02:21:10,660
earlier in this show, it is really cool.

2779
02:21:10,660 --> 02:21:14,540
And I think, you know, it goes a long way when we see a company really support a game

2780
02:21:14,540 --> 02:21:16,660
after launch with extra additions.

2781
02:21:16,660 --> 02:21:19,660
I think it's also part of the reason why Overwatch, you know, again, we talked about how Overwatch

2782
02:21:19,660 --> 02:21:21,100
is a winning formula.

2783
02:21:21,100 --> 02:21:26,260
What two years later, it's because they keep adding characters like Sigma, Batista or newer

2784
02:21:26,260 --> 02:21:28,820
characters, you know, they're still adding this replay value.

2785
02:21:28,820 --> 02:21:31,260
You don't have to buy these characters if you want the skins and you want the pretty

2786
02:21:31,260 --> 02:21:35,660
characters, you know, or them looking their best, I suppose, uh, then yeah, you either

2787
02:21:35,660 --> 02:21:41,060
have to play the lottery or, you know, essentially or, or buy more packs, but, uh, yeah.

2788
02:21:41,060 --> 02:21:42,060
So anyway.

2789
02:21:42,060 --> 02:21:45,900
For Contra there, the question was, well, why is it taking so long to come back?

2790
02:21:45,900 --> 02:21:51,520
And so basically the answer to that was it was very hard to kick off the project just

2791
02:21:51,520 --> 02:21:54,820
because we needed to find the right kind of momentum and timing.

2792
02:21:54,820 --> 02:21:57,540
Obviously I really wanted to make another Contra game.

2793
02:21:57,540 --> 02:21:59,020
I've been really pushing.

2794
02:21:59,020 --> 02:22:02,660
I just couldn't find the right push and couldn't get the approval for such a project.

2795
02:22:02,660 --> 02:22:04,980
Doesn't that, doesn't that, oh, couldn't get the approval.

2796
02:22:04,980 --> 02:22:09,620
I was gonna say a lot of that just sounds like a really nice way of saying like, I wanted

2797
02:22:09,620 --> 02:22:12,980
to do this 10 years ago, but Konami wouldn't let me cause they're bitches.

2798
02:22:12,980 --> 02:22:18,260
Yeah, that's, I'm sorry, but I, this person's very nice and it's saying it in a very polite

2799
02:22:18,260 --> 02:22:22,180
way, but that's kind of what I'm really reading into this is that you really want to do this

2800
02:22:22,180 --> 02:22:25,400
a long time ago is that the timing didn't work out.

2801
02:22:25,400 --> 02:22:28,700
Like that's what you're saying when you're gonna break up with somebody and they said,

2802
02:22:28,700 --> 02:22:30,140
it's just not the right time.

2803
02:22:30,140 --> 02:22:31,300
It's not a you thing.

2804
02:22:31,300 --> 02:22:32,300
It's a me thing.

2805
02:22:32,300 --> 02:22:33,300
Yeah.

2806
02:22:33,300 --> 02:22:36,020
And then they said also one thing, one of the difficult things is finding the right

2807
02:22:36,020 --> 02:22:40,860
team to work on such a game and even just the staff and resources we have at the time,

2808
02:22:40,860 --> 02:22:46,060
but what really pushed forward with the project was one of the things that was very memorable

2809
02:22:46,060 --> 02:22:50,500
to me was working on Contra games and I know the series well, so I figured who else would

2810
02:22:50,500 --> 02:22:53,940
be worthy to create a new, the next Contra game and that's why I wanted to contribute

2811
02:22:53,940 --> 02:22:58,380
all of my talent and history on the series to make it come to life.

2812
02:22:58,380 --> 02:23:00,020
So that's pretty awesome.

2813
02:23:00,020 --> 02:23:05,260
Um, and then of course they're saying that Rogue Corps is going to be getting free content

2814
02:23:05,260 --> 02:23:06,940
after launch as well.

2815
02:23:06,940 --> 02:23:11,580
So they talked about post launch stuff, including more missions and weapons and indicated that

2816
02:23:11,580 --> 02:23:15,060
players will have the ability to go beyond the current level cap.

2817
02:23:15,060 --> 02:23:16,260
There's levels in the game.

2818
02:23:16,260 --> 02:23:17,260
That's weird.

2819
02:23:17,260 --> 02:23:18,260
Um, yeah.

2820
02:23:18,260 --> 02:23:23,740
And they said there's also going to be a season pass and it will feature four DLCs that are

2821
02:23:23,740 --> 02:23:27,460
going to prize up skins and in game items.

2822
02:23:27,460 --> 02:23:30,620
So there'll be a little mix of stuff that's free and stuff that's not free.

2823
02:23:30,620 --> 02:23:33,060
I did not play the demo for this.

2824
02:23:33,100 --> 02:23:36,340
Let me check out that demo cause apparently like I know Dr. C played it and some other

2825
02:23:36,340 --> 02:23:38,580
people on my Twitter feed have said it's fun.

2826
02:23:38,580 --> 02:23:42,920
Because like I don't think I want to get more Switch games right now cause my kids are fighting

2827
02:23:42,920 --> 02:23:47,980
over it and also because I've still have to replace those analog sticks, which by the

2828
02:23:47,980 --> 02:23:50,380
way, yes, I heard about this too.

2829
02:23:50,380 --> 02:23:54,820
Um, I was going to mention because now that, you know, that Switch Lite came out, they're

2830
02:23:54,820 --> 02:23:58,060
using the same fucking analog sticks on the Switch Lite and guess what?

2831
02:23:58,060 --> 02:23:59,540
You can't replace on those.

2832
02:23:59,540 --> 02:24:01,640
Yeah, that's smart Nintendo.

2833
02:24:01,640 --> 02:24:04,120
That's going to be a problem that's going to bite you in the ass six months from now.

2834
02:24:04,120 --> 02:24:05,120
Yeah.

2835
02:24:05,120 --> 02:24:07,880
I have a feeling Nintendo is not going to think the best of that decision later on down

2836
02:24:07,880 --> 02:24:08,880
the line, but we'll see.

2837
02:24:08,880 --> 02:24:12,380
I mean, it's, it's all about what's going to happen a year from now and those things

2838
02:24:12,380 --> 02:24:13,380
start breaking.

2839
02:24:13,380 --> 02:24:16,600
Are they going to have another, you know, suit on their hands or whatever?

2840
02:24:16,600 --> 02:24:19,240
That one's going to be even harder because you can't just send the controllers in.

2841
02:24:19,240 --> 02:24:20,960
Whereas you may have spares for that.

2842
02:24:20,960 --> 02:24:22,520
You got to send the whole damn system back.

2843
02:24:22,520 --> 02:24:23,520
Yeah.

2844
02:24:23,520 --> 02:24:24,520
Yeah.

2845
02:24:24,520 --> 02:24:25,520
That'd be interesting.

2846
02:24:25,520 --> 02:24:26,860
Anyway, uh, we're going to do just a couple of quick stories and then we're going to get

2847
02:24:26,860 --> 02:24:31,120
to the listener round table, uh, via discord and chat.

2848
02:24:31,120 --> 02:24:34,600
So if you want to actually call into our show live, you can use, have to be on our

2849
02:24:34,600 --> 02:24:38,580
discord server over at vog network.com slash discord.

2850
02:24:38,580 --> 02:24:39,580
We'll get you the invite.

2851
02:24:39,580 --> 02:24:40,580
You need to get in there.

2852
02:24:40,580 --> 02:24:44,800
And uh, if you go to the green room, you can hang out and uh, we'll pull some of you guys

2853
02:24:44,800 --> 02:24:47,760
in to actually be on the show a little later on.

2854
02:24:47,760 --> 02:24:50,620
All the information about that is right below on Twitch TV.

2855
02:24:50,620 --> 02:24:53,920
If you're watching on your computer, all that is recap down below because I know we have

2856
02:24:53,920 --> 02:24:55,920
some new viewers tonight.

2857
02:24:55,920 --> 02:24:56,920
So thanks for that.

2858
02:24:56,920 --> 02:25:00,040
Uh, if you wanted to call in and have your say you can, but if you want to just sit back

2859
02:25:00,040 --> 02:25:01,440
and watch, you can do that too.

2860
02:25:01,440 --> 02:25:04,200
We'll also take questions and other comments from our chat room.

2861
02:25:04,200 --> 02:25:09,280
But first we have a few more stories for you guys, including, I think, uh, we were talking

2862
02:25:09,280 --> 02:25:10,280
about blue rays earlier.

2863
02:25:10,280 --> 02:25:13,800
This is one that some of y'all might want to get because I have to ask you a question

2864
02:25:13,800 --> 02:25:14,800
though.

2865
02:25:14,800 --> 02:25:19,560
Did you touch her breast?

2866
02:25:19,560 --> 02:25:24,480
In case you don't pick out the reference, please provide 30 years ago before this clip

2867
02:25:24,480 --> 02:25:25,480
ends up on Tumblr.

2868
02:25:25,480 --> 02:25:31,680
30 years ago, a brilliant movie came out called the wizard, um, which, you know, how many

2869
02:25:31,680 --> 02:25:33,680
of y'all saw it in theaters?

2870
02:25:33,680 --> 02:25:34,920
That's on the drive in.

2871
02:25:34,920 --> 02:25:39,400
Yeah, I didn't see a drive in, but my dad bless his heart, took me to go see it in the

2872
02:25:39,400 --> 02:25:42,060
theater at the, at the, at the boobies is what they were.

2873
02:25:42,060 --> 02:25:43,060
They were the domes.

2874
02:25:43,060 --> 02:25:44,060
So we all call them the boobies.

2875
02:25:44,060 --> 02:25:47,560
So he took me to the boobies to go see, uh, the wizard.

2876
02:25:47,560 --> 02:25:48,560
Yes.

2877
02:25:48,560 --> 02:25:50,040
So the wizard came out 30 years ago.

2878
02:25:50,040 --> 02:25:51,040
They're having their anniversary.

2879
02:25:51,040 --> 02:25:56,360
Um, coming, they have a 30th anniversary edition is coming out in blue Ray, uh, set the launch

2880
02:25:56,360 --> 02:25:58,720
February, 2020.

2881
02:25:58,720 --> 02:26:05,440
And don't know what special features are going to be on there, but it'll be so rad.

2882
02:26:05,440 --> 02:26:07,400
You think we'd get something like deleted scenes?

2883
02:26:07,400 --> 02:26:09,280
Maybe the power glove edition.

2884
02:26:09,280 --> 02:26:10,280
Hmm.

2885
02:26:10,280 --> 02:26:11,280
I don't know.

2886
02:26:11,280 --> 02:26:15,560
Oh, wouldn't that be cool if the case was like a power glove type of thing?

2887
02:26:15,560 --> 02:26:16,560
I don't know.

2888
02:26:16,560 --> 02:26:17,560
Maybe there's some, probably not.

2889
02:26:17,560 --> 02:26:19,000
There's still be trademarks and copyrights.

2890
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:20,000
Yeah.

2891
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:21,000
Maybe.

2892
02:26:21,960 --> 02:26:24,640
But yeah, it, it was, it was such a big commercial for Nintendo products.

2893
02:26:24,640 --> 02:26:29,120
It was, or as a saying in their chat room, uh, Bobby Blackwell says the super Mario brothers

2894
02:26:29,120 --> 02:26:33,400
three and Nintendo direct orange right says the first Nintendo direct ever.

2895
02:26:33,400 --> 02:26:34,400
Yeah.

2896
02:26:34,400 --> 02:26:35,400
Pretty much pretty much.

2897
02:26:35,400 --> 02:26:39,440
Uh, and Bobby is also saying, I saw it in theaters twice just to watch the super Mario

2898
02:26:39,440 --> 02:26:40,440
brothers three portion.

2899
02:26:40,440 --> 02:26:47,000
Again, I, I sat there, I brought a notepad to write down things to take notes about super

2900
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:48,000
Mario brothers three.

2901
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:49,000
Oh no.

2902
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:50,640
And a downer message from Bobby.

2903
02:26:50,680 --> 02:26:54,800
I forgot about this sad that the guy who played Lucas became a registered sex offender.

2904
02:26:54,800 --> 02:26:55,800
Oh yeah.

2905
02:26:55,800 --> 02:26:56,800
I heard about that too.

2906
02:26:56,800 --> 02:26:57,800
Thanks.

2907
02:26:57,800 --> 02:27:04,000
I guess we solved that problem then of who it was that touched her breasts.

2908
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,720
I'm just, I don't want anything to do with that joke.

2909
02:27:06,720 --> 02:27:09,320
I'm just gonna move right into the next story.

2910
02:27:09,320 --> 02:27:11,040
Well, great, great.

2911
02:27:11,040 --> 02:27:15,120
And then here's, here's the story I saved for last boil boy.

2912
02:27:15,120 --> 02:27:18,120
This is a show that's going to generate some emails.

2913
02:27:18,120 --> 02:27:25,400
Um, the, uh, headline here on VG 24 seven is over 1 million people have wanked off to

2914
02:27:25,400 --> 02:27:28,620
border lands on porn hub during launch week.

2915
02:27:28,620 --> 02:27:29,620
That's right.

2916
02:27:29,620 --> 02:27:32,560
People are watching border lands porn on porn hub.

2917
02:27:32,560 --> 02:27:37,440
A 1 million people search for border lands porn in five days.

2918
02:27:37,440 --> 02:27:43,720
That's an increase of 12,905% of who is looking for border lands porn the day before.

2919
02:27:43,720 --> 02:27:49,320
See that porn hub being the social savvy company that they are actually went out and

2920
02:27:49,320 --> 02:27:53,520
made a graphic for what people are searching for.

2921
02:27:53,520 --> 02:27:58,320
By the way, border lands five times more popular than Fortnite and three times more popular

2922
02:27:58,320 --> 02:28:00,200
than overwatch.

2923
02:28:00,200 --> 02:28:03,680
Would you like to hear some of the searches people have been doing on porn hub?

2924
02:28:03,680 --> 02:28:04,680
Yes.

2925
02:28:04,680 --> 02:28:10,520
Border lands three border lands, moxie, border lands, two border lands, hentai, border lands,

2926
02:28:10,520 --> 02:28:15,760
Lilith, border lands, cosplay, border lands, and pretty much every character in the game,

2927
02:28:15,760 --> 02:28:19,520
tales from the border lands and so on and so on.

2928
02:28:19,520 --> 02:28:23,120
Porn hub actually wrote a blog post about it saying the most popular border land search

2929
02:28:23,120 --> 02:28:28,640
is border lands three followed by border lands, moxie, a search demographic show that men

2930
02:28:28,640 --> 02:28:36,720
are 84% more likely to search border lands than women and visitors age 18 to 24 are 119%

2931
02:28:36,720 --> 02:28:41,240
more likely to search when compared to all other age groups.

2932
02:28:41,240 --> 02:28:42,640
Fascinating.

2933
02:28:42,640 --> 02:28:52,000
The people most likely to search for porn on Pandora are also likely to search for hentai.

2934
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:53,000
That's it.

2935
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:54,000
That's the tweet.

2936
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,720
People are searching for border lands porn on porn hub.

2937
02:28:56,720 --> 02:28:57,720
Thanks, Valve.

2938
02:28:57,720 --> 02:28:59,760
Why are you saying thanks, Valve?

2939
02:28:59,760 --> 02:29:02,440
Because most of that shit was made with Valve's source filmmaker.

2940
02:29:02,440 --> 02:29:03,440
Source filmmaker.

2941
02:29:03,440 --> 02:29:06,080
You can't even buy the fucking game on Steam.

2942
02:29:06,440 --> 02:29:10,560
No, but they use that for all sorts of like naughty videos.

2943
02:29:10,560 --> 02:29:16,240
All your Overwatch shit, all your, you know, border lands stuff.

2944
02:29:16,240 --> 02:29:17,240
Source filmmaker.

2945
02:29:17,240 --> 02:29:21,800
Anyhow, I'm so glad we could end on that note.

2946
02:29:21,800 --> 02:29:24,640
Maybe we'll see if there's last minute stories later on in the show.

2947
02:29:24,640 --> 02:29:27,960
But it's that time of the show where we're going to take your calls and some of your

2948
02:29:27,960 --> 02:29:28,960
questions from Discord.

2949
02:29:28,960 --> 02:29:33,040
If you have any questions for us, you can put those in our Twitch channel right now.

2950
02:29:33,040 --> 02:29:34,400
Twitch.tv slash vog network.

2951
02:29:34,400 --> 02:29:38,040
But we actually do have a call waiting to come be on the show tonight.

2952
02:29:38,040 --> 02:29:40,720
So let's go to the Discord server and say hello.

2953
02:29:40,720 --> 02:29:41,720
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

2954
02:29:41,720 --> 02:29:42,720
Who's this?

2955
02:29:42,720 --> 02:29:43,720
It's Shane.

2956
02:29:43,720 --> 02:29:44,720
Hey, Shane.

2957
02:29:44,720 --> 02:29:45,720
It's good to hear from you.

2958
02:29:45,720 --> 02:29:46,720
What's up?

2959
02:29:46,720 --> 02:29:49,800
I wanted to talk about the best game of the year.

2960
02:29:49,800 --> 02:29:50,800
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2961
02:29:50,800 --> 02:29:55,240
Before you do that, you have to tell the story about how you crossed state lines to capture

2962
02:29:55,240 --> 02:29:56,240
Pokemon.

2963
02:29:56,240 --> 02:29:57,560
Oh, okay.

2964
02:29:57,560 --> 02:30:03,760
So we already heard the story of how Oshawa is my favorite Pokemon and is the best Pokemon

2965
02:30:03,760 --> 02:30:08,640
how I wanted it and go like, I wanted as many as I could possibly get.

2966
02:30:08,640 --> 02:30:14,920
So there weren't any easy ways around where I live to get one.

2967
02:30:14,920 --> 02:30:21,000
But according to our local area group, there was one at a nest at a park about an hour

2968
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:24,160
away for like, cool, let's go get it.

2969
02:30:24,160 --> 02:30:29,760
So we just typed the name of the park into GPS.

2970
02:30:29,760 --> 02:30:36,720
And we just drove and when we got there, so, like, it was just this little town with a

2971
02:30:36,720 --> 02:30:40,240
park and we're driving through this little town.

2972
02:30:40,240 --> 02:30:47,560
And I saw, like a pot dispensary, I'm like, wait, Idaho doesn't have that.

2973
02:30:47,560 --> 02:30:51,880
And then I started looking at the buildings and one of them said, like, the name of the

2974
02:30:51,880 --> 02:30:52,880
city, Oregon.

2975
02:30:52,880 --> 02:30:57,160
And I'm like, Oh, we went to a different state.

2976
02:30:57,160 --> 02:31:01,240
So only you would kidnap oshawats and take them across state lines after

2977
02:31:01,240 --> 02:31:04,240
Yeah, I only got five.

2978
02:31:04,240 --> 02:31:06,480
So I didn't take I didn't kidnap a whole bunch.

2979
02:31:06,480 --> 02:31:12,080
Yeah, that that nest that I basically helped you cheat to get in Elk Grove was kind of

2980
02:31:12,080 --> 02:31:14,000
better even though it's kind of slow like that.

2981
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:18,920
Well, you know that park right for the I guess yeah, because for the listeners, yeah, I used

2982
02:31:18,920 --> 02:31:20,240
to hunt there.

2983
02:31:20,240 --> 02:31:24,800
This park is like four, but was some like there was like two stops there that were new

2984
02:31:24,800 --> 02:31:25,800
to you.

2985
02:31:25,800 --> 02:31:27,240
So there's clearly added things.

2986
02:31:27,240 --> 02:31:32,320
But anyway, this is one of those like sports parks is like four baseball diamonds big.

2987
02:31:32,320 --> 02:31:35,240
And you have to like walk around the mall to get all the stops.

2988
02:31:35,240 --> 02:31:36,240
It's crazy big.

2989
02:31:36,240 --> 02:31:37,240
So yeah.

2990
02:31:37,240 --> 02:31:38,240
All right.

2991
02:31:38,240 --> 02:31:41,600
What do you really want to call in about tonight?

2992
02:31:41,600 --> 02:31:47,760
The best game of the year untitled goose game.

2993
02:31:47,760 --> 02:31:48,760
Untitled goose game.

2994
02:31:48,760 --> 02:31:50,160
Just waiting for you to pull it up.

2995
02:31:50,160 --> 02:31:51,160
There it is.

2996
02:31:51,160 --> 02:31:52,160
Okay.

2997
02:31:52,160 --> 02:31:53,160
There.

2998
02:31:53,160 --> 02:31:54,160
There's a shame trust that I'm on it.

2999
02:31:54,160 --> 02:31:55,160
Yes.

3000
02:31:55,160 --> 02:31:56,160
Uh huh.

3001
02:31:56,160 --> 02:32:01,040
Um, so I bought this game, not knowing anything about it, except that you were a goose.

3002
02:32:01,040 --> 02:32:03,200
And I was like, well, that's really enough for me.

3003
02:32:03,200 --> 02:32:06,720
I don't really need much more information than that.

3004
02:32:06,720 --> 02:32:15,640
And what I got was a hilarious puzzle stealth game that I laughed so hard playing it.

3005
02:32:15,640 --> 02:32:21,520
I don't remember playing a game where I laughed this hard in a long, long time.

3006
02:32:21,520 --> 02:32:22,520
Random ass segment.

3007
02:32:22,520 --> 02:32:25,360
We're watching on the Twitch feed right now.

3008
02:32:25,360 --> 02:32:29,240
The goose like honked at this guy until he fell over and his glasses fell off.

3009
02:32:29,240 --> 02:32:32,440
The goose went over, picked up the glasses and ran away like a little bitch.

3010
02:32:32,440 --> 02:32:33,440
Yeah.

3011
02:32:33,440 --> 02:32:34,440
No.

3012
02:32:34,440 --> 02:32:35,440
Well you do that.

3013
02:32:35,440 --> 02:32:37,040
So you're the little bitch.

3014
02:32:37,040 --> 02:32:38,040
It's not the goose.

3015
02:32:38,040 --> 02:32:40,040
What'd you call me?

3016
02:32:40,040 --> 02:32:41,560
Well, whatever.

3017
02:32:41,560 --> 02:32:42,560
It's fine.

3018
02:32:43,560 --> 02:32:53,000
But no, it gave me the same amount of happiness that I got when I first played Katamari Damacy.

3019
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,000
It was just amazing.

3020
02:32:55,000 --> 02:33:04,800
And there's nothing really fancy or spectacular about this game, but it's fun.

3021
02:33:04,800 --> 02:33:10,600
I feel like I know what it's like to be a goose now because they're just jerks and that's

3022
02:33:10,600 --> 02:33:12,480
all you do in this game is be a jerk.

3023
02:33:12,480 --> 02:33:13,480
And I love it.

3024
02:33:13,480 --> 02:33:16,200
I'm glad you said it so I didn't have to.

3025
02:33:16,200 --> 02:33:22,560
Yeah, but it's not very long and it's on sale right now for 15 instead of 20, which was

3026
02:33:22,560 --> 02:33:25,720
also a nice little bonus.

3027
02:33:25,720 --> 02:33:30,640
But you're given like a set of tasks for each area.

3028
02:33:30,640 --> 02:33:36,280
And once you complete a certain amount of tasks, which is almost always the whole list

3029
02:33:36,280 --> 02:33:40,600
or close to it rather, you get to go on to another area.

3030
02:33:40,600 --> 02:33:46,880
And there's only four areas, I believe, four main areas at least.

3031
02:33:46,880 --> 02:33:52,640
And I beat the game in as hard of quote marks as I can use with my fingers.

3032
02:33:52,640 --> 02:33:57,440
But after you beat it and you go through the credits, you're given a whole other list of

3033
02:33:57,440 --> 02:33:58,440
tasks.

3034
02:33:58,440 --> 02:34:02,400
And I don't know if it opens up more areas because I stopped playing that and we were

3035
02:34:02,400 --> 02:34:07,680
showing Dustin's coworker, Sayonara Wild Hearts.

3036
02:34:07,680 --> 02:34:14,080
So Sayonara Wild Hearts.

3037
02:34:14,080 --> 02:34:16,860
So I don't know, maybe there's like a lot of replayability.

3038
02:34:16,860 --> 02:34:18,140
I want a second game.

3039
02:34:18,140 --> 02:34:19,920
I want DLC.

3040
02:34:19,920 --> 02:34:24,160
I don't want to be a different goose, though, because this goose is the best one.

3041
02:34:24,160 --> 02:34:27,120
Sorry, I'm laughing at the video.

3042
02:34:27,120 --> 02:34:30,160
He just he just snatched those paper towels right back from her.

3043
02:34:30,160 --> 02:34:34,120
Yeah, you have to do this sort of stuff like you have to get creative.

3044
02:34:34,120 --> 02:34:39,720
I had to get this guy's hat and I couldn't reach his head.

3045
02:34:39,720 --> 02:34:49,240
So I had to like, put something that he would pick up that I had moved over by like a mound

3046
02:34:49,240 --> 02:34:50,240
of dirt.

3047
02:34:50,240 --> 02:34:53,800
And I just stood there waiting for him to go pick it up and I snatched his hat and ran

3048
02:34:53,800 --> 02:34:54,920
away with it.

3049
02:34:54,920 --> 02:34:55,920
It was great.

3050
02:34:55,920 --> 02:34:58,880
Okay, I'm running out of b rolls, I gotta go back to the studio.

3051
02:34:58,880 --> 02:34:59,880
But that's fine.

3052
02:34:59,880 --> 02:35:02,000
I mean, the game does look hilarious.

3053
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:05,200
Again, there were a lot of good games that came out this week.

3054
02:35:05,200 --> 02:35:08,600
And I think most people are fixated on Link's Awakening, which I get it.

3055
02:35:08,600 --> 02:35:09,600
It's fine.

3056
02:35:09,600 --> 02:35:10,600
It's a great game.

3057
02:35:10,600 --> 02:35:11,600
That should be one of the games you're playing.

3058
02:35:11,600 --> 02:35:15,400
But like, you know, there's these other great releases that came out and I know Shane is

3059
02:35:15,400 --> 02:35:17,040
all about the Untitled Goose Game.

3060
02:35:17,040 --> 02:35:21,920
I'm all about Sayonara Wild Hearts and honestly, I'll probably like the goose game too.

3061
02:35:21,920 --> 02:35:24,360
And Shane, you like Sayonara Wild Hearts, right?

3062
02:35:24,360 --> 02:35:26,080
Yeah, I haven't played it a lot.

3063
02:35:26,080 --> 02:35:27,080
I watched it mostly.

3064
02:35:27,080 --> 02:35:32,360
But when I did play, I was trying to do those riddles.

3065
02:35:32,360 --> 02:35:34,320
And it was fun.

3066
02:35:34,320 --> 02:35:36,240
It's just 80s nonsense.

3067
02:35:36,240 --> 02:35:43,040
And 80s nonsense is a great way to describe this game, quite honestly.

3068
02:35:43,040 --> 02:35:44,120
Yeah.

3069
02:35:44,120 --> 02:35:47,720
But it's not better than Untitled Goose Game and we picked up Zelda.

3070
02:35:47,720 --> 02:35:51,840
I haven't even opened it yet because I'm like, these games are way too fun.

3071
02:35:51,840 --> 02:35:55,320
I don't even care about Zelda right now.

3072
02:35:55,800 --> 02:35:58,080
Yeah, it's a busy week.

3073
02:35:58,080 --> 02:36:01,800
And then on top of all that, it's like, oh, and I've got to play Final Fantasy 14 as well

3074
02:36:01,800 --> 02:36:04,280
and all my MMOs and all that stuff too.

3075
02:36:04,280 --> 02:36:06,760
So it's been a week.

3076
02:36:06,760 --> 02:36:07,760
Yeah.

3077
02:36:07,760 --> 02:36:14,080
But I suggest anybody that even liked that footage, the littlest bit, it's so much better

3078
02:36:14,080 --> 02:36:15,080
than that.

3079
02:36:15,080 --> 02:36:17,280
I locked a lady in a garage.

3080
02:36:17,280 --> 02:36:19,640
Like that's how great this game is.

3081
02:36:19,640 --> 02:36:21,120
That's awesome.

3082
02:36:21,120 --> 02:36:23,440
So it's on sale right now.

3083
02:36:23,440 --> 02:36:25,020
Go get it.

3084
02:36:25,020 --> 02:36:26,020
You won't be disappointed.

3085
02:36:26,020 --> 02:36:32,180
All right, quickly, before I let you go, the last Pokemon Community Day that we had was

3086
02:36:32,180 --> 02:36:33,740
Turtwig, right?

3087
02:36:33,740 --> 02:36:34,740
Yeah.

3088
02:36:34,740 --> 02:36:37,440
How many shiny Turtwigs did you pick up?

3089
02:36:37,440 --> 02:36:38,440
Not that many.

3090
02:36:38,440 --> 02:36:42,340
It was not a great time yet again.

3091
02:36:42,340 --> 02:36:45,240
I think it was under 10.

3092
02:36:45,240 --> 02:36:47,260
So I just didn't care either.

3093
02:36:47,260 --> 02:36:48,260
It was Turtwig.

3094
02:36:48,260 --> 02:36:52,620
This might have been the first Community Day ever I got more than you.

3095
02:36:52,620 --> 02:36:57,900
Well, I'm literally looking right now just to make sure and I didn't trade any so I should

3096
02:36:57,900 --> 02:37:00,680
see one.

3097
02:37:00,680 --> 02:37:02,460
I got 10 exactly.

3098
02:37:02,460 --> 02:37:03,780
All right.

3099
02:37:03,780 --> 02:37:04,780
Yeah.

3100
02:37:04,780 --> 02:37:05,780
All right.

3101
02:37:05,780 --> 02:37:09,740
I'll just wait till next June when Oshawott should have his Community Day.

3102
02:37:09,740 --> 02:37:12,060
So Oh, and it's on.

3103
02:37:12,060 --> 02:37:18,040
I see in chat what systems it's on switch, Mac and Windows.

3104
02:37:18,040 --> 02:37:19,500
And I think that's it.

3105
02:37:19,500 --> 02:37:22,060
Is it an Epic Store exclusive because I see their feature?

3106
02:37:22,060 --> 02:37:23,060
It is.

3107
02:37:23,060 --> 02:37:24,060
Yeah.

3108
02:37:24,060 --> 02:37:25,060
Boy.

3109
02:37:25,060 --> 02:37:26,060
There they go again.

3110
02:37:26,060 --> 02:37:27,060
All right.

3111
02:37:27,060 --> 02:37:28,060
All right.

3112
02:37:28,060 --> 02:37:29,060
Well, Shane, thanks for the call.

3113
02:37:29,060 --> 02:37:32,240
I'm glad you know, since we missed it, you know, Loki and I weren't able to play the

3114
02:37:32,240 --> 02:37:33,240
game this week.

3115
02:37:33,240 --> 02:37:34,900
I'm glad somebody did and talk to us about it.

3116
02:37:34,900 --> 02:37:36,460
So I will definitely check it out.

3117
02:37:36,460 --> 02:37:38,700
I guess I'll have to pick it up while it's still on sale.

3118
02:37:38,700 --> 02:37:40,580
There is also another game I was going to mention.

3119
02:37:40,580 --> 02:37:44,560
I haven't got a chance to play it yet, but I know it also came out this week as well

3120
02:37:44,560 --> 02:37:50,380
as what the golf and that one looked funny to what's that one about briefly.

3121
02:37:50,600 --> 02:37:53,660
It's like a it's like a golf game, but it's it's strange.

3122
02:37:53,660 --> 02:37:58,380
Each level is not necessarily like how you normally play golf.

3123
02:37:58,380 --> 02:38:00,620
And it's just like the Kirby golf game.

3124
02:38:00,620 --> 02:38:02,200
No, it's very different.

3125
02:38:02,200 --> 02:38:04,380
Like I seriously, you know, definitely go check it out.

3126
02:38:04,380 --> 02:38:08,060
Like there's one level that there's a bunch of people where you're a soccer ball and a

3127
02:38:08,060 --> 02:38:10,860
bunch of people are trying to kick you off a cliff or something like that.

3128
02:38:10,860 --> 02:38:12,300
And you're trying to get to the goal.

3129
02:38:12,300 --> 02:38:14,260
It is just a really weird game.

3130
02:38:14,260 --> 02:38:15,260
All right.

3131
02:38:15,260 --> 02:38:17,740
That's also coming out on switch and PC.

3132
02:38:17,740 --> 02:38:18,740
OK.

3133
02:38:18,820 --> 02:38:23,420
Before I go, I do want to say one more thing about that amazing game of the year that I

3134
02:38:23,420 --> 02:38:24,420
play.

3135
02:38:24,420 --> 02:38:27,820
OK, so because there's no spoilers in this game because you're given your tasks.

3136
02:38:27,820 --> 02:38:30,840
So one of them is you have to get a ribbon on you.

3137
02:38:30,840 --> 02:38:36,700
And the only way to get a ribbon is to steal a ceramic duck, go hide it somewhere and then

3138
02:38:36,700 --> 02:38:41,220
go pose as the duck until the lady comes and puts a ribbon on you.

3139
02:38:41,220 --> 02:38:43,680
I thought that was hilarious.

3140
02:38:43,680 --> 02:38:44,680
That's pretty good.

3141
02:38:44,680 --> 02:38:47,860
It sounds like the type of game that you did you like because you mentioned like you've

3142
02:38:47,860 --> 02:38:51,060
been hanging out with your hubby and coworker and stuff like that.

3143
02:38:51,060 --> 02:38:52,060
Were you all playing it together?

3144
02:38:52,060 --> 02:38:53,060
Just laughing.

3145
02:38:53,060 --> 02:38:54,620
It's probably that game that's like funnier in groups.

3146
02:38:54,620 --> 02:38:58,300
Yeah, it was just me and Dustin for most of it.

3147
02:38:58,300 --> 02:39:04,820
And then his coworker came over and we just all kind of played through the last stage

3148
02:39:04,820 --> 02:39:06,660
and it was hilarious.

3149
02:39:06,660 --> 02:39:08,020
All right.

3150
02:39:08,020 --> 02:39:09,820
All right, Shane.

3151
02:39:09,820 --> 02:39:13,300
If you don't have anything else, I'm gonna let you go for now and we'll talk to you later.

3152
02:39:13,300 --> 02:39:14,300
OK.

3153
02:39:14,300 --> 02:39:15,300
Bye bye.

3154
02:39:15,300 --> 02:39:16,300
All right.

3155
02:39:17,020 --> 02:39:19,100
I don't know if we have to have any last minute story.

3156
02:39:19,100 --> 02:39:20,100
There's nobody else in the green room.

3157
02:39:20,100 --> 02:39:21,420
So I don't know if we have any last minute stories.

3158
02:39:21,420 --> 02:39:24,740
It did seem like it was kind of a slower Newsweek this week, didn't it?

3159
02:39:24,740 --> 02:39:25,940
Yeah, it was pretty slow.

3160
02:39:25,940 --> 02:39:28,220
Like I was looking for stuff and just me.

3161
02:39:28,220 --> 02:39:32,560
Yeah, I know it's almost everybody's playing games with all the stuff that's out there

3162
02:39:32,560 --> 02:39:33,560
to play this week.

3163
02:39:33,560 --> 02:39:34,560
So.

3164
02:39:34,560 --> 02:39:35,560
All right.

3165
02:39:35,560 --> 02:39:36,560
Well, I guess we're going to get everybody's final thoughts and then we're going to wrap

3166
02:39:36,560 --> 02:39:37,560
up.

3167
02:39:37,560 --> 02:39:40,100
By the way, if you are watching live on Twitch, we're going to do the giveaway from the community

3168
02:39:40,100 --> 02:39:42,260
chest one more time during the credits.

3169
02:39:42,260 --> 02:39:47,680
So stay tuned because you might win something and chances are pretty good to actually just

3170
02:39:47,680 --> 02:39:52,940
like because literally everybody who didn't already have it got one and there were still

3171
02:39:52,940 --> 02:39:54,400
like 13 left.

3172
02:39:54,400 --> 02:39:55,400
So yeah.

3173
02:39:55,400 --> 02:39:56,400
Sit tight.

3174
02:39:56,400 --> 02:39:58,620
If you don't have a Twitch Prime thing, you're going to get this Dauntless thing.

3175
02:39:58,620 --> 02:40:02,900
I could see how many viewers we have and it's not as so many that will probably still have

3176
02:40:02,900 --> 02:40:06,140
some gifts left over that we'll have to use in the middle of the week or something.

3177
02:40:06,140 --> 02:40:07,180
I don't know.

3178
02:40:07,180 --> 02:40:09,900
But anyway, I do want to start to wrap up here.

3179
02:40:09,900 --> 02:40:14,220
Thank you, of course, for tuning into Orange Andrado tonight and for participating with

3180
02:40:14,220 --> 02:40:15,220
the show.

3181
02:40:15,220 --> 02:40:16,220
Really appreciate it.

3182
02:40:16,220 --> 02:40:19,260
If you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Andrado, please tell a friend or two about

3183
02:40:19,260 --> 02:40:20,260
the show.

3184
02:40:20,260 --> 02:40:22,700
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

3185
02:40:22,700 --> 02:40:26,680
But if the voices aren't here in our green room waiting to call, how can we get those

3186
02:40:26,680 --> 02:40:27,980
voices out there?

3187
02:40:27,980 --> 02:40:29,780
We need more in our chat and so forth.

3188
02:40:29,780 --> 02:40:32,020
So really appreciate the raids and all that stuff.

3189
02:40:32,020 --> 02:40:33,020
That's really awesome.

3190
02:40:33,020 --> 02:40:35,060
Thank you so much for that.

3191
02:40:35,060 --> 02:40:39,380
And I also want to say a big thanks for that.

3192
02:40:39,380 --> 02:40:43,100
And those of you that do the auto hosting as well on Twitch, all that hosting and stuff

3193
02:40:43,100 --> 02:40:44,380
goes a very long way.

3194
02:40:44,380 --> 02:40:49,100
I will acknowledge some more specifics after the credits as I usually do.

3195
02:40:49,100 --> 02:40:51,780
In the meantime, it's about that time to get everybody's final thoughts.

3196
02:40:51,780 --> 02:40:53,980
We'll be back in seven days to do this all over again.

3197
02:40:53,980 --> 02:40:55,660
Dark Soccer should be back with us.

3198
02:40:55,660 --> 02:41:00,420
I know she's been playing an awful lot of Link's Awakening and her and Dan are further

3199
02:41:00,420 --> 02:41:01,420
in the game than I am.

3200
02:41:01,420 --> 02:41:02,740
So they probably have a lot to say about it.

3201
02:41:02,740 --> 02:41:04,480
I know they're going to want to talk about it as well.

3202
02:41:04,480 --> 02:41:06,980
So we'll get into that in the next week.

3203
02:41:07,580 --> 02:41:09,700
Meanwhile, we're about here to close up shop.

3204
02:41:09,700 --> 02:41:12,220
So Loki, any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

3205
02:41:12,220 --> 02:41:16,340
I have to play Untitled Goose Game this week and then just work on my game.

3206
02:41:16,340 --> 02:41:17,340
Yeah.

3207
02:41:17,340 --> 02:41:18,340
I want to see.

3208
02:41:18,340 --> 02:41:19,340
I saw like I peeked over your shoulder.

3209
02:41:19,340 --> 02:41:20,500
I saw a little bit of your game.

3210
02:41:20,500 --> 02:41:24,180
It looked like the yeah, you've got like walls and it looks pretty legit.

3211
02:41:24,180 --> 02:41:25,180
Yeah.

3212
02:41:25,180 --> 02:41:26,180
The walls and stuff.

3213
02:41:26,180 --> 02:41:30,260
I just I updated because I deleted my arena that I was in.

3214
02:41:30,260 --> 02:41:34,380
So I re updated everything because it's built out of tiles now.

3215
02:41:34,380 --> 02:41:38,780
And so I had to rebuild everything.

3216
02:41:38,780 --> 02:41:41,620
I have an error, though, so I can't actually play it at the moment.

3217
02:41:41,620 --> 02:41:43,860
I have to fix whatever it is.

3218
02:41:43,860 --> 02:41:44,860
It's something that was working.

3219
02:41:44,860 --> 02:41:47,660
I think when I was taking stuff out, I did a bug fixing.

3220
02:41:47,660 --> 02:41:48,660
Yes.

3221
02:41:48,660 --> 02:41:49,660
That's part of making a game, right?

3222
02:41:49,660 --> 02:41:50,660
Yeah.

3223
02:41:50,660 --> 02:41:52,660
Well, I look forward to being able to play your game at some point.

3224
02:41:52,660 --> 02:41:53,820
All right.

3225
02:41:53,820 --> 02:41:58,100
And my final thought tonight is, oh, busy.

3226
02:41:58,100 --> 02:42:02,260
It's going to be a very busy week and weekend and very busy for the next couple weeks.

3227
02:42:02,260 --> 02:42:05,180
But I hope I get to squeeze in some great game playing myself.

3228
02:42:05,180 --> 02:42:10,300
I still want to get further in Link's Awakening and I got to play this goose game as well

3229
02:42:10,300 --> 02:42:13,380
for myself and whatever else is going to come out in the next couple of weeks.

3230
02:42:13,380 --> 02:42:15,020
It's a great time to be a gamer.

3231
02:42:15,020 --> 02:42:18,140
So that's going to do it for another night here at Orange Lounge Radio.

3232
02:42:18,140 --> 02:42:21,180
