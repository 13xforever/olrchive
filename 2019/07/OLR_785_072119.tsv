7000	14000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	22000	This week Google clarifies that Stadia's Pro subscription gives you an ever-growing library of games, a direct comparison to Xbox Live Gold, PlayStation Plus, and Nintendo Switch Online.
22000	27000	The more things change, the more things stay the same, just like this episode of the show where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	37000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	45000	It is Orange Lounge Radio Live once again tonight with episode number 785 for this July the 21st of 2019.
45000	56000	My name is Rob Roberts joining you here in our lovely studio N7 based in Sacramento, California and with me as always for the past 785 weeks.
57000	60000	Give or take. Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
60000	61000	Sup.
61000	63000	Not on camera tonight because she doesn't want to be.
63000	76000	Well I can be on camera. I've got very nice makeup today although I am, well I'll just go ahead and say I'm fighting off what may possibly be a staph infection on my face.
76000	77000	Yikes.
77000	87000	Because I punch too many people in blood splatter, you know, it carries pathogens and, you know, either that or I have the flesh eating bacteria, you know.
87000	89000	Well I hope it's not that. I hope you didn't bring that into my house.
89000	90000	No.
90000	91000	Give it to my cat.
91000	92000	I didn't.
92000	93000	Alright.
93000	96000	I washed my hands before I, you know, harassed your cat against his will.
96000	100000	Good, good. I'm glad you are exercising good hygiene.
100000	101000	Hi.
101000	104000	We'll talk, there you go. I love it when you say hello to the listeners there.
104000	107000	Also I'm going to have different hair coming Thursday.
107000	111000	Good. Because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of the Geeks Network.
111000	116000	vognetwork.com. 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
116000	119000	And although I gave you the main website there, vognetwork.com.
119000	124000	It's just going to take you over to our Twitch channel which of course is twitch.tv slash vognetwork.
124000	126000	So there it is.
126000	129000	And of course who you do see on camera, Techmaster Loki right over there.
129000	130000	Hello.
130000	131000	Hi, how are you?
131000	132000	I'm good.
132000	133000	I heard you did laser tag the sequel today.
133000	134000	Yes.
134000	136000	More laser. I actually saw the laser tag place.
136000	139000	I was out over there. Oh God, I was, okay, this is funny.
139000	141000	I was with my Ingress buddies.
141000	142000	Yeah.
142000	144000	But we weren't playing Ingress, we were playing Harry Potter, Wizards Unite.
144000	149000	And we were over there at the little restaurant that's like right across the street.
149000	153000	And we saw the laser. Oh, that's the place Loki's talking about.
153000	154000	Yes.
154000	156000	Yeah. So it looks, it does look new. It looks fancy and new.
157000	165000	And it is funny because there's, um, the packs in there, instead of having like numbers and colors to remember, they have names to them.
165000	172000	And so all the names are like, you know, like just generic call sign names, but one of them is Loki that I found out.
172000	175000	So I was like, I'm picking that one.
175000	181000	And then that one ended up sucking. So then I just picked a different one the next time, but I got the one game as Loki.
181000	182000	That's funny.
182000	185000	How do you feel that you're getting a new Marvel TV series named after you?
185000	186000	I don't know if you heard the name.
186000	187000	Oh yeah, I'm totally down.
187000	188000	Yeah.
188000	189000	Yeah.
189000	190000	I wish you'd pick a damn font.
190000	192000	Now all of them.
192000	193000	Wait, wait, wait.
193000	196000	Dark soccer is the one that actually like went to school to do design.
196000	198000	Did you see the logo for the new Loki show?
198000	200000	Cause you know, they're doing a new Loki show, Marvel show.
200000	201000	Yeah, I saw it.
201000	208000	I, it makes sense actually, because when you have a character who is a shape shifter and takes different aspects.
208000	211000	Why do you have to bring logic and reason into this?
211000	213000	It is a legitimately good design choice.
213000	215000	Why can't you be hateful like the rest of us on the internet?
215000	217000	Comic Sans is shit.
217000	218000	Papyrus is shit.
218000	219000	Okay.
219000	221000	And if you use them, you should be ashamed.
221000	222000	Unless you're dyslexic.
222000	224000	Cause actually Comic Sans is good for dyslexic people.
224000	225000	Okay.
225000	226000	Okay.
226000	227000	I learned something today.
227000	228000	The more you know.
228000	233000	Although I always, every time there's this font out there called Comic Papyrus and it always makes me think of dark soccer.
233000	235000	I'm always like, what mug am I going to make?
235000	240000	There is one I downloaded on purpose that was absolutely hilarious called Comic Slab.
240000	242000	You know what a slab serif is?
242000	245000	Like it's the Western font with the big thick.
245000	246000	Oh, like a wanted poster or something?
246000	247000	Kind of. Yeah.
247000	249000	Those are, those are called slab serifs.
249000	250000	Okay.
250000	253000	And so there's someone made one called Comic Slab.
253000	255000	It is fucking hilarious.
255000	261000	You know, uh, Bobby and I have been chatting about trying to make sure the merchandise stuff starts happening before we get out to Dragon Con.
261000	262000	Hope I'm not saying too much.
262000	263000	Oops.
263000	271000	But I do think it would be hilarious to get a vog network mug that's, or something, something maybe about like dark soccer, but it's actually written in Comic Papyrus.
272000	273000	Something like that.
273000	275000	Who do I have to murder?
277000	278000	Only her name. All the other ones.
278000	282000	Yeah. Oh yeah. That'd be like, like I could have like a pretty Rob Roberts mug.
282000	286000	Y'all are going to be Helvetica. Boring as shit. And I get to be extra.
286000	290000	But, but versatile. And you will get to be Papyrus.
291000	292000	I'm going to cut a bitch.
292000	293000	All right. Anyway.
293000	296000	Uh, we're here to talk over the next, uh.
296000	298000	About fonts. It's all font talk tonight.
299000	301000	Isn't that fun? Fun and Fonzie free.
301000	304000	Um, anyway, we're going to actually talk about video games for a little while.
304000	307000	So tonight's going to be a little different. It's actually a shorter show tonight.
307000	310000	We have planned, usually we do like two and a half, three hours.
310000	313000	I am going to be honest. Tonight is going to be a little bit shorter.
313000	314000	So here's why. Here's what happened.
314000	321000	Um, I got like kind of very short notice on Monday at my day job that they need me to go on a trip, uh, tomorrow.
321000	326000	So I am going to be going out to Chicago, uh, which is funny because I go there for personal stuff.
326000	332000	Cause Alan and I have friends out there, but just ironic, uh, work has an affiliated group out there too.
332000	336000	So I'm going to be heading out to Chicago, uh, for that and, uh, working.
336000	340000	So I'll be there Monday through Friday, but because of that, I have a seven 30 flight in the morning,
340000	343000	which means I have to be at the airport on a Monday morning at five.
343000	346000	So you see why we have to end the show a little earlier than we usually do tonight.
346000	349000	Cause, uh, I got to get up at like four 30 tomorrow.
349000	354000	And of course I still have to finish packing cause you know, that's a thing too.
354000	364000	So anyway, hopefully y'all understand, but, uh, you know, I'm looking forward to, uh, the trip, but it's just, you know, uh, so much other stuff going on.
364000	370000	So, and I'm trying to get some game playing done in there, but we'll talk a little bit about that as we start off.
370000	375000	How was your gaming week? We like to talk a little bit about the types of games that we've been playing this week.
375000	377000	So Darzagra, how was your gaming week?
377000	382000	Also for the sake of the chat room, I posted a link to my mentor, Steve Mahalo's blog.
382000	387000	Didn't we have him on the show once? Yeah, we did. We did, um, the Flom game. Yeah. Yeah. I remember that.
387000	394000	Um, so anyway, I posted, uh, that, but if you look up mahalo.com and then look up comic slab, you'll find the article about it.
394000	403000	Um, so I downloaded a game that I didn't get a chance to play, but I will be talking hopefully about it later in the show.
403000	408000	Let me check the show roll. Um, yeah, I will be talking about it later in the show, so I won't say anything yet.
408000	417000	Um, I've been playing Pokemon go. I've been playing Harry Potter. I've been, I'm still playing idle pouring, but now it's out of spite.
417000	424000	So I'm hate playing it. Um, and not really a whole bunch else.
424000	431000	Like Dan and I have been like obsessed with watching, uh, just, uh, uh, live streams of pinball lately.
431000	440000	So, um, the new, the star Wars home edition got released and we were watching a dead flip, uh, that guy play it.
440000	446000	His last name is danger and I don't remember his first name. Um, he's a cool dude though. Um, but we were watching him play it.
446000	451000	People are giving all kinds of crap for it. You know, Oh, it's a home version. It's missing all the stuff. The screen is small.
451000	460000	I'm like, dude, for what you get for the money, if you've got four grand to drop, it's not bad for a starter table for a home for something brand new.
460000	466000	Just saying. Um, but at any rate, um, and I played a little bit of theater magic and I played a little bit of twilight zone.
466000	472000	I've mostly been in pinball mode. So ever since I was a young girl, I played the silver ball.
472000	476000	There's nothing wrong with being in pinball mode. A friend came over today though.
476000	483000	And it was the first time she'd ever in person seen a pinball table. I'm like, how she's like, wow.
483000	490000	I was like, here, you want to play? She's like, I don't want to break it. Friend never get taken to like a Chuck E Cheese or a pizza.
490000	495000	That's what she said today. Wow. I'm like, you can play if you want to all break it.
495000	501000	I'm like, you should see the way these guys play it. Use them. Shake the table. Yeah. The fine art of not tilting.
501000	508000	So anyway, um, so yeah. Has anyone out there in chat ever like not seen a pinball table?
508000	513000	Like now I'm fascinated by this concept of like, it's okay. I'm not asking to make fun of you.
513000	518000	I just, I'm so curious. Uh, and of course we do tape live over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
518000	522000	And that's where you can join our chat room if you want to give feedback on the show or what have you.
522000	529000	And Bobby Blackwell says, even I don't like shaking pinball tables. Yeah, I don't, I don't like to do it too, but I'm more afraid of the tilt.
529000	535000	I slap them. That's the most I'll do. I'll slap them. Well, I have this picture saved and I'll put it up first.
535000	542000	You can see it, but I, I took a picture of the, of the almost tilt, like the danger for black night, um, sort of rage.
542000	550000	And it's really cool cause it's the night looking thing. It says danger. It was really cool. Um, but one last point about pinball, one little point.
550000	559000	Did you know that apparently, and I need someone in the UK to tell me this for sure, but apparently pinball table is the preferred way to refer to it instead of pinball machine.
559000	566000	But also, and I'm sure as Bobby can attest, a lot of us in the South or from the South called a pinball table too.
566000	573000	I've heard both. I didn't really, it's not, it's not like a pop and soda thing. Like I will not call it pop. In the South it's a coke.
573000	581000	And it's pronounced coke. Pop sounds like it's bubble gum. I hate that. That's like, that's like how some people really have an aversion to the word.
581000	592000	Bobby says the pinball coke, the pinball coke, the Coca Cola pinball. But at any, at any rate, um, you know, one of Dan's friends asked him if I was from Europe because I said pinball table.
592000	600000	Oh, interesting. Yeah. I'm like, no, but I'll move there because this country's kind of shit right now. Right. So anyway, anyway, I'm done.
600000	611000	All right. Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week? Um, I didn't play a whole lot. I just played or I worked a little bit on my game actually, um, coding it and stuff, but they get a whole ton done.
611000	618000	Cause I was, I've been pretty exhausted this week. I started like a new, this like exercise challenge thing at work.
618000	629000	So we've been doing these like high intensity, like you were talking about this because you had that whole bacon pizza the other week and you were like, it's my last meal to gain a bunch of weight that I can lose really fast on the work challenge.
629000	638000	Yes, exactly. So you were gaming the system already. Exactly. So, um, sort of, I'm down six pounds from when I ate that pizza.
638000	644000	So, but that's all like waterway. It goes up and down all the time, but I haven't exercised more. So I have been playing a little bit of Pokemon go.
644000	655000	Um, I can't find my charger for my gotcha. It's somewhere amongst my desk of junk right now. Um, so I haven't been playing too much Pokemon go, but a little bit.
655000	665000	And now that I've been walking and actually starting to run a little bit, which I hate running, but I do it anyways. Um, so I've been playing a little bit of that.
665000	674000	And what else? That's pretty much it. I was going, I was interested in picking up Marvel ultimate alliance three this weekend.
674000	685000	Um, but I was a GameStop and then they're like, well, we don't have when you can buy a digital copy from us. I'm like, why the fuck would I do that when I could just buy a digital copy through the switch?
685000	694000	I don't know what, why I would do that, sir. Help us be relevant still, please, sir. Like, well, you're not going to be a five because there's only two locations that have it nearby.
694000	710000	I'm like, there's like other stores, stupid. I mean like, I don't know. It's just silly, but I had to like look around because my son likes to spend like 40 minutes and they're playing the stupid demo for like the crash remaster or the Spyro remaster games.
710000	718000	I'm like, you know, we can just pick these up at home or like he's playing Zelda. I'm like, we have the full game at home. Why are you playing the demo?
719000	727000	But he likes doing that. So, um, I was looking to pick it up, but I ended up not doing that. So, um, I didn't play a whole lot.
727000	744000	By the time I got to actually play Mario Maker 2, my kids wanted to take the switch away from me again. Plus, as we'll get into it later, the controllers are all jacked up and I was blaming them for it because, you know, they don't take care of electronics, but I'm starting to wonder if it's not their fault.
745000	746000	It may not be.
746000	755000	All right. Well, we'll get into that in a minute then, but first a little bit on my gaming week, although sadly mine hasn't been quite as exciting either because Final Fantasy 14.
755000	760000	I mean, that has just been my game of choice. So when I am gaming, I'm still trying to make my way through the story there.
760000	767000	And I think I'm up to like level 76 in the story quest. So I think I'm about halfway done with the expansion and I am still really enjoying it.
767000	773000	But you know, there's a lot else for me to share with you that I haven't shared on a previous episode, but I am still making my way in Final Fantasy 14.
774000	782000	Survivor, fakie survivor online, still going. I'm still in it, y'all. Believe it or not, we're down to how many people are left?
782000	788000	13 out of 2022 started and 13 are in it and your boy's one of them. So I'm really, I'm pumped about that.
788000	797000	Although, yeah, I can't say too much about strategic or things like that, but all I can say is like there was a swap that happened just a little bit ago.
797000	801000	And okay, you guys will get a kick out of this. So do you guys want to know what they do for like challenges?
801000	802000	Yeah.
802000	810000	These types of games? Okay. So we had to sign on on Thursday night and into a Google Hangout and they didn't tell us what the challenge was going to be.
810000	823000	But they said it would be very helpful for you to know about these topics in advance. You need to know about Calvin Coolidge, Spandex, the album Melodrama by Lorde, the Animorphs and like all this stuff.
823000	838000	So we put together this spreadsheet of just like helpful information and articles and things like that because we thought it might be a trivia contest or something, or we thought it might be something where like you have to talk about that subject and improvise it for like a certain period of time.
838000	845000	And if you can't do it, you're out type of thing. And sure enough, we get on the call and they say, okay, in 10 minutes, we are starting the filibuster challenge.
846000	860000	You will have to talk about these topics as a tribe as long as you possibly can. When you are talking, you must have two hands up in the air so that we know you aren't just looking at more information to keep reading and your time begins in 10 minutes.
860000	871000	And so we, you know, we start opening up as many of the fact articles that we can as we get through. And sure enough, here's, here's the crazy part. So one of the topics was squash.
871000	877000	And so we were like, well, does that mean squash the vegetable or you want us to talk about squash the game?
877000	879000	Or squash is also a drink.
879000	893000	Right. And squash is also like a verb, right? So they said, as long as you are talking about squash, it counts. And we were like, oh, so our tribe spent on one, on milk.
893000	897000	We spent two hours talking about fucking milk.
897000	899000	Did you talk about Harvey Milk too?
899000	905000	You bet your ass I talked about Harvey Milk and I talked about Milk the Drag Queen from season six of RuPaul's Drag Race.
905000	908000	Did the topic of Milk Money, the movie come up?
908000	913000	No, no, but somebody talked about Milk Money by Fergie.
913000	923000	And that was that because the video involved milk or something. And what I thought was pretty brilliant, too, is we had two coffee people that had worked in coffee places.
923000	931000	We had one Starbucks and one Dunkin Donuts. And so they both like talked for like probably easily 20, 30 minutes each about here's all the milk drinks on our menu.
931000	936000	And in this one, you get four pumps of milk. And in this one you get and it was just like frothing it on and on and on.
936000	938000	Yes. That sounds like fun, actually.
938000	945000	So, yeah, actually. And, you know, like the minute I heard the challenge in my head, I was like, we got this. We're going to fucking win this.
945000	954000	So their tribe on this, no, it was seven topics, I'm sorry, because there were seven people on each of them, but their tribe went for three and a half hours talking about seven topics.
954000	964000	Ours went for five hours and 20 minutes. And at the end of the call, so like you were allowed to leave the call, but it's like that's less people to banter with.
964000	974000	So the last two topics we had were the album Melodrama by Lorde. And it was just me and one guy on the call and then I had the Animorphs because we each chose like one we were going to talk about.
974000	983000	So the guy that was on the tribe that did Melodrama by Lorde just starts like reading all of the lyrics, you know.
983000	990000	I don't even remember the lyrics at this point, but it's like, I'm waiting for it. That green light. I want it.
990000	997000	He's just reading the lyrics, like really monotone. And then when the Animorphs came up, okay, this is something I learned.
997000	1001000	There are 54 fucking books in the Animorphs series. So this is how it went for me.
1001000	1008000	I would like to talk to you now about the Animorphs. Book number one in the Animorphs series was called The Visitor.
1008000	1018000	And it was written by K.A. Applegate. And the barcode number if you want to look up this book on Amazon is ISBN 012.
1018000	1026000	I did that 54 times for each and every book. I talked a goddamn hour about this fucking book series I've never read in my life.
1026000	1031000	What if you read the book? Just read the book out loud.
1031000	1037000	Let me tell you, if there was ever hope that I was going to read that book, this challenge we did like fucking ruined it for me.
1037000	1042000	No man, just like as a strategy, just read the book.
1042000	1049000	Oh my God. I love it. Sia Tabiri in chat is like, did you mention all the Megamorphs and the Andalite Chronicles?
1049000	1054000	I fucking know what the Andalite Chronicles are now because of that fucking challenge. It's like, I actually get the joke.
1054000	1064000	It's like, ugh. But anyway, so we won. And that was, yeah, I know it's silly, but it was actually like, it's kind of one of those like, I can't believe I did that sort of like fun things.
1064000	1070000	So I don't know, like that's the fun. But yeah, so that's how I spent five hours on Thursday night talking about fucking milk and the Animorphs.
1070000	1080000	Anyway, SSG100Matt says, what the hell? Does this have a podcast or something? I feel as though it should have a Talking Dead style post-show.
1081000	1092000	I heard that they do like YouTube stuff that recap, like the people that are watching it have like YouTube stuff that they do, but obviously they don't share it with us.
1092000	1101000	We can't see it, but apparently at the end of the game, we'll be able to see it all and know like all the shit people were talking about us and who was liked and who wasn't liked and all that.
1101000	1104000	So it's interesting. So yeah.
1104000	1108000	I can't wait for the eight hours of all the filibuster stuff.
1108000	1116000	Well, yeah, I'm not going to, I mean, if they record, I think they did record it. If they recorded it, maybe Bobby will let me play it on VOG one Saturday.
1119000	1126000	I'd have to get permission from all around. That's not, that's not fair to everybody involved, but I bet they'd think it's funny. So I don't know. Anyway.
1126000	1127000	Should have them on the show.
1128000	1133000	Right. I should, I should get a bunch of these guys that play these things and do like these silly challenges, like live.
1133000	1140000	I've actually kind of talked about this, like doing like a game show night type of thing here with, with some of these people that sign up to do things for free. I think would be fun.
1140000	1144000	So anyway. All right. So I have one last little thing.
1144000	1158000	Yeah, please. I'm planning on doing not a web comic, but a web story where they're just little snippets of dialogue, kind of home stuckish, just without the pictures about a person who moves into a haunted house.
1158000	1165000	And the ghost is then exposed to modern culture and modern technology and starts a blog.
1165000	1167000	Would anyone read it?
1167000	1169000	No, nobody's going to read it. I'm sorry to say.
1169000	1170000	Well, I wasn't asking you.
1170000	1175000	Of course, people in chatter. You got to, you got to do the thing for people to read the thing. Remember that.
1175000	1176000	Well then.
1176000	1184000	That's what I tell, that's what I tell people who's tell me I want to do a podcast. I'm like, great, do a podcast because you got to do the podcast for people to hear the podcast.
1184000	1190000	Well, I'm just putting it out there. Um, so look for something, uh, in the next few weeks.
1190000	1196000	Sounds good. Um, as far as my gaming week goes, I mean, otherwise, uh, there's no, it's fine. There's not really a lot else for me to talk about.
1196000	1208000	I guess Pokemon go. I haven't played Pokemon go in a long time, but I was encouraged to check it out again this week because they did this quality of life update that has changed everything.
1208000	1209000	I didn't notice.
1209000	1217000	It's the appraisals. They totally changed the appraisals. So now when you go in, it actually, you don't have to use one of those third party apps to look at the numbers anymore.
1217000	1222000	As long as you know, like where 15 is on the bar and 14 and 13 you get a visual representation.
1222000	1229000	And so you can tell right there. And it also gives it stars. This is a zero star flop Pokemon. This is a one star, not so great Pokemon and so on and so on.
1229000	1235000	Um, up to four stars is a perfect Pokemon. Here's the best part. And this is like a game changer for me.
1235000	1240000	So somebody like me who is hoarding like 2000 Pokemon and haven't had a problem choosing which ones to get rid of.
1240000	1247000	Um, I can now just search zero star, like the asterisk, and it will show me, here are all your garbage Pokemon.
1247000	1250000	And I was like, great recycle, recycle, recycle, recycle.
1250000	1253000	Like as long as it wasn't something super rare.
1253000	1261000	I run a living Pokedex. So for me, not really so much. The only ones I care about, the ones I actually use a lot, like my riparian and all those.
1261000	1263000	Which, by the way, I got a shiny Mudkip today.
1263000	1266000	Oh, yeah, cause the community event is going like right now.
1266000	1268000	Yeah, there's like four in the house right now.
1268000	1269000	I should see if there's any shinies.
1269000	1270000	Um, gonna catch me some more Mudkips.
1270000	1272000	Just because I did not get a chance to play today.
1272000	1274000	I heard you like Mudkips.
1275000	1281000	And, uh, there's obviously like a lot of people that were not able to do it because we're having this huge heatwave in the US right now.
1281000	1284000	And I was seeing that on our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.
1284000	1285000	It was nice today though.
1285000	1290000	Well, here in California, but like out in New York, Chicago, like the Northeast, it's like 100.
1290000	1292000	And in the South too. Mama was saying.
1292000	1298000	Yeah, it's really bad out there. So that's not fun for them right now. So I feel for them, I gotta say.
1298000	1303000	So, yeah, I'm actually shiny checking live on air. I only see two on the house, but neither are shiny for me.
1303000	1306000	Actually four. I'd like to get a second shiny to evolve it.
1306000	1308000	Ugh, oh well. Just my luck.
1308000	1314000	Yeah, and SG100Matt in our chat says, yeah, the zero star thing is key. Absolutely. I'm so freaking excited about that.
1314000	1317000	And then I played Harry Potter, Wizards Unite. I'm still going on that.
1317000	1320000	We hit level 20. I did the community day yesterday. I should say that.
1320000	1322000	I did the Harry Potter community day yesterday.
1322000	1323000	Oh.
1323000	1324000	So, uh, we went.
1324000	1325000	Some of this work.
1325000	1328000	Well, it was a Saturday, so I work Monday through Friday, okay?
1328000	1333000	So, um, it was, uh, we walked down to the Capitol where you would usually do Pokemon community day, right?
1333000	1341000	Um, except as you can imagine, not nearly as many people out and about as would be on a normal Pokemon community day.
1341000	1345000	It was a lot of tourists. I saw some kids doing a scavenger hunt type thing.
1345000	1349000	And once in a while I'd catch another group where I was like, oh, you guys must be playing.
1349000	1353000	Like they're, they're staring at their phones and there'd be like a couple of the fortresses were lit up green.
1353000	1359000	So, you know, people were doing them, but for the most part it was, it was maybe like five or 10% of what would be there for Pokemon community day.
1359000	1364000	But I think it's because most people I talked to about the Harry Potter community day had no idea.
1364000	1367000	Like, what is it? What's special about it? What are they going to do?
1367000	1370000	Um, and it was just, it really was just like boosted spawns and more XP.
1370000	1374000	So I got to level 20 during the community day. So that was cool, I guess.
1374000	1381000	But, um, yeah, like I got to admit it wasn't as exciting as a Pokemon community day because there wasn't like anything special to get.
1381000	1386000	Or anything. Yeah. So I, I'm hoping they're still kind of feeling this idea out a little bit.
1386000	1394000	But, um, at the end of the day, Alan and I just kind of knew we just want to go out and walk around and get exercise and be nerds and play Harry Potter while we're at it.
1394000	1397000	So, you know, the community day was a win in that regard.
1397000	1405000	But, um, yeah, I think if you felt like you missed something from not doing the event, maybe a small XP boost if that's what you're into.
1406000	1412000	So, but I will say in the Harry Potter game, what's really flopped for me is the week long event they're doing.
1412000	1418000	They're doing like a Harry Potter, um, like foundable. I don't remember the actual name, brilliant foundables or something.
1418000	1421000	They're doing a special event and it's all the little like purple things that come up.
1421000	1422000	I've been all about that.
1422000	1424000	See, well, here's the problem I have with it.
1424000	1429000	At the beginning, it was giving you great XP. You would get like 500 XP for everyone you returned.
1429000	1432000	And I was like, heck yeah, this is great. And like it makes it worth doing.
1432000	1436000	But then they issued a bulletin on like Wednesday or Thursday saying it's giving too much XP.
1436000	1439000	We are going to nerf it down to the levels it's supposed to be at.
1439000	1442000	So you get like 85 or 90 XP for a trace now.
1442000	1451000	Which considering how much you can do a green trace on those stupid owls, it will resist like seven out of eight times.
1451000	1455000	And I'm sitting there and you're just burning spell power on these things you're only going to get 90 XP on.
1455000	1460000	Yeah, but if you throw, um, a potion like right at the start, you'll just get it right away.
1460000	1466000	Yeah. But once I, once I maxed out those two stickers, I honestly, during the community day, I straight up ignored all the purple.
1466000	1469000	You still get, um, SOS, um, achievements for some of them.
1469000	1475000	So I've been doing every single one just because I'm right now, I think at level 16.
1475000	1479000	So I'm still working my way up through it because I only really can play at work.
1479000	1481000	Well, I'm playing at work.
1481000	1484000	I'm just trying to, you know, kind of focus on the other stuff.
1484000	1486000	Like it's kind of like, oh, I finished the event.
1486000	1488000	It's always the port keys to get me stuck. And that was honestly,
1488000	1494000	probably the best thing we got out of community day was actually walking and increasing his port keys.
1494000	1498000	That's my number one thing I need Harry Potter to get is adventure sync.
1498000	1505000	I have now learned the exact distance that I have to drive to get all of my, uh, uh, distance in to get my daily achievement.
1505000	1513000	Watch the video of someone playing, um, the beta for the Minecraft earth stuff, which looks much different than,
1513000	1518000	so the way they have it, you can actually hit all of the stuff while driving, which is kind of cool.
1518000	1521000	Um, they actually have it cause it comes, you don't end up in Iraq. Yes.
1521000	1527000	Well they have just like different things spawn and that's how you get resources to build things, which is kind of cool and craft stuff.
1527000	1533000	So I don't know. I'm really, I'm waiting for my goddamn email to come in, but it's not coming in.
1533000	1537000	I haven't checked my, I keep forgetting that's attached to my spam address.
1537000	1542000	So I have to keep checking that, but I will, I will do that while we start getting into the news here, I think.
1542000	1547000	One last thing, I forget what the fire breathing chicken is called in Harry Potter cause it makes me laugh every time.
1547000	1551000	When you catch it, it will tell you XYZ has been returned to the...
1551000	1557000	Except it shows up with so many other things. Like the one I had, I just did one where you help, uh, Flitwick out.
1557000	1563000	It doesn't say what the chicken's called and I forgot cause my brain is just not wrapping around it, but it makes me laugh every time.
1563000	1568000	Cause I call it, in my head, I call it the vicious chicken of Bristol from Monty Python.
1568000	1572000	Some of the animations in that game are really, uh, really silly, but they're like fun.
1572000	1576000	I love the ballerina, the giant ballerina. That one's like my, my favorite.
1576000	1578000	Oh, that looks like it's like an ogre that's a ballerina or something.
1578000	1581000	Yeah, it's, it makes, there's like so much in this that makes me laugh.
1581000	1586000	And I also think though, just real quick that they got the characterizations down perfectly.
1586000	1591000	Like the, the character models look really good and the animations are great.
1591000	1599000	If you turn your battery saver off, believe it or not, like it looks like it runs like a full 60 frames a second, at least on my iPhone 10.
1599000	1604000	Like it's, it's really good looking, but I imagine most people turn that battery saver on right away, which I can't say I blame you.
1604000	1611000	No, I, I don't really have a problem on mine. I mean, I haven't noticed.
1611000	1613000	I'm actually scrolling through my emails right now.
1613000	1617000	Looking at those of you watching on Twitch, like why is Rob on his phone with good fucking reason?
1617000	1622000	Cause I'm trying to see if I have an email from the, uh, uh, Minecraft.
1622000	1629000	The AR stuff is really cool. So like the thing that I saw a video of the guy had created a redstone.
1629000	1635000	It was a redstone timer type thing for racing. So it was all based on pressure plates.
1635000	1638000	And so when you got to the end of the pressure plates, it would stop the timer.
1638000	1650000	It is kind of like a speedometer almost. And it works in real life because when you're walking on those pressure plates, like in the AR stuff, it actually triggers them, which is kind of cool.
1650000	1658000	So he actually set it up like real size. He marked out on like a piece of paper, you know, where the pressure plates would be.
1658000	1662000	So he like kind of put those on the ground so he could actually run from one to the other.
1662000	1669000	But like in the game, you could see him like running and it's all it's triggering the pressure plates, which is just fucking amazing.
1669000	1676000	Okay. I'm, I'm super curious. Yeah. Cause I, I read a not so great review about the beta on another website.
1676000	1683000	Like they made it sound like it's just not what you think it is, but I also find a lot of, you know, especially, and I was especially learning this with the Harry Potter recent release.
1683000	1689000	Like a lot of people that were writing these reviews on Harry Potter were so quick to just say, ah, it's Pokemon go with a Harry Potter skin.
1689000	1696000	It's like, no, like if you actually go into the fortress battles and do some of the other stuff, like there's, there's some very distinct differences between the two games.
1696000	1704000	You know, I get that at its core, it's the same map, you know, that you're used to a Pokemon go and Ingress to be fair and these other things.
1704000	1711000	But it's just like, I could tell who the lazy reviewers were. So anyway. All right. I think we can move on.
1711000	1716000	We've talked, we've talked plenty about our gaming weeks. I think we need to get into a lot of mobile phone games that sound like,
1716000	1724000	but let's get into some of the other news that folks are dealing with this week, including, oh, are you, are you catching? Oh, it's one of the Harry, uh, the special, uh, purple.
1724000	1731000	That's a dementor. One of the special ones right now. Right. And you, you got it. So good job.
1731000	1735000	Hopefully. Is that your toy? Cause you need what? You need 12 of the Harry Potter kidditch one.
1735000	1742000	I've already got all of them. Okay. I just, like I said, I'm catching those cause it was a medium difficulty.
1742000	1752000	And, um, but I, I kind of wanted to, I know it's really good for our home listeners, but I wanted to put it up on cam so that for people who aren't playing, they kind of get an idea of what I was talking about with the animation.
1752000	1758000	Sure. That's fair. All right. And remember if you, if you do listen on the podcast fee and of course we love you guys for being here.
1758000	1762000	Uh, if you head over to our Twitch channel, we do have an archive where you can watch old episodes on demand.
1762000	1768000	You do have to be a subscriber of the vog network channel in order to have that, which you can do either a low nominal fee.
1768000	1776000	Um, or if you have Amazon prime, which I think was on everybody's mind this past week with prime day, or perhaps you were, you know, anti prime day, which is understandable too.
1776000	1784000	Um, then, uh, if you are an Amazon prime person, you can use your free, uh, or you get one free sub a month on Twitch.
1784000	1792000	So if you consider using it at vog network, you unlock all the old video stuff, not just for OLR, but for Bobby Black Wolf as well, as well as anything in the future.
1792000	1803000	Some of the specials we've done, if you want to go back and watch the E3 Squeenix press event and that whole thing, you can see all that live and there'll be certainly more to come as well as we start to develop that out, uh, through the year.
1803000	1809000	So this year has all been all about the move to Twitch and hopefully that's going to continue to grow, um, as we move on.
1809000	1814000	Anyway, um, let's, I think, move on, uh, to talking about what's going on in the news. Loki.
1814000	1825000	All right. So as I kind of alluded to earlier, when I was talking about my gaming week and playing on the Switch, been having issues with, uh, my joy cons drifting.
1825000	1830000	And I always thought it's the kids touching them with their dirty hands, which they do.
1830000	1836000	They do touch everything with their dirty hands all the time. And so I assumed it was their problem, but apparently it's not.
1836000	1842000	It's actually a design problem with the actual joy con analog stick itself.
1842000	1847000	Apparently Nintendo will actually fix them and it doesn't cost too much to do that. Four dollars.
1847000	1853000	But they also want you to mail your joy cons in and it takes about two weeks to turn around and get them fixed.
1853000	1859000	Um, I haven't gotten that option yet, but that might be interesting to try that.
1859000	1862000	Um, but I don't know if it's going to be a permanent fix.
1862000	1871000	And people have kind of gone through it and actually looked at, you know, what the issue is and, um, tried cleaning them out, but that doesn't end up fixing them permanently.
1871000	1878000	So this was kind of brought up in a Kotaku article. They were talking a little bit about different people with issues.
1878000	1883000	Um, kind of just trying to get all of those stories together.
1883000	1890000	But it's very interesting to see that this is not something that Nintendo's really addressed aside from, hey, yeah, we'll fix it.
1890000	1898000	But you would think that since they're putting out new ones now, and I'm almost curious also with the Switch Lite coming out,
1898000	1905000	if they're using that same analog stick on there, that's a problem because you can't just replace the joy con on there.
1905000	1908000	You're kind of stuck because it's attached to the system.
1908000	1910000	So I'm curious to see what they do with that.
1910000	1917000	But it's funny because I don't have this problem on my other consoles, like on my Xbox 360.
1917000	1925000	Occasionally, um, I think some of the analog sticks would die, like completely, but not just drift off to the side.
1925000	1934000	And that's what we have happen. Like even we were, uh, my son, I guess I was playing the Legend of Zelda demo at the Switch kiosk in the GameStop.
1934000	1942000	And that joy con was all fucked up. It was just looking straight down the entire time because it was like pushing itself up.
1942000	1950000	So it's just, it's a real big problem. And I've had even like switching out joy cons because I have two sets of them.
1950000	1952000	Both of them are doing it now.
1952000	1959000	And it's not something that I can avoid because who knows what the hell's wrong with it. It's dirt or something in there.
1959000	1964000	But it sounds like Nintendo may have to answer for this in court, right?
1964000	1968000	Yeah. So there's going to be probably a class action lawsuit around it.
1968000	1975000	Um, because I mean, it is something that they're not dressing up front in so much like you would have.
1975000	1979000	Not so much to the point of like the Xbox 360 and the Red Ring stuff.
1979000	1988000	But, um, you know, to a smaller extent, this is going to be, this is a widespread problem because there's been so many people who have been affected by it.
1988000	1994000	Yeah. I have to admit, I don't have this problem whatsoever, but I don't, I'm not like a heavy user of my Switch.
1994000	1998000	You know, I'll, of course I play it here and there, but I have a pro controller.
1998000	2001000	So I do a lot of my playing on the, a lot, a lot of my playing on the pro controller.
2001000	2004000	And it could be though that this pro controller analog sticks are different.
2004000	2011000	Possibly. You're right. Uh, Questbuster in chat with his perspective saying it won't be permanent if they still use the same stick module.
2011000	2018000	Someone took one apart a while ago and posted pics and the problem seems to be the graphite pads the rockers move across to generate input.
2018000	2022000	The problem is that graphite wears down and accumulates debris.
2022000	2029000	And as J100Matt says, sounds like it's joining in the long line of day one issues, PS2 disc read issues, 360 Red Ring.
2029000	2035000	Yeah. I mean, it does play station for the analog stick rubber rubbing off. Oh yeah. I remember that too.
2035000	2045000	That's still like an issue. I think so. I mean, I, I think it'd be great if Nintendo would just maybe have an exchange program or something to just, even if it's just like the basic gray ones, then fine.
2045000	2048000	Cause Nintendo is selling now all these new color.
2048000	2053000	They just announced this week, like Nike at purple and orange and green and yellow or so.
2053000	2057000	I don't even know if I'm getting the colors right because I gotta be honest. I hate that they mismatch.
2058000	2064000	I know it's like a trademark thing about the switch is that they mismatch. I can't stand it. That's why I always take my plane.
2064000	2069000	Why can't they just do like, this is a perfect opportunity.
2069000	2076000	This is like where Microsoft kind of excels, you know, cause with Microsoft, you can get the custom Xbox one controllers.
2076000	2086000	And I think, I think it's just Xbox one. I don't remember if they do with the 360, but is custom Xbox one controllers where you can design the colors, the d-pad style, the colors of the buttons.
2086000	2093000	And you can completely get whatever you want custom to you instead of having the way, Oh, now we're going to lead controller. You can do that.
2093000	2099000	Yeah. No, even just regular controllers. Yeah. Okay. I think you can do with the elite as well, but you definitely do it with the elite.
2099000	2105000	I know that's a Microsoft thing. I really though hate the, the green blue comedy, not the green blue, but the green pink for the joy con.
2105000	2111000	But I do like the red and blue one. The one I have, I think that it looks really, it's kind of like the standard, just the red and blue.
2111000	2117000	I got both of those. I like the green and pink, but even like the pro controller is different colors on left and right.
2117000	2122000	But like for me, I can at least write off going, well, it's this platoon theme controller. So it's supposed to be different colors.
2122000	2133000	Yeah. That's where the green and pink supposed to be from. Yeah. Yeah. So, but yeah, I, uh, I would be very curious to see if Nintendo is going to have to respond to this on a larger level, especially if now they're getting called into court on it now.
2133000	2141000	Um, you know, I, I'm gonna confess, maybe I'm just naive about this type of stuff, but why can't Nintendo have a firmware thing where you can kind of recalibrate those controllers?
2141000	2148000	You can, there's always a slight down tilt to it. Can't you just kind of like have that, but here's the problem. It's not all the time.
2148000	2154000	It's it's intermittent. So it's, it's, it depends on where the debris is inside there.
2154000	2162000	So one of the ways I've kind of tried to fix stuff is you can blow like compressed air in there to try to like kind of knock it out of the way, but it depends on how it's reading.
2162000	2170000	And sometimes like you, or like I end up having to shake that controller back and forth a bunch to try to, I guess, knock the debris out of the way.
2170000	2179000	And then eventually it will kind of fix itself. But if something gets stuck on there, then it'll drift slightly in one direction.
2179000	2187000	So it's, it's not all the time and yeah, you can recalibrate them and sometimes that helps, but it's not, it's not a solution.
2187000	2194000	Interesting. SheHulk10 in our chat says, my Joy-Cons disconnect all the time. It sucks and I have terrible lag. So.
2194000	2200000	We just mostly use our pro controller, but the one that I bought had like a problem with it and it drifts.
2200000	2208000	That's why I'm thinking I'm not seeing this program or this problem like the way others are because there's very little that I actually use the Joy-Cons for.
2208000	2214000	Maybe if I'm traveling like tomorrow, I'm going on a plane ride. So if I decide to bring my Switch, which I probably will,
2214000	2218000	I'll, I'll use the Joy-Cons like attached to the console and play it that way.
2218000	2223000	But most of the things, like when I'm playing things like Bloodstained or even Splatoon or like,
2223000	2227000	I can't think of a Switch game that I don't play on the pro controller.
2227000	2234000	It would be nice. I would even fix them myself if there was a way to like buy something that's a different surface instead of graphite,
2234000	2236000	another material that's not going to break down.
2236000	2242000	Actually kind of along those lines, you were saying you're playing Bloodstained. Is it any better after they do the patches?
2242000	2246000	I haven't, to be fair, because of everything else I've been into, I haven't had a chance to try.
2246000	2248000	Well, if you try while you're out, let me know.
2248000	2252000	It might be a traveling game because I'm going to be gone. Yeah, I definitely have to bring my Switch because I'm going to be gone for a week.
2252000	2253000	So, you know.
2253000	2261000	Well, Dan and I was telling, you know, Dan and I were looking at the nerfing on it and what they've changed in because they didn't do anything on the PS4 unless it was already like that.
2261000	2265000	And so I was really curious as to if they fit, what the fix was like for you.
2266000	2271000	Shane is in our chat, Chad Starzik, saying, I haven't played the Switch in docked mode for months and months.
2271000	2277000	So joy cons are great to me for an individually customization aspect, which, you know, if that's what works for you, awesome.
2277000	2282000	But it's very interesting how different people can approach it because, like, honestly, I'm almost exclusively docked mode.
2282000	2286000	It is really only if I'm traveling is the only time I don't play in docked mode.
2286000	2292000	And even then, I'm thinking like, can I bring my dock and hook it up to the hotel TV? Like, I should be able to do that, right?
2292000	2293000	Yeah.
2293000	2298000	So it's the thoughts probably. Yeah. So anyway.
2298000	2304000	All right. Well, let's move on and talk about a game that sadly is still not on the Switch, although I think many people are waiting for it.
2304000	2310000	It's Overwatch. Maybe when they do, you know, there's a lot of rumble that this is something they're going to do for it.
2310000	2320000	And this is not the story tonight, but there's a lot of rumble that Overwatch 2 or some type of Overwatch spinoff thing is like going to be the big BlizzCon announcement this year with Diablo 4.
2320000	2326000	Like, Blizzard is in a position where they realized last year did not work, and so they're going to come out swinging this year.
2326000	2335000	And the rumor is that it's Diablo 4 and a new Overwatch game that will, in fact, as I think I've kind of said on the show before,
2335000	2343000	focus a little more on some of the PvE things that they've been doing during the holiday events, but make that a little more of like an actual part of the core game.
2343000	2348000	So anyway, that's all rumors and stuff. We won't know any of that till whenever BlizzCon is, what, September?
2348000	2351000	I can't even remember when BlizzCon is. September or October? One of those.
2351000	2353000	Nothing in November? No.
2353000	2358000	It may actually be all the way in November, I think you're right. But anyway, we're going to go to something we do know.
2358000	2364000	Now this is for sure happening for Overwatch, and that is about role locking in Overwatch.
2364000	2372000	And this all started from a video that had leaked relating to the Overwatch League, and sure enough, the game director, Jeff Kaplan, came out and said,
2372000	2377000	in the future, players will now queue for specific roles in Overwatch games too.
2377000	2384000	This is important because historically, the game has given you the freedom to switch to pretty much any hero you want right in the middle of battle,
2384000	2391000	which is fine for experimentation and finding the characters you like, but when you actually want to win the game,
2391000	2395000	somebody's got to be a healer, somebody's got to be a tank, and somebody's got to be...
2395000	2399000	And actually, it's two, two, and two. So you have two tanks, two healers, two DPS.
2399000	2404000	That's the way things are going to be role locked. And now, when you want to play Quick Play, you say in advance,
2404000	2410000	I'm signing up to be support. And then when you get in your game, you will be one of the two support people.
2410000	2418000	And just like happens in many MMOs, including Final Fantasy XIV, I'll tell you the tanks and healers are going to be waiting a hell of a lot less time than the DPS,
2418000	2422000	which may have longer queues. So this is something they are talking about coming to Quick Play.
2422000	2427000	Now, there will be exceptions to this, of course, because you can always make your own game mode.
2427000	2432000	Like if you want to play with friends and you're like, fuck that, I want to do six tanks against six Mercys or something,
2432000	2437000	you can do whatever you want still in that regard in the arcade. It gives you the freedom to do that.
2437000	2443000	But this is going to become the new standard, which is what a lot of people play. Why did they make the decision?
2443000	2450000	They said the more that we can do to keep the pro experience in Overwatch League consistent with the live game experience of Overwatch players,
2450000	2456000	the better from the Overwatch League perspective, because this is also going to be a change that is going to affect the Overwatch League.
2456000	2462000	So when they play, they're going to be subject to the same rules, which for the most part they've kind of been doing anyway.
2462000	2472000	But I think it had been found that like, I think it was a three tank, three healer combination was actually doing really well in some matches.
2472000	2480000	So they don't want like one particular makeup to be the only way to do it. So they're going to do a two, two, two.
2480000	2489000	So it will be in quick play, it will be in competitive mode, and you cannot change your roles once the map starts.
2489000	2497000	Yes, the GOATS meta is three tanks and three supports. So no Widow makers, no tracers, nothing like that.
2497000	2502000	So Fifth Dream in chat says, fuck roles, I'm tired of being railroaded.
2502000	2513000	Well, I mean, I don't know, I have to say I'm kind of interested in this simply because nothing bugs me more than going into a map willing to play healer,
2513000	2522000	and then Moira gets snatched up in the first five seconds. And then somebody else grabs Lucio or Brigitte or something where it's like,
2522000	2528000	all right, well, I don't want to do three supports. So I guess I'll have to do a DPS. Oh, the DPS just got taken.
2528000	2533000	Well, I get, I don't want to play a tank. I'm not good at tank. So at least I'll be able to like queue for the maps.
2533000	2539000	Like I'm going to play this role and, you know, maybe there'll be one other person I have to fight with for Moira,
2539000	2543000	but at least I'll know, okay, even if the other person picks Moira, I can do Mercy.
2543000	2546000	I can do Lucio, something that I feel a little more confident with.
2546000	2547000	Very well.
2547000	2555000	It is, it's or MMOs in general, really. It's very much like you're queuing for a dungeon and the dungeon is the Overwatch map.
2555000	2557000	And remember, thank your healer.
2557000	2563000	And based on some of the screenshots, it looked like they were offering rewards for certain roles, like they do in MMOs.
2563000	2568000	Like in Final Fantasy 14, that's just the one I have a lot of experience with right now.
2568000	2576000	If like healers are in demand, you will get like bonus materia because they have kind of a, it's not like it wasn't in Final Fantasy 7,
2576000	2582000	but you get materia and it alters stats on your gear. So it's like you can give yourself like 40 determination or things like that.
2582000	2584000	It doesn't like teach you spells.
2584000	2589000	Kind of considering coming back to 14, except I would need help power leveling.
2589000	2596000	Well, you can do it one of two ways because you can't, you can't really, it's not like, wow, you can't power level people because when you do dungeons, you get synced.
2596000	2598000	So you can't really power level.
2598000	2600000	You can buy a potion that just skips you through it all.
2600000	2605000	But I think, I do think it's worth playing, especially like the Heavensward story.
2605000	2609000	Well, no, I was thinking to finish up the ones that I'm on and starting a new class.
2609000	2617000	Actually, wait, I do, you know what, I take it back. You can't, like if you were, if you needed to do this story dungeon, I could just go in there as like a level 80.
2617000	2622000	Because assuming I'm 80 at that point, and I'm sure Shane could help with this too, or Captain Spiker.
2622000	2623000	I think I'm at 65.
2623000	2630000	Any of the variety of people we know. Yeah, but even, even then, like there's such a jump between 50 to 60 to 70 to 80.
2630000	2636000	Like an 80 and a 65 could team up and take out any of those 60 to 69 dungeons. Easy.
2636000	2637000	Yeah.
2637000	2638000	You would need four people.
2638000	2640000	And basically I'd have to relearn mechanics.
2640000	2646000	And you've heard the thing about Shadowbringers is that when you get to those dungeons, fuck other people, you can just run with trust.
2646000	2650000	The only, there's, there's going to be two parts where you can't do that.
2650000	2652000	And it's the, it's the two big boss battles.
2652000	2653000	The two big boss battles.
2653000	2657000	Which is cool. I think like the last thing I had done majorly was the Ultros.
2657000	2664000	And then when they had so many of like, what's this fuck, the annoying guy shoved down my fucking throat.
2664000	2665000	Oh, Gilgamesh or Hildebrand?
2665000	2666000	Hildebrand.
2666000	2667000	Yeah.
2667000	2668000	But I was like, I'm kind of done.
2668000	2669000	I got sick of him.
2669000	2670000	I hate him.
2670000	2671000	He's an idiot.
2671000	2672000	You don't have to do this quest though.
2672000	2673000	They're optional.
2673000	2676000	I did them though, because I was trying to level in it and have any other quests open to me at the time.
2676000	2677000	Gotcha.
2677000	2678000	I like, I like his assistant.
2678000	2679000	I think he's a fucking dolt.
2679000	2680000	I like the dad.
2680000	2681000	He's not funny.
2681000	2682000	Yeah.
2682000	2683000	I like his dad.
2683000	2684000	His dad's funny.
2684000	2687000	But I just think that the, the character's comic relief that wasn't needed.
2687000	2690000	They may have finally retired him for Shadowbringers.
2690000	2691000	I don't think he's in the main store.
2691000	2692000	Well, don't quote me on that.
2692000	2695000	Cause they might come out and say, guess what's coming in 5.1 more Hildebrand.
2695000	2696000	Like they might do that.
2697000	2700000	Don't quote me on it, but he's not in the base.
2700000	2702000	There's too much other shit to cover in the base.
2702000	2703000	Cause there's, there's a lot.
2703000	2706000	I gotta say the story is like, it's real good y'all.
2706000	2708000	And I'm not even at the end yet.
2708000	2713000	And like every other day or no, every day I'm getting some text message from Shane where
2713000	2718000	like, he doesn't want to spoil it, but he's like, I just, I can't believe that this happened.
2718000	2719000	Like this is the best expansion ever.
2719000	2721000	Like there's nothing is ever going to top this expansion.
2721000	2723000	This is the greatest it's ever going to be.
2723000	2726000	Well then I'll need to, you're on a different server than where I left off too, right?
2726000	2728000	I am, but we're in the same cluster.
2728000	2730000	So even if you didn't move servers, you could still, we still party.
2730000	2732000	But I think I want to still join a different free company.
2732000	2737000	So if you've got a different free company, like are all the same jerks that were in it that I didn't like?
2737000	2741000	Um, this is a different, it's, uh, Shane, myself.
2741000	2743000	And then we teamed up with, um, uh, the game buoy guys.
2743000	2746000	So like captain spike and then then y'all join your free company.
2746000	2750000	And then these random like Aussies that I met through the game is who we play.
2750000	2752000	No, I would rather join your free company.
2752000	2755000	And because everybody else that I was playing with, I don't think I knew anybody,
2755000	2760000	but like, uh, a couple of people in the current free company I was in.
2760000	2762000	Yeah, so cool.
2762000	2765000	We'll figure it out. Anyhow, Overwatch, turn to Final Fantasy 14 chat.
2765000	2767000	How do you like that?
2767000	2769000	Let's move on with some more stories.
2769000	2771000	I had to do that when I took a bite.
2771000	2774000	I'm sorry, but I'm going to need to do a quick AFK, but, uh,
2774000	2776000	Dar Sakra will get into the next story.
2776000	2779000	Then they get to hear me talk with a mouthful of food.
2779000	2781000	Speaking though of food problems.
2781000	2783000	Oh my God.
2783000	2787000	So anyway, this happened in Memphis, Tennessee.
2787000	2789000	Oh my God. I'm still chewing.
2789000	2791000	Will you say something real quick?
2791000	2793000	You're still chewing.
2793000	2796000	I was hungry. I haven't eaten all day.
2796000	2802000	Um, anyway, in Memphis, Tennessee, they had, this family had to take their son,
2802000	2805000	eight year old boy, to the emergency room.
2805000	2807000	And you know why?
2807000	2813000	He was playing Fortnite and he didn't want to stop to go to the bathroom.
2813000	2820000	So he got himself so constipated that he had to go to the ER.
2822000	2826000	I mean, I laugh because I live this.
2826000	2829000	My kids, they'll, they'll do that.
2829000	2833000	Like all of a sudden it's like, I have to use the bathroom a lot right now.
2833000	2835000	It's like, because we only have one bathroom in the house.
2835000	2839000	And it's like, well, you have like five hours, you're playing games.
2839000	2843000	You could have used the bathroom, but you decided now it's the time to do that.
2843000	2846000	Or they're like, Oh, I went to the bathroom in my underwear.
2848000	2853000	It's because the screens and games, they make that a priority over themselves.
2853000	2858000	But it also is parents jobs to make sure their kids are going to the bathroom when they're young.
2858000	2862000	And also that they're eating the right foods so that they're not constipated
2862000	2865000	because I'm assuming that they didn't drink enough water.
2865000	2871000	They aren't eating enough fiber. So there's a lot to that as well.
2871000	2875000	But I mean, it also is another advocate for limiting screen time for kids
2875000	2878000	or putting them on like a particular limit or something, you know?
2878000	2882000	Well, and I won't even go into that because honestly I don't have children.
2882000	2884000	I never want children. And this is why I don't want children
2884000	2886000	because I don't want the fucking responsibility.
2886000	2895000	But even so, these kids, this kid's parents should have realized
2895000	2900000	how much time their child was spending in front of the game
2900000	2903000	and limited their time so that the child could take care of himself
2903000	2907000	and also make sure he's not eating junk and make sure the kid's drinking enough water.
2907000	2911000	In fact, there is a line here that says that the doctors told the parents
2911000	2914000	they need to pay close attention to what their kids are doing.
2914000	2917000	Well, how long was this kid playing games?
2917000	2918000	It doesn't say.
2918000	2920000	Because I mean, if you're going to get that constipated,
2920000	2922000	that would take days, I would imagine.
2922000	2926000	It doesn't say. And I would think that he would have had to have been playing.
2926000	2931000	Like on average, I think that it's something like what,
2931000	2937000	a two to three hour digestive cycle for children from ingestion to excrement.
2937000	2941000	So this kid would have had to have been playing
2941000	2946000	and possibly even eating while playing for that much waste
2946000	2950000	to build up in the colon and drinking no liquids with it
2950000	2952000	or worse, drinking a dehydrating liquid.
2952000	2954000	I mean, I know that sounds like an oxymoron,
2954000	2958000	but having like a caffeinated drink or the wrong things
2958000	2962000	or possibly even drinking milk with it if the kid's lactose intolerant
2962000	2966000	and you don't go to the bathroom, that can be an issue too.
2966000	2972000	But it's just really absolutely baffling how this could have even happened.
2972000	2975000	And I don't look at it as a problem with the game.
2975000	2979000	I look at it as a problem with, honestly enough, the parents not paying attention to the kid.
2979000	2981000	Yeah, that's usually what it is.
2981000	2983000	And another thing going into psychology here,
2983000	2986000	because this is something I did study for a little while,
2986000	2993000	is that for the younger that you are, you're more immediately concerned with immediate reward.
2993000	2995000	Your brain isn't wired to think of consequences
2995000	2998000	because you're still growing. Your life is immediate.
2998000	3005000	And so for a kid, we can't expect a kid to be able to regulate themselves at 8 years old
3005000	3010000	to the extent of, say, someone who might be 16 or older would be able to regulate themselves.
3010000	3013000	That's really where parents need to step in and go,
3013000	3015000	I think you've had enough.
3015000	3018000	It's like the cat paw, time to stop posting.
3018000	3023000	But I know, as a parent, what would you think of this circumstance?
3023000	3026000	I mean, just take better care of your kids.
3026000	3029000	You should know better if they haven't pooped in a few days.
3029000	3033000	Put aside the cookie crisp and give them some Albrand.
3033000	3036000	They'll really have to poo then.
3036000	3039000	Rob missed the entire conversation about poop.
3039000	3041000	We talked about it before the show, though.
3041000	3043000	Well, yeah, I messaged Rob last night.
3043000	3047000	I'm like, yeah, I'm going to do the story about Fortnite sending a kid to the hospital.
3047000	3049000	And he's like, oh, no, or something.
3049000	3052000	And I'm like, yeah, he didn't shit for a while.
3052000	3054000	Have you guys been reading some of these chat comments?
3054000	3055000	Because there's some good stuff in here.
3055000	3056000	Hold on, I was reading the article.
3056000	3057000	No, you're fine.
3057000	3061000	S2100 Matt says, can't poop regularly if you're just eating Doritos.
3061000	3062000	Wow, that's some real tea.
3062000	3064000	High culture says, give them the colon blow.
3064000	3067000	Orangewright says, holding it in for a Fortnite for Fortnite.
3067000	3072000	And Questbuster, probably with a more realistic perspective there.
3072000	3076000	Tummy hurts, but I have a new hat now and need to show it off to everyone.
3076000	3077000	Yeah.
3077000	3082000	But again, it's just like kids are more concerned with immediate reward.
3082000	3092000	If their focus is on the pleasure centers of their brain being triggered by getting all of this and playing Fortnite,
3092000	3097000	they may ignore their body functions because they're not mature.
3097000	3099000	Especially if you're eight.
3099000	3103000	You know, like I'm not going to make fun of the child here because they are a child.
3103000	3107000	And if they're not being taught, you know, certain things by the parents.
3107000	3112000	So the one to make fun of here is the parents about like, why, where are they?
3112000	3115000	Like, would your eight year old be able to get away with this, Logie?
3115000	3116000	No.
3116000	3121000	Well, and see, when Julian was younger, you know, his thing was that Pirates 101.
3121000	3122000	I don't know if he's still playing it.
3122000	3124000	We'll have to get him into a real MMO.
3124000	3125000	Didn't we have him on the show?
3125000	3126000	Yeah, a couple of times.
3126000	3128000	And I remember everyone said, get good.
3128000	3132000	And he's like, it's like, I'm a fucking 11 year old.
3132000	3134000	I love that boy.
3134000	3137000	But at any rate, is he almost a teenager?
3137000	3139000	He is 12.
3139000	3142000	He's going to be 13 next April.
3142000	3143000	Oh, my gosh.
3143000	3144000	Late April.
3144000	3147000	We're going to have to get him back on the show after his voice changes.
3147000	3148000	Oh, it's already.
3148000	3149000	Wow.
3149000	3151000	He's already got crackly voice right now.
3151000	3152000	OK.
3152000	3153000	You know, that kind of in between.
3153000	3155000	I sound like I'm slightly constipated.
3155000	3156000	Yeah, no, I gotcha.
3156000	3157000	Yeah.
3157000	3159000	No, Julian, Julian is.
3159000	3161000	He's just growing by leaps and bounds.
3161000	3162000	Oh, wow.
3162000	3163000	He's such a good kid, though.
3163000	3164000	I'm so proud of him.
3164000	3170000	And on top of that, too, he is a pretty vocal feminist.
3170000	3172000	Well, I'm sure his mom raised him right.
3172000	3173000	Exactly.
3173000	3177000	Well, he also is very accepting of other people and he stands up to bullies.
3177000	3178000	Good.
3178000	3179000	I am so proud of this kid.
3179000	3183000	Like, I could only be prouder of him if I had squirted him out.
3183000	3186000	Our show will be in good hands when we all die.
3186000	3188000	I don't plan on dying.
3188000	3189000	So anyway.
3189000	3190000	Yeah.
3190000	3191000	Yeah.
3191000	3192000	Kids, make sure your parents shit.
3192000	3193000	All right.
3193000	3194000	The end.
3194000	3195000	Let's move on.
3195000	3196000	Loki.
3196000	3197000	All right.
3197000	3204000	So, of course, we don't know a whole ton about Google Stadia, but there is some stuff that
3204000	3208000	they did help clarify regarding their different plans that they have.
3208000	3215000	So one of those, of course, is the Stadia Pro, which, you know, I was kind of wondering,
3215000	3216000	what the hell is this?
3216000	3222720	We get like a bunch of free games and what am I paying $10 a month for with the CD Pro?
3222720	3224900	So here's what CD Pro apparently gives you.
3224900	3230760	It's not like a Netflix of games, but like with most other online services that you pay
3230760	3237920	for, like Xbox Live or PlayStation Plus or something like that, you get a game a month,
3237920	3245000	which is less than the other offerings, you know, out there, like four games, a few games.
3245000	3246000	Yeah.
3246000	3247000	Yeah.
3247000	3251720	And I'm glad they I mean, I think we kind of knew this from that part of it is not really
3251720	3252720	going to be a Netflix game.
3252720	3255600	But I think if you really kind of listen to what they were saying, any three, you kind
3255600	3256600	of knew that.
3256600	3261320	But it was nice that during this AMA, like they asked me anything on Reddit that he was
3261320	3266960	doing, he did just flat out said like he didn't he didn't try to cut corners and he said people
3266960	3269400	have wrongfully assumed this is a Netflix of games.
3269400	3270520	That's not what this is.
3270520	3271520	Yeah.
3272040	3277440	So it's just you get the 4K surround sound and a game a month.
3277440	3281800	And of course, they're starting that with Destiny 2.
3281800	3282800	So yeah.
3282800	3288540	And they say roughly one free game a month, give or take.
3288540	3290600	So there may not be a free game in some months.
3290600	3292840	And yeah, I gotcha.
3292840	3293840	OK.
3293840	3296840	I mean.
3296840	3299400	Still not seeing the point, but.
3299400	3300400	It was interesting, too.
3300400	3304840	I read through some of the AMA answers and it was interesting how and I forgot the executive
3304840	3306320	that was answering the questions.
3306320	3307320	Sorry.
3307320	3310880	But I thought it was interesting how he was kind of trying to justify like, well, you
3310880	3314240	know, because because people were flat out asking like, why am I going to buy these games
3314240	3315320	that I don't really own?
3315320	3317020	They exist on the cloud somewhere.
3317020	3319440	And he kind of really had this attitude of we get it.
3319440	3321240	The cloud is scary.
3321240	3322240	People don't want to.
3322240	3324240	Why do you use Spotify?
3324240	3326120	Well, and he he kind of addressed that.
3326120	3330240	He said, don't people buy movies on, you know, Google Play?
3330280	3333840	Don't people buy songs on, you know, Apple, iTunes or something?
3333840	3336280	Yeah, but songs don't cost sixty dollars.
3336280	3338160	Ding, ding, ding that you stole my fucking thunder.
3338160	3339480	That was exactly what I was going to make.
3339480	3340880	No, you're fine.
3340880	3345560	It's one thing to throw away ninety nine cents on a song that you can listen to like a hundred
3345560	3347320	times before you wear it out.
3347320	3348840	But you are absolutely right.
3348840	3352440	A song does not cost sixty dollars and even a movie.
3352440	3356120	I want to say like probably the most the most expensive movie you're going to buy is probably
3356120	3357720	going to be what, like twenty four ninety nine.
3357720	3359040	It's a digital download.
3359040	3361720	And I don't really buy movies really.
3361720	3364600	I don't wait for Netflix or something.
3364600	3365800	I know some people might.
3365800	3368800	But yeah, I don't usually spend that much.
3368800	3372960	Some people might. But I think even between twenty five dollars and sixty dollars, there's
3372960	3373880	still a big difference.
3375360	3382720	Yeah, and just just Google like I don't it's hard for me to trust that the service is going
3382720	3384120	to be around for long.
3384640	3390960	Um, I would like to think that it is, but like I've got so many libraries elsewhere
3390960	3392440	that I can't see.
3393600	3396880	I don't know who this is targeted to, like if this is targeted towards gamers.
3399160	3404000	We probably already have gaming systems, are you targeting this towards non gamers, because
3404600	3409320	is a non gamer, you can give a shit that you're giving away Destiny two for free, a game
3409320	3411400	that's been out for a very long time.
3412400	3417440	It's technically not free anyways, you're paying ten bucks a month, so I don't get who
3417440	3422600	this is, where the who's the target audience for this is what I don't understand.
3424280	3427200	Yeah, I don't I don't I don't know either.
3427640	3431720	Interestingly enough, I haven't mentioned this yet on the show, I so Prime Day sale
3431720	3436240	happened, right? Yeah, I ended up buying a Chromebook because it was so like deep
3436240	3439000	discounted and I knew I had this travel trip coming up.
3439280	3440960	I have no way to get my work email.
3441440	3445720	Unless because I don't have like a laptop, so I was like, all right, well, I'm well, I
3445720	3449760	had a laptop, my the laptop I have is like ten years old and monitors, but like, I can't
3449760	3452000	use that laptop to do anything anymore.
3452000	3453440	But I was like, maybe I'll just get a Chromebook.
3453800	3456560	So and it was super cheap because of Prime Day.
3456560	3459520	So I was like, whatever, like I'm not spending like a ton of money on whatever.
3459520	3462840	And if I end up not liking it, it's not like, you know, it's not like a wasted money.
3463160	3466360	But even I'm thinking like, oh, but, you know, thanks to that Chromebook, that could be
3466360	3468120	a great little thing for Google Stadia.
3468120	3471040	But then I'm like, I'm not going to I'm not going to do Stadia.
3471400	3476760	On that laptop, even if it does run six or whatever, whatever they're saying, 60 frames
3476760	3478480	a second, the smooth stuff, it's just not.
3479040	3480760	Yes. Like where would that happen?
3480760	3484600	Like, you know, like I like would try to figure out the scenario.
3484600	3491840	Let's say, OK, I'm on a business trip and I'm taking my my Chromebook with me on the
3491840	3493240	hotel Wi-Fi.
3493400	3495680	You get in 60 frames per second.
3495680	3497000	Anything. No.
3497000	3499240	And DJ Rama S is like, Chromebook?
3499240	3503000	I'm sorry. I need it to do like one or two specific things.
3503000	3508360	And that's it. Like, I realize I bought a pretty, you know, like bare bones type of
3508360	3510880	thing, but that's all I need this thing for is bare bones stuff.
3511320	3512960	So. All right.
3513480	3516240	Anyway, I guess I guess that's it.
3516280	3518200	Nothing else on the Stadia AMA we want to talk about?
3518480	3521000	No, I mean, I don't know.
3521280	3525640	Basically, I just don't see the point of the system right now.
3525640	3529560	Yeah, that's that's really all I want to talk about is the clarification of that.
3529560	3533600	Just do you think they're trying to create a niche that doesn't exist?
3533960	3538640	I think they're trying to push that this cloud is kind of like, well, take the gaming
3538640	3540760	anywhere. You can play it on all these platforms.
3540760	3543160	But it's like, I don't want to play it on my phone.
3543160	3546880	I don't want to play it on a Chromebook, play it on my laptop.
3546880	3549840	Well, you know, I can kind of already do that anyways.
3549840	3556800	I mean, I would think this would be a big thing for like Mac users because you could
3556800	3558240	play a lot of games that way.
3558480	3562960	So that's the Apple's got their own solution coming, which is going to be so is it not
3562960	3564040	going to be on Mac?
3564040	3565480	I mean, no, I don't.
3565880	3566880	They'll put Stadia on it.
3567040	3569520	The impression I was getting is that Stadia, they're going to put Stadia on it.
3569520	3572440	Chrome, I guess. The Apple's trying to fix that problem themselves.
3572440	3575600	And they're they're they're spending the coin to get the developers in there to do it.
3575600	3580400	Yeah, I just I will tell you this, though, the App Store does have a lot of AAA titles in
3580400	3583560	it now. So, you know, I wouldn't be surprised.
3583560	3584720	But there's a lot of stuff.
3584720	3589800	I mean, I like it when I can play it on my phone or when it's designed for my phone.
3590040	3591280	That's why I love Pokemon Go.
3591280	3592320	That's why I love Harry Potter.
3592320	3594240	Great examples of like phone experiences.
3594400	3598400	What I do not love is like playing Sonic the Hedgehog 2 on my phone because it's something
3598400	3600000	that you're supposed to have a controller for.
3600000	3601760	And it's like they put a fakie one on the screen.
3601960	3605560	It doesn't work that way. Like when the experience is designed with the mobile
3605560	3607600	phone as your device in mind, I'm fine.
3607800	3610360	I just don't like it when they squeeze other games into it.
3610360	3611560	You know what I mean? Yeah.
3611560	3614640	And I'm I'm fine with them trying to do this.
3614640	3616880	OK, that's fine. Let's just put it out there.
3616880	3618040	We'll see how it does.
3618280	3623920	We'll see. Let's see what they offer to like make it interesting for me to want to buy
3623920	3629800	this. Right now, there's not anything that wants me or is making me want to buy this,
3629800	3632200	especially with next gen consoles right around the corner.
3632600	3635200	So. I mean, that's fine.
3635240	3637400	Not everything's supposed to be for me, so whatever.
3637400	3642480	I don't care. But I'm just I'm curious to see how well this does, because I don't know
3642480	3644080	who they're trying to focus this towards.
3645280	3649800	I mean, I get like the streaming aspects kind of core, you can stream games.
3650120	3655600	Well, you can stream footage of games and it's supposed to be, you know, lossless as
3655600	3656640	far as that goes.
3656640	3661480	But. I think there's going to be problems with that, too.
3661480	3664920	I mean, I know you can't livestream because you have to have a thousand, you know,
3665880	3669520	followers or whatever the stupid requirements that they have now.
3669520	3673040	And then like the other times, you know, music and stuff is going to get your stuff
3673040	3675720	demonetized. So that's a whole nother.
3675720	3677560	It's YouTube fighting themselves, you know.
3679040	3682200	I just don't I don't get it, but whatever.
3682240	3684560	That's fine. Put out the product.
3684560	3686600	If it works, it works. If it doesn't, it doesn't.
3687240	3689760	All right. Well, let's move on to talking about some of the announcements after San
3689760	3693160	Diego Comic-Con. I feel like I've been asking for the past three weeks is Comic-Con this
3693160	3695960	weekend. Comic-Con this weekend. Well, it was this weekend finally.
3695960	3697200	Just check Victoria's page.
3697200	3700680	Oh, yeah. My my good buddy Victoria from Shaking and Crying.
3700680	3704040	I know we haven't done an episode in a hot minute, but she got a lot to say on the next
3704040	3710840	episode. She frickin' wore her cosplay of Janet from the medium place.
3710880	3711680	The medium place?
3711680	3712480	I think that's what it was.
3712480	3713160	The good place?
3713160	3715160	Well, but in the story, there's.
3715160	3717960	Yeah. So anyway, I've never watched that show.
3717960	3722920	It's fine. She's she wore one of her Janet cosplays and she met the actress, like the
3722920	3726960	actress was at like some like bar that was set up to be a good place thing.
3726960	3728800	And she frickin went there and met her.
3728800	3730520	That's awesome. They got a picture. Yeah.
3730520	3731800	So, yeah, it's pretty awesome.
3731800	3735600	Zigzaggy dress, too, which I thought was like so tacky, but it looks good on her.
3735600	3737840	Yeah. Yeah. It fit the theme.
3737840	3742400	So, yeah. Anyway, the other stuff out of San Diego Comic-Con, lots of people talk about
3742400	3744240	the Marvel. There's a lot of Marvel movies.
3744240	3751160	The Marvel movies had a ton of like so much stuff between the TV series, like a Hawkeye TV
3751200	3753040	series and a Loki TV series.
3753040	3756400	And the TV series sound interesting, but like, I don't know.
3756400	3758880	And they were talking about they're going to do another Thor movie.
3758880	3761040	But this time it's going to go to Natalie Portman.
3761040	3762720	Well, they did that in the comics, too.
3762720	3765080	Yeah. Men calm thy tits.
3765080	3769040	Well, there are already guys being shit about it, of course.
3769040	3770520	Block, delete, move on.
3770520	3776280	But it will at any rate, though, there's this thing going around about them.
3776320	3782280	Oh, the first Marvel LGBT characters, Valkyrie, read the comics character, the characters
3782280	3786400	have existed. Valkyrie is not the first, the first of the big screen, maybe on TV.
3786400	3791840	Yeah. But but Marvel has really had a leg up in the game for a while.
3791840	3794920	Yeah. Well, anyway, I'm talking about the games from it.
3794920	3799160	I just know a lot of you are thinking about, you know, the the cinema stuff, but they did
3799160	3802680	announce some updates for the games, including Marvel Ultimate Alliance three, which I'm
3802680	3804160	kind of surprised you're not all over that right now.
3804160	3805480	Dark soccer, because that did just come out.
3807160	3810320	I have so many other things right now that I'm spending money on.
3810320	3812200	Sure, I understand. I bought a dress.
3812200	3816960	OK, well, you know, when you do decide to jump into Marvel Ultimate Alliance three, maybe
3816960	3818480	you want to pick up some of the DLC.
3818480	3824880	They did announce at SDCC that on September 30th, Marvel Knights Curse of the Vampire
3824880	3830600	will be released where Blade Moon Knight Morbius and Moon Knight.
3830600	3832600	I'm I'm sorry. I thought I saw a comma there.
3832600	3836480	Blade Moon Knight Morbius and the Punisher will be playable characters.
3836480	3838160	Y'all got me. I don't care about any of them.
3838160	3840440	I don't follow comic books as close as you guys do.
3840440	3842000	And I don't follow comic books either.
3842000	3845960	But thanks to Lego Marvel superheroes for making me familiar with all the obscure
3845960	3847840	characters. There you go. There you go.
3847840	3851600	And Moon Knight is honestly the Marvel answer to Batman.
3851600	3859560	And then apparently there will be, I guess, a free update where Cyclops and Colossus will
3859560	3860720	be added to the game.
3860720	3862480	So you won't even have to do DLC for them.
3862480	3865840	You're just going to be able to grab them as like free updates.
3865840	3869120	So and they're they're very much like the comic book looking ones.
3869120	3872240	So that's pretty cool. So people will be into that.
3872240	3877640	And another thing that they showed, they showed more of the Marvel's Avengers game,
3877640	3881640	the one that, you know, Square is essentially going to be putting out.
3881640	3883120	I saw the leaked footage of that.
3883120	3886080	Yeah, there was some leaked footage that came out.
3886080	3891200	I try not to put too much stock in leaked footage because, you know, it looks bad because
3891600	3892840	I thought it looked good, actually.
3892840	3894800	Well, no, no, no, I know the quality.
3894800	3899240	Yeah, terrible. But yeah, I mean, the game, like what I could see of the gameplay
3899240	3903440	definitely looked like, oh, this is it looked more interesting than what they showed us,
3903440	3904720	what they showed at E3.
3904880	3906440	So it kind of blows my mind.
3906440	3909000	Like, I understand that, like, you know, this is supposed to be a special thing.
3909200	3912640	I can't believe they haven't already released an official rendering of that
3912640	3913880	playthrough out to the Internet.
3913880	3918520	I think that will probably come during Gamescom, if I were to guess.
3918560	3921400	Oh, good thought, because that's just around the corner, too, right?
3921400	3923400	Yeah. Yeah, interesting.
3923400	3925280	So but the gameplay did look really nice.
3925280	3930480	And then they said that, yeah, Gamescom will be a thing from August 20 to 24th.
3930480	3934080	And then they're saying officially this unveiling will come out in September.
3934480	3936560	That's dumb. It's just it is.
3936560	3938000	Yeah, I know. Just get it out there.
3938000	3938880	Why make everybody wait?
3938880	3941320	I mean, I guess they want to save stuff for Gamescom.
3941320	3942400	I don't know, but they're not.
3942400	3944200	They're doing it after Gamescom.
3944200	3945120	So that's lame.
3945120	3949160	Bobby Blackwell says it's apparently the same as the behind closed doors E3 demo.
3949360	3951840	So I guess this is something they're kind of taking around.
3952040	3952560	Whatever.
3952760	3957480	I just I just feel like when you know that E3 did not go over as well as you'd hoped,
3957680	3961160	I would think that you want to, like, get a little more out there.
3961360	3964160	By the way, speaking of movies, because I'm looking at the little news ticker
3964160	3967720	bar at the bottom here, when we broadcast on Twitch, we had the news that ticks by.
3967920	3970440	So even though it's not exclusively gaming related,
3970640	3974080	a little thing just ticked by about Top Gun Maverick because that trailer just came
3974120	3977520	out. I mean, Top Gun 2 Maverick is still an asshole.
3977720	3981840	I had no idea that not only were they doing a Top Gun sequel,
3981840	3984600	but that they got Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer to do it.
3984800	3988000	Hasn't Val Kilmer had, like, unhealthy amounts of plastic surgery?
3988000	3990000	Like, doesn't he not look the same?
3990200	3992520	Maybe I'm making that up, but I thought that was like a thing.
3992720	3995360	And now I'm going to have to take a look and see.
3995560	3999480	I did not watch that trailer, but I have to say at some point,
3999680	4001560	I did watch the Cats trailer.
4001760	4002880	I'm so excited.
4002920	4005520	I got it. I think I'm going to be honest.
4005520	4006400	I have an honest moment.
4006400	4008880	I think the Internet is giving it more shit than it deserves.
4009080	4012120	Well, and the people who are giving it shit clearly never saw the play.
4012320	4014080	Right. Well, but let's be real there.
4014280	4015400	A lot of people hated the play.
4015600	4017640	Well, those people are wrong.
4017840	4019920	But I'm going to give this an explanation
4020120	4024120	to the people who have not seen Cats in a stage production.
4024320	4027840	The stage is oversized furniture.
4027880	4032920	It is scaled down to where the human actors are cat sized.
4033120	4034840	So for the movie,
4035040	4039960	it's a perfect stylistic choice because it is exactly what it was like on stage.
4039960	4042720	And I think no one is complaining about the set pieces.
4042920	4045200	The set pieces look amazing.
4045400	4047640	The Cats,
4048640	4051440	to be fair, I'm like on Broadway, they didn't look great.
4051640	4055960	But but that looked fine, though, like this is uncanny valley, though.
4056120	4056880	I just I don't know.
4056880	4059440	The CGI doesn't bother me as much as is bothering other people.
4059440	4060240	I don't know what it is.
4060440	4062120	I'm just like, I don't know.
4062120	4064440	But like I see all these things where it's like, wow,
4064440	4066800	we have to apologize to the creators of Sonic the Hedgehog.
4066800	4067520	Now we see the casting.
4067720	4071160	But like when I watch the trailer, like the minute that Jennifer Hudson
4071360	4075320	started belting memory, I was like, this is what I will be paying money for.
4075520	4077360	Because, yeah, I mean, I'm sure it'll be fine.
4077560	4079960	Wallace like Jennifer Hudson is well.
4080160	4083960	And on top of that, of getting Judi Dench as
4084160	4085400	crap, I forgot the character's name,
4085440	4087960	but the character was originally male on the stage play.
4088160	4090640	And having Judi Dench play that character
4090840	4094640	for me is how I think that character always should have been.
4094840	4097120	And on top of that, it was a male in the stage play.
4097120	4098960	It's the old Deuteronomy or Deuteronomy.
4098960	4099480	That was it.
4099680	4105080	And on top of that, of also having what's his fuck is Macavity.
4105280	4109040	James Corden, was it or no, I was I don't know any of the character names.
4109040	4111840	But it is. Yeah, I think that's who they got him as
4111840	4116840	Macavity and Macavity was like my favorite character on stage.
4117040	4120080	I'm I the CGI doesn't bother me as much as others.
4120280	4121160	And here's the thing.
4121160	4123960	At the end of the day, like it's by the guy that did Les Mis.
4123960	4125320	And all I have to say is that Aria
4125320	4128640	Snark and I went to see Les Mis, the one with like Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe.
4128840	4129680	We went to see that.
4129880	4133160	We sobbed for two and a half hours straight.
4133360	4137160	So I will start crying right here on this show.
4137160	4138640	If you start singing songs from Les Mis,
4138720	4141800	if I even think about Anne Hathaway doing I dream to dream.
4142000	4143760	Oh, God, she was born for it.
4143960	4146960	But OK, I'm going to tell you one thing, Rob.
4147160	4150600	When you're not on air, OK, I want you to go and look up.
4150800	4152720	It's like 36 Jean Valjean's.
4152920	4153480	Oh, yeah.
4153680	4157560	And it's people who play Jean Valjean in different countries.
4157760	4160520	And guess who the Japanese one is?
4160720	4162800	Chairman Kaga from Iron Chef.
4163000	4167760	Oh, how funny because he actually he played
4167960	4170480	fuck, what was the
4170680	4172760	the cop's name?
4173440	4179000	Well, I can't think of it anyway, but it's just absolutely amazing.
4179320	4184680	Fifth dream today in our chat says it's called cats, not can'ts.
4184880	4186520	I don't know why I thought that was funny, but I did.
4186720	4190600	All right. Anyway, this is not a podcast about cats, but we had to look at y'all
4190600	4193680	are talking about it like Twitter to not shut up for an entire day about it.
4193880	4194920	One tangent more.
4194920	4197880	I will say it did look like I can poke a little fun.
4198080	4200400	Another topic, another destiny.
4200600	4204280	I can poke a little fun at humor and stuff and even things that I like.
4204280	4205560	I will say I'll give you this good joke.
4205560	4209640	So last night I actually hosted like a horror film festival for the first time,
4209840	4212520	which I know is funny because you all know, like I'm super into horror movies.
4212520	4216040	Right. But what I did, I came out on stage and I'm like, what's up, Sacramento?
4216040	4217360	You ready to see some movies?
4217560	4221840	And I said, are you ready to see the most horrible, gruesome,
4222000	4225040	disgusting thing you've ever seen hit the big screen?
4225040	4226560	And the audience is going, yeah.
4226760	4230680	And I go roll the cat's trailer and that got a good laugh.
4230880	4233040	But I could I can poke fun at it.
4233240	4236480	Come on. It's it's good for judging you right now.
4236480	4237880	All right. All right. Moving on.
4238080	4242800	Let's get to you've been waiting to talk about this one, Darcy.
4243000	4250400	Yes. So this and I actually did download the game before I had this article on it,
4250400	4256600	but it's by the creators of Journey and it's called Sky Children of Light.
4256600	4261520	It's a free game. You do have an app purchases, just saying, but it's so pretty.
4261720	4263400	Like the moment I saw it, I really wanted to play it.
4263600	4266320	And right now it's only on iOS,
4266520	4269720	but it does sort of feel like it's an offshoot of Journey.
4269920	4274400	So you basically play a child of light who is a caped figure going across these
4274600	4278720	different realms and uses light to revive stars and reform constellations.
4278720	4281440	Prince of the universe, sorry, Prince of all cosmos.
4281640	4285800	Not quite, but you interact with your world and you have other players.
4285800	4289840	There are other sparks of light in the game and you use gestures the same way.
4290040	4293600	So this just seems like a logical expansion on the idea of Journey.
4293800	4296280	But you're now on a wider scale
4296480	4301040	and it does have that same anonymity where you don't know who your other parties are.
4301240	4303520	And you also don't like talk.
4303720	4306840	You use, you know, your gestures, but you can add
4306840	4310200	your friends to it so that you can play with legit people that you know.
4310320	4313240	But you also have that interaction of other people in the game.
4313440	4315280	It's just absolutely gorgeous.
4315280	4318760	The moment I saw a trailer for it, I was like, oh my God, I need to play this.
4318960	4326120	Now you do have some pay tiers to get like extra goodies, because of course you do.
4326320	4331800	But they don't seem ridiculously unaffordable,
4332000	4333920	but it is free to play.
4333920	4336200	You don't have to pay anything to do much in it.
4336240	4337720	But it's really pretty.
4337720	4340120	I really, I really think I'm going to enjoy playing it.
4340320	4341560	Yeah, I want to check it out.
4341760	4343600	I need something that isn't idle pouring.
4343800	4347840	But I must confess, I'm a little bit like
4348040	4351480	shook, I guess, that, you know, an experience like this and the creators
4351680	4355120	of Journey that is very immersive and beautiful and stuff is kind of confined
4355320	4358960	to my phone, like I'm a little bit like I wish they I wish they targeted one.
4359160	4360040	Confined though?
4360240	4364280	I mean, that's putting a personal limitation on it, though.
4364320	4368040	You can do the your little touch screen right here, especially those of us who
4368040	4372360	have touch screen, my little touch screen, you said it, that's not really that little.
4372560	4380120	The thing is, is that this is a power that we have now that we did not have
4380320	4385680	when we were starting off as gamers, this is a legitimate forum to play a game on.
4385880	4391680	And if you have something that is absolutely made with this console in mind,
4391840	4394360	then you can't get an immersive experience in playing it.
4394560	4395880	I guess I'll give you that.
4396080	4399680	And, you know, maybe in my mind I'm referencing too much to Journey because
4399880	4402920	some of the stylistic, you know, things seem to be in common.
4402920	4405160	And I would not want to play Journey on my phone.
4405360	4407040	But I also don't want them to have just
4407040	4409240	copied Journey and made a new version of that for the phone.
4409240	4410800	I don't think I doubt that's what they did.
4410800	4412600	They've been working on this game for like seven or eight years.
4412800	4414120	It looks unique enough.
4414120	4415480	I mean, I'll be perfectly honest.
4415680	4416840	That was why I got it.
4416960	4417840	I'll check it out.
4417840	4419480	But like, you know, it's got a lot to live.
4419720	4422520	Honestly, and I don't want to sound dramatic,
4422720	4428160	but like Journey is probably the best video game they'll release this decade.
4428360	4432480	Now, what if you play this and you decide that you like this?
4432680	4433960	Then great.
4434160	4437840	Then I'll file it up there with games like Pokemon Go and Ingress and things
4437840	4439200	that I enjoy playing on my cell phone.
4439240	4441720	And one thing that I've been really happy
4441920	4446200	about is that I really do feel like mobile gaming has really been
4446200	4448520	revolutionized within the last few years.
4448560	4453560	Like they're really pushing the envelope of what our portable devices can do.
4453760	4456280	Well, especially with now retroactive
4456480	4460280	updates being done to get more performance out of older phones.
4460480	4464000	You know, I think that, you know, people who may not even be
4464000	4467360	on the most up to date device can still get the same experiences.
4467560	4471480	And I think that it's absolutely wonderful that now,
4471680	4474960	you know, the hardware and software engineers are taking into account
4474960	4477880	that people may not always be getting the biggest and newest of it.
4478040	4482280	And so the software developers, too, they're taking that into account as well,
4482480	4486880	making those games as accessible to people on older devices as they can.
4487080	4490280	And I'm really happy and really proud.
4490280	4491600	And I want everyone who says something
4491800	4494160	about planned obsolescence to shut the fuck up.
4494360	4496200	It doesn't exist.
4496400	4498160	All right, well, let's move on.
4498160	4502880	We got a few more stories to get to before we get to your thoughts on Discord.
4503080	4505040	Let's get to Loki.
4505240	4506440	All right.
4506640	4507720	So this is pretty cool.
4507920	4512480	There's a fan made game that's kind of done in NES style.
4512680	4514600	And of course, it's for John Wick.
4514800	4518440	So they actually have this available to play on
4518640	4521520	itch.io so you can check that out.
4521720	4523520	It looks like
4523720	4532040	let me spell this M-U-R-I-L-O-D-E-V dot itch.io slash john dash wick.
4532240	4533960	And you can check it out.
4534160	4536720	It's kind of a run and gun style.
4536760	4538320	It looks a little bit like itch.io.
4538320	4540080	It's not actually an S game either.
4540280	4541760	It's probably an S inspired.
4541960	4544000	Well, that's why I said an S inspired game.
4544200	4547600	It's not actually an NES game,
4547800	4549680	but it looks pretty cool and looks pretty hard.
4549880	4551440	So go check it out.
4551640	4556280	Of course, being that, you know, it's supposed to be very difficult.
4556280	4558240	There's no extra lives, no continues,
4558440	4561480	and you have one life and that's it, and it's game over.
4561680	4564400	So I don't know.
4564600	4565560	Pretty cool, though.
4565800	4567200	I love fan games.
4567400	4570880	I have not seen a single John Wick movie, so this will probably do nothing for me.
4570880	4573400	Right. All I know is don't fuck with his dog.
4573400	4574800	It's an awesome action movie.
4575000	4577600	Yeah, well, I'm not just I'm not a hater.
4577800	4580760	I just it's not that not been on my list of things to see.
4580960	4582760	I probably because of this whole travel
4582760	4584600	thing, I'm probably not going to get to see The Lion King.
4584800	4586680	So but you already have.
4586680	4588400	Although, yeah, I heard I heard it's not good.
4588400	4590480	But I guess a lot of people are going to see it anyway.
4590680	4591920	So, yeah.
4592120	4595080	All right. I kind of want to see it because
4595280	4601320	Mustafa, well, anything with Beyonce's name on it, I'm at least going to look at it.
4601520	4603840	All right. Oh, say it again.
4604040	4605160	Let's move on to a story.
4605360	4607240	So you mean not Mustafa.
4607440	4611760	I said, oh, let's move on to a story about the Nintendo Switch.
4611960	4614480	And with this Nintendo Switch story,
4614680	4619560	we're talking about a new, I guess, revamp for the core system.
4619560	4620600	And that's kind of interesting.
4620600	4622280	So the core system is going to be getting
4622520	4625040	kind of like a under the hood revamp.
4625240	4626880	You mean a pro edition?
4627080	4631240	No, no, not a pro edition, but just kind of like a
4631440	4635120	under the hood revamp that's going to add some various battery life to it.
4635320	4639000	So right now the current system will run from two point five to six point five
4639200	4642720	hours, but the new battery, which will just start showing up on shelves.
4642720	4645040	And I don't think they plan on like advertising it or whatever,
4645240	4648840	but it's going to do four point five to nine hours, meaning like I don't think
4648840	4652400	they're going to advertise this new campaign like it's a new Nintendo Switch.
4652400	4656080	No, it's just going to quietly replace the switches that are on shelves already,
4656280	4659240	probably because they realize they want the current stock to sell out.
4659440	4666440	So you will want to look for a model number HAC-001-01.
4666440	4667600	So you want to look for it because the
4667800	4670760	other one will not have the extra dash 01 at the end.
4670960	4673520	If you are interested in getting one of these that has a new battery,
4673720	4677640	I'm not going to spend three hundred dollars on a new switch just for a new battery.
4677800	4679080	But it is interesting that it's happening.
4679280	4682200	It's funny because you say the whole pro switch or whatever.
4682400	4685120	Maybe this is what they're doing for now,
4685120	4687640	just because it's like it was something they were going to do anyway.
4687800	4689800	But they're not ready to do that switch pro yet.
4690000	4692200	Honestly, they have cases that have extra
4692400	4696600	battery packs so you can buy and being that the switch charges by USB-C,
4696800	4702520	you could buy, you know, one of the cell phone battery packs or whatever to plug
4702520	4705760	into it as well to give it some extra time if you really want to extend the battery.
4706000	4706920	Great comparison.
4706920	4711800	EsterShow100Matt says this is like when the 360 got the HDMI port added in.
4712000	4713200	Yeah, yeah.
4713400	4717040	I remember going around and looking for 360s with that skew.
4717240	4719480	Shad Starzik in chat says the boxes are
4719680	4723840	changing too, at least in other regions, so you could tell the difference that way.
4723920	4725800	I told you the story about when Dan and I
4725800	4730160	went to go find the last PlayStation that had an IO port and we made the KB go
4730360	4734840	through every single one of theirs until we found literally one left.
4735000	4736760	And we still have it. Yeah.
4736960	4739960	But those IO ports were great because it lets you use those little plug in thing.
4740080	4742200	That's how I was able to play my first bootleg games.
4742320	4743720	Well, you know, we actually had a first
4743720	4746480	model PlayStation that we would just do the single switch on.
4746680	4747880	Oh, those were the days.
4748080	4749080	Yeah.
4749280	4750760	You know, I will say, you know, it came up
4750760	4754080	earlier about a PlayStation classic and should I bother getting one?
4754080	4755080	I was kind of like meh.
4755280	4759360	But I got to say, I don't know, maybe if I got like a PlayStation classic that all
4759560	4764120	the old like DDR and the Beatmania stuff and the stuff I used to really love on the
4764120	4766440	imports and stuff, I might be into that actually.
4766440	4769040	So you can you can hack all that stuff on your your mini PlayStation.
4769040	4771400	Yes, you can. Rob, we should tell people what we did.
4771600	4774360	What? What we acquired or started to acquire.
4774560	4776360	What are TurboGrafx scissors?
4776560	4779120	Oh, that actually came up, I think, on Bobby's show.
4779120	4780600	OK, that's OK. I'll say it again.
4780600	4782800	Yeah, we did. Finally, I got the TurboGrafx.
4782800	4785640	So did you. They took forever to get the order up.
4785840	4788480	And I'll be honest, I really I feel kind
4788680	4792560	of guilty for supporting Prime Day after everything that was going on.
4792600	4794240	But technically you're preordering and not
4794240	4796840	actually shipping something, the money didn't come out on Prime Day.
4796840	4799760	So, yeah, the money, the money, I didn't spend any money on Prime Day.
4799960	4803920	So I guess I can still keep up with my having boycotted because I didn't buy
4804120	4806720	anything else on Prime Day or days, I should say.
4806720	4810760	But it just it really bugged me that it took so long to get it up because I was
4810960	4815800	just like, huh, it took long to get it up because I was really antsy for it.
4816000	4819720	But what I'm hoping is that we it can get
4819720	4824680	a copy patch to where you can apply translation patches to like stuff like Snatcher.
4824680	4826040	Yeah, that would be awesome.
4826240	4829080	Yeah, I think I've got like a burn of the Sega CD Snatcher,
4829280	4832160	but I would love to to have this one patched.
4832160	4834640	I wish they would just do like an official translation.
4834640	4836520	But I realize it's asking for a lot.
4836520	4838320	I'm certain that this is not an armship
4838320	4841560	running some sort of Linux or anything that can't be hacked.
4841760	4842920	I'll be perfectly honest.
4843120	4846560	I want a good translation of police knots, too.
4846760	4848760	All right, well, let's take a trip down memory lane.
4848800	4851320	Since you brought up the TurboGrafx 16,
4851520	4853920	I don't think that's where our classic of the week is this week.
4854120	4856400	But every week, Dark Soccer likes to step
4856400	4858680	into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey,
4858880	4861040	you brat should be checking out this game this week.
4861040	4862880	It's the classic game of the week.
4862880	4864920	And Dark Soccer, what did you pick for our listeners this week?
4864920	4867040	I went completely off console this time.
4867040	4868200	You kind of did. I did.
4868400	4871800	I well did. I went for worms.
4872000	4876520	Worms came out in nineteen ninety five.
4876720	4879440	Like, how is that for old school?
4879640	4884040	It was it's a turn based artillery tactical game.
4884240	4889080	It was developed by Team 17 and it was, of course, the very first one.
4889280	4892480	It actually let me double check.
4892680	4898440	It first had a release on actually isn't saying what it was first released on
4898640	4899960	Amiga Amiga, actually.
4900160	4902000	So it did come out.
4902200	4908160	I stand corrected because European release was on Amiga CD 32 Game Boy and Mac.
4908360	4913040	So this was on non PC systems first.
4913240	4916120	It came out on the Mega Drive after that and then got U.S.
4916320	4920600	releases for so the first U.S. release was on PC for DOS.
4920800	4922320	And then we got PlayStation.
4922520	4927120	We got a European SNES release and I'll go into the rest of these later.
4927320	4931960	The last release was on Atari Jaguar, but it is a like I said,
4932160	4937280	a turn based artillery game very similar to like scorched earth where you control
4937480	4942280	worms and you select different worms and you use their tools for where they are
4942480	4946400	to attack the opponent's worms and then, you know, win the game.
4946400	4947800	So you've got like different tools like
4948000	4952400	bungee and a ninja rope and grenades and all this crap.
4952600	4957240	And in the first game you had over 50 different weapons and tools to use.
4957240	4960480	And you can actually save your team as
4960680	4964960	a scheme so that you can just pull that for playing whenever you've got different
4964960	4968480	kinds of terrains to you have like an island, which is the train floating on
4968680	4973640	water or a cave where you've got, you know, water underneath the cave.
4973840	4977840	You've got certain, you know, other weapons that are not
4978040	4980680	overridable, you know, just different things like that.
4980880	4985640	And of course, if a worm is hit by a weapon, then the damage dealt to the worm
4985640	4988480	is removed from its own health.
4988680	4992320	So basically you've got to eliminate all the other worms.
4992520	4996120	So worms die when a worm enters the water
4996320	5001080	either by falling off the island or falling through a hole when a worm is thrown off
5001280	5005160	to either side of the arena or when the health is reduced to zero.
5005360	5010520	So basically the game was originally created by Andy Davidson as an entry
5010520	5014640	for Blitz basic programming competition that was run by Amiga Format magazine.
5014840	5016680	So this was a contest game.
5016880	5017920	So how's that?
5018120	5022840	And it was, I mean, really just like
5023040	5025960	bare bones, of course, at first, because it was basic.
5026160	5030000	But the game was called Total Wormage.
5030200	5034720	The theory is that it was referenced to Total Carnage and it didn't win.
5034920	5037000	But the game was then sent to several
5037200	5041920	publishers and then taken to the European Computer Trade Show.
5042080	5044080	He met up with a gentleman named Mark Forman,
5044280	5046840	who is the head games buyer at Gem Distribution,
5047040	5053040	and they had him talk to Ocean Team 17 and they made an offer on the spot.
5053240	5056840	So you've got to stay persistent with those games, guys.
5057040	5058600	And then
5059480	5062880	so there were, you know, there was a lot more done.
5063080	5071160	It's funny since it had a lot of references because it was developed in Yorkshire.
5071360	5074440	And so they used a lot of different,
5074640	5079400	you know, the voice samples that were, you know, done in native accents to that area.
5079600	5081400	And so
5081600	5085560	there was quite a bit that went in for some of the later releases,
5085760	5090800	like the PlayStation release had a lot of negotiation going on because
5091000	5094960	SCEA, Sony Computer Entertainment of America,
5095160	5097880	didn't want 2D games on the console.
5098080	5103040	But the Saturn version was a straight up port of the PlayStation when it came out.
5103240	5106160	The last release that came out was Atari Jaguar,
5106360	5111240	also developed by Team 17, published by Telegames, May 15th, 1998.
5111440	5113120	And
5113320	5117720	it was one of the last remaining software pieces that came out on the Jaguar.
5117920	5123240	It was available through direct order and from Electronics Boutique,
5123440	5126000	if we remember the old EB.
5126200	5128600	And then it was, again,
5128800	5133080	one of the last games that had the Atari name on it officially.
5134880	5139720	The, you know, it was very cartoon like for the game, the style, you know, it is fun.
5139920	5143000	It's a funny game. God damn played a lot of Worms for a while.
5143200	5144720	This game was a lot of fun.
5144720	5147240	Like I'm kind of with, who said it in chat?
5147240	5150680	I think it was Dark Tetsuya saying, I don't think I played this one too much.
5150880	5153720	I do remember the successor, Scorched Earth on PC, though.
5153920	5156280	Technically, Scorched Earth came out before this.
5156280	5157360	It came out before.
5157360	5160520	And they're actually not related, except the fact that they're a similar type
5160520	5163160	of genre, like Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat type of thing.
5163160	5165080	I mean, Worms 2 was this equal to this.
5165080	5167040	And then Worms, Dan played a lot of Worms Armageddon.
5167040	5168200	That was and there's another game
5168400	5172120	called Tank Wars on PC that I think was pre Scorched Earth.
5172120	5174080	Yeah. I mean, this is not any genre.
5174080	5176000	It just would be a fun game to stream sometime.
5176000	5178200	I want to play Scorched Earth on stream sometime.
5178400	5180480	See what I remember? Yeah, those guys are fun.
5180680	5182520	At any rate, this one actually had
5182720	5185400	an expansion that was called Worms Reinforcements.
5185600	5187160	It came out in 1996.
5187360	5191120	And then later on, it had a new version
5191320	5194600	that was called Worms United that had both of them on there.
5194600	5196280	And it was only released for the PC.
5196280	5197720	It had a single player campaign
5197920	5200720	and the ability to customize your level and sound packs,
5200920	5203680	which was, by the way, already available on Amiga.
5203880	5207000	And it had an introductory full motion video.
5207200	5208680	And then Worms Director's Cut,
5208680	5213640	which was the direct sequel, it only came out on Amiga.
5213840	5215640	It was a big success.
5215840	5221520	I mean, by March 1986, it reached over two hundred fifty thousand copies.
5221720	5223560	And that's in less than a year.
5223760	5227840	So this was it came out November 95 and this was by March 96.
5228040	5235240	So it for all the versions, it sold well over five million units by 2006.
5235440	5240840	You know, some people were like, eh, and other people like, oh, my God,
5240840	5244720	this is the best game, but some people were like comparing it to Lemmings,
5244920	5248720	which I'll be honest, I don't think Lemmings is a very rewarding game.
5248920	5253880	But overall, it got really, really positive reviews.
5254080	5256880	And the Saturn version was considered particularly good.
5257080	5259920	Of course, the Saturn was a 2D powerhouse.
5260120	5263520	So, you know, some people like the biggest
5263720	5267520	complaints were about the slowness of large multiplayer
5267720	5270440	and how imprecise the keyboard controls could be.
5270640	5273720	That's, of course, playing on a computer.
5273920	5279200	But, you know, considering what your Internet was like in 95 and 96,
5279400	5284040	we were still just getting past dial up at this point.
5284240	5288840	So the fact that it had reliable multiplayer at all is pretty astounding.
5289000	5297520	And so it was actually the runner up by EGM as the strategy game of the year.
5297720	5301520	The only thing above it was Dragon Force, which is a pretty awesome game.
5301720	5303840	And there you have it, Worms.
5304040	5308440	All right, great pick, because, you know, this game that I remember playing on PC,
5308640	5311040	again, not as much as like Scorched Earth and Tank Wars,
5311240	5315960	but definitely you kind of saw the, I guess, like the evolution of those ideas
5315960	5319800	now, but like, oh, but the tanks can move and, you know, the worms can move.
5320000	5323800	And it was a little more like this free for all type of commentary.
5323800	5325880	Yeah, especially in the later Worms games.
5326080	5327400	It kind of reminded me of like a cross
5327600	5332040	between like the Tank Wars or what have you and Lemmings in some in some ways.
5332040	5333840	Yeah, but I think Lemmings is boring.
5334040	5335920	Oh, you're not a big fan of Lemmings,
5336120	5339640	especially since like the whole game is based on a fallacy.
5339840	5343240	Did you know that Lemmings do not follow each other blindly?
5343440	5344920	That was actually staged.
5344920	5347600	Well, I think I obviously I think for the game,
5347600	5349600	they probably do some creative liberties for sure.
5349800	5354320	But, you know, yeah, then I mean, honestly enough,
5354520	5358960	it is just one of those games that really was sort of genre expansive.
5358960	5360360	Does that make sense? No, I gotcha.
5360560	5362040	Yeah. So anyway. All right.
5362040	5365120	Well, we are going to do just a couple more things here and we'll see if anybody
5365320	5369480	wants to call tonight on our Discord server over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.
5369680	5371240	You can head over to the green room.
5371240	5373120	And if you want to leave us a little key
5373160	5376080	on the Orange Launch Radio, what it is you want to talk to us about.
5376280	5379800	All that information about how to do that is down below on our Twitch page
5380000	5382280	over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network.
5382480	5385520	But every week we also like to travel around the world and check out what is
5385720	5388240	coming out on a game shelf near you, Loki.
5388440	5392040	Not a whole lot this time, but we've got Beyond Two Souls.
5392240	5396240	That's coming out on PC exclusively on the Epic Store.
5396440	5399840	Tetris Effect coming out this week on PC as well.
5400040	5403040	Also exclusive to the Epic Store.
5403600	5406400	And then, of course, we have Raiden five
5406600	5411800	Director's Cut on Nintendo Switch, Kill La Kill.
5412240	5419040	Yes, Kill La Kill looks like if that's on PC, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.
5419240	5420600	Did you ever watch the anime?
5420800	5424520	No. Kill La Kill is out there and pretty fun.
5424720	5429600	We have Wolfenstein Cyberpilot on PlayStation 4 and PC and Wolfenstein
5429600	5433600	Youngblood on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
5433800	5437240	And that's it.
5437440	5439200	All right, traveling over to Japan and
5439400	5442720	checking out some of the releases over there we have.
5442920	5444400	I'm just sorry, I think I might have
5444400	5447040	accidentally unplugged the Internet on this computer, but luckily that doesn't
5447040	5449040	affect the show anymore because everything's on that computer.
5449240	5451200	But anyhow,
5451400	5454800	talking about what's coming out in Japan, we have Kill La Kill.
5455000	5457160	The game if is also getting a Japanese
5457160	5463200	release on the 25th along with Spike Volleyball making and then making lovers.
5463400	5465600	But without a not a space, but like a star.
5465800	5470640	That's I guess a game that's making star lovers, star lovers or making making
5470840	5474400	multiplication lovers, depending on the usage of the asterisk there.
5474600	5476840	Those are the big releases in Japan this week.
5477040	5479760	And seeing what is on the switch,
5479960	5485160	we have some of the Kill La Kill is out on the Switch game as well.
5485400	5490840	And then Rune Factory 4 Special gets a regular and a little limited edition box
5491040	5497440	set there this week, and Doraemon's Story of Seasons is also out this week.
5497640	5502640	And let's see, Saikyo Shooting Library Volume 1 is also out this week.
5502840	5504040	Saikyo means greatest. Yeah.
5504040	5504960	So I'm curious.
5504960	5507280	It's City Connection is the company that's putting that.
5507280	5508600	So I'm kind of curious what games they have.
5508800	5511160	Wasn't that a NES game? City Connection?
5511360	5512720	Yes, I think it was.
5512720	5514800	So maybe I'll do that for a classic game.
5514960	5518160	Fishing Spirits is also out on the Switch this week.
5518360	5522240	And Pio Fiore no Banshu is also out.
5522440	5525040	So I'm looking at that shooting library to see what games are in it.
5525240	5528720	It's six eShop titles in one bundle.
5528920	5534920	So it's Strikers 1945, 1945 2, Soul Divide, Dragon Blaze and Zero Gunner 2.
5535120	5538280	Not bad. Yeah, not too not too shabby.
5538480	5541040	All right. How about Europe?
5541240	5543760	All of these come out on the 25th.
5543800	5547880	So we have a Wolfenstein Cyberpilot VR.
5548080	5549800	We have Wolfenstein Youngblood.
5550000	5551640	We have Kill la Kill.
5551840	5555360	And we also have Fire Emblem Three Houses.
5555560	5557040	All right, sissy.
5557240	5560120	Well, the next part of our show is where we would go to the mailbag where you guys
5560320	5564160	can email us every week. Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com
5564160	5565600	is the place to send your emails.
5565800	5566560	I'm refreshing it.
5566760	5570160	I do believe last we checked, unfortunately, it's empty.
5570360	5572920	Yeah, we don't really have anything that's there.
5572920	5575000	So that memory.
5575200	5577160	Oh, no, it means Drag Race talk.
5577360	5583120	Memory all alone in the moonlight.
5583320	5584880	I don't have a good voice.
5585080	5587200	Oh, I think your voice is plenty fine.
5587400	5589320	What are we doing? Karaoke Revolution on stream.
5589520	5591080	I don't know.
5591280	5592960	Don't they have the Twitch sings now?
5592960	5594360	You don't even know that's right.
5594360	5595800	There's Twitch sings.
5595800	5597080	That's something that's got a wow.
5597080	5598200	I hit the table with my ring.
5598320	5602080	I was so excited. That's something we got to hit yourself with your ring.
5602240	5604040	I have pinched that little.
5604240	5605320	Yeah, like we did it.
5605520	5610040	Yeah, but I was like trying to get something on my forehead when I was
5610040	5614040	in sister makeup and I bopped myself in the forehead with my ring and it hurt.
5614240	5615640	I just did it on purpose.
5615840	5616840	So.
5617040	5618760	All right. So what night for our Twitch sings stream?
5618960	5624080	So SSJ 100 Matt says last time we did Karaoke Revolution, things happened.
5624280	5626120	It's been a long time.
5626320	5629240	You know what? I'm actually not as self-conscious about my voice anymore,
5629440	5631080	so I'll sing something.
5631080	5631480	Why not?
5631480	5634760	If I'm going to have Travis Donovan blasting for like the last 10 years
5634960	5638520	of my life when I went to Great America and I couldn't really hear it.
5638720	5641320	So life is a mystery.
5641520	5645040	It's like a really bad opening to like a prayer, but I'll sing that again.
5645240	5646720	I wonder what I should sing, though,
5646920	5650520	because I'm not really a show tunes person per se.
5650720	5654200	But do you know what my go to what are your go to songs at Karaoke?
5654400	5656760	Well, I did Lady Fingers last time I did Karaoke.
5656960	5658440	Oh, which, you know, that's kind of like
5658440	5662080	my personal theme song is Lady Fingers by Luscious Jackson,
5662280	5665360	which, you know, was one of my favorite bands in the 90s.
5665560	5667760	I love Luscious Jackson.
5667960	5670720	And I think one of my others was Banned
5670920	5673840	on the Run by Paul McCartney and Wings.
5674040	5677360	Did you see the Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr had a reunion on stage?
5677560	5679720	That's pretty bad ass.
5679920	5683040	My go to karaoke song, do you remember what it is?
5683240	5685240	I sang it almost every week.
5685920	5687600	I know that you sang
5687800	5689080	Birdhouse in Your Soul for me.
5689280	5690840	Oh, I did do that one once.
5691040	5692520	And the key was weird.
5692640	5694960	Yeah. And you had to change keys halfway through the song.
5695160	5697800	And I did not keys, but
5698000	5700840	dropping, dropping the pitch to hit no
5701040	5702560	hand in my pocket by Alanis Morissette.
5702560	5704200	That's right. Like my go to always.
5704200	5707640	That's right. I need, though, like another one that's going to be mine.
5707840	5710320	Like what's something that I sing a lot?
5710520	5714880	I did. So one of my friends dared to tell me that he disliked ABBA songs.
5714920	5718720	So just because of that, I did Knowing Me, Knowing You last time I was at karaoke.
5718920	5723680	It was fun. I think I would probably do, um.
5723880	5726040	Darted, so you guessed Love Shack.
5726240	5731800	That's a good guess, but that was more Miss Harper's thing than mine.
5732000	5736280	Like I just and Lisa Loeb and that one song that I fucking hate.
5736480	5739360	The Four Nomblons song.
5739560	5744280	So I was just really good at doing the what was the name, Fred.
5744440	5746600	That guy. Yeah,
5746800	5750640	Fred, that's a faded sign at the side of the road.
5750840	5753080	Maybe, maybe I know what I would do,
5753080	5755400	because I actually think that they have it at sidetracks.
5755600	5757640	I would do Sissy That Walk.
5757840	5759720	Oh, that's fun. Yeah.
5759920	5761680	Because I'll sing that one in the car.
5761880	5764600	This is the last call for anybody who wants to call in our show tonight.
5764600	5766200	You know, it'd be great is if there was
5766400	5771600	like an instrumental you and I could do, I look fucking cool.
5771800	5775480	That was a Dordellano and Alaska.
5775680	5776680	Yeah.
5776880	5781040	Once I remember doing a duet one time, I don't remember who it was with.
5781040	5782880	I don't believe it was Miss Harper.
5783080	5785560	It might have been Princess Irene years ago,
5785760	5791280	but I remember singing the love the elephant love medley from Moulin Rouge.
5791480	5796280	You know, love lifts us up where we belong, like the inner it intermixes all
5796480	5799320	those songs. So, yeah, that was a lot of fun to sing.
5799320	5801960	So I made a threat against my mom today.
5802160	5806200	I said this actually relates me back to songs of that era, though.
5806400	5809320	I was like, I'm going to make you a CD of things that I think you like,
5809320	5810960	but I'm going to put Captain and Tino on it.
5811160	5814600	And she's like, no, because muskrat love.
5814800	5816160	All right. Well, since nobody seems to be
5816160	5818280	calling in, do we want to try to squeeze in one more story?
5818280	5820160	Loki, I know we had some stuff we had to cut tonight.
5820200	5821880	Yeah, we could talk about how Detective
5821880	5825040	Pikachu is the highest grossing video game movie of all time now.
5825240	5826920	It's past Warcraft.
5827080	5829160	Oh, which is good because it's a great movie.
5829360	5830560	Yeah, it was fun. Yep.
5830760	5834880	So it's brought in a total of four hundred and thirty six million dollars
5835080	5839800	the last weekend and pushes past the previous record,
5840000	5842960	which is four hundred thirty three million dollars by Warcraft.
5843160	5845000	I realized Warcraft made that much money.
5845200	5846720	I liked Warcraft. I didn't hate it.
5846720	5848800	Yeah, I saw it together. Yeah, I didn't hate it.
5848800	5851800	Like with as much as, you know, you seem to get a lot of crap.
5851800	5854680	Like, you know, it had its issues, but I didn't think it was.
5854880	5856720	I wish they'd make another one, but they won't.
5856720	5860280	And I'll be out on DVD and Blu-ray on September 16th.
5860480	5862000	Oh, shoot. Detective Pikachu. Yeah.
5862200	5863480	Oh, good. Good.
5863680	5866240	So just a warning, like I would say a week
5866440	5870520	after that's out on DVD and Blu-ray is when I can talk about spoilers
5870720	5874040	because there's still something about that movie I've not been able to talk about.
5874040	5875880	But I'm trying to I'm trying to behave myself.
5875920	5877840	I still haven't seen so I'm warning you.
5877840	5881200	You got a couple I'll say a couple of weeks after that DVD comes out.
5881400	5883080	And then then I'm talking spoilers.
5883280	5885400	So. All right.
5886360	5887960	Anyhow.
5888160	5890040	All right. Well, I guess that's going to do it.
5890040	5892400	We're about 745. That's about as long as I want to go tonight.
5892400	5894080	So I think we're about the time to get
5894080	5896560	everybody's final thoughts and wrap up our show tonight.
5896720	5898600	Hey, if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Laundry,
5898600	5900320	you know, please tell a friend or two about our show.
5900320	5903920	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
5904120	5908520	But if the voices are not here to air, then we can't have them.
5908720	5910320	So please help us spread the word.
5910520	5913280	Auto hosts on Twitch go a long, long way.
5913280	5914080	So thank you. Thank you.
5914360	5918200	Those you guys to do that on Twitch with the hosting and all that.
5918400	5919240	Really appreciate it.
5919440	5923880	And also, I know we don't read them all when we're live, but I do see the subs
5923880	5926840	and the biddies and I know you get your recognition on the ticker bar and I'll
5927040	5930120	read them when we wrap up live only on Twitch.
5930320	5934600	But I just really just want to stress how much we here at VOG appreciate that,
5934800	5937320	especially because, you know, we were able to do flyers.
5937520	5939360	Thanks to the biddies and the subs.
5939560	5943360	We are hoping to do some new merchandise for Dragon Con.
5943560	5945320	We are looking at doing other stuff.
5945320	5946960	So it's just it's really, really exciting.
5947160	5950040	We were able to be a sponsor for Southern Pride Game Room.
5950240	5952200	Thanks to biddies and that that helped.
5952400	5954520	So, yeah, just want to say thank you.
5954520	5956120	Thank you. Thank you for all of that.
5956320	5958080	All right. Let's get final thoughts.
5958240	5959280	Loki, we'll start with you tonight.
5959280	5959840	Your final thought.
5960040	5963080	Final thought is I'm hoping to have some well,
5963280	5971120	I'm hoping to set up a local meet up for laser tag soon and I bought gear to.
5971280	5975640	To stream, well, not stream it, because I don't think I can do that with the gear
5975840	5981360	they have, but to record it, yeah, or camera it.
5982080	5986120	And my final thought would be, please send me your thoughts and prayers
5986320	5990080	that I don't get voted out tomorrow because it's not looking good tomorrow.
5990080	5991600	Tomorrow might be it, but we'll see.
5991800	5993800	Fingers, fingers crossed, toes crossed, too.
5994000	5997240	And last but not least, because it's me,
5997440	6002320	please remember to spay and neuter your neighbors and family members.
6002520	6003880	All right, that will do it.
6004080	6008080	Have a wonderful week until I get constipated.
6008280	6010440	Have a wonderful week, everybody. We'll see you next time.
