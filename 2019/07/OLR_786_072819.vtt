right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at twitch TV twitch.tv slash vog network and

01:39.760 --> 01:43.160
I'm saying that because I'm reading some comments from chat where stu 100 Matt

01:43.160 --> 01:47.540
says orange hair radio and Spyro Jonathan says heck yeah orange hair

01:47.540 --> 01:51.580
radio so did you dye your hair orange because you are that devoted to this

01:51.580 --> 01:58.740
show as if 17 years of your life wasn't enough bitch I might be I'm actually not

01:58.740 --> 02:02.300
gonna be bleaching my roots anymore because you know it's bad for your hair

02:02.300 --> 02:05.780
to over bleach I wouldn't know I don't I don't have hair anymore well so why do

02:05.780 --> 02:09.180
you think I wear hats those on the camera can see it's dark up here I'm

02:09.180 --> 02:14.020
gonna be going really red and growing out this orange part to wear when my

02:14.020 --> 02:18.420
hair's long it's gonna be like flame point I'm thinking ahead this is gonna

02:18.420 --> 02:23.460
be like a three-year endeavor it looks worse on cam that it really is like I

02:23.460 --> 02:26.260
sort it like it looks like it's just like completely bald on top but I do

02:26.260 --> 02:30.980
have some hair it looks worse on cam I think but not but bald is beautiful so

02:30.980 --> 02:34.540
I don't give a fuck so whatever it gives you an excuse to have interesting hats

02:34.540 --> 02:39.140
too yeah it is I'd like the hats are a good accessory why not you you ladies

02:39.140 --> 02:43.180
get to pick your purses that match well not that gender roles should define

02:43.180 --> 02:47.540
anything but the majority of you know American culture is that you pick a

02:47.540 --> 02:52.140
purse to go with your outfit why should I say queens yeah exactly right but if I

02:52.140 --> 02:55.500
wanted to pick take a purse then god damn it I'm gonna take a purse exactly

02:55.500 --> 02:59.660
all right bring back the murse all right anyway I had a murse we talked about

02:59.660 --> 03:04.140
that another time all right anyway hello I don't mean to ignore Loki techmaster

03:04.140 --> 03:07.900
Loki over there that's fine but you're equal number one I'm thinking you don't

03:07.900 --> 03:12.060
have a lot to contribute to the purse discussion no and I can clearly see

03:12.060 --> 03:15.740
you're over there catching Pokemon yes because apparently my house is a how hot

03:15.740 --> 03:21.260
bed of Pokemon no just because I haven't done it in a while and because I don't

03:21.260 --> 03:25.620
know yeah I'm out of the loop so you know to that guy that reviewed us on

03:25.620 --> 03:29.580
iTunes saying they talk about nothing but Pokemon go those days are numbered I

03:29.580 --> 03:33.860
haven't played some review I shouldn't even acknowledge the negative reviews

03:33.860 --> 03:37.540
but it is what it is yeah yeah but you can always leave a positive review if

03:37.540 --> 03:40.380
you want to offset that stuff for the record there's jack shit at your house

03:40.380 --> 03:49.460
what they had a thing where you get you hatched or you get a dratini and then

03:49.460 --> 03:52.580
you have to take a picture of it and then that picture got me one of those

03:52.580 --> 03:57.420
smear goal things and so I had to catch that oh I didn't do that I caught a

03:57.420 --> 04:00.140
dratini but I didn't take a picture of it yeah I've kind of fallen off the

04:00.140 --> 04:03.060
wagon on this quest like I guess today was the in here we are talking about

04:03.060 --> 04:11.020
anyway today was like that Team Rocket type of my game well they keep doing it

04:11.020 --> 04:14.300
on Sunday night well I can hit it though before when I leave the house to come

04:14.300 --> 04:17.740
here I can hit the pokestop by my house so here's the weird thing like so

04:17.740 --> 04:21.860
Pokemon go gave my phone a new background I don't know why like it

04:21.860 --> 04:25.980
changed my wallpaper did you tell it it could no it just did it like it crashed

04:25.980 --> 04:29.940
the wallpaper is it a cute Pikachu no it's just like it's just like some pink

04:29.980 --> 04:34.860
like looks like like a mountain range or something I had like weird it's supposed

04:34.860 --> 04:38.300
to be a simulation of earth with like the lighting and everything and the

04:38.300 --> 04:41.620
cloud cover is supposed to match with what the weather satellites are because

04:41.620 --> 04:47.340
that's kind of cool and now it's gone all right whatever background on y'all's

04:47.340 --> 04:50.700
phone I have a picture of mr. smoosh on my well you can't see it right now

04:50.700 --> 04:54.140
because I have apparently Twitter alerts that are in the way oh because that's a

04:54.140 --> 04:57.180
good thing because y'all are promoting the show tonight because I barely did

04:57.180 --> 04:59.860
but I have a picture of mr. smoosh is the background of my phone you guys

04:59.860 --> 05:01.980
probably can't even see it from that far away but that's what I have I try to

05:01.980 --> 05:07.700
take a picture of a dratini to see if that would count and it doesn't you can

05:07.700 --> 05:12.060
turn off the AR thing and and it's a lot easier to do pictures and so I wanted to

05:12.060 --> 05:17.020
take the AR because I did it on top of my macbook and it's got your knee in the

05:17.020 --> 05:21.740
picture oh my sexy knee I'm sure I'm I'm being a little bit of a that neither

05:21.740 --> 05:27.660
tonight by showing off my knees that knee uh-huh all right anyway it's hot

05:27.660 --> 05:31.140
today I can't how could I not wear shorts everybody's wearing shorts

05:31.140 --> 05:36.380
because it's 106 today here in lovely Sacramento where we're based the ambient

05:36.380 --> 05:44.260
temperature coming off of my car when I got in it was 115 Wow right well all

05:44.260 --> 05:47.980
right anyway let's let's talk about the weather more talk about games and dark

05:47.980 --> 05:51.900
soccer you braved the weather this weekend because you went on a road trip

05:51.900 --> 05:57.660
off to San Jose right I didn't brave the weather I left it but so tell us a was

05:57.660 --> 06:01.060
like it didn't get any hotter than like 88 you know that's that's typical Bay

06:01.060 --> 06:05.940
Area but anyway tell us about California extreme it was the thing I go to every

06:05.940 --> 06:10.940
year basically in a nutshell California extreme is a big gaming Expo where they

06:10.940 --> 06:15.900
have like a huge ballroom full of pinball classic games music games and

06:15.940 --> 06:20.980
they've got a big candy cab section now the Japanese style cabinets and then

06:20.980 --> 06:24.780
they have like a whole other room now that's just like a big meeting room

06:24.780 --> 06:29.060
that's also full of games and then they have a vendor room upstairs with a stage

06:29.060 --> 06:35.540
to do rock band kind of how allowed did their thing and then you know classic

06:35.540 --> 06:40.460
consoles also set up up there so it was really good it goes on for two days I

06:40.460 --> 06:44.120
forgot what time it opens I think it opens at like 9 or 10 but it goes to 2

06:44.160 --> 06:51.480
in the morning on Saturday and then Sunday all day and people you know bring

06:51.480 --> 06:56.760
their own machines some people sell them there Stern has a big presence and I

06:56.760 --> 07:03.720
twice ran into Steve Ritchie and he's like oh hi cuz you know we're Facebook

07:03.720 --> 07:09.680
buddies it's funny yeah and he was I was like let's get a picture together he's

07:09.680 --> 07:14.400
like I got to go take my pills I'm like okay Steve he's not a chicken of the

07:14.400 --> 07:18.240
spring anymore but he's he's just a good guy he and his wife are the nicest

07:18.240 --> 07:26.560
people you'll ever meet but they had all kinds of really good games which I could

07:26.560 --> 07:30.960
go ahead and do now and get my gaming week out of the way for everything I

07:30.960 --> 07:35.240
played yeah well I was hoping there might be stuff outside of for that but

07:35.240 --> 07:39.920
oh sorry well no I hardly played anything outside of California stream

07:39.920 --> 07:42.640
except for the usual we'll get into a little bit of what you what you played a

07:42.640 --> 07:46.900
California stream then okay so I played Black Knight Sword of Rage which was

07:46.900 --> 07:50.800
amazing as always and if you were ever gonna buy a Black Knight Sword of Rage

07:50.800 --> 07:55.520
get premium don't get the pro the premium that brand new table yeah maybe

07:55.520 --> 08:02.000
three months old they had the miss pac-man mini like the cabinet that's

08:02.000 --> 08:06.260
like like a two-thirds my height but there's like those arcade one-up

08:06.260 --> 08:09.880
machines yeah I think that's what they were interesting I didn't I'm surprised

08:09.880 --> 08:13.200
that those are kind of yeah those have an interesting place in this day and age

08:13.200 --> 08:16.600
right because like I would think in some ways those might be frowned on because

08:16.600 --> 08:21.240
they're not authentic miss pac-man's but they sure do give a fairly authentic

08:21.240 --> 08:23.920
experience with the screens the screens really a big difference like you can

08:23.920 --> 08:27.520
really notice the screens on those arcade one-ups are not the same thing

08:27.520 --> 08:34.480
you remember playing oh really and then they had an even smaller one that didn't

08:34.480 --> 08:37.960
look like it was in the same thing so it could have been custom but it was an

08:37.960 --> 08:43.000
ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 so that's some interesting ones ones there they didn't

08:43.000 --> 08:46.640
have any of like I mean those are almost like the junior size one but they didn't

08:46.640 --> 08:51.080
have the junior size Neo Geo you know I bet that arcade one-up company was

08:51.080 --> 08:54.760
probably like advertising there actually they probably had some type of deal to

08:54.760 --> 08:57.500
have their machines there because that is the perfect crowd to be selling the

08:57.500 --> 09:02.620
those things to you know classic arcade game fans with disposable income that is

09:02.620 --> 09:05.140
like that is their crowd so I wouldn't be surprised if those machines were

09:05.140 --> 09:10.900
there because like arcade one-up kind of wanted them there and they did have from

09:10.900 --> 09:17.360
what I could notice fewer of the pinball and arcade board vendors and more of the

09:17.360 --> 09:22.800
classic video game vendors although I tried to find Saturn and turbo graphic

09:22.800 --> 09:28.120
stuff and they were very sparse they still the place that I buy from tiny

09:28.120 --> 09:32.160
potato I really like those guys I hang you know hang out and chat with them

09:32.160 --> 09:38.280
every year but they have a copy of cotton for PlayStation that I would

09:38.280 --> 09:44.760
really like to buy but it's 90 bucks I keep waffling on it you know but I mean

09:44.760 --> 09:48.080
it was really a fun time all the vendors were really nice everyone was really

09:48.080 --> 09:51.680
friendly and chatty and one of the vendors watched me open a couple of

09:51.680 --> 09:55.520
blind boxes cuz he went in I said he's like can I predict him first I'm like

09:55.520 --> 09:59.240
sure so he shakes the two of them I grabbed like the dig dug blind set which

09:59.240 --> 10:01.960
you could get one of three characters so you know he had two out of three choice

10:01.960 --> 10:07.760
like this one is a puka and this one is the I always forget the name of the

10:07.760 --> 10:11.960
dragon the fry gar fry gar is like this one's a fry I wanted to say that's a

10:11.960 --> 10:16.680
video game cuz the game rygar yeah I was thinking rygar and I was like so he

10:16.680 --> 10:20.480
shook him is like this one's a fry gar this one's a puka so when I opened them

10:20.640 --> 10:24.560
one was a fry gar one was a puka I wouldn't have minded a dig-dug but I

10:24.560 --> 10:30.720
like having the baddies so they're cool and pukas are cute but at any rate I

10:30.720 --> 10:35.120
they really they were missing some stuff this year just some things that I

10:35.120 --> 10:39.140
expected to be there this year that were not there were lots of panels Steve

10:39.140 --> 10:47.960
Ritchie did a panel about developing Black Knight there was one about DJ max

10:48.280 --> 10:53.960
oh wow yeah 730 and I I didn't go to it cuz I was hanging out with melody but

10:53.960 --> 11:00.560
Mel went to it which by the way preview preview we may have Mel on yeah yeah I

11:00.560 --> 11:03.720
heard yeah he was thinking about is he gonna come up here we doing something

11:03.720 --> 11:08.200
awesome I would love to have love to have him back on the show talk about the

11:08.200 --> 11:16.600
have a DDR night infinity stage yeah that he's gonna be working with but you

11:16.600 --> 11:20.400
know there was a pretty decent music game section but they didn't I was

11:20.400 --> 11:23.320
looking for a couple of things they didn't have it although they did have

11:23.320 --> 11:28.240
that nostalgia game by Konami that looks kind of like a keyboard but not really a

11:28.240 --> 11:32.400
keyboard I think I know what you're talking about it's it's a newer game

11:32.400 --> 11:37.840
right yeah yeah I think Musica which I finally got to play it was fun they had

11:37.840 --> 11:43.360
my my do you know what my my is uh yeah circle that's got the button yeah

11:44.040 --> 11:51.240
pattern I played that and it had an oppa oppa song so I was very happy I'm not

11:51.240 --> 11:54.640
great at it you know it's just my first time playing it but I think I did okay

11:54.640 --> 12:03.360
so as they had a bunch of DJ max though they had some you beat they had a couple

12:03.360 --> 12:09.480
of the bishi bashi so that was pretty fun they had a real prop cycle another

12:09.480 --> 12:14.320
prop cycle Adams family they did had an Adams family though but you know there

12:14.320 --> 12:19.360
was there were certain the blastroids that used to belong to us was there so

12:19.360 --> 12:22.560
it was pretty funny dance like I'm gonna go see our blastroids but anyway so what

12:22.560 --> 12:26.560
I played there was I played Black Knight Sword of Rage I played the Miss Pac-man

12:26.560 --> 12:31.120
mini I played Pac-man and chomp chomp which is a very weird little more recent

12:31.120 --> 12:37.560
Pac-man game JJ squawkers which thought I played Sonic the fighters I played

12:37.560 --> 12:43.160
azumanga daioh puzzle bobble so it's basically puzzle bobble with the girls

12:43.160 --> 12:47.800
from azumanga daioh in it so easy peasy I played my my I played virtual on

12:47.800 --> 12:51.960
oratorio tangram which was really fun they were in the Japanese cabinets and

12:51.960 --> 12:55.500
they were back-to-back and I was just trying to play through you know the

12:55.500 --> 12:59.520
story mode and this one person just keeps challenging challenging chill I'm

12:59.520 --> 13:03.360
like I was just so stubborn I was like I just want to beat you and be done and

13:03.360 --> 13:06.720
you kept doing over and over and like six games and I'm like okay I'm done and

13:06.720 --> 13:10.600
I just let him win you know I just ran in with the sword and it's like if you

13:10.600 --> 13:15.720
can beat me at close range then you win and so I walked around and just poked

13:15.720 --> 13:20.240
him on the shoulder I was like good game dude and he's like it's a girl you know

13:20.240 --> 13:26.940
like the total it's a girl look like a girl speaks to me pretty much like the

13:26.940 --> 13:31.120
ending of Metroid for the very first time yeah but I played Dodon Pachi I

13:31.120 --> 13:34.800
played Big Bang bar so they had a Big Bang bar but it was I think it was a

13:34.800 --> 13:41.200
repro because the glass on it they played Musica I played some regular old

13:41.200 --> 13:43.680
pac-man but it wasn't one of those I forgot what they're called like the

13:43.680 --> 13:49.180
marquee cabinets the the narrower ones with a smaller screen yeah I know what

13:49.180 --> 13:51.240
you're talking about but I don't know the name call them something and I

13:51.240 --> 13:55.920
remember did if you bring up pac-man did they have my all-time fave baby pac-man

13:55.920 --> 13:59.360
I didn't see baby pac-man I would have played the shit out of it I saying for

13:59.360 --> 14:02.840
those of you that go Google baby pac-man if you don't know it cuz baby pac-man

14:02.840 --> 14:05.920
the reason why I love that game so much I remembered as a kid it is half like

14:05.920 --> 14:10.040
pac-man arcade game but then there's a point where when you go out the tunnels

14:10.040 --> 14:13.960
you don't like warp to yet well you do when you go out the side when you go

14:13.960 --> 14:17.160
there's tunnels in the bottom and when you go out the bottom tunnels you drop

14:17.160 --> 14:22.320
into a pinball board and so it's half pac-man half pinball and it's so cool I

14:22.320 --> 14:24.880
didn't play journey either because apparently the joystick was a little

14:24.880 --> 14:31.800
messed up but I also played you know crazy auto which was a kind of backwards

14:31.840 --> 14:41.400
retheme of miss pac-man because miss pac-man started life as a pac-man like

14:41.400 --> 14:45.040
expansion yeah I was like a pac-man plus and they were gonna release it under the

14:45.040 --> 14:48.920
name crazy auto with a walking character and everything and then you know Namco

14:48.920 --> 14:54.120
and shit happened and miss pac-man I also played a Beatlemania pinball and I

14:54.120 --> 14:59.240
played the Sega Tetris that's got the big fat blocks like you only have like

14:59.240 --> 15:05.000
ten block spaces to work with it's kind of hard but it was really fun I really

15:05.000 --> 15:10.160
enjoyed it and there was also you know there was a few others a bunch of cave

15:10.160 --> 15:18.240
shooters like mushihime sama and and what was battle garega

15:18.440 --> 15:22.520
what else did I play no it was do don pachi that I played because I love that

15:22.520 --> 15:27.640
game but yeah they just had all kinds of neat stuff I mean there were there were

15:27.640 --> 15:32.240
a bunch of you know the street fighter ones like starting from third impact all

15:32.240 --> 15:37.560
the way up through five they had an arcade machine for five and they had

15:37.560 --> 15:43.000
multi blood you know just all kinds of neat import games over in that area so

15:43.000 --> 15:46.720
it was it was really neat you know just a fun time and hanging out with my

15:46.720 --> 15:54.400
friends and you know ran into Bradley like you do and I played with the

15:54.400 --> 15:58.160
toddler what kind of like vendors were there cuz aren't there usually like

15:58.160 --> 16:01.040
around the edges of the rooms there's like some vendors selling like classic

16:01.040 --> 16:04.560
arcade things like what did you see there was like one DIY vendor outside

16:04.560 --> 16:08.120
doing like etched glass and there was another one inside also doing etched

16:08.120 --> 16:14.840
glass like for mugs and shot pint glasses and shot glasses and then you

16:14.840 --> 16:18.520
know I said there weren't so many we pinball part vendors like there were in

16:18.520 --> 16:23.140
previous years Marco pinball of course is one of the sponsors with Stern for

16:23.140 --> 16:28.860
bringing in a lot of the because they have it that big stern section that had

16:28.860 --> 16:32.900
like Black Knight Deadpool all of that and so they were selling parts and stuff

16:32.900 --> 16:38.180
from Marco there was the shirt vendors for California extreme there were just a

16:38.180 --> 16:43.900
lot of like kitschy knick-knack II stuff for for the video game merch like the

16:43.900 --> 16:49.300
blind boxes and Mario mugs and there was a doormat that I wanted one that says

16:49.300 --> 16:53.100
welcome to Peach's castle it was kind of cute and they had like throws and

16:53.100 --> 16:57.820
everything like blankets and this is nothing super exciting maybe you know if

16:57.820 --> 17:03.240
I was trying to decorate my teenage bedroom that might be something or if

17:03.240 --> 17:07.940
you know we start getting into decorating the game room or something it

17:07.940 --> 17:12.500
was it was all nice stuff you know I got my two little things to put on my desk

17:12.500 --> 17:19.500
at work and I got patches actually I got an Atari patch I got a mass link shield

17:19.500 --> 17:27.340
the Hyrule shield patch and I got a a super mushroom because I'm gonna make a

17:27.340 --> 17:32.100
patch jacket so fun you need to get some of those old-school Activision

17:32.100 --> 17:36.220
achievement patches for your jacket I'll see I would love that I would look so

17:36.220 --> 17:39.100
many issues reprose there's got to be reprose of that I would love to get an

17:39.100 --> 17:41.820
awesome jacket with like all the Activision badges I think that would be

17:41.820 --> 17:44.860
cool yeah that's got to be like an Etsy or something one of those things I wish

17:44.860 --> 17:49.300
Activision themselves would do it though you know because they as much love or

17:49.340 --> 17:53.260
hate Activision in their current state today for those of us that were you know

17:53.260 --> 17:57.620
cool kid Atari 2600 folks like you know it would be it would be nice to you know

17:57.620 --> 18:01.580
get our get our hands on some of that type of merch right oh so I did buy a

18:01.580 --> 18:06.700
few things though oh yeah I bought the compact old-school Game Boy case it's

18:06.700 --> 18:13.100
this well they can on the podcast anyway so anyway it's it's actually honestly

18:13.100 --> 18:17.660
about the length of this microphone okay and it has enough space for they can see

18:17.660 --> 18:22.700
mine it has enough room in it for a Game Boy on one side and then maybe like

18:22.700 --> 18:26.540
four games total on the other I think I used to have one of those cases it's a

18:26.540 --> 18:30.020
hard case and I was like I don't have a Game Boy to put in it we don't have an

18:30.020 --> 18:34.260
old-school Game Boy anymore but I could make like a purse or something out of it

18:34.260 --> 18:39.300
it'd be fun or you know like a first aid kit yeah you know I thought it would be

18:39.300 --> 18:43.740
neat I only paid five bucks for it and then I got the Game Gear magnifier I

18:43.980 --> 18:48.420
mean he wanted eight bucks for it but I actually got the two items together for

18:48.420 --> 18:51.660
ten bucks you know cuz you haggle you haggle when you go to the classic gaming

18:51.660 --> 18:59.540
table and then I got a game called air adventures for Saturn that I never

18:59.540 --> 19:03.580
played but like they this one guy traded it in with a stack of other games and

19:03.580 --> 19:07.380
when the fellow was looking it up it's like it was only worth the dollar I was

19:07.380 --> 19:11.860
like I'll give you two bucks for it okay so I took it sight unseen two bucks

19:11.900 --> 19:16.300
because it's another Saturn game and I thought it'd be fun to try something new

19:16.300 --> 19:23.380
you know that hadn't played before and yeah I didn't really do like a whole

19:23.380 --> 19:26.740
bunch of shopping in it my knee t-shirts you know but they had some fun little

19:26.740 --> 19:32.140
stuff and I love blind boxes so I now have my poop puka and fry car you need

19:32.140 --> 19:36.020
to you start a YouTube channel opening blind boxes do you know like how popular

19:36.020 --> 19:39.900
those types of videos are yeah but these aren't it these are different than like

19:39.980 --> 19:45.900
those little blind boxes the gift blind boxes it's people like order like the

19:45.900 --> 19:52.300
Amazon returns or the blind boxes on Etsy or not Etsy but eBay you know those

19:52.300 --> 19:56.620
are the ones that get money or the people who buy the storage units I know

19:56.620 --> 19:59.220
let me ask you one more thing about California stream and then we'll get on

19:59.220 --> 20:02.220
into the rest of our gaming weeks the type of stuff we've been playing but you

20:02.220 --> 20:05.220
know you've been going to the convention for several years now what was your

20:05.220 --> 20:09.340
favorite thing about the convention this year and well let's start there what was

20:09.340 --> 20:15.180
your favorite thing about the convention this year um I don't know

20:15.180 --> 20:20.980
just I guess more seeing my friends the people yeah that's fair that they

20:20.980 --> 20:23.700
hanging out with nerds hanging out with nerds heck yeah that's one of my

20:23.700 --> 20:27.780
favorite actually Dragon Con mag fest any kind of into the two things that I

20:27.780 --> 20:32.060
heard the most that made me happy was one I like your hair and number two I

20:32.060 --> 20:36.460
like your shirt I was wearing my crazy red shirt for Animal Crossing that says

20:36.460 --> 20:40.580
seems legit oh I was gonna wear my chica shirt and I was like you know I'm

20:40.580 --> 20:42.860
gonna wear crazy red it's a little a little bit bigger it's a little more

20:42.860 --> 20:46.580
comfortable and everyone's like oh my god you're sure let me take let me take

20:46.580 --> 20:51.380
a picture of your shirt okay and then I think probably the obvious follow-up to

20:51.380 --> 20:54.340
that would be what would be one thing that you would want to see them do next

20:54.340 --> 21:02.020
year that they haven't done yet I want or they're not doing I would like a

21:02.020 --> 21:08.820
whole room of nothing but I'd like them to put the candy cabs and the Bahmani

21:08.820 --> 21:14.500
the music games in their own room that sounds like a get you go you'd like so

21:14.500 --> 21:17.780
much noise pollution though and that but I guess I guess if you set up barriers

21:17.780 --> 21:20.460
the right way if you kind of thought it through there'd probably be a way to

21:20.460 --> 21:23.420
make it a little more tolerable and the other there's actually one other thing

21:23.420 --> 21:30.340
because I was when I was talking to tiny potato guys there they said that they

21:30.340 --> 21:34.660
weren't given any lighting where they were so people couldn't they had to go

21:34.660 --> 21:38.260
to Target and buy lamps and I was like you really need to take better care of

21:38.260 --> 21:42.740
your vendors you know don't put people in dark little corners with no lighting

21:42.740 --> 21:46.820
that's not fair to them if you were gonna have the vendors be in a place

21:46.820 --> 21:49.740
other than where they usually are you need to make sure you have sufficient

21:49.740 --> 21:53.820
lighting so that people can see those items and they're not wasting money

21:53.820 --> 21:57.060
renting the space okay that's good feedback I think that's exactly the type

21:57.060 --> 21:59.380
of thing I think would be good for them to hear but I think that next year

21:59.460 --> 22:03.700
though I actually want to officially try to go as press next year I want to go

22:03.700 --> 22:08.020
period because I've missed it so many years in a row but this is also you know

22:08.020 --> 22:11.660
in generally like personally this is also a hard weekend so it's like you

22:11.660 --> 22:15.940
know it's just just a bad time of year for it you know yeah but I'm gonna put

22:15.940 --> 22:19.860
in for press next year you should so that we can go in and interview people

22:19.860 --> 22:23.860
and do panels good panels yeah I get some of the get some of them for some

22:23.860 --> 22:26.740
some break segments get some interviews that'd be awesome maybe we should even

22:26.940 --> 22:32.100
like petition to do a panel you never know I mean at this point we would be a

22:32.100 --> 22:38.940
classic podcast don't you think classic podcast they have games from 2002 in

22:38.940 --> 22:45.100
there that are classic games I think there was there was also another game in

22:45.100 --> 22:49.900
there I forgot the name of it but it was like the super field goal football

22:49.900 --> 22:54.660
baseball mixture game it was kind of weird yeah Bobby and Chad is saying I'd

22:54.660 --> 22:57.620
love to go to probably won't be able to swing it yeah I think him and I are in

22:57.620 --> 23:01.220
similar predicaments as to why he can't come out here for California extreme and

23:01.220 --> 23:04.420
why I can't go out there for the southern fried gaming expo which is

23:04.420 --> 23:09.180
really it's really their equivalent is what that that show is so yeah but I

23:09.180 --> 23:14.420
mean it's really it's really fun you know I had a great time like like I

23:14.420 --> 23:17.780
said earlier I was toddler tired when I was done because I didn't want to stop

23:17.780 --> 23:24.980
playing but I was tired was it that super slam-dunk yeah yeah we had that

23:24.980 --> 23:28.380
guy on the show a long time because they were at gamer X yeah second or third

23:28.380 --> 23:33.140
year yeah we had them remembered it but everyone in dance pinball group was like

23:33.140 --> 23:37.140
oh it's so much fun yeah it's a fun game they had a killer be there it's been out

23:37.140 --> 23:43.500
a while now that a killer be a killer Queen that was it which I still haven't

23:43.500 --> 23:47.700
played that game but everyone says it's really fun so Bobby and Chad says yeah

23:47.700 --> 23:51.460
the toddler tired thing is why I got a hotel room at southern fried so I didn't

23:51.460 --> 23:54.260
have to drive home at night and yeah I think that's why I like a lot of people

23:54.260 --> 23:57.900
like kind of even if the convention is like right by you you know a lot of

23:57.900 --> 24:01.220
people if they have the income I mean certainly you know how much money you do

24:01.220 --> 24:04.020
or don't have and are able to spend on that type of stuff plays a factor but if

24:04.020 --> 24:06.380
you're fortunate enough to be able to swing it like I think a lot of people

24:06.380 --> 24:10.740
are just like I'm just gonna plan to stay on site they're doing a big ingress

24:10.740 --> 24:14.980
thing in downtown Sacramento on October 12th I'm considering getting a hotel

24:14.980 --> 24:17.980
room in downtown Sacramento because of the whole toddler tired thing yeah I

24:17.980 --> 24:23.940
need to get in on that information yeah you do you do come join us anyway all

24:23.940 --> 24:26.900
right let's talk about the rest of our gaming weeks outside of the convention

24:26.900 --> 24:29.540
of California extreme which I really do hope to attend next year and

24:29.540 --> 24:33.020
congratulate those guys on their success because everybody I talked to that goes

24:33.020 --> 24:37.460
loves it and I just it's just it's always like a bad like timing conflict I

24:37.460 --> 24:41.140
think one year speaking of gamer X and the the game there I think one year it

24:41.140 --> 24:43.980
was the same weekend as gamer X and that was an issue I think it was the year

24:43.980 --> 24:47.700
gamer X was up in San Francisco tell me stream was like the same weekend I seem

24:47.700 --> 24:52.100
to remember that was the thing that happened yeah yeah anyway um did you

24:52.100 --> 24:54.700
want to add anything else to your gaming week our soccer outside of the

24:54.700 --> 24:59.700
convention the usual phone games mm-hmm so that's it yeah and Pokemon go first

24:59.700 --> 25:04.780
my phone today no it needs to stop doing that probably so many people getting in

25:04.780 --> 25:08.800
on that event I guess which sadly I've just lost track of Loki how about you

25:08.800 --> 25:13.700
how was your gaming week I didn't play a lot of games this week I played just a

25:13.700 --> 25:17.940
little bit Pokemon go okay but you did something video game adjacent I know

25:17.940 --> 25:23.540
because you invited me and I couldn't go so I played more laser tag again

25:23.540 --> 25:28.520
actually so I went last night I tried to get a meetup group of people to go play

25:28.520 --> 25:31.700
some laser tag I did have one of my friends show up with his kids so we

25:31.700 --> 25:36.040
played for a little bit and that was kind of fun so he played that for a

25:36.040 --> 25:42.160
while at the local place here then today I went to a not quite local place a

25:42.280 --> 25:46.800
little further away to try out their arena and system stuff to see if it's

25:46.800 --> 25:51.200
something I would like I was hesitant to go there because it's twice as much it's

25:51.200 --> 25:57.520
very far away and I don't know I just had kind of a bad feeling about it and

25:57.520 --> 26:03.600
when we got there and played it it was kind of jank a little bit the arena is

26:03.600 --> 26:08.000
nice and I like how some of the features that they have are kind of remind me of

26:08.240 --> 26:14.880
cues are but it's the guns themselves were really tiny and they force you to

26:14.880 --> 26:19.400
push like two buttons on the side in order for you to actually be able to

26:19.400 --> 26:23.600
fire the gun so you have to hold the two buttons on the side because they always

26:23.600 --> 26:27.560
want to make sure they using two hands whereas the place I play over here they

26:27.560 --> 26:30.880
have an optical sensor so you put your hand on the bottom and it detects it's

26:30.880 --> 26:34.440
there you don't have to hold some stupid buttons so forcing to hold those tiny

26:34.440 --> 26:38.600
buttons actually cramps the hell out of your hand and doing that even for just

26:38.600 --> 26:44.280
20 minutes I was like fuck this place I'm not coming back here but I do want

26:44.280 --> 26:48.640
to check out all the places in the area so I played most of them now but then

26:48.640 --> 26:53.440
ended up driving back over here playing a couple games so it's fun I keep

26:53.440 --> 26:57.440
playing in it and I tried to actually have some footage shot I got one of those

26:57.440 --> 27:01.120
action cameras I just don't have the right settings on it right now so it

27:01.120 --> 27:06.040
came out really grainy and dark because I have to adjust some of the settings on

27:06.040 --> 27:10.560
the camera which is unfortunate because I had some pretty good games there but

27:10.560 --> 27:15.280
it's hard to see what's going on and I had it mounted to my head instead of

27:15.280 --> 27:20.200
like on my shoulder or something like that and it's just really hard to see

27:20.200 --> 27:25.040
kind of what I was doing you kind of miss a lot of it so I'm gonna try it

27:25.040 --> 27:28.360
again at some point I may actually pick up another camera to try to maybe mount

27:28.400 --> 27:32.200
one to a gun mount one to my shoulder or something to get some footage because I

27:32.200 --> 27:38.560
think that'd be really cool but yeah so I've been playing lots of laser tag so

27:38.560 --> 27:42.960
I used to play a lot of laser tag way back in the day and it definitely still

27:42.960 --> 27:45.560
shows I like that you're having like your midlife crisis where you're

27:45.560 --> 27:49.440
rediscovering it all over again it's not that I have never like not like I know

27:49.440 --> 27:53.600
wanted to if like if a Q's are were to open up tomorrow yeah I'd be playing

27:53.600 --> 27:56.640
there all the time well you're going to this new place a lot which is pretty

27:57.480 --> 28:02.760
cool and it's see it's like I'm so torn because that place like it has a decent

28:02.760 --> 28:09.160
arena it has decent gear but the people that run it are just not great they

28:09.160 --> 28:14.280
they're just like it's you can tell that they're minimum wage kids that just

28:14.280 --> 28:18.400
don't care about being there and I get it you know it's a job I worked the job

28:18.400 --> 28:23.280
at a laser tech place before so I understand what it's like but like they

28:23.280 --> 28:26.600
don't know anything that's going on there like they have stuff that they

28:26.600 --> 28:29.640
advertise the website like about like a membership that you can do so you get a

28:29.640 --> 28:32.960
membership you give your own like call sign or whatever and you can scan it a

28:32.960 --> 28:37.120
card on the mission on the actual gun and it'll pop up like your name instead

28:37.120 --> 28:40.360
of the names that are on the guns normally and then also you like

28:40.360 --> 28:44.840
accumulate points towards something that happens like I think you select like

28:44.840 --> 28:48.360
exclusive weapons and stuff like that which is kind of cool so I thought oh

28:48.360 --> 28:51.120
yeah I'll do that for myself and my kids because we've been playing here for a

28:51.120 --> 28:55.600
few times and I go and ask them today about it because it is is literally one

28:55.600 --> 28:58.680
of the tabs that's on their website is membership it says ask us when you come

28:58.680 --> 29:02.640
in I'm like okay hey what about that membership thing how do I get and you

29:02.640 --> 29:06.560
sign up on that they're like I don't know what you're talking about like okay

29:06.560 --> 29:11.400
and in like the last week when we went to like we did they're like three hour

29:11.400 --> 29:14.480
thing where they're supposed to have pizza they're like pizza didn't arrive

29:14.480 --> 29:17.840
on time and they're like well we don't know where it is you can tell it's just

29:17.840 --> 29:21.040
not very professional with the kids right but like I met the owner last

29:21.040 --> 29:25.000
night and you know he obviously knows what's going on he has another arena in

29:25.000 --> 29:29.920
San Francisco as well and he commutes up here to run it sometimes but like he was

29:29.920 --> 29:37.160
dead it was dead on a Saturday night and that's not a good sign it's not a good

29:37.160 --> 29:41.160
sign they don't have anything in their lobby like it's just empty they have

29:41.160 --> 29:45.400
some ticket redemption games and like even today like when we were leaving

29:45.640 --> 29:48.800
there was I don't know what it was it looked like a rehab group or something

29:48.800 --> 29:52.320
like that but a bunch of old dudes and looks like some other people with like

29:52.320 --> 29:56.600
uniforms on that like we're taking him in a van back somewhere I don't know but

29:56.600 --> 30:01.160
okay I assumed it was like drug rehab or something like that and so they were

30:01.160 --> 30:05.080
taking him back and they gave us like a big thing a big stack of tickets so here

30:05.080 --> 30:09.120
you go you know your kids can get some of the prizes here and he had like

30:09.120 --> 30:14.280
shitty-ass it's all like even like even all the tickets this is just shit it's

30:14.320 --> 30:17.880
this absolute shit let me get some chat comments over at twitch.tv slash vogue

30:17.880 --> 30:23.040
Network VG realness says if laser tag is dead on a Saturday night it won't be

30:23.040 --> 30:27.600
around much longer yeah and I know and it's it's really comes down to location

30:27.600 --> 30:31.960
and advertising I've been to places I know it's in a business park which is a

30:31.960 --> 30:35.600
it's it's it's a business park but you can see it from the road so that's good

30:35.600 --> 30:39.280
at least but I've been to another laser tag place that was also in a business

30:39.280 --> 30:42.960
park and it just didn't last because nobody knows where it is and so look for

30:42.960 --> 30:46.320
and there's no advertising they don't have much of a social media presence

30:46.320 --> 30:51.120
there's no advertising whereas the other place I went to today definitely you

30:51.120 --> 30:55.040
know a lot more popular lots of people there but they have they have their way

30:55.040 --> 31:01.080
expensive they have more of an arcade they have like some bounce house shit

31:01.080 --> 31:06.240
that's there that really I wouldn't pay any money for that and they have their

31:06.240 --> 31:09.960
only cafe so they're definitely set up to kind of run a little bit better of an

31:09.960 --> 31:15.080
operation but this place it's it's struggling and what they talk about like

31:15.080 --> 31:18.560
let me get let me get some other comment sorry I asked you 100 mats is giving you

31:18.560 --> 31:21.920
photo advice saying the camera will give you a lot of grainy footage in low light

31:21.920 --> 31:25.940
but yeah if you mess with the aperture or shutter speed and the video noise it

31:25.940 --> 31:28.720
will look better obviously more light would fix it but you can't really do

31:28.720 --> 31:31.580
that in the laser tag arena yeah at night vision will look good but the

31:31.580 --> 31:35.000
strobe lights mess it up Bobby is talking about the business park thing

31:35.000 --> 31:38.240
saying most escape rooms are in a business park and they do fine around

31:38.400 --> 31:41.600
here last night we just do one last night and it's way far back in a

31:41.600 --> 31:45.040
business park and it was pretty hopping yeah those escape rooms everyone that

31:45.040 --> 31:48.640
I've been to is in like a business park too but they advertise they get out

31:48.640 --> 31:53.040
there they do stuff online and like they really they could utilize like print

31:53.040 --> 31:56.200
advertising I think would really help them like a mailer or something like

31:56.200 --> 31:59.120
that so people know they're there only reason I found them is because I was

31:59.120 --> 32:02.120
searching for laser tech places in the area like I wonder you know where

32:02.120 --> 32:06.500
haven't I been yet and I was like oh this one's I didn't even know this was

32:06.500 --> 32:10.380
here you know and so I found it that way it ended up being pretty decent it's

32:10.380 --> 32:13.980
just they need them they need to get in touch with an arcade vendor to put some

32:13.980 --> 32:17.500
arcade games in that damn thing because they're pushing like on their birthday

32:17.500 --> 32:20.740
packages oh yeah you can get like additional tokens and stuff like that

32:20.740 --> 32:25.520
but to play what there's like literally nothing there like I I'm gonna at some

32:25.520 --> 32:29.100
point film some stuff and like put it up I thought about like reviewing laser tag

32:29.100 --> 32:32.640
places I thought that'd be kind of fun at some point so as soon as I get a

32:32.640 --> 32:36.680
camera set up to do that because only we had a camera in our pockets that goes

32:36.680 --> 32:41.120
with us everywhere we go well you know I do but like I'm talking about my action

32:41.120 --> 32:46.000
project of it yeah so I do want to do that because if you it would be fun to

32:46.000 --> 32:50.840
go out you know review a bunch of places and stuff just from a perspective of

32:50.840 --> 32:56.200
someone that played a lot of laser tag and so yeah I'm having a lot of fun with

32:56.200 --> 32:59.160
it I just wish I wish there's more people there because really on a

32:59.160 --> 33:03.040
Saturday night there should be quite a few people or even like during the day

33:03.040 --> 33:07.360
like when we went there last week there was birthday parties going through and

33:07.360 --> 33:11.920
it was pretty good but like this week there there's no one there you know and

33:11.920 --> 33:15.480
Kai's you know had made a funny comment earlier to saying you can play laser tag

33:15.480 --> 33:20.760
in your house in VR on psvr rec room and VR laser tag is a good plan B when the

33:20.760 --> 33:24.840
places are not popping true but it's just not the same thing it's like it's

33:24.840 --> 33:28.880
like saying you know you can play a football game on your you know Xbox or

33:28.880 --> 33:33.880
you can go play football for real it is and and I like you know I like the games

33:33.880 --> 33:37.240
where it actually feels like their skill involved in it like the first one I play

33:37.240 --> 33:42.120
the reason I was not really attracted to that game at all is because like I can

33:42.120 --> 33:46.040
tell I can hit I'm a pretty good shot with hitting people in games I used to

33:46.040 --> 33:49.320
bounce shots off walls and stuff like that and do all sorts of crazy shit

33:49.320 --> 33:53.480
because I believe you know I've played several thousand games of laser tag and

33:53.480 --> 33:59.400
I you know the place I play now it's just you know I can hit people just as

33:59.400 --> 34:04.160
well as I could before and cues are this other place we went to today those guns

34:04.160 --> 34:08.800
I swear to God fucking suck like I could not hit shit with those guns and

34:08.800 --> 34:13.720
it's definitely the guns because like you're aiming straight on the person's

34:13.720 --> 34:18.200
just like standing there and you just can't hit anything with it and it's just

34:18.200 --> 34:21.320
the equipment it really sucks because it's good for like if you just have a

34:21.320 --> 34:24.400
bunch of kids running around they don't give a shit you know then that's fine

34:24.400 --> 34:28.280
but like for someone that actually wants to play it you know and actually get

34:28.280 --> 34:32.360
good at it and play it with people that want to play competitively you can't

34:32.360 --> 34:35.360
when it's just like it's fucking random that your shit's gonna work or not so

34:35.360 --> 34:38.900
anyways that's enough talking about that that's fine moving on to my gaming week

34:38.900 --> 34:42.400
so as you guys know after last week's show was a shorter show because I went

34:42.400 --> 34:46.960
to Chicago on business for the week so I was out of town Monday through Friday

34:46.960 --> 34:52.360
so that really kind of put a cramp or in my ability to do gaming but I did

34:52.360 --> 34:57.560
play a shit ton of Mario maker 2 on the flight and you might wonder how do you

34:57.560 --> 35:00.480
play Mario maker 2 and your RNA have played easy I was playing the single

35:00.480 --> 35:03.040
player campaign pretty much the whole way I was yeah I mean I'm sure there's a

35:03.040 --> 35:05.840
lot to play there yeah there is and I'm probably I'm still only probably about

35:05.840 --> 35:10.360
like 50% of the way through because I'm very stubborn and I refuse to use the

35:10.360 --> 35:15.040
tools that will help you get through like if like if you die twice then the

35:15.040 --> 35:18.840
little Luigi bag comes up and says do you need help dummy like it doesn't say

35:18.840 --> 35:21.720
it that way but that's kind of like fuck you Luigi I don't need your fucking help

35:21.720 --> 35:25.800
so and as you know and I realize some people probably take full-on advantage

35:25.800 --> 35:29.020
of it right away and that's fine play games how you want to play games but I'm

35:29.020 --> 35:31.760
like no I'm gonna be a little more stubborn I really want to see because

35:31.760 --> 35:34.960
you know I feel like I make progress every time yeah and there were some like

35:34.960 --> 35:37.880
it's not just like you get this assortment of levels but then if you

35:37.880 --> 35:42.000
kind of like explore around the castle there's like this dog that offers you

35:42.000 --> 35:45.280
levels underdog or whatever offers you levels too and his levels can be really

35:45.280 --> 35:48.560
hard so I feel like in some of those levels I like make a little bit of

35:48.560 --> 35:51.920
progression every time so you know if I have four hours to kill on a flight I'm

35:51.920 --> 35:54.800
fine with you know trying to make a little bit I wish they have like you

35:54.800 --> 35:59.600
know advanced tutorials in those games it's a new dog all of the likes you

35:59.600 --> 36:02.920
know advanced techniques like the shell jumps and stuff like that that you see

36:02.920 --> 36:08.080
like speed runners and like kaizo runners dudes like yeah say how do I get

36:08.080 --> 36:11.640
good at that stuff or let's not even let's let's step back let's not even go

36:11.640 --> 36:16.880
to good how do I do that I would say I'm like half only halfway through the

36:16.880 --> 36:20.520
campaign and I think I've had to play like 25 levels and then some to you know

36:20.520 --> 36:25.520
so there's a lot of levels in there to play so yeah I was I was plenty fine

36:25.520 --> 36:28.000
entertained with Mario maker 2 and single-player modes that was pretty much

36:28.000 --> 36:33.240
like my flight I did I watched a movie as well but then on the way back the

36:33.240 --> 36:37.520
frickin like the headphone jack and the little TV didn't work so I was gonna

36:37.520 --> 36:40.280
watch another movie but it couldn't I couldn't do anything so I was like I

36:40.280 --> 36:43.320
just played that and then I played bejeweled on this because that you know

36:43.320 --> 36:47.120
how the airplane things seat backs have games on them I don't know I just played

36:47.120 --> 36:52.400
bejeweled on the on the airplane so there was that because there's so few

36:52.400 --> 36:55.240
cell phone games that'll work when it has to be an airplane mode you know so

36:55.240 --> 36:59.800
so that put a cramp in my gaming week except of the survivor LARP I'm sure

36:59.800 --> 37:02.880
you're all ready for updates on that right because I was able to play that

37:02.880 --> 37:07.000
and that was very intense a lot's been going on so remember my game started

37:07.000 --> 37:12.360
with 22 people so the 10th place person was just voted out tonight there's nine

37:12.360 --> 37:17.440
people left and I'm one of them and they announced tonight that we are all the

37:17.440 --> 37:22.760
finalists and the jury so there's so I've at least made the jury so for those

37:22.760 --> 37:26.920
of you that watch or follow survivor you know that like that's a big like

37:26.920 --> 37:31.520
accomplishment you're in every episode at that point that's yay so that's

37:31.520 --> 37:34.400
that's kind of that's kind of good I mean obviously I can't again I don't

37:34.400 --> 37:37.760
know who's watching so I can't talk a lot about the strategical stuff all I

37:37.760 --> 37:45.600
can say was that today was like a big day so yeah it was a lot going on so you

37:45.600 --> 37:48.200
know it's getting more and more intense do you want to see what we had to do

37:48.200 --> 37:51.280
for the last immunity challenge our first individual immunity challenge

37:51.280 --> 37:54.020
would you all like to see it sure last week you guys got to hear about the

37:54.020 --> 37:57.360
talking thing right yes now I'm gonna show you a physical one so because this

37:57.360 --> 38:00.400
is a physical one for the sake of the podcasters could you guys narrate what

38:00.400 --> 38:08.480
I'm doing please yes okay all right so it's cup stacking you're doing cup

38:08.480 --> 38:16.440
stacking okay stacking cups so he's gotten small end with the big end on top

38:16.440 --> 38:21.440
and then big end so it looks like an hourglass and then he's taking it and

38:21.440 --> 38:29.880
flipping it over sideways holding it together so he's holding it that way

38:29.920 --> 38:38.440
how long did you hold it yeah without using glue it's it's it looks

38:38.440 --> 38:42.000
deceptively easy doesn't it because the first time I know that's right they

38:42.000 --> 38:45.760
explained it to us I practiced it and I was like this is much easier than the

38:45.760 --> 38:50.000
last cup stacking thing we had to do this is fine but you know it's about the

38:50.000 --> 38:54.640
small so I went for about 15 minutes and my understanding is the person who won

38:54.640 --> 39:00.640
immunity went for about 28 minutes and basically what happens is that as you're

39:00.640 --> 39:03.400
kind of holding it and because you have the again for the podcast listeners you

39:03.400 --> 39:06.280
kind of like if you stack four cups but you do them inverted each time so you

39:06.280 --> 39:08.880
have like a big and small and big and smallest so you kind of do it that way

39:08.880 --> 39:12.480
and then you flip it over it is supposed to be inspired by an actual survivor

39:12.480 --> 39:15.480
challenge that was on the Micronesia season season which was the last

39:15.480 --> 39:18.720
immunity challenge which I believe is a similar thing they had to hold like a

39:18.720 --> 39:22.600
stack of things horizontally that normally would be vertical that type of

39:22.600 --> 39:27.880
thing so um and your forearms start to hurt after a while because what happens

39:27.880 --> 39:30.800
is that if there's even the slightest movement in the cup which is what

39:30.800 --> 39:34.520
happened to me about ten minutes in well I just had a movement I breathed wrong I

39:34.520 --> 39:38.080
don't know one of my cups slipped just a little bit and so now you're pushing

39:38.080 --> 39:41.960
together tighter because you're like shit they're not like the grip is kind

39:41.960 --> 39:44.160
of gone so you have to move them together tighter and then that starts to

39:44.160 --> 39:48.720
hurt your forearms faster and so it's very very interesting but I mean what an

39:48.720 --> 39:52.440
easy what an easy little thing to do that kind of makes for an interesting

39:52.480 --> 39:57.120
challenge but I think a lot of those type of online games have like minute to

39:57.120 --> 39:59.960
win it I use it you remember that old game show minute to win it they have

39:59.960 --> 40:02.880
those minute to win it style challenges so that was that was kind of what it was

40:02.880 --> 40:09.280
so anyways SSG100Matt says is Rob gonna judge the fuck out of people

40:09.280 --> 40:11.720
uh-huh especially if I get voted out uh-huh

40:11.720 --> 40:16.320
Sia Tabiri says so are you gonna be the Thorgy who makes the right decision

40:16.320 --> 40:20.000
absolutely I will make the right decision at the end of the game well

40:20.000 --> 40:23.480
why y'all assuming I'm gonna be on the jury won't I be in the finals why are

40:23.480 --> 40:26.680
you all quick to assume I'm getting voted yeah but no one trusts Thorgy

40:26.680 --> 40:31.720
anyway cuz it's a what he's a white guy with dreads all right anyway so that's

40:31.720 --> 40:35.360
that's the update on that so yeah that supposedly survivor is done in less than

40:35.360 --> 40:39.120
two weeks I've been playing that game for a fucking month and I'm like I like

40:39.120 --> 40:45.280
it's it's so like mentally draining like if I ever talk about that I do this type

40:45.280 --> 40:49.880
of shit again and it's not like all-stars or something like that like

40:49.880 --> 40:52.600
it's just like Oh Rob signed up for another game like you guys have

40:52.600 --> 40:55.280
permission to just like push me and start smacking me with the microphones

40:55.280 --> 40:58.920
over and over and beat some sense into me you have my permission so all right

40:58.920 --> 41:03.600
but I am having fun and I'm meeting some really good people so that's cool all

41:03.600 --> 41:08.400
right anyway um that was my gaming week let's talk a little bit about other

41:08.400 --> 41:14.240
things going on in gaming news so Loki watch stars off some gaming news so we

41:14.240 --> 41:18.200
talked a little bit about the joy con drift thing that was an issue last week

41:18.200 --> 41:20.360
that people started pointing out a little bit more and there's a

41:20.360 --> 41:27.240
class-action lawsuit so Nintendo is kind of addressed the issue by basically

41:27.240 --> 41:33.640
repairing these joy cons for free now and so what they're gonna be doing is

41:33.640 --> 41:38.520
allowing customers to be able to send them in they no longer have to request

41:38.520 --> 41:44.720
to provide proof of purchase for the joy con repairs they just basically send

41:44.720 --> 41:50.480
them in and it gets repaired and then if you did pay for repair previously

41:50.480 --> 41:54.200
they're gonna refund your money that you spent on that so that's good I mean

41:54.200 --> 41:57.280
they've taken advantage of this at some point and it sounds like they've kind of

41:57.280 --> 42:00.400
been cornered into caving into some of the pressure because last week we were

42:00.400 --> 42:03.320
talking about a class-action lawsuit showing up well I just wish they would

42:03.320 --> 42:07.920
just fix the design on it just fix whatever the issue is and then re you

42:07.920 --> 42:13.080
know release them with the new you know I don't know the new ones that come out

42:13.080 --> 42:15.960
I guess well then cuz you know in chat says why not just mail everybody new

42:15.960 --> 42:19.440
joy cons well obviously that's gonna be that's really expensive because

42:19.440 --> 42:23.200
considering that the fix like the piece of the replacing is really minimal yeah

42:23.200 --> 42:28.000
and so to mail out a brand new control that's kind of really and if your joy

42:28.000 --> 42:31.680
cons aren't fucked up they don't want to just send you something that is gonna

42:31.680 --> 42:36.600
set is gonna set them back on costs like you know again my joy cons are okay knock

42:36.600 --> 42:40.880
on wood you know for now they're fine but it's probably because I don't use my

42:40.880 --> 42:44.960
joy cons that much I play like I was a 90% of my switch gaming is on that pro

42:44.960 --> 42:48.540
controller and the only time I use those joy cons is like traveling when I was

42:48.540 --> 42:51.680
like on the plane I did of course I used the joy cons to play Mario maker 2

42:51.680 --> 42:56.040
because getting out the pro controller and the switch on an airplane that's a

42:56.040 --> 43:01.200
bit much but using the joy cons and all that was was a little bit more like you

43:01.200 --> 43:04.240
know like like a Game Boy or something you know yeah really big Game Boy

43:04.240 --> 43:08.640
basically so yeah so that's about the one time I really used to joy cons but

43:08.640 --> 43:11.960
even then I'm still kind of using them attached to the system so I think it's

43:11.960 --> 43:15.120
still a different type of wear and tear than when you you know have them and

43:15.120 --> 43:18.520
you're you know waving them around or doing other stuff you don't have like

43:18.520 --> 43:25.560
third-party joy cons yet I mean I get it that you know that it'd be limited but

43:25.560 --> 43:29.520
like I'm imagining something that's like attached to this kind of a pro controller

43:29.520 --> 43:32.800
type of controller or something like that I mean a little bit beefier that

43:32.800 --> 43:36.480
you be able to that have different analog six or something would be kind

43:36.480 --> 43:40.400
of nice now cuz you and chat says no no he's always clarifying what you're

43:40.400 --> 43:43.680
saying saying I mean you call them up say it's jacked up and they mail you a

43:43.680 --> 43:48.280
new one case by case like Xbox just sent everyone a refurb when it red-ringed oh

43:48.280 --> 43:53.320
yes the coffins they would send you you have to send them your Xbox yeah so I

43:53.320 --> 43:55.840
get but in a way that is kind of what because Nintendo is offering to fix

43:55.840 --> 43:58.640
these right so but you're just not necessarily sending them you're taking

43:58.640 --> 44:02.480
them in right yeah you'd sell the mail it to them I would think it's just like

44:02.480 --> 44:10.920
the Xbox 360 I thought maybe they had like a network of approved fixers no no

44:10.920 --> 44:15.240
one can do that in store even like GameStop has their own like remember in

44:15.240 --> 44:18.360
the back of the PlayStation manual and it would say here's the approved Sony

44:18.360 --> 44:24.040
like repair shops oh I don't be like you and all of Northern California yeah but

44:24.040 --> 44:29.320
yeah no one really does that nowadays but yeah it's nice to see that they're

44:29.320 --> 44:33.600
taking care of this but really you know it shouldn't take a class-action lawsuit

44:33.600 --> 44:37.240
to finally get around to actually fixing an issue yeah it was a little bit

44:37.240 --> 44:40.400
slow-moving I think in that regard but I mean it's it's good that they're at

44:40.400 --> 44:43.440
least like stepping up and trying to fix it as opposed to just trying to shove it

44:43.440 --> 44:47.720
under the rug you know and I think we kind of we kind of knew this it's a

44:47.720 --> 44:51.040
better approach to take then what happened with the red ring where it's

44:51.040 --> 44:55.200
like oh it's a small it's just a small amount of users that are affected by it

44:55.200 --> 44:59.800
you know nip it in the ass now considering the price to fix it is

44:59.800 --> 45:03.520
probably pretty minimal yeah yeah it would just be all those shipping costs

45:03.520 --> 45:07.960
but a giant company like Nintendo gets you know buku contracts on on shipping

45:07.960 --> 45:12.000
and stuff you know so I'm sure it's not you know bad so all right well let's

45:12.000 --> 45:15.800
move on and talk about something that's going on with a Nintendo game I think a

45:15.800 --> 45:19.480
lot of people were excited about Fire Emblem that came out over this weekend

45:19.480 --> 45:22.360
right I think Fire Emblem was out on Friday so I know some people I saw some

45:22.400 --> 45:26.520
people on Twitter talking about it I have to admit not a series I super get

45:26.520 --> 45:31.920
into I'm not as into the tactical games unless it's Final Fantasy Tactics no

45:31.920 --> 45:34.600
hate I understand why people like their fire emblem but it's just you know one

45:34.600 --> 45:37.880
of those games I just don't get around to but a very interesting change

45:37.880 --> 45:41.880
happening with file a fire emblem fire emblem three houses is going to be

45:41.880 --> 45:44.040
getting it and that's the game that just came out it's going to be getting a

45:44.040 --> 45:49.080
patch that will replace the male protagonists voice so Nintendo has

45:49.080 --> 45:54.520
re-recorded the lines for male Blythe that is the name of the male

45:54.520 --> 45:59.800
protagonist because the voice actor Chris Niosi has had some allegations

45:59.800 --> 46:03.920
that have shown up against abusive behavior apparently he's also been

46:03.920 --> 46:08.000
accused of having a tendency to break and da's he has been in other games

46:08.000 --> 46:13.520
including Octopath Traveler Pokemon and Sailor Moon so he has been replaced by

46:13.640 --> 46:19.600
Zack Aguilar from the games One Punch Man and Hunter x Hunter and he was in

46:19.600 --> 46:25.000
the mobile game Fire Emblem Heroes so they're gonna basically do that so

46:25.000 --> 46:30.040
Nintendo of America had mentioned in a statement after assessing the situation

46:30.040 --> 46:34.040
we decided to re-record the characters voiceovers and Fire Emblem three houses

46:34.040 --> 46:37.960
and Fire Emblem Heroes with another actor the voiceovers will be included in

46:37.960 --> 46:45.200
a future patch the original voice actor Niosi put an apology on tumblr after an

46:45.200 --> 46:48.880
ex-girlfriend called him out for emotional abuse and so forth and he has

46:48.880 --> 46:53.160
admitted to horribly mistreating and abusing friends colleagues and even his

46:53.160 --> 46:57.760
significant others so big yikes to all that but definitely sounds like somebody

46:57.760 --> 47:01.920
Nintendo did not want to be associated with anymore I couldn't help but be

47:01.920 --> 47:06.880
reminded of sorts of I feel like we just had a story like two three months ago

47:06.880 --> 47:11.040
about Yakuza game right or yeah it was like Sega's Yakuza game it was a

47:11.040 --> 47:17.120
different type of Yakuza game right where I was saying it was a spin-off no

47:17.120 --> 47:23.520
no it well it was I think it was a spin-off but it was a Yakuza game okay

47:23.520 --> 47:29.200
and they ended up replacing the guy in that who was alcoholism a relative no he

47:29.200 --> 47:34.360
was like doing cocaine and drugs drugs are super yeah he's a actor in Japan

47:34.360 --> 47:37.680
yeah because I think I've seen him before somewhere I remember he was like

47:37.680 --> 47:43.040
a familiar-looking guy like was he like he must have been in some movie that

47:43.040 --> 47:47.360
raises anyway so he was replaced in that and it was kind of like oop he just

47:47.360 --> 47:51.120
vanished from the game but the interesting thing about patches is that

47:51.120 --> 47:57.200
it's you know I and I'm not you know what this guy did is is pretty gross and

47:57.200 --> 48:00.960
I understand why Nintendo doesn't want to be associated but you know there's

48:00.960 --> 48:05.520
going to be those collector collectible people who are gonna be like well I want

48:05.520 --> 48:09.720
to play the version that has the original guy in it because it's gonna be

48:09.720 --> 48:14.960
the more rare version so if I take my switch offline I can hear that one even

48:14.960 --> 48:17.840
though in this day and age of YouTube you would think well if you really just

48:17.840 --> 48:21.000
want to hear the subtle differences between the two interpretations the

48:21.000 --> 48:24.560
character there's gonna be YouTube's galore and things like that but it is it

48:24.560 --> 48:30.240
does create this interesting like pre patch I guess space of trying to see

48:30.240 --> 48:34.000
things before they were changed and I would think even in the case of the

48:34.000 --> 48:39.360
Yakuza game that got flipped there's probably the same type of fascination I

48:39.360 --> 48:42.840
suppose going on I think there's a good word for it fascination you know even if

48:42.840 --> 48:46.240
you're like you know you understand with the reasons everything like that there's

48:46.240 --> 48:50.600
still that that curiosity about I wonder what it sounded like originally if that

48:50.600 --> 48:54.160
makes sense hmm interesting because Bobby brings up a completely different

48:54.160 --> 48:57.440
type of situation with voice actor replacement talking about justice for

48:57.440 --> 49:01.960
Peter Dinklage which you might remember he was the original voice actor in

49:01.960 --> 49:08.320
destiny for the little shit I forgot that thing's name the ghost destiny

49:08.320 --> 49:12.720
goes right so he was the original voice that little thing and he wasn't very

49:12.720 --> 49:16.600
good no it wasn't it wasn't very it wasn't very well done so in one of the

49:16.600 --> 49:20.760
later I think was expansions like just in the middle of the night Nolan North

49:20.760 --> 49:26.720
came and replaced him like just came across the wall and replaced him as the

49:26.720 --> 49:30.080
voice actor and Peter Dinklage was suddenly patched out and that's it but

49:30.080 --> 49:33.000
that's an interesting scenario too because you know you kind of have to

49:33.000 --> 49:36.640
download those patches because destiny isn't always online persistent type of

49:36.640 --> 49:40.280
game yeah I don't think that's the case with something like fire emblems or you

49:40.280 --> 49:45.020
know that Yakuza game we had a little while ago well nowadays it is I guess

49:45.020 --> 49:49.160
remember they did some we had some similar sign into your network account

49:49.160 --> 49:51.560
they haven't you I don't want to spoil what's coming up but you all know it's

49:51.560 --> 49:57.480
they had a recall member of a little big planet remember that because the all

49:57.480 --> 50:00.720
right because the music there was the music was in there and I had one of the

50:00.720 --> 50:04.200
original versions that had like the license hadn't really cleared for it

50:04.200 --> 50:07.980
the disc got out anyway yeah well it was you know wasn't that is because there

50:07.980 --> 50:14.040
was language in there it was it was some foreign words that was offensive somehow

50:14.040 --> 50:20.880
and so right and so that they had to take this on religion or religious

50:20.880 --> 50:25.080
thing and they were that that can be shaky ground you know so but I did have

50:25.080 --> 50:29.960
the original version of that which I had it in there before they pulled it because

50:29.960 --> 50:34.720
they recalled all of them I didn't send my back um I think I ended up selling it

50:34.720 --> 50:39.760
later on but yeah it was it was gonna cry and sell it for enough yeah

50:39.760 --> 50:45.760
interest was patched out later too so yeah let's see going to chat over at a

50:45.920 --> 50:52.440
twitch.tv slash bog network pistol pakas in chat says I mean if you have a cart

50:52.440 --> 50:56.640
copy the patch isn't gonna overwrite that data right no I would imagine it

50:56.640 --> 50:59.960
wouldn't so I mean all you would have to do is delete the local data for the game

50:59.960 --> 51:03.480
from your switch and it's only gonna be I mean you may not be able to play

51:03.480 --> 51:07.540
online you may not be able to do some of the things that because I believe if you

51:07.540 --> 51:11.160
do not have the most current version of a Nintendo game it won't let you play

51:11.160 --> 51:14.560
online until you patch it but you can play it offline and connect it to the

51:14.560 --> 51:18.160
internet and that's how you know I imagine people would do it but most

51:18.160 --> 51:21.840
people aren't gonna bat an eyelash or they they just put their switch on the

51:21.840 --> 51:24.920
dock overnight and it's on their home network so the thing's just gonna update

51:24.920 --> 51:28.280
whether you want it to or not and most people are never gonna know that this

51:28.280 --> 51:32.520
voice actor was just suddenly replaced but yeah it's just it's just it's also

51:32.520 --> 51:37.080
this interesting day and age that we live in where they can do that type of

51:37.080 --> 51:41.520
stuff where they can remove music from Grand Theft Auto San Andreas because

51:41.520 --> 51:45.120
they run out of the license runs out yeah patch it out of the game which is

51:45.120 --> 51:48.960
annoying sg100 Matt reminds us of another case recently John Tron was

51:48.960 --> 51:53.200
taken out of ukulele because there's you know controversy there as well so we'll

51:53.200 --> 51:57.080
just leave it at that so there's what happens when you're a shit to people so

51:57.080 --> 52:03.160
yeah well don't be a shit to people for one but yeah so anyway okay so better to

52:03.160 --> 52:09.000
be the shit then be a shit okay so we kind of touched a little bit tangentially

52:09.000 --> 52:13.720
there another issue that's all over the internet this week so dark Sakura tell

52:13.720 --> 52:19.280
me a little bit about what's going on here Oh shenanigans oh sorry real quick

52:19.280 --> 52:23.000
because quest buster with a great comment about this isn't just games in

52:23.000 --> 52:27.560
this day and age quest buster says reminds me when Ridley Scott literally

52:27.560 --> 52:32.400
reshot everything that had Kevin Spacey in it for his movie all the money in the

52:32.400 --> 52:36.000
world replacing with Christopher Plummer that's right they do that in movies too

52:36.040 --> 52:42.320
so obviously Kevin Spacey yikes so they reshot everything that was somebody else

52:42.320 --> 52:46.600
and didn't I think that Christopher Plummer got an Oscar nomination for it

52:46.600 --> 52:48.960
because I think in Hollywood you know they kind of you know Hollywood's a

52:48.960 --> 52:52.840
weird it's almost like they kind of knew like he did that last minute until it so

52:52.840 --> 52:55.840
he kind of got an Oscar nom for it was interesting anyway all right now we can

52:55.840 --> 52:58.680
move on sorry I thought that was a very interesting comment like oh it's not

52:58.680 --> 53:04.400
just games well okay so as a lot of people know the first three doom games

53:04.400 --> 53:09.680
kind of had this mass release on consoles and mobile devices but it had

53:09.680 --> 53:17.720
this Bethesda login requirement and remember playing doom on the PC back in

53:17.720 --> 53:20.760
the day when you had to log into your Bethesda account in order to get

53:20.760 --> 53:25.520
connected on doom 2 with your friends yeah exactly it's like login to be net

53:25.520 --> 53:31.160
remember that Bina is battle net also like what is that about Bina is battle

53:31.160 --> 53:40.520
net well it anyway they are patching that out it caused a lot of memes it was

53:40.520 --> 53:46.320
great but they put out an announcement and I'll just read it directly this came

53:46.320 --> 53:51.680
out on the 27th so this was yesterday update on our new classic doom releases

53:51.680 --> 53:56.160
the Bethesda net login requirement was included for the Slayer's Club to reward

53:56.160 --> 54:00.240
members for playing the classic doom games the login should be optional and

54:00.320 --> 54:04.000
we're working on changing the requirement to optional now we're just

54:04.000 --> 54:09.920
trying to help you know the best part about that is players club so like since

54:09.920 --> 54:14.000
they got rid of the original versions they delisted those which had

54:14.000 --> 54:20.080
multiplayer by the way and then these don't have the online multiplayer they

54:20.080 --> 54:25.160
don't have the online multiplayer the whole point why the fuck else do you

54:25.160 --> 54:28.280
play doom 2 for the story local multiplayer reading playboy for the

54:28.280 --> 54:33.200
articles get the fuck out anyway honestly I'd never liked to play

54:33.200 --> 54:38.120
multiplayer doom I like to multiplayer Duke Nukem but I didn't like to play

54:38.120 --> 54:42.040
doom multiplayer I just like to play by myself I love to doom to multiplayer I

54:42.040 --> 54:46.280
used to there was a BBS we would call into and it would help connect your doom

54:46.280 --> 54:51.320
games and I was I think I was rocking my was it my 386 still didn't know what

54:51.320 --> 54:55.600
could have it I think was my 486 for a 100 megahertz at the time and I would

54:55.600 --> 54:59.840
play doom in a tiny ass window so that I could actually have the fluid motion

54:59.840 --> 55:05.200
when I was playing online it was so fun like kids today wouldn't understand I

55:05.200 --> 55:09.120
had black and white doom format classic that I would sneak and play during the

55:09.120 --> 55:16.120
middle of my typing class in college at any rate you know the games are out now

55:16.120 --> 55:24.720
doom and doom 2 or 499 and doom 3 is 999 and you can play them on iOS and Xbox

55:24.720 --> 55:31.240
PlayStation for Xbox one Nintendo switch and Android so yeah none of them have

55:31.240 --> 55:37.640
the multiplayer we don't really that is so stupid because I have the one on

55:37.640 --> 55:43.120
Xbox 360 which they made backwards compatible with Xbox one so it's in your

55:43.120 --> 55:46.960
Xbox one library and as far as I remember you can still play that one

55:46.960 --> 55:50.600
online I don't know anybody else with ad listen to that so you can't sell so that

55:50.600 --> 55:55.800
you can't get it again you can't buy it we'll just build some 486 and have some

55:55.800 --> 56:00.160
land go on seriously we need to do we need to do a PC do night hell yeah or

56:00.160 --> 56:04.240
Duke Nukem honestly Duke Nukem was the best at all I like the voice macros oh

56:04.240 --> 56:09.560
yeah like Duke Nukem was like the the creme de la creme of those 90 shooters I

56:09.560 --> 56:13.120
think because that's the one I remember playing in the college dorm we would be

56:13.120 --> 56:16.480
yelling each other from down the hall like when we get killed that was those

56:16.480 --> 56:23.160
were the days anyway so what were some of your favorite memes you guys saw of

56:23.160 --> 56:27.560
course Bobby black ones Bobby black wolf in our chat he did a little thing on his

56:27.560 --> 56:30.960
podcast I hit a little graphic that came up that said yet needed Bethesda

56:30.960 --> 56:34.360
announcement can't counsel listen to podcast I'm sure somebody clipped it and

56:34.360 --> 56:37.320
it's over on Twitch I'll be honest I didn't really see all that many he also

56:37.320 --> 56:40.880
did one for his Tesla which is funny oh yeah the one he did for his Tesla was

56:40.880 --> 56:45.040
funny yeah I saw Tesla being towed yesterday that wasn't Bobby's Tesla

56:45.040 --> 56:48.880
Bobby did something on Twitter where I think there must be a drawing app or

56:48.880 --> 56:52.160
something on those big screens and he put like you must log into your

56:52.160 --> 56:54.920
Bethesda net account to turn on your car so that's something like that I'm

56:54.920 --> 57:00.640
paraphrasing but yeah that was pretty funny yeah I thought there were I just

57:00.640 --> 57:03.720
thought some of the classic 8-bit memes were great with the whole like you know

57:03.720 --> 57:06.880
you must log into your Bethesda net account to find our princess in another

57:06.880 --> 57:10.760
castle you know things like that just good stuff you got it you got to love

57:10.760 --> 57:15.320
Twitter going crazy with the memes good stuff anyway it's always fun when

57:15.320 --> 57:22.520
Bethesda is a joke which is all the time nowadays I just why would you put out

57:22.520 --> 57:26.360
something again like I get the whole like oh we want to put doom on iOS and

57:26.360 --> 57:33.240
and all that stuff why would you take out the multiplayer like just I'll take

57:33.240 --> 57:37.280
I don't want to run the multiplayer servers for five thousand please I guess

57:37.280 --> 57:40.400
I don't know I don't know what that's all about that's unfortunate isn't there

57:40.560 --> 57:44.680
some reddit out there I swear to God I saw some reddit where it was like will

57:44.680 --> 57:49.560
it run doom and it's them installing do because the doom source code was public

57:49.560 --> 57:53.840
some time ago I think I think they made it for somebody so they get doom running

57:53.840 --> 57:57.560
all these things because I remember recently there was some type of exploit

57:57.560 --> 58:01.080
within it was either the Harry Potter game or Pokemon go game one of those

58:01.080 --> 58:05.280
games you could launch a full-on web browser from within the game so somebody

58:05.280 --> 58:09.880
had them playing doom within Pokemon go and like that's the type of shit you see

58:09.880 --> 58:14.000
on reddit we're like you know running it's called like running doom or doom I

58:14.000 --> 58:18.160
don't know but it's it's what what can you install doom on so it's it's weird

58:18.160 --> 58:22.080
that this is so timed where it's like yay we got doom on iOS and all this

58:22.080 --> 58:29.840
stuff but we fucking changed it it's a little silly no no just just played on

58:29.840 --> 58:34.800
PC like you have a PC that runs I know if you have a PC you have a PC that runs

58:34.800 --> 58:39.240
doom you sure do Bobby Blackwell says yeah you know this will open next year's

58:39.240 --> 58:42.800
e3 presser you think they're gonna be that tongue-in-cheek enough to start

58:42.800 --> 58:46.080
their e3 presser and then have a splash screen saying you must have your

58:46.080 --> 58:49.840
Bethesda net account to continue I could see them phrasing it a different way to

58:49.840 --> 58:52.800
poke fun at it they might say it like they might show a sample login screen

58:52.800 --> 58:57.360
please log into your Bethesda account and then the person I would think that

58:57.360 --> 59:00.240
they are not gonna do that and the reason because we're talking like

59:00.240 --> 59:06.080
almost a year away I mean why bring that memes shelf why bring why bring that

59:06.080 --> 59:11.200
back up why why remind people that you fucked up in a way because I'm sure

59:11.200 --> 59:16.440
between now and June of next year they're gonna fuck up in it dozens of

59:16.440 --> 59:20.960
ways that are gonna be far greater than what we have with just doom so honestly

59:20.960 --> 59:24.400
think next year's e3 presser they just open with the theme from the Elder

59:24.400 --> 59:29.720
Scrolls and then show show off Elder Scrolls 6 and it's just like this at

59:29.720 --> 59:33.760
this point at this point they should just fucking mock the South Park I'm

59:33.760 --> 59:39.360
sorry video and just have Todd Howard apologizing to be fair to the folks in

59:39.360 --> 59:43.640
chat as 200 Matt says they were able to joke about themselves about fallout 76

59:43.640 --> 59:47.240
they will rip themselves plenty oh yes and that worked out so well for them

59:47.240 --> 59:51.620
they brought up fallout 76 stuff as soon her Matt says they made jokes about the

59:51.620 --> 59:54.960
arrow to the knee stuff in the presser do you know like I've heard that joke

59:54.960 --> 59:58.780
was in Mortal Kombat 11 oh yeah I heard that arrow to the knee stuff so fucking

59:58.780 --> 01:00:03.120
much that when I was do you remember I randomly started playing Skyrim VR when

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:06.440
I was like getting in place in VR like I got to the point where the guy really

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:10.520
says that and I did I'm like is this guy being a meep oh no oh this is the

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:16.880
actual arrow to the knee part like I had that like whoa meta moment type of thing

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:21.040
going on like oh it's an arrow to the knee Joe oh wait no this this is the

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:24.820
arrow to the knee line I am it was great it's like you have those guards to say

01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:28.520
that and then they run straight up to a dragon started hitting it with a sword

01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:35.240
and get like torched by fire and they're like yeah I was actually watching like

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:39.800
all the intros on Mortal Kombat 11 to get the references and it's totally a

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:45.280
line even today yeah my favorite is the mod for Skyrim whenever they say that

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:51.400
line they get struck by lightning see a tiberian chat says it's like right in

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:55.920
front of my salad oh I still use that today in fact I was I think the last

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:58.960
time I used it was in one of these type of games I think it was like the

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:01.440
survivor II type games I think it was a different one that was going faster and

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:04.240
something happened that I didn't like and I said to the other person I was

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:09.000
like really right in front of my salad you're gonna do that so those those

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:17.580
memes oh you know so there was a gay porn that was shot and I don't know what

01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:21.440
they're doing oh they're full-on like having sex in the kitchen but they're

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:27.440
doing it like the counter is up here so they're like down here and the girl who

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:30.740
I don't know if she's supposed to be somebody's girlfriend or she's like you

01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:34.480
know the the fruit fly the flame dame type of thing or what but she's like

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:38.600
eating your salad and she's like she looks and she goes are you guys fucking

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:43.760
and she goes really right in front of my salad that's pretty great and honestly

01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:48.160
that would be me it was I'd be like don't do that in the kitchen that's in

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:53.880
sanitary it was it was improved I think and now of course of course she is now

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:57.640
like famous you know she's making her coin off that whole thing I think they

01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:01.640
put her in legit movies and stuff you know they made a sequel to a poor she's

01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:05.400
not even a porn actress she was just like the salad chick but now she's

01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:10.360
getting in all these porns because she's the salad girl she's the solid salad

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:15.080
tosser but honestly that would be I'd just be like that's unsanitary don't do

01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:20.560
pixel pakka says that porn company has a weird thing about girls discovering the

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:25.520
screwing and Sia Tiberi says it's the girlfriend the one guy is pretending to

01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:29.240
be an in-home cooking class thing for the boyfriend and then it went to like

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:36.080
sex okay I guess they thank you all for explaining the plot and for your later

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:41.880
brows all s 200 Matt has linked to these safe for work version on YouTube if you

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:44.800
wish to go look at that I'm going to assume that there's black bars because

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:51.160
it's on YouTube covering up the like I'm offended by I'm just offended by you

01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:58.760
seen one you see them all I'm afraid that salad dressing oh yeah she's just

01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:10.440
like it's also the way she says it she's like really anyway tall counter to me

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:15.200
baby oh it's a bar nevermind oh I see maybe this whole meme thing does have

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:18.400
weight cuz here we are talking about the salad chick and that was like two years

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:26.120
ago we are we that I'm saving that now so I can watch it when I get home okay

01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:29.880
yeah yeah you got to do homework sure all right anyway let's move on all right

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:33.000
Loki then if you don't like this topic how about a new one we'll talk about

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:38.120
grand theft auto online and you know there's been an issue with blue boxes

01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:44.480
being compared to gambling and you know that a lot of companies can get in

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:50.280
trouble because of in-game gambling mechanics might kind of run afoul of

01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:55.200
some online gambling laws well take two said fuck all that let's put gambling in

01:03:55.200 --> 01:04:00.600
our games so they opened up the diamond casino in Grand Theft Auto online so you

01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:06.480
can actually go in there and buy chips and gamble and you win money and of

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:10.160
course because this is Grand Theft Auto online you can buy shark cards with real

01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:15.640
money and get in-game money to gamble with and stuff like that so because of

01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:25.880
that issue certain countries can actually purchase the in-game cards or

01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:30.920
even do some of the gambling games in there because of different local laws so

01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:36.720
for example Iceland Iran Peru and Vietnam are some of the countries that

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:45.520
you can't access most of the casino and also that certain things you can't you

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:50.280
can't buy the penthouse in the casino as well and you're not actually able to

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:56.480
virtually gamble in there so it's interesting that they have to go this

01:04:56.480 --> 01:05:02.120
route to kind of get around the different laws but what happens when you

01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:07.160
put actual gambling in your game granted yes you can't actually get real money

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:11.360
from this but you can pay real money for in someone with gambling tendencies

01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:18.040
wants to win that in-game you know money to buy like some fake car in there they

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:24.800
may be tempted to drop real-world money to buy chips and so it's kind of an

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:28.160
issue no that's something fascinating that I wouldn't have thought about is

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:32.960
that you might have like this like real-world gambling you know issue and

01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:38.840
that you kind of act out through online games because maybe it's less of a

01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:42.720
problem because it's it's a fake game but in the same time yeah I mean you

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:46.800
could get like if someone has gambling tendencies and you're you're betting

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:52.240
like fake money you're still gonna have the same response like to that even

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:55.000
though you're not winning real money and because of that you're like oh man

01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:01.360
no I'm down I just need to I only pay I'm gonna pay ten dollars and we get some

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:04.340
more money and then I'm gonna get back on top of him win that money back you

01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:08.040
could have like that same kind of tendency and they fucking know what

01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:11.720
they're doing they fucking know what they're doing they know people are gonna

01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:14.600
there's some people out there they're gonna do that and they don't care

01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:20.920
because they're making money off of it so it is what it is some people though

01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:24.520
of course being the internet age are getting around these restrictions by

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:29.660
using VPNs because they can so even this won't necessarily stop them but that may

01:06:29.660 --> 01:06:34.280
be illegal in your country if you do that interesting all right well let's

01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:38.360
move on to another topic this is one that I think many of us have

01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:42.200
unfortunately had to deal with when playing games and maybe you know earlier

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:45.520
we were kind of having a laugh about the doom online and the fact that it's been

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:49.320
removed but you know some of us maybe aren't playing games online the way we

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:53.200
used to and the reason why is because of assholes harassment is really what it

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:59.400
is and this week making its way around the gaming blogs is a new survey by the

01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:04.880
Anti-Defamation League or ADL and as part of their report they reported that

01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:09.920
as many as two-thirds of online gamers in the US have experienced it had

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:13.920
experienced what they called severe harassment half of the responders of the

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:20.120
survey said that their race religion ability gender sexual orientation or

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:24.720
ethnicity was something that made them a target and 30% claimed they've been

01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:30.000
doxxed in an online game that one really that seems so high all they had to do is

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:34.880
ask a woman oh yeah no I would have told him it's no it's and don't like I'm

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:39.400
absolutely not going like wow I can't believe it's this rampant like don't get

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:43.680
me wrong like I'm it's absolutely it's this rampant and I'm sure but I'm just

01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:52.640
the 30% docs I'm like that's Wow that's scary and a quarter of respondents said

01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:57.200
that online they have been exposed to white supremacist ideology that also

01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:02.760
being a part of the ADL report which obviously is a whole nother yikes and

01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:05.680
you know just leave it at that but unfortunately I think those of us that

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:11.800
have been on a rando map online or something unfortunately yeah I've heard

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:14.960
all I've heard all that stupid shit when playing things like destiny and

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:18.720
halo and that type of stuff online with randos and it's why I really don't like

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:23.360
fucking playing with randos online anymore I don't fucking do it on Xbox

01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:27.640
Live or this Xbox Live is for playing with my friends vog network people are

01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:31.520
fine because I feel like if you are at the level enough where you want to come

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:34.240
hang with us in online clubs and things like that then you kind of know you

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:38.080
accept these rules of you're not gonna be a fucking asshole because you know

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:43.000
Bobby'll ban you if you do I want like though there to be team mute that you

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:47.680
vote and you mute somebody I want to say and I could be wrong I want to say

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:51.640
either halo or destiny did put something like that in that if enough people kind

01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:55.840
of muted somebody that person would be muted but I don't quote me on that but I

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:59.840
want to say that is something that has been explored in the I want ostracism to

01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:05.440
be a thing they have to be careful because some people could use that type

01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:09.200
of voting system to gang up on an innocent person that's the problem is

01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:13.920
that the bad guys are gonna use it for their own purposes too that's that's and

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:17.080
that's why I think you haven't seen that stuff if stuff implemented more

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:21.800
widespread I just really want like Jean Grey level psychic power so I can reach

01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:25.880
across the country and smack them in the head because Nazis deserve to be punched

01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:31.200
misogynists deserve to be punched metal mayhem and chat says not just gamers but

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:35.760
streamers too oh sure that's one reason where it's like you know olr we get

01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:41.160
anywhere between what like 25 maybe 45 maybe 50 at our peak viewers that we get

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:46.800
live we have about 33 on right now if my little console is to be believed we have

01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:49.340
more than that that listen on the podcast feed but you know we have a we

01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:51.920
have a decently sized crowd that turns up here on Sunday nights and we're

01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:56.200
really appreciative but I like that we're kind of like at that level where

01:09:56.200 --> 01:10:00.820
we're pulling a respectable crowd here people people actually want to listen to

01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:04.100
what we're doing and we appreciate that I love it and they want to participate

01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:09.260
in the conversation that's wonderful too but we're not big enough where the

01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:12.820
fucking haters are coming out or the people that are just there to get a

01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:17.940
reaction are coming out like that's a problem that you're more twitch partners

01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:22.220
and the people that have you know 200 people that watch one of their streams

01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:25.580
that's the stuff they have to deal with so in a way like you know and I've been

01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:28.860
asked kind of point-blank are you are you irritated that you're not more

01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:33.900
famous and it's one of those things where it's like I don't know like then

01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:38.140
I if we were bigger we'd have to deal with all that shit and I don't know how

01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:43.020
I feel about that I kind of I feel like we're almost better off in a way not

01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:48.980
having to deal with that so um guys you doing chat says I play online a lot and

01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:54.020
no one ever talks once in a blue moon I think the missing word there I see some

01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:58.100
nasty text in rocket League but most of the time people never use voice chat it

01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:02.140
may also depend on what you're playing and I know I don't use voice chat

01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:05.300
because I got sick of the things people were saying on voice chat so if I do

01:11:05.300 --> 01:11:11.340
play games online I don't use it now it is worth saying I do play things like

01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:16.540
Final Fantasy 14 World of Warcraft in the past I've played those types of MMOs

01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:22.660
online but I think it's harder to be that much of an asshole in those games

01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:27.340
because usually you're working together towards a common goal and if you're

01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:31.900
gonna be that guy then you're not gonna get to the goal either and granted don't

01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:34.820
get me wrong and I know full well know some people exist in in those things

01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:38.700
only to troll and I've seen my fair share of them in World of Warcraft but

01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:42.860
even the trolls will oftentimes end up they end up on block lists and then when

01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:45.700
they want to do something for real later on they can't because they've pissed

01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:50.420
everybody off on the server so anyway some other comments I wanted to read

01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:55.060
about this report and then we can stew on it a little bit if we want online

01:11:55.060 --> 01:11:58.820
harassment is getting worse and a similar ADL survey this according to

01:11:58.820 --> 01:12:03.700
past studies that was conducted earlier in the year talked about that 37% of

01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:09.540
Americans have experienced severe harassment online online gaming meant

01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:14.260
when they kind of analyzed that the ADL survey said 65% of players experienced

01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:18.820
severe harassment when it's the online gaming now just some things about the

01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:23.900
survey ADL sampled about a thousand people and to be fair the gaming

01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:29.460
community at large is trying to figure out what they can do about this for

01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:33.660
example Phil Spencer from Xbox recently had that post about laying out things

01:12:33.660 --> 01:12:37.180
for combating abuse saying that you know gaming is for everyone period

01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:42.420
overwatch they put in the endorsement feature so that you you kind of reward

01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:45.420
people as opposed to punishing people and they say that the endorsement

01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:51.140
feature reduced toxic behavior by 40% so some things to consider but obviously

01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:57.780
harassment is still a thing I don't know without going too deep what what

01:12:57.780 --> 01:13:03.060
can we do about it what can us decent people do about harassment and I think

01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:05.980
there's definitely like number one I think the obvious thing would be you

01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:10.180
know call it out when you see it like if somebody's getting harassed you know as

01:13:10.180 --> 01:13:12.980
much as you might not want to or something like that you have to kind of

01:13:12.980 --> 01:13:17.020
stand up for the underdog a little bit right but I think the reality of the

01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:20.740
situation is that most of us are just pulling out of these situations where

01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:24.940
we even get to where the bullies are and like I said I just play with friends

01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:29.500
done like this is why I don't get in these mixed situations so I don't know

01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:36.020
thoughts yeah calling it out I think just reporting people that are you know

01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:42.900
doing this kind of harassment and I mean I don't know just playing with friends

01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:48.940
yeah guys you doing chat says anytime I hear a jerk picking on someone I fight

01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:53.020
back as Jonah to Matt says the report did say the 88% of players who play

01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:57.300
certain games like Warcraft had very positive experiences as voice chats and

01:13:57.300 --> 01:14:00.580
you know I think especially like but in Wow and in Final Fantasy and those types

01:14:00.580 --> 01:14:04.140
of games you find your guildies you kind of find your tribe you find your people

01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:07.060
and you're on voice chat with those people and like people are gonna treat

01:14:07.060 --> 01:14:09.740
each other with respect because again you're helping each other out you're all

01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:13.100
get you're all getting epic purples or whatever the equivalent is in the game

01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:17.420
you're playing you know pixel pockets and chat says any game I play I

01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:22.060
immediately mute voice chat for all and I'm silent myself it only took a few

01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:25.740
shitty people to make me decide it's not worth it with random people I'll just

01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:29.620
chat with my friends and that's more fun anyway yeah I'm kind of right there with

01:14:29.620 --> 01:14:36.620
you all right well anyhow let's move on and talk about other voice issues right

01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:43.420
dark soccer what do you have well this one um I don't really know how I feel

01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:46.900
about it but basically Microsoft is gonna be tweaking their Xbox one

01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:51.860
dashboard again and this time they're removing Cortana I don't know it's still

01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:59.260
on PC and Windows 10 right the Cortana interface I don't I believe Cortana

01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:04.380
still on Windows 10 yeah but at any rate they are removing it and redesigning

01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:10.340
things and it'll bring everything into one area where you can see it right away

01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:16.220
so it's supposed to give you quicker access to your past titles mixer service

01:15:16.260 --> 01:15:22.340
community and Microsoft Store and so they're just I guess in the long run

01:15:22.340 --> 01:15:27.980
trying to make it a more efficient thing but Cortana is going bye-bye I guess they

01:15:27.980 --> 01:15:31.340
do need to kind of clean up some of that extra stuff on Xbox one and I can't I

01:15:31.340 --> 01:15:34.660
can't think of a time where I've been like Cortana take me to the store to buy

01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:38.220
Castlevania or something you know it's just doesn't really happen but yeah the

01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:41.260
big thing on here is that yeah you can no longer talk to her via your headset

01:15:41.260 --> 01:15:46.860
you can still power on your Xbox one through Xbox skill for Cortana on iOS

01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:51.420
Android or Windows so that's true because there might be for some people

01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:55.580
that might be an accessibility thing so I don't just want to like say well it's

01:15:55.580 --> 01:16:01.060
useless for me so fuck it because I could there could be a very big reason

01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:05.660
why it could be an accessibility thing for Cortana to help you navigate there's

01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:13.780
more they basically are refocusing Cortana for the business scenarios and

01:16:13.780 --> 01:16:19.300
are working on conversation recognition but they did decouple her from the

01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:26.060
Windows 10 for the May update and they are making Cortana a separate app hmm so

01:16:26.060 --> 01:16:28.700
interesting well it's good that it's still there because I bet there are some

01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:32.580
people that kind of need Cortana s2100 Matt and chat says Cortana was

01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:36.020
initially used with your Kinect after they killed that off you could still do

01:16:36.020 --> 01:16:40.580
it with your mic now it's gone Bobby Blackwell says I used Xbox record that a

01:16:40.580 --> 01:16:45.060
lot but Cortana took it away and mental mayhem says to be honest when I first

01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:49.420
got Windows 10 I tried Cortana just for the lulls but it got boring quick all

01:16:49.420 --> 01:16:54.060
those comments from our chat room over at twitch TV slash vog network so there

01:16:54.060 --> 01:16:59.420
you go Cortana will no longer be a part of the Xbox one after well unless you

01:16:59.420 --> 01:17:03.900
use some workarounds and things like that after a future update let's move on

01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:06.200
a few more stories for you guys then we're gonna get to the classic game of

01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:11.540
the week Loki yes so this is kind of neat there's a brand new I don't know

01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:19.700
spirit not really unauthorized spiritual successor I guess of Simon's quest so

01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:23.700
there's a game that's coming out that someone's working on called Simon quest

01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:30.220
Transylvania adventure and it's kind of homage or parody of Simon's quest and

01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:39.580
it's like a indie game that hopefully won't get struck down by you know a DMC

01:17:39.580 --> 01:17:43.740
a or something like that but it definitely is got the same type of stuff

01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:47.620
that you would see in Simon's quest they said convoluted hints mansions and a

01:17:47.620 --> 01:17:52.180
time system that doesn't make you wait and apparently they're working on a demo

01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:58.780
so this is a the Twitter user program answer and looks pretty cool so far just

01:17:58.780 --> 01:18:04.900
based on the little video that he posted definitely get the vibe of Castlevania a

01:18:04.900 --> 01:18:08.460
little too much though I was gonna say I getting some cease-and-desist vibes on

01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:13.180
yeah you know at what point does parody end and copycat yeah I don't get me

01:18:13.180 --> 01:18:17.780
wrong like it looks great it looks really cool like I love the retro vibe

01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:21.220
it's giving and you know and and just how much it kind of invokes Castlevania

01:18:21.220 --> 01:18:24.940
but it's kind of this different thing obviously um and I understand that like

01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:30.660
they're trying to like not use the Castlevania name but Simon quest yeah

01:18:30.660 --> 01:18:33.940
maybe you should have renamed your protagonist maybe why don't they call

01:18:33.940 --> 01:18:36.620
like castle quest or well I guess that was probably a name of the game

01:18:36.620 --> 01:18:41.500
sometime at some point or like you know Simon adventure yes something something

01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:49.780
to get it a little more distant from that so hmm it looks neat hope it comes

01:18:49.780 --> 01:18:56.060
out Sia Tabiri suggests Trevor quest in our chat room Trevor quest yeah use one

01:18:56.060 --> 01:19:01.700
of the other all right Belmont's why not yeah I don't know I'm definitely looking

01:19:01.700 --> 01:19:06.140
forward to checking out if it actually ends up coming out apparently though

01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:12.820
they were supposed to have a playable version of it at Con Bravo so I don't

01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:17.240
know we'll see but I'm guessing there's I'm guessing Konami doesn't exactly have

01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:25.120
the rush the rush between you know C and D versus it being out now it's that

01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:28.360
stuff at the end of your project tears we're just like hey look I made this

01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:36.240
game it's done now you can see India it's too late yeah pixel pocket suggests

01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:42.080
the name no me's quest that's Simon backwards SSG 100 Matt suggests the

01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:47.320
title love Simon quest I guess how about how about they they could just

01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:52.000
change the protagonist Simone's quest Simone's quest own Raven Simone ace

01:19:52.000 --> 01:20:00.560
quest let's not do that why not see a debris just Dracula scavenger hunt the

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:05.640
adventure all right anyway let's move on let's talk a little bit about something

01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:09.360
that is going to be going away from the Wii U for those of you that are still

01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:12.640
using your Wii U which there might be some of you out there I mean even though

01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:15.520
I'm sure many of you have updated to the switch there might be some reasons to

01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:21.880
keep your Wii U around but as of September 26th if you do use a Wii U to

01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:27.000
watch Amazon Prime video you'll no longer be able to do that prime video

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:31.280
users are starting to get emails letting them know that they no longer to be able

01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:35.880
to do that and this is kind of interesting a $25 credit towards buying

01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:40.480
fire TV devices to help that feel a little less now I want to just fire up

01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:45.680
my Wii U and open the no I'm not gonna get a fire team all right the email says

01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:49.280
we are continually upgrading our service and this occasionally means we can no

01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:52.480
longer support certain device models to help you continue streaming your

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:55.800
favorite content we're offering you a $25 credit towards select fire TV

01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:59.040
devices which will allow you to continue to stream your favorites from prime

01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:04.120
video so if you're using the Wii U for this you still have Netflix YouTube and

01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:08.240
Hulu today but who knows how much longer that is going to be now it should

01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:11.920
be pointed out Amazon Prime is not on the switch some of these you know I

01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:15.360
think YouTube's on the switch at this point Hulu's on the switch but not

01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:21.000
Slick's no not Netflix Netflix ain't on the switch and Amazon Prime isn't on the

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:26.200
switch so this isn't as easy as just going over to the switch and I will say

01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:31.480
you know what I I have used I do remember downloading prime video onto

01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:35.800
the Wii U and using it because my broadcast signal from the Wii U was

01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:39.640
strong enough where if I had Amazon going on the Wii U I could take the

01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:44.440
tablet into the bedroom and watch an episode of Drag Race or something from

01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:49.720
the bedroom so you know they're there may be some uses why somebody wants to

01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:52.360
take that tablet and watch it somewhere else their house a little portable

01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:56.400
television so but I guess at the same time if I wanted to I could just use my

01:21:56.400 --> 01:22:00.840
phone but the Wii U had that kind of bigger screen you know yeah I mean it's

01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:05.040
nice but I understand that they don't need they want to support it but I'm not

01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:09.280
gonna profess that I've like used it at all ever recently they probably figured

01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:14.920
out that the numbers aren't really you know there as far as the number of users

01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:21.240
and so it makes sense that they would probably retire mm-hmm let's see I

01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:25.080
wanted to read some other comments in chat Bobby Blackwell points out twitch

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:30.200
also isn't on the switch no that's I mean I think we all understand be too

01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:33.600
easy twitch on the switch well and we understand that the switch probably

01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:38.360
isn't going to let you broadcast stuff because of you know the the parts that

01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:40.560
are in it maybe when there's a pro maybe that's something I'm looking at for the

01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:45.560
pro hmm who knows we'll just theorize on that oh I have the pros I have a pro

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:50.480
switch to do streaming services I bet that'll be a thing but anyway but it's

01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:54.640
surprising that you don't at least just have the twitch like watch stuff client

01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:58.560
that is a little weird I think yeah I don't know I'd love to be able to have

01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:03.840
that so anyway as 200 Matt says most companies are like this is gone in blank

01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:08.000
days if you have problems with this kick rocks yeah so it's it's kind of true

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:12.560
that you know they didn't have to offer the $25 incentive on the fire TV or

01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:17.600
whatever but they are but I think Amazon probably discounted the price by 25 bucks

01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:23.120
on Prime Day anyway if not more than that so I'm sure Amazon takes a loss I

01:23:23.120 --> 01:23:27.240
mean because it's almost like game consoles the more fire TVs that are in

01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:31.720
home the more people that are likely to buy stuff on the Amazon Prime video

01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:35.720
thing so it kind of suits them to have that in as many places as possible so I

01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:43.360
don't think this is just them being the nice guy if you will all right anyhow as

01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:48.920
200 Matt says maybe it'll let you stream from the switch but only at 480 P let's

01:23:48.920 --> 01:23:52.960
see your streams are gonna be crap quality all right let's move on to the

01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:56.840
classic game of the week every week dark soccer steps in the gaming vault and

01:23:56.840 --> 01:24:00.120
finds a game that she thinks hey you guys should be remembering this game

01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:03.440
this week I'm kind of surprised you're doing this game this week this is a big

01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:06.880
one and I thought you might have would save this for an anniversary show or

01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:11.040
something yeah yeah I thought we'd already done this one too I also thought

01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:14.600
we'd already done this one I think just with me being kind of in music game mode

01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:18.560
it stuck out in my head it's fair and it's also one of those congratulations

01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:22.360
this game is 10 years old type of moments actually right now it's 12 years

01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:26.120
old all right so what is the game rock band there you go so I just want to

01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:30.080
point out usually on the podcast we have a little bit of the game's audio in

01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:34.160
the background um however tonight we have removed the audio just because we

01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:38.480
don't want to risk a twitch muting for the copyright music so we only have the

01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:44.040
visual writing on twitch you can get like something like Charlene I'm right

01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:47.560
behind you or whatever like I just I didn't want to risk it even with the

01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:52.200
freebie songs so it's fine if you yeah y'all probably you're already familiar

01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:55.080
with rock band I imagine this crowd pretty familiar with rock band already

01:24:55.080 --> 01:25:02.000
yeah anyway so rock band is a music game is developed by harmonix it was

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:08.360
published by MTV games and distributed by EA and we are talking about the first

01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:15.200
game in the series it was out for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 released on

01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:20.760
November 20th 2007 and there was a PlayStation 2 version it was released

01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:30.680
December 18th 2007 so also a Wii version on June 22nd 2008 harmonix had

01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:36.480
also developed the guitar hero series and then when the guitar hero was sent

01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:43.280
off to never soft harmonix made the new game with multi-instrument gameplay so

01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:48.640
sort of like having your guitar in one game instead of spread out amongst all

01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:54.080
of the various you know I guess it actually was kind of like the guitar

01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:58.240
you know by having the multiple instruments except you you know it grew

01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:05.840
from there from just you know guitar and drum and mic and there have been like a

01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:11.800
bajillion sequels you know of rock band so we won't even be getting into there

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:17.880
but basically you've got your different peripherals you have you know of course

01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:20.960
your on-screen interface is what controls how you're supposed to do it

01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:24.760
with the mic you have to sing to relative pitch to the original vocal so

01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:28.160
I know some people who just may as well not fucking use the mic because they

01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:31.960
can't you know hold a tune in a bag

01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:38.240
there's nothing also by the way that will set off like my own self loathing

01:26:38.240 --> 01:26:43.280
of my voice than playing ink on the mic in garage band just saying I hate

01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:49.600
hearing myself out of key but you know you also have you know your guitar one

01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:55.600
person can be bass and you've got your drum kit later on of course you know we

01:26:55.600 --> 01:27:01.280
got the piano and the cymbals and all these other goodies so at any rate you

01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:07.160
build up your score you get different multipliers and you have an overdrive

01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:13.000
that lets you just you know apparently play really awesome and then you can use

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:17.880
like on the guitar you use your whammy bar for like using effectors for how

01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:22.080
you're playing you know example you've got different difficulty levels easy

01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:27.960
medium hard and expert and if you don't play well enough you get muted out of

01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:36.880
the song so there you go um the PlayStation 2 and we version didn't have

01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:42.480
any customizable options for your player but Xbox 360 and ps3 did so you could

01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:46.480
change their physique their clothes tattoos the way they move all kinds of

01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:53.960
stuff and then you know again we had a the guitar was based off the Fender

01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:59.200
Stratocaster you had you know your your drum pedals you also have like your game

01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:03.400
modes like band world tour where you could play in different venues and

01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:07.560
unlock things and customize your character even more you also have like

01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:15.320
solo play you have a solo tour and the soundtrack pretty massive so they

01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:20.640
reached out to five record labels that provided most of the master recordings

01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:28.160
including EMI Hollywood Records Sony BMG Universal Music and Warner Music well

01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:32.000
actually for Warner Music specifically it was Rhino Entertainment you know you

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:36.160
know what I remember about Rhino Entertainment is that when I was young I

01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:39.680
had a bunch of albums that had the old Rhino logo on it and that's how I always

01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:47.480
remember Rhino Entertainment but they had you know the Wii version had five

01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:52.280
additional songs by the way over some of the others they had Danny California

01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:56.600
don't fear the Reaper understand man here it goes again

01:28:56.600 --> 01:29:00.880
highway star and learn to fly oh and suffragette city and when I dead or

01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:04.280
alive and won't get fooled again so those are bonus you could also get

01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:11.240
downloaded you know track packs and single songs so like to date one thousand

01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:16.320
four hundred and eighty downloadable songs are available that's a lot of

01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:23.240
music but at any rate like I said it was developed by a harmonics post guitar

01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:30.880
hero and red octane and made the the it looks like red octane was making the

01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:37.280
peripherals but yeah we never soft took over development of guitar hero well

01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:41.040
harmonics had to go somewhere I had to do something and so they started in

01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:44.560
February 2006 working with different designers for prototyping the

01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:49.560
instruments for developing an all-new hardware bringing in things like your

01:29:49.560 --> 01:29:55.840
drum support and they just kept working on it from there and it ended up being

01:29:55.840 --> 01:30:04.320
you know such a big hit like I said we've got so many so many other

01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:11.160
peripherals and it's so many other releases that it just just really moved

01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:16.800
right along they did have licensing fees for using some of the wireless

01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:24.000
technology especially for Microsoft and if they had chosen to pay for it they

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.880
would have actually released the different versions at different costs

01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:34.880
so they used wired technology to start off with it so so anyway yeah it's got

01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:42.360
a massive online community at rock band calm and now I mean remember we used to

01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:48.160
help out with them loud the charity event where you basically play rock band

01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:55.640
on stage I used to do some of the graphics but it was I mean there's all

01:30:55.640 --> 01:31:02.560
these like weird special editions too like there's Green Day and I think there

01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:08.960
was Beatles rock band that was a big deal but you know as it came out you

01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:15.720
know they also were learning that of course some of the guitars from other

01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:19.920
games were incompatible for example the Gibson Les Paul guitar controller that

01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:25.720
came with guitar hero 3 was not compatible with rock band even though

01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:31.880
harmonics said that they had an open controller support but basically

01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:35.720
harmonics and Activision we're just pointing fingers back and forth harmonics

01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:45.280
put out a patch Activision blocked it so who's the bad guy here and then but

01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:48.920
Activision then announced that guitar hero world tour would use the rock bands

01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:58.600
instruments and just drama at any rate though rock band was very highly

01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:05.880
received for most of the American reviewers you didn't get a score under a

01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:12.360
nine on that scale or a five stars or an a so they were all very excellent won so

01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:18.080
many awards best multiplayer experience innovation awards across the board best

01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:25.960
music game and Xbox magazine said best reason to move to a bigger house award

01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:31.640
this I mean this game really was like it was just so like like transformative I

01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:35.560
mean between you really have to kind of co-credit this and like a tar hero and

01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:38.920
just you know with the whole like plastic instrument revolution and sure

01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:42.080
those of us that have been music game fans a little bit longer such as you

01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:46.040
know us here at OLR and some of our longtime listeners obviously we remember

01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:49.640
what was about guitar freaks and importing the stuff from Japan the beat

01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:53.360
media 2dx controllers and things like that but Konami and you know we talked

01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:57.680
about this ad nauseum in our first 180 episodes Konami was never willing to

01:32:57.680 --> 01:33:01.240
really take that risk with the US audiences until it was too late the

01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:04.000
Japanese arm of the company was too fucking stubborn even though the

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:07.920
American side was telling him do it do it do it they were too fucking stubborn

01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:11.400
until I think it was really too late to hit the momentum on that and then by the

01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:15.920
time they finally did get it on it it looked like a fucking knockoff of this

01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:19.840
because it was rock revolution when Konami finally got it was just a bad

01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:26.240
fucking version of this so you know it was it was really guitar hero 2 probably

01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:29.560
in many ways I would say and then like this as a definitely follow-up with

01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:33.400
charter 3 that really kind of like pushed that plastic instrument

01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:40.080
revolution and just started music gaming in the u.s. well there also did have

01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:46.720
effects on the actual music industry their Viacom was saying that it was

01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:52.480
averaging the sale of 1 million downloadable songs every nine days and

01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:58.520
for example Motley Crue's single Saints of Los Angeles debuted as a rock band

01:33:58.520 --> 01:34:06.280
track the same time that the album released some of the tracks that were

01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:11.720
specific to rock band actually ended up being later on we released for example

01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:16.880
Rush's alternate working man only which one of my favorite songs ever we

01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:21.360
actually like ran out of video and that was some guy playing a 10-minute song

01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:27.080
but in any way the alternate version of working man that was released only for

01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:33.400
rock band was so well loved that Rush released that version as a download

01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:39.000
through iTunes and started making some of their albums available like moving

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:45.840
pictures was was released in the game two months after all this so I really

01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:49.520
want to go back and play again on my Xbox one because I have rock band for on

01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:52.960
Xbox one but like I remember I was having a lot of problems getting the

01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:56.560
instruments connecting like weird shit was happening and I got so frustrated I

01:34:56.560 --> 01:35:00.840
just stopped but for me the real peak of the rock band series for me was rock

01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:04.480
band three because I love the keyboards I'm like the one person that loved the

01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:08.880
keyboards that was so awesome and I wish I wish the keyboard thing had taken off

01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:13.520
more mmm I was just reading about some of the litigation with Gibson guitar and

01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:23.520
Konami's lawsuit and everything oh sure yeah but I mean basically a Viacom did

01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:27.760
a counter suit against Konami saying that rock band improves on Konami's

01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:32.640
original patent and that rock revolution used controllers are similar

01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:38.120
to rock band so they both settled and there you go there you go I also want to

01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:42.320
give a shout out for rock band blitz I wish they had made that one backwards

01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:48.400
compatible 360 there's also mention of frets on fire oh yeah when the like a

01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:57.720
computer yeah and then of course we had you know coming out of

01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:01.720
that there was rock Smith to where you actually could play a real guitar that

01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:06.800
was much different it was but I don't know how much laid off the concept yeah

01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:10.120
I don't know how much I can say but I know somebody who worked on that game so

01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:15.600
and so do you know yeah I'm saying that I don't know that it would be out oh

01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:20.000
yes you're not for oh yeah definitely definitely like again it's all about

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:25.720
that risk right nobody would have taken a risk on a game like rock Smith if rock

01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:30.480
band and guitar hero too hadn't like put it out there there was that and I'm

01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:33.600
sure somebody asked that question well you know everybody's fake jam it why

01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:36.840
don't we teach people how to play a real guitar why we do this for real maybe

01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:40.520
there's a way and that's what rock Smith dead well and on top of that though in

01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:44.360
the later releases of rock band you had the pro modes where they had the

01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:47.520
guitars and the keyboard I love the cute because you really were playing the

01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:50.840
keyboard parts if you played it in pro yeah it's pretty cool yeah it was

01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:55.280
awesome but Bobby talking about rock band blitz they only had the music

01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:58.160
licenses for a couple years for the songs they ended up delisting rock band

01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:03.160
blitz it's I look Robin blitz was just it was all the DLC you already had for

01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:08.240
rock band but then you played it in like an amplitude kind of game and I loved it

01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:13.360
so cool so all right there it is your classic game of the week rock band one

01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:16.800
of the greatest all-time classics really especially for us music game fans love

01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:20.020
it that's the type of game that brought us all together and so I'm assuming were

01:37:20.020 --> 01:37:22.600
they playing this a California extreme did it get you kind of thing oh yeah you

01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:26.600
said they're playing on stage right yeah but I didn't play but you I saw it along

01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:33.640
with it though yeah because they you know started singing the cure I also did

01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:39.040
karaoke this last week cuz that's my fun stage I'm just singing it at the vendor

01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:44.080
booth no but I did real karaoke I met up with some of my friends in Chicago we

01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:48.760
went out to one of the bars for karaoke it was fun I was basically show me show

01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:53.520
me show me how you do that song that's one of my favorites but I was singing it

01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:57.960
over there and some kid was looking over just grinning it was pretty funny mm-hmm

01:37:57.960 --> 01:38:05.320
you were singing classic rock all right let's move on let's get into some rapid

01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:08.400
fire news and quickly travel around the world with some other headlines and

01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:12.840
what's going on in gaming so Loki won't start us off all right so we've got a

01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:18.240
couple things here so one it's a little bit of a preview of what we can expect

01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:23.520
from gamescom which is just around the corner supposed to take place on August

01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:28.080
20th through the 24th and thq Nordic is apparently gonna have some new games to

01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:33.320
announce as well as showing off some additional things including their remake

01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:38.400
for destroy all humans they also have a remake for spongebob squarepants battle

01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:43.600
for bikini bottom a rehydrated and apparently the strategy game of

01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:51.080
desperados 3 and Darksiders Genesis but they're supposed to be announcing also

01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:54.560
new games as well during that time so I guess we'll have to wait and see what

01:38:54.560 --> 01:38:58.760
that is thq Nordic I'm hoping that one of those is a no-saints program but you

01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:04.000
know I'm I'm highly skeptical that gonna be something in the same universe ages

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:09.400
of mayhem 2 yes that game really was not terrible enough and we have to make a

01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:14.400
sequel to make it even worse and then finally this is kind of cool grand theft

01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:21.800
auto 3 Liberty City may remember that game that's pretty old but now you can

01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:27.480
actually play in the Liberty City map from grand theft auto 3 in beam and G so

01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:33.040
for those not aware of what beam and G is it is a physics based driving game

01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:37.760
which basically you kind of do whatever you want in it but mostly it's to crash

01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:41.960
your car in very unique ways but now you can crash your car in very unique

01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:46.840
ways all over the map of grand theft auto 3 and it looks awesome and of

01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:52.000
course it's not something that you can necessarily download and via the

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:59.080
official like mod repositories but there's a thread in their forum on beam

01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:03.480
and g.com so go check it out there and it looks awesome I don't know if I don't

01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:07.400
think I have beam ng but I've seen lots of videos of people playing it I do want

01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:13.840
to probably pick it up now all right moving on to a hackers gonna hack story

01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:18.520
because we love these around here at olr this has to do with somebody getting

01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:22.480
Android running on the switch that's right XDA are the homebrew developers

01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:27.760
that have just released an Android firmware for the Nintendo switch it's a

01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:34.400
8-point Android 8.1 lineage OS 15.1 I don't I don't do enough Android no idea

01:40:34.400 --> 01:40:38.360
what that is um but I'm assuming just one of the operating systems one of the

01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:41.600
older ones probably not one of the newest ones and so compatible models

01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:45.360
will do it there are of course it's buggy it's got battery life issues some

01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:49.120
of the rotation some sensitive touchscreen input but everything in

01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:53.720
there otherwise would work so basically it will turn your switch into an Android

01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:56.880
tablet with a pair of controllers this is something you're basically flashing

01:40:56.880 --> 01:41:01.240
the firmware on your switch to be this so you're losing your Nintendo switch so

01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:06.200
you know only if you really really really are into fucking with your

01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:10.600
hardware do you want to do something like this apparently it is based on

01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:16.440
androids a division that works with the Nvidia shield TV so some things on the

01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:20.720
Tegra like Borderlands and Half-Life 2 will actually run on this not to say

01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:26.280
they run well but they run so very interesting with that that's a big big

01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:31.200
console mod going on there so yeah again I would not do this for shits and

01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:35.120
giggles unless you really know what you're doing with this type of modding

01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:39.440
because you're likely gonna lose access to being able to play Mario maker and

01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:45.320
things like that anyway let's talk about a story on Facebook instant games

01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:50.000
because they are going to be kind of going away kind of not really so instant

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:53.240
games on Facebook started in the newsfeed and then they went to groups and

01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:57.120
the light app and I believe they went into the messaging app you could play

01:41:57.120 --> 01:42:00.320
games like pac-man and stuff with friends I know I've done that before

01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:04.760
but not in a long time I think it was one of those things were like oh I

01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:07.520
played pac-man with somebody on messenger okay I'll never need to do

01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:11.040
that again in my entire life like I don't think I really got into the thing

01:42:11.040 --> 01:42:15.000
in the Facebook gaming thing was also a little weird to me because like oh you

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:19.220
can play these things on an app in your phone and most of them are just apps you

01:42:19.220 --> 01:42:23.080
can download on your phone and play there you know I mean if I wanted to

01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:28.520
play pac-man I could just download the pac-man app for my phone right but for

01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:31.480
whatever reason you know some people wanted to do the Facebook messenger

01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:35.640
gaming because excuse me probably some more of the social features and things

01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:40.620
like that well games are gonna be moving out of the messenger app they will be

01:42:40.620 --> 01:42:45.360
moving into the Facebook gaming tab global director of games partnerships

01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:51.000
Leo Aleb said quote starting later this summer instant games will no longer be

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:55.640
playable directly in the new version of messenger on iOS to ensure a smooth

01:42:55.640 --> 01:42:59.640
transition players and messenger will continue to access games through thread

01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:04.680
updates and chat bots while gameplay itself will app switch to Facebook quite

01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:11.400
honestly this all sounds terrible so I just is there a Facebook game I'm

01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:14.040
missing out on is there something I should be playing I don't know I blocked

01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:17.360
all of those notifications so probably not

01:43:17.360 --> 01:43:22.120
it's Farmville still a thing I don't know too I wonder if my ex is still

01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:26.640
jamming to the Farmville soundtrack all these years later I have no idea I don't

01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:32.120
know which one was this all right okay so and a pot of podcast listeners in

01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:35.960
chat want me to correct on the Android story apparently you are running it off

01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:41.000
a micro SD card you are not actually overriding your switch data I apologize

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:44.360
I must have misinterpreted because they were talking about that you may be kind

01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:47.320
of screwing up your system to be able to play some of the other games later on

01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:54.360
so I apologize if I misrepresented that but I I still would I still would

01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:58.080
venture with this shit with caution if you really want to run an Android thing

01:43:58.080 --> 01:44:01.920
how about you just buy an Android tablet they're not that expensive they're

01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:06.640
cheaper than a switch but that's but I also the earlier in the day or earlier

01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:10.480
in the show I said but isn't that reddit where everybody runs doom on all this

01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:18.480
different shit hilarious so I get the appeal I do I do anyway back to the

01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:24.320
Facebook story kaijuto says my ex loved that Facebook MMO game forgot the name

01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:26.880
of it Oh Farmville she had me in her auction

01:44:26.880 --> 01:44:33.480
room watching her watching her seller stuff it was fun metal man has them

01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:37.520
metal mayhem says I don't give two shits about Facebook games to be honest if I

01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:41.800
were to play a game it'd be one of my games from steam or good old games good

01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:46.640
plug so I think it's it's safe to say pixel shits will not be coming to

01:44:46.640 --> 01:44:50.040
Facebook Messenger or Facebook instant or whatever the fuck they're calling it

01:44:50.040 --> 01:44:55.480
now anytime soon anyway who wants to play games on Facebook anyway you know

01:44:55.480 --> 01:45:00.080
the only game I'm playing for a while mind games do you remember though that

01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:08.080
Sims on Facebook yes I vaguely played there what's right there was like a Sim

01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:13.360
and it was thing yeah like 2d and not 3d yeah no I totally remember it that thing

01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:17.640
was nuts that was yeah okay and then like this pet game but that those weren't

01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:21.480
like things within the app that was kind of the precursor that those games were

01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:26.200
also on Google Plus games when that one and only game I played on Facebook that

01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:32.560
I had to suffer through was a stupid goddamn garage sale game part of that

01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:36.760
fucking ready player one challenge that is the only fucking game I ever played

01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:40.320
on there and that was enough to sour me off of the whole fucking platform I

01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:43.800
remember that dark to see you says I was kind of addicted to the civilization

01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:46.520
port for a little while I remember that that's right there was like a

01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:50.800
civilization game on Facebook I did words with friends a lot yeah yeah sim

01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:57.240
social that was it pixel pockets anyway that's enough about that dark soccer

01:45:57.240 --> 01:46:01.560
what do you have for rapid-fire news certainly not pixel shit right now sorry

01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:07.920
why we are the original game that we got as monster rancher in Japan it was

01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:16.440
monster farm is getting a re-release in Japan the there is a teaser website up

01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:24.680
for it but koi Tecmo has released the thing on their Twitter and it's looking

01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:28.640
kind of cute you know it's funny is that I almost picked up a monster farm

01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:35.560
yesterday because I my I'd never played monster rancher so I was thinking about

01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:42.040
getting it but I didn't but there's in the translation of this hold on let me

01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:49.560
get the translation pulled up it says oh my god why is this being slow

01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:53.920
basically it's saying that it's going to be released on an unannounced platform

01:46:53.920 --> 01:47:01.360
in 2019 and they used the word high sheen which typically indicates a digital

01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:05.760
release so it could either be it's a digital only console PC title or

01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:13.480
smartphone so and then in other news that I don't know if this makes me

01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:20.200
excited it could but Sega of Japan has filed a trademark for Knights dream wheel

01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:24.760
thinking that it could be another game in the Knights franchise it would be

01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:30.320
really nice if it did but it didn't spell Knights with a special spelling of

01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:36.280
Knights so it could be something else but if it's a if it's a a new Knights

01:47:36.280 --> 01:47:39.840
game I would be quite happy I'm surprised that isn't something they've

01:47:39.840 --> 01:47:46.480
revisited recently why not we're getting a lot of the other stuff like we night

01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:50.280
there was a wee night's game I remember that a wee little night's game but yes

01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:53.200
there's that and then of course Panzer Dragoon I think is the other kind of big

01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:58.360
one that I remember at e3 this year is pretty big deal so it'd be cool yeah

01:47:58.360 --> 01:48:01.480
all right well let's move on and travel around the world and check out some

01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:05.400
release dates and some video games coming out soon near you not a whole lot

01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:09.800
this week we've got mutant year zero road to Eden deluxe edition on Nintendo

01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:17.960
switch oxygen not included on PC Mac and Linux Madden 20 Madden NFL 20 on PC

01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:24.080
PlayStation 4 and Xbox one the church in the darkness on PC Mac and Nintendo

01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:30.840
switch PlayStation 4 and Xbox one that's it all right let's travel to Japan right

01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:35.880
now get in the car let's go on the PlayStation 4 this week on August 1st we

01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:40.720
have a game called labyrinth life sadly I don't believe this game stars stars

01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:45.840
David Bowie I think it's probably an anime based game they talk about a faint

01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:51.320
in agony flowering system interesting but it already know right yeah and I

01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:54.880
guess it also does some rock-paper-scissors type of battle and oh

01:48:54.880 --> 01:48:59.160
it looks like you can change the bus sizes on your characters well that oh

01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:03.920
yeah I think yeah I've heard this was a game I think that was it's only wasn't

01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:09.360
bringing over to the West because of they had like some of these I don't know

01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:12.380
if this is the same game series but they had one where you basically have to

01:49:12.380 --> 01:49:17.440
breed these like princesses or whatever they rescue or something like that

01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:22.440
there's some weird shit now they all right well if labyrinth life is your

01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:27.280
thing you enjoy that it's this week um also coming out of Japan this week crash

01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:31.000
team racing nitro fueled gets its Japanese release I know we've had it

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:34.640
here for a little bit but is finally on its way out in Japan this week and if we

01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:39.040
want to go over to the Nintendo switch Oh mega labyrinth life comes out on the

01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:45.440
switch all right where you can make some Omega anyway also we've got a game

01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:50.680
called the same crash team racing is also out in Japan and the air conflicts

01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:55.360
collection gets a release on the switch this week and I feel like we just had

01:49:55.360 --> 01:50:00.400
no this is okay no this is not like an arcade shooter this is a game with air

01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:06.880
conflict secret wars and air conflicts Pacific carriers in one pack so if you

01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:12.480
are you know cuz the airplane simulator games are pretty popular overseas so if

01:50:12.520 --> 01:50:18.200
you want that you can have that dark Sakura how about the UK in the UK we

01:50:18.200 --> 01:50:24.800
don't really have very many either what is coming out on the 29th which is I

01:50:24.800 --> 01:50:31.080
guess already the 29th right now there is FIA European truck racing

01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:36.640
championship and there's mutant year zero Road to Eden the deluxe edition and

01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:43.560
then on August 1st is Madden NFL 20 so they go back to labyrinth life a little

01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:49.560
bit I just I'm just I'm just gonna read this one I mean basically you kind of

01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:53.000
get the gist of the game anyways but they said it apparently if you expand

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:58.880
your bus with every fallen foe mighty memories lead to great greater power

01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:03.120
defeating foes builds up your Omega power in the chest increasing bus size

01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:07.200
and parameters they go all the way to a Z cup this is a Nintendo switch game by

01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:18.760
the way and apparently is coming out in the u.s. on August 1st so that is that

01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:23.800
is another that is another game that is coming out is it really yes it is are

01:51:23.800 --> 01:51:28.720
you gonna do a let's play a live stream no it's 60 bucks not paying for that but

01:51:28.720 --> 01:51:39.880
Z cups Loki oh wow you know what what I think that that's so terrible that's not

01:51:39.880 --> 01:51:44.080
even funny anymore when I know people who have had breast reductions for that

01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:49.640
kind of pain that it would cause I don't think that a part of the body should be

01:51:49.640 --> 01:51:56.320
fetished I really don't I'm just getting so sick of it we're not objects all right

01:51:56.320 --> 01:52:01.240
I mean and I'm not saying it's right but are you really surprised I should be

01:52:01.240 --> 01:52:04.800
surprised is the thing I really should be surprised I don't even know what I'm

01:52:04.800 --> 01:52:09.720
looking at here we and I really don't want to know whether fictional or not

01:52:09.720 --> 01:52:14.200
bodies need to be respected it's just fucking stupid I don't know what that is

01:52:14.200 --> 01:52:20.800
not here to glorify your fucking hormones Bobby Black Wolf in chat says

01:52:20.800 --> 01:52:24.600
Nintendo is kitty because you know Nintendo is a kids company they only put

01:52:24.600 --> 01:52:31.240
out kids games we all know that's the case of course let's see yeah some folks

01:52:31.240 --> 01:52:37.240
in chat saying excuse me Z cup yeah anyway podculture says there is such a

01:52:37.240 --> 01:52:42.640
thing as too much of a good thing anyway let's move on can we please go to the

01:52:42.640 --> 01:52:46.600
mailbag so every week you guys email us participate at orange lounge radio.com

01:52:46.600 --> 01:52:51.640
and we read our favorite emails live on air did we get any emails this week um

01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:56.080
yeah we actually got a really interesting little email that apparently

01:52:56.080 --> 01:53:03.240
they recorded you masturbating Rob how does it go what important where you have

01:53:03.240 --> 01:53:09.440
been recorded masturbating and the M is an upside down W so it's a spam message

01:53:09.440 --> 01:53:13.360
this something yes okay been washed we have to reading wow I was

01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:21.600
waster baiting I'm not even opening it and of course I'd tell you the the from

01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:27.000
who is anonymous hacker okay anonymous hacker caught me waster baiting here

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:32.640
like here in the OLR studio or like somewhere else in the house like do they

01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:41.600
like was it was it professor plum in the conservatory with the Crisco

01:53:43.360 --> 01:53:47.920
I'm not gonna play this game anymore so that means since we got no real emails

01:53:47.920 --> 01:53:52.440
it's drag race talk what is there to talk about drag race drag race isn't on

01:53:52.440 --> 01:53:58.080
right now but I saw a funny meme okay this is every time a Republican is

01:53:58.080 --> 01:54:02.640
caught with another man a drag queen gets her heels oh because there's yet

01:54:02.640 --> 01:54:06.280
another one that got like was caught on Grindr or something yeah just today I

01:54:06.280 --> 01:54:13.240
was seeing that going around yeah it's like why be so hateful unless you just

01:54:13.280 --> 01:54:20.600
hate yourself mm-hmm just just get fucked in the ass you'll feel better no

01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:27.720
I'm serious all these closeted Republican shitholes now now we're gonna

01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:34.040
get another email about you beating off that Pikachu so please stop just hear me

01:54:34.040 --> 01:54:47.640
out hear me out this is why we don't have a lot of yours no no just just hear

01:54:47.640 --> 01:54:56.080
me out I don't think a man has to identify as gay to sometimes have gay

01:54:56.080 --> 01:55:01.200
moments you know you can be bisexual there's no problem with it being bi is

01:55:01.240 --> 01:55:06.760
valid but if you're this repressed you're this repressed because you've

01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:11.520
been denying yourself or you're doing it and you hate yourself just get fucked in

01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:16.600
the ass and be open about it stand up there and go you know what I like it I'm

01:55:16.600 --> 01:55:19.320
not gonna say it cuz someone's gonna clip me saying it and I don't like any

01:55:19.320 --> 01:55:30.280
of it but just say getting fucked in the ass is okay use your enema wear a condom

01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:38.120
and get fucked in the ass do it safely people who matter will not think any

01:55:38.120 --> 01:55:42.280
less of you for it welcome everybody to the voice of geeks Network where every

01:55:42.280 --> 01:55:48.840
geek has a voice dark soccer has chosen to use hers for a significant purpose

01:55:48.840 --> 01:55:56.000
tonight well honestly enough it's why I became a sister take the stigma out of

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:59.320
it the moment that no one gives a shit that you're getting fucked in the ass is

01:55:59.320 --> 01:56:05.720
the moment that you don't have to hide I mean fucking a people I'm I'm in super

01:56:05.720 --> 01:56:14.080
literally is what it is I'm just saying if people stopped having such a big

01:56:14.080 --> 01:56:21.760
conniption fit over it and just I'm gonna stop explaining it shouldn't have

01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:25.640
to be explained you if you like if you like it in the but you should be able to

01:56:25.640 --> 01:56:39.440
have it just saying what what back that ass up just saying Rob do you need

01:56:39.440 --> 01:56:51.600
another drink shall we all right so speaking of getting fucked in the ass

01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:58.000
Nintendo has been really hard on people not being able to upload lots of

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:02.600
different levels for Mario maker 2 and so because of that now they're gonna be

01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:07.560
increasing the cap from 32 to 64 and they said that also they're gonna be

01:57:07.560 --> 01:57:11.880
increasing that upload limit one more time so we don't know when that's gonna

01:57:11.880 --> 01:57:15.360
happen but sometime in the future you may be able to upload more than 64

01:57:15.360 --> 01:57:19.440
levels which I don't understand why they're limiting everybody to do that

01:57:19.440 --> 01:57:25.960
but just in case if you think that you know your levels being deleted because

01:57:25.960 --> 01:57:30.760
you may be doing some exploits in the game are safe offline you are sorely

01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:35.680
mistaken so apparently of course like the first Mario maker people have been

01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:39.360
exploiting different glitches in the game to do all sorts of crazy stuff one

01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:43.880
of these is actually how to create a black hole in Mario maker 2 which allows

01:57:43.880 --> 01:57:48.080
you to put objects on top of each other that aren't supposed to be layered that

01:57:48.080 --> 01:57:53.320
way so you can kind of create these really crazy fire bars and different

01:57:53.320 --> 01:58:02.600
overlapping terrain including pipes and whatnot have the moon appearing in

01:58:02.600 --> 01:58:06.920
daytime levels and all sorts of crazy stuff the game will know that you're

01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:09.680
doing that of course and it will actually say that corrupt data has been

01:58:09.680 --> 01:58:13.320
found in your course has been deleted or just won't let you save the game because

01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:18.560
there's corrupt data as well and so unfortunately you know those crazy

01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:22.160
levels that people might be able to make with these exploits aren't gonna be a

01:58:22.160 --> 01:58:31.800
thing because they have patched in ways to detect those which is unfortunate but

01:58:31.800 --> 01:58:37.560
hey you know the level caps gonna be up to 120 probably someday or more I don't

01:58:37.560 --> 01:58:40.440
know why there's even a cap on the number of levels you can put out there

01:58:40.440 --> 01:58:44.320
anyways who cares like you can't tell me people that would just upload

01:58:44.320 --> 01:58:50.160
garbage but how are you gonna discover that garbage I guess it gets thrown into

01:58:50.160 --> 01:58:54.240
your feet or whatever but like the level size the download of that I mean the

01:58:54.240 --> 01:58:58.080
storage space has got to be so minimal I can't imagine why we would even limit

01:58:58.080 --> 01:59:01.440
that stuff little big planet doesn't do that and you can do all sorts of crazy

01:59:01.440 --> 01:59:07.880
shit in that why why even limit Mario maker I don't know that's the thing you

01:59:07.880 --> 01:59:10.920
haven't picked up Mario maker too yet have you I have are you making any

01:59:10.920 --> 01:59:15.040
levels um I haven't gotten to play it yet because my kids have been playing it

01:59:15.040 --> 01:59:18.160
I haven't made any levels yet that's the one thing I'm missing so I should have

01:59:18.160 --> 01:59:20.880
I should have tried like making a level one on the airplane but I just I

01:59:20.880 --> 01:59:26.800
probably will at some point mm-hmm all right anyway Bobby with the clerk's

01:59:26.800 --> 01:59:35.120
jokes in there we have 37 viewers in a row anyway

01:59:35.120 --> 01:59:40.040
moving on maybe something you want to make in Mario maker is your own pole

01:59:40.040 --> 01:59:43.360
position inspired level I don't know I had no other transition and I figure it

01:59:43.360 --> 01:59:47.880
was better than the last one pole position somebody has remade this in 3d

01:59:47.880 --> 01:59:55.880
yeah I saw that yeah and they Rob what's wrong because I was about to read the

01:59:55.880 --> 02:00:06.120
name of it and you know it's called hmm PP engine yes pole position engine so

02:00:06.120 --> 02:00:11.880
it's a it's a PP engine is a three-year Rob definitely needs an adult this

02:00:11.880 --> 02:00:16.840
episode yeah you know Bobby said try not to

02:00:16.840 --> 02:00:22.240
masturbate on your way to the car on my way to playing some PP engine which is

02:00:22.240 --> 02:00:29.040
a 3d remake of the night it's a 3d remake of the 1982 game pole position

02:00:29.040 --> 02:00:33.440
Rob can't even which is what your PP stands for but it actually reverse

02:00:33.440 --> 02:00:39.720
engineers all of the games code so it's actually following basically what you

02:00:39.720 --> 02:00:44.320
would expect the cars and the AI to do but it's modern high-definition graphics

02:00:44.320 --> 02:00:49.520
as in crashing every time you get on a curve yeah yes and all the all the like

02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:54.040
lame-looking billboards that go by and the little explosions and all of that

02:00:54.040 --> 02:00:59.480
yeah Jonathan Thomas on reddit said I started back in 2013 my god that's six

02:00:59.480 --> 02:01:03.320
years ago reverse some people do podcasts for 17 years some people spent

02:01:03.320 --> 02:01:07.760
six years on their PP engine I started back in 2013 reverse engineering the

02:01:07.760 --> 02:01:11.400
code from the original arcade ROM with the help of the main debugger and some

02:01:11.400 --> 02:01:15.480
primitive self-made tools to analyze instruction traces and create assembly

02:01:15.480 --> 02:01:18.680
source files that could be assembled back into the original arcade ROM

02:01:18.680 --> 02:01:21.720
following this I worked through the assembly source file to produce a

02:01:21.720 --> 02:01:25.600
portable c-based library containing the game logic for pole position this

02:01:25.600 --> 02:01:29.560
library was used in two projects the one you see here and another project to

02:01:29.560 --> 02:01:34.400
convert pole pole position to the Atari st a 16-bit computer that was released

02:01:34.400 --> 02:01:40.800
in 1985 I mean this is like on one hand I'm like what a colossal waste of time

02:01:40.800 --> 02:01:44.440
but on the other hand I'm like this is actually like really cool it's like the

02:01:44.440 --> 02:01:50.000
most authentic way to remake like an old game but just like put new graphics

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:54.040
on it like they they didn't just like remake it with new programming languages

02:01:54.040 --> 02:01:58.000
that emulated like I thought that they went in and like did it from the code so

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:01.840
that's that's pretty cool now you actually don't you have a pole position

02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:05.320
cabinet or you did like that became your main cabinet or am I mixing it up with

02:02:05.320 --> 02:02:08.960
something yeah we had a pole position and sure me moved into it remember mm-hmm

02:02:08.960 --> 02:02:12.560
because it was missing the pedal so sure me decided it was her new cat mansion

02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:17.160
mm-hmm but yeah we put a meme in that at one time and then I don't remember we

02:02:17.160 --> 02:02:22.240
sold it and then did other things now Bobby Blackwell would like to point out

02:02:22.240 --> 02:02:28.000
in our chat room at least he completed his racing game unlike some people well

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:37.800
took him six years to do it I got time all right anyway let's move on we have a

02:02:37.800 --> 02:02:41.120
few more stories for you guys and then we're gonna get to our discord segment

02:02:41.120 --> 02:02:43.960
which I think I accidentally left off the show role but we will get to

02:02:43.960 --> 02:02:48.800
discord if you want to give us a call over at vog network or vognetwork.com

02:02:48.800 --> 02:02:52.360
slash discord but first dark soccer I think you have another kind of like

02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:56.800
video game study thing I do because I like to bring something about science

02:02:56.800 --> 02:03:01.920
into this but there is a game called driving XC which you can find at

02:03:01.920 --> 02:03:08.920
driving XC calm for $39 it's available also as a digital download for I guess

02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:16.120
they mean Xbox one and ps4 but it's a game that helps new drivers learn how to

02:03:16.120 --> 02:03:23.400
drive and on top of that in one of the interviews on here the father of the teen

02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:29.040
says it's actually helped him become a better driver that after having pay

02:03:29.040 --> 02:03:33.640
attention you know to watching his daughter play it that he started

02:03:33.640 --> 02:03:38.640
becoming a more careful driver so basically it's drivers ed the game and

02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:43.960
the guy behind it is named Bob Davis he was making the large-scale car

02:03:43.960 --> 02:03:48.200
simulators like you did you ever have the simulators in your high school for

02:03:48.200 --> 02:03:56.520
drivers ed no we had that use like a film strip to drive with and the

02:03:56.520 --> 02:03:59.920
simulators were terrible this is like also like from the 60s it was pretty bad

02:04:00.120 --> 02:04:05.680
but this guy's been making the simulator since 2005 and so his driving

02:04:05.680 --> 02:04:13.120
essentials is to help be an interactive driving simulator for teens that they

02:04:13.120 --> 02:04:18.040
could do on their own and so it's actually apparently been helping kids

02:04:18.040 --> 02:04:21.560
learn to drive better as ten different lessons starting with the basics and

02:04:21.560 --> 02:04:27.360
take you through different driving scenarios so that it gives you you know

02:04:27.360 --> 02:04:31.840
it makes you more aware when you're ready for your driving test and there's

02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:36.760
even a level where you have a phone and it forces you to look at it so you can

02:04:36.760 --> 02:04:40.680
see what distracted right distracted driving can do is even if you're at a

02:04:40.680 --> 02:04:46.840
stoplight looking at your phone can still cause an accident so just saying

02:04:46.840 --> 02:04:52.000
it's really really good way to get people prepared and like I said her dad

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:56.120
said that it was really making him a more conscious driver too and you can

02:04:56.120 --> 02:05:03.880
get this at driving X e.com interesting you think they're using video games and

02:05:03.880 --> 02:05:06.760
more and more in the driver's ed type stuff I don't remember why we didn't do

02:05:06.760 --> 02:05:10.360
that type of stuff I feel like I feel like we were all prepping to take a test

02:05:10.360 --> 02:05:14.080
and it's like you took that test so that you could take like basically you take a

02:05:14.080 --> 02:05:19.120
driver's ed course through a private thing at 15 and a half I think or some

02:05:19.120 --> 02:05:22.320
like that was when you could do that the only thing is that it uses a standard

02:05:22.320 --> 02:05:26.640
controller wheels and pedals are not supported but I think they should put in

02:05:26.640 --> 02:05:31.480
driving wheel support you know because that's gonna just even add to the

02:05:31.480 --> 02:05:36.160
experience I'm interesting perspective from dark Tetsuya in our chat room over

02:05:36.160 --> 02:05:40.360
twitch TV slash vog network saying the doctors were convinced I shouldn't drive

02:05:40.360 --> 02:05:44.560
so I've just been using video games to live vicariously very interesting

02:05:44.560 --> 02:05:49.000
perspective there because you know some of us may not realize that oh yeah some

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:52.600
people aren't able to drive whether it's due to a medical issue a vision

02:05:52.600 --> 02:05:56.720
issue you know whatever it is but when it comes to video games where you know

02:05:56.720 --> 02:05:59.680
it's a it's a it's a controlled environment a fake environment not not

02:05:59.680 --> 02:06:04.160
the real world you kind of get to you know experience that in a different way

02:06:04.160 --> 02:06:07.800
and as much as we've been having a laugh at pole position and the acronyms later

02:06:07.800 --> 02:06:12.600
or acronyms that come from it you know maybe that was the realistic simulator

02:06:12.600 --> 02:06:17.160
in 1982 but certainly now today the technologies come so far that when you

02:06:17.160 --> 02:06:21.280
play a game like a Gran Turismo or something it's it's so realistic you

02:06:21.280 --> 02:06:26.780
know well I'll tell you I actually learned because I hadn't driven in a

02:06:26.780 --> 02:06:32.560
while but I learned about over steering from playing Ridge Racer so just saying

02:06:32.560 --> 02:06:40.200
you know I learned how to steer myself out of a drift in other games so you

02:06:40.200 --> 02:06:45.200
know just applying some of the technique I mean yeah and I'd say you know

02:06:45.200 --> 02:06:52.160
improving your hand-eye coordination too is also helpful so you know it's

02:06:52.160 --> 02:06:55.440
funny Bobby Black Wolf I guess did some research into the pole position thing

02:06:55.440 --> 02:06:59.000
turns out that game was either that little reimagine he hasn't been working

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:02.560
out for six years because that originally came out in January 2014 it's

02:07:02.560 --> 02:07:05.160
just making its way around the gaming blogs again this week for whatever

02:07:05.160 --> 02:07:08.720
reason whether it be to do a reddit post or something like that as these things

02:07:08.720 --> 02:07:12.920
sometimes happen but you know here at OLR it's about what is out there in

02:07:12.920 --> 02:07:15.960
gaming culture and if something gets rediscovered and is new all over again

02:07:15.960 --> 02:07:21.080
it still qualifies so I mean I I had no idea it was a thing so it's still kind

02:07:21.080 --> 02:07:27.920
of new maybe in 2019 they'll update it for VR who knows so anyhow let's move on

02:07:27.920 --> 02:07:32.680
Loki story from you all right so it's another week so we have yet another

02:07:32.680 --> 02:07:39.840
story of a epic epic game store exclusive so mech warrior 5 unfortunately

02:07:39.840 --> 02:07:46.440
is being delayed it's now set for December of this year and it will be

02:07:46.440 --> 02:07:52.800
epic game store exclusive as well so piranha games put out a press release

02:07:52.800 --> 02:07:56.840
saying our partnership with epic game store allows piranha the opportunity to

02:07:56.840 --> 02:08:00.680
make sure mech warrior 5 mercenaries meets our internal goal of creating the

02:08:00.680 --> 02:08:05.360
best mech warrior game possible we want more money since we since we announced

02:08:05.560 --> 02:08:11.240
the development of the first player mech war game in 17 years we have stated that

02:08:11.240 --> 02:08:15.760
our goal was to deliver to fans mech warrior mercenaries experience with true

02:08:15.760 --> 02:08:20.240
freedom of choice and being able to share that experience in a co-op setting

02:08:20.240 --> 02:08:27.800
by true freedom of choice we do not mean storefronts of course so yeah it was

02:08:27.800 --> 02:08:33.000
originally supposed to be coming out sooner and apparently though with that

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:37.240
if you had pre-ordered the game you will be able to request a full refund up

02:08:37.240 --> 02:08:43.160
until September 1st hmm well so at least they're gonna do the refund thing that

02:08:43.160 --> 02:08:45.880
as I'm sure some other recent controversies like Shenmue and all that

02:08:45.880 --> 02:08:50.680
stuff the one that gets me though is the whole Tetris effect being exclusive on

02:08:50.680 --> 02:08:53.720
the epic store but then if you want to play it in VR you have to have steam

02:08:53.720 --> 02:08:57.000
because I don't think that is a requirement anymore for like the audience

02:08:57.000 --> 02:09:01.520
Oculus version or something like that oh I thought it only went with the vibe and

02:09:01.520 --> 02:09:04.960
so you had to have steam VR in order to be able to run yeah but yeah that is

02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:08.880
funny this is kind of like one of those like this is it's really weird type of

02:09:08.880 --> 02:09:13.480
thing yeah maybe it just also goes to show that you also maybe don't just

02:09:13.480 --> 02:09:18.960
think of steam as a store I guess steam is I guess more than that at this point

02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:23.360
now with the whole you know fact that there's maybe our drivers in it maybe it

02:09:23.360 --> 02:09:27.320
shouldn't you know I don't know and Bobby says the oculus version runs steam

02:09:27.320 --> 02:09:31.360
VR they didn't make it specifically for oculus last I checked steam VR runs on

02:09:31.360 --> 02:09:35.320
oculus so they just did a one-size-fits-all hmm so yeah it's kind of

02:09:35.320 --> 02:09:38.640
kind of interesting I mean I don't know like I kind of want to get Tetris effect

02:09:38.640 --> 02:09:42.800
on PC but I I already have it on PlayStation I want to be able to play it

02:09:42.800 --> 02:09:47.160
on like 4k though I think that seems like really cool but like I just feel

02:09:47.160 --> 02:09:50.880
like nothing's gonna top the VR version I might wait for a sale I think that's

02:09:50.880 --> 02:09:53.840
what I'll probably and ultimately end up doing but I do love Tetris effect that

02:09:53.840 --> 02:09:57.560
game is so good if you guys haven't played it yet so good so but I just

02:09:57.560 --> 02:10:02.480
don't see myself jumping into PC VR anytime soon I don't like I'm not the

02:10:02.480 --> 02:10:06.240
level of enthusiasts that you know Bobby or even maybe Kai's you know or some

02:10:06.240 --> 02:10:11.240
other of you guys that love your VR are at I'm kind of like I got PS VR it plays

02:10:11.240 --> 02:10:14.440
enough it suits my needs I'm good for now I'm looking forward to the no man

02:10:14.440 --> 02:10:18.680
sky thing which um you know cuz that's gonna get VR pretty soon I'm excited I

02:10:18.680 --> 02:10:22.520
thought it already happened it's like any day now the beyond updates gonna be

02:10:22.520 --> 02:10:26.300
out which I'm speaking what good timing hey Alan can I bug you to come on the

02:10:26.300 --> 02:10:31.940
show please Alan is in this new pocket hi can you come on the show will you

02:10:31.940 --> 02:10:37.260
come on the show yeah cuz I literally just brought something up that is kind

02:10:37.260 --> 02:10:41.940
of like relevant to you and what you're doing um you've been playing a game a

02:10:41.940 --> 02:10:45.220
lot recently we tell us the viewers a little bit about what you've been up to

02:10:45.220 --> 02:10:52.220
I've been playing a lot of No Man's Sky I just wanted to see what the mod

02:10:52.260 --> 02:10:57.780
community had done with it in addition to the updates that well apparently

02:10:57.780 --> 02:11:01.780
unless this guy's completely full of shit was one mod that I'm using called

02:11:01.780 --> 02:11:06.460
fantasy a lot of his work has actually been incorporated like he has a credit

02:11:06.460 --> 02:11:11.380
in some of the patches because hello games has used his stuff he made a mod

02:11:11.380 --> 02:11:16.420
to where you find a ruin and then if you use the thing that lets you dig into the

02:11:16.420 --> 02:11:20.420
earth there's actually like like kind of like archaeology where you go under the

02:11:20.420 --> 02:11:23.780
ground it's not just to find minerals but there's things you can find to sell

02:11:23.780 --> 02:11:28.220
that are actually under that's a part of the base game now and he made a mod to

02:11:28.220 --> 02:11:33.460
do that originally so I was out of town last week obviously on a business trip

02:11:33.460 --> 02:11:38.100
so how many hours would you say you plants spent playing No Man's Sky where

02:11:38.100 --> 02:11:44.500
I wouldn't be here to judge you I've started over a few times I would say

02:11:44.500 --> 02:11:49.380
from the time you left I would say around 15 or 16 hours over the course of

02:11:49.380 --> 02:11:53.260
the week so it's two or three hours a night I can't judge ask me how many

02:11:53.260 --> 02:12:03.660
hours I've been on call for my larp so it's fine yeah well I still haven't

02:12:03.660 --> 02:12:15.220
tried rez VR and you own that it's in the living room I just knew he'd been

02:12:15.220 --> 02:12:20.340
playing No Man's Sky lately and it was kind of relevant so I didn't even think

02:12:20.340 --> 02:12:23.260
about the modding community and what modding is probably done to that game on

02:12:23.260 --> 02:12:30.700
PC I bet it's something so that's cool all right anyhow let's move on oh no I

02:12:30.700 --> 02:12:33.860
want to say one more thing about the mech warrior thing so you're into like

02:12:33.860 --> 02:12:37.260
the mech games is this something you're thinking about um yeah probably not

02:12:37.260 --> 02:12:41.300
going to I used to play the like one of the mech warrior games a while back but

02:12:41.500 --> 02:12:47.220
I've kind of got him out of it all right well you know I love these little mini

02:12:47.220 --> 02:12:50.900
arcade cabinets that I have right in fact some of them are actually branded

02:12:50.900 --> 02:12:55.620
the whole my arcade thing and I think there's one over there this burger time

02:12:55.620 --> 02:12:59.940
one which isn't on cam but I'll go grab it here this burger time one is a my

02:12:59.940 --> 02:13:04.860
arcade machine and they're actually putting out a new version of this so

02:13:04.860 --> 02:13:07.980
there's gonna be something like this but I think it's gonna be a little bit

02:13:07.980 --> 02:13:11.060
bigger and for those these are the ones that they have I think a target target

02:13:11.060 --> 02:13:15.020
is where you can get these the my arcade things so actually and I should

02:13:15.020 --> 02:13:20.260
try turning it on so you guys can really see what this looks like if I can

02:13:20.260 --> 02:13:23.300
remember oh no the whole the whole bottom is the whole little like on

02:13:23.300 --> 02:13:29.700
switch and then hopefully it'll come on here and mm-hmm so sorry I'm starting it

02:13:29.700 --> 02:13:32.480
up here trying to show the folks on Twitch what it looks like but it's a

02:13:32.480 --> 02:13:36.820
pretty it's a pretty faithful reinterpretation of like burger time a

02:13:36.820 --> 02:13:42.700
lot of them are our console versions yeah they really are yeah so I think of

02:13:42.700 --> 02:13:46.020
this like Coleco or I think it's probably a little beyond that actually I

02:13:46.020 --> 02:13:51.900
know that the the Cubert one was very similar to the Coleco version with a

02:13:51.900 --> 02:13:58.620
few little bit of graphical tweaks mm-hmm so this same company the my arcade

02:13:58.620 --> 02:14:02.860
is going to be putting out a Namco museum mini player it's going to have

02:14:02.860 --> 02:14:08.980
20 different games on it including you know you would expect pac-man pac-man 2

02:14:08.980 --> 02:14:12.980
pac-mania but also some other interesting selections including dragon

02:14:12.980 --> 02:14:17.380
spirit that one's pretty cool rolling thunder all three of them splatter house

02:14:17.380 --> 02:14:20.460
both of those games so it's kind of interesting a little bit of a diverse

02:14:20.460 --> 02:14:24.260
selection from Namco the screen on that it's going to be four and a quarter

02:14:24.260 --> 02:14:28.140
inches so I think that's a bit larger it's probably twice the size of what I

02:14:28.140 --> 02:14:32.820
just showed mm-hmm on the twitch stream so it's a lot larger and it has but it's

02:14:32.820 --> 02:14:36.620
a more vertical screen so it will kind of be more like an iPhone type of shape

02:14:36.620 --> 02:14:40.620
or an Android you know more like the vertical shape but at the four and a

02:14:40.620 --> 02:14:44.420
quarter inches so it's gonna have 20 games in it and it's going to retail I

02:14:44.420 --> 02:14:50.580
believe for $99.99 and it's on its way out right now you can get it on Amazon

02:14:50.580 --> 02:14:55.380
and my arcade calm it is kind of expensive I mean well if you think about

02:14:55.380 --> 02:14:59.500
that that little burger time thing I just showed on cam that was about 35 I

02:14:59.500 --> 02:15:06.620
want to say maybe 30 no I think it was 30 and then the Walmart ones which is a

02:15:06.620 --> 02:15:11.460
different series those are arcade classics those set me back about 20 a

02:15:11.460 --> 02:15:16.240
pop so but I do think I do think that my arcade ones they're little you can see

02:15:16.240 --> 02:15:19.820
they're a little fancier they're a little sturdier the screens a slight bit

02:15:19.820 --> 02:15:23.380
bigger I think they're a slight better quality it's not that the arcade classic

02:15:23.380 --> 02:15:26.780
ones are bad they're really not they're good too but I think the my arcade ones

02:15:26.780 --> 02:15:28.900
are definitely like a better quality so it's interesting that they're kind of

02:15:28.900 --> 02:15:33.260
taking this one step further with this Namco museum collection but you know

02:15:33.260 --> 02:15:36.340
these things are these these retro collections and things are really

02:15:36.340 --> 02:15:41.980
everywhere so now Tigerclaw points out some of the my arcade little cabinets

02:15:41.980 --> 02:15:45.340
have a bunch of games on them and they're mostly ripoff games I think that

02:15:45.340 --> 02:15:49.220
a stranger things thing we saw recently which had come up on the show yeah it's

02:15:49.220 --> 02:15:54.700
one of those examples too and that one was a little bit cheap looking um metal

02:15:54.700 --> 02:15:58.500
mayhem says is there any device out there where pac-man hasn't appeared on

02:15:58.500 --> 02:16:02.100
by this point well if it wasn't on there voluntarily I'm sure somebody put it on

02:16:02.100 --> 02:16:11.260
there for sure so anyway yeah so that's it my arcade of Namco museum I I'm

02:16:11.260 --> 02:16:14.460
interested but I a hundred bucks is a lot of money especially for the retro

02:16:14.460 --> 02:16:17.960
stuff but I want to get more of the little cabinets the single game

02:16:17.960 --> 02:16:22.360
cabinets I love that there's stuff like wreck-it Ralph or I'm sorry fix-it Felix

02:16:22.360 --> 02:16:25.160
is the game obviously wreck-it Ralph inspired I love that that is where he

02:16:25.160 --> 02:16:29.880
needs his own game he does like along the lines of rampage mm-hmm and there's

02:16:29.880 --> 02:16:32.600
another what there was another one that was like 70 bucks I saw a target that

02:16:32.600 --> 02:16:35.440
had a bunch of stuff in it I think this might be the one Tigerclaws linking with

02:16:35.440 --> 02:16:38.880
bad dudes and there's other stuff in there too that's it was like a Data East

02:16:38.880 --> 02:16:41.420
collection yeah it's a Data East collection is exactly what it is and I

02:16:41.420 --> 02:16:43.920
think bad dudes is kind of like the one that they put on the box because that's

02:16:43.920 --> 02:16:48.360
one of the most recognizable games in it I still I still kind of want one of

02:16:48.360 --> 02:16:51.760
those arcade 1up machines I still feel like that might be a thing I end up

02:16:51.760 --> 02:16:55.600
getting myself for the holidays because I know one of our friends star soccer I

02:16:55.600 --> 02:16:59.880
got one of those Star Wars ones over the weekend or at least ordered it and I

02:16:59.880 --> 02:17:02.800
know they were talking in chat there might be other people interested in

02:17:02.800 --> 02:17:08.440
getting the Star Wars one so yeah those things those things look really cool so

02:17:08.440 --> 02:17:13.400
all right well at this point we are going to open up our discord for you

02:17:13.400 --> 02:17:18.520

we're making sure none of that toxicity makes it here to our little program so

02:17:45.640 --> 02:17:50.200
our best we can I'm sure we can't avoid everything completely anyway let's get

02:17:50.200 --> 02:17:52.840
to it I see somebody just joined the green room and we haven't had a call in

02:17:52.840 --> 02:17:56.480
a while so let's get to it hi you are on orange launch radio who's this hey

02:17:56.480 --> 02:17:59.920
what's going on everyone it's wrong though hey Rama is great to hear from

02:17:59.920 --> 02:18:04.120
you what's on your mind tonight not much is great to hear you guys to see you

02:18:04.120 --> 02:18:09.360
guys every week well hello hello to what to what you want to talk about tonight

02:18:09.360 --> 02:18:13.640
all right so it was a couple things I want to talk about but I could save that

02:18:13.640 --> 02:18:19.320
for another time but anything I want to talk about in regards to Nintendo

02:18:19.320 --> 02:18:26.240
patching out Kristin Aussie's voice in Fire Emblem yeah what about that well I

02:18:26.240 --> 02:18:32.400
will say this I mean it's no secret that I've been part of the anime cosplay

02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:37.440
fandom for about 20 years and several of those years I've gotten friendly with

02:18:37.480 --> 02:18:45.560
various voice actors and the sad part is his actions it's sort of been like sort

02:18:45.560 --> 02:18:51.200
of not documented but well known it's like people around him knew this and the

02:18:51.200 --> 02:18:56.800
thing is it just takes something big for everybody to come out of the woodwork to

02:18:56.800 --> 02:19:04.600
point fingers at him for his actions now I do not condone what he did but I do

02:19:04.600 --> 02:19:12.440
respect him in the way that he is going to do his best to make amends I look at

02:19:12.440 --> 02:19:19.320
it this way um if you if you make mistakes it's up to you to own up and

02:19:19.320 --> 02:19:24.600
redeem yourself so others can see it you've become a better person yeah I

02:19:24.600 --> 02:19:29.200
think part of you know fixing mistakes though is kind of like accepting the

02:19:29.200 --> 02:19:35.440
punishment like you know you did the crime do the time sort of thing right so

02:19:35.440 --> 02:19:39.840
I mean I and I think this whole removal and and and shaming and so forth is kind

02:19:39.840 --> 02:19:45.280
of a part of that it's true and I said this may have killed his career but

02:19:45.280 --> 02:19:51.400
given how he made this long apology now it's not the first time I've seen

02:19:51.400 --> 02:19:55.240
something like this right now there's something big going on in a community

02:19:55.240 --> 02:20:02.040
with a million dollar lawsuit we'll just leave that that but if he's being

02:20:02.040 --> 02:20:06.000
sincere about his actions and you know what he's he should get a second chance

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:11.400
if he's just saying it just to cover himself and save faith then you know

02:20:11.400 --> 02:20:18.760
what you're done right no I and I can I can be open to that you know if you know

02:20:18.760 --> 02:20:21.520
kind of accept the consequences which it sounds like you know I'm not following

02:20:21.720 --> 02:20:25.440
this guy probably as closely but if he is accepting the consequences and doing

02:20:25.440 --> 02:20:30.880
that and trying to be better from it then you know the whole idea of

02:20:30.880 --> 02:20:34.920
rehabilitation is the first place is to get better and do better so as long as

02:20:34.920 --> 02:20:40.080
the actions show that a person is doing better then I think there's room to

02:20:40.080 --> 02:20:46.880
forgive that I guess or you know except that a person can change absolutely it's

02:20:46.880 --> 02:20:52.640
just sad that it things like this come out this way it's like you make it big

02:20:52.640 --> 02:20:58.320
then somebody from your past reminds you of something shitty you've done and you

02:20:58.320 --> 02:21:03.160
never owned up to it it's sort of like the whole James Gunn thing with Guardians

02:21:03.160 --> 02:21:07.840
of the Galaxy that he's owned up to what he's done frequently and then it keeps

02:21:07.840 --> 02:21:15.280
coming back and he end up losing his job now he has his job back you know one I

02:21:15.280 --> 02:21:17.800
think a lot of that was about how he kind of played that out in the public

02:21:17.800 --> 02:21:24.400
eye too you know and that's why he's kind of back doing the film again so

02:21:24.400 --> 02:21:28.320
interesting it has is he a big and I'm sorry I might have missed this is he big

02:21:28.320 --> 02:21:31.280
in that like anime scene does he do voices there too is that how you kind of

02:21:31.280 --> 02:21:37.960
know a little more about this yeah one of the voices he's known for is he is

02:21:37.960 --> 02:21:45.920
Helios in Sailor Moon supers which is produced by this interesting okay didn't

02:21:45.920 --> 02:21:51.720
know that you might know him by his alternate name on YouTube kerboffer I

02:21:51.720 --> 02:21:57.200
don't watch enough YouTube stuff to know he's done various voices and then been

02:21:57.200 --> 02:22:02.000
in backgrounds and various like tracks and stuff like that so I swear I kind of

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:06.600
know him so interesting all right well before I let you go anything else you

02:22:06.600 --> 02:22:11.480
want to talk about tonight if I'm looking at the couch correctly do I see

02:22:11.480 --> 02:22:16.760
a reference to the Golden Girls between Loki and Pikachu you do this is actually

02:22:16.760 --> 02:22:21.600
a calendar that Loki got for Christmas and if you've been watching if you've

02:22:21.600 --> 02:22:25.200
been paying attention on the stream we have updated it every month with the

02:22:25.200 --> 02:22:30.160
latest month that we're on so this is July's picture which is again for the

02:22:30.160 --> 02:22:33.480
sake of the podcast listeners I'm describing it a little bit it is Sophia

02:22:33.640 --> 02:22:38.640
cooking up a dish and Blanche is looking on at it and the quote says if this

02:22:38.640 --> 02:22:42.920
sauce were a person I'd get naked and make love to it and that was a Sophia

02:22:42.920 --> 02:22:50.360
quote there you go I watched every single episode of that show when it was

02:22:50.360 --> 02:22:54.960
on the air it's great I know a lot of like bros who watch Golden Girls it's

02:22:54.960 --> 02:23:02.160
it's it's funny for everybody yes yes cuz let's be real most was watched it

02:23:02.160 --> 02:23:08.720
for be Arthur anyway I always loved Betty White even at a young age so but

02:23:08.720 --> 02:23:12.520
yes of course of course be Arthur I mean they were all great in their own ways so

02:23:12.520 --> 02:23:16.680
it's interesting though how much merchandise and shit there is now with

02:23:16.680 --> 02:23:27.120
all that be Arthur I'm on my wine break yes one of my favorite try to bullshit

02:23:27.120 --> 02:23:32.840
one of my favorite be Arthur moments was from the Golden Girls and I just

02:23:32.840 --> 02:23:35.760
will never forget this one is that you know where I think it's Betty White says

02:23:35.760 --> 02:23:40.160
and where are you going and she goes to get ice cream or commit a felony I'm

02:23:40.160 --> 02:23:43.160
gonna decide in the car

02:23:44.840 --> 02:23:51.240
Blanche about homophobia oh yeah there's that yeah condoms rose condoms

02:23:51.240 --> 02:24:00.000
condoms condoms yeah it was amazing moment too I remember it Sicily Golden

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:04.280
Girls are great on a future episode of olr we were just going to act out scenes

02:24:04.280 --> 02:24:07.920
from the Golden Girls so I don't know what part Loki's gonna play but we'll

02:24:07.920 --> 02:24:11.800
figure that out I think I think Loki kind of would be the Dorothy in this

02:24:11.800 --> 02:24:19.980
situation I really do I'm definitely the Blanche probably of this group I think

02:24:19.980 --> 02:24:26.700
our soccer would be Sophia you know what just go to SDCC and cosplay as the

02:24:26.700 --> 02:24:30.900
Golden Girls and I'll stand behind you with a boom box playing to sound playing

02:24:30.900 --> 02:24:35.620
at the theme song you would dark soccer you would definitely the one be the one

02:24:35.620 --> 02:24:44.220
that would be like picture it Namco arcade mobile 1996 and then not give a

02:24:44.220 --> 02:24:52.020
shit yes I'd say the dry things absolutely all right anyway all right

02:24:52.020 --> 02:24:54.340
I'm gonna let you go Rama so we can squeeze in another call but they walk

02:24:54.340 --> 02:24:59.860
out with my with my Walker good to hear it was always my friend right back at

02:24:59.860 --> 02:25:04.340
you all right bye all right let's get to another call here on the show hello

02:25:04.340 --> 02:25:07.620
you're on orange launch radio who's this

02:25:07.820 --> 02:25:12.780
hello no hello hey this is that deaf sorry I had my

02:25:12.780 --> 02:25:16.860
mute on that's okay sometimes I know we surprise you when we drag and drop you

02:25:16.860 --> 02:25:20.740
on air what's on your mind tonight well I want to talk about something that

02:25:20.740 --> 02:25:30.100
happened Mexico this week involving eSports a little back of a little

02:25:30.100 --> 02:25:37.380
backstory there's this Federation eSports Federation in Mexico that was

02:25:37.780 --> 02:25:45.540
initiated back in February if I remember correctly so it's like okay a big deal

02:25:45.540 --> 02:25:51.940
so we can have like national teams support for for the eSports community

02:25:51.940 --> 02:25:58.900
here in Mexico all good fast forward to this week they're starting their their

02:25:58.900 --> 02:26:06.140
tournaments they're starting out to scout for national team members and they

02:26:06.140 --> 02:26:15.820
start charging the around 600 pesos which is around I think let me get my

02:26:15.820 --> 02:26:22.700
calculations almost correctly like $30 which isn't much but right the thing is

02:26:22.700 --> 02:26:29.660
they are affiliated with the National Sports Committee in Mexico so they are

02:26:29.660 --> 02:26:37.620
a civil association they cannot profit of any tournament or anything an event

02:26:37.620 --> 02:26:46.220
they they're doing so it's like a really really bad situation for them and in in

02:26:46.220 --> 02:26:50.140
especially because one of the tournaments they were they are holding

02:26:50.140 --> 02:26:57.460
is for clash of clans or one one of the mobile games and supercell the developer

02:26:57.580 --> 02:27:04.100
came out on Twitter and told them hey hey guys you cannot charge any any

02:27:04.100 --> 02:27:11.340
amount of money for any of the participants so it yeah it was a really

02:27:11.340 --> 02:27:17.580
really big deal this week in Mexico because of that and and actually one of

02:27:17.580 --> 02:27:23.420
the under of the people one of the heads of famous which was just called came out

02:27:23.420 --> 02:27:29.300
and said that yeah they didn't like expected this to happen because they do

02:27:29.300 --> 02:27:35.380
need the money they they do have to pay for the train training for the for the

02:27:35.380 --> 02:27:40.660
participants if they get selected they have to pay the trips they have to pay

02:27:40.660 --> 02:27:44.940
everything involved for for the making of these tournaments so it's

02:27:44.940 --> 02:27:51.660
understandable but they should have like came out of upfront about it it's like

02:27:51.700 --> 02:27:55.980
the many people here and including myself we're kind of disappointed on

02:27:55.980 --> 02:28:03.300
that and how they handle it because it's like really really like shady stuff be

02:28:03.300 --> 02:28:11.140
all behind all I have talked about already where they try to make I was

02:28:11.140 --> 02:28:16.380
just saying were they trying to make a claim about where the money was going at

02:28:16.380 --> 02:28:20.260
the start when they actually announced the tournaments and all that stuff they

02:28:20.260 --> 02:28:27.700
just they just said you have to be affiliated with them with famous and you

02:28:27.700 --> 02:28:33.660
have to pay the 600 pesos they didn't say why they didn't say like oh we need

02:28:33.660 --> 02:28:39.260
this to pay for for all the events and in all that all the other stuff that is

02:28:39.260 --> 02:28:44.940
needed which is understandable but again they weren't clear about it and it was

02:28:44.940 --> 02:28:51.220
like until like a few days ago I think Friday that an article popped out in an

02:28:51.220 --> 02:28:56.580
interview they they made what up with a website here in Mexico that actually

02:28:56.580 --> 02:29:01.980
like explain all that but again it's like way too late and many people are

02:29:01.980 --> 02:29:08.460
like actually mad legit mad about it so it's understand again it's understandable

02:29:08.460 --> 02:29:13.220
why they did it but they should have like been clear about it from the

02:29:13.220 --> 02:29:16.380
beginning yeah especially when like the developers are probably sitting here

02:29:16.380 --> 02:29:19.420
thinking these folks that are completely unaffiliated with us are making money

02:29:19.420 --> 02:29:22.900
off of our games using our games in the promotion using our games to attract

02:29:22.900 --> 02:29:26.340
people and then they're charging this fee for them and even if the fee is you

02:29:26.340 --> 02:29:30.060
know pretty nominal you know three bucks is not a whole lot of money it's cheaper

02:29:30.060 --> 02:29:33.500
than a grande at Starbucks and all is said and done but it's it's the

02:29:33.500 --> 02:29:41.740
principle yeah actually $30 I think but again not not that big of a deal with

02:29:41.740 --> 02:29:47.340
with the money involved but it's the thing that yeah even they got in trouble

02:29:47.340 --> 02:29:51.980
kind of in trouble with supercell which is again the developer they came out and

02:29:51.980 --> 02:29:57.020
you cannot charge these official rules for any official tournament it's like

02:29:57.020 --> 02:30:03.740
you cannot charge any participant at all even like even if there's like an an

02:30:03.740 --> 02:30:09.660
entry fee for the venue you cannot charge them that yeah it's a free entry

02:30:09.660 --> 02:30:14.900
for any participant and they're also involved with overwatch not necessarily

02:30:14.900 --> 02:30:18.860
League but the World Cup and also other games like the League of Legends and

02:30:18.860 --> 02:30:26.660
others other games that are going like they have a World Cup basically huh

02:30:26.660 --> 02:30:30.260
interesting well I'll be curious to kind of see if there's more that develops on

02:30:30.260 --> 02:30:33.660
this if more companies kind of come out against it or if you know these guys

02:30:33.660 --> 02:30:38.540
kind of reverse course on that or give a little more clarity to where these this

02:30:38.540 --> 02:30:41.580
money is why they're collecting it where it's going or if they suddenly

02:30:41.580 --> 02:30:44.300
make a big charitable donation or I'll be curious to kind of see where this

02:30:44.300 --> 02:30:51.980
ends up yeah me too actually because again it I actually want to for them to

02:30:51.980 --> 02:31:00.500
like do do good do better actually yeah because they're trying to get like games

02:31:00.500 --> 02:31:07.260
officially recognized by the the International Olympics Committee they're

02:31:07.260 --> 02:31:14.660
working really hard on it and but like this this kind of stuff is like kind of

02:31:14.660 --> 02:31:20.220
disappointing if anything for sure for sure all right my friend I'm gonna let

02:31:20.220 --> 02:31:24.180
you go so we wrap up the show but thank you thank you for the news from a place

02:31:24.180 --> 02:31:28.100
we are you know an area where we aren't always paying attention all the time so

02:31:28.100 --> 02:31:31.980
it's nice to hear from news from around the world hey thanks for having me good

02:31:31.980 --> 02:31:37.820
like always no problem take care my friend yeah all right well there you go

02:31:37.820 --> 02:31:42.340
that that's gonna do it I think for the call tonight which means we are about

02:31:42.340 --> 02:31:45.980
oops I almost closed OBS I'm going to close discord we are about to the end of

02:31:45.980 --> 02:31:49.680
another episode of orange lounge radio not bad for a week of news that was a

02:31:49.680 --> 02:31:52.340
little bit slower although I should check in make sure we're low-key there's

02:31:52.340 --> 02:31:55.860
no last-minute stories there's just one last thing I was gonna mention so the

02:31:55.860 --> 02:31:59.940
Epic Games Store put out some new free games for the month and one of those was

02:31:59.940 --> 02:32:03.500
a game called moon lighter which apparently someone spotted that there

02:32:03.500 --> 02:32:09.140
was the enable cloud save function and which they'd come in that on Twitter

02:32:09.140 --> 02:32:13.500
and Tim Sweeney responded with we've actually enabled cloud saves for a

02:32:13.500 --> 02:32:17.140
couple of games right now but they'll be rolling out more so it's another

02:32:17.140 --> 02:32:20.940
enhancement that they're finally adding to their storefront that they really

02:32:20.940 --> 02:32:24.620
should have tried it for a while yeah something to try to kind of maybe

02:32:24.620 --> 02:32:28.020
justify a lot more of those exclusives they're snapping up when people don't

02:32:28.020 --> 02:32:30.680
really want to use their store so interesting interesting we'll see what

02:32:30.680 --> 02:32:35.100
develops of that all right well we are gonna wrap up for the night I'm gonna

02:32:35.100 --> 02:32:38.460
say as I always do thank you for tuning in and spending your night with us here

02:32:38.460 --> 02:32:41.900

02:32:41.900 --> 02:32:45.020
heard here at orange launch radio please tell a friend or two about the show help

02:32:45.020 --> 02:32:47.740

02:32:47.740 --> 02:32:51.220
every gamer has a voice but if the voices aren't here to air then what are

02:32:51.220 --> 02:32:56.420
we gonna do so please tell a friend or two about the show and you know a nice

02:32:56.420 --> 02:33:02.780
five-star review on a place like iTunes goes an awful long way also you can do

02:33:02.780 --> 02:33:08.920
these auto hosts of vog network over on your twitch channel and whether you have

02:33:08.920 --> 02:33:13.380
a hundred followers or one follower that stuff goes a long way towards

02:33:13.380 --> 02:33:16.300
discoverability so please consider putting us on your auto host list that

02:33:16.300 --> 02:33:21.420
would be fantastic otherwise I think I think that's all I've got to say and I

02:33:21.420 --> 02:33:24.360
think we're ready to go around and get everybody's final thoughts we will be

02:33:24.360 --> 02:33:28.000
back in seven days to do this all over again Bobby black wolf who airs live

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:32.080
before us at a voice keys Network will not be live next week he is off to a

02:33:32.080 --> 02:33:37.200
convention called Gen Con which is very big on the board games I know so I'm

02:33:37.200 --> 02:33:39.840
hoping he will get some video even if it's board games I'm sure he'll bring

02:33:39.840 --> 02:33:42.980
back some video and I would think somewhere in that building there's some

02:33:42.980 --> 02:33:46.000
video game representation so he'll probably get a little bit of that so

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:51.560
yeah there's gonna be that and yeah we look forward to seeing you guys next

02:33:51.560 --> 02:33:57.080
week we will still be here on orange lounge radio at that time so dark soccer

02:33:57.080 --> 02:33:59.800

02:34:17.040 --> 02:34:21.200
question I asked was you know our bling-blank wasn't there were they yeah

02:34:21.200 --> 02:34:25.120

at any rate at any rate we need more than your thoughts and prayers keep them

02:34:37.160 --> 02:34:45.440
