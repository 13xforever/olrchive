7000	14000	These are hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	27000	This week in the lull of the holidays, a few longer form articles are able to bubble up to the top of the collected news chamber. Take a breath and enjoy the brisk pace of tonight's stories. The news that we could find starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
28000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	48000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 783 for this July the 7th of 2019. There's a reason I don't tell you, DarkSakura, about those parodies.
48000	51000	You are absolutely terrible.
52000	59000	Hi, I'm Rob Roberts and joining me in the studio is the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers, off cam because she wants to be.
59000	61000	I think I just lost my shit.
61000	77000	I just had a moment, a brainstorm. So for those who don't get it, if you're listening on the podcast, when we do the thing on Twitch, and I think I've mentioned this before, we kind of like borrowed an idea from You Can't Do That on Television that they also do on Dragon Con TV where they do these parody intros.
77000	87000	So it's like so and so will not be seen tonight. And so what we did is we did, and I don't know why I thought of it, but I was just because I was actually trying to think of Fourth of July related things like America related games.
87000	94000	But for some reason, Neopets came to my mind is like a good old American game and I was like, Neopets Cemetery.
94000	101000	So there you go. There it is. And then voiceover Jason guy said that was the best one yet out of the how many weeks have we been on Twitch about a half year now.
102000	115000	That was the best one yet. So I don't know. Do you guys agree? Tell us in the chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network.
115000	123000	More info at vognetwork.com. Again, I'm Rob Roberts. She's Dark Soccer or Jamie Summers. And he over right there is Techmaster Loki.
123000	124000	Yes, I am.
124000	125000	How are you?
125000	126000	I'm fine.
126000	130000	Good. And I noticed tonight and the folks on Twitch can maybe see this behind your laptop. You're wearing a Keanu Reeves shirt.
130000	131000	I am wearing a Keanu Reeves shirt.
131000	133000	Is that inspired by cyberpunk?
133000	134000	It is a cyberpunk thing.
134000	135000	Interesting.
135000	136000	It says we have a city to burn.
136000	138000	Boy, they were quick on getting that merch out, weren't they?
138000	141000	Wrong. Someone was quick to knock that shit off.
141000	143000	Oh, it's a Redbubble type thing?
143000	150000	It's from QWERTY. I buy a lot of shirts from them. Not sponsored. I wish I was because then shirts would be cheaper.
150000	155000	No, it's from QWERTY and I love it. It's awesome.
155000	160000	It's great. Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, such a breathtaking shirt.
160000	161000	It is. It really is.
161000	164000	It is breathtaking, yes. Your wardrobe is very breathtaking.
164000	171000	So we have a random question at Starsoft tonight. Why not? I mean, we have gaming news to talk about. Don't get me wrong.
171000	177000	We're going to have a fun show tonight, but it's been a little slower because 4th of July, Canada Day, all in the same week.
177000	185000	North American studios probably aren't as busy. We're still kind of basking in all the info we got at E3.
185000	188000	So it slowed down a little bit this week. So I'm all for a random question.
188000	193000	So the question we get from Questbuster, random question for pinball lovers at OLR.
193000	199000	If you had a chance to visit the Pinball Hall of Fame in Vegas, is there a special machine there you would want to play?
199000	201000	I went there. I talked about it in a previous show.
201000	202000	I've been there.
202000	205000	Yeah. But what do you want to go back and play?
205000	210000	It's my tradition. The first machine I'm always going to play at a show like that is Elvira.
210000	214000	Either table. Scared Stiff or I think just the Mistress of the Dark is the other one.
214000	218000	Even though I didn't have the most fun time playing it, I still want to play the pinball circus.
218000	223000	But another one I would love is if they had actually a bride of pinball 2.0.
223000	225000	No, have you played bride of pinball 2.0?
225000	227000	No, because that was not the one at your house, right?
227000	229000	We had a bride of pinball for a while.
229000	230000	Yeah, she had a bride of pinball.
230000	231000	We borrowed a 2.0.
231000	233000	Okay, I think I might have played it. I think I might have played it when you had it.
233000	236000	Because it's the one that had like, it sounded like the Space Mountain, the old Space Mountain soundtrack.
236000	237000	Yes.
237000	242000	And it had like voices in different modes and it was all LED and had a new DMD and everything.
242000	249000	It was really fun, but I mean, of course there's other classics, although I did get one of my favorites.
249000	251000	I own it now, finally. Black Rose.
251000	252000	Oh, nice.
252000	255000	Dan has been putting his heart into it.
255000	256000	Oh, that's great.
256000	257000	Yeah, I'll do more on that for my game.
257000	259000	But you still have your World Cup Soccer 94, right?
259000	261000	That's the one he's like never allowed to get rid of, right?
261000	264000	Well, yeah, although I was planning on selling it to Melody.
264000	266000	If I was going to sell it to anyone, it would be to Melody.
266000	268000	Right, because then you'd at least know it's a good home.
268000	269000	Because then I could get it back.
269000	271000	Yeah, and you kind of know where it is.
271000	274000	And the same thing goes for my Theater of Magic.
274000	278000	If anyone's going to buy theater, if I'm selling it to anybody, it'll be Melody.
278000	283000	I do think when Alan and I work out some of our financial stuff and we're able to get a house,
283000	287000	I do think I want a Baby Pac-Man machine and I want an Elvira machine.
287000	290000	Because I know Alan would be on board for an Elvira machine because he loves Elvira.
290000	292000	We could probably lend you some of ours, too.
292000	293000	That would be awesome.
293000	294000	How about you?
294000	295000	When's your house?
295000	297000	Well, I was going to say, when's your house turning into an arcade?
297000	298000	But you're starting.
298000	299000	You've got the DDR machine.
299000	301000	I don't have enough room for anything.
301000	306000	I couldn't put anything in there other than the DDR and the candy cap.
306000	310000	But now we're getting to that point of the year where I doubt you're going to be in there playing DDR very often
310000	312000	because it's getting really hard, right?
312000	314000	Well, I don't know.
314000	315000	Maybe.
315000	320000	I got stuff to start running now, so I'm going to start running in 100 degree weather.
320000	321000	Yeesh.
321000	325000	I know it sounds as terrible as I think it's going to be, but I'm going to do it anyway.
325000	328000	If you go out at like seven or eight, it's really not that bad.
328000	330000	No, this is going to be like one or two.
330000	331000	Oh, then you're crazy.
331000	332000	Funny you mentioned that.
332000	335000	I'm actually considering doing couch to 5K.
335000	339000	So I was going to do that maybe.
339000	343000	And then I just need more workout stuff anyway, so it was fine.
343000	349000	I go out ever since Harry Potter Woo, Wizard Unite Woo, ever since Harry Potter Woo came out,
349000	354000	I've been kind of going down to this park not far from me, and Alan will come with, too.
354000	358000	We finally got him suckered into Harry Potter, so he's playing that, too.
358000	359000	We'll walk around the park.
359000	361000	The temperature is really nice at seven, eight o'clock.
361000	363000	It's just a little walk and a little exercise.
363000	364000	Yeah, we'll see.
364000	365000	I don't know.
365000	367000	I can always play later.
367000	369000	So, pinball tables.
369000	380000	I didn't really play a lot of pinball, so I would say probably Abs Family and probably Attack on Mars, I think.
380000	382000	I remember when that was new.
382000	384000	That technology and that machine was really awesome.
384000	387000	You're talking about the remake, not the original.
387000	388000	Yeah, the remake.
388000	389000	Yeah, the remake where you actually have the hologram.
389000	391000	What did they call it? Pinball 2000 or something?
391000	392000	Yeah.
392000	393000	Where you had the little holographic images in there.
393000	394000	It was pretty cool.
394000	396000	Yeah, I'd probably do that.
396000	397000	Awesome.
397000	400000	All right, well, let's get into our official kickoff tonight.
400000	402000	But if you have further questions, why not?
402000	407000	You can always jump into twitch.tv slash vognetwork or vognetwork and ask away.
407000	412000	I'd be happy to answer questions as long as they're not too crazy.
412000	417000	But I thought for our kickoff tonight, again, the news has been a little bit slower, so I don't have this gigantic headline.
417000	420000	But I thought we could kind of reminisce a little bit about controllers
420000	424000	and specifically talking about an article that's been going around online about Nintendo
424000	429000	and some of the comments they made about controllers at the 79th annual general meeting of shareholders.
429000	433000	And the question that was posed, it was question number 13 during this whole thing,
433000	439000	said, looking at this year's E3, it seems like the mainstream for video games is the same as it has been for the past 30 years,
439000	443000	namely looking at the screen and playing with controller in hand.
443000	446000	How do developers regard this and do they think it will continue?
446000	450000	And there's several answers in here. I want to read a couple of them here.
450000	453000	Takahashi said, we are always dreaming of new things.
453000	456000	For example, 1-2 Switch, the first game released for Switch.
456000	461000	We suggested that people could play not by looking at each other or by looking at each other and not at the screen.
461000	466000	And for VR, we thought about how we could change not just the controller but also the gameplay
466000	469000	and came up with the Nintendo Labo Toy-Con 04 VR kit.
469000	472000	He then talks a little bit more about E3.
472000	478000	Miyamoto says, Nintendo was the first to create the style of playing video games with a plus-shaped directional pad
478000	481000	and additional buttons, which has now become the industry standard.
481000	486000	True point. It was also Nintendo that changed the original plus-shaped directional pad,
486000	494000	which operated digitally in eight directions, into the first analog input device that moves freely in all directions for Nintendo 64.
494000	496000	This, too, is now common.
496000	500000	But I feel like PlayStation was kind of doing that. No, because the DualShock was later, wasn't it?
500000	505000	So they didn't have the analogs right away. Okay, then never mind. They get to claim that, too.
505000	510000	We are proud to have created a variety of user interfaces that have now become industry standards.
510000	516000	And as of now, in terms of accuracy and reliability, I believe this style is the clear winner.
516000	518000	Here's where the answer gets more interesting.
518000	525000	At the same time, I also believe we should quickly graduate from the current controller and we are attempting all kinds of things.
525000	529000	Our objective is to achieve an interface that surpasses the current controller,
529000	534000	where what the player does is directly reflected on the screen and the user can clearly feel the result.
534000	539000	This has not been achieved yet. We've tried all kinds of motion controllers, but none seem to work for people.
539000	543000	I don't know if I agree with him saying none worked for people, because the Wii was huge.
543000	548000	And a lot of that was because of the motion control, even though, sure, it wasn't super accurate in the beginning.
548000	553000	They ended up having to do the Wii Motion Plus. I still feel like that changed gaming in many ways.
553000	560000	It did, but it's also, you have to use it in a meaningful way, just like how he was talking about 1-2 Switch and stuff like that.
560000	563000	Arguably, 1-2 Switch is not a good game.
563000	565000	It's a mini-game collection.
565000	576000	It's a neat, like, this should have been packed in with the game system, but I don't think it's anything that I would be heralding.
576000	580000	I mean, the VR stuff is kind of alright.
580000	587000	They definitely have, any of the Labo stuff, they've had unique ways that they've used the Joy-Cons, so props there.
587000	594000	But a lot of that, though, you're not going to really see that being used outside of just that piece of software.
595000	601000	So I think that's kind of the problem. Like, you have all these cool features that you built in, but really everybody's kind of using it in one way.
601000	608000	And then he continues to say, and as the company that knows the most about controllers, we've been striving to create a controller that can be used with ease,
608000	611000	and that will become the standard for the next generation.
611000	619000	So I kind of, like, ask you guys, do you think that we're going to be stuck in this directional pad, analog button type of controller for forever?
619000	623000	Or do you think that game controllers and the way we play our games could change in the future?
623000	625000	While you stew on that, let me get some other comments here.
625000	631000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, we rejected motion controls and Kinect controls.
631000	641000	I sort of get where that comment comes from, especially when it comes to Kinect, where Kinect was huge and then died off once everybody got sick of dance games and exercise games, right?
641000	647000	They couldn't figure out really, I mean, even though they tried these other wild things like the Kinect Disneyland and stuff like that, nothing ever really took.
647000	650000	In the game sense, we all know Kinect works.
650000	659000	It wasn't good enough yet for any of that. It's like the idea was a good idea, but the execution of it wasn't to where they wanted it to be,
659000	665000	and where it just didn't work as if they, you know, for some things like the dancing games and stuff, that was okay.
665000	671000	But it's very limited on what you could do with it, because space-wise, you need to have a certain amount of space.
671000	677000	The sensitivity on it wasn't that great. It was just kind of wonky.
677000	681000	But I wouldn't say that motion controls are dead, because, I mean, look at VR.
681000	690000	VR, you typically just use motion controllers, and those are probably better than a lot of the motion controllers that we're talking about here.
690000	698000	So I think it could progress in that sense, but I think it would be more useful in scenarios that involve VR.
698000	703000	Right, and I was going to say, I think motion controls specifically, like, okay, maybe they're not the king anymore,
703000	708000	especially since the Wii has kind of sunset, and even though the Switch does have some motion elements in it,
708000	716000	I think they end up kind of being the little sideshow to the main games that people just want to sit on their couch and kind of play, right?
716000	722000	But when it comes to things like VR, I think motion control still is very much like a thing.
722000	730000	It might not be the top thing, but a game like Beat Saber, you know, Beat Saber works because of its unique control mechanism.
730000	736000	And admittedly, it's kind of an anomaly. It's not the norm, but it's a hell of an anomaly, right?
736000	742000	And I think there are still other games to kind of find in that space, especially as VR is kind of finding itself,
742000	749000	and that killer must-have game and app that makes everybody want to jump into VR,
749000	754000	just like the Wii Tennis was probably arguably that thing that really brought people into wanting to play that.
755000	762000	So you think motion controls are probably not necessarily the future completely?
762000	767000	No, I don't think they're the future. I think that they're not dead.
767000	772000	I think that that's going to be probably something that we go towards,
772000	778000	but what we have now is more sophisticated than they were doing.
778000	782000	Even PlayStation Move is very kind of bare bones,
782000	787000	and I'm surprised that we're still using that now. It's so old at this point.
787000	791000	It works pretty well, though. For Beat Saber and stuff, it's good enough.
791000	794000	It's okay for what it is, but it could be so much better.
794000	798000	But some of those controllers for the VR stuff, like the Oculus controller,
798000	804000	or no, the Vive one with those little spaceships on the hand, those are pretty cool.
804000	811000	And they feel really... I love the haptic feedback is probably my favorite thing that controllers do in this day and age, that type of stuff.
811000	813000	So it's interesting to see where that goes from there.
813000	820000	But looking back on some of the controllers over the generations we've had of gaming,
820000	824000	what was the one you wish we were still playing games on?
824000	829000	Unless you feel that the Xbox One controller or PlayStation 4 is as good as it gets or Switch,
829000	832000	what's the one controller you wish we were still playing our games on?
832000	837000	And Dark Soccer, you're the classic gaming connoisseur of this show, so I'll start with you.
837000	841000	The Sega analog controller, the camera for the Saturn. Best controller ever.
841000	844000	Just saying. Best controller ever.
844000	845000	Why?
845000	847000	Because it's comfortable. Fuck.
847000	851000	I mean, seriously, it sat in my hands so comfortably because I could hold...
851000	854000	Hold on, I'm going to have to use my phone. Let me show you.
854000	857000	Okay, so she's taking out her phone and kind of... Oh, okay.
857000	862000	So she's showing on the Twitch cam how she can kind of like hold it in the back of her hands and use her thumbs.
862000	863000	Yeah, I got it.
863000	867000	Exactly. So, because it had those kind of grippy things in the back, not quite like...
867000	872000	And the Dreamcast had a very similar controller to it. It was based off of the analog controller.
872000	880000	And, I mean, honestly, I also really liked the NEGICON.
880000	886000	Because the twist controllers made it really good for racing games and it just felt really natural.
886000	889000	I also imagine, ergonomically, you could do some pretty cool things to that too.
889000	895000	Exactly. I mean, those are two among them. Of course, I mean, even though they were specialized, I wish there had been more games that supported the twin stakes.
895000	905000	I'm just going to say the gun cons because I'm in some serious need of some more point blank.
905000	908000	So, yeah, the gun cons.
908000	910000	Get you a CRT.
910000	916000	They have new guns that work with LCD panels, but...
917000	922000	All of my gun cons. What was the Sega one? Not for the Master System, but the...
922000	923000	The Menacer?
923000	926000	The Menacer. Yeah, not the Menacer. It was like another one.
926000	932000	But anyway, we've got so many gun controllers at my house that we pretty much have to keep our CRT.
932000	934000	I love it.
934000	936000	We got a Wega for 20 bucks.
936000	941000	You kind of referenced it, but I would honestly say the Dreamcast controller was really one of my all-time favorites.
941000	942000	Yes, it was the Justifier.
942000	950000	And what made the Dreamcast controller amazing, not just the fact that it felt rock solid with its D-pad and all the things,
950000	953000	but the fact that that VMU kind of sat in there.
953000	958000	And for those that maybe weren't around during the Dreamcast days, of course, the VMU was like this...
958000	963000	It was kind of like the technology you would see in an old-ass Tamagotchi, like a very bare-bones kind of screen.
963000	966000	But you would put it in there and it would kind of interface with your game.
966000	970000	That technology was just ahead of its time. It was just ahead of its time. It was so cool.
970000	972000	The VMUs, you could connect to each other.
972000	973000	Yeah.
973000	976000	For little versus tiny games or trading, like for Chao trading?
976000	977000	Yeah.
977000	978000	In Sonic Adventure?
978000	979000	Mm-hmm.
979000	983000	It was. And then Sony had to rip it off with the PocketStation.
983000	986000	But not in America. That PocketStation never came out here, so...
986000	989000	I don't know where mine is, and I'm very sad.
989000	992000	A number of American games did support PocketStation.
992000	993000	Yeah, Final Fantasy 7 or 8 was one of them.
993000	994000	Yep.
994000	995000	Yeah.
995000	996000	8.
996000	997000	It was 8.
997000	998000	Yeah, and those things were cool.
998000	1000000	And you know what's interesting? I kind of always go...
1000000	1006000	I love the idea of a video screen on your controller.
1006000	1009000	Maybe not. I know that kind of conjures the image of the Wii U.
1009000	1010000	Maybe not on that level.
1010000	1013000	It's funny that you say that, because I think that's what the Amico has.
1013000	1018000	Well, I was going to say that, is that actually that's one of the things I find fascinating about the Amico,
1018000	1022000	especially considering its low cost, like how it's going to do that.
1022000	1024000	I'm really wanting to see how that looks in motion.
1024000	1026000	Well, LCD panels are really cheap.
1026000	1031000	I guess that's true. In this day, it used to be those things would be the most expensive part,
1031000	1034000	but now, even just a few years ago, back when the Wii U first came out,
1034000	1037000	the cost of those controllers, they didn't sell them separately,
1037000	1040000	because the entire cost of the system was in that controller.
1040000	1041000	You know what I mean?
1041000	1042000	Yeah.
1042000	1044000	I think we have two Steel Battalion controllers now.
1044000	1047000	Well, that's a whole other thing.
1047000	1052000	We're talking about it in chat, about how SH-100 Matt said we need more Steel Battalion games
1052000	1054000	as an excuse to play those into its controller.
1054000	1057000	They had a second Steel Battalion game. It was not good.
1057000	1063000	But could you imagine, what was that mech game that we used to play at Dave & Buster's?
1063000	1067000	It was like a Robotech game, wasn't it? Or BattleTech.
1067000	1072000	Could you imagine them doing a BattleTech game in that series and using that controller?
1072000	1075000	Yeah. The virtual world pods or whatever.
1075000	1076000	Yeah.
1076000	1080000	And it's funny, because Bobby says, look at your stream deck that you're using, and that's right.
1080000	1084000	I'd use one of those little stream decks that has all the little buttons on it,
1084000	1087000	and it's great for doing the broadcasting. You're right. It's a little LED thing.
1087000	1090000	But, I mean, this guy was like $99.
1090000	1093000	But, of course, I bought it when it was a new thing.
1093000	1097000	These are probably already coming down in price, because now I'm seeing the ads for the stream deck XL.
1097000	1100000	Yeah, it's ridiculously huge. I've seen that.
1100000	1102000	This is plenty enough for what we're doing here.
1102000	1108000	If you're going to do that, like the XL, just buy another keyboard to dedicate directly to hotkeys.
1108000	1109000	I mean, seriously.
1109000	1112000	Yeah. I know. I know. This is really cool, though.
1112000	1117000	The thing about the stream deck is that I can also see exactly how many people are on Twitch right now
1117000	1119000	without having to go look at another window.
1119000	1123000	That's the stuff I like, is the information that delivers right to the screen.
1123000	1125000	I can see at a glance if the mics are on or off.
1125000	1128000	Doesn't mean I always get it right, because I don't always remember to look.
1128000	1131000	But, for the most part, I can see really at a glance.
1131000	1135000	That's some of the stuff I like. Information in front of my face.
1135000	1140000	To tie it back to the controllers, I think that's why I always liked the VMUs
1140000	1142000	and that concept of a little mini screen on your controller,
1142000	1146000	is information right in front of your face that maybe is not necessarily something
1146000	1149000	that would then get in the way of the interface in the game or what have you.
1149000	1152000	I'm really curious to see what the Amico does with that whole thing.
1152000	1158000	I think AR stuff is going to really push what we do with controllers at some point,
1158000	1160000	once that becomes more mainstream.
1161000	1166000	That's true. Things like HoloLens. The HoloLens isn't a gaming thing.
1166000	1168000	No, it's just stuff like it.
1168000	1172000	It's a matter of time before the price to do something like that.
1172000	1174000	It's price and performance.
1174000	1178000	As that stuff gets smaller and more powerful, it's just going to be eventually rebuilt.
1178000	1180000	Somebody's going to want to try to make it a gaming thing.
1180000	1182000	Even if maybe it's not in the cards right now.
1182000	1187000	Somebody's going to want to try to make a Google Glass or HoloLens type thing a gaming thing.
1188000	1189000	We'll see.
1190000	1193000	Imagine if you could play Pokemon Go and you put these little glasses on.
1193000	1195000	You actually see the Pokemon.
1195000	1199000	Obviously, that desire is there because you're using your phone.
1199000	1201000	You don't have it up here.
1201000	1203000	You're just using your phone as that type of thing right now.
1203000	1207000	I feel like that's where some games want to go with all that.
1209000	1212000	Any other comments on controllers or the future?
1212000	1213000	All that?
1213000	1215000	We invite your emails on the subject as well.
1215000	1218000	Participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
1218000	1221000	For now, we'll go into a segment that we do every week here on the show.
1221000	1225000	Where we talk a little bit about the types of video games that we have been playing this week.
1225000	1227000	In a segment called, How Was Your Gaming Week?
1227000	1230000	DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?
1230000	1232000	Black Rose. Dan has finally got it working.
1232000	1234000	I play tested it a little bit.
1234000	1239000	We also finally got all of the shards in Bloodstained.
1239000	1241000	Got the ending.
1241000	1244000	I'm very sad about one of my favorite characters in it.
1244000	1247000	Who I won't say what happens to him since people are still playing it.
1247000	1250000	Although, I will say this.
1250000	1255000	If you check out all the books and finally get the final book, you have to fight O.D.
1255000	1259000	He's like, I told you to bring back my books, bitch.
1259000	1262000	This is a library, not a bookstore.
1262000	1266000	And of course, the voice actor was Alucard.
1266000	1269000	Alucard's voice actor in the U.S. also found out.
1269000	1271000	Japanese voice actor. It was him too.
1271000	1279000	If you beat O.D. and it is a bitch of a fight, go back and look at him in his bookstore.
1279000	1281000	He is pissed.
1281000	1284000	It's just worth it. Absolutely worth it.
1284000	1287000	I'm doing Animal Crossing.
1287000	1291000	I'm thinking about quitting idle pouring when my subscription is up.
1291000	1294000	Just because I haven't really gotten anywhere.
1294000	1296000	But now I'm kind of spiteful.
1297000	1301000	And want to see if I can beat the level 500 map boss.
1301000	1303000	So, we'll see.
1303000	1305000	Alright. Very nice.
1305000	1307000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1307000	1311000	I didn't play a whole ton this week. I did play a little bit of Pokemon Go.
1311000	1319000	And then also, I went back to, I want to say Hotline Miami.
1319000	1321000	It was Shakedown Miami.
1321000	1324000	And played a little bit of that.
1324000	1326000	That's about it.
1326000	1329000	Alright. No DDR? No arcade this week?
1329000	1332000	No DDR this week. It's been really hot.
1332000	1335000	I'm going to ask you about this. Because you were talking to me about this before the show.
1335000	1340000	And I think a lot of our long time listeners know that you have always historically been a huge fan of laser tag.
1340000	1341000	Yes.
1341000	1348000	And you were, as my people would say, that bitch when it came to Qsar back in the day.
1348000	1350000	You were the guy to beat at Qsar back in the day, right?
1350000	1351000	Yes.
1351000	1354000	Qsars have been kind of famous. But you still follow laser tag.
1354000	1361000	I still try to find the new drug that's going to give me that same high as Qsar did.
1361000	1365000	So you found, because Qsars are like, there's one in Concord.
1365000	1367000	Yeah, there's a whole bunch of laser systems out there.
1367000	1373000	So, I've been just bouncing around the different ones with my kids just to see what is out there.
1373000	1377000	We've gone and played Laser Knights. That's the one that's at the Roseville Golf Land.
1377000	1380000	Which is kind of crappy. It's whatever.
1380000	1384000	You were mentioning there was one probably like two miles from OLR headquarters that you just tried out.
1384000	1387000	So, what was the pros and cons of this laser place you went to today?
1387000	1397000	So, the cons of it were that the arcade sucks. It's just, there's nothing there.
1397000	1402000	It's a few ticket redemption games. They have a couple arcade games.
1402000	1409000	And it's just kind of, it's very empty. Like the whole building's just very empty when it comes to arcades.
1409000	1413000	They have bumper cars though, which is kind of weird. And a laser maze.
1413000	1417000	But that's not why you go there. You go there to play Laser Tag.
1417000	1421000	And their laser tag arena is two stories, which is awesome.
1421000	1424000	And they have these...
1424000	1427000	There used to be that one in Eldorado Hills that was two stories.
1427000	1428000	Yeah, it's...
1428000	1429000	I feel like you and I went there once.
1429000	1432000	I went there once and played there.
1432000	1433000	I don't think they're there anymore.
1433000	1434000	They're closed.
1435000	1438000	This one is, it's more robust as far as like a second story.
1438000	1442000	That one, it was just like, oh, there's a few sections you can go up a little higher and then that's it.
1442000	1445000	This is actually legit two stories, which is pretty cool.
1445000	1450000	The differences obviously with that and QZAR is there's, you know, you don't run out of lives.
1450000	1453000	You just have unlimited lives. Most of the places have that.
1453000	1458000	They have like these like panels that you can shoot. They're like power-ups, which are kind of cool.
1458000	1463000	And then apparently if you like have a membership with this thing, you can also scan like a card or something like that
1463000	1467000	and track your progress and unlock weapons and stuff, which is pretty cool.
1467000	1475000	But it's different than playing QZAR because obviously QZAR, it's its own type of game with its own rules.
1475000	1482000	But using the stuff that I've learned from playing laser tag for a very long time, I kick so much ass anyways.
1482000	1487000	So it was just like, I'm very fast at the drawing.
1487000	1493000	I also know how to position myself behind walls in a way that I can't get hit very easily.
1493000	1498000	But it was fun. We had fun with my kids and went there and got lots of exercise doing it.
1498000	1503000	And I would totally be down for it again. It's more expensive than QZAR used to be.
1503000	1509000	Granted, I played QZAR like a decade ago, so it's understandable the prices have gone up.
1509000	1515000	But it is very close and it wasn't very busy. So I'm definitely down playing some more of that.
1515000	1517000	I have to check this place out. I haven't played laser tag in a while.
1517000	1519000	Last time I played laser tag was probably with you going to Vacaville or something.
1519000	1526000	Yeah, and I still get the urge every once in a while because my coworker, she has family in Vacaville
1526000	1529000	and she keeps talking about how she goes to Starz and stuff like that.
1529000	1535000	I want to go back there to play laser tag, but I know it's so probably run down at that point.
1535000	1542000	And you can't just show up there. No one wants to play that stuff, even there.
1542000	1546000	But this place is like a dedicated laser tag arena, so it's alright.
1546000	1552000	It's weird, though, the way they do it, too, because they can actually stagger games at the same time.
1552000	1558000	So when we first went into our first game, there was a team deathmatch going on,
1558000	1564000	but we were playing free-for-all. Us separately were playing free-for-all within this team deathmatch.
1564000	1569000	And then as we were leaving our last game, there was a team deathmatch coming in,
1569000	1574000	but they were playing free-for-all or something like that, and then we were doing our own team deathmatch.
1574000	1579000	And so it's just really weird, because I kept asking them, do you guys want to go in right now?
1579000	1583000	I'm like, yeah, but isn't there a game already going? They're like, oh, that's fine.
1583000	1587000	We're tracking your time separately. I'm like, how the hell does that work?
1587000	1590000	But it worked, so I was like, okay, cool.
1590000	1598000	Interesting. Alright. Some people reminiscing about laser tag stuff in the chat over at twitch.tv
1598000	1604000	slash vog network, Bobby Blackwolf bragging, I was a Qsar top gun many times in my high school and college years.
1604000	1608000	Let's see, Act F says, we used to have a laser tag place here, but it closed down.
1608000	1609000	Yeah, I think a lot of them have closed down.
1609000	1615000	Yeah, our closest Qsar is probably the one that's probably most up to date and actually maintained is in Concord,
1615000	1621000	which is a good hour and a half away thing. We have one that's a little bit closer in Vacaville,
1621000	1627000	but that's like really, it's kind of run down from the last time I was there, and that was years ago.
1627000	1633000	And I can only imagine the problem with it is because it is an older system, like from like the early 2000s,
1633000	1639000	and they don't really make parts for it anymore. It's very antiquated.
1639000	1644000	It's such an old ass system and they have newer Qsar stuff like the newer systems,
1644000	1650000	but I don't think any facility around here has it. But I'll tell you what, if I ever came into a ton of fucking money,
1650000	1656000	I'm bringing that fucking shit back because I'm a loyalist when it comes to that stuff.
1656000	1658000	So that's what you would do if you won the lottery?
1658000	1665000	Oh hell yeah, I would open up a family fun center with Qsar. Hell yeah.
1665000	1666000	Alright.
1666000	1676000	You know, I think though, like if you're going to have like a Qsar though, you should have like the most elite Japanese style arcade.
1676000	1681000	Yes, I think so. But I think that this, I don't know how long this place has been open.
1681000	1689000	I think that they're just kind of, because they have a ton of room to expand, but there's just not a lot in there as far as arcade games goes right now.
1689000	1695000	And like I get it, redemption's where it's at, but like their redemption prizes are kind of garbage.
1695000	1697000	So it's, I don't know.
1697000	1702000	And also there, I was mentioning this to my wife today.
1702000	1713000	So I think all their games run on quarters and you know how there's like, hey, you buy $20, you get like $25 worth of tokens or something like that.
1713000	1719000	So on their birthday party page, they have it, you pay $50 and you get $68 worth of quarters.
1719000	1727000	And I'm like, that doesn't seem very profitable for you because I could essentially just buy this several times and pay for the party myself.
1727000	1729000	You would essentially pay for the party.
1729000	1734000	I don't see how that works, but that's what they have set up right now.
1734000	1739000	So obviously there hasn't been a ton of thought into the packages that they have.
1739000	1744000	So yeah, or how they make money. So I don't know, but it was fun.
1744000	1749000	All right, well good. My gaming week. So y'all want a LARP update?
1749000	1750000	LARP!
1750000	1756000	So you missed this chat. I was telling you a little bit beforehand, but so last week on the show, Loki and I were here.
1756000	1761000	We talked a little bit about that I was asked to play another Survivor game online.
1761000	1765000	So I was like, what the hey, I've got not a lot going on this month.
1765000	1771000	Forgetting, absentmindedly, like how much time these games take away from your life.
1771000	1774000	But everybody who I've met has been really cool so far.
1774000	1784000	And although I am sad to announce that our tribe has lost four challenges in a row and had to do tribal council four times.
1784000	1790000	I am happy to announce that your boy is still in it. So there is that.
1790000	1794000	So that's all I can say because I don't know who's watching or anything like that.
1794000	1799000	I can't I don't know if the other the other tribe might know about my show or whatever.
1799000	1803000	So I can't say much more. But yeah, it's I'm having a I'm having a good time.
1803000	1807000	The people, if nothing else, even though it's like, oh, my God, nonstop.
1807000	1815000	But the good news is it's not I was able to squeeze in like it's it's it's kind of slowed down enough that I was able to squeeze in some other gaming.
1815000	1821000	So I was playing some Final Fantasy 14, the new expansion.
1821000	1825000	I've made my way to level 74. I've done the first two dungeons.
1825000	1831000	So I'm really kind of getting a sense of the expansion. I got to say, the story is really good so far.
1831000	1835000	I'm super into it. I didn't think I would be like leading in leading up to all the hype with it.
1835000	1840000	But like now that I'm playing and experience it like, oh, my God, the story is really good.
1840000	1844000	And yeah, the dungeon fights have been really cool. The music is is great.
1844000	1848000	So, yeah, I'm loving loving the new Final Fantasy 14 expansion.
1848000	1855000	So, yeah, I'll hopefully play more of that later on tonight, just depending on if I got a LARP or not.
1855000	1859000	And then also I've checked out some new stuff. So I checked out Bloodstained.
1859000	1862000	I finally got my code for the Nintendo Switch. So I played it.
1862000	1869000	I struggled a little bit, like trying to beat that first boss. I couldn't like I'm doing something wrong.
1869000	1878000	I don't know. And I do have the Switch version, which I do notice feels like I feel like she's like ghosting when she jumps and does some weird things that like it controls a little weird.
1878000	1882000	Do you want to try the PS4 one at our place?
1882000	1885000	Maybe. Yeah, probably when I'm over next. I kind of want to check that out.
1885000	1891000	Yeah, for sure. I'd actually like to see how the Switch one plays. So did you? Of course, it's all electronic, right?
1891000	1899000	It's all digital. So. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm sure I'm sure Dan would want to see it, too, but it's pretty.
1899000	1904000	So, yeah, I have to figure out, you know, because I kind of got stuck on that first boss. I'm like, wait, this shouldn't be that hard.
1904000	1910000	But then I was like, distraction, go play something else. And the other something else I ended up playing was Mario Maker 2.
1910000	1915000	So I played some Super Mario Maker 2. Finally, I haven't done any designing of levels, but I've done a lot of playing levels.
1915000	1923000	I've played quite a few of the story mode levels so far. And it's kind of neat seeing some of the creative things that they do, not just in the story levels,
1923000	1928000	but then, of course, some of the user levels. There's some pretty clever stuff and concepts that people are coming up with.
1928000	1933000	So I'm going to save some of that till a little later in the show, because for our little break in studio tonight,
1933000	1940000	I'm going to play through some listener levels in Mario Maker. And then there's like a top, like one of the top three levels right now.
1940000	1945000	I play that too. So we'll take a look at that a little later in the show for those of you that are a little more curious about Mario Maker.
1945000	1950000	But you guys know I love the Mario Maker on the Wii or the Wii U, excuse me.
1950000	1955000	And so this one is, you know, especially if you miss the Wii U, it's definitely a worthy successor.
1955000	1961000	But it does feel like, OK, they've got like a lot more like ways you can customize the looks of the levels.
1961000	1964000	You know, now you can do the stuff like with the cat Mario and all this stuff.
1964000	1970000	My only slight disappointment is that I actually kind of miss the amiibo stuff.
1970000	1976000	And not that it necessarily has to be amiibos, but like the fact that you could get other sprites to replace Mario.
1976000	1979000	Why can't it be the amiibos? I don't understand why they couldn't.
1979000	1983000	Well, it was before, so I don't know why they cut that out. I'm a little, I was just a little sad about that.
1983000	1988000	So, but not everything was amiibo, because like in the original Mario Maker on Wii U, it was like,
1988000	1991000	go online this week and play this level and you would unlock these.
1991000	1994000	Maybe they're going to Japanese TV deal DLC.
1994000	1998000	Maybe it does seem like, you know, a lot of people are maybe just an update.
1998000	2003000	A lot of people are speculating that Mario Maker kind of has a nice little spot for an extra world
2003000	2007000	where a lot of people are like Mario to maybe.
2007000	2012000	I don't know. I think the Game Boy one, because I guess if you actually go through the whole thing,
2012000	2018000	you can actually unlock like a Game Boy, not the whole level, but like a Mario that looks like the Game Boy version.
2018000	2022000	Well, they have, who throws the balls, the fireballs, like the ball that bounces around the screen.
2022000	2027000	Yeah, they have that. And then there's the hammer Mario as well.
2027000	2029000	Yeah, the builder Mario or whatever.
2029000	2033000	So I haven't played all the story mode yet or to the point where you even get that,
2033000	2035000	but I understand those are things that are kind of tucked away,
2035000	2039000	but I would wonder if they might just do a full on like Game Boy Mario
2039000	2044000	or maybe like a Wario Land type of thing would be kind of fun too. So we'll see.
2044000	2048000	I don't know. I just feel like Super Mario Brothers 2 is so different
2048000	2052000	that that would be so weird if that's the one they end up doing. But you know, who knows?
2052000	2054000	It would be awesome. I would love it.
2054000	2061000	I just feel like it's so much different than the other Mario games because of course it started as a completely different game.
2061000	2067000	Yeah. So it'd be interesting. I could see maybe a Japanese Mario 2 skin
2067000	2072000	that changes the look of all the bricks and things like that and let you do poison mushrooms and stuff.
2072000	2074000	You can do poison mushrooms.
2074000	2076000	You can do that now, huh?
2076000	2078000	I miss the amiibos.
2078000	2082000	It's interesting to me they just don't have the Mario 2 Japan skin for it.
2082000	2084000	No, no. So anyway.
2084000	2086000	I miss amiibo.
2086000	2090000	Didn't they have like the Tandy or something like that? That weird version of Mario?
2090000	2096000	Now Bobby says the downside of the costumes is that they were only in the Super Mario palette,
2096000	2098000	so most levels were in Super Mario Brothers 1.
2098000	2102000	By getting rid of the costumes, the level backgrounds are more varied.
2102000	2105000	I'm okay with them taking some liberties though.
2105000	2111000	It's not like we actually expect the 8-bit Mario levels to be things that are playable on an 8-bit cartridge.
2111000	2118000	I think Mario Maker is going to come into its own, so I don't feel like they have to go by all the palette rules and things like that.
2118000	2122000	But I don't know. Maybe it's a weird thing in development.
2122000	2127000	Or bring back the amiibo in the Mario 3D World thing or something.
2127000	2130000	But I liked it in the old school Mario.
2130000	2135000	Oh right. Bobby's saying, no I mean they didn't put the costumes in the other versions.
2135000	2137000	You couldn't use the costumes in Super Mario World.
2137000	2140000	No, that's true. It was unique to the 8-bit.
2140000	2142000	But I was okay with that.
2142000	2147000	But if they wanted to bring them into Super Mario 3 or something different, I like that kind of variety.
2147000	2149000	It made for some more fun themed levels.
2149000	2154000	I remember there was like a little, oh you can play Ashley the witch from WarioWare was a character you could get.
2154000	2157000	And I made some levels around that and I thought it was cute and fun.
2157000	2158000	But anyway.
2158000	2162000	But otherwise, I think Mario Maker 2 is fantastic.
2162000	2165000	And we'll see a little bit more of that later on in the show.
2165000	2170000	So, I think we are good to get into our news for the week.
2170000	2172000	Just a couple quick housekeeping things though.
2172000	2176000	I do want to just, you know, again for those that are not listening to Bobby Blackwolf,
2176000	2180000	who happened to be in the southeast part of the country, specifically the Atlanta area.
2180000	2187000	Bobby will be representing Voice Geek Network, VoG Network, who is sponsoring the Southern Fried Game Room Expo,
2187000	2190000	or excuse me, Gaming Expo, because they changed the name not that long ago.
2190000	2196000	We are sponsoring that and that is taking place in Atlanta this coming weekend.
2196000	2200000	So, if you want to play some old school games, some old pinball we were talking about later in the show,
2200000	2206000	or other old school games and see some panels and hang out with people, I would highly recommend it.
2206000	2212000	I would be going myself if I wasn't going to be back in Atlanta in six weeks for Dragon Con,
2212000	2217000	which is the other thing I would announce that Dragon Con, of course, is Labor Day weekend.
2217000	2221000	That's all over downtown Atlanta and that is going to be a lot of fun.
2221000	2224000	And I can't say everything I'm doing yet.
2224000	2231000	I've just seen some of the drafts and it's going to be a very big year for VoG.
2231000	2233000	I'm very excited about it.
2233000	2235000	I'm like really pumped for this year's show.
2235000	2237000	I'm really, really excited.
2237000	2238000	Cool.
2238000	2241000	I have to tell you, dark side, remind me off air, I've got to tell you about one of the panels I'm doing,
2241000	2244000	I'm scheduled to do that, yeah, I'll tell you about it.
2244000	2246000	So, anyway, leave me with that little teaser.
2246000	2248000	Is it something that will have me shook?
2248000	2250000	I don't know if it was shook, but you'll probably know.
2250000	2251000	Maybe a slight quake?
2251000	2252000	More like, oh neat.
2252000	2253000	Oh, quiver.
2253000	2254000	Oh, quiver.
2254000	2255000	A little like, ooh.
2255000	2256000	Oh, quiver.
2256000	2257000	So, that's it.
2257000	2260000	Okay, let's get into some newsy news.
2260000	2265000	Yes, so everybody's very excited about all these exclusives on the Epic Games Store.
2265000	2270000	I say that very sarcastically because nobody likes it at all.
2270000	2277000	Unfortunately, there's a lot of games that people had kickstarted that were under the impression that this was going to be out on Steam
2277000	2282000	and now are being told, well guess what, it's actually going to be an Epic Source exclusive
2282000	2284000	and of course people are not happy with that.
2284000	2290000	So, one of those games definitely more notable is Shenmue 3, which was kickstarted
2290000	2298000	and of course fans of that series who did back the game are now wondering, well, can I get a refund?
2298000	2303000	Because I don't want my game on the Epic Store, I want it on Steam.
2303000	2309000	And so, as of originally when they reached out to the development team
2309000	2313000	they said that, well no, we're not going to do refunds at all.
2313000	2321000	But Tim Sweeney has come out now kind of making a comment about these Epic Score exclusives and Kickstarter.
2321000	2327000	So, what they've promised to do now is they're going to actually fund the cost of the Kickstarter refunds
2327000	2336000	resulting from the move to the Epic Games Store so that the refunds aren't going to affect the developer's funding.
2337000	2339000	So, of course they're doing this for EaseNet.
2339000	2347000	And they said, going forward, when future games go Epic exclusive after offering crowdfunding rewards on other PC stores
2347000	2353000	we will either coordinate with colleagues at the other stores to ensure key availability in advance
2353000	2356000	or guaranteed refunds at the announcement time.
2356000	2362000	So, good on them doing that, but still shitty that this is a thing.
2362000	2368000	And it's funny enough though, I know with Shimu 3 they've gotten all sorts of money from different places.
2368000	2375000	They have a publisher, and that same publisher also did this kind of shit as well with Epic Score exclusive.
2375000	2382000	So, I don't know. I understand originally why people wanted to go Epic Store exclusive
2382000	2386000	because less games on the platform, you get a larger cut.
2386000	2392000	But I think that a lot of these AAA companies are starting to abuse that to get more profits.
2392000	2396000	But at least that people that don't are really...
2396000	2403000	So, Ben Alshea about Epic having the exclusive on something have an option to get a refund if they want to.
2403000	2411000	Yeah, so that was obviously a messy scenario with Shimu 3 where some people just do not want to support Epic Store for whatever reason.
2411000	2413000	And I respect their right to do so.
2413000	2416000	This is pretty bare bones, and I get it. The features aren't there.
2416000	2421000	Well, and there's concerns about the privacy stuff too, like when they were pulling in your Steam stuff without really asking.
2421000	2423000	So, I get it. I respect that.
2423000	2428000	But that is good that Epic at least kind of found a way to, even though it's interesting,
2428000	2433000	because they're essentially going to pay people to not use their store.
2433000	2439000	But you're right, otherwise it was kind of a crappy thing for the crowdfunding sites to do.
2439000	2443000	It is kind of ridiculous to see them solve all their problems by throwing money at it.
2443000	2446000	I mean, they're like, oh, we need more people on the platform. Let's throw money at this problem.
2446000	2451000	Oh, people don't like that their games are exclusive to the platform. Let's throw some more money at that problem.
2451000	2454000	How much money do we need to throw you before you're happy?
2454000	2458000	Hey, but Fortnite is still huge for Epic. That game is still huge.
2458000	2463000	Didn't make the show world tonight, but there's a whole Stranger Things thing going on in Fortnite right now.
2463000	2465000	Oh, they've got all sorts of tie-ins with everything.
2465000	2469000	It was like last week, or was it a month ago, it was like John Wick.
2469000	2473000	I remember the one where you go in and you hear the Weezer album in the creative level.
2473000	2477000	Yeah, and Thanos has been in there a few times. So they do all sorts of things.
2477000	2482000	But it's because Fortnite is the biggest thing in games still.
2482000	2484000	So they can kind of control that conversation.
2484000	2490000	But they want something to be able to carry them when inevitably gamers move on from Fortnite.
2490000	2497000	Because just as you may not hear Minecraft as much anymore, or what are the big Twitch games?
2497000	2500000	PUBG, I guess. You don't hear as much anymore.
2500000	2505000	Not to say those games are dead, not by any means, but they're just not what they were.
2505000	2510000	Pokemon Go, sure. Same type of thing. Wasn't what it was, but it's still cooking.
2510000	2515000	So anyway, all right. Well, let's talk a little bit.
2515000	2518000	This one's a little more in the rumors section. What can I say?
2518000	2524000	It's a bit of a slower news week, so we're willing to tackle a few more rumors that go around the net.
2524000	2528000	But this is... there might be some traction to this.
2528000	2537000	Because some comments that were made by Sony Interactive Entertainment president Jim Ryan
2537000	2540000	in an interview to Nikkei that was translated.
2540000	2547000	He says that the company is thinking about possibly merging and acquiring more development companies.
2547000	2552000	Because Google is starting to get in there with Stadia and so forth.
2552000	2557000	And one of the quotes from the interview is he said,
2557000	2561000	content is becoming more important than ever before.
2561000	2567000	Sony Interactive Entertainment has 25 years of experience in the games industry and has big assets.
2567000	2572000	So it's not like they don't have things like God of War and Last of Us
2572000	2574000	and a lot of big titles that are still carrying them.
2574000	2578000	But I'm sure they're looking at things like what could Google Stadia be cooking up.
2578000	2583000	And as well as Microsoft has done a ton of acquisitions in the past couple of years
2583000	2585000	to really position their next console.
2585000	2588000	You might not be seeing the payoff yet on Xbox One,
2588000	2590000	but I imagine by the time their next console is about to hit,
2590000	2594000	we're going to really see the payoff for all these studios that they've been acquiring.
2594000	2599000	So I think Sony wants to make sure that they're on top of that as well, if that makes sense.
2599000	2601000	Probably, yeah, it makes sense.
2601000	2605000	Now, obviously, we have no idea who they're looking at acquiring.
2605000	2606000	We're not going to know that.
2606000	2615000	But perhaps Microsoft has been acquiring mostly US, North American, I think some Europe studios.
2615000	2618000	Maybe Sony is going to go after some Japanese studios.
2618000	2622000	I don't think Microsoft has acquired anything Japanese at this point, if I'm not mistaken.
2622000	2624000	I might be neglecting something in the moment.
2624000	2629000	They're just going to acquire Devolver Digital and have them run their whole PR campaign.
2629000	2632000	Who knows? Have them run their E3 next year, certainly.
2632000	2634000	That could possibly be, right?
2634000	2636000	Ah, yes.
2636000	2642000	But we don't know if they're going to be planning anything similar to Xbox Game Pass or anything like that.
2642000	2647000	But yeah, Sony just wants to make sure the PlayStation 5 is going to have stuff on it at launch.
2647000	2652000	Backwards compatibility, hopefully that's not going to be the issue for Sony like it's been in the past.
2652000	2654000	So hopefully they'll have that, if nothing else.
2654000	2656000	But we will see.
2656000	2664000	They just need to get the stick out of their ass about that and modding and cross-play.
2664000	2668000	I don't know, whatever else they have sticks in their ass about.
2668000	2670000	Where's my goddamn Ridge Racer game?
2670000	2672000	I know that's not Sony, but still.
2672000	2673000	Hey, Namco.
2673000	2675000	Namco, seriously, get off your ass.
2675000	2676000	I mean, what the fuck are you doing?
2676000	2677000	What is Namco doing anyway?
2677000	2679000	I need a new point blank.
2679000	2680000	I need a new Ridge Racer.
2680000	2681000	What the hell are you putting out?
2681000	2682000	More Tekken games?
2682000	2684000	I mean, we don't fucking need more Tekken games.
2684000	2685000	Tekken is awesome.
2685000	2687000	There's a new Tales game that they showed off.
2687000	2689000	I don't care, I want my point blank, dammit.
2689000	2690000	Point blank.
2690000	2691000	Ridge Racer.
2691000	2694000	I'm sure there's a new Pac-Man thing in development.
2694000	2696000	I want a point blank Ridge Racer game.
2696000	2697000	Guns and Cars.
2697000	2698000	Yes.
2698000	2700000	Would it be like Lucky and Wild?
2700000	2701000	Yeah, Lucky and Wild.
2701000	2703000	Oh my god, we had one at my arcade that I worked at.
2703000	2705000	Lucky and Wild was kind of fun.
2705000	2707000	Alright, let's move on.
2707000	2708000	I hated being the driver, though.
2708000	2709000	Dark soccer.
2710000	2716000	So, Nintendo, being the internet-phobic company that they have historically been,
2716000	2722000	is actually talking about the future of gaming being in the cloud.
2722000	2725000	They must keep up with the cloud.
2725000	2729000	You know, I hate, by the way, just an aside, I hate when people say,
2729000	2731000	oh, but the cloud, I'm afraid of the cloud.
2731000	2733000	Do you know what the cloud is, people?
2733000	2734000	It's computer.
2734000	2735000	The internet.
2735000	2736000	It's the internet.
2736000	2738000	Don't be freaked out by the cloud.
2738000	2742000	But the cloud is always listening on my conversations.
2742000	2743000	And you know what?
2743000	2747000	So is everything else always fucking listening to your conversations.
2747000	2748000	So, whatever.
2748000	2752000	I feel like the cloud is just people's, it's Skynet for most people.
2752000	2755000	It's so funny having to explain this to people.
2755000	2758000	Okay, so do you have the same fear when you do a Google search?
2758000	2759000	No.
2759000	2760000	Okay.
2760000	2762000	What about when you save a file on your computer?
2762000	2763000	No.
2763000	2765000	What about when you visit Pornhub?
2765000	2771000	Pornhub knows what you're doing.
2771000	2774000	I would comment, but it would maybe out where I work,
2774000	2782000	but I have done screen sharing with somebody and saw his professional portfolio.
2782000	2784000	Ah.
2784000	2786000	It has been there.
2786000	2787000	There's a little wink with that.
2787000	2788000	All right.
2788000	2789000	Anyway, next up in gaming.
2789000	2793000	So anyway, there was the shareholder meeting.
2793000	2798000	And basically the Nintendo executives were asked what they thought about cloud gaming.
2798000	2805000	And here is a direct translation from the Nintendo president Furukawa Shuntaro.
2805000	2809000	And I'm going to read the whole quote because it's pretty interesting.
2809000	2812000	While we don't expect all games to become cloud games any time soon,
2812000	2814000	the technologies are definitely advancing.
2814000	2818000	We see a future where cloud and streaming technologies will develop more and more
2818000	2821000	as a means of delivering games to customers.
2821000	2822000	Sorry, consumers.
2822000	2825000	We must keep up with such changes in the environment.
2825000	2828000	That being said, if these changes increase the worldwide gaming population,
2828000	2832000	that will just give us more opportunities with our integrated hardware
2832000	2835000	and software development approach to reach people worldwide
2835000	2838000	with the unique entertainment that Nintendo can provide.
2838000	2842000	So this meaning that they may be going more and more digital
2842000	2846000	with a lot more of their content as well as saving their games,
2846000	2850000	integrating some of that cloud technology in with the games as they progress.
2850000	2857000	And Miyamoto basically agreed that it's going to become more widespread in the future.
2857000	2859000	But he doesn't think it's going to replace consoles.
2859000	2861000	Not yet.
2861000	2866000	I mean, so it's very interesting.
2866000	2870000	Nintendo doesn't have a cloud service of their own right now.
2870000	2873000	Not a true cloud service.
2873000	2876000	But it's possible it could be in the pipeline.
2876000	2880000	And one of the other things that came out of that
2880000	2884000	is that they said that they'd consider whether each product that they offer
2884000	2887000	is suited to a subscription model.
2887000	2889000	So we'll see what happens.
2889000	2891000	Well, yeah, Nintendo's certainly got to be thinking about it,
2891000	2894000	especially with what some of the competition around them is doing
2894000	2896000	between Xbox and Google.
2896000	2900000	But I really think that them kind of waiting on this one.
2900000	2903000	I know we always make fun of Nintendo being late to the online party,
2903000	2905000	but I wouldn't want to make fun of them here
2905000	2907000	and then under the exact same breath be like,
2907000	2911000	but I think Google's too early to the cloud streaming party
2911000	2913000	when it comes to things like Internet bandwidth caps
2913000	2915000	and just like what you're, you know.
2915000	2918000	I think once 5G is more widely available,
2918000	2921000	then we can have more of a conversation about, you know, Google Stadia
2921000	2923000	and what it might bring to the equation.
2923000	2927000	But I think it's okay that Nintendo is still kind of being dormant on this for a little while
2927000	2929000	and kind of seeing what happens to other people first.
2929000	2931000	I, for one, welcome our cloud overlords.
2931000	2933000	I'm just kidding.
2933000	2940000	I think that there are some companies that do cloud very well and some that do not.
2940000	2945000	The thing that I, and I'll go ahead and admit, I've used several cloud services.
2945000	2948000	I've used Amazon's cloud storage.
2948000	2951000	Of course, I have an iPhone. I use iCloud,
2951000	2954000	which I actually prefer because of the level of encryption on it.
2954000	2959000	But secondly, you don't have to use it to be able to use your device properly.
2959000	2963000	Unlike what some people think, it's really not necessary.
2963000	2965000	Yeah, I don't use it.
2965000	2967000	I've used Google's cloud services.
2967000	2969000	Their photos thing is pretty interesting.
2969000	2972000	I still prefer my iCloud photos.
2972000	2976000	But there's plenty of other cloud services out there.
2976000	2979000	I mean Dropbox in and of itself is a cloud service.
2979000	2980000	True.
2980000	2982000	And how many of us use our Dropbox?
2982000	2984000	This show kind of needs it.
2984000	2992000	Wouldn't it be something if there was a Dropbox-like service?
2992000	2999000	Not just, though, remember what was the thing called the Dex Drives for the Playstation?
2999000	3000000	Yeah.
3000000	3006000	Wouldn't it be cool if you could save, if you could publish your save files?
3007000	3013000	So that, hey, I did this in this game. Check out my character.
3013000	3019000	Some of the forums, someone used to upload their Mass Effect save files.
3019000	3023000	But that would be cheating now because there's achievements and all that sort of stuff.
3023000	3029000	But it would probably be a cinch to encode that this was an uploaded file.
3029000	3035000	You would think, but you could tie them back to the profile or something like that.
3035000	3042000	But I know when it comes to Nintendo, that's why they didn't even allow backing up of certain saves.
3042000	3047000	There's no cloud saves for certain games because they're worried that people are going to somehow cheat.
3047000	3051000	Even though they're cheating in other ways. Not this.
3051000	3060000	But then in using cloud services, we already have, for example, we have multiplayer.
3060000	3063000	That's roughly a cloud service, too. It's a streaming service.
3063000	3068000	But what if you have things like a cloud-based collaboration for things like Mario Maker?
3068000	3072000	Where you can have a bunch of friends remotely put a game together.
3072000	3080000	You know, there's so many applications for it that I really am looking forward to seeing more companies embrace it.
3080000	3082000	But they're going to have to step up their encryption game.
3082000	3085000	I'm getting some comments from our chat over Twitch TV slash VOG Network.
3085000	3090000	Taijudo says, Nintendo has always used the internet in ways Sony and Microsoft didn't.
3090000	3095000	They did online tourneys built into their games. They had the Nintendo forum thing, the PC chat.
3095000	3099000	They always do online stuff, just not in traditional ways. They innovate.
3099000	3102000	Sometimes they innovate, but sometimes I feel like they're lagging behind.
3102000	3106000	I think that Nintendo Online Switch app, I think that's kind of lagging behind a little bit.
3106000	3110000	I just feel like people are not using that as much as they're using things like Discord and stuff.
3110000	3115000	But to your credit, I will say something like Miiverse was very different.
3115000	3120000	And the way they incorporated things like Miiverse into things like Mario Maker, we'll say on the Wii U.
3120000	3124000	And that kind of lives on a little bit in what they do in Mario Maker 2.
3124000	3129000	That was kind of unique and very different from what Sony and Microsoft were doing.
3129000	3133000	So I will give you that. Like Miiverse especially was something very different.
3133000	3138000	Questbuster in chat says, cloud is coming and digital services are on the rise.
3138000	3144000	There's no denying that, but I still prefer local control over what I can and cannot install on my console.
3144000	3149000	Except with a good cloud service, you can control what you can and can't install.
3149000	3158000	With my Steam, for example, I can have it do cloud saves, which I turned off for some of my games.
3158000	3163000	Because the cloud saves did some weird syncing. Actually, no, it was for Origin.
3163000	3167000	It was screwing up my Mass Effect saves. And my Dragon Age ones too.
3167000	3174000	I turned it off in Origin, but any good cloud service will still give you fine control.
3174000	3178000	You just have to spend the time to go through your preferences. End of story.
3178000	3185000	And again, before you look into any particular cloud service, go check how good their encryption is.
3185000	3190000	That's a big thing. Make sure your own internet is secure.
3190000	3194000	As long as you're careful, there's no problem.
3194000	3199000	Let's move on. We have some more gaming news to get into before we get to the Classic Game of the Week.
3199000	3210000	This is interesting because it's a brand new feature for Twitch, which allows you to do the subscriber-only streams.
3210000	3214000	So you can have this exclusive thing that only your subscribers can see.
3214000	3221000	The problem with that, though, is apparently some of these end-user license agreements prohibit that.
3221000	3239000	So, for example, companies like Blizzard, Valve, Riot, and CG Project Red have terms that contain statements to the fact that when you're streaming, you have to do it in a way that it's not going to be...
3239000	3245000	I don't know why it's saved enough for money, but it's basically that you have to be used in a non-commercial way.
3245000	3253000	The use of our content and videos must be non-commercial. By that we mean you can't charge users to view or access your videos.
3253000	3258000	You can't sell or license your videos to others for any payment of any kind.
3258000	3266000	Which I kind of wonder if already charging for stuff is not necessarily charging. I mean, I guess with ads it's not really charging for it, but like...
3266000	3273000	Well, I think a lot of that stuff is probably written, too, so that people don't make tapes or CDs or Blu-rays of the games.
3273000	3276000	Hey, yo! You wanna get some of my Overwatch tapes?
3276000	3283000	Hold up, hold up. The reason why my head goes there is because where my brain goes is to those old GameProTV tapes.
3283000	3284000	Tips and tricks.
3284000	3290000	Yeah, the tips and tricks stuff. So, like, I'm not just being old, but maybe I'm being a little old. So, you know, there's that.
3290000	3294000	And so they don't want people, you know, making money off that without maybe some type of buy-in.
3294000	3303000	Because I would imagine those tapes back in the day, probably the publishers got a little bit of kickback for, you know, those usage in the videos and stuff.
3303000	3304000	Yeah.
3304000	3313000	But, you know, they don't want people to do that. Or any type of, like, selling Blu-rays or, you know, selling how to beat XYZ game, you know, type of stuff without maybe some type of contribution there.
3313000	3321000	So I feel like maybe a lot of this was written before the idea of a Twitch subscriber only thing, but I don't know if you had more. Sorry.
3321000	3334000	Yeah. So it's basically, it's kind of a gray area right now that whether they are going to be in violation of these terms of services if they're using that service.
3334000	3343000	I'm sure that, like, something like this, if it becomes more popular, I'm sure that they'll adjust their terms of services depending on what's being required of this.
3343000	3351000	I don't know if this is necessarily, like, really different than saying putting the exclusive videos on Patreon or something like that.
3351000	3366000	I mean, I don't know. I think it's, I think right now we're not really sure what it's going to entail, but I don't think that people are going to, like, get sued by these companies if they use this service.
3366000	3381000	I don't either. But I do also think part of us, like, I think a lot of Twitch stuff, we're very lucky that publishers haven't kind of come to stake their claim for the fact that they made the game y'all are playing and getting biddies and subscriptions.
3381000	3389000	Well, that would be unfortunate for them, because guess what? And I'm assuming big publishers with, you know, their own law department, legal departments and stuff like that.
3389000	3398000	Guess what, big publishers? There's a lot of smaller indie publishers that would love seeing people play their game in a similar fashion, so you could miss out on that.
3398000	3400000	So it kind of ends up being this gigantic game of chicken.
3400000	3414000	Pretty much, yeah. Like, you can threaten people, but, like, if you're going to be, like, an asshole about it, Nintendo, though they did walk it back, I mean, there's just going to be ways around it that you could go.
3414000	3420000	I mean, and even this, I don't know if this is going to be something that a lot of people use. It may be just more beneficial to them, I would think.
3420000	3431000	Like, I know subscriptions are a decent amount of money, but I think a lot of people make, a lot of big streamers make more money from donations and biddies and stuff like that.
3431000	3438000	I would think that you'd be more interested in making sure that the most, as many people could see that stream as possible.
3438000	3445000	I mean, the only time I could think of that you'd want to do, like, an exclusive stream like that might be for, like, maybe announcements or something like that. I don't know.
3445000	3447000	But, like, Q&A's, ask me anything.
3447000	3462000	Yeah, like, something like that. Yeah, exactly. So, I don't know necessarily gameplay would be locked behind the stuff, but I would imagine that most large streamers are going to be more interested in just getting people to watch their stream so that they can donate money to them.
3463000	3471000	A very special ASMR subscriber only. Only subscribers.
3473000	3478000	That's where this is going to get used. Tell me I'm wrong. Tell me I'm wrong.
3478000	3479000	Unsubscribe.
3482000	3483000	But anyway.
3483000	3484000	Well, you know.
3484000	3485000	What?
3485000	3491000	We could, you know, do one of those streams and then you could just sell some bathwater with that as well.
3493000	3503000	Look, uh, yeah, I don't think we really have plans to use that here at the VoiceGeeks Network. I sure might, I don't know, Bobby had a pretty good idea about, like, having a controlled Jackbox game.
3503000	3504000	That would be kind of cool.
3504000	3515000	A-holes don't join and so, like, maybe doing, like, VIPs and subscribers and all that. I thought that was a pretty clever idea so that way you don't get the randos joining in, like, putting, you know, trying to derail your game.
3515000	3532000	But I think for the most part, I mean, certainly, you know, we are very appreciative of all the subs we get here at VOG Network and all the bit donations as well, but believe me, we just had some flyers printed to give away at Southern Fry Game Room Expo and we didn't have to pay for that out of pocket thanks to you guys helping us out.
3532000	3547000	So that's going to help us get out the word of VOG Network. So we really appreciate all of that. And if you guys, you know, continue to subscribe, remember the perk is, is that the one thing we do lock away is all the video content if you're not here live.
3547000	3558000	So you can watch the video live, but you only get the podcast part for free. I say only, but that is, you know, 17 years of our show has been always, like, online only and free.
3558000	3565000	It's just we like, oh, this is like a little something extra we can give for a little something extra. It's not that much money.
3565000	3573000	And you get Bobby as well and any other future show that comes here to VOG Network. So anyway, all right.
3573000	3579000	Moving on. Gosh, I'm just looking at some of the comments in chat. Somebody clip that. That's great.
3579000	3588000	Yeah. All right. Anyway, Tiger Claw says they could use this feature to stream adults only stuff. No, because now people still get a five minute preview.
3588000	3594000	I think of even the subscriber only feeds and Twitch still has their rules about broadcasting.
3594000	3600000	I can't like suddenly take my shirt off because it's a subscriber only. I'm not going to because it's a subscriber only stream.
3600000	3604000	Blindness, Rob. I know. Right. It's yeah. The whole thing would break anyway.
3604000	3610000	But like, you know, that is part of Twitch policies is that, you know, you don't have your shirt on when you're streaming, please know that.
3610000	3619000	So. All right. Yeah, that's right. And Bobby says there are other sites that do live streaming for adult content, complete with money changing hands.
3619000	3626000	That's right. That's right. So, yes, they have. If you'd like a list of some contact me after the show.
3626000	3631000	Just that. Just ask your your favorite listening smart listening device.
3631000	3635000	You and I may have some different tastes, though, so you may want to ask somebody else like Logie.
3635000	3645000	All right. Anyway, move it on. Move it on. Let's talk about something that will be for everybody's taste, because I know people are fans of this series.
3645000	3651000	Y'all remember River City Ransom on the end? Yeah, I saw like actual gameplay of that and it looked pretty cool.
3651000	3655000	Yeah, well, well, that was the old school one. Was it? No, the new one. That's right.
3655000	3662000	Yeah. It's coming out called River City Girls Way Forward has announced that River City Girls is on its way out.
3662000	3668000	It features high school girls, Kyoko and Misako that are going to beat some people up.
3668000	3674000	Are they wearing like this? The whole Sukeban outfit? They look like they're dressed like Japanese schoolgirls.
3674000	3678000	It's kind of what they're dressed as. But I mean, to be fair, that would fit in.
3678000	3683000	The original one was supposed to be in high school as well. So I'm not thinking it's exploitative.
3683000	3691000	It actually does. It's it's for plot purposes. But anyway, you play it for the plot.
3691000	3697000	Yeah. They get to wield baseball bats, bikes, park benches, because you could do that in the original.
3697000	3704000	They're basically being Sukeban. Yeah. Yeah. So it looks a little bit retro, but it doesn't look like the old Kunio-kun games.
3704000	3711000	It definitely has a new art style to it. And apparently guest appearances from older River City characters will be in this as well.
3711000	3717000	So that's pretty cool. There's also going to be a soundtrack. Some indie artists like Chip Zell and Nate Wants to Battle.
3717000	3722000	That's gonna be pretty cool. And they're saying anime and manga style cut scenes.
3722000	3729000	So I just hope, I just hope, just like in River City Ransom, one of the enemies when you defeat them will go barf, just like in the old school.
3729000	3730000	This does look really cute.
3730000	3740000	Right. Yeah. It looks kind of fun. So there will be a thirty dollar release on September 5th digitally on the various PC stores.
3740000	3745000	Humble Bundle, Steam, GOG. I notice Epic isn't in there, though. So interesting.
3745000	3752000	It will also come out on PlayStation 4, Switch and Xbox One. There will be a physical version through Limited Run Games at some point.
3752000	3758000	So, yeah, I would want to check this out. I love the old River City games and the Kunio-kun games in general are usually a lot of fun.
3758000	3762000	This is kind of doing some different stuff, but I'm into it.
3762000	3764000	Yeah, it looks cute.
3764000	3767000	It does. So. All right.
3768000	3775000	Mm hmm. Yeah, I was just looking in chat. Act Def says way forward with the all the great announcements this week.
3775000	3777000	Quest Buster saying River City Girls looks good.
3777000	3781000	Dr. Suna says the visuals kind of reminded me of the Scott Pilgrim game.
3781000	3785000	That's what I was thinking, which was definitely inspired by the series. So that's a very good call out there.
3785000	3789000	So. All right. Well, let's move on. We have a few more stories for you guys.
3789000	3791000	Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?
3791000	3799000	Well, there is an Atari game that is going for ninety thousand dollars on eBay.
3799000	3803000	It's Atari twenty six hundred game. It is not the rarest game of all time.
3803000	3809000	People like to say that they are. But honestly, I think like if it was going to be the rarest game ever,
3809000	3813000	there would have been like one of it made and it was never sold and blah, blah, blah.
3813000	3822000	So anyway, this game is called Extra Terrestrials, which is a knockoff of this shitball known as E.T.
3822000	3831000	It came out in 1993 and there were a few copies that made it out.
3831000	3837000	Very few copies. And one of them is now on the eBay's.
3837000	3846000	It is supposed to be pretty obscure. I mean, because it was also just sort of like a self published game at the time.
3846000	3855000	But then again, it was one of the last games before that actually was made after the crash of 83.
3855000	3865000	So it's. Honestly, someone saw E.T. and they're like, wow, that sold so well, I got to make another one.
3865000	3873000	I'll be honest, I would have to see what it actually looked like if it was like something that they improved on E.T. or anything.
3873000	3877000	E.T. Battle Royale. But the seller is Game Wizard 69.
3877000	3886000	Oh my God. And the quote says that they are the only confirmed private owner of this game right now, with the only other one being the P.C. Museum.
3886000	3891000	I kind of want that now. The listing is for the cartridge only, no box manual or other materials.
3891000	3897000	In accept quote, fingers acceptable case. No, they can see a finger.
3897000	3906000	There you go. Acceptable condition. And it arrives in a Lucite case.
3906000	3911000	I saw some clips of the game online. It does. It looks like E.T. meets Pac-Man.
3911000	3918000	That's like they stole the sprites from E.T. But I guess it was a Canadian developed thing with only like 100 copies in existence or something.
3918000	3924000	Well, apparently there's two left, I don't know. But I wouldn't pay $90,000 for it.
3924000	3930000	I wouldn't have even paid like $500 for stadium events if it had gone down that low.
3930000	3937000	So, however, I do have copies of Final Fight Guy and Ninja Gaiden Trilogy if someone wants to make me an offer.
3937000	3939000	You've been putting that offer on the table for years.
3939000	3944000	Well, I haven't put it on actual eBay yet. I mean, if I put it on eBay, that'd be a different story.
3944000	3950000	But I would rather O.L.R. listeners own a piece of my collection for a lot of money.
3950000	3951000	Own a piece of the vault.
3951000	3954000	Make me an offer that's above a couple hundred dollars.
3954000	3960000	Alright, because those are some pretty rare, like the Final Fight Guy. Final Fight Guy was only a blockbuster thing, right?
3960000	3965000	Correct. But yeah, help me pay down my credit card. Help me pay for my roof.
3965000	3969000	Alright, let's move on. A few more stories for you guys. Loki.
3969000	3977000	So, I don't know if this is canon in other games, but apparently there's Armored Mewtwo coming to Pokémon GO.
3977000	3989000	So from July 10th through July 30th, they're going to have Mewtwo appearing in 5-star raids across the globe.
3989000	3995000	And so you'll be able to battle to catch that Mewtwo, which I can only imagine is going to be insanely hard to catch.
3995000	4003000	And the other thing teased as well is apparently that there may be the inclusion of Team Rocket at some point soon.
4003000	4008000	Because there is a hot air balloon over some Dortmund event.
4008000	4011000	Oh yeah, like the Pokémon GO Fest in Europe, yeah.
4011000	4012000	Yes.
4012000	4016000	That'd be kind of fun. Maybe there'll be a quest or something. You can dress like Team Rocket though.
4016000	4022000	Because my guy wears a little rainbow R-shirt because, hello, my name's Rob, so like, you know, it works.
4022000	4024000	Yeah, so that'd be pretty cool.
4024000	4027000	You're secretly Team Rocket.
4027000	4029000	Prepare for trouble.
4029000	4031000	And make it double.
4031000	4035000	So, yeah, I'd be down. I think it'd be cool.
4035000	4041000	Now, are they saying if Armored Mewtwo will be shiny? Because that's the thing that seems to get more people to raids, is shiny chances.
4041000	4047000	I'm sure that there will be a chance to get a shiny, but that chance is going to be very minimal.
4047000	4054000	I had a pretty funny Niantic day over the weekend. I didn't talk about this in my gaming week, but I met some friends at a local park here.
4054000	4061000	And there was a few of us, and so we quickly did the raid in Pokémon GO. None of us got a shiny.
4061000	4065000	In fact, I think the little shit ran for me anyway, but it was a Grudon. I already have one of those.
4065000	4072000	So we did the raid, and then we switched over to Ingress and made the park sevens so that we could farm it a little bit.
4072000	4076000	And then we switched to Harry Potter Wizards Unite so we could go do the fortress.
4076000	4082000	And I got to do my first five-person fortress battle, and that was pretty fun because they're very different than raids.
4082000	4088000	You have to kind of be like, okay, I'm strong against the 27. I'm going to take the 27. I'm going to hex the 29 for whoever's going in.
4088000	4095000	I see your low on health. I'm going to heal you. You might want to pop a potion. You have to kind of be communicating in a circle what's going on.
4095000	4097000	Maybe a Final Fantasy AR game.
4097000	4102000	That would be awesome. I'd be down for that. Final Fantasy XI AR.
4102000	4104000	I did a level five by myself.
4104000	4105000	Did you?
4105000	4108000	Yeah, I've done a five by myself, but that's as high as I've gone.
4108000	4114000	But what happens when you do it with multiple people, the difficulty really starts to go up.
4114000	4119000	And that was Alan's first time playing. Alan was the fifth, and he was gaining levels from just doing that.
4119000	4120000	We should try to do one.
4120000	4122000	It's fun. There's one not far from here.
4122000	4124000	I know. It's where the gym is.
4124000	4125000	Yes. Exactly.
4125000	4132000	Actually, I have all three by my house. I have a greenhouse, an inn, and a tower.
4132000	4140000	Yeah. So anyway, looking in chat, Act F saying, if it was shiny, they would have said it in the announcement. True. I know. I know.
4140000	4144000	I'm still excited for Armored Mewtwo. Yeah, it'll be nice to have that in the collection.
4144000	4146000	I don't have Mewtwo at all.
4146000	4155000	I really feel like I've been slipping on Pokemon Go. I've been terrible on gifts, and I just haven't been playing it as much because when I have my phone up and open, I'm playing either Ingress or Harry Potter.
4155000	4158000	I haven't been playing it as well either very much.
4158000	4166000	And honestly, I haven't really been doing the gifts, but I haven't been wearing my gacha recently. I know it's probably pretty dead right now.
4166000	4172000	But I think if I start doing running again, then I'll probably play it a bit more.
4172000	4178000	But it's just, I don't know. I just haven't been motivated to do it. I don't really want to.
4178000	4186000	Yeah. I mean, the Armored Mewtwo will be motivating for a day or two until you catch it, and then it'll be like, all right, back to trying to level in Harry Potter, I guess.
4186000	4193000	So, yeah. All right, moving on. Just one more story here before we get to the classic soundtrack of the month.
4193000	4200000	And this one is about kind of a last minute change. Last week, we had talked about, I think in rapid fire news, we talked about games that were coming out on PlayStation Plus.
4200000	4202000	Pro Evo. New.
4202000	4206000	Pro Evo was supposed to be one of the games, as well as Horizon Chase Turbo.
4206000	4211000	They did a last minute sub out. Pro Evo Soccer did not end up being one of the titles.
4211000	4218000	Instead, they added in the Detroit become human digital deluxe edition, which means you got heavy rain as well. Cool.
4218000	4224000	So that was what they said. Yeah. I mean, honestly, I'm like, cool, because I kind of wanted to pick up this game at some point anyway.
4224000	4230000	I'm sure a lot of people are like, not cool because we just bought it for like seven bucks in the sale recently or whatever.
4230000	4235000	Twenty bucks. But I guess that's part of the risk you take when you buy the games on a deep cut sale like that.
4235000	4242000	But really, no word on why the sub out happened. It wasn't explained in the blog post.
4242000	4250000	They didn't really. I mean, it seemed like the initial announcement kind of got a lot of people going like, boo, sports games, boo.
4250000	4255000	Because both end up, you know, racing and tennis end up being.
4255000	4260000	I don't know. I don't really see racing games as like, sorry, why did I say tennis, soccer, sports games and that being sports.
4260000	4265000	Yeah, I don't know. It's fine. Some people play sports games. There's going to be sports games once in a while.
4265000	4270000	Heck, Rocket League is a sports game. That freebie ended up being awesome. So, yeah.
4270000	4276000	I have that now. I forgot. I forgot all about that in my library of like nearly.
4276000	4280000	It looks like your Steam backlog. Yes. It's pretty much. Yeah. But anyway.
4280000	4286000	Yeah. Yeah. I don't know why they switched. And Konami says it wasn't them. Like some people were like, oh, it must have been.
4286000	4290000	Fuck Konami. They must have been the ones that like pulled out the rug under it and done it.
4290000	4295000	Nope. Konami says it wasn't their decision. So maybe you'll see it in a future month. I don't know.
4295000	4298000	I don't care because.
4298000	4303000	I have to say, I know some people that actually wanted PES 2019 for free.
4303000	4309000	Then again, I live in a country that loves football, real football. You play with your feet. Right.
4309000	4316000	And then guys, you know, says, excuse me, Sony did it because if you read the forum, people were pissed that it was pro soccer.
4316000	4323000	But pro Evo is cool. So fuck them. Plus, we had World Cup going on. Oh, that makes sense that it would be timed with the World Cup.
4323000	4327000	I didn't think about that. You know, I know they've there's been a lot a lot of chatter about World Cup in the past few days.
4327000	4333000	So it makes sense. Yeah, that does make sense. Don't want it. Don't want it. That's you.
4334000	4339000	I only have one World Cup soccer that I'm into and it lives in my house.
4339000	4344000	Although, go ladies. You know, I love those quotes that are going around.
4344000	4349000	Why don't they stop calling it women's soccer and just call it soccer, football, winning soccer.
4349000	4360000	Right. Anyway, that's like that's like when we had the WNBA here in SAC, which I miss because it's like the only world championship banner that was hanging at the old Arco Arena was from the WNBA.
4360000	4368000	Whereas like I think the Kings had like a 1950s Kansas City, wherever they were at before thing hanging.
4368000	4373000	That was it. It was like all the new stuff was because of the Monarchs and they get rid of the Monarchs.
4373000	4382000	You know, I met a good number of them when I worked at a GNC back in the day. Oh, oh, yeah, really, really just great people who loved what they did.
4382000	4387000	It's a bummer. I thought they were I thought part of them was bringing it back when they built that new arena and the new owner.
4387000	4391000	But that new arena is weird, though. I still haven't been in it. I feel like I'm going to fall out.
4391000	4395000	I still haven't been in it. I've been all around it, but I've yet to be inside that arena.
4395000	4401000	I went with Becky to see Lindsey Stirling and we ended up getting preached at because apparently she's super Catholic.
4401000	4408000	Oh, it's like kind of ruined the show for me. And I hate Christmas music anyway, but I love Lindsey Stirling.
4408000	4412000	And apparently I'm never going to go to another one of her concerts if she's going to preach during it.
4412000	4418000	Now, I would have been into Lindsey Buckingham seeing some Fleetwood Mac that I would have been into and they were there, too.
4418000	4426000	But the tickets were crazy. All right. Anyway, let's travel back when, you know, concert tickets didn't quite break the bank as much.
4426000	4431000	I guess maybe they've always broken the bank a little bit, but they weren't giving away games for free online, that's for sure.
4431000	4437000	It's a trip back in time for the classic game of the week. But what a twist.
4437000	4442000	In 2019, Dark Soccer says, you know, once a month I want to highlight a soundtrack.
4442000	4446000	So we're going to look at the classic soundtrack of the month.
4446000	4450000	So Dark Soccer, what did you pick for your classic soundtrack of the month this month?
4450000	4453000	I picked Quartet.
4453000	4455000	How about this one? There we go.
4455000	4460000	There we go. But the thing is, is it we can't turn it up, can we?
4460000	4461000	Not really.
4461000	4463000	Well, now they don't hear it a little bit.
4463000	4466000	The arcade music for Quartet is, of course, better than this,
4466000	4475000	but they did a really good job for a standard channel soundtrack for this game, for the Sega Master System.
4475000	4486000	And of course, I mean, Quartet, this music has come back in the past few years because it was given lyrics via Hatsune Miku.
4486000	4490000	So really, really good track, too.
4490000	4496000	But anyway, Quartet, it's just one of those happy pieces of music.
4496000	4499000	It was really catchy. You know, I'll be honest.
4499000	4505000	Now, the version for the Sega Master System actually did not come out under the name Quartet.
4505000	4511000	It came out under like a double target because you couldn't play for a player.
4511000	4515000	It was only up to two players because of the limitations of the system.
4515000	4521000	But just the music really just like made me happy, you know?
4521000	4525000	Playing through the game and you're hearing all this cheerful music while you're shooting aliens and shit.
4525000	4528000	I mean, how much better does that get?
4528000	4536000	And the sound designer for this one was Hayashi Katsuhiro.
4536000	4546000	And some of the other games that he did, he actually also did releases as Funky KH and Wooperkatsu.
4546000	4551000	So some of the other games that he did was Galaxy Force for Sega Master System.
4551000	4556000	He did the Hokuto no Ken game for Sega Master System, which was Fist of the North Star.
4556000	4562000	Fantasy Zone The Maze did Asterix and the Secret Mission.
4562000	4565000	You know about Asterix, right? The Viking?
4565000	4567000	Yes.
4567000	4571000	Global Defense, and of course Quartet here.
4571000	4578000	And a game called Ashura, which actually came out as Rambo Secret Commando something or the other.
4578000	4587000	But anyway, he's just done some really good games, including one of my favorites, Fantasy Zone The Maze.
4587000	4592000	But did just quite a number of really good stuff for the Sega Master System.
4592000	4597000	And even though the arcade version of this is just so iconic and so good,
4597000	4604000	I think for bringing it down for a Master System game that isn't even an FM-enabled soundtrack,
4604000	4606000	they did a pretty good job.
4606000	4608000	So there you go.
4608000	4611000	Classic soundtrack is going to be Quartet for the Sega Master System.
4611000	4615000	And I have to admit, this is not a game I'm as familiar with,
4615000	4622000	but in the little pieces that you sent along to be attached to the footage for Twitch Night,
4622000	4626000	I was like, again, for its time, really good.
4626000	4631000	Some of it is a little loud and shrill in the beginning if you're not used to hearing music in this era,
4631000	4636000	but I think it's neat. I like that it kind of has the different melodies and layers.
4636000	4641000	If you go back and listen, though, to the arcade version,
4641000	4645000	then that beginning of it will make quite a bit more sense.
4645000	4647000	Yeah, I'm going to have to do that.
4647000	4651000	But the arcade music is absolutely astonishing. It's so good.
4651000	4657000	And then I know I've played for you the Hatsune Miku cover.
4657000	4660000	Yeah, and I have the Hatsune Miku thing on PlayStation 3.
4660000	4662000	It's so good.
4662000	4667000	At any rate, it's the Sega Master System soundtrack for Quartet.
4667000	4669000	Great pick. Classic soundtrack of the month.
4669000	4676000	Sega Master System Quartet. Showing a little Master System love as well as the NES
4676000	4678000	and some of the other selections you've had earlier in the year.
4678000	4686000	I'm going to have to. I'm sure the 5200 qualified as 8-bit. The Atari 5200?
4686000	4688000	I think so, yes.
4688000	4691000	So I may have to go digging for a 5200 soundtrack.
4691000	4692000	All right, fun.
4692000	4693000	We'll see what happens.
4693000	4695000	All right. Well, they're your rules at the end of the day anyway.
4695000	4699000	Well, yeah, but I said this year is 8-bit. Next year is 16-bit.
4699000	4701000	No, I get it. I get it. All right.
4701000	4705000	So we're going to move on to our next segment, which was taped earlier today.
4705000	4711000	While we take a quick break here in studio, we're going to take a little more of a deep look at Mario Maker 2
4711000	4714000	and look at some listener levels. So let's get to that.
4715000	4718000	Hey, everybody. It's Rob in the office studio.
4718000	4724000	And I thought for our break this week on OLR, we could take a look at Super Mario Maker 2
4724000	4729000	and actually looking at some levels that I put out a tweet that said, hey, if you're out there listening to OLR
4729000	4733000	and you're making levels in Super Mario Maker 2, you should send me some that I can play here.
4733000	4735000	And then that way I can kind of show off the game a little bit
4735000	4739000	and how folks can go in there and look for different custom levels
4739000	4742000	and kind of what it looks like for some of you that may not have seen the game yet,
4742000	4744000	although I imagine a lot of you are playing it.
4744000	4751000	So I'm going to start with this course today from Jay and Hawk, who sent me this course,
4751000	4753000	and it's called Dark Forest.
4753000	4756000	So classic retro. No gimmicks. Good.
4756000	4762000	I didn't want to do the hell levels, so hopefully this will be a nice, smooth little level to check out.
4762000	4764000	Loki said he might do the hell levels later.
4764000	4766000	You all should hold him to that.
4766000	4770000	Anyway, and you can notice here it shows you what the percentage is that's cleared it,
4770000	4775000	which only 30% have cleared it. I don't know. Maybe this is a little tougher than it says.
4775000	4777000	And then you see a world record there as well.
4777000	4782000	So the fastest one gets saved, which is kind of fun, especially because speed running is all the rage.
4782000	4785000	Plus, which is kind of neat, you can actually download courses.
4785000	4789000	So if I actually wanted to save this so I could play it later whenever I want,
4789000	4794000	I could actually do the download, and that's part of the charm, I guess, of having it on the Switch,
4794000	4797000	that you can actually download levels to play again a little bit later.
4797000	4800000	But anyway, I'm going to get in there and play this one.
4800000	4802000	So it's pretty fast. It's going to download here.
4802000	4807000	And you can tell it's going to be a retro level because retro Mario shows up, 8-bit Mario.
4808000	4813000	And one thing I noticed right away, oh, this is kind of cool because it's a different type of background
4813000	4820000	you wouldn't put together with an 8-bit Mario game because part of what Mario Maker 2 has going on
4820000	4823000	is that you can kind of give some more themes to your different levels.
4823000	4831000	So certainly this kind of dark forest, or for those that have been listening to OLR a very long time,
4831000	4840000	going into the dark black forest is not a theme we saw in the original retro Mario.
4840000	4843000	So that's kind of neat.
4843000	4847000	And even though I've been playing this game a little bit this week, I certainly haven't seen everything.
4847000	4853000	And I've been mostly futzing around in story mode, so I haven't really made my own courses to see what all is available.
4853000	4858000	Oops, look at that, just as fast as I got that guy, I lost the fire.
4859000	4862000	Okay, the ice makes things tricky.
4862000	4869000	One of the fun parts of Mario Maker to me was always to see, oh my god, I'm a moron.
4869000	4873000	I slipped, my finger slipped, I swear.
4873000	4880000	One of the fun parts of Mario always was to me just kind of getting to see what some of the newer stuff looks like,
4880000	4884000	but in the old 8-bit retro style.
4884000	4887000	Oh good, I'm not the only one that got suckered right there.
4888000	4890000	Okay, wow.
4890000	4895000	Wow, wow, I should have just called this Watch Rob Be Terrible at Mario.
4895000	4899000	But you know what, it is harder to talk and play at the same time.
4899000	4906000	I challenge you guys to do it, because I have to keep talking, because I don't want the podcast people to be bored while I'm just sitting here playing.
4906000	4908000	But I also have to kind of focus on the game.
4908000	4911000	Oh, I almost got thwomped right there, but I got around it.
4911000	4914000	Okay, this time I should be able to keep the fire.
4914000	4917000	Yes, that will work much better.
4917000	4920000	So there's the lesson learned, at least.
4920000	4922000	Okay, and this time I should be able to...
4922000	4924000	Yes, there we go.
4924000	4925000	Making my way up.
4925000	4926000	Oh, there we go.
4926000	4928000	So we hit the top of the forest now.
4928000	4930000	Kind of a very different scenery.
4930000	4932000	So obviously with all these little piranha...
4932000	4934000	Well, they're not really piranha plants.
4934000	4936000	The metal plants?
4936000	4939000	Different types of piranha plants? I don't know what you call those.
4939000	4943000	But with them all sitting there, you can't just walk across that.
4943000	4946000	Good, more fire.
4946000	4951000	If all else fails, use fire, right?
4951000	4953000	Okay, so I think...
4953000	4957000	Ooh, there's some bullets here.
4957000	4958000	A free one-up to make up for the ones...
4958000	4961000	Oh, I hate those hammer guys, but luckily he was...
4961000	4962000	Oh, look, another one-up.
4962000	4963000	It's rain one-ups.
4963000	4966000	Okay.
4966000	4968000	I'm greedy, so I want to get some of these coins,
4968000	4970000	but I also don't want to get hit by the bullets, so okay.
4970000	4972000	Hopefully I knocked that piranha out.
4972000	4973000	Okay.
4973000	4975000	Oh my god! Oh my god!
4975000	4978000	Oh, no!
4978000	4979000	Saved!
4979000	4983000	Clutch, hacks.
4983000	4984000	Oh, I fell.
4984000	4990000	Okay, for those on the podcast, I fell in a one Mario body-wide thing of water,
4990000	4994000	and luckily I was able to slam the A key fast enough to keep myself afloat.
4994000	4996000	Oh, that was nasty.
4996000	4997000	That was nasty.
4997000	4998000	But yay, I did it.
4998000	4999000	I did it.
4999000	5000000	Good course.
5000000	5001000	Oh, my green screen is terrible.
5001000	5002000	Sorry, guys.
5002000	5004000	Different colors set it off.
5004000	5005000	But that was good.
5005000	5006000	Yay.
5006000	5007000	So I'm going to say I like it.
5007000	5010000	I was only about 30 seconds off from the record there,
5010000	5013000	and I can actually leave my own comments, so I think I will do that.
5013000	5015000	I'm going to leave a comment.
5015000	5018000	And what's fun is that they have different stamps this time,
5018000	5021000	so it's a little different than the Wii U version
5021000	5023000	because you can't just put the stamps anywhere,
5023000	5025000	so they just kind of have these cards.
5025000	5029000	So I'll just do the Princess Peach because we all love Princess Peach.
5029000	5031000	Cool idea.
5031000	5032000	And it was.
5032000	5037000	I liked that it was a very retro, kind of easy thing that fit a few things in there.
5037000	5039000	It was a good little warm-up.
5039000	5042000	And it wasn't too easy because it had some nasty parts that got me
5042000	5045000	and almost once again at the end there, so nice.
5045000	5047000	All right, so I could play it again if I wanted to,
5047000	5050000	or I can exit and pick a different level.
5050000	5053000	So I'm going to do that.
5053000	5057000	And so what I'll do is I'm going to go to ID,
5057000	5059000	and I'm going to search for another level.
5059000	5064000	So another code that I got was for our pal Bobby Blackwolf.
5064000	5068000	So he gave me his code that I'm going to put in here right now,
5068000	5071000	and I'm sure he wouldn't mind if you want to play his level as well,
5071000	5075000	R0T V21 R5G.
5075000	5079000	And I've got to see this because he calls this level Flappin' Mario.
5079000	5082000	Oh, he's got a lot of people that have checked this out. Good for him.
5082000	5087000	Not inspired by anything, just Mario going for a leisurely swim.
5087000	5089000	And there's a lot of comments. Dang, Bobby.
5089000	5091000	Bobby went viral with this one.
5091000	5093000	All right, well, let's check it out.
5093000	5095000	So this is a Mario 3D World.
5095000	5099000	So Mario 3D World is kind of the new addition to Mario Maker,
5099000	5103000	is that you can actually have the cat Mario and all that too.
5103000	5104000	That's kind of fun.
5104000	5107000	Oh, my. Wow.
5107000	5111000	Okay, I was not expecting the speed.
5111000	5113000	Oh, it's an auto scroll. I see.
5113000	5115000	So that's where the...
5115000	5120000	Okay, I thought it was just going to be kind of free floating through the level.
5120000	5123000	But it has little applause effects too.
5123000	5125000	Love it.
5125000	5129000	Wow, all these people putting stamps going. Be careful.
5129000	5130000	Okay.
5130000	5133000	So, yeah, if you get trapped behind a pipe, you are...
5133000	5135000	Oh, oh, how about that?
5135000	5140000	He put some rewards at the end here to make that a little bit more worth your time.
5140000	5144000	So, yeah, people are actually stamping their comments throughout the level too.
5146000	5148000	Pretty cool.
5148000	5151000	I like this. See, that's cool because it's like...
5151000	5154000	And this is a lot of what we're going to start seeing in Mario Maker 2.
5154000	5157000	And we were seeing it in the first game quite a bit already.
5157000	5160000	And seeing a little big planet as well,
5160000	5164000	is that I'm giving you this particular kind of toolbox to use.
5164000	5167000	What are some different ideas that you can come up with?
5167000	5172000	And so the fact that, you know, it wasn't like necessarily a Mario level,
5172000	5175000	but with something kind of inspired by something else,
5175000	5177000	that was pretty cool.
5177000	5179000	So I got to hand it to Bobby Black Wolf.
5179000	5181000	That was a pretty neat level.
5181000	5183000	Yeah, and I'm fast forwarding through all these comments.
5183000	5185000	He's got a lot of people, cool ideas. Nice.
5185000	5187000	Hell yeah.
5187000	5189000	Nice. Good job, Bobby.
5189000	5190000	So I'm going to say I like it.
5190000	5192000	As tempted as I am to hit the boo button and be a jerk.
5192000	5193000	I'm not going to do that.
5193000	5196000	And then I will also leave my own comment.
5197000	5198000	Let's see, what can I leave?
5198000	5200000	I'm going to leave one that says,
5203000	5205000	I'll leave the beat it because I beat it.
5208000	5209000	Nice.
5209000	5210000	All right.
5210000	5212000	So there's a couple of custom levels.
5212000	5214000	And just before I wrap this video up,
5214000	5216000	just to show you a couple other things,
5216000	5219000	in the course world here in Super Mario Maker 2,
5219000	5222000	you will notice that you can actually look.
5222000	5225000	Oh, I got, actually you'll notice I have this little wardrobe over here.
5225000	5228000	So it looks like I got a new shirt because I've played a variety of courses.
5228000	5230000	I can actually change my outfit and shirts.
5230000	5232000	Who knew shirts could be animated.
5232000	5233000	So that's a thing.
5233000	5236000	So I guess I got I got this new shirt.
5236000	5238000	I like the animated one that I got a little better.
5238000	5239000	So I'm going to stay on that.
5239000	5243000	And I had the skirt on because I thought it was cute.
5243000	5247000	You know, gender is merely a suggestion when it comes to dressing up.
5247000	5250000	But if I want to, I could put on shorts or whatever.
5250000	5253000	But I'm going to stay in the denim skirt for now until something better comes along.
5253000	5256000	I also love that you can put on like baby clothes and stuff.
5256000	5258000	That's like very, yeah.
5258000	5262000	And then you can change your expression as well in there.
5262000	5264000	So it's pretty cool.
5264000	5268000	And you can also, you know, you can do network play with others.
5268000	5272000	You do the endless challenge where it just keeps downloading level after level after level.
5272000	5274000	And then, of course, you can see leaderboards.
5274000	5278000	So if we wanted to see like what are the big levels right now in the game,
5278000	5280000	there's these course makers.
5280000	5285000	But then I think you would also go to, where's the one where you see like the levels?
5285000	5287000	I thought there was one for levels.
5287000	5288000	Maybe not.
5288000	5292000	Maybe you just see the makers.
5292000	5295000	Because then the players will just show you how many they've done.
5295000	5296000	I love that.
5296000	5299000	The first person has 6969.
5299000	5301000	Great.
5301000	5304000	I thought there was a way where it would show you courses as opposed to just the course.
5304000	5306000	Oh, hello.
5306000	5307000	Hello.
5307000	5310000	So you've got to go to the courses menu, not the leaderboards.
5310000	5311000	There we go.
5311000	5316000	So right now I'm on like start because these are other levels from my friends of mine and stuff.
5316000	5320000	And then you can go to hot courses.
5320000	5324000	So these are, I guess, up and coming ones or ones that were recently published.
5324000	5327000	And then probably popular courses is going to be where all the, yeah.
5327000	5332000	So these are the big courses that are going on right now,
5332000	5336000	including this one from Super Mario Brothers 3, which looks like it's just some snowy slide.
5336000	5337000	All right.
5337000	5338000	I got to check it out.
5338000	5341000	I'll check it out just a little bit real quick here and then we'll wrap up here.
5341000	5346000	So this is an idea of like what is super popular in Mario Maker 2 right now.
5346000	5351000	So.
5351000	5352000	Okay.
5352000	5353000	So you get a little power.
5353000	5355000	Well, everybody, this course is so popular.
5355000	5361000	People are leaving their own course codes at the end.
5361000	5362000	Okay.
5362000	5363000	So it was just that snowy slide at the beginning.
5364000	5366000	People are leaving all these hints.
5366000	5367000	Go up.
5367000	5368000	I can't go up.
5368000	5369000	I need to.
5369000	5370000	All right.
5370000	5371000	I guess I'm going in the pipe.
5371000	5372000	Yay.
5372000	5373000	Another slide.
5373000	5374000	And jump.
5374000	5375000	Slide.
5375000	5376000	Jump.
5376000	5377000	Slide.
5377000	5378000	Oh, fireworks.
5378000	5379000	Festive.
5379000	5380000	Yay.
5380000	5383000	I got one up.
5383000	5388000	Music's all chipper and fun.
5388000	5389000	Okay.
5389000	5392000	Oh, I probably have to slide.
5393000	5395000	And let's see.
5395000	5396000	It says don't go down.
5396000	5397000	All right.
5397000	5398000	Wow.
5398000	5399000	Everybody's ruining this with their hands.
5399000	5401000	Now, yes, you can turn those off.
5401000	5402000	I just chose not to.
5402000	5404000	Don't go down there either.
5404000	5406000	Wow.
5406000	5416000	The Internet's just telling you how to do it.
5416000	5418000	Go here for a one up.
5418000	5419000	Wow.
5419000	5422000	This is like easy mode when everybody tells you how to do it.
5422000	5423000	Okay.
5423000	5424000	Wow.
5424000	5429000	Then it gets all Silent Hill on you when you get on this little ramp going up.
5429000	5430000	Okay.
5430000	5433000	I don't know why that happened.
5433000	5438000	Oh, gosh, darn it.
5438000	5440000	Oh, no.
5440000	5441000	Okay.
5441000	5447000	So you kind of have to do this ramp.
5447000	5448000	Land here.
5448000	5450000	It's fun.
5456000	5459000	So this is definitely just like doing slopes, jumping.
5459000	5464000	Oh, and they use kind of the switches to move you one way versus the other.
5464000	5467000	That's pretty clever.
5467000	5469000	How about that?
5469000	5470000	Okay.
5470000	5474000	I can see why people like that one because sliding down hills is fun, clearly.
5474000	5476000	So says the Internet.
5476000	5479000	And I could leave another comment on top.
5479000	5481000	Can I even leave a comment?
5481000	5488000	They're like, I'm going to say beat it and see that.
5488000	5489000	Oh, it did post it.
5489000	5492000	Maybe it just rolls off over after 99 comments.
5492000	5493000	It just kind of rolls off.
5493000	5494000	The next one goes on.
5494000	5495000	There you go.
5495000	5496000	All right.
5496000	5497000	We'll wrap up with that.
5497000	5500000	So we had two listener levels and a popular level.
5500000	5501000	At least what's popular right now.
5501000	5503000	Sliding down snowy hills.
5503000	5504000	Sounds like a plan to me.
5504000	5507000	Anyway, that's going to do it for our little break segment this week.
5507000	5511000	And we're going to go back live now to the studio.
5511000	5513000	Thank you, me.
5513000	5514000	That was fun.
5514000	5515000	Mario maker, too.
5515000	5520000	Yeah, I just love seeing the stuff that people come up with, especially like the really outside the box type of stuff.
5520000	5522000	And it just seems like there's more to play with now.
5522000	5527000	Mario maker, too, that every new tool you give people, you're going to see all these different types of levels with it.
5527000	5532000	Like, I really thought that was clever in that last level I played that, like, you had to go through it one way.
5532000	5533000	It was kind of like a figure eight.
5533000	5534000	You had to go through it one way.
5534000	5535000	The switch kind of made you do that.
5535000	5537000	And then you got to the top, you hit the switch and you go the other way.
5537000	5538000	That's kind of neat.
5538000	5541000	So I'm looking forward to being able to do like more multiplayer.
5541000	5543000	Like, I know that's something we're waiting for the online.
5543000	5545000	I didn't explore that a lot yet in the game or in the video.
5545000	5547000	So there's still more to do.
5547000	5550000	But yeah, I enjoyed those levels.
5550000	5551000	Thank you.
5551000	5555000	Thank you to those who submitted over on Twitter.
5555000	5560000	And yeah, thanks for watching me play the popular levels, too.
5560000	5561000	All right.
5561000	5563000	Let's get back into some more news.
5563000	5565000	Getting into some rapid fire news tonight, Loki.
5565000	5566000	Yes.
5566000	5567000	So this is pretty awesome.
5567000	5575000	They have a HD remake or HD master of Donkey Kong Country Returns.
5575000	5583000	Unfortunately, it's only on the Nvidia Shield in China, which you may remember the Nvidia Shield in China has been getting some Nintendo games.
5583000	5587000	So they've had some older Wii games that were available on there.
5587000	5590000	So you have Legends of the Twilight Princess, Super Mario Galaxy.
5590000	5592000	I'm sorry, is the IQ.
5592000	5594000	No, it's an Nvidia Shield.
5594000	5597000	OK, but I thought that that also is what worked on there.
5597000	5599000	I might be getting confused with something else.
5599000	5600000	Yeah.
5600000	5603000	So they have over there in.
5603000	5615000	In China, they have these Wii games that are available and they run really well, like 10 AP 60 FPS, which begs the question, why are they not on the switch?
5615000	5621000	Because the Nvidia Shield is part of the same chipset as the Nintendo Switch.
5621000	5623000	You should be able to do it.
5623000	5626000	But for whatever reason, it's not available.
5626000	5635000	So I'm sure there's fun workarounds to get that available onto your own Nvidia Shield if you have one of those.
5635000	5643000	But it's pretty neat to see that they've got this remaster completed, which is a matter of actually being able to play it.
5643000	5650000	But something that you might be able to play pretty soon, though, is actually some of these games that are available for free with Twitch Prime.
5650000	5660000	So funny enough, like I know that they used to offer games and I thought all that stuff was available through like the little dropdown that we have in Twitch here where you can see the Prime loot.
5660000	5664000	But I guess have I been missing games for the last few months because I haven't seen games in there.
5664000	5666000	It's always been different other things.
5667000	5671000	And then finally, I went to the actual Prime loot.
5671000	5673000	Yeah, they have like a page for the games as well.
5673000	5676000	And there's like several games on there that I could get for free.
5676000	5681000	So one of those games on the Prime loot page is actually Yooka-Laylee.
5681000	5688000	So you can actually get that right now if you go to your Prime loot page, which I know a lot of you guys that are listening have Twitch Prime.
5688000	5690000	So it might be worth checking out.
5690000	5692000	And then that's going to be available.
5692000	5694000	And also dropping your free sub on Fog Network.
5694000	5695000	Add that in there.
5695000	5696000	Yes, of course.
5696000	5699000	And then, of course, these are going to be available until August 1st.
5699000	5701000	The other games that are available on there as well.
5701000	5705000	The Escapists for the King and Cultist Simulator.
5705000	5708000	So go check those out now because they're free.
5708000	5709000	And free is good.
5709000	5711000	Well, free if you have Prime.
5711000	5712000	Right.
5712000	5713000	Totally free.
5713000	5714000	Yes, I get it. I get it.
5715000	5722000	Hey, so another game that many of you I think have played is Cuphead.
5722000	5726000	And you're probably waiting the DLC that they're working on for Cuphead.
5726000	5729000	The Delicious Last Course, which I love that because it's DLC.
5729000	5730000	It's cute.
5730000	5732000	Unfortunately, it is going to be delayed a little bit.
5732000	5734000	They are delaying it until 2020.
5734000	5738000	But what's interesting is that part of the reason that they're doing it,
5738000	5740000	co-director Chad Moldenhauer said, quote,
5740000	5748000	the development of the original game taught us a great deal about the importance of making things in a way that's healthy and sustainable for our team.
5748000	5754000	So part of the reason that they're doing this is so that their team doesn't have to crunch so hard to make it by any other frame.
5754000	5755000	So, you know, good.
5755000	5756000	So it's all right.
5756000	5761000	We'll wait a little longer for it and it'll hopefully be that much better for it.
5761000	5767000	Something that's getting patched a little sooner, a patch, not DLC, but a patch is Bloodstains Switch version,
5767000	5771000	because apparently there are some issues where I'm kind of even I was kind of commenting on that earlier.
5771000	5775000	I'm like, graphically, it just feels like something's a little bit off.
5775000	5780000	But apparently the switch is going to be getting a patch.
5780000	5786000	The ETA for that right now is July 15th to fix a graphical bug in the game,
5786000	5792000	as well as some bugs featuring HD rumble, random crashes and input delay.
5792000	5797000	The chest bug problem will also be worked on for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
5797000	5801000	Those patches will be coming out very soon if they're not already out.
5801000	5804000	So it does seem like they are continuing to work on and improve the game.
5804000	5810000	So I guess that's a good thing, you know, even though they worked for a very long time on it.
5810000	5812000	But, you know, it's it is what it is.
5812000	5816000	It was a small team and they didn't have a whole lot, you know, a whole lot of resources.
5816000	5819000	So, you know, they did what they could in the amount of time.
5819000	5822000	So I'm glad to see at least they're not just like walking away from it,
5822000	5825000	that they are going to continue to improve it, especially on the switch.
5825000	5828000	So, you know, and dark soccer, what do you have?
5828000	5832000	Sorry, I was just buying ukulele, getting ukulele.
5832000	5835000	Taking that tip right now. Yeah, pretty much.
5835000	5839000	So Squenix, we love Squenix.
5839000	5844000	They are releasing a Chrono Trigger orchestral album.
5844000	5850000	It looks like the release date is going to be looks like August 7th.
5850000	5857000	There's another one that says October 27th.
5857000	5860000	Just looking at the cover on here.
5860000	5864000	But the standalone album will be $30, but the box set will be $74.
5864000	5869000	So, yeah, it launches on September 7th, 2019 and then there are going to be concerts.
5869000	5870000	So those were the dates.
5870000	5875000	September 7th, 2019 and October 27th, 2019 in Tokyo.
5875000	5881000	No, sorry, the first one is in Osaka on September 7th and the second one is in Tokyo October 27th.
5881000	5883000	So someone send me a plane ticket, please.
5883000	5889000	And then last but not least, there will be a Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3 The Black Order
5889000	5893000	and it's going to be part of the Marvel Games San Diego Comic-Con panel.
5893000	5904000	So they will be having the panel at SDCC this year on Thursday, July 18th at 1.30 PST.
5904000	5910000	And it's said that they are going to be showing all the versions, including the Switch.
5910000	5911000	So there you go.
5911000	5914000	Apparently, they're also going to have a few other goodies announced there.
5914000	5919000	So, hey, I was hearing some stuff that maybe the new Avengers game is going to have a little more as well.
5919000	5922000	So I'm not excited about that.
5923000	5925000	I love Ultimate Alliance, though.
5925000	5926000	Yeah.
5926000	5928000	I played the shit out of that game.
5928000	5931000	Actually, I learned about the series through Tiara.
5931000	5936000	She came she was visiting one time and we played the stew out of it.
5936000	5938000	Oh, have you come to join us, sir?
5938000	5940000	We have we are joined by a smoosh.
5940000	5944000	Yeah, but sadly, Mr. Smoosh is in elevated, so they can't really see.
5944000	5946000	Oh, he's he jumped up in the guest chair.
5946000	5949000	Is that so I could scoot the chair over.
5949000	5950000	I know, right.
5950000	5952000	He'll jump out of the chair when you do it.
5952000	5953000	Yeah, I guarantee it.
5953000	5959000	He's he's looking for a way up on the kitchen counter because that's his new favorite place to hang out.
5959000	5961000	Well, maybe I'll do it.
5961000	5964000	Check at Pitittles on Instagram.
5964000	5965000	That's Midna's Instagram.
5965000	5968000	P a t i d d l e s.
5968000	5969000	There will be pictures of the smoosh.
5969000	5970000	Yes.
5970000	5973000	And technically Mr. Smoosh has his own Instagram as well.
5973000	5976000	So, yeah, but I got you on your followers.
5976000	5977000	It's fine.
5977000	5978000	All right.
5978000	5986000	All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates as we travel around the world and check out what's coming out in the US, Japan and the UK.
5986000	5987000	Yes.
5987000	5992000	So we've got Senran Kagura Peach Ball coming out on Nintendo Switch.
5992000	5998000	We've got Umehara Kawase Fresh on Nintendo Switch.
5998000	6009000	Dr. Mario World on iOS and Android and Blazing Chrome on PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and PlayStation four.
6009000	6013000	And it looks like a side very.
6013000	6014000	I have no idea how to pronounce this.
6014000	6017000	You can't have this big consonants in a row.
6017000	6025000	Sive Varia Delta that's on Switch and PlayStation four and Tiny Metal Full Metal Rumble.
6025000	6030000	That's on Nintendo Switch and PC.
6030000	6032000	And then I believe this is still this week.
6032000	6035000	Dragon Quest Builders two on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation four.
6035000	6038000	And finally, God Eater three on Nintendo Switch.
6038000	6039000	That's it.
6039000	6040000	All right.
6040000	6042000	Busy, busy traveling over to Japan.
6042000	6045000	PlayStation four is a little slow this week in Japan.
6045000	6051000	The only releases are like some deluxe editions that are coming out for Assassin's Creed origin as well as Far Cry five.
6051000	6055000	Those are the really only the releases on the PlayStation four in Japan this week.
6055000	6056000	Nintendo Switch.
6056000	6058000	A little more hopping.
6058000	6060000	God Eater three is released this week.
6060000	6062000	Also on July 11th.
6062000	6063000	Puruchara Friends.
6063000	6065000	Hoppy Chan to Sanrio characters.
6065000	6069000	I can only imagine that is the world's cutest.
6069000	6072000	When are you going to start doing Japanese release dates?
6072000	6074000	You know what I've offered.
6074000	6078000	But it means it's and so it's Hoppy Chan and Sanrio.
6078000	6080000	OK, I got it. I got it.
6080000	6084000	So it's a crossover festival thing.
6084000	6090000	You get to oh, they take care of your town and you have all these accessories and patterns and things like that.
6090000	6091000	Well, that sounds like fun.
6091000	6093000	Yeah, sounds very vaguely Animal Crossing ish.
6093000	6095000	It does, but it doesn't kind of look like that in the screenshots.
6095000	6096000	I think it's kind of a different sort of thing.
6096000	6101000	So anyway, there's some other releases as well.
6101000	6103000	No, actually, I lied.
6103000	6105000	That's really a God Eater three is kind of a big release there.
6105000	6107000	So that is it for Japanese releases.
6107000	6108000	How about the UK?
6108000	6109000	Dark soccer.
6109000	6110000	That's soccer.
6110000	6111000	Sakura.
6111000	6112000	Sakura.
6112000	6118000	Anyway, coming out on the 11th for Switch, we have God Eater three.
6118000	6122000	Also on the 11th, we have Dragon Quest Builders two and Dragon Quest Builders.
6122000	6124000	Oh, we have the PlayStation and the Switch version.
6124000	6126000	Sorry, they did them separately.
6126000	6130000	Also, Hollow Knight on July 11th.
6130000	6133000	And that's it for this week.
6133000	6136000	And guess what?
6136000	6138000	We still ain't got any mail.
6138000	6140000	I checked.
6140000	6141000	I'm not slacking.
6141000	6145000	Yeah, it's been a little slow and there's not even now there's no drag race to talk about.
6145000	6148000	So now what are we because drag races is out of season.
6148000	6150000	Well, I can talk about meeting Evie Oddly.
6150000	6151000	Okay.
6151000	6152000	Make it quick though.
6152000	6153000	Make it quick.
6153000	6157000	I was I was down for Drag Con and we were going to see the Belay Brothers Big Drag Ball event.
6157000	6164000	And coming out of some SUV is this person in a bear kigurumi.
6164000	6168000	Lo and behold, it's Evie Oddly in full face wearing a bear kigurumi.
6168000	6169000	The end.
6169000	6172000	I will say drag related.
6172000	6180000	I what came up on a Facebook memory recently is when I shaved the last time I shaved my beard was a year ago because I performed
6180000	6185000	Mrs. Peacock in a local production of Clue the movie on stage.
6185000	6187000	But that was so I really hope we get to do it again.
6187000	6190000	I thought they were going to do it again this year, but they opted not to.
6190000	6192000	What if everyone did Grease?
6192000	6193000	Who would you want to be if you did Grease?
6193000	6196000	Grease is difficult because it's still it.
6196000	6198000	Well, no, it still is a play.
6198000	6201000	So it's a little harder to get the rights to do something like that because they want you to do the play.
6201000	6202000	What about Grease 2?
6202000	6204000	No, Grease 2 would be different.
6204000	6205000	Oh, that would be God.
6205000	6206000	I've seen that movie so long.
6206000	6207000	Would you want to be Frenchy?
6207000	6208000	Maybe.
6208000	6209000	Or would you want to be Michelle Pfeiffer?
6209000	6212000	I think I would rather just kind of host it and not be in it and watch it.
6212000	6215000	You should come out just in drag as a pink lady.
6215000	6216000	OK, sure.
6216000	6217000	Why not?
6217000	6218000	You should do it.
6218000	6219000	It'll be fun.
6219000	6221000	We'll put you in a ponytail with a full beard.
6221000	6222000	Back into some gaming news.
6222000	6223000	Loki.
6223000	6224000	All right.
6224000	6231000	So apparently the developer of Alan Wake has been able to acquire the series back from Microsoft.
6231000	6238000	So Remedy basically noticing that for the first half of the year period of 2019,
6238000	6249000	Remedy Entertainment PLC records approximately 2.5 million euros of royalties from its previous release of games as a one-time income.
6249000	6254000	Those royalties are paid to Remedy during the second half of the year period 2019.
6254000	6259000	In relation to this, the publishing rights of Alan Wake games are reverted to Remedy.
6259000	6266000	This one-time income does not include or does not significantly affect Remedy's full year result.
6266000	6277000	Because as previously reported, the company continues to invest in developing new games, the success of which will have a greater impact on the company's full year revenue and result.
6277000	6283000	So it's cool that they get it back and maybe we'll get some more in the series.
6283000	6285000	And it sounds like they're working on some new stuff.
6285000	6289000	So, yeah, I mean, I thought they were going to do an Alan Wake sequel at some point.
6289000	6293000	I mean, there was the American Nightmare kind of spinoff thing, and I thought they were going to do a full sequel at some point.
6293000	6297000	But they ended up canceling it, and some of the ideas or whatever ended up in Quantum Break.
6297000	6302000	So I don't know if maybe this whole, like, they're getting it back might be a way for them to tackle that sequel again.
6302000	6305000	I don't know. I would love for them to do another Alan Wake game.
6305000	6309000	But Alan Wake also, you want to talk about a game that took a long time to make?
6309000	6313000	That Alan Wake game was announced as a launch title for the 360.
6313000	6317000	It didn't come out for, like, four years after the damn console was out.
6317000	6321000	So if they want to do something, it's going to take them a good long time to work on it.
6321000	6325000	What this would mean, though, is that they could release, like, an Alan Wake remastered for PlayStation 4 or something, or Switch.
6325000	6326000	Yeah, that'd be cool.
6326000	6328000	That would be interesting.
6328000	6332000	So, hope they can retain all the music rights, though, because they have some great music stuff in it.
6332000	6339000	So, all right. Yeah, and this 200 Matt in chat says that Blair Witch game that was shown at E3 looks so much like Alan Wake.
6339000	6344000	Yeah, that was, when that first came up, I was like, wait, are they doing another Alan Wake game?
6344000	6348000	Like, when I first saw that, I was getting, and then it started to get a little too violent.
6348000	6351000	I was like, I don't remember Alan Wake being this gory.
6351000	6354000	And so I was like, I don't think it is. So it was something else.
6354000	6357000	So, excuse me.
6357000	6367000	So, moving on to a story about Zelda Breath of the Wild's sequel, which I know a lot of you are very excited about, including Present Company.
6367000	6374000	Apparently, some hints, some big hints out there in job listings.
6374000	6384000	Some recently posted Japanese job listings for Zelda Breath of the Wild are posted for a terrain designer and level designer.
6384000	6391000	Apparently, yeah, because they're hiring for these things, it's looking to be that there may be a little bit of a bigger deal.
6391000	6399000	There is standard information on all the postings, but apparently the terrain designer will work on things that are, quote, field dungeons.
6399000	6404000	And the level designer will do, quote, game event, dungeon, field planning.
6404000	6409000	And then the level designer will also work on creating and tweaking enemies as well.
6409000	6417000	So, yeah, I mean, the original Breath of the Wild kind of had those divine beasts, and then they had like those very small little temples.
6417000	6424000	But it would be very interesting if the concept of dungeons from like the original Legend of Zelda, if you will, you know, like nine dungeons or whatever.
6424000	6426000	It would be interesting if that might be something that takes place in the sequel.
6426000	6432000	It makes sense, though, because the game will, the whole thing starts with underneath Hyrule Castle.
6432000	6438000	And those, the area, I mean, if you watch through the trailer, they were in a big cavernous underground.
6438000	6443000	So it would seem likely that a dungeon, I mean, they've already kind of teased it.
6443000	6449000	Yeah, and Dark Tetsuya says in our chat room over Twitch TV slash VOG Network, that was my most wanted thing.
6449000	6454000	Having it open world like the first game, but actual dungeons this time.
6454000	6455000	So, yeah.
6455000	6456000	It would be pretty cool.
6456000	6457000	It would be cool.
6457000	6459000	And I would really like it if your save file carries over.
6459000	6465000	Because then, like, you know, perhaps it like affects how you work with Zelda, for example, if you've got all the memories or not.
6465000	6470000	Or if you just, you know, bed run right up to the end and she's like, do you remember me now?
6470000	6471000	Sorry, princess.
6471000	6473000	Excuse me.
6473000	6474000	Zelda will remember this.
6474000	6478000	I actually would rather play a Zelda with her magic.
6478000	6483000	I do hope they make it so that you can kind of control different characters. I mean, that'd be very cool.
6483000	6490000	It makes me think that she would be playable because she has short hair and it's easier to animate shorter hair.
6490000	6491000	We'll see.
6491000	6492000	So, anyway.
6492000	6493000	All right.
6493000	6496000	Well, Darsar, you have a very kind of interesting different story for us.
6496000	6500000	I do, because, you know, I like to throw on the other angles of video gaming.
6500000	6504000	And how better to do that than talking about African swine fever?
6504000	6508000	African swine fever has a lot to do with video games, don't you think?
6508000	6509000	Okay.
6509000	6514000	The African swine fever, there is outbreaks in Europe and Asia.
6514000	6520000	And the disease is actually making farmers kill a lot of their pigs.
6520000	6525000	And it's driving up pork prices for those who are of the pork consuming persuasion.
6525000	6530000	So American farmers are pretty much afraid that the disease is going to pop up here.
6530000	6537000	Because there was a different virus back in 2013 that spread through 33 states and wiped out 7 million pigs.
6537000	6540000	Which was 10% of our nation's swine population.
6540000	6543000	So how are they trying to combat this?
6543000	6546000	Believe it or not, biosecurity is a thing.
6546000	6556000	And the University of Vermont is now using video games to predict how human behavior impacts animal disease outbreaks.
6556000	6560000	And it's a $7.4 million biosecurity initiative.
6560000	6561000	Right now.
6562000	6569000	And they are using this to generate projections that would benefit the agriculture industry.
6569000	6575000	So basically they would track pig diarrhea virus through the farms.
6575000	6584000	But then, and one of the researchers named Gabriella Bucchini says, what happens on a farm doesn't stay on the farm.
6584000	6587000	But then they're going to use this.
6587000	6592000	And one of her other quotes on here says, once you learn how people behave, the next question is how do we apply this to a larger system?
6592000	6605000	So their data, they're having players go through the video game and make decisions about how much they were willing to risk to expose their herd to basically what farmers face on the daily.
6605000	6610000	And they were simulating how the disease would spread if it were introduced.
6610000	6621000	So they're using the combination of human interaction as well as swine interaction to see how humans affect the spread of animal diseases.
6621000	6626000	Shehulk10 in our chat quite simply says, science and games are fun.
6626000	6632000	True. And I just think this is such a good application for it because you can have people involved in it.
6632000	6637000	And it's really a very experimental game. But then again, how many people sit and play Harvest Moon?
6637000	6639000	True.
6640000	6647000	Now Questbuster in chat took the words right out of my mouth because I was thinking of this exact same thing while you were talking about that with the diseases and all.
6647000	6654000	Questbuster says, reminds me of when World of Warcraft's blood plague event that ran out of control was actually studied by scientists.
6654000	6661000	I was thinking of that too because I think there were a few papers in epidemiology posted based off of that.
6661000	6666000	It was fascinating how some people would really try to run and hide to get away from it.
6666000	6671000	Some people were running into populated areas just to purposely spread it and kind of like how the human...
6671000	6674000	I think I had stopped playing right before that went on.
6674000	6677000	That happened at the end of vanilla.
6677000	6679000	But I played vanilla.
6679000	6681000	I played vanilla and I hated it, remember?
6681000	6682000	Oh yeah, yeah.
6682000	6683000	Because I hated all the weapon grinding?
6683000	6684000	Yeah.
6684000	6687000	Isn't there like another expansion out now because I'm not playing it?
6687000	6689000	Like the Rise of Azshara?
6689000	6695000	They are on, oh god no, I think they're on Legion and then Battle for Azeroth is the one I'm on right now.
6695000	6698000	Because I think they were teasing the Rise of Azshara.
6698000	6699000	That was a patch.
6699000	6700000	A patch, oh whatever.
6700000	6701000	Yeah.
6701000	6705000	Ikuma JP says, next zombie pigs.
6705000	6710000	Zombie pigs versus war pigs and they play that album.
6710000	6714000	Well I'm glad this wasn't just a story about like, does Stardew Valley prepare you to be a real farmer?
6714000	6719000	But I'm sure even games like that they learn things from, you know, just to get about how people play them.
6719000	6725000	Well and the next evolution of this is taking it from game to a true sim.
6725000	6732000	But they're doing this to get that human behavioral element to it that you cannot simulate.
6732000	6738000	And so I think it's a really good way to get that kind of input from real life people.
6738000	6743000	That you've got all across, you know, various skill levels in the farming and agriculture.
6743000	6749000	And you know, a word I'm thinking of that also ends in culture that has to do with animals.
6749000	6752000	I'll just say animal husbandry because it's fun to say that.
6752000	6757000	You know, but dealing with, you know, dealing with animals.
6757000	6760000	So I think it's a really novel approach to it.
6760000	6768000	And honestly I'd love to see other industries take the same route to see what happens when a human makes X decision.
6768000	6773000	And then your projections go off of this continuously variable data.
6773000	6774000	Right.
6774000	6776000	Because what gets more random than the human?
6776000	6778000	Ain't that the truth.
6778000	6780000	Some of us are just extra.
6780000	6784000	VidPower in chat points out there's even a corrupted blood incident page on Wikipedia.
6784000	6787000	It's that important to culture, I guess, if you will.
6787000	6788000	Yeah.
6788000	6790000	All right. Well, let's move on.
6790000	6792000	Loki, I think you're up next.
6792000	6797000	Yes. Let's talk about how the Switch Online has reached 10 million subscribers.
6797000	6802000	So a lot of people are very interested in playing different games on the Switch Online.
6802000	6806000	And I'm sure a big part of that probably has to do with also Tetris 99.
6806000	6813000	But of course, you know, you have other games in Mario Kart, Splatoon 2, the new Mario Maker 2, that type of stuff.
6813000	6816000	So definitely it's helped push it.
6816000	6822000	I can say that probably very minimally the NES library helped out with that.
6822000	6828000	But we're not going to get into a whole nother complaint debate about, you know, what's offered there.
6828000	6831000	I think the giveaway on Twitch was the biggest thing probably.
6831000	6833000	Yeah, that probably helped as well.
6833000	6838000	Plus being able to play games online. People want to play stuff like Splatoon and Mario Kart and that stuff.
6838000	6843000	So, you know, people probably just bought it so they could play online because you're used to doing it with PlayStation and Microsoft anyway.
6843000	6852000	Yeah. So, you know, basically they said, you know, the number of subscribers for an Nintendo Switch Online has increased steadily since the service was launched last September.
6852000	6855000	And it has surpassed 10 million accounts.
6855000	6862000	You know, we recognize that making a Nintendo Switch Online service attractive to users is extremely important.
6862000	6872000	And we will continue to make the content of the service even more appealing going forward with vague promises and no sort of information whatsoever.
6873000	6878000	So we shall see what they mean by that, if it's anything.
6878000	6892000	All right. Well, one thing that I guess they're trying to get people interested in with the Nintendo Online is more events for Tetris 99 to get you to come back and play that one if you're not already a regular player of Tetris 99.
6892000	6900000	Tetris 99 is having its fifth Maximus Cup from July 12th through July 15th. So it's next weekend basically.
6900000	6908000	And if you earn a hundred points during the cup, you will unlock a prize, which is a Splatoon theme for the game.
6908000	6914000	Because there was a classic theme I remember previously. Now there'll be a Splatoon theme. So I'm sure it'll kind of turn the Tetris music into that.
6914000	6923000	Like it'll kind of sound like Splatoon music at that point. So that'll be fun. Maybe like a Ska remix or something will be fun.
6924000	6932000	Anyway, the event has been confirmed for Japan and North America. It has not been confirmed for Europe yet. But why would they be left out? That would be kind of shitty.
6932000	6938000	So we'll see. But anyway, that is coming up this upcoming weekend. I'm sure some folks will be playing on that.
6938000	6944000	Also, another DLC pack on the way for Tetris 99. Because even though it's free, they can still get you through the DLC.
6944000	6950000	The second DLC will include offline multiplayer. And that will be out before the end of the year.
6950000	6956000	The developers behind Tetris 99 have said they are working on a mode that lets you play with friends and family offline.
6956000	6962000	So if you don't want to have to be signed into the service, you want to just play with friends in the same room. Party mode.
6962000	6968000	You know, because Tetris 99 doesn't really have any matching anyway. So this would be a way that you could control who it is you're playing against.
6968000	6977000	So I'm sure there will be some desire to have that. I think it'll be really cool if it allows multiple people to play on the same screen.
6978000	6985000	Because technically you could have a pro controller, your two little baby controllers that sit on the Switch, Joy-Cons.
6985000	6993000	You could maybe just, you know, excuse me, instead of having multiple Switches in the room, just have all these different controllers.
6993000	6997000	I'm sure it's limited at some point though because of all the Bluetooth. I remember hearing that before.
6997000	7001000	But be able to kind of play the game that way with a lot of people. Be fun.
7002000	7010000	ActDeft, by the way, says the Maximus Cup, Wyatt's Splatoon theme, is suggesting it's probably because of the final Splatfest for Splatoon 2.
7010000	7017000	The Maximus Cup is probably a crossover promotion for that. I keep forgetting, that's right, Splatoon 2 is ending those Splatfests pretty soon.
7017000	7025000	That's kind of weird. Because I would have expected there would be a Splatoon 3 or something to look forward to, but they didn't do that yet.
7025000	7035000	Anyway, that is it for the scheduled news that we have tonight, but we do open up our chat as well as our Discord.
7035000	7044000	If you are on our Discord server at vognetwork.com slash Discord, you can head on over to the green room and we'll be fielding some of your calls here on air if anybody wants to call tonight.
7044000	7049000	I notice we just seem to have a lower viewer turnout tonight. I don't know if that's the holiday weekend or what.
7049000	7051000	Stranger Things 3.
7051000	7058000	Oh, people binge watching Stranger Things 3? I'm through the first two episodes. That's as far as I got.
7058000	7067000	But yeah, I want to watch more. Maybe I will after the show tonight. I just found out that the LARP is not doing anything tomorrow, so I'll be able to do real things.
7067000	7068000	So that's good.
7068000	7069000	Slarp.
7070000	7073000	Or it's the Slarp. Slurp.
7073000	7077000	Anyway, Bobby says probably people still out for the holidays. Probably.
7077000	7083000	SG100Matt says I gave up on Tetris 99. I was getting wrecked too much and it wasn't fun for me anymore.
7083000	7088000	And also saying I finished it this morning and I'm sure that's about Stranger Things 3. It's great.
7088000	7089000	I would only get it for singleplay.
7089000	7093000	AkumaJP says stop at Season 1. I like Season 2.
7093000	7094000	Season 2 was great.
7094000	7097000	Yeah, it wasn't as good as Season 1, but it was still good enough.
7097000	7100000	You know, Season 1 was all about Winona's crazy eyes.
7100000	7103000	Well, Season 2 and 3 are also about that.
7103000	7108000	Well, Season 2, though, really was like the strong.
7108000	7111000	Season 2 was all about Hopper dancing.
7111000	7118000	Oh, you. It was for me. Oh, great. Now I can't think of her name. The teen girl.
7118000	7119000	Eleven?
7119000	7120000	No.
7120000	7121000	No, Nancy.
7121000	7122000	Sam.
7122000	7123000	Nancy.
7123000	7128000	Oh, the one that looks like Jennifer Grey in Season 3. She looks just like fucking Jennifer Grey.
7128000	7129000	Does she look like Jennifer Grey now?
7129000	7130000	Huh?
7130000	7132000	Before the nose or after the nose?
7132000	7134000	Before. In Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Before.
7134000	7142000	Okay. Just because she makes me think, actually, of another Nancy. The one from Nightmare on Elm Street.
7142000	7150000	How she went from kind of meek and worried to just pretty much taking it all in her own hands and being a badass.
7150000	7152000	You know, taking on the big bad.
7152000	7157000	And also, she does look a little bit like Heather Langenkamp.
7157000	7159000	Do you know I met Heather Langenkamp?
7159000	7160000	Really?
7160000	7163000	She was at the Sinister Creature Con. You know, I know the people that put that on.
7163000	7169000	And I was there because I was doing the same day I did the panel with Barry Boswick and Nell.
7169000	7171000	She still looks the same, doesn't she?
7171000	7173000	Yeah, she was there signing autographs.
7173000	7175000	And remember, I don't really do scary movies.
7175000	7179000	Of course I've seen that.
7179000	7183000	Of course I've seen that. But you know who do love horror movies? My husband.
7183000	7188000	So I went in line and I said, hey, so I actually want to get an autograph for my husband.
7188000	7191000	And, you know, such and such. He's a really big fan and watches.
7191000	7194000	So I actually got him an autograph and she was kind of like, you know, asking me some questions.
7194000	7197000	I felt like a dummy because I'm like, I don't really want your movies.
7197000	7203000	I go, I mean, I think I saw it once, but I tried to just, you know, be nice and keep it about, you know.
7203000	7208000	I used to watch her in a show called Just the Eight of Us. I think that was the name of it?
7208000	7209000	Yeah, I remember that show.
7209000	7212000	She was the oldest daughter in a very Catholic family.
7212000	7217000	And wasn't it a spin off of not Family Matters, was it?
7217000	7221000	I believe you are mishmashing. There was a show in the 70s called Eight is Enough.
7221000	7222000	No, yeah.
7222000	7223000	And then there was Just the Ten of Us.
7223000	7224000	Just the Ten of Us. That was it.
7224000	7228000	And it was a spin off of.
7228000	7230000	Crap, it was one of those shows.
7230000	7233000	It was a spin off because they had the family.
7233000	7235000	The family was featured in like an episode. Yeah.
7235000	7238000	And then they spun off the show and I really freaking loved that show.
7238000	7241000	But I was like, I watched it because she was in it.
7241000	7243000	And I just was obsessed with her hair.
7243000	7251000	I wanted her hair really because she had that hair that was not like not quite Brooke Shields hair, but pretty freaking long.
7251000	7252000	And I thought she was awesome.
7252000	7256000	But she still looks great considering when I saw The New Nightmare.
7256000	7260000	I seriously didn't think she had aged hardly any.
7260000	7266000	So if she's still looking that good, she must have good genes and a good dermatologist.
7266000	7267000	Nice.
7267000	7269000	Loki, do we have any last minute stories?
7269000	7277000	No, but I just noticed there's a game coming out that has to do with Ryan Toy Review, which my youngest son is obsessed with.
7277000	7281000	I'm going to have to fucking buy this piece of shit. I know it.
7281000	7287000	It's called Race with Ryan and it looks like a piece of shit, but it's like a YouTuber's getting a video game.
7287000	7289000	Yeah, YouTubers getting a video game.
7289000	7293000	Oh, my God. He's got his own fucking toilet. This kid is fucking rich, man.
7293000	7295000	He's rich, bitch.
7295000	7301000	So, like, he's got all sorts of merch and shit, but like, yeah, he's getting his own fucking game.
7301000	7307000	So the kid is like a one man, like PBS programming on YouTube.
7307000	7311000	It's not even it's just it's really him and his parents. It's his parents kind of pushing it.
7311000	7314000	It's just him doing shit like most of it nowadays.
7314000	7316000	It's like, look, I'm playing with my own fucking toys.
7316000	7318000	See, you want these toys, kids. You want these toys.
7318000	7323000	But it's just him just going to amusement parks and shit and doing weird.
7323000	7325000	Why do you get paid to go to amusement parks?
7325000	7329000	I did an amusement park review once at VOG's YouTube channel.
7329000	7331000	You can still find it somewhere.
7331000	7333000	Yeah, you just have to...
7333000	7337000	One of the only times Shayne has ever let me put him on camera was for a Mass Effect ride.
7337000	7339000	Just saying.
7339000	7342000	So, I don't know. We just have to...
7342000	7345000	Hopefully, he'll never find out about this.
7345000	7348000	Unfortunately, he will find out about this because he watches this.
7348000	7352000	They'll feature it in the videos. You're screwed. There's no way you're going to hide it from him.
7352000	7353000	Damn it.
7355000	7359000	All right. Well, if there's no last minute stories and I don't see anyone on the call on the phone,
7359000	7362000	I guess I guess we're almost wrapped up for the night.
7362000	7364000	It was kind of a shorter Newsweek, right?
7364000	7366000	So, yeah, that's what it is.
7366000	7370000	All right. Well, as I always say at the end of every episode,
7370000	7373000	if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lawn Radio, help us spread the word.
7373000	7376000	Tell a friend or two about the show because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
7376000	7381000	But if the voices aren't here to air them, then how are we supposed to put them out there?
7381000	7384000	So, I hope everybody did have a great holiday weekend.
7384000	7386000	And we look forward to doing this all again next week.
7386000	7388000	We should be getting some more gaming news next week.
7388000	7392000	And we're going to start what? Gamescom is not too far away.
7392000	7395000	San Diego Comic-Con. I think it was two weeks.
7395000	7397000	But we'll have that and some of the tidbits coming out of that.
7397000	7400000	And things are just going to start ramping up and up and up as we get closer to Labor Day.
7401000	7404000	Next weekend is also the big...
7404000	7407000	Comic-Con. There's also news usually at Comic-Con.
7407000	7409000	Yeah. Oh, I guess that is this coming weekend.
7409000	7412000	Or I don't know if it's this weekend, but it's soon, if not.
7412000	7415000	But then also, Southern Fry Game Room Expo, which we've been talking about, is this weekend.
7415000	7419000	So, who knows? Maybe we'll hear. Well, certainly Bobby will talk about it on his show and have some video as well.
7419000	7421000	Maybe he'll share some of that with us. I don't know.
7421000	7423000	I know he's going to have a very fun weekend there.
7423000	7429000	Oh, yeah, nssj100matt points out, we have Pokemon GO Community Day during OLR for West Coast people next weekend.
7429000	7433000	Yeah, it's frickin' like 4 to 7 o'clock, so we can't even do it unless we catch him on the house.
7433000	7436000	I'm actually going to be at the fair.
7436000	7445000	So, for locals, next Sunday, starting, of course, from the fair opening to 10, is out at the fair.
7445000	7448000	So, it's going to be...
7448000	7449000	State Fair.
7449000	7451000	State Fair, yeah. And guess who's playing that night? I told you already.
7451000	7453000	I don't want no scrub.
7453000	7454000	Oh, is that that...
7454000	7455000	TLC is playing...
7455000	7456000	At the friggin' State Fair?
7456000	7457000	At the friggin' State Fair.
7457000	7458000	Oh, I thought that was his own thing.
7458000	7462000	That's why I was like, shit! I want to go! No.
7462000	7464000	Because I don't want no scrub.
7464000	7466000	That's a pretty big name for the State Fair to get.
7466000	7469000	A scrub is a guy who can't get no love from me.
7469000	7472000	You know who else is going to be there? It's Martina McBride.
7472000	7474000	Oh, those are some pretty big names.
7474000	7479000	Yeah, and actually, you remember from the late 80s, early 90s, Tony, Tony, Tony?
7479000	7480000	Hell yeah.
7480000	7481000	They're playing.
7481000	7482000	Wow.
7482000	7483000	They're still around.
7484000	7486000	The State Fair always used to be at the end of...
7486000	7490000	It was like going into Labor Day, but they moved it four or five years ago to July.
7490000	7491000	I'm still not used to it being in July.
7491000	7492000	It's too hot, though.
7492000	7494000	That was always where I saw Weird Al.
7494000	7498000	Lately, though, it hasn't really broken 100 here lately.
7498000	7500000	It's been like 80s and 90s.
7500000	7502000	No, he's fine. He's fine.
7502000	7503000	As long as he doesn't wander over to the...
7503000	7505000	As long as he doesn't knock over glasses?
7505000	7506000	Yeah, he'll be fine.
7507000	7508000	Yeah, I'm looking...
7508000	7510000	You can already see next Sunday's weather.
7510000	7513000	Okay, the high is 94, but it's not 100.
7515000	7520000	Well, at any rate, I'm going to be there in face because the sisters are doing...
7520000	7522000	There's actually a drag queen bingo earlier in the day.
7522000	7523000	Oh, fun.
7523000	7524000	But you're still here at the show, right?
7524000	7525000	Yeah.
7525000	7526000	Okay, good.
7526000	7532000	But the tickets are free for the drag queen bingo for actually reserving a seat for drag
7532000	7533000	queen bingo.
7533000	7534000	Oh.
7534000	7538000	And I may have deals on tickets with Monorail.
7538000	7539000	Fun.
7539000	7540000	I'll see if you want to go.
7540000	7541000	All right, we'll see.
7541000	7543000	I don't know what's going on next weekend yet, so we'll see.
7543000	7546000	I feel like I had something on the agenda, but whatever.
7546000	7547000	Always busy, busy.
7547000	7551000	I might be thinking of the Southern Fried Game Room even though I'm not going.
7551000	7554000	I might just be thinking like that that's next weekend, but yeah.
7554000	7555000	All right.
7555000	7558000	Well, yeah, I guess we wrap up and get everybody's final thoughts.
7558000	7559000	It's weird to be done so early.
7559000	7560000	Oh, no, that's as far as...
7560000	7561000	No, I don't want him over there.
7561000	7562000	Hold on.
7562000	7563000	I'll get him.
7563000	7564000	I'll get him.
7564000	7565000	You sure?
7565000	7566000	Yeah.
7566000	7567000	Okay.

7616000	7618000	Um, let's get everybody's final thought.
7618000	7619000	Let's go over...
7619000	7620000	Nintendo truck at the State Fair.
7620000	7621000	Geez, Kat.
7621000	7623000	Kat, you are going to get it.
7623000	7625000	Alright, as long as he doesn't go all the way over there.
7625000	7627000	He can stay there, but not over the other side.
7627000	7628000	He's always going to go over there.
7628000	7629000	I know, I'm watching him.
7629000	7631000	Alright, let's wrap up the show so I can discipline the Kat.
7631000	7633000	Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?
7633000	7635000	Um, I'm covered in the hair of two cats.
7635000	7636000	Really.
7636000	7638000	And my final thought is, see, he lied down.
7638000	7639000	That's what he wanted to do.
7639000	7640000	I'm going to take a picture of him.
7640000	7641000	That's fine.
7641000	7642000	He just wanted to lie down up there on the counter.
7642000	7644000	And, uh, Loki, your final thought tonight?
7644000	7648000	My final thought is, I'll hopefully play more games this week.
