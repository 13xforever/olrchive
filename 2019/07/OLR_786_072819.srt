right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at twitch TV twitch.tv slash vog network and

21
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,160
I'm saying that because I'm reading some comments from chat where stu 100 Matt

22
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,540
says orange hair radio and Spyro Jonathan says heck yeah orange hair

23
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,580
radio so did you dye your hair orange because you are that devoted to this

24
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:58,740
show as if 17 years of your life wasn't enough bitch I might be I'm actually not

25
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,300
gonna be bleaching my roots anymore because you know it's bad for your hair

26
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,780
to over bleach I wouldn't know I don't I don't have hair anymore well so why do

27
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,180
you think I wear hats those on the camera can see it's dark up here I'm

28
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:14,020
gonna be going really red and growing out this orange part to wear when my

29
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:18,420
hair's long it's gonna be like flame point I'm thinking ahead this is gonna

30
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:23,460
be like a three-year endeavor it looks worse on cam that it really is like I

31
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,260
sort it like it looks like it's just like completely bald on top but I do

32
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:30,980
have some hair it looks worse on cam I think but not but bald is beautiful so

33
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,540
I don't give a fuck so whatever it gives you an excuse to have interesting hats

34
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:39,140
too yeah it is I'd like the hats are a good accessory why not you you ladies

35
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,180
get to pick your purses that match well not that gender roles should define

36
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,540
anything but the majority of you know American culture is that you pick a

37
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:52,140
purse to go with your outfit why should I say queens yeah exactly right but if I

38
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,500
wanted to pick take a purse then god damn it I'm gonna take a purse exactly

39
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,660
all right bring back the murse all right anyway I had a murse we talked about

40
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:04,140
that another time all right anyway hello I don't mean to ignore Loki techmaster

41
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:07,900
Loki over there that's fine but you're equal number one I'm thinking you don't

42
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,060
have a lot to contribute to the purse discussion no and I can clearly see

43
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,740
you're over there catching Pokemon yes because apparently my house is a how hot

44
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:21,260
bed of Pokemon no just because I haven't done it in a while and because I don't

45
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,620
know yeah I'm out of the loop so you know to that guy that reviewed us on

46
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,580
iTunes saying they talk about nothing but Pokemon go those days are numbered I

47
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,860
haven't played some review I shouldn't even acknowledge the negative reviews

48
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,540
but it is what it is yeah yeah but you can always leave a positive review if

49
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,380
you want to offset that stuff for the record there's jack shit at your house

50
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:49,460
what they had a thing where you get you hatched or you get a dratini and then

51
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,580
you have to take a picture of it and then that picture got me one of those

52
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:57,420
smear goal things and so I had to catch that oh I didn't do that I caught a

53
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,140
dratini but I didn't take a picture of it yeah I've kind of fallen off the

54
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,060
wagon on this quest like I guess today was the in here we are talking about

55
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:11,020
anyway today was like that Team Rocket type of my game well they keep doing it

56
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,300
on Sunday night well I can hit it though before when I leave the house to come

57
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,740
here I can hit the pokestop by my house so here's the weird thing like so

58
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:21,860
Pokemon go gave my phone a new background I don't know why like it

59
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:25,980
changed my wallpaper did you tell it it could no it just did it like it crashed

60
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,940
the wallpaper is it a cute Pikachu no it's just like it's just like some pink

61
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:34,860
like looks like like a mountain range or something I had like weird it's supposed

62
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,300
to be a simulation of earth with like the lighting and everything and the

63
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:41,620
cloud cover is supposed to match with what the weather satellites are because

64
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:47,340
that's kind of cool and now it's gone all right whatever background on y'all's

65
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,700
phone I have a picture of mr. smoosh on my well you can't see it right now

66
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,140
because I have apparently Twitter alerts that are in the way oh because that's a

67
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,180
good thing because y'all are promoting the show tonight because I barely did

68
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,860
but I have a picture of mr. smoosh is the background of my phone you guys

69
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,980
probably can't even see it from that far away but that's what I have I try to

70
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:07,700
take a picture of a dratini to see if that would count and it doesn't you can

71
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:12,060
turn off the AR thing and and it's a lot easier to do pictures and so I wanted to

72
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:17,020
take the AR because I did it on top of my macbook and it's got your knee in the

73
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:21,740
picture oh my sexy knee I'm sure I'm I'm being a little bit of a that neither

74
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:27,660
tonight by showing off my knees that knee uh-huh all right anyway it's hot

75
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,140
today I can't how could I not wear shorts everybody's wearing shorts

76
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:36,380
because it's 106 today here in lovely Sacramento where we're based the ambient

77
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:44,260
temperature coming off of my car when I got in it was 115 Wow right well all

78
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,980
right anyway let's let's talk about the weather more talk about games and dark

79
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,900
soccer you braved the weather this weekend because you went on a road trip

80
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:57,660
off to San Jose right I didn't brave the weather I left it but so tell us a was

81
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,060
like it didn't get any hotter than like 88 you know that's that's typical Bay

82
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,940
Area but anyway tell us about California extreme it was the thing I go to every

83
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:10,940
year basically in a nutshell California extreme is a big gaming Expo where they

84
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:15,900
have like a huge ballroom full of pinball classic games music games and

85
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:20,980
they've got a big candy cab section now the Japanese style cabinets and then

86
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:24,780
they have like a whole other room now that's just like a big meeting room

87
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:29,060
that's also full of games and then they have a vendor room upstairs with a stage

88
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:35,540
to do rock band kind of how allowed did their thing and then you know classic

89
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:40,460
consoles also set up up there so it was really good it goes on for two days I

90
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,120
forgot what time it opens I think it opens at like 9 or 10 but it goes to 2

91
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:51,480
in the morning on Saturday and then Sunday all day and people you know bring

92
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:56,760
their own machines some people sell them there Stern has a big presence and I

93
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:03,720
twice ran into Steve Ritchie and he's like oh hi cuz you know we're Facebook

94
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:09,680
buddies it's funny yeah and he was I was like let's get a picture together he's

95
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,400
like I got to go take my pills I'm like okay Steve he's not a chicken of the

96
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,240
spring anymore but he's he's just a good guy he and his wife are the nicest

97
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:26,560
people you'll ever meet but they had all kinds of really good games which I could

98
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,960
go ahead and do now and get my gaming week out of the way for everything I

99
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,240
played yeah well I was hoping there might be stuff outside of for that but

100
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,920
oh sorry well no I hardly played anything outside of California stream

101
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,640
except for the usual we'll get into a little bit of what you what you played a

102
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,900
California stream then okay so I played Black Knight Sword of Rage which was

103
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,800
amazing as always and if you were ever gonna buy a Black Knight Sword of Rage

104
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,520
get premium don't get the pro the premium that brand new table yeah maybe

105
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:02,000
three months old they had the miss pac-man mini like the cabinet that's

106
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,260
like like a two-thirds my height but there's like those arcade one-up

107
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:09,880
machines yeah I think that's what they were interesting I didn't I'm surprised

108
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,200
that those are kind of yeah those have an interesting place in this day and age

109
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,600
right because like I would think in some ways those might be frowned on because

110
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:21,240
they're not authentic miss pac-man's but they sure do give a fairly authentic

111
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,920
experience with the screens the screens really a big difference like you can

112
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,520
really notice the screens on those arcade one-ups are not the same thing

113
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:34,480
you remember playing oh really and then they had an even smaller one that didn't

114
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,960
look like it was in the same thing so it could have been custom but it was an

115
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:43,000
ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 so that's some interesting ones ones there they didn't

116
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,640
have any of like I mean those are almost like the junior size one but they didn't

117
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,080
have the junior size Neo Geo you know I bet that arcade one-up company was

118
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,760
probably like advertising there actually they probably had some type of deal to

119
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,500
have their machines there because that is the perfect crowd to be selling the

120
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:02,620
those things to you know classic arcade game fans with disposable income that is

121
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,140
like that is their crowd so I wouldn't be surprised if those machines were

122
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:10,900
there because like arcade one-up kind of wanted them there and they did have from

123
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:17,360
what I could notice fewer of the pinball and arcade board vendors and more of the

124
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,800
classic video game vendors although I tried to find Saturn and turbo graphic

125
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,120
stuff and they were very sparse they still the place that I buy from tiny

126
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,160
potato I really like those guys I hang you know hang out and chat with them

127
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:38,280
every year but they have a copy of cotton for PlayStation that I would

128
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:44,760
really like to buy but it's 90 bucks I keep waffling on it you know but I mean

129
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,080
it was really a fun time all the vendors were really nice everyone was really

130
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,680
friendly and chatty and one of the vendors watched me open a couple of

131
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,520
blind boxes cuz he went in I said he's like can I predict him first I'm like

132
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,240
sure so he shakes the two of them I grabbed like the dig dug blind set which

133
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,960
you could get one of three characters so you know he had two out of three choice

134
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:07,760
like this one is a puka and this one is the I always forget the name of the

135
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,960
dragon the fry gar fry gar is like this one's a fry I wanted to say that's a

136
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:16,680
video game cuz the game rygar yeah I was thinking rygar and I was like so he

137
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,480
shook him is like this one's a fry gar this one's a puka so when I opened them

138
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,560
one was a fry gar one was a puka I wouldn't have minded a dig-dug but I

139
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:30,720
like having the baddies so they're cool and pukas are cute but at any rate I

140
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,120
they really they were missing some stuff this year just some things that I

141
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,140
expected to be there this year that were not there were lots of panels Steve

142
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:47,960
Ritchie did a panel about developing Black Knight there was one about DJ max

143
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:53,960
oh wow yeah 730 and I I didn't go to it cuz I was hanging out with melody but

144
00:10:53,960 --> 00:11:00,560
Mel went to it which by the way preview preview we may have Mel on yeah yeah I

145
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,720
heard yeah he was thinking about is he gonna come up here we doing something

146
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,200
awesome I would love to have love to have him back on the show talk about the

147
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:16,600
have a DDR night infinity stage yeah that he's gonna be working with but you

148
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,400
know there was a pretty decent music game section but they didn't I was

149
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,320
looking for a couple of things they didn't have it although they did have

150
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:28,240
that nostalgia game by Konami that looks kind of like a keyboard but not really a

151
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,400
keyboard I think I know what you're talking about it's it's a newer game

152
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:37,840
right yeah yeah I think Musica which I finally got to play it was fun they had

153
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:43,360
my my do you know what my my is uh yeah circle that's got the button yeah

154
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:51,240
pattern I played that and it had an oppa oppa song so I was very happy I'm not

155
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,640
great at it you know it's just my first time playing it but I think I did okay

156
00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:03,360
so as they had a bunch of DJ max though they had some you beat they had a couple

157
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:09,480
of the bishi bashi so that was pretty fun they had a real prop cycle another

158
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,320
prop cycle Adams family they did had an Adams family though but you know there

159
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,360
was there were certain the blastroids that used to belong to us was there so

160
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,560
it was pretty funny dance like I'm gonna go see our blastroids but anyway so what

161
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,560
I played there was I played Black Knight Sword of Rage I played the Miss Pac-man

162
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,120
mini I played Pac-man and chomp chomp which is a very weird little more recent

163
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:37,560
Pac-man game JJ squawkers which thought I played Sonic the fighters I played

164
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:43,160
azumanga daioh puzzle bobble so it's basically puzzle bobble with the girls

165
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,800
from azumanga daioh in it so easy peasy I played my my I played virtual on

166
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,960
oratorio tangram which was really fun they were in the Japanese cabinets and

167
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:55,500
they were back-to-back and I was just trying to play through you know the

168
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,520
story mode and this one person just keeps challenging challenging chill I'm

169
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,360
like I was just so stubborn I was like I just want to beat you and be done and

170
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,720
you kept doing over and over and like six games and I'm like okay I'm done and

171
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,600
I just let him win you know I just ran in with the sword and it's like if you

172
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,720
can beat me at close range then you win and so I walked around and just poked

173
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,240
him on the shoulder I was like good game dude and he's like it's a girl you know

174
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:26,940
like the total it's a girl look like a girl speaks to me pretty much like the

175
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:31,120
ending of Metroid for the very first time yeah but I played Dodon Pachi I

176
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,800
played Big Bang bar so they had a Big Bang bar but it was I think it was a

177
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:41,200
repro because the glass on it they played Musica I played some regular old

178
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,680
pac-man but it wasn't one of those I forgot what they're called like the

179
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:49,180
marquee cabinets the the narrower ones with a smaller screen yeah I know what

180
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,240
you're talking about but I don't know the name call them something and I

181
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,920
remember did if you bring up pac-man did they have my all-time fave baby pac-man

182
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,360
I didn't see baby pac-man I would have played the shit out of it I saying for

183
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,840
those of you that go Google baby pac-man if you don't know it cuz baby pac-man

184
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,920
the reason why I love that game so much I remembered as a kid it is half like

185
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,040
pac-man arcade game but then there's a point where when you go out the tunnels

186
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,960
you don't like warp to yet well you do when you go out the side when you go

187
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,160
there's tunnels in the bottom and when you go out the bottom tunnels you drop

188
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:22,320
into a pinball board and so it's half pac-man half pinball and it's so cool I

189
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,880
didn't play journey either because apparently the joystick was a little

190
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:31,800
messed up but I also played you know crazy auto which was a kind of backwards

191
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:41,400
retheme of miss pac-man because miss pac-man started life as a pac-man like

192
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,040
expansion yeah I was like a pac-man plus and they were gonna release it under the

193
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,920
name crazy auto with a walking character and everything and then you know Namco

194
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:54,120
and shit happened and miss pac-man I also played a Beatlemania pinball and I

195
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:59,240
played the Sega Tetris that's got the big fat blocks like you only have like

196
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:05,000
ten block spaces to work with it's kind of hard but it was really fun I really

197
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,160
enjoyed it and there was also you know there was a few others a bunch of cave

198
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:18,240
shooters like mushihime sama and and what was battle garega

199
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,520
what else did I play no it was do don pachi that I played because I love that

200
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:27,640
game but yeah they just had all kinds of neat stuff I mean there were there were

201
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:32,240
a bunch of you know the street fighter ones like starting from third impact all

202
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,560
the way up through five they had an arcade machine for five and they had

203
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:43,000
multi blood you know just all kinds of neat import games over in that area so

204
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,720
it was it was really neat you know just a fun time and hanging out with my

205
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:54,400
friends and you know ran into Bradley like you do and I played with the

206
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,160
toddler what kind of like vendors were there cuz aren't there usually like

207
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,040
around the edges of the rooms there's like some vendors selling like classic

208
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,560
arcade things like what did you see there was like one DIY vendor outside

209
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,120
doing like etched glass and there was another one inside also doing etched

210
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:14,840
glass like for mugs and shot pint glasses and shot glasses and then you

211
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,520
know I said there weren't so many we pinball part vendors like there were in

212
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:23,140
previous years Marco pinball of course is one of the sponsors with Stern for

213
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:28,860
bringing in a lot of the because they have it that big stern section that had

214
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:32,900
like Black Knight Deadpool all of that and so they were selling parts and stuff

215
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:38,180
from Marco there was the shirt vendors for California extreme there were just a

216
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:43,900
lot of like kitschy knick-knack II stuff for for the video game merch like the

217
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:49,300
blind boxes and Mario mugs and there was a doormat that I wanted one that says

218
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:53,100
welcome to Peach's castle it was kind of cute and they had like throws and

219
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:57,820
everything like blankets and this is nothing super exciting maybe you know if

220
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:03,240
I was trying to decorate my teenage bedroom that might be something or if

221
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,940
you know we start getting into decorating the game room or something it

222
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:12,500
was it was all nice stuff you know I got my two little things to put on my desk

223
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:19,500
at work and I got patches actually I got an Atari patch I got a mass link shield

224
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:27,340
the Hyrule shield patch and I got a a super mushroom because I'm gonna make a

225
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:32,100
patch jacket so fun you need to get some of those old-school Activision

226
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:36,220
achievement patches for your jacket I'll see I would love that I would look so

227
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,100
many issues reprose there's got to be reprose of that I would love to get an

228
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,820
awesome jacket with like all the Activision badges I think that would be

229
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,860
cool yeah that's got to be like an Etsy or something one of those things I wish

230
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:49,300
Activision themselves would do it though you know because they as much love or

231
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:53,260
hate Activision in their current state today for those of us that were you know

232
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:57,620
cool kid Atari 2600 folks like you know it would be it would be nice to you know

233
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:01,580
get our get our hands on some of that type of merch right oh so I did buy a

234
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:06,700
few things though oh yeah I bought the compact old-school Game Boy case it's

235
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:13,100
this well they can on the podcast anyway so anyway it's it's actually honestly

236
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:17,660
about the length of this microphone okay and it has enough space for they can see

237
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:22,700
mine it has enough room in it for a Game Boy on one side and then maybe like

238
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:26,540
four games total on the other I think I used to have one of those cases it's a

239
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:30,020
hard case and I was like I don't have a Game Boy to put in it we don't have an

240
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:34,260
old-school Game Boy anymore but I could make like a purse or something out of it

241
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:39,300
it'd be fun or you know like a first aid kit yeah you know I thought it would be

242
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:43,740
neat I only paid five bucks for it and then I got the Game Gear magnifier I

243
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:48,420
mean he wanted eight bucks for it but I actually got the two items together for

244
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,660
ten bucks you know cuz you haggle you haggle when you go to the classic gaming

245
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:59,540
table and then I got a game called air adventures for Saturn that I never

246
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:03,580
played but like they this one guy traded it in with a stack of other games and

247
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:07,380
when the fellow was looking it up it's like it was only worth the dollar I was

248
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,860
like I'll give you two bucks for it okay so I took it sight unseen two bucks

249
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:16,300
because it's another Saturn game and I thought it'd be fun to try something new

250
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:23,380
you know that hadn't played before and yeah I didn't really do like a whole

251
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,740
bunch of shopping in it my knee t-shirts you know but they had some fun little

252
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:32,140
stuff and I love blind boxes so I now have my poop puka and fry car you need

253
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:36,020
to you start a YouTube channel opening blind boxes do you know like how popular

254
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:39,900
those types of videos are yeah but these aren't it these are different than like

255
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:45,900
those little blind boxes the gift blind boxes it's people like order like the

256
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:52,300
Amazon returns or the blind boxes on Etsy or not Etsy but eBay you know those

257
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:56,620
are the ones that get money or the people who buy the storage units I know

258
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,220
let me ask you one more thing about California stream and then we'll get on

259
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,220
into the rest of our gaming weeks the type of stuff we've been playing but you

260
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:05,220
know you've been going to the convention for several years now what was your

261
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:09,340
favorite thing about the convention this year and well let's start there what was

262
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:15,180
your favorite thing about the convention this year um I don't know

263
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:20,980
just I guess more seeing my friends the people yeah that's fair that they

264
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,700
hanging out with nerds hanging out with nerds heck yeah that's one of my

265
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,780
favorite actually Dragon Con mag fest any kind of into the two things that I

266
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:32,060
heard the most that made me happy was one I like your hair and number two I

267
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:36,460
like your shirt I was wearing my crazy red shirt for Animal Crossing that says

268
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:40,580
seems legit oh I was gonna wear my chica shirt and I was like you know I'm

269
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,860
gonna wear crazy red it's a little a little bit bigger it's a little more

270
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:46,580
comfortable and everyone's like oh my god you're sure let me take let me take

271
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:51,380
a picture of your shirt okay and then I think probably the obvious follow-up to

272
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:54,340
that would be what would be one thing that you would want to see them do next

273
00:20:54,340 --> 00:21:02,020
year that they haven't done yet I want or they're not doing I would like a

274
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:08,820
whole room of nothing but I'd like them to put the candy cabs and the Bahmani

275
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:14,500
the music games in their own room that sounds like a get you go you'd like so

276
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,780
much noise pollution though and that but I guess I guess if you set up barriers

277
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:20,460
the right way if you kind of thought it through there'd probably be a way to

278
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,420
make it a little more tolerable and the other there's actually one other thing

279
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:30,340
because I was when I was talking to tiny potato guys there they said that they

280
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:34,660
weren't given any lighting where they were so people couldn't they had to go

281
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:38,260
to Target and buy lamps and I was like you really need to take better care of

282
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:42,740
your vendors you know don't put people in dark little corners with no lighting

283
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:46,820
that's not fair to them if you were gonna have the vendors be in a place

284
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:49,740
other than where they usually are you need to make sure you have sufficient

285
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,820
lighting so that people can see those items and they're not wasting money

286
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:57,060
renting the space okay that's good feedback I think that's exactly the type

287
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,380
of thing I think would be good for them to hear but I think that next year

288
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:03,700
though I actually want to officially try to go as press next year I want to go

289
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:08,020
period because I've missed it so many years in a row but this is also you know

290
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:11,660
in generally like personally this is also a hard weekend so it's like you

291
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:15,940
know it's just just a bad time of year for it you know yeah but I'm gonna put

292
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:19,860
in for press next year you should so that we can go in and interview people

293
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:23,860
and do panels good panels yeah I get some of the get some of them for some

294
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,740
some break segments get some interviews that'd be awesome maybe we should even

295
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:32,100
like petition to do a panel you never know I mean at this point we would be a

296
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:38,940
classic podcast don't you think classic podcast they have games from 2002 in

297
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:45,100
there that are classic games I think there was there was also another game in

298
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:49,900
there I forgot the name of it but it was like the super field goal football

299
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:54,660
baseball mixture game it was kind of weird yeah Bobby and Chad is saying I'd

300
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:57,620
love to go to probably won't be able to swing it yeah I think him and I are in

301
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:01,220
similar predicaments as to why he can't come out here for California extreme and

302
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,420
why I can't go out there for the southern fried gaming expo which is

303
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:09,180
really it's really their equivalent is what that that show is so yeah but I

304
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:14,420
mean it's really it's really fun you know I had a great time like like I

305
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:17,780
said earlier I was toddler tired when I was done because I didn't want to stop

306
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:24,980
playing but I was tired was it that super slam-dunk yeah yeah we had that

307
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:28,380
guy on the show a long time because they were at gamer X yeah second or third

308
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:33,140
year yeah we had them remembered it but everyone in dance pinball group was like

309
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:37,140
oh it's so much fun yeah it's a fun game they had a killer be there it's been out

310
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:43,500
a while now that a killer be a killer Queen that was it which I still haven't

311
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:47,700
played that game but everyone says it's really fun so Bobby and Chad says yeah

312
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,460
the toddler tired thing is why I got a hotel room at southern fried so I didn't

313
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:54,260
have to drive home at night and yeah I think that's why I like a lot of people

314
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,900
like kind of even if the convention is like right by you you know a lot of

315
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,220
people if they have the income I mean certainly you know how much money you do

316
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:04,020
or don't have and are able to spend on that type of stuff plays a factor but if

317
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,380
you're fortunate enough to be able to swing it like I think a lot of people

318
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:10,740
are just like I'm just gonna plan to stay on site they're doing a big ingress

319
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:14,980
thing in downtown Sacramento on October 12th I'm considering getting a hotel

320
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,980
room in downtown Sacramento because of the whole toddler tired thing yeah I

321
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:23,940
need to get in on that information yeah you do you do come join us anyway all

322
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,900
right let's talk about the rest of our gaming weeks outside of the convention

323
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,540
of California extreme which I really do hope to attend next year and

324
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:33,020
congratulate those guys on their success because everybody I talked to that goes

325
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:37,460
loves it and I just it's just it's always like a bad like timing conflict I

326
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:41,140
think one year speaking of gamer X and the the game there I think one year it

327
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,980
was the same weekend as gamer X and that was an issue I think it was the year

328
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:47,700
gamer X was up in San Francisco tell me stream was like the same weekend I seem

329
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:52,100
to remember that was the thing that happened yeah yeah anyway um did you

330
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,700
want to add anything else to your gaming week our soccer outside of the

331
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:59,700
convention the usual phone games mm-hmm so that's it yeah and Pokemon go first

332
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:04,780
my phone today no it needs to stop doing that probably so many people getting in

333
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:08,800
on that event I guess which sadly I've just lost track of Loki how about you

334
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:13,700
how was your gaming week I didn't play a lot of games this week I played just a

335
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,940
little bit Pokemon go okay but you did something video game adjacent I know

336
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:23,540
because you invited me and I couldn't go so I played more laser tag again

337
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:28,520
actually so I went last night I tried to get a meetup group of people to go play

338
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,700
some laser tag I did have one of my friends show up with his kids so we

339
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:36,040
played for a little bit and that was kind of fun so he played that for a

340
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:42,160
while at the local place here then today I went to a not quite local place a

341
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:46,800
little further away to try out their arena and system stuff to see if it's

342
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:51,200
something I would like I was hesitant to go there because it's twice as much it's

343
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:57,520
very far away and I don't know I just had kind of a bad feeling about it and

344
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:03,600
when we got there and played it it was kind of jank a little bit the arena is

345
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,000
nice and I like how some of the features that they have are kind of remind me of

346
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:14,880
cues are but it's the guns themselves were really tiny and they force you to

347
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,400
push like two buttons on the side in order for you to actually be able to

348
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:23,600
fire the gun so you have to hold the two buttons on the side because they always

349
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,560
want to make sure they using two hands whereas the place I play over here they

350
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,880
have an optical sensor so you put your hand on the bottom and it detects it's

351
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,440
there you don't have to hold some stupid buttons so forcing to hold those tiny

352
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,600
buttons actually cramps the hell out of your hand and doing that even for just

353
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:44,280
20 minutes I was like fuck this place I'm not coming back here but I do want

354
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:48,640
to check out all the places in the area so I played most of them now but then

355
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,440
ended up driving back over here playing a couple games so it's fun I keep

356
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,440
playing in it and I tried to actually have some footage shot I got one of those

357
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,120
action cameras I just don't have the right settings on it right now so it

358
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,040
came out really grainy and dark because I have to adjust some of the settings on

359
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:10,560
the camera which is unfortunate because I had some pretty good games there but

360
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:15,280
it's hard to see what's going on and I had it mounted to my head instead of

361
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:20,200
like on my shoulder or something like that and it's just really hard to see

362
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:25,040
kind of what I was doing you kind of miss a lot of it so I'm gonna try it

363
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,360
again at some point I may actually pick up another camera to try to maybe mount

364
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,200
one to a gun mount one to my shoulder or something to get some footage because I

365
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:38,560
think that'd be really cool but yeah so I've been playing lots of laser tag so

366
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:42,960
I used to play a lot of laser tag way back in the day and it definitely still

367
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,560
shows I like that you're having like your midlife crisis where you're

368
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:49,440
rediscovering it all over again it's not that I have never like not like I know

369
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,600
wanted to if like if a Q's are were to open up tomorrow yeah I'd be playing

370
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,640
there all the time well you're going to this new place a lot which is pretty

371
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:02,760
cool and it's see it's like I'm so torn because that place like it has a decent

372
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:09,160
arena it has decent gear but the people that run it are just not great they

373
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:14,280
they're just like it's you can tell that they're minimum wage kids that just

374
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:18,400
don't care about being there and I get it you know it's a job I worked the job

375
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:23,280
at a laser tech place before so I understand what it's like but like they

376
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:26,600
don't know anything that's going on there like they have stuff that they

377
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,640
advertise the website like about like a membership that you can do so you get a

378
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,960
membership you give your own like call sign or whatever and you can scan it a

379
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,120
card on the mission on the actual gun and it'll pop up like your name instead

380
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,360
of the names that are on the guns normally and then also you like

381
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:44,840
accumulate points towards something that happens like I think you select like

382
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:48,360
exclusive weapons and stuff like that which is kind of cool so I thought oh

383
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,120
yeah I'll do that for myself and my kids because we've been playing here for a

384
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,600
few times and I go and ask them today about it because it is is literally one

385
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,680
of the tabs that's on their website is membership it says ask us when you come

386
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,640
in I'm like okay hey what about that membership thing how do I get and you

387
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,560
sign up on that they're like I don't know what you're talking about like okay

388
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:11,400
and in like the last week when we went to like we did they're like three hour

389
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,480
thing where they're supposed to have pizza they're like pizza didn't arrive

390
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,840
on time and they're like well we don't know where it is you can tell it's just

391
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,040
not very professional with the kids right but like I met the owner last

392
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:25,000
night and you know he obviously knows what's going on he has another arena in

393
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,920
San Francisco as well and he commutes up here to run it sometimes but like he was

394
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:37,160
dead it was dead on a Saturday night and that's not a good sign it's not a good

395
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:41,160
sign they don't have anything in their lobby like it's just empty they have

396
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:45,400
some ticket redemption games and like even today like when we were leaving

397
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,800
there was I don't know what it was it looked like a rehab group or something

398
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,320
like that but a bunch of old dudes and looks like some other people with like

399
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,600
uniforms on that like we're taking him in a van back somewhere I don't know but

400
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:01,160
okay I assumed it was like drug rehab or something like that and so they were

401
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:05,080
taking him back and they gave us like a big thing a big stack of tickets so here

402
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:09,120
you go you know your kids can get some of the prizes here and he had like

403
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:14,280
shitty-ass it's all like even like even all the tickets this is just shit it's

404
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,880
this absolute shit let me get some chat comments over at twitch.tv slash vogue

405
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:23,040
Network VG realness says if laser tag is dead on a Saturday night it won't be

406
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:27,600
around much longer yeah and I know and it's it's really comes down to location

407
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,960
and advertising I've been to places I know it's in a business park which is a

408
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,600
it's it's it's a business park but you can see it from the road so that's good

409
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,280
at least but I've been to another laser tag place that was also in a business

410
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,960
park and it just didn't last because nobody knows where it is and so look for

411
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,320
and there's no advertising they don't have much of a social media presence

412
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:51,120
there's no advertising whereas the other place I went to today definitely you

413
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:55,040
know a lot more popular lots of people there but they have they have their way

414
00:30:55,040 --> 00:31:01,080
expensive they have more of an arcade they have like some bounce house shit

415
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:06,240
that's there that really I wouldn't pay any money for that and they have their

416
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,960
only cafe so they're definitely set up to kind of run a little bit better of an

417
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:15,080
operation but this place it's it's struggling and what they talk about like

418
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,560
let me get let me get some other comment sorry I asked you 100 mats is giving you

419
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,920
photo advice saying the camera will give you a lot of grainy footage in low light

420
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,940
but yeah if you mess with the aperture or shutter speed and the video noise it

421
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:28,720
will look better obviously more light would fix it but you can't really do

422
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,580
that in the laser tag arena yeah at night vision will look good but the

423
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:35,000
strobe lights mess it up Bobby is talking about the business park thing

424
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,240
saying most escape rooms are in a business park and they do fine around

425
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,600
here last night we just do one last night and it's way far back in a

426
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:45,040
business park and it was pretty hopping yeah those escape rooms everyone that

427
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,640
I've been to is in like a business park too but they advertise they get out

428
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:53,040
there they do stuff online and like they really they could utilize like print

429
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,200
advertising I think would really help them like a mailer or something like

430
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,120
that so people know they're there only reason I found them is because I was

431
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,120
searching for laser tech places in the area like I wonder you know where

432
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:06,500
haven't I been yet and I was like oh this one's I didn't even know this was

433
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:10,380
here you know and so I found it that way it ended up being pretty decent it's

434
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:13,980
just they need them they need to get in touch with an arcade vendor to put some

435
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:17,500
arcade games in that damn thing because they're pushing like on their birthday

436
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,740
packages oh yeah you can get like additional tokens and stuff like that

437
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:25,520
but to play what there's like literally nothing there like I I'm gonna at some

438
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:29,100
point film some stuff and like put it up I thought about like reviewing laser tag

439
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,640
places I thought that'd be kind of fun at some point so as soon as I get a

440
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,680
camera set up to do that because only we had a camera in our pockets that goes

441
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:41,120
with us everywhere we go well you know I do but like I'm talking about my action

442
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:46,000
project of it yeah so I do want to do that because if you it would be fun to

443
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,840
go out you know review a bunch of places and stuff just from a perspective of

444
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:56,200
someone that played a lot of laser tag and so yeah I'm having a lot of fun with

445
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,160
it I just wish I wish there's more people there because really on a

446
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:03,040
Saturday night there should be quite a few people or even like during the day

447
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:07,360
like when we went there last week there was birthday parties going through and

448
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,920
it was pretty good but like this week there there's no one there you know and

449
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:15,480
Kai's you know had made a funny comment earlier to saying you can play laser tag

450
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:20,760
in your house in VR on psvr rec room and VR laser tag is a good plan B when the

451
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:24,840
places are not popping true but it's just not the same thing it's like it's

452
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:28,880
like saying you know you can play a football game on your you know Xbox or

453
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,880
you can go play football for real it is and and I like you know I like the games

454
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,240
where it actually feels like their skill involved in it like the first one I play

455
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:42,120
the reason I was not really attracted to that game at all is because like I can

456
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:46,040
tell I can hit I'm a pretty good shot with hitting people in games I used to

457
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,320
bounce shots off walls and stuff like that and do all sorts of crazy shit

458
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:53,480
because I believe you know I've played several thousand games of laser tag and

459
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:59,400
I you know the place I play now it's just you know I can hit people just as

460
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:04,160
well as I could before and cues are this other place we went to today those guns

461
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:08,800
I swear to God fucking suck like I could not hit shit with those guns and

462
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,720
it's definitely the guns because like you're aiming straight on the person's

463
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:18,200
just like standing there and you just can't hit anything with it and it's just

464
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,320
the equipment it really sucks because it's good for like if you just have a

465
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,400
bunch of kids running around they don't give a shit you know then that's fine

466
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:28,280
but like for someone that actually wants to play it you know and actually get

467
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,360
good at it and play it with people that want to play competitively you can't

468
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,360
when it's just like it's fucking random that your shit's gonna work or not so

469
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,900
anyways that's enough talking about that that's fine moving on to my gaming week

470
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:42,400
so as you guys know after last week's show was a shorter show because I went

471
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:46,960
to Chicago on business for the week so I was out of town Monday through Friday

472
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:52,360
so that really kind of put a cramp or in my ability to do gaming but I did

473
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:57,560
play a shit ton of Mario maker 2 on the flight and you might wonder how do you

474
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,480
play Mario maker 2 and your RNA have played easy I was playing the single

475
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,040
player campaign pretty much the whole way I was yeah I mean I'm sure there's a

476
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,840
lot to play there yeah there is and I'm probably I'm still only probably about

477
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:10,360
like 50% of the way through because I'm very stubborn and I refuse to use the

478
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:15,040
tools that will help you get through like if like if you die twice then the

479
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,840
little Luigi bag comes up and says do you need help dummy like it doesn't say

480
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,720
it that way but that's kind of like fuck you Luigi I don't need your fucking help

481
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,800
so and as you know and I realize some people probably take full-on advantage

482
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,020
of it right away and that's fine play games how you want to play games but I'm

483
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:31,760
like no I'm gonna be a little more stubborn I really want to see because

484
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,960
you know I feel like I make progress every time yeah and there were some like

485
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,880
it's not just like you get this assortment of levels but then if you

486
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:42,000
kind of like explore around the castle there's like this dog that offers you

487
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,280
levels underdog or whatever offers you levels too and his levels can be really

488
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,560
hard so I feel like in some of those levels I like make a little bit of

489
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,920
progression every time so you know if I have four hours to kill on a flight I'm

490
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,800
fine with you know trying to make a little bit I wish they have like you

491
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,600
know advanced tutorials in those games it's a new dog all of the likes you

492
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,920
know advanced techniques like the shell jumps and stuff like that that you see

493
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:08,080
like speed runners and like kaizo runners dudes like yeah say how do I get

494
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,640
good at that stuff or let's not even let's let's step back let's not even go

495
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:16,880
to good how do I do that I would say I'm like half only halfway through the

496
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,520
campaign and I think I've had to play like 25 levels and then some to you know

497
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:25,520
so there's a lot of levels in there to play so yeah I was I was plenty fine

498
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,000
entertained with Mario maker 2 and single-player modes that was pretty much

499
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,240
like my flight I did I watched a movie as well but then on the way back the

500
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:37,520
frickin like the headphone jack and the little TV didn't work so I was gonna

501
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,280
watch another movie but it couldn't I couldn't do anything so I was like I

502
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,320
just played that and then I played bejeweled on this because that you know

503
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:47,120
how the airplane things seat backs have games on them I don't know I just played

504
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:52,400
bejeweled on the on the airplane so there was that because there's so few

505
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,240
cell phone games that'll work when it has to be an airplane mode you know so

506
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:59,800
so that put a cramp in my gaming week except of the survivor LARP I'm sure

507
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,880
you're all ready for updates on that right because I was able to play that

508
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,000
and that was very intense a lot's been going on so remember my game started

509
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,360
with 22 people so the 10th place person was just voted out tonight there's nine

510
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:17,440
people left and I'm one of them and they announced tonight that we are all the

511
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,760
finalists and the jury so there's so I've at least made the jury so for those

512
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,920
of you that watch or follow survivor you know that like that's a big like

513
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:31,520
accomplishment you're in every episode at that point that's yay so that's

514
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,400
that's kind of that's kind of good I mean obviously I can't again I don't

515
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,760
know who's watching so I can't talk a lot about the strategical stuff all I

516
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:45,600
can say was that today was like a big day so yeah it was a lot going on so you

517
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,200
know it's getting more and more intense do you want to see what we had to do

518
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,280
for the last immunity challenge our first individual immunity challenge

519
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,020
would you all like to see it sure last week you guys got to hear about the

520
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:57,360
talking thing right yes now I'm gonna show you a physical one so because this

521
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,400
is a physical one for the sake of the podcasters could you guys narrate what

522
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:08,480
I'm doing please yes okay all right so it's cup stacking you're doing cup

523
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:16,440
stacking okay stacking cups so he's gotten small end with the big end on top

524
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:21,440
and then big end so it looks like an hourglass and then he's taking it and

525
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:29,880
flipping it over sideways holding it together so he's holding it that way

526
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:38,440
how long did you hold it yeah without using glue it's it's it looks

527
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:42,000
deceptively easy doesn't it because the first time I know that's right they

528
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,760
explained it to us I practiced it and I was like this is much easier than the

529
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,000
last cup stacking thing we had to do this is fine but you know it's about the

530
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,640
small so I went for about 15 minutes and my understanding is the person who won

531
00:38:54,640 --> 00:39:00,640
immunity went for about 28 minutes and basically what happens is that as you're

532
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,400
kind of holding it and because you have the again for the podcast listeners you

533
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,280
kind of like if you stack four cups but you do them inverted each time so you

534
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,880
have like a big and small and big and smallest so you kind of do it that way

535
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,480
and then you flip it over it is supposed to be inspired by an actual survivor

536
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,480
challenge that was on the Micronesia season season which was the last

537
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,720
immunity challenge which I believe is a similar thing they had to hold like a

538
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,600
stack of things horizontally that normally would be vertical that type of

539
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:27,880
thing so um and your forearms start to hurt after a while because what happens

540
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,800
is that if there's even the slightest movement in the cup which is what

541
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,520
happened to me about ten minutes in well I just had a movement I breathed wrong I

542
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:38,080
don't know one of my cups slipped just a little bit and so now you're pushing

543
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,960
together tighter because you're like shit they're not like the grip is kind

544
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,160
of gone so you have to move them together tighter and then that starts to

545
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:48,720
hurt your forearms faster and so it's very very interesting but I mean what an

546
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,440
easy what an easy little thing to do that kind of makes for an interesting

547
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:57,120
challenge but I think a lot of those type of online games have like minute to

548
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:59,960
win it I use it you remember that old game show minute to win it they have

549
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,880
those minute to win it style challenges so that was that was kind of what it was

550
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:09,280
so anyways SSG100Matt says is Rob gonna judge the fuck out of people

551
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,720
uh-huh especially if I get voted out uh-huh

552
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:16,320
Sia Tabiri says so are you gonna be the Thorgy who makes the right decision

553
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:20,000
absolutely I will make the right decision at the end of the game well

554
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,480
why y'all assuming I'm gonna be on the jury won't I be in the finals why are

555
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,680
you all quick to assume I'm getting voted yeah but no one trusts Thorgy

556
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:31,720
anyway cuz it's a what he's a white guy with dreads all right anyway so that's

557
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:35,360
that's the update on that so yeah that supposedly survivor is done in less than

558
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:39,120
two weeks I've been playing that game for a fucking month and I'm like I like

559
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:45,280
it's it's so like mentally draining like if I ever talk about that I do this type

560
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,880
of shit again and it's not like all-stars or something like that like

561
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,600
it's just like Oh Rob signed up for another game like you guys have

562
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,280
permission to just like push me and start smacking me with the microphones

563
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,920
over and over and beat some sense into me you have my permission so all right

564
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:03,600
but I am having fun and I'm meeting some really good people so that's cool all

565
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:08,400
right anyway um that was my gaming week let's talk a little bit about other

566
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:14,240
things going on in gaming news so Loki watch stars off some gaming news so we

567
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:18,200
talked a little bit about the joy con drift thing that was an issue last week

568
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,360
that people started pointing out a little bit more and there's a

569
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:27,240
class-action lawsuit so Nintendo is kind of addressed the issue by basically

570
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:33,640
repairing these joy cons for free now and so what they're gonna be doing is

571
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:38,520
allowing customers to be able to send them in they no longer have to request

572
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:44,720
to provide proof of purchase for the joy con repairs they just basically send

573
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:50,480
them in and it gets repaired and then if you did pay for repair previously

574
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,200
they're gonna refund your money that you spent on that so that's good I mean

575
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,280
they've taken advantage of this at some point and it sounds like they've kind of

576
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,400
been cornered into caving into some of the pressure because last week we were

577
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,320
talking about a class-action lawsuit showing up well I just wish they would

578
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:07,920
just fix the design on it just fix whatever the issue is and then re you

579
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:13,080
know release them with the new you know I don't know the new ones that come out

580
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,960
I guess well then cuz you know in chat says why not just mail everybody new

581
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:19,440
joy cons well obviously that's gonna be that's really expensive because

582
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,200
considering that the fix like the piece of the replacing is really minimal yeah

583
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:28,000
and so to mail out a brand new control that's kind of really and if your joy

584
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,680
cons aren't fucked up they don't want to just send you something that is gonna

585
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:36,600
set is gonna set them back on costs like you know again my joy cons are okay knock

586
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:40,880
on wood you know for now they're fine but it's probably because I don't use my

587
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,960
joy cons that much I play like I was a 90% of my switch gaming is on that pro

588
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,540
controller and the only time I use those joy cons is like traveling when I was

589
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:51,680
like on the plane I did of course I used the joy cons to play Mario maker 2

590
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:56,040
because getting out the pro controller and the switch on an airplane that's a

591
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:01,200
bit much but using the joy cons and all that was was a little bit more like you

592
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,240
know like like a Game Boy or something you know yeah really big Game Boy

593
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:08,640
basically so yeah so that's about the one time I really used to joy cons but

594
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,960
even then I'm still kind of using them attached to the system so I think it's

595
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:15,120
still a different type of wear and tear than when you you know have them and

596
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:18,520
you're you know waving them around or doing other stuff you don't have like

597
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:25,560
third-party joy cons yet I mean I get it that you know that it'd be limited but

598
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:29,520
like I'm imagining something that's like attached to this kind of a pro controller

599
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,800
type of controller or something like that I mean a little bit beefier that

600
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,480
you be able to that have different analog six or something would be kind

601
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:40,400
of nice now cuz you and chat says no no he's always clarifying what you're

602
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:43,680
saying saying I mean you call them up say it's jacked up and they mail you a

603
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:48,280
new one case by case like Xbox just sent everyone a refurb when it red-ringed oh

604
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:53,320
yes the coffins they would send you you have to send them your Xbox yeah so I

605
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,840
get but in a way that is kind of what because Nintendo is offering to fix

606
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:58,640
these right so but you're just not necessarily sending them you're taking

607
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,480
them in right yeah you'd sell the mail it to them I would think it's just like

608
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:10,920
the Xbox 360 I thought maybe they had like a network of approved fixers no no

609
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:15,240
one can do that in store even like GameStop has their own like remember in

610
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:18,360
the back of the PlayStation manual and it would say here's the approved Sony

611
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:24,040
like repair shops oh I don't be like you and all of Northern California yeah but

612
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:29,320
yeah no one really does that nowadays but yeah it's nice to see that they're

613
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:33,600
taking care of this but really you know it shouldn't take a class-action lawsuit

614
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:37,240
to finally get around to actually fixing an issue yeah it was a little bit

615
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:40,400
slow-moving I think in that regard but I mean it's it's good that they're at

616
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,440
least like stepping up and trying to fix it as opposed to just trying to shove it

617
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,720
under the rug you know and I think we kind of we kind of knew this it's a

618
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:51,040
better approach to take then what happened with the red ring where it's

619
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:55,200
like oh it's a small it's just a small amount of users that are affected by it

620
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,800
you know nip it in the ass now considering the price to fix it is

621
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:03,520
probably pretty minimal yeah yeah it would just be all those shipping costs

622
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:07,960
but a giant company like Nintendo gets you know buku contracts on on shipping

623
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:12,000
and stuff you know so I'm sure it's not you know bad so all right well let's

624
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,800
move on and talk about something that's going on with a Nintendo game I think a

625
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,480
lot of people were excited about Fire Emblem that came out over this weekend

626
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:22,360
right I think Fire Emblem was out on Friday so I know some people I saw some

627
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,520
people on Twitter talking about it I have to admit not a series I super get

628
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:31,920
into I'm not as into the tactical games unless it's Final Fantasy Tactics no

629
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,600
hate I understand why people like their fire emblem but it's just you know one

630
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,880
of those games I just don't get around to but a very interesting change

631
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:41,880
happening with file a fire emblem fire emblem three houses is going to be

632
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,040
getting it and that's the game that just came out it's going to be getting a

633
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:49,080
patch that will replace the male protagonists voice so Nintendo has

634
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:54,520
re-recorded the lines for male Blythe that is the name of the male

635
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:59,800
protagonist because the voice actor Chris Niosi has had some allegations

636
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:03,920
that have shown up against abusive behavior apparently he's also been

637
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,000
accused of having a tendency to break and da's he has been in other games

638
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,520
including Octopath Traveler Pokemon and Sailor Moon so he has been replaced by

639
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:19,600
Zack Aguilar from the games One Punch Man and Hunter x Hunter and he was in

640
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:25,000
the mobile game Fire Emblem Heroes so they're gonna basically do that so

641
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:30,040
Nintendo of America had mentioned in a statement after assessing the situation

642
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:34,040
we decided to re-record the characters voiceovers and Fire Emblem three houses

643
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:37,960
and Fire Emblem Heroes with another actor the voiceovers will be included in

644
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:45,200
a future patch the original voice actor Niosi put an apology on tumblr after an

645
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,880
ex-girlfriend called him out for emotional abuse and so forth and he has

646
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:53,160
admitted to horribly mistreating and abusing friends colleagues and even his

647
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:57,760
significant others so big yikes to all that but definitely sounds like somebody

648
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,920
Nintendo did not want to be associated with anymore I couldn't help but be

649
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:06,880
reminded of sorts of I feel like we just had a story like two three months ago

650
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:11,040
about Yakuza game right or yeah it was like Sega's Yakuza game it was a

651
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:17,120
different type of Yakuza game right where I was saying it was a spin-off no

652
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:23,520
no it well it was I think it was a spin-off but it was a Yakuza game okay

653
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:29,200
and they ended up replacing the guy in that who was alcoholism a relative no he

654
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:34,360
was like doing cocaine and drugs drugs are super yeah he's a actor in Japan

655
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,680
yeah because I think I've seen him before somewhere I remember he was like

656
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:43,040
a familiar-looking guy like was he like he must have been in some movie that

657
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:47,360
raises anyway so he was replaced in that and it was kind of like oop he just

658
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:51,120
vanished from the game but the interesting thing about patches is that

659
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:57,200
it's you know I and I'm not you know what this guy did is is pretty gross and

660
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,960
I understand why Nintendo doesn't want to be associated but you know there's

661
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:05,520
going to be those collector collectible people who are gonna be like well I want

662
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:09,720
to play the version that has the original guy in it because it's gonna be

663
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:14,960
the more rare version so if I take my switch offline I can hear that one even

664
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,840
though in this day and age of YouTube you would think well if you really just

665
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:21,000
want to hear the subtle differences between the two interpretations the

666
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,560
character there's gonna be YouTube's galore and things like that but it is it

667
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:30,240
does create this interesting like pre patch I guess space of trying to see

668
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:34,000
things before they were changed and I would think even in the case of the

669
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,360
Yakuza game that got flipped there's probably the same type of fascination I

670
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:42,840
suppose going on I think there's a good word for it fascination you know even if

671
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:46,240
you're like you know you understand with the reasons everything like that there's

672
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:50,600
still that that curiosity about I wonder what it sounded like originally if that

673
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:54,160
makes sense hmm interesting because Bobby brings up a completely different

674
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:57,440
type of situation with voice actor replacement talking about justice for

675
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,960
Peter Dinklage which you might remember he was the original voice actor in

676
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:08,320
destiny for the little shit I forgot that thing's name the ghost destiny

677
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:12,720
goes right so he was the original voice that little thing and he wasn't very

678
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,600
good no it wasn't it wasn't very it wasn't very well done so in one of the

679
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:20,760
later I think was expansions like just in the middle of the night Nolan North

680
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:26,720
came and replaced him like just came across the wall and replaced him as the

681
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,080
voice actor and Peter Dinklage was suddenly patched out and that's it but

682
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:33,000
that's an interesting scenario too because you know you kind of have to

683
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,640
download those patches because destiny isn't always online persistent type of

684
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,280
game yeah I don't think that's the case with something like fire emblems or you

685
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:45,020
know that Yakuza game we had a little while ago well nowadays it is I guess

686
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:49,160
remember they did some we had some similar sign into your network account

687
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:51,560
they haven't you I don't want to spoil what's coming up but you all know it's

688
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:57,480
they had a recall member of a little big planet remember that because the all

689
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:00,720
right because the music there was the music was in there and I had one of the

690
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:04,200
original versions that had like the license hadn't really cleared for it

691
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,980
the disc got out anyway yeah well it was you know wasn't that is because there

692
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:14,040
was language in there it was it was some foreign words that was offensive somehow

693
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:20,880
and so right and so that they had to take this on religion or religious

694
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:25,080
thing and they were that that can be shaky ground you know so but I did have

695
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:29,960
the original version of that which I had it in there before they pulled it because

696
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:34,720
they recalled all of them I didn't send my back um I think I ended up selling it

697
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:39,760
later on but yeah it was it was gonna cry and sell it for enough yeah

698
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:45,760
interest was patched out later too so yeah let's see going to chat over at a

699
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:52,440
twitch.tv slash bog network pistol pakas in chat says I mean if you have a cart

700
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:56,640
copy the patch isn't gonna overwrite that data right no I would imagine it

701
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,960
wouldn't so I mean all you would have to do is delete the local data for the game

702
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:03,480
from your switch and it's only gonna be I mean you may not be able to play

703
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:07,540
online you may not be able to do some of the things that because I believe if you

704
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:11,160
do not have the most current version of a Nintendo game it won't let you play

705
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:14,560
online until you patch it but you can play it offline and connect it to the

706
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:18,160
internet and that's how you know I imagine people would do it but most

707
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:21,840
people aren't gonna bat an eyelash or they they just put their switch on the

708
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:24,920
dock overnight and it's on their home network so the thing's just gonna update

709
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:28,280
whether you want it to or not and most people are never gonna know that this

710
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:32,520
voice actor was just suddenly replaced but yeah it's just it's just it's also

711
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:37,080
this interesting day and age that we live in where they can do that type of

712
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:41,520
stuff where they can remove music from Grand Theft Auto San Andreas because

713
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:45,120
they run out of the license runs out yeah patch it out of the game which is

714
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:48,960
annoying sg100 Matt reminds us of another case recently John Tron was

715
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:53,200
taken out of ukulele because there's you know controversy there as well so we'll

716
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:57,080
just leave it at that so there's what happens when you're a shit to people so

717
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:03,160
yeah well don't be a shit to people for one but yeah so anyway okay so better to

718
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:09,000
be the shit then be a shit okay so we kind of touched a little bit tangentially

719
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,720
there another issue that's all over the internet this week so dark Sakura tell

720
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:19,280
me a little bit about what's going on here Oh shenanigans oh sorry real quick

721
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,000
because quest buster with a great comment about this isn't just games in

722
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,560
this day and age quest buster says reminds me when Ridley Scott literally

723
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:32,400
reshot everything that had Kevin Spacey in it for his movie all the money in the

724
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:36,000
world replacing with Christopher Plummer that's right they do that in movies too

725
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:42,320
so obviously Kevin Spacey yikes so they reshot everything that was somebody else

726
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:46,600
and didn't I think that Christopher Plummer got an Oscar nomination for it

727
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,960
because I think in Hollywood you know they kind of you know Hollywood's a

728
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,840
weird it's almost like they kind of knew like he did that last minute until it so

729
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,840
he kind of got an Oscar nom for it was interesting anyway all right now we can

730
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,680
move on sorry I thought that was a very interesting comment like oh it's not

731
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:04,400
just games well okay so as a lot of people know the first three doom games

732
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:09,680
kind of had this mass release on consoles and mobile devices but it had

733
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:17,720
this Bethesda login requirement and remember playing doom on the PC back in

734
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:20,760
the day when you had to log into your Bethesda account in order to get

735
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:25,520
connected on doom 2 with your friends yeah exactly it's like login to be net

736
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:31,160
remember that Bina is battle net also like what is that about Bina is battle

737
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:40,520
net well it anyway they are patching that out it caused a lot of memes it was

738
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:46,320
great but they put out an announcement and I'll just read it directly this came

739
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:51,680
out on the 27th so this was yesterday update on our new classic doom releases

740
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:56,160
the Bethesda net login requirement was included for the Slayer's Club to reward

741
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:00,240
members for playing the classic doom games the login should be optional and

742
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:04,000
we're working on changing the requirement to optional now we're just

743
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:09,920
trying to help you know the best part about that is players club so like since

744
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:14,000
they got rid of the original versions they delisted those which had

745
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:20,080
multiplayer by the way and then these don't have the online multiplayer they

746
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:25,160
don't have the online multiplayer the whole point why the fuck else do you

747
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:28,280
play doom 2 for the story local multiplayer reading playboy for the

748
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:33,200
articles get the fuck out anyway honestly I'd never liked to play

749
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:38,120
multiplayer doom I like to multiplayer Duke Nukem but I didn't like to play

750
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:42,040
doom multiplayer I just like to play by myself I love to doom to multiplayer I

751
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:46,280
used to there was a BBS we would call into and it would help connect your doom

752
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:51,320
games and I was I think I was rocking my was it my 386 still didn't know what

753
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:55,600
could have it I think was my 486 for a 100 megahertz at the time and I would

754
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:59,840
play doom in a tiny ass window so that I could actually have the fluid motion

755
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:05,200
when I was playing online it was so fun like kids today wouldn't understand I

756
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:09,120
had black and white doom format classic that I would sneak and play during the

757
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:16,120
middle of my typing class in college at any rate you know the games are out now

758
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:24,720
doom and doom 2 or 499 and doom 3 is 999 and you can play them on iOS and Xbox

759
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:31,240
PlayStation for Xbox one Nintendo switch and Android so yeah none of them have

760
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:37,640
the multiplayer we don't really that is so stupid because I have the one on

761
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:43,120
Xbox 360 which they made backwards compatible with Xbox one so it's in your

762
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:46,960
Xbox one library and as far as I remember you can still play that one

763
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:50,600
online I don't know anybody else with ad listen to that so you can't sell so that

764
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:55,800
you can't get it again you can't buy it we'll just build some 486 and have some

765
00:55:55,800 --> 00:56:00,160
land go on seriously we need to do we need to do a PC do night hell yeah or

766
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:04,240
Duke Nukem honestly Duke Nukem was the best at all I like the voice macros oh

767
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:09,560
yeah like Duke Nukem was like the the creme de la creme of those 90 shooters I

768
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:13,120
think because that's the one I remember playing in the college dorm we would be

769
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:16,480
yelling each other from down the hall like when we get killed that was those

770
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:23,160
were the days anyway so what were some of your favorite memes you guys saw of

771
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:27,560
course Bobby black ones Bobby black wolf in our chat he did a little thing on his

772
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:30,960
podcast I hit a little graphic that came up that said yet needed Bethesda

773
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:34,360
announcement can't counsel listen to podcast I'm sure somebody clipped it and

774
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:37,320
it's over on Twitch I'll be honest I didn't really see all that many he also

775
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:40,880
did one for his Tesla which is funny oh yeah the one he did for his Tesla was

776
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:45,040
funny yeah I saw Tesla being towed yesterday that wasn't Bobby's Tesla

777
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,880
Bobby did something on Twitter where I think there must be a drawing app or

778
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:52,160
something on those big screens and he put like you must log into your

779
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,920
Bethesda net account to turn on your car so that's something like that I'm

780
00:56:54,920 --> 00:57:00,640
paraphrasing but yeah that was pretty funny yeah I thought there were I just

781
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:03,720
thought some of the classic 8-bit memes were great with the whole like you know

782
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,880
you must log into your Bethesda net account to find our princess in another

783
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:10,760
castle you know things like that just good stuff you got it you got to love

784
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:15,320
Twitter going crazy with the memes good stuff anyway it's always fun when

785
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:22,520
Bethesda is a joke which is all the time nowadays I just why would you put out

786
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:26,360
something again like I get the whole like oh we want to put doom on iOS and

787
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:33,240
and all that stuff why would you take out the multiplayer like just I'll take

788
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:37,280
I don't want to run the multiplayer servers for five thousand please I guess

789
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:40,400
I don't know I don't know what that's all about that's unfortunate isn't there

790
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:44,680
some reddit out there I swear to God I saw some reddit where it was like will

791
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:49,560
it run doom and it's them installing do because the doom source code was public

792
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:53,840
some time ago I think I think they made it for somebody so they get doom running

793
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:57,560
all these things because I remember recently there was some type of exploit

794
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:01,080
within it was either the Harry Potter game or Pokemon go game one of those

795
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:05,280
games you could launch a full-on web browser from within the game so somebody

796
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:09,880
had them playing doom within Pokemon go and like that's the type of shit you see

797
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:14,000
on reddit we're like you know running it's called like running doom or doom I

798
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:18,160
don't know but it's it's what what can you install doom on so it's it's weird

799
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:22,080
that this is so timed where it's like yay we got doom on iOS and all this

800
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:29,840
stuff but we fucking changed it it's a little silly no no just just played on

801
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:34,800
PC like you have a PC that runs I know if you have a PC you have a PC that runs

802
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:39,240
doom you sure do Bobby Blackwell says yeah you know this will open next year's

803
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:42,800
e3 presser you think they're gonna be that tongue-in-cheek enough to start

804
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:46,080
their e3 presser and then have a splash screen saying you must have your

805
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:49,840
Bethesda net account to continue I could see them phrasing it a different way to

806
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:52,800
poke fun at it they might say it like they might show a sample login screen

807
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:57,360
please log into your Bethesda account and then the person I would think that

808
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:00,240
they are not gonna do that and the reason because we're talking like

809
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:06,080
almost a year away I mean why bring that memes shelf why bring why bring that

810
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:11,200
back up why why remind people that you fucked up in a way because I'm sure

811
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:16,440
between now and June of next year they're gonna fuck up in it dozens of

812
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:20,960
ways that are gonna be far greater than what we have with just doom so honestly

813
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,400
think next year's e3 presser they just open with the theme from the Elder

814
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:29,720
Scrolls and then show show off Elder Scrolls 6 and it's just like this at

815
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:33,760
this point at this point they should just fucking mock the South Park I'm

816
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:39,360
sorry video and just have Todd Howard apologizing to be fair to the folks in

817
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:43,640
chat as 200 Matt says they were able to joke about themselves about fallout 76

818
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:47,240
they will rip themselves plenty oh yes and that worked out so well for them

819
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:51,620
they brought up fallout 76 stuff as soon her Matt says they made jokes about the

820
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:54,960
arrow to the knee stuff in the presser do you know like I've heard that joke

821
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:58,780
was in Mortal Kombat 11 oh yeah I heard that arrow to the knee stuff so fucking

822
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:03,120
much that when I was do you remember I randomly started playing Skyrim VR when

823
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:06,440
I was like getting in place in VR like I got to the point where the guy really

824
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:10,520
says that and I did I'm like is this guy being a meep oh no oh this is the

825
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:16,880
actual arrow to the knee part like I had that like whoa meta moment type of thing

826
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:21,040
going on like oh it's an arrow to the knee Joe oh wait no this this is the

827
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:24,820
arrow to the knee line I am it was great it's like you have those guards to say

828
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:28,520
that and then they run straight up to a dragon started hitting it with a sword

829
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:35,240
and get like torched by fire and they're like yeah I was actually watching like

830
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:39,800
all the intros on Mortal Kombat 11 to get the references and it's totally a

831
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:45,280
line even today yeah my favorite is the mod for Skyrim whenever they say that

832
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:51,400
line they get struck by lightning see a tiberian chat says it's like right in

833
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:55,920
front of my salad oh I still use that today in fact I was I think the last

834
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,960
time I used it was in one of these type of games I think it was like the

835
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,440
survivor II type games I think it was a different one that was going faster and

836
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:04,240
something happened that I didn't like and I said to the other person I was

837
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:09,000
like really right in front of my salad you're gonna do that so those those

838
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:17,580
memes oh you know so there was a gay porn that was shot and I don't know what

839
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:21,440
they're doing oh they're full-on like having sex in the kitchen but they're

840
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:27,440
doing it like the counter is up here so they're like down here and the girl who

841
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:30,740
I don't know if she's supposed to be somebody's girlfriend or she's like you

842
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:34,480
know the the fruit fly the flame dame type of thing or what but she's like

843
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:38,600
eating your salad and she's like she looks and she goes are you guys fucking

844
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:43,760
and she goes really right in front of my salad that's pretty great and honestly

845
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:48,160
that would be me it was I'd be like don't do that in the kitchen that's in

846
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:53,880
sanitary it was it was improved I think and now of course of course she is now

847
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:57,640
like famous you know she's making her coin off that whole thing I think they

848
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:01,640
put her in legit movies and stuff you know they made a sequel to a poor she's

849
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:05,400
not even a porn actress she was just like the salad chick but now she's

850
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:10,360
getting in all these porns because she's the salad girl she's the solid salad

851
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:15,080
tosser but honestly that would be I'd just be like that's unsanitary don't do

852
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:20,560
pixel pakka says that porn company has a weird thing about girls discovering the

853
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:25,520
screwing and Sia Tiberi says it's the girlfriend the one guy is pretending to

854
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:29,240
be an in-home cooking class thing for the boyfriend and then it went to like

855
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:36,080
sex okay I guess they thank you all for explaining the plot and for your later

856
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:41,880
brows all s 200 Matt has linked to these safe for work version on YouTube if you

857
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:44,800
wish to go look at that I'm going to assume that there's black bars because

858
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:51,160
it's on YouTube covering up the like I'm offended by I'm just offended by you

859
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:58,760
seen one you see them all I'm afraid that salad dressing oh yeah she's just

860
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:10,440
like it's also the way she says it she's like really anyway tall counter to me

861
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:15,200
baby oh it's a bar nevermind oh I see maybe this whole meme thing does have

862
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:18,400
weight cuz here we are talking about the salad chick and that was like two years

863
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:26,120
ago we are we that I'm saving that now so I can watch it when I get home okay

864
01:03:26,120 --> 01:03:29,880
yeah yeah you got to do homework sure all right anyway let's move on all right

865
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:33,000
Loki then if you don't like this topic how about a new one we'll talk about

866
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:38,120
grand theft auto online and you know there's been an issue with blue boxes

867
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:44,480
being compared to gambling and you know that a lot of companies can get in

868
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:50,280
trouble because of in-game gambling mechanics might kind of run afoul of

869
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:55,200
some online gambling laws well take two said fuck all that let's put gambling in

870
01:03:55,200 --> 01:04:00,600
our games so they opened up the diamond casino in Grand Theft Auto online so you

871
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:06,480
can actually go in there and buy chips and gamble and you win money and of

872
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:10,160
course because this is Grand Theft Auto online you can buy shark cards with real

873
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:15,640
money and get in-game money to gamble with and stuff like that so because of

874
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:25,880
that issue certain countries can actually purchase the in-game cards or

875
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:30,920
even do some of the gambling games in there because of different local laws so

876
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:36,720
for example Iceland Iran Peru and Vietnam are some of the countries that

877
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:45,520
you can't access most of the casino and also that certain things you can't you

878
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:50,280
can't buy the penthouse in the casino as well and you're not actually able to

879
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:56,480
virtually gamble in there so it's interesting that they have to go this

880
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:02,120
route to kind of get around the different laws but what happens when you

881
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:07,160
put actual gambling in your game granted yes you can't actually get real money

882
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:11,360
from this but you can pay real money for in someone with gambling tendencies

883
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:18,040
wants to win that in-game you know money to buy like some fake car in there they

884
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:24,800
may be tempted to drop real-world money to buy chips and so it's kind of an

885
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:28,160
issue no that's something fascinating that I wouldn't have thought about is

886
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:32,960
that you might have like this like real-world gambling you know issue and

887
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:38,840
that you kind of act out through online games because maybe it's less of a

888
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:42,720
problem because it's it's a fake game but in the same time yeah I mean you

889
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:46,800
could get like if someone has gambling tendencies and you're you're betting

890
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:52,240
like fake money you're still gonna have the same response like to that even

891
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:55,000
though you're not winning real money and because of that you're like oh man

892
01:05:55,000 --> 01:06:01,360
no I'm down I just need to I only pay I'm gonna pay ten dollars and we get some

893
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:04,340
more money and then I'm gonna get back on top of him win that money back you

894
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:08,040
could have like that same kind of tendency and they fucking know what

895
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:11,720
they're doing they fucking know what they're doing they know people are gonna

896
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:14,600
there's some people out there they're gonna do that and they don't care

897
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:20,920
because they're making money off of it so it is what it is some people though

898
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:24,520
of course being the internet age are getting around these restrictions by

899
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:29,660
using VPNs because they can so even this won't necessarily stop them but that may

900
01:06:29,660 --> 01:06:34,280
be illegal in your country if you do that interesting all right well let's

901
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:38,360
move on to another topic this is one that I think many of us have

902
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:42,200
unfortunately had to deal with when playing games and maybe you know earlier

903
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:45,520
we were kind of having a laugh about the doom online and the fact that it's been

904
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:49,320
removed but you know some of us maybe aren't playing games online the way we

905
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:53,200
used to and the reason why is because of assholes harassment is really what it

906
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:59,400
is and this week making its way around the gaming blogs is a new survey by the

907
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:04,880
Anti-Defamation League or ADL and as part of their report they reported that

908
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:09,920
as many as two-thirds of online gamers in the US have experienced it had

909
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:13,920
experienced what they called severe harassment half of the responders of the

910
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:20,120
survey said that their race religion ability gender sexual orientation or

911
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:24,720
ethnicity was something that made them a target and 30% claimed they've been

912
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:30,000
doxxed in an online game that one really that seems so high all they had to do is

913
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,880
ask a woman oh yeah no I would have told him it's no it's and don't like I'm

914
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:39,400
absolutely not going like wow I can't believe it's this rampant like don't get

915
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:43,680
me wrong like I'm it's absolutely it's this rampant and I'm sure but I'm just

916
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:52,640
the 30% docs I'm like that's Wow that's scary and a quarter of respondents said

917
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:57,200
that online they have been exposed to white supremacist ideology that also

918
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:02,760
being a part of the ADL report which obviously is a whole nother yikes and

919
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:05,680
you know just leave it at that but unfortunately I think those of us that

920
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:11,800
have been on a rando map online or something unfortunately yeah I've heard

921
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:14,960
all I've heard all that stupid shit when playing things like destiny and

922
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:18,720
halo and that type of stuff online with randos and it's why I really don't like

923
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:23,360
fucking playing with randos online anymore I don't fucking do it on Xbox

924
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:27,640
Live or this Xbox Live is for playing with my friends vog network people are

925
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:31,520
fine because I feel like if you are at the level enough where you want to come

926
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:34,240
hang with us in online clubs and things like that then you kind of know you

927
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:38,080
accept these rules of you're not gonna be a fucking asshole because you know

928
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:43,000
Bobby'll ban you if you do I want like though there to be team mute that you

929
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:47,680
vote and you mute somebody I want to say and I could be wrong I want to say

930
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:51,640
either halo or destiny did put something like that in that if enough people kind

931
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:55,840
of muted somebody that person would be muted but I don't quote me on that but I

932
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:59,840
want to say that is something that has been explored in the I want ostracism to

933
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:05,440
be a thing they have to be careful because some people could use that type

934
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:09,200
of voting system to gang up on an innocent person that's the problem is

935
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:13,920
that the bad guys are gonna use it for their own purposes too that's that's and

936
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:17,080
that's why I think you haven't seen that stuff if stuff implemented more

937
01:09:17,080 --> 01:09:21,800
widespread I just really want like Jean Grey level psychic power so I can reach

938
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:25,880
across the country and smack them in the head because Nazis deserve to be punched

939
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:31,200
misogynists deserve to be punched metal mayhem and chat says not just gamers but

940
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:35,760
streamers too oh sure that's one reason where it's like you know olr we get

941
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:41,160
anywhere between what like 25 maybe 45 maybe 50 at our peak viewers that we get

942
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:46,800
live we have about 33 on right now if my little console is to be believed we have

943
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:49,340
more than that that listen on the podcast feed but you know we have a we

944
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:51,920
have a decently sized crowd that turns up here on Sunday nights and we're

945
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:56,200
really appreciative but I like that we're kind of like at that level where

946
01:09:56,200 --> 01:10:00,820
we're pulling a respectable crowd here people people actually want to listen to

947
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:04,100
what we're doing and we appreciate that I love it and they want to participate

948
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:09,260
in the conversation that's wonderful too but we're not big enough where the

949
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:12,820
fucking haters are coming out or the people that are just there to get a

950
01:10:12,820 --> 01:10:17,940
reaction are coming out like that's a problem that you're more twitch partners

951
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:22,220
and the people that have you know 200 people that watch one of their streams

952
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:25,580
that's the stuff they have to deal with so in a way like you know and I've been

953
01:10:25,580 --> 01:10:28,860
asked kind of point-blank are you are you irritated that you're not more

954
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:33,900
famous and it's one of those things where it's like I don't know like then

955
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:38,140
I if we were bigger we'd have to deal with all that shit and I don't know how

956
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:43,020
I feel about that I kind of I feel like we're almost better off in a way not

957
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:48,980
having to deal with that so um guys you doing chat says I play online a lot and

958
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:54,020
no one ever talks once in a blue moon I think the missing word there I see some

959
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:58,100
nasty text in rocket League but most of the time people never use voice chat it

960
01:10:58,220 --> 01:11:02,140
may also depend on what you're playing and I know I don't use voice chat

961
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:05,300
because I got sick of the things people were saying on voice chat so if I do

962
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:11,340
play games online I don't use it now it is worth saying I do play things like

963
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:16,540
Final Fantasy 14 World of Warcraft in the past I've played those types of MMOs

964
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:22,660
online but I think it's harder to be that much of an asshole in those games

965
01:11:22,660 --> 01:11:27,340
because usually you're working together towards a common goal and if you're

966
01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:31,900
gonna be that guy then you're not gonna get to the goal either and granted don't

967
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:34,820
get me wrong and I know full well know some people exist in in those things

968
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:38,700
only to troll and I've seen my fair share of them in World of Warcraft but

969
01:11:38,700 --> 01:11:42,860
even the trolls will oftentimes end up they end up on block lists and then when

970
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:45,700
they want to do something for real later on they can't because they've pissed

971
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:50,420
everybody off on the server so anyway some other comments I wanted to read

972
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:55,060
about this report and then we can stew on it a little bit if we want online

973
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:58,820
harassment is getting worse and a similar ADL survey this according to

974
01:11:58,820 --> 01:12:03,700
past studies that was conducted earlier in the year talked about that 37% of

975
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:09,540
Americans have experienced severe harassment online online gaming meant

976
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:14,260
when they kind of analyzed that the ADL survey said 65% of players experienced

977
01:12:14,260 --> 01:12:18,820
severe harassment when it's the online gaming now just some things about the

978
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:23,900
survey ADL sampled about a thousand people and to be fair the gaming

979
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:29,460
community at large is trying to figure out what they can do about this for

980
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:33,660
example Phil Spencer from Xbox recently had that post about laying out things

981
01:12:33,660 --> 01:12:37,180
for combating abuse saying that you know gaming is for everyone period

982
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:42,420
overwatch they put in the endorsement feature so that you you kind of reward

983
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:45,420
people as opposed to punishing people and they say that the endorsement

984
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:51,140
feature reduced toxic behavior by 40% so some things to consider but obviously

985
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:57,780
harassment is still a thing I don't know without going too deep what what

986
01:12:57,780 --> 01:13:03,060
can we do about it what can us decent people do about harassment and I think

987
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:05,980
there's definitely like number one I think the obvious thing would be you

988
01:13:05,980 --> 01:13:10,180
know call it out when you see it like if somebody's getting harassed you know as

989
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:12,980
much as you might not want to or something like that you have to kind of

990
01:13:12,980 --> 01:13:17,020
stand up for the underdog a little bit right but I think the reality of the

991
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:20,740
situation is that most of us are just pulling out of these situations where

992
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:24,940
we even get to where the bullies are and like I said I just play with friends

993
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:29,500
done like this is why I don't get in these mixed situations so I don't know

994
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:36,020
thoughts yeah calling it out I think just reporting people that are you know

995
01:13:36,020 --> 01:13:42,900
doing this kind of harassment and I mean I don't know just playing with friends

996
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:48,940
yeah guys you doing chat says anytime I hear a jerk picking on someone I fight

997
01:13:48,940 --> 01:13:53,020
back as Jonah to Matt says the report did say the 88% of players who play

998
01:13:53,020 --> 01:13:57,300
certain games like Warcraft had very positive experiences as voice chats and

999
01:13:57,300 --> 01:14:00,580
you know I think especially like but in Wow and in Final Fantasy and those types

1000
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:04,140
of games you find your guildies you kind of find your tribe you find your people

1001
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:07,060
and you're on voice chat with those people and like people are gonna treat

1002
01:14:07,060 --> 01:14:09,740
each other with respect because again you're helping each other out you're all

1003
01:14:09,740 --> 01:14:13,100
get you're all getting epic purples or whatever the equivalent is in the game

1004
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:17,420
you're playing you know pixel pockets and chat says any game I play I

1005
01:14:17,420 --> 01:14:22,060
immediately mute voice chat for all and I'm silent myself it only took a few

1006
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:25,740
shitty people to make me decide it's not worth it with random people I'll just

1007
01:14:25,740 --> 01:14:29,620
chat with my friends and that's more fun anyway yeah I'm kind of right there with

1008
01:14:29,620 --> 01:14:36,620
you all right well anyhow let's move on and talk about other voice issues right

1009
01:14:36,620 --> 01:14:43,420
dark soccer what do you have well this one um I don't really know how I feel

1010
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:46,900
about it but basically Microsoft is gonna be tweaking their Xbox one

1011
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:51,860
dashboard again and this time they're removing Cortana I don't know it's still

1012
01:14:51,860 --> 01:14:59,260
on PC and Windows 10 right the Cortana interface I don't I believe Cortana

1013
01:14:59,260 --> 01:15:04,380
still on Windows 10 yeah but at any rate they are removing it and redesigning

1014
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:10,340
things and it'll bring everything into one area where you can see it right away

1015
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:16,220
so it's supposed to give you quicker access to your past titles mixer service

1016
01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:22,340
community and Microsoft Store and so they're just I guess in the long run

1017
01:15:22,340 --> 01:15:27,980
trying to make it a more efficient thing but Cortana is going bye-bye I guess they

1018
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:31,340
do need to kind of clean up some of that extra stuff on Xbox one and I can't I

1019
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:34,660
can't think of a time where I've been like Cortana take me to the store to buy

1020
01:15:34,660 --> 01:15:38,220
Castlevania or something you know it's just doesn't really happen but yeah the

1021
01:15:38,220 --> 01:15:41,260
big thing on here is that yeah you can no longer talk to her via your headset

1022
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:46,860
you can still power on your Xbox one through Xbox skill for Cortana on iOS

1023
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:51,420
Android or Windows so that's true because there might be for some people

1024
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:55,580
that might be an accessibility thing so I don't just want to like say well it's

1025
01:15:55,580 --> 01:16:01,060
useless for me so fuck it because I could there could be a very big reason

1026
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:05,660
why it could be an accessibility thing for Cortana to help you navigate there's

1027
01:16:05,660 --> 01:16:13,780
more they basically are refocusing Cortana for the business scenarios and

1028
01:16:13,780 --> 01:16:19,300
are working on conversation recognition but they did decouple her from the

1029
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:26,060
Windows 10 for the May update and they are making Cortana a separate app hmm so

1030
01:16:26,060 --> 01:16:28,700
interesting well it's good that it's still there because I bet there are some

1031
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:32,580
people that kind of need Cortana s2100 Matt and chat says Cortana was

1032
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:36,020
initially used with your Kinect after they killed that off you could still do

1033
01:16:36,020 --> 01:16:40,580
it with your mic now it's gone Bobby Blackwell says I used Xbox record that a

1034
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:45,060
lot but Cortana took it away and mental mayhem says to be honest when I first

1035
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:49,420
got Windows 10 I tried Cortana just for the lulls but it got boring quick all

1036
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:54,060
those comments from our chat room over at twitch TV slash vog network so there

1037
01:16:54,060 --> 01:16:59,420
you go Cortana will no longer be a part of the Xbox one after well unless you

1038
01:16:59,420 --> 01:17:03,900
use some workarounds and things like that after a future update let's move on

1039
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:06,200
a few more stories for you guys then we're gonna get to the classic game of

1040
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:11,540
the week Loki yes so this is kind of neat there's a brand new I don't know

1041
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:19,700
spirit not really unauthorized spiritual successor I guess of Simon's quest so

1042
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:23,700
there's a game that's coming out that someone's working on called Simon quest

1043
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:30,220
Transylvania adventure and it's kind of homage or parody of Simon's quest and

1044
01:17:30,220 --> 01:17:39,580
it's like a indie game that hopefully won't get struck down by you know a DMC

1045
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:43,740
a or something like that but it definitely is got the same type of stuff

1046
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:47,620
that you would see in Simon's quest they said convoluted hints mansions and a

1047
01:17:47,620 --> 01:17:52,180
time system that doesn't make you wait and apparently they're working on a demo

1048
01:17:52,180 --> 01:17:58,780
so this is a the Twitter user program answer and looks pretty cool so far just

1049
01:17:58,780 --> 01:18:04,900
based on the little video that he posted definitely get the vibe of Castlevania a

1050
01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:08,460
little too much though I was gonna say I getting some cease-and-desist vibes on

1051
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:13,180
yeah you know at what point does parody end and copycat yeah I don't get me

1052
01:18:13,180 --> 01:18:17,780
wrong like it looks great it looks really cool like I love the retro vibe

1053
01:18:17,780 --> 01:18:21,220
it's giving and you know and and just how much it kind of invokes Castlevania

1054
01:18:21,220 --> 01:18:24,940
but it's kind of this different thing obviously um and I understand that like

1055
01:18:24,940 --> 01:18:30,660
they're trying to like not use the Castlevania name but Simon quest yeah

1056
01:18:30,660 --> 01:18:33,940
maybe you should have renamed your protagonist maybe why don't they call

1057
01:18:33,940 --> 01:18:36,620
like castle quest or well I guess that was probably a name of the game

1058
01:18:36,620 --> 01:18:41,500
sometime at some point or like you know Simon adventure yes something something

1059
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:49,780
to get it a little more distant from that so hmm it looks neat hope it comes

1060
01:18:49,780 --> 01:18:56,060
out Sia Tabiri suggests Trevor quest in our chat room Trevor quest yeah use one

1061
01:18:56,060 --> 01:19:01,700
of the other all right Belmont's why not yeah I don't know I'm definitely looking

1062
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:06,140
forward to checking out if it actually ends up coming out apparently though

1063
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:12,820
they were supposed to have a playable version of it at Con Bravo so I don't

1064
01:19:12,820 --> 01:19:17,240
know we'll see but I'm guessing there's I'm guessing Konami doesn't exactly have

1065
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:25,120
the rush the rush between you know C and D versus it being out now it's that

1066
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:28,360
stuff at the end of your project tears we're just like hey look I made this

1067
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:36,240
game it's done now you can see India it's too late yeah pixel pocket suggests

1068
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:42,080
the name no me's quest that's Simon backwards SSG 100 Matt suggests the

1069
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:47,320
title love Simon quest I guess how about how about they they could just

1070
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:52,000
change the protagonist Simone's quest Simone's quest own Raven Simone ace

1071
01:19:52,000 --> 01:20:00,560
quest let's not do that why not see a debris just Dracula scavenger hunt the

1072
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:05,640
adventure all right anyway let's move on let's talk a little bit about something

1073
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:09,360
that is going to be going away from the Wii U for those of you that are still

1074
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:12,640
using your Wii U which there might be some of you out there I mean even though

1075
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:15,520
I'm sure many of you have updated to the switch there might be some reasons to

1076
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:21,880
keep your Wii U around but as of September 26th if you do use a Wii U to

1077
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:27,000
watch Amazon Prime video you'll no longer be able to do that prime video

1078
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:31,280
users are starting to get emails letting them know that they no longer to be able

1079
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:35,880
to do that and this is kind of interesting a $25 credit towards buying

1080
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:40,480
fire TV devices to help that feel a little less now I want to just fire up

1081
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:45,680
my Wii U and open the no I'm not gonna get a fire team all right the email says

1082
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:49,280
we are continually upgrading our service and this occasionally means we can no

1083
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:52,480
longer support certain device models to help you continue streaming your

1084
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:55,800
favorite content we're offering you a $25 credit towards select fire TV

1085
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:59,040
devices which will allow you to continue to stream your favorites from prime

1086
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:04,120
video so if you're using the Wii U for this you still have Netflix YouTube and

1087
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:08,240
Hulu today but who knows how much longer that is going to be now it should

1088
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:11,920
be pointed out Amazon Prime is not on the switch some of these you know I

1089
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:15,360
think YouTube's on the switch at this point Hulu's on the switch but not

1090
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:21,000
Slick's no not Netflix Netflix ain't on the switch and Amazon Prime isn't on the

1091
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:26,200
switch so this isn't as easy as just going over to the switch and I will say

1092
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:31,480
you know what I I have used I do remember downloading prime video onto

1093
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:35,800
the Wii U and using it because my broadcast signal from the Wii U was

1094
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:39,640
strong enough where if I had Amazon going on the Wii U I could take the

1095
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:44,440
tablet into the bedroom and watch an episode of Drag Race or something from

1096
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:49,720
the bedroom so you know they're there may be some uses why somebody wants to

1097
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:52,360
take that tablet and watch it somewhere else their house a little portable

1098
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:56,400
television so but I guess at the same time if I wanted to I could just use my

1099
01:21:56,400 --> 01:22:00,840
phone but the Wii U had that kind of bigger screen you know yeah I mean it's

1100
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:05,040
nice but I understand that they don't need they want to support it but I'm not

1101
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:09,280
gonna profess that I've like used it at all ever recently they probably figured

1102
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:14,920
out that the numbers aren't really you know there as far as the number of users

1103
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:21,240
and so it makes sense that they would probably retire mm-hmm let's see I

1104
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:25,080
wanted to read some other comments in chat Bobby Blackwell points out twitch

1105
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:30,200
also isn't on the switch no that's I mean I think we all understand be too

1106
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:33,600
easy twitch on the switch well and we understand that the switch probably

1107
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:38,360
isn't going to let you broadcast stuff because of you know the the parts that

1108
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:40,560
are in it maybe when there's a pro maybe that's something I'm looking at for the

1109
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:45,560
pro hmm who knows we'll just theorize on that oh I have the pros I have a pro

1110
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:50,480
switch to do streaming services I bet that'll be a thing but anyway but it's

1111
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:54,640
surprising that you don't at least just have the twitch like watch stuff client

1112
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:58,560
that is a little weird I think yeah I don't know I'd love to be able to have

1113
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:03,840
that so anyway as 200 Matt says most companies are like this is gone in blank

1114
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:08,000
days if you have problems with this kick rocks yeah so it's it's kind of true

1115
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:12,560
that you know they didn't have to offer the $25 incentive on the fire TV or

1116
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:17,600
whatever but they are but I think Amazon probably discounted the price by 25 bucks

1117
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:23,120
on Prime Day anyway if not more than that so I'm sure Amazon takes a loss I

1118
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:27,240
mean because it's almost like game consoles the more fire TVs that are in

1119
01:23:27,240 --> 01:23:31,720
home the more people that are likely to buy stuff on the Amazon Prime video

1120
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:35,720
thing so it kind of suits them to have that in as many places as possible so I

1121
01:23:35,720 --> 01:23:43,360
don't think this is just them being the nice guy if you will all right anyhow as

1122
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:48,920
200 Matt says maybe it'll let you stream from the switch but only at 480 P let's

1123
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:52,960
see your streams are gonna be crap quality all right let's move on to the

1124
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:56,840
classic game of the week every week dark soccer steps in the gaming vault and

1125
01:23:56,840 --> 01:24:00,120
finds a game that she thinks hey you guys should be remembering this game

1126
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:03,440
this week I'm kind of surprised you're doing this game this week this is a big

1127
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:06,880
one and I thought you might have would save this for an anniversary show or

1128
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:11,040
something yeah yeah I thought we'd already done this one too I also thought

1129
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:14,600
we'd already done this one I think just with me being kind of in music game mode

1130
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:18,560
it stuck out in my head it's fair and it's also one of those congratulations

1131
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:22,360
this game is 10 years old type of moments actually right now it's 12 years

1132
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:26,120
old all right so what is the game rock band there you go so I just want to

1133
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:30,080
point out usually on the podcast we have a little bit of the game's audio in

1134
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:34,160
the background um however tonight we have removed the audio just because we

1135
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:38,480
don't want to risk a twitch muting for the copyright music so we only have the

1136
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:44,040
visual writing on twitch you can get like something like Charlene I'm right

1137
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:47,560
behind you or whatever like I just I didn't want to risk it even with the

1138
01:24:47,560 --> 01:24:52,200
freebie songs so it's fine if you yeah y'all probably you're already familiar

1139
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:55,080
with rock band I imagine this crowd pretty familiar with rock band already

1140
01:24:55,080 --> 01:25:02,000
yeah anyway so rock band is a music game is developed by harmonix it was

1141
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:08,360
published by MTV games and distributed by EA and we are talking about the first

1142
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:15,200
game in the series it was out for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 released on

1143
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:20,760
November 20th 2007 and there was a PlayStation 2 version it was released

1144
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:30,680
December 18th 2007 so also a Wii version on June 22nd 2008 harmonix had

1145
01:25:30,680 --> 01:25:36,480
also developed the guitar hero series and then when the guitar hero was sent

1146
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:43,280
off to never soft harmonix made the new game with multi-instrument gameplay so

1147
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:48,640
sort of like having your guitar in one game instead of spread out amongst all

1148
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:54,080
of the various you know I guess it actually was kind of like the guitar

1149
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:58,240
you know by having the multiple instruments except you you know it grew

1150
01:25:58,240 --> 01:26:05,840
from there from just you know guitar and drum and mic and there have been like a

1151
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:11,800
bajillion sequels you know of rock band so we won't even be getting into there

1152
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:17,880
but basically you've got your different peripherals you have you know of course

1153
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:20,960
your on-screen interface is what controls how you're supposed to do it

1154
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:24,760
with the mic you have to sing to relative pitch to the original vocal so

1155
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:28,160
I know some people who just may as well not fucking use the mic because they

1156
01:26:28,160 --> 01:26:31,960
can't you know hold a tune in a bag

1157
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:38,240
there's nothing also by the way that will set off like my own self loathing

1158
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:43,280
of my voice than playing ink on the mic in garage band just saying I hate

1159
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:49,600
hearing myself out of key but you know you also have you know your guitar one

1160
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:55,600
person can be bass and you've got your drum kit later on of course you know we

1161
01:26:55,600 --> 01:27:01,280
got the piano and the cymbals and all these other goodies so at any rate you

1162
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:07,160
build up your score you get different multipliers and you have an overdrive

1163
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:13,000
that lets you just you know apparently play really awesome and then you can use

1164
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:17,880
like on the guitar you use your whammy bar for like using effectors for how

1165
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:22,080
you're playing you know example you've got different difficulty levels easy

1166
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:27,960
medium hard and expert and if you don't play well enough you get muted out of

1167
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:36,880
the song so there you go um the PlayStation 2 and we version didn't have

1168
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:42,480
any customizable options for your player but Xbox 360 and ps3 did so you could

1169
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:46,480
change their physique their clothes tattoos the way they move all kinds of

1170
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:53,960
stuff and then you know again we had a the guitar was based off the Fender

1171
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:59,200
Stratocaster you had you know your your drum pedals you also have like your game

1172
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:03,400
modes like band world tour where you could play in different venues and

1173
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:07,560
unlock things and customize your character even more you also have like

1174
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:15,320
solo play you have a solo tour and the soundtrack pretty massive so they

1175
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:20,640
reached out to five record labels that provided most of the master recordings

1176
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:28,160
including EMI Hollywood Records Sony BMG Universal Music and Warner Music well

1177
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:32,000
actually for Warner Music specifically it was Rhino Entertainment you know you

1178
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:36,160
know what I remember about Rhino Entertainment is that when I was young I

1179
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:39,680
had a bunch of albums that had the old Rhino logo on it and that's how I always

1180
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:47,480
remember Rhino Entertainment but they had you know the Wii version had five

1181
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:52,280
additional songs by the way over some of the others they had Danny California

1182
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:56,600
don't fear the Reaper understand man here it goes again

1183
01:28:56,600 --> 01:29:00,880
highway star and learn to fly oh and suffragette city and when I dead or

1184
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:04,280
alive and won't get fooled again so those are bonus you could also get

1185
01:29:04,280 --> 01:29:11,240
downloaded you know track packs and single songs so like to date one thousand

1186
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:16,320
four hundred and eighty downloadable songs are available that's a lot of

1187
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:23,240
music but at any rate like I said it was developed by a harmonics post guitar

1188
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:30,880
hero and red octane and made the the it looks like red octane was making the

1189
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:37,280
peripherals but yeah we never soft took over development of guitar hero well

1190
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:41,040
harmonics had to go somewhere I had to do something and so they started in

1191
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:44,560
February 2006 working with different designers for prototyping the

1192
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:49,560
instruments for developing an all-new hardware bringing in things like your

1193
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:55,840
drum support and they just kept working on it from there and it ended up being

1194
01:29:55,840 --> 01:30:04,320
you know such a big hit like I said we've got so many so many other

1195
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:11,160
peripherals and it's so many other releases that it just just really moved

1196
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:16,800
right along they did have licensing fees for using some of the wireless

1197
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:24,000
technology especially for Microsoft and if they had chosen to pay for it they

1198
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,880
would have actually released the different versions at different costs

1199
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:34,880
so they used wired technology to start off with it so so anyway yeah it's got

1200
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:42,360
a massive online community at rock band calm and now I mean remember we used to

1201
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:48,160
help out with them loud the charity event where you basically play rock band

1202
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:55,640
on stage I used to do some of the graphics but it was I mean there's all

1203
01:30:55,640 --> 01:31:02,560
these like weird special editions too like there's Green Day and I think there

1204
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:08,960
was Beatles rock band that was a big deal but you know as it came out you

1205
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:15,720
know they also were learning that of course some of the guitars from other

1206
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:19,920
games were incompatible for example the Gibson Les Paul guitar controller that

1207
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:25,720
came with guitar hero 3 was not compatible with rock band even though

1208
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:31,880
harmonics said that they had an open controller support but basically

1209
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:35,720
harmonics and Activision we're just pointing fingers back and forth harmonics

1210
01:31:35,720 --> 01:31:45,280
put out a patch Activision blocked it so who's the bad guy here and then but

1211
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:48,920
Activision then announced that guitar hero world tour would use the rock bands

1212
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:58,600
instruments and just drama at any rate though rock band was very highly

1213
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:05,880
received for most of the American reviewers you didn't get a score under a

1214
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:12,360
nine on that scale or a five stars or an a so they were all very excellent won so

1215
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:18,080
many awards best multiplayer experience innovation awards across the board best

1216
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:25,960
music game and Xbox magazine said best reason to move to a bigger house award

1217
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:31,640
this I mean this game really was like it was just so like like transformative I

1218
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:35,560
mean between you really have to kind of co-credit this and like a tar hero and

1219
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:38,920
just you know with the whole like plastic instrument revolution and sure

1220
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:42,080
those of us that have been music game fans a little bit longer such as you

1221
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:46,040
know us here at OLR and some of our longtime listeners obviously we remember

1222
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:49,640
what was about guitar freaks and importing the stuff from Japan the beat

1223
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:53,360
media 2dx controllers and things like that but Konami and you know we talked

1224
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:57,680
about this ad nauseum in our first 180 episodes Konami was never willing to

1225
01:32:57,680 --> 01:33:01,240
really take that risk with the US audiences until it was too late the

1226
01:33:01,240 --> 01:33:04,000
Japanese arm of the company was too fucking stubborn even though the

1227
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:07,920
American side was telling him do it do it do it they were too fucking stubborn

1228
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:11,400
until I think it was really too late to hit the momentum on that and then by the

1229
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:15,920
time they finally did get it on it it looked like a fucking knockoff of this

1230
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:19,840
because it was rock revolution when Konami finally got it was just a bad

1231
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:26,240
fucking version of this so you know it was it was really guitar hero 2 probably

1232
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:29,560
in many ways I would say and then like this as a definitely follow-up with

1233
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:33,400
charter 3 that really kind of like pushed that plastic instrument

1234
01:33:33,400 --> 01:33:40,080
revolution and just started music gaming in the u.s. well there also did have

1235
01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:46,720
effects on the actual music industry their Viacom was saying that it was

1236
01:33:46,720 --> 01:33:52,480
averaging the sale of 1 million downloadable songs every nine days and

1237
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:58,520
for example Motley Crue's single Saints of Los Angeles debuted as a rock band

1238
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:06,280
track the same time that the album released some of the tracks that were

1239
01:34:06,280 --> 01:34:11,720
specific to rock band actually ended up being later on we released for example

1240
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:16,880
Rush's alternate working man only which one of my favorite songs ever we

1241
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:21,360
actually like ran out of video and that was some guy playing a 10-minute song

1242
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:27,080
but in any way the alternate version of working man that was released only for

1243
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:33,400
rock band was so well loved that Rush released that version as a download

1244
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:39,000
through iTunes and started making some of their albums available like moving

1245
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:45,840
pictures was was released in the game two months after all this so I really

1246
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:49,520
want to go back and play again on my Xbox one because I have rock band for on

1247
01:34:49,520 --> 01:34:52,960
Xbox one but like I remember I was having a lot of problems getting the

1248
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:56,560
instruments connecting like weird shit was happening and I got so frustrated I

1249
01:34:56,560 --> 01:35:00,840
just stopped but for me the real peak of the rock band series for me was rock

1250
01:35:00,840 --> 01:35:04,480
band three because I love the keyboards I'm like the one person that loved the

1251
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:08,880
keyboards that was so awesome and I wish I wish the keyboard thing had taken off

1252
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:13,520
more mmm I was just reading about some of the litigation with Gibson guitar and

1253
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:23,520
Konami's lawsuit and everything oh sure yeah but I mean basically a Viacom did

1254
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:27,760
a counter suit against Konami saying that rock band improves on Konami's

1255
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:32,640
original patent and that rock revolution used controllers are similar

1256
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:38,120
to rock band so they both settled and there you go there you go I also want to

1257
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:42,320
give a shout out for rock band blitz I wish they had made that one backwards

1258
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:48,400
compatible 360 there's also mention of frets on fire oh yeah when the like a

1259
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:57,720
computer yeah and then of course we had you know coming out of

1260
01:35:57,720 --> 01:36:01,720
that there was rock Smith to where you actually could play a real guitar that

1261
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:06,800
was much different it was but I don't know how much laid off the concept yeah

1262
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:10,120
I don't know how much I can say but I know somebody who worked on that game so

1263
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:15,600
and so do you know yeah I'm saying that I don't know that it would be out oh

1264
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:20,000
yes you're not for oh yeah definitely definitely like again it's all about

1265
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:25,720
that risk right nobody would have taken a risk on a game like rock Smith if rock

1266
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:30,480
band and guitar hero too hadn't like put it out there there was that and I'm

1267
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:33,600
sure somebody asked that question well you know everybody's fake jam it why

1268
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:36,840
don't we teach people how to play a real guitar why we do this for real maybe

1269
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:40,520
there's a way and that's what rock Smith dead well and on top of that though in

1270
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:44,360
the later releases of rock band you had the pro modes where they had the

1271
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:47,520
guitars and the keyboard I love the cute because you really were playing the

1272
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:50,840
keyboard parts if you played it in pro yeah it's pretty cool yeah it was

1273
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:55,280
awesome but Bobby talking about rock band blitz they only had the music

1274
01:36:55,280 --> 01:36:58,160
licenses for a couple years for the songs they ended up delisting rock band

1275
01:36:58,160 --> 01:37:03,160
blitz it's I look Robin blitz was just it was all the DLC you already had for

1276
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:08,240
rock band but then you played it in like an amplitude kind of game and I loved it

1277
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:13,360
so cool so all right there it is your classic game of the week rock band one

1278
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:16,800
of the greatest all-time classics really especially for us music game fans love

1279
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:20,020
it that's the type of game that brought us all together and so I'm assuming were

1280
01:37:20,020 --> 01:37:22,600
they playing this a California extreme did it get you kind of thing oh yeah you

1281
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:26,600
said they're playing on stage right yeah but I didn't play but you I saw it along

1282
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:33,640
with it though yeah because they you know started singing the cure I also did

1283
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:39,040
karaoke this last week cuz that's my fun stage I'm just singing it at the vendor

1284
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:44,080
booth no but I did real karaoke I met up with some of my friends in Chicago we

1285
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:48,760
went out to one of the bars for karaoke it was fun I was basically show me show

1286
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:53,520
me show me how you do that song that's one of my favorites but I was singing it

1287
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:57,960
over there and some kid was looking over just grinning it was pretty funny mm-hmm

1288
01:37:57,960 --> 01:38:05,320
you were singing classic rock all right let's move on let's get into some rapid

1289
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:08,400
fire news and quickly travel around the world with some other headlines and

1290
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:12,840
what's going on in gaming so Loki won't start us off all right so we've got a

1291
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:18,240
couple things here so one it's a little bit of a preview of what we can expect

1292
01:38:18,280 --> 01:38:23,520
from gamescom which is just around the corner supposed to take place on August

1293
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:28,080
20th through the 24th and thq Nordic is apparently gonna have some new games to

1294
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:33,320
announce as well as showing off some additional things including their remake

1295
01:38:33,320 --> 01:38:38,400
for destroy all humans they also have a remake for spongebob squarepants battle

1296
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:43,600
for bikini bottom a rehydrated and apparently the strategy game of

1297
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:51,080
desperados 3 and Darksiders Genesis but they're supposed to be announcing also

1298
01:38:51,080 --> 01:38:54,560
new games as well during that time so I guess we'll have to wait and see what

1299
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:58,760
that is thq Nordic I'm hoping that one of those is a no-saints program but you

1300
01:38:58,760 --> 01:39:04,000
know I'm I'm highly skeptical that gonna be something in the same universe ages

1301
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:09,400
of mayhem 2 yes that game really was not terrible enough and we have to make a

1302
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:14,400
sequel to make it even worse and then finally this is kind of cool grand theft

1303
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:21,800
auto 3 Liberty City may remember that game that's pretty old but now you can

1304
01:39:21,800 --> 01:39:27,480
actually play in the Liberty City map from grand theft auto 3 in beam and G so

1305
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:33,040
for those not aware of what beam and G is it is a physics based driving game

1306
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:37,760
which basically you kind of do whatever you want in it but mostly it's to crash

1307
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:41,960
your car in very unique ways but now you can crash your car in very unique

1308
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:46,840
ways all over the map of grand theft auto 3 and it looks awesome and of

1309
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:52,000
course it's not something that you can necessarily download and via the

1310
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:59,080
official like mod repositories but there's a thread in their forum on beam

1311
01:39:59,080 --> 01:40:03,480
and g.com so go check it out there and it looks awesome I don't know if I don't

1312
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:07,400
think I have beam ng but I've seen lots of videos of people playing it I do want

1313
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:13,840
to probably pick it up now all right moving on to a hackers gonna hack story

1314
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:18,520
because we love these around here at olr this has to do with somebody getting

1315
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:22,480
Android running on the switch that's right XDA are the homebrew developers

1316
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:27,760
that have just released an Android firmware for the Nintendo switch it's a

1317
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:34,400
8-point Android 8.1 lineage OS 15.1 I don't I don't do enough Android no idea

1318
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:38,360
what that is um but I'm assuming just one of the operating systems one of the

1319
01:40:38,360 --> 01:40:41,600
older ones probably not one of the newest ones and so compatible models

1320
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:45,360
will do it there are of course it's buggy it's got battery life issues some

1321
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:49,120
of the rotation some sensitive touchscreen input but everything in

1322
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:53,720
there otherwise would work so basically it will turn your switch into an Android

1323
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:56,880
tablet with a pair of controllers this is something you're basically flashing

1324
01:40:56,880 --> 01:41:01,240
the firmware on your switch to be this so you're losing your Nintendo switch so

1325
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:06,200
you know only if you really really really are into fucking with your

1326
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:10,600
hardware do you want to do something like this apparently it is based on

1327
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:16,440
androids a division that works with the Nvidia shield TV so some things on the

1328
01:41:16,440 --> 01:41:20,720
Tegra like Borderlands and Half-Life 2 will actually run on this not to say

1329
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:26,280
they run well but they run so very interesting with that that's a big big

1330
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:31,200
console mod going on there so yeah again I would not do this for shits and

1331
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:35,120
giggles unless you really know what you're doing with this type of modding

1332
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:39,440
because you're likely gonna lose access to being able to play Mario maker and

1333
01:41:39,440 --> 01:41:45,320
things like that anyway let's talk about a story on Facebook instant games

1334
01:41:45,320 --> 01:41:50,000
because they are going to be kind of going away kind of not really so instant

1335
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:53,240
games on Facebook started in the newsfeed and then they went to groups and

1336
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:57,120
the light app and I believe they went into the messaging app you could play

1337
01:41:57,120 --> 01:42:00,320
games like pac-man and stuff with friends I know I've done that before

1338
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:04,760
but not in a long time I think it was one of those things were like oh I

1339
01:42:04,760 --> 01:42:07,520
played pac-man with somebody on messenger okay I'll never need to do

1340
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:11,040
that again in my entire life like I don't think I really got into the thing

1341
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:15,000
in the Facebook gaming thing was also a little weird to me because like oh you

1342
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:19,220
can play these things on an app in your phone and most of them are just apps you

1343
01:42:19,220 --> 01:42:23,080
can download on your phone and play there you know I mean if I wanted to

1344
01:42:23,080 --> 01:42:28,520
play pac-man I could just download the pac-man app for my phone right but for

1345
01:42:28,520 --> 01:42:31,480
whatever reason you know some people wanted to do the Facebook messenger

1346
01:42:31,480 --> 01:42:35,640
gaming because excuse me probably some more of the social features and things

1347
01:42:35,640 --> 01:42:40,620
like that well games are gonna be moving out of the messenger app they will be

1348
01:42:40,620 --> 01:42:45,360
moving into the Facebook gaming tab global director of games partnerships

1349
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:51,000
Leo Aleb said quote starting later this summer instant games will no longer be

1350
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:55,640
playable directly in the new version of messenger on iOS to ensure a smooth

1351
01:42:55,640 --> 01:42:59,640
transition players and messenger will continue to access games through thread

1352
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:04,680
updates and chat bots while gameplay itself will app switch to Facebook quite

1353
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:11,400
honestly this all sounds terrible so I just is there a Facebook game I'm

1354
01:43:11,400 --> 01:43:14,040
missing out on is there something I should be playing I don't know I blocked

1355
01:43:14,040 --> 01:43:17,360
all of those notifications so probably not

1356
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:22,120
it's Farmville still a thing I don't know too I wonder if my ex is still

1357
01:43:22,120 --> 01:43:26,640
jamming to the Farmville soundtrack all these years later I have no idea I don't

1358
01:43:26,640 --> 01:43:32,120
know which one was this all right okay so and a pot of podcast listeners in

1359
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:35,960
chat want me to correct on the Android story apparently you are running it off

1360
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:41,000
a micro SD card you are not actually overriding your switch data I apologize

1361
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:44,360
I must have misinterpreted because they were talking about that you may be kind

1362
01:43:44,360 --> 01:43:47,320
of screwing up your system to be able to play some of the other games later on

1363
01:43:47,320 --> 01:43:54,360
so I apologize if I misrepresented that but I I still would I still would

1364
01:43:54,360 --> 01:43:58,080
venture with this shit with caution if you really want to run an Android thing

1365
01:43:58,080 --> 01:44:01,920
how about you just buy an Android tablet they're not that expensive they're

1366
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:06,640
cheaper than a switch but that's but I also the earlier in the day or earlier

1367
01:44:06,640 --> 01:44:10,480
in the show I said but isn't that reddit where everybody runs doom on all this

1368
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:18,480
different shit hilarious so I get the appeal I do I do anyway back to the

1369
01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:24,320
Facebook story kaijuto says my ex loved that Facebook MMO game forgot the name

1370
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:26,880
of it Oh Farmville she had me in her auction

1371
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:33,480
room watching her watching her seller stuff it was fun metal man has them

1372
01:44:33,480 --> 01:44:37,520
metal mayhem says I don't give two shits about Facebook games to be honest if I

1373
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:41,800
were to play a game it'd be one of my games from steam or good old games good

1374
01:44:41,800 --> 01:44:46,640
plug so I think it's it's safe to say pixel shits will not be coming to

1375
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:50,040
Facebook Messenger or Facebook instant or whatever the fuck they're calling it

1376
01:44:50,040 --> 01:44:55,480
now anytime soon anyway who wants to play games on Facebook anyway you know

1377
01:44:55,480 --> 01:45:00,080
the only game I'm playing for a while mind games do you remember though that

1378
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:08,080
Sims on Facebook yes I vaguely played there what's right there was like a Sim

1379
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:13,360
and it was thing yeah like 2d and not 3d yeah no I totally remember it that thing

1380
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:17,640
was nuts that was yeah okay and then like this pet game but that those weren't

1381
01:45:17,640 --> 01:45:21,480
like things within the app that was kind of the precursor that those games were

1382
01:45:21,480 --> 01:45:26,200
also on Google Plus games when that one and only game I played on Facebook that

1383
01:45:26,200 --> 01:45:32,560
I had to suffer through was a stupid goddamn garage sale game part of that

1384
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:36,760
fucking ready player one challenge that is the only fucking game I ever played

1385
01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:40,320
on there and that was enough to sour me off of the whole fucking platform I

1386
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:43,800
remember that dark to see you says I was kind of addicted to the civilization

1387
01:45:43,800 --> 01:45:46,520
port for a little while I remember that that's right there was like a

1388
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:50,800
civilization game on Facebook I did words with friends a lot yeah yeah sim

1389
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:57,240
social that was it pixel pockets anyway that's enough about that dark soccer

1390
01:45:57,240 --> 01:46:01,560
what do you have for rapid-fire news certainly not pixel shit right now sorry

1391
01:46:01,560 --> 01:46:07,920
why we are the original game that we got as monster rancher in Japan it was

1392
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:16,440
monster farm is getting a re-release in Japan the there is a teaser website up

1393
01:46:16,440 --> 01:46:24,680
for it but koi Tecmo has released the thing on their Twitter and it's looking

1394
01:46:24,680 --> 01:46:28,640
kind of cute you know it's funny is that I almost picked up a monster farm

1395
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:35,560
yesterday because I my I'd never played monster rancher so I was thinking about

1396
01:46:35,560 --> 01:46:42,040
getting it but I didn't but there's in the translation of this hold on let me

1397
01:46:42,040 --> 01:46:49,560
get the translation pulled up it says oh my god why is this being slow

1398
01:46:49,560 --> 01:46:53,920
basically it's saying that it's going to be released on an unannounced platform

1399
01:46:53,920 --> 01:47:01,360
in 2019 and they used the word high sheen which typically indicates a digital

1400
01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:05,760
release so it could either be it's a digital only console PC title or

1401
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:13,480
smartphone so and then in other news that I don't know if this makes me

1402
01:47:13,480 --> 01:47:20,200
excited it could but Sega of Japan has filed a trademark for Knights dream wheel

1403
01:47:20,200 --> 01:47:24,760
thinking that it could be another game in the Knights franchise it would be

1404
01:47:24,760 --> 01:47:30,320
really nice if it did but it didn't spell Knights with a special spelling of

1405
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:36,280
Knights so it could be something else but if it's a if it's a a new Knights

1406
01:47:36,280 --> 01:47:39,840
game I would be quite happy I'm surprised that isn't something they've

1407
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:46,480
revisited recently why not we're getting a lot of the other stuff like we night

1408
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:50,280
there was a wee night's game I remember that a wee little night's game but yes

1409
01:47:50,280 --> 01:47:53,200
there's that and then of course Panzer Dragoon I think is the other kind of big

1410
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:58,360
one that I remember at e3 this year is pretty big deal so it'd be cool yeah

1411
01:47:58,360 --> 01:48:01,480
all right well let's move on and travel around the world and check out some

1412
01:48:01,480 --> 01:48:05,400
release dates and some video games coming out soon near you not a whole lot

1413
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:09,800

01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:35,880
now get in the car let's go on the PlayStation 4 this week on August 1st we

1418
01:48:35,880 --> 01:48:40,720
have a game called labyrinth life sadly I don't believe this game stars stars

1419
01:48:40,720 --> 01:48:45,840
David Bowie I think it's probably an anime based game they talk about a faint

1420
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:51,320
in agony flowering system interesting but it already know right yeah and I

1421
01:48:51,320 --> 01:48:54,880
guess it also does some rock-paper-scissors type of battle and oh

1422
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:59,160
it looks like you can change the bus sizes on your characters well that oh

1423
01:48:59,160 --> 01:49:03,920
yeah I think yeah I've heard this was a game I think that was it's only wasn't

1424
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:09,360
bringing over to the West because of they had like some of these I don't know

1425
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:12,380
if this is the same game series but they had one where you basically have to

1426
01:49:12,380 --> 01:49:17,440
breed these like princesses or whatever they rescue or something like that

1427
01:49:17,480 --> 01:49:22,440
there's some weird shit now they all right well if labyrinth life is your

1428
01:49:22,440 --> 01:49:27,280
thing you enjoy that it's this week um also coming out of Japan this week crash

1429
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:31,000
team racing nitro fueled gets its Japanese release I know we've had it

1430
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:34,640
here for a little bit but is finally on its way out in Japan this week and if we

1431
01:49:34,640 --> 01:49:39,040
want to go over to the Nintendo switch Oh mega labyrinth life comes out on the

1432
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:45,440
switch all right where you can make some Omega anyway also we've got a game

1433
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:50,680
called the same crash team racing is also out in Japan and the air conflicts

1434
01:49:50,680 --> 01:49:55,360
collection gets a release on the switch this week and I feel like we just had

1435
01:49:55,360 --> 01:50:00,400
no this is okay no this is not like an arcade shooter this is a game with air

1436
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:06,880
conflict secret wars and air conflicts Pacific carriers in one pack so if you

1437
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:12,480
are you know cuz the airplane simulator games are pretty popular overseas so if

1438
01:50:12,520 --> 01:50:18,200
you want that you can have that dark Sakura how about the UK in the UK we

1439
01:50:18,200 --> 01:50:24,800
don't really have very many either what is coming out on the 29th which is I

1440
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:31,080
guess already the 29th right now there is FIA European truck racing

1441
01:50:31,080 --> 01:50:36,640
championship and there's mutant year zero Road to Eden the deluxe edition and

1442
01:50:36,640 --> 01:50:43,560
then on August 1st is Madden NFL 20 so they go back to labyrinth life a little

1443
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:49,560
bit I just I'm just I'm just gonna read this one I mean basically you kind of

1444
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:53,000
get the gist of the game anyways but they said it apparently if you expand

1445
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:58,880
your bus with every fallen foe mighty memories lead to great greater power

1446
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:03,120
defeating foes builds up your Omega power in the chest increasing bus size

1447
01:51:03,120 --> 01:51:07,200
and parameters they go all the way to a Z cup this is a Nintendo switch game by

1448
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:18,760
the way and apparently is coming out in the u.s. on August 1st so that is that

1449
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:23,800
is another that is another game that is coming out is it really yes it is are

1450
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:28,720
you gonna do a let's play a live stream no it's 60 bucks not paying for that but

1451
01:51:28,720 --> 01:51:39,880
Z cups Loki oh wow you know what what I think that that's so terrible that's not

1452
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:44,080
even funny anymore when I know people who have had breast reductions for that

1453
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:49,640
kind of pain that it would cause I don't think that a part of the body should be

1454
01:51:49,640 --> 01:51:56,320
fetished I really don't I'm just getting so sick of it we're not objects all right

1455
01:51:56,320 --> 01:52:01,240
I mean and I'm not saying it's right but are you really surprised I should be

1456
01:52:01,240 --> 01:52:04,800
surprised is the thing I really should be surprised I don't even know what I'm

1457
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:09,720
looking at here we and I really don't want to know whether fictional or not

1458
01:52:09,720 --> 01:52:14,200
bodies need to be respected it's just fucking stupid I don't know what that is

1459
01:52:14,200 --> 01:52:20,800
not here to glorify your fucking hormones Bobby Black Wolf in chat says

1460
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:24,600
Nintendo is kitty because you know Nintendo is a kids company they only put

1461
01:52:24,600 --> 01:52:31,240
out kids games we all know that's the case of course let's see yeah some folks

1462
01:52:31,240 --> 01:52:37,240
in chat saying excuse me Z cup yeah anyway podculture says there is such a

1463
01:52:37,240 --> 01:52:42,640
thing as too much of a good thing anyway let's move on can we please go to the

1468
01:53:03,240 --> 01:53:09,440

like was it was it professor plum in the conservatory with the Crisco

1474
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:47,920
I'm not gonna play this game anymore so that means since we got no real emails

1475
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:52,440
it's drag race talk what is there to talk about drag race drag race isn't on

1476
01:53:52,440 --> 01:53:58,080
right now but I saw a funny meme okay this is every time a Republican is

1477
01:53:58,080 --> 01:54:02,640
caught with another man a drag queen gets her heels oh because there's yet

1478
01:54:02,640 --> 01:54:06,280
another one that got like was caught on Grindr or something yeah just today I

1479
01:54:06,280 --> 01:54:13,240

1480
01:54:13,280 --> 01:54:20,600
hate yourself mm-hmm just just get fucked in the ass you'll feel better no

1481
01:54:20,600 --> 01:54:27,720

1482
01:54:27,720 --> 01:54:34,040
get another email about you beating off that Pikachu so please stop just hear me

1483
01:54:34,040 --> 01:54:47,640
out hear me out this is why we don't have a lot of yours no no just just hear

1484
01:54:47,640 --> 01:54:56,080
me out I don't think a man has to identify as gay to sometimes have gay

1485
01:54:56,080 --> 01:55:01,200
moments you know you can be bisexual there's no problem with it being bi is

1486
01:55:01,240 --> 01:55:06,760
valid but if you're this repressed you're this repressed because you've

1487
01:55:06,760 --> 01:55:11,520
been denying yourself or you're doing it and you hate yourself just get fucked in

1488
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:16,600
the ass and be open about it stand up there and go you know what I like it I'm

1489
01:55:16,600 --> 01:55:19,320
not gonna say it cuz someone's gonna clip me saying it and I don't like any

1490
01:55:19,320 --> 01:55:30,280
of it but just say getting fucked in the ass is okay use your enema wear a condom

1491
01:55:30,320 --> 01:55:38,120
and get fucked in the ass do it safely people who matter will not think any

1492
01:55:38,120 --> 01:55:42,280
less of you for it welcome everybody to the voice of geeks Network where every

1493
01:55:42,280 --> 01:55:48,840
geek has a voice dark soccer has chosen to use hers for a significant purpose

1494
01:55:48,840 --> 01:55:56,000
tonight well honestly enough it's why I became a sister take the stigma out of

1495
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:59,320
it the moment that no one gives a shit that you're getting fucked in the ass is

1496
01:55:59,320 --> 01:56:05,720
the moment that you don't have to hide I mean fucking a people I'm I'm in super

1497
01:56:05,720 --> 01:56:14,080
literally is what it is I'm just saying if people stopped having such a big

1498
01:56:14,080 --> 01:56:21,760
conniption fit over it and just I'm gonna stop explaining it shouldn't have

1499
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:25,640
to be explained you if you like if you like it in the but you should be able to

1500
01:56:25,640 --> 01:56:39,440
have it just saying what what back that ass up just saying Rob do you need

1501
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:51,600
another drink shall we all right so speaking of getting fucked in the ass

1502
01:56:51,600 --> 01:56:58,000
Nintendo has been really hard on people not being able to upload lots of

1503
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:02,600
different levels for Mario maker 2 and so because of that now they're gonna be

1504
01:57:02,600 --> 01:57:07,560
increasing the cap from 32 to 64 and they said that also they're gonna be

1505
01:57:07,560 --> 01:57:11,880
increasing that upload limit one more time so we don't know when that's gonna

1506
01:57:11,880 --> 01:57:15,360
happen but sometime in the future you may be able to upload more than 64

1507
01:57:15,360 --> 01:57:19,440
levels which I don't understand why they're limiting everybody to do that

1508
01:57:19,440 --> 01:57:25,960
but just in case if you think that you know your levels being deleted because

1509
01:57:25,960 --> 01:57:30,760
you may be doing some exploits in the game are safe offline you are sorely

1510
01:57:30,760 --> 01:57:35,680
mistaken so apparently of course like the first Mario maker people have been

1511
01:57:35,680 --> 01:57:39,360
exploiting different glitches in the game to do all sorts of crazy stuff one

1512
01:57:39,360 --> 01:57:43,880
of these is actually how to create a black hole in Mario maker 2 which allows

1513
01:57:43,880 --> 01:57:48,080
you to put objects on top of each other that aren't supposed to be layered that

1514
01:57:48,080 --> 01:57:53,320
way so you can kind of create these really crazy fire bars and different

1515
01:57:53,320 --> 01:58:02,600
overlapping terrain including pipes and whatnot have the moon appearing in

1516
01:58:02,600 --> 01:58:06,920
daytime levels and all sorts of crazy stuff the game will know that you're

1517
01:58:06,920 --> 01:58:09,680
doing that of course and it will actually say that corrupt data has been

1518
01:58:09,680 --> 01:58:13,320
found in your course has been deleted or just won't let you save the game because

1519
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:18,560
there's corrupt data as well and so unfortunately you know those crazy

1520
01:58:18,560 --> 01:58:22,160
levels that people might be able to make with these exploits aren't gonna be a

1521
01:58:22,160 --> 01:58:31,800
thing because they have patched in ways to detect those which is unfortunate but

1522
01:58:31,800 --> 01:58:37,560
hey you know the level caps gonna be up to 120 probably someday or more I don't

1523
01:58:37,560 --> 01:58:40,440
know why there's even a cap on the number of levels you can put out there

1524
01:58:40,440 --> 01:58:44,320
anyways who cares like you can't tell me people that would just upload

1525
01:58:44,320 --> 01:58:50,160
garbage but how are you gonna discover that garbage I guess it gets thrown into

1526
01:58:50,160 --> 01:58:54,240
your feet or whatever but like the level size the download of that I mean the

1527
01:58:54,240 --> 01:58:58,080
storage space has got to be so minimal I can't imagine why we would even limit

1528
01:58:58,080 --> 01:59:01,440
that stuff little big planet doesn't do that and you can do all sorts of crazy

1529
01:59:01,440 --> 01:59:07,880
shit in that why why even limit Mario maker I don't know that's the thing you

1530
01:59:07,880 --> 01:59:10,920
haven't picked up Mario maker too yet have you I have are you making any

1531
01:59:10,920 --> 01:59:15,040
levels um I haven't gotten to play it yet because my kids have been playing it

1532
01:59:15,040 --> 01:59:18,160
I haven't made any levels yet that's the one thing I'm missing so I should have

1533
01:59:18,160 --> 01:59:20,880
I should have tried like making a level one on the airplane but I just I

1534
01:59:20,880 --> 01:59:26,800
probably will at some point mm-hmm all right anyway Bobby with the clerk's

1535
01:59:26,800 --> 01:59:35,120
jokes in there we have 37 viewers in a row anyway

1536
01:59:35,120 --> 01:59:40,040
moving on maybe something you want to make in Mario maker is your own pole

1537
01:59:40,040 --> 01:59:43,360
position inspired level I don't know I had no other transition and I figure it

1538
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:47,880
was better than the last one pole position somebody has remade this in 3d

1539
01:59:47,880 --> 01:59:55,880
yeah I saw that yeah and they Rob what's wrong because I was about to read the

1540
01:59:55,880 --> 02:00:06,120
name of it and you know it's called hmm PP engine yes pole position engine so

1541
02:00:06,120 --> 02:00:11,880
it's a it's a PP engine is a three-year Rob definitely needs an adult this

1542
02:00:11,880 --> 02:00:16,840
episode yeah you know Bobby said try not to

1543
02:00:16,840 --> 02:00:22,240
masturbate on your way to the car on my way to playing some PP engine which is

1544
02:00:22,240 --> 02:00:29,040
a 3d remake of the night it's a 3d remake of the 1982 game pole position

1545
02:00:29,040 --> 02:00:33,440
Rob can't even which is what your PP stands for but it actually reverse

1546
02:00:33,440 --> 02:00:39,720
engineers all of the games code so it's actually following basically what you

1547
02:00:39,720 --> 02:00:44,320
would expect the cars and the AI to do but it's modern high-definition graphics

1548
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:49,520
as in crashing every time you get on a curve yeah yes and all the all the like

1549
02:00:49,680 --> 02:00:54,040
lame-looking billboards that go by and the little explosions and all of that

1550
02:00:54,040 --> 02:00:59,480
yeah Jonathan Thomas on reddit said I started back in 2013 my god that's six

1551
02:00:59,480 --> 02:01:03,320
years ago reverse some people do podcasts for 17 years some people spent

1552
02:01:03,320 --> 02:01:07,760
six years on their PP engine I started back in 2013 reverse engineering the

1553
02:01:07,760 --> 02:01:11,400
code from the original arcade ROM with the help of the main debugger and some

1554
02:01:11,400 --> 02:01:15,480
primitive self-made tools to analyze instruction traces and create assembly

1555
02:01:15,480 --> 02:01:18,680
source files that could be assembled back into the original arcade ROM

1556
02:01:18,680 --> 02:01:21,720
following this I worked through the assembly source file to produce a

1557
02:01:21,720 --> 02:01:25,600
portable c-based library containing the game logic for pole position this

1558
02:01:25,600 --> 02:01:29,560
library was used in two projects the one you see here and another project to

1559
02:01:29,560 --> 02:01:34,400
convert pole pole position to the Atari st a 16-bit computer that was released

1560
02:01:34,400 --> 02:01:40,800
in 1985 I mean this is like on one hand I'm like what a colossal waste of time

1561
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:44,440
but on the other hand I'm like this is actually like really cool it's like the

1562
02:01:44,440 --> 02:01:50,000
most authentic way to remake like an old game but just like put new graphics

1563
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:54,040
on it like they they didn't just like remake it with new programming languages

1564
02:01:54,040 --> 02:01:58,000
that emulated like I thought that they went in and like did it from the code so

1565
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:01,840
that's that's pretty cool now you actually don't you have a pole position

1566
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:05,320
cabinet or you did like that became your main cabinet or am I mixing it up with

1567
02:02:05,320 --> 02:02:08,960
something yeah we had a pole position and sure me moved into it remember mm-hmm

1568
02:02:08,960 --> 02:02:12,560
because it was missing the pedal so sure me decided it was her new cat mansion

1569
02:02:12,560 --> 02:02:17,160
mm-hmm but yeah we put a meme in that at one time and then I don't remember we

1570
02:02:17,160 --> 02:02:22,240
sold it and then did other things now Bobby Blackwell would like to point out

1571
02:02:22,240 --> 02:02:28,000
in our chat room at least he completed his racing game unlike some people well

1572
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:37,800
took him six years to do it I got time all right anyway let's move on we have a

1573
02:02:37,800 --> 02:02:41,120
few more stories for you guys and then we're gonna get to our discord segment

1574
02:02:41,120 --> 02:02:43,960
which I think I accidentally left off the show role but we will get to

1575
02:02:43,960 --> 02:02:48,800
discord if you want to give us a call over at vog network or vognetwork.com

1576
02:02:48,800 --> 02:02:52,360
slash discord but first dark soccer I think you have another kind of like

1577
02:02:52,360 --> 02:02:56,800
video game study thing I do because I like to bring something about science

1578
02:02:56,800 --> 02:03:01,920
into this but there is a game called driving XC which you can find at

1579
02:03:01,920 --> 02:03:08,920
driving XC calm for $39 it's available also as a digital download for I guess

1580
02:03:08,960 --> 02:03:16,120
they mean Xbox one and ps4 but it's a game that helps new drivers learn how to

1581
02:03:16,120 --> 02:03:23,400
drive and on top of that in one of the interviews on here the father of the teen

1582
02:03:23,400 --> 02:03:29,040
says it's actually helped him become a better driver that after having pay

1583
02:03:29,040 --> 02:03:33,640
attention you know to watching his daughter play it that he started

1584
02:03:33,640 --> 02:03:38,640
becoming a more careful driver so basically it's drivers ed the game and

1585
02:03:38,640 --> 02:03:43,960
the guy behind it is named Bob Davis he was making the large-scale car

1586
02:03:43,960 --> 02:03:48,200
simulators like you did you ever have the simulators in your high school for

1587
02:03:48,200 --> 02:03:56,520
drivers ed no we had that use like a film strip to drive with and the

1588
02:03:56,520 --> 02:03:59,920
simulators were terrible this is like also like from the 60s it was pretty bad

1589
02:04:00,120 --> 02:04:05,680
but this guy's been making the simulator since 2005 and so his driving

1590
02:04:05,680 --> 02:04:13,120
essentials is to help be an interactive driving simulator for teens that they

1591
02:04:13,120 --> 02:04:18,040
could do on their own and so it's actually apparently been helping kids

1592
02:04:18,040 --> 02:04:21,560
learn to drive better as ten different lessons starting with the basics and

1593
02:04:21,560 --> 02:04:27,360
take you through different driving scenarios so that it gives you you know

1594
02:04:27,360 --> 02:04:31,840
it makes you more aware when you're ready for your driving test and there's

1595
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:36,760
even a level where you have a phone and it forces you to look at it so you can

1596
02:04:36,760 --> 02:04:40,680
see what distracted right distracted driving can do is even if you're at a

1597
02:04:40,680 --> 02:04:46,840
stoplight looking at your phone can still cause an accident so just saying

1598
02:04:46,840 --> 02:04:52,000
it's really really good way to get people prepared and like I said her dad

1599
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:56,120
said that it was really making him a more conscious driver too and you can

1600
02:04:56,120 --> 02:05:03,880
get this at driving X e.com interesting you think they're using video games and

1601
02:05:03,880 --> 02:05:06,760
more and more in the driver's ed type stuff I don't remember why we didn't do

1602
02:05:06,760 --> 02:05:10,360
that type of stuff I feel like I feel like we were all prepping to take a test

1603
02:05:10,360 --> 02:05:14,080
and it's like you took that test so that you could take like basically you take a

1604
02:05:14,080 --> 02:05:19,120
driver's ed course through a private thing at 15 and a half I think or some

1605
02:05:19,120 --> 02:05:22,320
like that was when you could do that the only thing is that it uses a standard

1606
02:05:22,320 --> 02:05:26,640
controller wheels and pedals are not supported but I think they should put in

1607
02:05:26,640 --> 02:05:31,480
driving wheel support you know because that's gonna just even add to the

1608
02:05:31,480 --> 02:05:36,160
experience I'm interesting perspective from dark Tetsuya in our chat room over

1609
02:05:36,160 --> 02:05:40,360
twitch TV slash vog network saying the doctors were convinced I shouldn't drive

1610
02:05:40,360 --> 02:05:44,560
so I've just been using video games to live vicariously very interesting

1611
02:05:44,560 --> 02:05:49,000
perspective there because you know some of us may not realize that oh yeah some

1612
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:52,600
people aren't able to drive whether it's due to a medical issue a vision

1613
02:05:52,600 --> 02:05:56,720
issue you know whatever it is but when it comes to video games where you know

1614
02:05:56,720 --> 02:05:59,680
it's a it's a it's a controlled environment a fake environment not not

1615
02:05:59,680 --> 02:06:04,160
the real world you kind of get to you know experience that in a different way

1616
02:06:04,160 --> 02:06:07,800
and as much as we've been having a laugh at pole position and the acronyms later

1617
02:06:07,800 --> 02:06:12,600
or acronyms that come from it you know maybe that was the realistic simulator

1618
02:06:12,600 --> 02:06:17,160
in 1982 but certainly now today the technologies come so far that when you

1619
02:06:17,160 --> 02:06:21,280
play a game like a Gran Turismo or something it's it's so realistic you

1620
02:06:21,280 --> 02:06:26,780
know well I'll tell you I actually learned because I hadn't driven in a

1621
02:06:26,780 --> 02:06:32,560
while but I learned about over steering from playing Ridge Racer so just saying

1622
02:06:32,560 --> 02:06:40,200
you know I learned how to steer myself out of a drift in other games so you

1623
02:06:40,200 --> 02:06:45,200
know just applying some of the technique I mean yeah and I'd say you know

1624
02:06:45,200 --> 02:06:52,160
improving your hand-eye coordination too is also helpful so you know it's

1625
02:06:52,160 --> 02:06:55,440
funny Bobby Black Wolf I guess did some research into the pole position thing

1626
02:06:55,440 --> 02:06:59,000
turns out that game was either that little reimagine he hasn't been working

1627
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:02,560
out for six years because that originally came out in January 2014 it's

1628
02:07:02,560 --> 02:07:05,160
just making its way around the gaming blogs again this week for whatever

1629
02:07:05,160 --> 02:07:08,720
reason whether it be to do a reddit post or something like that as these things

1630
02:07:08,720 --> 02:07:12,920
sometimes happen but you know here at OLR it's about what is out there in

1631
02:07:12,920 --> 02:07:15,960
gaming culture and if something gets rediscovered and is new all over again

1632
02:07:15,960 --> 02:07:21,080
it still qualifies so I mean I I had no idea it was a thing so it's still kind

1633
02:07:21,080 --> 02:07:27,920
of new maybe in 2019 they'll update it for VR who knows so anyhow let's move on

1634
02:07:27,920 --> 02:07:32,680
Loki story from you all right so it's another week so we have yet another

1635
02:07:32,680 --> 02:07:39,840
story of a epic epic game store exclusive so mech warrior 5 unfortunately

1636
02:07:39,840 --> 02:07:46,440
is being delayed it's now set for December of this year and it will be

1637
02:07:46,440 --> 02:07:52,800
epic game store exclusive as well so piranha games put out a press release

1638
02:07:52,800 --> 02:07:56,840
saying our partnership with epic game store allows piranha the opportunity to

1639
02:07:56,840 --> 02:08:00,680
make sure mech warrior 5 mercenaries meets our internal goal of creating the

1640
02:08:00,680 --> 02:08:05,360
best mech warrior game possible we want more money since we since we announced

1641
02:08:05,560 --> 02:08:11,240
the development of the first player mech war game in 17 years we have stated that

1642
02:08:11,240 --> 02:08:15,760
our goal was to deliver to fans mech warrior mercenaries experience with true

1643
02:08:15,760 --> 02:08:20,240
freedom of choice and being able to share that experience in a co-op setting

1644
02:08:20,240 --> 02:08:27,800
by true freedom of choice we do not mean storefronts of course so yeah it was

1645
02:08:27,800 --> 02:08:33,000
originally supposed to be coming out sooner and apparently though with that

1646
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:37,240
if you had pre-ordered the game you will be able to request a full refund up

1647
02:08:37,240 --> 02:08:43,160
until September 1st hmm well so at least they're gonna do the refund thing that

1648
02:08:43,160 --> 02:08:45,880
as I'm sure some other recent controversies like Shenmue and all that

1649
02:08:45,880 --> 02:08:50,680
stuff the one that gets me though is the whole Tetris effect being exclusive on

1650
02:08:50,680 --> 02:08:53,720
the epic store but then if you want to play it in VR you have to have steam

1651
02:08:53,720 --> 02:08:57,000
because I don't think that is a requirement anymore for like the audience

1652
02:08:57,000 --> 02:09:01,520
Oculus version or something like that oh I thought it only went with the vibe and

1653
02:09:01,520 --> 02:09:04,960
so you had to have steam VR in order to be able to run yeah but yeah that is

1654
02:09:04,960 --> 02:09:08,880
funny this is kind of like one of those like this is it's really weird type of

1655
02:09:08,880 --> 02:09:13,480
thing yeah maybe it just also goes to show that you also maybe don't just

1656
02:09:13,480 --> 02:09:18,960
think of steam as a store I guess steam is I guess more than that at this point

1657
02:09:18,960 --> 02:09:23,360
now with the whole you know fact that there's maybe our drivers in it maybe it

1658
02:09:23,360 --> 02:09:27,320
shouldn't you know I don't know and Bobby says the oculus version runs steam

1659
02:09:27,320 --> 02:09:31,360
VR they didn't make it specifically for oculus last I checked steam VR runs on

1660
02:09:31,360 --> 02:09:35,320
oculus so they just did a one-size-fits-all hmm so yeah it's kind of

1661
02:09:35,320 --> 02:09:38,640
kind of interesting I mean I don't know like I kind of want to get Tetris effect

1662
02:09:38,640 --> 02:09:42,800
on PC but I I already have it on PlayStation I want to be able to play it

1663
02:09:42,800 --> 02:09:47,160
on like 4k though I think that seems like really cool but like I just feel

1664
02:09:47,160 --> 02:09:50,880
like nothing's gonna top the VR version I might wait for a sale I think that's

1665
02:09:50,880 --> 02:09:53,840
what I'll probably and ultimately end up doing but I do love Tetris effect that

1666
02:09:53,840 --> 02:09:57,560
game is so good if you guys haven't played it yet so good so but I just

1667
02:09:57,560 --> 02:10:02,480
don't see myself jumping into PC VR anytime soon I don't like I'm not the

1668
02:10:02,480 --> 02:10:06,240
level of enthusiasts that you know Bobby or even maybe Kai's you know or some

1669
02:10:06,240 --> 02:10:11,240
other of you guys that love your VR are at I'm kind of like I got PS VR it plays

1670
02:10:11,240 --> 02:10:14,440
enough it suits my needs I'm good for now I'm looking forward to the no man

1671
02:10:14,440 --> 02:10:18,680
sky thing which um you know cuz that's gonna get VR pretty soon I'm excited I

1672
02:10:18,680 --> 02:10:22,520
thought it already happened it's like any day now the beyond updates gonna be

1673
02:10:22,520 --> 02:10:26,300
out which I'm speaking what good timing hey Alan can I bug you to come on the

1674
02:10:26,300 --> 02:10:31,940
show please Alan is in this new pocket hi can you come on the show will you

1675
02:10:31,940 --> 02:10:37,260
come on the show yeah cuz I literally just brought something up that is kind

1676
02:10:37,260 --> 02:10:41,940
of like relevant to you and what you're doing um you've been playing a game a

1677
02:10:41,940 --> 02:10:45,220
lot recently we tell us the viewers a little bit about what you've been up to

1678
02:10:45,220 --> 02:10:52,220
I've been playing a lot of No Man's Sky I just wanted to see what the mod

1679
02:10:52,260 --> 02:10:57,780
community had done with it in addition to the updates that well apparently

1680
02:10:57,780 --> 02:11:01,780
unless this guy's completely full of shit was one mod that I'm using called

1681
02:11:01,780 --> 02:11:06,460
fantasy a lot of his work has actually been incorporated like he has a credit

1682
02:11:06,460 --> 02:11:11,380
in some of the patches because hello games has used his stuff he made a mod

1683
02:11:11,380 --> 02:11:16,420
to where you find a ruin and then if you use the thing that lets you dig into the

1684
02:11:16,420 --> 02:11:20,420
earth there's actually like like kind of like archaeology where you go under the

1685
02:11:20,420 --> 02:11:23,780
ground it's not just to find minerals but there's things you can find to sell

1686
02:11:23,780 --> 02:11:28,220
that are actually under that's a part of the base game now and he made a mod to

1687
02:11:28,220 --> 02:11:33,460
do that originally so I was out of town last week obviously on a business trip

1688
02:11:33,460 --> 02:11:38,100
so how many hours would you say you plants spent playing No Man's Sky where

1689
02:11:38,100 --> 02:11:44,500
I wouldn't be here to judge you I've started over a few times I would say

1690
02:11:44,500 --> 02:11:49,380
from the time you left I would say around 15 or 16 hours over the course of

1691
02:11:49,380 --> 02:11:53,260
the week so it's two or three hours a night I can't judge ask me how many

1692
02:11:53,260 --> 02:12:03,660
hours I've been on call for my larp so it's fine yeah well I still haven't

1693
02:12:03,660 --> 02:12:15,220
tried rez VR and you own that it's in the living room I just knew he'd been

1694
02:12:15,220 --> 02:12:20,340
playing No Man's Sky lately and it was kind of relevant so I didn't even think

1695
02:12:20,340 --> 02:12:23,260
about the modding community and what modding is probably done to that game on

1696
02:12:23,260 --> 02:12:30,700
PC I bet it's something so that's cool all right anyhow let's move on oh no I

1697
02:12:30,700 --> 02:12:33,860
want to say one more thing about the mech warrior thing so you're into like

1698
02:12:33,860 --> 02:12:37,260
the mech games is this something you're thinking about um yeah probably not

1699
02:12:37,260 --> 02:12:41,300
going to I used to play the like one of the mech warrior games a while back but

1700
02:12:41,500 --> 02:12:47,220
I've kind of got him out of it all right well you know I love these little mini

1701
02:12:47,220 --> 02:12:50,900
arcade cabinets that I have right in fact some of them are actually branded

1702
02:12:50,900 --> 02:12:55,620
the whole my arcade thing and I think there's one over there this burger time

1703
02:12:55,620 --> 02:12:59,940
one which isn't on cam but I'll go grab it here this burger time one is a my

1704
02:12:59,940 --> 02:13:04,860
arcade machine and they're actually putting out a new version of this so

1705
02:13:04,860 --> 02:13:07,980
there's gonna be something like this but I think it's gonna be a little bit

1706
02:13:07,980 --> 02:13:11,060
bigger and for those these are the ones that they have I think a target target

1707
02:13:11,060 --> 02:13:15,020
is where you can get these the my arcade things so actually and I should

1708
02:13:15,020 --> 02:13:20,260
try turning it on so you guys can really see what this looks like if I can

1709
02:13:20,260 --> 02:13:23,300
remember oh no the whole the whole bottom is the whole little like on

1710
02:13:23,300 --> 02:13:29,700
switch and then hopefully it'll come on here and mm-hmm so sorry I'm starting it

1711
02:13:29,700 --> 02:13:32,480
up here trying to show the folks on Twitch what it looks like but it's a

1712
02:13:32,480 --> 02:13:36,820
pretty it's a pretty faithful reinterpretation of like burger time a

1713
02:13:36,820 --> 02:13:42,700
lot of them are our console versions yeah they really are yeah so I think of

1714
02:13:42,700 --> 02:13:46,020
this like Coleco or I think it's probably a little beyond that actually I

1715
02:13:46,020 --> 02:13:51,900
know that the the Cubert one was very similar to the Coleco version with a

1716
02:13:51,900 --> 02:13:58,620
few little bit of graphical tweaks mm-hmm so this same company the my arcade

1717
02:13:58,620 --> 02:14:02,860
is going to be putting out a Namco museum mini player it's going to have

1718
02:14:02,860 --> 02:14:08,980
20 different games on it including you know you would expect pac-man pac-man 2

1719
02:14:08,980 --> 02:14:12,980
pac-mania but also some other interesting selections including dragon

1720
02:14:12,980 --> 02:14:17,380
spirit that one's pretty cool rolling thunder all three of them splatter house

1721
02:14:17,380 --> 02:14:20,460
both of those games so it's kind of interesting a little bit of a diverse

1722
02:14:20,460 --> 02:14:24,260
selection from Namco the screen on that it's going to be four and a quarter

1723
02:14:24,260 --> 02:14:28,140
inches so I think that's a bit larger it's probably twice the size of what I

1724
02:14:28,140 --> 02:14:32,820
just showed mm-hmm on the twitch stream so it's a lot larger and it has but it's

1725
02:14:32,820 --> 02:14:36,620
a more vertical screen so it will kind of be more like an iPhone type of shape

1726
02:14:36,620 --> 02:14:40,620
or an Android you know more like the vertical shape but at the four and a

1727
02:14:40,620 --> 02:14:44,420
quarter inches so it's gonna have 20 games in it and it's going to retail I

1728
02:14:44,420 --> 02:14:50,580
believe for $99.99 and it's on its way out right now you can get it on Amazon

1729
02:14:50,580 --> 02:14:55,380
and my arcade calm it is kind of expensive I mean well if you think about

1730
02:14:55,380 --> 02:14:59,500
that that little burger time thing I just showed on cam that was about 35 I

1731
02:14:59,500 --> 02:15:06,620
want to say maybe 30 no I think it was 30 and then the Walmart ones which is a

1732
02:15:06,620 --> 02:15:11,460
different series those are arcade classics those set me back about 20 a

1733
02:15:11,460 --> 02:15:16,240
pop so but I do think I do think that my arcade ones they're little you can see

1734
02:15:16,240 --> 02:15:19,820
they're a little fancier they're a little sturdier the screens a slight bit

1735
02:15:19,820 --> 02:15:23,380
bigger I think they're a slight better quality it's not that the arcade classic

1736
02:15:23,380 --> 02:15:26,780
ones are bad they're really not they're good too but I think the my arcade ones

1737
02:15:26,780 --> 02:15:28,900
are definitely like a better quality so it's interesting that they're kind of

1738
02:15:28,900 --> 02:15:33,260
taking this one step further with this Namco museum collection but you know

1739
02:15:33,260 --> 02:15:36,340
these things are these these retro collections and things are really

1740
02:15:36,340 --> 02:15:41,980
everywhere so now Tigerclaw points out some of the my arcade little cabinets

1741
02:15:41,980 --> 02:15:45,340
have a bunch of games on them and they're mostly ripoff games I think that

1742
02:15:45,340 --> 02:15:49,220
a stranger things thing we saw recently which had come up on the show yeah it's

1743
02:15:49,220 --> 02:15:54,700
one of those examples too and that one was a little bit cheap looking um metal

1744
02:15:54,700 --> 02:15:58,500
mayhem says is there any device out there where pac-man hasn't appeared on

1745
02:15:58,500 --> 02:16:02,100
by this point well if it wasn't on there voluntarily I'm sure somebody put it on

1746
02:16:02,100 --> 02:16:11,260
there for sure so anyway yeah so that's it my arcade of Namco museum I I'm

1747
02:16:11,260 --> 02:16:14,460
interested but I a hundred bucks is a lot of money especially for the retro

1748
02:16:14,460 --> 02:16:17,960
stuff but I want to get more of the little cabinets the single game

1749
02:16:17,960 --> 02:16:22,360
cabinets I love that there's stuff like wreck-it Ralph or I'm sorry fix-it Felix

1750
02:16:22,360 --> 02:16:25,160
is the game obviously wreck-it Ralph inspired I love that that is where he

1751
02:16:25,160 --> 02:16:29,880
needs his own game he does like along the lines of rampage mm-hmm and there's

1752
02:16:29,880 --> 02:16:32,600
another what there was another one that was like 70 bucks I saw a target that

1753
02:16:32,600 --> 02:16:35,440
had a bunch of stuff in it I think this might be the one Tigerclaws linking with

1754
02:16:35,440 --> 02:16:38,880
bad dudes and there's other stuff in there too that's it was like a Data East

1755
02:16:38,880 --> 02:16:41,420
collection yeah it's a Data East collection is exactly what it is and I

1756
02:16:41,420 --> 02:16:43,920
think bad dudes is kind of like the one that they put on the box because that's

1757
02:16:43,920 --> 02:16:48,360
one of the most recognizable games in it I still I still kind of want one of

1758
02:16:48,360 --> 02:16:51,760
those arcade 1up machines I still feel like that might be a thing I end up

1759
02:16:51,760 --> 02:16:55,600
getting myself for the holidays because I know one of our friends star soccer I

1760
02:16:55,600 --> 02:16:59,880
got one of those Star Wars ones over the weekend or at least ordered it and I

1761
02:16:59,880 --> 02:17:02,800
know they were talking in chat there might be other people interested in

1762
02:17:02,800 --> 02:17:08,440
getting the Star Wars one so yeah those things those things look really cool so

1763
02:17:08,440 --> 02:17:13,400
all right well at this point we are going to open up our discord for you

1764

1773
02:17:50,200 --> 02:17:52,840
to it I see somebody just joined the green room and we haven't had a call in

1774
02:17:52,840 --> 02:17:56,480
a while so let's get to it hi you are on orange launch radio who's this hey

1775
02:17:56,480 --> 02:17:59,920
what's going on everyone it's wrong though hey Rama is great to hear from

1776
02:17:59,920 --> 02:18:04,120
you what's on your mind tonight not much is great to hear you guys to see you

1777
02:18:04,120 --> 02:18:09,360
guys every week well hello hello to what to what you want to talk about tonight

1778
02:18:09,360 --> 02:18:13,640
all right so it was a couple things I want to talk about but I could save that

1779
02:18:13,640 --> 02:18:19,320
for another time but anything I want to talk about in regards to Nintendo

1780
02:18:19,320 --> 02:18:26,240
patching out Kristin Aussie's voice in Fire Emblem yeah what about that well I

1781
02:18:26,240 --> 02:18:32,400
will say this I mean it's no secret that I've been part of the anime cosplay

1782
02:18:32,400 --> 02:18:37,440
fandom for about 20 years and several of those years I've gotten friendly with

1783
02:18:37,480 --> 02:18:45,560
various voice actors and the sad part is his actions it's sort of been like sort

1784
02:18:45,560 --> 02:18:51,200
of not documented but well known it's like people around him knew this and the

1785
02:18:51,200 --> 02:18:56,800
thing is it just takes something big for everybody to come out of the woodwork to

1786
02:18:56,800 --> 02:19:04,600
point fingers at him for his actions now I do not condone what he did but I do

1787
02:19:04,600 --> 02:19:12,440
respect him in the way that he is going to do his best to make amends I look at

1788
02:19:12,440 --> 02:19:19,320
it this way um if you if you make mistakes it's up to you to own up and

1789
02:19:19,320 --> 02:19:24,600
redeem yourself so others can see it you've become a better person yeah I

1790
02:19:24,600 --> 02:19:29,200
think part of you know fixing mistakes though is kind of like accepting the

1791
02:19:29,200 --> 02:19:35,440
punishment like you know you did the crime do the time sort of thing right so

1792
02:19:35,440 --> 02:19:39,840
I mean I and I think this whole removal and and and shaming and so forth is kind

1793
02:19:39,840 --> 02:19:45,280
of a part of that it's true and I said this may have killed his career but

1794
02:19:45,280 --> 02:19:51,400
given how he made this long apology now it's not the first time I've seen

1795
02:19:51,400 --> 02:19:55,240
something like this right now there's something big going on in a community

1796
02:19:55,240 --> 02:20:02,040
with a million dollar lawsuit we'll just leave that that but if he's being

1797
02:20:02,040 --> 02:20:06,000
sincere about his actions and you know what he's he should get a second chance

1798
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:11,400
if he's just saying it just to cover himself and save faith then you know

1799
02:20:11,400 --> 02:20:18,760
what you're done right no I and I can I can be open to that you know if you know

1800
02:20:18,760 --> 02:20:21,520
kind of accept the consequences which it sounds like you know I'm not following

1801
02:20:21,720 --> 02:20:25,440
this guy probably as closely but if he is accepting the consequences and doing

1802
02:20:25,440 --> 02:20:30,880
that and trying to be better from it then you know the whole idea of

1803
02:20:30,880 --> 02:20:34,920
rehabilitation is the first place is to get better and do better so as long as

1804
02:20:34,920 --> 02:20:40,080
the actions show that a person is doing better then I think there's room to

1805
02:20:40,080 --> 02:20:46,880
forgive that I guess or you know except that a person can change absolutely it's

1806
02:20:46,880 --> 02:20:52,640
just sad that it things like this come out this way it's like you make it big

1807
02:20:52,640 --> 02:20:58,320
then somebody from your past reminds you of something shitty you've done and you

1808
02:20:58,320 --> 02:21:03,160
never owned up to it it's sort of like the whole James Gunn thing with Guardians

1809
02:21:03,160 --> 02:21:07,840
of the Galaxy that he's owned up to what he's done frequently and then it keeps

1810
02:21:07,840 --> 02:21:15,280
coming back and he end up losing his job now he has his job back you know one I

1811
02:21:15,280 --> 02:21:17,800
think a lot of that was about how he kind of played that out in the public

1812
02:21:17,800 --> 02:21:24,400
eye too you know and that's why he's kind of back doing the film again so

1813
02:21:24,400 --> 02:21:28,320
interesting it has is he a big and I'm sorry I might have missed this is he big

1814
02:21:28,320 --> 02:21:31,280
in that like anime scene does he do voices there too is that how you kind of

1815
02:21:31,280 --> 02:21:37,960
know a little more about this yeah one of the voices he's known for is he is

1816
02:21:37,960 --> 02:21:45,920
Helios in Sailor Moon supers which is produced by this interesting okay didn't

1817
02:21:45,920 --> 02:21:51,720
know that you might know him by his alternate name on YouTube kerboffer I

1818
02:21:51,720 --> 02:21:57,200
don't watch enough YouTube stuff to know he's done various voices and then been

1819
02:21:57,200 --> 02:22:02,000
in backgrounds and various like tracks and stuff like that so I swear I kind of

1820
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:06,600
know him so interesting all right well before I let you go anything else you

1821
02:22:06,600 --> 02:22:11,480
want to talk about tonight if I'm looking at the couch correctly do I see

1822
02:22:11,480 --> 02:22:16,760
a reference to the Golden Girls between Loki and Pikachu you do this is actually

1823
02:22:16,760 --> 02:22:21,600
a calendar that Loki got for Christmas and if you've been watching if you've

1824
02:22:21,600 --> 02:22:25,200
been paying attention on the stream we have updated it every month with the

1825
02:22:25,200 --> 02:22:30,160
latest month that we're on so this is July's picture which is again for the

1826
02:22:30,160 --> 02:22:33,480
sake of the podcast listeners I'm describing it a little bit it is Sophia

1827
02:22:33,640 --> 02:22:38,640
cooking up a dish and Blanche is looking on at it and the quote says if this

1828
02:22:38,640 --> 02:22:42,920
sauce were a person I'd get naked and make love to it and that was a Sophia

1829
02:22:42,920 --> 02:22:50,360
quote there you go I watched every single episode of that show when it was

1830
02:22:50,360 --> 02:22:54,960
on the air it's great I know a lot of like bros who watch Golden Girls it's

1831
02:22:54,960 --> 02:23:02,160
it's it's funny for everybody yes yes cuz let's be real most was watched it

1832
02:23:02,160 --> 02:23:08,720
for be Arthur anyway I always loved Betty White even at a young age so but

1833
02:23:08,720 --> 02:23:12,520
yes of course of course be Arthur I mean they were all great in their own ways so

1834
02:23:12,520 --> 02:23:16,680
it's interesting though how much merchandise and shit there is now with

1835
02:23:16,680 --> 02:23:27,120
all that be Arthur I'm on my wine break yes one of my favorite try to bullshit

1836
02:23:27,120 --> 02:23:32,840
one of my favorite be Arthur moments was from the Golden Girls and I just

1837
02:23:32,840 --> 02:23:35,760
will never forget this one is that you know where I think it's Betty White says

1838
02:23:35,760 --> 02:23:40,160
and where are you going and she goes to get ice cream or commit a felony I'm

1839
02:23:40,160 --> 02:23:43,160
gonna decide in the car

1840
02:23:44,840 --> 02:23:51,240
Blanche about homophobia oh yeah there's that yeah condoms rose condoms

1841
02:23:51,240 --> 02:24:00,000
condoms condoms yeah it was amazing moment too I remember it Sicily Golden

1842
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:04,280
Girls are great on a future episode of olr we were just going to act out scenes

1843
02:24:04,280 --> 02:24:07,920
from the Golden Girls so I don't know what part Loki's gonna play but we'll

1844
02:24:07,920 --> 02:24:11,800
figure that out I think I think Loki kind of would be the Dorothy in this

1845
02:24:11,800 --> 02:24:19,980
situation I really do I'm definitely the Blanche probably of this group I think

1846
02:24:19,980 --> 02:24:26,700
our soccer would be Sophia you know what just go to SDCC and cosplay as the

1847
02:24:26,700 --> 02:24:30,900
Golden Girls and I'll stand behind you with a boom box playing to sound playing

1848
02:24:30,900 --> 02:24:35,620
at the theme song you would dark soccer you would definitely the one be the one

1849
02:24:35,620 --> 02:24:44,220
that would be like picture it Namco arcade mobile 1996 and then not give a

1850
02:24:44,220 --> 02:24:52,020
shit yes I'd say the dry things absolutely all right anyway all right

1851
02:24:52,020 --> 02:24:54,340
I'm gonna let you go Rama so we can squeeze in another call but they walk

1852
02:24:54,340 --> 02:24:59,860
out with my with my Walker good to hear it was always my friend right back at

1853
02:24:59,860 --> 02:25:04,340
you all right bye all right let's get to another call here on the show hello

1854
02:25:04,340 --> 02:25:07,620
you're on orange launch radio who's this

1855
02:25:07,820 --> 02:25:12,780
hello no hello hey this is that deaf sorry I had my

1856
02:25:12,780 --> 02:25:16,860
mute on that's okay sometimes I know we surprise you when we drag and drop you

1857
02:25:16,860 --> 02:25:20,740
on air what's on your mind tonight well I want to talk about something that

1858
02:25:20,740 --> 02:25:30,100
happened Mexico this week involving eSports a little back of a little

1859
02:25:30,100 --> 02:25:37,380
backstory there's this Federation eSports Federation in Mexico that was

1860
02:25:37,780 --> 02:25:45,540
initiated back in February if I remember correctly so it's like okay a big deal

1861
02:25:45,540 --> 02:25:51,940
so we can have like national teams support for for the eSports community

1862
02:25:51,940 --> 02:25:58,900
here in Mexico all good fast forward to this week they're starting their their

1863
02:25:58,900 --> 02:26:06,140
tournaments they're starting out to scout for national team members and they

1864
02:26:06,140 --> 02:26:15,820
start charging the around 600 pesos which is around I think let me get my

1865
02:26:15,820 --> 02:26:22,700
calculations almost correctly like $30 which isn't much but right the thing is

1866
02:26:22,700 --> 02:26:29,660
they are affiliated with the National Sports Committee in Mexico so they are

1867
02:26:29,660 --> 02:26:37,620
a civil association they cannot profit of any tournament or anything an event

1868
02:26:37,620 --> 02:26:46,220
they they're doing so it's like a really really bad situation for them and in in

1869
02:26:46,220 --> 02:26:50,140
especially because one of the tournaments they were they are holding

1870
02:26:50,140 --> 02:26:57,460
is for clash of clans or one one of the mobile games and supercell the developer

1871
02:26:57,580 --> 02:27:04,100
came out on Twitter and told them hey hey guys you cannot charge any any

1872
02:27:04,100 --> 02:27:11,340
amount of money for any of the participants so it yeah it was a really

1873
02:27:11,340 --> 02:27:17,580
really big deal this week in Mexico because of that and and actually one of

1874
02:27:17,580 --> 02:27:23,420
the under of the people one of the heads of famous which was just called came out

1875
02:27:23,420 --> 02:27:29,300
and said that yeah they didn't like expected this to happen because they do

1876
02:27:29,300 --> 02:27:35,380
need the money they they do have to pay for the train training for the for the

1877
02:27:35,380 --> 02:27:40,660
participants if they get selected they have to pay the trips they have to pay

1878
02:27:40,660 --> 02:27:44,940
everything involved for for the making of these tournaments so it's

1879
02:27:44,940 --> 02:27:51,660
understandable but they should have like came out of upfront about it it's like

1880
02:27:51,700 --> 02:27:55,980
the many people here and including myself we're kind of disappointed on

1881
02:27:55,980 --> 02:28:03,300
that and how they handle it because it's like really really like shady stuff be

1882
02:28:03,300 --> 02:28:11,140
all behind all I have talked about already where they try to make I was

1883
02:28:11,140 --> 02:28:16,380
just saying were they trying to make a claim about where the money was going at

1884
02:28:16,380 --> 02:28:20,260
the start when they actually announced the tournaments and all that stuff they

1885
02:28:20,260 --> 02:28:27,700
just they just said you have to be affiliated with them with famous and you

1886
02:28:27,700 --> 02:28:33,660
have to pay the 600 pesos they didn't say why they didn't say like oh we need

1887
02:28:33,660 --> 02:28:39,260
this to pay for for all the events and in all that all the other stuff that is

1888
02:28:39,260 --> 02:28:44,940
needed which is understandable but again they weren't clear about it and it was

1889
02:28:44,940 --> 02:28:51,220
like until like a few days ago I think Friday that an article popped out in an

1890
02:28:51,220 --> 02:28:56,580
interview they they made what up with a website here in Mexico that actually

1891
02:28:56,580 --> 02:29:01,980
like explain all that but again it's like way too late and many people are

1892
02:29:01,980 --> 02:29:08,460
like actually mad legit mad about it so it's understand again it's understandable

1893
02:29:08,460 --> 02:29:13,220
why they did it but they should have like been clear about it from the

1894
02:29:13,220 --> 02:29:16,380
beginning yeah especially when like the developers are probably sitting here

1895
02:29:16,380 --> 02:29:19,420
thinking these folks that are completely unaffiliated with us are making money

1896
02:29:19,420 --> 02:29:22,900
off of our games using our games in the promotion using our games to attract

1897
02:29:22,900 --> 02:29:26,340
people and then they're charging this fee for them and even if the fee is you

1898
02:29:26,340 --> 02:29:30,060
know pretty nominal you know three bucks is not a whole lot of money it's cheaper

1899
02:29:30,060 --> 02:29:33,500
than a grande at Starbucks and all is said and done but it's it's the

1900
02:29:33,500 --> 02:29:41,740
principle yeah actually $30 I think but again not not that big of a deal with

1901
02:29:41,740 --> 02:29:47,340
with the money involved but it's the thing that yeah even they got in trouble

1902
02:29:47,340 --> 02:29:51,980
kind of in trouble with supercell which is again the developer they came out and

1903
02:29:51,980 --> 02:29:57,020
you cannot charge these official rules for any official tournament it's like

1904
02:29:57,020 --> 02:30:03,740
you cannot charge any participant at all even like even if there's like an an

1905
02:30:03,740 --> 02:30:09,660
entry fee for the venue you cannot charge them that yeah it's a free entry

1906
02:30:09,660 --> 02:30:14,900
for any participant and they're also involved with overwatch not necessarily

1907
02:30:14,900 --> 02:30:18,860
League but the World Cup and also other games like the League of Legends and

1908
02:30:18,860 --> 02:30:26,660
others other games that are going like they have a World Cup basically huh

1909
02:30:26,660 --> 02:30:30,260
interesting well I'll be curious to kind of see if there's more that develops on

1910
02:30:30,260 --> 02:30:33,660
this if more companies kind of come out against it or if you know these guys

1911
02:30:33,660 --> 02:30:38,540
kind of reverse course on that or give a little more clarity to where these this

1912
02:30:38,540 --> 02:30:41,580
money is why they're collecting it where it's going or if they suddenly

1913
02:30:41,580 --> 02:30:44,300
make a big charitable donation or I'll be curious to kind of see where this

1914
02:30:44,300 --> 02:30:51,980
ends up yeah me too actually because again it I actually want to for them to

1915
02:30:51,980 --> 02:31:00,500
like do do good do better actually yeah because they're trying to get like games

1916
02:31:00,500 --> 02:31:07,260
officially recognized by the the International Olympics Committee they're

1917
02:31:07,260 --> 02:31:14,660
working really hard on it and but like this this kind of stuff is like kind of

1918
02:31:14,660 --> 02:31:20,220
disappointing if anything for sure for sure all right my friend I'm gonna let

1919
02:31:20,220 --> 02:31:24,180

1920
02:31:24,180 --> 02:31:28,100

1924
02:31:42,340 --> 02:31:45,980
oops I almost closed OBS I'm going to close discord we are about to the end of

1925
02:31:45,980 --> 02:31:49,680
another episode of orange lounge radio not bad for a week of news that was a

1926
02:31:49,680 --> 02:31:52,340
little bit slower although I should check in make sure we're low-key there's

1927
02:31:52,340 --> 02:31:55,860
no last-minute stories there's just one last thing I was gonna mention so the

1928
02:31:55,860 --> 02:31:59,940
Epic Games Store put out some new free games for the month and one of those was

1929
02:31:59,940 --> 02:32:03,500
a game called moon lighter which apparently someone spotted that there

1930
02:32:03,500 --> 02:32:09,140
was the enable cloud save function and which they'd come in that on Twitter

1931
02:32:09,140 --> 02:32:13,500
and Tim Sweeney responded with we've actually enabled cloud saves for a

1932
02:32:13,500 --> 02:32:17,140
couple of games right now but they'll be rolling out more so it's another

1933
02:32:17,140 --> 02:32:20,940
enhancement that they're finally adding to their storefront that they really

1934
02:32:20,940 --> 02:32:24,620
should have tried it for a while yeah something to try to kind of maybe

1935
02:32:24,620 --> 02:32:28,020
justify a lot more of those exclusives they're snapping up when people don't

1936
02:32:28,020 --> 02:32:30,680
really want to use their store so interesting interesting we'll see what

1937
02:32:30,680 --> 02:32:35,100

02:33:16,300 --> 02:33:21,420
would be fantastic otherwise I think I think that's all I've got to say and I

1949
02:33:21,420 --> 02:33:24,360
think we're ready to go around and get everybody's final thoughts we will be

1950
02:33:24,360 --> 02:33:28,000
back in seven days to do this all over again Bobby black wolf who airs live

1951
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:32,080
before us at a voice keys Network will not be live next week he is off to a

1952
02:33:32,080 --> 02:33:37,200
convention called Gen Con which is very big on the board games I know so I'm

1953
02:33:37,200 --> 02:33:39,840
hoping he will get some video even if it's board games I'm sure he'll bring

1954
02:33:39,840 --> 02:33:42,980
back some video and I would think somewhere in that building there's some

1955
02:33:42,980 --> 02:33:46,000
video game representation so he'll probably get a little bit of that so

1956
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:51,560
yeah there's gonna be that and yeah we look forward to seeing you guys next

1957

to yourself but also though in more positive things just like don't be don't
