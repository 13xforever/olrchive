Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
This week teams plan to start bringing the Patsy into their Overwatch games. Someone who will cheat, stop the game they're losing, and spare their teammates the MMR loss.

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
The cat and mouse game continues. This is just one pessimistic view of tonight's news. The rest of the discussion and happier news starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:46.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 784 for this July the 14th of 2019.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.000
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me here in studio say hello to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Sup?

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
Sometimes on camera but sometimes not, it's her choice.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
Sometimes I notice when part of my face is on camera and I lean back.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
That's why I let you know where the boundary line is before we start.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
Just show a little leg.

01:06.000 --> 01:11.000
My mostly covered leg with my cat socks.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.000
Twitch after dark tonight. I hope I didn't violate the TOS. Sorry I didn't mean to.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
Showing a little leg. Is that violating TOS on Twitch? I don't know.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
No.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
Anyway, please don't bust us.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.000
Anyway, also joining us here in studio. Well he's showing a little leg in those shorts actually but I think it's off screen.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Techmaster Loki.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
No it's all on screen.

01:31.000 --> 01:35.000
Uh oh. Showing it all for the world to see.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
How scandalous. Showing knees on screen.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
A scandalo. How are you Loki?

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
I'm fine.

01:41.000 --> 01:48.000
So you got here to the studio a little late tonight. You were walking in during our little phone call with Bobby Blackwolf at the end there and I'm assuming it's dinner related.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
That some incompetent person took too long to make your food right?

01:51.000 --> 01:57.000
No I just left too late because I was making food at home and then I had to put away laundry before I left.

01:57.000 --> 02:02.000
And then it just took too long so I ended up leaving like 20 minutes late.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Fucking chores ruin everything.

02:04.000 --> 02:12.000
Well it's my own food. It's because tomorrow I start this thing at work. It's like a fitness health thing.

02:12.000 --> 02:19.000
And so I had to make detox soup which is a fancy way of saying like it's got a bunch of vegetables in it.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
Detoxing is bullshit. You have a liver.

02:22.000 --> 02:26.000
I understand. I completely understand but it's just a vegetable soup is really what it is.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
Okay so you're following up a vegetable soup with icycant that's like double bacon pizza.

02:31.000 --> 02:39.000
It's Sunday. It's not Monday. Monday is when I start so I am going to be detoxing from an extra bacon pizza.

02:39.000 --> 02:44.000
You are doing the classic I'm going on a diet tomorrow. Therefore I'm going to eat like absolute shit today.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
Oh I give myself more to work on.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
I just think you're doing the Lord's work.

02:48.000 --> 02:56.000
It's just because I've got to weigh in tomorrow and the few pounds that are right about where I'm at now are really easy for me to lose.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
So it's just stacking the deck.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Oh my God.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
So you're building gas.

03:01.000 --> 03:07.000
You're cheating the weight loss game. You're cheating at a weight loss competition at work. You're stacking the deck.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
I can't believe you're acting.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
That's what I do with the meditation challenge at work.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
I'm acquiring mass.

03:11.000 --> 03:17.000
I play the meditation app and then I go just leave it on in the corner while I'm playing a video game.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Wow.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
I'm not meditating.

03:19.000 --> 03:24.000
Am I the only one that takes these work challenges like can I actually do it. The last one we did at work was a step challenge.

03:24.000 --> 03:30.000
Oh I'm going to I'm going to take it serious. I'm just like you know I'm eating the pizza today because this is the only meal I've had so.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Okay.

03:31.000 --> 03:37.000
The one thing I will not do is the close the rings challenge because that's bullshit. I don't close the rings on purpose.

03:37.000 --> 03:42.000
Every time I close my rings on my Apple Watch I get this thing from Rob.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
Hey well done.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
I'm like girl I just marched in pride.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Wait did I.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Oh yeah I know I do I do try to send those.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
Well OK. So OK.

03:49.000 --> 03:54.000
So those that aren't part of like the Apple Watch cult or whatever like you have these rings.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
So you have one for if you stand 12 hours out of every day right.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
You have another one for burning 500 calories in a day.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Well that's my goal. I think you can set it whatever you want.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Mine's at 500.

04:04.000 --> 04:11.000
And then you have another one for and she's shown them on our twitch TV because we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice geeks network vog network dot com.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
Middle one is my first one which I've done jack shit today.

04:14.000 --> 04:18.000
The network dot com at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
So she's showing that off there on Twitch. But of course our audio only podcast is always free.

04:23.000 --> 04:30.000
But so yeah the rings one is for standing one is for calories the other one is for actual exercise and then you die in seven days.

04:30.000 --> 04:36.000
That one can be a little tricky because the watch has to kind of like detect that you're actually moving or like that your heart rate is up past a certain point.

04:36.000 --> 04:45.000
I'm not sure what it's detecting. It's like I don't know why it didn't trigger though when I was actually at pride because it did it when I was trucking around all over the Fillmore.

04:45.000 --> 04:53.000
Yeah there's plenty of days where like I will burn like 750 calories like I'll smash my red circle goal and I have zero minutes of exercise.

04:53.000 --> 05:06.000
Yeah I'm like that every day. I put my my daily burn. I've done the calculation and I you know I put my daily limit for 550 although I'm about to bump it up to 600 because I've been easily surpassing that lately.

05:06.000 --> 05:16.000
But it's like but like right today I'm almost at that goal and my my green ring for a workout is like nothing. So what else.

05:16.000 --> 05:32.000
But anyway so if you're not in this Apple thing so you can follow friends on there and if a friend of yours actually closes all the rings you can like send a little message from your phone and generally they're pretty encouraging like hey you smash that goal or good for you or like applause emojis.

05:32.000 --> 05:47.000
But I found and what Melody and I do is that we actually send one of the like 20 percent that will show up that are like these complete bitchy remarks that you can reply with like one of them says oh did you miss the bus today.

05:47.000 --> 05:57.000
Like there's these really like mean things you can send. So Melanie and I have taken to sending those to each other when we smash goals and like sometimes I'll get a middle finger emoji back or something and it's fun.

05:58.000 --> 06:11.000
See I don't use whatever is built into it because most of the time I'm replying from my phone. So I just make up my own snark. Yeah like girl I was just walking to the store and I'm in San Francisco it was uphill.

06:11.000 --> 06:23.000
Now I know it's a video game podcast but I think this is still on topic because this is the gamification of you know goals like exercise which I think we've kind of seen for several years.

06:23.000 --> 06:30.000
It's just you know Apple has their own way of doing it with the watch. We've certainly seen other ways of like gamifying you know weight loss and that type of stuff before.

06:30.000 --> 06:41.000
Well there's like the RPG system from nerd fit where you level up based on your accomplishments because I used to do do that number.

06:41.000 --> 06:50.000
I remember some like nerd RPG thing that they showed it like gamer excellent year or something and some of us kind of got on that right after that and I think that might be what you're talking about.

06:50.000 --> 07:06.000
Yeah but I'll be perfectly honest that for me I'm not competitive so I only share like with two people and that's like you and one of my co-workers because I'm not competitive and I don't want my health to be regulated to a competition.

07:06.000 --> 07:23.000
That's and that's fair. You know your body your choice. But for me to have it set a certain goals that like I'm leveling myself up. That's certainly much easier to me. It makes a lot more sense for me to do this for myself as my own single player not MMO.

07:23.000 --> 07:35.000
You know you know how I am on an MMO anyway I just played by myself but excuse me I will say the gamification in some ways kind of works because like the the month and a half or so that I was going to the gym.

07:35.000 --> 07:44.000
I was going to the gym very regularly and I was closing my circles every single day and that was right up until I left for Chicago and I actually lost I probably lost a good like 10 pounds in a month.

07:44.000 --> 07:51.000
Now I would say I've gained a good chunk of it back because I kind of fell out of the habit after I won a vacation I came back and then I started doing other things.

07:51.000 --> 07:59.000
I've been playing that other game I've talked about on previous episodes has been taking up a lot of my free time and like I have to rush home to do things because of time zones and stuff.

07:59.000 --> 08:05.000
So I've really fallen off the gym bandwagon and that's kind of a bummer but you know gamification will hopefully help me get back on that.

08:05.000 --> 08:11.000
And you know the anticipation of nasty messages for melody when I achieve my goals. It could be motivating a little bit.

08:11.000 --> 08:18.000
Now going to our chat room of course to be. Yeah we do have of course our live chat room over twitch TV slash vogue network and we do tape live.

08:18.000 --> 08:28.000
See it to bury is saying that Google Fit which you know would be obviously the other side of things not Apple but Google says it has its circles but its heart points and move minutes.

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
Yeah they got rid of their circles when they just you know they shut down Google Plus.

08:33.000 --> 08:38.000
Well and I'm sure I'm sure Fitbit has their own thing like everybody has like something on that.

08:38.000 --> 08:45.000
Fitbit just has like you can compare yourself with like other people like to see like where you're at with your goals during the day because I had a Fitbit before I had Apple Watch.

08:45.000 --> 08:53.000
Yeah it says you fell out of the habit. Did you return the habit to the nunnery. Which of us here is the actual drag none. That would be this bitch.

08:53.000 --> 09:02.000
I saw a shirt at Spencer's that totally made me think you know something about how many fucks do I have to give. And it's a nun flipping you off. It says none and you and I need.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Yeah you need to check that out anyway.

09:04.000 --> 09:12.000
Pixel pakas in chat says the name of that RPG was habit RPG. I think it got renamed to habitica.

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
I don't know if I'm saying that right but it's probably gone through some evolutions there as well.

09:16.000 --> 09:25.000
So anyway there you go gamification of our exercise and other things that we do in life. Heck counting calories in a way is gamification a little bit a little bit.

09:26.000 --> 09:39.000
One of the things that I've actually left feedback for is that I would love for it to register my weightlifting because you don't always get your heart rate up as high when you do but it's a steadier heart rate.

09:39.000 --> 09:50.000
And I would like for it to register what the heart rate is when you're lifting doing hard lifting as opposed to just cardio because there is more to exercise than cardio.

09:50.000 --> 10:01.000
There is wanting to turn oneself into Linda Linda Hamilton from Terminator 2. I'm just saying which is a lofty goal. Yes. One of these days I'm going to have those guns or hell even the new Terminator movie.

10:01.000 --> 10:06.000
Have you seen what she looks like in this new Terminator movie. Probably still just as awesome considering her age. She still looks great.

10:07.000 --> 10:18.000
So I I wanted to I really that's like been ever since I saw Terminator 2. I'm like holy shit I want those arms and dance like those are very feminine arms. I'm like fuck you.

10:18.000 --> 10:31.000
Those are womanly arms and they will punch you in the deck. They will punch a man in the liver punch your gender roles right out of here. They will punch a man in the kidneys until he pees blood.

10:32.000 --> 10:47.000
Wow. OK. Those are goals. Those are goals. OK. Fuck the patriarchy. I will kick the patriarchy so hard. All right. But where were we. I'm sorry. You totally lost. You went off Linda Hamilton. Yeah I know there's something before that.

10:47.000 --> 10:59.000
Oh well exercise. Yeah exercise. It's great. Yes. We should do it. Yes. At some point. I know. All right. When my other stuff settles down I guess going to have to be after Dragon Con at this point. So we'll see anyway.

10:59.000 --> 11:11.000
All right. Let's get into some gaming news and stuff that's going on around the industry. This is the big story from this week and I know a lot of people are talking about this because Nintendo kind of surprised us with it.

11:12.000 --> 11:29.000
This is totally unheard of. Although this is also one of those things where it's kind of been rumored for a little while and I know some of you don't ever stock in rumors but like some rumors are too loud to ignore and this is one of them is that the Nintendo switch was going to get a smaller version a light version.

11:29.000 --> 11:37.000
It should be worth noting that many of the rumors have included that the switch will be getting a pro version as well. However nothing has been officially confirmed in that context.

11:37.000 --> 11:47.000
But that rumor was supposed to be for next year. And those rumors kind of shifted to that that was being delayed about another year and that the only the light version would be happening.

11:47.000 --> 11:57.000
And this week Nintendo themselves confirmed. Yes the Nintendo switch light. It's real. It's going to be coming September 20th and the price for this is two hundred dollars.

11:57.000 --> 12:10.000
But the irony about it is a switch that does not switch. So it is a switch in name only which you know that is the console's name. The little joy. There's no detachable joy cons. Those do not pop off.

12:10.000 --> 12:18.000
So if you have any games that require those such as I don't know one to switch I'm sure there's some other games you can't play them play those games with this console.

12:18.000 --> 12:30.000
But I'm going to give you a very big reason to bring out a switch like this. Animal Crossing. Sure. People want to be able to take their villages on the go and they may not want to take a fully detachable.

12:30.000 --> 12:40.000
I want one of these. I really do want one because it'd be easier to play you know the RPGs on the go without having you know leaving the system where say Dan can't play it.

12:40.000 --> 12:50.000
And of course it's not like I paid anything for my switch. So I don't care. Well what they mean by switches switch from the 3 D.S. to this new thing because the 3 D.S. is dead now.

12:50.000 --> 12:59.000
Well yeah there I think that is definitely like that was my first reaction to as I was kind of like finally they killed the 3 D.S. like that's that's done with.

12:59.000 --> 13:09.000
And I get it. And before D.J. Ramos is in chat going boo. And I know he's not happy about this but look I'm not I'm not anti 3 D.S. by any means.

13:09.000 --> 13:20.000
But I do think it is time for Nintendo to kind of put all their development stock in one place. And you know the switch is just the more technologically kind of advanced system at this point.

13:21.000 --> 13:30.000
And I think I think it's probably for the best that they start to move away from the 3 D.S. and the 2 D.S. and that this is probably the nail in the coffin of 3 D.S.

13:30.000 --> 13:38.000
Not to say third party developers in these home brews. And I don't think Nintendo plans to necessarily like pull the plug on 3 D.S. I don't think you're going to see it.

13:38.000 --> 13:49.000
I don't think you're going to see that happen at 3 D.S. like it did with the Wii U like that they're now they'll just go sit but they're going to either going to ghost it a little bit and it's going to kind of run on fumes with the third party developers and stuff for a little while.

13:49.000 --> 13:56.000
What if though they come out later with like a switch like this that has the 3 D screen support.

13:57.000 --> 14:14.000
That would be pretty cool. I'd be into that. Although I don't know really worked hard on getting that 3 D in for well but years before the 3 D 3 is unpopular and even Nintendo started to walk away from 3 D because they had the 2 D.S. that came out you know a little ways into the the lifespan of the 3 D.S.

14:14.000 --> 14:20.000
When a new Pokemon game was on the horizon and I was going to say it's funny you bring up Animal Crossing and I think that is very legit.

14:20.000 --> 14:28.000
I think Animal Crossing is a great reason for a system like this. I think less people are actually pointing that out because the more obvious one is Pokemon.

14:28.000 --> 14:35.000
Pokemon is going to be the game that comes out first and they're even doing a Pokemon themed like there's a sword and shield themed switch light.

14:35.000 --> 14:47.000
I will say this even though personally I'm not interested in the switch lightless system I have a regular switch and as far as I'm concerned it's portable enough for what I need to do but I get I get it's a little bigger.

14:47.000 --> 14:53.000
It needs its own case. I can't exactly put it in my pocket or in a little little tiny little bag or anything like that.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
I can't put it in a pocket because women's pockets suck.

14:56.000 --> 15:00.000
But you could put it in a purse or a small bag right. Those switch lights are pretty.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.000
If only they had women that designed clothes.

15:03.000 --> 15:18.000
Oh stop it. All right. Anyway where was I going to go. Oh yes. So even though I'm I personally don't plan on getting the switch light like I'm pretty impressed at all the different like colors and design like they're really they're nice looking systems.

15:18.000 --> 15:32.000
I will say that like you know if I had waited to get a switch for whatever reason I might be enticed just because these things look better than my boring gray switch with the gray joy cons and the fact that it doesn't play one two switches even more of a plus.

15:33.000 --> 15:47.000
Now Bobby Black Wolf in our chat points out a very good point here saying the only worry for me is that I hope developers don't abandon the features that aren't available on the switch light like HD rumble AR camera and so forth.

15:47.000 --> 15:58.000
That's a very good concern because now if you develop a game that's going to use the HR rumble or even detachable joy cons or what have you you know that if somebody has a switch light they can't play your game.

15:58.000 --> 16:16.000
Now I don't think there's a lot of games that rely on that anyway. But also Bobby I think an interesting sort of thing that may happen with that is that we know the switch light is the thing but we also know that Nintendo I mean we don't know but if rumors are to be believed how they ended up true in this case.

16:16.000 --> 16:31.000
Nintendo is also working on a switch pro so they may develop something for this switch pro that does use those things because they want to push people towards that switch pro come holiday 2020 or whenever they plan on putting that thing out.

16:31.000 --> 16:37.000
I mean I don't know I certainly just market segmentation is great. Let's do that some more.

16:37.000 --> 16:52.000
And then why we are kind of follows up Bobby's comment with because you design for the lowest common denominator if you want the greatest reach that is very true. I mean how many games ended up being new 3DS very few like very few 10 and 20.

16:52.000 --> 17:03.000
I don't even think it was that many honestly unless you count like the Super Nintendo Virtual Console. But anyway, let's see. Also, another comment I thought was really good. Where was it pixel pocket said Oh yes.

17:03.000 --> 17:16.000
Now this is in regards to the 3DS and its lifespan pistol pockets points out the Vita is still alive and getting games. The 3DS will still live as well just not likely with continued support from Nintendo.

17:16.000 --> 17:27.000
I think that's a very good comparison to where I expect the 3DS to be. And in fact, I think the 3DS will be in a better place than the Vita is right now. I didn't Sony like finally like just kill support for the Vita officially stopped.

17:28.000 --> 17:49.000
Make new systems. Yeah. Yeah. So I think Nintendo and 3DS fans still have a couple years before Nintendo is going to get to that point. But yeah, I mean, that's a good example is look at the Vita and maybe that will give you a little hope for those of you that are still, you know, excited about your 3DS and I, you know, I get that the 3DS has a distinct look to it with the top screen in the bottom screen.

17:50.000 --> 18:03.000
I wish there was a way that they could make some of those games work on the switch if you tilted your switch vertically. I don't I don't know why this is completely outside the realm of possibility, especially when many games towards the end of life were very 2D only because 2DS is we're out there.

18:03.000 --> 18:25.000
So, and many people are saying that the switch light is kind of like the 2DS of the switch or obscure. Yeah, the 2DS switch. I can see that. Yeah. And I can kind of see that too. I don't I don't think a lot of the like hardcore gamers will get this, but this is going to be a better system for kids or like teenagers. I could really see like the 1318 crowd. This would be a big thing.

18:26.000 --> 18:42.000
Maybe. I just don't know. Like last few years, it seems like Nintendo will come out with a system with some gimmicks to it, really push that at launch and then completely abandon them, you know, as they go along, kind of like they did with the 3DS.

18:42.000 --> 19:05.000
3D graphics are 3D without glasses. That was like amazing. And we don't use it anymore. Or, you know, with the Wii U, like I'm trying to think they were doing more stuff with that screen as like a second screen for some games. But then they kind of stopped doing that because people really didn't understand how to utilize that in certain ways,

19:05.000 --> 19:19.000
which is a bummer because you can very much tell that Zelda Breath of the Wild before they reframed it for Switch and not saying that it turned out bad at all. But you can tell that that game would have been an impressive use of the second screen with the whole slate and everything.

19:19.000 --> 19:25.000
You know, that it was it's very clear that was designed with the Wii U set up in mind. And after all, the game did come out on the Wii U.

19:25.000 --> 19:30.000
But I don't think it really like it didn't really end up using the feature the same way that it was probably originally designed.

19:30.000 --> 19:37.000
Yeah. So it's just it's kind of just a bummer that the Wii U didn't really find its rhythm until it was too late. And the third party's lack of support.

19:37.000 --> 19:43.000
Even like the stuff for like one to switch, like, oh, we're changing the way that you play games and stuff. And they do that a little bit with like Labo.

19:43.000 --> 19:51.000
But like I you know, I praise Labo a little bit after I purchased a couple of them.

19:51.000 --> 19:56.000
But I'm kind of taking that back because it's exactly what I thought it would be.

19:56.000 --> 20:02.000
It's something that I buy, I build it, and then I have all this crap that's sitting there that I never use.

20:02.000 --> 20:07.000
And it takes up a ton of space. I have been successful in that regard with Labo.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
I was very tempted by the VR one, though, I got to say.

20:10.000 --> 20:16.000
But it's once I heard that like the Zelda and the Mario stuff kind of ended up being like I was.

20:16.000 --> 20:20.000
Yeah, it's just OK with my decision. Yeah, it's just not worth it.

20:20.000 --> 20:30.000
It's it's it's a neat it's a neat prototype for something, but it's not like something that I would want to play on a regular basis.

20:30.000 --> 20:36.000
And like occasionally we'll we'll bring out the robot thing, but it's such a pain in the ass to get it working.

20:36.000 --> 20:40.000
And then just like even the VR stuff, it's just all over the place.

20:40.000 --> 20:47.000
I managed to shove some of it in like a drawer, but like it's still all over the goddamn place because it's so big.

20:47.000 --> 20:53.000
And they have like there is a section in that Labo where it's like, here's how you can store your stuff a little bit better.

20:53.000 --> 20:59.000
But it doesn't make it that much smaller because I did all that stuff and it's like, OK, this is really huge.

20:59.000 --> 21:04.000
I don't know. Maybe with just like that gun one, the thirty dollar one you can get with the goggles and the gun.

21:04.000 --> 21:09.000
Those are pretty much the more fun of the little mini games out there.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
So I don't know. Maybe stick with that one.

21:12.000 --> 21:19.000
Some other little specs we should mention about the Switch Lite. The Nintendo Switch Lite battery power is supposed to last between three to seven hours.

21:19.000 --> 21:24.000
That is about 30 minutes longer than the regular Switch. But I don't think that's whoopity shit.

21:24.000 --> 21:30.000
I mean, it's a smaller screen. Right. So whatever. It is a portable only system, which I think we've stressed enough here.

21:30.000 --> 21:36.000
The screen is five point five inches as opposed to six point two inches in the original.

21:36.000 --> 21:42.000
So you're losing about three quarters of an inch there if size is is big for you.

21:42.000 --> 21:47.000
And then the resolution, they say, is still 720p, just like the predecessor.

21:47.000 --> 21:53.000
But they are saying because it's a smaller screen, it's going to look a little better because, you know, it's a smaller screen.

21:53.000 --> 21:58.000
So whatever. And yeah, then you can get into some other specs as well.

21:58.000 --> 22:01.000
Like the D pad is going to be a little different. I say the D pad does look kind of nice, though.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
Look, I like the D pad better than like the little button thing.

22:03.000 --> 22:12.000
I fully anticipate someone taking that system and turning it into like a DS type clamshell thing, modding the crap out to make it even smaller.

22:12.000 --> 22:17.000
Yeah. But anyway, it's very obvious that this is timed for Pokemon.

22:17.000 --> 22:24.000
And that's very intentional is that there are going to be, despite all the controversy around the national decks and all that stuff.

22:24.000 --> 22:33.000
Like, I think the reality is, you know, kids and the biggest population of Pokemon players out there, maybe not the most vocal,

22:33.000 --> 22:38.000
but the biggest population of Pokemon players out there are going to turn a blind eye to the national decks thing.

22:38.000 --> 22:42.000
I think they even have a special Pokemon edition that's coming up.

22:42.000 --> 22:48.000
And I think most people, even if they are upset about the national decks thing, I kind of think they're going to still get it anyway.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
I don't think that's really going to stop people from buying the new Pokemon game.

22:51.000 --> 22:57.000
I mean, maybe in a few extreme circumstances, but I just think that game is still going to be selling.

22:57.000 --> 23:08.000
And again, this is a great way for if you have a kid or even a parent or somebody that's just been waiting for that game that they got to get the system for, then this is it.

23:08.000 --> 23:13.000
But one more thing I want to add here before we move on about the whole death of the 3DS.

23:14.000 --> 23:22.000
To be honest, you know, again, as frustrating as that is, you kind of should have seen it coming when they moved the Pokemon games to the Switch.

23:22.000 --> 23:28.000
That should have been your first indicator that the 3DS was, you know, tick tock, tick tock, right?

23:28.000 --> 23:31.000
So, but it's had, I mean, 3DS has an amazing run.

23:31.000 --> 23:37.000
I mean, honestly, probably best portable system ever that I can think of off the top of my head.

23:37.000 --> 23:44.000
I mean, you know, some could argue about some of the more like retro consoles and, you know, especially at the original Game Boy and what Tetris did for that and everything.

23:44.000 --> 23:53.000
But I think just the long life of the 3DS, the vast library of what most 3DS's can play between the regular 3DS games, the DS games.

23:53.000 --> 23:57.000
Can they play the advanced games? No, the original DS before they went to play.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
They can on the virtual console.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
Oh yeah, they can on the virtual console.

23:59.000 --> 24:04.000
So there's still, you know, there's just such a rich library and things that, you know, I think the 3DS will definitely be.

24:04.000 --> 24:19.000
I know, it's so amazing that a tiny little system like the 3DS can handle Super Nintendo games and yet this new console, the brand new console, like the Switch Lite, cannot fucking handle Super Nintendo games.

24:19.000 --> 24:27.000
Because that's why I assume it's not there yet and not because of some other greedy shit that they're doing to try to get people to pay for their online service or anything like that.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
I'm sure that's why.

24:29.000 --> 24:36.000
Now, you know, and depending, I'm looking at some of the comments in chat, DJ Rama S saying, I'll wait for my Switch Pro.

24:36.000 --> 24:40.000
And, you know, certainly depending on what kind of gamer you are, like I get that.

24:40.000 --> 24:45.000
Like, you know, if you kind of know that there's a Switch Pro on the horizon, then, you know, maybe you're kind of waiting for that.

24:45.000 --> 24:52.000
So, because I admit it is going to be a little bit frustrating to know that I'm probably going to end up buying that Switch Pro when I already dropped the money on the Switch.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.000
But I mean, I guess I've gotten a few good years out of the Switch at this point.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
Switch has been out for a good year and a half at this point now, right?

24:58.000 --> 25:02.000
A Raspberry Pi Zero, which is a $19 system, can play Super Nintendo games.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.000
Let it go.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
Let it go.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
And yet.

25:06.000 --> 25:11.000
Let's see, S2100Matt says, I'm also looking to upgrade to the Pro when those specs come out.

25:11.000 --> 25:20.000
Going back to the National Dex issue, Sia Tabiri says, one YouTuber I follow actually called for his followers to skip Sword and Shield over the whole National Dex thing.

25:20.000 --> 25:24.000
And for the fact that the Dynamax thing is just a limited gimmick or whatever.

25:24.000 --> 25:30.000
I make that guy show his bank account record because I bet he buys it anyway.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
Like, sorry, not sorry.

25:31.000 --> 25:35.000
Again, I'm not really trying to take sides on that whole thing.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
I understand why people are mad about it.

25:37.000 --> 25:43.000
Don't get me wrong, but I really feel like when it comes to push or shove or whatever, people are still going to buy the game.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
You know what I mean?

25:44.000 --> 25:50.000
I think we all know the inevitable conclusion to this is that in a future Pokémon game, this will be remedied.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
So, it is what it is.

25:54.000 --> 25:58.000
Let's see, YYR says, I wouldn't expect much from a Switch Pro.

25:58.000 --> 26:02.000
I mean, I wouldn't expect it to enhance existing games a la Xbox One.

26:02.000 --> 26:06.000
I would expect it to improve new games that were designed for it, like New 3DS.

26:06.000 --> 26:12.000
I just hope, unlike New 3DS, they don't start to split the market because I think that will be very bad.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.000
Now, we just said there weren't a lot of games for New 3DS.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.000
So, specifically for New 3DS, what?

26:17.000 --> 26:21.000
There was the Final Fantasy game and maybe like one or two others, right?

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
Not the Final Fantasy game, the Xenoblade game and like one or two others.

26:24.000 --> 26:29.000
I think the Hyrule Warriors played better on the New 3DS.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.000
Yeah, I think it was that.

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
And then Smash Brothers was definitely better, but it still played on the old 3DS.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
I'm sure we can look it up.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.000
It was a really small number of games.

26:38.000 --> 26:42.000
Also, just like the very small number of games that were on the...

26:42.000 --> 26:49.000
Actually, it was the 3DS where it used the second analog stick.

26:49.000 --> 26:57.000
Remember how on the older 3DSs it didn't have the second nub that they have on there?

26:57.000 --> 27:05.000
They had that solution that you would buy this giant thing that would attach to your 3DS to give you the second analog stick and stuff like that.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.000
There were only a handful of games that used that, too.

27:08.000 --> 27:12.000
So, before we move to the next topic, let's quickly poll everybody in here.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Are you going to get a Switch Lite, yes or no?

27:14.000 --> 27:16.000
So, I think I'm hearing you're a yes, right, Jamie?

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
I want to.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.000
You want to?

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
Just for Animal Crossing and such? Makes sense?

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Yeah, so I can have that on the go.

27:22.000 --> 27:28.000
I don't know if it'll happen because I do have a Switch that I didn't pay for, but we'll see.

27:28.000 --> 27:34.000
I'm going to say no, but it's one of those, not for me, but I think it's cool it exists and I think they're really good looking,

27:34.000 --> 27:38.000
but I can't really justify it for me when I have the regular Switch already.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.000
Loki?

27:39.000 --> 27:43.000
Probably not because I already have a Switch and most of my games are digital

27:43.000 --> 27:47.000
and Nintendo's not good about swapping that stuff around between systems.

27:47.000 --> 27:53.000
Plus, all of my saves are on one system, so say if we wanted to get some for the kids so that I can actually use my Switch.

27:53.000 --> 27:57.000
I was going to say, I'm surprised that the boys getting older isn't kind of way in yet, but maybe they're not quite there yet.

27:57.000 --> 28:05.000
No, they just got two DSs last year, so they don't need, they have a Switch, they don't play it very often anyways.

28:05.000 --> 28:15.000
Well, actually, no, I take it back. They were playing, they were playing some, no, my son was playing Animal Crossing on 3DS earlier this week.

28:15.000 --> 28:23.000
He was in my wife's town digging a bunch of holes. He dug so many holes in that town.

28:23.000 --> 28:29.000
And then he got stuck on an island and he didn't know how to get off the island.

28:29.000 --> 28:35.000
When the new one comes out, you're going to need to teach him how to visit Dark Sakura's town.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
Dig all the holes.

28:36.000 --> 28:37.000
Not invited.

28:38.000 --> 28:44.000
I imagine, and I seem to remember the last one that was online, you couldn't do that type of stuff if you were visiting other towns.

28:44.000 --> 28:47.000
They put blocks in there so that you couldn't screw up someone else's town that bad.

28:47.000 --> 28:51.000
Yeah, well I'll definitely get it, but I don't know. We'll see.

28:51.000 --> 28:57.000
Alright, well let's move on. Let's talk about, we know what Loki's kids have been playing, but how about the hosts?

28:57.000 --> 29:00.000
And how about you guys in our chat room at twitch.tv slash vog network?

29:00.000 --> 29:04.000
How was your gaming week, Dark Sakura? What kind of games have you been playing this week?

29:04.000 --> 29:08.000
I really buckled down with a lot of my pins lately, just playing some pinball.

29:08.000 --> 29:15.000
I'm also, I'm trying to get myself actually back into Twilight Zone because I'm really out of practice with it.

29:15.000 --> 29:20.000
But I've also been playing Animal Crossing Pocket Camp. I've been playing Idle Poring.

29:20.000 --> 29:25.000
I've been playing Pokemon Go. I've been playing the Harry Potter stupid game.

29:25.000 --> 29:35.000
I don't know, just not a whole lot. Dan and I are still talking about what, if eventually we're going to start streaming together with.

29:35.000 --> 29:45.000
And it's sort of leaning toward the Super Famicom Sega Densetsu 3 with one of the translated ROMs I have. So we'll see.

29:45.000 --> 29:48.000
Alright, moving on to Loki. How was your gaming week?

29:49.000 --> 29:58.000
It was pretty good. I played a little bit of Shakedown Miami. Hawaii. Shakedown Hawaii. I keep confusing that with Hotline Miami.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
Hotline Miami, yeah.

29:59.000 --> 30:06.000
Yes, Shakedown Hawaii. And I played a little bit of that because they have the new update that came out, so I was checking that out.

30:06.000 --> 30:15.000
And then, what else? Mainly just a little bit of Pokemon Go and I worked on my game a little bit.

30:15.000 --> 30:26.000
I was building a thing for the camera. A camera controller type thing. And then, what else? Yeah, that's about it.

30:26.000 --> 30:32.000
I just realized there's a typo in the little what's coming up next thing on Twitch.

30:32.000 --> 30:39.000
Because for those that haven't seen the Twitch feed, you're only listening on the podcast, we have a little like you might see on CNN or something a little ticker like what's coming up next.

30:39.000 --> 30:44.000
I just realized it says, how was you gaming week? Left an R off, my bad.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
How was you gaming week?

30:46.000 --> 30:56.000
How was you? How was you this week? Sorry about that. Sorry if your grammar is shaking right now, my bad.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.000
I'm trying not to pay attention to it.

30:57.000 --> 31:01.000
My bad. It was an innocent mistake. I know how it's really said. Alright, anyway.

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
Just be glad I didn't notice it.

31:03.000 --> 31:07.000
You should just do it all in Comic Sans week.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.000
No.

31:08.000 --> 31:14.000
Here's what I have to say about that. If you don't like it, you are welcome to do it for future weeks.

31:14.000 --> 31:19.000
But when I get stuck doing it, then you got to love me and my mistakes.

31:19.000 --> 31:24.000
I do want to like make some stuff and I just haven't gotten a chance to.

31:24.000 --> 31:29.000
There's a lot of people in chat that are like, I noticed. I noticed. And there's others that were like, I was just being polite.

31:29.000 --> 31:34.000
I also want to get a giant neon sign to go right here, but I don't know if it'll show up on camera.

31:34.000 --> 31:38.000
Yeah, the light will do funky things to that. I don't know.

31:38.000 --> 31:42.000
So anyway, the Spyro Jonathan says, I literally just died laughing. I only just noticed.

31:42.000 --> 31:48.000
Yeah, obviously I just noticed too, but I usually sit here and read what's on the TV, but that one jumped out at me. Anyway.

31:48.000 --> 31:52.000
Alright, so my gaming week. How was my gaming week?

31:52.000 --> 31:56.000
So I'm still doing the Survivor LARP. That is still going.

31:56.000 --> 32:00.000
And I believe it or not, you guys, I'm still in it. Can you believe it?

32:00.000 --> 32:03.000
You're in it to win it. They haven't voted you off yet.

32:03.000 --> 32:08.000
They have not voted me off yet. And we're down. It started with 22 people.

32:08.000 --> 32:13.000
And I think the girl that left last night was 16th. So we've got 15 people.

32:13.000 --> 32:19.000
I think if I did my math, we either have 16 people left now. No, we have 15 people left now. I can't even math.

32:19.000 --> 32:24.000
So seven people have left. And the point is, I haven't been one of them.

32:24.000 --> 32:28.000
So small victories, I guess, in that regard. But the people have been really great.

32:28.000 --> 32:33.000
I got to say, like just the various people I've been meeting from all over has been really cool.

32:33.000 --> 32:38.000
And that's like that's the whole reason to play this stuff. Otherwise, they can't talk much more about it because, you know,

32:38.000 --> 32:42.000
strategic and all that stuff because the other tribe might know that I do this thing.

32:42.000 --> 32:47.000
I don't know. So I can't talk a lot about like what's really going on. But, you know, well,

32:47.000 --> 32:52.000
I will talk all about it once it's done. I would actually love to have some of the other people that were that were in it,

32:52.000 --> 32:56.000
like come on the show and like talk about it because I think it would be really funny. I don't know.

32:56.000 --> 33:01.000
I think it's these these highly immersive games are really frickin interesting to me.

33:01.000 --> 33:12.000
Anyway, but in the video game world, I have been still able. Luckily, the the it's not like as much time playing that as I was like the first week it was going on.

33:12.000 --> 33:18.000
So I have been able to play some other video games. Most of my time, admittedly, has been on Final Fantasy 14 Shadowbringers,

33:18.000 --> 33:26.000
just because it's an MMO and there's a lot to explore. And I've got easily sunk in in the dozens of hours already.

33:26.000 --> 33:32.000
And I'm not even like halfway through. But the story is really good and I'm having a really good time with it.

33:32.000 --> 33:38.000
And I don't know if you guys know this, but if you go, you know, I don't know if you guys put a lot of stock in things like Metacritic and what have you,

33:38.000 --> 33:43.000
and the things that like kind of assess what all the ratings across the Internet are saying.

33:43.000 --> 33:50.000
But Final Fantasy Shadowbringers right now is one of the best reviewed games of the year, if you can believe it, which you don't always see for an MMO.

33:50.000 --> 33:59.000
So that's kind of interesting. But I think it also speaks to just like how like good the story is and the graphics and the character design and the sound and all that.

33:59.000 --> 34:05.000
So it's it's turning a lot of heads. And now people are getting interested in Final Fantasy 14, who may have not like noticed before.

34:05.000 --> 34:09.000
You know, especially when it comes to the monthly fee, which I know still puts a lot of people off.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.000
I think people are really into it.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.000
Yep. That's why I don't play it.

34:11.000 --> 34:18.000
One thing, though, and let me make this clear. I love 14 in its current state. I think it's a fantastic game.

34:18.000 --> 34:29.000
I do have to point out something, though, I think is a little troubling because I think something is being misrepresented by the media and it's very important by gaming media.

34:29.000 --> 34:38.000
And I think it's very important about this game, because one thing that I think got a lot of people interested in this expansion was if you do these endgame dungeons,

34:38.000 --> 34:46.000
you don't have to do them yourself. You have a party of like trust people that you can bring with you and you do these dungeons with your trust parties.

34:46.000 --> 34:52.000
And that is all still true. That part, like, is not different. And that is really changing the game for some people.

34:52.000 --> 34:59.000
Here's the problem, though. People are reporting on that and everybody's going, yay, I don't really have to play with other people.

34:59.000 --> 35:06.000
I can do these dungeons on my own. And while that is true, what they're not saying is that there are still primal battles.

35:06.000 --> 35:15.000
The eight people fights that are a part of the story. For instance, there is one, it's not a spoiler to say because they've talked about that this primal is in the game.

35:15.000 --> 35:24.000
Titania, who's been in Final Fantasy lore before, is the first big primal fight that you do at around level 74, about four levels in, maybe 73.

35:24.000 --> 35:30.000
73 or 74, four levels in. You can't do that fight with trust. You have to do it with other players.

35:30.000 --> 35:37.000
And where I've got to say, yikes, a little bit on the expansion, everybody getting excited, it's not an easy fight.

35:37.000 --> 35:41.000
It took us several tries to get through that fight with, like, people I know and all that.

35:41.000 --> 35:53.000
Now, will they do things later on to lessen the blow of that? Yes, they will introduce the echo thing where the more you die on it, the more powerful you get so that it helps you to clear it, but it's not in there right now.

35:53.000 --> 36:02.000
Although they are doing a mini patch on Monday, so I wouldn't be surprised if they're like, I'm saying this now and by the time a lot of you hear it, some of this is already going to be addressed.

36:02.000 --> 36:10.000
The difficulty of that fight is that they're going to put in the echo and they're going to probably reduce some of the health of the ads and things like that.

36:10.000 --> 36:20.000
But I think it's an important thing to point out because I would not want people to buy this thinking, oh, I don't have to worry about the anxiety or the pressure that comes with playing with other people

36:20.000 --> 36:28.000
or getting called bad by other people and all this stuff. And I understand, those are all legit concerns. You don't want to feel responsible for wasting other people's time in a dungeon, I get that.

36:28.000 --> 36:40.000
So I think it's fair to warn people, whereas yes, Final Fantasy is moving in that direction of being a multiplayer experience, but one that you can still do yourself.

36:40.000 --> 36:47.000
You cannot get through the entire story without other people as is being represented right now in a lot of the reviews.

36:47.000 --> 36:54.000
A lot of the reviews I don't think played to the Titania fight to find out, oh, whoops, you do have to play some of this with other people.

36:54.000 --> 37:01.000
So I wanted to call that out. I bet that's something that the developers will address later on at some point, I think.

37:01.000 --> 37:12.000
So anyway, Fifth Dream in chat says, even when I had the people in the Friendly Guild who helped me, I still felt that anxiety of not doing well, so I kind of stopped playing.

37:12.000 --> 37:19.000
And some people in chat are saying, shit, I didn't know that. I wanted to do the main story quest alone. Boo, I would have re-subbed.

37:19.000 --> 37:25.000
Yeah, and I'm sorry because I think Final Fantasy XIV is a great game and I do want to share it with a lot of people, but I think you have a right to know.

37:25.000 --> 37:35.000
You will not get through the story without playing with other people. It's only a couple of times, very short, but I have to say it.

37:35.000 --> 37:44.000
It is not accurately being represented in some of the early previews and stuff like that that are focusing on the trust thing, which is great, and it's a huge step forward of getting there.

37:44.000 --> 37:51.000
It's the typical gamer media mentality where it's like, oh, they only played it for a little bit.

37:51.000 --> 37:59.000
Or one person reported on that element of it, so everybody reported their whole story on just that element without considering the bigger picture.

37:59.000 --> 38:06.000
But I also don't want to shit on Shadowbringers either because it's a fucking fantastic expansion.

38:06.000 --> 38:12.000
And I'm like, if you're going to play any MMO, you need to play Final Fantasy XIV. It is the creme de la creme right now. It's amazing.

38:12.000 --> 38:15.000
I'm not talking shit on WoW by any means.

38:15.000 --> 38:19.000
I just wish I had time for it. That's the issue.

38:19.000 --> 38:30.000
If I had that much time, like say, someday when I'm retired and don't have to work and have all this time for gaming and stuff, then yes, an MMO would be right for me.

38:30.000 --> 38:37.000
But right now, I have hardly enough time for the games I have in my library, let alone time for an MMO.

38:37.000 --> 38:41.000
But I will say this much, one more thing I want to say about Final Fantasy, then I'll move on to the games.

38:42.000 --> 38:48.000
I'm only halfway through the story, so I can't really comment on this expansion story as a whole.

38:48.000 --> 38:54.000
But I'm hearing it gets even better in the final half and that apparently some big shit goes down and stuff.

38:54.000 --> 38:59.000
And most of my friends that have played through it are like, this is the best that it gets.

38:59.000 --> 39:04.000
This may very well be the best Final Fantasy story that has ever been told.

39:04.000 --> 39:17.000
And especially if you look at the critic scores and everything else out there, this is a distinct reality that we may be living in a time and a place where the best Final Fantasy story is in their MMO.

39:17.000 --> 39:26.000
So, kind of interesting. But I've said on prior shows, I kind of think Heaven's Word and Stormblood also had fantastic stories that most people missed out on.

39:26.000 --> 39:30.000
So I hope, I don't know what they can do to help more people experience this story.

39:30.000 --> 39:40.000
I think the trust system is kind of getting there. I think they took a big step with this expansion, and I expect that will be refined in some of the later patches.

39:40.000 --> 39:46.000
So maybe in six more months, people will be able to experience it more in single player.

39:46.000 --> 39:52.000
And I know it's so interesting, isn't it? It's a massively multiplayer game, but people want to play it single player.

39:52.000 --> 40:03.000
But I kind of get it. Sometimes other people are fucking mean, but you want to be able to say hi to your friends, and go visit your friends' houses, and see your friends' outfits, and things like that.

40:03.000 --> 40:07.000
But you still kind of want to do your own thing. I kind of get it. I do.

40:08.000 --> 40:17.000
All right. Bobby in chat says, I wanted to experience this great single player story. I soloed the story for Star Wars The Old Republic.

40:17.000 --> 40:26.000
And what little I did play of that game was pretty fun as well. So that's one of those games I need to go back to one of these days.

40:26.000 --> 40:29.000
That's back in BioWare's heyday, I suppose.

40:29.000 --> 40:33.000
So, anyway, other games I played this week, because there are a couple others.

40:33.000 --> 40:41.000
I also played, oh no, I forget the name of it, the racing game they were giving away for free on PlayStation Plus this month.

40:41.000 --> 40:47.000
The Hyper Turbo, so I played that for a little bit. It's a fun little arcade racer.

40:47.000 --> 40:56.000
My only little thing with it is that with the polygons and the way the graphics look, it kind of looks like a PlayStation 2 game that was kind of up rezzed for PlayStation 4.

40:56.000 --> 41:01.000
But I think it's super indie. And it is fun to play. At the end of the day, it's fun to play.

41:01.000 --> 41:06.000
But the graphics are a little basic for a racing game, in my opinion.

41:06.000 --> 41:12.000
But it's fast and it's fun to control and so forth. So, yeah, there's that.

41:12.000 --> 41:17.000
Thank you, Darktits2. I knew somebody would know it. Horizon Chase Turbo, that's the name of it. Thank you, thank you.

41:17.000 --> 41:23.000
Bobby Blackwolf says the graphics are basic. Yeah, I mean, I've played a lot of racing games that are amazing graphics.

41:23.000 --> 41:32.000
Like Forza, hello. Gran Turismo, F-Zero, hell. But the ones in this game are kind of, it looks like I'm playing Outrun.

41:32.000 --> 41:37.000
And Outrun's not a bad game. It's just a dated game at this point. Anyway.

41:37.000 --> 41:41.000
So that's about it for my gaming week. I think that's everything I'll mention.

41:41.000 --> 41:49.000
So we'll move on. A quick housekeeping note. We are live on Twitch tonight, of course, as we are every Sunday night.

41:49.000 --> 41:57.000
And Twitch has a little special promotion going on right now because Twitch belongs to Amazon and Amazon's got their big Prime Day coming up, right?

41:57.000 --> 42:04.000
So right now, and it's only tonight during Sunday's show, if you are kind enough to donate biddies to the show,

42:04.000 --> 42:13.000
which we use your biddies to get things like new mics, the flyers that Bobby was just able to hand out at this weekend's Southern Fried Game Room Expo,

42:13.000 --> 42:23.000
or excuse me, Gaming Expo. I always get the names of these up. The flyers that were handed out were designed by Dark Sakura and were paid for by your biddie donations and subscription stuff.

42:23.000 --> 42:29.000
So thank you very much. So thank you, thank you, thank you for everybody that helps that happen because that helps us get the word out for not just our own shows,

42:29.000 --> 42:34.000
but the other great shows on this network. Girls Gone Wow, you've probably seen, is also streaming Sunday during the day.

42:34.000 --> 42:38.000
That's been great. Anime Jam Session, of course, on Tuesday. And more and more and more.

42:38.000 --> 42:46.000
So anyway, you do need to specifically use the bleed purple emote, or excuse me, yeah, emote during your bit donation.

42:46.000 --> 42:57.000
But Twitch will do an extra 10% tonight only. So if you donate 100 biddies, you'll actually be donating 110 because Twitch will add 10% to the pot.

42:57.000 --> 43:06.000
But you have to use that bleed purple emote. I believe right now, if you click on the bits icon, it will show more detail on that right now.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.000
Please do it.

43:07.000 --> 43:08.000
Because I said so.

43:08.000 --> 43:13.000
Well, I don't want to beg for money, but I will say that it's appreciated.

43:13.000 --> 43:14.000
We're not begging.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
And it goes to good use.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
We're just telling you all what to do.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
Yeah. And of course,

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
Do the thing.

43:19.000 --> 43:27.000
If you are a Prime person, you get a free monthly subscription because you're paying for it with Prime that you can use on one Twitch channel every month.

43:27.000 --> 43:33.000
And if you decide to use it here at the Voice Geeks Network or VOG Network, you get access to the complete video archive.

43:34.000 --> 43:39.000
So you can access all the old shows on video and watch them that way if you desire.

43:39.000 --> 43:44.000
But of course, the audio, as it has been for 17 years, will still be free.

43:44.000 --> 43:46.000
That's not something we're going to be charging for.

43:46.000 --> 43:49.000
So we want you to still be able to enjoy what you've always enjoyed.

43:49.000 --> 43:54.000
We wanted to add something new for the paywall or whatever you want to say.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.000
Not take anything away.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
Very important.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
Anyway.

43:57.000 --> 44:00.000
S2100Matt says, give them money for pizza or cookies or other important things.

44:00.000 --> 44:03.000
I think it's safe to say we have not spent your money on food.

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
It definitely goes back into the show.

44:05.000 --> 44:09.000
And yeah, hopefully some exciting stuff coming up at Dragon Con, too.

44:09.000 --> 44:15.000
We'll have to kind of look at the finances, but we might be able to have another thing that we give away in person.

44:15.000 --> 44:18.000
I know in years past we had the little hacky sacks.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.000
The lanyards were a big thing last year.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.000
So maybe we'll have something new for this year.

44:22.000 --> 44:26.000
I don't want to promise, but it's not outside the realm of possibility.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
It's going to be a fun year.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
All right.

44:29.000 --> 44:35.000
Anyway, YYR in chat says, I totally do it, but would it look like I'm paying for advertising?

44:35.000 --> 44:38.000
You guys do endorse my games quite a bit.

44:38.000 --> 44:43.000
I don't think so because we already endorse them without any agreement of any sort.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
You know, you were looking for or fancy.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
You were looking for content for the break.

44:47.000 --> 44:52.000
And I did manage to catch one of YYR's.

44:52.000 --> 44:53.000
Excuse me.

44:53.000 --> 44:54.000
Like all that pizza.

44:54.000 --> 44:58.000
Anyways, I did catch one of his retrospectives that he did.

44:58.000 --> 45:01.000
See, these are things that you should tell me before we're live.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Because now I can't just throw it in there.

45:03.000 --> 45:06.000
But yeah, that would have been a great retrospective.

45:06.000 --> 45:09.000
Because he did one for Bungee Ferret tossing.

45:09.000 --> 45:10.000
Oh, that would have been fun.

45:10.000 --> 45:14.000
Well, when the new one comes out, because he's talked about the one on PC,

45:14.000 --> 45:18.000
I will do a little thing of that and put it during the break.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.000
And he doesn't have to give us a dime.

45:20.000 --> 45:26.000
We would do that just because we love the fact that somebody actually made a game out of a silly idea on this show.

45:26.000 --> 45:32.000
For the record, I'm also going to say, since people brought up food earlier, I did bring cookies that I baked myself.

45:32.000 --> 45:36.000
And they are rose chocolate and craisin cookies.

45:36.000 --> 45:41.000
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, I'm sorry, not Bobby Black Wolf.

45:41.000 --> 45:44.000
Other people in chat are saying, we need Smush to do something special.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
We need a Smush emote.

45:46.000 --> 45:49.000
Bobby says the Smush emote is for the Discord.

45:50.000 --> 45:54.000
The thing is, we would have to get in.

45:54.000 --> 45:57.000
So Smush doesn't photograph well because he's a black cat.

45:57.000 --> 46:00.000
So we would have to commission the artwork to be done.

46:00.000 --> 46:03.000
Which I'm willing to do and have that done.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
Oh, you're going to draw Mr. Smush?

46:05.000 --> 46:08.000
I could try. It's been a while. I've got enough references.

46:08.000 --> 46:10.000
I just sent you a picture of his sleepy ass.

46:10.000 --> 46:17.000
Well, even if you decide you don't want to do it, I'm sure we could commission somebody to do it for $20 or even $40.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
To do a small little emote of Mr. Smush.

46:19.000 --> 46:22.000
And maybe that's something we could put for a higher tier sub.

46:22.000 --> 46:25.000
Or when we unlock more sub slots.

46:25.000 --> 46:28.000
We may have one right now. I don't remember.

46:28.000 --> 46:30.000
But that might be something. I don't want to promise anything yet.

46:30.000 --> 46:35.000
Because we have to reach an agreement with Bobby Black Wolf on any of those types of decisions.

46:35.000 --> 46:40.000
But I think if you guys really want it, I'm sure we can make it happen.

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
Alright. Anyway.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
And thank you SHJ100Matt who says,

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
You've given me and plenty of us years of entertainment.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
The few bits we throw is the least we can do.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
Super appreciate that.

46:51.000 --> 46:54.000
I wish you could still get the bits from watching ads.

46:54.000 --> 46:55.000
You can.

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
Oh, you can on desktop too?

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
Yeah, except I have an ad blocker.

46:59.000 --> 47:02.000
But it says I can watch one for $5.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.000
Oh good. I'm glad those are back.

47:04.000 --> 47:08.000
Watching just a handful of ads and then throwing those bits this way.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
Or whoever.

47:10.000 --> 47:13.000
If you don't feel like you want to give us biddies.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
I'm not going to be upset.

47:15.000 --> 47:20.000
Go support some other streamer that does this out of the goodness of their heart and so forth.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
Watch a few ads.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
A little bit goes a long way and it adds up. Trust me.

47:24.000 --> 47:27.000
Even if you're only donating like 10 biddies to somebody.

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
It's still just that, oh, Senpai noticed me.

47:29.000 --> 47:32.000
It's just a nice thing to be noticed by your viewers.

47:32.000 --> 47:35.000
Okay, and then I think the mobile will let you watch ads too.

47:35.000 --> 47:36.000
That's always been there.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
Alright, anyway. Enough of that.

47:38.000 --> 47:41.000
Enough self-promotion about Twitch promotions.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
Let's get into some other gaming news.

47:43.000 --> 47:46.000
Let's make some more of those moments you guys like to be here for.

47:46.000 --> 47:49.000
With one that maybe we'll start a Loki rant.

47:49.000 --> 47:52.000
Let's see, Loki. It's a Nintendo story and it's one that kind of...

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
I don't know. I don't know, Loki.

47:54.000 --> 47:58.000
It's a feature that they've made so good for them.

47:58.000 --> 48:03.000
So if you're looking for more excitement in your Nintendo online collection.

48:03.000 --> 48:10.000
Well, you can at least be able to play now with rewind features that they have in NES games.

48:10.000 --> 48:15.000
So for example, if you hold these ZL and ZR buttons.

48:15.000 --> 48:19.000
You're able to scroll back in a timeline of snapshots of your gameplay.

48:19.000 --> 48:22.000
And pick anywhere you want to resume from.

48:22.000 --> 48:24.000
So that's kind of cool.

48:24.000 --> 48:30.000
And apparently that's going to be added to the Switch online NES app starting July 17th.

48:30.000 --> 48:33.000
Which is the same day they're going to be adding some new games.

48:33.000 --> 48:39.000
Donkey Kong 3 and Wrecking Crew.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
Yeah, Wrecking Crew is the other.

48:41.000 --> 48:44.000
No, Rob the Robot though, so that kind of sucks.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
Wrecking Crew wasn't a Rob the Robot game.

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
I thought it was.

48:47.000 --> 48:50.000
No, Gyro My Ex and Stackem were the Rob the Robot games.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
You're right, I'm thinking...

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
Wrecking Crew had a level editor.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
It did have a level editor.

48:56.000 --> 48:59.000
And it was referenced later on in Smash Brothers.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
I think a lot of people know the Wrecking Crew level in Smash Brothers.

49:01.000 --> 49:04.000
It kind of plays like the old Wrecking Crew game actually.

49:04.000 --> 49:07.000
Wrecking Crew is a nice historical choice, I guess.

49:07.000 --> 49:10.000
But I kind of think it's one of those games you play once and you're like,

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
Alright, I played it. That's it.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
You don't really play it a lot.

49:14.000 --> 49:16.000
Donkey Kong 3.

49:16.000 --> 49:21.000
I think that game is neat because it's so different.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
It's weird.

49:23.000 --> 49:29.000
Suddenly you play this character that doesn't exist anywhere else in Nintendo's timeline.

49:29.000 --> 49:33.000
You play that little peat, the pesticide or whatever.

49:33.000 --> 49:37.000
And Donkey Kong 3 is more like a shooter than it is a platformer.

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
That's what made it so weird, right?

49:39.000 --> 49:42.000
Because you're shooting the bug spray up Donkey Kong's ass.

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
That's what you're doing. Look at the game.

49:44.000 --> 49:47.000
To scare him out of the greenhouse or whatever.

49:47.000 --> 49:50.000
So it's just weird because that game is more like a shooter.

49:50.000 --> 49:54.000
And so it kind of got lost amongst Nintendo's history.

49:54.000 --> 49:57.000
But the reality is, when it comes to these NES releases,

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
if that's what we're getting this month, I'm sorry,

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
but they're starting to scrape the bottom of the barrel.

50:01.000 --> 50:05.000
Which is weird because they have a huge library of games out there.

50:05.000 --> 50:09.000
I don't understand why we can't just throw some money.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
I don't even know.

50:11.000 --> 50:14.000
I really wish they just sold these games online

50:14.000 --> 50:17.000
because then we'd have more of a library to choose from.

50:17.000 --> 50:20.000
You can have like, you get these free,

50:20.000 --> 50:23.000
but if you want additional games, you can purchase them.

50:23.000 --> 50:24.000
And they go into that.

50:24.000 --> 50:27.000
In a way, like I think what's happened now

50:27.000 --> 50:31.000
is that you have these publishers that are re-releasing their NES things

50:31.000 --> 50:32.000
as part of these collections.

50:32.000 --> 50:35.000
Like look at what Konami's doing, the Castlevania collection.

50:35.000 --> 50:38.000
Because they're forced to do that because they don't have any other options.

50:38.000 --> 50:42.000
That's why when there was these Capcom collections way back

50:42.000 --> 50:46.000
on the PlayStation stuff, they didn't have that on the Nintendo Wii,

50:46.000 --> 50:49.000
I think at that point, because they had Virtual Console stuff.

50:49.000 --> 50:52.000
So it didn't make any sense to release that on there

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
because you could just purchase them separately.

50:54.000 --> 50:56.000
OrangeRite in chat says,

50:56.000 --> 50:59.000
How many first-party games are still holding out, though?

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
And I think that's an excellent call-out. Not a lot.

51:01.000 --> 51:06.000
There's not a lot of first-party games that aren't on this service at this point.

51:06.000 --> 51:09.000
It's the third-party games where they...

51:09.000 --> 51:13.000
Well, they have some really bottom-of-the-barrel stuff like Pinball.

51:13.000 --> 51:16.000
Yeah, but we would be reading them just as hard

51:16.000 --> 51:18.000
if those were the types of things that they were releasing at this point.

51:18.000 --> 51:19.000
You know what I mean?

51:19.000 --> 51:24.000
I think a lot of us more than recognize it's time for Super Nintendo.

51:24.000 --> 51:26.000
It's time for more.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
I don't understand why we can't get third-party stuff in there

51:28.000 --> 51:30.000
because we have some Konami games, I think, in there.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.000
We do.

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
So, I mean...

51:33.000 --> 51:36.000
Something is clearly stopping them because we haven't had...

51:36.000 --> 51:40.000
I saw a list of some stuff that they were wishing they would have on the service.

51:40.000 --> 51:44.000
And one of them that was mentioned was Maniac Mansion, which would be amazing.

51:44.000 --> 51:48.000
Well, you know, I would fucking flip if they could get the Guardian Legend.

51:48.000 --> 51:52.000
But the problem is the rights to the Guardian Legend are so muddled at this point

51:52.000 --> 51:55.000
as well as some of these other old-school 8-bit games.

51:55.000 --> 51:59.000
I'm not surprised that they're just kind of not there.

51:59.000 --> 52:00.000
Yeah.

52:00.000 --> 52:03.000
But I think it is definitely time to start thinking about other systems,

52:03.000 --> 52:04.000
namely the Super Nintendo.

52:04.000 --> 52:07.000
And if they can swing it, why not Genesis?

52:07.000 --> 52:10.000
I mean, I guess Sega's got their own thing going on with their mini system,

52:10.000 --> 52:13.000
but at some point, why not include, like, the Nintendo Wii had?

52:13.000 --> 52:17.000
Some limited arcade stuff, although then you got arcade archives

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
is also screwing that whole thing up, right?

52:19.000 --> 52:20.000
Like, why would...

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
It's just not planned out very well.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
Yeah, I don't think they plan it out very well.

52:23.000 --> 52:24.000
I really don't.

52:24.000 --> 52:28.000
I think Nintendo is going to be cornered that they're going to have to do Super Nintendo.

52:28.000 --> 52:30.000
They really don't have any other choice.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
So I think that's coming.

52:32.000 --> 52:39.000
If it doesn't come by holiday, I think then we have to get really concerned.

52:39.000 --> 52:42.000
I think we're going to have a couple more rough months,

52:42.000 --> 52:46.000
and then, like, Super Nintendo is going to probably have to happen.

52:46.000 --> 52:48.000
But we'll see. I don't know.

52:49.000 --> 52:53.000
As far as the rewind and fast-forward thing, I mean, cool, I guess.

52:53.000 --> 52:57.000
Like, you know, especially in maybe some of the more difficult games,

52:57.000 --> 53:02.000
like ghosts and goblins and some of the ones that, you know, are really easy to die over and over in.

53:02.000 --> 53:03.000
Or really...

53:03.000 --> 53:04.000
It would be nice to have that too.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.000
Mario 3, you go to the Toad house and you're like,

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
ah, I didn't get what I wanted.

53:08.000 --> 53:10.000
Back it up. Oh, do it again.

53:10.000 --> 53:11.000
You sure could. You sure could.

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
So, how's that going to work if you're playing online?

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
Maybe that's disabled if you play online with somebody else.

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
Probably.

53:16.000 --> 53:19.000
Yeah. And I think maybe that's another place where this has felt very disappointing

53:19.000 --> 53:22.000
is that even though, you know, they have this whole, like, online setup

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
where you can play with other people,

53:24.000 --> 53:28.000
it doesn't feel like there's a lot of games that are worth playing online with other people.

53:28.000 --> 53:32.000
Like, it's still a lot of, like, single-player heavy experiences.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.000
And look, Donkey Kong 3.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.000
It's not one you can really play online.

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
Wrecking Crew.

53:37.000 --> 53:40.000
I don't even remember if that's a two-player simultaneous game.

53:40.000 --> 53:44.000
If it is, it's not going to be fun for long.

53:44.000 --> 53:48.000
So, God, I feel like if they could just open up Super Nintendo,

53:48.000 --> 53:50.000
we could get some more stuff that, you know,

53:50.000 --> 53:53.000
especially when you get into things like Super Mario Kart, the original and things,

53:53.000 --> 53:54.000
it would be a lot of fun to play online.

53:54.000 --> 53:55.000
Yeah.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
We'll see. We'll see.

53:57.000 --> 54:01.000
Anyway, YYR in chat says,

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
If you're going to rewind the Toad House,

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
I wonder if you have to do it before you enter.

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
No.

54:07.000 --> 54:08.000
Well, it depends which house.

54:08.000 --> 54:11.000
Like, if you're going to do the flip card, you might have to do it before you enter.

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
But I think you're thinking the slot machine, right?

54:13.000 --> 54:16.000
Oh, yeah. I mean, I don't think it necessarily matters

54:16.000 --> 54:18.000
because you look at...

54:18.000 --> 54:21.000
You can see in the screenshots where you're at.

54:21.000 --> 54:24.000
You can back it up. I think it's every few seconds.

54:24.000 --> 54:30.000
So, you probably could do it in a way where you can manipulate that.

54:30.000 --> 54:31.000
I'm sure they don't care.

54:31.000 --> 54:32.000
All right.

54:32.000 --> 54:34.000
Game Genie. Support the Game Genie.

54:34.000 --> 54:36.000
That would be kind of... Nintendo always hated that thing, though.

54:36.000 --> 54:41.000
I don't fucking care what they like or don't like.

54:41.000 --> 54:44.000
Moving on. I know what I like, and that is AR games

54:44.000 --> 54:47.000
because, you know, I love to play some Ingress

54:47.000 --> 54:50.000
as well as Harry Potter, Wizards Unite, Pokemon Go.

54:50.000 --> 54:52.000
I was like, you know, there was a big Entei thing tonight,

54:52.000 --> 54:54.000
and I couldn't even do it because of the show.

54:54.000 --> 54:57.000
And Community Day is next week during the show.

54:57.000 --> 55:00.000
I was right by one of those armored Mewtwos,

55:00.000 --> 55:02.000
and I looked at it, and I'm like, man, that looks dumb.

55:02.000 --> 55:05.000
I'm getting really...

55:05.000 --> 55:09.000
It's just making me not want to play anymore.

55:09.000 --> 55:12.000
I'm missing out on so much stuff that I'm just kind of like,

55:12.000 --> 55:16.000
I can just let this go for a while until maybe they introduce Gen 5 or something.

55:16.000 --> 55:19.000
I got to admit, I'm kind of into the Harry Potter, Wizards Unite

55:19.000 --> 55:24.000
because Allen got into it, and he was kind of fizzling out on Pokemon Go as well.

55:24.000 --> 55:28.000
But playing Wizards Unite gives us something both to do.

55:28.000 --> 55:33.000
And what's nice about Wizards Unite is that you don't have to wait for raids to spawn.

55:33.000 --> 55:37.000
You go find a fortress, and you can do it at the same time with your friend

55:37.000 --> 55:41.000
and play whenever you want. You don't have to wait for something to spawn.

55:41.000 --> 55:44.000
So the way they did that, I think the battling in Wizards Unite

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
is way more interesting than it is in Pokemon Go.

55:46.000 --> 55:49.000
That's where that game really starts to shine.

55:49.000 --> 55:54.000
So anyway, we were doing five player fortresses the other day with some of my Ingress buddies.

55:54.000 --> 55:57.000
It was a lot of fun. You just have to constantly communicate.

55:57.000 --> 56:00.000
I'm strong to the level 27. I'm going to take the 27.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
Can somebody put a shield on me? Can somebody heal?

56:02.000 --> 56:05.000
Drop a potion. You're constantly communicating while you're fighting on your phone

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
and drawing all the traces. It's pretty awesome.

56:07.000 --> 56:12.000
So anyway, I can't wait for Dragon Con to be able to play some...

56:12.000 --> 56:16.000
Bobby, find out if there's a fortress down at Dragon Con.

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
There's got to be. Of course, there's a fortress down there somewhere.

56:18.000 --> 56:22.000
Anyway, but since I love AR games, I'm going to have to give this one a shot too.

56:22.000 --> 56:25.000
This isn't Niantic, but I still think it's going to be really neat.

56:25.000 --> 56:30.000
It's Minecraft Earth. Minecraft Earth is soon to be on the way.

56:30.000 --> 56:36.000
It will be launching on iOS in the next two weeks, apparently, a beta release.

56:36.000 --> 56:41.000
So it's coming soon. The Android version will follow soon thereafter.

56:41.000 --> 56:44.000
And it's not totally uncommon that it hits one platform before the other.

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
I think that did happen with Pokemon Go.

56:46.000 --> 56:49.000
Ingress was Android only for a year before it was out on iOS.

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
Of course, Ingress was also a Google game.

56:51.000 --> 56:57.000
But anyway, I digress. So it will be out on iOS first, but it's not going to be a long wait.

56:57.000 --> 57:00.000
And they also showed a new trailer for Minecraft Earth.

57:00.000 --> 57:04.000
So it's interesting because you have that overworld view that looks very Minecraft-like,

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
that has pets and things you can tap on.

57:06.000 --> 57:09.000
But then it looks like there's another button you can do that will turn...

57:09.000 --> 57:14.000
And it shows these guys building a snow cavern on top of a picnic table.

57:14.000 --> 57:17.000
And it looked really cool. And I'm like, if that is...

57:17.000 --> 57:24.000
What I also thought was fascinating about it was that the guy's other phone was showing a little pickaxe.

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
It was showing the item that he was using.

57:26.000 --> 57:31.000
And I'm like, that has to be enhanced for a trailer. It can't look that good.

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Didn't you watch the developer's conference?

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
I didn't watch the whole thing, but...

57:35.000 --> 57:43.000
They announced the Minecraft Earth at the developer's conference in Cupertino.

57:43.000 --> 57:48.000
Not in Cupertino, but when they did the... talking about the AR stuff,

57:48.000 --> 57:53.000
they did the whole demo of building, of standing in your building and everything.

57:53.000 --> 57:57.000
Wow. If that really is what it ends up looking like, I'm going to be blown away.

57:57.000 --> 58:00.000
I'm really excited to try this out.

58:00.000 --> 58:03.000
I just feel like it's one of those things where in theory it's awesome,

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
and then in practice it's kind of derpy.

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
So we'll see how it works.

58:07.000 --> 58:10.000
But I know I signed up for that beta because I want to check this out.

58:10.000 --> 58:11.000
I'm sure you did too.

58:11.000 --> 58:15.000
And I'm sure now that it's on Dark Soccer's mind, she might think about signing up too.

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
But yeah, I'm excited to try it out.

58:17.000 --> 58:20.000
And if you haven't seen the trailer yet, it's definitely worth looking at.

58:20.000 --> 58:26.000
I... you know, for as much as I've always kind of been complaining,

58:26.000 --> 58:31.000
if Microsoft bought Minecraft, why have they yet to put out a Minecraft 2?

58:31.000 --> 58:36.000
Where's Minecraft 2? Why is that not a logical progression of what happens to Minecraft?

58:36.000 --> 58:41.000
But now that I'm looking at this, I'm like, oh, maybe this is the logical progression of Minecraft.

58:41.000 --> 58:48.000
This is why we don't have the ultra 4K HDR texture pack.

58:48.000 --> 58:54.000
And SHG100Matt says, a Microsoft product coming to an Apple product first, the times that we live in.

58:54.000 --> 59:00.000
Well, hey, you remember when Apple took on the Microsoft Office suite?

59:00.000 --> 59:04.000
And that was like, what a jaw dropping moment that was when Apple agreed to do that.

59:04.000 --> 59:07.000
And it kind of changed both companies for the better.

59:07.000 --> 59:13.000
So, you know, you ally with the enemy when it makes good business sense.

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
What had everybody talking just three weeks ago?

59:15.000 --> 59:19.000
Sony and Microsoft teaming up on the cloud technology thing.

59:19.000 --> 59:24.000
Does that mean The Last of Us 2 is going to be on Xbox? No.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
Halo is going to be on PS5? No.

59:26.000 --> 59:31.000
It just means that, you know, when it mutually benefits companies to work together, they're going to do it.

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
So, yeah, it's kind of just fascinating.

59:33.000 --> 59:40.000
But I get it. I get it. It's very much like when you first played a Sonic game on a Nintendo console.

59:40.000 --> 59:43.000
It's very that. It is very that.

59:43.000 --> 59:46.000
Yes. Oh, I like the way Questbuster puts that.

59:46.000 --> 59:50.000
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

59:50.000 --> 59:53.000
And who's the person to be in the AR space right now?

59:53.000 --> 59:56.000
Niantic or maybe Google, if you will.

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
I mean, because Niantic was a spin off of Google.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:03.000
It's really the one to beat is definitely Garfield Go.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.000
How's that? Well, some some of these other, you know, not I'm using my quoting finger,

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:11.000
knockoff games have done fairly well for themselves, like the Jurassic Park game.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:15.000
I think it's OK. Like, I think it's got a fan base.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000
They ran out of dinosaurs, so they had the spin off into other animals.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.000
And then The Walking Dead had one, too.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Yeah, I think has you know, I don't think it's as big as Pokemon Go yet, but it's got it's got its fans, you know, and they kind of do their thing.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:32.000
So anyway, I am excited about Minecraft Earth.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Please don't let me down. That's all I have to say.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000
I also see the potential to get extremely let down. All right. Moving on.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Dark Sakura, I like this. You got kind of a different sort of topic for us tonight.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000
I've been trying to make that a theme lately, at least find something that shows the other side of gaming.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Well, especially in these slower news months, there's other things about gaming we can talk about, you know.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Well, there was a study that was published in the journal Dreaming that said that games that promote more activities,

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:06.000
certain basically certain types of games will lead you into being a more lucid dreamer.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:11.000
So basically, if you play an active role in your game, like a virtual, you know,

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:17.000
like something they specifically mentioned, Connect and on the Wii,

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:23.000
that those games that require activity to play them, I guess do something with your brain,

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.000
but it makes you a little bit more of a lucid dreamer.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:31.000
And what lucid dreaming is, is basically it gives you the ability to dream and know you're dreaming

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:39.000
and to control your dreams in more, you know, in-depth, like the better of a lucid dreamer you are,

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.000
the better you can control it. For the most part, I'm a lucid dreamer.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:47.000
I've always been since I was a kid, but it's come in handy.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:56.000
If one has, you know, nightmares, they try to teach lucid dreaming techniques to like PTSD sufferers,

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.000
you know, because nightmares kind of go hand in hand with PTSD.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:10.000
But they were finding this is just preliminary evidence that physically interactive games are more likely associated with lucid dreaming,

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:18.000
but they're going to need more research. So they're actually starting to, you know, branch out with that study.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:26.000
It was a cross-sectional study, so it does not show any direct cause and effect, but they've had that correlation lined up.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.000
So we'll see. Hopefully they'll pursue a lot more with it.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:38.000
And they're saying basically the study shouldn't be taken as prescriptive, but that basis does show a direct correlation,

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
and it can be used in therapy.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:45.000
I gotta be honest, it's kind of a foreign concept to me because I am the opposite.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:51.000
I don't remember my dreams, and I haven't really tried to like look into this or thought much about it,

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:56.000
but I think there is like a segment of the population that just doesn't like they don't they don't dream.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
It depends. Yeah.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Yeah. I mean, like I just just I mean, I'm not going to say like never ever,

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:08.000
because I do know that like there will be once in a great while, like I distinctly remember I must have been falling or something in a dream

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.000
because I remember waking up going like I just like hit the ground and that's like when I woke up.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:19.000
But like that type of experience is like once every year, once every six months. It is not common.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:24.000
It is by far more common for me to wake up and that's that's it.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Usually, usually by the time I figure out that I would be lucid dreaming is about the time that I lose it.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:35.000
It's it's like usually have control for about like a few seconds or at least it feels like a few seconds.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:40.000
And it's it's too late. It's like it's like, oh, yeah, I'm dreaming up and I'm up.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:48.000
I've always been able to control it. Like it's only when I'm really like in a really bad mental state

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.000
that it's like I know I'm dreaming and don't give a shit. I just want to see where it goes.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:57.000
And it's more like I don't have the will to control it, although I still know I'm dreaming.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:02.000
But I don't think I'd want that. Like for me, like I just I don't know if I'd want that.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000
I, I don't know my perceptions and your perceptions just based on.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:12.000
I honestly don't know if it has something to do with being autistic as well, because our neurochemistry is different.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.000
But I also feel well, OK. Yeah. Maybe when you get into lucid dreaming, maybe.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.000
I mean, I don't know. But like, I feel like more people remember their dreams and talk about dreams.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:23.000
There's dream journals and things like that than people like me who have nothing to talk about.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Like also for me, I dream in color. And it's actually I believe I mean, it's almost 50 50.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.000
But there's a good portion of society that dreams in black and white. And I dream in color.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:42.000
I've heard that. Let me read you the last statement on this. And this comes from the authors of the study.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:55.000
We believe immersion in realistic, controllable virtual environments such as video games is a powerful psychological state that warrants a lot more study, particularly in its overlaps of the characteristics of dream states.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:05.000
And so basically, yeah, they're considering using this study to lead into more study to learn how to do dream therapy.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:10.000
So pretty cool. Video games lead to that. Yeah. Kind of neat.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:17.000
So if you want to be more in control of your dreams, you got to play more Beat Saber or DDR or something.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Although it's some, you know, YYR is in our chat room saying my DDR days haven't ended, but I haven't noticed anything.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:28.000
And I don't think this is like they say, it's not prescriptive. So it's still something that they're studying.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:32.000
But it is just neat that there could be a correlation there. Right. Right.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:37.000
It's just like we always would tell our parents. Video games help me because it improves my hand-eye coordination.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:41.000
You know, even though we all know that's a line at the same time, it's actually it's also kind of true.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Like, you know, it does help with some of your reaction times and things like that.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.000
It can improve those types of like, you know, motor skills, things like that, too.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:52.000
So I was doing a little bit of double checking.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:06:02.000
And they do say that people actually that people on the autism spectrum do have a little bit more experience in lucid dreaming.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Interesting.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Forty four percent out of the study said that they usually remember their dreams and a good number say they are lucid dreamers.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Huh. So, yeah.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Yeah. Neurochemistry. Science. A little bit of science on this.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:23.000
We see grown men sticking screwdrivers into things and adjusting them.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
So that was MST3K.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.000
I like it. All right. Well, let's move on. We have some other stories going on around the gaming world.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Loki. G2A. You got to love them.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Actually, you know, you don't know, you know, you don't have to love them at all.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:42.000
They're they're scum. So G2A, if you're not aware, is a third party key seller for various things.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:48.000
So for many, it's a haven for stolen keys.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:56.000
In fact, I believe last week there was developers coming out saying, hey, we would rather you pirate our game than actually purchase a key from G2A.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000
I remember that. That was pretty pretty damning.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:10.000
And so G2A, of course, is saying they're going about it in a really strange way of trying to help their reputation by this.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Of course, it's totally going to work out for that reputation.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:25.000
They are they are trying to help their reputation by what reputation for providing some completely unbiased articles.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Articles about G2A.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:44.000
So, for example, they have sent requests to several different gaming outlets saying to the effective, we have a written unbiased article about how selling stolen keys on gaming marketplaces is pretty much impossible.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:50.000
And we want you to publish it on your website without being marked as sponsored or marked as associated with G2A.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:58.000
It's it's a transparent and just review of the problem of the stolen keys reselling.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Like, I'm sorry, that's pretty fucking shady right there. Like, yes, of course, it's going to be unbiased coming from the site that it's criticizing.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Right. Yeah. So it just goes to show you they suck and they're just going to continue to suck.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:21.000
I guess and I guess I can probably talk about this. Bobby and Bobby's even saying we did not get this request at VOG, Frown Face.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:25.000
But we do. Bobby, you know, this we get these random emails and the contact us thing all the time.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:29.000
That's like we have an article we'd like to publish about such and such and such.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000
And Bobby and I just pretty much send those directly to the trash because we're just not interested.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Like, you know, we would we would rather just not make money or just rely on the generosity of those who are participating on Twitch and podcasts and stuff.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:51.000
Because, like, I don't want that trash on our site. And but it does go to show that some sites you visit may not have those same type of standards.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Now, of course, you're supposed to print some big, you know, promotional piece or something like that.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:03.000
But there's a lot of like even on sites like CNN and sites, you know, are in all of them.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Not just, you know, however you feel about lefty news or righty news, MSNBC, Fox News, you name it, all the same.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:15.000
You go on their website and you scroll down to the bottom and it's also like additional articles suggested by Traffic Brain or something like that.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:20.000
And they're all these like garbage articles that are oftentimes promotional spots.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.000
It'll be things like because it's the same stuff that I hear on.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:32.000
It's the same people that I will hear advertising on podcasts like why bleep mattress company provides the best sleep at night or something like that.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Or how you can get a bunch of good night's sleep on a bleep mattress or something like that.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Or, you know, bleep new underwear has this fantastic design that you have to believe.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:48.000
I would do that, but I'd do it in a total monotone.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:54.000
This mattress really helped my back problems. I sound like what's his name?

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Stein. Why can't I think of his first name? Ben Stein. Wow.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Why we are in chat says and all of these recommended articles will have these young, attractive people pictured as a way of attracting clicks or it's the opposite.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:14.000
You'll see some like horrendous looking like, like person that's bust out a bridge troll or something.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:21.000
And it says you won't believe what these child stars look like now. And I think they should just bust out a bridge troll to read it.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Yeah. Anyway, so there's we all know there's a lot of garbage on the Internet.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Y'all are educated enough to know that. And the best ones are those articles are all like slide shows or whatever.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000
So like every single page is only going to have like one person on it.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Yeah. They keep clicking through and they have ads in between everything and then ads on the other pages.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Yeah. Let me ask you soon if he says that you do it in a Miss Vangie voice, but my voice does not get that hard.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:47.000
You want to know what those child celebrities look like now?

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:51.000
Bam, bam. Yeah. All right, Emeril.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:55.000
That number 10 could get these cookies. All right. Anyway, I'm thinking of cookies.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:01.000
My cookies are amazing. Anyway. Oh, I'd like to say real quick.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:15.000
So G2A, of course, responded to this. These emails were sent by our employee without authorization for which we apologize to the outlets that he sent the proposal to.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:21.000
He will fake face strict consequences as this is an absolute absolutely unacceptable.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Sure, you will. Mm hmm.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Metal mayhem in chat says not to sound like I'm self-promoting, but I'm the same way when I post in the one steam group.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:33.000
I don't post about deals and freebies on shady sites. I don't think you're self-promoting.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:42.000
I mean, if we know a good free game deal going on, we usually like we usually update you guys on the PlayStation Plus and Xbox of like, you know, the legit stuff.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Yeah. We want people to know because I was going to play any PlayStation key sale.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:51.000
I didn't realize that the Epic Game Store went to weekly releases for free games as opposed to every other week.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:55.000
And now I've missed two games. So I wish I'd had that memo. You know what I mean?

01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:04.000
So like, you know, you've got to grab things before you lose them. But yeah, I wouldn't want to trust like shady websites or you can not look and save your money.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:09.000
But if they're free or you can save your time. Yes, I could save my time.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:15.000
But, you know, look, look at the other ways I choose to spend my time, Dark Sakura.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:22.000
We already know what you're on. We already talked about the subjecting myself to the intensity and mental trauma of playing survivor without a one million dollar prize.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:32.000
So look at the look at my life. Look at my choices. Anyway, what else did I want to mention in our chat?

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Let's see.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:46.000
I think people are just like making fun of other articles. Questmaster says, I do have the epic game launcher, but just for this free Slime Rancher, I do want to ask about this.

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:53.000
And this is kind of like going out of like left field. But I think it's important when we talk about these types of like click bait articles and things like that.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Is that something they teach kids about now? And I guess I'm looking at you because you've got to get they don't teach kids about how to tell what is a spam garbage email versus a legit email.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Maybe they do. And like later on in like certain technology classes, it's a little young for that. They don't do that now.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:16.000
Let's see. What was my son learning about today? Thanks to YouTube. Oh, gold diggers.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:24.000
He was learning about gold diggers because apparently some stupid YouTuber that he was watching was talking about some gold diggers club in Roblox and how this woman was a gold digger.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:33.000
And I was like, what the fuck are you listening to? I mean, like, I ain't saying she's a gold digger. I hope you asked it just like that, too.

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:38.000
No, I'm like, I'm like, what are you listening to? And then he got embarrassed.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:43.000
OK, run, jump, stop actually answers my question in chat. When in doubt, if nobody here knows it, usually somebody in chat knows it.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Thank you. Run, jump, stop says they do in high school history classes at the school I teach at.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:14:01.000
So it's like a high school level type of thing. Well, that's that's probably for the best, you know, because I was like, how do people start to learn to distinguish like what's a commercial versus what spam and what's real and stuff?

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:08.000
You know, anyway, it's just an interesting part about living in the year twenty nineteen in our very tapped in online world.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:14.000
Siatabiri says information literacy was an important point they pushed back when I was in library school. Interesting.

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:19.000
So and YY says, I was just thinking about this. We have a 14 year old intern in my I.T. department now.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:26.000
And he said they don't currently teach anything about phishing, identity theft, scams or any of that in high school or at least in high school.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Yeah, that's the phishing and how to identify websites that are trying to get password. That's an important skill to know.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:36.000
Right. There should be like a class just called adulting adulting 101.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:40.000
I'm serious. Well, you know, they don't put 101 in high school, Rob.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:45.000
But you know what? Back in the day, some of that they used to call home economics.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Right. And I know back in the day day it was a class that was mostly aimed at the girls, although by the time I was in high school, it was a boys and girls class.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.000
And you would learn basic like here's how to cook and fend for yourself.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:01.000
Like I kind of think like knowing how to not get phished your bank account information online.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:05.000
That's like that's the home economics we need in 2019. Yeah. No matter what.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:09.000
No matter what your gender is or whatever is expected of you.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:13.000
You know, you need to know all these basics about how to stay safe in an online world.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:19.000
So anyway, that should really be like a required class versus like a second language.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:27.000
I get it. Second language is good to learn. But being able to survive in the world is probably a little bit more useful.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Being able to speak a technical language is still exactly. Although I don't know.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.000
I don't know. I still see that should be counted as a link. The second language.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:39.000
I still see some of the benefit. I don't know. We're starting to get new topic this way outside video games.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:47.000
But I can see some of the benefits still in learning a more classic language like, you know, Spanish or French or, you know, Japanese if your school offers it or whatever.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:54.000
So anyway. All right. Well, let's move on. We better get back to games because we could go on tangent train all night long.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Let's talk about let's talk about the other thing that people need to learn how to do.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:04.000
That is not cheat or report cheaters or identify cheaters. And, you know, Blizzard's got this huge game.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:09.000
Overwatch like the Overwatch finals third stage were just today. Right.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:15.000
And I heard the Shanghai Dragons won, which is because Shanghai Dragons was the team that was like they didn't have a single frickin win.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.000
And now they're kind of like the comeback kids. So that's really cool.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:25.000
And Shanghai Dragons is the team that I believe is still the lone female in the Overwatch League is on the Shanghai Dragons.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:32.000
But they won. So yay for them. But anyway, Overwatch is obviously still huge.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:37.000
I haven't played it as much as I used to, but I understand it's practically a sport at this point.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
And a lot of people are still super into it.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:48.000
And so, unfortunately, where there's a lot of people and where there is, you know, pro level gaming and potentially even money to be made, you got cheaters that are out there.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Well, in a recent developer update, the game director for Overwatch, Jeff Kaplan, said Blizzard is looking at automatically shutting down matches when it detects cheating.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Now, we don't know all the details yet. And that makes sense because usually you don't want to reveal all the details because then the like robots and the things that, you know, help the cheaters cheat, try to get around that and get ahead of that.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:14.000
So they're not kind of playing all their cards on how they're going to do this.

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:20.000
But it just says that only the cheater will face very harsh actions.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:29.000
You, the non-cheater, will not lose your SR points from a competitive match just because someone joined it wanting to fuck with it and your match gets aborted.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:35.000
So it's kind of interesting. He also mentioned this feature is now live on public test realm servers.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
So they're already kind of looking into it.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:45.000
And again, we don't know exactly what they're doing because obviously if they were to say what they're doing to detect it, then that would just help the cheaters cheat.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:53.000
So we'll see. But the concept of stopping the match completely because someone is cheating, that's kind of the new thing here.

01:17:53.000 --> 01:18:01.000
What do you think about that? Like, as opposed to like letting it play out or whatever, just stop. The match is done because somebody is cheating.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.000
I think it's good.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Yeah. I think it might be very frustrating for some of the other people in it that aren't cheating, but at least their records aren't being impacted or whatever.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
And you kind of know it's being dealt with, I guess.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:17.000
But I also kind of think the cheaters are still going to find a way around it, but I think it's kind of interesting.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Or do that to like fuck with matches.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Yeah.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:25.000
YYR says, wait, shutting down the entire match or just kicking the cheaters?

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:33.000
No, it's shutting down the entire match, but only punishing the cheater and not impacting anyone else's score.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:40.000
But like, wouldn't that lead to these weird situations where like your team is losing horrifically so somebody cheats on the team and takes a bullet for everybody else?

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:45.000
But I guess, I guess that would be silly because you might end up getting banned and that's not a bullet worth taking probably.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000
I guess, yeah.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.000
Yeah. Anyway, it's interesting. I just kind of interested to see like where that ends up.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:58.000
I'm curious to see when this starts happening on Twitch and you get some, you know, because lots of people play Overwatch here on Twitch, right?

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:03.000
So I'm kind of curious to see what's going to happen when some of these like pro level streamers are playing a game, they're streaming it, and then all of a sudden,

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:08.000
book kill switch gets activated, kind of like what the reactions are going to be, what that's going to do.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.000
I'm curious to see what that's, what's going to happen there.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
So more to come on this.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Again, it's in the public test room right now, but yet to hit the live servers.

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:23.000
Who knows if they're even going to say when it hits the live servers, but I guess people will start noticing when their matches just all of a sudden quit.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Right.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
Anyway, Dark Sakura.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:35.000
Well, there is going to be a glorious thing happening tomorrow, which is Monday the 15th on Amazon Prime Day.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:42.000
It is the day that preorders for the Turbo Graphics Classic or whatever they're calling it.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:52.000
The Turbo Graphics 16 Mini is going to go on preorder or order or sale or whatever the fuck they're calling it, presale.

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Advanced purchase.

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.000
Advanced purchase. Thank you.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:59.000
It will be released on March 19th, 2020.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
But here's what's what's really neat about it.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:05.000
By the way, the Japanese version is going to be 10,500 yen, so about 100 bucks.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:08.000
They haven't done a U.S. price on it yet.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:17.000
But this is the fun thing is that it's coming with 24 American versions of games and 26 Japanese versions.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:21.000
They are going to have both the U.S. and Japanese versions of Utopia.

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:26.000
So not yet 50 games, really, because two of them, well, four of them are going to be the same.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Sorry, two of them are going to be the same.

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
It's going to be both versions of Utopia.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:35.000
But among the ones that we're going to freakin get, and here's Jamie being happy.

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:39.000
We are going to be getting, of course, R-Type because Jamie loves R-Type.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:44.000
It's going to have a Sapphire, which I've covered as a classic game.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:50.000
One of those really awesome shooters.

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:56.000
It's going to have Parasol Stars and Cadash on it, which were working designs games.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Snatcher is going to be on it, but it's the Japanese version.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
Rondo of Blood is going to be on it.

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
You know, I'm happy, you know, there's Space Harrier.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
There's Cho Aniki.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.000
That's awesome.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Yeah.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Daimakaimura, which is one of the super graphics games, Ghouls and Ghosts.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000
But it's a super graphics game.

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Ninja Gaiden, or as that one was, Ninja Ryukenden.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:23.000
PC Genjin, which was Bonk, Salamander.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:29.000
I mean, Super Darius, Super Star Soldier, Ys I and II.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:33.000
I mean, I'm just beside myself.

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:40.000
I got to say, I was not expecting the list to go this deep and be this good.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:43.000
All dines will be on there, which is another super graphics game.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:47.000
The fact that they're including Japanese stuff that we never even got here.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Gradius II.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.000
That's awesome.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Yeah.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:54.000
We didn't get Gradius II until that Gradius pack came out later.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:59.000
I feel like more of these will sell than actual Turbo Graphics 16s did in America.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
Maybe.

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:05.000
It also looks like they're having both versions of Ys Book 1 and 2.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:09.000
But it is the US version of Parasol Stars.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
Yeah, that's awesome.

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:18.000
J.J. and Jeff, Kaddash, Bonk's Adventure, Bomberman 93, Blazing Lasers, Alien Crush.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:22.000
Oh, those Crush games are so... Is Devil's Crush there too, or just Alien?

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
I don't see Devil's Crush on here.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.000
R-Type.

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:29.000
YYR points out the Turbo Graphics 16 mini is an Amazon exclusive.

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Yeah.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Worth pointing out.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.000
So it's the only way to get it.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:36.000
And we'll see what happens.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
I think I'm going to do it.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
So I might stay up until midnight.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Oh yeah, just so you can get... Is it going to be midnight Eastern though?

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.000
I don't know.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.000
I don't know.

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.000
Well, I'll be checking... Yeah, I'll be checking in two hours.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
Yeah.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
I think I might get one too.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:56.000
The game selection is too fucking good on this thing.

01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:02.000
And there's some real... Just as a retro gaming fan, how rare some of these games are.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.000
That Castlevania game you paid...

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.000
A hundred bones.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.000
Yeah, like an exchange thing.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:09.000
Someone paid me back.

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Yeah.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
They owed us a hundred bucks and came back with Dracula X.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Yeah, so that game has been worth a lot historically for collectors.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
So it's kind of neat.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
Bobby Blackwolf says, I'm going to get it.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
DJ Rama S says, I'm already planning on getting this.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
SJ100Matt, I'm considering this.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:27.000
All those comments from our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:30.000
So you better believe I'm going to be hanging out over here until nine o'clock.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.000
Just to make sure. I understand.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
I'm probably going to be right there with you honestly.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
You don't have to pay the entire hundred up front though, right?

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.000
You just have to...

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
I don't know. It doesn't say.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
Usually on Amazon you don't pay until it ships.

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Yeah, so...

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.000
And now run, jump, stop and our chat is like, damn it, now I want it.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
It's contagious, isn't it?

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.000
Loki, you in?

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:51.000
I don't know.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Turbo Graphics Club, you in?

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.000
I do have quite a bit of credit in...

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
This is on the Japanese site though that it's showing this.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:00.000
I have quite a bit of credit in Amazon right now, so...

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.000
Yeah, actually I got a gift certificate for like a belated birthday present.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.000
So yeah, I might...

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Yeah, I got something through my work.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Put it towards that, yeah.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.000
All right, anyway.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Let's move on.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
A few more stories for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.000
Loki.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.000
Let's talk about movies and video game movies.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.000
Woo.

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:22.000
Now you know this is going to be good because it's a Space Invaders movie.

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
So New Line Cinemas...

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Is it going to be good, Loki?

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:29.000
I say that with great sarcasm.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:33.000
So apparently they're going to try to make a Space Invaders movie.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:39.000
And currently the script is being written by Greg Russo.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:45.000
And who has also written, I guess, the Mortal Kombat reboot.

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.000
I don't know.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:50.000
I don't know what the plot's going to be.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
Does it really matter?

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Because it'll come out eventually and either it'll be like absolute shit, like pixels,

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:02.000
or it may be decent.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Or it could be like so bad it's actually kind of good like Independence Day.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:08.000
That's a sci-fi movie.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:09.000
I want it to be like a sci-fi...

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Or like Sharknado.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Like Sharknado.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.000
Okay.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Yeah, I'm with that.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:16.000
I want my Space Invaders movie to be so bad it's kind of good.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.000
Yes.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.000
I'm down.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:19.000
I'm with it.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
Tara Reid to star in, please.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:26.000
A movie that will probably be pretty good is actually the Mortal Kombat reboot.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:30.000
And they have confirmed, also Greg Russo had confirmed that,

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:36.000
yes, it is going to be rated R, and yes, there's even going to be fatalities.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:42.000
You're going to be there day one because I know how much you love those fatalities.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.000
Well, I mean, the old Mortal Kombat movie had fatalities,

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.000
but they were the more like the same fatalities you would see on Super Nintendo.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Like I remember the one guy got turned to ice and then shattered into a million pieces.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:53.000
Oh, I can't wait.

01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:56.000
Yeah, like that was the Super Nintendo fatality, too.

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
I'd probably go see it just for that.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:01.000
And then doesn't Shang Tsung like take the soul out of somebody, too?

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000
But those are all very...

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:06.000
I want to see the friendships and the fatalities.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Like I think they should have all that.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
Yeah, so I don't know.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
I mean, if it looks like it's really good, I guess,

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:17.000
but I'm going to have to hear how gory it is.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Because if it's like on the level of these like new Mortal Kombat games

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.000
that are just like too much, I might just need...

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:26.000
I may need to just watch it at home and have somebody tell me, look away.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.000
OK.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.000
All right, you can look again.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000
Like I'm just going to need to watch it that way. Look away.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
I need to see how bad it's going to be.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:41.000
Pod Culture is asking, will the PG-13 version cut swap out the blood for sweat?

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000
Well, if the movie does well enough, anything's possible.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
They did a PG-13 version of Deadpool.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Yeah, that's because that's because they wanted to, you know, get...

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000
They wanted more money.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Well, yes, that's that's why the studios do these things is to get more money.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:58.000
So I'm just saying Mortal Kombat may have a sweat version as well, I guess.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:01.000
Anyway.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:02.000
All right.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Moving on.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:09.000
Tigerclaw in chat says, James Wan, who directed Aquaman, previously did the Saw movies.

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000
Also, they cast Sub-Zero.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.000
Yeah, that's true. They had a Sub-Zero already cast.

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
I was seeing an article on that.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
But, you know, you know, the guys...

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.000
Just because you directed Saw doesn't mean like I have something against you or something.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
I just don't care for those movies.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:26.000
But, I think he did Saw 3 and 4.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
I like the Saw movies.

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
I just don't remember where I left off.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
So I don't know what to start over.

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
You know, there's like a new Saw movie.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.000
They're rebooting it.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Chris Rock and Samuel L. Jackson.

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
They're both confirmed they're in it.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
Chris Rock is the star of the new Saw movie.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.000
I need to see that.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
I don't associate him with scary movies.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
But maybe he's trying to reinvent himself. I don't know.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
But anyway, I didn't want to talk about...

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:53.000
Well, Saw 3 and 4, the director of those was the guy that did Repo, the genetic opera.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Which is also... It's a little violent.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000
But it's one of those movies that kind of grew on me.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:01.000
Just because the music is really good.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:06.000
And it's Anthony Stewart Head and Sarah Brightman in a movie with Paris Hilton.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Is Sarah Brightman not sounding terrible?

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:12.000
Paris Hilton in a role that actually makes a lot of sense for Paris Hilton.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
Yeah, Repo, the genetic opera is...

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
It took a couple of watches.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
But then I was like...

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.000
I get why people really love this movie.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000
And then the whole cult thing.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:27.000
I've been to the Rocky Horror style performances that are really astonishing.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:31.000
And I hear another one's coming soon. We'll see.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:34.000
Anyway, moving on.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.000
Tigerclaw says the actor that they got is someone who is in the raid.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:44.000
Dark Tetsuya says I wonder if the gore will be in line with Mortal Kombat 9, 10, 11 in that case.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.000
I would anticipate probably it's going to be more along the lines of the reboot.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.000
So that's why I kind of want to just... No more detail.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
Alright. Anyway.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:55.000
So for the record, by the way, to go back to the PC Engine thing.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000
I don't see it on the US site at all.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:02.000
The link was for the Japanese site which links back to the Italian site and the UK site.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:06.000
I'm sure it will be up on the US store. It's supposed to be a US release thing.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
So it's probably just not there yet.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
I'm looking at the early...

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:13.000
Japan is also on tomorrow right now. So maybe that's why.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Maybe.

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Anyway.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:21.000
So there was a new game that was going to be on its way out called Ion Maiden.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000
Remember? And then there was the whole lawsuit.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Because Iron Maiden was none too happy about that.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:29.000
And I didn't know this. I learned this watching Bobby Black Wolf tonight.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:32.000
I learned things on the Bobby Black Wolf show, believe it or not.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
And Dark Soccer, you probably know this.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Iron Maiden has a pinball table.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
I did not know. They have a brand new pinball table.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
I think I mentioned it on the show.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.000
You probably did. But you did it long enough ago

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:47.000
where I didn't connect the dots until tonight when Bobby brought it up.

01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:51.000
I was like, oh, so Iron Maiden does have an interest in gaming

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:56.000
and making sure that their name for gaming purposes and gaming protection is like...

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
So they kind of have a purpose to do that.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:03.000
So I was like, this makes a lot more sense why they went after Ion Maiden.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:09.000
So anyhow, Ion Maiden has chosen, instead of going through a big court fight,

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.000
they are going to change the name of their game.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.000
The game is now called Ion Fury.

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:18.000
And in a statement, Mike Nielsen, who's the CEO of 3D Realms, said,

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:21.000
After careful consideration, we've decided to rename our first-person shooter,

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:23.000
Ion Maiden, to Ion Fury.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000
A lot of thought went into this, but most importantly,

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:28.000
it would be a disservice to our loyal fanbase and the fantastic developers

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
to drag out a long lawsuit.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
The amazing gameplay, interactivity, and pure fun

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:36.000
is what makes Ion Fury a great game, not the title.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:39.000
And is anyone surprised that this is what ended up happening?

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Nope. Nope. Nope. Thought so.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:46.000
It's just, you know, it got settled before it ever went to court

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
and would be a waste of everyone's time.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:51.000
And, you know, maybe they thought Iron Maiden would be flattered.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:54.000
And maybe to some extent they still are, but because of the pinball machine

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
and maybe other things, who knows it's brewing,

01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:00.000
that, you know, you have to protect your intellectual property, right?

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:03.000
It's like Nintendo. As much as we get fed up with how often they shut down sites,

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:07.000
if you don't actively enforce your intellectual property, you might lose it.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
So they kind of have to do what they do.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:12.000
And maybe to some extent, Iron Maiden felt that need as well.

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
So, anyway.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:18.000
Dar Tetsuya points out, one of the local pizza places here

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:21.000
has the Iron Maiden table, though I haven't gotten around to playing on it yet.

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000
I want to check that out at some point.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000
Does the place downtown with all the pinball machines have it?

01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:28.000
Because they seem to have a lot of newer pinball machines.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:31.000
They've had it around, I think, before, but mostly I've just played at cons.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000
Interesting. All right.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:37.000
Yeah, I mean, California Extremes in a couple weeks, so I'm sure they'll have it there.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:40.000
I really hope I can go to California Extreme this year, but I don't know.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:45.000
Unfortunately, now that weekend shares the distinction with being the anniversary of my mom passing.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:49.000
So it's like if there's family stuff going on, obviously I'm going to do that instead.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:52.000
But if it works out to go to a California Extreme, I'd really love to do that.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
So, anyhow.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Well, speaking of classic game shows, why not take a moment to take a trip down memory lane

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
and visit a classic game of the week?

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:06.000
Every week, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:12.000
hey, you guys need to recognize the importance of classic games, especially this week's game.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:16.000
This is a pretty big one, I think, that's been highly influential.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.000
So let's talk about it.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:20.000
I went way back for this. We're looking at a 40-year-old game.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:23.000
But this is very important. What is the classic game of the week this week?

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:29.000
Galaxian. Yes, Galaxian came out in 1979 by Namco.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:34.000
It was licensed to Midway Games to distribute and manufacture here in North America.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:40.000
So basically, if you played Galaga, you played Galaxian. It's the same type of game.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:46.000
You have your little ship at the bottom, and you have to kill the Galaxian aliens.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
They will show and fly in formation.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:55.000
But it was created as a direct response to Space Invaders, which was released by Taito a year before.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:33:07.000
Its development was headed by Sawano Kazunori, who produced electromechanical shooting gallery games for Namco.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:11.000
And the programming was done by Tashiro Koichi.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:20.000
Anyway, they didn't really expect it to do great, but it really was a great seller.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:25.000
They had 40,000 arcade units out in North America by 1982.

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:35.000
It wasn't the first color arcade game, but it had RGB color graphics integrated into the animations and explosions.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:39.000
So it really did more with color graphics for its time.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:46.000
And for the record, the Japanese release was October 1979, and North American was December 1979.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
So both of them were in the 70s.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:53.000
And then, of course, the successor to this was Galaga.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:34:02.000
And it actually replaced Galaxian in terms of popularity during the Golden Age of arcade games.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:07.000
And then Galaxian has had other home releases. I'll get into that in a bit.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:13.000
But again, it's a fixed shooter type of game, kind of that gallery style.

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:21.000
Your ship is called the Galaxip, G-A-L-A-X-I-P, and you have to kill the Galaxians.

01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:27.000
So as far as its development, it was developed in 1979 as well and released in Japan that year.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:33.000
They wanted to take and improve upon Space Invaders, which was at its time very revolutionary.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:39.000
So they put in that new technology in its arcade board, and it was also called the Namco Galaxian board.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:49.000
And so it had a full color screen, it had enemies that moved around, you had your own ship that moved about.

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:57.000
And the Galaxian arcade board also introduced tile map hardware.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:08.000
So it would render a tile map that was 8x8 pixel tiles, which reduced processing memory requirements up to 64 times over Space Invaders.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:14.000
So the whole, you know, what into it was really a bunch of innovation from what had been out before.

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:25.000
At any rate, we had other releases. We had Galaga, we had Galplus that came out in 1984, you know, went along the same type of gameplay.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:35.000
And then there was Galaga 88 and 87, and then there was Galaga Arrangement that came out with the Namco Classics Collection Volume 1 in 1985.

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:45.000
The Namco Galaxian board was also used for later games such as Nintendo's Radarscope and Donkey Kong.

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:51.000
And then home consoles incorporated a lot of the same technology.

01:35:51.000 --> 01:36:02.000
So as far as there being other ports, Atari did its own versions of Galaxian for the various 8-bit families, the Atari 2600 and the Atari 5200.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:14.000
There were other ports that were under the Atari Soft label, which released some for Apple II, ColecoVision, Commodore 64, the VIC-20, the IBM PC, and the ZX Spectrum.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:25.000
There were other ports that came out for MSX in Europe and Japan, NECPC-8801 and the Famicon that was in Japan, and the Sharp X1.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:32.000
Bally Astrocade version was also published as Galaxian but changed it to Galactic Invasion.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:39.000
Coleco did a standalone mini-arcade tabletop, remember those? The little standalone machines?

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:44.000
So they did Galaxian in 1981, and also of course did Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, and Frogger.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:55.000
Entex did a handheld version of it called Galaxian 2, and it was called Galaxian 2 because it had two-player mode. It was not a sequel.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:02.000
So at any rate, other re-releases that happened, we had the Namco Museum versions that released.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:06.000
Galaxian and Galaga were bundled together for the Game Boy for Arcade Classics 3.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:12.000
Galaxian was released on Windows in 1995 as part of Microsoft Return of Arcade.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:19.000
There was also a release of it in Pac-Man's Arcade Party 30th Anniversary arcade machine.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:25.000
It has also been part of the Jack-specific Plug It In and Play TV game controllers.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:41.000
Galaxian as well as Galaga, Gal Plus, and Galaga 88 was, quote, redesigned and modernized as an iPhone app called Galaga 30th Anniversary Collection that commemorated the anniversary for Namco Bandai.

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:46.000
And then Super Impulse also did the standalone tiny arcade version of Galaxian.

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:56.000
Galaxian has really gone in to be in so, like, the ship, and it has been in so many other games that I'm not even gonna freaking list them all.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:05.000
Including multiple Tekken games, you know, Super Smash Brothers, some Pac-Man games, basically just all kinds of things, including a game called Tinkle Pit.

01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:12.000
Yeah, that little flower that's at the top of every board, or I guess a spaceship that looks like a flower, that is like iconic with Namco, you know what I mean?

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:13.000
Yeah.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:14.000
Yeah.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:23.000
So, of course, the Galaxian world record was a focus of competitive, you know, issue.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:43.000
There was a, actually it looks like there was a big rivalry between a British fellow named Gary Whelan and an American named Perry Rogers who faced off at the Apollo Amusements in Pompano Beach, Florida on the 6th through the 9th of April 2006.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:39:06.000
And Whelan had the world record of 1,114,550 points and was beaten by a netherlander named Arte van Wielet who scored 1,653,270 points on May 27, 2009 at Fun Spot Family Center in Wiers Beach, New Hampshire.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
And there you go.

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:12.000
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Galaxian in the arcade.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
That's older than a lot of y'all.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:17.000
Yeah, obviously on a multitude of platforms later on.

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000
I was three.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
Great pick, thank you.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:38.000
And yeah, it's kind of, it's interesting because obviously I know I used to get that game confused with Galaga all the time, although obviously we understand they have a lot in common, you know, and Galaga obviously built on it with the whole like the double ship thing is very iconic in Galaga and, you know, just there's bonus rounds and other things.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:39.000
I don't know if I've ever done Galplus though.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:40.000
Galplus?

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:41.000
Galplus?

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:45.000
I don't, I think I've played it once or twice, but I don't really remember it the same.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
You know, I don't think it made quite as...

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:50.000
I played Galplus at California Extreme. They've had it there the last few years.

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:51.000
Right.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:40:06.000
But like Galaxian, I mean, you know, it is, yes, an older game and so if you, especially if you're looking at the footage, you probably go, okay, it looks a little basic, but at the same time, it's like, okay, but consider that Space Invaders transformed the video game industry, especially when it came to Japan.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:13.000
Like, you know, they were running out of the equivalent of quarters over there for people playing those games because Space Invaders was so freaking popular.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:18.000
I want to say it was like a 5 yen coin shortage.

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:19.000
Yeah.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:20.000
So it was pretty crazy.

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:25.000
Yeah. And so, you know, Galaxian is this interesting kind of evolution of that.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:34.000
So obviously, you know, it was kind of like, okay, now what does this idea look like two years later where now the Space Invaders move beyond just this marching pattern.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:41.000
And obviously you kind of see all the differences in that game that kind of led to some of the shooters that then followed in the late 80s.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:49.000
I would say, you know, looking at that game in some ways, I see ways that it influenced a game like JIRUS, you know, even though it's, you know, very different and, you know, many shooters that came after it.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:59.000
And one thing I have really noticed is that when a game comes out, there's going to be a group that loves it and is going to try to improve on it.

01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:00.000
Yeah.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:04.000
But it's always what I say. Be critical of the things that you love. Always make them better.

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:07.000
All right. Well, thank you for that classic game of the week.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:10.000
We don't have a break segment tonight. We're just going to power through tonight.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
I didn't have time to get a video done.

01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:20.000
I have to admit one thing that also has been taking up my time this past week is that I binged Stranger Things 3.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
Yes.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:26.000
Don't worry. I'm not going to spoil. I might be a bitch, but I'm not that bitch.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
OK, so I'm not going to say anything, but I did.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:34.000
I actually part of the reason why I binged it was because I was worried about getting spoiled.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.000
Yes.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:45.000
And in fact, then my husband blurted something out that I guess he had read online or something and he's like, doesn't and he said something and I was like, what the fuck?

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:49.000
You know, I'm watching right now. Now, luckily, what he said was kind of not right.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
So I was thankful.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:57.000
But, you know, I'm like, that's part of the reason why I felt the need to power through, because I'm like, it's just a matter of time before I get spoiled on Twitter.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:01.000
And now I realize some of the things I've been seeing were spoilers.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
They just weren't labeled as such.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:07.000
So and they were, I should say, more minor.

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:10.000
Don't worry. Like, if you're suddenly going through your head, what could have been a spoiler?

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
I'm just saying there were definitely like references.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:15.000
I realized were references until like, oh, now that I'm finished with it.

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:21.000
So there's that weird thing that they have going on with where you can download Microsoft one point or something like that.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:26.000
But it's a Stranger Things like mini game that Microsoft's doing.

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
Have you even seen that? I think a Windows one.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Yeah. Windows assignment.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:37.000
And Alan saw at Target there was one because, you know, I collect these those little mini arcade machines.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:48.000
And they had one that was like a Stranger Things machine, but it had like 50 games in it because it had some Namco classics in it, apparently, and then some random like Stranger Things game.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:54.000
They all look like like garbagey cell phone games. It was interesting that they kind of crammed that all in a little cabinet.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
License the crap out of it.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:43:01.000
Well, yeah, they're they're going hog wild with the 80s references with Stranger Things three and all that.

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:06.000
So, you know, it's kind of, you know, but it's a it's a good show. I liked it overall.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:10.000
I there's a few things about the plot. But again, I'm not going to go down that road.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:13.000
I've just I was just kind of a few things to maybe go.

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:16.000
I don't know. I don't know if I like how they did that. But overall, I really liked it.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:20.000
Yeah. Yeah. It's a good show. Anyway.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:25.000
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, oh, the Stranger Things mini arcade. I saw a review. It looks awful.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:31.000
It's just it's just a bunch of cheap games thrown in. You know, it's they and they have these go.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:41.000
I swear when I was at Fry's not that long ago, like in the selection that had all the PlayStation one minis trying to offload and some of whatever was left of the NES and SNES minis.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:48.000
There are all sorts of fucking minis now. Like everybody is getting on board with these minis and they were already like, you know.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:54.000
Oh, yeah, that is weird. They sold those little joysticks that had like Pac-Man built into it and stuff.

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:58.000
Like they've been selling that type of stuff for a long time. And now that stuff is like really that looks like crap.

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:05.000
Yeah. I even told Alan, I said, you don't really need to buy that for me.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:09.000
Yeah, it's got some Namco games and 16 Stranger Things themed game.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:13.000
Yeah. And if you look at the Stranger Things games, they don't look there's like a match three.

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:18.000
And, you know, it's all your tropes that don't look that great. Let's see.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:21.000
See a Tiberian chat says, I will not complain about a Winona Ryder vehicle.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:27.000
Well, she's great. And that what's her name? That plays 11 Millie Bobby Brown.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:30.000
They're going to nominate her for an Emmy again. Guarantee it.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:34.000
Here's the more important thing that they have, though, the Dungeons and Dragons starter set.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:39.000
The Stranger Things edition, because that's yeah, that's a big part of. Yeah, absolutely.

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:44.000
Everything. Everything's got Stranger Things. I will say this. This isn't spoilery.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:48.000
Now that the kids are getting older and you can actually see like they look older. Right.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:55.000
Like, you know, it's been like two and a half years. You can see them like growing up now that they look older because they are getting older.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:45:06.000
They're not afraid to put them in more danger. And so like some of the scenes are really tense because, you know, you might see a kid get hurt because the kids are getting older.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:12.000
So they're, you know, kind of willing to put them in more dangerous scenarios. So it's just kind of interesting.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:17.000
Yeah. Anyway. All right. Moving on.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:23.000
Guys, you know, in chat says no binge. I watch one episode a day in my VR theater. If you binge, you miss stuff.

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:29.000
I can say I don't like to I don't like to binge a lot of shows, but that one I binged. That's a pretty hard generalization.

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:36.000
What? If you binge, you miss stuff. I think it just depends on who you are and you know how you watch stuff. So, yeah.

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:41.000
As Joe and Hunter Matt says, apparently they're doing a fourth season and it's reportedly the last. Yes.

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:47.000
I've heard that they're going to end it at four or five. And that would make sense because those kids those kids are going to be like full on.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:52.000
I think they're probably what it's hard to carry on the story.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:56.000
I mean, yeah, it's got to come to an end at some point. It's going to have to.

01:45:56.000 --> 01:46:00.000
So they have it like, oh, God save the world again. Oh, God save the world again. Oh, God save the world.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:07.000
It's like you got to at some point. I think they're looking for a way desperately to spin it off.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:12.000
And you saw that in the last season. And I wish nobody like that.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:17.000
Nobody liked that episode. And there is nothing like that in season three. I will say that.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:22.000
But I do think there are other ways that they have set little clues that they could spin it off.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:27.000
So I think that's what's going to happen. There's only going to be four or five episodes of Stranger Things, but there will be a spin off.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:33.000
Absolutely. Fucking look at Game of Thrones. You know, HBO didn't really want that ended badly.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:37.000
So there. Well, yeah, we all heard the ending was horrible, but we know that we already know there.

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:43.000
I watched it. It was terrible. I know it was on Sunday nights. I know you can watch on demand and stuff.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:48.000
I just don't didn't care enough. But they're spinning that off.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:53.000
So that that's what I think will happen to Stranger Things. They do four or five seasons, then they're going to spin it off.

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:59.000
So. All right. Pod culture says hopefully they keep the VHS style packaging for the next seasons.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:04.000
I picked up the first two hella cheap at Target. Oh, I'm sure they will. I'm sure. Anyway.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:09.000
All right. Let's move on. Let's get into some other gaming news as we travel around and look at some rapid fire.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:13.000
Some fast news for the week. Loki. Yes. Some breathtaking mods out there.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:19.000
So we've got one familiar solid five that allows you to play as, of course, Keanu Reeves.

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:28.000
But, you know, John. Yes. John Wick or Silverhand from Cyberpunk 2077.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:35.000
And of course, it's amazing. And you can go check it out.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:43.000
Yeah, I know. You know, I think I have this game from some sort of bundle, but I haven't bothered to actually play it.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:47.000
So maybe I have to go do this now. That's on Nexus mods, if you're interested.

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:55.000
And then another game that is on Steam that I know I was interested in when I saw the first trailer for it, because I do love Goat Simulator.

01:47:55.000 --> 01:48:00.000
However, this does not tie in with Goat Simulator, but it's the same type of thing.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:09.000
It's called Goat of Duty. And it's basically the puts the players in the role of a goat with this cybernetic arm that has guns attached to it.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:13.000
And you're basically fighting each other in the Call of Duty style game.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:19.000
But it has a lot of weird stuff that you can do in there. You can throw down tornadoes. You can fake your death.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:27.000
You feign death. He has a two hundred and fifty bleeds you can do, which is pretty amazing.

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:37.000
But it is out in early access right now, so you can actually pick it up for $5.94 during the launch week or $6.99 when the sale ends on the 17th.

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:40.000
I may have to pick this up.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:43.000
I was going to say, that was a very specific price, but I get it. It's a discount. Okay, I get it.

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:46.000
Yeah, yeah. It's probably like a 10% discount or something.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:58.000
Yeah, sounds like it. Anyway, hey, if you still have not played the Arkham trilogy, the Batman Arkham trilogy, which was like Arkham City, Arkham Knight, Arkham Asylum.

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:01.000
I don't even remember all the games that were in it, but I know they were all good games, though.

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:08.000
They were fun. Yeah, Arkham Asylum was the first one. Then it was Arkham City was the second one, and then Arkham Knight was the last one.

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:12.000
Okay, so I did get them all the titles right. So anyway, that was the trilogy. Some of you may still not have played it.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:27.000
Well, guess what? Thanks to an Amazon leak, we know that there's going to be a Steelbook release coming out. It's the Batman Arkham Collection Steelbook edition, which will have, or I could have looked at the story, and it's all right here, which will have Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Arkham Knight. It's more fun to quiz myself.

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:30.000
But you knew it, though. You were doubting yourself.

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:34.000
But remember, there was another one. There was Arkham Origins that was done by a different studio.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:38.000
Right. Yeah, that won't be a part of this. This is the Rocksteady releases.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:44.000
Rocksteady did confirm that the leak was a legit thing, so this will be happening.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:51.000
And I'm sure if you're a collector and you like to get things like Steelbooks and stuff, this will probably be something you're really into.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:56.000
And it does sound like it's going to be physical discs, not just digital downloads.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:03.000
You will get the post-release content, and there will be, I guess, an Earth to Dark Knight skin for the PS4 edition.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:11.000
Anyway, if you have yet to get this trilogy, maybe now's the time. You can get it on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on September 6th for $50.

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:16.000
They were good games, though. I didn't beat any of them. I played them all, but I didn't beat them.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:24.000
Anyway, apparently there was rumors this week that Final Fantasy VII's remake was going to be coming out for Xbox One.

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:33.000
And this was due to Xbox Germany apparently posting information about Final Fantasy VII Remake and then suddenly pulling it.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:37.000
It was dubbed an internal mistake, and that's all that was there.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:44.000
Apparently it had said that the remake would come to Xbox One in March of 2020, right when the PlayStation 4 version would come out,

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:50.000
which totally counter-dicted when they announced the game originally that it would be on PlayStation 4 first.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:59.000
Well, in a follow-up statement, Square Enix did say they have no plans for other platforms, which is their nice way of saying PlayStation first.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:05.000
But, I mean, maybe PlayStation first, but then maybe by the time they get to Episode 2 and 3,

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:10.000
and this game gets its own inevitable steelbook edition that has everything in it, because you all know that's how this ends.

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:14.000
Maybe that's the one that'll turn out on Xbox One. We'll see.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:17.000
Anyway, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us for Rapid Fire?

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:27.000
So, for people who are waiting for Psychonauts 2, it has been delayed until 2020 to come out on PC and consoles,

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:37.000
and it will actually be published by Microsoft as a first-party title, though it is still going to be coming out on the PS4.

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:44.000
So there's apologies around, but it's what they're doing to get it out, so it is what it is, right?

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:53.000
So, in other news, and this is something that harkens back, harkens back to another thing.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:52:01.000
It was a classic game that I talked about that was by Sunsoft that came out as Journey to Silius. I talked about the music in it.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:04.000
Yeah, I was going to say, to be fair, it was classic soundtrack, but yes.

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:08.000
Soundtrack, yeah. But it was supposed to have been a Terminator game.

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:18.000
Well, there is a promo video that was acquired by Gaming Alexandria that Sunsoft made to promote the game at Winter CES 1989.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:29.000
So, basically, they lost the license for the game, and then, well, basically, they lost the license after they abandoned the movie plot.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:36.000
So, it's just completely, you know, they completely fucked it up, so they lost their license.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:47.000
At any rate, though, there also were, it looks like apart from the video that, yeah, some people saw some sprite sheets for it, too.

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:53.000
But really, it's the video that's the big one, and if anyone wants to watch the video who's in chat, I'll happily post a link to it.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
Just don't watch it right now.

01:52:55.000 --> 01:53:00.000
Yeah. There's other things going on right now, yes. I got you. All right, pretty cool.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:05.000
All right, it's always fun when we talk about a classic game, and then it's, like, in the news that week or a later week.

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:09.000
It's kind of fun how that all kind of circles back around at some point, so.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:18.000
All right, well, moving on. Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and what is coming out in a game store near you this week.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:19.000
Loki, starting with us.

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:27.000
Not much, but there is one game, and it's pretty good. So, on the Nintendo Switch, Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3, the Black Order.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
Oh, yeah. Yeah, some people are going to be interested in that.

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:34.000
Yeah, some people. I am one of those people. I wish it was on more systems.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:40.000
Gotcha. Well, traveling over to Japan, last week was kind of a slow week. I feel like it's picking up a little bit more this week.

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:48.000
On July 18th, we get Pro Yakyuu's Spirits is coming out. It's a baseball game. Professional baseball spirits would be the way it translates in English.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
That is coming out this week in Japan.

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
What? It doesn't have the little bobblehead, guys.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:54:01.000
It's very photorealistic, this one. So, yeah, and it actually says they captured the faces of the players from photographing, and 3D data was used to make the models.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
It looks really realistic.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:08.000
But it used to be not realistic. This is the same Konami game.

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:14.000
I think there's pro, and there's not pro. I think it's the difference. But anyway.

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
And baseball in Japan?

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:17.000
Oh, sure.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:18.000
Fairly religious.

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:22.000
Big deal. So, pretty cool that that's on its way out, and I'm sure some people will be into that.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:26.000
And that's a game that you're not going to ever see released here, because it is Japanese baseball.

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:31.000
And I'm sure even though there might be some fans of that here, it's just not enough to justify the cost of releasing the game here.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:34.000
So some of you may import that on your region-free devices.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:38.000
Some other games out this week. Kingdom Come Deliverance in Japan this week.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
Also, Judgment gets a price reduction.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:45.000
And The Sims 4 moves into Best Hits and gets a price reduction in Japan this week.

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:49.000
Also, a game called Lotus Labyrinth is coming out this week on the PlayStation 4.

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:52.000
Checking out the Nintendo Switch real quick.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:56.000
We don't have that same baseball game, but we do have Lotus Labyrinth is also out there.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:01.000
As well as a game called Sumikko Gurashi, School Life Begins.

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:05.000
Oh, I buy those notebooks with the little kappa character on it.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:10.000
I think one of the Senex things, or like the Senex things.

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:14.000
Oh yeah, the little chibi little penguin and fluffy things.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:17.000
There's like a kappa who has a cucumber and everything.

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:20.000
Yep, yep, that's it. He's there in the back of the box.

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
I have a bunch of those notebooks that I use at work.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:23.000
Oh, cute.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
I get them at Ichiban-kan.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:30.000
Yeah, this says they might be able to settle down when they're in the corners, but they don't like being in the center of the room.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:33.000
Can relate.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:34.000
Alright.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
Hashtag mood.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
Let's go over to the UK, Darsakura.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:43.000
We have FIIA European Truck Racing Championship on July 27th.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:46.000
The following games are on the 18th.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:49.000
We have Redeemer Enhanced Edition.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:53.000
We have Cities Skyline Nintendo Switch Edition.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:57.000
We have Kingdom Come Deliverance Royal Collectors Edition.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:02.000
And then, last but not least, Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3 for Switch.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
Which a lot of people are going to be excited about.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:08.000
Was this Comic-Con weekend? I'm surprised we didn't see a lot come out of those panels yet.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
Unless people are just like, oh my god.

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:15.000
Or maybe it just wasn't a lot of, or I guess I forgot to see if there was anything really big that came out of that.

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:16.000
People are still losing their shit.

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:19.000
Will you check some of the big headline sites to see if we missed anything from Comic-Con?

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
Just want to make sure we covered all the bases there.

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
So, as far as, I don't care about the movies.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:29.000
I care more about the, because Marvel was going to have a panel and the Avengers game was supposed to show up there too.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:32.000
And I remember it wasn't so well received in E3.

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:39.000
Yeah, and from what I hear, they did show gameplay and that gameplay is not going to come out.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:40.000
What?

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:43.000
Like they're not going to release the gameplay video out to everyone.

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:46.000
Oh, it was one of the in the hall only. Got it, got it. Alright.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:49.000
Well, let's move on. We're going to go to the mailbag.

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:52.000
Every week we invite your emails that participate at Orangelaunchradio.com.

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:56.000
And we read some of our favorite emails on the show, or in some cases we do.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:00.000
And Comic-Con's not until, San Diego Comic-Con's not until this coming week.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:03.000
Oh, it's the coming week. Okay. Sorry, I thought we missed it.

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:06.000
No, but I hear though that the footage they're going to show, they're not going to...

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:10.000
Okay, so you got to be there to see it. Okay. Sorry.

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
Yes, DarkSakura, one email this week.

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:15.000
Hello, Alar. Hi, YYR.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:20.000
I just wanted to take a quick moment to clarify something I mentioned on last week's episode.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:24.000
The Justifier light guns available on Genesis were not a Sega product at all.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
They were made by Konami.

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:31.000
The light guns were specifically created for use with the home versions of Lethal Enforcers games.

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:36.000
And if you like your gameplay sanitized, you can get a Justifier for use with the stripe of Nintendo also.

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:40.000
Well, that's it. Thanks for bringing us another great show. Yay.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
Warm regards, Aaron YYR.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:48.000
Which I think is absolutely funny that the confidentiality statement at the end of this is longer than the email.

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
Good job.

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
That's how it goes.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:56.000
Well, you know what, YYR, thank you for another good, I guess, fact checking.

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:57.000
Observation.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:57:59.000
Yeah, observation. I like that.

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.000
Thank you for your clarification.

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
There you go.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:06.000
Alright, well, there's nothing for us to respond to in that, however.

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
It's just, uh, no.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
Drag Race talk!

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
No, there's no Drag Race on now anyway.

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
Drag Race Canada's coming on.

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
I guess you could talk about Dragula.

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:17.000
Dragula?

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:21.000
Having been to one of the Boulay Brothers events, though, that's a pretty stellar show.

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:24.000
But we got an email, so no tangent this week.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
Ruining my fun. Eat a cookie.

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
After the show. I'll have a cookie in a little bit.

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
Tell everyone what my cookies are like.

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:31.000
They're good.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
All my cookies are good.

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:36.000
My cookies bring more carbs to my tummy.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:39.000
Alright, moving on, we got some more gaming stories for you guys,

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
and then we're gonna get to our Discord calls,

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
as well as if you have any chat questions.

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
Let's get to it. Loki.

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:52.000
So Ubisoft, of course, released their story creator tool for Assassin's Creed Odyssey

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:57.000
that lots of people have been creating their own custom quests and stuff,

01:58:57.000 --> 01:59:00.000
but of course, like most things, when you put out a tool

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:04.000
that allows you to create custom things or mods for a game,

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:09.000
you're gonna have people using it to exploit easy XP boosting.

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:13.000
And so now they've decided to say that...

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
Here's what Ubisoft says.

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:19.000
These exploits risk jeopardizing the overall quality and integrity and purpose

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:23.000
of the story creator mode and results in less visibility for the creative,

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:27.000
interesting, and frankly fantastic community stories that have been published.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
That's what they say.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:33.000
But here's one thing you have to understand about Assassin's Creed Odyssey.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:37.000
They sell XP boosts in their storefront.

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:42.000
That's why they're mad that people are making free XP boost quests,

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
because they want to sell them to you,

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:49.000
and it is in fact jeopardizing the overall quality and integrity

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:56.000
and purpose of their in-game storefront, is really what it comes down to.

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:59.000
Questbuster in chat really puts this succinctly, saying,

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:03.000
I love Odyssey, but the XP grind scaling is so trash.

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:06.000
If it wasn't a problem, people wouldn't want to find ways around it.

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:10.000
Yeah, it's nice to create a problem that you can then also create the solution for

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
and then charge for that solution.

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
Yep, that's how it works.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:18.000
So yeah, just don't do it or you'll get banned.

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:24.000
And then of course, along with banning people for using the story creator,

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:29.000
there have been people that have been getting banned in Rainbow Six Siege,

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:38.000
because apparently people have been filling up game chat windows with random symbols,

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:46.000
and this has caused lag and apparently causes people to disconnect with this kind of exploit.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:54.000
So you'll get banned for that now, and apparently they're deploying a fix for the chat symbol exploit.

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
But yeah, their games are all broken.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:59.000
And don't do stuff that they don't like, otherwise they'll ban you.

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:05.000
Yeah, that's right. Don't try to cheat their storefronts, or you're going to get banned.

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
You be banned. You be banned!

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
Alright, moving on.

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:14.000
We got news about a new Turok game,

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:17.000
but it probably isn't the type of Turok game you're thinking about.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
You're probably thinking about the old school Turok games.

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
N64 was the first one, right?

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:22.000
Yeah.

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
Yeah, this isn't quite the same thing.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:28.000
It's just kind of rooted in some of the same stories that inspired the older games.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:29.000
So here's the deal.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:32.000
It's a new game coming out on Steam on July 25th.

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:37.000
It's called Turok Escape from Lost Valley, and it's a little more cartoony.

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:41.000
It's also isometric 3D. It's not first person dinosaur hunting.

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:47.000
It's still kind of the similar sort of concept where Turok and the brother Andar

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:50.000
are in a valley full of dinosaurs, and you hunt the dinosaurs,

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
and it just looks a little bit cuter.

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:53.000
It's super cute.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:54.000
Yeah, it is super cute.

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:57.000
Now, even though you might be like,

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
they're making a new Turok game, I had no idea.

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:02.000
This actually was a finalist in the Universal Game Dev Challenge

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:05.000
that was during the 2018 Game Developers Conference.

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:08.000
And they took these small teams of Unity developers,

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:14.000
brought them together, and challenged them to make games about Universal-owned properties.

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:17.000
So that's why Turok was there.

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:20.000
Thank goodness we got a Turok game and not a Minions game.

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:21.000
Right.

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:25.000
Well, it should be noted that the ultimate grand prize went to a strategy game

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:31.000
called Voltron, Cubes of Volcarion, which is also coming to Steam on July 25th.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:32.000
So, how about that?

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:33.000
Voltron game.

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:34.000
Yeah.

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:35.000
Cool.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:36.000
Yeah, pretty cool.

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:39.000
Maybe if Turok isn't up your alley, maybe Voltron Cubes will be.

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
I know Voltron was pretty cool.

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
Anyway, some other just notes about this.

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:49.000
The character design from this goes all the way back to the 1954 roots of Turok

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:52.000
in Escape from Lost Valley in some of the earliest comics

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:56.000
that were originally published by Western Publishing, Dell and Gold Key.

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
So, that's pretty cool.

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
Yeah, just a very different type of Turok game,

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
but you have to remember Turok is a bigger property

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:05.000
than what you might remember from the Nintendo 64.

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:08.000
And then SGL 100 Matt is linking some articles in chat

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:12.000
where you can actually see screenshots and so forth.

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
Though I wish he'd use a better website.

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:18.000
But you can look him up on YouTube and stuff too as well.

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:19.000
All right, let's move on.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:20.000
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:24.000
You have another kind of like gaming science type of thing, right?

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:27.000
Yes, because I love gaming and science.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:33.000
So, basically, there was another study that was published,

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:37.000
and this was this time by the Creative Research Journal,

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:40.000
in the Creativity Research Journal,

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:44.000
where researchers analyzed 352 participants

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:49.000
to compare the effects of playing Minecraft with or without instruction

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:53.000
to watching a TV show or playing a race car video game.

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:56.000
So, after 40 minutes of play or watching TV,

02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:01.000
the participants were supposed to create different creativity tasks.

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
To measure the production, they were asked to draw a creature

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
from a world much different than Earth.

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:08.000
More human-like creatures scored low for creativity,

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:11.000
and those less human scored high.

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:16.000
So, it was found that those who had full freedom to do Minecraft

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:22.000
on their own, without instructions, they were the least creative.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:28.000
So, basically, let me start over.

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:29.000
I take that back.

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:30.000
They were the most creative.

02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:36.000
Well, those who were instructed how to play Minecraft were least creative.

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:37.000
Oh, okay.

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:38.000
Sorry.

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000
So, like if you were able to be more sandboxy,

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
then that's going to lead to, okay, I get that.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
I get logically I understand why that would happen.

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:45.000
Okay.

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:49.000
So, basically, it's when you have like an open world,

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:52.000
instruction-less sort of thing,

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:56.000
is that it really does boost your own problem solving skills,

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:59.000
as well as your ability to think around a certain thing.

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
So, there you go.

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
Let your kids play Minecraft.

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:04.000
Just don't let them download anything.

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:05.000
Shit.

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:06.000
I was going to say,

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:09.000
if they were going to make different space aliens and things like that,

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
I'm surprised you don't play something like No Man's Sky.

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:15.000
You see all sorts of different types of what aliens would look like

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:18.000
in that type of game that are not necessarily human.

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:19.000
I mean, there's some humanoid creatures,

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:23.000
but there's a lot of space flying things and all that.

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:26.000
So, maybe No Man's Sky isn't really a kid's game.

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:27.000
I don't know.

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:32.000
Or maybe Spore, where there's lots of creatures that all look like dicks.

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:33.000
That takes me back.

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
Man, you know what?

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:38.000
As much as people rag on the way Spore came out,

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:43.000
Spore will always be the reason why I got to sit in the same room

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
as Will Wright showing off his game.

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:50.000
And when you talk about when you look back on 17 years of the show,

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:53.000
and even though, okay, we're not the most famous podcast out there,

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
we never had our viral moment,

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:58.000
we don't make buku bucks doing this show.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:02.000
We did for a brief moment, and then everyone immediately forgot who we were.

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
Well, I don't even think for the brief moment.

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:05.000
It didn't really last long.

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:09.000
But I will say that one of the things that this show has been able to bring me

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:10.000
was that experience.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:13.000
I got to sit in the same room with Will Wright as he played his game,

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:14.000
even if it was Spore.

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:15.000
Whatever.

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:18.000
I think Spore got shit on a little more than it needed.

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:21.000
The problem with Spore is that it was just mini-games

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
brought together in a weird sort of way.

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:26.000
But I don't think it was as bad as people made it out to be either.

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:30.000
It was really kind of like something I would think that would do well

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
on cell phones now.

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
Oh, God, I gave you ideas.

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:36.000
Yeah, I wouldn't do that.

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:37.000
All right.

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:40.000
Moving on, a couple more stories before we open up Discord.

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:41.000
So if you want to get in,

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
if you have something you want to talk about tonight on Discord,

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:47.000
you can make your way to the green room over at the VOG Network Discord server,

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:51.000
which all the information is down below on our Twitch page,

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:54.000
or you can just ask in chat if you're having any problems.

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:58.000
But vognetwork.com slash Discord is the place to be.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:04.000
So apparently there's this new section in Steam called Steam Labs,

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:08.000
which has a bunch of new experimental things that they're doing to Steam

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
to kind of make it a little bit better.

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:14.000
So one of the things that they're experimenting with is micro-trailers.

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:17.000
So that's six-second trailers that are on every single game.

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:23.000
They have an automated daily half-hour show about games

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:26.000
and an interactive recommender.

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:32.000
So one of these things, the automated or the interactive recommending thing,

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:38.000
is like it's supposed to work off of the games that you play

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:39.000
in your playing time history,

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:43.000
and it's going to use that to recommend new games

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:46.000
based on what other people have played as well.

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:47.000
So that's kind of neat.

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
Yeah, but the algorithm part of the Steam store is,

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:53.000
I think, when the Steam store started losing all of its character,

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:54.000
and it's just kind of so...

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
The Steam store isn't great.

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:57.000
Well, they have to...

02:07:57.000 --> 02:07:59.000
If I don't go in there knowing what I'm going to get...

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:03.000
They're trying to make ways that they don't have to do the curation themselves,

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:06.000
and fortunately that didn't work out well for YouTube,

02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.000
and it's not working out well for them either.

02:08:08.000 --> 02:08:09.000
Everybody forgets.

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:12.000
Steam has a Twitch competitor built into it,

02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:13.000
but literally nobody...

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
Well, I shouldn't say literally nobody's using it,

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:18.000
but nobody I know is talking about it.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:22.000
Nobody I know is out there promoting their Steam streaming.

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:25.000
It's all Twitch or YouTube,

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:28.000
and shit, I see people promoting Mixer as well.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
So those are the ones I actually see promoted.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:34.000
I don't see anybody trying to build their Steam channel presence.

02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:37.000
I even think I saw a Facebook gamer the other day

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
that was streaming on Facebook.

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:40.000
I even saw that.

02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:42.000
I don't see Steam.

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:43.000
Yeah.

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000
But the six-second trailers?

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:48.000
That's a good idea.

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:50.000
That's about the attention span people have for that.

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:51.000
The micro...

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:52.000
They're saying, though...

02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:54.000
The other thing that's kind of weird, though,

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:58.000
is apparently that those mini...

02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:01.000
The 30...

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
The little game shows,

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:06.000
the daily half-hour shows about games,

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:09.000
I guess a lot of it's in text-to-speech or whatever.

02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:13.000
I don't know. It's just weird.

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
I'm just curious.

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:18.000
I haven't actually signed into this to opt in,

02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:20.000
but I'm curious to see what it would recommend.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:22.000
It'd probably recommend that I start playing this

02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:24.000
in my fucking backlog is what it would recommend.

02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:27.000
I think you probably should stop buying games

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:30.000
and start playing the 500 to 600 that you have.

02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.000
Do you even know what half of these are?

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:35.000
Yeah. It should show you six-second trailers

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:38.000
for games you already own but haven't funded yet.

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:40.000
Already own but haven't fucking touched.

02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.000
That's what the Steam thing should do.

02:09:42.000 --> 02:09:43.000
It's like, listen...

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:44.000
Look at what you're missing out on this week.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:45.000
They did have that event.

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:46.000
They're all like,

02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:48.000
Dude, fucking go play your games that you have.

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:51.000
I just haven't gotten around to it.

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:52.000
Maybe I will.

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:54.000
I thought about one time,

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:58.000
I should just film myself playing a new game in my library

02:09:58.000 --> 02:09:59.000
every single...

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:00.000
Well, maybe not every day,

02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:01.000
because that's a little much,

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
but I probably could do every day.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:06.000
It'd take a few years to go through.

02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.000
All right, well, one more story for you guys tonight.

02:10:08.000 --> 02:10:10.000
And this is one of those things that,

02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:12.000
even though I think in some ways

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:13.000
I felt it was just a matter of time,

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:14.000
it's like one of those,

02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:16.000
like, wow, it's really gonna be happening.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:19.000
And that is that a new Netflix series is coming

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
based on the video game Cuphead.

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:22.000
Yay!

02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:23.000
That's right.

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
The Cuphead show is going to be starring Cuphead

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:28.000
and Mugman, or Player 2, if you will,

02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:30.000
and their adventures on Inkwell Isle.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
But we don't know much more.

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
All we know is that in an interview with IGN,

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:37.000
the game creators, Chad and Jared Moldenhauer,

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
said it's not a little kids cartoon,

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:43.000
and it will be the same kind of vibe that the game hints at.

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:46.000
So maybe it'll be a little more like of an adult cartoon.

02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:47.000
But I also think those kind of,

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
like, the cartoons that work best,

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
why do so many people look back on things like Tiny Toons

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
and Animaniacs and think that those,

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
like, those are, like, some of the best?

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:58.000
Because it was humor that, like, was suitable for kids,

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:01.000
but, like, adults would find the deeper level humor in it,

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:02.000
right?

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
Hello, nurse, right?

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:07.000
You know, there's things in it that adults would find even funnier.

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:10.000
So, anyway, what's also interesting about this,

02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:13.000
it is being animated in-house by Netflix,

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
but one of the producers on this, not just Netflix,

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
King Features Syndicate.

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:21.000
They're like the folks that hold, like, the licenses for Betty Boop,

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
Popeye, like, classics.

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:27.000
So this is, uh, it's so interesting how this has come full circle

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:30.000
because Cuphead is arguably inspired by those type of cartoons in the past,

02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:33.000
and now we're getting an actual Cuphead show.

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:38.000
And, um, also goes to show just how many frickin',

02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:41.000
like, video games are becoming Netflix things.

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
Like, we know The Witcher's on the way, right?

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:46.000
We just had a story not that long ago about Final Fantasy XIV.

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:50.000
Uh, The Division, if it's not a Netflix thing, it's a Hulu thing.

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:51.000
It's one of those, right?

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:52.000
No, The Vision's Netflix.

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:54.000
The Vision, okay, The Division's a Netflix thing.

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:55.000
I thought there was one that was Hulu.

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
What about The Doom, The Doom, uh, Creation?

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:58.000
No, that was a USA Network.

02:11:58.000 --> 02:11:59.000
That wasn't a...

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:00.000
Yeah, that's USA.

02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:01.000
...streaming service.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
But still, it's, it's kinda interesting just, like,

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:04.000
how many video games are going over.

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.000
But the other interesting thing about Netflix,

02:12:06.000 --> 02:12:09.000
Netflix is kind of in a position where they have to,

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
to really start creating their own stuff.

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:12.000
Why?

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:15.000
Because everybody else is pulling their shit off the service

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
and taking it to their own streaming platform.

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:20.000
Hence why Netflix is gonna lose friends in the office

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.000
in about another year and a half

02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:24.000
because Comcast NBC wants to do their own thing.

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:27.000
Yeah, but I've only watched The Office,

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
like, the entire series, like, five times.

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
So I think I'm, I think I'm good.

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
You think you got it all out of your system at this point.

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:34.000
I think I'm good.

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:36.000
And The Friends, like, two or three times.

02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:39.000
But you know, you know those are two of the most streamed shows on Netflix.

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:43.000
I get it, but, like, are people really gonna pay extra money to, like, no.

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:46.000
I, I think the bubble's gonna burst on some of that,

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
and if those services don't think about consolidating,

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
they're just gonna kill each other off.

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:51.000
And I think it's gonna bring back piracy.

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:52.000
It is.

02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:53.000
Honestly, yeah.

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:56.000
I think that's already happening with Star Trek Discovery.

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
People don't want to get CBS All Access for it,

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
so they pirate it off international Netflix or whatever.

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
So I think, I think it's already happening.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:03.000
VPNs.

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:04.000
Yeah.

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:05.000
Anyway.

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:06.000
Yeah, YYR in chat says,

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:08.000
Get ready for the dark ages of streaming.

02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:09.000
And Kaijuto says,

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
Never watched Friends or The Office.

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:12.000
And SSJ100Matt says,

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:14.000
It all hinges on Disney Plus.

02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:15.000
Let's not kid ourselves.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
Disney Plus is going to do very, they're all,

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:18.000
Yeah.

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:21.000
just by putting the movies on a streaming service.

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:24.000
It's, like, instant babysitter for children.

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:27.000
Star Wars, Disney, and Marvel.

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:28.000
Yeah.

02:13:28.000 --> 02:13:30.000
Disney Plus stands to do very well, and that's what probably,

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:33.000
I just hope they have a package that bundles in Hulu,

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:36.000
because, you know, since they're gonna be owning that as well,

02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:39.000
I'm, it would be nice to be able to have both services.

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:40.000
Oh, my bad.

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:41.000
DGRMS says,

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:44.000
Friends isn't going to NBCU streaming service.

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:46.000
It's going to HBO Max streaming.

02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:49.000
But I thought, I thought it was the other way around.

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:52.000
Like, NBC's new streaming thing included HBO.

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:54.000
But I guess maybe it is called HBO Max.

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:55.000
I can't, see, this is the problem.

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:59.000
Like, it's too many, you're spreading it across too many different platforms,

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:02.000
and it's just, if it's not going to be easy,

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
it's easier to go download it.

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:05.000
Right.

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:06.000
Right.

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:07.000
Or just not watch it.

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:08.000
Just like, you know what?

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:09.000
I fucking watch Friends enough.

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
Yeah, or if you really, like,

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:14.000
I hate to suggest this, but as long as, like,

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:16.000
the basic Netflix for whatever you're paying, like,

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:17.000
$14 a month is still strong,

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:20.000
they could probably get away with, like, what cable does,

02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:22.000
and say, if you want to add Friends in the office,

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:24.000
you have to pay an extra $2 a month or something,

02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:26.000
or this suite of NBC shows.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:27.000
I don't know.

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:28.000
But again, I don't,

02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:30.000
is that really any better than a separate streaming service?

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:31.000
I don't know.

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:34.000
But that's kind of what traditional cable does with HBO and Showtime

02:14:34.000 --> 02:14:36.000
and those types of things, right?

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.000
So, anyway.

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:39.000
Ah, okay.

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:40.000
DGRMS says,

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:43.000
Friends was produced by Warner Brothers.

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
AT&T owns Warner Brothers.

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:48.000
They're the one putting out the new HBO streaming service.

02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:49.000
Thank you.

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:50.000
It's an AT&T thing.

02:14:50.000 --> 02:14:51.000
That I do remember reading.

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:55.000
So, now AT&T wants to get in on this.

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:56.000
Come on.

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:57.000
Too many.

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000
Too many streaming services.

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
All right.

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
And Bobby Blackwell says,

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:04.000
I just don't watch Discovery.

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:06.000
If I'm not willing to get it legally, I just go without.

02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:09.000
I don't believe I'm entitled to TV shows.

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
But it is interesting because, I mean,

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:12.000
so many TV shows are over the air.

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:15.000
I think many of us have kind of grew up with that entitlement

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:16.000
in a weird way.

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:17.000
I get what you're saying.

02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:18.000
Don't get me wrong.

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
I just think it is interesting when we talk about specifically

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:23.000
television because, you know, since we were kids,

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
you could get a lot of that for free.

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
But anyway, I digress.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
I'm just in the same boat where it's like,

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:32.000
if I don't, I don't really pirate TV shows because I just,

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:35.000
there's plenty that I can watch.

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:38.000
And Netflix does still have a lot of good stuff.

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:39.000
But the other services do too.

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:42.000
If I had Hulu, I'd probably be watching The Handmaid's Tale.

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:45.000
Even though apparently this new season is pissing everybody off.

02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:46.000
But that's all I know.

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:47.000
I don't know what the details are.

02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:48.000
I flat out refuse to watch that.

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:49.000
I've watched it.

02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:52.000
I've heard it's like too scary and not in a...

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
I started reading the book and put it down.

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
Yeah. So.

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:59.000
I don't know if it's like too scary, but...

02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:03.000
It's not, not scary like, like thriller slasher scary,

02:16:03.000 --> 02:16:04.000
but too scary.

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:07.000
Like this hits too close to home right now.

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:10.000
Like I could see this happening and I don't like it.

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
And yeah, I, I get that.

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
So, all right.

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:17.000
All right. Anyhow, we've digressed enough.

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:20.000
I think it's time to get into the listener round table via chat,

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:24.000
as well as our Discord server over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:28.000
While we're waiting to see if anybody wants to call by joining our green room,

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
we would welcome any last minute stories.

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:33.000
While I wait to see if there's any of those,

02:16:33.000 --> 02:16:37.000
I would also open it up to our Twitch chat room over at twitch.tv slash vognetwork.

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:41.000
If you have anything you wanted to ask us tonight to talk about

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:42.000
or anything like that.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:46.000
So, meanwhile, do we have any last minute things that are coming in?

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:48.000
Uh, no.

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:49.000
Not really.

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:51.000
Unfortunately, one thing I was going to mention,

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:55.000
because I have been reading a lot of different reviews for Astral Chain.

02:16:55.000 --> 02:16:58.000
I think, was it Astral Chain? No, it wasn't Astral Chain.

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:03.000
It was the game that was supposed to be like Actraiser that Sega put out.

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:04.000
Oh, yeah.

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:05.000
I hear it's not good.

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:06.000
Oh, that's a bummer.

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:07.000
Yeah.

02:17:07.000 --> 02:17:08.000
So, there it is.

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:09.000
I didn't realize it was already out.

02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:10.000
Yeah, I think it already came out.

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:11.000
Oh, shoot.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:16.000
But Blazing Chrome, the game that's like Contra, very good.

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
But that is if you believe internet people.

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:19.000
Yes.

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:20.000
Okay.

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:23.000
But I believe the internet videos that I've watched of Blazing Chrome,

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:24.000
it's very good.

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:28.000
It's very 16-bit Contra, and I need that in my life.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:31.000
Question for Metal Mayhem in our chat room for those in studios.

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:36.000
Did you folks make use of the recent Steam summer sale?

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:37.000
A big no.

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:38.000
No.

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:42.000
I know for me, honestly, just with, well, I've had a lot.

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
Obviously, you guys know my mind's been going a million different directions

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:45.000
when it's been coming to gaming.

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:47.000
And I think just because when I am gaming,

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:52.000
I'm so into Final Fantasy XIV and like Mario Maker 2 and the stuff I already have.

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:55.000
I think I was really able to successfully put my foot down and be like,

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:58.000
I don't need to buy any new games right now just for the sake of owning games.

02:17:58.000 --> 02:17:59.000
I'm not going to play.

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:04.000
Like, I think I finally was able to do that here in the year of our Lord 2019.

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:07.000
Finally able to resist a Steam sale.

02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:11.000
I bought something, but I don't remember what it was that I bought.

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:16.000
In fact, I'm going to check now because I remember paying for something,

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:20.000
but I don't remember what it was that I paid for.

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:23.000
You know what I think it was?

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:26.000
It may have been Moshpit Simulator.

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:29.000
It may have been Moshpit Simulator.

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:32.000
I don't remember.

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:33.000
Hmm.

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:34.000
All right.

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:35.000
I'm going to go to another question.

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:36.000
If you think of it, great.

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:40.000
As Joe and Hunter Matt says, since Twitch is an Amazon company,

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
this is on people's minds today,

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:46.000
what are you hoping to get gaming-wise or in general on Prime Day?

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:50.000
Anybody going to be participating in the Prime Day shenanigans?

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:51.000
Just for the pre-order.

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:57.000
The TurboGrafx mini that was early spoken of I think is enough right there.

02:18:57.000 --> 02:19:03.000
I do really want to get a 4K television, but...

02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:04.000
I did last year.

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:07.000
I have other financial stuff going on right now.

02:19:07.000 --> 02:19:10.000
We just paid off a big dental thing,

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:16.000
so I just feel like it's not a very adult idea to buy the 4K TV now,

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:20.000
but maybe that will be a November, December holiday thing

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:24.000
I treat myself and Alan to as a 4K TV.

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:27.000
But yeah, I think otherwise...

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:28.000
Because I just bought...

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:32.000
That TV is not that old, but it's like the price of...

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
When I bought that TV, it was almost...

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:37.000
I feel like that TV was almost $1200 or something like that.

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:39.000
I spent a lot of money on that TV.

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:40.000
You can get 4K TV much cheaper.

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:43.000
I know, now you can get 4K TVs that size for like $500.

02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:44.000
Crazy.

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:47.000
So that's why I'm kind of like, well, I guess it's time...

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.000
Which means that TV, if it even fit, would move in here.

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:51.000
We'd have this giant fucking television in here.

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.000
And it was Moshpit Simulator.

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:54.000
Okay, thank you.

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:55.000
We're all dying to know.

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:59.000
Yes, and for those who are unaware of what Moshpit Simulator is,

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:06.000
it is a physics simulator with a lot of these like really bouncy around naked dudes for some reason.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:07.000
But it's a VR game.

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:08.000
It's really fucking weird.

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:09.000
It's like...

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:14.000
If you can imagine like a VR version of Garry's Mod, I guess,

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:15.000
but with like a lot of...

02:20:15.000 --> 02:20:20.000
It's just fucking a weird game that I really need to play on the stream.

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
Oh, Esther Jones under Matt says,

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
I'm hoping to get a new PC gaming headset.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
You know what I should be looking for if I can find a good deal?

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
A new mechanical keyboard.

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:32.000
Because my current one, I spilled something on it like a dummy and now it's all fucked up.

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
And then I keep looking at Alan's.

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:35.000
Alan's keyboard is nicer than mine.

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:36.000
I want a new mechanical keyboard.

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:37.000
So maybe that...

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:41.000
If I can find a really good deal on one of those, I might be talked into it.

02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:42.000
So we'll see.

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:45.000
Anything else on Prime Day?

02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:46.000
Things you gotta have?

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:47.000
I'll be curious.

02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:51.000
You know, Twitch is doing this whole thing for Prime Day.

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:52.000
So I'll be very curious.

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
I'll probably be watching some of that.

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
They're really pushing people to co-stream it.

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:59.000
Because of course, you know, they want people to know about the sales and stuff like that.

02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:03.000
Which I sadly don't have the time to be participating in that.

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:07.000
But I'll be curious to see what other people are doing with it.

02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:10.000
And how everybody tries to make coin off of Prime Day.

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
I'll be very curious about that.

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:13.000
So.

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:14.000
Dar2C in chat says,

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:15.000
I feel you.

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:17.000
I messed up my old wireless keyboard.

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:19.000
Had to hit up Goodwill for a replacement.

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:20.000
Yep.

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:21.000
Djurama S says,

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:23.000
Corsair is having some great sales on keyboards currently.

02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:25.000
I'll have to look into that.

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:26.000
I really will.

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:31.000
It just so happens that like everything I have right now is Razer.

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:34.000
And it's not out of some brand loyalty or something like that.

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:35.000
It's just a weird coincidence.

02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:36.000
But I'm open.

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:39.000
A good keyboard is a good keyboard at the end of the day, right?

02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:40.000
So.

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:41.000
Alright.

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:42.000
Well.

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:43.000
I guess that's it.

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:45.000
Yeah, there's not really anything else.

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.000
Yeah, it was kind of a slower news week.

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.000
And I think we made the most of it though.

02:21:49.000 --> 02:21:50.000
So there you go.

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:53.000
But we do invite you guys, of course, to always send us an email.

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:57.000
If there's something we didn't talk about on the show tonight that you want to send us an email for, you can do that.

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:58.000
Over at.

02:21:58.000 --> 02:21:59.000
Oh, I was going to.

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:03.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send your email.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:04.000
Yes, your thought.

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
I was going to ask you if you had played the.

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
Because I haven't played it yet.

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
The Dr. Mario game that they put out in mobile.

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:11.000
Actually, yes, I did.

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:12.000
Just a little bit.

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:13.000
I haven't gotten past.

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.000
I think the tutorial is like the first 20 levels or something like that.

02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:17.000
And I'm not even past that yet.

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:18.000
But I did download it.

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
And I'm tinkering with it.

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:21.000
We'll say that.

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000
It's interesting because the pills go up, not down.

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:24.000
I thought that was interesting.

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:27.000
And it's not like it's not like the old Dr. Mario game.

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:31.000
I mean, the match for concept or whatever is like the old Dr. Mario game.

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:34.000
But it's it's different.

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:38.000
And I can also see where it's probably going to get annoying with the money asking later on and all that stuff.

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:39.000
All right. Yeah.

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:43.000
Fifth dream today in our chat says the Dr. Mario game is trash.

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:45.000
I haven't heard a lot of good things about it.

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:46.000
I thought it was pretty fun.

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:47.000
It's got the music in it.

02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000
Yeah, it was.

02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:50.000
I thought was fun.

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:53.000
But it reminds me too much of that Sailor Moon game.

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:56.000
That puzzle Sailor Moon game.

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:57.000
Gotcha.

02:22:57.000 --> 02:22:58.000
All right.

02:22:58.000 --> 02:22:59.000
And some mixed reviews.

02:22:59.000 --> 02:23:01.000
DJ Romas says it's pretty good for what it is.

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:04.000
So Sailor Moon drops is what you're trying to think of.

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
Also says DJ Romas.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:07.000
All right.

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:11.000
Well, I think it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought and wrap up for the week.

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.000
So let's go around and get some final thoughts.

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
Dark Sakura, you want to start us off tonight?

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:16.000
Which final thought?

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:17.000
Oh, actually, sorry.

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.000
Before you do that, I should, as I always do, plug.

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:23.000
Thank you for listening to Orange Lawns Radio, be it on the podcast feed or live on Twitch.

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:24.000
We really appreciate the support.

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:27.000
And if you enjoyed what you heard here, please tell a friend about the show.

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:30.000
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:35.000
But if the voices aren't here live, you know, we get we have an empty Discord.

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
So help us spread the word.

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:40.000
Also, auto hosts on Twitch goes so far.

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:46.000
Even if you're not like a streamer yourself, your friends still might follow you and be curious about the stuff you're hosting.

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:49.000
So auto hosts are the bomb dot com.

02:23:49.000 --> 02:23:50.000
And that's a new thing I'm really trying to push.

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:53.000
So please consider VOG Network on your auto host list.

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000
OK, now Dark Sakura, your final thought.

02:23:55.000 --> 02:24:03.000
I'm a little worried about this link that Brad gave us in chat for getting the TurboGrafx-16 mini on U.S. Amazon.

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:07.000
Because it doesn't have anything on there, any alerts or anything.

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:15.000
Whereas on Konami's website, if you go in to find the TurboGrafx mini, it links you to the Japanese Amazon page.

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:20.000
Because it only has links to the U.K. and Italian pages. No links to the U.S. one.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:25.000
So I'm wondering if it might be because it's already after midnight there.

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:26.000
Yeah, I think so.

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:30.000
And the link hasn't gone live. But even so, it's linked over to the Japanese site.

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:33.000
Only link. No matter which of those pages you're on.

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:37.000
I'll just try manually looking for it like two minutes after nine o'clock.

02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:38.000
If they sell out.

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:39.000
No, it says midnight Pacific.

02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000
Oh, it's midnight Pacific. Oh, OK.

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:42.000
So that's when Prime Day starts.

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:48.000
If they're not up when I go there to load it in two minutes after the fact, then it just wasn't meant to be.

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:51.000
And I will deal with that fact for the rest of my life.

02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:53.000
I don't think they're going to sell out.

02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000
I don't think so either. TurboGrafx doesn't have that.

02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:59.000
To video game fans, like nerds, super nerds like us, yes.

02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:02.000
But I just don't think they're going to have that same wide appeal.

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
That's what people said about other ones.

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:05.000
I guess that's true. That's true.

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:08.000
But I am going to. You know what? But here's the thing.

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:13.000
I think it's more dark soccer. Like if I can't get one, I'm not going to upset myself over it.

02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:14.000
I'm not going to. If I get one.

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:17.000
Yeah. Nice surprise.

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:20.000
And also, you have a TurboGrafx. So, you know, I don't know.

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:21.000
I'm talking to her.

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:25.000
And well, and I'm also going to tell for why we are who is saying East Coast is screwed.

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:31.000
I think that the Prime Day starts specifically, though, for your region, I want to say.

02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:37.000
So for you on the East Coast, it might be going live in 30 minutes.

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:41.000
I would check it out. Well, then that would suck for us because then they all get to grab it first.

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:45.000
But I'm going to sit and take a look. I'm going to wait until nine o'clock if you don't let me hang out.

02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:47.000
That's fine. Yeah. I'm still going to check, too. Yeah.

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:51.000
So fine by me. If Alan gets back from the gym, maybe we can go.

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:59.000
It's not. Oh, so on there is saying it's three o'clock Eastern is what S.H.A. 100 Matt is saying.

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:02.000
Y.Y.R. in chat says Genesis mini preorders are still open.

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:06.000
Yeah, but that's the genesis. And it was a crap machine.

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:12.000
The mini was. Well, the new one, there's the new one that is doing not that because the old ones were done by a different company.

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:16.000
We'll see. All right. But at any rate, I'm going to hang around and then I'm going to go home.

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:20.000
That's fine. All right. So, Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:25.000
My final thought was I need to play some laser tag. We should play some laser tag.

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:30.000
I'd actually be down. I made the think of something. Maybe there's something we can.

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:35.000
I know. I see. I thought about like, you know, getting a GoPro or something for that.

02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:42.000
But like what I really wanted to do was the state fair started this weekend and they had the Nintendo thing.

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:48.000
But it's gone. Today was last day. Oh, they have. They're doing some weird like gaming thing this year.

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:53.000
So like e-sports is like a big the state fair is really trying to cater to other stuff.

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:57.000
I got to applaud. They're really thinking outside the box of the way people in because I got the thing that I want to go.

02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:02.000
They have an entire like hall that's dedicated to selfie stations.

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:06.000
So they have all these like awesome artwork that is intended for you to take selfies in front of.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:13.000
And I'm all about that kind of vanity. So I'm going to I want to go to the state fair to see the selfie stations.

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:20.000
But if the gaming thing is out and about and around, I would definitely check that out, too, just because I like video games.

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:23.000
Yeah. But yeah, that's the thing. That's the thing they're doing this year.

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:33.000
All right. I guess that's just me. My final thought. My final thought is I may I don't know because it's being very last minute work.

02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:40.000
I may go out of town next week. So if there isn't they told me that I would fly on Monday if I go.

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:48.000
But if something happens and there isn't a show next week, it's because I went out of town for work and day job comes first.

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:55.000
That's that's that. So if push came to shove, though, I'm sure Loki would dance on DDR or dark soccer would do a full hour or something.

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:59.000
So you never know. Maybe I'll finally get around to playing how to full boyfriend holiday star.

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:04.000
No, you know what I would do? I'm going to play some fucking laser tag.

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:09.000
That's right. You just say bye. I'm going to L.R. and then go play laser. I'm just going to play laser tag. Hell yeah.

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:15.000
Hell yeah. All right. That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio. Thank you guys so much for listening to the show this week.

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:21.000
We appreciate you guys very much. Have a great week gaming. I'll try to get some Mario maker levels for you all to play.

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:23.000
So take care, guys. Good night.

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:54.000
Of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio or Vogue Network, but you know, they were all still true.

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:57.000
See you next week.

02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:29.000
The.
