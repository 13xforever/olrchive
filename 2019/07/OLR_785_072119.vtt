Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:22.000
This week Google clarifies that Stadia's Pro subscription gives you an ever-growing library of games, a direct comparison to Xbox Live Gold, PlayStation Plus, and Nintendo Switch Online.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
The more things change, the more things stay the same, just like this episode of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.000 --> 00:45.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio Live once again tonight with episode number 785 for this July the 21st of 2019.

00:45.000 --> 00:56.000
My name is Rob Roberts joining you here in our lovely studio N7 based in Sacramento, California and with me as always for the past 785 weeks.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.000
Give or take. Say hello to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Sup.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Not on camera tonight because she doesn't want to be.

01:03.000 --> 01:16.000
Well I can be on camera. I've got very nice makeup today although I am, well I'll just go ahead and say I'm fighting off what may possibly be a staph infection on my face.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Yikes.

01:17.000 --> 01:27.000
Because I punch too many people in blood splatter, you know, it carries pathogens and, you know, either that or I have the flesh eating bacteria, you know.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Well I hope it's not that. I hope you didn't bring that into my house.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
No.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Give it to my cat.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
I didn't.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Alright.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
I washed my hands before I, you know, harassed your cat against his will.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
Good, good. I'm glad you are exercising good hygiene.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
Hi.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
We'll talk, there you go. I love it when you say hello to the listeners there.

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
Also I'm going to have different hair coming Thursday.

01:47.000 --> 01:51.000
Good. Because we do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of the Geeks Network.

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
vognetwork.com. 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
And although I gave you the main website there, vognetwork.com.

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
It's just going to take you over to our Twitch channel which of course is twitch.tv slash vognetwork.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
So there it is.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
And of course who you do see on camera, Techmaster Loki right over there.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
Hello.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
Hi, how are you?

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
I'm good.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
I heard you did laser tag the sequel today.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Yes.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
More laser. I actually saw the laser tag place.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
I was out over there. Oh God, I was, okay, this is funny.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.000
I was with my Ingress buddies.

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
Yeah.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
But we weren't playing Ingress, we were playing Harry Potter, Wizards Unite.

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
And we were over there at the little restaurant that's like right across the street.

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
And we saw the laser. Oh, that's the place Loki's talking about.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Yes.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Yeah. So it looks, it does look new. It looks fancy and new.

02:37.000 --> 02:45.000
And it is funny because there's, um, the packs in there, instead of having like numbers and colors to remember, they have names to them.

02:45.000 --> 02:52.000
And so all the names are like, you know, like just generic call sign names, but one of them is Loki that I found out.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
So I was like, I'm picking that one.

02:55.000 --> 03:01.000
And then that one ended up sucking. So then I just picked a different one the next time, but I got the one game as Loki.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
That's funny.

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
How do you feel that you're getting a new Marvel TV series named after you?

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
I don't know if you heard the name.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Oh yeah, I'm totally down.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Yeah.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Yeah.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
I wish you'd pick a damn font.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Now all of them.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Wait, wait, wait.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
Dark soccer is the one that actually like went to school to do design.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Did you see the logo for the new Loki show?

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Cause you know, they're doing a new Loki show, Marvel show.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Yeah, I saw it.

03:21.000 --> 03:28.000
I, it makes sense actually, because when you have a character who is a shape shifter and takes different aspects.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.000
Why do you have to bring logic and reason into this?

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
It is a legitimately good design choice.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Why can't you be hateful like the rest of us on the internet?

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Comic Sans is shit.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Papyrus is shit.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Okay.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
And if you use them, you should be ashamed.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Unless you're dyslexic.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Cause actually Comic Sans is good for dyslexic people.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Okay.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Okay.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
I learned something today.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
The more you know.

03:48.000 --> 03:53.000
Although I always, every time there's this font out there called Comic Papyrus and it always makes me think of dark soccer.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
I'm always like, what mug am I going to make?

03:55.000 --> 04:00.000
There is one I downloaded on purpose that was absolutely hilarious called Comic Slab.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
You know what a slab serif is?

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
Like it's the Western font with the big thick.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Oh, like a wanted poster or something?

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Kind of. Yeah.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Those are, those are called slab serifs.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Okay.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
And so there's someone made one called Comic Slab.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
It is fucking hilarious.

04:15.000 --> 04:21.000
You know, uh, Bobby and I have been chatting about trying to make sure the merchandise stuff starts happening before we get out to Dragon Con.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Hope I'm not saying too much.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Oops.

04:23.000 --> 04:31.000
But I do think it would be hilarious to get a vog network mug that's, or something, something maybe about like dark soccer, but it's actually written in Comic Papyrus.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Something like that.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Who do I have to murder?

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Only her name. All the other ones.

04:38.000 --> 04:42.000
Yeah. Oh yeah. That'd be like, like I could have like a pretty Rob Roberts mug.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
Y'all are going to be Helvetica. Boring as shit. And I get to be extra.

04:46.000 --> 04:50.000
But, but versatile. And you will get to be Papyrus.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
I'm going to cut a bitch.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
All right. Anyway.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
Uh, we're here to talk over the next, uh.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
About fonts. It's all font talk tonight.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
Isn't that fun? Fun and Fonzie free.

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
Um, anyway, we're going to actually talk about video games for a little while.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
So tonight's going to be a little different. It's actually a shorter show tonight.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
We have planned, usually we do like two and a half, three hours.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
I am going to be honest. Tonight is going to be a little bit shorter.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
So here's why. Here's what happened.

05:14.000 --> 05:21.000
Um, I got like kind of very short notice on Monday at my day job that they need me to go on a trip, uh, tomorrow.

05:21.000 --> 05:26.000
So I am going to be going out to Chicago, uh, which is funny because I go there for personal stuff.

05:26.000 --> 05:32.000
Cause Alan and I have friends out there, but just ironic, uh, work has an affiliated group out there too.

05:32.000 --> 05:36.000
So I'm going to be heading out to Chicago, uh, for that and, uh, working.

05:36.000 --> 05:40.000
So I'll be there Monday through Friday, but because of that, I have a seven 30 flight in the morning,

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
which means I have to be at the airport on a Monday morning at five.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
So you see why we have to end the show a little earlier than we usually do tonight.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
Cause, uh, I got to get up at like four 30 tomorrow.

05:49.000 --> 05:54.000
And of course I still have to finish packing cause you know, that's a thing too.

05:54.000 --> 06:04.000
So anyway, hopefully y'all understand, but, uh, you know, I'm looking forward to, uh, the trip, but it's just, you know, uh, so much other stuff going on.

06:04.000 --> 06:10.000
So, and I'm trying to get some game playing done in there, but we'll talk a little bit about that as we start off.

06:10.000 --> 06:15.000
How was your gaming week? We like to talk a little bit about the types of games that we've been playing this week.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.000
So Darzagra, how was your gaming week?

06:17.000 --> 06:22.000
Also for the sake of the chat room, I posted a link to my mentor, Steve Mahalo's blog.

06:22.000 --> 06:27.000
Didn't we have him on the show once? Yeah, we did. We did, um, the Flom game. Yeah. Yeah. I remember that.

06:27.000 --> 06:34.000
Um, so anyway, I posted, uh, that, but if you look up mahalo.com and then look up comic slab, you'll find the article about it.

06:34.000 --> 06:43.000
Um, so I downloaded a game that I didn't get a chance to play, but I will be talking hopefully about it later in the show.

06:43.000 --> 06:48.000
Let me check the show roll. Um, yeah, I will be talking about it later in the show, so I won't say anything yet.

06:48.000 --> 06:57.000
Um, I've been playing Pokemon go. I've been playing Harry Potter. I've been, I'm still playing idle pouring, but now it's out of spite.

06:57.000 --> 07:04.000
So I'm hate playing it. Um, and not really a whole bunch else.

07:04.000 --> 07:11.000
Like Dan and I have been like obsessed with watching, uh, just, uh, uh, live streams of pinball lately.

07:11.000 --> 07:20.000
So, um, the new, the star Wars home edition got released and we were watching a dead flip, uh, that guy play it.

07:20.000 --> 07:26.000
His last name is danger and I don't remember his first name. Um, he's a cool dude though. Um, but we were watching him play it.

07:26.000 --> 07:31.000
People are giving all kinds of crap for it. You know, Oh, it's a home version. It's missing all the stuff. The screen is small.

07:31.000 --> 07:40.000
I'm like, dude, for what you get for the money, if you've got four grand to drop, it's not bad for a starter table for a home for something brand new.

07:40.000 --> 07:46.000
Just saying. Um, but at any rate, um, and I played a little bit of theater magic and I played a little bit of twilight zone.

07:46.000 --> 07:52.000
I've mostly been in pinball mode. So ever since I was a young girl, I played the silver ball.

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
There's nothing wrong with being in pinball mode. A friend came over today though.

07:56.000 --> 08:03.000
And it was the first time she'd ever in person seen a pinball table. I'm like, how she's like, wow.

08:03.000 --> 08:10.000
I was like, here, you want to play? She's like, I don't want to break it. Friend never get taken to like a Chuck E Cheese or a pizza.

08:10.000 --> 08:15.000
That's what she said today. Wow. I'm like, you can play if you want to all break it.

08:15.000 --> 08:21.000
I'm like, you should see the way these guys play it. Use them. Shake the table. Yeah. The fine art of not tilting.

08:21.000 --> 08:28.000
So anyway, um, so yeah. Has anyone out there in chat ever like not seen a pinball table?

08:28.000 --> 08:33.000
Like now I'm fascinated by this concept of like, it's okay. I'm not asking to make fun of you.

08:33.000 --> 08:38.000
I just, I'm so curious. Uh, and of course we do tape live over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

08:38.000 --> 08:42.000
And that's where you can join our chat room if you want to give feedback on the show or what have you.

08:42.000 --> 08:49.000
And Bobby Blackwell says, even I don't like shaking pinball tables. Yeah, I don't, I don't like to do it too, but I'm more afraid of the tilt.

08:49.000 --> 08:55.000
I slap them. That's the most I'll do. I'll slap them. Well, I have this picture saved and I'll put it up first.

08:55.000 --> 09:02.000
You can see it, but I, I took a picture of the, of the almost tilt, like the danger for black night, um, sort of rage.

09:02.000 --> 09:10.000
And it's really cool cause it's the night looking thing. It says danger. It was really cool. Um, but one last point about pinball, one little point.

09:10.000 --> 09:19.000
Did you know that apparently, and I need someone in the UK to tell me this for sure, but apparently pinball table is the preferred way to refer to it instead of pinball machine.

09:19.000 --> 09:26.000
But also, and I'm sure as Bobby can attest, a lot of us in the South or from the South called a pinball table too.

09:26.000 --> 09:33.000
I've heard both. I didn't really, it's not, it's not like a pop and soda thing. Like I will not call it pop. In the South it's a coke.

09:33.000 --> 09:41.000
And it's pronounced coke. Pop sounds like it's bubble gum. I hate that. That's like, that's like how some people really have an aversion to the word.

09:41.000 --> 09:52.000
Bobby says the pinball coke, the pinball coke, the Coca Cola pinball. But at any, at any rate, um, you know, one of Dan's friends asked him if I was from Europe because I said pinball table.

09:52.000 --> 10:00.000
Oh, interesting. Yeah. I'm like, no, but I'll move there because this country's kind of shit right now. Right. So anyway, anyway, I'm done.

10:00.000 --> 10:11.000
All right. Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week? Um, I didn't play a whole lot. I just played or I worked a little bit on my game actually, um, coding it and stuff, but they get a whole ton done.

10:11.000 --> 10:18.000
Cause I was, I've been pretty exhausted this week. I started like a new, this like exercise challenge thing at work.

10:18.000 --> 10:29.000
So we've been doing these like high intensity, like you were talking about this because you had that whole bacon pizza the other week and you were like, it's my last meal to gain a bunch of weight that I can lose really fast on the work challenge.

10:29.000 --> 10:38.000
Yes, exactly. So you were gaming the system already. Exactly. So, um, sort of, I'm down six pounds from when I ate that pizza.

10:38.000 --> 10:44.000
So, but that's all like waterway. It goes up and down all the time, but I haven't exercised more. So I have been playing a little bit of Pokemon go.

10:44.000 --> 10:55.000
Um, I can't find my charger for my gotcha. It's somewhere amongst my desk of junk right now. Um, so I haven't been playing too much Pokemon go, but a little bit.

10:55.000 --> 11:05.000
And now that I've been walking and actually starting to run a little bit, which I hate running, but I do it anyways. Um, so I've been playing a little bit of that.

11:05.000 --> 11:14.000
And what else? That's pretty much it. I was going, I was interested in picking up Marvel ultimate alliance three this weekend.

11:14.000 --> 11:25.000
Um, but I was a GameStop and then they're like, well, we don't have when you can buy a digital copy from us. I'm like, why the fuck would I do that when I could just buy a digital copy through the switch?

11:25.000 --> 11:34.000
I don't know what, why I would do that, sir. Help us be relevant still, please, sir. Like, well, you're not going to be a five because there's only two locations that have it nearby.

11:34.000 --> 11:50.000
I'm like, there's like other stores, stupid. I mean like, I don't know. It's just silly, but I had to like look around because my son likes to spend like 40 minutes and they're playing the stupid demo for like the crash remaster or the Spyro remaster games.

11:50.000 --> 11:58.000
I'm like, you know, we can just pick these up at home or like he's playing Zelda. I'm like, we have the full game at home. Why are you playing the demo?

11:59.000 --> 12:07.000
But he likes doing that. So, um, I was looking to pick it up, but I ended up not doing that. So, um, I didn't play a whole lot.

12:07.000 --> 12:24.000
By the time I got to actually play Mario Maker 2, my kids wanted to take the switch away from me again. Plus, as we'll get into it later, the controllers are all jacked up and I was blaming them for it because, you know, they don't take care of electronics, but I'm starting to wonder if it's not their fault.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
It may not be.

12:26.000 --> 12:35.000
All right. Well, we'll get into that in a minute then, but first a little bit on my gaming week, although sadly mine hasn't been quite as exciting either because Final Fantasy 14.

12:35.000 --> 12:40.000
I mean, that has just been my game of choice. So when I am gaming, I'm still trying to make my way through the story there.

12:40.000 --> 12:47.000
And I think I'm up to like level 76 in the story quest. So I think I'm about halfway done with the expansion and I am still really enjoying it.

12:47.000 --> 12:53.000
But you know, there's a lot else for me to share with you that I haven't shared on a previous episode, but I am still making my way in Final Fantasy 14.

12:54.000 --> 13:02.000
Survivor, fakie survivor online, still going. I'm still in it, y'all. Believe it or not, we're down to how many people are left?

13:02.000 --> 13:08.000
13 out of 2022 started and 13 are in it and your boy's one of them. So I'm really, I'm pumped about that.

13:08.000 --> 13:17.000
Although, yeah, I can't say too much about strategic or things like that, but all I can say is like there was a swap that happened just a little bit ago.

13:17.000 --> 13:21.000
And okay, you guys will get a kick out of this. So do you guys want to know what they do for like challenges?

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Yeah.

13:22.000 --> 13:30.000
These types of games? Okay. So we had to sign on on Thursday night and into a Google Hangout and they didn't tell us what the challenge was going to be.

13:30.000 --> 13:43.000
But they said it would be very helpful for you to know about these topics in advance. You need to know about Calvin Coolidge, Spandex, the album Melodrama by Lorde, the Animorphs and like all this stuff.

13:43.000 --> 13:58.000
So we put together this spreadsheet of just like helpful information and articles and things like that because we thought it might be a trivia contest or something, or we thought it might be something where like you have to talk about that subject and improvise it for like a certain period of time.

13:58.000 --> 14:05.000
And if you can't do it, you're out type of thing. And sure enough, we get on the call and they say, okay, in 10 minutes, we are starting the filibuster challenge.

14:06.000 --> 14:20.000
You will have to talk about these topics as a tribe as long as you possibly can. When you are talking, you must have two hands up in the air so that we know you aren't just looking at more information to keep reading and your time begins in 10 minutes.

14:20.000 --> 14:31.000
And so we, you know, we start opening up as many of the fact articles that we can as we get through. And sure enough, here's, here's the crazy part. So one of the topics was squash.

14:31.000 --> 14:37.000
And so we were like, well, does that mean squash the vegetable or you want us to talk about squash the game?

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
Or squash is also a drink.

14:39.000 --> 14:53.000
Right. And squash is also like a verb, right? So they said, as long as you are talking about squash, it counts. And we were like, oh, so our tribe spent on one, on milk.

14:53.000 --> 14:57.000
We spent two hours talking about fucking milk.

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Did you talk about Harvey Milk too?

14:59.000 --> 15:05.000
You bet your ass I talked about Harvey Milk and I talked about Milk the Drag Queen from season six of RuPaul's Drag Race.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
Did the topic of Milk Money, the movie come up?

15:08.000 --> 15:13.000
No, no, but somebody talked about Milk Money by Fergie.

15:13.000 --> 15:23.000
And that was that because the video involved milk or something. And what I thought was pretty brilliant, too, is we had two coffee people that had worked in coffee places.

15:23.000 --> 15:31.000
We had one Starbucks and one Dunkin Donuts. And so they both like talked for like probably easily 20, 30 minutes each about here's all the milk drinks on our menu.

15:31.000 --> 15:36.000
And in this one, you get four pumps of milk. And in this one you get and it was just like frothing it on and on and on.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.000
Yes. That sounds like fun, actually.

15:38.000 --> 15:45.000
So, yeah, actually. And, you know, like the minute I heard the challenge in my head, I was like, we got this. We're going to fucking win this.

15:45.000 --> 15:54.000
So their tribe on this, no, it was seven topics, I'm sorry, because there were seven people on each of them, but their tribe went for three and a half hours talking about seven topics.

15:54.000 --> 16:04.000
Ours went for five hours and 20 minutes. And at the end of the call, so like you were allowed to leave the call, but it's like that's less people to banter with.

16:04.000 --> 16:14.000
So the last two topics we had were the album Melodrama by Lorde. And it was just me and one guy on the call and then I had the Animorphs because we each chose like one we were going to talk about.

16:14.000 --> 16:23.000
So the guy that was on the tribe that did Melodrama by Lorde just starts like reading all of the lyrics, you know.

16:23.000 --> 16:30.000
I don't even remember the lyrics at this point, but it's like, I'm waiting for it. That green light. I want it.

16:30.000 --> 16:37.000
He's just reading the lyrics, like really monotone. And then when the Animorphs came up, okay, this is something I learned.

16:37.000 --> 16:41.000
There are 54 fucking books in the Animorphs series. So this is how it went for me.

16:41.000 --> 16:48.000
I would like to talk to you now about the Animorphs. Book number one in the Animorphs series was called The Visitor.

16:48.000 --> 16:58.000
And it was written by K.A. Applegate. And the barcode number if you want to look up this book on Amazon is ISBN 012.

16:58.000 --> 17:06.000
I did that 54 times for each and every book. I talked a goddamn hour about this fucking book series I've never read in my life.

17:06.000 --> 17:11.000
What if you read the book? Just read the book out loud.

17:11.000 --> 17:17.000
Let me tell you, if there was ever hope that I was going to read that book, this challenge we did like fucking ruined it for me.

17:17.000 --> 17:22.000
No man, just like as a strategy, just read the book.

17:22.000 --> 17:29.000
Oh my God. I love it. Sia Tabiri in chat is like, did you mention all the Megamorphs and the Andalite Chronicles?

17:29.000 --> 17:34.000
I fucking know what the Andalite Chronicles are now because of that fucking challenge. It's like, I actually get the joke.

17:34.000 --> 17:44.000
It's like, ugh. But anyway, so we won. And that was, yeah, I know it's silly, but it was actually like, it's kind of one of those like, I can't believe I did that sort of like fun things.

17:44.000 --> 17:50.000
So I don't know, like that's the fun. But yeah, so that's how I spent five hours on Thursday night talking about fucking milk and the Animorphs.

17:50.000 --> 18:00.000
Anyway, SSG100Matt says, what the hell? Does this have a podcast or something? I feel as though it should have a Talking Dead style post-show.

18:01.000 --> 18:12.000
I heard that they do like YouTube stuff that recap, like the people that are watching it have like YouTube stuff that they do, but obviously they don't share it with us.

18:12.000 --> 18:21.000
We can't see it, but apparently at the end of the game, we'll be able to see it all and know like all the shit people were talking about us and who was liked and who wasn't liked and all that.

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
So it's interesting. So yeah.

18:24.000 --> 18:28.000
I can't wait for the eight hours of all the filibuster stuff.

18:28.000 --> 18:36.000
Well, yeah, I'm not going to, I mean, if they record, I think they did record it. If they recorded it, maybe Bobby will let me play it on VOG one Saturday.

18:39.000 --> 18:46.000
I'd have to get permission from all around. That's not, that's not fair to everybody involved, but I bet they'd think it's funny. So I don't know. Anyway.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.000
Should have them on the show.

18:48.000 --> 18:53.000
Right. I should, I should get a bunch of these guys that play these things and do like these silly challenges, like live.

18:53.000 --> 19:00.000
I've actually kind of talked about this, like doing like a game show night type of thing here with, with some of these people that sign up to do things for free. I think would be fun.

19:00.000 --> 19:04.000
So anyway. All right. So I have one last little thing.

19:04.000 --> 19:18.000
Yeah, please. I'm planning on doing not a web comic, but a web story where they're just little snippets of dialogue, kind of home stuckish, just without the pictures about a person who moves into a haunted house.

19:18.000 --> 19:25.000
And the ghost is then exposed to modern culture and modern technology and starts a blog.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Would anyone read it?

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
No, nobody's going to read it. I'm sorry to say.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
Well, I wasn't asking you.

19:30.000 --> 19:35.000
Of course, people in chatter. You got to, you got to do the thing for people to read the thing. Remember that.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.000
Well then.

19:36.000 --> 19:44.000
That's what I tell, that's what I tell people who's tell me I want to do a podcast. I'm like, great, do a podcast because you got to do the podcast for people to hear the podcast.

19:44.000 --> 19:50.000
Well, I'm just putting it out there. Um, so look for something, uh, in the next few weeks.

19:50.000 --> 19:56.000
Sounds good. Um, as far as my gaming week goes, I mean, otherwise, uh, there's no, it's fine. There's not really a lot else for me to talk about.

19:56.000 --> 20:08.000
I guess Pokemon go. I haven't played Pokemon go in a long time, but I was encouraged to check it out again this week because they did this quality of life update that has changed everything.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
I didn't notice.

20:09.000 --> 20:17.000
It's the appraisals. They totally changed the appraisals. So now when you go in, it actually, you don't have to use one of those third party apps to look at the numbers anymore.

20:17.000 --> 20:22.000
As long as you know, like where 15 is on the bar and 14 and 13 you get a visual representation.

20:22.000 --> 20:29.000
And so you can tell right there. And it also gives it stars. This is a zero star flop Pokemon. This is a one star, not so great Pokemon and so on and so on.

20:29.000 --> 20:35.000
Um, up to four stars is a perfect Pokemon. Here's the best part. And this is like a game changer for me.

20:35.000 --> 20:40.000
So somebody like me who is hoarding like 2000 Pokemon and haven't had a problem choosing which ones to get rid of.

20:40.000 --> 20:47.000
Um, I can now just search zero star, like the asterisk, and it will show me, here are all your garbage Pokemon.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
And I was like, great recycle, recycle, recycle, recycle.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.000
Like as long as it wasn't something super rare.

20:53.000 --> 21:01.000
I run a living Pokedex. So for me, not really so much. The only ones I care about, the ones I actually use a lot, like my riparian and all those.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Which, by the way, I got a shiny Mudkip today.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
Oh, yeah, cause the community event is going like right now.

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Yeah, there's like four in the house right now.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.000
I should see if there's any shinies.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.000
Um, gonna catch me some more Mudkips.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
Just because I did not get a chance to play today.

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
I heard you like Mudkips.

21:15.000 --> 21:21.000
And, uh, there's obviously like a lot of people that were not able to do it because we're having this huge heatwave in the US right now.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
And I was seeing that on our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
It was nice today though.

21:25.000 --> 21:30.000
Well, here in California, but like out in New York, Chicago, like the Northeast, it's like 100.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
And in the South too. Mama was saying.

21:32.000 --> 21:38.000
Yeah, it's really bad out there. So that's not fun for them right now. So I feel for them, I gotta say.

21:38.000 --> 21:43.000
So, yeah, I'm actually shiny checking live on air. I only see two on the house, but neither are shiny for me.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.000
Actually four. I'd like to get a second shiny to evolve it.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
Ugh, oh well. Just my luck.

21:48.000 --> 21:54.000
Yeah, and SG100Matt in our chat says, yeah, the zero star thing is key. Absolutely. I'm so freaking excited about that.

21:54.000 --> 21:57.000
And then I played Harry Potter, Wizards Unite. I'm still going on that.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
We hit level 20. I did the community day yesterday. I should say that.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
I did the Harry Potter community day yesterday.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
Oh.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.000
So, uh, we went.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.000
Some of this work.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
Well, it was a Saturday, so I work Monday through Friday, okay?

22:08.000 --> 22:13.000
So, um, it was, uh, we walked down to the Capitol where you would usually do Pokemon community day, right?

22:13.000 --> 22:21.000
Um, except as you can imagine, not nearly as many people out and about as would be on a normal Pokemon community day.

22:21.000 --> 22:25.000
It was a lot of tourists. I saw some kids doing a scavenger hunt type thing.

22:25.000 --> 22:29.000
And once in a while I'd catch another group where I was like, oh, you guys must be playing.

22:29.000 --> 22:33.000
Like they're, they're staring at their phones and there'd be like a couple of the fortresses were lit up green.

22:33.000 --> 22:39.000
So, you know, people were doing them, but for the most part it was, it was maybe like five or 10% of what would be there for Pokemon community day.

22:39.000 --> 22:44.000
But I think it's because most people I talked to about the Harry Potter community day had no idea.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
Like, what is it? What's special about it? What are they going to do?

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
Um, and it was just, it really was just like boosted spawns and more XP.

22:50.000 --> 22:54.000
So I got to level 20 during the community day. So that was cool, I guess.

22:54.000 --> 23:01.000
But, um, yeah, like I got to admit it wasn't as exciting as a Pokemon community day because there wasn't like anything special to get.

23:01.000 --> 23:06.000
Or anything. Yeah. So I, I'm hoping they're still kind of feeling this idea out a little bit.

23:06.000 --> 23:14.000
But, um, at the end of the day, Alan and I just kind of knew we just want to go out and walk around and get exercise and be nerds and play Harry Potter while we're at it.

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
So, you know, the community day was a win in that regard.

23:17.000 --> 23:25.000
But, um, yeah, I think if you felt like you missed something from not doing the event, maybe a small XP boost if that's what you're into.

23:26.000 --> 23:32.000
So, but I will say in the Harry Potter game, what's really flopped for me is the week long event they're doing.

23:32.000 --> 23:38.000
They're doing like a Harry Potter, um, like foundable. I don't remember the actual name, brilliant foundables or something.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.000
They're doing a special event and it's all the little like purple things that come up.

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
I've been all about that.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.000
See, well, here's the problem I have with it.

23:44.000 --> 23:49.000
At the beginning, it was giving you great XP. You would get like 500 XP for everyone you returned.

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
And I was like, heck yeah, this is great. And like it makes it worth doing.

23:52.000 --> 23:56.000
But then they issued a bulletin on like Wednesday or Thursday saying it's giving too much XP.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
We are going to nerf it down to the levels it's supposed to be at.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
So you get like 85 or 90 XP for a trace now.

24:02.000 --> 24:11.000
Which considering how much you can do a green trace on those stupid owls, it will resist like seven out of eight times.

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
And I'm sitting there and you're just burning spell power on these things you're only going to get 90 XP on.

24:15.000 --> 24:20.000
Yeah, but if you throw, um, a potion like right at the start, you'll just get it right away.

24:20.000 --> 24:26.000
Yeah. But once I, once I maxed out those two stickers, I honestly, during the community day, I straight up ignored all the purple.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
You still get, um, SOS, um, achievements for some of them.

24:29.000 --> 24:35.000
So I've been doing every single one just because I'm right now, I think at level 16.

24:35.000 --> 24:39.000
So I'm still working my way up through it because I only really can play at work.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
Well, I'm playing at work.

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
I'm just trying to, you know, kind of focus on the other stuff.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
Like it's kind of like, oh, I finished the event.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
It's always the port keys to get me stuck. And that was honestly,

24:48.000 --> 24:54.000
probably the best thing we got out of community day was actually walking and increasing his port keys.

24:54.000 --> 24:58.000
That's my number one thing I need Harry Potter to get is adventure sync.

24:58.000 --> 25:05.000
I have now learned the exact distance that I have to drive to get all of my, uh, uh, distance in to get my daily achievement.

25:05.000 --> 25:13.000
Watch the video of someone playing, um, the beta for the Minecraft earth stuff, which looks much different than,

25:13.000 --> 25:18.000
so the way they have it, you can actually hit all of the stuff while driving, which is kind of cool.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.000
Um, they actually have it cause it comes, you don't end up in Iraq. Yes.

25:21.000 --> 25:27.000
Well they have just like different things spawn and that's how you get resources to build things, which is kind of cool and craft stuff.

25:27.000 --> 25:33.000
So I don't know. I'm really, I'm waiting for my goddamn email to come in, but it's not coming in.

25:33.000 --> 25:37.000
I haven't checked my, I keep forgetting that's attached to my spam address.

25:37.000 --> 25:42.000
So I have to keep checking that, but I will, I will do that while we start getting into the news here, I think.

25:42.000 --> 25:47.000
One last thing, I forget what the fire breathing chicken is called in Harry Potter cause it makes me laugh every time.

25:47.000 --> 25:51.000
When you catch it, it will tell you XYZ has been returned to the...

25:51.000 --> 25:57.000
Except it shows up with so many other things. Like the one I had, I just did one where you help, uh, Flitwick out.

25:57.000 --> 26:03.000
It doesn't say what the chicken's called and I forgot cause my brain is just not wrapping around it, but it makes me laugh every time.

26:03.000 --> 26:08.000
Cause I call it, in my head, I call it the vicious chicken of Bristol from Monty Python.

26:08.000 --> 26:12.000
Some of the animations in that game are really, uh, really silly, but they're like fun.

26:12.000 --> 26:16.000
I love the ballerina, the giant ballerina. That one's like my, my favorite.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
Oh, that looks like it's like an ogre that's a ballerina or something.

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
Yeah, it's, it makes, there's like so much in this that makes me laugh.

26:21.000 --> 26:26.000
And I also think though, just real quick that they got the characterizations down perfectly.

26:26.000 --> 26:31.000
Like the, the character models look really good and the animations are great.

26:31.000 --> 26:39.000
If you turn your battery saver off, believe it or not, like it looks like it runs like a full 60 frames a second, at least on my iPhone 10.

26:39.000 --> 26:44.000
Like it's, it's really good looking, but I imagine most people turn that battery saver on right away, which I can't say I blame you.

26:44.000 --> 26:51.000
No, I, I don't really have a problem on mine. I mean, I haven't noticed.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
I'm actually scrolling through my emails right now.

26:53.000 --> 26:57.000
Looking at those of you watching on Twitch, like why is Rob on his phone with good fucking reason?

26:57.000 --> 27:02.000
Cause I'm trying to see if I have an email from the, uh, uh, Minecraft.

27:02.000 --> 27:09.000
The AR stuff is really cool. So like the thing that I saw a video of the guy had created a redstone.

27:09.000 --> 27:15.000
It was a redstone timer type thing for racing. So it was all based on pressure plates.

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
And so when you got to the end of the pressure plates, it would stop the timer.

27:18.000 --> 27:30.000
It is kind of like a speedometer almost. And it works in real life because when you're walking on those pressure plates, like in the AR stuff, it actually triggers them, which is kind of cool.

27:30.000 --> 27:38.000
So he actually set it up like real size. He marked out on like a piece of paper, you know, where the pressure plates would be.

27:38.000 --> 27:42.000
So he like kind of put those on the ground so he could actually run from one to the other.

27:42.000 --> 27:49.000
But like in the game, you could see him like running and it's all it's triggering the pressure plates, which is just fucking amazing.

27:49.000 --> 27:56.000
Okay. I'm, I'm super curious. Yeah. Cause I, I read a not so great review about the beta on another website.

27:56.000 --> 28:03.000
Like they made it sound like it's just not what you think it is, but I also find a lot of, you know, especially, and I was especially learning this with the Harry Potter recent release.

28:03.000 --> 28:09.000
Like a lot of people that were writing these reviews on Harry Potter were so quick to just say, ah, it's Pokemon go with a Harry Potter skin.

28:09.000 --> 28:16.000
It's like, no, like if you actually go into the fortress battles and do some of the other stuff, like there's, there's some very distinct differences between the two games.

28:16.000 --> 28:24.000
You know, I get that at its core, it's the same map, you know, that you're used to a Pokemon go and Ingress to be fair and these other things.

28:24.000 --> 28:31.000
But it's just like, I could tell who the lazy reviewers were. So anyway. All right. I think we can move on.

28:31.000 --> 28:36.000
We've talked, we've talked plenty about our gaming weeks. I think we need to get into a lot of mobile phone games that sound like,

28:36.000 --> 28:44.000
but let's get into some of the other news that folks are dealing with this week, including, oh, are you, are you catching? Oh, it's one of the Harry, uh, the special, uh, purple.

28:44.000 --> 28:51.000
That's a dementor. One of the special ones right now. Right. And you, you got it. So good job.

28:51.000 --> 28:55.000
Hopefully. Is that your toy? Cause you need what? You need 12 of the Harry Potter kidditch one.

28:55.000 --> 29:02.000
I've already got all of them. Okay. I just, like I said, I'm catching those cause it was a medium difficulty.

29:02.000 --> 29:12.000
And, um, but I, I kind of wanted to, I know it's really good for our home listeners, but I wanted to put it up on cam so that for people who aren't playing, they kind of get an idea of what I was talking about with the animation.

29:12.000 --> 29:18.000
Sure. That's fair. All right. And remember if you, if you do listen on the podcast fee and of course we love you guys for being here.

29:18.000 --> 29:22.000
Uh, if you head over to our Twitch channel, we do have an archive where you can watch old episodes on demand.

29:22.000 --> 29:28.000
You do have to be a subscriber of the vog network channel in order to have that, which you can do either a low nominal fee.

29:28.000 --> 29:36.000
Um, or if you have Amazon prime, which I think was on everybody's mind this past week with prime day, or perhaps you were, you know, anti prime day, which is understandable too.

29:36.000 --> 29:44.000
Um, then, uh, if you are an Amazon prime person, you can use your free, uh, or you get one free sub a month on Twitch.

29:44.000 --> 29:52.000
So if you consider using it at vog network, you unlock all the old video stuff, not just for OLR, but for Bobby Black Wolf as well, as well as anything in the future.

29:52.000 --> 30:03.000
Some of the specials we've done, if you want to go back and watch the E3 Squeenix press event and that whole thing, you can see all that live and there'll be certainly more to come as well as we start to develop that out, uh, through the year.

30:03.000 --> 30:09.000
So this year has all been all about the move to Twitch and hopefully that's going to continue to grow, um, as we move on.

30:09.000 --> 30:14.000
Anyway, um, let's, I think, move on, uh, to talking about what's going on in the news. Loki.

30:14.000 --> 30:25.000
All right. So as I kind of alluded to earlier, when I was talking about my gaming week and playing on the Switch, been having issues with, uh, my joy cons drifting.

30:25.000 --> 30:30.000
And I always thought it's the kids touching them with their dirty hands, which they do.

30:30.000 --> 30:36.000
They do touch everything with their dirty hands all the time. And so I assumed it was their problem, but apparently it's not.

30:36.000 --> 30:42.000
It's actually a design problem with the actual joy con analog stick itself.

30:42.000 --> 30:47.000
Apparently Nintendo will actually fix them and it doesn't cost too much to do that. Four dollars.

30:47.000 --> 30:53.000
But they also want you to mail your joy cons in and it takes about two weeks to turn around and get them fixed.

30:53.000 --> 30:59.000
Um, I haven't gotten that option yet, but that might be interesting to try that.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
Um, but I don't know if it's going to be a permanent fix.

31:02.000 --> 31:11.000
And people have kind of gone through it and actually looked at, you know, what the issue is and, um, tried cleaning them out, but that doesn't end up fixing them permanently.

31:11.000 --> 31:18.000
So this was kind of brought up in a Kotaku article. They were talking a little bit about different people with issues.

31:18.000 --> 31:23.000
Um, kind of just trying to get all of those stories together.

31:23.000 --> 31:30.000
But it's very interesting to see that this is not something that Nintendo's really addressed aside from, hey, yeah, we'll fix it.

31:30.000 --> 31:38.000
But you would think that since they're putting out new ones now, and I'm almost curious also with the Switch Lite coming out,

31:38.000 --> 31:45.000
if they're using that same analog stick on there, that's a problem because you can't just replace the joy con on there.

31:45.000 --> 31:48.000
You're kind of stuck because it's attached to the system.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
So I'm curious to see what they do with that.

31:50.000 --> 31:57.000
But it's funny because I don't have this problem on my other consoles, like on my Xbox 360.

31:57.000 --> 32:05.000
Occasionally, um, I think some of the analog sticks would die, like completely, but not just drift off to the side.

32:05.000 --> 32:14.000
And that's what we have happen. Like even we were, uh, my son, I guess I was playing the Legend of Zelda demo at the Switch kiosk in the GameStop.

32:14.000 --> 32:22.000
And that joy con was all fucked up. It was just looking straight down the entire time because it was like pushing itself up.

32:22.000 --> 32:30.000
So it's just, it's a real big problem. And I've had even like switching out joy cons because I have two sets of them.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Both of them are doing it now.

32:32.000 --> 32:39.000
And it's not something that I can avoid because who knows what the hell's wrong with it. It's dirt or something in there.

32:39.000 --> 32:44.000
But it sounds like Nintendo may have to answer for this in court, right?

32:44.000 --> 32:48.000
Yeah. So there's going to be probably a class action lawsuit around it.

32:48.000 --> 32:55.000
Um, because I mean, it is something that they're not dressing up front in so much like you would have.

32:55.000 --> 32:59.000
Not so much to the point of like the Xbox 360 and the Red Ring stuff.

32:59.000 --> 33:08.000
But, um, you know, to a smaller extent, this is going to be, this is a widespread problem because there's been so many people who have been affected by it.

33:08.000 --> 33:14.000
Yeah. I have to admit, I don't have this problem whatsoever, but I don't, I'm not like a heavy user of my Switch.

33:14.000 --> 33:18.000
You know, I'll, of course I play it here and there, but I have a pro controller.

33:18.000 --> 33:21.000
So I do a lot of my playing on the, a lot, a lot of my playing on the pro controller.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.000
And it could be though that this pro controller analog sticks are different.

33:24.000 --> 33:31.000
Possibly. You're right. Uh, Questbuster in chat with his perspective saying it won't be permanent if they still use the same stick module.

33:31.000 --> 33:38.000
Someone took one apart a while ago and posted pics and the problem seems to be the graphite pads the rockers move across to generate input.

33:38.000 --> 33:42.000
The problem is that graphite wears down and accumulates debris.

33:42.000 --> 33:49.000
And as J100Matt says, sounds like it's joining in the long line of day one issues, PS2 disc read issues, 360 Red Ring.

33:49.000 --> 33:55.000
Yeah. I mean, it does play station for the analog stick rubber rubbing off. Oh yeah. I remember that too.

33:55.000 --> 34:05.000
That's still like an issue. I think so. I mean, I, I think it'd be great if Nintendo would just maybe have an exchange program or something to just, even if it's just like the basic gray ones, then fine.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
Cause Nintendo is selling now all these new color.

34:08.000 --> 34:13.000
They just announced this week, like Nike at purple and orange and green and yellow or so.

34:13.000 --> 34:17.000
I don't even know if I'm getting the colors right because I gotta be honest. I hate that they mismatch.

34:18.000 --> 34:24.000
I know it's like a trademark thing about the switch is that they mismatch. I can't stand it. That's why I always take my plane.

34:24.000 --> 34:29.000
Why can't they just do like, this is a perfect opportunity.

34:29.000 --> 34:36.000
This is like where Microsoft kind of excels, you know, cause with Microsoft, you can get the custom Xbox one controllers.

34:36.000 --> 34:46.000
And I think, I think it's just Xbox one. I don't remember if they do with the 360, but is custom Xbox one controllers where you can design the colors, the d-pad style, the colors of the buttons.

34:46.000 --> 34:53.000
And you can completely get whatever you want custom to you instead of having the way, Oh, now we're going to lead controller. You can do that.

34:53.000 --> 34:59.000
Yeah. No, even just regular controllers. Yeah. Okay. I think you can do with the elite as well, but you definitely do it with the elite.

34:59.000 --> 35:05.000
I know that's a Microsoft thing. I really though hate the, the green blue comedy, not the green blue, but the green pink for the joy con.

35:05.000 --> 35:11.000
But I do like the red and blue one. The one I have, I think that it looks really, it's kind of like the standard, just the red and blue.

35:11.000 --> 35:17.000
I got both of those. I like the green and pink, but even like the pro controller is different colors on left and right.

35:17.000 --> 35:22.000
But like for me, I can at least write off going, well, it's this platoon theme controller. So it's supposed to be different colors.

35:22.000 --> 35:33.000
Yeah. That's where the green and pink supposed to be from. Yeah. Yeah. So, but yeah, I, uh, I would be very curious to see if Nintendo is going to have to respond to this on a larger level, especially if now they're getting called into court on it now.

35:33.000 --> 35:41.000
Um, you know, I, I'm gonna confess, maybe I'm just naive about this type of stuff, but why can't Nintendo have a firmware thing where you can kind of recalibrate those controllers?

35:41.000 --> 35:48.000
You can, there's always a slight down tilt to it. Can't you just kind of like have that, but here's the problem. It's not all the time.

35:48.000 --> 35:54.000
It's it's intermittent. So it's, it's, it depends on where the debris is inside there.

35:54.000 --> 36:02.000
So one of the ways I've kind of tried to fix stuff is you can blow like compressed air in there to try to like kind of knock it out of the way, but it depends on how it's reading.

36:02.000 --> 36:10.000
And sometimes like you, or like I end up having to shake that controller back and forth a bunch to try to, I guess, knock the debris out of the way.

36:10.000 --> 36:19.000
And then eventually it will kind of fix itself. But if something gets stuck on there, then it'll drift slightly in one direction.

36:19.000 --> 36:27.000
So it's, it's not all the time and yeah, you can recalibrate them and sometimes that helps, but it's not, it's not a solution.

36:27.000 --> 36:34.000
Interesting. SheHulk10 in our chat says, my Joy-Cons disconnect all the time. It sucks and I have terrible lag. So.

36:34.000 --> 36:40.000
We just mostly use our pro controller, but the one that I bought had like a problem with it and it drifts.

36:40.000 --> 36:48.000
That's why I'm thinking I'm not seeing this program or this problem like the way others are because there's very little that I actually use the Joy-Cons for.

36:48.000 --> 36:54.000
Maybe if I'm traveling like tomorrow, I'm going on a plane ride. So if I decide to bring my Switch, which I probably will,

36:54.000 --> 36:58.000
I'll, I'll use the Joy-Cons like attached to the console and play it that way.

36:58.000 --> 37:03.000
But most of the things, like when I'm playing things like Bloodstained or even Splatoon or like,

37:03.000 --> 37:07.000
I can't think of a Switch game that I don't play on the pro controller.

37:07.000 --> 37:14.000
It would be nice. I would even fix them myself if there was a way to like buy something that's a different surface instead of graphite,

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
another material that's not going to break down.

37:16.000 --> 37:22.000
Actually kind of along those lines, you were saying you're playing Bloodstained. Is it any better after they do the patches?

37:22.000 --> 37:26.000
I haven't, to be fair, because of everything else I've been into, I haven't had a chance to try.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Well, if you try while you're out, let me know.

37:28.000 --> 37:32.000
It might be a traveling game because I'm going to be gone. Yeah, I definitely have to bring my Switch because I'm going to be gone for a week.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
So, you know.

37:33.000 --> 37:41.000
Well, Dan and I was telling, you know, Dan and I were looking at the nerfing on it and what they've changed in because they didn't do anything on the PS4 unless it was already like that.

37:41.000 --> 37:45.000
And so I was really curious as to if they fit, what the fix was like for you.

37:46.000 --> 37:51.000
Shane is in our chat, Chad Starzik, saying, I haven't played the Switch in docked mode for months and months.

37:51.000 --> 37:57.000
So joy cons are great to me for an individually customization aspect, which, you know, if that's what works for you, awesome.

37:57.000 --> 38:02.000
But it's very interesting how different people can approach it because, like, honestly, I'm almost exclusively docked mode.

38:02.000 --> 38:06.000
It is really only if I'm traveling is the only time I don't play in docked mode.

38:06.000 --> 38:12.000
And even then, I'm thinking like, can I bring my dock and hook it up to the hotel TV? Like, I should be able to do that, right?

38:12.000 --> 38:13.000
Yeah.

38:13.000 --> 38:18.000
So it's the thoughts probably. Yeah. So anyway.

38:18.000 --> 38:24.000
All right. Well, let's move on and talk about a game that sadly is still not on the Switch, although I think many people are waiting for it.

38:24.000 --> 38:30.000
It's Overwatch. Maybe when they do, you know, there's a lot of rumble that this is something they're going to do for it.

38:30.000 --> 38:40.000
And this is not the story tonight, but there's a lot of rumble that Overwatch 2 or some type of Overwatch spinoff thing is like going to be the big BlizzCon announcement this year with Diablo 4.

38:40.000 --> 38:46.000
Like, Blizzard is in a position where they realized last year did not work, and so they're going to come out swinging this year.

38:46.000 --> 38:55.000
And the rumor is that it's Diablo 4 and a new Overwatch game that will, in fact, as I think I've kind of said on the show before,

38:55.000 --> 39:03.000
focus a little more on some of the PvE things that they've been doing during the holiday events, but make that a little more of like an actual part of the core game.

39:03.000 --> 39:08.000
So anyway, that's all rumors and stuff. We won't know any of that till whenever BlizzCon is, what, September?

39:08.000 --> 39:11.000
I can't even remember when BlizzCon is. September or October? One of those.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
Nothing in November? No.

39:13.000 --> 39:18.000
It may actually be all the way in November, I think you're right. But anyway, we're going to go to something we do know.

39:18.000 --> 39:24.000
Now this is for sure happening for Overwatch, and that is about role locking in Overwatch.

39:24.000 --> 39:32.000
And this all started from a video that had leaked relating to the Overwatch League, and sure enough, the game director, Jeff Kaplan, came out and said,

39:32.000 --> 39:37.000
in the future, players will now queue for specific roles in Overwatch games too.

39:37.000 --> 39:44.000
This is important because historically, the game has given you the freedom to switch to pretty much any hero you want right in the middle of battle,

39:44.000 --> 39:51.000
which is fine for experimentation and finding the characters you like, but when you actually want to win the game,

39:51.000 --> 39:55.000
somebody's got to be a healer, somebody's got to be a tank, and somebody's got to be...

39:55.000 --> 39:59.000
And actually, it's two, two, and two. So you have two tanks, two healers, two DPS.

39:59.000 --> 40:04.000
That's the way things are going to be role locked. And now, when you want to play Quick Play, you say in advance,

40:04.000 --> 40:10.000
I'm signing up to be support. And then when you get in your game, you will be one of the two support people.

40:10.000 --> 40:18.000
And just like happens in many MMOs, including Final Fantasy XIV, I'll tell you the tanks and healers are going to be waiting a hell of a lot less time than the DPS,

40:18.000 --> 40:22.000
which may have longer queues. So this is something they are talking about coming to Quick Play.

40:22.000 --> 40:27.000
Now, there will be exceptions to this, of course, because you can always make your own game mode.

40:27.000 --> 40:32.000
Like if you want to play with friends and you're like, fuck that, I want to do six tanks against six Mercys or something,

40:32.000 --> 40:37.000
you can do whatever you want still in that regard in the arcade. It gives you the freedom to do that.

40:37.000 --> 40:43.000
But this is going to become the new standard, which is what a lot of people play. Why did they make the decision?

40:43.000 --> 40:50.000
They said the more that we can do to keep the pro experience in Overwatch League consistent with the live game experience of Overwatch players,

40:50.000 --> 40:56.000
the better from the Overwatch League perspective, because this is also going to be a change that is going to affect the Overwatch League.

40:56.000 --> 41:02.000
So when they play, they're going to be subject to the same rules, which for the most part they've kind of been doing anyway.

41:02.000 --> 41:12.000
But I think it had been found that like, I think it was a three tank, three healer combination was actually doing really well in some matches.

41:12.000 --> 41:20.000
So they don't want like one particular makeup to be the only way to do it. So they're going to do a two, two, two.

41:20.000 --> 41:29.000
So it will be in quick play, it will be in competitive mode, and you cannot change your roles once the map starts.

41:29.000 --> 41:37.000
Yes, the GOATS meta is three tanks and three supports. So no Widow makers, no tracers, nothing like that.

41:37.000 --> 41:42.000
So Fifth Dream in chat says, fuck roles, I'm tired of being railroaded.

41:42.000 --> 41:53.000
Well, I mean, I don't know, I have to say I'm kind of interested in this simply because nothing bugs me more than going into a map willing to play healer,

41:53.000 --> 42:02.000
and then Moira gets snatched up in the first five seconds. And then somebody else grabs Lucio or Brigitte or something where it's like,

42:02.000 --> 42:08.000
all right, well, I don't want to do three supports. So I guess I'll have to do a DPS. Oh, the DPS just got taken.

42:08.000 --> 42:13.000
Well, I get, I don't want to play a tank. I'm not good at tank. So at least I'll be able to like queue for the maps.

42:13.000 --> 42:19.000
Like I'm going to play this role and, you know, maybe there'll be one other person I have to fight with for Moira,

42:19.000 --> 42:23.000
but at least I'll know, okay, even if the other person picks Moira, I can do Mercy.

42:23.000 --> 42:26.000
I can do Lucio, something that I feel a little more confident with.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
Very well.

42:27.000 --> 42:35.000
It is, it's or MMOs in general, really. It's very much like you're queuing for a dungeon and the dungeon is the Overwatch map.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
And remember, thank your healer.

42:37.000 --> 42:43.000
And based on some of the screenshots, it looked like they were offering rewards for certain roles, like they do in MMOs.

42:43.000 --> 42:48.000
Like in Final Fantasy 14, that's just the one I have a lot of experience with right now.

42:48.000 --> 42:56.000
If like healers are in demand, you will get like bonus materia because they have kind of a, it's not like it wasn't in Final Fantasy 7,

42:56.000 --> 43:02.000
but you get materia and it alters stats on your gear. So it's like you can give yourself like 40 determination or things like that.

43:02.000 --> 43:04.000
It doesn't like teach you spells.

43:04.000 --> 43:09.000
Kind of considering coming back to 14, except I would need help power leveling.

43:09.000 --> 43:16.000
Well, you can do it one of two ways because you can't, you can't really, it's not like, wow, you can't power level people because when you do dungeons, you get synced.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.000
So you can't really power level.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.000
You can buy a potion that just skips you through it all.

43:20.000 --> 43:25.000
But I think, I do think it's worth playing, especially like the Heavensward story.

43:25.000 --> 43:29.000
Well, no, I was thinking to finish up the ones that I'm on and starting a new class.

43:29.000 --> 43:37.000
Actually, wait, I do, you know what, I take it back. You can't, like if you were, if you needed to do this story dungeon, I could just go in there as like a level 80.

43:37.000 --> 43:42.000
Because assuming I'm 80 at that point, and I'm sure Shane could help with this too, or Captain Spiker.

43:42.000 --> 43:43.000
I think I'm at 65.

43:43.000 --> 43:50.000
Any of the variety of people we know. Yeah, but even, even then, like there's such a jump between 50 to 60 to 70 to 80.

43:50.000 --> 43:56.000
Like an 80 and a 65 could team up and take out any of those 60 to 69 dungeons. Easy.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
Yeah.

43:57.000 --> 43:58.000
You would need four people.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
And basically I'd have to relearn mechanics.

44:00.000 --> 44:06.000
And you've heard the thing about Shadowbringers is that when you get to those dungeons, fuck other people, you can just run with trust.

44:06.000 --> 44:10.000
The only, there's, there's going to be two parts where you can't do that.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
And it's the, it's the two big boss battles.

44:12.000 --> 44:13.000
The two big boss battles.

44:13.000 --> 44:17.000
Which is cool. I think like the last thing I had done majorly was the Ultros.

44:17.000 --> 44:24.000
And then when they had so many of like, what's this fuck, the annoying guy shoved down my fucking throat.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
Oh, Gilgamesh or Hildebrand?

44:25.000 --> 44:26.000
Hildebrand.

44:26.000 --> 44:27.000
Yeah.

44:27.000 --> 44:28.000
But I was like, I'm kind of done.

44:28.000 --> 44:29.000
I got sick of him.

44:29.000 --> 44:30.000
I hate him.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.000
He's an idiot.

44:31.000 --> 44:32.000
You don't have to do this quest though.

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000
They're optional.

44:33.000 --> 44:36.000
I did them though, because I was trying to level in it and have any other quests open to me at the time.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
Gotcha.

44:37.000 --> 44:38.000
I like, I like his assistant.

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
I think he's a fucking dolt.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
I like the dad.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
He's not funny.

44:41.000 --> 44:42.000
Yeah.

44:42.000 --> 44:43.000
I like his dad.

44:43.000 --> 44:44.000
His dad's funny.

44:44.000 --> 44:47.000
But I just think that the, the character's comic relief that wasn't needed.

44:47.000 --> 44:50.000
They may have finally retired him for Shadowbringers.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
I don't think he's in the main store.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.000
Well, don't quote me on that.

44:52.000 --> 44:55.000
Cause they might come out and say, guess what's coming in 5.1 more Hildebrand.

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
Like they might do that.

44:57.000 --> 45:00.000
Don't quote me on it, but he's not in the base.

45:00.000 --> 45:02.000
There's too much other shit to cover in the base.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.000
Cause there's, there's a lot.

45:03.000 --> 45:06.000
I gotta say the story is like, it's real good y'all.

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
And I'm not even at the end yet.

45:08.000 --> 45:13.000
And like every other day or no, every day I'm getting some text message from Shane where

45:13.000 --> 45:18.000
like, he doesn't want to spoil it, but he's like, I just, I can't believe that this happened.

45:18.000 --> 45:19.000
Like this is the best expansion ever.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
Like there's nothing is ever going to top this expansion.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
This is the greatest it's ever going to be.

45:23.000 --> 45:26.000
Well then I'll need to, you're on a different server than where I left off too, right?

45:26.000 --> 45:28.000
I am, but we're in the same cluster.

45:28.000 --> 45:30.000
So even if you didn't move servers, you could still, we still party.

45:30.000 --> 45:32.000
But I think I want to still join a different free company.

45:32.000 --> 45:37.000
So if you've got a different free company, like are all the same jerks that were in it that I didn't like?

45:37.000 --> 45:41.000
Um, this is a different, it's, uh, Shane, myself.

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
And then we teamed up with, um, uh, the game buoy guys.

45:43.000 --> 45:46.000
So like captain spike and then then y'all join your free company.

45:46.000 --> 45:50.000
And then these random like Aussies that I met through the game is who we play.

45:50.000 --> 45:52.000
No, I would rather join your free company.

45:52.000 --> 45:55.000
And because everybody else that I was playing with, I don't think I knew anybody,

45:55.000 --> 46:00.000
but like, uh, a couple of people in the current free company I was in.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
Yeah, so cool.

46:02.000 --> 46:05.000
We'll figure it out. Anyhow, Overwatch, turn to Final Fantasy 14 chat.

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
How do you like that?

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
Let's move on with some more stories.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
I had to do that when I took a bite.

46:11.000 --> 46:14.000
I'm sorry, but I'm going to need to do a quick AFK, but, uh,

46:14.000 --> 46:16.000
Dar Sakra will get into the next story.

46:16.000 --> 46:19.000
Then they get to hear me talk with a mouthful of food.

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
Speaking though of food problems.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
Oh my God.

46:23.000 --> 46:27.000
So anyway, this happened in Memphis, Tennessee.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
Oh my God. I'm still chewing.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
Will you say something real quick?

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
You're still chewing.

46:33.000 --> 46:36.000
I was hungry. I haven't eaten all day.

46:36.000 --> 46:42.000
Um, anyway, in Memphis, Tennessee, they had, this family had to take their son,

46:42.000 --> 46:45.000
eight year old boy, to the emergency room.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
And you know why?

46:47.000 --> 46:53.000
He was playing Fortnite and he didn't want to stop to go to the bathroom.

46:53.000 --> 47:00.000
So he got himself so constipated that he had to go to the ER.

47:02.000 --> 47:06.000
I mean, I laugh because I live this.

47:06.000 --> 47:09.000
My kids, they'll, they'll do that.

47:09.000 --> 47:13.000
Like all of a sudden it's like, I have to use the bathroom a lot right now.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
It's like, because we only have one bathroom in the house.

47:15.000 --> 47:19.000
And it's like, well, you have like five hours, you're playing games.

47:19.000 --> 47:23.000
You could have used the bathroom, but you decided now it's the time to do that.

47:23.000 --> 47:26.000
Or they're like, Oh, I went to the bathroom in my underwear.

47:28.000 --> 47:33.000
It's because the screens and games, they make that a priority over themselves.

47:33.000 --> 47:38.000
But it also is parents jobs to make sure their kids are going to the bathroom when they're young.

47:38.000 --> 47:42.000
And also that they're eating the right foods so that they're not constipated

47:42.000 --> 47:45.000
because I'm assuming that they didn't drink enough water.

47:45.000 --> 47:51.000
They aren't eating enough fiber. So there's a lot to that as well.

47:51.000 --> 47:55.000
But I mean, it also is another advocate for limiting screen time for kids

47:55.000 --> 47:58.000
or putting them on like a particular limit or something, you know?

47:58.000 --> 48:02.000
Well, and I won't even go into that because honestly I don't have children.

48:02.000 --> 48:04.000
I never want children. And this is why I don't want children

48:04.000 --> 48:06.000
because I don't want the fucking responsibility.

48:06.000 --> 48:15.000
But even so, these kids, this kid's parents should have realized

48:15.000 --> 48:20.000
how much time their child was spending in front of the game

48:20.000 --> 48:23.000
and limited their time so that the child could take care of himself

48:23.000 --> 48:27.000
and also make sure he's not eating junk and make sure the kid's drinking enough water.

48:27.000 --> 48:31.000
In fact, there is a line here that says that the doctors told the parents

48:31.000 --> 48:34.000
they need to pay close attention to what their kids are doing.

48:34.000 --> 48:37.000
Well, how long was this kid playing games?

48:37.000 --> 48:38.000
It doesn't say.

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
Because I mean, if you're going to get that constipated,

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
that would take days, I would imagine.

48:42.000 --> 48:46.000
It doesn't say. And I would think that he would have had to have been playing.

48:46.000 --> 48:51.000
Like on average, I think that it's something like what,

48:51.000 --> 48:57.000
a two to three hour digestive cycle for children from ingestion to excrement.

48:57.000 --> 49:01.000
So this kid would have had to have been playing

49:01.000 --> 49:06.000
and possibly even eating while playing for that much waste

49:06.000 --> 49:10.000
to build up in the colon and drinking no liquids with it

49:10.000 --> 49:12.000
or worse, drinking a dehydrating liquid.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.000
I mean, I know that sounds like an oxymoron,

49:14.000 --> 49:18.000
but having like a caffeinated drink or the wrong things

49:18.000 --> 49:22.000
or possibly even drinking milk with it if the kid's lactose intolerant

49:22.000 --> 49:26.000
and you don't go to the bathroom, that can be an issue too.

49:26.000 --> 49:32.000
But it's just really absolutely baffling how this could have even happened.

49:32.000 --> 49:35.000
And I don't look at it as a problem with the game.

49:35.000 --> 49:39.000
I look at it as a problem with, honestly enough, the parents not paying attention to the kid.

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Yeah, that's usually what it is.

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
And another thing going into psychology here,

49:43.000 --> 49:46.000
because this is something I did study for a little while,

49:46.000 --> 49:53.000
is that for the younger that you are, you're more immediately concerned with immediate reward.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
Your brain isn't wired to think of consequences

49:55.000 --> 49:58.000
because you're still growing. Your life is immediate.

49:58.000 --> 50:05.000
And so for a kid, we can't expect a kid to be able to regulate themselves at 8 years old

50:05.000 --> 50:10.000
to the extent of, say, someone who might be 16 or older would be able to regulate themselves.

50:10.000 --> 50:13.000
That's really where parents need to step in and go,

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
I think you've had enough.

50:15.000 --> 50:18.000
It's like the cat paw, time to stop posting.

50:18.000 --> 50:23.000
But I know, as a parent, what would you think of this circumstance?

50:23.000 --> 50:26.000
I mean, just take better care of your kids.

50:26.000 --> 50:29.000
You should know better if they haven't pooped in a few days.

50:29.000 --> 50:33.000
Put aside the cookie crisp and give them some Albrand.

50:33.000 --> 50:36.000
They'll really have to poo then.

50:36.000 --> 50:39.000
Rob missed the entire conversation about poop.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
We talked about it before the show, though.

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
Well, yeah, I messaged Rob last night.

50:43.000 --> 50:47.000
I'm like, yeah, I'm going to do the story about Fortnite sending a kid to the hospital.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
And he's like, oh, no, or something.

50:49.000 --> 50:52.000
And I'm like, yeah, he didn't shit for a while.

50:52.000 --> 50:54.000
Have you guys been reading some of these chat comments?

50:54.000 --> 50:55.000
Because there's some good stuff in here.

50:55.000 --> 50:56.000
Hold on, I was reading the article.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.000
No, you're fine.

50:57.000 --> 51:01.000
S2100 Matt says, can't poop regularly if you're just eating Doritos.

51:01.000 --> 51:02.000
Wow, that's some real tea.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.000
High culture says, give them the colon blow.

51:04.000 --> 51:07.000
Orangewright says, holding it in for a Fortnite for Fortnite.

51:07.000 --> 51:12.000
And Questbuster, probably with a more realistic perspective there.

51:12.000 --> 51:16.000
Tummy hurts, but I have a new hat now and need to show it off to everyone.

51:16.000 --> 51:17.000
Yeah.

51:17.000 --> 51:22.000
But again, it's just like kids are more concerned with immediate reward.

51:22.000 --> 51:32.000
If their focus is on the pleasure centers of their brain being triggered by getting all of this and playing Fortnite,

51:32.000 --> 51:37.000
they may ignore their body functions because they're not mature.

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
Especially if you're eight.

51:39.000 --> 51:43.000
You know, like I'm not going to make fun of the child here because they are a child.

51:43.000 --> 51:47.000
And if they're not being taught, you know, certain things by the parents.

51:47.000 --> 51:52.000
So the one to make fun of here is the parents about like, why, where are they?

51:52.000 --> 51:55.000
Like, would your eight year old be able to get away with this, Logie?

51:55.000 --> 51:56.000
No.

51:56.000 --> 52:01.000
Well, and see, when Julian was younger, you know, his thing was that Pirates 101.

52:01.000 --> 52:02.000
I don't know if he's still playing it.

52:02.000 --> 52:04.000
We'll have to get him into a real MMO.

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
Didn't we have him on the show?

52:05.000 --> 52:06.000
Yeah, a couple of times.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
And I remember everyone said, get good.

52:08.000 --> 52:12.000
And he's like, it's like, I'm a fucking 11 year old.

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
I love that boy.

52:14.000 --> 52:17.000
But at any rate, is he almost a teenager?

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
He is 12.

52:19.000 --> 52:22.000
He's going to be 13 next April.

52:22.000 --> 52:23.000
Oh, my gosh.

52:23.000 --> 52:24.000
Late April.

52:24.000 --> 52:27.000
We're going to have to get him back on the show after his voice changes.

52:27.000 --> 52:28.000
Oh, it's already.

52:28.000 --> 52:29.000
Wow.

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
He's already got crackly voice right now.

52:31.000 --> 52:32.000
OK.

52:32.000 --> 52:33.000
You know, that kind of in between.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
I sound like I'm slightly constipated.

52:35.000 --> 52:36.000
Yeah, no, I gotcha.

52:36.000 --> 52:37.000
Yeah.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
No, Julian, Julian is.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
He's just growing by leaps and bounds.

52:41.000 --> 52:42.000
Oh, wow.

52:42.000 --> 52:43.000
He's such a good kid, though.

52:43.000 --> 52:44.000
I'm so proud of him.

52:44.000 --> 52:50.000
And on top of that, too, he is a pretty vocal feminist.

52:50.000 --> 52:52.000
Well, I'm sure his mom raised him right.

52:52.000 --> 52:53.000
Exactly.

52:53.000 --> 52:57.000
Well, he also is very accepting of other people and he stands up to bullies.

52:57.000 --> 52:58.000
Good.

52:58.000 --> 52:59.000
I am so proud of this kid.

52:59.000 --> 53:03.000
Like, I could only be prouder of him if I had squirted him out.

53:03.000 --> 53:06.000
Our show will be in good hands when we all die.

53:06.000 --> 53:08.000
I don't plan on dying.

53:08.000 --> 53:09.000
So anyway.

53:09.000 --> 53:10.000
Yeah.

53:10.000 --> 53:11.000
Yeah.

53:11.000 --> 53:12.000
Kids, make sure your parents shit.

53:12.000 --> 53:13.000
All right.

53:13.000 --> 53:14.000
The end.

53:14.000 --> 53:15.000
Let's move on.

53:15.000 --> 53:16.000
Loki.

53:16.000 --> 53:17.000
All right.

53:17.000 --> 53:24.000
So, of course, we don't know a whole ton about Google Stadia, but there is some stuff that

53:24.000 --> 53:28.000
they did help clarify regarding their different plans that they have.

53:28.000 --> 53:35.000
So one of those, of course, is the Stadia Pro, which, you know, I was kind of wondering,

53:35.000 --> 53:36.000
what the hell is this?

53:36.000 --> 53:42.720
We get like a bunch of free games and what am I paying $10 a month for with the CD Pro?

53:42.720 --> 53:44.900
So here's what CD Pro apparently gives you.

53:44.900 --> 53:50.760
It's not like a Netflix of games, but like with most other online services that you pay

53:50.760 --> 53:57.920
for, like Xbox Live or PlayStation Plus or something like that, you get a game a month,

53:57.920 --> 54:05.000
which is less than the other offerings, you know, out there, like four games, a few games.

54:05.000 --> 54:06.000
Yeah.

54:06.000 --> 54:07.000
Yeah.

54:07.000 --> 54:11.720
And I'm glad they I mean, I think we kind of knew this from that part of it is not really

54:11.720 --> 54:12.720
going to be a Netflix game.

54:12.720 --> 54:15.600
But I think if you really kind of listen to what they were saying, any three, you kind

54:15.600 --> 54:16.600
of knew that.

54:16.600 --> 54:21.320
But it was nice that during this AMA, like they asked me anything on Reddit that he was

54:21.320 --> 54:26.960
doing, he did just flat out said like he didn't he didn't try to cut corners and he said people

54:26.960 --> 54:29.400
have wrongfully assumed this is a Netflix of games.

54:29.400 --> 54:30.520
That's not what this is.

54:30.520 --> 54:31.520
Yeah.

54:32.040 --> 54:37.440
So it's just you get the 4K surround sound and a game a month.

54:37.440 --> 54:41.800
And of course, they're starting that with Destiny 2.

54:41.800 --> 54:42.800
So yeah.

54:42.800 --> 54:48.540
And they say roughly one free game a month, give or take.

54:48.540 --> 54:50.600
So there may not be a free game in some months.

54:50.600 --> 54:52.840
And yeah, I gotcha.

54:52.840 --> 54:53.840
OK.

54:53.840 --> 54:56.840
I mean.

54:56.840 --> 54:59.400
Still not seeing the point, but.

54:59.400 --> 55:00.400
It was interesting, too.

55:00.400 --> 55:04.840
I read through some of the AMA answers and it was interesting how and I forgot the executive

55:04.840 --> 55:06.320
that was answering the questions.

55:06.320 --> 55:07.320
Sorry.

55:07.320 --> 55:10.880
But I thought it was interesting how he was kind of trying to justify like, well, you

55:10.880 --> 55:14.240
know, because because people were flat out asking like, why am I going to buy these games

55:14.240 --> 55:15.320
that I don't really own?

55:15.320 --> 55:17.020
They exist on the cloud somewhere.

55:17.020 --> 55:19.440
And he kind of really had this attitude of we get it.

55:19.440 --> 55:21.240
The cloud is scary.

55:21.240 --> 55:22.240
People don't want to.

55:22.240 --> 55:24.240
Why do you use Spotify?

55:24.240 --> 55:26.120
Well, and he he kind of addressed that.

55:26.120 --> 55:30.240
He said, don't people buy movies on, you know, Google Play?

55:30.280 --> 55:33.840
Don't people buy songs on, you know, Apple, iTunes or something?

55:33.840 --> 55:36.280
Yeah, but songs don't cost sixty dollars.

55:36.280 --> 55:38.160
Ding, ding, ding that you stole my fucking thunder.

55:38.160 --> 55:39.480
That was exactly what I was going to make.

55:39.480 --> 55:40.880
No, you're fine.

55:40.880 --> 55:45.560
It's one thing to throw away ninety nine cents on a song that you can listen to like a hundred

55:45.560 --> 55:47.320
times before you wear it out.

55:47.320 --> 55:48.840
But you are absolutely right.

55:48.840 --> 55:52.440
A song does not cost sixty dollars and even a movie.

55:52.440 --> 55:56.120
I want to say like probably the most the most expensive movie you're going to buy is probably

55:56.120 --> 55:57.720
going to be what, like twenty four ninety nine.

55:57.720 --> 55:59.040
It's a digital download.

55:59.040 --> 56:01.720
And I don't really buy movies really.

56:01.720 --> 56:04.600
I don't wait for Netflix or something.

56:04.600 --> 56:05.800
I know some people might.

56:05.800 --> 56:08.800
But yeah, I don't usually spend that much.

56:08.800 --> 56:12.960
Some people might. But I think even between twenty five dollars and sixty dollars, there's

56:12.960 --> 56:13.880
still a big difference.

56:15.360 --> 56:22.720
Yeah, and just just Google like I don't it's hard for me to trust that the service is going

56:22.720 --> 56:24.120
to be around for long.

56:24.640 --> 56:30.960
Um, I would like to think that it is, but like I've got so many libraries elsewhere

56:30.960 --> 56:32.440
that I can't see.

56:33.600 --> 56:36.880
I don't know who this is targeted to, like if this is targeted towards gamers.

56:39.160 --> 56:44.000
We probably already have gaming systems, are you targeting this towards non gamers, because

56:44.600 --> 56:49.320
is a non gamer, you can give a shit that you're giving away Destiny two for free, a game

56:49.320 --> 56:51.400
that's been out for a very long time.

56:52.400 --> 56:57.440
It's technically not free anyways, you're paying ten bucks a month, so I don't get who

56:57.440 --> 57:02.600
this is, where the who's the target audience for this is what I don't understand.

57:04.280 --> 57:07.200
Yeah, I don't I don't I don't know either.

57:07.640 --> 57:11.720
Interestingly enough, I haven't mentioned this yet on the show, I so Prime Day sale

57:11.720 --> 57:16.240
happened, right? Yeah, I ended up buying a Chromebook because it was so like deep

57:16.240 --> 57:19.000
discounted and I knew I had this travel trip coming up.

57:19.280 --> 57:20.960
I have no way to get my work email.

57:21.440 --> 57:25.720
Unless because I don't have like a laptop, so I was like, all right, well, I'm well, I

57:25.720 --> 57:29.760
had a laptop, my the laptop I have is like ten years old and monitors, but like, I can't

57:29.760 --> 57:32.000
use that laptop to do anything anymore.

57:32.000 --> 57:33.440
But I was like, maybe I'll just get a Chromebook.

57:33.800 --> 57:36.560
So and it was super cheap because of Prime Day.

57:36.560 --> 57:39.520
So I was like, whatever, like I'm not spending like a ton of money on whatever.

57:39.520 --> 57:42.840
And if I end up not liking it, it's not like, you know, it's not like a wasted money.

57:43.160 --> 57:46.360
But even I'm thinking like, oh, but, you know, thanks to that Chromebook, that could be

57:46.360 --> 57:48.120
a great little thing for Google Stadia.

57:48.120 --> 57:51.040
But then I'm like, I'm not going to I'm not going to do Stadia.

57:51.400 --> 57:56.760
On that laptop, even if it does run six or whatever, whatever they're saying, 60 frames

57:56.760 --> 57:58.480
a second, the smooth stuff, it's just not.

57:59.040 --> 58:00.760
Yes. Like where would that happen?

58:00.760 --> 58:04.600
Like, you know, like I like would try to figure out the scenario.

58:04.600 --> 58:11.840
Let's say, OK, I'm on a business trip and I'm taking my my Chromebook with me on the

58:11.840 --> 58:13.240
hotel Wi-Fi.

58:13.400 --> 58:15.680
You get in 60 frames per second.

58:15.680 --> 58:17.000
Anything. No.

58:17.000 --> 58:19.240
And DJ Rama S is like, Chromebook?

58:19.240 --> 58:23.000
I'm sorry. I need it to do like one or two specific things.

58:23.000 --> 58:28.360
And that's it. Like, I realize I bought a pretty, you know, like bare bones type of

58:28.360 --> 58:30.880
thing, but that's all I need this thing for is bare bones stuff.

58:31.320 --> 58:32.960
So. All right.

58:33.480 --> 58:36.240
Anyway, I guess I guess that's it.

58:36.280 --> 58:38.200
Nothing else on the Stadia AMA we want to talk about?

58:38.480 --> 58:41.000
No, I mean, I don't know.

58:41.280 --> 58:45.640
Basically, I just don't see the point of the system right now.

58:45.640 --> 58:49.560
Yeah, that's that's really all I want to talk about is the clarification of that.

58:49.560 --> 58:53.600
Just do you think they're trying to create a niche that doesn't exist?

58:53.960 --> 58:58.640
I think they're trying to push that this cloud is kind of like, well, take the gaming

58:58.640 --> 59:00.760
anywhere. You can play it on all these platforms.

59:00.760 --> 59:03.160
But it's like, I don't want to play it on my phone.

59:03.160 --> 59:06.880
I don't want to play it on a Chromebook, play it on my laptop.

59:06.880 --> 59:09.840
Well, you know, I can kind of already do that anyways.

59:09.840 --> 59:16.800
I mean, I would think this would be a big thing for like Mac users because you could

59:16.800 --> 59:18.240
play a lot of games that way.

59:18.480 --> 59:22.960
So that's the Apple's got their own solution coming, which is going to be so is it not

59:22.960 --> 59:24.040
going to be on Mac?

59:24.040 --> 59:25.480
I mean, no, I don't.

59:25.880 --> 59:26.880
They'll put Stadia on it.

59:27.040 --> 59:29.520
The impression I was getting is that Stadia, they're going to put Stadia on it.

59:29.520 --> 59:32.440
Chrome, I guess. The Apple's trying to fix that problem themselves.

59:32.440 --> 59:35.600
And they're they're they're spending the coin to get the developers in there to do it.

59:35.600 --> 59:40.400
Yeah, I just I will tell you this, though, the App Store does have a lot of AAA titles in

59:40.400 --> 59:43.560
it now. So, you know, I wouldn't be surprised.

59:43.560 --> 59:44.720
But there's a lot of stuff.

59:44.720 --> 59:49.800
I mean, I like it when I can play it on my phone or when it's designed for my phone.

59:50.040 --> 59:51.280
That's why I love Pokemon Go.

59:51.280 --> 59:52.320
That's why I love Harry Potter.

59:52.320 --> 59:54.240
Great examples of like phone experiences.

59:54.400 --> 59:58.400
What I do not love is like playing Sonic the Hedgehog 2 on my phone because it's something

59:58.400 --> 01:00:00.000
that you're supposed to have a controller for.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.760
And it's like they put a fakie one on the screen.

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:05.560
It doesn't work that way. Like when the experience is designed with the mobile

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:07.600
phone as your device in mind, I'm fine.

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:10.360
I just don't like it when they squeeze other games into it.

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:11.560
You know what I mean? Yeah.

01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:14.640
And I'm I'm fine with them trying to do this.

01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:16.880
OK, that's fine. Let's just put it out there.

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:18.040
We'll see how it does.

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:23.920
We'll see. Let's see what they offer to like make it interesting for me to want to buy

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:29.800
this. Right now, there's not anything that wants me or is making me want to buy this,

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:32.200
especially with next gen consoles right around the corner.

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:35.200
So. I mean, that's fine.

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:37.400
Not everything's supposed to be for me, so whatever.

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:42.480
I don't care. But I'm just I'm curious to see how well this does, because I don't know

01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:44.080
who they're trying to focus this towards.

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:49.800
I mean, I get like the streaming aspects kind of core, you can stream games.

01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:55.600
Well, you can stream footage of games and it's supposed to be, you know, lossless as

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:56.640
far as that goes.

01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:01.480
But. I think there's going to be problems with that, too.

01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:04.920
I mean, I know you can't livestream because you have to have a thousand, you know,

01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:09.520
followers or whatever the stupid requirements that they have now.

01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:13.040
And then like the other times, you know, music and stuff is going to get your stuff

01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:15.720
demonetized. So that's a whole nother.

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:17.560
It's YouTube fighting themselves, you know.

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:22.200
I just don't I don't get it, but whatever.

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:24.560
That's fine. Put out the product.

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:26.600
If it works, it works. If it doesn't, it doesn't.

01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:29.760
All right. Well, let's move on to talking about some of the announcements after San

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:33.160
Diego Comic-Con. I feel like I've been asking for the past three weeks is Comic-Con this

01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:35.960
weekend. Comic-Con this weekend. Well, it was this weekend finally.

01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:37.200
Just check Victoria's page.

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:40.680
Oh, yeah. My my good buddy Victoria from Shaking and Crying.

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:44.040
I know we haven't done an episode in a hot minute, but she got a lot to say on the next

01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:50.840
episode. She frickin' wore her cosplay of Janet from the medium place.

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:51.680
The medium place?

01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:52.480
I think that's what it was.

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:53.160
The good place?

01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:55.160
Well, but in the story, there's.

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:57.960
Yeah. So anyway, I've never watched that show.

01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:02.920
It's fine. She's she wore one of her Janet cosplays and she met the actress, like the

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:06.960
actress was at like some like bar that was set up to be a good place thing.

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:08.800
And she frickin went there and met her.

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:10.520
That's awesome. They got a picture. Yeah.

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:11.800
So, yeah, it's pretty awesome.

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:15.600
Zigzaggy dress, too, which I thought was like so tacky, but it looks good on her.

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:17.840
Yeah. Yeah. It fit the theme.

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:22.400
So, yeah. Anyway, the other stuff out of San Diego Comic-Con, lots of people talk about

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:24.240
the Marvel. There's a lot of Marvel movies.

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:31.160
The Marvel movies had a ton of like so much stuff between the TV series, like a Hawkeye TV

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:33.040
series and a Loki TV series.

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:36.400
And the TV series sound interesting, but like, I don't know.

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:38.880
And they were talking about they're going to do another Thor movie.

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:41.040
But this time it's going to go to Natalie Portman.

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:42.720
Well, they did that in the comics, too.

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:45.080
Yeah. Men calm thy tits.

01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:49.040
Well, there are already guys being shit about it, of course.

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:50.520
Block, delete, move on.

01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:56.280
But it will at any rate, though, there's this thing going around about them.

01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:02.280
Oh, the first Marvel LGBT characters, Valkyrie, read the comics character, the characters

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:06.400
have existed. Valkyrie is not the first, the first of the big screen, maybe on TV.

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:11.840
Yeah. But but Marvel has really had a leg up in the game for a while.

01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:14.920
Yeah. Well, anyway, I'm talking about the games from it.

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:19.160
I just know a lot of you are thinking about, you know, the the cinema stuff, but they did

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:22.680
announce some updates for the games, including Marvel Ultimate Alliance three, which I'm

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:24.160
kind of surprised you're not all over that right now.

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:25.480
Dark soccer, because that did just come out.

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:30.320
I have so many other things right now that I'm spending money on.

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:32.200
Sure, I understand. I bought a dress.

01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:36.960
OK, well, you know, when you do decide to jump into Marvel Ultimate Alliance three, maybe

01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:38.480
you want to pick up some of the DLC.

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:44.880
They did announce at SDCC that on September 30th, Marvel Knights Curse of the Vampire

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:50.600
will be released where Blade Moon Knight Morbius and Moon Knight.

01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:52.600
I'm I'm sorry. I thought I saw a comma there.

01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:56.480
Blade Moon Knight Morbius and the Punisher will be playable characters.

01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:58.160
Y'all got me. I don't care about any of them.

01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:00.440
I don't follow comic books as close as you guys do.

01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:02.000
And I don't follow comic books either.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.960
But thanks to Lego Marvel superheroes for making me familiar with all the obscure

01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:07.840
characters. There you go. There you go.

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:11.600
And Moon Knight is honestly the Marvel answer to Batman.

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:19.560
And then apparently there will be, I guess, a free update where Cyclops and Colossus will

01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:20.720
be added to the game.

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:22.480
So you won't even have to do DLC for them.

01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:25.840
You're just going to be able to grab them as like free updates.

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:29.120
So and they're they're very much like the comic book looking ones.

01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:32.240
So that's pretty cool. So people will be into that.

01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:37.640
And another thing that they showed, they showed more of the Marvel's Avengers game,

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:41.640
the one that, you know, Square is essentially going to be putting out.

01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:43.120
I saw the leaked footage of that.

01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:46.080
Yeah, there was some leaked footage that came out.

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:51.200
I try not to put too much stock in leaked footage because, you know, it looks bad because

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:52.840
I thought it looked good, actually.

01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:54.800
Well, no, no, no, I know the quality.

01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:59.240
Yeah, terrible. But yeah, I mean, the game, like what I could see of the gameplay

01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:03.440
definitely looked like, oh, this is it looked more interesting than what they showed us,

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:04.720
what they showed at E3.

01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:06.440
So it kind of blows my mind.

01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:09.000
Like, I understand that, like, you know, this is supposed to be a special thing.

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:12.640
I can't believe they haven't already released an official rendering of that

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:13.880
playthrough out to the Internet.

01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:18.520
I think that will probably come during Gamescom, if I were to guess.

01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:21.400
Oh, good thought, because that's just around the corner, too, right?

01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:23.400
Yeah. Yeah, interesting.

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:25.280
So but the gameplay did look really nice.

01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:30.480
And then they said that, yeah, Gamescom will be a thing from August 20 to 24th.

01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:34.080
And then they're saying officially this unveiling will come out in September.

01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:36.560
That's dumb. It's just it is.

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:38.000
Yeah, I know. Just get it out there.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:38.880
Why make everybody wait?

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:41.320
I mean, I guess they want to save stuff for Gamescom.

01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:42.400
I don't know, but they're not.

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:44.200
They're doing it after Gamescom.

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:45.120
So that's lame.

01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:49.160
Bobby Blackwell says it's apparently the same as the behind closed doors E3 demo.

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:51.840
So I guess this is something they're kind of taking around.

01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:52.560
Whatever.

01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:57.480
I just I just feel like when you know that E3 did not go over as well as you'd hoped,

01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:01.160
I would think that you want to, like, get a little more out there.

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:04.160
By the way, speaking of movies, because I'm looking at the little news ticker

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:07.720
bar at the bottom here, when we broadcast on Twitch, we had the news that ticks by.

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:10.440
So even though it's not exclusively gaming related,

01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:14.080
a little thing just ticked by about Top Gun Maverick because that trailer just came

01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:17.520
out. I mean, Top Gun 2 Maverick is still an asshole.

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:21.840
I had no idea that not only were they doing a Top Gun sequel,

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:24.600
but that they got Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer to do it.

01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:28.000
Hasn't Val Kilmer had, like, unhealthy amounts of plastic surgery?

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Like, doesn't he not look the same?

01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:32.520
Maybe I'm making that up, but I thought that was like a thing.

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:35.360
And now I'm going to have to take a look and see.

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:39.480
I did not watch that trailer, but I have to say at some point,

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:41.560
I did watch the Cats trailer.

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:42.880
I'm so excited.

01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:45.520
I got it. I think I'm going to be honest.

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:46.400
I have an honest moment.

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:48.880
I think the Internet is giving it more shit than it deserves.

01:06:49.080 --> 01:06:52.120
Well, and the people who are giving it shit clearly never saw the play.

01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:54.080
Right. Well, but let's be real there.

01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:55.400
A lot of people hated the play.

01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:57.640
Well, those people are wrong.

01:06:57.840 --> 01:06:59.920
But I'm going to give this an explanation

01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:04.120
to the people who have not seen Cats in a stage production.

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:07.840
The stage is oversized furniture.

01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:12.920
It is scaled down to where the human actors are cat sized.

01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:14.840
So for the movie,

01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:19.960
it's a perfect stylistic choice because it is exactly what it was like on stage.

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:22.720
And I think no one is complaining about the set pieces.

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:25.200
The set pieces look amazing.

01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:27.640
The Cats,

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:31.440
to be fair, I'm like on Broadway, they didn't look great.

01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:35.960
But but that looked fine, though, like this is uncanny valley, though.

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:36.880
I just I don't know.

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:39.440
The CGI doesn't bother me as much as is bothering other people.

01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:40.240
I don't know what it is.

01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:42.120
I'm just like, I don't know.

01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:44.440
But like I see all these things where it's like, wow,

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:46.800
we have to apologize to the creators of Sonic the Hedgehog.

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:47.520
Now we see the casting.

01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:51.160
But like when I watch the trailer, like the minute that Jennifer Hudson

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:55.320
started belting memory, I was like, this is what I will be paying money for.

01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:57.360
Because, yeah, I mean, I'm sure it'll be fine.

01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:59.960
Wallace like Jennifer Hudson is well.

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:03.960
And on top of that, of getting Judi Dench as

01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:05.400
crap, I forgot the character's name,

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:07.960
but the character was originally male on the stage play.

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:10.640
And having Judi Dench play that character

01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:14.640
for me is how I think that character always should have been.

01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:17.120
And on top of that, it was a male in the stage play.

01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:18.960
It's the old Deuteronomy or Deuteronomy.

01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:19.480
That was it.

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:25.080
And on top of that, of also having what's his fuck is Macavity.

01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:29.040
James Corden, was it or no, I was I don't know any of the character names.

01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:31.840
But it is. Yeah, I think that's who they got him as

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:36.840
Macavity and Macavity was like my favorite character on stage.

01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:40.080
I'm I the CGI doesn't bother me as much as others.

01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:41.160
And here's the thing.

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:43.960
At the end of the day, like it's by the guy that did Les Mis.

01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:45.320
And all I have to say is that Aria

01:08:45.320 --> 01:08:48.640
Snark and I went to see Les Mis, the one with like Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe.

01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:49.680
We went to see that.

01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:53.160
We sobbed for two and a half hours straight.

01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:57.160
So I will start crying right here on this show.

01:08:57.160 --> 01:08:58.640
If you start singing songs from Les Mis,

01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:01.800
if I even think about Anne Hathaway doing I dream to dream.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.760
Oh, God, she was born for it.

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:06.960
But OK, I'm going to tell you one thing, Rob.

01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:10.600
When you're not on air, OK, I want you to go and look up.

01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:12.720
It's like 36 Jean Valjean's.

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:13.480
Oh, yeah.

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:17.560
And it's people who play Jean Valjean in different countries.

01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:20.520
And guess who the Japanese one is?

01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:22.800
Chairman Kaga from Iron Chef.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:27.760
Oh, how funny because he actually he played

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:30.480
fuck, what was the

01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:32.760
the cop's name?

01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:39.000
Well, I can't think of it anyway, but it's just absolutely amazing.

01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:44.680
Fifth dream today in our chat says it's called cats, not can'ts.

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:46.520
I don't know why I thought that was funny, but I did.

01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:50.600
All right. Anyway, this is not a podcast about cats, but we had to look at y'all

01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:53.680
are talking about it like Twitter to not shut up for an entire day about it.

01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:54.920
One tangent more.

01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:57.880
I will say it did look like I can poke a little fun.

01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:00.400
Another topic, another destiny.

01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:04.280
I can poke a little fun at humor and stuff and even things that I like.

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:05.560
I will say I'll give you this good joke.

01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:09.640
So last night I actually hosted like a horror film festival for the first time,

01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:12.520
which I know is funny because you all know, like I'm super into horror movies.

01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:16.040
Right. But what I did, I came out on stage and I'm like, what's up, Sacramento?

01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:17.360
You ready to see some movies?

01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:21.840
And I said, are you ready to see the most horrible, gruesome,

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.040
disgusting thing you've ever seen hit the big screen?

01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:26.560
And the audience is going, yeah.

01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:30.680
And I go roll the cat's trailer and that got a good laugh.

01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:33.040
But I could I can poke fun at it.

01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:36.480
Come on. It's it's good for judging you right now.

01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:37.880
All right. All right. Moving on.

01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:42.800
Let's get to you've been waiting to talk about this one, Darcy.

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:50.400
Yes. So this and I actually did download the game before I had this article on it,

01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:56.600
but it's by the creators of Journey and it's called Sky Children of Light.

01:10:56.600 --> 01:11:01.520
It's a free game. You do have an app purchases, just saying, but it's so pretty.

01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:03.400
Like the moment I saw it, I really wanted to play it.

01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:06.320
And right now it's only on iOS,

01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:09.720
but it does sort of feel like it's an offshoot of Journey.

01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:14.400
So you basically play a child of light who is a caped figure going across these

01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:18.720
different realms and uses light to revive stars and reform constellations.

01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:21.440
Prince of the universe, sorry, Prince of all cosmos.

01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:25.800
Not quite, but you interact with your world and you have other players.

01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:29.840
There are other sparks of light in the game and you use gestures the same way.

01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:33.600
So this just seems like a logical expansion on the idea of Journey.

01:11:33.800 --> 01:11:36.280
But you're now on a wider scale

01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:41.040
and it does have that same anonymity where you don't know who your other parties are.

01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:43.520
And you also don't like talk.

01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:46.840
You use, you know, your gestures, but you can add

01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:50.200
your friends to it so that you can play with legit people that you know.

01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:53.240
But you also have that interaction of other people in the game.

01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:55.280
It's just absolutely gorgeous.

01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:58.760
The moment I saw a trailer for it, I was like, oh my God, I need to play this.

01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:06.120
Now you do have some pay tiers to get like extra goodies, because of course you do.

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:11.800
But they don't seem ridiculously unaffordable,

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.920
but it is free to play.

01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:16.200
You don't have to pay anything to do much in it.

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:17.720
But it's really pretty.

01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:20.120
I really, I really think I'm going to enjoy playing it.

01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:21.560
Yeah, I want to check it out.

01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:23.600
I need something that isn't idle pouring.

01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:27.840
But I must confess, I'm a little bit like

01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:31.480
shook, I guess, that, you know, an experience like this and the creators

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:35.120
of Journey that is very immersive and beautiful and stuff is kind of confined

01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:38.960
to my phone, like I'm a little bit like I wish they I wish they targeted one.

01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:40.040
Confined though?

01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:44.280
I mean, that's putting a personal limitation on it, though.

01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:48.040
You can do the your little touch screen right here, especially those of us who

01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:52.360
have touch screen, my little touch screen, you said it, that's not really that little.

01:12:52.560 --> 01:13:00.120
The thing is, is that this is a power that we have now that we did not have

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:05.680
when we were starting off as gamers, this is a legitimate forum to play a game on.

01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:11.680
And if you have something that is absolutely made with this console in mind,

01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:14.360
then you can't get an immersive experience in playing it.

01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:15.880
I guess I'll give you that.

01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:19.680
And, you know, maybe in my mind I'm referencing too much to Journey because

01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:22.920
some of the stylistic, you know, things seem to be in common.

01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:25.160
And I would not want to play Journey on my phone.

01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:27.040
But I also don't want them to have just

01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:29.240
copied Journey and made a new version of that for the phone.

01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:30.800
I don't think I doubt that's what they did.

01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:32.600
They've been working on this game for like seven or eight years.

01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:34.120
It looks unique enough.

01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:35.480
I mean, I'll be perfectly honest.

01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:36.840
That was why I got it.

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:37.840
I'll check it out.

01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:39.480
But like, you know, it's got a lot to live.

01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:42.520
Honestly, and I don't want to sound dramatic,

01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:48.160
but like Journey is probably the best video game they'll release this decade.

01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:52.480
Now, what if you play this and you decide that you like this?

01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:53.960
Then great.

01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:57.840
Then I'll file it up there with games like Pokemon Go and Ingress and things

01:13:57.840 --> 01:13:59.200
that I enjoy playing on my cell phone.

01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:01.720
And one thing that I've been really happy

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:06.200
about is that I really do feel like mobile gaming has really been

01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:08.520
revolutionized within the last few years.

01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:13.560
Like they're really pushing the envelope of what our portable devices can do.

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:16.280
Well, especially with now retroactive

01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:20.280
updates being done to get more performance out of older phones.

01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:24.000
You know, I think that, you know, people who may not even be

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.360
on the most up to date device can still get the same experiences.

01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:31.480
And I think that it's absolutely wonderful that now,

01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:34.960
you know, the hardware and software engineers are taking into account

01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:37.880
that people may not always be getting the biggest and newest of it.

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:42.280
And so the software developers, too, they're taking that into account as well,

01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:46.880
making those games as accessible to people on older devices as they can.

01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:50.280
And I'm really happy and really proud.

01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:51.600
And I want everyone who says something

01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:54.160
about planned obsolescence to shut the fuck up.

01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:56.200
It doesn't exist.

01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:58.160
All right, well, let's move on.

01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:02.880
We got a few more stories to get to before we get to your thoughts on Discord.

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:05.040
Let's get to Loki.

01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:06.440
All right.

01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:07.720
So this is pretty cool.

01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:12.480
There's a fan made game that's kind of done in NES style.

01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:14.600
And of course, it's for John Wick.

01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:18.440
So they actually have this available to play on

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:21.520
itch.io so you can check that out.

01:15:21.720 --> 01:15:23.520
It looks like

01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:32.040
let me spell this M-U-R-I-L-O-D-E-V dot itch.io slash john dash wick.

01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:33.960
And you can check it out.

01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:36.720
It's kind of a run and gun style.

01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:38.320
It looks a little bit like itch.io.

01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:40.080
It's not actually an S game either.

01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:41.760
It's probably an S inspired.

01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:44.000
Well, that's why I said an S inspired game.

01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:47.600
It's not actually an NES game,

01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:49.680
but it looks pretty cool and looks pretty hard.

01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:51.440
So go check it out.

01:15:51.640 --> 01:15:56.280
Of course, being that, you know, it's supposed to be very difficult.

01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:58.240
There's no extra lives, no continues,

01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:01.480
and you have one life and that's it, and it's game over.

01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:04.400
So I don't know.

01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:05.560
Pretty cool, though.

01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:07.200
I love fan games.

01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:10.880
I have not seen a single John Wick movie, so this will probably do nothing for me.

01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:13.400
Right. All I know is don't fuck with his dog.

01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:14.800
It's an awesome action movie.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.600
Yeah, well, I'm not just I'm not a hater.

01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:20.760
I just it's not that not been on my list of things to see.

01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:22.760
I probably because of this whole travel

01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:24.600
thing, I'm probably not going to get to see The Lion King.

01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:26.680
So but you already have.

01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:28.400
Although, yeah, I heard I heard it's not good.

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:30.480
But I guess a lot of people are going to see it anyway.

01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:31.920
So, yeah.

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:35.080
All right. I kind of want to see it because

01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:41.320
Mustafa, well, anything with Beyonce's name on it, I'm at least going to look at it.

01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:43.840
All right. Oh, say it again.

01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:45.160
Let's move on to a story.

01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:47.240
So you mean not Mustafa.

01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:51.760
I said, oh, let's move on to a story about the Nintendo Switch.

01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:54.480
And with this Nintendo Switch story,

01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:59.560
we're talking about a new, I guess, revamp for the core system.

01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:00.600
And that's kind of interesting.

01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:02.280
So the core system is going to be getting

01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:05.040
kind of like a under the hood revamp.

01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:06.880
You mean a pro edition?

01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:11.240
No, no, not a pro edition, but just kind of like a

01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:15.120
under the hood revamp that's going to add some various battery life to it.

01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:19.000
So right now the current system will run from two point five to six point five

01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:22.720
hours, but the new battery, which will just start showing up on shelves.

01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:25.040
And I don't think they plan on like advertising it or whatever,

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:28.840
but it's going to do four point five to nine hours, meaning like I don't think

01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:32.400
they're going to advertise this new campaign like it's a new Nintendo Switch.

01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:36.080
No, it's just going to quietly replace the switches that are on shelves already,

01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:39.240
probably because they realize they want the current stock to sell out.

01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:46.440
So you will want to look for a model number HAC-001-01.

01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:47.600
So you want to look for it because the

01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:50.760
other one will not have the extra dash 01 at the end.

01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:53.520
If you are interested in getting one of these that has a new battery,

01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:57.640
I'm not going to spend three hundred dollars on a new switch just for a new battery.

01:17:57.800 --> 01:17:59.080
But it is interesting that it's happening.

01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:02.200
It's funny because you say the whole pro switch or whatever.

01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:05.120
Maybe this is what they're doing for now,

01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:07.640
just because it's like it was something they were going to do anyway.

01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:09.800
But they're not ready to do that switch pro yet.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.200
Honestly, they have cases that have extra

01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:16.600
battery packs so you can buy and being that the switch charges by USB-C,

01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:22.520
you could buy, you know, one of the cell phone battery packs or whatever to plug

01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:25.760
into it as well to give it some extra time if you really want to extend the battery.

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:26.920
Great comparison.

01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:31.800
EsterShow100Matt says this is like when the 360 got the HDMI port added in.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.200
Yeah, yeah.

01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:37.040
I remember going around and looking for 360s with that skew.

01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:39.480
Shad Starzik in chat says the boxes are

01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:43.840
changing too, at least in other regions, so you could tell the difference that way.

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:45.800
I told you the story about when Dan and I

01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:50.160
went to go find the last PlayStation that had an IO port and we made the KB go

01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:54.840
through every single one of theirs until we found literally one left.

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:56.760
And we still have it. Yeah.

01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:59.960
But those IO ports were great because it lets you use those little plug in thing.

01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:02.200
That's how I was able to play my first bootleg games.

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:03.720
Well, you know, we actually had a first

01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:06.480
model PlayStation that we would just do the single switch on.

01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:07.880
Oh, those were the days.

01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:09.080
Yeah.

01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:10.760
You know, I will say, you know, it came up

01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:14.080
earlier about a PlayStation classic and should I bother getting one?

01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:15.080
I was kind of like meh.

01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:19.360
But I got to say, I don't know, maybe if I got like a PlayStation classic that all

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:24.120
the old like DDR and the Beatmania stuff and the stuff I used to really love on the

01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:26.440
imports and stuff, I might be into that actually.

01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:29.040
So you can you can hack all that stuff on your your mini PlayStation.

01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:31.400
Yes, you can. Rob, we should tell people what we did.

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:34.360
What? What we acquired or started to acquire.

01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:36.360
What are TurboGrafx scissors?

01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:39.120
Oh, that actually came up, I think, on Bobby's show.

01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:40.600
OK, that's OK. I'll say it again.

01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:42.800
Yeah, we did. Finally, I got the TurboGrafx.

01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:45.640
So did you. They took forever to get the order up.

01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:48.480
And I'll be honest, I really I feel kind

01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:52.560
of guilty for supporting Prime Day after everything that was going on.

01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:54.240
But technically you're preordering and not

01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:56.840
actually shipping something, the money didn't come out on Prime Day.

01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:59.760
So, yeah, the money, the money, I didn't spend any money on Prime Day.

01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:03.920
So I guess I can still keep up with my having boycotted because I didn't buy

01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:06.720
anything else on Prime Day or days, I should say.

01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:10.760
But it just it really bugged me that it took so long to get it up because I was

01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:15.800
just like, huh, it took long to get it up because I was really antsy for it.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:19.720
But what I'm hoping is that we it can get

01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:24.680
a copy patch to where you can apply translation patches to like stuff like Snatcher.

01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:26.040
Yeah, that would be awesome.

01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:29.080
Yeah, I think I've got like a burn of the Sega CD Snatcher,

01:20:29.280 --> 01:20:32.160
but I would love to to have this one patched.

01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:34.640
I wish they would just do like an official translation.

01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:36.520
But I realize it's asking for a lot.

01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:38.320
I'm certain that this is not an armship

01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:41.560
running some sort of Linux or anything that can't be hacked.

01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:42.920
I'll be perfectly honest.

01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:46.560
I want a good translation of police knots, too.

01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:48.760
All right, well, let's take a trip down memory lane.

01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:51.320
Since you brought up the TurboGrafx 16,

01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:53.920
I don't think that's where our classic of the week is this week.

01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:56.400
But every week, Dark Soccer likes to step

01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:58.680
into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey,

01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:01.040
you brat should be checking out this game this week.

01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:02.880
It's the classic game of the week.

01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:04.920
And Dark Soccer, what did you pick for our listeners this week?

01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:07.040
I went completely off console this time.

01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:08.200
You kind of did. I did.

01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:11.800
I well did. I went for worms.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.520
Worms came out in nineteen ninety five.

01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:19.440
Like, how is that for old school?

01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:24.040
It was it's a turn based artillery tactical game.

01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:29.080
It was developed by Team 17 and it was, of course, the very first one.

01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:32.480
It actually let me double check.

01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:38.440
It first had a release on actually isn't saying what it was first released on

01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:39.960
Amiga Amiga, actually.

01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:42.000
So it did come out.

01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:48.160
I stand corrected because European release was on Amiga CD 32 Game Boy and Mac.

01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:53.040
So this was on non PC systems first.

01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:56.120
It came out on the Mega Drive after that and then got U.S.

01:21:56.320 --> 01:22:00.600
releases for so the first U.S. release was on PC for DOS.

01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:02.320
And then we got PlayStation.

01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:07.120
We got a European SNES release and I'll go into the rest of these later.

01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:11.960
The last release was on Atari Jaguar, but it is a like I said,

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:17.280
a turn based artillery game very similar to like scorched earth where you control

01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:22.280
worms and you select different worms and you use their tools for where they are

01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:26.400
to attack the opponent's worms and then, you know, win the game.

01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:27.800
So you've got like different tools like

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:32.400
bungee and a ninja rope and grenades and all this crap.

01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:37.240
And in the first game you had over 50 different weapons and tools to use.

01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:40.480
And you can actually save your team as

01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:44.960
a scheme so that you can just pull that for playing whenever you've got different

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:48.480
kinds of terrains to you have like an island, which is the train floating on

01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:53.640
water or a cave where you've got, you know, water underneath the cave.

01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:57.840
You've got certain, you know, other weapons that are not

01:22:58.040 --> 01:23:00.680
overridable, you know, just different things like that.

01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:05.640
And of course, if a worm is hit by a weapon, then the damage dealt to the worm

01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:08.480
is removed from its own health.

01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:12.320
So basically you've got to eliminate all the other worms.

01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:16.120
So worms die when a worm enters the water

01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:21.080
either by falling off the island or falling through a hole when a worm is thrown off

01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:25.160
to either side of the arena or when the health is reduced to zero.

01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:30.520
So basically the game was originally created by Andy Davidson as an entry

01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:34.640
for Blitz basic programming competition that was run by Amiga Format magazine.

01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:36.680
So this was a contest game.

01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:37.920
So how's that?

01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:42.840
And it was, I mean, really just like

01:23:43.040 --> 01:23:45.960
bare bones, of course, at first, because it was basic.

01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:50.000
But the game was called Total Wormage.

01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:54.720
The theory is that it was referenced to Total Carnage and it didn't win.

01:23:54.920 --> 01:23:57.000
But the game was then sent to several

01:23:57.200 --> 01:24:01.920
publishers and then taken to the European Computer Trade Show.

01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:04.080
He met up with a gentleman named Mark Forman,

01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:06.840
who is the head games buyer at Gem Distribution,

01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:13.040
and they had him talk to Ocean Team 17 and they made an offer on the spot.

01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:16.840
So you've got to stay persistent with those games, guys.

01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:18.600
And then

01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:22.880
so there were, you know, there was a lot more done.

01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:31.160
It's funny since it had a lot of references because it was developed in Yorkshire.

01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:34.440
And so they used a lot of different,

01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:39.400
you know, the voice samples that were, you know, done in native accents to that area.

01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:41.400
And so

01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:45.560
there was quite a bit that went in for some of the later releases,

01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:50.800
like the PlayStation release had a lot of negotiation going on because

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.960
SCEA, Sony Computer Entertainment of America,

01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:57.880
didn't want 2D games on the console.

01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:03.040
But the Saturn version was a straight up port of the PlayStation when it came out.

01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:06.160
The last release that came out was Atari Jaguar,

01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:11.240
also developed by Team 17, published by Telegames, May 15th, 1998.

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:13.120
And

01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:17.720
it was one of the last remaining software pieces that came out on the Jaguar.

01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:23.240
It was available through direct order and from Electronics Boutique,

01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:26.000
if we remember the old EB.

01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:28.600
And then it was, again,

01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:33.080
one of the last games that had the Atari name on it officially.

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:39.720
The, you know, it was very cartoon like for the game, the style, you know, it is fun.

01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:43.000
It's a funny game. God damn played a lot of Worms for a while.

01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:44.720
This game was a lot of fun.

01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:47.240
Like I'm kind of with, who said it in chat?

01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:50.680
I think it was Dark Tetsuya saying, I don't think I played this one too much.

01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:53.720
I do remember the successor, Scorched Earth on PC, though.

01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:56.280
Technically, Scorched Earth came out before this.

01:25:56.280 --> 01:25:57.360
It came out before.

01:25:57.360 --> 01:26:00.520
And they're actually not related, except the fact that they're a similar type

01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:03.160
of genre, like Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat type of thing.

01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:05.080
I mean, Worms 2 was this equal to this.

01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:07.040
And then Worms, Dan played a lot of Worms Armageddon.

01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:08.200
That was and there's another game

01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:12.120
called Tank Wars on PC that I think was pre Scorched Earth.

01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:14.080
Yeah. I mean, this is not any genre.

01:26:14.080 --> 01:26:16.000
It just would be a fun game to stream sometime.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.200
I want to play Scorched Earth on stream sometime.

01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:20.480
See what I remember? Yeah, those guys are fun.

01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:22.520
At any rate, this one actually had

01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:25.400
an expansion that was called Worms Reinforcements.

01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:27.160
It came out in 1996.

01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:31.120
And then later on, it had a new version

01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:34.600
that was called Worms United that had both of them on there.

01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:36.280
And it was only released for the PC.

01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:37.720
It had a single player campaign

01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:40.720
and the ability to customize your level and sound packs,

01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:43.680
which was, by the way, already available on Amiga.

01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:47.000
And it had an introductory full motion video.

01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:48.680
And then Worms Director's Cut,

01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:53.640
which was the direct sequel, it only came out on Amiga.

01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:55.640
It was a big success.

01:26:55.840 --> 01:27:01.520
I mean, by March 1986, it reached over two hundred fifty thousand copies.

01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:03.560
And that's in less than a year.

01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:07.840
So this was it came out November 95 and this was by March 96.

01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:15.240
So it for all the versions, it sold well over five million units by 2006.

01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:20.840
You know, some people were like, eh, and other people like, oh, my God,

01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:24.720
this is the best game, but some people were like comparing it to Lemmings,

01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:28.720
which I'll be honest, I don't think Lemmings is a very rewarding game.

01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:33.880
But overall, it got really, really positive reviews.

01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:36.880
And the Saturn version was considered particularly good.

01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:39.920
Of course, the Saturn was a 2D powerhouse.

01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:43.520
So, you know, some people like the biggest

01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:47.520
complaints were about the slowness of large multiplayer

01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:50.440
and how imprecise the keyboard controls could be.

01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:53.720
That's, of course, playing on a computer.

01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:59.200
But, you know, considering what your Internet was like in 95 and 96,

01:27:59.400 --> 01:28:04.040
we were still just getting past dial up at this point.

01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:08.840
So the fact that it had reliable multiplayer at all is pretty astounding.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:17.520
And so it was actually the runner up by EGM as the strategy game of the year.

01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:21.520
The only thing above it was Dragon Force, which is a pretty awesome game.

01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:23.840
And there you have it, Worms.

01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:28.440
All right, great pick, because, you know, this game that I remember playing on PC,

01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:31.040
again, not as much as like Scorched Earth and Tank Wars,

01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:35.960
but definitely you kind of saw the, I guess, like the evolution of those ideas

01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:39.800
now, but like, oh, but the tanks can move and, you know, the worms can move.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:43.800
And it was a little more like this free for all type of commentary.

01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:45.880
Yeah, especially in the later Worms games.

01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:47.400
It kind of reminded me of like a cross

01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:52.040
between like the Tank Wars or what have you and Lemmings in some in some ways.

01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:53.840
Yeah, but I think Lemmings is boring.

01:28:54.040 --> 01:28:55.920
Oh, you're not a big fan of Lemmings,

01:28:56.120 --> 01:28:59.640
especially since like the whole game is based on a fallacy.

01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:03.240
Did you know that Lemmings do not follow each other blindly?

01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:04.920
That was actually staged.

01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:07.600
Well, I think I obviously I think for the game,

01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:09.600
they probably do some creative liberties for sure.

01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:14.320
But, you know, yeah, then I mean, honestly enough,

01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:18.960
it is just one of those games that really was sort of genre expansive.

01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:20.360
Does that make sense? No, I gotcha.

01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:22.040
Yeah. So anyway. All right.

01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:25.120
Well, we are going to do just a couple more things here and we'll see if anybody

01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:29.480
wants to call tonight on our Discord server over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:31.240
You can head over to the green room.

01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:33.120
And if you want to leave us a little key

01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:36.080
on the Orange Launch Radio, what it is you want to talk to us about.

01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:39.800
All that information about how to do that is down below on our Twitch page

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.280
over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network.

01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:45.520
But every week we also like to travel around the world and check out what is

01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:48.240
coming out on a game shelf near you, Loki.

01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:52.040
Not a whole lot this time, but we've got Beyond Two Souls.

01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:56.240
That's coming out on PC exclusively on the Epic Store.

01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:59.840
Tetris Effect coming out this week on PC as well.

01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:03.040
Also exclusive to the Epic Store.

01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:06.400
And then, of course, we have Raiden five

01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:11.800
Director's Cut on Nintendo Switch, Kill La Kill.

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:19.040
Yes, Kill La Kill looks like if that's on PC, Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.

01:30:19.240 --> 01:30:20.600
Did you ever watch the anime?

01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:24.520
No. Kill La Kill is out there and pretty fun.

01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:29.600
We have Wolfenstein Cyberpilot on PlayStation 4 and PC and Wolfenstein

01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:33.600
Youngblood on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:37.240
And that's it.

01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:39.200
All right, traveling over to Japan and

01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:42.720
checking out some of the releases over there we have.

01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:44.400
I'm just sorry, I think I might have

01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:47.040
accidentally unplugged the Internet on this computer, but luckily that doesn't

01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:49.040
affect the show anymore because everything's on that computer.

01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:51.200
But anyhow,

01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:54.800
talking about what's coming out in Japan, we have Kill La Kill.

01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.160
The game if is also getting a Japanese

01:30:57.160 --> 01:31:03.200
release on the 25th along with Spike Volleyball making and then making lovers.

01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:05.600
But without a not a space, but like a star.

01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:10.640
That's I guess a game that's making star lovers, star lovers or making making

01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:14.400
multiplication lovers, depending on the usage of the asterisk there.

01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:16.840
Those are the big releases in Japan this week.

01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:19.760
And seeing what is on the switch,

01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:25.160
we have some of the Kill La Kill is out on the Switch game as well.

01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:30.840
And then Rune Factory 4 Special gets a regular and a little limited edition box

01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:37.440
set there this week, and Doraemon's Story of Seasons is also out this week.

01:31:37.640 --> 01:31:42.640
And let's see, Saikyo Shooting Library Volume 1 is also out this week.

01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:44.040
Saikyo means greatest. Yeah.

01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:44.960
So I'm curious.

01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:47.280
It's City Connection is the company that's putting that.

01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:48.600
So I'm kind of curious what games they have.

01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:51.160
Wasn't that a NES game? City Connection?

01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:52.720
Yes, I think it was.

01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:54.800
So maybe I'll do that for a classic game.

01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:58.160
Fishing Spirits is also out on the Switch this week.

01:31:58.360 --> 01:32:02.240
And Pio Fiore no Banshu is also out.

01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:05.040
So I'm looking at that shooting library to see what games are in it.

01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:08.720
It's six eShop titles in one bundle.

01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:14.920
So it's Strikers 1945, 1945 2, Soul Divide, Dragon Blaze and Zero Gunner 2.

01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:18.280
Not bad. Yeah, not too not too shabby.

01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:21.040
All right. How about Europe?

01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:23.760
All of these come out on the 25th.

01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:27.880
So we have a Wolfenstein Cyberpilot VR.

01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:29.800
We have Wolfenstein Youngblood.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.640
We have Kill la Kill.

01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:35.360
And we also have Fire Emblem Three Houses.

01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:37.040
All right, sissy.

01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:40.120
Well, the next part of our show is where we would go to the mailbag where you guys

01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:44.160
can email us every week. Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com

01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:45.600
is the place to send your emails.

01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:46.560
I'm refreshing it.

01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:50.160
I do believe last we checked, unfortunately, it's empty.

01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:52.920
Yeah, we don't really have anything that's there.

01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:55.000
So that memory.

01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:57.160
Oh, no, it means Drag Race talk.

01:32:57.360 --> 01:33:03.120
Memory all alone in the moonlight.

01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:04.880
I don't have a good voice.

01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:07.200
Oh, I think your voice is plenty fine.

01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:09.320
What are we doing? Karaoke Revolution on stream.

01:33:09.520 --> 01:33:11.080
I don't know.

01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:12.960
Don't they have the Twitch sings now?

01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:14.360
You don't even know that's right.

01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:15.800
There's Twitch sings.

01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:17.080
That's something that's got a wow.

01:33:17.080 --> 01:33:18.200
I hit the table with my ring.

01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:22.080
I was so excited. That's something we got to hit yourself with your ring.

01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:24.040
I have pinched that little.

01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:25.320
Yeah, like we did it.

01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:30.040
Yeah, but I was like trying to get something on my forehead when I was

01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:34.040
in sister makeup and I bopped myself in the forehead with my ring and it hurt.

01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:35.640
I just did it on purpose.

01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:36.840
So.

01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:38.760
All right. So what night for our Twitch sings stream?

01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:44.080
So SSJ 100 Matt says last time we did Karaoke Revolution, things happened.

01:33:44.280 --> 01:33:46.120
It's been a long time.

01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:49.240
You know what? I'm actually not as self-conscious about my voice anymore,

01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:51.080
so I'll sing something.

01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:51.480
Why not?

01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:54.760
If I'm going to have Travis Donovan blasting for like the last 10 years

01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:58.520
of my life when I went to Great America and I couldn't really hear it.

01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:01.320
So life is a mystery.

01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:05.040
It's like a really bad opening to like a prayer, but I'll sing that again.

01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:06.720
I wonder what I should sing, though,

01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:10.520
because I'm not really a show tunes person per se.

01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:14.200
But do you know what my go to what are your go to songs at Karaoke?

01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:16.760
Well, I did Lady Fingers last time I did Karaoke.

01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:18.440
Oh, which, you know, that's kind of like

01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:22.080
my personal theme song is Lady Fingers by Luscious Jackson,

01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:25.360
which, you know, was one of my favorite bands in the 90s.

01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:27.760
I love Luscious Jackson.

01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:30.720
And I think one of my others was Banned

01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:33.840
on the Run by Paul McCartney and Wings.

01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:37.360
Did you see the Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr had a reunion on stage?

01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:39.720
That's pretty bad ass.

01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:43.040
My go to karaoke song, do you remember what it is?

01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:45.240
I sang it almost every week.

01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:47.600
I know that you sang

01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:49.080
Birdhouse in Your Soul for me.

01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:50.840
Oh, I did do that one once.

01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:52.520
And the key was weird.

01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:54.960
Yeah. And you had to change keys halfway through the song.

01:34:55.160 --> 01:34:57.800
And I did not keys, but

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.840
dropping, dropping the pitch to hit no

01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:02.560
hand in my pocket by Alanis Morissette.

01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:04.200
That's right. Like my go to always.

01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:07.640
That's right. I need, though, like another one that's going to be mine.

01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:10.320
Like what's something that I sing a lot?

01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:14.880
I did. So one of my friends dared to tell me that he disliked ABBA songs.

01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:18.720
So just because of that, I did Knowing Me, Knowing You last time I was at karaoke.

01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:23.680
It was fun. I think I would probably do, um.

01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:26.040
Darted, so you guessed Love Shack.

01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:31.800
That's a good guess, but that was more Miss Harper's thing than mine.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:36.280
Like I just and Lisa Loeb and that one song that I fucking hate.

01:35:36.480 --> 01:35:39.360
The Four Nomblons song.

01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:44.280
So I was just really good at doing the what was the name, Fred.

01:35:44.440 --> 01:35:46.600
That guy. Yeah,

01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:50.640
Fred, that's a faded sign at the side of the road.

01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:53.080
Maybe, maybe I know what I would do,

01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:55.400
because I actually think that they have it at sidetracks.

01:35:55.600 --> 01:35:57.640
I would do Sissy That Walk.

01:35:57.840 --> 01:35:59.720
Oh, that's fun. Yeah.

01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:01.680
Because I'll sing that one in the car.

01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:04.600
This is the last call for anybody who wants to call in our show tonight.

01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:06.200
You know, it'd be great is if there was

01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:11.600
like an instrumental you and I could do, I look fucking cool.

01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:15.480
That was a Dordellano and Alaska.

01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:16.680
Yeah.

01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:21.040
Once I remember doing a duet one time, I don't remember who it was with.

01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:22.880
I don't believe it was Miss Harper.

01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:25.560
It might have been Princess Irene years ago,

01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:31.280
but I remember singing the love the elephant love medley from Moulin Rouge.

01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:36.280
You know, love lifts us up where we belong, like the inner it intermixes all

01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:39.320
those songs. So, yeah, that was a lot of fun to sing.

01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:41.960
So I made a threat against my mom today.

01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:46.200
I said this actually relates me back to songs of that era, though.

01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:49.320
I was like, I'm going to make you a CD of things that I think you like,

01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:50.960
but I'm going to put Captain and Tino on it.

01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:54.600
And she's like, no, because muskrat love.

01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:56.160
All right. Well, since nobody seems to be

01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:58.280
calling in, do we want to try to squeeze in one more story?

01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:00.160
Loki, I know we had some stuff we had to cut tonight.

01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:01.880
Yeah, we could talk about how Detective

01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:05.040
Pikachu is the highest grossing video game movie of all time now.

01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:06.920
It's past Warcraft.

01:37:07.080 --> 01:37:09.160
Oh, which is good because it's a great movie.

01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:10.560
Yeah, it was fun. Yep.

01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:14.880
So it's brought in a total of four hundred and thirty six million dollars

01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:19.800
the last weekend and pushes past the previous record,

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.960
which is four hundred thirty three million dollars by Warcraft.

01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:25.000
I realized Warcraft made that much money.

01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:26.720
I liked Warcraft. I didn't hate it.

01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:28.800
Yeah, I saw it together. Yeah, I didn't hate it.

01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:31.800
Like with as much as, you know, you seem to get a lot of crap.

01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:34.680
Like, you know, it had its issues, but I didn't think it was.

01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:36.720
I wish they'd make another one, but they won't.

01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:40.280
And I'll be out on DVD and Blu-ray on September 16th.

01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:42.000
Oh, shoot. Detective Pikachu. Yeah.

01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:43.480
Oh, good. Good.

01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:46.240
So just a warning, like I would say a week

01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:50.520
after that's out on DVD and Blu-ray is when I can talk about spoilers

01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:54.040
because there's still something about that movie I've not been able to talk about.

01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:55.880
But I'm trying to I'm trying to behave myself.

01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:57.840
I still haven't seen so I'm warning you.

01:37:57.840 --> 01:38:01.200
You got a couple I'll say a couple of weeks after that DVD comes out.

01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:03.080
And then then I'm talking spoilers.

01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:05.400
So. All right.

01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:07.960
Anyhow.

01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:10.040
All right. Well, I guess that's going to do it.

01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:12.400
We're about 745. That's about as long as I want to go tonight.

01:38:12.400 --> 01:38:14.080
So I think we're about the time to get

01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:16.560
everybody's final thoughts and wrap up our show tonight.

01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:18.600
Hey, if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Laundry,

01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:20.320
you know, please tell a friend or two about our show.

01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:23.920
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:28.520
But if the voices are not here to air, then we can't have them.

01:38:28.720 --> 01:38:30.320
So please help us spread the word.

01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:33.280
Auto hosts on Twitch go a long, long way.

01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:34.080
So thank you. Thank you.

01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:38.200
Those you guys to do that on Twitch with the hosting and all that.

01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:39.240
Really appreciate it.

01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:43.880
And also, I know we don't read them all when we're live, but I do see the subs

01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:46.840
and the biddies and I know you get your recognition on the ticker bar and I'll

01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:50.120
read them when we wrap up live only on Twitch.

01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:54.600
But I just really just want to stress how much we here at VOG appreciate that,

01:38:54.800 --> 01:38:57.320
especially because, you know, we were able to do flyers.

01:38:57.520 --> 01:38:59.360
Thanks to the biddies and the subs.

01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:03.360
We are hoping to do some new merchandise for Dragon Con.

01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:05.320
We are looking at doing other stuff.

01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:06.960
So it's just it's really, really exciting.

01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:10.040
We were able to be a sponsor for Southern Pride Game Room.

01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:12.200
Thanks to biddies and that that helped.

01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:14.520
So, yeah, just want to say thank you.

01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:16.120
Thank you. Thank you for all of that.

01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:18.080
All right. Let's get final thoughts.

01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:19.280
Loki, we'll start with you tonight.

01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:19.840
Your final thought.

01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:23.080
Final thought is I'm hoping to have some well,

01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:31.120
I'm hoping to set up a local meet up for laser tag soon and I bought gear to.

01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:35.640
To stream, well, not stream it, because I don't think I can do that with the gear

01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:41.360
they have, but to record it, yeah, or camera it.

01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:46.120
And my final thought would be, please send me your thoughts and prayers

01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:50.080
that I don't get voted out tomorrow because it's not looking good tomorrow.

01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:51.600
Tomorrow might be it, but we'll see.

01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:53.800
Fingers, fingers crossed, toes crossed, too.

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:57.240
And last but not least, because it's me,

01:39:57.440 --> 01:40:02.320
please remember to spay and neuter your neighbors and family members.

01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:03.880
All right, that will do it.

01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:08.080
Have a wonderful week until I get constipated.

01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:10.440
Have a wonderful week, everybody. We'll see you next time.

01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:11.920
Thank you so much.

01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:13.920
And have a have a good week, everybody.

01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:16.640
We'll be back next week for a full, full show.

01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:19.520
Thanks for being with us for this abbreviated edition tonight.

01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:21.520
Happy week gaming and everything like that.

01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:24.120
And please take a moment to stop and go to the bathroom.

01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:25.480
Good night, everybody.
