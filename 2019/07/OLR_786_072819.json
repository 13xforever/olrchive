Roberts joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle with my co-hosts in studio not on camera cuz she doesn't want to be even though her new hair is a really rad color here I mean it's not like new hair she's not like she's oh there you go so so so once in a while she wants to be on camera the shadow route orange you there she is DarkSakura or Jamie Summers hi is orange orange orange you glad you're here at OLR tonight yes you could have so happy to be on the show you could have still been playing all sorts of pinball and classic arcade games in San Jose but you're here with us no I couldn't cuz Dan wanted to come home oh what a like I'm tired I was toddler tired what a party pooper yeah all right anyway we do tape live of course every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at twitch TV twitch.tv slash vog network and I'm saying that because I'm reading some comments from chat where stu 100 Matt says orange hair radio and Spyro Jonathan says heck yeah orange hair radio so did you dye your hair orange because you are that devoted to this show as if 17 years of your life wasn't enough bitch I might be I'm actually not gonna be bleaching my roots anymore because you know it's bad for your hair to over bleach I wouldn't know I don't I don't have hair anymore well so why do you think I wear hats those on the camera can see it's dark up here I'm gonna be going really red and growing out this orange part to wear when my hair's long it's gonna be like flame point I'm thinking ahead this is gonna be like a three-year endeavor it looks worse on cam that it really is like I sort it like it looks like it's just like completely bald on top but I do have some hair it looks worse on cam I think but not but bald is beautiful so I don't give a fuck so whatever it gives you an excuse to have interesting hats too yeah it is I'd like the hats are a good accessory why not you you ladies get to pick your purses that match well not that gender roles should define anything but the majority of you know American culture is that you pick a purse to go with your outfit why should I say queens yeah exactly right but if I wanted to pick take a purse then god damn it I'm gonna take a purse exactly all right bring back the murse all right anyway I had a murse we talked about that another time all right anyway hello I don't mean to ignore Loki techmaster Loki over there that's fine but you're equal number one I'm thinking you don't have a lot to contribute to the purse discussion no and I can clearly see you're over there catching Pokemon yes because apparently my house is a how hot bed of Pokemon no just because I haven't done it in a while and because I don't know yeah I'm out of the loop so you know to that guy that reviewed us on iTunes saying they talk about nothing but Pokemon go those days are numbered I haven't played some review I shouldn't even acknowledge the negative reviews but it is what it is yeah yeah but you can always leave a positive review if you want to offset that stuff for the record there's jack shit at your house what they had a thing where you get you hatched or you get a dratini and then you have to take a picture of it and then that picture got me one of those smear goal things and so I had to catch that oh I didn't do that I caught a dratini but I didn't take a picture of it yeah I've kind of fallen off the wagon on this quest like I guess today was the in here we are talking about anyway today was like that Team Rocket type of my game well they keep doing it on Sunday night well I can hit it though before when I leave the house to come here I can hit the pokestop by my house so here's the weird thing like so Pokemon go gave my phone a new background I don't know why like it changed my wallpaper did you tell it it could no it just did it like it crashed the wallpaper is it a cute Pikachu no it's just like it's just like some pink like looks like like a mountain range or something I had like weird it's supposed to be a simulation of earth with like the lighting and everything and the cloud cover is supposed to match with what the weather satellites are because that's kind of cool and now it's gone all right whatever background on y'all's phone I have a picture of mr. smoosh on my well you can't see it right now because I have apparently Twitter alerts that are in the way oh because that's a good thing because y'all are promoting the show tonight because I barely did but I have a picture of mr. smoosh is the background of my phone you guys probably can't even see it from that far away but that's what I have I try to take a picture of a dratini to see if that would count and it doesn't you can turn off the AR thing and and it's a lot easier to do pictures and so I wanted to take the AR because I did it on top of my macbook and it's got your knee in the picture oh my sexy knee I'm sure I'm I'm being a little bit of a that neither tonight by showing off my knees that knee uh-huh all right anyway it's hot today I can't how could I not wear shorts everybody's wearing shorts because it's 106 today here in lovely Sacramento where we're based the ambient temperature coming off of my car when I got in it was 115 Wow right well all right anyway let's let's talk about the weather more talk about games and dark soccer you braved the weather this weekend because you went on a road trip off to San Jose right I didn't brave the weather I left it but so tell us a was like it didn't get any hotter than like 88 you know that's that's typical Bay Area but anyway tell us about California extreme it was the thing I go to every year basically in a nutshell California extreme is a big gaming Expo where they have like a huge ballroom full of pinball classic games music games and they've got a big candy cab section now the Japanese style cabinets and then they have like a whole other room now that's just like a big meeting room that's also full of games and then they have a vendor room upstairs with a stage to do rock band kind of how allowed did their thing and then you know classic consoles also set up up there so it was really good it goes on for two days I forgot what time it opens I think it opens at like 9 or 10 but it goes to 2 in the morning on Saturday and then Sunday all day and people you know bring their own machines some people sell them there Stern has a big presence and I twice ran into Steve Ritchie and he's like oh hi cuz you know we're Facebook buddies it's funny yeah and he was I was like let's get a picture together he's like I got to go take my pills I'm like okay Steve he's not a chicken of the spring anymore but he's he's just a good guy he and his wife are the nicest people you'll ever meet but they had all kinds of really good games which I could go ahead and do now and get my gaming week out of the way for everything I played yeah well I was hoping there might be stuff outside of for that but oh sorry well no I hardly played anything outside of California stream except for the usual we'll get into a little bit of what you what you played a California stream then okay so I played Black Knight Sword of Rage which was amazing as always and if you were ever gonna buy a Black Knight Sword of Rage get premium don't get the pro the premium that brand new table yeah maybe three months old they had the miss pac-man mini like the cabinet that's like like a two-thirds my height but there's like those arcade one-up machines yeah I think that's what they were interesting I didn't I'm surprised that those are kind of yeah those have an interesting place in this day and age right because like I would think in some ways those might be frowned on because they're not authentic miss pac-man's but they sure do give a fairly authentic experience with the screens the screens really a big difference like you can really notice the screens on those arcade one-ups are not the same thing you remember playing oh really and then they had an even smaller one that didn't look like it was in the same thing so it could have been custom but it was an ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 so that's some interesting ones ones there they didn't have any of like I mean those are almost like the junior size one but they didn't have the junior size Neo Geo you know I bet that arcade one-up company was probably like advertising there actually they probably had some type of deal to have their machines there because that is the perfect crowd to be selling the those things to you know classic arcade game fans with disposable income that is like that is their crowd so I wouldn't be surprised if those machines were there because like arcade one-up kind of wanted them there and they did have from what I could notice fewer of the pinball and arcade board vendors and more of the classic video game vendors although I tried to find Saturn and turbo graphic stuff and they were very sparse they still the place that I buy from tiny potato I really like those guys I hang you know hang out and chat with them every year but they have a copy of cotton for PlayStation that I would really like to buy but it's 90 bucks I keep waffling on it you know but I mean it was really a fun time all the vendors were really nice everyone was really friendly and chatty and one of the vendors watched me open a couple of blind boxes cuz he went in I said he's like can I predict him first I'm like sure so he shakes the two of them I grabbed like the dig dug blind set which you could get one of three characters so you know he had two out of three choice like this one is a puka and this one is the I always forget the name of the dragon the fry gar fry gar is like this one's a fry I wanted to say that's a video game cuz the game rygar yeah I was thinking rygar and I was like so he shook him is like this one's a fry gar this one's a puka so when I opened them one was a fry gar one was a puka I wouldn't have minded a dig-dug but I like having the baddies so they're cool and pukas are cute but at any rate I they really they were missing some stuff this year just some things that I expected to be there this year that were not there were lots of panels Steve Ritchie did a panel about developing Black Knight there was one about DJ max oh wow yeah 730 and I I didn't go to it cuz I was hanging out with melody but Mel went to it which by the way preview preview we may have Mel on yeah yeah I heard yeah he was thinking about is he gonna come up here we doing something awesome I would love to have love to have him back on the show talk about the have a DDR night infinity stage yeah that he's gonna be working with but you know there was a pretty decent music game section but they didn't I was looking for a couple of things they didn't have it although they did have that nostalgia game by Konami that looks kind of like a keyboard but not really a keyboard I think I know what you're talking about it's it's a newer game right yeah yeah I think Musica which I finally got to play it was fun they had my my do you know what my my is uh yeah circle that's got the button yeah pattern I played that and it had an oppa oppa song so I was very happy I'm not great at it you know it's just my first time playing it but I think I did okay so as they had a bunch of DJ max though they had some you beat they had a couple of the bishi bashi so that was pretty fun they had a real prop cycle another prop cycle Adams family they did had an Adams family though but you know there was there were certain the blastroids that used to belong to us was there so it was pretty funny dance like I'm gonna go see our blastroids but anyway so what I played there was I played Black Knight Sword of Rage I played the Miss Pac-man mini I played Pac-man and chomp chomp which is a very weird little more recent Pac-man game JJ squawkers which thought I played Sonic the fighters I played azumanga daioh puzzle bobble so it's basically puzzle bobble with the girls from azumanga daioh in it so easy peasy I played my my I played virtual on oratorio tangram which was really fun they were in the Japanese cabinets and they were back-to-back and I was just trying to play through you know the story mode and this one person just keeps challenging challenging chill I'm like I was just so stubborn I was like I just want to beat you and be done and you kept doing over and over and like six games and I'm like okay I'm done and I just let him win you know I just ran in with the sword and it's like if you can beat me at close range then you win and so I walked around and just poked him on the shoulder I was like good game dude and he's like it's a girl you know like the total it's a girl look like a girl speaks to me pretty much like the ending of Metroid for the very first time yeah but I played Dodon Pachi I played Big Bang bar so they had a Big Bang bar but it was I think it was a repro because the glass on it they played Musica I played some regular old pac-man but it wasn't one of those I forgot what they're called like the marquee cabinets the the narrower ones with a smaller screen yeah I know what you're talking about but I don't know the name call them something and I remember did if you bring up pac-man did they have my all-time fave baby pac-man I didn't see baby pac-man I would have played the shit out of it I saying for those of you that go Google baby pac-man if you don't know it cuz baby pac-man the reason why I love that game so much I remembered as a kid it is half like pac-man arcade game but then there's a point where when you go out the tunnels you don't like warp to yet well you do when you go out the side when you go there's tunnels in the bottom and when you go out the bottom tunnels you drop into a pinball board and so it's half pac-man half pinball and it's so cool I didn't play journey either because apparently the joystick was a little messed up but I also played you know crazy auto which was a kind of backwards retheme of miss pac-man because miss pac-man started life as a pac-man like expansion yeah I was like a pac-man plus and they were gonna release it under the name crazy auto with a walking character and everything and then you know Namco and shit happened and miss pac-man I also played a Beatlemania pinball and I played the Sega Tetris that's got the big fat blocks like you only have like ten block spaces to work with it's kind of hard but it was really fun I really enjoyed it and there was also you know there was a few others a bunch of cave shooters like mushihime sama and and what was battle garega what else did I play no it was do don pachi that I played because I love that game but yeah they just had all kinds of neat stuff I mean there were there were a bunch of you know the street fighter ones like starting from third impact all the way up through five they had an arcade machine for five and they had multi blood you know just all kinds of neat import games over in that area so it was it was really neat you know just a fun time and hanging out with my friends and you know ran into Bradley like you do and I played with the toddler what kind of like vendors were there cuz aren't there usually like around the edges of the rooms there's like some vendors selling like classic arcade things like what did you see there was like one DIY vendor outside doing like etched glass and there was another one inside also doing etched glass like for mugs and shot pint glasses and shot glasses and then you know I said there weren't so many we pinball part vendors like there were in previous years Marco pinball of course is one of the sponsors with Stern for bringing in a lot of the because they have it that big stern section that had like Black Knight Deadpool all of that and so they were selling parts and stuff from Marco there was the shirt vendors for California extreme there were just a lot of like kitschy knick-knack II stuff for for the video game merch like the blind boxes and Mario mugs and there was a doormat that I wanted one that says welcome to Peach's castle it was kind of cute and they had like throws and everything like blankets and this is nothing super exciting maybe you know if I was trying to decorate my teenage bedroom that might be something or if you know we start getting into decorating the game room or something it was it was all nice stuff you know I got my two little things to put on my desk at work and I got patches actually I got an Atari patch I got a mass link shield the Hyrule shield patch and I got a a super mushroom because I'm gonna make a patch jacket so fun you need to get some of those old-school Activision achievement patches for your jacket I'll see I would love that I would look so many issues reprose there's got to be reprose of that I would love to get an awesome jacket with like all the Activision badges I think that would be cool yeah that's got to be like an Etsy or something one of those things I wish Activision themselves would do it though you know because they as much love or hate Activision in their current state today for those of us that were you know cool kid Atari 2600 folks like you know it would be it would be nice to you know get our get our hands on some of that type of merch right oh so I did buy a few things though oh yeah I bought the compact old-school Game Boy case it's this well they can on the podcast anyway so anyway it's it's actually honestly about the length of this microphone okay and it has enough space for they can see mine it has enough room in it for a Game Boy on one side and then maybe like four games total on the other I think I used to have one of those cases it's a hard case and I was like I don't have a Game Boy to put in it we don't have an old-school Game Boy anymore but I could make like a purse or something out of it it'd be fun or you know like a first aid kit yeah you know I thought it would be neat I only paid five bucks for it and then I got the Game Gear magnifier I mean he wanted eight bucks for it but I actually got the two items together for ten bucks you know cuz you haggle you haggle when you go to the classic gaming table and then I got a game called air adventures for Saturn that I never played but like they this one guy traded it in with a stack of other games and when the fellow was looking it up it's like it was only worth the dollar I was like I'll give you two bucks for it okay so I took it sight unseen two bucks because it's another Saturn game and I thought it'd be fun to try something new you know that hadn't played before and yeah I didn't really do like a whole bunch of shopping in it my knee t-shirts you know but they had some fun little stuff and I love blind boxes so I now have my poop puka and fry car you need to you start a YouTube channel opening blind boxes do you know like how popular those types of videos are yeah but these aren't it these are different than like those little blind boxes the gift blind boxes it's people like order like the Amazon returns or the blind boxes on Etsy or not Etsy but eBay you know those are the ones that get money or the people who buy the storage units I know let me ask you one more thing about California stream and then we'll get on into the rest of our gaming weeks the type of stuff we've been playing but you know you've been going to the convention for several years now what was your favorite thing about the convention this year and well let's start there what was your favorite thing about the convention this year um I don't know just I guess more seeing my friends the people yeah that's fair that they hanging out with nerds hanging out with nerds heck yeah that's one of my favorite actually Dragon Con mag fest any kind of into the two things that I heard the most that made me happy was one I like your hair and number two I like your shirt I was wearing my crazy red shirt for Animal Crossing that says seems legit oh I was gonna wear my chica shirt and I was like you know I'm gonna wear crazy red it's a little a little bit bigger it's a little more comfortable and everyone's like oh my god you're sure let me take let me take a picture of your shirt okay and then I think probably the obvious follow-up to that would be what would be one thing that you would want to see them do next year that they haven't done yet I want or they're not doing I would like a whole room of nothing but I'd like them to put the candy cabs and the Bahmani the music games in their own room that sounds like a get you go you'd like so much noise pollution though and that but I guess I guess if you set up barriers the right way if you kind of thought it through there'd probably be a way to make it a little more tolerable and the other there's actually one other thing because I was when I was talking to tiny potato guys there they said that they weren't given any lighting where they were so people couldn't they had to go to Target and buy lamps and I was like you really need to take better care of your vendors you know don't put people in dark little corners with no lighting that's not fair to them if you were gonna have the vendors be in a place other than where they usually are you need to make sure you have sufficient lighting so that people can see those items and they're not wasting money renting the space okay that's good feedback I think that's exactly the type of thing I think would be good for them to hear but I think that next year though I actually want to officially try to go as press next year I want to go period because I've missed it so many years in a row but this is also you know in generally like personally this is also a hard weekend so it's like you know it's just just a bad time of year for it you know yeah but I'm gonna put in for press next year you should so that we can go in and interview people and do panels good panels yeah I get some of the get some of them for some some break segments get some interviews that'd be awesome maybe we should even like petition to do a panel you never know I mean at this point we would be a classic podcast don't you think classic podcast they have games from 2002 in there that are classic games I think there was there was also another game in there I forgot the name of it but it was like the super field goal football baseball mixture game it was kind of weird yeah Bobby and Chad is saying I'd love to go to probably won't be able to swing it yeah I think him and I are in similar predicaments as to why he can't come out here for California extreme and why I can't go out there for the southern fried gaming expo which is really it's really their equivalent is what that that show is so yeah but I mean it's really it's really fun you know I had a great time like like I said earlier I was toddler tired when I was done because I didn't want to stop playing but I was tired was it that super slam-dunk yeah yeah we had that guy on the show a long time because they were at gamer X yeah second or third year yeah we had them remembered it but everyone in dance pinball group was like oh it's so much fun yeah it's a fun game they had a killer be there it's been out a while now that a killer be a killer Queen that was it which I still haven't played that game but everyone says it's really fun so Bobby and Chad says yeah the toddler tired thing is why I got a hotel room at southern fried so I didn't have to drive home at night and yeah I think that's why I like a lot of people like kind of even if the convention is like right by you you know a lot of people if they have the income I mean certainly you know how much money you do or don't have and are able to spend on that type of stuff plays a factor but if you're fortunate enough to be able to swing it like I think a lot of people are just like I'm just gonna plan to stay on site they're doing a big ingress thing in downtown Sacramento on October 12th I'm considering getting a hotel room in downtown Sacramento because of the whole toddler tired thing yeah I need to get in on that information yeah you do you do come join us anyway all right let's talk about the rest of our gaming weeks outside of the convention of California extreme which I really do hope to attend next year and congratulate those guys on their success because everybody I talked to that goes loves it and I just it's just it's always like a bad like timing conflict I think one year speaking of gamer X and the the game there I think one year it was the same weekend as gamer X and that was an issue I think it was the year gamer X was up in San Francisco tell me stream was like the same weekend I seem to remember that was the thing that happened yeah yeah anyway um did you want to add anything else to your gaming week our soccer outside of the convention the usual phone games mm-hmm so that's it yeah and Pokemon go first my phone today no it needs to stop doing that probably so many people getting in on that event I guess which sadly I've just lost track of Loki how about you how was your gaming week I didn't play a lot of games this week I played just a little bit Pokemon go okay but you did something video game adjacent I know because you invited me and I couldn't go so I played more laser tag again actually so I went last night I tried to get a meetup group of people to go play some laser tag I did have one of my friends show up with his kids so we played for a little bit and that was kind of fun so he played that for a while at the local place here then today I went to a not quite local place a little further away to try out their arena and system stuff to see if it's something I would like I was hesitant to go there because it's twice as much it's very far away and I don't know I just had kind of a bad feeling about it and when we got there and played it it was kind of jank a little bit the arena is nice and I like how some of the features that they have are kind of remind me of cues are but it's the guns themselves were really tiny and they force you to push like two buttons on the side in order for you to actually be able to fire the gun so you have to hold the two buttons on the side because they always want to make sure they using two hands whereas the place I play over here they have an optical sensor so you put your hand on the bottom and it detects it's there you don't have to hold some stupid buttons so forcing to hold those tiny buttons actually cramps the hell out of your hand and doing that even for just 20 minutes I was like fuck this place I'm not coming back here but I do want to check out all the places in the area so I played most of them now but then ended up driving back over here playing a couple games so it's fun I keep playing in it and I tried to actually have some footage shot I got one of those action cameras I just don't have the right settings on it right now so it came out really grainy and dark because I have to adjust some of the settings on the camera which is unfortunate because I had some pretty good games there but it's hard to see what's going on and I had it mounted to my head instead of like on my shoulder or something like that and it's just really hard to see kind of what I was doing you kind of miss a lot of it so I'm gonna try it again at some point I may actually pick up another camera to try to maybe mount one to a gun mount one to my shoulder or something to get some footage because I think that'd be really cool but yeah so I've been playing lots of laser tag so I used to play a lot of laser tag way back in the day and it definitely still shows I like that you're having like your midlife crisis where you're rediscovering it all over again it's not that I have never like not like I know wanted to if like if a Q's are were to open up tomorrow yeah I'd be playing there all the time well you're going to this new place a lot which is pretty cool and it's see it's like I'm so torn because that place like it has a decent arena it has decent gear but the people that run it are just not great they they're just like it's you can tell that they're minimum wage kids that just don't care about being there and I get it you know it's a job I worked the job at a laser tech place before so I understand what it's like but like they don't know anything that's going on there like they have stuff that they advertise the website like about like a membership that you can do so you get a membership you give your own like call sign or whatever and you can scan it a card on the mission on the actual gun and it'll pop up like your name instead of the names that are on the guns normally and then also you like accumulate points towards something that happens like I think you select like exclusive weapons and stuff like that which is kind of cool so I thought oh yeah I'll do that for myself and my kids because we've been playing here for a few times and I go and ask them today about it because it is is literally one of the tabs that's on their website is membership it says ask us when you come in I'm like okay hey what about that membership thing how do I get and you sign up on that they're like I don't know what you're talking about like okay and in like the last week when we went to like we did they're like three hour thing where they're supposed to have pizza they're like pizza didn't arrive on time and they're like well we don't know where it is you can tell it's just not very professional with the kids right but like I met the owner last night and you know he obviously knows what's going on he has another arena in San Francisco as well and he commutes up here to run it sometimes but like he was dead it was dead on a Saturday night and that's not a good sign it's not a good sign they don't have anything in their lobby like it's just empty they have some ticket redemption games and like even today like when we were leaving there was I don't know what it was it looked like a rehab group or something like that but a bunch of old dudes and looks like some other people with like uniforms on that like we're taking him in a van back somewhere I don't know but okay I assumed it was like drug rehab or something like that and so they were taking him back and they gave us like a big thing a big stack of tickets so here you go you know your kids can get some of the prizes here and he had like shitty-ass it's all like even like even all the tickets this is just shit it's this absolute shit let me get some chat comments over at twitch.tv slash vogue Network VG realness says if laser tag is dead on a Saturday night it won't be around much longer yeah and I know and it's it's really comes down to location and advertising I've been to places I know it's in a business park which is a it's it's it's a business park but you can see it from the road so that's good at least but I've been to another laser tag place that was also in a business park and it just didn't last because nobody knows where it is and so look for and there's no advertising they don't have much of a social media presence there's no advertising whereas the other place I went to today definitely you know a lot more popular lots of people there but they have they have their way expensive they have more of an arcade they have like some bounce house shit that's there that really I wouldn't pay any money for that and they have their only cafe so they're definitely set up to kind of run a little bit better of an operation but this place it's it's struggling and what they talk about like let me get let me get some other comment sorry I asked you 100 mats is giving you photo advice saying the camera will give you a lot of grainy footage in low light but yeah if you mess with the aperture or shutter speed and the video noise it will look better obviously more light would fix it but you can't really do that in the laser tag arena yeah at night vision will look good but the strobe lights mess it up Bobby is talking about the business park thing saying most escape rooms are in a business park and they do fine around here last night we just do one last night and it's way far back in a business park and it was pretty hopping yeah those escape rooms everyone that I've been to is in like a business park too but they advertise they get out there they do stuff online and like they really they could utilize like print advertising I think would really help them like a mailer or something like that so people know they're there only reason I found them is because I was searching for laser tech places in the area like I wonder you know where haven't I been yet and I was like oh this one's I didn't even know this was here you know and so I found it that way it ended up being pretty decent it's just they need them they need to get in touch with an arcade vendor to put some arcade games in that damn thing because they're pushing like on their birthday packages oh yeah you can get like additional tokens and stuff like that but to play what there's like literally nothing there like I I'm gonna at some point film some stuff and like put it up I thought about like reviewing laser tag places I thought that'd be kind of fun at some point so as soon as I get a camera set up to do that because only we had a camera in our pockets that goes with us everywhere we go well you know I do but like I'm talking about my action project of it yeah so I do want to do that because if you it would be fun to go out you know review a bunch of places and stuff just from a perspective of someone that played a lot of laser tag and so yeah I'm having a lot of fun with it I just wish I wish there's more people there because really on a Saturday night there should be quite a few people or even like during the day like when we went there last week there was birthday parties going through and it was pretty good but like this week there there's no one there you know and Kai's you know had made a funny comment earlier to saying you can play laser tag in your house in VR on psvr rec room and VR laser tag is a good plan B when the places are not popping true but it's just not the same thing it's like it's like saying you know you can play a football game on your you know Xbox or you can go play football for real it is and and I like you know I like the games where it actually feels like their skill involved in it like the first one I play the reason I was not really attracted to that game at all is because like I can tell I can hit I'm a pretty good shot with hitting people in games I used to bounce shots off walls and stuff like that and do all sorts of crazy shit because I believe you know I've played several thousand games of laser tag and I you know the place I play now it's just you know I can hit people just as well as I could before and cues are this other place we went to today those guns I swear to God fucking suck like I could not hit shit with those guns and it's definitely the guns because like you're aiming straight on the person's just like standing there and you just can't hit anything with it and it's just the equipment it really sucks because it's good for like if you just have a bunch of kids running around they don't give a shit you know then that's fine but like for someone that actually wants to play it you know and actually get good at it and play it with people that want to play competitively you can't when it's just like it's fucking random that your shit's gonna work or not so anyways that's enough talking about that that's fine moving on to my gaming week so as you guys know after last week's show was a shorter show because I went to Chicago on business for the week so I was out of town Monday through Friday so that really kind of put a cramp or in my ability to do gaming but I did play a shit ton of Mario maker 2 on the flight and you might wonder how do you play Mario maker 2 and your RNA have played easy I was playing the single player campaign pretty much the whole way I was yeah I mean I'm sure there's a lot to play there yeah there is and I'm probably I'm still only probably about like 50% of the way through because I'm very stubborn and I refuse to use the tools that will help you get through like if like if you die twice then the little Luigi bag comes up and says do you need help dummy like it doesn't say it that way but that's kind of like fuck you Luigi I don't need your fucking help so and as you know and I realize some people probably take full-on advantage of it right away and that's fine play games how you want to play games but I'm like no I'm gonna be a little more stubborn I really want to see because you know I feel like I make progress every time yeah and there were some like it's not just like you get this assortment of levels but then if you kind of like explore around the castle there's like this dog that offers you levels underdog or whatever offers you levels too and his levels can be really hard so I feel like in some of those levels I like make a little bit of progression every time so you know if I have four hours to kill on a flight I'm fine with you know trying to make a little bit I wish they have like you know advanced tutorials in those games it's a new dog all of the likes you know advanced techniques like the shell jumps and stuff like that that you see like speed runners and like kaizo runners dudes like yeah say how do I get good at that stuff or let's not even let's let's step back let's not even go to good how do I do that I would say I'm like half only halfway through the campaign and I think I've had to play like 25 levels and then some to you know so there's a lot of levels in there to play so yeah I was I was plenty fine entertained with Mario maker 2 and single-player modes that was pretty much like my flight I did I watched a movie as well but then on the way back the frickin like the headphone jack and the little TV didn't work so I was gonna watch another movie but it couldn't I couldn't do anything so I was like I just played that and then I played bejeweled on this because that you know how the airplane things seat backs have games on them I don't know I just played bejeweled on the on the airplane so there was that because there's so few cell phone games that'll work when it has to be an airplane mode you know so so that put a cramp in my gaming week except of the survivor LARP I'm sure you're all ready for updates on that right because I was able to play that and that was very intense a lot's been going on so remember my game started with 22 people so the 10th place person was just voted out tonight there's nine people left and I'm one of them and they announced tonight that we are all the finalists and the jury so there's so I've at least made the jury so for those of you that watch or follow survivor you know that like that's a big like accomplishment you're in every episode at that point that's yay so that's that's kind of that's kind of good I mean obviously I can't again I don't know who's watching so I can't talk a lot about the strategical stuff all I can say was that today was like a big day so yeah it was a lot going on so you know it's getting more and more intense do you want to see what we had to do for the last immunity challenge our first individual immunity challenge would you all like to see it sure last week you guys got to hear about the talking thing right yes now I'm gonna show you a physical one so because this is a physical one for the sake of the podcasters could you guys narrate what I'm doing please yes okay all right so it's cup stacking you're doing cup stacking okay stacking cups so he's gotten small end with the big end on top and then big end so it looks like an hourglass and then he's taking it and flipping it over sideways holding it together so he's holding it that way how long did you hold it yeah without using glue it's it's it looks deceptively easy doesn't it because the first time I know that's right they explained it to us I practiced it and I was like this is much easier than the last cup stacking thing we had to do this is fine but you know it's about the small so I went for about 15 minutes and my understanding is the person who won immunity went for about 28 minutes and basically what happens is that as you're kind of holding it and because you have the again for the podcast listeners you kind of like if you stack four cups but you do them inverted each time so you have like a big and small and big and smallest so you kind of do it that way and then you flip it over it is supposed to be inspired by an actual survivor challenge that was on the Micronesia season season which was the last immunity challenge which I believe is a similar thing they had to hold like a stack of things horizontally that normally would be vertical that type of thing so um and your forearms start to hurt after a while because what happens is that if there's even the slightest movement in the cup which is what happened to me about ten minutes in well I just had a movement I breathed wrong I don't know one of my cups slipped just a little bit and so now you're pushing together tighter because you're like shit they're not like the grip is kind of gone so you have to move them together tighter and then that starts to hurt your forearms faster and so it's very very interesting but I mean what an easy what an easy little thing to do that kind of makes for an interesting challenge but I think a lot of those type of online games have like minute to win it I use it you remember that old game show minute to win it they have those minute to win it style challenges so that was that was kind of what it was so anyways SSG100Matt says is Rob gonna judge the fuck out of people uh-huh especially if I get voted out uh-huh Sia Tabiri says so are you gonna be the Thorgy who makes the right decision absolutely I will make the right decision at the end of the game well why y'all assuming I'm gonna be on the jury won't I be in the finals why are you all quick to assume I'm getting voted yeah but no one trusts Thorgy anyway cuz it's a what he's a white guy with dreads all right anyway so that's that's the update on that so yeah that supposedly survivor is done in less than two weeks I've been playing that game for a fucking month and I'm like I like it's it's so like mentally draining like if I ever talk about that I do this type of shit again and it's not like all-stars or something like that like it's just like Oh Rob signed up for another game like you guys have permission to just like push me and start smacking me with the microphones over and over and beat some sense into me you have my permission so all right but I am having fun and I'm meeting some really good people so that's cool all right anyway um that was my gaming week let's talk a little bit about other things going on in gaming news so Loki watch stars off some gaming news so we talked a little bit about the joy con drift thing that was an issue last week that people started pointing out a little bit more and there's a class-action lawsuit so Nintendo is kind of addressed the issue by basically repairing these joy cons for free now and so what they're gonna be doing is allowing customers to be able to send them in they no longer have to request to provide proof of purchase for the joy con repairs they just basically send them in and it gets repaired and then if you did pay for repair previously they're gonna refund your money that you spent on that so that's good I mean they've taken advantage of this at some point and it sounds like they've kind of been cornered into caving into some of the pressure because last week we were talking about a class-action lawsuit showing up well I just wish they would just fix the design on it just fix whatever the issue is and then re you know release them with the new you know I don't know the new ones that come out I guess well then cuz you know in chat says why not just mail everybody new joy cons well obviously that's gonna be that's really expensive because considering that the fix like the piece of the replacing is really minimal yeah and so to mail out a brand new control that's kind of really and if your joy cons aren't fucked up they don't want to just send you something that is gonna set is gonna set them back on costs like you know again my joy cons are okay knock on wood you know for now they're fine but it's probably because I don't use my joy cons that much I play like I was a 90% of my switch gaming is on that pro controller and the only time I use those joy cons is like traveling when I was like on the plane I did of course I used the joy cons to play Mario maker 2 because getting out the pro controller and the switch on an airplane that's a bit much but using the joy cons and all that was was a little bit more like you know like like a Game Boy or something you know yeah really big Game Boy basically so yeah so that's about the one time I really used to joy cons but even then I'm still kind of using them attached to the system so I think it's still a different type of wear and tear than when you you know have them and you're you know waving them around or doing other stuff you don't have like third-party joy cons yet I mean I get it that you know that it'd be limited but like I'm imagining something that's like attached to this kind of a pro controller type of controller or something like that I mean a little bit beefier that you be able to that have different analog six or something would be kind of nice now cuz you and chat says no no he's always clarifying what you're saying saying I mean you call them up say it's jacked up and they mail you a new one case by case like Xbox just sent everyone a refurb when it red-ringed oh yes the coffins they would send you you have to send them your Xbox yeah so I get but in a way that is kind of what because Nintendo is offering to fix these right so but you're just not necessarily sending them you're taking them in right yeah you'd sell the mail it to them I would think it's just like the Xbox 360 I thought maybe they had like a network of approved fixers no no one can do that in store even like GameStop has their own like remember in the back of the PlayStation manual and it would say here's the approved Sony like repair shops oh I don't be like you and all of Northern California yeah but yeah no one really does that nowadays but yeah it's nice to see that they're taking care of this but really you know it shouldn't take a class-action lawsuit to finally get around to actually fixing an issue yeah it was a little bit slow-moving I think in that regard but I mean it's it's good that they're at least like stepping up and trying to fix it as opposed to just trying to shove it under the rug you know and I think we kind of we kind of knew this it's a better approach to take then what happened with the red ring where it's like oh it's a small it's just a small amount of users that are affected by it you know nip it in the ass now considering the price to fix it is probably pretty minimal yeah yeah it would just be all those shipping costs but a giant company like Nintendo gets you know buku contracts on on shipping and stuff you know so I'm sure it's not you know bad so all right well let's move on and talk about something that's going on with a Nintendo game I think a lot of people were excited about Fire Emblem that came out over this weekend right I think Fire Emblem was out on Friday so I know some people I saw some people on Twitter talking about it I have to admit not a series I super get into I'm not as into the tactical games unless it's Final Fantasy Tactics no hate I understand why people like their fire emblem but it's just you know one of those games I just don't get around to but a very interesting change happening with file a fire emblem fire emblem three houses is going to be getting it and that's the game that just came out it's going to be getting a patch that will replace the male protagonists voice so Nintendo has re-recorded the lines for male Blythe that is the name of the male protagonist because the voice actor Chris Niosi has had some allegations that have shown up against abusive behavior apparently he's also been accused of having a tendency to break and da's he has been in other games including Octopath Traveler Pokemon and Sailor Moon so he has been replaced by Zack Aguilar from the games One Punch Man and Hunter x Hunter and he was in the mobile game Fire Emblem Heroes so they're gonna basically do that so Nintendo of America had mentioned in a statement after assessing the situation we decided to re-record the characters voiceovers and Fire Emblem three houses and Fire Emblem Heroes with another actor the voiceovers will be included in a future patch the original voice actor Niosi put an apology on tumblr after an ex-girlfriend called him out for emotional abuse and so forth and he has admitted to horribly mistreating and abusing friends colleagues and even his significant others so big yikes to all that but definitely sounds like somebody Nintendo did not want to be associated with anymore I couldn't help but be reminded of sorts of I feel like we just had a story like two three months ago about Yakuza game right or yeah it was like Sega's Yakuza game it was a different type of Yakuza game right where I was saying it was a spin-off no no it well it was I think it was a spin-off but it was a Yakuza game okay and they ended up replacing the guy in that who was alcoholism a relative no he was like doing cocaine and drugs drugs are super yeah he's a actor in Japan yeah because I think I've seen him before somewhere I remember he was like a familiar-looking guy like was he like he must have been in some movie that raises anyway so he was replaced in that and it was kind of like oop he just vanished from the game but the interesting thing about patches is that it's you know I and I'm not you know what this guy did is is pretty gross and I understand why Nintendo doesn't want to be associated but you know there's going to be those collector collectible people who are gonna be like well I want to play the version that has the original guy in it because it's gonna be the more rare version so if I take my switch offline I can hear that one even though in this day and age of YouTube you would think well if you really just want to hear the subtle differences between the two interpretations the character there's gonna be YouTube's galore and things like that but it is it does create this interesting like pre patch I guess space of trying to see things before they were changed and I would think even in the case of the Yakuza game that got flipped there's probably the same type of fascination I suppose going on I think there's a good word for it fascination you know even if you're like you know you understand with the reasons everything like that there's still that that curiosity about I wonder what it sounded like originally if that makes sense hmm interesting because Bobby brings up a completely different type of situation with voice actor replacement talking about justice for Peter Dinklage which you might remember he was the original voice actor in destiny for the little shit I forgot that thing's name the ghost destiny goes right so he was the original voice that little thing and he wasn't very good no it wasn't it wasn't very it wasn't very well done so in one of the later I think was expansions like just in the middle of the night Nolan North came and replaced him like just came across the wall and replaced him as the voice actor and Peter Dinklage was suddenly patched out and that's it but that's an interesting scenario too because you know you kind of have to download those patches because destiny isn't always online persistent type of game yeah I don't think that's the case with something like fire emblems or you know that Yakuza game we had a little while ago well nowadays it is I guess remember they did some we had some similar sign into your network account they haven't you I don't want to spoil what's coming up but you all know it's they had a recall member of a little big planet remember that because the all right because the music there was the music was in there and I had one of the original versions that had like the license hadn't really cleared for it the disc got out anyway yeah well it was you know wasn't that is because there was language in there it was it was some foreign words that was offensive somehow and so right and so that they had to take this on religion or religious thing and they were that that can be shaky ground you know so but I did have the original version of that which I had it in there before they pulled it because they recalled all of them I didn't send my back um I think I ended up selling it later on but yeah it was it was gonna cry and sell it for enough yeah interest was patched out later too so yeah let's see going to chat over at a twitch.tv slash bog network pistol pakas in chat says I mean if you have a cart copy the patch isn't gonna overwrite that data right no I would imagine it wouldn't so I mean all you would have to do is delete the local data for the game from your switch and it's only gonna be I mean you may not be able to play online you may not be able to do some of the things that because I believe if you do not have the most current version of a Nintendo game it won't let you play online until you patch it but you can play it offline and connect it to the internet and that's how you know I imagine people would do it but most people aren't gonna bat an eyelash or they they just put their switch on the dock overnight and it's on their home network so the thing's just gonna update whether you want it to or not and most people are never gonna know that this voice actor was just suddenly replaced but yeah it's just it's just it's also this interesting day and age that we live in where they can do that type of stuff where they can remove music from Grand Theft Auto San Andreas because they run out of the license runs out yeah patch it out of the game which is annoying sg100 Matt reminds us of another case recently John Tron was taken out of ukulele because there's you know controversy there as well so we'll just leave it at that so there's what happens when you're a shit to people so yeah well don't be a shit to people for one but yeah so anyway okay so better to be the shit then be a shit okay so we kind of touched a little bit tangentially there another issue that's all over the internet this week so dark Sakura tell me a little bit about what's going on here Oh shenanigans oh sorry real quick because quest buster with a great comment about this isn't just games in this day and age quest buster says reminds me when Ridley Scott literally reshot everything that had Kevin Spacey in it for his movie all the money in the world replacing with Christopher Plummer that's right they do that in movies too so obviously Kevin Spacey yikes so they reshot everything that was somebody else and didn't I think that Christopher Plummer got an Oscar nomination for it because I think in Hollywood you know they kind of you know Hollywood's a weird it's almost like they kind of knew like he did that last minute until it so he kind of got an Oscar nom for it was interesting anyway all right now we can move on sorry I thought that was a very interesting comment like oh it's not just games well okay so as a lot of people know the first three doom games kind of had this mass release on consoles and mobile devices but it had this Bethesda login requirement and remember playing doom on the PC back in the day when you had to log into your Bethesda account in order to get connected on doom 2 with your friends yeah exactly it's like login to be net remember that Bina is battle net also like what is that about Bina is battle net well it anyway they are patching that out it caused a lot of memes it was great but they put out an announcement and I'll just read it directly this came out on the 27th so this was yesterday update on our new classic doom releases the Bethesda net login requirement was included for the Slayer's Club to reward members for playing the classic doom games the login should be optional and we're working on changing the requirement to optional now we're just trying to help you know the best part about that is players club so like since they got rid of the original versions they delisted those which had multiplayer by the way and then these don't have the online multiplayer they don't have the online multiplayer the whole point why the fuck else do you play doom 2 for the story local multiplayer reading playboy for the articles get the fuck out anyway honestly I'd never liked to play multiplayer doom I like to multiplayer Duke Nukem but I didn't like to play doom multiplayer I just like to play by myself I love to doom to multiplayer I used to there was a BBS we would call into and it would help connect your doom games and I was I think I was rocking my was it my 386 still didn't know what could have it I think was my 486 for a 100 megahertz at the time and I would play doom in a tiny ass window so that I could actually have the fluid motion when I was playing online it was so fun like kids today wouldn't understand I had black and white doom format classic that I would sneak and play during the middle of my typing class in college at any rate you know the games are out now doom and doom 2 or 499 and doom 3 is 999 and you can play them on iOS and Xbox PlayStation for Xbox one Nintendo switch and Android so yeah none of them have the multiplayer we don't really that is so stupid because I have the one on Xbox 360 which they made backwards compatible with Xbox one so it's in your Xbox one library and as far as I remember you can still play that one online I don't know anybody else with ad listen to that so you can't sell so that you can't get it again you can't buy it we'll just build some 486 and have some land go on seriously we need to do we need to do a PC do night hell yeah or Duke Nukem honestly Duke Nukem was the best at all I like the voice macros oh yeah like Duke Nukem was like the the creme de la creme of those 90 shooters I think because that's the one I remember playing in the college dorm we would be yelling each other from down the hall like when we get killed that was those were the days anyway so what were some of your favorite memes you guys saw of course Bobby black ones Bobby black wolf in our chat he did a little thing on his podcast I hit a little graphic that came up that said yet needed Bethesda announcement can't counsel listen to podcast I'm sure somebody clipped it and it's over on Twitch I'll be honest I didn't really see all that many he also did one for his Tesla which is funny oh yeah the one he did for his Tesla was funny yeah I saw Tesla being towed yesterday that wasn't Bobby's Tesla Bobby did something on Twitter where I think there must be a drawing app or something on those big screens and he put like you must log into your Bethesda net account to turn on your car so that's something like that I'm paraphrasing but yeah that was pretty funny yeah I thought there were I just thought some of the classic 8-bit memes were great with the whole like you know you must log into your Bethesda net account to find our princess in another castle you know things like that just good stuff you got it you got to love Twitter going crazy with the memes good stuff anyway it's always fun when Bethesda is a joke which is all the time nowadays I just why would you put out something again like I get the whole like oh we want to put doom on iOS and and all that stuff why would you take out the multiplayer like just I'll take I don't want to run the multiplayer servers for five thousand please I guess I don't know I don't know what that's all about that's unfortunate isn't there some reddit out there I swear to God I saw some reddit where it was like will it run doom and it's them installing do because the doom source code was public some time ago I think I think they made it for somebody so they get doom running all these things because I remember recently there was some type of exploit within it was either the Harry Potter game or Pokemon go game one of those games you could launch a full-on web browser from within the game so somebody had them playing doom within Pokemon go and like that's the type of shit you see on reddit we're like you know running it's called like running doom or doom I don't know but it's it's what what can you install doom on so it's it's weird that this is so timed where it's like yay we got doom on iOS and all this stuff but we fucking changed it it's a little silly no no just just played on PC like you have a PC that runs I know if you have a PC you have a PC that runs doom you sure do Bobby Blackwell says yeah you know this will open next year's e3 presser you think they're gonna be that tongue-in-cheek enough to start their e3 presser and then have a splash screen saying you must have your Bethesda net account to continue I could see them phrasing it a different way to poke fun at it they might say it like they might show a sample login screen please log into your Bethesda account and then the person I would think that they are not gonna do that and the reason because we're talking like almost a year away I mean why bring that memes shelf why bring why bring that back up why why remind people that you fucked up in a way because I'm sure between now and June of next year they're gonna fuck up in it dozens of ways that are gonna be far greater than what we have with just doom so honestly think next year's e3 presser they just open with the theme from the Elder Scrolls and then show show off Elder Scrolls 6 and it's just like this at this point at this point they should just fucking mock the South Park I'm sorry video and just have Todd Howard apologizing to be fair to the folks in chat as 200 Matt says they were able to joke about themselves about fallout 76 they will rip themselves plenty oh yes and that worked out so well for them they brought up fallout 76 stuff as soon her Matt says they made jokes about the arrow to the knee stuff in the presser do you know like I've heard that joke was in Mortal Kombat 11 oh yeah I heard that arrow to the knee stuff so fucking much that when I was do you remember I randomly started playing Skyrim VR when I was like getting in place in VR like I got to the point where the guy really says that and I did I'm like is this guy being a meep oh no oh this is the actual arrow to the knee part like I had that like whoa meta moment type of thing going on like oh it's an arrow to the knee Joe oh wait no this this is the arrow to the knee line I am it was great it's like you have those guards to say that and then they run straight up to a dragon started hitting it with a sword and get like torched by fire and they're like yeah I was actually watching like all the intros on Mortal Kombat 11 to get the references and it's totally a line even today yeah my favorite is the mod for Skyrim whenever they say that line they get struck by lightning see a tiberian chat says it's like right in front of my salad oh I still use that today in fact I was I think the last time I used it was in one of these type of games I think it was like the survivor II type games I think it was a different one that was going faster and something happened that I didn't like and I said to the other person I was like really right in front of my salad you're gonna do that so those those memes oh you know so there was a gay porn that was shot and I don't know what they're doing oh they're full-on like having sex in the kitchen but they're doing it like the counter is up here so they're like down here and the girl who I don't know if she's supposed to be somebody's girlfriend or she's like you know the the fruit fly the flame dame type of thing or what but she's like eating your salad and she's like she looks and she goes are you guys fucking and she goes really right in front of my salad that's pretty great and honestly that would be me it was I'd be like don't do that in the kitchen that's in sanitary it was it was improved I think and now of course of course she is now like famous you know she's making her coin off that whole thing I think they put her in legit movies and stuff you know they made a sequel to a poor she's not even a porn actress she was just like the salad chick but now she's getting in all these porns because she's the salad girl she's the solid salad tosser but honestly that would be I'd just be like that's unsanitary don't do pixel pakka says that porn company has a weird thing about girls discovering the screwing and Sia Tiberi says it's the girlfriend the one guy is pretending to be an in-home cooking class thing for the boyfriend and then it went to like sex okay I guess they thank you all for explaining the plot and for your later brows all s 200 Matt has linked to these safe for work version on YouTube if you wish to go look at that I'm going to assume that there's black bars because it's on YouTube covering up the like I'm offended by I'm just offended by you seen one you see them all I'm afraid that salad dressing oh yeah she's just like it's also the way she says it she's like really anyway tall counter to me baby oh it's a bar nevermind oh I see maybe this whole meme thing does have weight cuz here we are talking about the salad chick and that was like two years ago we are we that I'm saving that now so I can watch it when I get home okay yeah yeah you got to do homework sure all right anyway let's move on all right Loki then if you don't like this topic how about a new one we'll talk about grand theft auto online and you know there's been an issue with blue boxes being compared to gambling and you know that a lot of companies can get in trouble because of in-game gambling mechanics might kind of run afoul of some online gambling laws well take two said fuck all that let's put gambling in our games so they opened up the diamond casino in Grand Theft Auto online so you can actually go in there and buy chips and gamble and you win money and of course because this is Grand Theft Auto online you can buy shark cards with real money and get in-game money to gamble with and stuff like that so because of that issue certain countries can actually purchase the in-game cards or even do some of the gambling games in there because of different local laws so for example Iceland Iran Peru and Vietnam are some of the countries that you can't access most of the casino and also that certain things you can't you can't buy the penthouse in the casino as well and you're not actually able to virtually gamble in there so it's interesting that they have to go this route to kind of get around the different laws but what happens when you put actual gambling in your game granted yes you can't actually get real money from this but you can pay real money for in someone with gambling tendencies wants to win that in-game you know money to buy like some fake car in there they may be tempted to drop real-world money to buy chips and so it's kind of an issue no that's something fascinating that I wouldn't have thought about is that you might have like this like real-world gambling you know issue and that you kind of act out through online games because maybe it's less of a problem because it's it's a fake game but in the same time yeah I mean you could get like if someone has gambling tendencies and you're you're betting like fake money you're still gonna have the same response like to that even though you're not winning real money and because of that you're like oh man no I'm down I just need to I only pay I'm gonna pay ten dollars and we get some more money and then I'm gonna get back on top of him win that money back you could have like that same kind of tendency and they fucking know what they're doing they fucking know what they're doing they know people are gonna there's some people out there they're gonna do that and they don't care because they're making money off of it so it is what it is some people though of course being the internet age are getting around these restrictions by using VPNs because they can so even this won't necessarily stop them but that may be illegal in your country if you do that interesting all right well let's move on to another topic this is one that I think many of us have unfortunately had to deal with when playing games and maybe you know earlier we were kind of having a laugh about the doom online and the fact that it's been removed but you know some of us maybe aren't playing games online the way we used to and the reason why is because of assholes harassment is really what it is and this week making its way around the gaming blogs is a new survey by the Anti-Defamation League or ADL and as part of their report they reported that as many as two-thirds of online gamers in the US have experienced it had experienced what they called severe harassment half of the responders of the survey said that their race religion ability gender sexual orientation or ethnicity was something that made them a target and 30% claimed they've been doxxed in an online game that one really that seems so high all they had to do is ask a woman oh yeah no I would have told him it's no it's and don't like I'm absolutely not going like wow I can't believe it's this rampant like don't get me wrong like I'm it's absolutely it's this rampant and I'm sure but I'm just the 30% docs I'm like that's Wow that's scary and a quarter of respondents said that online they have been exposed to white supremacist ideology that also being a part of the ADL report which obviously is a whole nother yikes and you know just leave it at that but unfortunately I think those of us that have been on a rando map online or something unfortunately yeah I've heard all I've heard all that stupid shit when playing things like destiny and halo and that type of stuff online with randos and it's why I really don't like fucking playing with randos online anymore I don't fucking do it on Xbox Live or this Xbox Live is for playing with my friends vog network people are fine because I feel like if you are at the level enough where you want to come hang with us in online clubs and things like that then you kind of know you accept these rules of you're not gonna be a fucking asshole because you know Bobby'll ban you if you do I want like though there to be team mute that you vote and you mute somebody I want to say and I could be wrong I want to say either halo or destiny did put something like that in that if enough people kind of muted somebody that person would be muted but I don't quote me on that but I want to say that is something that has been explored in the I want ostracism to be a thing they have to be careful because some people could use that type of voting system to gang up on an innocent person that's the problem is that the bad guys are gonna use it for their own purposes too that's that's and that's why I think you haven't seen that stuff if stuff implemented more widespread I just really want like Jean Grey level psychic power so I can reach across the country and smack them in the head because Nazis deserve to be punched misogynists deserve to be punched metal mayhem and chat says not just gamers but streamers too oh sure that's one reason where it's like you know olr we get anywhere between what like 25 maybe 45 maybe 50 at our peak viewers that we get live we have about 33 on right now if my little console is to be believed we have more than that that listen on the podcast feed but you know we have a we have a decently sized crowd that turns up here on Sunday nights and we're really appreciative but I like that we're kind of like at that level where we're pulling a respectable crowd here people people actually want to listen to what we're doing and we appreciate that I love it and they want to participate in the conversation that's wonderful too but we're not big enough where the fucking haters are coming out or the people that are just there to get a reaction are coming out like that's a problem that you're more twitch partners and the people that have you know 200 people that watch one of their streams that's the stuff they have to deal with so in a way like you know and I've been asked kind of point-blank are you are you irritated that you're not more famous and it's one of those things where it's like I don't know like then I if we were bigger we'd have to deal with all that shit and I don't know how I feel about that I kind of I feel like we're almost better off in a way not having to deal with that so um guys you doing chat says I play online a lot and no one ever talks once in a blue moon I think the missing word there I see some nasty text in rocket League but most of the time people never use voice chat it may also depend on what you're playing and I know I don't use voice chat because I got sick of the things people were saying on voice chat so if I do play games online I don't use it now it is worth saying I do play things like Final Fantasy 14 World of Warcraft in the past I've played those types of MMOs online but I think it's harder to be that much of an asshole in those games because usually you're working together towards a common goal and if you're gonna be that guy then you're not gonna get to the goal either and granted don't get me wrong and I know full well know some people exist in in those things only to troll and I've seen my fair share of them in World of Warcraft but even the trolls will oftentimes end up they end up on block lists and then when they want to do something for real later on they can't because they've pissed everybody off on the server so anyway some other comments I wanted to read about this report and then we can stew on it a little bit if we want online harassment is getting worse and a similar ADL survey this according to past studies that was conducted earlier in the year talked about that 37% of Americans have experienced severe harassment online online gaming meant when they kind of analyzed that the ADL survey said 65% of players experienced severe harassment when it's the online gaming now just some things about the survey ADL sampled about a thousand people and to be fair the gaming community at large is trying to figure out what they can do about this for example Phil Spencer from Xbox recently had that post about laying out things for combating abuse saying that you know gaming is for everyone period overwatch they put in the endorsement feature so that you you kind of reward people as opposed to punishing people and they say that the endorsement feature reduced toxic behavior by 40% so some things to consider but obviously harassment is still a thing I don't know without going too deep what what can we do about it what can us decent people do about harassment and I think there's definitely like number one I think the obvious thing would be you know call it out when you see it like if somebody's getting harassed you know as much as you might not want to or something like that you have to kind of stand up for the underdog a little bit right but I think the reality of the situation is that most of us are just pulling out of these situations where we even get to where the bullies are and like I said I just play with friends done like this is why I don't get in these mixed situations so I don't know thoughts yeah calling it out I think just reporting people that are you know doing this kind of harassment and I mean I don't know just playing with friends yeah guys you doing chat says anytime I hear a jerk picking on someone I fight back as Jonah to Matt says the report did say the 88% of players who play certain games like Warcraft had very positive experiences as voice chats and you know I think especially like but in Wow and in Final Fantasy and those types of games you find your guildies you kind of find your tribe you find your people and you're on voice chat with those people and like people are gonna treat each other with respect because again you're helping each other out you're all get you're all getting epic purples or whatever the equivalent is in the game you're playing you know pixel pockets and chat says any game I play I immediately mute voice chat for all and I'm silent myself it only took a few shitty people to make me decide it's not worth it with random people I'll just chat with my friends and that's more fun anyway yeah I'm kind of right there with you all right well anyhow let's move on and talk about other voice issues right dark soccer what do you have well this one um I don't really know how I feel about it but basically Microsoft is gonna be tweaking their Xbox one dashboard again and this time they're removing Cortana I don't know it's still on PC and Windows 10 right the Cortana interface I don't I believe Cortana still on Windows 10 yeah but at any rate they are removing it and redesigning things and it'll bring everything into one area where you can see it right away so it's supposed to give you quicker access to your past titles mixer service community and Microsoft Store and so they're just I guess in the long run trying to make it a more efficient thing but Cortana is going bye-bye I guess they do need to kind of clean up some of that extra stuff on Xbox one and I can't I can't think of a time where I've been like Cortana take me to the store to buy Castlevania or something you know it's just doesn't really happen but yeah the big thing on here is that yeah you can no longer talk to her via your headset you can still power on your Xbox one through Xbox skill for Cortana on iOS Android or Windows so that's true because there might be for some people that might be an accessibility thing so I don't just want to like say well it's useless for me so fuck it because I could there could be a very big reason why it could be an accessibility thing for Cortana to help you navigate there's more they basically are refocusing Cortana for the business scenarios and are working on conversation recognition but they did decouple her from the Windows 10 for the May update and they are making Cortana a separate app hmm so interesting well it's good that it's still there because I bet there are some people that kind of need Cortana s2100 Matt and chat says Cortana was initially used with your Kinect after they killed that off you could still do it with your mic now it's gone Bobby Blackwell says I used Xbox record that a lot but Cortana took it away and mental mayhem says to be honest when I first got Windows 10 I tried Cortana just for the lulls but it got boring quick all those comments from our chat room over at twitch TV slash vog network so there you go Cortana will no longer be a part of the Xbox one after well unless you use some workarounds and things like that after a future update let's move on a few more stories for you guys then we're gonna get to the classic game of the week Loki yes so this is kind of neat there's a brand new I don't know spirit not really unauthorized spiritual successor I guess of Simon's quest so there's a game that's coming out that someone's working on called Simon quest Transylvania adventure and it's kind of homage or parody of Simon's quest and it's like a indie game that hopefully won't get struck down by you know a DMC a or something like that but it definitely is got the same type of stuff that you would see in Simon's quest they said convoluted hints mansions and a time system that doesn't make you wait and apparently they're working on a demo so this is a the Twitter user program answer and looks pretty cool so far just based on the little video that he posted definitely get the vibe of Castlevania a little too much though I was gonna say I getting some cease-and-desist vibes on yeah you know at what point does parody end and copycat yeah I don't get me wrong like it looks great it looks really cool like I love the retro vibe it's giving and you know and and just how much it kind of invokes Castlevania but it's kind of this different thing obviously um and I understand that like they're trying to like not use the Castlevania name but Simon quest yeah maybe you should have renamed your protagonist maybe why don't they call like castle quest or well I guess that was probably a name of the game sometime at some point or like you know Simon adventure yes something something to get it a little more distant from that so hmm it looks neat hope it comes out Sia Tabiri suggests Trevor quest in our chat room Trevor quest yeah use one of the other all right Belmont's why not yeah I don't know I'm definitely looking forward to checking out if it actually ends up coming out apparently though they were supposed to have a playable version of it at Con Bravo so I don't know we'll see but I'm guessing there's I'm guessing Konami doesn't exactly have the rush the rush between you know C and D versus it being out now it's that stuff at the end of your project tears we're just like hey look I made this game it's done now you can see India it's too late yeah pixel pocket suggests the name no me's quest that's Simon backwards SSG 100 Matt suggests the title love Simon quest I guess how about how about they they could just change the protagonist Simone's quest Simone's quest own Raven Simone ace quest let's not do that why not see a debris just Dracula scavenger hunt the adventure all right anyway let's move on let's talk a little bit about something that is going to be going away from the Wii U for those of you that are still using your Wii U which there might be some of you out there I mean even though I'm sure many of you have updated to the switch there might be some reasons to keep your Wii U around but as of September 26th if you do use a Wii U to watch Amazon Prime video you'll no longer be able to do that prime video users are starting to get emails letting them know that they no longer to be able to do that and this is kind of interesting a $25 credit towards buying fire TV devices to help that feel a little less now I want to just fire up my Wii U and open the no I'm not gonna get a fire team all right the email says we are continually upgrading our service and this occasionally means we can no longer support certain device models to help you continue streaming your favorite content we're offering you a $25 credit towards select fire TV devices which will allow you to continue to stream your favorites from prime video so if you're using the Wii U for this you still have Netflix YouTube and Hulu today but who knows how much longer that is going to be now it should be pointed out Amazon Prime is not on the switch some of these you know I think YouTube's on the switch at this point Hulu's on the switch but not Slick's no not Netflix Netflix ain't on the switch and Amazon Prime isn't on the switch so this isn't as easy as just going over to the switch and I will say you know what I I have used I do remember downloading prime video onto the Wii U and using it because my broadcast signal from the Wii U was strong enough where if I had Amazon going on the Wii U I could take the tablet into the bedroom and watch an episode of Drag Race or something from the bedroom so you know they're there may be some uses why somebody wants to take that tablet and watch it somewhere else their house a little portable television so but I guess at the same time if I wanted to I could just use my phone but the Wii U had that kind of bigger screen you know yeah I mean it's nice but I understand that they don't need they want to support it but I'm not gonna profess that I've like used it at all ever recently they probably figured out that the numbers aren't really you know there as far as the number of users and so it makes sense that they would probably retire mm-hmm let's see I wanted to read some other comments in chat Bobby Blackwell points out twitch also isn't on the switch no that's I mean I think we all understand be too easy twitch on the switch well and we understand that the switch probably isn't going to let you broadcast stuff because of you know the the parts that are in it maybe when there's a pro maybe that's something I'm looking at for the pro hmm who knows we'll just theorize on that oh I have the pros I have a pro switch to do streaming services I bet that'll be a thing but anyway but it's surprising that you don't at least just have the twitch like watch stuff client that is a little weird I think yeah I don't know I'd love to be able to have that so anyway as 200 Matt says most companies are like this is gone in blank days if you have problems with this kick rocks yeah so it's it's kind of true that you know they didn't have to offer the $25 incentive on the fire TV or whatever but they are but I think Amazon probably discounted the price by 25 bucks on Prime Day anyway if not more than that so I'm sure Amazon takes a loss I mean because it's almost like game consoles the more fire TVs that are in home the more people that are likely to buy stuff on the Amazon Prime video thing so it kind of suits them to have that in as many places as possible so I don't think this is just them being the nice guy if you will all right anyhow as 200 Matt says maybe it'll let you stream from the switch but only at 480 P let's see your streams are gonna be crap quality all right let's move on to the classic game of the week every week dark soccer steps in the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks hey you guys should be remembering this game this week I'm kind of surprised you're doing this game this week this is a big one and I thought you might have would save this for an anniversary show or something yeah yeah I thought we'd already done this one too I also thought we'd already done this one I think just with me being kind of in music game mode it stuck out in my head it's fair and it's also one of those congratulations this game is 10 years old type of moments actually right now it's 12 years old all right so what is the game rock band there you go so I just want to point out usually on the podcast we have a little bit of the game's audio in the background um however tonight we have removed the audio just because we don't want to risk a twitch muting for the copyright music so we only have the visual writing on twitch you can get like something like Charlene I'm right behind you or whatever like I just I didn't want to risk it even with the freebie songs so it's fine if you yeah y'all probably you're already familiar with rock band I imagine this crowd pretty familiar with rock band already yeah anyway so rock band is a music game is developed by harmonix it was published by MTV games and distributed by EA and we are talking about the first game in the series it was out for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 released on November 20th 2007 and there was a PlayStation 2 version it was released December 18th 2007 so also a Wii version on June 22nd 2008 harmonix had also developed the guitar hero series and then when the guitar hero was sent off to never soft harmonix made the new game with multi-instrument gameplay so sort of like having your guitar in one game instead of spread out amongst all of the various you know I guess it actually was kind of like the guitar you know by having the multiple instruments except you you know it grew from there from just you know guitar and drum and mic and there have been like a bajillion sequels you know of rock band so we won't even be getting into there but basically you've got your different peripherals you have you know of course your on-screen interface is what controls how you're supposed to do it with the mic you have to sing to relative pitch to the original vocal so I know some people who just may as well not fucking use the mic because they can't you know hold a tune in a bag there's nothing also by the way that will set off like my own self loathing of my voice than playing ink on the mic in garage band just saying I hate hearing myself out of key but you know you also have you know your guitar one person can be bass and you've got your drum kit later on of course you know we got the piano and the cymbals and all these other goodies so at any rate you build up your score you get different multipliers and you have an overdrive that lets you just you know apparently play really awesome and then you can use like on the guitar you use your whammy bar for like using effectors for how you're playing you know example you've got different difficulty levels easy medium hard and expert and if you don't play well enough you get muted out of the song so there you go um the PlayStation 2 and we version didn't have any customizable options for your player but Xbox 360 and ps3 did so you could change their physique their clothes tattoos the way they move all kinds of stuff and then you know again we had a the guitar was based off the Fender Stratocaster you had you know your your drum pedals you also have like your game modes like band world tour where you could play in different venues and unlock things and customize your character even more you also have like solo play you have a solo tour and the soundtrack pretty massive so they reached out to five record labels that provided most of the master recordings including EMI Hollywood Records Sony BMG Universal Music and Warner Music well actually for Warner Music specifically it was Rhino Entertainment you know you know what I remember about Rhino Entertainment is that when I was young I had a bunch of albums that had the old Rhino logo on it and that's how I always remember Rhino Entertainment but they had you know the Wii version had five additional songs by the way over some of the others they had Danny California don't fear the Reaper understand man here it goes again highway star and learn to fly oh and suffragette city and when I dead or alive and won't get fooled again so those are bonus you could also get downloaded you know track packs and single songs so like to date one thousand four hundred and eighty downloadable songs are available that's a lot of music but at any rate like I said it was developed by a harmonics post guitar hero and red octane and made the the it looks like red octane was making the peripherals but yeah we never soft took over development of guitar hero well harmonics had to go somewhere I had to do something and so they started in February 2006 working with different designers for prototyping the instruments for developing an all-new hardware bringing in things like your drum support and they just kept working on it from there and it ended up being you know such a big hit like I said we've got so many so many other peripherals and it's so many other releases that it just just really moved right along they did have licensing fees for using some of the wireless technology especially for Microsoft and if they had chosen to pay for it they would have actually released the different versions at different costs so they used wired technology to start off with it so so anyway yeah it's got a massive online community at rock band calm and now I mean remember we used to help out with them loud the charity event where you basically play rock band on stage I used to do some of the graphics but it was I mean there's all these like weird special editions too like there's Green Day and I think there was Beatles rock band that was a big deal but you know as it came out you know they also were learning that of course some of the guitars from other games were incompatible for example the Gibson Les Paul guitar controller that came with guitar hero 3 was not compatible with rock band even though harmonics said that they had an open controller support but basically harmonics and Activision we're just pointing fingers back and forth harmonics put out a patch Activision blocked it so who's the bad guy here and then but Activision then announced that guitar hero world tour would use the rock bands instruments and just drama at any rate though rock band was very highly received for most of the American reviewers you didn't get a score under a nine on that scale or a five stars or an a so they were all very excellent won so many awards best multiplayer experience innovation awards across the board best music game and Xbox magazine said best reason to move to a bigger house award this I mean this game really was like it was just so like like transformative I mean between you really have to kind of co-credit this and like a tar hero and just you know with the whole like plastic instrument revolution and sure those of us that have been music game fans a little bit longer such as you know us here at OLR and some of our longtime listeners obviously we remember what was about guitar freaks and importing the stuff from Japan the beat media 2dx controllers and things like that but Konami and you know we talked about this ad nauseum in our first 180 episodes Konami was never willing to really take that risk with the US audiences until it was too late the Japanese arm of the company was too fucking stubborn even though the American side was telling him do it do it do it they were too fucking stubborn until I think it was really too late to hit the momentum on that and then by the time they finally did get it on it it looked like a fucking knockoff of this because it was rock revolution when Konami finally got it was just a bad fucking version of this so you know it was it was really guitar hero 2 probably in many ways I would say and then like this as a definitely follow-up with charter 3 that really kind of like pushed that plastic instrument revolution and just started music gaming in the u.s. well there also did have effects on the actual music industry their Viacom was saying that it was averaging the sale of 1 million downloadable songs every nine days and for example Motley Crue's single Saints of Los Angeles debuted as a rock band track the same time that the album released some of the tracks that were specific to rock band actually ended up being later on we released for example Rush's alternate working man only which one of my favorite songs ever we actually like ran out of video and that was some guy playing a 10-minute song but in any way the alternate version of working man that was released only for rock band was so well loved that Rush released that version as a download through iTunes and started making some of their albums available like moving pictures was was released in the game two months after all this so I really want to go back and play again on my Xbox one because I have rock band for on Xbox one but like I remember I was having a lot of problems getting the instruments connecting like weird shit was happening and I got so frustrated I just stopped but for me the real peak of the rock band series for me was rock band three because I love the keyboards I'm like the one person that loved the keyboards that was so awesome and I wish I wish the keyboard thing had taken off more mmm I was just reading about some of the litigation with Gibson guitar and Konami's lawsuit and everything oh sure yeah but I mean basically a Viacom did a counter suit against Konami saying that rock band improves on Konami's original patent and that rock revolution used controllers are similar to rock band so they both settled and there you go there you go I also want to give a shout out for rock band blitz I wish they had made that one backwards compatible 360 there's also mention of frets on fire oh yeah when the like a computer yeah and then of course we had you know coming out of that there was rock Smith to where you actually could play a real guitar that was much different it was but I don't know how much laid off the concept yeah I don't know how much I can say but I know somebody who worked on that game so and so do you know yeah I'm saying that I don't know that it would be out oh yes you're not for oh yeah definitely definitely like again it's all about that risk right nobody would have taken a risk on a game like rock Smith if rock band and guitar hero too hadn't like put it out there there was that and I'm sure somebody asked that question well you know everybody's fake jam it why don't we teach people how to play a real guitar why we do this for real maybe there's a way and that's what rock Smith dead well and on top of that though in the later releases of rock band you had the pro modes where they had the guitars and the keyboard I love the cute because you really were playing the keyboard parts if you played it in pro yeah it's pretty cool yeah it was awesome but Bobby talking about rock band blitz they only had the music licenses for a couple years for the songs they ended up delisting rock band blitz it's I look Robin blitz was just it was all the DLC you already had for rock band but then you played it in like an amplitude kind of game and I loved it so cool so all right there it is your classic game of the week rock band one of the greatest all-time classics really especially for us music game fans love it that's the type of game that brought us all together and so I'm assuming were they playing this a California extreme did it get you kind of thing oh yeah you said they're playing on stage right yeah but I didn't play but you I saw it along with it though yeah because they you know started singing the cure I also did karaoke this last week cuz that's my fun stage I'm just singing it at the vendor booth no but I did real karaoke I met up with some of my friends in Chicago we went out to one of the bars for karaoke it was fun I was basically show me show me show me how you do that song that's one of my favorites but I was singing it over there and some kid was looking over just grinning it was pretty funny mm-hmm you were singing classic rock all right let's move on let's get into some rapid fire news and quickly travel around the world with some other headlines and what's going on in gaming so Loki won't start us off all right so we've got a couple things here so one it's a little bit of a preview of what we can expect from gamescom which is just around the corner supposed to take place on August 20th through the 24th and thq Nordic is apparently gonna have some new games to announce as well as showing off some additional things including their remake for destroy all humans they also have a remake for spongebob squarepants battle for bikini bottom a rehydrated and apparently the strategy game of desperados 3 and Darksiders Genesis but they're supposed to be announcing also new games as well during that time so I guess we'll have to wait and see what that is thq Nordic I'm hoping that one of those is a no-saints program but you know I'm I'm highly skeptical that gonna be something in the same universe ages of mayhem 2 yes that game really was not terrible enough and we have to make a sequel to make it even worse and then finally this is kind of cool grand theft auto 3 Liberty City may remember that game that's pretty old but now you can actually play in the Liberty City map from grand theft auto 3 in beam and G so for those not aware of what beam and G is it is a physics based driving game which basically you kind of do whatever you want in it but mostly it's to crash your car in very unique ways but now you can crash your car in very unique ways all over the map of grand theft auto 3 and it looks awesome and of course it's not something that you can necessarily download and via the official like mod repositories but there's a thread in their forum on beam and g.com so go check it out there and it looks awesome I don't know if I don't think I have beam ng but I've seen lots of videos of people playing it I do want to probably pick it up now all right moving on to a hackers gonna hack story because we love these around here at olr this has to do with somebody getting Android running on the switch that's right XDA are the homebrew developers that have just released an Android firmware for the Nintendo switch it's a 8-point Android 8.1 lineage OS 15.1 I don't I don't do enough Android no idea what that is um but I'm assuming just one of the operating systems one of the older ones probably not one of the newest ones and so compatible models will do it there are of course it's buggy it's got battery life issues some of the rotation some sensitive touchscreen input but everything in there otherwise would work so basically it will turn your switch into an Android tablet with a pair of controllers this is something you're basically flashing the firmware on your switch to be this so you're losing your Nintendo switch so you know only if you really really really are into fucking with your hardware do you want to do something like this apparently it is based on androids a division that works with the Nvidia shield TV so some things on the Tegra like Borderlands and Half-Life 2 will actually run on this not to say they run well but they run so very interesting with that that's a big big console mod going on there so yeah again I would not do this for shits and giggles unless you really know what you're doing with this type of modding because you're likely gonna lose access to being able to play Mario maker and things like that anyway let's talk about a story on Facebook instant games because they are going to be kind of going away kind of not really so instant games on Facebook started in the newsfeed and then they went to groups and the light app and I believe they went into the messaging app you could play games like pac-man and stuff with friends I know I've done that before but not in a long time I think it was one of those things were like oh I played pac-man with somebody on messenger okay I'll never need to do that again in my entire life like I don't think I really got into the thing in the Facebook gaming thing was also a little weird to me because like oh you can play these things on an app in your phone and most of them are just apps you can download on your phone and play there you know I mean if I wanted to play pac-man I could just download the pac-man app for my phone right but for whatever reason you know some people wanted to do the Facebook messenger gaming because excuse me probably some more of the social features and things like that well games are gonna be moving out of the messenger app they will be moving into the Facebook gaming tab global director of games partnerships Leo Aleb said quote starting later this summer instant games will no longer be playable directly in the new version of messenger on iOS to ensure a smooth transition players and messenger will continue to access games through thread updates and chat bots while gameplay itself will app switch to Facebook quite honestly this all sounds terrible so I just is there a Facebook game I'm missing out on is there something I should be playing I don't know I blocked all of those notifications so probably not it's Farmville still a thing I don't know too I wonder if my ex is still jamming to the Farmville soundtrack all these years later I have no idea I don't know which one was this all right okay so and a pot of podcast listeners in chat want me to correct on the Android story apparently you are running it off a micro SD card you are not actually overriding your switch data I apologize I must have misinterpreted because they were talking about that you may be kind of screwing up your system to be able to play some of the other games later on so I apologize if I misrepresented that but I I still would I still would venture with this shit with caution if you really want to run an Android thing how about you just buy an Android tablet they're not that expensive they're cheaper than a switch but that's but I also the earlier in the day or earlier in the show I said but isn't that reddit where everybody runs doom on all this different shit hilarious so I get the appeal I do I do anyway back to the Facebook story kaijuto says my ex loved that Facebook MMO game forgot the name of it Oh Farmville she had me in her auction room watching her watching her seller stuff it was fun metal man has them metal mayhem says I don't give two shits about Facebook games to be honest if I were to play a game it'd be one of my games from steam or good old games good plug so I think it's it's safe to say pixel shits will not be coming to Facebook Messenger or Facebook instant or whatever the fuck they're calling it now anytime soon anyway who wants to play games on Facebook anyway you know the only game I'm playing for a while mind games do you remember though that Sims on Facebook yes I vaguely played there what's right there was like a Sim and it was thing yeah like 2d and not 3d yeah no I totally remember it that thing was nuts that was yeah okay and then like this pet game but that those weren't like things within the app that was kind of the precursor that those games were also on Google Plus games when that one and only game I played on Facebook that I had to suffer through was a stupid goddamn garage sale game part of that fucking ready player one challenge that is the only fucking game I ever played on there and that was enough to sour me off of the whole fucking platform I remember that dark to see you says I was kind of addicted to the civilization port for a little while I remember that that's right there was like a civilization game on Facebook I did words with friends a lot yeah yeah sim social that was it pixel pockets anyway that's enough about that dark soccer what do you have for rapid-fire news certainly not pixel shit right now sorry why we are the original game that we got as monster rancher in Japan it was monster farm is getting a re-release in Japan the there is a teaser website up for it but koi Tecmo has released the thing on their Twitter and it's looking kind of cute you know it's funny is that I almost picked up a monster farm yesterday because I my I'd never played monster rancher so I was thinking about getting it but I didn't but there's in the translation of this hold on let me get the translation pulled up it says oh my god why is this being slow basically it's saying that it's going to be released on an unannounced platform in 2019 and they used the word high sheen which typically indicates a digital release so it could either be it's a digital only console PC title or smartphone so and then in other news that I don't know if this makes me excited it could but Sega of Japan has filed a trademark for Knights dream wheel thinking that it could be another game in the Knights franchise it would be really nice if it did but it didn't spell Knights with a special spelling of Knights so it could be something else but if it's a if it's a a new Knights game I would be quite happy I'm surprised that isn't something they've revisited recently why not we're getting a lot of the other stuff like we night there was a wee night's game I remember that a wee little night's game but yes there's that and then of course Panzer Dragoon I think is the other kind of big one that I remember at e3 this year is pretty big deal so it'd be cool yeah all right well let's move on and travel around the world and check out some release dates and some video games coming out soon near you not a whole lot this week we've got mutant year zero road to Eden deluxe edition on Nintendo switch oxygen not included on PC Mac and Linux Madden 20 Madden NFL 20 on PC PlayStation 4 and Xbox one the church in the darkness on PC Mac and Nintendo switch PlayStation 4 and Xbox one that's it all right let's travel to Japan right now get in the car let's go on the PlayStation 4 this week on August 1st we have a game called labyrinth life sadly I don't believe this game stars stars David Bowie I think it's probably an anime based game they talk about a faint in agony flowering system interesting but it already know right yeah and I guess it also does some rock-paper-scissors type of battle and oh it looks like you can change the bus sizes on your characters well that oh yeah I think yeah I've heard this was a game I think that was it's only wasn't bringing over to the West because of they had like some of these I don't know if this is the same game series but they had one where you basically have to breed these like princesses or whatever they rescue or something like that there's some weird shit now they all right well if labyrinth life is your thing you enjoy that it's this week um also coming out of Japan this week crash team racing nitro fueled gets its Japanese release I know we've had it here for a little bit but is finally on its way out in Japan this week and if we want to go over to the Nintendo switch Oh mega labyrinth life comes out on the switch all right where you can make some Omega anyway also we've got a game called the same crash team racing is also out in Japan and the air conflicts collection gets a release on the switch this week and I feel like we just had no this is okay no this is not like an arcade shooter this is a game with air conflict secret wars and air conflicts Pacific carriers in one pack so if you are you know cuz the airplane simulator games are pretty popular overseas so if you want that you can have that dark Sakura how about the UK in the UK we don't really have very many either what is coming out on the 29th which is I guess already the 29th right now there is FIA European truck racing championship and there's mutant year zero Road to Eden the deluxe edition and then on August 1st is Madden NFL 20 so they go back to labyrinth life a little bit I just I'm just I'm just gonna read this one I mean basically you kind of get the gist of the game anyways but they said it apparently if you expand your bus with every fallen foe mighty memories lead to great greater power defeating foes builds up your Omega power in the chest increasing bus size and parameters they go all the way to a Z cup this is a Nintendo switch game by the way and apparently is coming out in the u.s. on August 1st so that is that is another that is another game that is coming out is it really yes it is are you gonna do a let's play a live stream no it's 60 bucks not paying for that but Z cups Loki oh wow you know what what I think that that's so terrible that's not even funny anymore when I know people who have had breast reductions for that kind of pain that it would cause I don't think that a part of the body should be fetished I really don't I'm just getting so sick of it we're not objects all right I mean and I'm not saying it's right but are you really surprised I should be surprised is the thing I really should be surprised I don't even know what I'm looking at here we and I really don't want to know whether fictional or not bodies need to be respected it's just fucking stupid I don't know what that is not here to glorify your fucking hormones Bobby Black Wolf in chat says Nintendo is kitty because you know Nintendo is a kids company they only put out kids games we all know that's the case of course let's see yeah some folks in chat saying excuse me Z cup yeah anyway podculture says there is such a thing as too much of a good thing anyway let's move on can we please go to the mailbag so every week you guys email us participate at orange lounge radio.com and we read our favorite emails live on air did we get any emails this week um yeah we actually got a really interesting little email that apparently they recorded you masturbating Rob how does it go what important where you have been recorded masturbating and the M is an upside down W so it's a spam message this something yes okay been washed we have to reading wow I was waster baiting I'm not even opening it and of course I'd tell you the the from who is anonymous hacker okay anonymous hacker caught me waster baiting here like here in the OLR studio or like somewhere else in the house like do they like was it was it professor plum in the conservatory with the Crisco I'm not gonna play this game anymore so that means since we got no real emails it's drag race talk what is there to talk about drag race drag race isn't on right now but I saw a funny meme okay this is every time a Republican is caught with another man a drag queen gets her heels oh because there's yet another one that got like was caught on Grindr or something yeah just today I was seeing that going around yeah it's like why be so hateful unless you just hate yourself mm-hmm just just get fucked in the ass you'll feel better no I'm serious all these closeted Republican shitholes now now we're gonna get another email about you beating off that Pikachu so please stop just hear me out hear me out this is why we don't have a lot of yours no no just just hear me out I don't think a man has to identify as gay to sometimes have gay moments you know you can be bisexual there's no problem with it being bi is valid but if you're this repressed you're this repressed because you've been denying yourself or you're doing it and you hate yourself just get fucked in the ass and be open about it stand up there and go you know what I like it I'm not gonna say it cuz someone's gonna clip me saying it and I don't like any of it but just say getting fucked in the ass is okay use your enema wear a condom and get fucked in the ass do it safely people who matter will not think any less of you for it welcome everybody to the voice of geeks Network where every geek has a voice dark soccer has chosen to use hers for a significant purpose tonight well honestly enough it's why I became a sister take the stigma out of it the moment that no one gives a shit that you're getting fucked in the ass is the moment that you don't have to hide I mean fucking a people I'm I'm in super literally is what it is I'm just saying if people stopped having such a big conniption fit over it and just I'm gonna stop explaining it shouldn't have to be explained you if you like if you like it in the but you should be able to have it just saying what what back that ass up just saying Rob do you need another drink shall we all right so speaking of getting fucked in the ass Nintendo has been really hard on people not being able to upload lots of different levels for Mario maker 2 and so because of that now they're gonna be increasing the cap from 32 to 64 and they said that also they're gonna be increasing that upload limit one more time so we don't know when that's gonna happen but sometime in the future you may be able to upload more than 64 levels which I don't understand why they're limiting everybody to do that but just in case if you think that you know your levels being deleted because you may be doing some exploits in the game are safe offline you are sorely mistaken so apparently of course like the first Mario maker people have been exploiting different glitches in the game to do all sorts of crazy stuff one of these is actually how to create a black hole in Mario maker 2 which allows you to put objects on top of each other that aren't supposed to be layered that way so you can kind of create these really crazy fire bars and different overlapping terrain including pipes and whatnot have the moon appearing in daytime levels and all sorts of crazy stuff the game will know that you're doing that of course and it will actually say that corrupt data has been found in your course has been deleted or just won't let you save the game because there's corrupt data as well and so unfortunately you know those crazy levels that people might be able to make with these exploits aren't gonna be a thing because they have patched in ways to detect those which is unfortunate but hey you know the level caps gonna be up to 120 probably someday or more I don't know why there's even a cap on the number of levels you can put out there anyways who cares like you can't tell me people that would just upload garbage but how are you gonna discover that garbage I guess it gets thrown into your feet or whatever but like the level size the download of that I mean the storage space has got to be so minimal I can't imagine why we would even limit that stuff little big planet doesn't do that and you can do all sorts of crazy shit in that why why even limit Mario maker I don't know that's the thing you haven't picked up Mario maker too yet have you I have are you making any levels um I haven't gotten to play it yet because my kids have been playing it I haven't made any levels yet that's the one thing I'm missing so I should have I should have tried like making a level one on the airplane but I just I probably will at some point mm-hmm all right anyway Bobby with the clerk's jokes in there we have 37 viewers in a row anyway moving on maybe something you want to make in Mario maker is your own pole position inspired level I don't know I had no other transition and I figure it was better than the last one pole position somebody has remade this in 3d yeah I saw that yeah and they Rob what's wrong because I was about to read the name of it and you know it's called hmm PP engine yes pole position engine so it's a it's a PP engine is a three-year Rob definitely needs an adult this episode yeah you know Bobby said try not to masturbate on your way to the car on my way to playing some PP engine which is a 3d remake of the night it's a 3d remake of the 1982 game pole position Rob can't even which is what your PP stands for but it actually reverse engineers all of the games code so it's actually following basically what you would expect the cars and the AI to do but it's modern high-definition graphics as in crashing every time you get on a curve yeah yes and all the all the like lame-looking billboards that go by and the little explosions and all of that yeah Jonathan Thomas on reddit said I started back in 2013 my god that's six years ago reverse some people do podcasts for 17 years some people spent six years on their PP engine I started back in 2013 reverse engineering the code from the original arcade ROM with the help of the main debugger and some primitive self-made tools to analyze instruction traces and create assembly source files that could be assembled back into the original arcade ROM following this I worked through the assembly source file to produce a portable c-based library containing the game logic for pole position this library was used in two projects the one you see here and another project to convert pole pole position to the Atari st a 16-bit computer that was released in 1985 I mean this is like on one hand I'm like what a colossal waste of time but on the other hand I'm like this is actually like really cool it's like the most authentic way to remake like an old game but just like put new graphics on it like they they didn't just like remake it with new programming languages that emulated like I thought that they went in and like did it from the code so that's that's pretty cool now you actually don't you have a pole position cabinet or you did like that became your main cabinet or am I mixing it up with something yeah we had a pole position and sure me moved into it remember mm-hmm because it was missing the pedal so sure me decided it was her new cat mansion mm-hmm but yeah we put a meme in that at one time and then I don't remember we sold it and then did other things now Bobby Blackwell would like to point out in our chat room at least he completed his racing game unlike some people well took him six years to do it I got time all right anyway let's move on we have a few more stories for you guys and then we're gonna get to our discord segment which I think I accidentally left off the show role but we will get to discord if you want to give us a call over at vog network or vognetwork.com slash discord but first dark soccer I think you have another kind of like video game study thing I do because I like to bring something about science into this but there is a game called driving XC which you can find at driving XC calm for $39 it's available also as a digital download for I guess they mean Xbox one and ps4 but it's a game that helps new drivers learn how to drive and on top of that in one of the interviews on here the father of the teen says it's actually helped him become a better driver that after having pay attention you know to watching his daughter play it that he started becoming a more careful driver so basically it's drivers ed the game and the guy behind it is named Bob Davis he was making the large-scale car simulators like you did you ever have the simulators in your high school for drivers ed no we had that use like a film strip to drive with and the simulators were terrible this is like also like from the 60s it was pretty bad but this guy's been making the simulator since 2005 and so his driving essentials is to help be an interactive driving simulator for teens that they could do on their own and so it's actually apparently been helping kids learn to drive better as ten different lessons starting with the basics and take you through different driving scenarios so that it gives you you know it makes you more aware when you're ready for your driving test and there's even a level where you have a phone and it forces you to look at it so you can see what distracted right distracted driving can do is even if you're at a stoplight looking at your phone can still cause an accident so just saying it's really really good way to get people prepared and like I said her dad said that it was really making him a more conscious driver too and you can get this at driving X e.com interesting you think they're using video games and more and more in the driver's ed type stuff I don't remember why we didn't do that type of stuff I feel like I feel like we were all prepping to take a test and it's like you took that test so that you could take like basically you take a driver's ed course through a private thing at 15 and a half I think or some like that was when you could do that the only thing is that it uses a standard controller wheels and pedals are not supported but I think they should put in driving wheel support you know because that's gonna just even add to the experience I'm interesting perspective from dark Tetsuya in our chat room over twitch TV slash vog network saying the doctors were convinced I shouldn't drive so I've just been using video games to live vicariously very interesting perspective there because you know some of us may not realize that oh yeah some people aren't able to drive whether it's due to a medical issue a vision issue you know whatever it is but when it comes to video games where you know it's a it's a it's a controlled environment a fake environment not not the real world you kind of get to you know experience that in a different way and as much as we've been having a laugh at pole position and the acronyms later or acronyms that come from it you know maybe that was the realistic simulator in 1982 but certainly now today the technologies come so far that when you play a game like a Gran Turismo or something it's it's so realistic you know well I'll tell you I actually learned because I hadn't driven in a while but I learned about over steering from playing Ridge Racer so just saying you know I learned how to steer myself out of a drift in other games so you know just applying some of the technique I mean yeah and I'd say you know improving your hand-eye coordination too is also helpful so you know it's funny Bobby Black Wolf I guess did some research into the pole position thing turns out that game was either that little reimagine he hasn't been working out for six years because that originally came out in January 2014 it's just making its way around the gaming blogs again this week for whatever reason whether it be to do a reddit post or something like that as these things sometimes happen but you know here at OLR it's about what is out there in gaming culture and if something gets rediscovered and is new all over again it still qualifies so I mean I I had no idea it was a thing so it's still kind of new maybe in 2019 they'll update it for VR who knows so anyhow let's move on Loki story from you all right so it's another week so we have yet another story of a epic epic game store exclusive so mech warrior 5 unfortunately is being delayed it's now set for December of this year and it will be epic game store exclusive as well so piranha games put out a press release saying our partnership with epic game store allows piranha the opportunity to make sure mech warrior 5 mercenaries meets our internal goal of creating the best mech warrior game possible we want more money since we since we announced the development of the first player mech war game in 17 years we have stated that our goal was to deliver to fans mech warrior mercenaries experience with true freedom of choice and being able to share that experience in a co-op setting by true freedom of choice we do not mean storefronts of course so yeah it was originally supposed to be coming out sooner and apparently though with that if you had pre-ordered the game you will be able to request a full refund up until September 1st hmm well so at least they're gonna do the refund thing that as I'm sure some other recent controversies like Shenmue and all that stuff the one that gets me though is the whole Tetris effect being exclusive on the epic store but then if you want to play it in VR you have to have steam because I don't think that is a requirement anymore for like the audience Oculus version or something like that oh I thought it only went with the vibe and so you had to have steam VR in order to be able to run yeah but yeah that is funny this is kind of like one of those like this is it's really weird type of thing yeah maybe it just also goes to show that you also maybe don't just think of steam as a store I guess steam is I guess more than that at this point now with the whole you know fact that there's maybe our drivers in it maybe it shouldn't you know I don't know and Bobby says the oculus version runs steam VR they didn't make it specifically for oculus last I checked steam VR runs on oculus so they just did a one-size-fits-all hmm so yeah it's kind of kind of interesting I mean I don't know like I kind of want to get Tetris effect on PC but I I already have it on PlayStation I want to be able to play it on like 4k though I think that seems like really cool but like I just feel like nothing's gonna top the VR version I might wait for a sale I think that's what I'll probably and ultimately end up doing but I do love Tetris effect that game is so good if you guys haven't played it yet so good so but I just don't see myself jumping into PC VR anytime soon I don't like I'm not the level of enthusiasts that you know Bobby or even maybe Kai's you know or some other of you guys that love your VR are at I'm kind of like I got PS VR it plays enough it suits my needs I'm good for now I'm looking forward to the no man sky thing which um you know cuz that's gonna get VR pretty soon I'm excited I thought it already happened it's like any day now the beyond updates gonna be out which I'm speaking what good timing hey Alan can I bug you to come on the show please Alan is in this new pocket hi can you come on the show will you come on the show yeah cuz I literally just brought something up that is kind of like relevant to you and what you're doing um you've been playing a game a lot recently we tell us the viewers a little bit about what you've been up to I've been playing a lot of No Man's Sky I just wanted to see what the mod community had done with it in addition to the updates that well apparently unless this guy's completely full of shit was one mod that I'm using called fantasy a lot of his work has actually been incorporated like he has a credit in some of the patches because hello games has used his stuff he made a mod to where you find a ruin and then if you use the thing that lets you dig into the earth there's actually like like kind of like archaeology where you go under the ground it's not just to find minerals but there's things you can find to sell that are actually under that's a part of the base game now and he made a mod to do that originally so I was out of town last week obviously on a business trip so how many hours would you say you plants spent playing No Man's Sky where I wouldn't be here to judge you I've started over a few times I would say from the time you left I would say around 15 or 16 hours over the course of the week so it's two or three hours a night I can't judge ask me how many hours I've been on call for my larp so it's fine yeah well I still haven't tried rez VR and you own that it's in the living room I just knew he'd been playing No Man's Sky lately and it was kind of relevant so I didn't even think about the modding community and what modding is probably done to that game on PC I bet it's something so that's cool all right anyhow let's move on oh no I want to say one more thing about the mech warrior thing so you're into like the mech games is this something you're thinking about um yeah probably not going to I used to play the like one of the mech warrior games a while back but I've kind of got him out of it all right well you know I love these little mini arcade cabinets that I have right in fact some of them are actually branded the whole my arcade thing and I think there's one over there this burger time one which isn't on cam but I'll go grab it here this burger time one is a my arcade machine and they're actually putting out a new version of this so there's gonna be something like this but I think it's gonna be a little bit bigger and for those these are the ones that they have I think a target target is where you can get these the my arcade things so actually and I should try turning it on so you guys can really see what this looks like if I can remember oh no the whole the whole bottom is the whole little like on switch and then hopefully it'll come on here and mm-hmm so sorry I'm starting it up here trying to show the folks on Twitch what it looks like but it's a pretty it's a pretty faithful reinterpretation of like burger time a lot of them are our console versions yeah they really are yeah so I think of this like Coleco or I think it's probably a little beyond that actually I know that the the Cubert one was very similar to the Coleco version with a few little bit of graphical tweaks mm-hmm so this same company the my arcade is going to be putting out a Namco museum mini player it's going to have 20 different games on it including you know you would expect pac-man pac-man 2 pac-mania but also some other interesting selections including dragon spirit that one's pretty cool rolling thunder all three of them splatter house both of those games so it's kind of interesting a little bit of a diverse selection from Namco the screen on that it's going to be four and a quarter inches so I think that's a bit larger it's probably twice the size of what I just showed mm-hmm on the twitch stream so it's a lot larger and it has but it's a more vertical screen so it will kind of be more like an iPhone type of shape or an Android you know more like the vertical shape but at the four and a quarter inches so it's gonna have 20 games in it and it's going to retail I believe for $99.99 and it's on its way out right now you can get it on Amazon and my arcade calm it is kind of expensive I mean well if you think about that that little burger time thing I just showed on cam that was about 35 I want to say maybe 30 no I think it was 30 and then the Walmart ones which is a different series those are arcade classics those set me back about 20 a pop so but I do think I do think that my arcade ones they're little you can see they're a little fancier they're a little sturdier the screens a slight bit bigger I think they're a slight better quality it's not that the arcade classic ones are bad they're really not they're good too but I think the my arcade ones are definitely like a better quality so it's interesting that they're kind of taking this one step further with this Namco museum collection but you know these things are these these retro collections and things are really everywhere so now Tigerclaw points out some of the my arcade little cabinets have a bunch of games on them and they're mostly ripoff games I think that a stranger things thing we saw recently which had come up on the show yeah it's one of those examples too and that one was a little bit cheap looking um metal mayhem says is there any device out there where pac-man hasn't appeared on by this point well if it wasn't on there voluntarily I'm sure somebody put it on there for sure so anyway yeah so that's it my arcade of Namco museum I I'm interested but I a hundred bucks is a lot of money especially for the retro stuff but I want to get more of the little cabinets the single game cabinets I love that there's stuff like wreck-it Ralph or I'm sorry fix-it Felix is the game obviously wreck-it Ralph inspired I love that that is where he needs his own game he does like along the lines of rampage mm-hmm and there's another what there was another one that was like 70 bucks I saw a target that had a bunch of stuff in it I think this might be the one Tigerclaws linking with bad dudes and there's other stuff in there too that's it was like a Data East collection yeah it's a Data East collection is exactly what it is and I think bad dudes is kind of like the one that they put on the box because that's one of the most recognizable games in it I still I still kind of want one of those arcade 1up machines I still feel like that might be a thing I end up getting myself for the holidays because I know one of our friends star soccer I got one of those Star Wars ones over the weekend or at least ordered it and I know they were talking in chat there might be other people interested in getting the Star Wars one so yeah those things those things look really cool so all right well at this point we are going to open up our discord for you guys to give us a call and say hello if you want to join in the conversation you can head on over to the green room on our discord server over at vog network calm or vog network calm slash discord that'll get you an invite right into the discord server if you are new to orange launch radio hey we would love to have you on the show but tell us a little bit about what you want to call in tonight in the orange lounge radio channel just so we know you're not troll okay we wouldn't know you have a legit question that's all it's always just making sure we're making sure none of that toxicity makes it here to our little program so our best we can I'm sure we can't avoid everything completely anyway let's get to it I see somebody just joined the green room and we haven't had a call in a while so let's get to it hi you are on orange launch radio who's this hey what's going on everyone it's wrong though hey Rama is great to hear from you what's on your mind tonight not much is great to hear you guys to see you guys every week well hello hello to what to what you want to talk about tonight all right so it was a couple things I want to talk about but I could save that for another time but anything I want to talk about in regards to Nintendo patching out Kristin Aussie's voice in Fire Emblem yeah what about that well I will say this I mean it's no secret that I've been part of the anime cosplay fandom for about 20 years and several of those years I've gotten friendly with various voice actors and the sad part is his actions it's sort of been like sort of not documented but well known it's like people around him knew this and the thing is it just takes something big for everybody to come out of the woodwork to point fingers at him for his actions now I do not condone what he did but I do respect him in the way that he is going to do his best to make amends I look at it this way um if you if you make mistakes it's up to you to own up and redeem yourself so others can see it you've become a better person yeah I think part of you know fixing mistakes though is kind of like accepting the punishment like you know you did the crime do the time sort of thing right so I mean I and I think this whole removal and and and shaming and so forth is kind of a part of that it's true and I said this may have killed his career but given how he made this long apology now it's not the first time I've seen something like this right now there's something big going on in a community with a million dollar lawsuit we'll just leave that that but if he's being sincere about his actions and you know what he's he should get a second chance if he's just saying it just to cover himself and save faith then you know what you're done right no I and I can I can be open to that you know if you know kind of accept the consequences which it sounds like you know I'm not following this guy probably as closely but if he is accepting the consequences and doing that and trying to be better from it then you know the whole idea of rehabilitation is the first place is to get better and do better so as long as the actions show that a person is doing better then I think there's room to forgive that I guess or you know except that a person can change absolutely it's just sad that it things like this come out this way it's like you make it big then somebody from your past reminds you of something shitty you've done and you never owned up to it it's sort of like the whole James Gunn thing with Guardians of the Galaxy that he's owned up to what he's done frequently and then it keeps coming back and he end up losing his job now he has his job back you know one I think a lot of that was about how he kind of played that out in the public eye too you know and that's why he's kind of back doing the film again so interesting it has is he a big and I'm sorry I might have missed this is he big in that like anime scene does he do voices there too is that how you kind of know a little more about this yeah one of the voices he's known for is he is Helios in Sailor Moon supers which is produced by this interesting okay didn't know that you might know him by his alternate name on YouTube kerboffer I don't watch enough YouTube stuff to know he's done various voices and then been in backgrounds and various like tracks and stuff like that so I swear I kind of know him so interesting all right well before I let you go anything else you want to talk about tonight if I'm looking at the couch correctly do I see a reference to the Golden Girls between Loki and Pikachu you do this is actually a calendar that Loki got for Christmas and if you've been watching if you've been paying attention on the stream we have updated it every month with the latest month that we're on so this is July's picture which is again for the sake of the podcast listeners I'm describing it a little bit it is Sophia cooking up a dish and Blanche is looking on at it and the quote says if this sauce were a person I'd get naked and make love to it and that was a Sophia quote there you go I watched every single episode of that show when it was on the air it's great I know a lot of like bros who watch Golden Girls it's it's it's funny for everybody yes yes cuz let's be real most was watched it for be Arthur anyway I always loved Betty White even at a young age so but yes of course of course be Arthur I mean they were all great in their own ways so it's interesting though how much merchandise and shit there is now with all that be Arthur I'm on my wine break yes one of my favorite try to bullshit one of my favorite be Arthur moments was from the Golden Girls and I just will never forget this one is that you know where I think it's Betty White says and where are you going and she goes to get ice cream or commit a felony I'm gonna decide in the car Blanche about homophobia oh yeah there's that yeah condoms rose condoms condoms condoms yeah it was amazing moment too I remember it Sicily Golden Girls are great on a future episode of olr we were just going to act out scenes from the Golden Girls so I don't know what part Loki's gonna play but we'll figure that out I think I think Loki kind of would be the Dorothy in this situation I really do I'm definitely the Blanche probably of this group I think our soccer would be Sophia you know what just go to SDCC and cosplay as the Golden Girls and I'll stand behind you with a boom box playing to sound playing at the theme song you would dark soccer you would definitely the one be the one that would be like picture it Namco arcade mobile 1996 and then not give a shit yes I'd say the dry things absolutely all right anyway all right I'm gonna let you go Rama so we can squeeze in another call but they walk out with my with my Walker good to hear it was always my friend right back at you all right bye all right let's get to another call here on the show hello you're on orange launch radio who's this hello no hello hey this is that deaf sorry I had my mute on that's okay sometimes I know we surprise you when we drag and drop you on air what's on your mind tonight well I want to talk about something that happened Mexico this week involving eSports a little back of a little backstory there's this Federation eSports Federation in Mexico that was initiated back in February if I remember correctly so it's like okay a big deal so we can have like national teams support for for the eSports community here in Mexico all good fast forward to this week they're starting their their tournaments they're starting out to scout for national team members and they start charging the around 600 pesos which is around I think let me get my calculations almost correctly like $30 which isn't much but right the thing is they are affiliated with the National Sports Committee in Mexico so they are a civil association they cannot profit of any tournament or anything an event they they're doing so it's like a really really bad situation for them and in in especially because one of the tournaments they were they are holding is for clash of clans or one one of the mobile games and supercell the developer came out on Twitter and told them hey hey guys you cannot charge any any amount of money for any of the participants so it yeah it was a really really big deal this week in Mexico because of that and and actually one of the under of the people one of the heads of famous which was just called came out and said that yeah they didn't like expected this to happen because they do need the money they they do have to pay for the train training for the for the participants if they get selected they have to pay the trips they have to pay everything involved for for the making of these tournaments so it's understandable but they should have like came out of upfront about it it's like the many people here and including myself we're kind of disappointed on that and how they handle it because it's like really really like shady stuff be all behind all I have talked about already where they try to make I was just saying were they trying to make a claim about where the money was going at the start when they actually announced the tournaments and all that stuff they just they just said you have to be affiliated with them with famous and you have to pay the 600 pesos they didn't say why they didn't say like oh we need this to pay for for all the events and in all that all the other stuff that is needed which is understandable but again they weren't clear about it and it was like until like a few days ago I think Friday that an article popped out in an interview they they made what up with a website here in Mexico that actually like explain all that but again it's like way too late and many people are like actually mad legit mad about it so it's understand again it's understandable why they did it but they should have like been clear about it from the beginning yeah especially when like the developers are probably sitting here thinking these folks that are completely unaffiliated with us are making money off of our games using our games in the promotion using our games to attract people and then they're charging this fee for them and even if the fee is you know pretty nominal you know three bucks is not a whole lot of money it's cheaper than a grande at Starbucks and all is said and done but it's it's the principle yeah actually $30 I think but again not not that big of a deal with with the money involved but it's the thing that yeah even they got in trouble kind of in trouble with supercell which is again the developer they came out and you cannot charge these official rules for any official tournament it's like you cannot charge any participant at all even like even if there's like an an entry fee for the venue you cannot charge them that yeah it's a free entry for any participant and they're also involved with overwatch not necessarily League but the World Cup and also other games like the League of Legends and others other games that are going like they have a World Cup basically huh interesting well I'll be curious to kind of see if there's more that develops on this if more companies kind of come out against it or if you know these guys kind of reverse course on that or give a little more clarity to where these this money is why they're collecting it where it's going or if they suddenly make a big charitable donation or I'll be curious to kind of see where this ends up yeah me too actually because again it I actually want to for them to like do do good do better actually yeah because they're trying to get like games officially recognized by the the International Olympics Committee they're working really hard on it and but like this this kind of stuff is like kind of disappointing if anything for sure for sure all right my friend I'm gonna let you go so we wrap up the show but thank you thank you for the news from a place we are you know an area where we aren't always paying attention all the time so it's nice to hear from news from around the world hey thanks for having me good like always no problem take care my friend yeah all right well there you go that that's gonna do it I think for the call tonight which means we are about oops I almost closed OBS I'm going to close discord we are about to the end of another episode of orange lounge radio not bad for a week of news that was a little bit slower although I should check in make sure we're low-key there's no last-minute stories there's just one last thing I was gonna mention so the Epic Games Store put out some new free games for the month and one of those was a game called moon lighter which apparently someone spotted that there was the enable cloud save function and which they'd come in that on Twitter and Tim Sweeney responded with we've actually enabled cloud saves for a couple of games right now but they'll be rolling out more so it's another enhancement that they're finally adding to their storefront that they really should have tried it for a while yeah something to try to kind of maybe justify a lot more of those exclusives they're snapping up when people don't really want to use their store so interesting interesting we'll see what develops of that all right well we are gonna wrap up for the night I'm gonna say as I always do thank you for tuning in and spending your night with us here at orange launch radio we appreciate all of the support if you like what you heard here at orange launch radio please tell a friend or two about the show help us spread the word because we are the word where every we are the show where every gamer has a voice but if the voices aren't here to air then what are we gonna do so please tell a friend or two about the show and you know a nice five-star review on a place like iTunes goes an awful long way also you can do these auto hosts of vog network over on your twitch channel and whether you have a hundred followers or one follower that stuff goes a long way towards discoverability so please consider putting us on your auto host list that would be fantastic otherwise I think I think that's all I've got to say and I think we're ready to go around and get everybody's final thoughts we will be back in seven days to do this all over again Bobby black wolf who airs live before us at a voice keys Network will not be live next week he is off to a convention called Gen Con which is very big on the board games I know so I'm hoping he will get some video even if it's board games I'm sure he'll bring back some video and I would think somewhere in that building there's some video game representation so he'll probably get a little bit of that so yeah there's gonna be that and yeah we look forward to seeing you guys next week we will still be here on orange lounge radio at that time so dark soccer do you want to start us off tonight her with the orange hair do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight um don't want to be a downer but stop shooting people you twats oh yeah that thing you just sent me during the show there's an active shooter right now at the Gilroy garlic festival and that you know for Northern California that's a huge event and so like and the first question I asked was you know our bling-blank wasn't there were they yeah so she was there yesterday I almost went there this weekend but it's a hundred some degrees outside and it's also like an hour yeah still still just you know at any rate at any rate we need more than your thoughts and prayers keep them to yourself but also though in more positive things just like don't be don't don't be a douche just don't be an asshole if you are thinking crazy asshole things see a therapist that's a lot better than killing people go go see a therapist and maybe take it in the ass just say thanks my final thought tonight is going to say because I forgot to mention this during my gaming week but I was meeting up with some ingress buddies to kind of keep an eye on what was going on in the myriad anomaly series so I just want to congratulate the enlightened on winning the myriad anomaly series this weekend so that's my final thought congrats to all that well-thought resistance polite clapping wink all right Loki your final
