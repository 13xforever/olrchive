Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
These are hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:27.000
This week in the lull of the holidays, a few longer form articles are able to bubble up to the top of the collected news chamber. Take a breath and enjoy the brisk pace of tonight's stories. The news that we could find starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:48.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 783 for this July the 7th of 2019. There's a reason I don't tell you, DarkSakura, about those parodies.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
You are absolutely terrible.

00:52.000 --> 00:59.000
Hi, I'm Rob Roberts and joining me in the studio is the one and only DarkSakura, Jamie Summers, off cam because she wants to be.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
I think I just lost my shit.

01:01.000 --> 01:17.000
I just had a moment, a brainstorm. So for those who don't get it, if you're listening on the podcast, when we do the thing on Twitch, and I think I've mentioned this before, we kind of like borrowed an idea from You Can't Do That on Television that they also do on Dragon Con TV where they do these parody intros.

01:17.000 --> 01:27.000
So it's like so and so will not be seen tonight. And so what we did is we did, and I don't know why I thought of it, but I was just because I was actually trying to think of Fourth of July related things like America related games.

01:27.000 --> 01:34.000
But for some reason, Neopets came to my mind is like a good old American game and I was like, Neopets Cemetery.

01:34.000 --> 01:41.000
So there you go. There it is. And then voiceover Jason guy said that was the best one yet out of the how many weeks have we been on Twitch about a half year now.

01:42.000 --> 01:55.000
That was the best one yet. So I don't know. Do you guys agree? Tell us in the chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network because we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network.

01:55.000 --> 02:03.000
More info at vognetwork.com. Again, I'm Rob Roberts. She's Dark Soccer or Jamie Summers. And he over right there is Techmaster Loki.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Yes, I am.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
How are you?

02:05.000 --> 02:06.000
I'm fine.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.000
Good. And I noticed tonight and the folks on Twitch can maybe see this behind your laptop. You're wearing a Keanu Reeves shirt.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.000
I am wearing a Keanu Reeves shirt.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Is that inspired by cyberpunk?

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
It is a cyberpunk thing.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Interesting.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
It says we have a city to burn.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Boy, they were quick on getting that merch out, weren't they?

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
Wrong. Someone was quick to knock that shit off.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
Oh, it's a Redbubble type thing?

02:23.000 --> 02:30.000
It's from QWERTY. I buy a lot of shirts from them. Not sponsored. I wish I was because then shirts would be cheaper.

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
No, it's from QWERTY and I love it. It's awesome.

02:35.000 --> 02:40.000
It's great. Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, such a breathtaking shirt.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
It is. It really is.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
It is breathtaking, yes. Your wardrobe is very breathtaking.

02:44.000 --> 02:51.000
So we have a random question at Starsoft tonight. Why not? I mean, we have gaming news to talk about. Don't get me wrong.

02:51.000 --> 02:57.000
We're going to have a fun show tonight, but it's been a little slower because 4th of July, Canada Day, all in the same week.

02:57.000 --> 03:05.000
North American studios probably aren't as busy. We're still kind of basking in all the info we got at E3.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
So it slowed down a little bit this week. So I'm all for a random question.

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
So the question we get from Questbuster, random question for pinball lovers at OLR.

03:13.000 --> 03:19.000
If you had a chance to visit the Pinball Hall of Fame in Vegas, is there a special machine there you would want to play?

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
I went there. I talked about it in a previous show.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.000
I've been there.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
Yeah. But what do you want to go back and play?

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
It's my tradition. The first machine I'm always going to play at a show like that is Elvira.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
Either table. Scared Stiff or I think just the Mistress of the Dark is the other one.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.000
Even though I didn't have the most fun time playing it, I still want to play the pinball circus.

03:38.000 --> 03:43.000
But another one I would love is if they had actually a bride of pinball 2.0.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
No, have you played bride of pinball 2.0?

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
No, because that was not the one at your house, right?

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
We had a bride of pinball for a while.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Yeah, she had a bride of pinball.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
We borrowed a 2.0.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Okay, I think I might have played it. I think I might have played it when you had it.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
Because it's the one that had like, it sounded like the Space Mountain, the old Space Mountain soundtrack.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Yes.

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
And it had like voices in different modes and it was all LED and had a new DMD and everything.

04:02.000 --> 04:09.000
It was really fun, but I mean, of course there's other classics, although I did get one of my favorites.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
I own it now, finally. Black Rose.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
Oh, nice.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
Dan has been putting his heart into it.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Oh, that's great.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Yeah, I'll do more on that for my game.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
But you still have your World Cup Soccer 94, right?

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
That's the one he's like never allowed to get rid of, right?

04:21.000 --> 04:24.000
Well, yeah, although I was planning on selling it to Melody.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
If I was going to sell it to anyone, it would be to Melody.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
Right, because then you'd at least know it's a good home.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Because then I could get it back.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
Yeah, and you kind of know where it is.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.000
And the same thing goes for my Theater of Magic.

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
If anyone's going to buy theater, if I'm selling it to anybody, it'll be Melody.

04:38.000 --> 04:43.000
I do think when Alan and I work out some of our financial stuff and we're able to get a house,

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
I do think I want a Baby Pac-Man machine and I want an Elvira machine.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
Because I know Alan would be on board for an Elvira machine because he loves Elvira.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
We could probably lend you some of ours, too.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
That would be awesome.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
How about you?

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
When's your house?

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Well, I was going to say, when's your house turning into an arcade?

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
But you're starting.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
You've got the DDR machine.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
I don't have enough room for anything.

05:01.000 --> 05:06.000
I couldn't put anything in there other than the DDR and the candy cap.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
But now we're getting to that point of the year where I doubt you're going to be in there playing DDR very often

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
because it's getting really hard, right?

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Well, I don't know.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.000
Maybe.

05:15.000 --> 05:20.000
I got stuff to start running now, so I'm going to start running in 100 degree weather.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Yeesh.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
I know it sounds as terrible as I think it's going to be, but I'm going to do it anyway.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
If you go out at like seven or eight, it's really not that bad.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
No, this is going to be like one or two.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Oh, then you're crazy.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Funny you mentioned that.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.000
I'm actually considering doing couch to 5K.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.000
So I was going to do that maybe.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
And then I just need more workout stuff anyway, so it was fine.

05:43.000 --> 05:49.000
I go out ever since Harry Potter Woo, Wizard Unite Woo, ever since Harry Potter Woo came out,

05:49.000 --> 05:54.000
I've been kind of going down to this park not far from me, and Alan will come with, too.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.000
We finally got him suckered into Harry Potter, so he's playing that, too.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
We'll walk around the park.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
The temperature is really nice at seven, eight o'clock.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
It's just a little walk and a little exercise.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.000
Yeah, we'll see.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
I don't know.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
I can always play later.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
So, pinball tables.

06:09.000 --> 06:20.000
I didn't really play a lot of pinball, so I would say probably Abs Family and probably Attack on Mars, I think.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
I remember when that was new.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
That technology and that machine was really awesome.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.000
You're talking about the remake, not the original.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Yeah, the remake.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
Yeah, the remake where you actually have the hologram.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
What did they call it? Pinball 2000 or something?

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
Yeah.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
Where you had the little holographic images in there.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
It was pretty cool.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Yeah, I'd probably do that.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
Awesome.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.000
All right, well, let's get into our official kickoff tonight.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
But if you have further questions, why not?

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
You can always jump into twitch.tv slash vognetwork or vognetwork and ask away.

06:47.000 --> 06:52.000
I'd be happy to answer questions as long as they're not too crazy.

06:52.000 --> 06:57.000
But I thought for our kickoff tonight, again, the news has been a little bit slower, so I don't have this gigantic headline.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
But I thought we could kind of reminisce a little bit about controllers

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
and specifically talking about an article that's been going around online about Nintendo

07:04.000 --> 07:09.000
and some of the comments they made about controllers at the 79th annual general meeting of shareholders.

07:09.000 --> 07:13.000
And the question that was posed, it was question number 13 during this whole thing,

07:13.000 --> 07:19.000
said, looking at this year's E3, it seems like the mainstream for video games is the same as it has been for the past 30 years,

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
namely looking at the screen and playing with controller in hand.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
How do developers regard this and do they think it will continue?

07:26.000 --> 07:30.000
And there's several answers in here. I want to read a couple of them here.

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
Takahashi said, we are always dreaming of new things.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
For example, 1-2 Switch, the first game released for Switch.

07:36.000 --> 07:41.000
We suggested that people could play not by looking at each other or by looking at each other and not at the screen.

07:41.000 --> 07:46.000
And for VR, we thought about how we could change not just the controller but also the gameplay

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
and came up with the Nintendo Labo Toy-Con 04 VR kit.

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
He then talks a little bit more about E3.

07:52.000 --> 07:58.000
Miyamoto says, Nintendo was the first to create the style of playing video games with a plus-shaped directional pad

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
and additional buttons, which has now become the industry standard.

08:01.000 --> 08:06.000
True point. It was also Nintendo that changed the original plus-shaped directional pad,

08:06.000 --> 08:14.000
which operated digitally in eight directions, into the first analog input device that moves freely in all directions for Nintendo 64.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
This, too, is now common.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.000
But I feel like PlayStation was kind of doing that. No, because the DualShock was later, wasn't it?

08:20.000 --> 08:25.000
So they didn't have the analogs right away. Okay, then never mind. They get to claim that, too.

08:25.000 --> 08:30.000
We are proud to have created a variety of user interfaces that have now become industry standards.

08:30.000 --> 08:36.000
And as of now, in terms of accuracy and reliability, I believe this style is the clear winner.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
Here's where the answer gets more interesting.

08:38.000 --> 08:45.000
At the same time, I also believe we should quickly graduate from the current controller and we are attempting all kinds of things.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.000
Our objective is to achieve an interface that surpasses the current controller,

08:49.000 --> 08:54.000
where what the player does is directly reflected on the screen and the user can clearly feel the result.

08:54.000 --> 08:59.000
This has not been achieved yet. We've tried all kinds of motion controllers, but none seem to work for people.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.000
I don't know if I agree with him saying none worked for people, because the Wii was huge.

09:03.000 --> 09:08.000
And a lot of that was because of the motion control, even though, sure, it wasn't super accurate in the beginning.

09:08.000 --> 09:13.000
They ended up having to do the Wii Motion Plus. I still feel like that changed gaming in many ways.

09:13.000 --> 09:20.000
It did, but it's also, you have to use it in a meaningful way, just like how he was talking about 1-2 Switch and stuff like that.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
Arguably, 1-2 Switch is not a good game.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
It's a mini-game collection.

09:25.000 --> 09:36.000
It's a neat, like, this should have been packed in with the game system, but I don't think it's anything that I would be heralding.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
I mean, the VR stuff is kind of alright.

09:40.000 --> 09:47.000
They definitely have, any of the Labo stuff, they've had unique ways that they've used the Joy-Cons, so props there.

09:47.000 --> 09:54.000
But a lot of that, though, you're not going to really see that being used outside of just that piece of software.

09:55.000 --> 10:01.000
So I think that's kind of the problem. Like, you have all these cool features that you built in, but really everybody's kind of using it in one way.

10:01.000 --> 10:08.000
And then he continues to say, and as the company that knows the most about controllers, we've been striving to create a controller that can be used with ease,

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
and that will become the standard for the next generation.

10:11.000 --> 10:19.000
So I kind of, like, ask you guys, do you think that we're going to be stuck in this directional pad, analog button type of controller for forever?

10:19.000 --> 10:23.000
Or do you think that game controllers and the way we play our games could change in the future?

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
While you stew on that, let me get some other comments here.

10:25.000 --> 10:31.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, we rejected motion controls and Kinect controls.

10:31.000 --> 10:41.000
I sort of get where that comment comes from, especially when it comes to Kinect, where Kinect was huge and then died off once everybody got sick of dance games and exercise games, right?

10:41.000 --> 10:47.000
They couldn't figure out really, I mean, even though they tried these other wild things like the Kinect Disneyland and stuff like that, nothing ever really took.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
In the game sense, we all know Kinect works.

10:50.000 --> 10:59.000
It wasn't good enough yet for any of that. It's like the idea was a good idea, but the execution of it wasn't to where they wanted it to be,

10:59.000 --> 11:05.000
and where it just didn't work as if they, you know, for some things like the dancing games and stuff, that was okay.

11:05.000 --> 11:11.000
But it's very limited on what you could do with it, because space-wise, you need to have a certain amount of space.

11:11.000 --> 11:17.000
The sensitivity on it wasn't that great. It was just kind of wonky.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
But I wouldn't say that motion controls are dead, because, I mean, look at VR.

11:21.000 --> 11:30.000
VR, you typically just use motion controllers, and those are probably better than a lot of the motion controllers that we're talking about here.

11:30.000 --> 11:38.000
So I think it could progress in that sense, but I think it would be more useful in scenarios that involve VR.

11:38.000 --> 11:43.000
Right, and I was going to say, I think motion controls specifically, like, okay, maybe they're not the king anymore,

11:43.000 --> 11:48.000
especially since the Wii has kind of sunset, and even though the Switch does have some motion elements in it,

11:48.000 --> 11:56.000
I think they end up kind of being the little sideshow to the main games that people just want to sit on their couch and kind of play, right?

11:56.000 --> 12:02.000
But when it comes to things like VR, I think motion control still is very much like a thing.

12:02.000 --> 12:10.000
It might not be the top thing, but a game like Beat Saber, you know, Beat Saber works because of its unique control mechanism.

12:10.000 --> 12:16.000
And admittedly, it's kind of an anomaly. It's not the norm, but it's a hell of an anomaly, right?

12:16.000 --> 12:22.000
And I think there are still other games to kind of find in that space, especially as VR is kind of finding itself,

12:22.000 --> 12:29.000
and that killer must-have game and app that makes everybody want to jump into VR,

12:29.000 --> 12:34.000
just like the Wii Tennis was probably arguably that thing that really brought people into wanting to play that.

12:35.000 --> 12:42.000
So you think motion controls are probably not necessarily the future completely?

12:42.000 --> 12:47.000
No, I don't think they're the future. I think that they're not dead.

12:47.000 --> 12:52.000
I think that that's going to be probably something that we go towards,

12:52.000 --> 12:58.000
but what we have now is more sophisticated than they were doing.

12:58.000 --> 13:02.000
Even PlayStation Move is very kind of bare bones,

13:02.000 --> 13:07.000
and I'm surprised that we're still using that now. It's so old at this point.

13:07.000 --> 13:11.000
It works pretty well, though. For Beat Saber and stuff, it's good enough.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
It's okay for what it is, but it could be so much better.

13:14.000 --> 13:18.000
But some of those controllers for the VR stuff, like the Oculus controller,

13:18.000 --> 13:24.000
or no, the Vive one with those little spaceships on the hand, those are pretty cool.

13:24.000 --> 13:31.000
And they feel really... I love the haptic feedback is probably my favorite thing that controllers do in this day and age, that type of stuff.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
So it's interesting to see where that goes from there.

13:33.000 --> 13:40.000
But looking back on some of the controllers over the generations we've had of gaming,

13:40.000 --> 13:44.000
what was the one you wish we were still playing games on?

13:44.000 --> 13:49.000
Unless you feel that the Xbox One controller or PlayStation 4 is as good as it gets or Switch,

13:49.000 --> 13:52.000
what's the one controller you wish we were still playing our games on?

13:52.000 --> 13:57.000
And Dark Soccer, you're the classic gaming connoisseur of this show, so I'll start with you.

13:57.000 --> 14:01.000
The Sega analog controller, the camera for the Saturn. Best controller ever.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
Just saying. Best controller ever.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
Why?

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
Because it's comfortable. Fuck.

14:07.000 --> 14:11.000
I mean, seriously, it sat in my hands so comfortably because I could hold...

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
Hold on, I'm going to have to use my phone. Let me show you.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.000
Okay, so she's taking out her phone and kind of... Oh, okay.

14:17.000 --> 14:22.000
So she's showing on the Twitch cam how she can kind of like hold it in the back of her hands and use her thumbs.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Yeah, I got it.

14:23.000 --> 14:27.000
Exactly. So, because it had those kind of grippy things in the back, not quite like...

14:27.000 --> 14:32.000
And the Dreamcast had a very similar controller to it. It was based off of the analog controller.

14:32.000 --> 14:40.000
And, I mean, honestly, I also really liked the NEGICON.

14:40.000 --> 14:46.000
Because the twist controllers made it really good for racing games and it just felt really natural.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
I also imagine, ergonomically, you could do some pretty cool things to that too.

14:49.000 --> 14:55.000
Exactly. I mean, those are two among them. Of course, I mean, even though they were specialized, I wish there had been more games that supported the twin stakes.

14:55.000 --> 15:05.000
I'm just going to say the gun cons because I'm in some serious need of some more point blank.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.000
So, yeah, the gun cons.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.000
Get you a CRT.

15:10.000 --> 15:16.000
They have new guns that work with LCD panels, but...

15:17.000 --> 15:22.000
All of my gun cons. What was the Sega one? Not for the Master System, but the...

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
The Menacer?

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
The Menacer. Yeah, not the Menacer. It was like another one.

15:26.000 --> 15:32.000
But anyway, we've got so many gun controllers at my house that we pretty much have to keep our CRT.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.000
I love it.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.000
We got a Wega for 20 bucks.

15:36.000 --> 15:41.000
You kind of referenced it, but I would honestly say the Dreamcast controller was really one of my all-time favorites.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.000
Yes, it was the Justifier.

15:42.000 --> 15:50.000
And what made the Dreamcast controller amazing, not just the fact that it felt rock solid with its D-pad and all the things,

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
but the fact that that VMU kind of sat in there.

15:53.000 --> 15:58.000
And for those that maybe weren't around during the Dreamcast days, of course, the VMU was like this...

15:58.000 --> 16:03.000
It was kind of like the technology you would see in an old-ass Tamagotchi, like a very bare-bones kind of screen.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.000
But you would put it in there and it would kind of interface with your game.

16:06.000 --> 16:10.000
That technology was just ahead of its time. It was just ahead of its time. It was so cool.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
The VMUs, you could connect to each other.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
Yeah.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
For little versus tiny games or trading, like for Chao trading?

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
Yeah.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
In Sonic Adventure?

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
Mm-hmm.

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
It was. And then Sony had to rip it off with the PocketStation.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
But not in America. That PocketStation never came out here, so...

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
I don't know where mine is, and I'm very sad.

16:29.000 --> 16:32.000
A number of American games did support PocketStation.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
Yeah, Final Fantasy 7 or 8 was one of them.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Yep.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
Yeah.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
8.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
It was 8.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Yeah, and those things were cool.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
And you know what's interesting? I kind of always go...

16:40.000 --> 16:46.000
I love the idea of a video screen on your controller.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
Maybe not. I know that kind of conjures the image of the Wii U.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
Maybe not on that level.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
It's funny that you say that, because I think that's what the Amico has.

16:53.000 --> 16:58.000
Well, I was going to say that, is that actually that's one of the things I find fascinating about the Amico,

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
especially considering its low cost, like how it's going to do that.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
I'm really wanting to see how that looks in motion.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
Well, LCD panels are really cheap.

17:06.000 --> 17:11.000
I guess that's true. In this day, it used to be those things would be the most expensive part,

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
but now, even just a few years ago, back when the Wii U first came out,

17:14.000 --> 17:17.000
the cost of those controllers, they didn't sell them separately,

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
because the entire cost of the system was in that controller.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.000
You know what I mean?

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
Yeah.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.000
I think we have two Steel Battalion controllers now.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
Well, that's a whole other thing.

17:27.000 --> 17:32.000
We're talking about it in chat, about how SH-100 Matt said we need more Steel Battalion games

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
as an excuse to play those into its controller.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
They had a second Steel Battalion game. It was not good.

17:37.000 --> 17:43.000
But could you imagine, what was that mech game that we used to play at Dave & Buster's?

17:43.000 --> 17:47.000
It was like a Robotech game, wasn't it? Or BattleTech.

17:47.000 --> 17:52.000
Could you imagine them doing a BattleTech game in that series and using that controller?

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
Yeah. The virtual world pods or whatever.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000
Yeah.

17:56.000 --> 18:00.000
And it's funny, because Bobby says, look at your stream deck that you're using, and that's right.

18:00.000 --> 18:04.000
I'd use one of those little stream decks that has all the little buttons on it,

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
and it's great for doing the broadcasting. You're right. It's a little LED thing.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
But, I mean, this guy was like $99.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.000
But, of course, I bought it when it was a new thing.

18:13.000 --> 18:17.000
These are probably already coming down in price, because now I'm seeing the ads for the stream deck XL.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.000
Yeah, it's ridiculously huge. I've seen that.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
This is plenty enough for what we're doing here.

18:22.000 --> 18:28.000
If you're going to do that, like the XL, just buy another keyboard to dedicate directly to hotkeys.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
I mean, seriously.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
Yeah. I know. I know. This is really cool, though.

18:32.000 --> 18:37.000
The thing about the stream deck is that I can also see exactly how many people are on Twitch right now

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
without having to go look at another window.

18:39.000 --> 18:43.000
That's the stuff I like, is the information that delivers right to the screen.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
I can see at a glance if the mics are on or off.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
Doesn't mean I always get it right, because I don't always remember to look.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
But, for the most part, I can see really at a glance.

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
That's some of the stuff I like. Information in front of my face.

18:55.000 --> 19:00.000
To tie it back to the controllers, I think that's why I always liked the VMUs

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
and that concept of a little mini screen on your controller,

19:02.000 --> 19:06.000
is information right in front of your face that maybe is not necessarily something

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
that would then get in the way of the interface in the game or what have you.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
I'm really curious to see what the Amico does with that whole thing.

19:12.000 --> 19:18.000
I think AR stuff is going to really push what we do with controllers at some point,

19:18.000 --> 19:20.000
once that becomes more mainstream.

19:21.000 --> 19:26.000
That's true. Things like HoloLens. The HoloLens isn't a gaming thing.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
No, it's just stuff like it.

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
It's a matter of time before the price to do something like that.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
It's price and performance.

19:34.000 --> 19:38.000
As that stuff gets smaller and more powerful, it's just going to be eventually rebuilt.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.000
Somebody's going to want to try to make it a gaming thing.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
Even if maybe it's not in the cards right now.

19:42.000 --> 19:47.000
Somebody's going to want to try to make a Google Glass or HoloLens type thing a gaming thing.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
We'll see.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
Imagine if you could play Pokemon Go and you put these little glasses on.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
You actually see the Pokemon.

19:55.000 --> 19:59.000
Obviously, that desire is there because you're using your phone.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
You don't have it up here.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
You're just using your phone as that type of thing right now.

20:03.000 --> 20:07.000
I feel like that's where some games want to go with all that.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
Any other comments on controllers or the future?

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
All that?

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
We invite your emails on the subject as well.

20:15.000 --> 20:18.000
Participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.000
For now, we'll go into a segment that we do every week here on the show.

20:21.000 --> 20:25.000
Where we talk a little bit about the types of video games that we have been playing this week.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
In a segment called, How Was Your Gaming Week?

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
Black Rose. Dan has finally got it working.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
I play tested it a little bit.

20:34.000 --> 20:39.000
We also finally got all of the shards in Bloodstained.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Got the ending.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
I'm very sad about one of my favorite characters in it.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
Who I won't say what happens to him since people are still playing it.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
Although, I will say this.

20:50.000 --> 20:55.000
If you check out all the books and finally get the final book, you have to fight O.D.

20:55.000 --> 20:59.000
He's like, I told you to bring back my books, bitch.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.000
This is a library, not a bookstore.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.000
And of course, the voice actor was Alucard.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
Alucard's voice actor in the U.S. also found out.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
Japanese voice actor. It was him too.

21:11.000 --> 21:19.000
If you beat O.D. and it is a bitch of a fight, go back and look at him in his bookstore.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.000
He is pissed.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
It's just worth it. Absolutely worth it.

21:24.000 --> 21:27.000
I'm doing Animal Crossing.

21:27.000 --> 21:31.000
I'm thinking about quitting idle pouring when my subscription is up.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.000
Just because I haven't really gotten anywhere.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
But now I'm kind of spiteful.

21:37.000 --> 21:41.000
And want to see if I can beat the level 500 map boss.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.000
So, we'll see.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.000
Alright. Very nice.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

21:47.000 --> 21:51.000
I didn't play a whole ton this week. I did play a little bit of Pokemon Go.

21:51.000 --> 21:59.000
And then also, I went back to, I want to say Hotline Miami.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
It was Shakedown Miami.

22:01.000 --> 22:04.000
And played a little bit of that.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.000
That's about it.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.000
Alright. No DDR? No arcade this week?

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
No DDR this week. It's been really hot.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
I'm going to ask you about this. Because you were talking to me about this before the show.

22:15.000 --> 22:20.000
And I think a lot of our long time listeners know that you have always historically been a huge fan of laser tag.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.000
Yes.

22:21.000 --> 22:28.000
And you were, as my people would say, that bitch when it came to Qsar back in the day.

22:28.000 --> 22:30.000
You were the guy to beat at Qsar back in the day, right?

22:30.000 --> 22:31.000
Yes.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.000
Qsars have been kind of famous. But you still follow laser tag.

22:34.000 --> 22:41.000
I still try to find the new drug that's going to give me that same high as Qsar did.

22:41.000 --> 22:45.000
So you found, because Qsars are like, there's one in Concord.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
Yeah, there's a whole bunch of laser systems out there.

22:47.000 --> 22:53.000
So, I've been just bouncing around the different ones with my kids just to see what is out there.

22:53.000 --> 22:57.000
We've gone and played Laser Knights. That's the one that's at the Roseville Golf Land.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
Which is kind of crappy. It's whatever.

23:00.000 --> 23:04.000
You were mentioning there was one probably like two miles from OLR headquarters that you just tried out.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
So, what was the pros and cons of this laser place you went to today?

23:07.000 --> 23:17.000
So, the cons of it were that the arcade sucks. It's just, there's nothing there.

23:17.000 --> 23:22.000
It's a few ticket redemption games. They have a couple arcade games.

23:22.000 --> 23:29.000
And it's just kind of, it's very empty. Like the whole building's just very empty when it comes to arcades.

23:29.000 --> 23:33.000
They have bumper cars though, which is kind of weird. And a laser maze.

23:33.000 --> 23:37.000
But that's not why you go there. You go there to play Laser Tag.

23:37.000 --> 23:41.000
And their laser tag arena is two stories, which is awesome.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
And they have these...

23:44.000 --> 23:47.000
There used to be that one in Eldorado Hills that was two stories.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
Yeah, it's...

23:48.000 --> 23:49.000
I feel like you and I went there once.

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
I went there once and played there.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.000
I don't think they're there anymore.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
They're closed.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
This one is, it's more robust as far as like a second story.

23:58.000 --> 24:02.000
That one, it was just like, oh, there's a few sections you can go up a little higher and then that's it.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
This is actually legit two stories, which is pretty cool.

24:05.000 --> 24:10.000
The differences obviously with that and QZAR is there's, you know, you don't run out of lives.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.000
You just have unlimited lives. Most of the places have that.

24:13.000 --> 24:18.000
They have like these like panels that you can shoot. They're like power-ups, which are kind of cool.

24:18.000 --> 24:23.000
And then apparently if you like have a membership with this thing, you can also scan like a card or something like that

24:23.000 --> 24:27.000
and track your progress and unlock weapons and stuff, which is pretty cool.

24:27.000 --> 24:35.000
But it's different than playing QZAR because obviously QZAR, it's its own type of game with its own rules.

24:35.000 --> 24:42.000
But using the stuff that I've learned from playing laser tag for a very long time, I kick so much ass anyways.

24:42.000 --> 24:47.000
So it was just like, I'm very fast at the drawing.

24:47.000 --> 24:53.000
I also know how to position myself behind walls in a way that I can't get hit very easily.

24:53.000 --> 24:58.000
But it was fun. We had fun with my kids and went there and got lots of exercise doing it.

24:58.000 --> 25:03.000
And I would totally be down for it again. It's more expensive than QZAR used to be.

25:03.000 --> 25:09.000
Granted, I played QZAR like a decade ago, so it's understandable the prices have gone up.

25:09.000 --> 25:15.000
But it is very close and it wasn't very busy. So I'm definitely down playing some more of that.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
I have to check this place out. I haven't played laser tag in a while.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
Last time I played laser tag was probably with you going to Vacaville or something.

25:19.000 --> 25:26.000
Yeah, and I still get the urge every once in a while because my coworker, she has family in Vacaville

25:26.000 --> 25:29.000
and she keeps talking about how she goes to Starz and stuff like that.

25:29.000 --> 25:35.000
I want to go back there to play laser tag, but I know it's so probably run down at that point.

25:35.000 --> 25:42.000
And you can't just show up there. No one wants to play that stuff, even there.

25:42.000 --> 25:46.000
But this place is like a dedicated laser tag arena, so it's alright.

25:46.000 --> 25:52.000
It's weird, though, the way they do it, too, because they can actually stagger games at the same time.

25:52.000 --> 25:58.000
So when we first went into our first game, there was a team deathmatch going on,

25:58.000 --> 26:04.000
but we were playing free-for-all. Us separately were playing free-for-all within this team deathmatch.

26:04.000 --> 26:09.000
And then as we were leaving our last game, there was a team deathmatch coming in,

26:09.000 --> 26:14.000
but they were playing free-for-all or something like that, and then we were doing our own team deathmatch.

26:14.000 --> 26:19.000
And so it's just really weird, because I kept asking them, do you guys want to go in right now?

26:19.000 --> 26:23.000
I'm like, yeah, but isn't there a game already going? They're like, oh, that's fine.

26:23.000 --> 26:27.000
We're tracking your time separately. I'm like, how the hell does that work?

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
But it worked, so I was like, okay, cool.

26:30.000 --> 26:38.000
Interesting. Alright. Some people reminiscing about laser tag stuff in the chat over at twitch.tv

26:38.000 --> 26:44.000
slash vog network, Bobby Blackwolf bragging, I was a Qsar top gun many times in my high school and college years.

26:44.000 --> 26:48.000
Let's see, Act F says, we used to have a laser tag place here, but it closed down.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.000
Yeah, I think a lot of them have closed down.

26:49.000 --> 26:55.000
Yeah, our closest Qsar is probably the one that's probably most up to date and actually maintained is in Concord,

26:55.000 --> 27:01.000
which is a good hour and a half away thing. We have one that's a little bit closer in Vacaville,

27:01.000 --> 27:07.000
but that's like really, it's kind of run down from the last time I was there, and that was years ago.

27:07.000 --> 27:13.000
And I can only imagine the problem with it is because it is an older system, like from like the early 2000s,

27:13.000 --> 27:19.000
and they don't really make parts for it anymore. It's very antiquated.

27:19.000 --> 27:24.000
It's such an old ass system and they have newer Qsar stuff like the newer systems,

27:24.000 --> 27:30.000
but I don't think any facility around here has it. But I'll tell you what, if I ever came into a ton of fucking money,

27:30.000 --> 27:36.000
I'm bringing that fucking shit back because I'm a loyalist when it comes to that stuff.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
So that's what you would do if you won the lottery?

27:38.000 --> 27:45.000
Oh hell yeah, I would open up a family fun center with Qsar. Hell yeah.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.000
Alright.

27:46.000 --> 27:56.000
You know, I think though, like if you're going to have like a Qsar though, you should have like the most elite Japanese style arcade.

27:56.000 --> 28:01.000
Yes, I think so. But I think that this, I don't know how long this place has been open.

28:01.000 --> 28:09.000
I think that they're just kind of, because they have a ton of room to expand, but there's just not a lot in there as far as arcade games goes right now.

28:09.000 --> 28:15.000
And like I get it, redemption's where it's at, but like their redemption prizes are kind of garbage.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
So it's, I don't know.

28:17.000 --> 28:22.000
And also there, I was mentioning this to my wife today.

28:22.000 --> 28:33.000
So I think all their games run on quarters and you know how there's like, hey, you buy $20, you get like $25 worth of tokens or something like that.

28:33.000 --> 28:39.000
So on their birthday party page, they have it, you pay $50 and you get $68 worth of quarters.

28:39.000 --> 28:47.000
And I'm like, that doesn't seem very profitable for you because I could essentially just buy this several times and pay for the party myself.

28:47.000 --> 28:49.000
You would essentially pay for the party.

28:49.000 --> 28:54.000
I don't see how that works, but that's what they have set up right now.

28:54.000 --> 28:59.000
So obviously there hasn't been a ton of thought into the packages that they have.

28:59.000 --> 29:04.000
So yeah, or how they make money. So I don't know, but it was fun.

29:04.000 --> 29:09.000
All right, well good. My gaming week. So y'all want a LARP update?

29:09.000 --> 29:10.000
LARP!

29:10.000 --> 29:16.000
So you missed this chat. I was telling you a little bit beforehand, but so last week on the show, Loki and I were here.

29:16.000 --> 29:21.000
We talked a little bit about that I was asked to play another Survivor game online.

29:21.000 --> 29:25.000
So I was like, what the hey, I've got not a lot going on this month.

29:25.000 --> 29:31.000
Forgetting, absentmindedly, like how much time these games take away from your life.

29:31.000 --> 29:34.000
But everybody who I've met has been really cool so far.

29:34.000 --> 29:44.000
And although I am sad to announce that our tribe has lost four challenges in a row and had to do tribal council four times.

29:44.000 --> 29:50.000
I am happy to announce that your boy is still in it. So there is that.

29:50.000 --> 29:54.000
So that's all I can say because I don't know who's watching or anything like that.

29:54.000 --> 29:59.000
I can't I don't know if the other the other tribe might know about my show or whatever.

29:59.000 --> 30:03.000
So I can't say much more. But yeah, it's I'm having a I'm having a good time.

30:03.000 --> 30:07.000
The people, if nothing else, even though it's like, oh, my God, nonstop.

30:07.000 --> 30:15.000
But the good news is it's not I was able to squeeze in like it's it's it's kind of slowed down enough that I was able to squeeze in some other gaming.

30:15.000 --> 30:21.000
So I was playing some Final Fantasy 14, the new expansion.

30:21.000 --> 30:25.000
I've made my way to level 74. I've done the first two dungeons.

30:25.000 --> 30:31.000
So I'm really kind of getting a sense of the expansion. I got to say, the story is really good so far.

30:31.000 --> 30:35.000
I'm super into it. I didn't think I would be like leading in leading up to all the hype with it.

30:35.000 --> 30:40.000
But like now that I'm playing and experience it like, oh, my God, the story is really good.

30:40.000 --> 30:44.000
And yeah, the dungeon fights have been really cool. The music is is great.

30:44.000 --> 30:48.000
So, yeah, I'm loving loving the new Final Fantasy 14 expansion.

30:48.000 --> 30:55.000
So, yeah, I'll hopefully play more of that later on tonight, just depending on if I got a LARP or not.

30:55.000 --> 30:59.000
And then also I've checked out some new stuff. So I checked out Bloodstained.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.000
I finally got my code for the Nintendo Switch. So I played it.

31:02.000 --> 31:09.000
I struggled a little bit, like trying to beat that first boss. I couldn't like I'm doing something wrong.

31:09.000 --> 31:18.000
I don't know. And I do have the Switch version, which I do notice feels like I feel like she's like ghosting when she jumps and does some weird things that like it controls a little weird.

31:18.000 --> 31:22.000
Do you want to try the PS4 one at our place?

31:22.000 --> 31:25.000
Maybe. Yeah, probably when I'm over next. I kind of want to check that out.

31:25.000 --> 31:31.000
Yeah, for sure. I'd actually like to see how the Switch one plays. So did you? Of course, it's all electronic, right?

31:31.000 --> 31:39.000
It's all digital. So. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm sure I'm sure Dan would want to see it, too, but it's pretty.

31:39.000 --> 31:44.000
So, yeah, I have to figure out, you know, because I kind of got stuck on that first boss. I'm like, wait, this shouldn't be that hard.

31:44.000 --> 31:50.000
But then I was like, distraction, go play something else. And the other something else I ended up playing was Mario Maker 2.

31:50.000 --> 31:55.000
So I played some Super Mario Maker 2. Finally, I haven't done any designing of levels, but I've done a lot of playing levels.

31:55.000 --> 32:03.000
I've played quite a few of the story mode levels so far. And it's kind of neat seeing some of the creative things that they do, not just in the story levels,

32:03.000 --> 32:08.000
but then, of course, some of the user levels. There's some pretty clever stuff and concepts that people are coming up with.

32:08.000 --> 32:13.000
So I'm going to save some of that till a little later in the show, because for our little break in studio tonight,

32:13.000 --> 32:20.000
I'm going to play through some listener levels in Mario Maker. And then there's like a top, like one of the top three levels right now.

32:20.000 --> 32:25.000
I play that too. So we'll take a look at that a little later in the show for those of you that are a little more curious about Mario Maker.

32:25.000 --> 32:30.000
But you guys know I love the Mario Maker on the Wii or the Wii U, excuse me.

32:30.000 --> 32:35.000
And so this one is, you know, especially if you miss the Wii U, it's definitely a worthy successor.

32:35.000 --> 32:41.000
But it does feel like, OK, they've got like a lot more like ways you can customize the looks of the levels.

32:41.000 --> 32:44.000
You know, now you can do the stuff like with the cat Mario and all this stuff.

32:44.000 --> 32:50.000
My only slight disappointment is that I actually kind of miss the amiibo stuff.

32:50.000 --> 32:56.000
And not that it necessarily has to be amiibos, but like the fact that you could get other sprites to replace Mario.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.000
Why can't it be the amiibos? I don't understand why they couldn't.

32:59.000 --> 33:03.000
Well, it was before, so I don't know why they cut that out. I'm a little, I was just a little sad about that.

33:03.000 --> 33:08.000
So, but not everything was amiibo, because like in the original Mario Maker on Wii U, it was like,

33:08.000 --> 33:11.000
go online this week and play this level and you would unlock these.

33:11.000 --> 33:14.000
Maybe they're going to Japanese TV deal DLC.

33:14.000 --> 33:18.000
Maybe it does seem like, you know, a lot of people are maybe just an update.

33:18.000 --> 33:23.000
A lot of people are speculating that Mario Maker kind of has a nice little spot for an extra world

33:23.000 --> 33:27.000
where a lot of people are like Mario to maybe.

33:27.000 --> 33:32.000
I don't know. I think the Game Boy one, because I guess if you actually go through the whole thing,

33:32.000 --> 33:38.000
you can actually unlock like a Game Boy, not the whole level, but like a Mario that looks like the Game Boy version.

33:38.000 --> 33:42.000
Well, they have, who throws the balls, the fireballs, like the ball that bounces around the screen.

33:42.000 --> 33:47.000
Yeah, they have that. And then there's the hammer Mario as well.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
Yeah, the builder Mario or whatever.

33:49.000 --> 33:53.000
So I haven't played all the story mode yet or to the point where you even get that,

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
but I understand those are things that are kind of tucked away,

33:55.000 --> 33:59.000
but I would wonder if they might just do a full on like Game Boy Mario

33:59.000 --> 34:04.000
or maybe like a Wario Land type of thing would be kind of fun too. So we'll see.

34:04.000 --> 34:08.000
I don't know. I just feel like Super Mario Brothers 2 is so different

34:08.000 --> 34:12.000
that that would be so weird if that's the one they end up doing. But you know, who knows?

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
It would be awesome. I would love it.

34:14.000 --> 34:21.000
I just feel like it's so much different than the other Mario games because of course it started as a completely different game.

34:21.000 --> 34:27.000
Yeah. So it'd be interesting. I could see maybe a Japanese Mario 2 skin

34:27.000 --> 34:32.000
that changes the look of all the bricks and things like that and let you do poison mushrooms and stuff.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
You can do poison mushrooms.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.000
You can do that now, huh?

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
I miss the amiibos.

34:38.000 --> 34:42.000
It's interesting to me they just don't have the Mario 2 Japan skin for it.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.000
No, no. So anyway.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.000
I miss amiibo.

34:46.000 --> 34:50.000
Didn't they have like the Tandy or something like that? That weird version of Mario?

34:50.000 --> 34:56.000
Now Bobby says the downside of the costumes is that they were only in the Super Mario palette,

34:56.000 --> 34:58.000
so most levels were in Super Mario Brothers 1.

34:58.000 --> 35:02.000
By getting rid of the costumes, the level backgrounds are more varied.

35:02.000 --> 35:05.000
I'm okay with them taking some liberties though.

35:05.000 --> 35:11.000
It's not like we actually expect the 8-bit Mario levels to be things that are playable on an 8-bit cartridge.

35:11.000 --> 35:18.000
I think Mario Maker is going to come into its own, so I don't feel like they have to go by all the palette rules and things like that.

35:18.000 --> 35:22.000
But I don't know. Maybe it's a weird thing in development.

35:22.000 --> 35:27.000
Or bring back the amiibo in the Mario 3D World thing or something.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.000
But I liked it in the old school Mario.

35:30.000 --> 35:35.000
Oh right. Bobby's saying, no I mean they didn't put the costumes in the other versions.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
You couldn't use the costumes in Super Mario World.

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
No, that's true. It was unique to the 8-bit.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
But I was okay with that.

35:42.000 --> 35:47.000
But if they wanted to bring them into Super Mario 3 or something different, I like that kind of variety.

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
It made for some more fun themed levels.

35:49.000 --> 35:54.000
I remember there was like a little, oh you can play Ashley the witch from WarioWare was a character you could get.

35:54.000 --> 35:57.000
And I made some levels around that and I thought it was cute and fun.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
But anyway.

35:58.000 --> 36:02.000
But otherwise, I think Mario Maker 2 is fantastic.

36:02.000 --> 36:05.000
And we'll see a little bit more of that later on in the show.

36:05.000 --> 36:10.000
So, I think we are good to get into our news for the week.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
Just a couple quick housekeeping things though.

36:12.000 --> 36:16.000
I do want to just, you know, again for those that are not listening to Bobby Blackwolf,

36:16.000 --> 36:20.000
who happened to be in the southeast part of the country, specifically the Atlanta area.

36:20.000 --> 36:27.000
Bobby will be representing Voice Geek Network, VoG Network, who is sponsoring the Southern Fried Game Room Expo,

36:27.000 --> 36:30.000
or excuse me, Gaming Expo, because they changed the name not that long ago.

36:30.000 --> 36:36.000
We are sponsoring that and that is taking place in Atlanta this coming weekend.

36:36.000 --> 36:40.000
So, if you want to play some old school games, some old pinball we were talking about later in the show,

36:40.000 --> 36:46.000
or other old school games and see some panels and hang out with people, I would highly recommend it.

36:46.000 --> 36:52.000
I would be going myself if I wasn't going to be back in Atlanta in six weeks for Dragon Con,

36:52.000 --> 36:57.000
which is the other thing I would announce that Dragon Con, of course, is Labor Day weekend.

36:57.000 --> 37:01.000
That's all over downtown Atlanta and that is going to be a lot of fun.

37:01.000 --> 37:04.000
And I can't say everything I'm doing yet.

37:04.000 --> 37:11.000
I've just seen some of the drafts and it's going to be a very big year for VoG.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
I'm very excited about it.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.000
I'm like really pumped for this year's show.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.000
I'm really, really excited.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.000
Cool.

37:18.000 --> 37:21.000
I have to tell you, dark side, remind me off air, I've got to tell you about one of the panels I'm doing,

37:21.000 --> 37:24.000
I'm scheduled to do that, yeah, I'll tell you about it.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
So, anyway, leave me with that little teaser.

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Is it something that will have me shook?

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
I don't know if it was shook, but you'll probably know.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.000
Maybe a slight quake?

37:31.000 --> 37:32.000
More like, oh neat.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
Oh, quiver.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.000
Oh, quiver.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.000
A little like, ooh.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.000
Oh, quiver.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.000
So, that's it.

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
Okay, let's get into some newsy news.

37:40.000 --> 37:45.000
Yes, so everybody's very excited about all these exclusives on the Epic Games Store.

37:45.000 --> 37:50.000
I say that very sarcastically because nobody likes it at all.

37:50.000 --> 37:57.000
Unfortunately, there's a lot of games that people had kickstarted that were under the impression that this was going to be out on Steam

37:57.000 --> 38:02.000
and now are being told, well guess what, it's actually going to be an Epic Source exclusive

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
and of course people are not happy with that.

38:04.000 --> 38:10.000
So, one of those games definitely more notable is Shenmue 3, which was kickstarted

38:10.000 --> 38:18.000
and of course fans of that series who did back the game are now wondering, well, can I get a refund?

38:18.000 --> 38:23.000
Because I don't want my game on the Epic Store, I want it on Steam.

38:23.000 --> 38:29.000
And so, as of originally when they reached out to the development team

38:29.000 --> 38:33.000
they said that, well no, we're not going to do refunds at all.

38:33.000 --> 38:41.000
But Tim Sweeney has come out now kind of making a comment about these Epic Score exclusives and Kickstarter.

38:41.000 --> 38:47.000
So, what they've promised to do now is they're going to actually fund the cost of the Kickstarter refunds

38:47.000 --> 38:56.000
resulting from the move to the Epic Games Store so that the refunds aren't going to affect the developer's funding.

38:57.000 --> 38:59.000
So, of course they're doing this for EaseNet.

38:59.000 --> 39:07.000
And they said, going forward, when future games go Epic exclusive after offering crowdfunding rewards on other PC stores

39:07.000 --> 39:13.000
we will either coordinate with colleagues at the other stores to ensure key availability in advance

39:13.000 --> 39:16.000
or guaranteed refunds at the announcement time.

39:16.000 --> 39:22.000
So, good on them doing that, but still shitty that this is a thing.

39:22.000 --> 39:28.000
And it's funny enough though, I know with Shimu 3 they've gotten all sorts of money from different places.

39:28.000 --> 39:35.000
They have a publisher, and that same publisher also did this kind of shit as well with Epic Score exclusive.

39:35.000 --> 39:42.000
So, I don't know. I understand originally why people wanted to go Epic Store exclusive

39:42.000 --> 39:46.000
because less games on the platform, you get a larger cut.

39:46.000 --> 39:52.000
But I think that a lot of these AAA companies are starting to abuse that to get more profits.

39:52.000 --> 39:56.000
But at least that people that don't are really...

39:56.000 --> 40:03.000
So, Ben Alshea about Epic having the exclusive on something have an option to get a refund if they want to.

40:03.000 --> 40:11.000
Yeah, so that was obviously a messy scenario with Shimu 3 where some people just do not want to support Epic Store for whatever reason.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
And I respect their right to do so.

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
This is pretty bare bones, and I get it. The features aren't there.

40:16.000 --> 40:21.000
Well, and there's concerns about the privacy stuff too, like when they were pulling in your Steam stuff without really asking.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
So, I get it. I respect that.

40:23.000 --> 40:28.000
But that is good that Epic at least kind of found a way to, even though it's interesting,

40:28.000 --> 40:33.000
because they're essentially going to pay people to not use their store.

40:33.000 --> 40:39.000
But you're right, otherwise it was kind of a crappy thing for the crowdfunding sites to do.

40:39.000 --> 40:43.000
It is kind of ridiculous to see them solve all their problems by throwing money at it.

40:43.000 --> 40:46.000
I mean, they're like, oh, we need more people on the platform. Let's throw money at this problem.

40:46.000 --> 40:51.000
Oh, people don't like that their games are exclusive to the platform. Let's throw some more money at that problem.

40:51.000 --> 40:54.000
How much money do we need to throw you before you're happy?

40:54.000 --> 40:58.000
Hey, but Fortnite is still huge for Epic. That game is still huge.

40:58.000 --> 41:03.000
Didn't make the show world tonight, but there's a whole Stranger Things thing going on in Fortnite right now.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
Oh, they've got all sorts of tie-ins with everything.

41:05.000 --> 41:09.000
It was like last week, or was it a month ago, it was like John Wick.

41:09.000 --> 41:13.000
I remember the one where you go in and you hear the Weezer album in the creative level.

41:13.000 --> 41:17.000
Yeah, and Thanos has been in there a few times. So they do all sorts of things.

41:17.000 --> 41:22.000
But it's because Fortnite is the biggest thing in games still.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
So they can kind of control that conversation.

41:24.000 --> 41:30.000
But they want something to be able to carry them when inevitably gamers move on from Fortnite.

41:30.000 --> 41:37.000
Because just as you may not hear Minecraft as much anymore, or what are the big Twitch games?

41:37.000 --> 41:40.000
PUBG, I guess. You don't hear as much anymore.

41:40.000 --> 41:45.000
Not to say those games are dead, not by any means, but they're just not what they were.

41:45.000 --> 41:50.000
Pokemon Go, sure. Same type of thing. Wasn't what it was, but it's still cooking.

41:50.000 --> 41:55.000
So anyway, all right. Well, let's talk a little bit.

41:55.000 --> 41:58.000
This one's a little more in the rumors section. What can I say?

41:58.000 --> 42:04.000
It's a bit of a slower news week, so we're willing to tackle a few more rumors that go around the net.

42:04.000 --> 42:08.000
But this is... there might be some traction to this.

42:08.000 --> 42:17.000
Because some comments that were made by Sony Interactive Entertainment president Jim Ryan

42:17.000 --> 42:20.000
in an interview to Nikkei that was translated.

42:20.000 --> 42:27.000
He says that the company is thinking about possibly merging and acquiring more development companies.

42:27.000 --> 42:32.000
Because Google is starting to get in there with Stadia and so forth.

42:32.000 --> 42:37.000
And one of the quotes from the interview is he said,

42:37.000 --> 42:41.000
content is becoming more important than ever before.

42:41.000 --> 42:47.000
Sony Interactive Entertainment has 25 years of experience in the games industry and has big assets.

42:47.000 --> 42:52.000
So it's not like they don't have things like God of War and Last of Us

42:52.000 --> 42:54.000
and a lot of big titles that are still carrying them.

42:54.000 --> 42:58.000
But I'm sure they're looking at things like what could Google Stadia be cooking up.

42:58.000 --> 43:03.000
And as well as Microsoft has done a ton of acquisitions in the past couple of years

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
to really position their next console.

43:05.000 --> 43:08.000
You might not be seeing the payoff yet on Xbox One,

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
but I imagine by the time their next console is about to hit,

43:10.000 --> 43:14.000
we're going to really see the payoff for all these studios that they've been acquiring.

43:14.000 --> 43:19.000
So I think Sony wants to make sure that they're on top of that as well, if that makes sense.

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
Probably, yeah, it makes sense.

43:21.000 --> 43:25.000
Now, obviously, we have no idea who they're looking at acquiring.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.000
We're not going to know that.

43:26.000 --> 43:35.000
But perhaps Microsoft has been acquiring mostly US, North American, I think some Europe studios.

43:35.000 --> 43:38.000
Maybe Sony is going to go after some Japanese studios.

43:38.000 --> 43:42.000
I don't think Microsoft has acquired anything Japanese at this point, if I'm not mistaken.

43:42.000 --> 43:44.000
I might be neglecting something in the moment.

43:44.000 --> 43:49.000
They're just going to acquire Devolver Digital and have them run their whole PR campaign.

43:49.000 --> 43:52.000
Who knows? Have them run their E3 next year, certainly.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
That could possibly be, right?

43:54.000 --> 43:56.000
Ah, yes.

43:56.000 --> 44:02.000
But we don't know if they're going to be planning anything similar to Xbox Game Pass or anything like that.

44:02.000 --> 44:07.000
But yeah, Sony just wants to make sure the PlayStation 5 is going to have stuff on it at launch.

44:07.000 --> 44:12.000
Backwards compatibility, hopefully that's not going to be the issue for Sony like it's been in the past.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
So hopefully they'll have that, if nothing else.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
But we will see.

44:16.000 --> 44:24.000
They just need to get the stick out of their ass about that and modding and cross-play.

44:24.000 --> 44:28.000
I don't know, whatever else they have sticks in their ass about.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
Where's my goddamn Ridge Racer game?

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
I know that's not Sony, but still.

44:32.000 --> 44:33.000
Hey, Namco.

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
Namco, seriously, get off your ass.

44:35.000 --> 44:36.000
I mean, what the fuck are you doing?

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
What is Namco doing anyway?

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
I need a new point blank.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
I need a new Ridge Racer.

44:40.000 --> 44:41.000
What the hell are you putting out?

44:41.000 --> 44:42.000
More Tekken games?

44:42.000 --> 44:44.000
I mean, we don't fucking need more Tekken games.

44:44.000 --> 44:45.000
Tekken is awesome.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
There's a new Tales game that they showed off.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
I don't care, I want my point blank, dammit.

44:49.000 --> 44:50.000
Point blank.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.000
Ridge Racer.

44:51.000 --> 44:54.000
I'm sure there's a new Pac-Man thing in development.

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
I want a point blank Ridge Racer game.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
Guns and Cars.

44:57.000 --> 44:58.000
Yes.

44:58.000 --> 45:00.000
Would it be like Lucky and Wild?

45:00.000 --> 45:01.000
Yeah, Lucky and Wild.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Oh my god, we had one at my arcade that I worked at.

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
Lucky and Wild was kind of fun.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
Alright, let's move on.

45:07.000 --> 45:08.000
I hated being the driver, though.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.000
Dark soccer.

45:10.000 --> 45:16.000
So, Nintendo, being the internet-phobic company that they have historically been,

45:16.000 --> 45:22.000
is actually talking about the future of gaming being in the cloud.

45:22.000 --> 45:25.000
They must keep up with the cloud.

45:25.000 --> 45:29.000
You know, I hate, by the way, just an aside, I hate when people say,

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
oh, but the cloud, I'm afraid of the cloud.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
Do you know what the cloud is, people?

45:33.000 --> 45:34.000
It's computer.

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
The internet.

45:35.000 --> 45:36.000
It's the internet.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.000
Don't be freaked out by the cloud.

45:38.000 --> 45:42.000
But the cloud is always listening on my conversations.

45:42.000 --> 45:43.000
And you know what?

45:43.000 --> 45:47.000
So is everything else always fucking listening to your conversations.

45:47.000 --> 45:48.000
So, whatever.

45:48.000 --> 45:52.000
I feel like the cloud is just people's, it's Skynet for most people.

45:52.000 --> 45:55.000
It's so funny having to explain this to people.

45:55.000 --> 45:58.000
Okay, so do you have the same fear when you do a Google search?

45:58.000 --> 45:59.000
No.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.000
Okay.

46:00.000 --> 46:02.000
What about when you save a file on your computer?

46:02.000 --> 46:03.000
No.

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
What about when you visit Pornhub?

46:05.000 --> 46:11.000
Pornhub knows what you're doing.

46:11.000 --> 46:14.000
I would comment, but it would maybe out where I work,

46:14.000 --> 46:22.000
but I have done screen sharing with somebody and saw his professional portfolio.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.000
Ah.

46:24.000 --> 46:26.000
It has been there.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.000
There's a little wink with that.

46:27.000 --> 46:28.000
All right.

46:28.000 --> 46:29.000
Anyway, next up in gaming.

46:29.000 --> 46:33.000
So anyway, there was the shareholder meeting.

46:33.000 --> 46:38.000
And basically the Nintendo executives were asked what they thought about cloud gaming.

46:38.000 --> 46:45.000
And here is a direct translation from the Nintendo president Furukawa Shuntaro.

46:45.000 --> 46:49.000
And I'm going to read the whole quote because it's pretty interesting.

46:49.000 --> 46:52.000
While we don't expect all games to become cloud games any time soon,

46:52.000 --> 46:54.000
the technologies are definitely advancing.

46:54.000 --> 46:58.000
We see a future where cloud and streaming technologies will develop more and more

46:58.000 --> 47:01.000
as a means of delivering games to customers.

47:01.000 --> 47:02.000
Sorry, consumers.

47:02.000 --> 47:05.000
We must keep up with such changes in the environment.

47:05.000 --> 47:08.000
That being said, if these changes increase the worldwide gaming population,

47:08.000 --> 47:12.000
that will just give us more opportunities with our integrated hardware

47:12.000 --> 47:15.000
and software development approach to reach people worldwide

47:15.000 --> 47:18.000
with the unique entertainment that Nintendo can provide.

47:18.000 --> 47:22.000
So this meaning that they may be going more and more digital

47:22.000 --> 47:26.000
with a lot more of their content as well as saving their games,

47:26.000 --> 47:30.000
integrating some of that cloud technology in with the games as they progress.

47:30.000 --> 47:37.000
And Miyamoto basically agreed that it's going to become more widespread in the future.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
But he doesn't think it's going to replace consoles.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Not yet.

47:41.000 --> 47:46.000
I mean, so it's very interesting.

47:46.000 --> 47:50.000
Nintendo doesn't have a cloud service of their own right now.

47:50.000 --> 47:53.000
Not a true cloud service.

47:53.000 --> 47:56.000
But it's possible it could be in the pipeline.

47:56.000 --> 48:00.000
And one of the other things that came out of that

48:00.000 --> 48:04.000
is that they said that they'd consider whether each product that they offer

48:04.000 --> 48:07.000
is suited to a subscription model.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
So we'll see what happens.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Well, yeah, Nintendo's certainly got to be thinking about it,

48:11.000 --> 48:14.000
especially with what some of the competition around them is doing

48:14.000 --> 48:16.000
between Xbox and Google.

48:16.000 --> 48:20.000
But I really think that them kind of waiting on this one.

48:20.000 --> 48:23.000
I know we always make fun of Nintendo being late to the online party,

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
but I wouldn't want to make fun of them here

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
and then under the exact same breath be like,

48:27.000 --> 48:31.000
but I think Google's too early to the cloud streaming party

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
when it comes to things like Internet bandwidth caps

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
and just like what you're, you know.

48:35.000 --> 48:38.000
I think once 5G is more widely available,

48:38.000 --> 48:41.000
then we can have more of a conversation about, you know, Google Stadia

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
and what it might bring to the equation.

48:43.000 --> 48:47.000
But I think it's okay that Nintendo is still kind of being dormant on this for a little while

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
and kind of seeing what happens to other people first.

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
I, for one, welcome our cloud overlords.

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
I'm just kidding.

48:53.000 --> 49:00.000
I think that there are some companies that do cloud very well and some that do not.

49:00.000 --> 49:05.000
The thing that I, and I'll go ahead and admit, I've used several cloud services.

49:05.000 --> 49:08.000
I've used Amazon's cloud storage.

49:08.000 --> 49:11.000
Of course, I have an iPhone. I use iCloud,

49:11.000 --> 49:14.000
which I actually prefer because of the level of encryption on it.

49:14.000 --> 49:19.000
But secondly, you don't have to use it to be able to use your device properly.

49:19.000 --> 49:23.000
Unlike what some people think, it's really not necessary.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Yeah, I don't use it.

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
I've used Google's cloud services.

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
Their photos thing is pretty interesting.

49:29.000 --> 49:32.000
I still prefer my iCloud photos.

49:32.000 --> 49:36.000
But there's plenty of other cloud services out there.

49:36.000 --> 49:39.000
I mean Dropbox in and of itself is a cloud service.

49:39.000 --> 49:40.000
True.

49:40.000 --> 49:42.000
And how many of us use our Dropbox?

49:42.000 --> 49:44.000
This show kind of needs it.

49:44.000 --> 49:52.000
Wouldn't it be something if there was a Dropbox-like service?

49:52.000 --> 49:59.000
Not just, though, remember what was the thing called the Dex Drives for the Playstation?

49:59.000 --> 50:00.000
Yeah.

50:00.000 --> 50:06.000
Wouldn't it be cool if you could save, if you could publish your save files?

50:07.000 --> 50:13.000
So that, hey, I did this in this game. Check out my character.

50:13.000 --> 50:19.000
Some of the forums, someone used to upload their Mass Effect save files.

50:19.000 --> 50:23.000
But that would be cheating now because there's achievements and all that sort of stuff.

50:23.000 --> 50:29.000
But it would probably be a cinch to encode that this was an uploaded file.

50:29.000 --> 50:35.000
You would think, but you could tie them back to the profile or something like that.

50:35.000 --> 50:42.000
But I know when it comes to Nintendo, that's why they didn't even allow backing up of certain saves.

50:42.000 --> 50:47.000
There's no cloud saves for certain games because they're worried that people are going to somehow cheat.

50:47.000 --> 50:51.000
Even though they're cheating in other ways. Not this.

50:51.000 --> 51:00.000
But then in using cloud services, we already have, for example, we have multiplayer.

51:00.000 --> 51:03.000
That's roughly a cloud service, too. It's a streaming service.

51:03.000 --> 51:08.000
But what if you have things like a cloud-based collaboration for things like Mario Maker?

51:08.000 --> 51:12.000
Where you can have a bunch of friends remotely put a game together.

51:12.000 --> 51:20.000
You know, there's so many applications for it that I really am looking forward to seeing more companies embrace it.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.000
But they're going to have to step up their encryption game.

51:22.000 --> 51:25.000
I'm getting some comments from our chat over Twitch TV slash VOG Network.

51:25.000 --> 51:30.000
Taijudo says, Nintendo has always used the internet in ways Sony and Microsoft didn't.

51:30.000 --> 51:35.000
They did online tourneys built into their games. They had the Nintendo forum thing, the PC chat.

51:35.000 --> 51:39.000
They always do online stuff, just not in traditional ways. They innovate.

51:39.000 --> 51:42.000
Sometimes they innovate, but sometimes I feel like they're lagging behind.

51:42.000 --> 51:46.000
I think that Nintendo Online Switch app, I think that's kind of lagging behind a little bit.

51:46.000 --> 51:50.000
I just feel like people are not using that as much as they're using things like Discord and stuff.

51:50.000 --> 51:55.000
But to your credit, I will say something like Miiverse was very different.

51:55.000 --> 52:00.000
And the way they incorporated things like Miiverse into things like Mario Maker, we'll say on the Wii U.

52:00.000 --> 52:04.000
And that kind of lives on a little bit in what they do in Mario Maker 2.

52:04.000 --> 52:09.000
That was kind of unique and very different from what Sony and Microsoft were doing.

52:09.000 --> 52:13.000
So I will give you that. Like Miiverse especially was something very different.

52:13.000 --> 52:18.000
Questbuster in chat says, cloud is coming and digital services are on the rise.

52:18.000 --> 52:24.000
There's no denying that, but I still prefer local control over what I can and cannot install on my console.

52:24.000 --> 52:29.000
Except with a good cloud service, you can control what you can and can't install.

52:29.000 --> 52:38.000
With my Steam, for example, I can have it do cloud saves, which I turned off for some of my games.

52:38.000 --> 52:43.000
Because the cloud saves did some weird syncing. Actually, no, it was for Origin.

52:43.000 --> 52:47.000
It was screwing up my Mass Effect saves. And my Dragon Age ones too.

52:47.000 --> 52:54.000
I turned it off in Origin, but any good cloud service will still give you fine control.

52:54.000 --> 52:58.000
You just have to spend the time to go through your preferences. End of story.

52:58.000 --> 53:05.000
And again, before you look into any particular cloud service, go check how good their encryption is.

53:05.000 --> 53:10.000
That's a big thing. Make sure your own internet is secure.

53:10.000 --> 53:14.000
As long as you're careful, there's no problem.

53:14.000 --> 53:19.000
Let's move on. We have some more gaming news to get into before we get to the Classic Game of the Week.

53:19.000 --> 53:30.000
This is interesting because it's a brand new feature for Twitch, which allows you to do the subscriber-only streams.

53:30.000 --> 53:34.000
So you can have this exclusive thing that only your subscribers can see.

53:34.000 --> 53:41.000
The problem with that, though, is apparently some of these end-user license agreements prohibit that.

53:41.000 --> 53:59.000
So, for example, companies like Blizzard, Valve, Riot, and CG Project Red have terms that contain statements to the fact that when you're streaming, you have to do it in a way that it's not going to be...

53:59.000 --> 54:05.000
I don't know why it's saved enough for money, but it's basically that you have to be used in a non-commercial way.

54:05.000 --> 54:13.000
The use of our content and videos must be non-commercial. By that we mean you can't charge users to view or access your videos.

54:13.000 --> 54:18.000
You can't sell or license your videos to others for any payment of any kind.

54:18.000 --> 54:26.000
Which I kind of wonder if already charging for stuff is not necessarily charging. I mean, I guess with ads it's not really charging for it, but like...

54:26.000 --> 54:33.000
Well, I think a lot of that stuff is probably written, too, so that people don't make tapes or CDs or Blu-rays of the games.

54:33.000 --> 54:36.000
Hey, yo! You wanna get some of my Overwatch tapes?

54:36.000 --> 54:43.000
Hold up, hold up. The reason why my head goes there is because where my brain goes is to those old GameProTV tapes.

54:43.000 --> 54:44.000
Tips and tricks.

54:44.000 --> 54:50.000
Yeah, the tips and tricks stuff. So, like, I'm not just being old, but maybe I'm being a little old. So, you know, there's that.

54:50.000 --> 54:54.000
And so they don't want people, you know, making money off that without maybe some type of buy-in.

54:54.000 --> 55:03.000
Because I would imagine those tapes back in the day, probably the publishers got a little bit of kickback for, you know, those usage in the videos and stuff.

55:03.000 --> 55:04.000
Yeah.

55:04.000 --> 55:13.000
But, you know, they don't want people to do that. Or any type of, like, selling Blu-rays or, you know, selling how to beat XYZ game, you know, type of stuff without maybe some type of contribution there.

55:13.000 --> 55:21.000
So I feel like maybe a lot of this was written before the idea of a Twitch subscriber only thing, but I don't know if you had more. Sorry.

55:21.000 --> 55:34.000
Yeah. So it's basically, it's kind of a gray area right now that whether they are going to be in violation of these terms of services if they're using that service.

55:34.000 --> 55:43.000
I'm sure that, like, something like this, if it becomes more popular, I'm sure that they'll adjust their terms of services depending on what's being required of this.

55:43.000 --> 55:51.000
I don't know if this is necessarily, like, really different than saying putting the exclusive videos on Patreon or something like that.

55:51.000 --> 56:06.000
I mean, I don't know. I think it's, I think right now we're not really sure what it's going to entail, but I don't think that people are going to, like, get sued by these companies if they use this service.

56:06.000 --> 56:21.000
I don't either. But I do also think part of us, like, I think a lot of Twitch stuff, we're very lucky that publishers haven't kind of come to stake their claim for the fact that they made the game y'all are playing and getting biddies and subscriptions.

56:21.000 --> 56:29.000
Well, that would be unfortunate for them, because guess what? And I'm assuming big publishers with, you know, their own law department, legal departments and stuff like that.

56:29.000 --> 56:38.000
Guess what, big publishers? There's a lot of smaller indie publishers that would love seeing people play their game in a similar fashion, so you could miss out on that.

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
So it kind of ends up being this gigantic game of chicken.

56:40.000 --> 56:54.000
Pretty much, yeah. Like, you can threaten people, but, like, if you're going to be, like, an asshole about it, Nintendo, though they did walk it back, I mean, there's just going to be ways around it that you could go.

56:54.000 --> 57:00.000
I mean, and even this, I don't know if this is going to be something that a lot of people use. It may be just more beneficial to them, I would think.

57:00.000 --> 57:11.000
Like, I know subscriptions are a decent amount of money, but I think a lot of people make, a lot of big streamers make more money from donations and biddies and stuff like that.

57:11.000 --> 57:18.000
I would think that you'd be more interested in making sure that the most, as many people could see that stream as possible.

57:18.000 --> 57:25.000
I mean, the only time I could think of that you'd want to do, like, an exclusive stream like that might be for, like, maybe announcements or something like that. I don't know.

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
But, like, Q&A's, ask me anything.

57:27.000 --> 57:42.000
Yeah, like, something like that. Yeah, exactly. So, I don't know necessarily gameplay would be locked behind the stuff, but I would imagine that most large streamers are going to be more interested in just getting people to watch their stream so that they can donate money to them.

57:43.000 --> 57:51.000
A very special ASMR subscriber only. Only subscribers.

57:53.000 --> 57:58.000
That's where this is going to get used. Tell me I'm wrong. Tell me I'm wrong.

57:58.000 --> 57:59.000
Unsubscribe.

58:02.000 --> 58:03.000
But anyway.

58:03.000 --> 58:04.000
Well, you know.

58:04.000 --> 58:05.000
What?

58:05.000 --> 58:11.000
We could, you know, do one of those streams and then you could just sell some bathwater with that as well.

58:13.000 --> 58:23.000
Look, uh, yeah, I don't think we really have plans to use that here at the VoiceGeeks Network. I sure might, I don't know, Bobby had a pretty good idea about, like, having a controlled Jackbox game.

58:23.000 --> 58:24.000
That would be kind of cool.

58:24.000 --> 58:35.000
A-holes don't join and so, like, maybe doing, like, VIPs and subscribers and all that. I thought that was a pretty clever idea so that way you don't get the randos joining in, like, putting, you know, trying to derail your game.

58:35.000 --> 58:52.000
But I think for the most part, I mean, certainly, you know, we are very appreciative of all the subs we get here at VOG Network and all the bit donations as well, but believe me, we just had some flyers printed to give away at Southern Fry Game Room Expo and we didn't have to pay for that out of pocket thanks to you guys helping us out.

58:52.000 --> 59:07.000
So that's going to help us get out the word of VOG Network. So we really appreciate all of that. And if you guys, you know, continue to subscribe, remember the perk is, is that the one thing we do lock away is all the video content if you're not here live.

59:07.000 --> 59:18.000
So you can watch the video live, but you only get the podcast part for free. I say only, but that is, you know, 17 years of our show has been always, like, online only and free.

59:18.000 --> 59:25.000
It's just we like, oh, this is like a little something extra we can give for a little something extra. It's not that much money.

59:25.000 --> 59:33.000
And you get Bobby as well and any other future show that comes here to VOG Network. So anyway, all right.

59:33.000 --> 59:39.000
Moving on. Gosh, I'm just looking at some of the comments in chat. Somebody clip that. That's great.

59:39.000 --> 59:48.000
Yeah. All right. Anyway, Tiger Claw says they could use this feature to stream adults only stuff. No, because now people still get a five minute preview.

59:48.000 --> 59:54.000
I think of even the subscriber only feeds and Twitch still has their rules about broadcasting.

59:54.000 --> 01:00:00.000
I can't like suddenly take my shirt off because it's a subscriber only. I'm not going to because it's a subscriber only stream.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Blindness, Rob. I know. Right. It's yeah. The whole thing would break anyway.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:10.000
But like, you know, that is part of Twitch policies is that, you know, you don't have your shirt on when you're streaming, please know that.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:19.000
So. All right. Yeah, that's right. And Bobby says there are other sites that do live streaming for adult content, complete with money changing hands.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:26.000
That's right. That's right. So, yes, they have. If you'd like a list of some contact me after the show.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Just that. Just ask your your favorite listening smart listening device.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:35.000
You and I may have some different tastes, though, so you may want to ask somebody else like Logie.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:45.000
All right. Anyway, move it on. Move it on. Let's talk about something that will be for everybody's taste, because I know people are fans of this series.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Y'all remember River City Ransom on the end? Yeah, I saw like actual gameplay of that and it looked pretty cool.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Yeah, well, well, that was the old school one. Was it? No, the new one. That's right.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Yeah. It's coming out called River City Girls Way Forward has announced that River City Girls is on its way out.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:08.000
It features high school girls, Kyoko and Misako that are going to beat some people up.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Are they wearing like this? The whole Sukeban outfit? They look like they're dressed like Japanese schoolgirls.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.000
It's kind of what they're dressed as. But I mean, to be fair, that would fit in.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:23.000
The original one was supposed to be in high school as well. So I'm not thinking it's exploitative.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:31.000
It actually does. It's it's for plot purposes. But anyway, you play it for the plot.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Yeah. They get to wield baseball bats, bikes, park benches, because you could do that in the original.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:44.000
They're basically being Sukeban. Yeah. Yeah. So it looks a little bit retro, but it doesn't look like the old Kunio-kun games.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:51.000
It definitely has a new art style to it. And apparently guest appearances from older River City characters will be in this as well.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:57.000
So that's pretty cool. There's also going to be a soundtrack. Some indie artists like Chip Zell and Nate Wants to Battle.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:02.000
That's gonna be pretty cool. And they're saying anime and manga style cut scenes.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:09.000
So I just hope, I just hope, just like in River City Ransom, one of the enemies when you defeat them will go barf, just like in the old school.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000
This does look really cute.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Right. Yeah. It looks kind of fun. So there will be a thirty dollar release on September 5th digitally on the various PC stores.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Humble Bundle, Steam, GOG. I notice Epic isn't in there, though. So interesting.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:32.000
It will also come out on PlayStation 4, Switch and Xbox One. There will be a physical version through Limited Run Games at some point.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:38.000
So, yeah, I would want to check this out. I love the old River City games and the Kunio-kun games in general are usually a lot of fun.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:42.000
This is kind of doing some different stuff, but I'm into it.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Yeah, it looks cute.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000
It does. So. All right.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Mm hmm. Yeah, I was just looking in chat. Act Def says way forward with the all the great announcements this week.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Quest Buster saying River City Girls looks good.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Dr. Suna says the visuals kind of reminded me of the Scott Pilgrim game.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:05.000
That's what I was thinking, which was definitely inspired by the series. So that's a very good call out there.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.000
So. All right. Well, let's move on. We have a few more stories for you guys.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:19.000
Well, there is an Atari game that is going for ninety thousand dollars on eBay.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:23.000
It's Atari twenty six hundred game. It is not the rarest game of all time.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:29.000
People like to say that they are. But honestly, I think like if it was going to be the rarest game ever,

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:33.000
there would have been like one of it made and it was never sold and blah, blah, blah.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:42.000
So anyway, this game is called Extra Terrestrials, which is a knockoff of this shitball known as E.T.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:51.000
It came out in 1993 and there were a few copies that made it out.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Very few copies. And one of them is now on the eBay's.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:06.000
It is supposed to be pretty obscure. I mean, because it was also just sort of like a self published game at the time.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:15.000
But then again, it was one of the last games before that actually was made after the crash of 83.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:25.000
So it's. Honestly, someone saw E.T. and they're like, wow, that sold so well, I got to make another one.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:33.000
I'll be honest, I would have to see what it actually looked like if it was like something that they improved on E.T. or anything.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.000
E.T. Battle Royale. But the seller is Game Wizard 69.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Oh my God. And the quote says that they are the only confirmed private owner of this game right now, with the only other one being the P.C. Museum.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:51.000
I kind of want that now. The listing is for the cartridge only, no box manual or other materials.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:57.000
In accept quote, fingers acceptable case. No, they can see a finger.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:06.000
There you go. Acceptable condition. And it arrives in a Lucite case.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:11.000
I saw some clips of the game online. It does. It looks like E.T. meets Pac-Man.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:18.000
That's like they stole the sprites from E.T. But I guess it was a Canadian developed thing with only like 100 copies in existence or something.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Well, apparently there's two left, I don't know. But I wouldn't pay $90,000 for it.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:30.000
I wouldn't have even paid like $500 for stadium events if it had gone down that low.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:37.000
So, however, I do have copies of Final Fight Guy and Ninja Gaiden Trilogy if someone wants to make me an offer.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
You've been putting that offer on the table for years.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Well, I haven't put it on actual eBay yet. I mean, if I put it on eBay, that'd be a different story.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:50.000
But I would rather O.L.R. listeners own a piece of my collection for a lot of money.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Own a piece of the vault.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Make me an offer that's above a couple hundred dollars.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Alright, because those are some pretty rare, like the Final Fight Guy. Final Fight Guy was only a blockbuster thing, right?

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Correct. But yeah, help me pay down my credit card. Help me pay for my roof.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Alright, let's move on. A few more stories for you guys. Loki.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:17.000
So, I don't know if this is canon in other games, but apparently there's Armored Mewtwo coming to Pokémon GO.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:29.000
So from July 10th through July 30th, they're going to have Mewtwo appearing in 5-star raids across the globe.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:35.000
And so you'll be able to battle to catch that Mewtwo, which I can only imagine is going to be insanely hard to catch.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:43.000
And the other thing teased as well is apparently that there may be the inclusion of Team Rocket at some point soon.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Because there is a hot air balloon over some Dortmund event.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Oh yeah, like the Pokémon GO Fest in Europe, yeah.

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Yes.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:56.000
That'd be kind of fun. Maybe there'll be a quest or something. You can dress like Team Rocket though.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Because my guy wears a little rainbow R-shirt because, hello, my name's Rob, so like, you know, it works.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Yeah, so that'd be pretty cool.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.000
You're secretly Team Rocket.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Prepare for trouble.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
And make it double.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.000
So, yeah, I'd be down. I think it'd be cool.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Now, are they saying if Armored Mewtwo will be shiny? Because that's the thing that seems to get more people to raids, is shiny chances.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:27.000
I'm sure that there will be a chance to get a shiny, but that chance is going to be very minimal.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:34.000
I had a pretty funny Niantic day over the weekend. I didn't talk about this in my gaming week, but I met some friends at a local park here.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:41.000
And there was a few of us, and so we quickly did the raid in Pokémon GO. None of us got a shiny.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:45.000
In fact, I think the little shit ran for me anyway, but it was a Grudon. I already have one of those.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:52.000
So we did the raid, and then we switched over to Ingress and made the park sevens so that we could farm it a little bit.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:56.000
And then we switched to Harry Potter Wizards Unite so we could go do the fortress.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:02.000
And I got to do my first five-person fortress battle, and that was pretty fun because they're very different than raids.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:08.000
You have to kind of be like, okay, I'm strong against the 27. I'm going to take the 27. I'm going to hex the 29 for whoever's going in.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:15.000
I see your low on health. I'm going to heal you. You might want to pop a potion. You have to kind of be communicating in a circle what's going on.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Maybe a Final Fantasy AR game.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:22.000
That would be awesome. I'd be down for that. Final Fantasy XI AR.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
I did a level five by myself.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Did you?

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.000
Yeah, I've done a five by myself, but that's as high as I've gone.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:34.000
But what happens when you do it with multiple people, the difficulty really starts to go up.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:39.000
And that was Alan's first time playing. Alan was the fifth, and he was gaining levels from just doing that.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000
We should try to do one.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
It's fun. There's one not far from here.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
I know. It's where the gym is.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Yes. Exactly.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Actually, I have all three by my house. I have a greenhouse, an inn, and a tower.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Yeah. So anyway, looking in chat, Act F saying, if it was shiny, they would have said it in the announcement. True. I know. I know.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.000
I'm still excited for Armored Mewtwo. Yeah, it'll be nice to have that in the collection.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
I don't have Mewtwo at all.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:15.000
I really feel like I've been slipping on Pokemon Go. I've been terrible on gifts, and I just haven't been playing it as much because when I have my phone up and open, I'm playing either Ingress or Harry Potter.

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.000
I haven't been playing it as well either very much.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:26.000
And honestly, I haven't really been doing the gifts, but I haven't been wearing my gacha recently. I know it's probably pretty dead right now.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:32.000
But I think if I start doing running again, then I'll probably play it a bit more.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:38.000
But it's just, I don't know. I just haven't been motivated to do it. I don't really want to.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:46.000
Yeah. I mean, the Armored Mewtwo will be motivating for a day or two until you catch it, and then it'll be like, all right, back to trying to level in Harry Potter, I guess.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:53.000
So, yeah. All right, moving on. Just one more story here before we get to the classic soundtrack of the month.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:10:00.000
And this one is about kind of a last minute change. Last week, we had talked about, I think in rapid fire news, we talked about games that were coming out on PlayStation Plus.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Pro Evo. New.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Pro Evo was supposed to be one of the games, as well as Horizon Chase Turbo.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:11.000
They did a last minute sub out. Pro Evo Soccer did not end up being one of the titles.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:18.000
Instead, they added in the Detroit become human digital deluxe edition, which means you got heavy rain as well. Cool.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:24.000
So that was what they said. Yeah. I mean, honestly, I'm like, cool, because I kind of wanted to pick up this game at some point anyway.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:30.000
I'm sure a lot of people are like, not cool because we just bought it for like seven bucks in the sale recently or whatever.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Twenty bucks. But I guess that's part of the risk you take when you buy the games on a deep cut sale like that.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:42.000
But really, no word on why the sub out happened. It wasn't explained in the blog post.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:50.000
They didn't really. I mean, it seemed like the initial announcement kind of got a lot of people going like, boo, sports games, boo.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Because both end up, you know, racing and tennis end up being.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:00.000
I don't know. I don't really see racing games as like, sorry, why did I say tennis, soccer, sports games and that being sports.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Yeah, I don't know. It's fine. Some people play sports games. There's going to be sports games once in a while.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Heck, Rocket League is a sports game. That freebie ended up being awesome. So, yeah.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:16.000
I have that now. I forgot. I forgot all about that in my library of like nearly.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:20.000
It looks like your Steam backlog. Yes. It's pretty much. Yeah. But anyway.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:26.000
Yeah. Yeah. I don't know why they switched. And Konami says it wasn't them. Like some people were like, oh, it must have been.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:30.000
Fuck Konami. They must have been the ones that like pulled out the rug under it and done it.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Nope. Konami says it wasn't their decision. So maybe you'll see it in a future month. I don't know.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.000
I don't care because.

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:43.000
I have to say, I know some people that actually wanted PES 2019 for free.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Then again, I live in a country that loves football, real football. You play with your feet. Right.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:56.000
And then guys, you know, says, excuse me, Sony did it because if you read the forum, people were pissed that it was pro soccer.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:03.000
But pro Evo is cool. So fuck them. Plus, we had World Cup going on. Oh, that makes sense that it would be timed with the World Cup.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:07.000
I didn't think about that. You know, I know they've there's been a lot a lot of chatter about World Cup in the past few days.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:13.000
So it makes sense. Yeah, that does make sense. Don't want it. Don't want it. That's you.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:19.000
I only have one World Cup soccer that I'm into and it lives in my house.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:24.000
Although, go ladies. You know, I love those quotes that are going around.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Why don't they stop calling it women's soccer and just call it soccer, football, winning soccer.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:40.000
Right. Anyway, that's like that's like when we had the WNBA here in SAC, which I miss because it's like the only world championship banner that was hanging at the old Arco Arena was from the WNBA.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Whereas like I think the Kings had like a 1950s Kansas City, wherever they were at before thing hanging.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:53.000
That was it. It was like all the new stuff was because of the Monarchs and they get rid of the Monarchs.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:13:02.000
You know, I met a good number of them when I worked at a GNC back in the day. Oh, oh, yeah, really, really just great people who loved what they did.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:07.000
It's a bummer. I thought they were I thought part of them was bringing it back when they built that new arena and the new owner.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:11.000
But that new arena is weird, though. I still haven't been in it. I feel like I'm going to fall out.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:15.000
I still haven't been in it. I've been all around it, but I've yet to be inside that arena.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:21.000
I went with Becky to see Lindsey Stirling and we ended up getting preached at because apparently she's super Catholic.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Oh, it's like kind of ruined the show for me. And I hate Christmas music anyway, but I love Lindsey Stirling.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.000
And apparently I'm never going to go to another one of her concerts if she's going to preach during it.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Now, I would have been into Lindsey Buckingham seeing some Fleetwood Mac that I would have been into and they were there, too.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:46.000
But the tickets were crazy. All right. Anyway, let's travel back when, you know, concert tickets didn't quite break the bank as much.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:51.000
I guess maybe they've always broken the bank a little bit, but they weren't giving away games for free online, that's for sure.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:57.000
It's a trip back in time for the classic game of the week. But what a twist.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:02.000
In 2019, Dark Soccer says, you know, once a month I want to highlight a soundtrack.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.000
So we're going to look at the classic soundtrack of the month.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.000
So Dark Soccer, what did you pick for your classic soundtrack of the month this month?

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:13.000
I picked Quartet.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
How about this one? There we go.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:20.000
There we go. But the thing is, is it we can't turn it up, can we?

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:21.000
Not really.

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Well, now they don't hear it a little bit.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:26.000
The arcade music for Quartet is, of course, better than this,

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:35.000
but they did a really good job for a standard channel soundtrack for this game, for the Sega Master System.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:46.000
And of course, I mean, Quartet, this music has come back in the past few years because it was given lyrics via Hatsune Miku.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:50.000
So really, really good track, too.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:56.000
But anyway, Quartet, it's just one of those happy pieces of music.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.000
It was really catchy. You know, I'll be honest.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:05.000
Now, the version for the Sega Master System actually did not come out under the name Quartet.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:11.000
It came out under like a double target because you couldn't play for a player.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:15.000
It was only up to two players because of the limitations of the system.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:21.000
But just the music really just like made me happy, you know?

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:25.000
Playing through the game and you're hearing all this cheerful music while you're shooting aliens and shit.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.000
I mean, how much better does that get?

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:36.000
And the sound designer for this one was Hayashi Katsuhiro.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:46.000
And some of the other games that he did, he actually also did releases as Funky KH and Wooperkatsu.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:51.000
So some of the other games that he did was Galaxy Force for Sega Master System.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:56.000
He did the Hokuto no Ken game for Sega Master System, which was Fist of the North Star.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Fantasy Zone The Maze did Asterix and the Secret Mission.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:05.000
You know about Asterix, right? The Viking?

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Yes.

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:11.000
Global Defense, and of course Quartet here.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:18.000
And a game called Ashura, which actually came out as Rambo Secret Commando something or the other.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:27.000
But anyway, he's just done some really good games, including one of my favorites, Fantasy Zone The Maze.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:32.000
But did just quite a number of really good stuff for the Sega Master System.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:37.000
And even though the arcade version of this is just so iconic and so good,

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:44.000
I think for bringing it down for a Master System game that isn't even an FM-enabled soundtrack,

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
they did a pretty good job.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
So there you go.

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.000
Classic soundtrack is going to be Quartet for the Sega Master System.

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:55.000
And I have to admit, this is not a game I'm as familiar with,

01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:02.000
but in the little pieces that you sent along to be attached to the footage for Twitch Night,

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:06.000
I was like, again, for its time, really good.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Some of it is a little loud and shrill in the beginning if you're not used to hearing music in this era,

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:16.000
but I think it's neat. I like that it kind of has the different melodies and layers.

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:21.000
If you go back and listen, though, to the arcade version,

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:25.000
then that beginning of it will make quite a bit more sense.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Yeah, I'm going to have to do that.

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:31.000
But the arcade music is absolutely astonishing. It's so good.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:37.000
And then I know I've played for you the Hatsune Miku cover.

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:40.000
Yeah, and I have the Hatsune Miku thing on PlayStation 3.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
It's so good.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:47.000
At any rate, it's the Sega Master System soundtrack for Quartet.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Great pick. Classic soundtrack of the month.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:56.000
Sega Master System Quartet. Showing a little Master System love as well as the NES

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
and some of the other selections you've had earlier in the year.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:06.000
I'm going to have to. I'm sure the 5200 qualified as 8-bit. The Atari 5200?

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
I think so, yes.

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000
So I may have to go digging for a 5200 soundtrack.

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.000
All right, fun.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.000
We'll see what happens.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
All right. Well, they're your rules at the end of the day anyway.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Well, yeah, but I said this year is 8-bit. Next year is 16-bit.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
No, I get it. I get it. All right.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:25.000
So we're going to move on to our next segment, which was taped earlier today.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:31.000
While we take a quick break here in studio, we're going to take a little more of a deep look at Mario Maker 2

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:34.000
and look at some listener levels. So let's get to that.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:38.000
Hey, everybody. It's Rob in the office studio.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:44.000
And I thought for our break this week on OLR, we could take a look at Super Mario Maker 2

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:49.000
and actually looking at some levels that I put out a tweet that said, hey, if you're out there listening to OLR

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.000
and you're making levels in Super Mario Maker 2, you should send me some that I can play here.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
And then that way I can kind of show off the game a little bit

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:59.000
and how folks can go in there and look for different custom levels

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.000
and kind of what it looks like for some of you that may not have seen the game yet,

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
although I imagine a lot of you are playing it.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:11.000
So I'm going to start with this course today from Jay and Hawk, who sent me this course,

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
and it's called Dark Forest.

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:16.000
So classic retro. No gimmicks. Good.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:22.000
I didn't want to do the hell levels, so hopefully this will be a nice, smooth little level to check out.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Loki said he might do the hell levels later.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
You all should hold him to that.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Anyway, and you can notice here it shows you what the percentage is that's cleared it,

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:35.000
which only 30% have cleared it. I don't know. Maybe this is a little tougher than it says.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
And then you see a world record there as well.

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:42.000
So the fastest one gets saved, which is kind of fun, especially because speed running is all the rage.

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Plus, which is kind of neat, you can actually download courses.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:49.000
So if I actually wanted to save this so I could play it later whenever I want,

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:54.000
I could actually do the download, and that's part of the charm, I guess, of having it on the Switch,

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.000
that you can actually download levels to play again a little bit later.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:00.000
But anyway, I'm going to get in there and play this one.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
So it's pretty fast. It's going to download here.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:07.000
And you can tell it's going to be a retro level because retro Mario shows up, 8-bit Mario.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:13.000
And one thing I noticed right away, oh, this is kind of cool because it's a different type of background

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:20.000
you wouldn't put together with an 8-bit Mario game because part of what Mario Maker 2 has going on

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.000
is that you can kind of give some more themes to your different levels.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:31.000
So certainly this kind of dark forest, or for those that have been listening to OLR a very long time,

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:40.000
going into the dark black forest is not a theme we saw in the original retro Mario.

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:43.000
So that's kind of neat.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:47.000
And even though I've been playing this game a little bit this week, I certainly haven't seen everything.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:53.000
And I've been mostly futzing around in story mode, so I haven't really made my own courses to see what all is available.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Oops, look at that, just as fast as I got that guy, I lost the fire.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Okay, the ice makes things tricky.

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:09.000
One of the fun parts of Mario Maker to me was always to see, oh my god, I'm a moron.

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:13.000
I slipped, my finger slipped, I swear.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:20.000
One of the fun parts of Mario always was to me just kind of getting to see what some of the newer stuff looks like,

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:24.000
but in the old 8-bit retro style.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:27.000
Oh good, I'm not the only one that got suckered right there.

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Okay, wow.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Wow, wow, I should have just called this Watch Rob Be Terrible at Mario.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:39.000
But you know what, it is harder to talk and play at the same time.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:46.000
I challenge you guys to do it, because I have to keep talking, because I don't want the podcast people to be bored while I'm just sitting here playing.

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
But I also have to kind of focus on the game.

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Oh, I almost got thwomped right there, but I got around it.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Okay, this time I should be able to keep the fire.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:57.000
Yes, that will work much better.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.000
So there's the lesson learned, at least.

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
Okay, and this time I should be able to...

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Yes, there we go.

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.000
Making my way up.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:06.000
Oh, there we go.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
So we hit the top of the forest now.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
Kind of a very different scenery.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
So obviously with all these little piranha...

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Well, they're not really piranha plants.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
The metal plants?

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:19.000
Different types of piranha plants? I don't know what you call those.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:23.000
But with them all sitting there, you can't just walk across that.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Good, more fire.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:31.000
If all else fails, use fire, right?

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
Okay, so I think...

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Ooh, there's some bullets here.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.000
A free one-up to make up for the ones...

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:41.000
Oh, I hate those hammer guys, but luckily he was...

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Oh, look, another one-up.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.000
It's rain one-ups.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Okay.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
I'm greedy, so I want to get some of these coins,

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
but I also don't want to get hit by the bullets, so okay.

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Hopefully I knocked that piranha out.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Okay.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Oh my god! Oh my god!

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Oh, no!

01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Saved!

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:03.000
Clutch, hacks.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Oh, I fell.

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:10.000
Okay, for those on the podcast, I fell in a one Mario body-wide thing of water,

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:14.000
and luckily I was able to slam the A key fast enough to keep myself afloat.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
Oh, that was nasty.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.000
That was nasty.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:18.000
But yay, I did it.

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.000
I did it.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.000
Good course.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Oh, my green screen is terrible.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Sorry, guys.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Different colors set it off.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:25.000
But that was good.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Yay.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:27.000
So I'm going to say I like it.

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:30.000
I was only about 30 seconds off from the record there,

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:33.000
and I can actually leave my own comments, so I think I will do that.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
I'm going to leave a comment.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:38.000
And what's fun is that they have different stamps this time,

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:41.000
so it's a little different than the Wii U version

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
because you can't just put the stamps anywhere,

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
so they just kind of have these cards.

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:49.000
So I'll just do the Princess Peach because we all love Princess Peach.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
Cool idea.

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000
And it was.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:57.000
I liked that it was a very retro, kind of easy thing that fit a few things in there.

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
It was a good little warm-up.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:02.000
And it wasn't too easy because it had some nasty parts that got me

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:05.000
and almost once again at the end there, so nice.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
All right, so I could play it again if I wanted to,

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:10.000
or I can exit and pick a different level.

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:13.000
So I'm going to do that.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:17.000
And so what I'll do is I'm going to go to ID,

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
and I'm going to search for another level.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:24.000
So another code that I got was for our pal Bobby Blackwolf.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:28.000
So he gave me his code that I'm going to put in here right now,

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:31.000
and I'm sure he wouldn't mind if you want to play his level as well,

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:35.000
R0T V21 R5G.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:39.000
And I've got to see this because he calls this level Flappin' Mario.

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Oh, he's got a lot of people that have checked this out. Good for him.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:47.000
Not inspired by anything, just Mario going for a leisurely swim.

01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000
And there's a lot of comments. Dang, Bobby.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000
Bobby went viral with this one.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
All right, well, let's check it out.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
So this is a Mario 3D World.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:59.000
So Mario 3D World is kind of the new addition to Mario Maker,

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:03.000
is that you can actually have the cat Mario and all that too.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.000
That's kind of fun.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:07.000
Oh, my. Wow.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:11.000
Okay, I was not expecting the speed.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
Oh, it's an auto scroll. I see.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
So that's where the...

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Okay, I thought it was just going to be kind of free floating through the level.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:23.000
But it has little applause effects too.

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Love it.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:29.000
Wow, all these people putting stamps going. Be careful.

01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:30.000
Okay.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.000
So, yeah, if you get trapped behind a pipe, you are...

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000
Oh, oh, how about that?

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:40.000
He put some rewards at the end here to make that a little bit more worth your time.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:44.000
So, yeah, people are actually stamping their comments throughout the level too.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
Pretty cool.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:51.000
I like this. See, that's cool because it's like...

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:54.000
And this is a lot of what we're going to start seeing in Mario Maker 2.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:57.000
And we were seeing it in the first game quite a bit already.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:00.000
And seeing a little big planet as well,

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:04.000
is that I'm giving you this particular kind of toolbox to use.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:07.000
What are some different ideas that you can come up with?

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:12.000
And so the fact that, you know, it wasn't like necessarily a Mario level,

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:15.000
but with something kind of inspired by something else,

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000
that was pretty cool.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000
So I got to hand it to Bobby Black Wolf.

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000
That was a pretty neat level.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000
Yeah, and I'm fast forwarding through all these comments.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000
He's got a lot of people, cool ideas. Nice.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000
Hell yeah.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000
Nice. Good job, Bobby.

01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.000
So I'm going to say I like it.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
As tempted as I am to hit the boo button and be a jerk.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:33.000
I'm not going to do that.

01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:36.000
And then I will also leave my own comment.

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Let's see, what can I leave?

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
I'm going to leave one that says,

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000
I'll leave the beat it because I beat it.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Nice.

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:50.000
All right.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
So there's a couple of custom levels.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
And just before I wrap this video up,

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.000
just to show you a couple other things,

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.000
in the course world here in Super Mario Maker 2,

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:02.000
you will notice that you can actually look.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:05.000
Oh, I got, actually you'll notice I have this little wardrobe over here.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:08.000
So it looks like I got a new shirt because I've played a variety of courses.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
I can actually change my outfit and shirts.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Who knew shirts could be animated.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:13.000
So that's a thing.

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.000
So I guess I got I got this new shirt.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
I like the animated one that I got a little better.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.000
So I'm going to stay on that.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:23.000
And I had the skirt on because I thought it was cute.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:27.000
You know, gender is merely a suggestion when it comes to dressing up.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:30.000
But if I want to, I could put on shorts or whatever.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.000
But I'm going to stay in the denim skirt for now until something better comes along.

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.000
I also love that you can put on like baby clothes and stuff.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
That's like very, yeah.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:42.000
And then you can change your expression as well in there.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
So it's pretty cool.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:48.000
And you can also, you know, you can do network play with others.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:52.000
You do the endless challenge where it just keeps downloading level after level after level.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
And then, of course, you can see leaderboards.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:58.000
So if we wanted to see like what are the big levels right now in the game,

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
there's these course makers.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:05.000
But then I think you would also go to, where's the one where you see like the levels?

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000
I thought there was one for levels.

01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.000
Maybe not.

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:12.000
Maybe you just see the makers.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Because then the players will just show you how many they've done.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:16.000
I love that.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:19.000
The first person has 6969.

01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Great.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.000
I thought there was a way where it would show you courses as opposed to just the course.

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
Oh, hello.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.000
Hello.

01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:30.000
So you've got to go to the courses menu, not the leaderboards.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.000
There we go.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:36.000
So right now I'm on like start because these are other levels from my friends of mine and stuff.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:40.000
And then you can go to hot courses.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:44.000
So these are, I guess, up and coming ones or ones that were recently published.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.000
And then probably popular courses is going to be where all the, yeah.

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:52.000
So these are the big courses that are going on right now,

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:56.000
including this one from Super Mario Brothers 3, which looks like it's just some snowy slide.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:57.000
All right.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.000
I got to check it out.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:01.000
I'll check it out just a little bit real quick here and then we'll wrap up here.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:06.000
So this is an idea of like what is super popular in Mario Maker 2 right now.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:11.000
So.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.000
Okay.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:13.000
So you get a little power.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
Well, everybody, this course is so popular.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:21.000
People are leaving their own course codes at the end.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:22.000
Okay.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:23.000
So it was just that snowy slide at the beginning.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
People are leaving all these hints.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:27.000
Go up.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.000
I can't go up.

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:29.000
I need to.

01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.000
All right.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:31.000
I guess I'm going in the pipe.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:32.000
Yay.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.000
Another slide.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.000
And jump.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.000
Slide.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.000
Jump.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:37.000
Slide.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Oh, fireworks.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.000
Festive.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.000
Yay.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:43.000
I got one up.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:48.000
Music's all chipper and fun.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.000
Okay.

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:52.000
Oh, I probably have to slide.

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:55.000
And let's see.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:56.000
It says don't go down.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:57.000
All right.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Wow.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.000
Everybody's ruining this with their hands.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.000
Now, yes, you can turn those off.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:02.000
I just chose not to.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
Don't go down there either.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
Wow.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:16.000
The Internet's just telling you how to do it.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
Go here for a one up.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:19.000
Wow.

01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:22.000
This is like easy mode when everybody tells you how to do it.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.000
Okay.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.000
Wow.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:29.000
Then it gets all Silent Hill on you when you get on this little ramp going up.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.000
Okay.

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:33.000
I don't know why that happened.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:38.000
Oh, gosh, darn it.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
Oh, no.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.000
Okay.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:47.000
So you kind of have to do this ramp.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Land here.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
It's fun.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:59.000
So this is definitely just like doing slopes, jumping.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:04.000
Oh, and they use kind of the switches to move you one way versus the other.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:07.000
That's pretty clever.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000
How about that?

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:10.000
Okay.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:14.000
I can see why people like that one because sliding down hills is fun, clearly.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
So says the Internet.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:19.000
And I could leave another comment on top.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000
Can I even leave a comment?

01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:28.000
They're like, I'm going to say beat it and see that.

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.000
Oh, it did post it.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Maybe it just rolls off over after 99 comments.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.000
It just kind of rolls off.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.000
The next one goes on.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:35.000
There you go.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.000
All right.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:37.000
We'll wrap up with that.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:40.000
So we had two listener levels and a popular level.

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:41.000
At least what's popular right now.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000
Sliding down snowy hills.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:44.000
Sounds like a plan to me.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.000
Anyway, that's going to do it for our little break segment this week.

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:51.000
And we're going to go back live now to the studio.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000
Thank you, me.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:54.000
That was fun.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.000
Mario maker, too.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Yeah, I just love seeing the stuff that people come up with, especially like the really outside the box type of stuff.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
And it just seems like there's more to play with now.

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:07.000
Mario maker, too, that every new tool you give people, you're going to see all these different types of levels with it.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:12.000
Like, I really thought that was clever in that last level I played that, like, you had to go through it one way.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:13.000
It was kind of like a figure eight.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:14.000
You had to go through it one way.

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:15.000
The switch kind of made you do that.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
And then you got to the top, you hit the switch and you go the other way.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:18.000
That's kind of neat.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:21.000
So I'm looking forward to being able to do like more multiplayer.

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000
Like, I know that's something we're waiting for the online.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.000
I didn't explore that a lot yet in the game or in the video.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000
So there's still more to do.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:30.000
But yeah, I enjoyed those levels.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.000
Thank you.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:35.000
Thank you to those who submitted over on Twitter.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:40.000
And yeah, thanks for watching me play the popular levels, too.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.000
All right.

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000
Let's get back into some more news.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000
Getting into some rapid fire news tonight, Loki.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:46.000
Yes.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:47.000
So this is pretty awesome.

01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:55.000
They have a HD remake or HD master of Donkey Kong Country Returns.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:33:03.000
Unfortunately, it's only on the Nvidia Shield in China, which you may remember the Nvidia Shield in China has been getting some Nintendo games.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:07.000
So they've had some older Wii games that were available on there.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:10.000
So you have Legends of the Twilight Princess, Super Mario Galaxy.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
I'm sorry, is the IQ.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
No, it's an Nvidia Shield.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:17.000
OK, but I thought that that also is what worked on there.

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:19.000
I might be getting confused with something else.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.000
Yeah.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:23.000
So they have over there in.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:35.000
In China, they have these Wii games that are available and they run really well, like 10 AP 60 FPS, which begs the question, why are they not on the switch?

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:41.000
Because the Nvidia Shield is part of the same chipset as the Nintendo Switch.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000
You should be able to do it.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:46.000
But for whatever reason, it's not available.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:55.000
So I'm sure there's fun workarounds to get that available onto your own Nvidia Shield if you have one of those.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:34:03.000
But it's pretty neat to see that they've got this remaster completed, which is a matter of actually being able to play it.

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:10.000
But something that you might be able to play pretty soon, though, is actually some of these games that are available for free with Twitch Prime.

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:20.000
So funny enough, like I know that they used to offer games and I thought all that stuff was available through like the little dropdown that we have in Twitch here where you can see the Prime loot.

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:24.000
But I guess have I been missing games for the last few months because I haven't seen games in there.

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
It's always been different other things.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:31.000
And then finally, I went to the actual Prime loot.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
Yeah, they have like a page for the games as well.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:36.000
And there's like several games on there that I could get for free.

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:41.000
So one of those games on the Prime loot page is actually Yooka-Laylee.

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:48.000
So you can actually get that right now if you go to your Prime loot page, which I know a lot of you guys that are listening have Twitch Prime.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
So it might be worth checking out.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
And then that's going to be available.

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
And also dropping your free sub on Fog Network.

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:55.000
Add that in there.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Yes, of course.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:59.000
And then, of course, these are going to be available until August 1st.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000
The other games that are available on there as well.

01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:05.000
The Escapists for the King and Cultist Simulator.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:08.000
So go check those out now because they're free.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:09.000
And free is good.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000
Well, free if you have Prime.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:12.000
Right.

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Totally free.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:14.000
Yes, I get it. I get it.

01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:22.000
Hey, so another game that many of you I think have played is Cuphead.

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:26.000
And you're probably waiting the DLC that they're working on for Cuphead.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:29.000
The Delicious Last Course, which I love that because it's DLC.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:30.000
It's cute.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
Unfortunately, it is going to be delayed a little bit.

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
They are delaying it until 2020.

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:38.000
But what's interesting is that part of the reason that they're doing it,

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
co-director Chad Moldenhauer said, quote,

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:48.000
the development of the original game taught us a great deal about the importance of making things in a way that's healthy and sustainable for our team.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:54.000
So part of the reason that they're doing this is so that their team doesn't have to crunch so hard to make it by any other frame.

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:55.000
So, you know, good.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.000
So it's all right.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:01.000
We'll wait a little longer for it and it'll hopefully be that much better for it.

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:07.000
Something that's getting patched a little sooner, a patch, not DLC, but a patch is Bloodstains Switch version,

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:11.000
because apparently there are some issues where I'm kind of even I was kind of commenting on that earlier.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:15.000
I'm like, graphically, it just feels like something's a little bit off.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:20.000
But apparently the switch is going to be getting a patch.

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:26.000
The ETA for that right now is July 15th to fix a graphical bug in the game,

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:32.000
as well as some bugs featuring HD rumble, random crashes and input delay.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:37.000
The chest bug problem will also be worked on for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:41.000
Those patches will be coming out very soon if they're not already out.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:44.000
So it does seem like they are continuing to work on and improve the game.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:50.000
So I guess that's a good thing, you know, even though they worked for a very long time on it.

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
But, you know, it's it is what it is.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:56.000
It was a small team and they didn't have a whole lot, you know, a whole lot of resources.

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:59.000
So, you know, they did what they could in the amount of time.

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:02.000
So I'm glad to see at least they're not just like walking away from it,

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:05.000
that they are going to continue to improve it, especially on the switch.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:08.000
So, you know, and dark soccer, what do you have?

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:12.000
Sorry, I was just buying ukulele, getting ukulele.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:15.000
Taking that tip right now. Yeah, pretty much.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:19.000
So Squenix, we love Squenix.

01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:24.000
They are releasing a Chrono Trigger orchestral album.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:30.000
It looks like the release date is going to be looks like August 7th.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:37.000
There's another one that says October 27th.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:40.000
Just looking at the cover on here.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:44.000
But the standalone album will be $30, but the box set will be $74.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:49.000
So, yeah, it launches on September 7th, 2019 and then there are going to be concerts.

01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:50.000
So those were the dates.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:55.000
September 7th, 2019 and October 27th, 2019 in Tokyo.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:38:01.000
No, sorry, the first one is in Osaka on September 7th and the second one is in Tokyo October 27th.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000
So someone send me a plane ticket, please.

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:09.000
And then last but not least, there will be a Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3 The Black Order

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:13.000
and it's going to be part of the Marvel Games San Diego Comic-Con panel.

01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:24.000
So they will be having the panel at SDCC this year on Thursday, July 18th at 1.30 PST.

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:30.000
And it's said that they are going to be showing all the versions, including the Switch.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:31.000
So there you go.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Apparently, they're also going to have a few other goodies announced there.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:39.000
So, hey, I was hearing some stuff that maybe the new Avengers game is going to have a little more as well.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:42.000
So I'm not excited about that.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000
I love Ultimate Alliance, though.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Yeah.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
I played the shit out of that game.

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:51.000
Actually, I learned about the series through Tiara.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:56.000
She came she was visiting one time and we played the stew out of it.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
Oh, have you come to join us, sir?

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
We have we are joined by a smoosh.

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:04.000
Yeah, but sadly, Mr. Smoosh is in elevated, so they can't really see.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
Oh, he's he jumped up in the guest chair.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:09.000
Is that so I could scoot the chair over.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.000
I know, right.

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
He'll jump out of the chair when you do it.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Yeah, I guarantee it.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:19.000
He's he's looking for a way up on the kitchen counter because that's his new favorite place to hang out.

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000
Well, maybe I'll do it.

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:24.000
Check at Pitittles on Instagram.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:25.000
That's Midna's Instagram.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:28.000
P a t i d d l e s.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:29.000
There will be pictures of the smoosh.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:30.000
Yes.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:33.000
And technically Mr. Smoosh has his own Instagram as well.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:36.000
So, yeah, but I got you on your followers.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:37.000
It's fine.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:38.000
All right.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:46.000
All right, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates as we travel around the world and check out what's coming out in the US, Japan and the UK.

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:47.000
Yes.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:52.000
So we've got Senran Kagura Peach Ball coming out on Nintendo Switch.

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:58.000
We've got Umehara Kawase Fresh on Nintendo Switch.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:09.000
Dr. Mario World on iOS and Android and Blazing Chrome on PC, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and PlayStation four.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:13.000
And it looks like a side very.

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:14.000
I have no idea how to pronounce this.

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:17.000
You can't have this big consonants in a row.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:25.000
Sive Varia Delta that's on Switch and PlayStation four and Tiny Metal Full Metal Rumble.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:30.000
That's on Nintendo Switch and PC.

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
And then I believe this is still this week.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:35.000
Dragon Quest Builders two on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation four.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:38.000
And finally, God Eater three on Nintendo Switch.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:39.000
That's it.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:40.000
All right.

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Busy, busy traveling over to Japan.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:45.000
PlayStation four is a little slow this week in Japan.

01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:51.000
The only releases are like some deluxe editions that are coming out for Assassin's Creed origin as well as Far Cry five.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:55.000
Those are the really only the releases on the PlayStation four in Japan this week.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Nintendo Switch.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
A little more hopping.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
God Eater three is released this week.

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
Also on July 11th.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:03.000
Puruchara Friends.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000
Hoppy Chan to Sanrio characters.

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:09.000
I can only imagine that is the world's cutest.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:12.000
When are you going to start doing Japanese release dates?

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
You know what I've offered.

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:18.000
But it means it's and so it's Hoppy Chan and Sanrio.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
OK, I got it. I got it.

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:24.000
So it's a crossover festival thing.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:30.000
You get to oh, they take care of your town and you have all these accessories and patterns and things like that.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.000
Well, that sounds like fun.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000
Yeah, sounds very vaguely Animal Crossing ish.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000
It does, but it doesn't kind of look like that in the screenshots.

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:36.000
I think it's kind of a different sort of thing.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:41.000
So anyway, there's some other releases as well.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
No, actually, I lied.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
That's really a God Eater three is kind of a big release there.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
So that is it for Japanese releases.

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:48.000
How about the UK?

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:49.000
Dark soccer.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:50.000
That's soccer.

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:51.000
Sakura.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:52.000
Sakura.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:58.000
Anyway, coming out on the 11th for Switch, we have God Eater three.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:02.000
Also on the 11th, we have Dragon Quest Builders two and Dragon Quest Builders.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
Oh, we have the PlayStation and the Switch version.

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
Sorry, they did them separately.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:10.000
Also, Hollow Knight on July 11th.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:13.000
And that's it for this week.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:16.000
And guess what?

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
We still ain't got any mail.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
I checked.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:21.000
I'm not slacking.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:25.000
Yeah, it's been a little slow and there's not even now there's no drag race to talk about.

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:28.000
So now what are we because drag races is out of season.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Well, I can talk about meeting Evie Oddly.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:31.000
Okay.

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Make it quick though.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:33.000
Make it quick.

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:37.000
I was I was down for Drag Con and we were going to see the Belay Brothers Big Drag Ball event.

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:44.000
And coming out of some SUV is this person in a bear kigurumi.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:48.000
Lo and behold, it's Evie Oddly in full face wearing a bear kigurumi.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:49.000
The end.

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:52.000
I will say drag related.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:43:00.000
I what came up on a Facebook memory recently is when I shaved the last time I shaved my beard was a year ago because I performed

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:05.000
Mrs. Peacock in a local production of Clue the movie on stage.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
But that was so I really hope we get to do it again.

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:10.000
I thought they were going to do it again this year, but they opted not to.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
What if everyone did Grease?

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:13.000
Who would you want to be if you did Grease?

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:16.000
Grease is difficult because it's still it.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
Well, no, it still is a play.

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:21.000
So it's a little harder to get the rights to do something like that because they want you to do the play.

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:22.000
What about Grease 2?

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
No, Grease 2 would be different.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:25.000
Oh, that would be God.

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:26.000
I've seen that movie so long.

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:27.000
Would you want to be Frenchy?

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.000
Maybe.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:29.000
Or would you want to be Michelle Pfeiffer?

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:32.000
I think I would rather just kind of host it and not be in it and watch it.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:35.000
You should come out just in drag as a pink lady.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:36.000
OK, sure.

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Why not?

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:38.000
You should do it.

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:39.000
It'll be fun.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
We'll put you in a ponytail with a full beard.

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:42.000
Back into some gaming news.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:43.000
Loki.

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:44.000
All right.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:51.000
So apparently the developer of Alan Wake has been able to acquire the series back from Microsoft.

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:58.000
So Remedy basically noticing that for the first half of the year period of 2019,

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:09.000
Remedy Entertainment PLC records approximately 2.5 million euros of royalties from its previous release of games as a one-time income.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Those royalties are paid to Remedy during the second half of the year period 2019.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:19.000
In relation to this, the publishing rights of Alan Wake games are reverted to Remedy.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:26.000
This one-time income does not include or does not significantly affect Remedy's full year result.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:37.000
Because as previously reported, the company continues to invest in developing new games, the success of which will have a greater impact on the company's full year revenue and result.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:43.000
So it's cool that they get it back and maybe we'll get some more in the series.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
And it sounds like they're working on some new stuff.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:49.000
So, yeah, I mean, I thought they were going to do an Alan Wake sequel at some point.

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:53.000
I mean, there was the American Nightmare kind of spinoff thing, and I thought they were going to do a full sequel at some point.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:57.000
But they ended up canceling it, and some of the ideas or whatever ended up in Quantum Break.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:02.000
So I don't know if maybe this whole, like, they're getting it back might be a way for them to tackle that sequel again.

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:05.000
I don't know. I would love for them to do another Alan Wake game.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:09.000
But Alan Wake also, you want to talk about a game that took a long time to make?

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:13.000
That Alan Wake game was announced as a launch title for the 360.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:17.000
It didn't come out for, like, four years after the damn console was out.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:21.000
So if they want to do something, it's going to take them a good long time to work on it.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:25.000
What this would mean, though, is that they could release, like, an Alan Wake remastered for PlayStation 4 or something, or Switch.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:26.000
Yeah, that'd be cool.

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
That would be interesting.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:32.000
So, hope they can retain all the music rights, though, because they have some great music stuff in it.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:39.000
So, all right. Yeah, and this 200 Matt in chat says that Blair Witch game that was shown at E3 looks so much like Alan Wake.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:44.000
Yeah, that was, when that first came up, I was like, wait, are they doing another Alan Wake game?

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:48.000
Like, when I first saw that, I was getting, and then it started to get a little too violent.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:51.000
I was like, I don't remember Alan Wake being this gory.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:54.000
And so I was like, I don't think it is. So it was something else.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:57.000
So, excuse me.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:07.000
So, moving on to a story about Zelda Breath of the Wild's sequel, which I know a lot of you are very excited about, including Present Company.

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:14.000
Apparently, some hints, some big hints out there in job listings.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:24.000
Some recently posted Japanese job listings for Zelda Breath of the Wild are posted for a terrain designer and level designer.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:31.000
Apparently, yeah, because they're hiring for these things, it's looking to be that there may be a little bit of a bigger deal.

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:39.000
There is standard information on all the postings, but apparently the terrain designer will work on things that are, quote, field dungeons.

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:44.000
And the level designer will do, quote, game event, dungeon, field planning.

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:49.000
And then the level designer will also work on creating and tweaking enemies as well.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:57.000
So, yeah, I mean, the original Breath of the Wild kind of had those divine beasts, and then they had like those very small little temples.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:04.000
But it would be very interesting if the concept of dungeons from like the original Legend of Zelda, if you will, you know, like nine dungeons or whatever.

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
It would be interesting if that might be something that takes place in the sequel.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:12.000
It makes sense, though, because the game will, the whole thing starts with underneath Hyrule Castle.

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:18.000
And those, the area, I mean, if you watch through the trailer, they were in a big cavernous underground.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:23.000
So it would seem likely that a dungeon, I mean, they've already kind of teased it.

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:29.000
Yeah, and Dark Tetsuya says in our chat room over Twitch TV slash VOG Network, that was my most wanted thing.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:34.000
Having it open world like the first game, but actual dungeons this time.

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:35.000
So, yeah.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:36.000
It would be pretty cool.

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:37.000
It would be cool.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
And I would really like it if your save file carries over.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:45.000
Because then, like, you know, perhaps it like affects how you work with Zelda, for example, if you've got all the memories or not.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:50.000
Or if you just, you know, bed run right up to the end and she's like, do you remember me now?

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:51.000
Sorry, princess.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
Excuse me.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:54.000
Zelda will remember this.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:58.000
I actually would rather play a Zelda with her magic.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:03.000
I do hope they make it so that you can kind of control different characters. I mean, that'd be very cool.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:10.000
It makes me think that she would be playable because she has short hair and it's easier to animate shorter hair.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:11.000
We'll see.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:12.000
So, anyway.

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:13.000
All right.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:16.000
Well, Darsar, you have a very kind of interesting different story for us.

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:20.000
I do, because, you know, I like to throw on the other angles of video gaming.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:24.000
And how better to do that than talking about African swine fever?

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:28.000
African swine fever has a lot to do with video games, don't you think?

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:29.000
Okay.

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:34.000
The African swine fever, there is outbreaks in Europe and Asia.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:40.000
And the disease is actually making farmers kill a lot of their pigs.

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:45.000
And it's driving up pork prices for those who are of the pork consuming persuasion.

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:50.000
So American farmers are pretty much afraid that the disease is going to pop up here.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:57.000
Because there was a different virus back in 2013 that spread through 33 states and wiped out 7 million pigs.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:00.000
Which was 10% of our nation's swine population.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:03.000
So how are they trying to combat this?

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:06.000
Believe it or not, biosecurity is a thing.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:16.000
And the University of Vermont is now using video games to predict how human behavior impacts animal disease outbreaks.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:20.000
And it's a $7.4 million biosecurity initiative.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:21.000
Right now.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:29.000
And they are using this to generate projections that would benefit the agriculture industry.

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:35.000
So basically they would track pig diarrhea virus through the farms.

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:44.000
But then, and one of the researchers named Gabriella Bucchini says, what happens on a farm doesn't stay on the farm.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:47.000
But then they're going to use this.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:52.000
And one of her other quotes on here says, once you learn how people behave, the next question is how do we apply this to a larger system?

01:49:52.000 --> 01:50:05.000
So their data, they're having players go through the video game and make decisions about how much they were willing to risk to expose their herd to basically what farmers face on the daily.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:10.000
And they were simulating how the disease would spread if it were introduced.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:21.000
So they're using the combination of human interaction as well as swine interaction to see how humans affect the spread of animal diseases.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:26.000
Shehulk10 in our chat quite simply says, science and games are fun.

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:32.000
True. And I just think this is such a good application for it because you can have people involved in it.

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:37.000
And it's really a very experimental game. But then again, how many people sit and play Harvest Moon?

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
True.

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:47.000
Now Questbuster in chat took the words right out of my mouth because I was thinking of this exact same thing while you were talking about that with the diseases and all.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Questbuster says, reminds me of when World of Warcraft's blood plague event that ran out of control was actually studied by scientists.

01:50:54.000 --> 01:51:01.000
I was thinking of that too because I think there were a few papers in epidemiology posted based off of that.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:06.000
It was fascinating how some people would really try to run and hide to get away from it.

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:11.000
Some people were running into populated areas just to purposely spread it and kind of like how the human...

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:14.000
I think I had stopped playing right before that went on.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:17.000
That happened at the end of vanilla.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
But I played vanilla.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
I played vanilla and I hated it, remember?

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:22.000
Oh yeah, yeah.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:23.000
Because I hated all the weapon grinding?

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:24.000
Yeah.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Isn't there like another expansion out now because I'm not playing it?

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
Like the Rise of Azshara?

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:35.000
They are on, oh god no, I think they're on Legion and then Battle for Azeroth is the one I'm on right now.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:38.000
Because I think they were teasing the Rise of Azshara.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:39.000
That was a patch.

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:40.000
A patch, oh whatever.

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:41.000
Yeah.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:45.000
Ikuma JP says, next zombie pigs.

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:50.000
Zombie pigs versus war pigs and they play that album.

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:54.000
Well I'm glad this wasn't just a story about like, does Stardew Valley prepare you to be a real farmer?

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:59.000
But I'm sure even games like that they learn things from, you know, just to get about how people play them.

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:05.000
Well and the next evolution of this is taking it from game to a true sim.

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:12.000
But they're doing this to get that human behavioral element to it that you cannot simulate.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:18.000
And so I think it's a really good way to get that kind of input from real life people.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:23.000
That you've got all across, you know, various skill levels in the farming and agriculture.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:29.000
And you know, a word I'm thinking of that also ends in culture that has to do with animals.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:32.000
I'll just say animal husbandry because it's fun to say that.

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:37.000
You know, but dealing with, you know, dealing with animals.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:40.000
So I think it's a really novel approach to it.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:48.000
And honestly I'd love to see other industries take the same route to see what happens when a human makes X decision.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:53.000
And then your projections go off of this continuously variable data.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:54.000
Right.

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
Because what gets more random than the human?

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
Ain't that the truth.

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
Some of us are just extra.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:04.000
VidPower in chat points out there's even a corrupted blood incident page on Wikipedia.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:07.000
It's that important to culture, I guess, if you will.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:08.000
Yeah.

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
All right. Well, let's move on.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
Loki, I think you're up next.

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:17.000
Yes. Let's talk about how the Switch Online has reached 10 million subscribers.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:22.000
So a lot of people are very interested in playing different games on the Switch Online.

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:26.000
And I'm sure a big part of that probably has to do with also Tetris 99.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:33.000
But of course, you know, you have other games in Mario Kart, Splatoon 2, the new Mario Maker 2, that type of stuff.

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:36.000
So definitely it's helped push it.

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:42.000
I can say that probably very minimally the NES library helped out with that.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:48.000
But we're not going to get into a whole nother complaint debate about, you know, what's offered there.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:51.000
I think the giveaway on Twitch was the biggest thing probably.

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
Yeah, that probably helped as well.

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:58.000
Plus being able to play games online. People want to play stuff like Splatoon and Mario Kart and that stuff.

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:03.000
So, you know, people probably just bought it so they could play online because you're used to doing it with PlayStation and Microsoft anyway.

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:12.000
Yeah. So, you know, basically they said, you know, the number of subscribers for an Nintendo Switch Online has increased steadily since the service was launched last September.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:15.000
And it has surpassed 10 million accounts.

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:22.000
You know, we recognize that making a Nintendo Switch Online service attractive to users is extremely important.

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:32.000
And we will continue to make the content of the service even more appealing going forward with vague promises and no sort of information whatsoever.

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:38.000
So we shall see what they mean by that, if it's anything.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:52.000
All right. Well, one thing that I guess they're trying to get people interested in with the Nintendo Online is more events for Tetris 99 to get you to come back and play that one if you're not already a regular player of Tetris 99.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:55:00.000
Tetris 99 is having its fifth Maximus Cup from July 12th through July 15th. So it's next weekend basically.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:08.000
And if you earn a hundred points during the cup, you will unlock a prize, which is a Splatoon theme for the game.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:14.000
Because there was a classic theme I remember previously. Now there'll be a Splatoon theme. So I'm sure it'll kind of turn the Tetris music into that.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:23.000
Like it'll kind of sound like Splatoon music at that point. So that'll be fun. Maybe like a Ska remix or something will be fun.

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:32.000
Anyway, the event has been confirmed for Japan and North America. It has not been confirmed for Europe yet. But why would they be left out? That would be kind of shitty.

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:38.000
So we'll see. But anyway, that is coming up this upcoming weekend. I'm sure some folks will be playing on that.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:44.000
Also, another DLC pack on the way for Tetris 99. Because even though it's free, they can still get you through the DLC.

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:50.000
The second DLC will include offline multiplayer. And that will be out before the end of the year.

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:56.000
The developers behind Tetris 99 have said they are working on a mode that lets you play with friends and family offline.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:02.000
So if you don't want to have to be signed into the service, you want to just play with friends in the same room. Party mode.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:08.000
You know, because Tetris 99 doesn't really have any matching anyway. So this would be a way that you could control who it is you're playing against.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:17.000
So I'm sure there will be some desire to have that. I think it'll be really cool if it allows multiple people to play on the same screen.

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:25.000
Because technically you could have a pro controller, your two little baby controllers that sit on the Switch, Joy-Cons.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:33.000
You could maybe just, you know, excuse me, instead of having multiple Switches in the room, just have all these different controllers.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:37.000
I'm sure it's limited at some point though because of all the Bluetooth. I remember hearing that before.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:41.000
But be able to kind of play the game that way with a lot of people. Be fun.

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:50.000
ActDeft, by the way, says the Maximus Cup, Wyatt's Splatoon theme, is suggesting it's probably because of the final Splatfest for Splatoon 2.

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:57.000
The Maximus Cup is probably a crossover promotion for that. I keep forgetting, that's right, Splatoon 2 is ending those Splatfests pretty soon.

01:56:57.000 --> 01:57:05.000
That's kind of weird. Because I would have expected there would be a Splatoon 3 or something to look forward to, but they didn't do that yet.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:15.000
Anyway, that is it for the scheduled news that we have tonight, but we do open up our chat as well as our Discord.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:24.000
If you are on our Discord server at vognetwork.com slash Discord, you can head on over to the green room and we'll be fielding some of your calls here on air if anybody wants to call tonight.

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:29.000
I notice we just seem to have a lower viewer turnout tonight. I don't know if that's the holiday weekend or what.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
Stranger Things 3.

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:38.000
Oh, people binge watching Stranger Things 3? I'm through the first two episodes. That's as far as I got.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:47.000
But yeah, I want to watch more. Maybe I will after the show tonight. I just found out that the LARP is not doing anything tomorrow, so I'll be able to do real things.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:48.000
So that's good.

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:49.000
Slarp.

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:53.000
Or it's the Slarp. Slurp.

01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:57.000
Anyway, Bobby says probably people still out for the holidays. Probably.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:03.000
SG100Matt says I gave up on Tetris 99. I was getting wrecked too much and it wasn't fun for me anymore.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:08.000
And also saying I finished it this morning and I'm sure that's about Stranger Things 3. It's great.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:09.000
I would only get it for singleplay.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:13.000
AkumaJP says stop at Season 1. I like Season 2.

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:14.000
Season 2 was great.

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:17.000
Yeah, it wasn't as good as Season 1, but it was still good enough.

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:20.000
You know, Season 1 was all about Winona's crazy eyes.

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:23.000
Well, Season 2 and 3 are also about that.

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:28.000
Well, Season 2, though, really was like the strong.

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:31.000
Season 2 was all about Hopper dancing.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:38.000
Oh, you. It was for me. Oh, great. Now I can't think of her name. The teen girl.

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:39.000
Eleven?

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:40.000
No.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:41.000
No, Nancy.

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:42.000
Sam.

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:43.000
Nancy.

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:48.000
Oh, the one that looks like Jennifer Grey in Season 3. She looks just like fucking Jennifer Grey.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:49.000
Does she look like Jennifer Grey now?

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:50.000
Huh?

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
Before the nose or after the nose?

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
Before. In Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Before.

01:58:54.000 --> 01:59:02.000
Okay. Just because she makes me think, actually, of another Nancy. The one from Nightmare on Elm Street.

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:10.000
How she went from kind of meek and worried to just pretty much taking it all in her own hands and being a badass.

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
You know, taking on the big bad.

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:17.000
And also, she does look a little bit like Heather Langenkamp.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
Do you know I met Heather Langenkamp?

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:20.000
Really?

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:23.000
She was at the Sinister Creature Con. You know, I know the people that put that on.

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:29.000
And I was there because I was doing the same day I did the panel with Barry Boswick and Nell.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
She still looks the same, doesn't she?

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
Yeah, she was there signing autographs.

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
And remember, I don't really do scary movies.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:39.000
Of course I've seen that.

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:43.000
Of course I've seen that. But you know who do love horror movies? My husband.

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:48.000
So I went in line and I said, hey, so I actually want to get an autograph for my husband.

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:51.000
And, you know, such and such. He's a really big fan and watches.

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:54.000
So I actually got him an autograph and she was kind of like, you know, asking me some questions.

01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:57.000
I felt like a dummy because I'm like, I don't really want your movies.

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:03.000
I go, I mean, I think I saw it once, but I tried to just, you know, be nice and keep it about, you know.

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:08.000
I used to watch her in a show called Just the Eight of Us. I think that was the name of it?

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:09.000
Yeah, I remember that show.

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:12.000
She was the oldest daughter in a very Catholic family.

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:17.000
And wasn't it a spin off of not Family Matters, was it?

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:21.000
I believe you are mishmashing. There was a show in the 70s called Eight is Enough.

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:22.000
No, yeah.

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:23.000
And then there was Just the Ten of Us.

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:24.000
Just the Ten of Us. That was it.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:28.000
And it was a spin off of.

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
Crap, it was one of those shows.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:33.000
It was a spin off because they had the family.

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
The family was featured in like an episode. Yeah.

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:38.000
And then they spun off the show and I really freaking loved that show.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:41.000
But I was like, I watched it because she was in it.

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
And I just was obsessed with her hair.

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:51.000
I wanted her hair really because she had that hair that was not like not quite Brooke Shields hair, but pretty freaking long.

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:52.000
And I thought she was awesome.

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:56.000
But she still looks great considering when I saw The New Nightmare.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:01:00.000
I seriously didn't think she had aged hardly any.

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:06.000
So if she's still looking that good, she must have good genes and a good dermatologist.

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:07.000
Nice.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
Loki, do we have any last minute stories?

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:17.000
No, but I just noticed there's a game coming out that has to do with Ryan Toy Review, which my youngest son is obsessed with.

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:21.000
I'm going to have to fucking buy this piece of shit. I know it.

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:27.000
It's called Race with Ryan and it looks like a piece of shit, but it's like a YouTuber's getting a video game.

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
Yeah, YouTubers getting a video game.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:33.000
Oh, my God. He's got his own fucking toilet. This kid is fucking rich, man.

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
He's rich, bitch.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:41.000
So, like, he's got all sorts of merch and shit, but like, yeah, he's getting his own fucking game.

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:47.000
So the kid is like a one man, like PBS programming on YouTube.

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:51.000
It's not even it's just it's really him and his parents. It's his parents kind of pushing it.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:54.000
It's just him doing shit like most of it nowadays.

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
It's like, look, I'm playing with my own fucking toys.

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
See, you want these toys, kids. You want these toys.

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:03.000
But it's just him just going to amusement parks and shit and doing weird.

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
Why do you get paid to go to amusement parks?

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:09.000
I did an amusement park review once at VOG's YouTube channel.

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
You can still find it somewhere.

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
Yeah, you just have to...

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:17.000
One of the only times Shayne has ever let me put him on camera was for a Mass Effect ride.

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
Just saying.

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:22.000
So, I don't know. We just have to...

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:25.000
Hopefully, he'll never find out about this.

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:28.000
Unfortunately, he will find out about this because he watches this.

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:32.000
They'll feature it in the videos. You're screwed. There's no way you're going to hide it from him.

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:33.000
Damn it.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:39.000
All right. Well, if there's no last minute stories and I don't see anyone on the call on the phone,

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:42.000
I guess I guess we're almost wrapped up for the night.

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
It was kind of a shorter Newsweek, right?

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
So, yeah, that's what it is.

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:50.000
All right. Well, as I always say at the end of every episode,

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:53.000
if you enjoyed what you heard here at Orange Lawn Radio, help us spread the word.

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:56.000
Tell a friend or two about the show because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:01.000
But if the voices aren't here to air them, then how are we supposed to put them out there?

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:04.000
So, I hope everybody did have a great holiday weekend.

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
And we look forward to doing this all again next week.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
We should be getting some more gaming news next week.

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:12.000
And we're going to start what? Gamescom is not too far away.

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:15.000
San Diego Comic-Con. I think it was two weeks.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
But we'll have that and some of the tidbits coming out of that.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:20.000
And things are just going to start ramping up and up and up as we get closer to Labor Day.

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:24.000
Next weekend is also the big...

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:27.000
Comic-Con. There's also news usually at Comic-Con.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
Yeah. Oh, I guess that is this coming weekend.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:32.000
Or I don't know if it's this weekend, but it's soon, if not.

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:35.000
But then also, Southern Fry Game Room Expo, which we've been talking about, is this weekend.

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:39.000
So, who knows? Maybe we'll hear. Well, certainly Bobby will talk about it on his show and have some video as well.

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
Maybe he'll share some of that with us. I don't know.

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
I know he's going to have a very fun weekend there.

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:49.000
Oh, yeah, nssj100matt points out, we have Pokemon GO Community Day during OLR for West Coast people next weekend.

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:53.000
Yeah, it's frickin' like 4 to 7 o'clock, so we can't even do it unless we catch him on the house.

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:56.000
I'm actually going to be at the fair.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:05.000
So, for locals, next Sunday, starting, of course, from the fair opening to 10, is out at the fair.

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:08.000
So, it's going to be...

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:09.000
State Fair.

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
State Fair, yeah. And guess who's playing that night? I told you already.

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
I don't want no scrub.

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:14.000
Oh, is that that...

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:15.000
TLC is playing...

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:16.000
At the friggin' State Fair?

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:17.000
At the friggin' State Fair.

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:18.000
Oh, I thought that was his own thing.

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:22.000
That's why I was like, shit! I want to go! No.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
Because I don't want no scrub.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
That's a pretty big name for the State Fair to get.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:29.000
A scrub is a guy who can't get no love from me.

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:32.000
You know who else is going to be there? It's Martina McBride.

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
Oh, those are some pretty big names.

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:39.000
Yeah, and actually, you remember from the late 80s, early 90s, Tony, Tony, Tony?

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:40.000
Hell yeah.

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:41.000
They're playing.

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:42.000
Wow.

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:43.000
They're still around.

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
The State Fair always used to be at the end of...

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:50.000
It was like going into Labor Day, but they moved it four or five years ago to July.

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:51.000
I'm still not used to it being in July.

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:52.000
It's too hot, though.

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
That was always where I saw Weird Al.

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:58.000
Lately, though, it hasn't really broken 100 here lately.

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
It's been like 80s and 90s.

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
No, he's fine. He's fine.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:03.000
As long as he doesn't wander over to the...

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
As long as he doesn't knock over glasses?

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:06.000
Yeah, he'll be fine.

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:08.000
Yeah, I'm looking...

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
You can already see next Sunday's weather.

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:13.000
Okay, the high is 94, but it's not 100.

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:20.000
Well, at any rate, I'm going to be there in face because the sisters are doing...

02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000
There's actually a drag queen bingo earlier in the day.

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:23.000
Oh, fun.

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:24.000
But you're still here at the show, right?

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:25.000
Yeah.

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:26.000
Okay, good.

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:32.000
But the tickets are free for the drag queen bingo for actually reserving a seat for drag

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:33.000
queen bingo.

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:34.000
Oh.

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:38.000
And I may have deals on tickets with Monorail.

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:39.000
Fun.

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:40.000
I'll see if you want to go.

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:41.000
All right, we'll see.

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
I don't know what's going on next weekend yet, so we'll see.

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:46.000
I feel like I had something on the agenda, but whatever.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:47.000
Always busy, busy.

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:51.000
I might be thinking of the Southern Fried Game Room even though I'm not going.

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:54.000
I might just be thinking like that that's next weekend, but yeah.

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:55.000
All right.

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:58.000
Well, yeah, I guess we wrap up and get everybody's final thoughts.

02:05:58.000 --> 02:05:59.000
It's weird to be done so early.

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:00.000
Oh, no, that's as far as...

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:01.000
No, I don't want him over there.

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:02.000
Hold on.

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:03.000
I'll get him.

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:04.000
I'll get him.

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:05.000
You sure?

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:06.000
Yeah.

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:07.000
Okay.

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:08.000
He's just trying to cook himself.

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:09.000
He's trying to cook himself.

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:10.000
He's trying to cook himself.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:11.000

He's trying to cook himself.

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:16.000

He's trying to cook himself.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:18.000
He's trying to cook himself.

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:19.000
He's trying to cook himself.

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:20.000
He's trying to cook himself.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:21.000
He's trying to cook himself.

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:22.000
He's trying to cook himself.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:23.000
He's trying to cook himself.

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:24.000
He's trying to cook himself.

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:25.000

He's trying to cook himself.

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:56.000
He's trying to cook himself.

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
Um, let's get everybody's final thought.

02:06:58.000 --> 02:06:59.000
Let's go over...

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:00.000
Nintendo truck at the State Fair.

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:01.000
Geez, Kat.

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
Kat, you are going to get it.

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
Alright, as long as he doesn't go all the way over there.

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
He can stay there, but not over the other side.

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:08.000
He's always going to go over there.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:09.000
I know, I'm watching him.

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
Alright, let's wrap up the show so I can discipline the Kat.

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
Dark Soccer, your final thought tonight?

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
Um, I'm covered in the hair of two cats.

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:16.000
Really.

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
And my final thought is, see, he lied down.

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:19.000
That's what he wanted to do.

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:20.000
I'm going to take a picture of him.

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:21.000
That's fine.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:22.000
He just wanted to lie down up there on the counter.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
And, uh, Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:28.000
My final thought is, I'll hopefully play more games this week.

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:29.000

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:14.000
See you next week.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:47.000
Music.
