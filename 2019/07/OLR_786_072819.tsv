138420	143460	be like a three-year endeavor it looks worse on cam that it really is like I
143460	146260	sort it like it looks like it's just like completely bald on top but I do
146260	150980	have some hair it looks worse on cam I think but not but bald is beautiful so
150980	154540	I don't give a fuck so whatever it gives you an excuse to have interesting hats
154540	159140	too yeah it is I'd like the hats are a good accessory why not you you ladies
159140	163180	get to pick your purses that match well not that gender roles should define
163180	167540	anything but the majority of you know American culture is that you pick a
167540	172140	purse to go with your outfit why should I say queens yeah exactly right but if I
172140	175500	wanted to pick take a purse then god damn it I'm gonna take a purse exactly
175500	179660	all right bring back the murse all right anyway I had a murse we talked about
179660	184140	that another time all right anyway hello I don't mean to ignore Loki techmaster
184140	187900	Loki over there that's fine but you're equal number one I'm thinking you don't
187900	192060	have a lot to contribute to the purse discussion no and I can clearly see
192060	195740	you're over there catching Pokemon yes because apparently my house is a how hot
195740	201260	bed of Pokemon no just because I haven't done it in a while and because I don't
201260	205620	know yeah I'm out of the loop so you know to that guy that reviewed us on
205620	209580	iTunes saying they talk about nothing but Pokemon go those days are numbered I
209580	213860	haven't played some review I shouldn't even acknowledge the negative reviews
213860	217540	but it is what it is yeah yeah but you can always leave a positive review if
217540	220380	you want to offset that stuff for the record there's jack shit at your house
220380	229460	what they had a thing where you get you hatched or you get a dratini and then
229460	232580	you have to take a picture of it and then that picture got me one of those
232580	237420	smear goal things and so I had to catch that oh I didn't do that I caught a
237420	240140	dratini but I didn't take a picture of it yeah I've kind of fallen off the
240140	243060	wagon on this quest like I guess today was the in here we are talking about
243060	251020	anyway today was like that Team Rocket type of my game well they keep doing it
251020	254300	on Sunday night well I can hit it though before when I leave the house to come
254300	257740	here I can hit the pokestop by my house so here's the weird thing like so
257740	261860	Pokemon go gave my phone a new background I don't know why like it
261860	265980	changed my wallpaper did you tell it it could no it just did it like it crashed
265980	269940	the wallpaper is it a cute Pikachu no it's just like it's just like some pink
269980	274860	like looks like like a mountain range or something I had like weird it's supposed
274860	278300	to be a simulation of earth with like the lighting and everything and the
278300	281620	cloud cover is supposed to match with what the weather satellites are because
281620	287340	that's kind of cool and now it's gone all right whatever background on y'all's
287340	290700	phone I have a picture of mr. smoosh on my well you can't see it right now
290700	294140	because I have apparently Twitter alerts that are in the way oh because that's a
294140	297180	good thing because y'all are promoting the show tonight because I barely did
297180	299860	but I have a picture of mr. smoosh is the background of my phone you guys
299860	301980	probably can't even see it from that far away but that's what I have I try to
301980	307700	take a picture of a dratini to see if that would count and it doesn't you can
307700	312060	turn off the AR thing and and it's a lot easier to do pictures and so I wanted to
312060	317020	take the AR because I did it on top of my macbook and it's got your knee in the
317020	321740	picture oh my sexy knee I'm sure I'm I'm being a little bit of a that neither
321740	327660	tonight by showing off my knees that knee uh-huh all right anyway it's hot
327660	331140	today I can't how could I not wear shorts everybody's wearing shorts
331140	336380	because it's 106 today here in lovely Sacramento where we're based the ambient
336380	344260	temperature coming off of my car when I got in it was 115 Wow right well all
344260	347980	right anyway let's let's talk about the weather more talk about games and dark
347980	351900	soccer you braved the weather this weekend because you went on a road trip
351900	357660	off to San Jose right I didn't brave the weather I left it but so tell us a was
357660	361060	like it didn't get any hotter than like 88 you know that's that's typical Bay
361060	365940	Area but anyway tell us about California extreme it was the thing I go to every
365940	370940	year basically in a nutshell California extreme is a big gaming Expo where they
370940	375900	have like a huge ballroom full of pinball classic games music games and
375940	380980	they've got a big candy cab section now the Japanese style cabinets and then
380980	384780	they have like a whole other room now that's just like a big meeting room
384780	389060	that's also full of games and then they have a vendor room upstairs with a stage
389060	395540	to do rock band kind of how allowed did their thing and then you know classic
395540	400460	consoles also set up up there so it was really good it goes on for two days I
400460	404120	forgot what time it opens I think it opens at like 9 or 10 but it goes to 2
404160	411480	in the morning on Saturday and then Sunday all day and people you know bring
411480	416760	their own machines some people sell them there Stern has a big presence and I
416760	423720	twice ran into Steve Ritchie and he's like oh hi cuz you know we're Facebook
423720	429680	buddies it's funny yeah and he was I was like let's get a picture together he's
429680	434400	like I got to go take my pills I'm like okay Steve he's not a chicken of the
434400	438240	spring anymore but he's he's just a good guy he and his wife are the nicest
438240	446560	people you'll ever meet but they had all kinds of really good games which I could
446560	450960	go ahead and do now and get my gaming week out of the way for everything I
450960	455240	played yeah well I was hoping there might be stuff outside of for that but
455240	459920	oh sorry well no I hardly played anything outside of California stream
459920	462640	except for the usual we'll get into a little bit of what you what you played a
462640	466900	California stream then okay so I played Black Knight Sword of Rage which was
466900	470800	amazing as always and if you were ever gonna buy a Black Knight Sword of Rage
470800	475520	get premium don't get the pro the premium that brand new table yeah maybe
475520	482000	three months old they had the miss pac-man mini like the cabinet that's
482000	486260	like like a two-thirds my height but there's like those arcade one-up
486260	489880	machines yeah I think that's what they were interesting I didn't I'm surprised
489880	493200	that those are kind of yeah those have an interesting place in this day and age
493200	496600	right because like I would think in some ways those might be frowned on because
496600	501240	they're not authentic miss pac-man's but they sure do give a fairly authentic
501240	503920	experience with the screens the screens really a big difference like you can
503920	507520	really notice the screens on those arcade one-ups are not the same thing
507520	514480	you remember playing oh really and then they had an even smaller one that didn't
514480	517960	look like it was in the same thing so it could have been custom but it was an
517960	523000	ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 so that's some interesting ones ones there they didn't
523000	526640	have any of like I mean those are almost like the junior size one but they didn't
526640	531080	have the junior size Neo Geo you know I bet that arcade one-up company was
531080	534760	probably like advertising there actually they probably had some type of deal to
534760	537500	have their machines there because that is the perfect crowd to be selling the
537500	542620	those things to you know classic arcade game fans with disposable income that is
542620	545140	like that is their crowd so I wouldn't be surprised if those machines were
545140	550900	there because like arcade one-up kind of wanted them there and they did have from
550900	557360	what I could notice fewer of the pinball and arcade board vendors and more of the
557360	562800	classic video game vendors although I tried to find Saturn and turbo graphic
562800	568120	stuff and they were very sparse they still the place that I buy from tiny
568120	572160	potato I really like those guys I hang you know hang out and chat with them
572160	578280	every year but they have a copy of cotton for PlayStation that I would
578280	584760	really like to buy but it's 90 bucks I keep waffling on it you know but I mean
584760	588080	it was really a fun time all the vendors were really nice everyone was really
588080	591680	friendly and chatty and one of the vendors watched me open a couple of
591680	595520	blind boxes cuz he went in I said he's like can I predict him first I'm like
595520	599240	sure so he shakes the two of them I grabbed like the dig dug blind set which
599240	601960	you could get one of three characters so you know he had two out of three choice
601960	607760	like this one is a puka and this one is the I always forget the name of the
607760	611960	dragon the fry gar fry gar is like this one's a fry I wanted to say that's a
611960	616680	video game cuz the game rygar yeah I was thinking rygar and I was like so he
616680	620480	shook him is like this one's a fry gar this one's a puka so when I opened them
620640	624560	one was a fry gar one was a puka I wouldn't have minded a dig-dug but I
624560	630720	like having the baddies so they're cool and pukas are cute but at any rate I
630720	635120	they really they were missing some stuff this year just some things that I
635120	639140	expected to be there this year that were not there were lots of panels Steve
639140	647960	Ritchie did a panel about developing Black Knight there was one about DJ max
648280	653960	oh wow yeah 730 and I I didn't go to it cuz I was hanging out with melody but
653960	660560	Mel went to it which by the way preview preview we may have Mel on yeah yeah I
660560	663720	heard yeah he was thinking about is he gonna come up here we doing something
663720	668200	awesome I would love to have love to have him back on the show talk about the
668200	676600	have a DDR night infinity stage yeah that he's gonna be working with but you
676600	680400	know there was a pretty decent music game section but they didn't I was
680400	683320	looking for a couple of things they didn't have it although they did have
683320	688240	that nostalgia game by Konami that looks kind of like a keyboard but not really a
688240	692400	keyboard I think I know what you're talking about it's it's a newer game
692400	697840	right yeah yeah I think Musica which I finally got to play it was fun they had
697840	703360	my my do you know what my my is uh yeah circle that's got the button yeah
704040	711240	pattern I played that and it had an oppa oppa song so I was very happy I'm not
711240	714640	great at it you know it's just my first time playing it but I think I did okay
714640	723360	so as they had a bunch of DJ max though they had some you beat they had a couple
723360	729480	of the bishi bashi so that was pretty fun they had a real prop cycle another
729480	734320	prop cycle Adams family they did had an Adams family though but you know there
734320	739360	was there were certain the blastroids that used to belong to us was there so
739360	742560	it was pretty funny dance like I'm gonna go see our blastroids but anyway so what
742560	746560	I played there was I played Black Knight Sword of Rage I played the Miss Pac-man
746560	751120	mini I played Pac-man and chomp chomp which is a very weird little more recent
751120	757560	Pac-man game JJ squawkers which thought I played Sonic the fighters I played
757560	763160	azumanga daioh puzzle bobble so it's basically puzzle bobble with the girls
763160	767800	from azumanga daioh in it so easy peasy I played my my I played virtual on
767800	771960	oratorio tangram which was really fun they were in the Japanese cabinets and
771960	775500	they were back-to-back and I was just trying to play through you know the
775500	779520	story mode and this one person just keeps challenging challenging chill I'm
779520	783360	like I was just so stubborn I was like I just want to beat you and be done and
783360	786720	you kept doing over and over and like six games and I'm like okay I'm done and
786720	790600	I just let him win you know I just ran in with the sword and it's like if you
790600	795720	can beat me at close range then you win and so I walked around and just poked
795720	800240	him on the shoulder I was like good game dude and he's like it's a girl you know
800240	806940	like the total it's a girl look like a girl speaks to me pretty much like the
806940	811120	ending of Metroid for the very first time yeah but I played Dodon Pachi I
811120	814800	played Big Bang bar so they had a Big Bang bar but it was I think it was a
814800	821200	repro because the glass on it they played Musica I played some regular old
821200	823680	pac-man but it wasn't one of those I forgot what they're called like the
823680	829180	marquee cabinets the the narrower ones with a smaller screen yeah I know what
829180	831240	you're talking about but I don't know the name call them something and I
831240	835920	remember did if you bring up pac-man did they have my all-time fave baby pac-man
835920	839360	I didn't see baby pac-man I would have played the shit out of it I saying for
839360	842840	those of you that go Google baby pac-man if you don't know it cuz baby pac-man
842840	845920	the reason why I love that game so much I remembered as a kid it is half like
845920	850040	pac-man arcade game but then there's a point where when you go out the tunnels
850040	853960	you don't like warp to yet well you do when you go out the side when you go
853960	857160	there's tunnels in the bottom and when you go out the bottom tunnels you drop
857160	862320	into a pinball board and so it's half pac-man half pinball and it's so cool I
862320	864880	didn't play journey either because apparently the joystick was a little
864880	871800	messed up but I also played you know crazy auto which was a kind of backwards
871840	881400	retheme of miss pac-man because miss pac-man started life as a pac-man like
881400	885040	expansion yeah I was like a pac-man plus and they were gonna release it under the
885040	888920	name crazy auto with a walking character and everything and then you know Namco
888920	894120	and shit happened and miss pac-man I also played a Beatlemania pinball and I
894120	899240	played the Sega Tetris that's got the big fat blocks like you only have like
899240	905000	ten block spaces to work with it's kind of hard but it was really fun I really
905000	910160	enjoyed it and there was also you know there was a few others a bunch of cave
910160	918240	shooters like mushihime sama and and what was battle garega
918440	922520	what else did I play no it was do don pachi that I played because I love that
922520	927640	game but yeah they just had all kinds of neat stuff I mean there were there were
927640	932240	a bunch of you know the street fighter ones like starting from third impact all
932240	937560	the way up through five they had an arcade machine for five and they had
937560	943000	multi blood you know just all kinds of neat import games over in that area so
943000	946720	it was it was really neat you know just a fun time and hanging out with my
946720	954400	friends and you know ran into Bradley like you do and I played with the
954400	958160	toddler what kind of like vendors were there cuz aren't there usually like
958160	961040	around the edges of the rooms there's like some vendors selling like classic
961040	964560	arcade things like what did you see there was like one DIY vendor outside
964560	968120	doing like etched glass and there was another one inside also doing etched
968120	974840	glass like for mugs and shot pint glasses and shot glasses and then you
974840	978520	know I said there weren't so many we pinball part vendors like there were in
978520	983140	previous years Marco pinball of course is one of the sponsors with Stern for
983140	988860	bringing in a lot of the because they have it that big stern section that had
988860	992900	like Black Knight Deadpool all of that and so they were selling parts and stuff
992900	998180	from Marco there was the shirt vendors for California extreme there were just a
998180	1003900	lot of like kitschy knick-knack II stuff for for the video game merch like the
1003900	1009300	blind boxes and Mario mugs and there was a doormat that I wanted one that says
1009300	1013100	welcome to Peach's castle it was kind of cute and they had like throws and
1013100	1017820	everything like blankets and this is nothing super exciting maybe you know if
1017820	1023240	I was trying to decorate my teenage bedroom that might be something or if
1023240	1027940	you know we start getting into decorating the game room or something it
1027940	1032500	was it was all nice stuff you know I got my two little things to put on my desk
1032500	1039500	at work and I got patches actually I got an Atari patch I got a mass link shield
1039500	1047340	the Hyrule shield patch and I got a a super mushroom because I'm gonna make a
1047340	1052100	patch jacket so fun you need to get some of those old-school Activision
1052100	1056220	achievement patches for your jacket I'll see I would love that I would look so
1056220	1059100	many issues reprose there's got to be reprose of that I would love to get an
1059100	1061820	awesome jacket with like all the Activision badges I think that would be
1061820	1064860	cool yeah that's got to be like an Etsy or something one of those things I wish
1064860	1069300	Activision themselves would do it though you know because they as much love or
1069340	1073260	hate Activision in their current state today for those of us that were you know
1073260	1077620	cool kid Atari 2600 folks like you know it would be it would be nice to you know
1077620	1081580	get our get our hands on some of that type of merch right oh so I did buy a
1081580	1086700	few things though oh yeah I bought the compact old-school Game Boy case it's
1086700	1093100	this well they can on the podcast anyway so anyway it's it's actually honestly
1093100	1097660	about the length of this microphone okay and it has enough space for they can see
1097660	1102700	mine it has enough room in it for a Game Boy on one side and then maybe like
1102700	1106540	four games total on the other I think I used to have one of those cases it's a
1106540	1110020	hard case and I was like I don't have a Game Boy to put in it we don't have an
1110020	1114260	old-school Game Boy anymore but I could make like a purse or something out of it
1114260	1119300	it'd be fun or you know like a first aid kit yeah you know I thought it would be
1119300	1123740	neat I only paid five bucks for it and then I got the Game Gear magnifier I
1123980	1128420	mean he wanted eight bucks for it but I actually got the two items together for
1128420	1131660	ten bucks you know cuz you haggle you haggle when you go to the classic gaming
1131660	1139540	table and then I got a game called air adventures for Saturn that I never
1139540	1143580	played but like they this one guy traded it in with a stack of other games and
1143580	1147380	when the fellow was looking it up it's like it was only worth the dollar I was
1147380	1151860	like I'll give you two bucks for it okay so I took it sight unseen two bucks
1151900	1156300	because it's another Saturn game and I thought it'd be fun to try something new
1156300	1163380	you know that hadn't played before and yeah I didn't really do like a whole
1163380	1166740	bunch of shopping in it my knee t-shirts you know but they had some fun little
1166740	1172140	stuff and I love blind boxes so I now have my poop puka and fry car you need
1172140	1176020	to you start a YouTube channel opening blind boxes do you know like how popular
1176020	1179900	those types of videos are yeah but these aren't it these are different than like
1179980	1185900	those little blind boxes the gift blind boxes it's people like order like the
1185900	1192300	Amazon returns or the blind boxes on Etsy or not Etsy but eBay you know those
1192300	1196620	are the ones that get money or the people who buy the storage units I know
1196620	1199220	let me ask you one more thing about California stream and then we'll get on
1199220	1202220	into the rest of our gaming weeks the type of stuff we've been playing but you
1202220	1205220	know you've been going to the convention for several years now what was your
1205220	1209340	favorite thing about the convention this year and well let's start there what was
1209340	1215180	your favorite thing about the convention this year um I don't know
1215180	1220980	just I guess more seeing my friends the people yeah that's fair that they
1220980	1223700	hanging out with nerds hanging out with nerds heck yeah that's one of my
1223700	1227780	favorite actually Dragon Con mag fest any kind of into the two things that I
1227780	1232060	heard the most that made me happy was one I like your hair and number two I
1232060	1236460	like your shirt I was wearing my crazy red shirt for Animal Crossing that says
1236460	1240580	seems legit oh I was gonna wear my chica shirt and I was like you know I'm
1240580	1242860	gonna wear crazy red it's a little a little bit bigger it's a little more
1242860	1246580	comfortable and everyone's like oh my god you're sure let me take let me take
1246580	1251380	a picture of your shirt okay and then I think probably the obvious follow-up to
1251380	1254340	that would be what would be one thing that you would want to see them do next
1254340	1262020	year that they haven't done yet I want or they're not doing I would like a
1262020	1268820	whole room of nothing but I'd like them to put the candy cabs and the Bahmani
1268820	1274500	the music games in their own room that sounds like a get you go you'd like so
1274500	1277780	much noise pollution though and that but I guess I guess if you set up barriers
1277780	1280460	the right way if you kind of thought it through there'd probably be a way to
1280460	1283420	make it a little more tolerable and the other there's actually one other thing
1283420	1290340	because I was when I was talking to tiny potato guys there they said that they
1290340	1294660	weren't given any lighting where they were so people couldn't they had to go
1294660	1298260	to Target and buy lamps and I was like you really need to take better care of
1298260	1302740	your vendors you know don't put people in dark little corners with no lighting
1302740	1306820	that's not fair to them if you were gonna have the vendors be in a place
1306820	1309740	other than where they usually are you need to make sure you have sufficient
1309740	1313820	lighting so that people can see those items and they're not wasting money
1313820	1317060	renting the space okay that's good feedback I think that's exactly the type
1317060	1319380	of thing I think would be good for them to hear but I think that next year
1319460	1323700	though I actually want to officially try to go as press next year I want to go
1323700	1328020	period because I've missed it so many years in a row but this is also you know
1328020	1331660	in generally like personally this is also a hard weekend so it's like you
1331660	1335940	know it's just just a bad time of year for it you know yeah but I'm gonna put
1335940	1339860	in for press next year you should so that we can go in and interview people
1339860	1343860	and do panels good panels yeah I get some of the get some of them for some
1343860	1346740	some break segments get some interviews that'd be awesome maybe we should even
1346940	1352100	like petition to do a panel you never know I mean at this point we would be a
1352100	1358940	classic podcast don't you think classic podcast they have games from 2002 in
1358940	1365100	there that are classic games I think there was there was also another game in
1365100	1369900	there I forgot the name of it but it was like the super field goal football
1369900	1374660	baseball mixture game it was kind of weird yeah Bobby and Chad is saying I'd
1374660	1377620	love to go to probably won't be able to swing it yeah I think him and I are in
1377620	1381220	similar predicaments as to why he can't come out here for California extreme and
1381220	1384420	why I can't go out there for the southern fried gaming expo which is
1384420	1389180	really it's really their equivalent is what that that show is so yeah but I
1389180	1394420	mean it's really it's really fun you know I had a great time like like I
1394420	1397780	said earlier I was toddler tired when I was done because I didn't want to stop
1397780	1404980	playing but I was tired was it that super slam-dunk yeah yeah we had that
1404980	1408380	guy on the show a long time because they were at gamer X yeah second or third
1408380	1413140	year yeah we had them remembered it but everyone in dance pinball group was like
1413140	1417140	oh it's so much fun yeah it's a fun game they had a killer be there it's been out
1417140	1423500	a while now that a killer be a killer Queen that was it which I still haven't
1423500	1427700	played that game but everyone says it's really fun so Bobby and Chad says yeah
1427700	1431460	the toddler tired thing is why I got a hotel room at southern fried so I didn't
1431460	1434260	have to drive home at night and yeah I think that's why I like a lot of people
1434260	1437900	like kind of even if the convention is like right by you you know a lot of
1437900	1441220	people if they have the income I mean certainly you know how much money you do
1441220	1444020	or don't have and are able to spend on that type of stuff plays a factor but if
1444020	1446380	you're fortunate enough to be able to swing it like I think a lot of people
1446380	1450740	are just like I'm just gonna plan to stay on site they're doing a big ingress
1450740	1454980	thing in downtown Sacramento on October 12th I'm considering getting a hotel
1454980	1457980	room in downtown Sacramento because of the whole toddler tired thing yeah I
1457980	1463940	need to get in on that information yeah you do you do come join us anyway all
1463940	1466900	right let's talk about the rest of our gaming weeks outside of the convention
1466900	1469540	of California extreme which I really do hope to attend next year and
1469540	1473020	congratulate those guys on their success because everybody I talked to that goes
1473020	1477460	loves it and I just it's just it's always like a bad like timing conflict I
1477460	1481140	think one year speaking of gamer X and the the game there I think one year it
1481140	1483980	was the same weekend as gamer X and that was an issue I think it was the year
1483980	1487700	gamer X was up in San Francisco tell me stream was like the same weekend I seem
1487700	1492100	to remember that was the thing that happened yeah yeah anyway um did you
1492100	1494700	want to add anything else to your gaming week our soccer outside of the
1494700	1499700	convention the usual phone games mm-hmm so that's it yeah and Pokemon go first
1499700	1504780	my phone today no it needs to stop doing that probably so many people getting in
1504780	1508800	on that event I guess which sadly I've just lost track of Loki how about you
1508800	1513700	how was your gaming week I didn't play a lot of games this week I played just a
1513700	1517940	little bit Pokemon go okay but you did something video game adjacent I know
1517940	1523540	because you invited me and I couldn't go so I played more laser tag again
1523540	1528520	actually so I went last night I tried to get a meetup group of people to go play
1528520	1531700	some laser tag I did have one of my friends show up with his kids so we
1531700	1536040	played for a little bit and that was kind of fun so he played that for a
1536040	1542160	while at the local place here then today I went to a not quite local place a
1542280	1546800	little further away to try out their arena and system stuff to see if it's
1546800	1551200	something I would like I was hesitant to go there because it's twice as much it's
1551200	1557520	very far away and I don't know I just had kind of a bad feeling about it and
1557520	1563600	when we got there and played it it was kind of jank a little bit the arena is
1563600	1568000	nice and I like how some of the features that they have are kind of remind me of
1568240	1574880	cues are but it's the guns themselves were really tiny and they force you to
1574880	1579400	push like two buttons on the side in order for you to actually be able to
1579400	1583600	fire the gun so you have to hold the two buttons on the side because they always
1583600	1587560	want to make sure they using two hands whereas the place I play over here they
1587560	1590880	have an optical sensor so you put your hand on the bottom and it detects it's
1590880	1594440	there you don't have to hold some stupid buttons so forcing to hold those tiny
1594440	1598600	buttons actually cramps the hell out of your hand and doing that even for just
1598600	1604280	20 minutes I was like fuck this place I'm not coming back here but I do want
1604280	1608640	to check out all the places in the area so I played most of them now but then
1608640	1613440	ended up driving back over here playing a couple games so it's fun I keep
1613440	1617440	playing in it and I tried to actually have some footage shot I got one of those
1617440	1621120	action cameras I just don't have the right settings on it right now so it
1621120	1626040	came out really grainy and dark because I have to adjust some of the settings on
1626040	1630560	the camera which is unfortunate because I had some pretty good games there but
1630560	1635280	it's hard to see what's going on and I had it mounted to my head instead of
1635280	1640200	like on my shoulder or something like that and it's just really hard to see
1640200	1645040	kind of what I was doing you kind of miss a lot of it so I'm gonna try it
1645040	1648360	again at some point I may actually pick up another camera to try to maybe mount
1648400	1652200	one to a gun mount one to my shoulder or something to get some footage because I
1652200	1658560	think that'd be really cool but yeah so I've been playing lots of laser tag so
1658560	1662960	I used to play a lot of laser tag way back in the day and it definitely still
1662960	1665560	shows I like that you're having like your midlife crisis where you're
1665560	1669440	rediscovering it all over again it's not that I have never like not like I know
1669440	1673600	wanted to if like if a Q's are were to open up tomorrow yeah I'd be playing
1673600	1676640	there all the time well you're going to this new place a lot which is pretty
1677480	1682760	cool and it's see it's like I'm so torn because that place like it has a decent
1682760	1689160	arena it has decent gear but the people that run it are just not great they
1689160	1694280	they're just like it's you can tell that they're minimum wage kids that just
1694280	1698400	don't care about being there and I get it you know it's a job I worked the job
1698400	1703280	at a laser tech place before so I understand what it's like but like they
1703280	1706600	don't know anything that's going on there like they have stuff that they
1706600	1709640	advertise the website like about like a membership that you can do so you get a
1709640	1712960	membership you give your own like call sign or whatever and you can scan it a
1712960	1717120	card on the mission on the actual gun and it'll pop up like your name instead
1717120	1720360	of the names that are on the guns normally and then also you like
1720360	1724840	accumulate points towards something that happens like I think you select like
1724840	1728360	exclusive weapons and stuff like that which is kind of cool so I thought oh
1728360	1731120	yeah I'll do that for myself and my kids because we've been playing here for a
1731120	1735600	few times and I go and ask them today about it because it is is literally one
1735600	1738680	of the tabs that's on their website is membership it says ask us when you come
1738680	1742640	in I'm like okay hey what about that membership thing how do I get and you
1742640	1746560	sign up on that they're like I don't know what you're talking about like okay
1746560	1751400	and in like the last week when we went to like we did they're like three hour
1751400	1754480	thing where they're supposed to have pizza they're like pizza didn't arrive
1754480	1757840	on time and they're like well we don't know where it is you can tell it's just
1757840	1761040	not very professional with the kids right but like I met the owner last
1761040	1765000	night and you know he obviously knows what's going on he has another arena in
1765000	1769920	San Francisco as well and he commutes up here to run it sometimes but like he was
1769920	1777160	dead it was dead on a Saturday night and that's not a good sign it's not a good
1777160	1781160	sign they don't have anything in their lobby like it's just empty they have
1781160	1785400	some ticket redemption games and like even today like when we were leaving
1785640	1788800	there was I don't know what it was it looked like a rehab group or something
1788800	1792320	like that but a bunch of old dudes and looks like some other people with like
1792320	1796600	uniforms on that like we're taking him in a van back somewhere I don't know but
1796600	1801160	okay I assumed it was like drug rehab or something like that and so they were
1801160	1805080	taking him back and they gave us like a big thing a big stack of tickets so here
1805080	1809120	you go you know your kids can get some of the prizes here and he had like
1809120	1814280	shitty-ass it's all like even like even all the tickets this is just shit it's
1814320	1817880	this absolute shit let me get some chat comments over at twitch.tv slash vogue
1817880	1823040	Network VG realness says if laser tag is dead on a Saturday night it won't be
1823040	1827600	around much longer yeah and I know and it's it's really comes down to location
1827600	1831960	and advertising I've been to places I know it's in a business park which is a
1831960	1835600	it's it's it's a business park but you can see it from the road so that's good
1835600	1839280	at least but I've been to another laser tag place that was also in a business
1839280	1842960	park and it just didn't last because nobody knows where it is and so look for
1842960	1846320	and there's no advertising they don't have much of a social media presence
1846320	1851120	there's no advertising whereas the other place I went to today definitely you
1851120	1855040	know a lot more popular lots of people there but they have they have their way
1855040	1861080	expensive they have more of an arcade they have like some bounce house shit
1861080	1866240	that's there that really I wouldn't pay any money for that and they have their
1866240	1869960	only cafe so they're definitely set up to kind of run a little bit better of an
1869960	1875080	operation but this place it's it's struggling and what they talk about like
1875080	1878560	let me get let me get some other comment sorry I asked you 100 mats is giving you
1878560	1881920	photo advice saying the camera will give you a lot of grainy footage in low light
1881920	1885940	but yeah if you mess with the aperture or shutter speed and the video noise it
1885940	1888720	will look better obviously more light would fix it but you can't really do
1888720	1891580	that in the laser tag arena yeah at night vision will look good but the
1891580	1895000	strobe lights mess it up Bobby is talking about the business park thing
1895000	1898240	saying most escape rooms are in a business park and they do fine around
1898400	1901600	here last night we just do one last night and it's way far back in a
1901600	1905040	business park and it was pretty hopping yeah those escape rooms everyone that
1905040	1908640	I've been to is in like a business park too but they advertise they get out
1908640	1913040	there they do stuff online and like they really they could utilize like print
1913040	1916200	advertising I think would really help them like a mailer or something like
1916200	1919120	that so people know they're there only reason I found them is because I was
1919120	1922120	searching for laser tech places in the area like I wonder you know where
1922120	1926500	haven't I been yet and I was like oh this one's I didn't even know this was
1926500	1930380	here you know and so I found it that way it ended up being pretty decent it's
1930380	1933980	just they need them they need to get in touch with an arcade vendor to put some
1933980	1937500	arcade games in that damn thing because they're pushing like on their birthday
1937500	1940740	packages oh yeah you can get like additional tokens and stuff like that
1940740	1945520	but to play what there's like literally nothing there like I I'm gonna at some
1945520	1949100	point film some stuff and like put it up I thought about like reviewing laser tag
1949100	1952640	places I thought that'd be kind of fun at some point so as soon as I get a
1952640	1956680	camera set up to do that because only we had a camera in our pockets that goes
1956680	1961120	with us everywhere we go well you know I do but like I'm talking about my action
1961120	1966000	project of it yeah so I do want to do that because if you it would be fun to
1966000	1970840	go out you know review a bunch of places and stuff just from a perspective of
1970840	1976200	someone that played a lot of laser tag and so yeah I'm having a lot of fun with
1976200	1979160	it I just wish I wish there's more people there because really on a
1979160	1983040	Saturday night there should be quite a few people or even like during the day
1983040	1987360	like when we went there last week there was birthday parties going through and
1987360	1991920	it was pretty good but like this week there there's no one there you know and
1991920	1995480	Kai's you know had made a funny comment earlier to saying you can play laser tag
1995480	2000760	in your house in VR on psvr rec room and VR laser tag is a good plan B when the
2000760	2004840	places are not popping true but it's just not the same thing it's like it's
2004840	2008880	like saying you know you can play a football game on your you know Xbox or
2008880	2013880	you can go play football for real it is and and I like you know I like the games
2013880	2017240	where it actually feels like their skill involved in it like the first one I play
2017240	2022120	the reason I was not really attracted to that game at all is because like I can
2022120	2026040	tell I can hit I'm a pretty good shot with hitting people in games I used to
2026040	2029320	bounce shots off walls and stuff like that and do all sorts of crazy shit
2029320	2033480	because I believe you know I've played several thousand games of laser tag and
2033480	2039400	I you know the place I play now it's just you know I can hit people just as
2039400	2044160	well as I could before and cues are this other place we went to today those guns
2044160	2048800	I swear to God fucking suck like I could not hit shit with those guns and
2048800	2053720	it's definitely the guns because like you're aiming straight on the person's
2053720	2058200	just like standing there and you just can't hit anything with it and it's just
2058200	2061320	the equipment it really sucks because it's good for like if you just have a
2061320	2064400	bunch of kids running around they don't give a shit you know then that's fine
2064400	2068280	but like for someone that actually wants to play it you know and actually get
2068280	2072360	good at it and play it with people that want to play competitively you can't
2072360	2075360	when it's just like it's fucking random that your shit's gonna work or not so
2075360	2078900	anyways that's enough talking about that that's fine moving on to my gaming week
2078900	2082400	so as you guys know after last week's show was a shorter show because I went
2082400	2086960	to Chicago on business for the week so I was out of town Monday through Friday
2086960	2092360	so that really kind of put a cramp or in my ability to do gaming but I did
2092360	2097560	play a shit ton of Mario maker 2 on the flight and you might wonder how do you
2097560	2100480	play Mario maker 2 and your RNA have played easy I was playing the single
2100480	2103040	player campaign pretty much the whole way I was yeah I mean I'm sure there's a
2103040	2105840	lot to play there yeah there is and I'm probably I'm still only probably about
2105840	2110360	like 50% of the way through because I'm very stubborn and I refuse to use the
2110360	2115040	tools that will help you get through like if like if you die twice then the
2115040	2118840	little Luigi bag comes up and says do you need help dummy like it doesn't say
2118840	2121720	it that way but that's kind of like fuck you Luigi I don't need your fucking help
2121720	2125800	so and as you know and I realize some people probably take full-on advantage
2125800	2129020	of it right away and that's fine play games how you want to play games but I'm
2129020	2131760	like no I'm gonna be a little more stubborn I really want to see because
2131760	2134960	you know I feel like I make progress every time yeah and there were some like
2134960	2137880	it's not just like you get this assortment of levels but then if you
2137880	2142000	kind of like explore around the castle there's like this dog that offers you
2142000	2145280	levels underdog or whatever offers you levels too and his levels can be really
2145280	2148560	hard so I feel like in some of those levels I like make a little bit of
2148560	2151920	progression every time so you know if I have four hours to kill on a flight I'm
2151920	2154800	fine with you know trying to make a little bit I wish they have like you
2154800	2159600	know advanced tutorials in those games it's a new dog all of the likes you
2159600	2162920	know advanced techniques like the shell jumps and stuff like that that you see
2162920	2168080	like speed runners and like kaizo runners dudes like yeah say how do I get
2168080	2171640	good at that stuff or let's not even let's let's step back let's not even go
2171640	2176880	to good how do I do that I would say I'm like half only halfway through the
2176880	2180520	campaign and I think I've had to play like 25 levels and then some to you know
2180520	2185520	so there's a lot of levels in there to play so yeah I was I was plenty fine
2185520	2188000	entertained with Mario maker 2 and single-player modes that was pretty much
2188000	2193240	like my flight I did I watched a movie as well but then on the way back the
2193240	2197520	frickin like the headphone jack and the little TV didn't work so I was gonna
2197520	2200280	watch another movie but it couldn't I couldn't do anything so I was like I
2200280	2203320	just played that and then I played bejeweled on this because that you know
2203320	2207120	how the airplane things seat backs have games on them I don't know I just played
2207120	2212400	bejeweled on the on the airplane so there was that because there's so few
2212400	2215240	cell phone games that'll work when it has to be an airplane mode you know so
2215240	2219800	so that put a cramp in my gaming week except of the survivor LARP I'm sure
2219800	2222880	you're all ready for updates on that right because I was able to play that
2222880	2227000	and that was very intense a lot's been going on so remember my game started
2227000	2232360	with 22 people so the 10th place person was just voted out tonight there's nine
2232360	2237440	people left and I'm one of them and they announced tonight that we are all the
2237440	2242760	finalists and the jury so there's so I've at least made the jury so for those
2242760	2246920	of you that watch or follow survivor you know that like that's a big like
2246920	2251520	accomplishment you're in every episode at that point that's yay so that's
2251520	2254400	that's kind of that's kind of good I mean obviously I can't again I don't
2254400	2257760	know who's watching so I can't talk a lot about the strategical stuff all I
2257760	2265600	can say was that today was like a big day so yeah it was a lot going on so you
2265600	2268200	know it's getting more and more intense do you want to see what we had to do
2268200	2271280	for the last immunity challenge our first individual immunity challenge
2271280	2274020	would you all like to see it sure last week you guys got to hear about the
2274020	2277360	talking thing right yes now I'm gonna show you a physical one so because this
2277360	2280400	is a physical one for the sake of the podcasters could you guys narrate what
2280400	2288480	I'm doing please yes okay all right so it's cup stacking you're doing cup
2288480	2296440	stacking okay stacking cups so he's gotten small end with the big end on top
2296440	2301440	and then big end so it looks like an hourglass and then he's taking it and
2301440	2309880	flipping it over sideways holding it together so he's holding it that way
2309920	2318440	how long did you hold it yeah without using glue it's it's it looks
2318440	2322000	deceptively easy doesn't it because the first time I know that's right they
2322000	2325760	explained it to us I practiced it and I was like this is much easier than the
2325760	2330000	last cup stacking thing we had to do this is fine but you know it's about the
2330000	2334640	small so I went for about 15 minutes and my understanding is the person who won
2334640	2340640	immunity went for about 28 minutes and basically what happens is that as you're
2340640	2343400	kind of holding it and because you have the again for the podcast listeners you
2343400	2346280	kind of like if you stack four cups but you do them inverted each time so you
2346280	2348880	have like a big and small and big and smallest so you kind of do it that way
2348880	2352480	and then you flip it over it is supposed to be inspired by an actual survivor
2352480	2355480	challenge that was on the Micronesia season season which was the last
2355480	2358720	immunity challenge which I believe is a similar thing they had to hold like a
2358720	2362600	stack of things horizontally that normally would be vertical that type of
2362600	2367880	thing so um and your forearms start to hurt after a while because what happens
2367880	2370800	is that if there's even the slightest movement in the cup which is what
2370800	2374520	happened to me about ten minutes in well I just had a movement I breathed wrong I
2374520	2378080	don't know one of my cups slipped just a little bit and so now you're pushing
2378080	2381960	together tighter because you're like shit they're not like the grip is kind
2381960	2384160	of gone so you have to move them together tighter and then that starts to
2384160	2388720	hurt your forearms faster and so it's very very interesting but I mean what an
2388720	2392440	easy what an easy little thing to do that kind of makes for an interesting
2392480	2397120	challenge but I think a lot of those type of online games have like minute to
2397120	2399960	win it I use it you remember that old game show minute to win it they have
2399960	2402880	those minute to win it style challenges so that was that was kind of what it was
2402880	2409280	so anyways SSG100Matt says is Rob gonna judge the fuck out of people
2409280	2411720	uh-huh especially if I get voted out uh-huh
2411720	2416320	Sia Tabiri says so are you gonna be the Thorgy who makes the right decision
2416320	2420000	absolutely I will make the right decision at the end of the game well
2420000	2423480	why y'all assuming I'm gonna be on the jury won't I be in the finals why are
2423480	2426680	you all quick to assume I'm getting voted yeah but no one trusts Thorgy
2426680	2431720	anyway cuz it's a what he's a white guy with dreads all right anyway so that's
2431720	2435360	that's the update on that so yeah that supposedly survivor is done in less than
2435360	2439120	two weeks I've been playing that game for a fucking month and I'm like I like
2439120	2445280	it's it's so like mentally draining like if I ever talk about that I do this type
2445280	2449880	of shit again and it's not like all-stars or something like that like
2449880	2452600	it's just like Oh Rob signed up for another game like you guys have
2452600	2455280	permission to just like push me and start smacking me with the microphones
2455280	2458920	over and over and beat some sense into me you have my permission so all right
2458920	2463600	but I am having fun and I'm meeting some really good people so that's cool all
2463600	2468400	right anyway um that was my gaming week let's talk a little bit about other
2468400	2474240	things going on in gaming news so Loki watch stars off some gaming news so we
2474240	2478200	talked a little bit about the joy con drift thing that was an issue last week
2478200	2480360	that people started pointing out a little bit more and there's a
2480360	2487240	class-action lawsuit so Nintendo is kind of addressed the issue by basically
2487240	2493640	repairing these joy cons for free now and so what they're gonna be doing is
2493640	2498520	allowing customers to be able to send them in they no longer have to request
2498520	2504720	to provide proof of purchase for the joy con repairs they just basically send
2504720	2510480	them in and it gets repaired and then if you did pay for repair previously
2510480	2514200	they're gonna refund your money that you spent on that so that's good I mean
2514200	2517280	they've taken advantage of this at some point and it sounds like they've kind of
2517280	2520400	been cornered into caving into some of the pressure because last week we were
2520400	2523320	talking about a class-action lawsuit showing up well I just wish they would
2523320	2527920	just fix the design on it just fix whatever the issue is and then re you
2527920	2533080	know release them with the new you know I don't know the new ones that come out
2533080	2535960	I guess well then cuz you know in chat says why not just mail everybody new
2535960	2539440	joy cons well obviously that's gonna be that's really expensive because
2539440	2543200	considering that the fix like the piece of the replacing is really minimal yeah
2543200	2548000	and so to mail out a brand new control that's kind of really and if your joy
2548000	2551680	cons aren't fucked up they don't want to just send you something that is gonna
2551680	2556600	set is gonna set them back on costs like you know again my joy cons are okay knock
2556600	2560880	on wood you know for now they're fine but it's probably because I don't use my
2560880	2564960	joy cons that much I play like I was a 90% of my switch gaming is on that pro
2564960	2568540	controller and the only time I use those joy cons is like traveling when I was
2568540	2571680	like on the plane I did of course I used the joy cons to play Mario maker 2
2571680	2576040	because getting out the pro controller and the switch on an airplane that's a
2576040	2581200	bit much but using the joy cons and all that was was a little bit more like you
2581200	2584240	know like like a Game Boy or something you know yeah really big Game Boy
2584240	2588640	basically so yeah so that's about the one time I really used to joy cons but
2588640	2591960	even then I'm still kind of using them attached to the system so I think it's
2591960	2595120	still a different type of wear and tear than when you you know have them and
2595120	2598520	you're you know waving them around or doing other stuff you don't have like
2598520	2605560	third-party joy cons yet I mean I get it that you know that it'd be limited but
2605560	2609520	like I'm imagining something that's like attached to this kind of a pro controller
2609520	2612800	type of controller or something like that I mean a little bit beefier that
2612800	2616480	you be able to that have different analog six or something would be kind
2616480	2620400	of nice now cuz you and chat says no no he's always clarifying what you're
2620400	2623680	saying saying I mean you call them up say it's jacked up and they mail you a
2623680	2628280	new one case by case like Xbox just sent everyone a refurb when it red-ringed oh
2628280	2633320	yes the coffins they would send you you have to send them your Xbox yeah so I
2633320	2635840	get but in a way that is kind of what because Nintendo is offering to fix
2635840	2638640	these right so but you're just not necessarily sending them you're taking
2638640	2642480	them in right yeah you'd sell the mail it to them I would think it's just like
2642480	2650920	the Xbox 360 I thought maybe they had like a network of approved fixers no no
2650920	2655240	one can do that in store even like GameStop has their own like remember in
2655240	2658360	the back of the PlayStation manual and it would say here's the approved Sony
2658360	2664040	like repair shops oh I don't be like you and all of Northern California yeah but
2664040	2669320	yeah no one really does that nowadays but yeah it's nice to see that they're
2669320	2673600	taking care of this but really you know it shouldn't take a class-action lawsuit
2673600	2677240	to finally get around to actually fixing an issue yeah it was a little bit
2677240	2680400	slow-moving I think in that regard but I mean it's it's good that they're at
2680400	2683440	least like stepping up and trying to fix it as opposed to just trying to shove it
2683440	2687720	under the rug you know and I think we kind of we kind of knew this it's a
2687720	2691040	better approach to take then what happened with the red ring where it's
2691040	2695200	like oh it's a small it's just a small amount of users that are affected by it
2695200	2699800	you know nip it in the ass now considering the price to fix it is
2699800	2703520	probably pretty minimal yeah yeah it would just be all those shipping costs
2703520	2707960	but a giant company like Nintendo gets you know buku contracts on on shipping
2707960	2712000	and stuff you know so I'm sure it's not you know bad so all right well let's
2712000	2715800	move on and talk about something that's going on with a Nintendo game I think a
2715800	2719480	lot of people were excited about Fire Emblem that came out over this weekend
2719480	2722360	right I think Fire Emblem was out on Friday so I know some people I saw some
2722400	2726520	people on Twitter talking about it I have to admit not a series I super get
2726520	2731920	into I'm not as into the tactical games unless it's Final Fantasy Tactics no
2731920	2734600	hate I understand why people like their fire emblem but it's just you know one
2734600	2737880	of those games I just don't get around to but a very interesting change
2737880	2741880	happening with file a fire emblem fire emblem three houses is going to be
2741880	2744040	getting it and that's the game that just came out it's going to be getting a
2744040	2749080	patch that will replace the male protagonists voice so Nintendo has
2749080	2754520	re-recorded the lines for male Blythe that is the name of the male
2754520	2759800	protagonist because the voice actor Chris Niosi has had some allegations
2759800	2763920	that have shown up against abusive behavior apparently he's also been
2763920	2768000	accused of having a tendency to break and da's he has been in other games
2768000	2773520	including Octopath Traveler Pokemon and Sailor Moon so he has been replaced by
2773640	2779600	Zack Aguilar from the games One Punch Man and Hunter x Hunter and he was in
2779600	2785000	the mobile game Fire Emblem Heroes so they're gonna basically do that so
2785000	2790040	Nintendo of America had mentioned in a statement after assessing the situation
2790040	2794040	we decided to re-record the characters voiceovers and Fire Emblem three houses
2794040	2797960	and Fire Emblem Heroes with another actor the voiceovers will be included in
2797960	2805200	a future patch the original voice actor Niosi put an apology on tumblr after an
2805200	2808880	ex-girlfriend called him out for emotional abuse and so forth and he has
2808880	2813160	admitted to horribly mistreating and abusing friends colleagues and even his
2813160	2817760	significant others so big yikes to all that but definitely sounds like somebody
2817760	2821920	Nintendo did not want to be associated with anymore I couldn't help but be
2821920	2826880	reminded of sorts of I feel like we just had a story like two three months ago
2826880	2831040	about Yakuza game right or yeah it was like Sega's Yakuza game it was a
2831040	2837120	different type of Yakuza game right where I was saying it was a spin-off no
2837120	2843520	no it well it was I think it was a spin-off but it was a Yakuza game okay
2843520	2849200	and they ended up replacing the guy in that who was alcoholism a relative no he
2849200	2854360	was like doing cocaine and drugs drugs are super yeah he's a actor in Japan
2854360	2857680	yeah because I think I've seen him before somewhere I remember he was like
2857680	2863040	a familiar-looking guy like was he like he must have been in some movie that
2863040	2867360	raises anyway so he was replaced in that and it was kind of like oop he just
2867360	2871120	vanished from the game but the interesting thing about patches is that
2871120	2877200	it's you know I and I'm not you know what this guy did is is pretty gross and
2877200	2880960	I understand why Nintendo doesn't want to be associated but you know there's
2880960	2885520	going to be those collector collectible people who are gonna be like well I want
2885520	2889720	to play the version that has the original guy in it because it's gonna be
2889720	2894960	the more rare version so if I take my switch offline I can hear that one even
2894960	2897840	though in this day and age of YouTube you would think well if you really just
2897840	2901000	want to hear the subtle differences between the two interpretations the
2901000	2904560	character there's gonna be YouTube's galore and things like that but it is it
2904560	2910240	does create this interesting like pre patch I guess space of trying to see
2910240	2914000	things before they were changed and I would think even in the case of the
2914000	2919360	Yakuza game that got flipped there's probably the same type of fascination I
2919360	2922840	suppose going on I think there's a good word for it fascination you know even if
2922840	2926240	you're like you know you understand with the reasons everything like that there's
2926240	2930600	still that that curiosity about I wonder what it sounded like originally if that
2930600	2934160	makes sense hmm interesting because Bobby brings up a completely different
2934160	2937440	type of situation with voice actor replacement talking about justice for
2937440	2941960	Peter Dinklage which you might remember he was the original voice actor in
2941960	2948320	destiny for the little shit I forgot that thing's name the ghost destiny
2948320	2952720	goes right so he was the original voice that little thing and he wasn't very
2952720	2956600	good no it wasn't it wasn't very it wasn't very well done so in one of the
2956600	2960760	later I think was expansions like just in the middle of the night Nolan North
2960760	2966720	came and replaced him like just came across the wall and replaced him as the
2966720	2970080	voice actor and Peter Dinklage was suddenly patched out and that's it but
2970080	2973000	that's an interesting scenario too because you know you kind of have to
2973000	2976640	download those patches because destiny isn't always online persistent type of
2976640	2980280	game yeah I don't think that's the case with something like fire emblems or you
2980280	2985020	know that Yakuza game we had a little while ago well nowadays it is I guess
2985020	2989160	remember they did some we had some similar sign into your network account
2989160	2991560	they haven't you I don't want to spoil what's coming up but you all know it's
2991560	2997480	they had a recall member of a little big planet remember that because the all
2997480	3000720	right because the music there was the music was in there and I had one of the
3000720	3004200	original versions that had like the license hadn't really cleared for it
3004200	3007980	the disc got out anyway yeah well it was you know wasn't that is because there
3007980	3014040	was language in there it was it was some foreign words that was offensive somehow
3014040	3020880	and so right and so that they had to take this on religion or religious
3020880	3025080	thing and they were that that can be shaky ground you know so but I did have
3025080	3029960	the original version of that which I had it in there before they pulled it because
3029960	3034720	they recalled all of them I didn't send my back um I think I ended up selling it
3034720	3039760	later on but yeah it was it was gonna cry and sell it for enough yeah
3039760	3045760	interest was patched out later too so yeah let's see going to chat over at a
3045920	3052440	twitch.tv slash bog network pistol pakas in chat says I mean if you have a cart
3052440	3056640	copy the patch isn't gonna overwrite that data right no I would imagine it
3056640	3059960	wouldn't so I mean all you would have to do is delete the local data for the game
3059960	3063480	from your switch and it's only gonna be I mean you may not be able to play
3063480	3067540	online you may not be able to do some of the things that because I believe if you
3067540	3071160	do not have the most current version of a Nintendo game it won't let you play
3071160	3074560	online until you patch it but you can play it offline and connect it to the
3074560	3078160	internet and that's how you know I imagine people would do it but most
3078160	3081840	people aren't gonna bat an eyelash or they they just put their switch on the
3081840	3084920	dock overnight and it's on their home network so the thing's just gonna update
3084920	3088280	whether you want it to or not and most people are never gonna know that this
3088280	3092520	voice actor was just suddenly replaced but yeah it's just it's just it's also
3092520	3097080	this interesting day and age that we live in where they can do that type of
3097080	3101520	stuff where they can remove music from Grand Theft Auto San Andreas because
3101520	3105120	they run out of the license runs out yeah patch it out of the game which is
3105120	3108960	annoying sg100 Matt reminds us of another case recently John Tron was
3108960	3113200	taken out of ukulele because there's you know controversy there as well so we'll
3113200	3117080	just leave it at that so there's what happens when you're a shit to people so
3117080	3123160	yeah well don't be a shit to people for one but yeah so anyway okay so better to
3123160	3129000	be the shit then be a shit okay so we kind of touched a little bit tangentially
3129000	3133720	there another issue that's all over the internet this week so dark Sakura tell
3133720	3139280	me a little bit about what's going on here Oh shenanigans oh sorry real quick
3139280	3143000	because quest buster with a great comment about this isn't just games in
3143000	3147560	this day and age quest buster says reminds me when Ridley Scott literally
3147560	3152400	reshot everything that had Kevin Spacey in it for his movie all the money in the
3152400	3156000	world replacing with Christopher Plummer that's right they do that in movies too
3156040	3162320	so obviously Kevin Spacey yikes so they reshot everything that was somebody else
3162320	3166600	and didn't I think that Christopher Plummer got an Oscar nomination for it
3166600	3168960	because I think in Hollywood you know they kind of you know Hollywood's a
3168960	3172840	weird it's almost like they kind of knew like he did that last minute until it so
3172840	3175840	he kind of got an Oscar nom for it was interesting anyway all right now we can
3175840	3178680	move on sorry I thought that was a very interesting comment like oh it's not
3178680	3184400	just games well okay so as a lot of people know the first three doom games
3184400	3189680	kind of had this mass release on consoles and mobile devices but it had
3189680	3197720	this Bethesda login requirement and remember playing doom on the PC back in
3197720	3200760	the day when you had to log into your Bethesda account in order to get
3200760	3205520	connected on doom 2 with your friends yeah exactly it's like login to be net
3205520	3211160	remember that Bina is battle net also like what is that about Bina is battle
3211160	3220520	net well it anyway they are patching that out it caused a lot of memes it was
3220520	3226320	great but they put out an announcement and I'll just read it directly this came
3226320	3231680	out on the 27th so this was yesterday update on our new classic doom releases
3231680	3236160	the Bethesda net login requirement was included for the Slayer's Club to reward
3236160	3240240	members for playing the classic doom games the login should be optional and
3240320	3244000	we're working on changing the requirement to optional now we're just
3244000	3249920	trying to help you know the best part about that is players club so like since
3249920	3254000	they got rid of the original versions they delisted those which had
3254000	3260080	multiplayer by the way and then these don't have the online multiplayer they
3260080	3265160	don't have the online multiplayer the whole point why the fuck else do you
3265160	3268280	play doom 2 for the story local multiplayer reading playboy for the
3268280	3273200	articles get the fuck out anyway honestly I'd never liked to play
3273200	3278120	multiplayer doom I like to multiplayer Duke Nukem but I didn't like to play
3278120	3282040	doom multiplayer I just like to play by myself I love to doom to multiplayer I
3282040	3286280	used to there was a BBS we would call into and it would help connect your doom
3286280	3291320	games and I was I think I was rocking my was it my 386 still didn't know what
3291320	3295600	could have it I think was my 486 for a 100 megahertz at the time and I would
3295600	3299840	play doom in a tiny ass window so that I could actually have the fluid motion
3299840	3305200	when I was playing online it was so fun like kids today wouldn't understand I
3305200	3309120	had black and white doom format classic that I would sneak and play during the
3309120	3316120	middle of my typing class in college at any rate you know the games are out now
3316120	3324720	doom and doom 2 or 499 and doom 3 is 999 and you can play them on iOS and Xbox
3324720	3331240	PlayStation for Xbox one Nintendo switch and Android so yeah none of them have
3331240	3337640	the multiplayer we don't really that is so stupid because I have the one on
3337640	3343120	Xbox 360 which they made backwards compatible with Xbox one so it's in your
3343120	3346960	Xbox one library and as far as I remember you can still play that one
3346960	3350600	online I don't know anybody else with ad listen to that so you can't sell so that
3350600	3355800	you can't get it again you can't buy it we'll just build some 486 and have some
3355800	3360160	land go on seriously we need to do we need to do a PC do night hell yeah or
3360160	3364240	Duke Nukem honestly Duke Nukem was the best at all I like the voice macros oh
3364240	3369560	yeah like Duke Nukem was like the the creme de la creme of those 90 shooters I
3369560	3373120	think because that's the one I remember playing in the college dorm we would be
3373120	3376480	yelling each other from down the hall like when we get killed that was those
3376480	3383160	were the days anyway so what were some of your favorite memes you guys saw of
3383160	3387560	course Bobby black ones Bobby black wolf in our chat he did a little thing on his
3387560	3390960	podcast I hit a little graphic that came up that said yet needed Bethesda
3390960	3394360	announcement can't counsel listen to podcast I'm sure somebody clipped it and
3394360	3397320	it's over on Twitch I'll be honest I didn't really see all that many he also
3397320	3400880	did one for his Tesla which is funny oh yeah the one he did for his Tesla was
3400880	3405040	funny yeah I saw Tesla being towed yesterday that wasn't Bobby's Tesla
3405040	3408880	Bobby did something on Twitter where I think there must be a drawing app or
3408880	3412160	something on those big screens and he put like you must log into your
3412160	3414920	Bethesda net account to turn on your car so that's something like that I'm
3414920	3420640	paraphrasing but yeah that was pretty funny yeah I thought there were I just
3420640	3423720	thought some of the classic 8-bit memes were great with the whole like you know
3423720	3426880	you must log into your Bethesda net account to find our princess in another
3426880	3430760	castle you know things like that just good stuff you got it you got to love
3430760	3435320	Twitter going crazy with the memes good stuff anyway it's always fun when
3435320	3442520	Bethesda is a joke which is all the time nowadays I just why would you put out
3442520	3446360	something again like I get the whole like oh we want to put doom on iOS and
3446360	3453240	and all that stuff why would you take out the multiplayer like just I'll take
3453240	3457280	I don't want to run the multiplayer servers for five thousand please I guess
3457280	3460400	I don't know I don't know what that's all about that's unfortunate isn't there
3460560	3464680	some reddit out there I swear to God I saw some reddit where it was like will
3464680	3469560	it run doom and it's them installing do because the doom source code was public
3469560	3473840	some time ago I think I think they made it for somebody so they get doom running
3473840	3477560	all these things because I remember recently there was some type of exploit
3477560	3481080	within it was either the Harry Potter game or Pokemon go game one of those
3481080	3485280	games you could launch a full-on web browser from within the game so somebody
3485280	3489880	had them playing doom within Pokemon go and like that's the type of shit you see
3489880	3494000	on reddit we're like you know running it's called like running doom or doom I
3494000	3498160	don't know but it's it's what what can you install doom on so it's it's weird
3498160	3502080	that this is so timed where it's like yay we got doom on iOS and all this
3502080	3509840	stuff but we fucking changed it it's a little silly no no just just played on
3509840	3514800	PC like you have a PC that runs I know if you have a PC you have a PC that runs
3514800	3519240	doom you sure do Bobby Blackwell says yeah you know this will open next year's
3519240	3522800	e3 presser you think they're gonna be that tongue-in-cheek enough to start
3522800	3526080	their e3 presser and then have a splash screen saying you must have your
3526080	3529840	Bethesda net account to continue I could see them phrasing it a different way to
3529840	3532800	poke fun at it they might say it like they might show a sample login screen
3532800	3537360	please log into your Bethesda account and then the person I would think that
3537360	3540240	they are not gonna do that and the reason because we're talking like
3540240	3546080	almost a year away I mean why bring that memes shelf why bring why bring that
3546080	3551200	back up why why remind people that you fucked up in a way because I'm sure
3551200	3556440	between now and June of next year they're gonna fuck up in it dozens of
3556440	3560960	ways that are gonna be far greater than what we have with just doom so honestly
3560960	3564400	think next year's e3 presser they just open with the theme from the Elder
3564400	3569720	Scrolls and then show show off Elder Scrolls 6 and it's just like this at
3569720	3573760	this point at this point they should just fucking mock the South Park I'm
3573760	3579360	sorry video and just have Todd Howard apologizing to be fair to the folks in
3579360	3583640	chat as 200 Matt says they were able to joke about themselves about fallout 76
3583640	3587240	they will rip themselves plenty oh yes and that worked out so well for them
3587240	3591620	they brought up fallout 76 stuff as soon her Matt says they made jokes about the
3591620	3594960	arrow to the knee stuff in the presser do you know like I've heard that joke
3594960	3598780	was in Mortal Kombat 11 oh yeah I heard that arrow to the knee stuff so fucking
3598780	3603120	much that when I was do you remember I randomly started playing Skyrim VR when
3603160	3606440	I was like getting in place in VR like I got to the point where the guy really
3606440	3610520	says that and I did I'm like is this guy being a meep oh no oh this is the
3610520	3616880	actual arrow to the knee part like I had that like whoa meta moment type of thing
3616880	3621040	going on like oh it's an arrow to the knee Joe oh wait no this this is the
3621040	3624820	arrow to the knee line I am it was great it's like you have those guards to say
3624820	3628520	that and then they run straight up to a dragon started hitting it with a sword
3628520	3635240	and get like torched by fire and they're like yeah I was actually watching like
3635240	3639800	all the intros on Mortal Kombat 11 to get the references and it's totally a
3639800	3645280	line even today yeah my favorite is the mod for Skyrim whenever they say that
3645280	3651400	line they get struck by lightning see a tiberian chat says it's like right in
3651400	3655920	front of my salad oh I still use that today in fact I was I think the last
3655920	3658960	time I used it was in one of these type of games I think it was like the
3658960	3661440	survivor II type games I think it was a different one that was going faster and
3661440	3664240	something happened that I didn't like and I said to the other person I was
3664240	3669000	like really right in front of my salad you're gonna do that so those those
3669000	3677580	memes oh you know so there was a gay porn that was shot and I don't know what
3677580	3681440	they're doing oh they're full-on like having sex in the kitchen but they're
3681440	3687440	doing it like the counter is up here so they're like down here and the girl who
3687440	3690740	I don't know if she's supposed to be somebody's girlfriend or she's like you
3690740	3694480	know the the fruit fly the flame dame type of thing or what but she's like
3694480	3698600	eating your salad and she's like she looks and she goes are you guys fucking
3698600	3703760	and she goes really right in front of my salad that's pretty great and honestly
3703760	3708160	that would be me it was I'd be like don't do that in the kitchen that's in
3708160	3713880	sanitary it was it was improved I think and now of course of course she is now
3713880	3717640	like famous you know she's making her coin off that whole thing I think they
3717640	3721640	put her in legit movies and stuff you know they made a sequel to a poor she's
3721640	3725400	not even a porn actress she was just like the salad chick but now she's
3725400	3730360	getting in all these porns because she's the salad girl she's the solid salad
3730360	3735080	tosser but honestly that would be I'd just be like that's unsanitary don't do
3735720	3740560	pixel pakka says that porn company has a weird thing about girls discovering the
3740560	3745520	screwing and Sia Tiberi says it's the girlfriend the one guy is pretending to
3745520	3749240	be an in-home cooking class thing for the boyfriend and then it went to like
3749240	3756080	sex okay I guess they thank you all for explaining the plot and for your later
3756080	3761880	brows all s 200 Matt has linked to these safe for work version on YouTube if you
3761880	3764800	wish to go look at that I'm going to assume that there's black bars because
3764800	3771160	it's on YouTube covering up the like I'm offended by I'm just offended by you
3771160	3778760	seen one you see them all I'm afraid that salad dressing oh yeah she's just
3778760	3790440	like it's also the way she says it she's like really anyway tall counter to me
3790440	3795200	baby oh it's a bar nevermind oh I see maybe this whole meme thing does have
3795200	3798400	weight cuz here we are talking about the salad chick and that was like two years
3798400	3806120	ago we are we that I'm saving that now so I can watch it when I get home okay
3806120	3809880	yeah yeah you got to do homework sure all right anyway let's move on all right
3809880	3813000	Loki then if you don't like this topic how about a new one we'll talk about
3813000	3818120	grand theft auto online and you know there's been an issue with blue boxes
3818120	3824480	being compared to gambling and you know that a lot of companies can get in
3824480	3830280	trouble because of in-game gambling mechanics might kind of run afoul of
3830280	3835200	some online gambling laws well take two said fuck all that let's put gambling in
3835200	3840600	our games so they opened up the diamond casino in Grand Theft Auto online so you
3840600	3846480	can actually go in there and buy chips and gamble and you win money and of
3846480	3850160	course because this is Grand Theft Auto online you can buy shark cards with real
3850160	3855640	money and get in-game money to gamble with and stuff like that so because of
3855640	3865880	that issue certain countries can actually purchase the in-game cards or
3865880	3870920	even do some of the gambling games in there because of different local laws so
3870920	3876720	for example Iceland Iran Peru and Vietnam are some of the countries that
3876720	3885520	you can't access most of the casino and also that certain things you can't you
3885520	3890280	can't buy the penthouse in the casino as well and you're not actually able to
3890280	3896480	virtually gamble in there so it's interesting that they have to go this
3896480	3902120	route to kind of get around the different laws but what happens when you
3902120	3907160	put actual gambling in your game granted yes you can't actually get real money
3907160	3911360	from this but you can pay real money for in someone with gambling tendencies
3911360	3918040	wants to win that in-game you know money to buy like some fake car in there they
3918040	3924800	may be tempted to drop real-world money to buy chips and so it's kind of an
3924800	3928160	issue no that's something fascinating that I wouldn't have thought about is
3928160	3932960	that you might have like this like real-world gambling you know issue and
3932960	3938840	that you kind of act out through online games because maybe it's less of a
3938840	3942720	problem because it's it's a fake game but in the same time yeah I mean you
3942720	3946800	could get like if someone has gambling tendencies and you're you're betting
3946800	3952240	like fake money you're still gonna have the same response like to that even
3952240	3955000	though you're not winning real money and because of that you're like oh man
3955000	3961360	no I'm down I just need to I only pay I'm gonna pay ten dollars and we get some
3961360	3964340	more money and then I'm gonna get back on top of him win that money back you
3964340	3968040	could have like that same kind of tendency and they fucking know what
3968040	3971720	they're doing they fucking know what they're doing they know people are gonna
3971720	3974600	there's some people out there they're gonna do that and they don't care
3974600	3980920	because they're making money off of it so it is what it is some people though
3980920	3984520	of course being the internet age are getting around these restrictions by
3984520	3989660	using VPNs because they can so even this won't necessarily stop them but that may
3989660	3994280	be illegal in your country if you do that interesting all right well let's
3994280	3998360	move on to another topic this is one that I think many of us have
3998360	4002200	unfortunately had to deal with when playing games and maybe you know earlier
4002200	4005520	we were kind of having a laugh about the doom online and the fact that it's been
4005520	4009320	removed but you know some of us maybe aren't playing games online the way we
4009320	4013200	used to and the reason why is because of assholes harassment is really what it
4013200	4019400	is and this week making its way around the gaming blogs is a new survey by the
4019400	4024880	Anti-Defamation League or ADL and as part of their report they reported that
4024880	4029920	as many as two-thirds of online gamers in the US have experienced it had
4029920	4033920	experienced what they called severe harassment half of the responders of the
4033920	4040120	survey said that their race religion ability gender sexual orientation or
4040120	4044720	ethnicity was something that made them a target and 30% claimed they've been
4044720	4050000	doxxed in an online game that one really that seems so high all they had to do is
4050000	4054880	ask a woman oh yeah no I would have told him it's no it's and don't like I'm
4054880	4059400	absolutely not going like wow I can't believe it's this rampant like don't get
4059400	4063680	me wrong like I'm it's absolutely it's this rampant and I'm sure but I'm just
4063680	4072640	the 30% docs I'm like that's Wow that's scary and a quarter of respondents said
4072640	4077200	that online they have been exposed to white supremacist ideology that also
4077200	4082760	being a part of the ADL report which obviously is a whole nother yikes and
4082760	4085680	you know just leave it at that but unfortunately I think those of us that
4085680	4091800	have been on a rando map online or something unfortunately yeah I've heard
4091800	4094960	all I've heard all that stupid shit when playing things like destiny and
4094960	4098720	halo and that type of stuff online with randos and it's why I really don't like
4098720	4103360	fucking playing with randos online anymore I don't fucking do it on Xbox
4103360	4107640	Live or this Xbox Live is for playing with my friends vog network people are
4107640	4111520	fine because I feel like if you are at the level enough where you want to come
4111520	4114240	hang with us in online clubs and things like that then you kind of know you
4114240	4118080	accept these rules of you're not gonna be a fucking asshole because you know
4118080	4123000	Bobby'll ban you if you do I want like though there to be team mute that you
4123000	4127680	vote and you mute somebody I want to say and I could be wrong I want to say
4127680	4131640	either halo or destiny did put something like that in that if enough people kind
4131640	4135840	of muted somebody that person would be muted but I don't quote me on that but I
4135840	4139840	want to say that is something that has been explored in the I want ostracism to
4139840	4145440	be a thing they have to be careful because some people could use that type
4145440	4149200	of voting system to gang up on an innocent person that's the problem is
4149200	4153920	that the bad guys are gonna use it for their own purposes too that's that's and
4153920	4157080	that's why I think you haven't seen that stuff if stuff implemented more
4157080	4161800	widespread I just really want like Jean Grey level psychic power so I can reach
4161800	4165880	across the country and smack them in the head because Nazis deserve to be punched
4165880	4171200	misogynists deserve to be punched metal mayhem and chat says not just gamers but
4171200	4175760	streamers too oh sure that's one reason where it's like you know olr we get
4175760	4181160	anywhere between what like 25 maybe 45 maybe 50 at our peak viewers that we get
4181160	4186800	live we have about 33 on right now if my little console is to be believed we have
4186800	4189340	more than that that listen on the podcast feed but you know we have a we
4189340	4191920	have a decently sized crowd that turns up here on Sunday nights and we're
4191920	4196200	really appreciative but I like that we're kind of like at that level where
4196200	4200820	we're pulling a respectable crowd here people people actually want to listen to
4200940	4204100	what we're doing and we appreciate that I love it and they want to participate
4204100	4209260	in the conversation that's wonderful too but we're not big enough where the
4209260	4212820	fucking haters are coming out or the people that are just there to get a
4212820	4217940	reaction are coming out like that's a problem that you're more twitch partners
4217940	4222220	and the people that have you know 200 people that watch one of their streams
4222220	4225580	that's the stuff they have to deal with so in a way like you know and I've been
4225580	4228860	asked kind of point-blank are you are you irritated that you're not more
4228860	4233900	famous and it's one of those things where it's like I don't know like then
4233900	4238140	I if we were bigger we'd have to deal with all that shit and I don't know how
4238140	4243020	I feel about that I kind of I feel like we're almost better off in a way not
4243020	4248980	having to deal with that so um guys you doing chat says I play online a lot and
4248980	4254020	no one ever talks once in a blue moon I think the missing word there I see some
4254020	4258100	nasty text in rocket League but most of the time people never use voice chat it
4258220	4262140	may also depend on what you're playing and I know I don't use voice chat
4262140	4265300	because I got sick of the things people were saying on voice chat so if I do
4265300	4271340	play games online I don't use it now it is worth saying I do play things like
4271340	4276540	Final Fantasy 14 World of Warcraft in the past I've played those types of MMOs
4276540	4282660	online but I think it's harder to be that much of an asshole in those games
4282660	4287340	because usually you're working together towards a common goal and if you're
4287380	4291900	gonna be that guy then you're not gonna get to the goal either and granted don't
4291900	4294820	get me wrong and I know full well know some people exist in in those things
4294820	4298700	only to troll and I've seen my fair share of them in World of Warcraft but
4298700	4302860	even the trolls will oftentimes end up they end up on block lists and then when
4302860	4305700	they want to do something for real later on they can't because they've pissed
4305700	4310420	everybody off on the server so anyway some other comments I wanted to read
4310420	4315060	about this report and then we can stew on it a little bit if we want online
4315060	4318820	harassment is getting worse and a similar ADL survey this according to
4318820	4323700	past studies that was conducted earlier in the year talked about that 37% of
4323700	4329540	Americans have experienced severe harassment online online gaming meant
4329540	4334260	when they kind of analyzed that the ADL survey said 65% of players experienced
4334260	4338820	severe harassment when it's the online gaming now just some things about the
4338820	4343900	survey ADL sampled about a thousand people and to be fair the gaming
4343900	4349460	community at large is trying to figure out what they can do about this for
4349460	4353660	example Phil Spencer from Xbox recently had that post about laying out things
4353660	4357180	for combating abuse saying that you know gaming is for everyone period
4357180	4362420	overwatch they put in the endorsement feature so that you you kind of reward
4362420	4365420	people as opposed to punishing people and they say that the endorsement
4365420	4371140	feature reduced toxic behavior by 40% so some things to consider but obviously
4371140	4377780	harassment is still a thing I don't know without going too deep what what
4377780	4383060	can we do about it what can us decent people do about harassment and I think
4383060	4385980	there's definitely like number one I think the obvious thing would be you
4385980	4390180	know call it out when you see it like if somebody's getting harassed you know as
4390180	4392980	much as you might not want to or something like that you have to kind of
4392980	4397020	stand up for the underdog a little bit right but I think the reality of the
4397020	4400740	situation is that most of us are just pulling out of these situations where
4400740	4404940	we even get to where the bullies are and like I said I just play with friends
4404940	4409500	done like this is why I don't get in these mixed situations so I don't know
4409500	4416020	thoughts yeah calling it out I think just reporting people that are you know
4416020	4422900	doing this kind of harassment and I mean I don't know just playing with friends
4422900	4428940	yeah guys you doing chat says anytime I hear a jerk picking on someone I fight
4428940	4433020	back as Jonah to Matt says the report did say the 88% of players who play
4433020	4437300	certain games like Warcraft had very positive experiences as voice chats and
4437300	4440580	you know I think especially like but in Wow and in Final Fantasy and those types
4440580	4444140	of games you find your guildies you kind of find your tribe you find your people
4444140	4447060	and you're on voice chat with those people and like people are gonna treat
4447060	4449740	each other with respect because again you're helping each other out you're all
4449740	4453100	get you're all getting epic purples or whatever the equivalent is in the game
4453100	4457420	you're playing you know pixel pockets and chat says any game I play I
4457420	4462060	immediately mute voice chat for all and I'm silent myself it only took a few
4462060	4465740	shitty people to make me decide it's not worth it with random people I'll just
4465740	4469620	chat with my friends and that's more fun anyway yeah I'm kind of right there with
4469620	4476620	you all right well anyhow let's move on and talk about other voice issues right
4476620	4483420	dark soccer what do you have well this one um I don't really know how I feel
4483420	4486900	about it but basically Microsoft is gonna be tweaking their Xbox one
4486900	4491860	dashboard again and this time they're removing Cortana I don't know it's still
4491860	4499260	on PC and Windows 10 right the Cortana interface I don't I believe Cortana
4499260	4504380	still on Windows 10 yeah but at any rate they are removing it and redesigning
4504380	4510340	things and it'll bring everything into one area where you can see it right away
4510340	4516220	so it's supposed to give you quicker access to your past titles mixer service
4516260	4522340	community and Microsoft Store and so they're just I guess in the long run
4522340	4527980	trying to make it a more efficient thing but Cortana is going bye-bye I guess they
4527980	4531340	do need to kind of clean up some of that extra stuff on Xbox one and I can't I
4531340	4534660	can't think of a time where I've been like Cortana take me to the store to buy
4534660	4538220	Castlevania or something you know it's just doesn't really happen but yeah the
4538220	4541260	big thing on here is that yeah you can no longer talk to her via your headset
4541260	4546860	you can still power on your Xbox one through Xbox skill for Cortana on iOS
4546860	4551420	Android or Windows so that's true because there might be for some people
4551420	4555580	that might be an accessibility thing so I don't just want to like say well it's
4555580	4561060	useless for me so fuck it because I could there could be a very big reason
4561060	4565660	why it could be an accessibility thing for Cortana to help you navigate there's
4565660	4573780	more they basically are refocusing Cortana for the business scenarios and
4573780	4579300	are working on conversation recognition but they did decouple her from the
4579300	4586060	Windows 10 for the May update and they are making Cortana a separate app hmm so
4586060	4588700	interesting well it's good that it's still there because I bet there are some
4588700	4592580	people that kind of need Cortana s2100 Matt and chat says Cortana was
4592580	4596020	initially used with your Kinect after they killed that off you could still do
4596020	4600580	it with your mic now it's gone Bobby Blackwell says I used Xbox record that a
4600580	4605060	lot but Cortana took it away and mental mayhem says to be honest when I first
4605060	4609420	got Windows 10 I tried Cortana just for the lulls but it got boring quick all
4609420	4614060	those comments from our chat room over at twitch TV slash vog network so there
4614060	4619420	you go Cortana will no longer be a part of the Xbox one after well unless you
4619420	4623900	use some workarounds and things like that after a future update let's move on
4623900	4626200	a few more stories for you guys then we're gonna get to the classic game of
4626200	4631540	the week Loki yes so this is kind of neat there's a brand new I don't know
4631540	4639700	spirit not really unauthorized spiritual successor I guess of Simon's quest so
4639700	4643700	there's a game that's coming out that someone's working on called Simon quest
4643700	4650220	Transylvania adventure and it's kind of homage or parody of Simon's quest and
4650220	4659580	it's like a indie game that hopefully won't get struck down by you know a DMC
4659580	4663740	a or something like that but it definitely is got the same type of stuff
4663740	4667620	that you would see in Simon's quest they said convoluted hints mansions and a
4667620	4672180	time system that doesn't make you wait and apparently they're working on a demo
4672180	4678780	so this is a the Twitter user program answer and looks pretty cool so far just
4678780	4684900	based on the little video that he posted definitely get the vibe of Castlevania a
4684900	4688460	little too much though I was gonna say I getting some cease-and-desist vibes on
4688460	4693180	yeah you know at what point does parody end and copycat yeah I don't get me
4693180	4697780	wrong like it looks great it looks really cool like I love the retro vibe
4697780	4701220	it's giving and you know and and just how much it kind of invokes Castlevania
4701220	4704940	but it's kind of this different thing obviously um and I understand that like
4704940	4710660	they're trying to like not use the Castlevania name but Simon quest yeah
4710660	4713940	maybe you should have renamed your protagonist maybe why don't they call
4713940	4716620	like castle quest or well I guess that was probably a name of the game
4716620	4721500	sometime at some point or like you know Simon adventure yes something something
4721500	4729780	to get it a little more distant from that so hmm it looks neat hope it comes
4729780	4736060	out Sia Tabiri suggests Trevor quest in our chat room Trevor quest yeah use one
4736060	4741700	of the other all right Belmont's why not yeah I don't know I'm definitely looking
4741700	4746140	forward to checking out if it actually ends up coming out apparently though
4746140	4752820	they were supposed to have a playable version of it at Con Bravo so I don't
4752820	4757240	know we'll see but I'm guessing there's I'm guessing Konami doesn't exactly have
4757240	4765120	the rush the rush between you know C and D versus it being out now it's that
4765120	4768360	stuff at the end of your project tears we're just like hey look I made this
4768360	4776240	game it's done now you can see India it's too late yeah pixel pocket suggests
4776240	4782080	the name no me's quest that's Simon backwards SSG 100 Matt suggests the
4782080	4787320	title love Simon quest I guess how about how about they they could just
4787320	4792000	change the protagonist Simone's quest Simone's quest own Raven Simone ace
4792000	4800560	quest let's not do that why not see a debris just Dracula scavenger hunt the
4800560	4805640	adventure all right anyway let's move on let's talk a little bit about something
4805640	4809360	that is going to be going away from the Wii U for those of you that are still
4809360	4812640	using your Wii U which there might be some of you out there I mean even though
4812640	4815520	I'm sure many of you have updated to the switch there might be some reasons to
4815520	4821880	keep your Wii U around but as of September 26th if you do use a Wii U to
4821880	4827000	watch Amazon Prime video you'll no longer be able to do that prime video
4827000	4831280	users are starting to get emails letting them know that they no longer to be able
4831280	4835880	to do that and this is kind of interesting a $25 credit towards buying
4835880	4840480	fire TV devices to help that feel a little less now I want to just fire up
4840480	4845680	my Wii U and open the no I'm not gonna get a fire team all right the email says
4845680	4849280	we are continually upgrading our service and this occasionally means we can no
4849280	4852480	longer support certain device models to help you continue streaming your
4852480	4855800	favorite content we're offering you a $25 credit towards select fire TV
4855800	4859040	devices which will allow you to continue to stream your favorites from prime
4859040	4864120	video so if you're using the Wii U for this you still have Netflix YouTube and
4864120	4868240	Hulu today but who knows how much longer that is going to be now it should
4868240	4871920	be pointed out Amazon Prime is not on the switch some of these you know I
4871920	4875360	think YouTube's on the switch at this point Hulu's on the switch but not
4875360	4881000	Slick's no not Netflix Netflix ain't on the switch and Amazon Prime isn't on the
4881000	4886200	switch so this isn't as easy as just going over to the switch and I will say
4886200	4891480	you know what I I have used I do remember downloading prime video onto
4891480	4895800	the Wii U and using it because my broadcast signal from the Wii U was
4895800	4899640	strong enough where if I had Amazon going on the Wii U I could take the
4899640	4904440	tablet into the bedroom and watch an episode of Drag Race or something from
4904440	4909720	the bedroom so you know they're there may be some uses why somebody wants to
4909720	4912360	take that tablet and watch it somewhere else their house a little portable
4912360	4916400	television so but I guess at the same time if I wanted to I could just use my
4916400	4920840	phone but the Wii U had that kind of bigger screen you know yeah I mean it's
4920840	4925040	nice but I understand that they don't need they want to support it but I'm not
4925040	4929280	gonna profess that I've like used it at all ever recently they probably figured
4929280	4934920	out that the numbers aren't really you know there as far as the number of users
4934920	4941240	and so it makes sense that they would probably retire mm-hmm let's see I
4941240	4945080	wanted to read some other comments in chat Bobby Blackwell points out twitch
4945080	4950200	also isn't on the switch no that's I mean I think we all understand be too
4950200	4953600	easy twitch on the switch well and we understand that the switch probably
4953600	4958360	isn't going to let you broadcast stuff because of you know the the parts that
4958360	4960560	are in it maybe when there's a pro maybe that's something I'm looking at for the
4960560	4965560	pro hmm who knows we'll just theorize on that oh I have the pros I have a pro
4965560	4970480	switch to do streaming services I bet that'll be a thing but anyway but it's
4970480	4974640	surprising that you don't at least just have the twitch like watch stuff client
4974640	4978560	that is a little weird I think yeah I don't know I'd love to be able to have
4978560	4983840	that so anyway as 200 Matt says most companies are like this is gone in blank
4983840	4988000	days if you have problems with this kick rocks yeah so it's it's kind of true
4988000	4992560	that you know they didn't have to offer the $25 incentive on the fire TV or
4992560	4997600	whatever but they are but I think Amazon probably discounted the price by 25 bucks
4997600	5003120	on Prime Day anyway if not more than that so I'm sure Amazon takes a loss I
5003120	5007240	mean because it's almost like game consoles the more fire TVs that are in
5007240	5011720	home the more people that are likely to buy stuff on the Amazon Prime video
5011720	5015720	thing so it kind of suits them to have that in as many places as possible so I
5015720	5023360	don't think this is just them being the nice guy if you will all right anyhow as
5023360	5028920	200 Matt says maybe it'll let you stream from the switch but only at 480 P let's
5028920	5032960	see your streams are gonna be crap quality all right let's move on to the
5032960	5036840	classic game of the week every week dark soccer steps in the gaming vault and
5036840	5040120	finds a game that she thinks hey you guys should be remembering this game
5040120	5043440	this week I'm kind of surprised you're doing this game this week this is a big
5043440	5046880	one and I thought you might have would save this for an anniversary show or
5046880	5051040	something yeah yeah I thought we'd already done this one too I also thought
5051040	5054600	we'd already done this one I think just with me being kind of in music game mode
5054600	5058560	it stuck out in my head it's fair and it's also one of those congratulations
5058560	5062360	this game is 10 years old type of moments actually right now it's 12 years
5062360	5066120	old all right so what is the game rock band there you go so I just want to
5066120	5070080	point out usually on the podcast we have a little bit of the game's audio in
5070080	5074160	the background um however tonight we have removed the audio just because we
5074160	5078480	don't want to risk a twitch muting for the copyright music so we only have the
5078480	5084040	visual writing on twitch you can get like something like Charlene I'm right
5084040	5087560	behind you or whatever like I just I didn't want to risk it even with the
5087560	5092200	freebie songs so it's fine if you yeah y'all probably you're already familiar
5092200	5095080	with rock band I imagine this crowd pretty familiar with rock band already
5095080	5102000	yeah anyway so rock band is a music game is developed by harmonix it was
5102000	5108360	published by MTV games and distributed by EA and we are talking about the first
5108360	5115200	game in the series it was out for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 released on
5115200	5120760	November 20th 2007 and there was a PlayStation 2 version it was released
5120760	5130680	December 18th 2007 so also a Wii version on June 22nd 2008 harmonix had
5130680	5136480	also developed the guitar hero series and then when the guitar hero was sent
5136480	5143280	off to never soft harmonix made the new game with multi-instrument gameplay so
5143280	5148640	sort of like having your guitar in one game instead of spread out amongst all
5148640	5154080	of the various you know I guess it actually was kind of like the guitar
5154080	5158240	you know by having the multiple instruments except you you know it grew
5158240	5165840	from there from just you know guitar and drum and mic and there have been like a
5165840	5171800	bajillion sequels you know of rock band so we won't even be getting into there
5171800	5177880	but basically you've got your different peripherals you have you know of course
5177880	5180960	your on-screen interface is what controls how you're supposed to do it
5180960	5184760	with the mic you have to sing to relative pitch to the original vocal so
5184760	5188160	I know some people who just may as well not fucking use the mic because they
5188160	5191960	can't you know hold a tune in a bag
5192920	5198240	there's nothing also by the way that will set off like my own self loathing
5198240	5203280	of my voice than playing ink on the mic in garage band just saying I hate
5203280	5209600	hearing myself out of key but you know you also have you know your guitar one
5209600	5215600	person can be bass and you've got your drum kit later on of course you know we
5215600	5221280	got the piano and the cymbals and all these other goodies so at any rate you
5221280	5227160	build up your score you get different multipliers and you have an overdrive
5227160	5233000	that lets you just you know apparently play really awesome and then you can use
5233000	5237880	like on the guitar you use your whammy bar for like using effectors for how
5237880	5242080	you're playing you know example you've got different difficulty levels easy
5242080	5247960	medium hard and expert and if you don't play well enough you get muted out of
5247960	5256880	the song so there you go um the PlayStation 2 and we version didn't have
5256880	5262480	any customizable options for your player but Xbox 360 and ps3 did so you could
5262480	5266480	change their physique their clothes tattoos the way they move all kinds of
5266480	5273960	stuff and then you know again we had a the guitar was based off the Fender
5273960	5279200	Stratocaster you had you know your your drum pedals you also have like your game
5279200	5283400	modes like band world tour where you could play in different venues and
5283400	5287560	unlock things and customize your character even more you also have like
5287560	5295320	solo play you have a solo tour and the soundtrack pretty massive so they
5295320	5300640	reached out to five record labels that provided most of the master recordings
5300640	5308160	including EMI Hollywood Records Sony BMG Universal Music and Warner Music well
5308160	5312000	actually for Warner Music specifically it was Rhino Entertainment you know you
5312000	5316160	know what I remember about Rhino Entertainment is that when I was young I
5316200	5319680	had a bunch of albums that had the old Rhino logo on it and that's how I always
5319680	5327480	remember Rhino Entertainment but they had you know the Wii version had five
5327480	5332280	additional songs by the way over some of the others they had Danny California
5332280	5336600	don't fear the Reaper understand man here it goes again
5336600	5340880	highway star and learn to fly oh and suffragette city and when I dead or
5340880	5344280	alive and won't get fooled again so those are bonus you could also get
5344280	5351240	downloaded you know track packs and single songs so like to date one thousand
5351240	5356320	four hundred and eighty downloadable songs are available that's a lot of
5356320	5363240	music but at any rate like I said it was developed by a harmonics post guitar
5363240	5370880	hero and red octane and made the the it looks like red octane was making the
5370880	5377280	peripherals but yeah we never soft took over development of guitar hero well
5377280	5381040	harmonics had to go somewhere I had to do something and so they started in
5381040	5384560	February 2006 working with different designers for prototyping the
5384560	5389560	instruments for developing an all-new hardware bringing in things like your
5389560	5395840	drum support and they just kept working on it from there and it ended up being
5395840	5404320	you know such a big hit like I said we've got so many so many other
5404320	5411160	peripherals and it's so many other releases that it just just really moved
5411160	5416800	right along they did have licensing fees for using some of the wireless
5416800	5424000	technology especially for Microsoft and if they had chosen to pay for it they
5424000	5426880	would have actually released the different versions at different costs
5426880	5434880	so they used wired technology to start off with it so so anyway yeah it's got
5434880	5442360	a massive online community at rock band calm and now I mean remember we used to
5442360	5448160	help out with them loud the charity event where you basically play rock band
5448160	5455640	on stage I used to do some of the graphics but it was I mean there's all
5455640	5462560	these like weird special editions too like there's Green Day and I think there
5462560	5468960	was Beatles rock band that was a big deal but you know as it came out you
5468960	5475720	know they also were learning that of course some of the guitars from other
5475720	5479920	games were incompatible for example the Gibson Les Paul guitar controller that
5479920	5485720	came with guitar hero 3 was not compatible with rock band even though
5485720	5491880	harmonics said that they had an open controller support but basically
5491880	5495720	harmonics and Activision we're just pointing fingers back and forth harmonics
5495720	5505280	put out a patch Activision blocked it so who's the bad guy here and then but
5505280	5508920	Activision then announced that guitar hero world tour would use the rock bands
5508920	5518600	instruments and just drama at any rate though rock band was very highly
5518600	5525880	received for most of the American reviewers you didn't get a score under a
5525880	5532360	nine on that scale or a five stars or an a so they were all very excellent won so
5532360	5538080	many awards best multiplayer experience innovation awards across the board best
5538080	5545960	music game and Xbox magazine said best reason to move to a bigger house award
5545960	5551640	this I mean this game really was like it was just so like like transformative I
5551640	5555560	mean between you really have to kind of co-credit this and like a tar hero and
5555560	5558920	just you know with the whole like plastic instrument revolution and sure
5558920	5562080	those of us that have been music game fans a little bit longer such as you
5562080	5566040	know us here at OLR and some of our longtime listeners obviously we remember
5566040	5569640	what was about guitar freaks and importing the stuff from Japan the beat
5569640	5573360	media 2dx controllers and things like that but Konami and you know we talked
5573360	5577680	about this ad nauseum in our first 180 episodes Konami was never willing to
5577680	5581240	really take that risk with the US audiences until it was too late the
5581240	5584000	Japanese arm of the company was too fucking stubborn even though the
5584000	5587920	American side was telling him do it do it do it they were too fucking stubborn
5587920	5591400	until I think it was really too late to hit the momentum on that and then by the
5591400	5595920	time they finally did get it on it it looked like a fucking knockoff of this
5595920	5599840	because it was rock revolution when Konami finally got it was just a bad
5599840	5606240	fucking version of this so you know it was it was really guitar hero 2 probably
5606240	5609560	in many ways I would say and then like this as a definitely follow-up with
5609560	5613400	charter 3 that really kind of like pushed that plastic instrument
5613400	5620080	revolution and just started music gaming in the u.s. well there also did have
5620120	5626720	effects on the actual music industry their Viacom was saying that it was
5626720	5632480	averaging the sale of 1 million downloadable songs every nine days and
5632480	5638520	for example Motley Crue's single Saints of Los Angeles debuted as a rock band
5638520	5646280	track the same time that the album released some of the tracks that were
5646280	5651720	specific to rock band actually ended up being later on we released for example
5651720	5656880	Rush's alternate working man only which one of my favorite songs ever we
5656880	5661360	actually like ran out of video and that was some guy playing a 10-minute song
5662360	5667080	but in any way the alternate version of working man that was released only for
5667080	5673400	rock band was so well loved that Rush released that version as a download
5673400	5679000	through iTunes and started making some of their albums available like moving
5679000	5685840	pictures was was released in the game two months after all this so I really
5685840	5689520	want to go back and play again on my Xbox one because I have rock band for on
5689520	5692960	Xbox one but like I remember I was having a lot of problems getting the
5692960	5696560	instruments connecting like weird shit was happening and I got so frustrated I
5696560	5700840	just stopped but for me the real peak of the rock band series for me was rock
5700840	5704480	band three because I love the keyboards I'm like the one person that loved the
5704480	5708880	keyboards that was so awesome and I wish I wish the keyboard thing had taken off
5708880	5713520	more mmm I was just reading about some of the litigation with Gibson guitar and
5713520	5723520	Konami's lawsuit and everything oh sure yeah but I mean basically a Viacom did
5723520	5727760	a counter suit against Konami saying that rock band improves on Konami's
5727760	5732640	original patent and that rock revolution used controllers are similar
5732640	5738120	to rock band so they both settled and there you go there you go I also want to
5738120	5742320	give a shout out for rock band blitz I wish they had made that one backwards
5742320	5748400	compatible 360 there's also mention of frets on fire oh yeah when the like a
5748400	5757720	computer yeah and then of course we had you know coming out of
5757720	5761720	that there was rock Smith to where you actually could play a real guitar that
5761720	5766800	was much different it was but I don't know how much laid off the concept yeah
5766800	5770120	I don't know how much I can say but I know somebody who worked on that game so
5770120	5775600	and so do you know yeah I'm saying that I don't know that it would be out oh
5775600	5780000	yes you're not for oh yeah definitely definitely like again it's all about
5780000	5785720	that risk right nobody would have taken a risk on a game like rock Smith if rock
5785720	5790480	band and guitar hero too hadn't like put it out there there was that and I'm
5790480	5793600	sure somebody asked that question well you know everybody's fake jam it why
5793600	5796840	don't we teach people how to play a real guitar why we do this for real maybe
5796840	5800520	there's a way and that's what rock Smith dead well and on top of that though in
5800520	5804360	the later releases of rock band you had the pro modes where they had the
5804360	5807520	guitars and the keyboard I love the cute because you really were playing the
5807520	5810840	keyboard parts if you played it in pro yeah it's pretty cool yeah it was
5810840	5815280	awesome but Bobby talking about rock band blitz they only had the music
5815280	5818160	licenses for a couple years for the songs they ended up delisting rock band
5818160	5823160	blitz it's I look Robin blitz was just it was all the DLC you already had for
5823160	5828240	rock band but then you played it in like an amplitude kind of game and I loved it
5828240	5833360	so cool so all right there it is your classic game of the week rock band one
5833360	5836800	of the greatest all-time classics really especially for us music game fans love
5836800	5840020	it that's the type of game that brought us all together and so I'm assuming were
5840020	5842600	they playing this a California extreme did it get you kind of thing oh yeah you
5842640	5846600	said they're playing on stage right yeah but I didn't play but you I saw it along
5846600	5853640	with it though yeah because they you know started singing the cure I also did
5853640	5859040	karaoke this last week cuz that's my fun stage I'm just singing it at the vendor
5859040	5864080	booth no but I did real karaoke I met up with some of my friends in Chicago we
5864080	5868760	went out to one of the bars for karaoke it was fun I was basically show me show
5868760	5873520	me show me how you do that song that's one of my favorites but I was singing it
5873520	5877960	over there and some kid was looking over just grinning it was pretty funny mm-hmm
5877960	5885320	you were singing classic rock all right let's move on let's get into some rapid
5885320	5888400	fire news and quickly travel around the world with some other headlines and
5888400	5892840	what's going on in gaming so Loki won't start us off all right so we've got a
5892840	5898240	couple things here so one it's a little bit of a preview of what we can expect
5898280	5903520	from gamescom which is just around the corner supposed to take place on August
5903520	5908080	20th through the 24th and thq Nordic is apparently gonna have some new games to
5908080	5913320	announce as well as showing off some additional things including their remake
5913320	5918400	for destroy all humans they also have a remake for spongebob squarepants battle
5918400	5923600	for bikini bottom a rehydrated and apparently the strategy game of
5923600	5931080	desperados 3 and Darksiders Genesis but they're supposed to be announcing also
5931080	5934560	new games as well during that time so I guess we'll have to wait and see what
5934560	5938760	that is thq Nordic I'm hoping that one of those is a no-saints program but you
5938760	5944000	know I'm I'm highly skeptical that gonna be something in the same universe ages
5944000	5949400	of mayhem 2 yes that game really was not terrible enough and we have to make a
5949400	5954400	sequel to make it even worse and then finally this is kind of cool grand theft
5954400	5961800	auto 3 Liberty City may remember that game that's pretty old but now you can
5961800	5967480	actually play in the Liberty City map from grand theft auto 3 in beam and G so
5967480	5973040	for those not aware of what beam and G is it is a physics based driving game
5973040	5977760	which basically you kind of do whatever you want in it but mostly it's to crash
5977760	5981960	your car in very unique ways but now you can crash your car in very unique
5981960	5986840	ways all over the map of grand theft auto 3 and it looks awesome and of
5986840	5992000	course it's not something that you can necessarily download and via the
5992000	5999080	official like mod repositories but there's a thread in their forum on beam
5999080	6003480	and g.com so go check it out there and it looks awesome I don't know if I don't
6003480	6007400	think I have beam ng but I've seen lots of videos of people playing it I do want
6007400	6013840	to probably pick it up now all right moving on to a hackers gonna hack story
6013840	6018520	because we love these around here at olr this has to do with somebody getting
6018520	6022480	Android running on the switch that's right XDA are the homebrew developers
6022480	6027760	that have just released an Android firmware for the Nintendo switch it's a
6027760	6034400	8-point Android 8.1 lineage OS 15.1 I don't I don't do enough Android no idea
6034400	6038360	what that is um but I'm assuming just one of the operating systems one of the
6038360	6041600	older ones probably not one of the newest ones and so compatible models
6041600	6045360	will do it there are of course it's buggy it's got battery life issues some
6045360	6049120	of the rotation some sensitive touchscreen input but everything in
6049120	6053720	there otherwise would work so basically it will turn your switch into an Android
6053720	6056880	tablet with a pair of controllers this is something you're basically flashing
6056880	6061240	the firmware on your switch to be this so you're losing your Nintendo switch so
6061240	6066200	you know only if you really really really are into fucking with your
6066200	6070600	hardware do you want to do something like this apparently it is based on
6070600	6076440	androids a division that works with the Nvidia shield TV so some things on the
6076440	6080720	Tegra like Borderlands and Half-Life 2 will actually run on this not to say
6080720	6086280	they run well but they run so very interesting with that that's a big big
6086280	6091200	console mod going on there so yeah again I would not do this for shits and
6091200	6095120	giggles unless you really know what you're doing with this type of modding
6095120	6099440	because you're likely gonna lose access to being able to play Mario maker and
6099440	6105320	things like that anyway let's talk about a story on Facebook instant games
6105320	6110000	because they are going to be kind of going away kind of not really so instant
6110000	6113240	games on Facebook started in the newsfeed and then they went to groups and
6113240	6117120	the light app and I believe they went into the messaging app you could play
6117120	6120320	games like pac-man and stuff with friends I know I've done that before
6120320	6124760	but not in a long time I think it was one of those things were like oh I
6124760	6127520	played pac-man with somebody on messenger okay I'll never need to do
6127520	6131040	that again in my entire life like I don't think I really got into the thing
6131040	6135000	in the Facebook gaming thing was also a little weird to me because like oh you
6135000	6139220	can play these things on an app in your phone and most of them are just apps you
6139220	6143080	can download on your phone and play there you know I mean if I wanted to
6143080	6148520	play pac-man I could just download the pac-man app for my phone right but for
6148520	6151480	whatever reason you know some people wanted to do the Facebook messenger
6151480	6155640	gaming because excuse me probably some more of the social features and things
6155640	6160620	like that well games are gonna be moving out of the messenger app they will be
6160620	6165360	moving into the Facebook gaming tab global director of games partnerships
6165360	6171000	Leo Aleb said quote starting later this summer instant games will no longer be
6171000	6175640	playable directly in the new version of messenger on iOS to ensure a smooth
6175640	6179640	transition players and messenger will continue to access games through thread
6179640	6184680	updates and chat bots while gameplay itself will app switch to Facebook quite
6184680	6191400	honestly this all sounds terrible so I just is there a Facebook game I'm
6191400	6194040	missing out on is there something I should be playing I don't know I blocked
6194040	6197360	all of those notifications so probably not
6197360	6202120	it's Farmville still a thing I don't know too I wonder if my ex is still
6202120	6206640	jamming to the Farmville soundtrack all these years later I have no idea I don't
6206640	6212120	know which one was this all right okay so and a pot of podcast listeners in
6212120	6215960	chat want me to correct on the Android story apparently you are running it off
6215960	6221000	a micro SD card you are not actually overriding your switch data I apologize
6221000	6224360	I must have misinterpreted because they were talking about that you may be kind
6224360	6227320	of screwing up your system to be able to play some of the other games later on
6227320	6234360	so I apologize if I misrepresented that but I I still would I still would
6234360	6238080	venture with this shit with caution if you really want to run an Android thing
6238080	6241920	how about you just buy an Android tablet they're not that expensive they're
6241920	6246640	cheaper than a switch but that's but I also the earlier in the day or earlier
6246640	6250480	in the show I said but isn't that reddit where everybody runs doom on all this
6250480	6258480	different shit hilarious so I get the appeal I do I do anyway back to the
6258480	6264320	Facebook story kaijuto says my ex loved that Facebook MMO game forgot the name
6264320	6266880	of it Oh Farmville she had me in her auction
6266880	6273480	room watching her watching her seller stuff it was fun metal man has them
6273480	6277520	metal mayhem says I don't give two shits about Facebook games to be honest if I
6277520	6281800	were to play a game it'd be one of my games from steam or good old games good
6281800	6286640	plug so I think it's it's safe to say pixel shits will not be coming to
6286640	6290040	Facebook Messenger or Facebook instant or whatever the fuck they're calling it
6290040	6295480	now anytime soon anyway who wants to play games on Facebook anyway you know
6295480	6300080	the only game I'm playing for a while mind games do you remember though that
6300080	6308080	Sims on Facebook yes I vaguely played there what's right there was like a Sim
6308080	6313360	and it was thing yeah like 2d and not 3d yeah no I totally remember it that thing
6313360	6317640	was nuts that was yeah okay and then like this pet game but that those weren't
6317640	6321480	like things within the app that was kind of the precursor that those games were
6321480	6326200	also on Google Plus games when that one and only game I played on Facebook that
6326200	6332560	I had to suffer through was a stupid goddamn garage sale game part of that
6332560	6336760	fucking ready player one challenge that is the only fucking game I ever played
6336760	6340320	on there and that was enough to sour me off of the whole fucking platform I
6340320	6343800	remember that dark to see you says I was kind of addicted to the civilization
6343800	6346520	port for a little while I remember that that's right there was like a
6346520	6350800	civilization game on Facebook I did words with friends a lot yeah yeah sim
6350800	6357240	social that was it pixel pockets anyway that's enough about that dark soccer
6357240	6361560	what do you have for rapid-fire news certainly not pixel shit right now sorry
6361560	6367920	why we are the original game that we got as monster rancher in Japan it was
6367920	6376440	monster farm is getting a re-release in Japan the there is a teaser website up
6376440	6384680	for it but koi Tecmo has released the thing on their Twitter and it's looking
6384680	6388640	kind of cute you know it's funny is that I almost picked up a monster farm
6388640	6395560	yesterday because I my I'd never played monster rancher so I was thinking about
6395560	6402040	getting it but I didn't but there's in the translation of this hold on let me
6402040	6409560	get the translation pulled up it says oh my god why is this being slow
6409560	6413920	basically it's saying that it's going to be released on an unannounced platform
6413920	6421360	in 2019 and they used the word high sheen which typically indicates a digital
6421360	6425760	release so it could either be it's a digital only console PC title or
6425760	6433480	smartphone so and then in other news that I don't know if this makes me
6433480	6440200	excited it could but Sega of Japan has filed a trademark for Knights dream wheel
6440200	6444760	thinking that it could be another game in the Knights franchise it would be
6444760	6450320	really nice if it did but it didn't spell Knights with a special spelling of
6450320	6456280	Knights so it could be something else but if it's a if it's a a new Knights
6456280	6459840	game I would be quite happy I'm surprised that isn't something they've
6459840	6466480	revisited recently why not we're getting a lot of the other stuff like we night
6466480	6470280	there was a wee night's game I remember that a wee little night's game but yes
6470280	6473200	there's that and then of course Panzer Dragoon I think is the other kind of big
6473200	6478360	one that I remember at e3 this year is pretty big deal so it'd be cool yeah
6478360	6481480	all right well let's move on and travel around the world and check out some
6481480	6485400	release dates and some video games coming out soon near you not a whole lot
6485400	6489800	this week we've got mutant year zero road to Eden deluxe edition on Nintendo

6510840	6515880	now get in the car let's go on the PlayStation 4 this week on August 1st we
6515880	6520720	have a game called labyrinth life sadly I don't believe this game stars stars
6520720	6525840	David Bowie I think it's probably an anime based game they talk about a faint
6525840	6531320	in agony flowering system interesting but it already know right yeah and I
6531320	6534880	guess it also does some rock-paper-scissors type of battle and oh
6534880	6539160	it looks like you can change the bus sizes on your characters well that oh
6539160	6543920	yeah I think yeah I've heard this was a game I think that was it's only wasn't
6543920	6549360	bringing over to the West because of they had like some of these I don't know
6549360	6552380	if this is the same game series but they had one where you basically have to
6552380	6557440	breed these like princesses or whatever they rescue or something like that
6557480	6562440	there's some weird shit now they all right well if labyrinth life is your
6562440	6567280	thing you enjoy that it's this week um also coming out of Japan this week crash
6567280	6571000	team racing nitro fueled gets its Japanese release I know we've had it
6571000	6574640	here for a little bit but is finally on its way out in Japan this week and if we
6574640	6579040	want to go over to the Nintendo switch Oh mega labyrinth life comes out on the
6579040	6585440	switch all right where you can make some Omega anyway also we've got a game
6585440	6590680	called the same crash team racing is also out in Japan and the air conflicts
6590680	6595360	collection gets a release on the switch this week and I feel like we just had
6595360	6600400	no this is okay no this is not like an arcade shooter this is a game with air
6600400	6606880	conflict secret wars and air conflicts Pacific carriers in one pack so if you
6606880	6612480	are you know cuz the airplane simulator games are pretty popular overseas so if
6612520	6618200	you want that you can have that dark Sakura how about the UK in the UK we
6618200	6624800	don't really have very many either what is coming out on the 29th which is I
6624800	6631080	guess already the 29th right now there is FIA European truck racing
6631080	6636640	championship and there's mutant year zero Road to Eden the deluxe edition and
6636640	6643560	then on August 1st is Madden NFL 20 so they go back to labyrinth life a little
6643560	6649560	bit I just I'm just I'm just gonna read this one I mean basically you kind of
6649560	6653000	get the gist of the game anyways but they said it apparently if you expand
6653000	6658880	your bus with every fallen foe mighty memories lead to great greater power
6658880	6663120	defeating foes builds up your Omega power in the chest increasing bus size
6663120	6667200	and parameters they go all the way to a Z cup this is a Nintendo switch game by
6667200	6678760	the way and apparently is coming out in the u.s. on August 1st so that is that
6678760	6683800	is another that is another game that is coming out is it really yes it is are
6683800	6688720	you gonna do a let's play a live stream no it's 60 bucks not paying for that but
6688720	6699880	Z cups Loki oh wow you know what what I think that that's so terrible that's not
6699880	6704080	even funny anymore when I know people who have had breast reductions for that
6704080	6709640	kind of pain that it would cause I don't think that a part of the body should be
6709640	6716320	fetished I really don't I'm just getting so sick of it we're not objects all right
6716320	6721240	I mean and I'm not saying it's right but are you really surprised I should be
6721240	6724800	surprised is the thing I really should be surprised I don't even know what I'm
6724800	6729720	looking at here we and I really don't want to know whether fictional or not
6729720	6734200	bodies need to be respected it's just fucking stupid I don't know what that is
6734200	6740800	not here to glorify your fucking hormones Bobby Black Wolf in chat says
6740800	6744600	Nintendo is kitty because you know Nintendo is a kids company they only put
6744600	6751240	out kids games we all know that's the case of course let's see yeah some folks
6751240	6757240	in chat saying excuse me Z cup yeah anyway podculture says there is such a
6757240	6762640	thing as too much of a good thing anyway let's move on can we please go to the
6762640	6766600	mailbag so every week you guys email us participate at orange lounge radio.com
6766600	6771640	and we read our favorite emails live on air did we get any emails this week um
6771680	6776080	yeah we actually got a really interesting little email that apparently
6776080	6783240	they recorded you masturbating Rob how does it go what important where you have
6783240	6789440	been recorded masturbating and the M is an upside down W so it's a spam message
6789440	6793360	this something yes okay been washed we have to reading wow I was
6793360	6801600	waster baiting I'm not even opening it and of course I'd tell you the the from
6801600	6807000	who is anonymous hacker okay anonymous hacker caught me waster baiting here
6807000	6812640	like here in the OLR studio or like somewhere else in the house like do they
6812640	6821600	like was it was it professor plum in the conservatory with the Crisco
6823360	6827920	I'm not gonna play this game anymore so that means since we got no real emails
6827920	6832440	it's drag race talk what is there to talk about drag race drag race isn't on
6832440	6838080	right now but I saw a funny meme okay this is every time a Republican is
6838080	6842640	caught with another man a drag queen gets her heels oh because there's yet
6842640	6846280	another one that got like was caught on Grindr or something yeah just today I
6846280	6853240	was seeing that going around yeah it's like why be so hateful unless you just
6853280	6860600	hate yourself mm-hmm just just get fucked in the ass you'll feel better no
6860600	6867720	I'm serious all these closeted Republican shitholes now now we're gonna
6867720	6874040	get another email about you beating off that Pikachu so please stop just hear me
6874040	6887640	out hear me out this is why we don't have a lot of yours no no just just hear
6887640	6896080	me out I don't think a man has to identify as gay to sometimes have gay
6896080	6901200	moments you know you can be bisexual there's no problem with it being bi is
6901240	6906760	valid but if you're this repressed you're this repressed because you've
6906760	6911520	been denying yourself or you're doing it and you hate yourself just get fucked in
6911520	6916600	the ass and be open about it stand up there and go you know what I like it I'm
6916600	6919320	not gonna say it cuz someone's gonna clip me saying it and I don't like any
6919320	6930280	of it but just say getting fucked in the ass is okay use your enema wear a condom
6930320	6938120	and get fucked in the ass do it safely people who matter will not think any
6938120	6942280	less of you for it welcome everybody to the voice of geeks Network where every
6942280	6948840	geek has a voice dark soccer has chosen to use hers for a significant purpose
6948840	6956000	tonight well honestly enough it's why I became a sister take the stigma out of
6956000	6959320	it the moment that no one gives a shit that you're getting fucked in the ass is
6959320	6965720	the moment that you don't have to hide I mean fucking a people I'm I'm in super
6965720	6974080	literally is what it is I'm just saying if people stopped having such a big
6974080	6981760	conniption fit over it and just I'm gonna stop explaining it shouldn't have
6981760	6985640	to be explained you if you like if you like it in the but you should be able to
6985640	6999440	have it just saying what what back that ass up just saying Rob do you need
6999440	7011600	another drink shall we all right so speaking of getting fucked in the ass
7011600	7018000	Nintendo has been really hard on people not being able to upload lots of
7018000	7022600	different levels for Mario maker 2 and so because of that now they're gonna be
7022600	7027560	increasing the cap from 32 to 64 and they said that also they're gonna be
7027560	7031880	increasing that upload limit one more time so we don't know when that's gonna
7031880	7035360	happen but sometime in the future you may be able to upload more than 64
7035360	7039440	levels which I don't understand why they're limiting everybody to do that
7039440	7045960	but just in case if you think that you know your levels being deleted because
7045960	7050760	you may be doing some exploits in the game are safe offline you are sorely
7050760	7055680	mistaken so apparently of course like the first Mario maker people have been
7055680	7059360	exploiting different glitches in the game to do all sorts of crazy stuff one
7059360	7063880	of these is actually how to create a black hole in Mario maker 2 which allows
7063880	7068080	you to put objects on top of each other that aren't supposed to be layered that
7068080	7073320	way so you can kind of create these really crazy fire bars and different
7073320	7082600	overlapping terrain including pipes and whatnot have the moon appearing in
7082600	7086920	daytime levels and all sorts of crazy stuff the game will know that you're
7086920	7089680	doing that of course and it will actually say that corrupt data has been
7089680	7093320	found in your course has been deleted or just won't let you save the game because
7093560	7098560	there's corrupt data as well and so unfortunately you know those crazy
7098560	7102160	levels that people might be able to make with these exploits aren't gonna be a
7102160	7111800	thing because they have patched in ways to detect those which is unfortunate but
7111800	7117560	hey you know the level caps gonna be up to 120 probably someday or more I don't
7117560	7120440	know why there's even a cap on the number of levels you can put out there
7120440	7124320	anyways who cares like you can't tell me people that would just upload
7124320	7130160	garbage but how are you gonna discover that garbage I guess it gets thrown into
7130160	7134240	your feet or whatever but like the level size the download of that I mean the
7134240	7138080	storage space has got to be so minimal I can't imagine why we would even limit
7138080	7141440	that stuff little big planet doesn't do that and you can do all sorts of crazy
7141440	7147880	shit in that why why even limit Mario maker I don't know that's the thing you
7147880	7150920	haven't picked up Mario maker too yet have you I have are you making any
7150920	7155040	levels um I haven't gotten to play it yet because my kids have been playing it
7155040	7158160	I haven't made any levels yet that's the one thing I'm missing so I should have
7158160	7160880	I should have tried like making a level one on the airplane but I just I
7160880	7166800	probably will at some point mm-hmm all right anyway Bobby with the clerk's
7166800	7175120	jokes in there we have 37 viewers in a row anyway
7175120	7180040	moving on maybe something you want to make in Mario maker is your own pole
7180040	7183360	position inspired level I don't know I had no other transition and I figure it
7183360	7187880	was better than the last one pole position somebody has remade this in 3d
7187880	7195880	yeah I saw that yeah and they Rob what's wrong because I was about to read the
7195880	7206120	name of it and you know it's called hmm PP engine yes pole position engine so
7206120	7211880	it's a it's a PP engine is a three-year Rob definitely needs an adult this
7211880	7216840	episode yeah you know Bobby said try not to
7216840	7222240	masturbate on your way to the car on my way to playing some PP engine which is
7222240	7229040	a 3d remake of the night it's a 3d remake of the 1982 game pole position
7229040	7233440	Rob can't even which is what your PP stands for but it actually reverse
7233440	7239720	engineers all of the games code so it's actually following basically what you
7239720	7244320	would expect the cars and the AI to do but it's modern high-definition graphics
7244320	7249520	as in crashing every time you get on a curve yeah yes and all the all the like
7249680	7254040	lame-looking billboards that go by and the little explosions and all of that
7254040	7259480	yeah Jonathan Thomas on reddit said I started back in 2013 my god that's six
7259480	7263320	years ago reverse some people do podcasts for 17 years some people spent
7263320	7267760	six years on their PP engine I started back in 2013 reverse engineering the
7267760	7271400	code from the original arcade ROM with the help of the main debugger and some
7271400	7275480	primitive self-made tools to analyze instruction traces and create assembly
7275480	7278680	source files that could be assembled back into the original arcade ROM
7278680	7281720	following this I worked through the assembly source file to produce a
7281720	7285600	portable c-based library containing the game logic for pole position this
7285600	7289560	library was used in two projects the one you see here and another project to
7289560	7294400	convert pole pole position to the Atari st a 16-bit computer that was released
7294400	7300800	in 1985 I mean this is like on one hand I'm like what a colossal waste of time
7300800	7304440	but on the other hand I'm like this is actually like really cool it's like the
7304440	7310000	most authentic way to remake like an old game but just like put new graphics
7310000	7314040	on it like they they didn't just like remake it with new programming languages
7314040	7318000	that emulated like I thought that they went in and like did it from the code so
7318000	7321840	that's that's pretty cool now you actually don't you have a pole position
7321840	7325320	cabinet or you did like that became your main cabinet or am I mixing it up with
7325320	7328960	something yeah we had a pole position and sure me moved into it remember mm-hmm
7328960	7332560	because it was missing the pedal so sure me decided it was her new cat mansion
7332560	7337160	mm-hmm but yeah we put a meme in that at one time and then I don't remember we
7337160	7342240	sold it and then did other things now Bobby Blackwell would like to point out
7342240	7348000	in our chat room at least he completed his racing game unlike some people well
7348000	7357800	took him six years to do it I got time all right anyway let's move on we have a
7357800	7361120	few more stories for you guys and then we're gonna get to our discord segment
7361120	7363960	which I think I accidentally left off the show role but we will get to
7363960	7368800	discord if you want to give us a call over at vog network or vognetwork.com
7368800	7372360	slash discord but first dark soccer I think you have another kind of like
7372360	7376800	video game study thing I do because I like to bring something about science
7376800	7381920	into this but there is a game called driving XC which you can find at
7381920	7388920	driving XC calm for $39 it's available also as a digital download for I guess
7388960	7396120	they mean Xbox one and ps4 but it's a game that helps new drivers learn how to
7396120	7403400	drive and on top of that in one of the interviews on here the father of the teen
7403400	7409040	says it's actually helped him become a better driver that after having pay
7409040	7413640	attention you know to watching his daughter play it that he started
7413640	7418640	becoming a more careful driver so basically it's drivers ed the game and
7418640	7423960	the guy behind it is named Bob Davis he was making the large-scale car
7423960	7428200	simulators like you did you ever have the simulators in your high school for
7428200	7436520	drivers ed no we had that use like a film strip to drive with and the
7436520	7439920	simulators were terrible this is like also like from the 60s it was pretty bad
7440120	7445680	but this guy's been making the simulator since 2005 and so his driving
7445680	7453120	essentials is to help be an interactive driving simulator for teens that they
7453120	7458040	could do on their own and so it's actually apparently been helping kids
7458040	7461560	learn to drive better as ten different lessons starting with the basics and
7461560	7467360	take you through different driving scenarios so that it gives you you know
7467360	7471840	it makes you more aware when you're ready for your driving test and there's
7471840	7476760	even a level where you have a phone and it forces you to look at it so you can
7476760	7480680	see what distracted right distracted driving can do is even if you're at a
7480680	7486840	stoplight looking at your phone can still cause an accident so just saying
7486840	7492000	it's really really good way to get people prepared and like I said her dad
7492000	7496120	said that it was really making him a more conscious driver too and you can
7496120	7503880	get this at driving X e.com interesting you think they're using video games and
7503880	7506760	more and more in the driver's ed type stuff I don't remember why we didn't do
7506760	7510360	that type of stuff I feel like I feel like we were all prepping to take a test
7510360	7514080	and it's like you took that test so that you could take like basically you take a
7514080	7519120	driver's ed course through a private thing at 15 and a half I think or some
7519120	7522320	like that was when you could do that the only thing is that it uses a standard
7522320	7526640	controller wheels and pedals are not supported but I think they should put in
7526640	7531480	driving wheel support you know because that's gonna just even add to the
7531480	7536160	experience I'm interesting perspective from dark Tetsuya in our chat room over
7536160	7540360	twitch TV slash vog network saying the doctors were convinced I shouldn't drive
7540360	7544560	so I've just been using video games to live vicariously very interesting
7544560	7549000	perspective there because you know some of us may not realize that oh yeah some
7549000	7552600	people aren't able to drive whether it's due to a medical issue a vision
7552600	7556720	issue you know whatever it is but when it comes to video games where you know
7556720	7559680	it's a it's a it's a controlled environment a fake environment not not
7559680	7564160	the real world you kind of get to you know experience that in a different way
7564160	7567800	and as much as we've been having a laugh at pole position and the acronyms later
7567800	7572600	or acronyms that come from it you know maybe that was the realistic simulator
7572600	7577160	in 1982 but certainly now today the technologies come so far that when you
7577160	7581280	play a game like a Gran Turismo or something it's it's so realistic you
7581280	7586780	know well I'll tell you I actually learned because I hadn't driven in a
7586780	7592560	while but I learned about over steering from playing Ridge Racer so just saying
7592560	7600200	you know I learned how to steer myself out of a drift in other games so you
7600200	7605200	know just applying some of the technique I mean yeah and I'd say you know
7605200	7612160	improving your hand-eye coordination too is also helpful so you know it's
7612160	7615440	funny Bobby Black Wolf I guess did some research into the pole position thing
7615440	7619000	turns out that game was either that little reimagine he hasn't been working
7619000	7622560	out for six years because that originally came out in January 2014 it's
7622560	7625160	just making its way around the gaming blogs again this week for whatever
7625160	7628720	reason whether it be to do a reddit post or something like that as these things
7628720	7632920	sometimes happen but you know here at OLR it's about what is out there in
7632920	7635960	gaming culture and if something gets rediscovered and is new all over again
7635960	7641080	it still qualifies so I mean I I had no idea it was a thing so it's still kind
7641080	7647920	of new maybe in 2019 they'll update it for VR who knows so anyhow let's move on
7647920	7652680	Loki story from you all right so it's another week so we have yet another
7652680	7659840	story of a epic epic game store exclusive so mech warrior 5 unfortunately
7659840	7666440	is being delayed it's now set for December of this year and it will be
7666440	7672800	epic game store exclusive as well so piranha games put out a press release
7672800	7676840	saying our partnership with epic game store allows piranha the opportunity to
7676840	7680680	make sure mech warrior 5 mercenaries meets our internal goal of creating the
7680680	7685360	best mech warrior game possible we want more money since we since we announced
7685560	7691240	the development of the first player mech war game in 17 years we have stated that
7691240	7695760	our goal was to deliver to fans mech warrior mercenaries experience with true
7695760	7700240	freedom of choice and being able to share that experience in a co-op setting
7700240	7707800	by true freedom of choice we do not mean storefronts of course so yeah it was
7707800	7713000	originally supposed to be coming out sooner and apparently though with that
7713000	7717240	if you had pre-ordered the game you will be able to request a full refund up
7717240	7723160	until September 1st hmm well so at least they're gonna do the refund thing that
7723160	7725880	as I'm sure some other recent controversies like Shenmue and all that
7725880	7730680	stuff the one that gets me though is the whole Tetris effect being exclusive on
7730680	7733720	the epic store but then if you want to play it in VR you have to have steam
7733720	7737000	because I don't think that is a requirement anymore for like the audience
7737000	7741520	Oculus version or something like that oh I thought it only went with the vibe and
7741520	7744960	so you had to have steam VR in order to be able to run yeah but yeah that is
7744960	7748880	funny this is kind of like one of those like this is it's really weird type of
7748880	7753480	thing yeah maybe it just also goes to show that you also maybe don't just
7753480	7758960	think of steam as a store I guess steam is I guess more than that at this point
7758960	7763360	now with the whole you know fact that there's maybe our drivers in it maybe it
7763360	7767320	shouldn't you know I don't know and Bobby says the oculus version runs steam
7767320	7771360	VR they didn't make it specifically for oculus last I checked steam VR runs on
7771360	7775320	oculus so they just did a one-size-fits-all hmm so yeah it's kind of
7775320	7778640	kind of interesting I mean I don't know like I kind of want to get Tetris effect
7778640	7782800	on PC but I I already have it on PlayStation I want to be able to play it
7782800	7787160	on like 4k though I think that seems like really cool but like I just feel
7787160	7790880	like nothing's gonna top the VR version I might wait for a sale I think that's
7790880	7793840	what I'll probably and ultimately end up doing but I do love Tetris effect that
7793840	7797560	game is so good if you guys haven't played it yet so good so but I just
7797560	7802480	don't see myself jumping into PC VR anytime soon I don't like I'm not the
7802480	7806240	level of enthusiasts that you know Bobby or even maybe Kai's you know or some
7806240	7811240	other of you guys that love your VR are at I'm kind of like I got PS VR it plays
7811240	7814440	enough it suits my needs I'm good for now I'm looking forward to the no man
7814440	7818680	sky thing which um you know cuz that's gonna get VR pretty soon I'm excited I
7818680	7822520	thought it already happened it's like any day now the beyond updates gonna be
7822520	7826300	out which I'm speaking what good timing hey Alan can I bug you to come on the
7826300	7831940	show please Alan is in this new pocket hi can you come on the show will you
7831940	7837260	come on the show yeah cuz I literally just brought something up that is kind
7837260	7841940	of like relevant to you and what you're doing um you've been playing a game a
7841940	7845220	lot recently we tell us the viewers a little bit about what you've been up to
7845220	7852220	I've been playing a lot of No Man's Sky I just wanted to see what the mod
7852260	7857780	community had done with it in addition to the updates that well apparently
7857780	7861780	unless this guy's completely full of shit was one mod that I'm using called
7861780	7866460	fantasy a lot of his work has actually been incorporated like he has a credit
7866460	7871380	in some of the patches because hello games has used his stuff he made a mod
7871380	7876420	to where you find a ruin and then if you use the thing that lets you dig into the
7876420	7880420	earth there's actually like like kind of like archaeology where you go under the
7880420	7883780	ground it's not just to find minerals but there's things you can find to sell
7883780	7888220	that are actually under that's a part of the base game now and he made a mod to
7888220	7893460	do that originally so I was out of town last week obviously on a business trip
7893460	7898100	so how many hours would you say you plants spent playing No Man's Sky where
7898100	7904500	I wouldn't be here to judge you I've started over a few times I would say
7904500	7909380	from the time you left I would say around 15 or 16 hours over the course of
7909380	7913260	the week so it's two or three hours a night I can't judge ask me how many
7913260	7923660	hours I've been on call for my larp so it's fine yeah well I still haven't
7923660	7935220	tried rez VR and you own that it's in the living room I just knew he'd been
7935220	7940340	playing No Man's Sky lately and it was kind of relevant so I didn't even think
7940340	7943260	about the modding community and what modding is probably done to that game on
7943260	7950700	PC I bet it's something so that's cool all right anyhow let's move on oh no I
7950700	7953860	want to say one more thing about the mech warrior thing so you're into like
7953860	7957260	the mech games is this something you're thinking about um yeah probably not
7957260	7961300	going to I used to play the like one of the mech warrior games a while back but
7961500	7967220	I've kind of got him out of it all right well you know I love these little mini
7967220	7970900	arcade cabinets that I have right in fact some of them are actually branded
7970900	7975620	the whole my arcade thing and I think there's one over there this burger time
7975620	7979940	one which isn't on cam but I'll go grab it here this burger time one is a my
7979940	7984860	arcade machine and they're actually putting out a new version of this so
7984860	7987980	there's gonna be something like this but I think it's gonna be a little bit
7987980	7991060	bigger and for those these are the ones that they have I think a target target
7991060	7995020	is where you can get these the my arcade things so actually and I should
7995020	8000260	try turning it on so you guys can really see what this looks like if I can
8000260	8003300	remember oh no the whole the whole bottom is the whole little like on
8003300	8009700	switch and then hopefully it'll come on here and mm-hmm so sorry I'm starting it
8009700	8012480	up here trying to show the folks on Twitch what it looks like but it's a
8012480	8016820	pretty it's a pretty faithful reinterpretation of like burger time a
8016820	8022700	lot of them are our console versions yeah they really are yeah so I think of
8022700	8026020	this like Coleco or I think it's probably a little beyond that actually I
8026020	8031900	know that the the Cubert one was very similar to the Coleco version with a
8031900	8038620	few little bit of graphical tweaks mm-hmm so this same company the my arcade
8038620	8042860	is going to be putting out a Namco museum mini player it's going to have
8042860	8048980	20 different games on it including you know you would expect pac-man pac-man 2
8048980	8052980	pac-mania but also some other interesting selections including dragon
8052980	8057380	spirit that one's pretty cool rolling thunder all three of them splatter house
8057380	8060460	both of those games so it's kind of interesting a little bit of a diverse
8060460	8064260	selection from Namco the screen on that it's going to be four and a quarter
8064260	8068140	inches so I think that's a bit larger it's probably twice the size of what I
8068140	8072820	just showed mm-hmm on the twitch stream so it's a lot larger and it has but it's
8072820	8076620	a more vertical screen so it will kind of be more like an iPhone type of shape
8076620	8080620	or an Android you know more like the vertical shape but at the four and a
8080620	8084420	quarter inches so it's gonna have 20 games in it and it's going to retail I
8084420	8090580	believe for $99.99 and it's on its way out right now you can get it on Amazon
8090580	8095380	and my arcade calm it is kind of expensive I mean well if you think about
8095380	8099500	that that little burger time thing I just showed on cam that was about 35 I
8099500	8106620	want to say maybe 30 no I think it was 30 and then the Walmart ones which is a
8106620	8111460	different series those are arcade classics those set me back about 20 a
8111460	8116240	pop so but I do think I do think that my arcade ones they're little you can see
8116240	8119820	they're a little fancier they're a little sturdier the screens a slight bit
8119820	8123380	bigger I think they're a slight better quality it's not that the arcade classic
8123380	8126780	ones are bad they're really not they're good too but I think the my arcade ones
8126780	8128900	are definitely like a better quality so it's interesting that they're kind of
8128900	8133260	taking this one step further with this Namco museum collection but you know
8133260	8136340	these things are these these retro collections and things are really
8136340	8141980	everywhere so now Tigerclaw points out some of the my arcade little cabinets
8141980	8145340	have a bunch of games on them and they're mostly ripoff games I think that
8145340	8149220	a stranger things thing we saw recently which had come up on the show yeah it's
8149220	8154700	one of those examples too and that one was a little bit cheap looking um metal
8154700	8158500	mayhem says is there any device out there where pac-man hasn't appeared on
8158500	8162100	by this point well if it wasn't on there voluntarily I'm sure somebody put it on
8162100	8171260	there for sure so anyway yeah so that's it my arcade of Namco museum I I'm
8171260	8174460	interested but I a hundred bucks is a lot of money especially for the retro
8174460	8177960	stuff but I want to get more of the little cabinets the single game
8177960	8182360	cabinets I love that there's stuff like wreck-it Ralph or I'm sorry fix-it Felix
8182360	8185160	is the game obviously wreck-it Ralph inspired I love that that is where he
8185160	8189880	needs his own game he does like along the lines of rampage mm-hmm and there's
8189880	8192600	another what there was another one that was like 70 bucks I saw a target that
8192600	8195440	had a bunch of stuff in it I think this might be the one Tigerclaws linking with
8195440	8198880	bad dudes and there's other stuff in there too that's it was like a Data East
8198880	8201420	collection yeah it's a Data East collection is exactly what it is and I
8201420	8203920	think bad dudes is kind of like the one that they put on the box because that's
8203920	8208360	one of the most recognizable games in it I still I still kind of want one of
8208360	8211760	those arcade 1up machines I still feel like that might be a thing I end up
8211760	8215600	getting myself for the holidays because I know one of our friends star soccer I
8215600	8219880	got one of those Star Wars ones over the weekend or at least ordered it and I
8219880	8222800	know they were talking in chat there might be other people interested in
8222800	8228440	getting the Star Wars one so yeah those things those things look really cool so
8228440	8233400	all right well at this point we are going to open up our discord for you
8233400	8238520	guys to give us a call and say hello if you want to join in the conversation you
8238520	8242800	can head on over to the green room on our discord server over at vog network

8247500	8251440	discord server if you are new to orange launch radio hey we would love to have
8251440	8254080	you on the show but tell us a little bit about what you want to call in tonight
8254080	8258200	in the orange lounge radio channel just so we know you're not troll okay we

8260880	8265640	we're making sure none of that toxicity makes it here to our little program so
8265640	8270200	our best we can I'm sure we can't avoid everything completely anyway let's get
8270200	8272840	to it I see somebody just joined the green room and we haven't had a call in
8272840	8276480	a while so let's get to it hi you are on orange launch radio who's this hey
8276480	8279920	what's going on everyone it's wrong though hey Rama is great to hear from
8279920	8284120	you what's on your mind tonight not much is great to hear you guys to see you
8284120	8289360	guys every week well hello hello to what to what you want to talk about tonight
8289360	8293640	all right so it was a couple things I want to talk about but I could save that
8293640	8299320	for another time but anything I want to talk about in regards to Nintendo
8299320	8306240	patching out Kristin Aussie's voice in Fire Emblem yeah what about that well I
8306240	8312400	will say this I mean it's no secret that I've been part of the anime cosplay
8312400	8317440	fandom for about 20 years and several of those years I've gotten friendly with
8317480	8325560	various voice actors and the sad part is his actions it's sort of been like sort
8325560	8331200	of not documented but well known it's like people around him knew this and the
8331200	8336800	thing is it just takes something big for everybody to come out of the woodwork to
8336800	8344600	point fingers at him for his actions now I do not condone what he did but I do
8344600	8352440	respect him in the way that he is going to do his best to make amends I look at
8352440	8359320	it this way um if you if you make mistakes it's up to you to own up and
8359320	8364600	redeem yourself so others can see it you've become a better person yeah I
8364600	8369200	think part of you know fixing mistakes though is kind of like accepting the
8369200	8375440	punishment like you know you did the crime do the time sort of thing right so
8375440	8379840	I mean I and I think this whole removal and and and shaming and so forth is kind
8379840	8385280	of a part of that it's true and I said this may have killed his career but
8385280	8391400	given how he made this long apology now it's not the first time I've seen
8391400	8395240	something like this right now there's something big going on in a community
8395240	8402040	with a million dollar lawsuit we'll just leave that that but if he's being
8402040	8406000	sincere about his actions and you know what he's he should get a second chance
8406000	8411400	if he's just saying it just to cover himself and save faith then you know
8411400	8418760	what you're done right no I and I can I can be open to that you know if you know
8418760	8421520	kind of accept the consequences which it sounds like you know I'm not following
8421720	8425440	this guy probably as closely but if he is accepting the consequences and doing
8425440	8430880	that and trying to be better from it then you know the whole idea of
8430880	8434920	rehabilitation is the first place is to get better and do better so as long as
8434920	8440080	the actions show that a person is doing better then I think there's room to
8440080	8446880	forgive that I guess or you know except that a person can change absolutely it's
8446880	8452640	just sad that it things like this come out this way it's like you make it big
8452640	8458320	then somebody from your past reminds you of something shitty you've done and you
8458320	8463160	never owned up to it it's sort of like the whole James Gunn thing with Guardians
8463160	8467840	of the Galaxy that he's owned up to what he's done frequently and then it keeps
8467840	8475280	coming back and he end up losing his job now he has his job back you know one I
8475280	8477800	think a lot of that was about how he kind of played that out in the public
8477800	8484400	eye too you know and that's why he's kind of back doing the film again so
8484400	8488320	interesting it has is he a big and I'm sorry I might have missed this is he big
8488320	8491280	in that like anime scene does he do voices there too is that how you kind of
8491280	8497960	know a little more about this yeah one of the voices he's known for is he is
8497960	8505920	Helios in Sailor Moon supers which is produced by this interesting okay didn't
8505920	8511720	know that you might know him by his alternate name on YouTube kerboffer I
8511720	8517200	don't watch enough YouTube stuff to know he's done various voices and then been
8517200	8522000	in backgrounds and various like tracks and stuff like that so I swear I kind of
8522000	8526600	know him so interesting all right well before I let you go anything else you
8526600	8531480	want to talk about tonight if I'm looking at the couch correctly do I see
8531480	8536760	a reference to the Golden Girls between Loki and Pikachu you do this is actually
8536760	8541600	a calendar that Loki got for Christmas and if you've been watching if you've
8541600	8545200	been paying attention on the stream we have updated it every month with the
8545200	8550160	latest month that we're on so this is July's picture which is again for the
8550160	8553480	sake of the podcast listeners I'm describing it a little bit it is Sophia
8553640	8558640	cooking up a dish and Blanche is looking on at it and the quote says if this
8558640	8562920	sauce were a person I'd get naked and make love to it and that was a Sophia
8562920	8570360	quote there you go I watched every single episode of that show when it was
8570360	8574960	on the air it's great I know a lot of like bros who watch Golden Girls it's
8574960	8582160	it's it's funny for everybody yes yes cuz let's be real most was watched it
8582160	8588720	for be Arthur anyway I always loved Betty White even at a young age so but
8588720	8592520	yes of course of course be Arthur I mean they were all great in their own ways so
8592520	8596680	it's interesting though how much merchandise and shit there is now with
8596680	8607120	all that be Arthur I'm on my wine break yes one of my favorite try to bullshit
8607120	8612840	one of my favorite be Arthur moments was from the Golden Girls and I just
8612840	8615760	will never forget this one is that you know where I think it's Betty White says
8615760	8620160	and where are you going and she goes to get ice cream or commit a felony I'm
8620160	8623160	gonna decide in the car
8624840	8631240	Blanche about homophobia oh yeah there's that yeah condoms rose condoms
8631240	8640000	condoms condoms yeah it was amazing moment too I remember it Sicily Golden
8640000	8644280	Girls are great on a future episode of olr we were just going to act out scenes
8644280	8647920	from the Golden Girls so I don't know what part Loki's gonna play but we'll
8647920	8651800	figure that out I think I think Loki kind of would be the Dorothy in this
8651800	8659980	situation I really do I'm definitely the Blanche probably of this group I think
8659980	8666700	our soccer would be Sophia you know what just go to SDCC and cosplay as the
8666700	8670900	Golden Girls and I'll stand behind you with a boom box playing to sound playing
8670900	8675620	at the theme song you would dark soccer you would definitely the one be the one
8675620	8684220	that would be like picture it Namco arcade mobile 1996 and then not give a
8684220	8692020	shit yes I'd say the dry things absolutely all right anyway all right
8692020	8694340	I'm gonna let you go Rama so we can squeeze in another call but they walk
8694340	8699860	out with my with my Walker good to hear it was always my friend right back at
8699860	8704340	you all right bye all right let's get to another call here on the show hello
8704340	8707620	you're on orange launch radio who's this
8707820	8712780	hello no hello hey this is that deaf sorry I had my
8712780	8716860	mute on that's okay sometimes I know we surprise you when we drag and drop you
8716860	8720740	on air what's on your mind tonight well I want to talk about something that
8720740	8730100	happened Mexico this week involving eSports a little back of a little
8730100	8737380	backstory there's this Federation eSports Federation in Mexico that was
8737780	8745540	initiated back in February if I remember correctly so it's like okay a big deal
8745540	8751940	so we can have like national teams support for for the eSports community
8751940	8758900	here in Mexico all good fast forward to this week they're starting their their
8758900	8766140	tournaments they're starting out to scout for national team members and they
8766140	8775820	start charging the around 600 pesos which is around I think let me get my
8775820	8782700	calculations almost correctly like $30 which isn't much but right the thing is
8782700	8789660	they are affiliated with the National Sports Committee in Mexico so they are
8789660	8797620	a civil association they cannot profit of any tournament or anything an event
8797620	8806220	they they're doing so it's like a really really bad situation for them and in in
8806220	8810140	especially because one of the tournaments they were they are holding
8810140	8817460	is for clash of clans or one one of the mobile games and supercell the developer
8817580	8824100	came out on Twitter and told them hey hey guys you cannot charge any any
8824100	8831340	amount of money for any of the participants so it yeah it was a really
8831340	8837580	really big deal this week in Mexico because of that and and actually one of
8837580	8843420	the under of the people one of the heads of famous which was just called came out
8843420	8849300	and said that yeah they didn't like expected this to happen because they do
8849300	8855380	need the money they they do have to pay for the train training for the for the
8855380	8860660	participants if they get selected they have to pay the trips they have to pay
8860660	8864940	everything involved for for the making of these tournaments so it's
8864940	8871660	understandable but they should have like came out of upfront about it it's like
8871700	8875980	the many people here and including myself we're kind of disappointed on
8875980	8883300	that and how they handle it because it's like really really like shady stuff be
8883300	8891140	all behind all I have talked about already where they try to make I was
8891140	8896380	just saying were they trying to make a claim about where the money was going at
8896380	8900260	the start when they actually announced the tournaments and all that stuff they
8900260	8907700	just they just said you have to be affiliated with them with famous and you
8907700	8913660	have to pay the 600 pesos they didn't say why they didn't say like oh we need
8913660	8919260	this to pay for for all the events and in all that all the other stuff that is
8919260	8924940	needed which is understandable but again they weren't clear about it and it was
8924940	8931220	like until like a few days ago I think Friday that an article popped out in an
8931220	8936580	interview they they made what up with a website here in Mexico that actually
8936580	8941980	like explain all that but again it's like way too late and many people are
8941980	8948460	like actually mad legit mad about it so it's understand again it's understandable
8948460	8953220	why they did it but they should have like been clear about it from the
8953220	8956380	beginning yeah especially when like the developers are probably sitting here
8956380	8959420	thinking these folks that are completely unaffiliated with us are making money
8959420	8962900	off of our games using our games in the promotion using our games to attract
8962900	8966340	people and then they're charging this fee for them and even if the fee is you
8966340	8970060	know pretty nominal you know three bucks is not a whole lot of money it's cheaper
8970060	8973500	than a grande at Starbucks and all is said and done but it's it's the
8973500	8981740	principle yeah actually $30 I think but again not not that big of a deal with
8981740	8987340	with the money involved but it's the thing that yeah even they got in trouble
8987340	8991980	kind of in trouble with supercell which is again the developer they came out and
8991980	8997020	you cannot charge these official rules for any official tournament it's like
8997020	9003740	you cannot charge any participant at all even like even if there's like an an
9003740	9009660	entry fee for the venue you cannot charge them that yeah it's a free entry
9009660	9014900	for any participant and they're also involved with overwatch not necessarily
9014900	9018860	League but the World Cup and also other games like the League of Legends and
9018860	9026660	others other games that are going like they have a World Cup basically huh
9026660	9030260	interesting well I'll be curious to kind of see if there's more that develops on
9030260	9033660	this if more companies kind of come out against it or if you know these guys
9033660	9038540	kind of reverse course on that or give a little more clarity to where these this
9038540	9041580	money is why they're collecting it where it's going or if they suddenly
9041580	9044300	make a big charitable donation or I'll be curious to kind of see where this
9044300	9051980	ends up yeah me too actually because again it I actually want to for them to
9051980	9060500	like do do good do better actually yeah because they're trying to get like games
9060500	9067260	officially recognized by the the International Olympics Committee they're
9067260	9074660	working really hard on it and but like this this kind of stuff is like kind of
9074660	9080220	disappointing if anything for sure for sure all right my friend I'm gonna let
9080220	9084180	you go so we wrap up the show but thank you thank you for the news from a place
9084180	9088100	we are you know an area where we aren't always paying attention all the time so
9088100	9091980	it's nice to hear from news from around the world hey thanks for having me good
9091980	9097820	like always no problem take care my friend yeah all right well there you go
9097820	9102340	that that's gonna do it I think for the call tonight which means we are about
9102340	9105980	oops I almost closed OBS I'm going to close discord we are about to the end of
9105980	9109680	another episode of orange lounge radio not bad for a week of news that was a
9109680	9112340	little bit slower although I should check in make sure we're low-key there's
9112340	9115860	no last-minute stories there's just one last thing I was gonna mention so the
9115860	9119940	Epic Games Store put out some new free games for the month and one of those was
9119940	9123500	a game called moon lighter which apparently someone spotted that there
9123500	9129140	was the enable cloud save function and which they'd come in that on Twitter
9129140	9133500	and Tim Sweeney responded with we've actually enabled cloud saves for a
9133500	9137140	couple of games right now but they'll be rolling out more so it's another
9137140	9140940	enhancement that they're finally adding to their storefront that they really
9140940	9144620	should have tried it for a while yeah something to try to kind of maybe
9144620	9148020	justify a lot more of those exclusives they're snapping up when people don't
9148020	9150680	really want to use their store so interesting interesting we'll see what
9150680	9155100	develops of that all right well we are gonna wrap up for the night I'm gonna
9155100	9158460	say as I always do thank you for tuning in and spending your night with us here
9158460	9161900	at orange launch radio we appreciate all of the support if you like what you
9161900	9165020	heard here at orange launch radio please tell a friend or two about the show help
9165020	9167740	us spread the word because we are the word where every we are the show where
9167740	9171220	every gamer has a voice but if the voices aren't here to air then what are
9171220	9176420	we gonna do so please tell a friend or two about the show and you know a nice
9176420	9182780	five-star review on a place like iTunes goes an awful long way also you can do
9182780	9188920	these auto hosts of vog network over on your twitch channel and whether you have
9188920	9193380	a hundred followers or one follower that stuff goes a long way towards
9193380	9196300	discoverability so please consider putting us on your auto host list that
9196300	9201420	would be fantastic otherwise I think I think that's all I've got to say and I
9201420	9204360	think we're ready to go around and get everybody's final thoughts we will be
9204360	9208000	back in seven days to do this all over again Bobby black wolf who airs live
9208000	9212080	before us at a voice keys Network will not be live next week he is off to a
9212080	9217200	convention called Gen Con which is very big on the board games I know so I'm
9217200	9219840	hoping he will get some video even if it's board games I'm sure he'll bring
9219840	9222980	back some video and I would think somewhere in that building there's some
9222980	9226000	video game representation so he'll probably get a little bit of that so
9226000	9231560	yeah there's gonna be that and yeah we look forward to seeing you guys next
9231560	9237080	week we will still be here on orange lounge radio at that time so dark soccer
