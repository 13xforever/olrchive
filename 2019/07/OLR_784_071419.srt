00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
This week teams plan to start bringing the Patsy into their Overwatch games. Someone who will cheat, stop the game they're losing, and spare their teammates the MMR loss.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
The cat and mouse game continues. This is just one pessimistic view of tonight's news. The rest of the discussion and happier news starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 784 for this July the 14th of 2019.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me here in studio say hello to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Sup?

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Sometimes on camera but sometimes not, it's her choice.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Sometimes I notice when part of my face is on camera and I lean back.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That's why I let you know where the boundary line is before we start.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Just show a little leg.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
My mostly covered leg with my cat socks.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Twitch after dark tonight. I hope I didn't violate the TOS. Sorry I didn't mean to.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Showing a little leg. Is that violating TOS on Twitch? I don't know.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
No.

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Anyway, please don't bust us.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Anyway, also joining us here in studio. Well he's showing a little leg in those shorts actually but I think it's off screen.

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Techmaster Loki.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
No it's all on screen.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Uh oh. Showing it all for the world to see.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
How scandalous. Showing knees on screen.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
A scandalo. How are you Loki?

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm fine.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So you got here to the studio a little late tonight. You were walking in during our little phone call with Bobby Blackwolf at the end there and I'm assuming it's dinner related.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That some incompetent person took too long to make your food right?

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
No I just left too late because I was making food at home and then I had to put away laundry before I left.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And then it just took too long so I ended up leaving like 20 minutes late.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Fucking chores ruin everything.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Well it's my own food. It's because tomorrow I start this thing at work. It's like a fitness health thing.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And so I had to make detox soup which is a fancy way of saying like it's got a bunch of vegetables in it.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Detoxing is bullshit. You have a liver.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I understand. I completely understand but it's just a vegetable soup is really what it is.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Okay so you're following up a vegetable soup with icycant that's like double bacon pizza.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's Sunday. It's not Monday. Monday is when I start so I am going to be detoxing from an extra bacon pizza.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You are doing the classic I'm going on a diet tomorrow. Therefore I'm going to eat like absolute shit today.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Oh I give myself more to work on.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I just think you're doing the Lord's work.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's just because I've got to weigh in tomorrow and the few pounds that are right about where I'm at now are really easy for me to lose.

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So it's just stacking the deck.

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Oh my God.

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So you're building gas.

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You're cheating the weight loss game. You're cheating at a weight loss competition at work. You're stacking the deck.

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I can't believe you're acting.

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
That's what I do with the meditation challenge at work.

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm acquiring mass.

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I play the meditation app and then I go just leave it on in the corner while I'm playing a video game.

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Wow.

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm not meditating.

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Am I the only one that takes these work challenges like can I actually do it. The last one we did at work was a step challenge.

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Oh I'm going to I'm going to take it serious. I'm just like you know I'm eating the pizza today because this is the only meal I've had so.

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Okay.

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The one thing I will not do is the close the rings challenge because that's bullshit. I don't close the rings on purpose.

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Every time I close my rings on my Apple Watch I get this thing from Rob.

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Hey well done.

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm like girl I just marched in pride.

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Wait did I.

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Oh yeah I know I do I do try to send those.

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Well OK. So OK.

60
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So those that aren't part of like the Apple Watch cult or whatever like you have these rings.

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
So you have one for if you stand 12 hours out of every day right.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You have another one for burning 500 calories in a day.

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Well that's my goal. I think you can set it whatever you want.

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Mine's at 500.

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And then you have another one for and she's shown them on our twitch TV because we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice geeks network vog network dot com.

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Middle one is my first one which I've done jack shit today.

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The network dot com at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So she's showing that off there on Twitch. But of course our audio only podcast is always free.

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But so yeah the rings one is for standing one is for calories the other one is for actual exercise and then you die in seven days.

70
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That one can be a little tricky because the watch has to kind of like detect that you're actually moving or like that your heart rate is up past a certain point.

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm not sure what it's detecting. It's like I don't know why it didn't trigger though when I was actually at pride because it did it when I was trucking around all over the Fillmore.

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yeah there's plenty of days where like I will burn like 750 calories like I'll smash my red circle goal and I have zero minutes of exercise.

73
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Yeah I'm like that every day. I put my my daily burn. I've done the calculation and I you know I put my daily limit for 550 although I'm about to bump it up to 600 because I've been easily surpassing that lately.

74
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But it's like but like right today I'm almost at that goal and my my green ring for a workout is like nothing. So what else.

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But anyway so if you're not in this Apple thing so you can follow friends on there and if a friend of yours actually closes all the rings you can like send a little message from your phone and generally they're pretty encouraging like hey you smash that goal or good for you or like applause emojis.

76
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But I found and what Melody and I do is that we actually send one of the like 20 percent that will show up that are like these complete bitchy remarks that you can reply with like one of them says oh did you miss the bus today.

77
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Like there's these really like mean things you can send. So Melanie and I have taken to sending those to each other when we smash goals and like sometimes I'll get a middle finger emoji back or something and it's fun.

78
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:11,000
See I don't use whatever is built into it because most of the time I'm replying from my phone. So I just make up my own snark. Yeah like girl I was just walking to the store and I'm in San Francisco it was uphill.

79
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Now I know it's a video game podcast but I think this is still on topic because this is the gamification of you know goals like exercise which I think we've kind of seen for several years.

80
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's just you know Apple has their own way of doing it with the watch. We've certainly seen other ways of like gamifying you know weight loss and that type of stuff before.

81
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Well there's like the RPG system from nerd fit where you level up based on your accomplishments because I used to do do that number.

82
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I remember some like nerd RPG thing that they showed it like gamer excellent year or something and some of us kind of got on that right after that and I think that might be what you're talking about.

83
00:06:50,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yeah but I'll be perfectly honest that for me I'm not competitive so I only share like with two people and that's like you and one of my co-workers because I'm not competitive and I don't want my health to be regulated to a competition.

84
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:23,000
That's and that's fair. You know your body your choice. But for me to have it set a certain goals that like I'm leveling myself up. That's certainly much easier to me. It makes a lot more sense for me to do this for myself as my own single player not MMO.

85
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You know you know how I am on an MMO anyway I just played by myself but excuse me I will say the gamification in some ways kind of works because like the the month and a half or so that I was going to the gym.

86
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I was going to the gym very regularly and I was closing my circles every single day and that was right up until I left for Chicago and I actually lost I probably lost a good like 10 pounds in a month.

87
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Now I would say I've gained a good chunk of it back because I kind of fell out of the habit after I won a vacation I came back and then I started doing other things.

88
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I've been playing that other game I've talked about on previous episodes has been taking up a lot of my free time and like I have to rush home to do things because of time zones and stuff.

89
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So I've really fallen off the gym bandwagon and that's kind of a bummer but you know gamification will hopefully help me get back on that.

90
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And you know the anticipation of nasty messages for melody when I achieve my goals. It could be motivating a little bit.

91
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Now going to our chat room of course to be. Yeah we do have of course our live chat room over twitch TV slash vogue network and we do tape live.

92
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:28,000
See it to bury is saying that Google Fit which you know would be obviously the other side of things not Apple but Google says it has its circles but its heart points and move minutes.

93
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yeah they got rid of their circles when they just you know they shut down Google Plus.

94
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Well and I'm sure I'm sure Fitbit has their own thing like everybody has like something on that.

95
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Fitbit just has like you can compare yourself with like other people like to see like where you're at with your goals during the day because I had a Fitbit before I had Apple Watch.

96
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Yeah it says you fell out of the habit. Did you return the habit to the nunnery. Which of us here is the actual drag none. That would be this bitch.

97
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I saw a shirt at Spencer's that totally made me think you know something about how many fucks do I have to give. And it's a nun flipping you off. It says none and you and I need.

98
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Yeah you need to check that out anyway.

99
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Pixel pakas in chat says the name of that RPG was habit RPG. I think it got renamed to habitica.

100
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I don't know if I'm saying that right but it's probably gone through some evolutions there as well.

101
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:25,000
So anyway there you go gamification of our exercise and other things that we do in life. Heck counting calories in a way is gamification a little bit a little bit.

102
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:39,000
One of the things that I've actually left feedback for is that I would love for it to register my weightlifting because you don't always get your heart rate up as high when you do but it's a steadier heart rate.

103
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And I would like for it to register what the heart rate is when you're lifting doing hard lifting as opposed to just cardio because there is more to exercise than cardio.

104
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:01,000
There is wanting to turn oneself into Linda Linda Hamilton from Terminator 2. I'm just saying which is a lofty goal. Yes. One of these days I'm going to have those guns or hell even the new Terminator movie.

105
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Have you seen what she looks like in this new Terminator movie. Probably still just as awesome considering her age. She still looks great.

106
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So I I wanted to I really that's like been ever since I saw Terminator 2. I'm like holy shit I want those arms and dance like those are very feminine arms. I'm like fuck you.

107
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Those are womanly arms and they will punch you in the deck. They will punch a man in the liver punch your gender roles right out of here. They will punch a man in the kidneys until he pees blood.

108
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Wow. OK. Those are goals. Those are goals. OK. Fuck the patriarchy. I will kick the patriarchy so hard. All right. But where were we. I'm sorry. You totally lost. You went off Linda Hamilton. Yeah I know there's something before that.

109
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Oh well exercise. Yeah exercise. It's great. Yes. We should do it. Yes. At some point. I know. All right. When my other stuff settles down I guess going to have to be after Dragon Con at this point. So we'll see anyway.

110
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:11,000
All right. Let's get into some gaming news and stuff that's going on around the industry. This is the big story from this week and I know a lot of people are talking about this because Nintendo kind of surprised us with it.

111
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:29,000
This is totally unheard of. Although this is also one of those things where it's kind of been rumored for a little while and I know some of you don't ever stock in rumors but like some rumors are too loud to ignore and this is one of them is that the Nintendo switch was going to get a smaller version a light version.

112
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It should be worth noting that many of the rumors have included that the switch will be getting a pro version as well. However nothing has been officially confirmed in that context.

113
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:47,000
But that rumor was supposed to be for next year. And those rumors kind of shifted to that that was being delayed about another year and that the only the light version would be happening.

114
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And this week Nintendo themselves confirmed. Yes the Nintendo switch light. It's real. It's going to be coming September 20th and the price for this is two hundred dollars.

115
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:10,000
But the irony about it is a switch that does not switch. So it is a switch in name only which you know that is the console's name. The little joy. There's no detachable joy cons. Those do not pop off.

116
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:18,000
So if you have any games that require those such as I don't know one to switch I'm sure there's some other games you can't play them play those games with this console.

117
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:30,000
But I'm going to give you a very big reason to bring out a switch like this. Animal Crossing. Sure. People want to be able to take their villages on the go and they may not want to take a fully detachable.

118
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I want one of these. I really do want one because it'd be easier to play you know the RPGs on the go without having you know leaving the system where say Dan can't play it.

119
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And of course it's not like I paid anything for my switch. So I don't care. Well what they mean by switches switch from the 3 D.S. to this new thing because the 3 D.S. is dead now.

120
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Well yeah there I think that is definitely like that was my first reaction to as I was kind of like finally they killed the 3 D.S. like that's that's done with.

121
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:09,000
And I get it. And before D.J. Ramos is in chat going boo. And I know he's not happy about this but look I'm not I'm not anti 3 D.S. by any means.

122
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:20,000
But I do think it is time for Nintendo to kind of put all their development stock in one place. And you know the switch is just the more technologically kind of advanced system at this point.

123
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And I think I think it's probably for the best that they start to move away from the 3 D.S. and the 2 D.S. and that this is probably the nail in the coffin of 3 D.S.

124
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Not to say third party developers in these home brews. And I don't think Nintendo plans to necessarily like pull the plug on 3 D.S. I don't think you're going to see it.

125
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I don't think you're going to see that happen at 3 D.S. like it did with the Wii U like that they're now they'll just go sit but they're going to either going to ghost it a little bit and it's going to kind of run on fumes with the third party developers and stuff for a little while.

126
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What if though they come out later with like a switch like this that has the 3 D screen support.

127
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:14,000
That would be pretty cool. I'd be into that. Although I don't know really worked hard on getting that 3 D in for well but years before the 3 D 3 is unpopular and even Nintendo started to walk away from 3 D because they had the 2 D.S. that came out you know a little ways into the the lifespan of the 3 D.S.

128
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,000
When a new Pokemon game was on the horizon and I was going to say it's funny you bring up Animal Crossing and I think that is very legit.

129
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I think Animal Crossing is a great reason for a system like this. I think less people are actually pointing that out because the more obvious one is Pokemon.

130
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Pokemon is going to be the game that comes out first and they're even doing a Pokemon themed like there's a sword and shield themed switch light.

131
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I will say this even though personally I'm not interested in the switch lightless system I have a regular switch and as far as I'm concerned it's portable enough for what I need to do but I get I get it's a little bigger.

132
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It needs its own case. I can't exactly put it in my pocket or in a little little tiny little bag or anything like that.

133
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I can't put it in a pocket because women's pockets suck.

134
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
But you could put it in a purse or a small bag right. Those switch lights are pretty.

135
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
If only they had women that designed clothes.

136
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Oh stop it. All right. Anyway where was I going to go. Oh yes. So even though I'm I personally don't plan on getting the switch light like I'm pretty impressed at all the different like colors and design like they're really they're nice looking systems.

137
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I will say that like you know if I had waited to get a switch for whatever reason I might be enticed just because these things look better than my boring gray switch with the gray joy cons and the fact that it doesn't play one two switches even more of a plus.

138
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Now Bobby Black Wolf in our chat points out a very good point here saying the only worry for me is that I hope developers don't abandon the features that aren't available on the switch light like HD rumble AR camera and so forth.

139
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:58,000
That's a very good concern because now if you develop a game that's going to use the HR rumble or even detachable joy cons or what have you you know that if somebody has a switch light they can't play your game.

140
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Now I don't think there's a lot of games that rely on that anyway. But also Bobby I think an interesting sort of thing that may happen with that is that we know the switch light is the thing but we also know that Nintendo I mean we don't know but if rumors are to be believed how they ended up true in this case.

141
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Nintendo is also working on a switch pro so they may develop something for this switch pro that does use those things because they want to push people towards that switch pro come holiday 2020 or whenever they plan on putting that thing out.

142
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I mean I don't know I certainly just market segmentation is great. Let's do that some more.

143
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:52,000
And then why we are kind of follows up Bobby's comment with because you design for the lowest common denominator if you want the greatest reach that is very true. I mean how many games ended up being new 3DS very few like very few 10 and 20.

144
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I don't even think it was that many honestly unless you count like the Super Nintendo Virtual Console. But anyway, let's see. Also, another comment I thought was really good. Where was it pixel pocket said Oh yes.

145
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Now this is in regards to the 3DS and its lifespan pistol pockets points out the Vita is still alive and getting games. The 3DS will still live as well just not likely with continued support from Nintendo.

146
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I think that's a very good comparison to where I expect the 3DS to be. And in fact, I think the 3DS will be in a better place than the Vita is right now. I didn't Sony like finally like just kill support for the Vita officially stopped.

147
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Make new systems. Yeah. Yeah. So I think Nintendo and 3DS fans still have a couple years before Nintendo is going to get to that point. But yeah, I mean, that's a good example is look at the Vita and maybe that will give you a little hope for those of you that are still, you know, excited about your 3DS and I, you know, I get that the 3DS has a distinct look to it with the top screen in the bottom screen.

148
00:17:50,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I wish there was a way that they could make some of those games work on the switch if you tilted your switch vertically. I don't I don't know why this is completely outside the realm of possibility, especially when many games towards the end of life were very 2D only because 2DS is we're out there.

149
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:25,000
So, and many people are saying that the switch light is kind of like the 2DS of the switch or obscure. Yeah, the 2DS switch. I can see that. Yeah. And I can kind of see that too. I don't I don't think a lot of the like hardcore gamers will get this, but this is going to be a better system for kids or like teenagers. I could really see like the 1318 crowd. This would be a big thing.

150
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Maybe. I just don't know. Like last few years, it seems like Nintendo will come out with a system with some gimmicks to it, really push that at launch and then completely abandon them, you know, as they go along, kind of like they did with the 3DS.

151
00:18:42,000 --> 00:19:05,000
3D graphics are 3D without glasses. That was like amazing. And we don't use it anymore. Or, you know, with the Wii U, like I'm trying to think they were doing more stuff with that screen as like a second screen for some games. But then they kind of stopped doing that because people really didn't understand how to utilize that in certain ways,

152
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:19,000
which is a bummer because you can very much tell that Zelda Breath of the Wild before they reframed it for Switch and not saying that it turned out bad at all. But you can tell that that game would have been an impressive use of the second screen with the whole slate and everything.

153
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You know, that it was it's very clear that was designed with the Wii U set up in mind. And after all, the game did come out on the Wii U.

154
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
But I don't think it really like it didn't really end up using the feature the same way that it was probably originally designed.

155
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Yeah. So it's just it's kind of just a bummer that the Wii U didn't really find its rhythm until it was too late. And the third party's lack of support.

156
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Even like the stuff for like one to switch, like, oh, we're changing the way that you play games and stuff. And they do that a little bit with like Labo.

157
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:51,000
But like I you know, I praise Labo a little bit after I purchased a couple of them.

158
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
But I'm kind of taking that back because it's exactly what I thought it would be.

159
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It's something that I buy, I build it, and then I have all this crap that's sitting there that I never use.

160
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
And it takes up a ton of space. I have been successful in that regard with Labo.

161
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I was very tempted by the VR one, though, I got to say.

162
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
But it's once I heard that like the Zelda and the Mario stuff kind of ended up being like I was.

163
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Yeah, it's just OK with my decision. Yeah, it's just not worth it.

164
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:30,000
It's it's it's a neat it's a neat prototype for something, but it's not like something that I would want to play on a regular basis.

165
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:36,000
And like occasionally we'll we'll bring out the robot thing, but it's such a pain in the ass to get it working.

166
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
And then just like even the VR stuff, it's just all over the place.

167
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I managed to shove some of it in like a drawer, but like it's still all over the goddamn place because it's so big.

168
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,000
And they have like there is a section in that Labo where it's like, here's how you can store your stuff a little bit better.

169
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,000
But it doesn't make it that much smaller because I did all that stuff and it's like, OK, this is really huge.

170
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I don't know. Maybe with just like that gun one, the thirty dollar one you can get with the goggles and the gun.

171
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Those are pretty much the more fun of the little mini games out there.

172
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
So I don't know. Maybe stick with that one.

173
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Some other little specs we should mention about the Switch Lite. The Nintendo Switch Lite battery power is supposed to last between three to seven hours.

174
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
That is about 30 minutes longer than the regular Switch. But I don't think that's whoopity shit.

175
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I mean, it's a smaller screen. Right. So whatever. It is a portable only system, which I think we've stressed enough here.

176
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,000
The screen is five point five inches as opposed to six point two inches in the original.

177
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,000
So you're losing about three quarters of an inch there if size is is big for you.

178
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And then the resolution, they say, is still 720p, just like the predecessor.

179
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,000
But they are saying because it's a smaller screen, it's going to look a little better because, you know, it's a smaller screen.

180
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
So whatever. And yeah, then you can get into some other specs as well.

181
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Like the D pad is going to be a little different. I say the D pad does look kind of nice, though.

182
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Look, I like the D pad better than like the little button thing.

183
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I fully anticipate someone taking that system and turning it into like a DS type clamshell thing, modding the crap out to make it even smaller.

184
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Yeah. But anyway, it's very obvious that this is timed for Pokemon.

185
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And that's very intentional is that there are going to be, despite all the controversy around the national decks and all that stuff.

186
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Like, I think the reality is, you know, kids and the biggest population of Pokemon players out there, maybe not the most vocal,

187
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
but the biggest population of Pokemon players out there are going to turn a blind eye to the national decks thing.

188
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I think they even have a special Pokemon edition that's coming up.

189
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,000
And I think most people, even if they are upset about the national decks thing, I kind of think they're going to still get it anyway.

190
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I don't think that's really going to stop people from buying the new Pokemon game.

191
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I mean, maybe in a few extreme circumstances, but I just think that game is still going to be selling.

192
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:08,000
And again, this is a great way for if you have a kid or even a parent or somebody that's just been waiting for that game that they got to get the system for, then this is it.

193
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
But one more thing I want to add here before we move on about the whole death of the 3DS.

194
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:22,000
To be honest, you know, again, as frustrating as that is, you kind of should have seen it coming when they moved the Pokemon games to the Switch.

195
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,000
That should have been your first indicator that the 3DS was, you know, tick tock, tick tock, right?

196
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
So, but it's had, I mean, 3DS has an amazing run.

197
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I mean, honestly, probably best portable system ever that I can think of off the top of my head.

198
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I mean, you know, some could argue about some of the more like retro consoles and, you know, especially at the original Game Boy and what Tetris did for that and everything.

199
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:53,000
But I think just the long life of the 3DS, the vast library of what most 3DS's can play between the regular 3DS games, the DS games.

200
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Can they play the advanced games? No, the original DS before they went to play.

201
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
They can on the virtual console.

202
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Oh yeah, they can on the virtual console.

203
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
So there's still, you know, there's just such a rich library and things that, you know, I think the 3DS will definitely be.

204
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I know, it's so amazing that a tiny little system like the 3DS can handle Super Nintendo games and yet this new console, the brand new console, like the Switch Lite, cannot fucking handle Super Nintendo games.

205
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Because that's why I assume it's not there yet and not because of some other greedy shit that they're doing to try to get people to pay for their online service or anything like that.

206
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I'm sure that's why.

207
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Now, you know, and depending, I'm looking at some of the comments in chat, DJ Rama S saying, I'll wait for my Switch Pro.

208
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
And, you know, certainly depending on what kind of gamer you are, like I get that.

209
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Like, you know, if you kind of know that there's a Switch Pro on the horizon, then, you know, maybe you're kind of waiting for that.

210
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:52,000
So, because I admit it is going to be a little bit frustrating to know that I'm probably going to end up buying that Switch Pro when I already dropped the money on the Switch.

211
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
But I mean, I guess I've gotten a few good years out of the Switch at this point.

212
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Switch has been out for a good year and a half at this point now, right?

213
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,000
A Raspberry Pi Zero, which is a $19 system, can play Super Nintendo games.

214
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Let it go.

215
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Let it go.

216
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
And yet.

217
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Let's see, S2100Matt says, I'm also looking to upgrade to the Pro when those specs come out.

218
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Going back to the National Dex issue, Sia Tabiri says, one YouTuber I follow actually called for his followers to skip Sword and Shield over the whole National Dex thing.

219
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And for the fact that the Dynamax thing is just a limited gimmick or whatever.

220
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I make that guy show his bank account record because I bet he buys it anyway.

221
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Like, sorry, not sorry.

222
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Again, I'm not really trying to take sides on that whole thing.

223
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I understand why people are mad about it.

224
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Don't get me wrong, but I really feel like when it comes to push or shove or whatever, people are still going to buy the game.

225
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
You know what I mean?

226
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I think we all know the inevitable conclusion to this is that in a future Pokémon game, this will be remedied.

227
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
So, it is what it is.

228
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Let's see, YYR says, I wouldn't expect much from a Switch Pro.

229
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I mean, I wouldn't expect it to enhance existing games a la Xbox One.

230
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I would expect it to improve new games that were designed for it, like New 3DS.

231
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,000
I just hope, unlike New 3DS, they don't start to split the market because I think that will be very bad.

232
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Now, we just said there weren't a lot of games for New 3DS.

233
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
So, specifically for New 3DS, what?

234
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
There was the Final Fantasy game and maybe like one or two others, right?

235
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Not the Final Fantasy game, the Xenoblade game and like one or two others.

236
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I think the Hyrule Warriors played better on the New 3DS.

237
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Yeah, I think it was that.

238
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
And then Smash Brothers was definitely better, but it still played on the old 3DS.

239
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I'm sure we can look it up.

240
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
It was a really small number of games.

241
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Also, just like the very small number of games that were on the...

242
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Actually, it was the 3DS where it used the second analog stick.

243
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Remember how on the older 3DSs it didn't have the second nub that they have on there?

244
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:05,000
They had that solution that you would buy this giant thing that would attach to your 3DS to give you the second analog stick and stuff like that.

245
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
There were only a handful of games that used that, too.

246
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,000
So, before we move to the next topic, let's quickly poll everybody in here.

247
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Are you going to get a Switch Lite, yes or no?

248
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
So, I think I'm hearing you're a yes, right, Jamie?

249
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
I want to.

250
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
You want to?

251
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Just for Animal Crossing and such? Makes sense?

252
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Yeah, so I can have that on the go.

253
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I don't know if it'll happen because I do have a Switch that I didn't pay for, but we'll see.

254
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I'm going to say no, but it's one of those, not for me, but I think it's cool it exists and I think they're really good looking,

255
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
but I can't really justify it for me when I have the regular Switch already.

256
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Loki?

257
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Probably not because I already have a Switch and most of my games are digital

258
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
and Nintendo's not good about swapping that stuff around between systems.

259
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Plus, all of my saves are on one system, so say if we wanted to get some for the kids so that I can actually use my Switch.

260
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I was going to say, I'm surprised that the boys getting older isn't kind of way in yet, but maybe they're not quite there yet.

261
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:05,000
No, they just got two DSs last year, so they don't need, they have a Switch, they don't play it very often anyways.

262
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Well, actually, no, I take it back. They were playing, they were playing some, no, my son was playing Animal Crossing on 3DS earlier this week.

263
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:23,000
He was in my wife's town digging a bunch of holes. He dug so many holes in that town.

264
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,000
And then he got stuck on an island and he didn't know how to get off the island.

265
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:35,000
When the new one comes out, you're going to need to teach him how to visit Dark Sakura's town.

266
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Dig all the holes.

267
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Not invited.

268
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I imagine, and I seem to remember the last one that was online, you couldn't do that type of stuff if you were visiting other towns.

269
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
They put blocks in there so that you couldn't screw up someone else's town that bad.

270
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Yeah, well I'll definitely get it, but I don't know. We'll see.

271
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Alright, well let's move on. Let's talk about, we know what Loki's kids have been playing, but how about the hosts?

272
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
And how about you guys in our chat room at twitch.tv slash vog network?

273
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
How was your gaming week, Dark Sakura? What kind of games have you been playing this week?

274
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I really buckled down with a lot of my pins lately, just playing some pinball.

275
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I'm also, I'm trying to get myself actually back into Twilight Zone because I'm really out of practice with it.

276
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
But I've also been playing Animal Crossing Pocket Camp. I've been playing Idle Poring.

277
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I've been playing Pokemon Go. I've been playing the Harry Potter stupid game.

278
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I don't know, just not a whole lot. Dan and I are still talking about what, if eventually we're going to start streaming together with.

279
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:45,000
And it's sort of leaning toward the Super Famicom Sega Densetsu 3 with one of the translated ROMs I have. So we'll see.

280
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Alright, moving on to Loki. How was your gaming week?

281
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:58,000
It was pretty good. I played a little bit of Shakedown Miami. Hawaii. Shakedown Hawaii. I keep confusing that with Hotline Miami.

282
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Hotline Miami, yeah.

283
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Yes, Shakedown Hawaii. And I played a little bit of that because they have the new update that came out, so I was checking that out.

284
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:15,000
And then, what else? Mainly just a little bit of Pokemon Go and I worked on my game a little bit.

285
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I was building a thing for the camera. A camera controller type thing. And then, what else? Yeah, that's about it.

286
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I just realized there's a typo in the little what's coming up next thing on Twitch.

287
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Because for those that haven't seen the Twitch feed, you're only listening on the podcast, we have a little like you might see on CNN or something a little ticker like what's coming up next.

288
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I just realized it says, how was you gaming week? Left an R off, my bad.

289
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
How was you gaming week?

290
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:56,000
How was you? How was you this week? Sorry about that. Sorry if your grammar is shaking right now, my bad.

291
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I'm trying not to pay attention to it.

292
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
My bad. It was an innocent mistake. I know how it's really said. Alright, anyway.

293
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Just be glad I didn't notice it.

294
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
You should just do it all in Comic Sans week.

295
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
No.

296
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Here's what I have to say about that. If you don't like it, you are welcome to do it for future weeks.

297
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,000
But when I get stuck doing it, then you got to love me and my mistakes.

298
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I do want to like make some stuff and I just haven't gotten a chance to.

299
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,000
There's a lot of people in chat that are like, I noticed. I noticed. And there's others that were like, I was just being polite.

300
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I also want to get a giant neon sign to go right here, but I don't know if it'll show up on camera.

301
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Yeah, the light will do funky things to that. I don't know.

302
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
So anyway, the Spyro Jonathan says, I literally just died laughing. I only just noticed.

303
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Yeah, obviously I just noticed too, but I usually sit here and read what's on the TV, but that one jumped out at me. Anyway.

304
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Alright, so my gaming week. How was my gaming week?

305
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
So I'm still doing the Survivor LARP. That is still going.

306
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
And I believe it or not, you guys, I'm still in it. Can you believe it?

307
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
You're in it to win it. They haven't voted you off yet.

308
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
They have not voted me off yet. And we're down. It started with 22 people.

309
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
And I think the girl that left last night was 16th. So we've got 15 people.

310
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I think if I did my math, we either have 16 people left now. No, we have 15 people left now. I can't even math.

311
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
So seven people have left. And the point is, I haven't been one of them.

312
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
So small victories, I guess, in that regard. But the people have been really great.

313
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I got to say, like just the various people I've been meeting from all over has been really cool.

314
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,000
And that's like that's the whole reason to play this stuff. Otherwise, they can't talk much more about it because, you know,

315
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
strategic and all that stuff because the other tribe might know that I do this thing.

316
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,000
I don't know. So I can't talk a lot about like what's really going on. But, you know, well,

317
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I will talk all about it once it's done. I would actually love to have some of the other people that were that were in it,

318
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
like come on the show and like talk about it because I think it would be really funny. I don't know.

319
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I think it's these these highly immersive games are really frickin interesting to me.

320
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Anyway, but in the video game world, I have been still able. Luckily, the the it's not like as much time playing that as I was like the first week it was going on.

321
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,000
So I have been able to play some other video games. Most of my time, admittedly, has been on Final Fantasy 14 Shadowbringers,

322
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:26,000
just because it's an MMO and there's a lot to explore. And I've got easily sunk in in the dozens of hours already.

323
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:32,000
And I'm not even like halfway through. But the story is really good and I'm having a really good time with it.

324
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:38,000
And I don't know if you guys know this, but if you go, you know, I don't know if you guys put a lot of stock in things like Metacritic and what have you,

325
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,000
and the things that like kind of assess what all the ratings across the Internet are saying.

326
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:50,000
But Final Fantasy Shadowbringers right now is one of the best reviewed games of the year, if you can believe it, which you don't always see for an MMO.

327
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:59,000
So that's kind of interesting. But I think it also speaks to just like how like good the story is and the graphics and the character design and the sound and all that.

328
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:05,000
So it's it's turning a lot of heads. And now people are getting interested in Final Fantasy 14, who may have not like noticed before.

329
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
You know, especially when it comes to the monthly fee, which I know still puts a lot of people off.

330
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I think people are really into it.

331
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Yep. That's why I don't play it.

332
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:18,000
One thing, though, and let me make this clear. I love 14 in its current state. I think it's a fantastic game.

333
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I do have to point out something, though, I think is a little troubling because I think something is being misrepresented by the media and it's very important by gaming media.

334
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:38,000
And I think it's very important about this game, because one thing that I think got a lot of people interested in this expansion was if you do these endgame dungeons,

335
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:46,000
you don't have to do them yourself. You have a party of like trust people that you can bring with you and you do these dungeons with your trust parties.

336
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:52,000
And that is all still true. That part, like, is not different. And that is really changing the game for some people.

337
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Here's the problem, though. People are reporting on that and everybody's going, yay, I don't really have to play with other people.

338
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I can do these dungeons on my own. And while that is true, what they're not saying is that there are still primal battles.

339
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:15,000
The eight people fights that are a part of the story. For instance, there is one, it's not a spoiler to say because they've talked about that this primal is in the game.

340
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Titania, who's been in Final Fantasy lore before, is the first big primal fight that you do at around level 74, about four levels in, maybe 73.

341
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,000
73 or 74, four levels in. You can't do that fight with trust. You have to do it with other players.

342
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:37,000
And where I've got to say, yikes, a little bit on the expansion, everybody getting excited, it's not an easy fight.

343
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
It took us several tries to get through that fight with, like, people I know and all that.

344
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Now, will they do things later on to lessen the blow of that? Yes, they will introduce the echo thing where the more you die on it, the more powerful you get so that it helps you to clear it, but it's not in there right now.

345
00:35:53,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Although they are doing a mini patch on Monday, so I wouldn't be surprised if they're like, I'm saying this now and by the time a lot of you hear it, some of this is already going to be addressed.

346
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:10,000
The difficulty of that fight is that they're going to put in the echo and they're going to probably reduce some of the health of the ads and things like that.

347
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:20,000
But I think it's an important thing to point out because I would not want people to buy this thinking, oh, I don't have to worry about the anxiety or the pressure that comes with playing with other people

348
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:28,000
or getting called bad by other people and all this stuff. And I understand, those are all legit concerns. You don't want to feel responsible for wasting other people's time in a dungeon, I get that.

349
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:40,000
So I think it's fair to warn people, whereas yes, Final Fantasy is moving in that direction of being a multiplayer experience, but one that you can still do yourself.

350
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:47,000
You cannot get through the entire story without other people as is being represented right now in a lot of the reviews.

351
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:54,000
A lot of the reviews I don't think played to the Titania fight to find out, oh, whoops, you do have to play some of this with other people.

352
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:01,000
So I wanted to call that out. I bet that's something that the developers will address later on at some point, I think.

353
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:12,000
So anyway, Fifth Dream in chat says, even when I had the people in the Friendly Guild who helped me, I still felt that anxiety of not doing well, so I kind of stopped playing.

354
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:19,000
And some people in chat are saying, shit, I didn't know that. I wanted to do the main story quest alone. Boo, I would have re-subbed.

355
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Yeah, and I'm sorry because I think Final Fantasy XIV is a great game and I do want to share it with a lot of people, but I think you have a right to know.

356
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:35,000
You will not get through the story without playing with other people. It's only a couple of times, very short, but I have to say it.

357
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:44,000
It is not accurately being represented in some of the early previews and stuff like that that are focusing on the trust thing, which is great, and it's a huge step forward of getting there.

358
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:51,000
It's the typical gamer media mentality where it's like, oh, they only played it for a little bit.

359
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Or one person reported on that element of it, so everybody reported their whole story on just that element without considering the bigger picture.

360
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:06,000
But I also don't want to shit on Shadowbringers either because it's a fucking fantastic expansion.

361
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,000
And I'm like, if you're going to play any MMO, you need to play Final Fantasy XIV. It is the creme de la creme right now. It's amazing.

362
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I'm not talking shit on WoW by any means.

363
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I just wish I had time for it. That's the issue.

364
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:30,000
If I had that much time, like say, someday when I'm retired and don't have to work and have all this time for gaming and stuff, then yes, an MMO would be right for me.

365
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:37,000
But right now, I have hardly enough time for the games I have in my library, let alone time for an MMO.

366
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,000
But I will say this much, one more thing I want to say about Final Fantasy, then I'll move on to the games.

367
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:48,000
I'm only halfway through the story, so I can't really comment on this expansion story as a whole.

368
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:54,000
But I'm hearing it gets even better in the final half and that apparently some big shit goes down and stuff.

369
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,000
And most of my friends that have played through it are like, this is the best that it gets.

370
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,000
This may very well be the best Final Fantasy story that has ever been told.

371
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:17,000
And especially if you look at the critic scores and everything else out there, this is a distinct reality that we may be living in a time and a place where the best Final Fantasy story is in their MMO.

372
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:26,000
So, kind of interesting. But I've said on prior shows, I kind of think Heaven's Word and Stormblood also had fantastic stories that most people missed out on.

373
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
So I hope, I don't know what they can do to help more people experience this story.

374
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I think the trust system is kind of getting there. I think they took a big step with this expansion, and I expect that will be refined in some of the later patches.

375
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:46,000
So maybe in six more months, people will be able to experience it more in single player.

376
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,000
And I know it's so interesting, isn't it? It's a massively multiplayer game, but people want to play it single player.

377
00:39:52,000 --> 00:40:03,000
But I kind of get it. Sometimes other people are fucking mean, but you want to be able to say hi to your friends, and go visit your friends' houses, and see your friends' outfits, and things like that.

378
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
But you still kind of want to do your own thing. I kind of get it. I do.

379
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:17,000
All right. Bobby in chat says, I wanted to experience this great single player story. I soloed the story for Star Wars The Old Republic.

380
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:26,000
And what little I did play of that game was pretty fun as well. So that's one of those games I need to go back to one of these days.

381
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
That's back in BioWare's heyday, I suppose.

382
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
So, anyway, other games I played this week, because there are a couple others.

383
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I also played, oh no, I forget the name of it, the racing game they were giving away for free on PlayStation Plus this month.

384
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:47,000
The Hyper Turbo, so I played that for a little bit. It's a fun little arcade racer.

385
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:56,000
My only little thing with it is that with the polygons and the way the graphics look, it kind of looks like a PlayStation 2 game that was kind of up rezzed for PlayStation 4.

386
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,000
But I think it's super indie. And it is fun to play. At the end of the day, it's fun to play.

387
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:06,000
But the graphics are a little basic for a racing game, in my opinion.

388
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:12,000
But it's fast and it's fun to control and so forth. So, yeah, there's that.

389
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Thank you, Darktits2. I knew somebody would know it. Horizon Chase Turbo, that's the name of it. Thank you, thank you.

390
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Bobby Blackwolf says the graphics are basic. Yeah, I mean, I've played a lot of racing games that are amazing graphics.

391
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Like Forza, hello. Gran Turismo, F-Zero, hell. But the ones in this game are kind of, it looks like I'm playing Outrun.

392
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,000
And Outrun's not a bad game. It's just a dated game at this point. Anyway.

393
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
So that's about it for my gaming week. I think that's everything I'll mention.

394
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:49,000
So we'll move on. A quick housekeeping note. We are live on Twitch tonight, of course, as we are every Sunday night.

395
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:57,000
And Twitch has a little special promotion going on right now because Twitch belongs to Amazon and Amazon's got their big Prime Day coming up, right?

396
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:04,000
So right now, and it's only tonight during Sunday's show, if you are kind enough to donate biddies to the show,

397
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:13,000
which we use your biddies to get things like new mics, the flyers that Bobby was just able to hand out at this weekend's Southern Fried Game Room Expo,

398
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:23,000
or excuse me, Gaming Expo. I always get the names of these up. The flyers that were handed out were designed by Dark Sakura and were paid for by your biddie donations and subscription stuff.

399
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:29,000
So thank you very much. So thank you, thank you, thank you for everybody that helps that happen because that helps us get the word out for not just our own shows,

400
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,000
but the other great shows on this network. Girls Gone Wow, you've probably seen, is also streaming Sunday during the day.

401
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:38,000
That's been great. Anime Jam Session, of course, on Tuesday. And more and more and more.

402
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:46,000
So anyway, you do need to specifically use the bleed purple emote, or excuse me, yeah, emote during your bit donation.

403
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:57,000
But Twitch will do an extra 10% tonight only. So if you donate 100 biddies, you'll actually be donating 110 because Twitch will add 10% to the pot.

404
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:06,000
But you have to use that bleed purple emote. I believe right now, if you click on the bits icon, it will show more detail on that right now.

405
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Please do it.

406
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Because I said so.

407
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Well, I don't want to beg for money, but I will say that it's appreciated.

408
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
We're not begging.

409
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
And it goes to good use.

410
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,000
We're just telling you all what to do.

411
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Yeah. And of course,

412
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Do the thing.

413
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:27,000
If you are a Prime person, you get a free monthly subscription because you're paying for it with Prime that you can use on one Twitch channel every month.

414
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:33,000
And if you decide to use it here at the Voice Geeks Network or VOG Network, you get access to the complete video archive.

415
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
So you can access all the old shows on video and watch them that way if you desire.

416
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,000
But of course, the audio, as it has been for 17 years, will still be free.

417
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
That's not something we're going to be charging for.

418
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,000
So we want you to still be able to enjoy what you've always enjoyed.

419
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,000
We wanted to add something new for the paywall or whatever you want to say.

420
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Not take anything away.

421
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Very important.

422
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Anyway.

423
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
S2100Matt says, give them money for pizza or cookies or other important things.

424
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I think it's safe to say we have not spent your money on food.

425
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
It definitely goes back into the show.

426
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,000
And yeah, hopefully some exciting stuff coming up at Dragon Con, too.

427
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:15,000
We'll have to kind of look at the finances, but we might be able to have another thing that we give away in person.

428
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,000
I know in years past we had the little hacky sacks.

429
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
The lanyards were a big thing last year.

430
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
So maybe we'll have something new for this year.

431
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I don't want to promise, but it's not outside the realm of possibility.

432
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
It's going to be a fun year.

433
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
All right.

434
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Anyway, YYR in chat says, I totally do it, but would it look like I'm paying for advertising?

435
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
You guys do endorse my games quite a bit.

436
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I don't think so because we already endorse them without any agreement of any sort.

437
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
You know, you were looking for or fancy.

438
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
You were looking for content for the break.

439
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:52,000
And I did manage to catch one of YYR's.

440
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Excuse me.

441
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Like all that pizza.

442
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Anyways, I did catch one of his retrospectives that he did.

443
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
See, these are things that you should tell me before we're live.

444
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Because now I can't just throw it in there.

445
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
But yeah, that would have been a great retrospective.

446
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Because he did one for Bungee Ferret tossing.

447
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Oh, that would have been fun.

448
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Well, when the new one comes out, because he's talked about the one on PC,

449
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I will do a little thing of that and put it during the break.

450
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
And he doesn't have to give us a dime.

451
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:26,000
We would do that just because we love the fact that somebody actually made a game out of a silly idea on this show.

452
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:32,000
For the record, I'm also going to say, since people brought up food earlier, I did bring cookies that I baked myself.

453
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
And they are rose chocolate and craisin cookies.

454
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, I'm sorry, not Bobby Black Wolf.

455
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Other people in chat are saying, we need Smush to do something special.

456
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
We need a Smush emote.

457
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Bobby says the Smush emote is for the Discord.

458
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,000
The thing is, we would have to get in.

459
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,000
So Smush doesn't photograph well because he's a black cat.

460
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
So we would have to commission the artwork to be done.

461
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Which I'm willing to do and have that done.

462
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Oh, you're going to draw Mr. Smush?

463
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I could try. It's been a while. I've got enough references.

464
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
I just sent you a picture of his sleepy ass.

465
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Well, even if you decide you don't want to do it, I'm sure we could commission somebody to do it for $20 or even $40.

466
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
To do a small little emote of Mr. Smush.

467
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,000
And maybe that's something we could put for a higher tier sub.

468
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Or when we unlock more sub slots.

469
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
We may have one right now. I don't remember.

470
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
But that might be something. I don't want to promise anything yet.

471
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Because we have to reach an agreement with Bobby Black Wolf on any of those types of decisions.

472
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,000
But I think if you guys really want it, I'm sure we can make it happen.

473
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Alright. Anyway.

474
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
And thank you SHJ100Matt who says,

475
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
You've given me and plenty of us years of entertainment.

476
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
The few bits we throw is the least we can do.

477
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Super appreciate that.

478
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
I wish you could still get the bits from watching ads.

479
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
You can.

480
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Oh, you can on desktop too?

481
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Yeah, except I have an ad blocker.

482
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
But it says I can watch one for $5.

483
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Oh good. I'm glad those are back.

484
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Watching just a handful of ads and then throwing those bits this way.

485
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Or whoever.

486
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
If you don't feel like you want to give us biddies.

487
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
I'm not going to be upset.

488
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Go support some other streamer that does this out of the goodness of their heart and so forth.

489
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Watch a few ads.

490
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
A little bit goes a long way and it adds up. Trust me.

491
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Even if you're only donating like 10 biddies to somebody.

492
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
It's still just that, oh, Senpai noticed me.

493
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,000
It's just a nice thing to be noticed by your viewers.

494
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Okay, and then I think the mobile will let you watch ads too.

495
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
That's always been there.

496
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Alright, anyway. Enough of that.

497
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Enough self-promotion about Twitch promotions.

498
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Let's get into some other gaming news.

499
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Let's make some more of those moments you guys like to be here for.

500
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
With one that maybe we'll start a Loki rant.

501
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Let's see, Loki. It's a Nintendo story and it's one that kind of...

502
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
I don't know. I don't know, Loki.

503
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,000
It's a feature that they've made so good for them.

504
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:03,000
So if you're looking for more excitement in your Nintendo online collection.

505
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:10,000
Well, you can at least be able to play now with rewind features that they have in NES games.

506
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:15,000
So for example, if you hold these ZL and ZR buttons.

507
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,000
You're able to scroll back in a timeline of snapshots of your gameplay.

508
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
And pick anywhere you want to resume from.

509
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
So that's kind of cool.

510
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:30,000
And apparently that's going to be added to the Switch online NES app starting July 17th.

511
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Which is the same day they're going to be adding some new games.

512
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Donkey Kong 3 and Wrecking Crew.

513
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Yeah, Wrecking Crew is the other.

514
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
No, Rob the Robot though, so that kind of sucks.

515
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Wrecking Crew wasn't a Rob the Robot game.

516
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
I thought it was.

517
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,000
No, Gyro My Ex and Stackem were the Rob the Robot games.

518
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
You're right, I'm thinking...

519
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Wrecking Crew had a level editor.

520
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
It did have a level editor.

521
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
And it was referenced later on in Smash Brothers.

522
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
I think a lot of people know the Wrecking Crew level in Smash Brothers.

523
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
It kind of plays like the old Wrecking Crew game actually.

524
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Wrecking Crew is a nice historical choice, I guess.

525
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
But I kind of think it's one of those games you play once and you're like,

526
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Alright, I played it. That's it.

527
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
You don't really play it a lot.

528
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Donkey Kong 3.

529
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:21,000
I think that game is neat because it's so different.

530
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
It's weird.

531
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:29,000
Suddenly you play this character that doesn't exist anywhere else in Nintendo's timeline.

532
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:33,000
You play that little peat, the pesticide or whatever.

533
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,000
And Donkey Kong 3 is more like a shooter than it is a platformer.

534
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
That's what made it so weird, right?

535
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Because you're shooting the bug spray up Donkey Kong's ass.

536
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
That's what you're doing. Look at the game.

537
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
To scare him out of the greenhouse or whatever.

538
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
So it's just weird because that game is more like a shooter.

539
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
And so it kind of got lost amongst Nintendo's history.

540
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
But the reality is, when it comes to these NES releases,

541
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
if that's what we're getting this month, I'm sorry,

542
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
but they're starting to scrape the bottom of the barrel.

543
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Which is weird because they have a huge library of games out there.

544
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,000
I don't understand why we can't just throw some money.

545
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
I don't even know.

546
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
I really wish they just sold these games online

547
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,000
because then we'd have more of a library to choose from.

548
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,000
You can have like, you get these free,

549
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
but if you want additional games, you can purchase them.

550
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
And they go into that.

551
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
In a way, like I think what's happened now

552
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:31,000
is that you have these publishers that are re-releasing their NES things

553
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
as part of these collections.

554
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Like look at what Konami's doing, the Castlevania collection.

555
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,000
Because they're forced to do that because they don't have any other options.

556
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,000
That's why when there was these Capcom collections way back

557
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,000
on the PlayStation stuff, they didn't have that on the Nintendo Wii,

558
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,000
I think at that point, because they had Virtual Console stuff.

559
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,000
So it didn't make any sense to release that on there

560
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
because you could just purchase them separately.

561
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
OrangeRite in chat says,

562
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
How many first-party games are still holding out, though?

563
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
And I think that's an excellent call-out. Not a lot.

564
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:06,000
There's not a lot of first-party games that aren't on this service at this point.

565
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
It's the third-party games where they...

566
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Well, they have some really bottom-of-the-barrel stuff like Pinball.

567
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Yeah, but we would be reading them just as hard

568
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,000
if those were the types of things that they were releasing at this point.

569
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
You know what I mean?

570
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:24,000
I think a lot of us more than recognize it's time for Super Nintendo.

571
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
It's time for more.

572
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
I don't understand why we can't get third-party stuff in there

573
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
because we have some Konami games, I think, in there.

574
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
We do.

575
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
So, I mean...

576
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Something is clearly stopping them because we haven't had...

577
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,000
I saw a list of some stuff that they were wishing they would have on the service.

578
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
And one of them that was mentioned was Maniac Mansion, which would be amazing.

579
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,000
Well, you know, I would fucking flip if they could get the Guardian Legend.

580
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,000
But the problem is the rights to the Guardian Legend are so muddled at this point

581
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
as well as some of these other old-school 8-bit games.

582
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,000
I'm not surprised that they're just kind of not there.

583
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Yeah.

584
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,000
But I think it is definitely time to start thinking about other systems,

585
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,000
namely the Super Nintendo.

586
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
And if they can swing it, why not Genesis?

587
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
I mean, I guess Sega's got their own thing going on with their mini system,

588
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
but at some point, why not include, like, the Nintendo Wii had?

589
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Some limited arcade stuff, although then you got arcade archives

590
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
is also screwing that whole thing up, right?

591
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,000
Like, why would...

592
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,000
It's just not planned out very well.

593
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Yeah, I don't think they plan it out very well.

594
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
I really don't.

595
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I think Nintendo is going to be cornered that they're going to have to do Super Nintendo.

596
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
They really don't have any other choice.

597
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
So I think that's coming.

598
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:39,000
If it doesn't come by holiday, I think then we have to get really concerned.

599
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,000
I think we're going to have a couple more rough months,

600
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,000
and then, like, Super Nintendo is going to probably have to happen.

601
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
But we'll see. I don't know.

602
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,000
As far as the rewind and fast-forward thing, I mean, cool, I guess.

603
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Like, you know, especially in maybe some of the more difficult games,

604
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:02,000
like ghosts and goblins and some of the ones that, you know, are really easy to die over and over in.

605
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Or really...

606
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
It would be nice to have that too.

607
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Mario 3, you go to the Toad house and you're like,

608
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
ah, I didn't get what I wanted.

609
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Back it up. Oh, do it again.

610
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
You sure could. You sure could.

611
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
So, how's that going to work if you're playing online?

612
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Maybe that's disabled if you play online with somebody else.

613
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
Probably.

614
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Yeah. And I think maybe that's another place where this has felt very disappointing

615
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,000
is that even though, you know, they have this whole, like, online setup

616
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
where you can play with other people,

617
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:28,000
it doesn't feel like there's a lot of games that are worth playing online with other people.

618
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Like, it's still a lot of, like, single-player heavy experiences.

619
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
And look, Donkey Kong 3.

620
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
It's not one you can really play online.

621
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Wrecking Crew.

622
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,000
I don't even remember if that's a two-player simultaneous game.

623
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:44,000
If it is, it's not going to be fun for long.

624
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,000
So, God, I feel like if they could just open up Super Nintendo,

625
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
we could get some more stuff that, you know,

626
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
especially when you get into things like Super Mario Kart, the original and things,

627
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
it would be a lot of fun to play online.

628
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Yeah.

629
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
We'll see. We'll see.

630
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Anyway, YYR in chat says,

631
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
If you're going to rewind the Toad House,

632
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
I wonder if you have to do it before you enter.

633
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
No.

634
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Well, it depends which house.

635
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Like, if you're going to do the flip card, you might have to do it before you enter.

636
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
But I think you're thinking the slot machine, right?

637
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Oh, yeah. I mean, I don't think it necessarily matters

638
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,000
because you look at...

639
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,000
You can see in the screenshots where you're at.

640
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,000
You can back it up. I think it's every few seconds.

641
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:30,000
So, you probably could do it in a way where you can manipulate that.

642
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I'm sure they don't care.

643
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,000
All right.

644
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Game Genie. Support the Game Genie.

645
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
That would be kind of... Nintendo always hated that thing, though.

646
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,000
I don't fucking care what they like or don't like.

647
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Moving on. I know what I like, and that is AR games

648
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,000
because, you know, I love to play some Ingress

649
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
as well as Harry Potter, Wizards Unite, Pokemon Go.

650
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
I was like, you know, there was a big Entei thing tonight,

651
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
and I couldn't even do it because of the show.

652
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
And Community Day is next week during the show.

653
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,000
I was right by one of those armored Mewtwos,

654
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
and I looked at it, and I'm like, man, that looks dumb.

655
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,000
I'm getting really...

656
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:09,000
It's just making me not want to play anymore.

657
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
I'm missing out on so much stuff that I'm just kind of like,

658
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
I can just let this go for a while until maybe they introduce Gen 5 or something.

659
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I got to admit, I'm kind of into the Harry Potter, Wizards Unite

660
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:24,000
because Allen got into it, and he was kind of fizzling out on Pokemon Go as well.

661
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,000
But playing Wizards Unite gives us something both to do.

662
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:33,000
And what's nice about Wizards Unite is that you don't have to wait for raids to spawn.

663
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,000
You go find a fortress, and you can do it at the same time with your friend

664
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,000
and play whenever you want. You don't have to wait for something to spawn.

665
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
So the way they did that, I think the battling in Wizards Unite

666
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
is way more interesting than it is in Pokemon Go.

667
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
That's where that game really starts to shine.

668
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:54,000
So anyway, we were doing five player fortresses the other day with some of my Ingress buddies.

669
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,000
It was a lot of fun. You just have to constantly communicate.

670
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
I'm strong to the level 27. I'm going to take the 27.

671
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Can somebody put a shield on me? Can somebody heal?

672
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Drop a potion. You're constantly communicating while you're fighting on your phone

673
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
and drawing all the traces. It's pretty awesome.

674
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:12,000
So anyway, I can't wait for Dragon Con to be able to play some...

675
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Bobby, find out if there's a fortress down at Dragon Con.

676
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
There's got to be. Of course, there's a fortress down there somewhere.

677
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Anyway, but since I love AR games, I'm going to have to give this one a shot too.

678
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
This isn't Niantic, but I still think it's going to be really neat.

679
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:30,000
It's Minecraft Earth. Minecraft Earth is soon to be on the way.

680
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:36,000
It will be launching on iOS in the next two weeks, apparently, a beta release.

681
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:41,000
So it's coming soon. The Android version will follow soon thereafter.

682
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
And it's not totally uncommon that it hits one platform before the other.

683
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
I think that did happen with Pokemon Go.

684
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Ingress was Android only for a year before it was out on iOS.

685
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Of course, Ingress was also a Google game.

686
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:57,000
But anyway, I digress. So it will be out on iOS first, but it's not going to be a long wait.

687
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
And they also showed a new trailer for Minecraft Earth.

688
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,000
So it's interesting because you have that overworld view that looks very Minecraft-like,

689
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
that has pets and things you can tap on.

690
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,000
But then it looks like there's another button you can do that will turn...

691
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:14,000
And it shows these guys building a snow cavern on top of a picnic table.

692
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
And it looked really cool. And I'm like, if that is...

693
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:24,000
What I also thought was fascinating about it was that the guy's other phone was showing a little pickaxe.

694
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
It was showing the item that he was using.

695
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:31,000
And I'm like, that has to be enhanced for a trailer. It can't look that good.

696
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Didn't you watch the developer's conference?

697
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
I didn't watch the whole thing, but...

698
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:43,000
They announced the Minecraft Earth at the developer's conference in Cupertino.

699
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Not in Cupertino, but when they did the... talking about the AR stuff,

700
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:53,000
they did the whole demo of building, of standing in your building and everything.

701
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Wow. If that really is what it ends up looking like, I'm going to be blown away.

702
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
I'm really excited to try this out.

703
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:03,000
I just feel like it's one of those things where in theory it's awesome,

704
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
and then in practice it's kind of derpy.

705
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
So we'll see how it works.

706
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
But I know I signed up for that beta because I want to check this out.

707
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
I'm sure you did too.

708
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,000
And I'm sure now that it's on Dark Soccer's mind, she might think about signing up too.

709
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
But yeah, I'm excited to try it out.

710
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
And if you haven't seen the trailer yet, it's definitely worth looking at.

711
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:26,000
I... you know, for as much as I've always kind of been complaining,

712
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:31,000
if Microsoft bought Minecraft, why have they yet to put out a Minecraft 2?

713
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Where's Minecraft 2? Why is that not a logical progression of what happens to Minecraft?

714
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:41,000
But now that I'm looking at this, I'm like, oh, maybe this is the logical progression of Minecraft.

715
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:48,000
This is why we don't have the ultra 4K HDR texture pack.

716
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:54,000
And SHG100Matt says, a Microsoft product coming to an Apple product first, the times that we live in.

717
00:58:54,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Well, hey, you remember when Apple took on the Microsoft Office suite?

718
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,000
And that was like, what a jaw dropping moment that was when Apple agreed to do that.

719
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,000
And it kind of changed both companies for the better.

720
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:13,000
So, you know, you ally with the enemy when it makes good business sense.

721
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
What had everybody talking just three weeks ago?

722
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Sony and Microsoft teaming up on the cloud technology thing.

723
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Does that mean The Last of Us 2 is going to be on Xbox? No.

724
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Halo is going to be on PS5? No.

725
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:31,000
It just means that, you know, when it mutually benefits companies to work together, they're going to do it.

726
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
So, yeah, it's kind of just fascinating.

727
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:40,000
But I get it. I get it. It's very much like when you first played a Sonic game on a Nintendo console.

728
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
It's very that. It is very that.

729
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Yes. Oh, I like the way Questbuster puts that.

730
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,000
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

731
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,000
And who's the person to be in the AR space right now?

732
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Niantic or maybe Google, if you will.

733
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
I mean, because Niantic was a spin off of Google.

734
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:03,000
It's really the one to beat is definitely Garfield Go.

735
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:07,000
How's that? Well, some some of these other, you know, not I'm using my quoting finger,

736
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,000
knockoff games have done fairly well for themselves, like the Jurassic Park game.

737
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:15,000
I think it's OK. Like, I think it's got a fan base.

738
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,000
They ran out of dinosaurs, so they had the spin off into other animals.

739
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,000
And then The Walking Dead had one, too.

740
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Yeah, I think has you know, I don't think it's as big as Pokemon Go yet, but it's got it's got its fans, you know, and they kind of do their thing.

741
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:32,000
So anyway, I am excited about Minecraft Earth.

742
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Please don't let me down. That's all I have to say.

743
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,000
I also see the potential to get extremely let down. All right. Moving on.

744
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Dark Sakura, I like this. You got kind of a different sort of topic for us tonight.

745
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,000
I've been trying to make that a theme lately, at least find something that shows the other side of gaming.

746
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Well, especially in these slower news months, there's other things about gaming we can talk about, you know.

747
01:00:51,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Well, there was a study that was published in the journal Dreaming that said that games that promote more activities,

748
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:06,000
certain basically certain types of games will lead you into being a more lucid dreamer.

749
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:11,000
So basically, if you play an active role in your game, like a virtual, you know,

750
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:17,000
like something they specifically mentioned, Connect and on the Wii,

751
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:23,000
that those games that require activity to play them, I guess do something with your brain,

752
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,000
but it makes you a little bit more of a lucid dreamer.

753
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:31,000
And what lucid dreaming is, is basically it gives you the ability to dream and know you're dreaming

754
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:39,000
and to control your dreams in more, you know, in-depth, like the better of a lucid dreamer you are,

755
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,000
the better you can control it. For the most part, I'm a lucid dreamer.

756
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:47,000
I've always been since I was a kid, but it's come in handy.

757
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:56,000
If one has, you know, nightmares, they try to teach lucid dreaming techniques to like PTSD sufferers,

758
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,000
you know, because nightmares kind of go hand in hand with PTSD.

759
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:10,000
But they were finding this is just preliminary evidence that physically interactive games are more likely associated with lucid dreaming,

760
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:18,000
but they're going to need more research. So they're actually starting to, you know, branch out with that study.

761
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:26,000
It was a cross-sectional study, so it does not show any direct cause and effect, but they've had that correlation lined up.

762
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,000
So we'll see. Hopefully they'll pursue a lot more with it.

763
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:38,000
And they're saying basically the study shouldn't be taken as prescriptive, but that basis does show a direct correlation,

764
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
and it can be used in therapy.

765
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I gotta be honest, it's kind of a foreign concept to me because I am the opposite.

766
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:51,000
I don't remember my dreams, and I haven't really tried to like look into this or thought much about it,

767
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:56,000
but I think there is like a segment of the population that just doesn't like they don't they don't dream.

768
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
It depends. Yeah.

769
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Yeah. I mean, like I just just I mean, I'm not going to say like never ever,

770
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:08,000
because I do know that like there will be once in a great while, like I distinctly remember I must have been falling or something in a dream

771
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,000
because I remember waking up going like I just like hit the ground and that's like when I woke up.

772
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:19,000
But like that type of experience is like once every year, once every six months. It is not common.

773
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:24,000
It is by far more common for me to wake up and that's that's it.

774
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Usually, usually by the time I figure out that I would be lucid dreaming is about the time that I lose it.

775
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:35,000
It's it's like usually have control for about like a few seconds or at least it feels like a few seconds.

776
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:40,000
And it's it's too late. It's like it's like, oh, yeah, I'm dreaming up and I'm up.

777
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:48,000
I've always been able to control it. Like it's only when I'm really like in a really bad mental state

778
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,000
that it's like I know I'm dreaming and don't give a shit. I just want to see where it goes.

779
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:57,000
And it's more like I don't have the will to control it, although I still know I'm dreaming.

780
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:02,000
But I don't think I'd want that. Like for me, like I just I don't know if I'd want that.

781
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,000
I, I don't know my perceptions and your perceptions just based on.

782
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:12,000
I honestly don't know if it has something to do with being autistic as well, because our neurochemistry is different.

783
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,000
But I also feel well, OK. Yeah. Maybe when you get into lucid dreaming, maybe.

784
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:19,000
I mean, I don't know. But like, I feel like more people remember their dreams and talk about dreams.

785
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:23,000
There's dream journals and things like that than people like me who have nothing to talk about.

786
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Like also for me, I dream in color. And it's actually I believe I mean, it's almost 50 50.

787
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,000
But there's a good portion of society that dreams in black and white. And I dream in color.

788
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:42,000
I've heard that. Let me read you the last statement on this. And this comes from the authors of the study.

789
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:55,000
We believe immersion in realistic, controllable virtual environments such as video games is a powerful psychological state that warrants a lot more study, particularly in its overlaps of the characteristics of dream states.

790
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:05,000
And so basically, yeah, they're considering using this study to lead into more study to learn how to do dream therapy.

791
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:10,000
So pretty cool. Video games lead to that. Yeah. Kind of neat.

792
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:17,000
So if you want to be more in control of your dreams, you got to play more Beat Saber or DDR or something.

793
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Although it's some, you know, YYR is in our chat room saying my DDR days haven't ended, but I haven't noticed anything.

794
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:28,000
And I don't think this is like they say, it's not prescriptive. So it's still something that they're studying.

795
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,000
But it is just neat that there could be a correlation there. Right. Right.

796
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:37,000
It's just like we always would tell our parents. Video games help me because it improves my hand-eye coordination.

797
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:41,000
You know, even though we all know that's a line at the same time, it's actually it's also kind of true.

798
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,000
Like, you know, it does help with some of your reaction times and things like that.

799
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,000
It can improve those types of like, you know, motor skills, things like that, too.

800
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,000
So I was doing a little bit of double checking.

801
01:05:52,000 --> 01:06:02,000
And they do say that people actually that people on the autism spectrum do have a little bit more experience in lucid dreaming.

802
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Interesting.

803
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Forty four percent out of the study said that they usually remember their dreams and a good number say they are lucid dreamers.

804
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Huh. So, yeah.

805
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,000
Yeah. Neurochemistry. Science. A little bit of science on this.

806
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:23,000
We see grown men sticking screwdrivers into things and adjusting them.

807
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
So that was MST3K.

808
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:29,000
I like it. All right. Well, let's move on. We have some other stories going on around the gaming world.

809
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Loki. G2A. You got to love them.

810
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Actually, you know, you don't know, you know, you don't have to love them at all.

811
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:42,000
They're they're scum. So G2A, if you're not aware, is a third party key seller for various things.

812
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:48,000
So for many, it's a haven for stolen keys.

813
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:56,000
In fact, I believe last week there was developers coming out saying, hey, we would rather you pirate our game than actually purchase a key from G2A.

814
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,000
I remember that. That was pretty pretty damning.

815
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:10,000
And so G2A, of course, is saying they're going about it in a really strange way of trying to help their reputation by this.

816
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Of course, it's totally going to work out for that reputation.

817
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:25,000
They are they are trying to help their reputation by what reputation for providing some completely unbiased articles.

818
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Articles about G2A.

819
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:44,000
So, for example, they have sent requests to several different gaming outlets saying to the effective, we have a written unbiased article about how selling stolen keys on gaming marketplaces is pretty much impossible.

820
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:50,000
And we want you to publish it on your website without being marked as sponsored or marked as associated with G2A.

821
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:58,000
It's it's a transparent and just review of the problem of the stolen keys reselling.

822
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:06,000
Like, I'm sorry, that's pretty fucking shady right there. Like, yes, of course, it's going to be unbiased coming from the site that it's criticizing.

823
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Right. Yeah. So it just goes to show you they suck and they're just going to continue to suck.

824
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:21,000
I guess and I guess I can probably talk about this. Bobby and Bobby's even saying we did not get this request at VOG, Frown Face.

825
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:25,000
But we do. Bobby, you know, this we get these random emails and the contact us thing all the time.

826
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:29,000
That's like we have an article we'd like to publish about such and such and such.

827
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,000
And Bobby and I just pretty much send those directly to the trash because we're just not interested.

828
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Like, you know, we would we would rather just not make money or just rely on the generosity of those who are participating on Twitch and podcasts and stuff.

829
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Because, like, I don't want that trash on our site. And but it does go to show that some sites you visit may not have those same type of standards.

830
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Now, of course, you're supposed to print some big, you know, promotional piece or something like that.

831
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:03,000
But there's a lot of like even on sites like CNN and sites, you know, are in all of them.

832
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Not just, you know, however you feel about lefty news or righty news, MSNBC, Fox News, you name it, all the same.

833
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:15,000
You go on their website and you scroll down to the bottom and it's also like additional articles suggested by Traffic Brain or something like that.

834
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:20,000
And they're all these like garbage articles that are oftentimes promotional spots.

835
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:24,000
It'll be things like because it's the same stuff that I hear on.

836
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:32,000
It's the same people that I will hear advertising on podcasts like why bleep mattress company provides the best sleep at night or something like that.

837
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Or how you can get a bunch of good night's sleep on a bleep mattress or something like that.

838
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Or, you know, bleep new underwear has this fantastic design that you have to believe.

839
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:48,000
I would do that, but I'd do it in a total monotone.

840
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:54,000
This mattress really helped my back problems. I sound like what's his name?

841
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Stein. Why can't I think of his first name? Ben Stein. Wow.

842
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Why we are in chat says and all of these recommended articles will have these young, attractive people pictured as a way of attracting clicks or it's the opposite.

843
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:14,000
You'll see some like horrendous looking like, like person that's bust out a bridge troll or something.

844
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:21,000
And it says you won't believe what these child stars look like now. And I think they should just bust out a bridge troll to read it.

845
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Yeah. Anyway, so there's we all know there's a lot of garbage on the Internet.

846
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Y'all are educated enough to know that. And the best ones are those articles are all like slide shows or whatever.

847
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,000
So like every single page is only going to have like one person on it.

848
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Yeah. They keep clicking through and they have ads in between everything and then ads on the other pages.

849
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Yeah. Let me ask you soon if he says that you do it in a Miss Vangie voice, but my voice does not get that hard.

850
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:47,000
You want to know what those child celebrities look like now?

851
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,000
Bam, bam. Yeah. All right, Emeril.

852
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:55,000
That number 10 could get these cookies. All right. Anyway, I'm thinking of cookies.

853
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:01,000
My cookies are amazing. Anyway. Oh, I'd like to say real quick.

854
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:15,000
So G2A, of course, responded to this. These emails were sent by our employee without authorization for which we apologize to the outlets that he sent the proposal to.

855
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:21,000
He will fake face strict consequences as this is an absolute absolutely unacceptable.

856
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Sure, you will. Mm hmm.

857
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Metal mayhem in chat says not to sound like I'm self-promoting, but I'm the same way when I post in the one steam group.

858
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:33,000
I don't post about deals and freebies on shady sites. I don't think you're self-promoting.

859
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:42,000
I mean, if we know a good free game deal going on, we usually like we usually update you guys on the PlayStation Plus and Xbox of like, you know, the legit stuff.

860
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:46,000
Yeah. We want people to know because I was going to play any PlayStation key sale.

861
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:51,000
I didn't realize that the Epic Game Store went to weekly releases for free games as opposed to every other week.

862
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:55,000
And now I've missed two games. So I wish I'd had that memo. You know what I mean?

863
01:11:55,000 --> 01:12:04,000
So like, you know, you've got to grab things before you lose them. But yeah, I wouldn't want to trust like shady websites or you can not look and save your money.

864
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:09,000
But if they're free or you can save your time. Yes, I could save my time.

865
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:15,000
But, you know, look, look at the other ways I choose to spend my time, Dark Sakura.

866
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:22,000
We already know what you're on. We already talked about the subjecting myself to the intensity and mental trauma of playing survivor without a one million dollar prize.

867
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:32,000
So look at the look at my life. Look at my choices. Anyway, what else did I want to mention in our chat?

868
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Let's see.

869
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:46,000
I think people are just like making fun of other articles. Questmaster says, I do have the epic game launcher, but just for this free Slime Rancher, I do want to ask about this.

870
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:53,000
And this is kind of like going out of like left field. But I think it's important when we talk about these types of like click bait articles and things like that.

871
01:12:53,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Is that something they teach kids about now? And I guess I'm looking at you because you've got to get they don't teach kids about how to tell what is a spam garbage email versus a legit email.

872
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Maybe they do. And like later on in like certain technology classes, it's a little young for that. They don't do that now.

873
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Let's see. What was my son learning about today? Thanks to YouTube. Oh, gold diggers.

874
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:24,000
He was learning about gold diggers because apparently some stupid YouTuber that he was watching was talking about some gold diggers club in Roblox and how this woman was a gold digger.

875
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:33,000
And I was like, what the fuck are you listening to? I mean, like, I ain't saying she's a gold digger. I hope you asked it just like that, too.

876
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:38,000
No, I'm like, I'm like, what are you listening to? And then he got embarrassed.

877
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:43,000
OK, run, jump, stop actually answers my question in chat. When in doubt, if nobody here knows it, usually somebody in chat knows it.

878
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Thank you. Run, jump, stop says they do in high school history classes at the school I teach at.

879
01:13:48,000 --> 01:14:01,000
So it's like a high school level type of thing. Well, that's that's probably for the best, you know, because I was like, how do people start to learn to distinguish like what's a commercial versus what spam and what's real and stuff?

880
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:08,000
You know, anyway, it's just an interesting part about living in the year twenty nineteen in our very tapped in online world.

881
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Siatabiri says information literacy was an important point they pushed back when I was in library school. Interesting.

882
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:19,000
So and YY says, I was just thinking about this. We have a 14 year old intern in my I.T. department now.

883
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:26,000
And he said they don't currently teach anything about phishing, identity theft, scams or any of that in high school or at least in high school.

884
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Yeah, that's the phishing and how to identify websites that are trying to get password. That's an important skill to know.

885
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Right. There should be like a class just called adulting adulting 101.

886
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,000
I'm serious. Well, you know, they don't put 101 in high school, Rob.

887
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:45,000
But you know what? Back in the day, some of that they used to call home economics.

888
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Right. And I know back in the day day it was a class that was mostly aimed at the girls, although by the time I was in high school, it was a boys and girls class.

889
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:56,000
And you would learn basic like here's how to cook and fend for yourself.

890
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:01,000
Like I kind of think like knowing how to not get phished your bank account information online.

891
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:05,000
That's like that's the home economics we need in 2019. Yeah. No matter what.

892
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:09,000
No matter what your gender is or whatever is expected of you.

893
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:13,000
You know, you need to know all these basics about how to stay safe in an online world.

894
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:19,000
So anyway, that should really be like a required class versus like a second language.

895
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:27,000
I get it. Second language is good to learn. But being able to survive in the world is probably a little bit more useful.

896
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Being able to speak a technical language is still exactly. Although I don't know.

897
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,000
I don't know. I still see that should be counted as a link. The second language.

898
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:39,000
I still see some of the benefit. I don't know. We're starting to get new topic this way outside video games.

899
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:47,000
But I can see some of the benefits still in learning a more classic language like, you know, Spanish or French or, you know, Japanese if your school offers it or whatever.

900
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:54,000
So anyway. All right. Well, let's move on. We better get back to games because we could go on tangent train all night long.

901
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Let's talk about let's talk about the other thing that people need to learn how to do.

902
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:04,000
That is not cheat or report cheaters or identify cheaters. And, you know, Blizzard's got this huge game.

903
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Overwatch like the Overwatch finals third stage were just today. Right.

904
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:15,000
And I heard the Shanghai Dragons won, which is because Shanghai Dragons was the team that was like they didn't have a single frickin win.

905
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,000
And now they're kind of like the comeback kids. So that's really cool.

906
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:25,000
And Shanghai Dragons is the team that I believe is still the lone female in the Overwatch League is on the Shanghai Dragons.

907
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:32,000
But they won. So yay for them. But anyway, Overwatch is obviously still huge.

908
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:37,000
I haven't played it as much as I used to, but I understand it's practically a sport at this point.

909
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
And a lot of people are still super into it.

910
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:48,000
And so, unfortunately, where there's a lot of people and where there is, you know, pro level gaming and potentially even money to be made, you got cheaters that are out there.

911
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Well, in a recent developer update, the game director for Overwatch, Jeff Kaplan, said Blizzard is looking at automatically shutting down matches when it detects cheating.

912
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Now, we don't know all the details yet. And that makes sense because usually you don't want to reveal all the details because then the like robots and the things that, you know, help the cheaters cheat, try to get around that and get ahead of that.

913
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,000
So they're not kind of playing all their cards on how they're going to do this.

914
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:20,000
But it just says that only the cheater will face very harsh actions.

915
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:29,000
You, the non-cheater, will not lose your SR points from a competitive match just because someone joined it wanting to fuck with it and your match gets aborted.

916
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:35,000
So it's kind of interesting. He also mentioned this feature is now live on public test realm servers.

917
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
So they're already kind of looking into it.

918
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:45,000
And again, we don't know exactly what they're doing because obviously if they were to say what they're doing to detect it, then that would just help the cheaters cheat.

919
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:53,000
So we'll see. But the concept of stopping the match completely because someone is cheating, that's kind of the new thing here.

920
01:17:53,000 --> 01:18:01,000
What do you think about that? Like, as opposed to like letting it play out or whatever, just stop. The match is done because somebody is cheating.

921
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,000
I think it's good.

922
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:09,000
Yeah. I think it might be very frustrating for some of the other people in it that aren't cheating, but at least their records aren't being impacted or whatever.

923
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
And you kind of know it's being dealt with, I guess.

924
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:17,000
But I also kind of think the cheaters are still going to find a way around it, but I think it's kind of interesting.

925
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
Or do that to like fuck with matches.

926
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Yeah.

927
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:25,000
YYR says, wait, shutting down the entire match or just kicking the cheaters?

928
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:33,000
No, it's shutting down the entire match, but only punishing the cheater and not impacting anyone else's score.

929
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:40,000
But like, wouldn't that lead to these weird situations where like your team is losing horrifically so somebody cheats on the team and takes a bullet for everybody else?

930
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:45,000
But I guess, I guess that would be silly because you might end up getting banned and that's not a bullet worth taking probably.

931
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
I guess, yeah.

932
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Yeah. Anyway, it's interesting. I just kind of interested to see like where that ends up.

933
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:58,000
I'm curious to see when this starts happening on Twitch and you get some, you know, because lots of people play Overwatch here on Twitch, right?

934
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:03,000
So I'm kind of curious to see what's going to happen when some of these like pro level streamers are playing a game, they're streaming it, and then all of a sudden,

935
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:08,000
book kill switch gets activated, kind of like what the reactions are going to be, what that's going to do.

936
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,000
I'm curious to see what that's, what's going to happen there.

937
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
So more to come on this.

938
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Again, it's in the public test room right now, but yet to hit the live servers.

939
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Who knows if they're even going to say when it hits the live servers, but I guess people will start noticing when their matches just all of a sudden quit.

940
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Right.

941
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Anyway, Dark Sakura.

942
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:35,000
Well, there is going to be a glorious thing happening tomorrow, which is Monday the 15th on Amazon Prime Day.

943
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:42,000
It is the day that preorders for the Turbo Graphics Classic or whatever they're calling it.

944
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:52,000
The Turbo Graphics 16 Mini is going to go on preorder or order or sale or whatever the fuck they're calling it, presale.

945
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Advanced purchase.

946
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Advanced purchase. Thank you.

947
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:59,000
It will be released on March 19th, 2020.

948
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
But here's what's what's really neat about it.

949
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:05,000
By the way, the Japanese version is going to be 10,500 yen, so about 100 bucks.

950
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,000
They haven't done a U.S. price on it yet.

951
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:17,000
But this is the fun thing is that it's coming with 24 American versions of games and 26 Japanese versions.

952
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:21,000
They are going to have both the U.S. and Japanese versions of Utopia.

953
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:26,000
So not yet 50 games, really, because two of them, well, four of them are going to be the same.

954
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Sorry, two of them are going to be the same.

955
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
It's going to be both versions of Utopia.

956
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:35,000
But among the ones that we're going to freakin get, and here's Jamie being happy.

957
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:39,000
We are going to be getting, of course, R-Type because Jamie loves R-Type.

958
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:44,000
It's going to have a Sapphire, which I've covered as a classic game.

959
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:50,000
One of those really awesome shooters.

960
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:56,000
It's going to have Parasol Stars and Cadash on it, which were working designs games.

961
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Snatcher is going to be on it, but it's the Japanese version.

962
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Rondo of Blood is going to be on it.

963
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
You know, I'm happy, you know, there's Space Harrier.

964
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
There's Cho Aniki.

965
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,000
That's awesome.

966
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Yeah.

967
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:13,000
Daimakaimura, which is one of the super graphics games, Ghouls and Ghosts.

968
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
But it's a super graphics game.

969
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Ninja Gaiden, or as that one was, Ninja Ryukenden.

970
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,000
PC Genjin, which was Bonk, Salamander.

971
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:29,000
I mean, Super Darius, Super Star Soldier, Ys I and II.

972
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:33,000
I mean, I'm just beside myself.

973
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:40,000
I got to say, I was not expecting the list to go this deep and be this good.

974
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,000
All dines will be on there, which is another super graphics game.

975
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:47,000
The fact that they're including Japanese stuff that we never even got here.

976
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Gradius II.

977
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,000
That's awesome.

978
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Yeah.

979
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,000
We didn't get Gradius II until that Gradius pack came out later.

980
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:59,000
I feel like more of these will sell than actual Turbo Graphics 16s did in America.

981
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Maybe.

982
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:05,000
It also looks like they're having both versions of Ys Book 1 and 2.

983
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:09,000
But it is the US version of Parasol Stars.

984
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,000
Yeah, that's awesome.

985
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:18,000
J.J. and Jeff, Kaddash, Bonk's Adventure, Bomberman 93, Blazing Lasers, Alien Crush.

986
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Oh, those Crush games are so... Is Devil's Crush there too, or just Alien?

987
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
I don't see Devil's Crush on here.

988
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,000
R-Type.

989
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:29,000
YYR points out the Turbo Graphics 16 mini is an Amazon exclusive.

990
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Yeah.

991
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Worth pointing out.

992
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,000
So it's the only way to get it.

993
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:36,000
And we'll see what happens.

994
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
I think I'm going to do it.

995
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
So I might stay up until midnight.

996
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Oh yeah, just so you can get... Is it going to be midnight Eastern though?

997
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,000
I don't know.

998
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,000
I don't know.

999
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Well, I'll be checking... Yeah, I'll be checking in two hours.

1000
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Yeah.

1001
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
I think I might get one too.

1002
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,000
The game selection is too fucking good on this thing.

1003
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:02,000
And there's some real... Just as a retro gaming fan, how rare some of these games are.

1004
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:06,000
That Castlevania game you paid...

1005
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:07,000
A hundred bones.

1006
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Yeah, like an exchange thing.

1007
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Someone paid me back.

1008
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Yeah.

1009
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
They owed us a hundred bucks and came back with Dracula X.

1010
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Yeah, so that game has been worth a lot historically for collectors.

1011
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
So it's kind of neat.

1012
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Bobby Blackwolf says, I'm going to get it.

1013
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
DJ Rama S says, I'm already planning on getting this.

1014
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
SJ100Matt, I'm considering this.

1015
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,000
All those comments from our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

1016
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:30,000
So you better believe I'm going to be hanging out over here until nine o'clock.

1017
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Just to make sure. I understand.

1018
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
I'm probably going to be right there with you honestly.

1019
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
You don't have to pay the entire hundred up front though, right?

1020
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,000
You just have to...

1021
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
I don't know. It doesn't say.

1022
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Usually on Amazon you don't pay until it ships.

1023
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Yeah, so...

1024
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,000
And now run, jump, stop and our chat is like, damn it, now I want it.

1025
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
It's contagious, isn't it?

1026
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Loki, you in?

1027
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,000
I don't know.

1028
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Turbo Graphics Club, you in?

1029
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:55,000
I do have quite a bit of credit in...

1030
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
This is on the Japanese site though that it's showing this.

1031
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,000
I have quite a bit of credit in Amazon right now, so...

1032
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Yeah, actually I got a gift certificate for like a belated birthday present.

1033
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,000
So yeah, I might...

1034
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Yeah, I got something through my work.

1035
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Put it towards that, yeah.

1036
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,000
All right, anyway.

1037
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Let's move on.

1038
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
A few more stories for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week.

1039
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Loki.

1040
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Let's talk about movies and video game movies.

1041
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,000
Woo.

1042
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Now you know this is going to be good because it's a Space Invaders movie.

1043
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
So New Line Cinemas...

1044
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Is it going to be good, Loki?

1045
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,000
I say that with great sarcasm.

1046
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:33,000
So apparently they're going to try to make a Space Invaders movie.

1047
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:39,000
And currently the script is being written by Greg Russo.

1048
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:45,000
And who has also written, I guess, the Mortal Kombat reboot.

1049
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
I don't know.

1050
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,000
I don't know what the plot's going to be.

1051
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Does it really matter?

1052
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Because it'll come out eventually and either it'll be like absolute shit, like pixels,

1053
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,000
or it may be decent.

1054
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Or it could be like so bad it's actually kind of good like Independence Day.

1055
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,000
That's a sci-fi movie.

1056
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,000
I want it to be like a sci-fi...

1057
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Or like Sharknado.

1058
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Like Sharknado.

1059
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Okay.

1060
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Yeah, I'm with that.

1061
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:16,000
I want my Space Invaders movie to be so bad it's kind of good.

1062
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Yes.

1063
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,000
I'm down.

1064
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:19,000
I'm with it.

1065
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Tara Reid to star in, please.

1066
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:26,000
A movie that will probably be pretty good is actually the Mortal Kombat reboot.

1067
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:30,000
And they have confirmed, also Greg Russo had confirmed that,

1068
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:36,000
yes, it is going to be rated R, and yes, there's even going to be fatalities.

1069
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:42,000
You're going to be there day one because I know how much you love those fatalities.

1070
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Well, I mean, the old Mortal Kombat movie had fatalities,

1071
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:48,000
but they were the more like the same fatalities you would see on Super Nintendo.

1072
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Like I remember the one guy got turned to ice and then shattered into a million pieces.

1073
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Oh, I can't wait.

1074
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Yeah, like that was the Super Nintendo fatality, too.

1075
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
I'd probably go see it just for that.

1076
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:01,000
And then doesn't Shang Tsung like take the soul out of somebody, too?

1077
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:03,000
But those are all very...

1078
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:06,000
I want to see the friendships and the fatalities.

1079
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Like I think they should have all that.

1080
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Yeah, so I don't know.

1081
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
I mean, if it looks like it's really good, I guess,

1082
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:17,000
but I'm going to have to hear how gory it is.

1083
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Because if it's like on the level of these like new Mortal Kombat games

1084
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,000
that are just like too much, I might just need...

1085
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:26,000
I may need to just watch it at home and have somebody tell me, look away.

1086
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,000
OK.

1087
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,000
All right, you can look again.

1088
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Like I'm just going to need to watch it that way. Look away.

1089
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
I need to see how bad it's going to be.

1090
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Pod Culture is asking, will the PG-13 version cut swap out the blood for sweat?

1091
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,000
Well, if the movie does well enough, anything's possible.

1092
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,000
They did a PG-13 version of Deadpool.

1093
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Yeah, that's because that's because they wanted to, you know, get...

1094
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
They wanted more money.

1095
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Well, yes, that's that's why the studios do these things is to get more money.

1096
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:58,000
So I'm just saying Mortal Kombat may have a sweat version as well, I guess.

1097
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Anyway.

1098
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:02,000
All right.

1099
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Moving on.

1100
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Tigerclaw in chat says, James Wan, who directed Aquaman, previously did the Saw movies.

1101
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Also, they cast Sub-Zero.

1102
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Yeah, that's true. They had a Sub-Zero already cast.

1103
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
I was seeing an article on that.

1104
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
But, you know, you know, the guys...

1105
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Just because you directed Saw doesn't mean like I have something against you or something.

1106
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
I just don't care for those movies.

1107
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:26,000
But, I think he did Saw 3 and 4.

1108
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
I like the Saw movies.

1109
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
I just don't remember where I left off.

1110
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
So I don't know what to start over.

1111
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
You know, there's like a new Saw movie.

1112
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:35,000
They're rebooting it.

1113
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Chris Rock and Samuel L. Jackson.

1114
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
They're both confirmed they're in it.

1115
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Chris Rock is the star of the new Saw movie.

1116
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:42,000
I need to see that.

1117
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
I don't associate him with scary movies.

1118
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
But maybe he's trying to reinvent himself. I don't know.

1119
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
But anyway, I didn't want to talk about...

1120
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Well, Saw 3 and 4, the director of those was the guy that did Repo, the genetic opera.

1121
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Which is also... It's a little violent.

1122
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
But it's one of those movies that kind of grew on me.

1123
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Just because the music is really good.

1124
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:06,000
And it's Anthony Stewart Head and Sarah Brightman in a movie with Paris Hilton.

1125
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
Is Sarah Brightman not sounding terrible?

1126
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Paris Hilton in a role that actually makes a lot of sense for Paris Hilton.

1127
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Yeah, Repo, the genetic opera is...

1128
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
It took a couple of watches.

1129
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
But then I was like...

1130
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:21,000
I get why people really love this movie.

1131
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:23,000
And then the whole cult thing.

1132
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:27,000
I've been to the Rocky Horror style performances that are really astonishing.

1133
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:31,000
And I hear another one's coming soon. We'll see.

1134
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Anyway, moving on.

1135
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Tigerclaw says the actor that they got is someone who is in the raid.

1136
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Dark Tetsuya says I wonder if the gore will be in line with Mortal Kombat 9, 10, 11 in that case.

1137
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,000
I would anticipate probably it's going to be more along the lines of the reboot.

1138
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,000
So that's why I kind of want to just... No more detail.

1139
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Alright. Anyway.

1140
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,000
So for the record, by the way, to go back to the PC Engine thing.

1141
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
I don't see it on the US site at all.

1142
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:02,000
The link was for the Japanese site which links back to the Italian site and the UK site.

1143
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:06,000
I'm sure it will be up on the US store. It's supposed to be a US release thing.

1144
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
So it's probably just not there yet.

1145
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
I'm looking at the early...

1146
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Japan is also on tomorrow right now. So maybe that's why.

1147
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Maybe.

1148
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Anyway.

1149
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:21,000
So there was a new game that was going to be on its way out called Ion Maiden.

1150
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Remember? And then there was the whole lawsuit.

1151
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Because Iron Maiden was none too happy about that.

1152
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,000
And I didn't know this. I learned this watching Bobby Black Wolf tonight.

1153
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:32,000
I learned things on the Bobby Black Wolf show, believe it or not.

1154
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
And Dark Soccer, you probably know this.

1155
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Iron Maiden has a pinball table.

1156
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
I did not know. They have a brand new pinball table.

1157
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
I think I mentioned it on the show.

1158
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:44,000
You probably did. But you did it long enough ago

1159
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:47,000
where I didn't connect the dots until tonight when Bobby brought it up.

1160
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:51,000
I was like, oh, so Iron Maiden does have an interest in gaming

1161
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:56,000
and making sure that their name for gaming purposes and gaming protection is like...

1162
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
So they kind of have a purpose to do that.

1163
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:03,000
So I was like, this makes a lot more sense why they went after Ion Maiden.

1164
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:09,000
So anyhow, Ion Maiden has chosen, instead of going through a big court fight,

1165
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
they are going to change the name of their game.

1166
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:14,000
The game is now called Ion Fury.

1167
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:18,000
And in a statement, Mike Nielsen, who's the CEO of 3D Realms, said,

1168
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:21,000
After careful consideration, we've decided to rename our first-person shooter,

1169
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
Ion Maiden, to Ion Fury.

1170
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
A lot of thought went into this, but most importantly,

1171
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:28,000
it would be a disservice to our loyal fanbase and the fantastic developers

1172
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
to drag out a long lawsuit.

1173
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
The amazing gameplay, interactivity, and pure fun

1174
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:36,000
is what makes Ion Fury a great game, not the title.

1175
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:39,000
And is anyone surprised that this is what ended up happening?

1176
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Nope. Nope. Nope. Thought so.

1177
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:46,000
It's just, you know, it got settled before it ever went to court

1178
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
and would be a waste of everyone's time.

1179
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,000
And, you know, maybe they thought Iron Maiden would be flattered.

1180
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:54,000
And maybe to some extent they still are, but because of the pinball machine

1181
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
and maybe other things, who knows it's brewing,

1182
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:00,000
that, you know, you have to protect your intellectual property, right?

1183
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:03,000
It's like Nintendo. As much as we get fed up with how often they shut down sites,

1184
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:07,000
if you don't actively enforce your intellectual property, you might lose it.

1185
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
So they kind of have to do what they do.

1186
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:12,000
And maybe to some extent, Iron Maiden felt that need as well.

1187
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
So, anyway.

1188
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Dar Tetsuya points out, one of the local pizza places here

1189
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,000
has the Iron Maiden table, though I haven't gotten around to playing on it yet.

1190
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,000
I want to check that out at some point.

1191
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
Does the place downtown with all the pinball machines have it?

1192
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Because they seem to have a lot of newer pinball machines.

1193
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:31,000
They've had it around, I think, before, but mostly I've just played at cons.

1194
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Interesting. All right.

1195
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Yeah, I mean, California Extremes in a couple weeks, so I'm sure they'll have it there.

1196
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:40,000
I really hope I can go to California Extreme this year, but I don't know.

1197
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:45,000
Unfortunately, now that weekend shares the distinction with being the anniversary of my mom passing.

1198
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:49,000
So it's like if there's family stuff going on, obviously I'm going to do that instead.

1199
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:52,000
But if it works out to go to a California Extreme, I'd really love to do that.

1200
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
So, anyhow.

1201
01:31:54,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Well, speaking of classic game shows, why not take a moment to take a trip down memory lane

1202
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
and visit a classic game of the week?

1203
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Every week, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,

1204
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:12,000
hey, you guys need to recognize the importance of classic games, especially this week's game.

1205
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:16,000
This is a pretty big one, I think, that's been highly influential.

1206
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,000
So let's talk about it.

1207
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:20,000
I went way back for this. We're looking at a 40-year-old game.

1208
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,000
But this is very important. What is the classic game of the week this week?

1209
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Galaxian. Yes, Galaxian came out in 1979 by Namco.

1210
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:34,000
It was licensed to Midway Games to distribute and manufacture here in North America.

1211
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:40,000
So basically, if you played Galaga, you played Galaxian. It's the same type of game.

1212
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:46,000
You have your little ship at the bottom, and you have to kill the Galaxian aliens.

1213
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
They will show and fly in formation.

1214
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:55,000
But it was created as a direct response to Space Invaders, which was released by Taito a year before.

1215
01:32:55,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Its development was headed by Sawano Kazunori, who produced electromechanical shooting gallery games for Namco.

1216
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:11,000
And the programming was done by Tashiro Koichi.

1217
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Anyway, they didn't really expect it to do great, but it really was a great seller.

1218
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:25,000
They had 40,000 arcade units out in North America by 1982.

1219
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:35,000
It wasn't the first color arcade game, but it had RGB color graphics integrated into the animations and explosions.

1220
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:39,000
So it really did more with color graphics for its time.

1221
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:46,000
And for the record, the Japanese release was October 1979, and North American was December 1979.

1222
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
So both of them were in the 70s.

1223
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:53,000
And then, of course, the successor to this was Galaga.

1224
01:33:53,000 --> 01:34:02,000
And it actually replaced Galaxian in terms of popularity during the Golden Age of arcade games.

1225
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:07,000
And then Galaxian has had other home releases. I'll get into that in a bit.

1226
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:13,000
But again, it's a fixed shooter type of game, kind of that gallery style.

1227
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Your ship is called the Galaxip, G-A-L-A-X-I-P, and you have to kill the Galaxians.

1228
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:27,000
So as far as its development, it was developed in 1979 as well and released in Japan that year.

1229
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:33,000
They wanted to take and improve upon Space Invaders, which was at its time very revolutionary.

1230
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:39,000
So they put in that new technology in its arcade board, and it was also called the Namco Galaxian board.

1231
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:49,000
And so it had a full color screen, it had enemies that moved around, you had your own ship that moved about.

1232
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:57,000
And the Galaxian arcade board also introduced tile map hardware.

1233
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:08,000
So it would render a tile map that was 8x8 pixel tiles, which reduced processing memory requirements up to 64 times over Space Invaders.

1234
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:14,000
So the whole, you know, what into it was really a bunch of innovation from what had been out before.

1235
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:25,000
At any rate, we had other releases. We had Galaga, we had Galplus that came out in 1984, you know, went along the same type of gameplay.

1236
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:35,000
And then there was Galaga 88 and 87, and then there was Galaga Arrangement that came out with the Namco Classics Collection Volume 1 in 1985.

1237
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:45,000
The Namco Galaxian board was also used for later games such as Nintendo's Radarscope and Donkey Kong.

1238
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:51,000
And then home consoles incorporated a lot of the same technology.

1239
01:35:51,000 --> 01:36:02,000
So as far as there being other ports, Atari did its own versions of Galaxian for the various 8-bit families, the Atari 2600 and the Atari 5200.

1240
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:14,000
There were other ports that were under the Atari Soft label, which released some for Apple II, ColecoVision, Commodore 64, the VIC-20, the IBM PC, and the ZX Spectrum.

1241
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:25,000
There were other ports that came out for MSX in Europe and Japan, NECPC-8801 and the Famicon that was in Japan, and the Sharp X1.

1242
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Bally Astrocade version was also published as Galaxian but changed it to Galactic Invasion.

1243
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Coleco did a standalone mini-arcade tabletop, remember those? The little standalone machines?

1244
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:44,000
So they did Galaxian in 1981, and also of course did Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, and Frogger.

1245
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:55,000
Entex did a handheld version of it called Galaxian 2, and it was called Galaxian 2 because it had two-player mode. It was not a sequel.

1246
01:36:55,000 --> 01:37:02,000
So at any rate, other re-releases that happened, we had the Namco Museum versions that released.

1247
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Galaxian and Galaga were bundled together for the Game Boy for Arcade Classics 3.

1248
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:12,000
Galaxian was released on Windows in 1995 as part of Microsoft Return of Arcade.

1249
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:19,000
There was also a release of it in Pac-Man's Arcade Party 30th Anniversary arcade machine.

1250
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:25,000
It has also been part of the Jack-specific Plug It In and Play TV game controllers.

1251
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:41,000
Galaxian as well as Galaga, Gal Plus, and Galaga 88 was, quote, redesigned and modernized as an iPhone app called Galaga 30th Anniversary Collection that commemorated the anniversary for Namco Bandai.

1252
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:46,000
And then Super Impulse also did the standalone tiny arcade version of Galaxian.

1253
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Galaxian has really gone in to be in so, like, the ship, and it has been in so many other games that I'm not even gonna freaking list them all.

1254
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:05,000
Including multiple Tekken games, you know, Super Smash Brothers, some Pac-Man games, basically just all kinds of things, including a game called Tinkle Pit.

1255
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Yeah, that little flower that's at the top of every board, or I guess a spaceship that looks like a flower, that is like iconic with Namco, you know what I mean?

1256
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,000
Yeah.

1257
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Yeah.

1258
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:23,000
So, of course, the Galaxian world record was a focus of competitive, you know, issue.

1259
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:43,000
There was a, actually it looks like there was a big rivalry between a British fellow named Gary Whelan and an American named Perry Rogers who faced off at the Apollo Amusements in Pompano Beach, Florida on the 6th through the 9th of April 2006.

1260
01:38:43,000 --> 01:39:06,000
And Whelan had the world record of 1,114,550 points and was beaten by a netherlander named Arte van Wielet who scored 1,653,270 points on May 27, 2009 at Fun Spot Family Center in Wiers Beach, New Hampshire.

1261
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
And there you go.

1262
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Galaxian in the arcade.

1263
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
That's older than a lot of y'all.

1264
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:17,000
Yeah, obviously on a multitude of platforms later on.

1265
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
I was three.

1266
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Great pick, thank you.

1267
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:38,000
And yeah, it's kind of, it's interesting because obviously I know I used to get that game confused with Galaga all the time, although obviously we understand they have a lot in common, you know, and Galaga obviously built on it with the whole like the double ship thing is very iconic in Galaga and, you know, just there's bonus rounds and other things.

1268
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:39,000
I don't know if I've ever done Galplus though.

1269
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:40,000
Galplus?

1270
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Galplus?

1271
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:45,000
I don't, I think I've played it once or twice, but I don't really remember it the same.

1272
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
You know, I don't think it made quite as...

1273
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:50,000
I played Galplus at California Extreme. They've had it there the last few years.

1274
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Right.

1275
01:39:51,000 --> 01:40:06,000
But like Galaxian, I mean, you know, it is, yes, an older game and so if you, especially if you're looking at the footage, you probably go, okay, it looks a little basic, but at the same time, it's like, okay, but consider that Space Invaders transformed the video game industry, especially when it came to Japan.

1276
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Like, you know, they were running out of the equivalent of quarters over there for people playing those games because Space Invaders was so freaking popular.

1277
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:18,000
I want to say it was like a 5 yen coin shortage.

1278
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,000
Yeah.

1279
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:20,000
So it was pretty crazy.

1280
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Yeah. And so, you know, Galaxian is this interesting kind of evolution of that.

1281
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:34,000
So obviously, you know, it was kind of like, okay, now what does this idea look like two years later where now the Space Invaders move beyond just this marching pattern.

1282
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:41,000
And obviously you kind of see all the differences in that game that kind of led to some of the shooters that then followed in the late 80s.

1283
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:49,000
I would say, you know, looking at that game in some ways, I see ways that it influenced a game like JIRUS, you know, even though it's, you know, very different and, you know, many shooters that came after it.

1284
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:59,000
And one thing I have really noticed is that when a game comes out, there's going to be a group that loves it and is going to try to improve on it.

1285
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Yeah.

1286
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:04,000
But it's always what I say. Be critical of the things that you love. Always make them better.

1287
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,000
All right. Well, thank you for that classic game of the week.

1288
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:10,000
We don't have a break segment tonight. We're just going to power through tonight.

1289
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
I didn't have time to get a video done.

1290
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:20,000
I have to admit one thing that also has been taking up my time this past week is that I binged Stranger Things 3.

1291
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
Yes.

1292
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Don't worry. I'm not going to spoil. I might be a bitch, but I'm not that bitch.

1293
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
OK, so I'm not going to say anything, but I did.

1294
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:34,000
I actually part of the reason why I binged it was because I was worried about getting spoiled.

1295
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Yes.

1296
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:45,000
And in fact, then my husband blurted something out that I guess he had read online or something and he's like, doesn't and he said something and I was like, what the fuck?

1297
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:49,000
You know, I'm watching right now. Now, luckily, what he said was kind of not right.

1298
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
So I was thankful.

1299
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:57,000
But, you know, I'm like, that's part of the reason why I felt the need to power through, because I'm like, it's just a matter of time before I get spoiled on Twitter.

1300
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:01,000
And now I realize some of the things I've been seeing were spoilers.

1301
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
They just weren't labeled as such.

1302
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:07,000
So and they were, I should say, more minor.

1303
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Don't worry. Like, if you're suddenly going through your head, what could have been a spoiler?

1304
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
I'm just saying there were definitely like references.

1305
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:15,000
I realized were references until like, oh, now that I'm finished with it.

1306
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:21,000
So there's that weird thing that they have going on with where you can download Microsoft one point or something like that.

1307
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:26,000
But it's a Stranger Things like mini game that Microsoft's doing.

1308
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Have you even seen that? I think a Windows one.

1309
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Yeah. Windows assignment.

1310
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:37,000
And Alan saw at Target there was one because, you know, I collect these those little mini arcade machines.

1311
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:48,000
And they had one that was like a Stranger Things machine, but it had like 50 games in it because it had some Namco classics in it, apparently, and then some random like Stranger Things game.

1312
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:54,000
They all look like like garbagey cell phone games. It was interesting that they kind of crammed that all in a little cabinet.

1313
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
License the crap out of it.

1314
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Well, yeah, they're they're going hog wild with the 80s references with Stranger Things three and all that.

1315
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:06,000
So, you know, it's kind of, you know, but it's a it's a good show. I liked it overall.

1316
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:10,000
I there's a few things about the plot. But again, I'm not going to go down that road.

1317
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:13,000
I've just I was just kind of a few things to maybe go.

1318
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:16,000
I don't know. I don't know if I like how they did that. But overall, I really liked it.

1319
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Yeah. Yeah. It's a good show. Anyway.

1320
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:25,000
Dark Tetsuya in chat says, oh, the Stranger Things mini arcade. I saw a review. It looks awful.

1321
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:31,000
It's just it's just a bunch of cheap games thrown in. You know, it's they and they have these go.

1322
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:41,000
I swear when I was at Fry's not that long ago, like in the selection that had all the PlayStation one minis trying to offload and some of whatever was left of the NES and SNES minis.

1323
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:48,000
There are all sorts of fucking minis now. Like everybody is getting on board with these minis and they were already like, you know.

1324
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Oh, yeah, that is weird. They sold those little joysticks that had like Pac-Man built into it and stuff.

1325
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Like they've been selling that type of stuff for a long time. And now that stuff is like really that looks like crap.

1326
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Yeah. I even told Alan, I said, you don't really need to buy that for me.

1327
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:09,000
Yeah, it's got some Namco games and 16 Stranger Things themed game.

1328
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Yeah. And if you look at the Stranger Things games, they don't look there's like a match three.

1329
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:18,000
And, you know, it's all your tropes that don't look that great. Let's see.

1330
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:21,000
See a Tiberian chat says, I will not complain about a Winona Ryder vehicle.

1331
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:27,000
Well, she's great. And that what's her name? That plays 11 Millie Bobby Brown.

1332
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:30,000
They're going to nominate her for an Emmy again. Guarantee it.

1333
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Here's the more important thing that they have, though, the Dungeons and Dragons starter set.

1334
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:39,000
The Stranger Things edition, because that's yeah, that's a big part of. Yeah, absolutely.

1335
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:44,000
Everything. Everything's got Stranger Things. I will say this. This isn't spoilery.

1336
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Now that the kids are getting older and you can actually see like they look older. Right.

1337
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:55,000
Like, you know, it's been like two and a half years. You can see them like growing up now that they look older because they are getting older.

1338
01:44:55,000 --> 01:45:06,000
They're not afraid to put them in more danger. And so like some of the scenes are really tense because, you know, you might see a kid get hurt because the kids are getting older.

1339
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:12,000
So they're, you know, kind of willing to put them in more dangerous scenarios. So it's just kind of interesting.

1340
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:17,000
Yeah. Anyway. All right. Moving on.

1341
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Guys, you know, in chat says no binge. I watch one episode a day in my VR theater. If you binge, you miss stuff.

1342
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:29,000
I can say I don't like to I don't like to binge a lot of shows, but that one I binged. That's a pretty hard generalization.

1343
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:36,000
What? If you binge, you miss stuff. I think it just depends on who you are and you know how you watch stuff. So, yeah.

1344
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:41,000
As Joe and Hunter Matt says, apparently they're doing a fourth season and it's reportedly the last. Yes.

1345
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:47,000
I've heard that they're going to end it at four or five. And that would make sense because those kids those kids are going to be like full on.

1346
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:52,000
I think they're probably what it's hard to carry on the story.

1347
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:56,000
I mean, yeah, it's got to come to an end at some point. It's going to have to.

1348
01:45:56,000 --> 01:46:00,000
So they have it like, oh, God save the world again. Oh, God save the world again. Oh, God save the world.

1349
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:07,000
It's like you got to at some point. I think they're looking for a way desperately to spin it off.

1350
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:12,000
And you saw that in the last season. And I wish nobody like that.

1351
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:17,000
Nobody liked that episode. And there is nothing like that in season three. I will say that.

1352
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:22,000
But I do think there are other ways that they have set little clues that they could spin it off.

1353
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:27,000
So I think that's what's going to happen. There's only going to be four or five episodes of Stranger Things, but there will be a spin off.

1354
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:33,000
Absolutely. Fucking look at Game of Thrones. You know, HBO didn't really want that ended badly.

1355
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:37,000
So there. Well, yeah, we all heard the ending was horrible, but we know that we already know there.

1356
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:43,000
I watched it. It was terrible. I know it was on Sunday nights. I know you can watch on demand and stuff.

1357
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:48,000
I just don't didn't care enough. But they're spinning that off.

1358
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:53,000
So that that's what I think will happen to Stranger Things. They do four or five seasons, then they're going to spin it off.

1359
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:59,000
So. All right. Pod culture says hopefully they keep the VHS style packaging for the next seasons.

1360
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:04,000
I picked up the first two hella cheap at Target. Oh, I'm sure they will. I'm sure. Anyway.

1361
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:09,000
All right. Let's move on. Let's get into some other gaming news as we travel around and look at some rapid fire.

1362
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:13,000
Some fast news for the week. Loki. Yes. Some breathtaking mods out there.

1363
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:19,000
So we've got one familiar solid five that allows you to play as, of course, Keanu Reeves.

1364
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:28,000
But, you know, John. Yes. John Wick or Silverhand from Cyberpunk 2077.

1365
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:35,000
And of course, it's amazing. And you can go check it out.

1366
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Yeah, I know. You know, I think I have this game from some sort of bundle, but I haven't bothered to actually play it.

1367
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:47,000
So maybe I have to go do this now. That's on Nexus mods, if you're interested.

1368
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:55,000
And then another game that is on Steam that I know I was interested in when I saw the first trailer for it, because I do love Goat Simulator.

1369
01:47:55,000 --> 01:48:00,000
However, this does not tie in with Goat Simulator, but it's the same type of thing.

1370
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:09,000
It's called Goat of Duty. And it's basically the puts the players in the role of a goat with this cybernetic arm that has guns attached to it.

1371
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:13,000
And you're basically fighting each other in the Call of Duty style game.

1372
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:19,000
But it has a lot of weird stuff that you can do in there. You can throw down tornadoes. You can fake your death.

1373
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:27,000
You feign death. He has a two hundred and fifty bleeds you can do, which is pretty amazing.

1374
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:37,000
But it is out in early access right now, so you can actually pick it up for $5.94 during the launch week or $6.99 when the sale ends on the 17th.

1375
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:40,000
I may have to pick this up.

1376
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:43,000
I was going to say, that was a very specific price, but I get it. It's a discount. Okay, I get it.

1377
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:46,000
Yeah, yeah. It's probably like a 10% discount or something.

1378
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:58,000
Yeah, sounds like it. Anyway, hey, if you still have not played the Arkham trilogy, the Batman Arkham trilogy, which was like Arkham City, Arkham Knight, Arkham Asylum.

1379
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:01,000
I don't even remember all the games that were in it, but I know they were all good games, though.

1380
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:08,000
They were fun. Yeah, Arkham Asylum was the first one. Then it was Arkham City was the second one, and then Arkham Knight was the last one.

1381
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:12,000
Okay, so I did get them all the titles right. So anyway, that was the trilogy. Some of you may still not have played it.

1382
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:27,000
Well, guess what? Thanks to an Amazon leak, we know that there's going to be a Steelbook release coming out. It's the Batman Arkham Collection Steelbook edition, which will have, or I could have looked at the story, and it's all right here, which will have Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Arkham Knight. It's more fun to quiz myself.

1383
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:30,000
But you knew it, though. You were doubting yourself.

1384
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:34,000
But remember, there was another one. There was Arkham Origins that was done by a different studio.

1385
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Right. Yeah, that won't be a part of this. This is the Rocksteady releases.

1386
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Rocksteady did confirm that the leak was a legit thing, so this will be happening.

1387
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:51,000
And I'm sure if you're a collector and you like to get things like Steelbooks and stuff, this will probably be something you're really into.

1388
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:56,000
And it does sound like it's going to be physical discs, not just digital downloads.

1389
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:03,000
You will get the post-release content, and there will be, I guess, an Earth to Dark Knight skin for the PS4 edition.

1390
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Anyway, if you have yet to get this trilogy, maybe now's the time. You can get it on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on September 6th for $50.

1391
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:16,000
They were good games, though. I didn't beat any of them. I played them all, but I didn't beat them.

1392
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:24,000
Anyway, apparently there was rumors this week that Final Fantasy VII's remake was going to be coming out for Xbox One.

1393
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:33,000
And this was due to Xbox Germany apparently posting information about Final Fantasy VII Remake and then suddenly pulling it.

1394
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:37,000
It was dubbed an internal mistake, and that's all that was there.

1395
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:44,000
Apparently it had said that the remake would come to Xbox One in March of 2020, right when the PlayStation 4 version would come out,

1396
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:50,000
which totally counter-dicted when they announced the game originally that it would be on PlayStation 4 first.

1397
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Well, in a follow-up statement, Square Enix did say they have no plans for other platforms, which is their nice way of saying PlayStation first.

1398
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:05,000
But, I mean, maybe PlayStation first, but then maybe by the time they get to Episode 2 and 3,

1399
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:10,000
and this game gets its own inevitable steelbook edition that has everything in it, because you all know that's how this ends.

1400
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:14,000
Maybe that's the one that'll turn out on Xbox One. We'll see.

1401
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:17,000
Anyway, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us for Rapid Fire?

1402
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:27,000
So, for people who are waiting for Psychonauts 2, it has been delayed until 2020 to come out on PC and consoles,

1403
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:37,000
and it will actually be published by Microsoft as a first-party title, though it is still going to be coming out on the PS4.

1404
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:44,000
So there's apologies around, but it's what they're doing to get it out, so it is what it is, right?

1405
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:53,000
So, in other news, and this is something that harkens back, harkens back to another thing.

1406
01:51:53,000 --> 01:52:01,000
It was a classic game that I talked about that was by Sunsoft that came out as Journey to Silius. I talked about the music in it.

1407
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:04,000
Yeah, I was going to say, to be fair, it was classic soundtrack, but yes.

1408
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:08,000
Soundtrack, yeah. But it was supposed to have been a Terminator game.

1409
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:18,000
Well, there is a promo video that was acquired by Gaming Alexandria that Sunsoft made to promote the game at Winter CES 1989.

1410
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:29,000
So, basically, they lost the license for the game, and then, well, basically, they lost the license after they abandoned the movie plot.

1411
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:36,000
So, it's just completely, you know, they completely fucked it up, so they lost their license.

1412
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:47,000
At any rate, though, there also were, it looks like apart from the video that, yeah, some people saw some sprite sheets for it, too.

1413
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:53,000
But really, it's the video that's the big one, and if anyone wants to watch the video who's in chat, I'll happily post a link to it.

1414
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Just don't watch it right now.

1415
01:52:55,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Yeah. There's other things going on right now, yes. I got you. All right, pretty cool.

1416
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:05,000
All right, it's always fun when we talk about a classic game, and then it's, like, in the news that week or a later week.

1417
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:09,000
It's kind of fun how that all kind of circles back around at some point, so.

1418
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:18,000
All right, well, moving on. Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and what is coming out in a game store near you this week.

1419
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Loki, starting with us.

1420
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Not much, but there is one game, and it's pretty good. So, on the Nintendo Switch, Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3, the Black Order.

1421
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
Oh, yeah. Yeah, some people are going to be interested in that.

1422
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:34,000
Yeah, some people. I am one of those people. I wish it was on more systems.

1423
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Gotcha. Well, traveling over to Japan, last week was kind of a slow week. I feel like it's picking up a little bit more this week.

1424
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:48,000
On July 18th, we get Pro Yakyuu's Spirits is coming out. It's a baseball game. Professional baseball spirits would be the way it translates in English.

1425
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
That is coming out this week in Japan.

1426
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
What? It doesn't have the little bobblehead, guys.

1427
01:53:53,000 --> 01:54:01,000
It's very photorealistic, this one. So, yeah, and it actually says they captured the faces of the players from photographing, and 3D data was used to make the models.

1428
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
It looks really realistic.

1429
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:08,000
But it used to be not realistic. This is the same Konami game.

1430
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:14,000
I think there's pro, and there's not pro. I think it's the difference. But anyway.

1431
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
And baseball in Japan?

1432
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:17,000
Oh, sure.

1433
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Fairly religious.

1434
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:22,000
Big deal. So, pretty cool that that's on its way out, and I'm sure some people will be into that.

1435
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:26,000
And that's a game that you're not going to ever see released here, because it is Japanese baseball.

1436
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:31,000
And I'm sure even though there might be some fans of that here, it's just not enough to justify the cost of releasing the game here.

1437
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:34,000
So some of you may import that on your region-free devices.

1438
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:38,000
Some other games out this week. Kingdom Come Deliverance in Japan this week.

1439
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
Also, Judgment gets a price reduction.

1440
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:45,000
And The Sims 4 moves into Best Hits and gets a price reduction in Japan this week.

1441
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:49,000
Also, a game called Lotus Labyrinth is coming out this week on the PlayStation 4.

1442
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:52,000
Checking out the Nintendo Switch real quick.

1443
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:56,000
We don't have that same baseball game, but we do have Lotus Labyrinth is also out there.

1444
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:01,000
As well as a game called Sumikko Gurashi, School Life Begins.

1445
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:05,000
Oh, I buy those notebooks with the little kappa character on it.

1446
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:10,000
I think one of the Senex things, or like the Senex things.

1447
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:14,000
Oh yeah, the little chibi little penguin and fluffy things.

1448
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:17,000
There's like a kappa who has a cucumber and everything.

1449
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:20,000
Yep, yep, that's it. He's there in the back of the box.

1450
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
I have a bunch of those notebooks that I use at work.

1451
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:23,000
Oh, cute.

1452
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
I get them at Ichiban-kan.

1453
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:30,000
Yeah, this says they might be able to settle down when they're in the corners, but they don't like being in the center of the room.

1454
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:33,000
Can relate.

1455
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:34,000
Alright.

1456
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
Hashtag mood.

1457
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
Let's go over to the UK, Darsakura.

1458
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:43,000
We have FIIA European Truck Racing Championship on July 27th.

1459
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:46,000
The following games are on the 18th.

1460
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:49,000
We have Redeemer Enhanced Edition.

1461
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:53,000
We have Cities Skyline Nintendo Switch Edition.

1462
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:57,000
We have Kingdom Come Deliverance Royal Collectors Edition.

1463
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:02,000
And then, last but not least, Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3 for Switch.

1464
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
Which a lot of people are going to be excited about.

1465
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:08,000
Was this Comic-Con weekend? I'm surprised we didn't see a lot come out of those panels yet.

1466
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
Unless people are just like, oh my god.

1467
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:15,000
Or maybe it just wasn't a lot of, or I guess I forgot to see if there was anything really big that came out of that.

1468
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,000
People are still losing their shit.

1469
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Will you check some of the big headline sites to see if we missed anything from Comic-Con?

1470
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
Just want to make sure we covered all the bases there.

1471
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
So, as far as, I don't care about the movies.

1472
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:29,000
I care more about the, because Marvel was going to have a panel and the Avengers game was supposed to show up there too.

1473
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:32,000
And I remember it wasn't so well received in E3.

1474
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:39,000
Yeah, and from what I hear, they did show gameplay and that gameplay is not going to come out.

1475
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:40,000
What?

1476
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:43,000
Like they're not going to release the gameplay video out to everyone.

1477
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:46,000
Oh, it was one of the in the hall only. Got it, got it. Alright.

1478
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:49,000
Well, let's move on. We're going to go to the mailbag.

1479
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:52,000
Every week we invite your emails that participate at Orangelaunchradio.com.

1480
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:56,000
And we read some of our favorite emails on the show, or in some cases we do.

1481
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:00,000
And Comic-Con's not until, San Diego Comic-Con's not until this coming week.

1482
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,000
Oh, it's the coming week. Okay. Sorry, I thought we missed it.

1483
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:06,000
No, but I hear though that the footage they're going to show, they're not going to...

1484
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:10,000
Okay, so you got to be there to see it. Okay. Sorry.

1485
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
Yes, DarkSakura, one email this week.

1486
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:15,000
Hello, Alar. Hi, YYR.

1487
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:20,000
I just wanted to take a quick moment to clarify something I mentioned on last week's episode.

1488
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:24,000
The Justifier light guns available on Genesis were not a Sega product at all.

1489
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
They were made by Konami.

1490
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:31,000
The light guns were specifically created for use with the home versions of Lethal Enforcers games.

1491
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:36,000
And if you like your gameplay sanitized, you can get a Justifier for use with the stripe of Nintendo also.

1492
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:40,000
Well, that's it. Thanks for bringing us another great show. Yay.

1493
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Warm regards, Aaron YYR.

1494
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:48,000
Which I think is absolutely funny that the confidentiality statement at the end of this is longer than the email.

1495
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
Good job.

1496
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
That's how it goes.

1497
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:56,000
Well, you know what, YYR, thank you for another good, I guess, fact checking.

1498
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:57,000
Observation.

1499
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:59,000
Yeah, observation. I like that.

1500
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
Thank you for your clarification.

1501
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
There you go.

1502
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:06,000
Alright, well, there's nothing for us to respond to in that, however.

1503
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
It's just, uh, no.

1504
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
Drag Race talk!

1505
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
No, there's no Drag Race on now anyway.

1506
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
Drag Race Canada's coming on.

1507
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
I guess you could talk about Dragula.

1508
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:17,000
Dragula?

1509
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:21,000
Having been to one of the Boulay Brothers events, though, that's a pretty stellar show.

1510
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:24,000
But we got an email, so no tangent this week.

1511
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
Ruining my fun. Eat a cookie.

1512
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
After the show. I'll have a cookie in a little bit.

1513
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
Tell everyone what my cookies are like.

1514
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:31,000
They're good.

1515
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
All my cookies are good.

1516
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:36,000
My cookies bring more carbs to my tummy.

1517
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:39,000
Alright, moving on, we got some more gaming stories for you guys,

1518
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
and then we're gonna get to our Discord calls,

1519
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
as well as if you have any chat questions.

1520
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
Let's get to it. Loki.

1521
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:52,000
So Ubisoft, of course, released their story creator tool for Assassin's Creed Odyssey

1522
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:57,000
that lots of people have been creating their own custom quests and stuff,

1523
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:00,000
but of course, like most things, when you put out a tool

1524
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:04,000
that allows you to create custom things or mods for a game,

1525
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:09,000
you're gonna have people using it to exploit easy XP boosting.

1526
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:13,000
And so now they've decided to say that...

1527
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
Here's what Ubisoft says.

1528
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:19,000
These exploits risk jeopardizing the overall quality and integrity and purpose

1529
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:23,000
of the story creator mode and results in less visibility for the creative,

1530
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:27,000
interesting, and frankly fantastic community stories that have been published.

1531
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
That's what they say.

1532
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:33,000
But here's one thing you have to understand about Assassin's Creed Odyssey.

1533
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:37,000
They sell XP boosts in their storefront.

1534
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:42,000
That's why they're mad that people are making free XP boost quests,

1535
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
because they want to sell them to you,

1536
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:49,000
and it is in fact jeopardizing the overall quality and integrity

1537
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:56,000
and purpose of their in-game storefront, is really what it comes down to.

1538
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:59,000
Questbuster in chat really puts this succinctly, saying,

1539
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:03,000
I love Odyssey, but the XP grind scaling is so trash.

1540
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:06,000
If it wasn't a problem, people wouldn't want to find ways around it.

1541
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:10,000
Yeah, it's nice to create a problem that you can then also create the solution for

1542
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
and then charge for that solution.

1543
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
Yep, that's how it works.

1544
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:18,000
So yeah, just don't do it or you'll get banned.

1545
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:24,000
And then of course, along with banning people for using the story creator,

1546
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:29,000
there have been people that have been getting banned in Rainbow Six Siege,

1547
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:38,000
because apparently people have been filling up game chat windows with random symbols,

1548
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:46,000
and this has caused lag and apparently causes people to disconnect with this kind of exploit.

1549
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:54,000
So you'll get banned for that now, and apparently they're deploying a fix for the chat symbol exploit.

1550
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
But yeah, their games are all broken.

1551
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:59,000
And don't do stuff that they don't like, otherwise they'll ban you.

1552
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:05,000
Yeah, that's right. Don't try to cheat their storefronts, or you're going to get banned.

1553
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
You be banned. You be banned!

1554
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Alright, moving on.

1555
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:14,000
We got news about a new Turok game,

1556
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:17,000
but it probably isn't the type of Turok game you're thinking about.

1557
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
You're probably thinking about the old school Turok games.

1558
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
N64 was the first one, right?

1559
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:22,000
Yeah.

1560
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
Yeah, this isn't quite the same thing.

1561
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:28,000
It's just kind of rooted in some of the same stories that inspired the older games.

1562
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:29,000
So here's the deal.

1563
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:32,000
It's a new game coming out on Steam on July 25th.

1564
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:37,000
It's called Turok Escape from Lost Valley, and it's a little more cartoony.

1565
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:41,000
It's also isometric 3D. It's not first person dinosaur hunting.

1566
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:47,000
It's still kind of the similar sort of concept where Turok and the brother Andar

1567
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:50,000
are in a valley full of dinosaurs, and you hunt the dinosaurs,

1568
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
and it just looks a little bit cuter.

1569
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:53,000
It's super cute.

1570
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:54,000
Yeah, it is super cute.

1571
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:57,000
Now, even though you might be like,

1572
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
they're making a new Turok game, I had no idea.

1573
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:02,000
This actually was a finalist in the Universal Game Dev Challenge

1574
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:05,000
that was during the 2018 Game Developers Conference.

1575
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:08,000
And they took these small teams of Unity developers,

1576
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:14,000
brought them together, and challenged them to make games about Universal-owned properties.

1577
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:17,000
So that's why Turok was there.

1578
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Thank goodness we got a Turok game and not a Minions game.

1579
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:21,000
Right.

1580
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:25,000
Well, it should be noted that the ultimate grand prize went to a strategy game

1581
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:31,000
called Voltron, Cubes of Volcarion, which is also coming to Steam on July 25th.

1582
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:32,000
So, how about that?

1583
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:33,000
Voltron game.

1584
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:34,000
Yeah.

1585
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:35,000
Cool.

1586
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:36,000
Yeah, pretty cool.

1587
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:39,000
Maybe if Turok isn't up your alley, maybe Voltron Cubes will be.

1588
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
I know Voltron was pretty cool.

1589
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
Anyway, some other just notes about this.

1590
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:49,000
The character design from this goes all the way back to the 1954 roots of Turok

1591
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:52,000
in Escape from Lost Valley in some of the earliest comics

1592
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:56,000
that were originally published by Western Publishing, Dell and Gold Key.

1593
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
So, that's pretty cool.

1594
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
Yeah, just a very different type of Turok game,

1595
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
but you have to remember Turok is a bigger property

1596
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:05,000
than what you might remember from the Nintendo 64.

1597
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:08,000
And then SGL 100 Matt is linking some articles in chat

1598
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:12,000
where you can actually see screenshots and so forth.

1599
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
Though I wish he'd use a better website.

1600
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:18,000
But you can look him up on YouTube and stuff too as well.

1601
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:19,000
All right, let's move on.

1602
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:20,000
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?

1603
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:24,000
You have another kind of like gaming science type of thing, right?

1604
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:27,000
Yes, because I love gaming and science.

1605
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:33,000
So, basically, there was another study that was published,

1606
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:37,000
and this was this time by the Creative Research Journal,

1607
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:40,000
in the Creativity Research Journal,

1608
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:44,000
where researchers analyzed 352 participants

1609
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:49,000
to compare the effects of playing Minecraft with or without instruction

1610
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:53,000
to watching a TV show or playing a race car video game.

1611
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:56,000
So, after 40 minutes of play or watching TV,

1612
02:03:56,000 --> 02:04:01,000
the participants were supposed to create different creativity tasks.

1613
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
To measure the production, they were asked to draw a creature

1614
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
from a world much different than Earth.

1615
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:08,000
More human-like creatures scored low for creativity,

1616
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:11,000
and those less human scored high.

1617
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:16,000
So, it was found that those who had full freedom to do Minecraft

1618
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:22,000
on their own, without instructions, they were the least creative.

1619
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:28,000
So, basically, let me start over.

1620
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:29,000
I take that back.

1621
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:30,000
They were the most creative.

1622
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:36,000
Well, those who were instructed how to play Minecraft were least creative.

1623
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:37,000
Oh, okay.

1624
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:38,000
Sorry.

1625
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:40,000
So, like if you were able to be more sandboxy,

1626
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
then that's going to lead to, okay, I get that.

1627
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
I get logically I understand why that would happen.

1628
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:45,000
Okay.

1629
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:49,000
So, basically, it's when you have like an open world,

1630
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:52,000
instruction-less sort of thing,

1631
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:56,000
is that it really does boost your own problem solving skills,

1632
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:59,000
as well as your ability to think around a certain thing.

1633
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
So, there you go.

1634
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
Let your kids play Minecraft.

1635
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Just don't let them download anything.

1636
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:05,000
Shit.

1637
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:06,000
I was going to say,

1638
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:09,000
if they were going to make different space aliens and things like that,

1639
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
I'm surprised you don't play something like No Man's Sky.

1640
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:15,000
You see all sorts of different types of what aliens would look like

1641
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:18,000
in that type of game that are not necessarily human.

1642
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:19,000
I mean, there's some humanoid creatures,

1643
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:23,000
but there's a lot of space flying things and all that.

1644
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:26,000
So, maybe No Man's Sky isn't really a kid's game.

1645
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:27,000
I don't know.

1646
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:32,000
Or maybe Spore, where there's lots of creatures that all look like dicks.

1647
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:33,000
That takes me back.

1648
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
Man, you know what?

1649
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:38,000
As much as people rag on the way Spore came out,

1650
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:43,000
Spore will always be the reason why I got to sit in the same room

1651
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
as Will Wright showing off his game.

1652
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:50,000
And when you talk about when you look back on 17 years of the show,

1653
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:53,000
and even though, okay, we're not the most famous podcast out there,

1654
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
we never had our viral moment,

1655
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:58,000
we don't make buku bucks doing this show.

1656
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:02,000
We did for a brief moment, and then everyone immediately forgot who we were.

1657
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
Well, I don't even think for the brief moment.

1658
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:05,000
It didn't really last long.

1659
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:09,000
But I will say that one of the things that this show has been able to bring me

1660
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:10,000
was that experience.

1661
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:13,000
I got to sit in the same room with Will Wright as he played his game,

1662
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:14,000
even if it was Spore.

1663
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:15,000
Whatever.

1664
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:18,000
I think Spore got shit on a little more than it needed.

1665
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:21,000
The problem with Spore is that it was just mini-games

1666
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
brought together in a weird sort of way.

1667
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:26,000
But I don't think it was as bad as people made it out to be either.

1668
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:30,000
It was really kind of like something I would think that would do well

1669
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
on cell phones now.

1670
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
Oh, God, I gave you ideas.

1671
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:36,000
Yeah, I wouldn't do that.

1672
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:37,000
All right.

1673
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:40,000
Moving on, a couple more stories before we open up Discord.

1674
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:41,000
So if you want to get in,

1675
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
if you have something you want to talk about tonight on Discord,

1676
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:47,000
you can make your way to the green room over at the VOG Network Discord server,

1677
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:51,000
which all the information is down below on our Twitch page,

1678
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:54,000
or you can just ask in chat if you're having any problems.

1679
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:58,000
But vognetwork.com slash Discord is the place to be.

1680
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:04,000
So apparently there's this new section in Steam called Steam Labs,

1681
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:08,000
which has a bunch of new experimental things that they're doing to Steam

1682
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
to kind of make it a little bit better.

1683
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:14,000
So one of the things that they're experimenting with is micro-trailers.

1684
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:17,000
So that's six-second trailers that are on every single game.

1685
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:23,000
They have an automated daily half-hour show about games

1686
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:26,000
and an interactive recommender.

1687
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:32,000
So one of these things, the automated or the interactive recommending thing,

1688
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:38,000
is like it's supposed to work off of the games that you play

1689
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:39,000
in your playing time history,

1690
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:43,000
and it's going to use that to recommend new games

1691
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:46,000
based on what other people have played as well.

1692
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:47,000
So that's kind of neat.

1693
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
Yeah, but the algorithm part of the Steam store is,

1694
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:53,000
I think, when the Steam store started losing all of its character,

1695
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:54,000
and it's just kind of so...

1696
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
The Steam store isn't great.

1697
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:57,000
Well, they have to...

1698
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
If I don't go in there knowing what I'm going to get...

1699
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:03,000
They're trying to make ways that they don't have to do the curation themselves,

1700
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:06,000
and fortunately that didn't work out well for YouTube,

1701
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:08,000
and it's not working out well for them either.

1702
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:09,000
Everybody forgets.

1703
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:12,000
Steam has a Twitch competitor built into it,

1704
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:13,000
but literally nobody...

1705
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
Well, I shouldn't say literally nobody's using it,

1706
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:18,000
but nobody I know is talking about it.

1707
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:22,000
Nobody I know is out there promoting their Steam streaming.

1708
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:25,000
It's all Twitch or YouTube,

1709
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:28,000
and shit, I see people promoting Mixer as well.

1710
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
So those are the ones I actually see promoted.

1711
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:34,000
I don't see anybody trying to build their Steam channel presence.

1712
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:37,000
I even think I saw a Facebook gamer the other day

1713
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
that was streaming on Facebook.

1714
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:40,000
I even saw that.

1715
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
I don't see Steam.

1716
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:43,000
Yeah.

1717
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
But the six-second trailers?

1718
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:48,000
That's a good idea.

1719
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:50,000
That's about the attention span people have for that.

1720
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:51,000
The micro...

1721
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:52,000
They're saying, though...

1722
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
The other thing that's kind of weird, though,

1723
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:58,000
is apparently that those mini...

1724
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:01,000
The 30...

1725
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
The little game shows,

1726
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:06,000
the daily half-hour shows about games,

1727
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:09,000
I guess a lot of it's in text-to-speech or whatever.

1728
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:13,000
I don't know. It's just weird.

1729
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
I'm just curious.

1730
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:18,000
I haven't actually signed into this to opt in,

1731
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,000
but I'm curious to see what it would recommend.

1732
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,000
It'd probably recommend that I start playing this

1733
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:24,000
in my fucking backlog is what it would recommend.

1734
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:27,000
I think you probably should stop buying games

1735
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:30,000
and start playing the 500 to 600 that you have.

1736
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,000
Do you even know what half of these are?

1737
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:35,000
Yeah. It should show you six-second trailers

1738
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:38,000
for games you already own but haven't funded yet.

1739
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:40,000
Already own but haven't fucking touched.

1740
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,000
That's what the Steam thing should do.

1741
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:43,000
It's like, listen...

1742
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:44,000
Look at what you're missing out on this week.

1743
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:45,000
They did have that event.

1744
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:46,000
They're all like,

1745
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
Dude, fucking go play your games that you have.

1746
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:51,000
I just haven't gotten around to it.

1747
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:52,000
Maybe I will.

1748
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:54,000
I thought about one time,

1749
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:58,000
I should just film myself playing a new game in my library

1750
02:09:58,000 --> 02:09:59,000
every single...

1751
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Well, maybe not every day,

1752
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:01,000
because that's a little much,

1753
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
but I probably could do every day.

1754
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:06,000
It'd take a few years to go through.

1755
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
All right, well, one more story for you guys tonight.

1756
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
And this is one of those things that,

1757
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:12,000
even though I think in some ways

1758
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:13,000
I felt it was just a matter of time,

1759
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:14,000
it's like one of those,

1760
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
like, wow, it's really gonna be happening.

1761
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:19,000
And that is that a new Netflix series is coming

1762
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
based on the video game Cuphead.

1763
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:22,000
Yay!

1764
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:23,000
That's right.

1765
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
The Cuphead show is going to be starring Cuphead

1766
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:28,000
and Mugman, or Player 2, if you will,

1767
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
and their adventures on Inkwell Isle.

1768
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
But we don't know much more.

1769
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
All we know is that in an interview with IGN,

1770
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:37,000
the game creators, Chad and Jared Moldenhauer,

1771
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
said it's not a little kids cartoon,

1772
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:43,000
and it will be the same kind of vibe that the game hints at.

1773
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:46,000
So maybe it'll be a little more like of an adult cartoon.

1774
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:47,000
But I also think those kind of,

1775
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
like, the cartoons that work best,

1776
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
why do so many people look back on things like Tiny Toons

1777
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
and Animaniacs and think that those,

1778
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
like, those are, like, some of the best?

1779
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:58,000
Because it was humor that, like, was suitable for kids,

1780
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:01,000
but, like, adults would find the deeper level humor in it,

1781
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:02,000
right?

1782
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
Hello, nurse, right?

1783
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:07,000
You know, there's things in it that adults would find even funnier.

1784
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:10,000
So, anyway, what's also interesting about this,

1785
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:13,000
it is being animated in-house by Netflix,

1786
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
but one of the producers on this, not just Netflix,

1787
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
King Features Syndicate.

1788
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:21,000
They're like the folks that hold, like, the licenses for Betty Boop,

1789
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
Popeye, like, classics.

1790
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:27,000
So this is, uh, it's so interesting how this has come full circle

1791
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:30,000
because Cuphead is arguably inspired by those type of cartoons in the past,

1792
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:33,000
and now we're getting an actual Cuphead show.

1793
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:38,000
And, um, also goes to show just how many frickin',

1794
02:11:38,000 --> 02:11:41,000
like, video games are becoming Netflix things.

1795
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
Like, we know The Witcher's on the way, right?

1796
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:46,000
We just had a story not that long ago about Final Fantasy XIV.

1797
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:50,000
Uh, The Division, if it's not a Netflix thing, it's a Hulu thing.

1798
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:51,000
It's one of those, right?

1799
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:52,000
No, The Vision's Netflix.

1800
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,000
The Vision, okay, The Division's a Netflix thing.

1801
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:55,000
I thought there was one that was Hulu.

1802
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
What about The Doom, The Doom, uh, Creation?

1803
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:58,000
No, that was a USA Network.

1804
02:11:58,000 --> 02:11:59,000
That wasn't a...

1805
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:00,000
Yeah, that's USA.

1806
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:01,000
...streaming service.

1807
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
But still, it's, it's kinda interesting just, like,

1808
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:04,000
how many video games are going over.

1809
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
But the other interesting thing about Netflix,

1810
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:09,000
Netflix is kind of in a position where they have to,

1811
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:11,000
to really start creating their own stuff.

1812
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:12,000
Why?

1813
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:15,000
Because everybody else is pulling their shit off the service

1814
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
and taking it to their own streaming platform.

1815
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:20,000
Hence why Netflix is gonna lose friends in the office

1816
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
in about another year and a half

1817
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
because Comcast NBC wants to do their own thing.

1818
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:27,000
Yeah, but I've only watched The Office,

1819
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
like, the entire series, like, five times.

1820
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
So I think I'm, I think I'm good.

1821
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
You think you got it all out of your system at this point.

1822
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:34,000
I think I'm good.

1823
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,000
And The Friends, like, two or three times.

1824
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:39,000
But you know, you know those are two of the most streamed shows on Netflix.

1825
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:43,000
I get it, but, like, are people really gonna pay extra money to, like, no.

1826
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:46,000
I, I think the bubble's gonna burst on some of that,

1827
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
and if those services don't think about consolidating,

1828
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
they're just gonna kill each other off.

1829
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:51,000
And I think it's gonna bring back piracy.

1830
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:52,000
It is.

1831
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:53,000
Honestly, yeah.

1832
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:56,000
I think that's already happening with Star Trek Discovery.

1833
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
People don't want to get CBS All Access for it,

1834
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
so they pirate it off international Netflix or whatever.

1835
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
So I think, I think it's already happening.

1836
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:03,000
VPNs.

1837
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:04,000
Yeah.

1838
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:05,000
Anyway.

1839
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:06,000
Yeah, YYR in chat says,

1840
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
Get ready for the dark ages of streaming.

1841
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:09,000
And Kaijuto says,

1842
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
Never watched Friends or The Office.

1843
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:12,000
And SSJ100Matt says,

1844
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:14,000
It all hinges on Disney Plus.

1845
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:15,000
Let's not kid ourselves.

1846
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
Disney Plus is going to do very, they're all,

1847
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:18,000
Yeah.

1848
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:21,000
just by putting the movies on a streaming service.

1849
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:24,000
It's, like, instant babysitter for children.

1850
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:27,000
Star Wars, Disney, and Marvel.

1851
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:28,000
Yeah.

1852
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,000
Disney Plus stands to do very well, and that's what probably,

1853
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:33,000
I just hope they have a package that bundles in Hulu,

1854
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:36,000
because, you know, since they're gonna be owning that as well,

1855
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:39,000
I'm, it would be nice to be able to have both services.

1856
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:40,000
Oh, my bad.

1857
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:41,000
DGRMS says,

1858
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:44,000
Friends isn't going to NBCU streaming service.

1859
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
It's going to HBO Max streaming.

1860
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:49,000
But I thought, I thought it was the other way around.

1861
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:52,000
Like, NBC's new streaming thing included HBO.

1862
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
But I guess maybe it is called HBO Max.

1863
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:55,000
I can't, see, this is the problem.

1864
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:59,000
Like, it's too many, you're spreading it across too many different platforms,

1865
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:02,000
and it's just, if it's not going to be easy,

1866
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
it's easier to go download it.

1867
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:05,000
Right.

1868
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:06,000
Right.

1869
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:07,000
Or just not watch it.

1870
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:08,000
Just like, you know what?

1871
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:09,000
I fucking watch Friends enough.

1872
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
Yeah, or if you really, like,

1873
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:14,000
I hate to suggest this, but as long as, like,

1874
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
the basic Netflix for whatever you're paying, like,

1875
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:17,000
$14 a month is still strong,

1876
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:20,000
they could probably get away with, like, what cable does,

1877
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
and say, if you want to add Friends in the office,

1878
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
you have to pay an extra $2 a month or something,

1879
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
or this suite of NBC shows.

1880
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:27,000
I don't know.

1881
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:28,000
But again, I don't,

1882
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
is that really any better than a separate streaming service?

1883
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:31,000
I don't know.

1884
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:34,000
But that's kind of what traditional cable does with HBO and Showtime

1885
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
and those types of things, right?

1886
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,000
So, anyway.

1887
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:39,000
Ah, okay.

1888
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:40,000
DGRMS says,

1889
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:43,000
Friends was produced by Warner Brothers.

1890
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
AT&T owns Warner Brothers.

1891
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:48,000
They're the one putting out the new HBO streaming service.

1892
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:49,000
Thank you.

1893
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:50,000
It's an AT&T thing.

1894
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:51,000
That I do remember reading.

1895
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:55,000
So, now AT&T wants to get in on this.

1896
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:56,000
Come on.

1897
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:57,000
Too many.

1898
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
Too many streaming services.

1899
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
All right.

1900
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
And Bobby Blackwell says,

1901
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:04,000
I just don't watch Discovery.

1902
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,000
If I'm not willing to get it legally, I just go without.

1903
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:09,000
I don't believe I'm entitled to TV shows.

1904
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
But it is interesting because, I mean,

1905
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:12,000
so many TV shows are over the air.

1906
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:15,000
I think many of us have kind of grew up with that entitlement

1907
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:16,000
in a weird way.

1908
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:17,000
I get what you're saying.

1909
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:18,000
Don't get me wrong.

1910
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
I just think it is interesting when we talk about specifically

1911
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:23,000
television because, you know, since we were kids,

1912
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
you could get a lot of that for free.

1913
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
But anyway, I digress.

1914
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
I'm just in the same boat where it's like,

1915
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:32,000
if I don't, I don't really pirate TV shows because I just,

1916
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:35,000
there's plenty that I can watch.

1917
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:38,000
And Netflix does still have a lot of good stuff.

1918
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:39,000
But the other services do too.

1919
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:42,000
If I had Hulu, I'd probably be watching The Handmaid's Tale.

1920
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:45,000
Even though apparently this new season is pissing everybody off.

1921
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:46,000
But that's all I know.

1922
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:47,000
I don't know what the details are.

1923
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:48,000
I flat out refuse to watch that.

1924
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:49,000
I've watched it.

1925
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:52,000
I've heard it's like too scary and not in a...

1926
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
I started reading the book and put it down.

1927
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
Yeah. So.

1928
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:59,000
I don't know if it's like too scary, but...

1929
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:03,000
It's not, not scary like, like thriller slasher scary,

1930
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:04,000
but too scary.

1931
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:07,000
Like this hits too close to home right now.

1932
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:10,000
Like I could see this happening and I don't like it.

1933
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
And yeah, I, I get that.

1934
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
So, all right.

1935
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:17,000
All right. Anyhow, we've digressed enough.

1936
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:20,000
I think it's time to get into the listener round table via chat,

1937
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:24,000
as well as our Discord server over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

1938
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:28,000
While we're waiting to see if anybody wants to call by joining our green room,

1939
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
we would welcome any last minute stories.

1940
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:33,000
While I wait to see if there's any of those,

1941
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:37,000
I would also open it up to our Twitch chat room over at twitch.tv slash vognetwork.

1942
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:41,000
If you have anything you wanted to ask us tonight to talk about

1943
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:42,000
or anything like that.

1944
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:46,000
So, meanwhile, do we have any last minute things that are coming in?

1945
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:48,000
Uh, no.

1946
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:49,000
Not really.

1947
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Unfortunately, one thing I was going to mention,

1948
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:55,000
because I have been reading a lot of different reviews for Astral Chain.

1949
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:58,000
I think, was it Astral Chain? No, it wasn't Astral Chain.

1950
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:03,000
It was the game that was supposed to be like Actraiser that Sega put out.

1951
02:17:03,000 --> 02:17:04,000
Oh, yeah.

1952
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:05,000
I hear it's not good.

1953
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:06,000
Oh, that's a bummer.

1954
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:07,000
Yeah.

1955
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:08,000
So, there it is.

1956
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:09,000
I didn't realize it was already out.

1957
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:10,000
Yeah, I think it already came out.

1958
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:11,000
Oh, shoot.

1959
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:16,000
But Blazing Chrome, the game that's like Contra, very good.

1960
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
But that is if you believe internet people.

1961
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:19,000
Yes.

1962
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:20,000
Okay.

1963
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:23,000
But I believe the internet videos that I've watched of Blazing Chrome,

1964
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:24,000
it's very good.

1965
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:28,000
It's very 16-bit Contra, and I need that in my life.

1966
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:31,000
Question for Metal Mayhem in our chat room for those in studios.

1967
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:36,000
Did you folks make use of the recent Steam summer sale?

1968
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:37,000
A big no.

1969
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:38,000
No.

1970
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:42,000
I know for me, honestly, just with, well, I've had a lot.

1971
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
Obviously, you guys know my mind's been going a million different directions

1972
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:45,000
when it's been coming to gaming.

1973
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:47,000
And I think just because when I am gaming,

1974
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:52,000
I'm so into Final Fantasy XIV and like Mario Maker 2 and the stuff I already have.

1975
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:55,000
I think I was really able to successfully put my foot down and be like,

1976
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:58,000
I don't need to buy any new games right now just for the sake of owning games.

1977
02:17:58,000 --> 02:17:59,000
I'm not going to play.

1978
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:04,000
Like, I think I finally was able to do that here in the year of our Lord 2019.

1979
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:07,000
Finally able to resist a Steam sale.

1980
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:11,000
I bought something, but I don't remember what it was that I bought.

1981
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:16,000
In fact, I'm going to check now because I remember paying for something,

1982
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:20,000
but I don't remember what it was that I paid for.

1983
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:23,000
You know what I think it was?

1984
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:26,000
It may have been Moshpit Simulator.

1985
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:29,000
It may have been Moshpit Simulator.

1986
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:32,000
I don't remember.

1987
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:33,000
Hmm.

1988
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:34,000
All right.

1989
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:35,000
I'm going to go to another question.

1990
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:36,000
If you think of it, great.

1991
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:40,000
As Joe and Hunter Matt says, since Twitch is an Amazon company,

1992
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
this is on people's minds today,

1993
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:46,000
what are you hoping to get gaming-wise or in general on Prime Day?

1994
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:50,000
Anybody going to be participating in the Prime Day shenanigans?

1995
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:51,000
Just for the pre-order.

1996
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:57,000
The TurboGrafx mini that was early spoken of I think is enough right there.

1997
02:18:57,000 --> 02:19:03,000
I do really want to get a 4K television, but...

1998
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:04,000
I did last year.

1999
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:07,000
I have other financial stuff going on right now.

2000
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:10,000
We just paid off a big dental thing,

2001
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:16,000
so I just feel like it's not a very adult idea to buy the 4K TV now,

2002
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:20,000
but maybe that will be a November, December holiday thing

2003
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:24,000
I treat myself and Alan to as a 4K TV.

2004
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:27,000
But yeah, I think otherwise...

2005
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:28,000
Because I just bought...

2006
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:32,000
That TV is not that old, but it's like the price of...

2007
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
When I bought that TV, it was almost...

2008
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:37,000
I feel like that TV was almost $1200 or something like that.

2009
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
I spent a lot of money on that TV.

2010
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:40,000
You can get 4K TV much cheaper.

2011
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:43,000
I know, now you can get 4K TVs that size for like $500.

2012
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:44,000
Crazy.

2013
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:47,000
So that's why I'm kind of like, well, I guess it's time...

2014
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
Which means that TV, if it even fit, would move in here.

2015
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
We'd have this giant fucking television in here.

2016
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
And it was Moshpit Simulator.

2017
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:54,000
Okay, thank you.

2018
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:55,000
We're all dying to know.

2019
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:59,000
Yes, and for those who are unaware of what Moshpit Simulator is,

2020
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:06,000
it is a physics simulator with a lot of these like really bouncy around naked dudes for some reason.

2021
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:07,000
But it's a VR game.

2022
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:08,000
It's really fucking weird.

2023
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:09,000
It's like...

2024
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:14,000
If you can imagine like a VR version of Garry's Mod, I guess,

2025
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:15,000
but with like a lot of...

2026
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:20,000
It's just fucking a weird game that I really need to play on the stream.

2027
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
Oh, Esther Jones under Matt says,

2028
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
I'm hoping to get a new PC gaming headset.

2029
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
You know what I should be looking for if I can find a good deal?

2030
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
A new mechanical keyboard.

2031
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:32,000
Because my current one, I spilled something on it like a dummy and now it's all fucked up.

2032
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
And then I keep looking at Alan's.

2033
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:35,000
Alan's keyboard is nicer than mine.

2034
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:36,000
I want a new mechanical keyboard.

2035
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:37,000
So maybe that...

2036
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:41,000
If I can find a really good deal on one of those, I might be talked into it.

2037
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:42,000
So we'll see.

2038
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:45,000
Anything else on Prime Day?

2039
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:46,000
Things you gotta have?

2040
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:47,000
I'll be curious.

2041
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:51,000
You know, Twitch is doing this whole thing for Prime Day.

2042
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:52,000
So I'll be very curious.

2043
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
I'll probably be watching some of that.

2044
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
They're really pushing people to co-stream it.

2045
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:59,000
Because of course, you know, they want people to know about the sales and stuff like that.

2046
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:03,000
Which I sadly don't have the time to be participating in that.

2047
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:07,000
But I'll be curious to see what other people are doing with it.

2048
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:10,000
And how everybody tries to make coin off of Prime Day.

2049
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
I'll be very curious about that.

2050
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:13,000
So.

2051
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:14,000
Dar2C in chat says,

2052
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:15,000
I feel you.

2053
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
I messed up my old wireless keyboard.

2054
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:19,000
Had to hit up Goodwill for a replacement.

2055
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:20,000
Yep.

2056
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:21,000
Djurama S says,

2057
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:23,000
Corsair is having some great sales on keyboards currently.

2058
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:25,000
I'll have to look into that.

2059
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:26,000
I really will.

2060
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:31,000
It just so happens that like everything I have right now is Razer.

2061
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:34,000
And it's not out of some brand loyalty or something like that.

2062
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:35,000
It's just a weird coincidence.

2063
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:36,000
But I'm open.

2064
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:39,000
A good keyboard is a good keyboard at the end of the day, right?

2065
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:40,000
So.

2066
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:41,000
Alright.

2067
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:42,000
Well.

2068
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:43,000
I guess that's it.

2069
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:45,000
Yeah, there's not really anything else.

2070
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,000
Yeah, it was kind of a slower news week.

2071
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:49,000
And I think we made the most of it though.

2072
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:50,000
So there you go.

2073
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:53,000
But we do invite you guys, of course, to always send us an email.

2074
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:57,000
If there's something we didn't talk about on the show tonight that you want to send us an email for, you can do that.

2075
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:58,000
Over at.

2076
02:21:58,000 --> 02:21:59,000
Oh, I was going to.

2077
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:03,000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send your email.

2078
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:04,000
Yes, your thought.

2079
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
I was going to ask you if you had played the.

2080
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
Because I haven't played it yet.

2081
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
The Dr. Mario game that they put out in mobile.

2082
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:11,000
Actually, yes, I did.

2083
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:12,000
Just a little bit.

2084
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:13,000
I haven't gotten past.

2085
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:15,000
I think the tutorial is like the first 20 levels or something like that.

2086
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:17,000
And I'm not even past that yet.

2087
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:18,000
But I did download it.

2088
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
And I'm tinkering with it.

2089
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:21,000
We'll say that.

2090
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:23,000
It's interesting because the pills go up, not down.

2091
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:24,000
I thought that was interesting.

2092
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:27,000
And it's not like it's not like the old Dr. Mario game.

2093
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:31,000
I mean, the match for concept or whatever is like the old Dr. Mario game.

2094
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:34,000
But it's it's different.

2095
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:38,000
And I can also see where it's probably going to get annoying with the money asking later on and all that stuff.

2096
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:39,000
All right. Yeah.

2097
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:43,000
Fifth dream today in our chat says the Dr. Mario game is trash.

2098
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:45,000
I haven't heard a lot of good things about it.

2099
02:22:45,000 --> 02:22:46,000
I thought it was pretty fun.

2100
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:47,000
It's got the music in it.

2101
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:49,000
Yeah, it was.

2102
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:50,000
I thought was fun.

2103
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:53,000
But it reminds me too much of that Sailor Moon game.

2104
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:56,000
That puzzle Sailor Moon game.

2105
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:57,000
Gotcha.

2106
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:58,000
All right.

2107
02:22:58,000 --> 02:22:59,000
And some mixed reviews.

2108
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:01,000
DJ Romas says it's pretty good for what it is.

2109
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:04,000
So Sailor Moon drops is what you're trying to think of.

2110
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
Also says DJ Romas.

2111
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:07,000
All right.

2112
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:11,000
Well, I think it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought and wrap up for the week.

2113
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:13,000
So let's go around and get some final thoughts.

2114
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:15,000
Dark Sakura, you want to start us off tonight?

2115
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:16,000
Which final thought?

2116
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:17,000
Oh, actually, sorry.

2117
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:19,000
Before you do that, I should, as I always do, plug.

2118
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:23,000
Thank you for listening to Orange Lawns Radio, be it on the podcast feed or live on Twitch.

2119
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:24,000
We really appreciate the support.

2120
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:27,000
And if you enjoyed what you heard here, please tell a friend about the show.

2121
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:30,000
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

2122
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:35,000
But if the voices aren't here live, you know, we get we have an empty Discord.

2123
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:37,000
So help us spread the word.

2124
02:23:37,000 --> 02:23:40,000
Also, auto hosts on Twitch goes so far.

2125
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:46,000
Even if you're not like a streamer yourself, your friends still might follow you and be curious about the stuff you're hosting.

2126
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:49,000
So auto hosts are the bomb dot com.

2127
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:50,000
And that's a new thing I'm really trying to push.

2128
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:53,000
So please consider VOG Network on your auto host list.

2129
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
OK, now Dark Sakura, your final thought.

2130
02:23:55,000 --> 02:24:03,000
I'm a little worried about this link that Brad gave us in chat for getting the TurboGrafx-16 mini on U.S. Amazon.

2131
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:07,000
Because it doesn't have anything on there, any alerts or anything.

2132
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:15,000
Whereas on Konami's website, if you go in to find the TurboGrafx mini, it links you to the Japanese Amazon page.

2133
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:20,000
Because it only has links to the U.K. and Italian pages. No links to the U.S. one.

2134
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:25,000
So I'm wondering if it might be because it's already after midnight there.

2135
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:26,000
Yeah, I think so.

2136
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:30,000
And the link hasn't gone live. But even so, it's linked over to the Japanese site.

2137
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:33,000
Only link. No matter which of those pages you're on.

2138
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:37,000
I'll just try manually looking for it like two minutes after nine o'clock.

2139
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:38,000
If they sell out.

2140
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:39,000
No, it says midnight Pacific.

2141
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:41,000
Oh, it's midnight Pacific. Oh, OK.

2142
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:42,000
So that's when Prime Day starts.

2143
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:48,000
If they're not up when I go there to load it in two minutes after the fact, then it just wasn't meant to be.

2144
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:51,000
And I will deal with that fact for the rest of my life.

2145
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,000
I don't think they're going to sell out.

2146
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:55,000
I don't think so either. TurboGrafx doesn't have that.

2147
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:59,000
To video game fans, like nerds, super nerds like us, yes.

2148
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:02,000
But I just don't think they're going to have that same wide appeal.

2149
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
That's what people said about other ones.

2150
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:05,000
I guess that's true. That's true.

2151
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:08,000
But I am going to. You know what? But here's the thing.

2152
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:13,000
I think it's more dark soccer. Like if I can't get one, I'm not going to upset myself over it.

2153
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:14,000
I'm not going to. If I get one.

2154
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:17,000
Yeah. Nice surprise.

2155
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:20,000
And also, you have a TurboGrafx. So, you know, I don't know.

2156
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:21,000
I'm talking to her.

2157
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:25,000
And well, and I'm also going to tell for why we are who is saying East Coast is screwed.

2158
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:31,000
I think that the Prime Day starts specifically, though, for your region, I want to say.

2159
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:37,000
So for you on the East Coast, it might be going live in 30 minutes.

2160
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:41,000
I would check it out. Well, then that would suck for us because then they all get to grab it first.

2161
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:45,000
But I'm going to sit and take a look. I'm going to wait until nine o'clock if you don't let me hang out.

2162
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:47,000
That's fine. Yeah. I'm still going to check, too. Yeah.

2163
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:51,000
So fine by me. If Alan gets back from the gym, maybe we can go.

2164
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:59,000
It's not. Oh, so on there is saying it's three o'clock Eastern is what S.H.A. 100 Matt is saying.

2165
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:02,000
Y.Y.R. in chat says Genesis mini preorders are still open.

2166
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:06,000
Yeah, but that's the genesis. And it was a crap machine.

2167
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:12,000
The mini was. Well, the new one, there's the new one that is doing not that because the old ones were done by a different company.

2168
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:16,000
We'll see. All right. But at any rate, I'm going to hang around and then I'm going to go home.

2169
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:20,000
That's fine. All right. So, Loki, your final thought tonight?

2170
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:25,000
My final thought was I need to play some laser tag. We should play some laser tag.

2171
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:30,000
I'd actually be down. I made the think of something. Maybe there's something we can.

2172
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:35,000
I know. I see. I thought about like, you know, getting a GoPro or something for that.

2173
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:42,000
But like what I really wanted to do was the state fair started this weekend and they had the Nintendo thing.

2174
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:48,000
But it's gone. Today was last day. Oh, they have. They're doing some weird like gaming thing this year.

2175
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:53,000
So like e-sports is like a big the state fair is really trying to cater to other stuff.

2176
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:57,000
I got to applaud. They're really thinking outside the box of the way people in because I got the thing that I want to go.

2177
02:26:57,000 --> 02:27:02,000
They have an entire like hall that's dedicated to selfie stations.

2178
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:06,000
So they have all these like awesome artwork that is intended for you to take selfies in front of.

2179
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:13,000
And I'm all about that kind of vanity. So I'm going to I want to go to the state fair to see the selfie stations.

2180
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:20,000
But if the gaming thing is out and about and around, I would definitely check that out, too, just because I like video games.

2181
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:23,000
Yeah. But yeah, that's the thing. That's the thing they're doing this year.

2182
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:33,000
All right. I guess that's just me. My final thought. My final thought is I may I don't know because it's being very last minute work.

2183
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:40,000
I may go out of town next week. So if there isn't they told me that I would fly on Monday if I go.

2184
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:48,000
But if something happens and there isn't a show next week, it's because I went out of town for work and day job comes first.

2185
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:55,000
That's that's that. So if push came to shove, though, I'm sure Loki would dance on DDR or dark soccer would do a full hour or something.

2186
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:59,000
So you never know. Maybe I'll finally get around to playing how to full boyfriend holiday star.

2187
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:04,000
No, you know what I would do? I'm going to play some fucking laser tag.

2188
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:09,000
That's right. You just say bye. I'm going to L.R. and then go play laser. I'm just going to play laser tag. Hell yeah.

2189
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:15,000
Hell yeah. All right. That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio. Thank you guys so much for listening to the show this week.

2190
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:21,000
We appreciate you guys very much. Have a great week gaming. I'll try to get some Mario maker levels for you all to play.

2191
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:23,000
So take care, guys. Good night.

2192
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:54,000
Of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio or Vogue Network, but you know, they were all still true.

2193
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:57,000
See you next week.

2194
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:29,000
The.
