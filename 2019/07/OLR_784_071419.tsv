14000	20000	This week teams plan to start bringing the Patsy into their Overwatch games. Someone who will cheat, stop the game they're losing, and spare their teammates the MMR loss.
20000	27000	The cat and mouse game continues. This is just one pessimistic view of tonight's news. The rest of the discussion and happier news starts right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	46000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back. It's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 784 for this July the 14th of 2019.
46000	52000	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me here in studio say hello to the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
52000	53000	Sup?
53000	56000	Sometimes on camera but sometimes not, it's her choice.
56000	60000	Sometimes I notice when part of my face is on camera and I lean back.
60000	63000	That's why I let you know where the boundary line is before we start.
63000	66000	Just show a little leg.
66000	71000	My mostly covered leg with my cat socks.
71000	75000	Twitch after dark tonight. I hope I didn't violate the TOS. Sorry I didn't mean to.
75000	79000	Showing a little leg. Is that violating TOS on Twitch? I don't know.
79000	80000	No.
80000	83000	Anyway, please don't bust us.
83000	89000	Anyway, also joining us here in studio. Well he's showing a little leg in those shorts actually but I think it's off screen.
89000	90000	Techmaster Loki.
90000	91000	No it's all on screen.
91000	95000	Uh oh. Showing it all for the world to see.
95000	98000	How scandalous. Showing knees on screen.
98000	100000	A scandalo. How are you Loki?
100000	101000	I'm fine.
101000	108000	So you got here to the studio a little late tonight. You were walking in during our little phone call with Bobby Blackwolf at the end there and I'm assuming it's dinner related.
108000	111000	That some incompetent person took too long to make your food right?
111000	117000	No I just left too late because I was making food at home and then I had to put away laundry before I left.
117000	122000	And then it just took too long so I ended up leaving like 20 minutes late.
122000	124000	Fucking chores ruin everything.
124000	132000	Well it's my own food. It's because tomorrow I start this thing at work. It's like a fitness health thing.
132000	139000	And so I had to make detox soup which is a fancy way of saying like it's got a bunch of vegetables in it.
139000	142000	Detoxing is bullshit. You have a liver.
142000	146000	I understand. I completely understand but it's just a vegetable soup is really what it is.
146000	151000	Okay so you're following up a vegetable soup with icycant that's like double bacon pizza.
151000	159000	It's Sunday. It's not Monday. Monday is when I start so I am going to be detoxing from an extra bacon pizza.
159000	164000	You are doing the classic I'm going on a diet tomorrow. Therefore I'm going to eat like absolute shit today.
164000	166000	Oh I give myself more to work on.
166000	168000	I just think you're doing the Lord's work.
168000	176000	It's just because I've got to weigh in tomorrow and the few pounds that are right about where I'm at now are really easy for me to lose.
176000	178000	So it's just stacking the deck.
178000	179000	Oh my God.
179000	181000	So you're building gas.
181000	187000	You're cheating the weight loss game. You're cheating at a weight loss competition at work. You're stacking the deck.
187000	188000	I can't believe you're acting.
188000	190000	That's what I do with the meditation challenge at work.
190000	191000	I'm acquiring mass.
191000	197000	I play the meditation app and then I go just leave it on in the corner while I'm playing a video game.
197000	198000	Wow.
198000	199000	I'm not meditating.
199000	204000	Am I the only one that takes these work challenges like can I actually do it. The last one we did at work was a step challenge.
204000	210000	Oh I'm going to I'm going to take it serious. I'm just like you know I'm eating the pizza today because this is the only meal I've had so.
210000	211000	Okay.
211000	217000	The one thing I will not do is the close the rings challenge because that's bullshit. I don't close the rings on purpose.
217000	222000	Every time I close my rings on my Apple Watch I get this thing from Rob.
222000	223000	Hey well done.
223000	225000	I'm like girl I just marched in pride.
225000	226000	Wait did I.
226000	228000	Oh yeah I know I do I do try to send those.
228000	229000	Well OK. So OK.
229000	234000	So those that aren't part of like the Apple Watch cult or whatever like you have these rings.
234000	238000	So you have one for if you stand 12 hours out of every day right.
238000	241000	You have another one for burning 500 calories in a day.
241000	243000	Well that's my goal. I think you can set it whatever you want.
243000	244000	Mine's at 500.
244000	251000	And then you have another one for and she's shown them on our twitch TV because we do tape live every Sunday night at the voice geeks network vog network dot com.
251000	254000	Middle one is my first one which I've done jack shit today.
254000	258000	The network dot com at six o'clock Pacific nine o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
258000	263000	So she's showing that off there on Twitch. But of course our audio only podcast is always free.
263000	270000	But so yeah the rings one is for standing one is for calories the other one is for actual exercise and then you die in seven days.
270000	276000	That one can be a little tricky because the watch has to kind of like detect that you're actually moving or like that your heart rate is up past a certain point.
276000	285000	I'm not sure what it's detecting. It's like I don't know why it didn't trigger though when I was actually at pride because it did it when I was trucking around all over the Fillmore.
285000	293000	Yeah there's plenty of days where like I will burn like 750 calories like I'll smash my red circle goal and I have zero minutes of exercise.
293000	306000	Yeah I'm like that every day. I put my my daily burn. I've done the calculation and I you know I put my daily limit for 550 although I'm about to bump it up to 600 because I've been easily surpassing that lately.
306000	316000	But it's like but like right today I'm almost at that goal and my my green ring for a workout is like nothing. So what else.
316000	332000	But anyway so if you're not in this Apple thing so you can follow friends on there and if a friend of yours actually closes all the rings you can like send a little message from your phone and generally they're pretty encouraging like hey you smash that goal or good for you or like applause emojis.
332000	347000	But I found and what Melody and I do is that we actually send one of the like 20 percent that will show up that are like these complete bitchy remarks that you can reply with like one of them says oh did you miss the bus today.
347000	357000	Like there's these really like mean things you can send. So Melanie and I have taken to sending those to each other when we smash goals and like sometimes I'll get a middle finger emoji back or something and it's fun.
358000	371000	See I don't use whatever is built into it because most of the time I'm replying from my phone. So I just make up my own snark. Yeah like girl I was just walking to the store and I'm in San Francisco it was uphill.
371000	383000	Now I know it's a video game podcast but I think this is still on topic because this is the gamification of you know goals like exercise which I think we've kind of seen for several years.
383000	390000	It's just you know Apple has their own way of doing it with the watch. We've certainly seen other ways of like gamifying you know weight loss and that type of stuff before.
390000	401000	Well there's like the RPG system from nerd fit where you level up based on your accomplishments because I used to do do that number.
401000	410000	I remember some like nerd RPG thing that they showed it like gamer excellent year or something and some of us kind of got on that right after that and I think that might be what you're talking about.
410000	426000	Yeah but I'll be perfectly honest that for me I'm not competitive so I only share like with two people and that's like you and one of my co-workers because I'm not competitive and I don't want my health to be regulated to a competition.
426000	443000	That's and that's fair. You know your body your choice. But for me to have it set a certain goals that like I'm leveling myself up. That's certainly much easier to me. It makes a lot more sense for me to do this for myself as my own single player not MMO.
443000	455000	You know you know how I am on an MMO anyway I just played by myself but excuse me I will say the gamification in some ways kind of works because like the the month and a half or so that I was going to the gym.
455000	464000	I was going to the gym very regularly and I was closing my circles every single day and that was right up until I left for Chicago and I actually lost I probably lost a good like 10 pounds in a month.
464000	471000	Now I would say I've gained a good chunk of it back because I kind of fell out of the habit after I won a vacation I came back and then I started doing other things.
471000	479000	I've been playing that other game I've talked about on previous episodes has been taking up a lot of my free time and like I have to rush home to do things because of time zones and stuff.
479000	485000	So I've really fallen off the gym bandwagon and that's kind of a bummer but you know gamification will hopefully help me get back on that.
485000	491000	And you know the anticipation of nasty messages for melody when I achieve my goals. It could be motivating a little bit.
491000	498000	Now going to our chat room of course to be. Yeah we do have of course our live chat room over twitch TV slash vogue network and we do tape live.
498000	508000	See it to bury is saying that Google Fit which you know would be obviously the other side of things not Apple but Google says it has its circles but its heart points and move minutes.
508000	513000	Yeah they got rid of their circles when they just you know they shut down Google Plus.
513000	518000	Well and I'm sure I'm sure Fitbit has their own thing like everybody has like something on that.
518000	525000	Fitbit just has like you can compare yourself with like other people like to see like where you're at with your goals during the day because I had a Fitbit before I had Apple Watch.
525000	533000	Yeah it says you fell out of the habit. Did you return the habit to the nunnery. Which of us here is the actual drag none. That would be this bitch.
533000	542000	I saw a shirt at Spencer's that totally made me think you know something about how many fucks do I have to give. And it's a nun flipping you off. It says none and you and I need.
542000	544000	Yeah you need to check that out anyway.
544000	552000	Pixel pakas in chat says the name of that RPG was habit RPG. I think it got renamed to habitica.
552000	556000	I don't know if I'm saying that right but it's probably gone through some evolutions there as well.
556000	565000	So anyway there you go gamification of our exercise and other things that we do in life. Heck counting calories in a way is gamification a little bit a little bit.
566000	579000	One of the things that I've actually left feedback for is that I would love for it to register my weightlifting because you don't always get your heart rate up as high when you do but it's a steadier heart rate.
579000	590000	And I would like for it to register what the heart rate is when you're lifting doing hard lifting as opposed to just cardio because there is more to exercise than cardio.
590000	601000	There is wanting to turn oneself into Linda Linda Hamilton from Terminator 2. I'm just saying which is a lofty goal. Yes. One of these days I'm going to have those guns or hell even the new Terminator movie.
601000	606000	Have you seen what she looks like in this new Terminator movie. Probably still just as awesome considering her age. She still looks great.
607000	618000	So I I wanted to I really that's like been ever since I saw Terminator 2. I'm like holy shit I want those arms and dance like those are very feminine arms. I'm like fuck you.
618000	631000	Those are womanly arms and they will punch you in the deck. They will punch a man in the liver punch your gender roles right out of here. They will punch a man in the kidneys until he pees blood.
632000	647000	Wow. OK. Those are goals. Those are goals. OK. Fuck the patriarchy. I will kick the patriarchy so hard. All right. But where were we. I'm sorry. You totally lost. You went off Linda Hamilton. Yeah I know there's something before that.
647000	659000	Oh well exercise. Yeah exercise. It's great. Yes. We should do it. Yes. At some point. I know. All right. When my other stuff settles down I guess going to have to be after Dragon Con at this point. So we'll see anyway.
659000	671000	All right. Let's get into some gaming news and stuff that's going on around the industry. This is the big story from this week and I know a lot of people are talking about this because Nintendo kind of surprised us with it.
672000	689000	This is totally unheard of. Although this is also one of those things where it's kind of been rumored for a little while and I know some of you don't ever stock in rumors but like some rumors are too loud to ignore and this is one of them is that the Nintendo switch was going to get a smaller version a light version.
689000	697000	It should be worth noting that many of the rumors have included that the switch will be getting a pro version as well. However nothing has been officially confirmed in that context.
697000	707000	But that rumor was supposed to be for next year. And those rumors kind of shifted to that that was being delayed about another year and that the only the light version would be happening.
707000	717000	And this week Nintendo themselves confirmed. Yes the Nintendo switch light. It's real. It's going to be coming September 20th and the price for this is two hundred dollars.
717000	730000	But the irony about it is a switch that does not switch. So it is a switch in name only which you know that is the console's name. The little joy. There's no detachable joy cons. Those do not pop off.
730000	738000	So if you have any games that require those such as I don't know one to switch I'm sure there's some other games you can't play them play those games with this console.
738000	750000	But I'm going to give you a very big reason to bring out a switch like this. Animal Crossing. Sure. People want to be able to take their villages on the go and they may not want to take a fully detachable.
750000	760000	I want one of these. I really do want one because it'd be easier to play you know the RPGs on the go without having you know leaving the system where say Dan can't play it.
760000	770000	And of course it's not like I paid anything for my switch. So I don't care. Well what they mean by switches switch from the 3 D.S. to this new thing because the 3 D.S. is dead now.
770000	779000	Well yeah there I think that is definitely like that was my first reaction to as I was kind of like finally they killed the 3 D.S. like that's that's done with.
779000	789000	And I get it. And before D.J. Ramos is in chat going boo. And I know he's not happy about this but look I'm not I'm not anti 3 D.S. by any means.
789000	800000	But I do think it is time for Nintendo to kind of put all their development stock in one place. And you know the switch is just the more technologically kind of advanced system at this point.
801000	810000	And I think I think it's probably for the best that they start to move away from the 3 D.S. and the 2 D.S. and that this is probably the nail in the coffin of 3 D.S.
810000	818000	Not to say third party developers in these home brews. And I don't think Nintendo plans to necessarily like pull the plug on 3 D.S. I don't think you're going to see it.
818000	829000	I don't think you're going to see that happen at 3 D.S. like it did with the Wii U like that they're now they'll just go sit but they're going to either going to ghost it a little bit and it's going to kind of run on fumes with the third party developers and stuff for a little while.
829000	836000	What if though they come out later with like a switch like this that has the 3 D screen support.
837000	854000	That would be pretty cool. I'd be into that. Although I don't know really worked hard on getting that 3 D in for well but years before the 3 D 3 is unpopular and even Nintendo started to walk away from 3 D because they had the 2 D.S. that came out you know a little ways into the the lifespan of the 3 D.S.
854000	860000	When a new Pokemon game was on the horizon and I was going to say it's funny you bring up Animal Crossing and I think that is very legit.
860000	868000	I think Animal Crossing is a great reason for a system like this. I think less people are actually pointing that out because the more obvious one is Pokemon.
868000	875000	Pokemon is going to be the game that comes out first and they're even doing a Pokemon themed like there's a sword and shield themed switch light.
875000	887000	I will say this even though personally I'm not interested in the switch lightless system I have a regular switch and as far as I'm concerned it's portable enough for what I need to do but I get I get it's a little bigger.
887000	893000	It needs its own case. I can't exactly put it in my pocket or in a little little tiny little bag or anything like that.
893000	896000	I can't put it in a pocket because women's pockets suck.
896000	900000	But you could put it in a purse or a small bag right. Those switch lights are pretty.
900000	903000	If only they had women that designed clothes.
903000	918000	Oh stop it. All right. Anyway where was I going to go. Oh yes. So even though I'm I personally don't plan on getting the switch light like I'm pretty impressed at all the different like colors and design like they're really they're nice looking systems.
918000	932000	I will say that like you know if I had waited to get a switch for whatever reason I might be enticed just because these things look better than my boring gray switch with the gray joy cons and the fact that it doesn't play one two switches even more of a plus.
933000	947000	Now Bobby Black Wolf in our chat points out a very good point here saying the only worry for me is that I hope developers don't abandon the features that aren't available on the switch light like HD rumble AR camera and so forth.
947000	958000	That's a very good concern because now if you develop a game that's going to use the HR rumble or even detachable joy cons or what have you you know that if somebody has a switch light they can't play your game.
958000	976000	Now I don't think there's a lot of games that rely on that anyway. But also Bobby I think an interesting sort of thing that may happen with that is that we know the switch light is the thing but we also know that Nintendo I mean we don't know but if rumors are to be believed how they ended up true in this case.
976000	991000	Nintendo is also working on a switch pro so they may develop something for this switch pro that does use those things because they want to push people towards that switch pro come holiday 2020 or whenever they plan on putting that thing out.
991000	997000	I mean I don't know I certainly just market segmentation is great. Let's do that some more.
997000	1012000	And then why we are kind of follows up Bobby's comment with because you design for the lowest common denominator if you want the greatest reach that is very true. I mean how many games ended up being new 3DS very few like very few 10 and 20.
1012000	1023000	I don't even think it was that many honestly unless you count like the Super Nintendo Virtual Console. But anyway, let's see. Also, another comment I thought was really good. Where was it pixel pocket said Oh yes.
1023000	1036000	Now this is in regards to the 3DS and its lifespan pistol pockets points out the Vita is still alive and getting games. The 3DS will still live as well just not likely with continued support from Nintendo.
1036000	1047000	I think that's a very good comparison to where I expect the 3DS to be. And in fact, I think the 3DS will be in a better place than the Vita is right now. I didn't Sony like finally like just kill support for the Vita officially stopped.
1048000	1069000	Make new systems. Yeah. Yeah. So I think Nintendo and 3DS fans still have a couple years before Nintendo is going to get to that point. But yeah, I mean, that's a good example is look at the Vita and maybe that will give you a little hope for those of you that are still, you know, excited about your 3DS and I, you know, I get that the 3DS has a distinct look to it with the top screen in the bottom screen.
1070000	1083000	I wish there was a way that they could make some of those games work on the switch if you tilted your switch vertically. I don't I don't know why this is completely outside the realm of possibility, especially when many games towards the end of life were very 2D only because 2DS is we're out there.
1083000	1105000	So, and many people are saying that the switch light is kind of like the 2DS of the switch or obscure. Yeah, the 2DS switch. I can see that. Yeah. And I can kind of see that too. I don't I don't think a lot of the like hardcore gamers will get this, but this is going to be a better system for kids or like teenagers. I could really see like the 1318 crowd. This would be a big thing.
1106000	1122000	Maybe. I just don't know. Like last few years, it seems like Nintendo will come out with a system with some gimmicks to it, really push that at launch and then completely abandon them, you know, as they go along, kind of like they did with the 3DS.
1122000	1145000	3D graphics are 3D without glasses. That was like amazing. And we don't use it anymore. Or, you know, with the Wii U, like I'm trying to think they were doing more stuff with that screen as like a second screen for some games. But then they kind of stopped doing that because people really didn't understand how to utilize that in certain ways,
1145000	1159000	which is a bummer because you can very much tell that Zelda Breath of the Wild before they reframed it for Switch and not saying that it turned out bad at all. But you can tell that that game would have been an impressive use of the second screen with the whole slate and everything.
1159000	1165000	You know, that it was it's very clear that was designed with the Wii U set up in mind. And after all, the game did come out on the Wii U.
1165000	1170000	But I don't think it really like it didn't really end up using the feature the same way that it was probably originally designed.
1170000	1177000	Yeah. So it's just it's kind of just a bummer that the Wii U didn't really find its rhythm until it was too late. And the third party's lack of support.
1177000	1183000	Even like the stuff for like one to switch, like, oh, we're changing the way that you play games and stuff. And they do that a little bit with like Labo.
1183000	1191000	But like I you know, I praise Labo a little bit after I purchased a couple of them.
1191000	1196000	But I'm kind of taking that back because it's exactly what I thought it would be.
1196000	1202000	It's something that I buy, I build it, and then I have all this crap that's sitting there that I never use.
1202000	1207000	And it takes up a ton of space. I have been successful in that regard with Labo.
1207000	1210000	I was very tempted by the VR one, though, I got to say.
1210000	1216000	But it's once I heard that like the Zelda and the Mario stuff kind of ended up being like I was.
1216000	1220000	Yeah, it's just OK with my decision. Yeah, it's just not worth it.
1220000	1230000	It's it's it's a neat it's a neat prototype for something, but it's not like something that I would want to play on a regular basis.
1230000	1236000	And like occasionally we'll we'll bring out the robot thing, but it's such a pain in the ass to get it working.
1236000	1240000	And then just like even the VR stuff, it's just all over the place.
1240000	1247000	I managed to shove some of it in like a drawer, but like it's still all over the goddamn place because it's so big.
1247000	1253000	And they have like there is a section in that Labo where it's like, here's how you can store your stuff a little bit better.
1253000	1259000	But it doesn't make it that much smaller because I did all that stuff and it's like, OK, this is really huge.
1259000	1264000	I don't know. Maybe with just like that gun one, the thirty dollar one you can get with the goggles and the gun.
1264000	1269000	Those are pretty much the more fun of the little mini games out there.
1269000	1272000	So I don't know. Maybe stick with that one.
1272000	1279000	Some other little specs we should mention about the Switch Lite. The Nintendo Switch Lite battery power is supposed to last between three to seven hours.
1279000	1284000	That is about 30 minutes longer than the regular Switch. But I don't think that's whoopity shit.
1284000	1290000	I mean, it's a smaller screen. Right. So whatever. It is a portable only system, which I think we've stressed enough here.
1290000	1296000	The screen is five point five inches as opposed to six point two inches in the original.
1296000	1302000	So you're losing about three quarters of an inch there if size is is big for you.
1302000	1307000	And then the resolution, they say, is still 720p, just like the predecessor.
1307000	1313000	But they are saying because it's a smaller screen, it's going to look a little better because, you know, it's a smaller screen.
1313000	1318000	So whatever. And yeah, then you can get into some other specs as well.
1318000	1321000	Like the D pad is going to be a little different. I say the D pad does look kind of nice, though.
1321000	1323000	Look, I like the D pad better than like the little button thing.
1323000	1332000	I fully anticipate someone taking that system and turning it into like a DS type clamshell thing, modding the crap out to make it even smaller.
1332000	1337000	Yeah. But anyway, it's very obvious that this is timed for Pokemon.
1337000	1344000	And that's very intentional is that there are going to be, despite all the controversy around the national decks and all that stuff.
1344000	1353000	Like, I think the reality is, you know, kids and the biggest population of Pokemon players out there, maybe not the most vocal,
1353000	1358000	but the biggest population of Pokemon players out there are going to turn a blind eye to the national decks thing.
1358000	1362000	I think they even have a special Pokemon edition that's coming up.
1362000	1368000	And I think most people, even if they are upset about the national decks thing, I kind of think they're going to still get it anyway.
1368000	1371000	I don't think that's really going to stop people from buying the new Pokemon game.
1371000	1377000	I mean, maybe in a few extreme circumstances, but I just think that game is still going to be selling.
1377000	1388000	And again, this is a great way for if you have a kid or even a parent or somebody that's just been waiting for that game that they got to get the system for, then this is it.
1388000	1393000	But one more thing I want to add here before we move on about the whole death of the 3DS.
1394000	1402000	To be honest, you know, again, as frustrating as that is, you kind of should have seen it coming when they moved the Pokemon games to the Switch.
1402000	1408000	That should have been your first indicator that the 3DS was, you know, tick tock, tick tock, right?
1408000	1411000	So, but it's had, I mean, 3DS has an amazing run.
1411000	1417000	I mean, honestly, probably best portable system ever that I can think of off the top of my head.
1417000	1424000	I mean, you know, some could argue about some of the more like retro consoles and, you know, especially at the original Game Boy and what Tetris did for that and everything.
1424000	1433000	But I think just the long life of the 3DS, the vast library of what most 3DS's can play between the regular 3DS games, the DS games.
1433000	1437000	Can they play the advanced games? No, the original DS before they went to play.
1437000	1438000	They can on the virtual console.
1438000	1439000	Oh yeah, they can on the virtual console.
1439000	1444000	So there's still, you know, there's just such a rich library and things that, you know, I think the 3DS will definitely be.
1444000	1459000	I know, it's so amazing that a tiny little system like the 3DS can handle Super Nintendo games and yet this new console, the brand new console, like the Switch Lite, cannot fucking handle Super Nintendo games.
1459000	1467000	Because that's why I assume it's not there yet and not because of some other greedy shit that they're doing to try to get people to pay for their online service or anything like that.
1467000	1469000	I'm sure that's why.
1469000	1476000	Now, you know, and depending, I'm looking at some of the comments in chat, DJ Rama S saying, I'll wait for my Switch Pro.
1476000	1480000	And, you know, certainly depending on what kind of gamer you are, like I get that.
1480000	1485000	Like, you know, if you kind of know that there's a Switch Pro on the horizon, then, you know, maybe you're kind of waiting for that.
1485000	1492000	So, because I admit it is going to be a little bit frustrating to know that I'm probably going to end up buying that Switch Pro when I already dropped the money on the Switch.
1492000	1495000	But I mean, I guess I've gotten a few good years out of the Switch at this point.
1495000	1498000	Switch has been out for a good year and a half at this point now, right?
1498000	1502000	A Raspberry Pi Zero, which is a $19 system, can play Super Nintendo games.
1502000	1503000	Let it go.
1503000	1504000	Let it go.
1504000	1506000	And yet.
1506000	1511000	Let's see, S2100Matt says, I'm also looking to upgrade to the Pro when those specs come out.
1511000	1520000	Going back to the National Dex issue, Sia Tabiri says, one YouTuber I follow actually called for his followers to skip Sword and Shield over the whole National Dex thing.
1520000	1524000	And for the fact that the Dynamax thing is just a limited gimmick or whatever.
1524000	1530000	I make that guy show his bank account record because I bet he buys it anyway.
1530000	1531000	Like, sorry, not sorry.
1531000	1535000	Again, I'm not really trying to take sides on that whole thing.
1535000	1537000	I understand why people are mad about it.
1537000	1543000	Don't get me wrong, but I really feel like when it comes to push or shove or whatever, people are still going to buy the game.
1543000	1544000	You know what I mean?
1544000	1550000	I think we all know the inevitable conclusion to this is that in a future Pokémon game, this will be remedied.
1550000	1553000	So, it is what it is.
1554000	1558000	Let's see, YYR says, I wouldn't expect much from a Switch Pro.
1558000	1562000	I mean, I wouldn't expect it to enhance existing games a la Xbox One.
1562000	1566000	I would expect it to improve new games that were designed for it, like New 3DS.
1566000	1572000	I just hope, unlike New 3DS, they don't start to split the market because I think that will be very bad.
1572000	1574000	Now, we just said there weren't a lot of games for New 3DS.
1574000	1577000	So, specifically for New 3DS, what?
1577000	1581000	There was the Final Fantasy game and maybe like one or two others, right?
1581000	1584000	Not the Final Fantasy game, the Xenoblade game and like one or two others.
1584000	1589000	I think the Hyrule Warriors played better on the New 3DS.
1589000	1590000	Yeah, I think it was that.
1590000	1594000	And then Smash Brothers was definitely better, but it still played on the old 3DS.
1594000	1596000	I'm sure we can look it up.
1596000	1598000	It was a really small number of games.
1598000	1602000	Also, just like the very small number of games that were on the...
1602000	1609000	Actually, it was the 3DS where it used the second analog stick.
1609000	1617000	Remember how on the older 3DSs it didn't have the second nub that they have on there?
1617000	1625000	They had that solution that you would buy this giant thing that would attach to your 3DS to give you the second analog stick and stuff like that.
1625000	1628000	There were only a handful of games that used that, too.
1628000	1632000	So, before we move to the next topic, let's quickly poll everybody in here.
1632000	1634000	Are you going to get a Switch Lite, yes or no?
1634000	1636000	So, I think I'm hearing you're a yes, right, Jamie?
1636000	1637000	I want to.
1637000	1638000	You want to?
1638000	1640000	Just for Animal Crossing and such? Makes sense?
1640000	1642000	Yeah, so I can have that on the go.
1642000	1648000	I don't know if it'll happen because I do have a Switch that I didn't pay for, but we'll see.
1648000	1654000	I'm going to say no, but it's one of those, not for me, but I think it's cool it exists and I think they're really good looking,
1654000	1658000	but I can't really justify it for me when I have the regular Switch already.
1658000	1659000	Loki?
1659000	1663000	Probably not because I already have a Switch and most of my games are digital
1663000	1667000	and Nintendo's not good about swapping that stuff around between systems.
1667000	1673000	Plus, all of my saves are on one system, so say if we wanted to get some for the kids so that I can actually use my Switch.
1673000	1677000	I was going to say, I'm surprised that the boys getting older isn't kind of way in yet, but maybe they're not quite there yet.
1677000	1685000	No, they just got two DSs last year, so they don't need, they have a Switch, they don't play it very often anyways.
1685000	1695000	Well, actually, no, I take it back. They were playing, they were playing some, no, my son was playing Animal Crossing on 3DS earlier this week.
1695000	1703000	He was in my wife's town digging a bunch of holes. He dug so many holes in that town.
1703000	1709000	And then he got stuck on an island and he didn't know how to get off the island.
1709000	1715000	When the new one comes out, you're going to need to teach him how to visit Dark Sakura's town.
1715000	1716000	Dig all the holes.
1716000	1717000	Not invited.
1718000	1724000	I imagine, and I seem to remember the last one that was online, you couldn't do that type of stuff if you were visiting other towns.
1724000	1727000	They put blocks in there so that you couldn't screw up someone else's town that bad.
1727000	1731000	Yeah, well I'll definitely get it, but I don't know. We'll see.
1731000	1737000	Alright, well let's move on. Let's talk about, we know what Loki's kids have been playing, but how about the hosts?
1737000	1740000	And how about you guys in our chat room at twitch.tv slash vog network?
1740000	1744000	How was your gaming week, Dark Sakura? What kind of games have you been playing this week?
1744000	1748000	I really buckled down with a lot of my pins lately, just playing some pinball.
1748000	1755000	I'm also, I'm trying to get myself actually back into Twilight Zone because I'm really out of practice with it.
1755000	1760000	But I've also been playing Animal Crossing Pocket Camp. I've been playing Idle Poring.
1760000	1765000	I've been playing Pokemon Go. I've been playing the Harry Potter stupid game.
1765000	1775000	I don't know, just not a whole lot. Dan and I are still talking about what, if eventually we're going to start streaming together with.
1775000	1785000	And it's sort of leaning toward the Super Famicom Sega Densetsu 3 with one of the translated ROMs I have. So we'll see.
1785000	1788000	Alright, moving on to Loki. How was your gaming week?
1789000	1798000	It was pretty good. I played a little bit of Shakedown Miami. Hawaii. Shakedown Hawaii. I keep confusing that with Hotline Miami.
1798000	1799000	Hotline Miami, yeah.
1799000	1806000	Yes, Shakedown Hawaii. And I played a little bit of that because they have the new update that came out, so I was checking that out.
1806000	1815000	And then, what else? Mainly just a little bit of Pokemon Go and I worked on my game a little bit.
1815000	1826000	I was building a thing for the camera. A camera controller type thing. And then, what else? Yeah, that's about it.
1826000	1832000	I just realized there's a typo in the little what's coming up next thing on Twitch.
1832000	1839000	Because for those that haven't seen the Twitch feed, you're only listening on the podcast, we have a little like you might see on CNN or something a little ticker like what's coming up next.
1839000	1844000	I just realized it says, how was you gaming week? Left an R off, my bad.
1844000	1846000	How was you gaming week?
1846000	1856000	How was you? How was you this week? Sorry about that. Sorry if your grammar is shaking right now, my bad.
1856000	1857000	I'm trying not to pay attention to it.
1857000	1861000	My bad. It was an innocent mistake. I know how it's really said. Alright, anyway.
1861000	1863000	Just be glad I didn't notice it.
1863000	1867000	You should just do it all in Comic Sans week.
1867000	1868000	No.
1868000	1874000	Here's what I have to say about that. If you don't like it, you are welcome to do it for future weeks.
1874000	1879000	But when I get stuck doing it, then you got to love me and my mistakes.
1879000	1884000	I do want to like make some stuff and I just haven't gotten a chance to.
1884000	1889000	There's a lot of people in chat that are like, I noticed. I noticed. And there's others that were like, I was just being polite.
1889000	1894000	I also want to get a giant neon sign to go right here, but I don't know if it'll show up on camera.
1894000	1898000	Yeah, the light will do funky things to that. I don't know.
1898000	1902000	So anyway, the Spyro Jonathan says, I literally just died laughing. I only just noticed.
1902000	1908000	Yeah, obviously I just noticed too, but I usually sit here and read what's on the TV, but that one jumped out at me. Anyway.
1908000	1912000	Alright, so my gaming week. How was my gaming week?
1912000	1916000	So I'm still doing the Survivor LARP. That is still going.
1916000	1920000	And I believe it or not, you guys, I'm still in it. Can you believe it?
1920000	1923000	You're in it to win it. They haven't voted you off yet.
1923000	1928000	They have not voted me off yet. And we're down. It started with 22 people.
1928000	1933000	And I think the girl that left last night was 16th. So we've got 15 people.
1933000	1939000	I think if I did my math, we either have 16 people left now. No, we have 15 people left now. I can't even math.
1939000	1944000	So seven people have left. And the point is, I haven't been one of them.
1944000	1948000	So small victories, I guess, in that regard. But the people have been really great.
1948000	1953000	I got to say, like just the various people I've been meeting from all over has been really cool.
1953000	1958000	And that's like that's the whole reason to play this stuff. Otherwise, they can't talk much more about it because, you know,
1958000	1962000	strategic and all that stuff because the other tribe might know that I do this thing.
1962000	1967000	I don't know. So I can't talk a lot about like what's really going on. But, you know, well,
1967000	1972000	I will talk all about it once it's done. I would actually love to have some of the other people that were that were in it,
1972000	1976000	like come on the show and like talk about it because I think it would be really funny. I don't know.
1976000	1981000	I think it's these these highly immersive games are really frickin interesting to me.
1981000	1992000	Anyway, but in the video game world, I have been still able. Luckily, the the it's not like as much time playing that as I was like the first week it was going on.
1992000	1998000	So I have been able to play some other video games. Most of my time, admittedly, has been on Final Fantasy 14 Shadowbringers,
1998000	2006000	just because it's an MMO and there's a lot to explore. And I've got easily sunk in in the dozens of hours already.
2006000	2012000	And I'm not even like halfway through. But the story is really good and I'm having a really good time with it.
2012000	2018000	And I don't know if you guys know this, but if you go, you know, I don't know if you guys put a lot of stock in things like Metacritic and what have you,
2018000	2023000	and the things that like kind of assess what all the ratings across the Internet are saying.
2023000	2030000	But Final Fantasy Shadowbringers right now is one of the best reviewed games of the year, if you can believe it, which you don't always see for an MMO.
2030000	2039000	So that's kind of interesting. But I think it also speaks to just like how like good the story is and the graphics and the character design and the sound and all that.
2039000	2045000	So it's it's turning a lot of heads. And now people are getting interested in Final Fantasy 14, who may have not like noticed before.
2045000	2049000	You know, especially when it comes to the monthly fee, which I know still puts a lot of people off.
2049000	2050000	I think people are really into it.
2050000	2051000	Yep. That's why I don't play it.
2051000	2058000	One thing, though, and let me make this clear. I love 14 in its current state. I think it's a fantastic game.
2058000	2069000	I do have to point out something, though, I think is a little troubling because I think something is being misrepresented by the media and it's very important by gaming media.
2069000	2078000	And I think it's very important about this game, because one thing that I think got a lot of people interested in this expansion was if you do these endgame dungeons,
2078000	2086000	you don't have to do them yourself. You have a party of like trust people that you can bring with you and you do these dungeons with your trust parties.
2086000	2092000	And that is all still true. That part, like, is not different. And that is really changing the game for some people.
2092000	2099000	Here's the problem, though. People are reporting on that and everybody's going, yay, I don't really have to play with other people.
2099000	2106000	I can do these dungeons on my own. And while that is true, what they're not saying is that there are still primal battles.
2106000	2115000	The eight people fights that are a part of the story. For instance, there is one, it's not a spoiler to say because they've talked about that this primal is in the game.
2115000	2124000	Titania, who's been in Final Fantasy lore before, is the first big primal fight that you do at around level 74, about four levels in, maybe 73.
2124000	2130000	73 or 74, four levels in. You can't do that fight with trust. You have to do it with other players.
2130000	2137000	And where I've got to say, yikes, a little bit on the expansion, everybody getting excited, it's not an easy fight.
2137000	2141000	It took us several tries to get through that fight with, like, people I know and all that.
2141000	2153000	Now, will they do things later on to lessen the blow of that? Yes, they will introduce the echo thing where the more you die on it, the more powerful you get so that it helps you to clear it, but it's not in there right now.
2153000	2162000	Although they are doing a mini patch on Monday, so I wouldn't be surprised if they're like, I'm saying this now and by the time a lot of you hear it, some of this is already going to be addressed.
2162000	2170000	The difficulty of that fight is that they're going to put in the echo and they're going to probably reduce some of the health of the ads and things like that.
2170000	2180000	But I think it's an important thing to point out because I would not want people to buy this thinking, oh, I don't have to worry about the anxiety or the pressure that comes with playing with other people
2180000	2188000	or getting called bad by other people and all this stuff. And I understand, those are all legit concerns. You don't want to feel responsible for wasting other people's time in a dungeon, I get that.
2188000	2200000	So I think it's fair to warn people, whereas yes, Final Fantasy is moving in that direction of being a multiplayer experience, but one that you can still do yourself.
2200000	2207000	You cannot get through the entire story without other people as is being represented right now in a lot of the reviews.
2207000	2214000	A lot of the reviews I don't think played to the Titania fight to find out, oh, whoops, you do have to play some of this with other people.
2214000	2221000	So I wanted to call that out. I bet that's something that the developers will address later on at some point, I think.
2221000	2232000	So anyway, Fifth Dream in chat says, even when I had the people in the Friendly Guild who helped me, I still felt that anxiety of not doing well, so I kind of stopped playing.
2232000	2239000	And some people in chat are saying, shit, I didn't know that. I wanted to do the main story quest alone. Boo, I would have re-subbed.
2239000	2245000	Yeah, and I'm sorry because I think Final Fantasy XIV is a great game and I do want to share it with a lot of people, but I think you have a right to know.
2245000	2255000	You will not get through the story without playing with other people. It's only a couple of times, very short, but I have to say it.
2255000	2264000	It is not accurately being represented in some of the early previews and stuff like that that are focusing on the trust thing, which is great, and it's a huge step forward of getting there.
2264000	2271000	It's the typical gamer media mentality where it's like, oh, they only played it for a little bit.
2271000	2279000	Or one person reported on that element of it, so everybody reported their whole story on just that element without considering the bigger picture.
2279000	2286000	But I also don't want to shit on Shadowbringers either because it's a fucking fantastic expansion.
2286000	2292000	And I'm like, if you're going to play any MMO, you need to play Final Fantasy XIV. It is the creme de la creme right now. It's amazing.
2292000	2295000	I'm not talking shit on WoW by any means.
2295000	2299000	I just wish I had time for it. That's the issue.
2299000	2310000	If I had that much time, like say, someday when I'm retired and don't have to work and have all this time for gaming and stuff, then yes, an MMO would be right for me.
2310000	2317000	But right now, I have hardly enough time for the games I have in my library, let alone time for an MMO.
2317000	2321000	But I will say this much, one more thing I want to say about Final Fantasy, then I'll move on to the games.
2322000	2328000	I'm only halfway through the story, so I can't really comment on this expansion story as a whole.
2328000	2334000	But I'm hearing it gets even better in the final half and that apparently some big shit goes down and stuff.
2334000	2339000	And most of my friends that have played through it are like, this is the best that it gets.
2339000	2344000	This may very well be the best Final Fantasy story that has ever been told.
2344000	2357000	And especially if you look at the critic scores and everything else out there, this is a distinct reality that we may be living in a time and a place where the best Final Fantasy story is in their MMO.
2357000	2366000	So, kind of interesting. But I've said on prior shows, I kind of think Heaven's Word and Stormblood also had fantastic stories that most people missed out on.
2366000	2370000	So I hope, I don't know what they can do to help more people experience this story.
2370000	2380000	I think the trust system is kind of getting there. I think they took a big step with this expansion, and I expect that will be refined in some of the later patches.
2380000	2386000	So maybe in six more months, people will be able to experience it more in single player.
2386000	2392000	And I know it's so interesting, isn't it? It's a massively multiplayer game, but people want to play it single player.
2392000	2403000	But I kind of get it. Sometimes other people are fucking mean, but you want to be able to say hi to your friends, and go visit your friends' houses, and see your friends' outfits, and things like that.
2403000	2407000	But you still kind of want to do your own thing. I kind of get it. I do.
2408000	2417000	All right. Bobby in chat says, I wanted to experience this great single player story. I soloed the story for Star Wars The Old Republic.
2417000	2426000	And what little I did play of that game was pretty fun as well. So that's one of those games I need to go back to one of these days.
2426000	2429000	That's back in BioWare's heyday, I suppose.
2429000	2433000	So, anyway, other games I played this week, because there are a couple others.
2433000	2441000	I also played, oh no, I forget the name of it, the racing game they were giving away for free on PlayStation Plus this month.
2441000	2447000	The Hyper Turbo, so I played that for a little bit. It's a fun little arcade racer.
2447000	2456000	My only little thing with it is that with the polygons and the way the graphics look, it kind of looks like a PlayStation 2 game that was kind of up rezzed for PlayStation 4.
2456000	2461000	But I think it's super indie. And it is fun to play. At the end of the day, it's fun to play.
2461000	2466000	But the graphics are a little basic for a racing game, in my opinion.
2466000	2472000	But it's fast and it's fun to control and so forth. So, yeah, there's that.
2472000	2477000	Thank you, Darktits2. I knew somebody would know it. Horizon Chase Turbo, that's the name of it. Thank you, thank you.
2477000	2483000	Bobby Blackwolf says the graphics are basic. Yeah, I mean, I've played a lot of racing games that are amazing graphics.
2483000	2492000	Like Forza, hello. Gran Turismo, F-Zero, hell. But the ones in this game are kind of, it looks like I'm playing Outrun.
2492000	2497000	And Outrun's not a bad game. It's just a dated game at this point. Anyway.
2497000	2501000	So that's about it for my gaming week. I think that's everything I'll mention.
2501000	2509000	So we'll move on. A quick housekeeping note. We are live on Twitch tonight, of course, as we are every Sunday night.
2509000	2517000	And Twitch has a little special promotion going on right now because Twitch belongs to Amazon and Amazon's got their big Prime Day coming up, right?
2517000	2524000	So right now, and it's only tonight during Sunday's show, if you are kind enough to donate biddies to the show,
2524000	2533000	which we use your biddies to get things like new mics, the flyers that Bobby was just able to hand out at this weekend's Southern Fried Game Room Expo,
2533000	2543000	or excuse me, Gaming Expo. I always get the names of these up. The flyers that were handed out were designed by Dark Sakura and were paid for by your biddie donations and subscription stuff.
2543000	2549000	So thank you very much. So thank you, thank you, thank you for everybody that helps that happen because that helps us get the word out for not just our own shows,
2549000	2554000	but the other great shows on this network. Girls Gone Wow, you've probably seen, is also streaming Sunday during the day.
2554000	2558000	That's been great. Anime Jam Session, of course, on Tuesday. And more and more and more.
2558000	2566000	So anyway, you do need to specifically use the bleed purple emote, or excuse me, yeah, emote during your bit donation.
2566000	2577000	But Twitch will do an extra 10% tonight only. So if you donate 100 biddies, you'll actually be donating 110 because Twitch will add 10% to the pot.
2577000	2586000	But you have to use that bleed purple emote. I believe right now, if you click on the bits icon, it will show more detail on that right now.
2586000	2587000	Please do it.
2587000	2588000	Because I said so.
2588000	2593000	Well, I don't want to beg for money, but I will say that it's appreciated.
2593000	2594000	We're not begging.
2594000	2595000	And it goes to good use.
2595000	2596000	We're just telling you all what to do.
2596000	2598000	Yeah. And of course,
2598000	2599000	Do the thing.
2599000	2607000	If you are a Prime person, you get a free monthly subscription because you're paying for it with Prime that you can use on one Twitch channel every month.
2607000	2613000	And if you decide to use it here at the Voice Geeks Network or VOG Network, you get access to the complete video archive.
2614000	2619000	So you can access all the old shows on video and watch them that way if you desire.
2619000	2624000	But of course, the audio, as it has been for 17 years, will still be free.
2624000	2626000	That's not something we're going to be charging for.
2626000	2629000	So we want you to still be able to enjoy what you've always enjoyed.
2629000	2634000	We wanted to add something new for the paywall or whatever you want to say.
2634000	2635000	Not take anything away.
2635000	2636000	Very important.
2636000	2637000	Anyway.
2637000	2640000	S2100Matt says, give them money for pizza or cookies or other important things.
2640000	2643000	I think it's safe to say we have not spent your money on food.
2643000	2645000	It definitely goes back into the show.
2645000	2649000	And yeah, hopefully some exciting stuff coming up at Dragon Con, too.
2649000	2655000	We'll have to kind of look at the finances, but we might be able to have another thing that we give away in person.
2655000	2658000	I know in years past we had the little hacky sacks.
2658000	2660000	The lanyards were a big thing last year.
2660000	2662000	So maybe we'll have something new for this year.
2662000	2666000	I don't want to promise, but it's not outside the realm of possibility.
2666000	2667000	It's going to be a fun year.
2667000	2669000	All right.
2669000	2675000	Anyway, YYR in chat says, I totally do it, but would it look like I'm paying for advertising?
2675000	2678000	You guys do endorse my games quite a bit.
2678000	2683000	I don't think so because we already endorse them without any agreement of any sort.
2683000	2685000	You know, you were looking for or fancy.
2685000	2687000	You were looking for content for the break.
2687000	2692000	And I did manage to catch one of YYR's.
2692000	2693000	Excuse me.
2693000	2694000	Like all that pizza.
2694000	2698000	Anyways, I did catch one of his retrospectives that he did.
2698000	2701000	See, these are things that you should tell me before we're live.
2701000	2703000	Because now I can't just throw it in there.
2703000	2706000	But yeah, that would have been a great retrospective.
2706000	2709000	Because he did one for Bungee Ferret tossing.
2709000	2710000	Oh, that would have been fun.
2710000	2714000	Well, when the new one comes out, because he's talked about the one on PC,
2714000	2718000	I will do a little thing of that and put it during the break.
2718000	2720000	And he doesn't have to give us a dime.
2720000	2726000	We would do that just because we love the fact that somebody actually made a game out of a silly idea on this show.
2726000	2732000	For the record, I'm also going to say, since people brought up food earlier, I did bring cookies that I baked myself.
2732000	2736000	And they are rose chocolate and craisin cookies.
2736000	2741000	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, I'm sorry, not Bobby Black Wolf.
2741000	2744000	Other people in chat are saying, we need Smush to do something special.
2744000	2746000	We need a Smush emote.
2746000	2749000	Bobby says the Smush emote is for the Discord.
2750000	2754000	The thing is, we would have to get in.
2754000	2757000	So Smush doesn't photograph well because he's a black cat.
2757000	2760000	So we would have to commission the artwork to be done.
2760000	2763000	Which I'm willing to do and have that done.
2763000	2765000	Oh, you're going to draw Mr. Smush?
2765000	2768000	I could try. It's been a while. I've got enough references.
2768000	2770000	I just sent you a picture of his sleepy ass.
2770000	2777000	Well, even if you decide you don't want to do it, I'm sure we could commission somebody to do it for $20 or even $40.
2777000	2779000	To do a small little emote of Mr. Smush.
2779000	2782000	And maybe that's something we could put for a higher tier sub.
2782000	2785000	Or when we unlock more sub slots.
2785000	2788000	We may have one right now. I don't remember.
2788000	2790000	But that might be something. I don't want to promise anything yet.
2790000	2795000	Because we have to reach an agreement with Bobby Black Wolf on any of those types of decisions.
2795000	2800000	But I think if you guys really want it, I'm sure we can make it happen.
2800000	2802000	Alright. Anyway.
2803000	2805000	And thank you SHJ100Matt who says,
2805000	2807000	You've given me and plenty of us years of entertainment.
2807000	2809000	The few bits we throw is the least we can do.
2809000	2811000	Super appreciate that.
2811000	2814000	I wish you could still get the bits from watching ads.
2814000	2815000	You can.
2815000	2817000	Oh, you can on desktop too?
2817000	2819000	Yeah, except I have an ad blocker.
2819000	2822000	But it says I can watch one for $5.
2822000	2824000	Oh good. I'm glad those are back.
2824000	2828000	Watching just a handful of ads and then throwing those bits this way.
2828000	2830000	Or whoever.
2830000	2833000	If you don't feel like you want to give us biddies.
2833000	2835000	I'm not going to be upset.
2835000	2840000	Go support some other streamer that does this out of the goodness of their heart and so forth.
2840000	2842000	Watch a few ads.
2842000	2844000	A little bit goes a long way and it adds up. Trust me.
2844000	2847000	Even if you're only donating like 10 biddies to somebody.
2847000	2849000	It's still just that, oh, Senpai noticed me.
2849000	2852000	It's just a nice thing to be noticed by your viewers.
2852000	2855000	Okay, and then I think the mobile will let you watch ads too.
2855000	2856000	That's always been there.
2856000	2858000	Alright, anyway. Enough of that.
2858000	2861000	Enough self-promotion about Twitch promotions.
2861000	2863000	Let's get into some other gaming news.
2863000	2866000	Let's make some more of those moments you guys like to be here for.
2866000	2869000	With one that maybe we'll start a Loki rant.
2869000	2872000	Let's see, Loki. It's a Nintendo story and it's one that kind of...
2872000	2874000	I don't know. I don't know, Loki.
2874000	2878000	It's a feature that they've made so good for them.
2878000	2883000	So if you're looking for more excitement in your Nintendo online collection.
2883000	2890000	Well, you can at least be able to play now with rewind features that they have in NES games.
2890000	2895000	So for example, if you hold these ZL and ZR buttons.
2895000	2899000	You're able to scroll back in a timeline of snapshots of your gameplay.
2899000	2902000	And pick anywhere you want to resume from.
2902000	2904000	So that's kind of cool.
2904000	2910000	And apparently that's going to be added to the Switch online NES app starting July 17th.
2910000	2913000	Which is the same day they're going to be adding some new games.
2913000	2919000	Donkey Kong 3 and Wrecking Crew.
2919000	2921000	Yeah, Wrecking Crew is the other.
2921000	2924000	No, Rob the Robot though, so that kind of sucks.
2924000	2926000	Wrecking Crew wasn't a Rob the Robot game.
2926000	2927000	I thought it was.
2927000	2930000	No, Gyro My Ex and Stackem were the Rob the Robot games.
2930000	2932000	You're right, I'm thinking...
2932000	2934000	Wrecking Crew had a level editor.
2934000	2936000	It did have a level editor.
2936000	2939000	And it was referenced later on in Smash Brothers.
2939000	2941000	I think a lot of people know the Wrecking Crew level in Smash Brothers.
2941000	2944000	It kind of plays like the old Wrecking Crew game actually.
2944000	2947000	Wrecking Crew is a nice historical choice, I guess.
2947000	2950000	But I kind of think it's one of those games you play once and you're like,
2950000	2952000	Alright, I played it. That's it.
2952000	2954000	You don't really play it a lot.
2954000	2956000	Donkey Kong 3.
2956000	2961000	I think that game is neat because it's so different.
2961000	2963000	It's weird.
2963000	2969000	Suddenly you play this character that doesn't exist anywhere else in Nintendo's timeline.
2969000	2973000	You play that little peat, the pesticide or whatever.
2973000	2977000	And Donkey Kong 3 is more like a shooter than it is a platformer.
2977000	2979000	That's what made it so weird, right?
2979000	2982000	Because you're shooting the bug spray up Donkey Kong's ass.
2982000	2984000	That's what you're doing. Look at the game.
2984000	2987000	To scare him out of the greenhouse or whatever.
2987000	2990000	So it's just weird because that game is more like a shooter.
2990000	2994000	And so it kind of got lost amongst Nintendo's history.
2994000	2997000	But the reality is, when it comes to these NES releases,
2997000	2999000	if that's what we're getting this month, I'm sorry,
2999000	3001000	but they're starting to scrape the bottom of the barrel.
3001000	3005000	Which is weird because they have a huge library of games out there.
3005000	3009000	I don't understand why we can't just throw some money.
3009000	3011000	I don't even know.
3011000	3014000	I really wish they just sold these games online
3014000	3017000	because then we'd have more of a library to choose from.
3017000	3020000	You can have like, you get these free,
3020000	3023000	but if you want additional games, you can purchase them.
3023000	3024000	And they go into that.
3024000	3027000	In a way, like I think what's happened now
3027000	3031000	is that you have these publishers that are re-releasing their NES things
3031000	3032000	as part of these collections.
3032000	3035000	Like look at what Konami's doing, the Castlevania collection.
3035000	3038000	Because they're forced to do that because they don't have any other options.
3038000	3042000	That's why when there was these Capcom collections way back
3042000	3046000	on the PlayStation stuff, they didn't have that on the Nintendo Wii,
3046000	3049000	I think at that point, because they had Virtual Console stuff.
3049000	3052000	So it didn't make any sense to release that on there
3052000	3054000	because you could just purchase them separately.
3054000	3056000	OrangeRite in chat says,
3056000	3059000	How many first-party games are still holding out, though?
3059000	3061000	And I think that's an excellent call-out. Not a lot.
3061000	3066000	There's not a lot of first-party games that aren't on this service at this point.
3066000	3069000	It's the third-party games where they...
3069000	3073000	Well, they have some really bottom-of-the-barrel stuff like Pinball.
3073000	3076000	Yeah, but we would be reading them just as hard
3076000	3078000	if those were the types of things that they were releasing at this point.
3078000	3079000	You know what I mean?
3079000	3084000	I think a lot of us more than recognize it's time for Super Nintendo.
3084000	3086000	It's time for more.
3086000	3088000	I don't understand why we can't get third-party stuff in there
3088000	3090000	because we have some Konami games, I think, in there.
3090000	3091000	We do.
3091000	3093000	So, I mean...
3093000	3096000	Something is clearly stopping them because we haven't had...
3096000	3100000	I saw a list of some stuff that they were wishing they would have on the service.
3100000	3104000	And one of them that was mentioned was Maniac Mansion, which would be amazing.
3104000	3108000	Well, you know, I would fucking flip if they could get the Guardian Legend.
3108000	3112000	But the problem is the rights to the Guardian Legend are so muddled at this point
3112000	3115000	as well as some of these other old-school 8-bit games.
3115000	3119000	I'm not surprised that they're just kind of not there.
3119000	3120000	Yeah.
3120000	3123000	But I think it is definitely time to start thinking about other systems,
3123000	3124000	namely the Super Nintendo.
3124000	3127000	And if they can swing it, why not Genesis?
3127000	3130000	I mean, I guess Sega's got their own thing going on with their mini system,
3130000	3133000	but at some point, why not include, like, the Nintendo Wii had?
3133000	3137000	Some limited arcade stuff, although then you got arcade archives
3137000	3139000	is also screwing that whole thing up, right?
3139000	3140000	Like, why would...
3140000	3141000	It's just not planned out very well.
3141000	3143000	Yeah, I don't think they plan it out very well.
3143000	3144000	I really don't.
3144000	3148000	I think Nintendo is going to be cornered that they're going to have to do Super Nintendo.
3148000	3150000	They really don't have any other choice.
3150000	3152000	So I think that's coming.
3152000	3159000	If it doesn't come by holiday, I think then we have to get really concerned.
3159000	3162000	I think we're going to have a couple more rough months,
3162000	3166000	and then, like, Super Nintendo is going to probably have to happen.
3166000	3168000	But we'll see. I don't know.
3169000	3173000	As far as the rewind and fast-forward thing, I mean, cool, I guess.
3173000	3177000	Like, you know, especially in maybe some of the more difficult games,
3177000	3182000	like ghosts and goblins and some of the ones that, you know, are really easy to die over and over in.
3182000	3183000	Or really...
3183000	3184000	It would be nice to have that too.
3184000	3186000	Mario 3, you go to the Toad house and you're like,
3186000	3188000	ah, I didn't get what I wanted.
3188000	3190000	Back it up. Oh, do it again.
3190000	3191000	You sure could. You sure could.
3191000	3193000	So, how's that going to work if you're playing online?
3193000	3195000	Maybe that's disabled if you play online with somebody else.
3195000	3196000	Probably.
3196000	3199000	Yeah. And I think maybe that's another place where this has felt very disappointing
3199000	3202000	is that even though, you know, they have this whole, like, online setup
3202000	3204000	where you can play with other people,
3204000	3208000	it doesn't feel like there's a lot of games that are worth playing online with other people.
3208000	3212000	Like, it's still a lot of, like, single-player heavy experiences.
3212000	3214000	And look, Donkey Kong 3.
3214000	3216000	It's not one you can really play online.
3216000	3217000	Wrecking Crew.
3217000	3220000	I don't even remember if that's a two-player simultaneous game.
3220000	3224000	If it is, it's not going to be fun for long.
3224000	3228000	So, God, I feel like if they could just open up Super Nintendo,
3228000	3230000	we could get some more stuff that, you know,
3230000	3233000	especially when you get into things like Super Mario Kart, the original and things,
3233000	3234000	it would be a lot of fun to play online.
3234000	3235000	Yeah.
3235000	3237000	We'll see. We'll see.
3237000	3241000	Anyway, YYR in chat says,
3241000	3243000	If you're going to rewind the Toad House,
3243000	3245000	I wonder if you have to do it before you enter.
3245000	3247000	No.
3247000	3248000	Well, it depends which house.
3248000	3251000	Like, if you're going to do the flip card, you might have to do it before you enter.
3251000	3253000	But I think you're thinking the slot machine, right?
3253000	3256000	Oh, yeah. I mean, I don't think it necessarily matters
3256000	3258000	because you look at...
3258000	3261000	You can see in the screenshots where you're at.
3261000	3264000	You can back it up. I think it's every few seconds.
3264000	3270000	So, you probably could do it in a way where you can manipulate that.
3270000	3271000	I'm sure they don't care.
3271000	3272000	All right.
3272000	3274000	Game Genie. Support the Game Genie.
3274000	3276000	That would be kind of... Nintendo always hated that thing, though.
3276000	3281000	I don't fucking care what they like or don't like.
3281000	3284000	Moving on. I know what I like, and that is AR games
3284000	3287000	because, you know, I love to play some Ingress
3287000	3290000	as well as Harry Potter, Wizards Unite, Pokemon Go.
3290000	3292000	I was like, you know, there was a big Entei thing tonight,
3292000	3294000	and I couldn't even do it because of the show.
3294000	3297000	And Community Day is next week during the show.
3297000	3300000	I was right by one of those armored Mewtwos,
3300000	3302000	and I looked at it, and I'm like, man, that looks dumb.
3302000	3305000	I'm getting really...
3305000	3309000	It's just making me not want to play anymore.
3309000	3312000	I'm missing out on so much stuff that I'm just kind of like,
3312000	3316000	I can just let this go for a while until maybe they introduce Gen 5 or something.
3316000	3319000	I got to admit, I'm kind of into the Harry Potter, Wizards Unite
3319000	3324000	because Allen got into it, and he was kind of fizzling out on Pokemon Go as well.
3324000	3328000	But playing Wizards Unite gives us something both to do.
3328000	3333000	And what's nice about Wizards Unite is that you don't have to wait for raids to spawn.
3333000	3337000	You go find a fortress, and you can do it at the same time with your friend
3337000	3341000	and play whenever you want. You don't have to wait for something to spawn.
3341000	3344000	So the way they did that, I think the battling in Wizards Unite
3344000	3346000	is way more interesting than it is in Pokemon Go.
3346000	3349000	That's where that game really starts to shine.
3349000	3354000	So anyway, we were doing five player fortresses the other day with some of my Ingress buddies.
3354000	3357000	It was a lot of fun. You just have to constantly communicate.
3357000	3360000	I'm strong to the level 27. I'm going to take the 27.
3360000	3362000	Can somebody put a shield on me? Can somebody heal?
3362000	3365000	Drop a potion. You're constantly communicating while you're fighting on your phone
3365000	3367000	and drawing all the traces. It's pretty awesome.
3367000	3372000	So anyway, I can't wait for Dragon Con to be able to play some...
3372000	3376000	Bobby, find out if there's a fortress down at Dragon Con.
3376000	3378000	There's got to be. Of course, there's a fortress down there somewhere.
3378000	3382000	Anyway, but since I love AR games, I'm going to have to give this one a shot too.
3382000	3385000	This isn't Niantic, but I still think it's going to be really neat.
3385000	3390000	It's Minecraft Earth. Minecraft Earth is soon to be on the way.
3390000	3396000	It will be launching on iOS in the next two weeks, apparently, a beta release.
3396000	3401000	So it's coming soon. The Android version will follow soon thereafter.
3401000	3404000	And it's not totally uncommon that it hits one platform before the other.
3404000	3406000	I think that did happen with Pokemon Go.
3406000	3409000	Ingress was Android only for a year before it was out on iOS.
3409000	3411000	Of course, Ingress was also a Google game.
3411000	3417000	But anyway, I digress. So it will be out on iOS first, but it's not going to be a long wait.
3417000	3420000	And they also showed a new trailer for Minecraft Earth.
3420000	3424000	So it's interesting because you have that overworld view that looks very Minecraft-like,
3424000	3426000	that has pets and things you can tap on.
3426000	3429000	But then it looks like there's another button you can do that will turn...
3429000	3434000	And it shows these guys building a snow cavern on top of a picnic table.
3434000	3437000	And it looked really cool. And I'm like, if that is...
3437000	3444000	What I also thought was fascinating about it was that the guy's other phone was showing a little pickaxe.
3444000	3446000	It was showing the item that he was using.
3446000	3451000	And I'm like, that has to be enhanced for a trailer. It can't look that good.
3451000	3453000	Didn't you watch the developer's conference?
3453000	3455000	I didn't watch the whole thing, but...
3455000	3463000	They announced the Minecraft Earth at the developer's conference in Cupertino.
3463000	3468000	Not in Cupertino, but when they did the... talking about the AR stuff,
3468000	3473000	they did the whole demo of building, of standing in your building and everything.
3473000	3477000	Wow. If that really is what it ends up looking like, I'm going to be blown away.
3477000	3480000	I'm really excited to try this out.
3480000	3483000	I just feel like it's one of those things where in theory it's awesome,
3483000	3485000	and then in practice it's kind of derpy.
3485000	3487000	So we'll see how it works.
3487000	3490000	But I know I signed up for that beta because I want to check this out.
3490000	3491000	I'm sure you did too.
3491000	3495000	And I'm sure now that it's on Dark Soccer's mind, she might think about signing up too.
3495000	3497000	But yeah, I'm excited to try it out.
3497000	3500000	And if you haven't seen the trailer yet, it's definitely worth looking at.
3500000	3506000	I... you know, for as much as I've always kind of been complaining,
3506000	3511000	if Microsoft bought Minecraft, why have they yet to put out a Minecraft 2?
3511000	3516000	Where's Minecraft 2? Why is that not a logical progression of what happens to Minecraft?
3516000	3521000	But now that I'm looking at this, I'm like, oh, maybe this is the logical progression of Minecraft.
3521000	3528000	This is why we don't have the ultra 4K HDR texture pack.
3528000	3534000	And SHG100Matt says, a Microsoft product coming to an Apple product first, the times that we live in.
3534000	3540000	Well, hey, you remember when Apple took on the Microsoft Office suite?
3540000	3544000	And that was like, what a jaw dropping moment that was when Apple agreed to do that.
3544000	3547000	And it kind of changed both companies for the better.
3547000	3553000	So, you know, you ally with the enemy when it makes good business sense.
3553000	3555000	What had everybody talking just three weeks ago?
3555000	3559000	Sony and Microsoft teaming up on the cloud technology thing.
3559000	3564000	Does that mean The Last of Us 2 is going to be on Xbox? No.
3564000	3566000	Halo is going to be on PS5? No.
3566000	3571000	It just means that, you know, when it mutually benefits companies to work together, they're going to do it.
3571000	3573000	So, yeah, it's kind of just fascinating.
3573000	3580000	But I get it. I get it. It's very much like when you first played a Sonic game on a Nintendo console.
3580000	3583000	It's very that. It is very that.
3583000	3586000	Yes. Oh, I like the way Questbuster puts that.
3586000	3590000	The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
3590000	3593000	And who's the person to be in the AR space right now?
3593000	3596000	Niantic or maybe Google, if you will.
3596000	3598000	I mean, because Niantic was a spin off of Google.
3598000	3603000	It's really the one to beat is definitely Garfield Go.
3603000	3607000	How's that? Well, some some of these other, you know, not I'm using my quoting finger,
3607000	3611000	knockoff games have done fairly well for themselves, like the Jurassic Park game.
3611000	3615000	I think it's OK. Like, I think it's got a fan base.
3615000	3618000	They ran out of dinosaurs, so they had the spin off into other animals.
3618000	3622000	And then The Walking Dead had one, too.
3622000	3627000	Yeah, I think has you know, I don't think it's as big as Pokemon Go yet, but it's got it's got its fans, you know, and they kind of do their thing.
3627000	3632000	So anyway, I am excited about Minecraft Earth.
3632000	3635000	Please don't let me down. That's all I have to say.
3635000	3639000	I also see the potential to get extremely let down. All right. Moving on.
3639000	3643000	Dark Sakura, I like this. You got kind of a different sort of topic for us tonight.
3643000	3646000	I've been trying to make that a theme lately, at least find something that shows the other side of gaming.
3646000	3651000	Well, especially in these slower news months, there's other things about gaming we can talk about, you know.
3651000	3660000	Well, there was a study that was published in the journal Dreaming that said that games that promote more activities,
3660000	3666000	certain basically certain types of games will lead you into being a more lucid dreamer.
3666000	3671000	So basically, if you play an active role in your game, like a virtual, you know,
3671000	3677000	like something they specifically mentioned, Connect and on the Wii,
3677000	3683000	that those games that require activity to play them, I guess do something with your brain,
3683000	3686000	but it makes you a little bit more of a lucid dreamer.
3686000	3691000	And what lucid dreaming is, is basically it gives you the ability to dream and know you're dreaming
3691000	3699000	and to control your dreams in more, you know, in-depth, like the better of a lucid dreamer you are,
3699000	3702000	the better you can control it. For the most part, I'm a lucid dreamer.
3702000	3707000	I've always been since I was a kid, but it's come in handy.
3707000	3716000	If one has, you know, nightmares, they try to teach lucid dreaming techniques to like PTSD sufferers,
3716000	3720000	you know, because nightmares kind of go hand in hand with PTSD.
3721000	3730000	But they were finding this is just preliminary evidence that physically interactive games are more likely associated with lucid dreaming,
3730000	3738000	but they're going to need more research. So they're actually starting to, you know, branch out with that study.
3738000	3746000	It was a cross-sectional study, so it does not show any direct cause and effect, but they've had that correlation lined up.
3746000	3750000	So we'll see. Hopefully they'll pursue a lot more with it.
3750000	3758000	And they're saying basically the study shouldn't be taken as prescriptive, but that basis does show a direct correlation,
3758000	3760000	and it can be used in therapy.
3760000	3765000	I gotta be honest, it's kind of a foreign concept to me because I am the opposite.
3765000	3771000	I don't remember my dreams, and I haven't really tried to like look into this or thought much about it,
3771000	3776000	but I think there is like a segment of the population that just doesn't like they don't they don't dream.
3776000	3778000	It depends. Yeah.
3778000	3782000	Yeah. I mean, like I just just I mean, I'm not going to say like never ever,
3782000	3788000	because I do know that like there will be once in a great while, like I distinctly remember I must have been falling or something in a dream
3788000	3792000	because I remember waking up going like I just like hit the ground and that's like when I woke up.
3792000	3799000	But like that type of experience is like once every year, once every six months. It is not common.
3799000	3804000	It is by far more common for me to wake up and that's that's it.
3804000	3809000	Usually, usually by the time I figure out that I would be lucid dreaming is about the time that I lose it.
3809000	3815000	It's it's like usually have control for about like a few seconds or at least it feels like a few seconds.
3815000	3820000	And it's it's too late. It's like it's like, oh, yeah, I'm dreaming up and I'm up.
3820000	3828000	I've always been able to control it. Like it's only when I'm really like in a really bad mental state
3828000	3832000	that it's like I know I'm dreaming and don't give a shit. I just want to see where it goes.
3832000	3837000	And it's more like I don't have the will to control it, although I still know I'm dreaming.
3837000	3842000	But I don't think I'd want that. Like for me, like I just I don't know if I'd want that.
3842000	3846000	I, I don't know my perceptions and your perceptions just based on.
3846000	3852000	I honestly don't know if it has something to do with being autistic as well, because our neurochemistry is different.
3852000	3855000	But I also feel well, OK. Yeah. Maybe when you get into lucid dreaming, maybe.
3855000	3859000	I mean, I don't know. But like, I feel like more people remember their dreams and talk about dreams.
3859000	3863000	There's dream journals and things like that than people like me who have nothing to talk about.
3863000	3872000	Like also for me, I dream in color. And it's actually I believe I mean, it's almost 50 50.
3872000	3876000	But there's a good portion of society that dreams in black and white. And I dream in color.
3876000	3882000	I've heard that. Let me read you the last statement on this. And this comes from the authors of the study.
3883000	3895000	We believe immersion in realistic, controllable virtual environments such as video games is a powerful psychological state that warrants a lot more study, particularly in its overlaps of the characteristics of dream states.
3895000	3905000	And so basically, yeah, they're considering using this study to lead into more study to learn how to do dream therapy.
3905000	3910000	So pretty cool. Video games lead to that. Yeah. Kind of neat.
3910000	3917000	So if you want to be more in control of your dreams, you got to play more Beat Saber or DDR or something.
3917000	3923000	Although it's some, you know, YYR is in our chat room saying my DDR days haven't ended, but I haven't noticed anything.
3923000	3928000	And I don't think this is like they say, it's not prescriptive. So it's still something that they're studying.
3928000	3932000	But it is just neat that there could be a correlation there. Right. Right.
3932000	3937000	It's just like we always would tell our parents. Video games help me because it improves my hand-eye coordination.
3937000	3941000	You know, even though we all know that's a line at the same time, it's actually it's also kind of true.
3941000	3944000	Like, you know, it does help with some of your reaction times and things like that.
3944000	3948000	It can improve those types of like, you know, motor skills, things like that, too.
3948000	3952000	So I was doing a little bit of double checking.
3952000	3962000	And they do say that people actually that people on the autism spectrum do have a little bit more experience in lucid dreaming.
3962000	3963000	Interesting.
3963000	3971000	Forty four percent out of the study said that they usually remember their dreams and a good number say they are lucid dreamers.
3971000	3973000	Huh. So, yeah.
3973000	3977000	Yeah. Neurochemistry. Science. A little bit of science on this.
3977000	3983000	We see grown men sticking screwdrivers into things and adjusting them.
3983000	3985000	So that was MST3K.
3985000	3989000	I like it. All right. Well, let's move on. We have some other stories going on around the gaming world.
3989000	3992000	Loki. G2A. You got to love them.
3992000	3994000	Actually, you know, you don't know, you know, you don't have to love them at all.
3994000	4002000	They're they're scum. So G2A, if you're not aware, is a third party key seller for various things.
4002000	4008000	So for many, it's a haven for stolen keys.
4008000	4016000	In fact, I believe last week there was developers coming out saying, hey, we would rather you pirate our game than actually purchase a key from G2A.
4016000	4019000	I remember that. That was pretty pretty damning.
4019000	4030000	And so G2A, of course, is saying they're going about it in a really strange way of trying to help their reputation by this.
4030000	4033000	Of course, it's totally going to work out for that reputation.
4033000	4045000	They are they are trying to help their reputation by what reputation for providing some completely unbiased articles.
4045000	4048000	Articles about G2A.
4048000	4064000	So, for example, they have sent requests to several different gaming outlets saying to the effective, we have a written unbiased article about how selling stolen keys on gaming marketplaces is pretty much impossible.
4064000	4070000	And we want you to publish it on your website without being marked as sponsored or marked as associated with G2A.
4070000	4078000	It's it's a transparent and just review of the problem of the stolen keys reselling.
4078000	4086000	Like, I'm sorry, that's pretty fucking shady right there. Like, yes, of course, it's going to be unbiased coming from the site that it's criticizing.
4086000	4094000	Right. Yeah. So it just goes to show you they suck and they're just going to continue to suck.
4094000	4101000	I guess and I guess I can probably talk about this. Bobby and Bobby's even saying we did not get this request at VOG, Frown Face.
4101000	4105000	But we do. Bobby, you know, this we get these random emails and the contact us thing all the time.
4105000	4109000	That's like we have an article we'd like to publish about such and such and such.
4109000	4112000	And Bobby and I just pretty much send those directly to the trash because we're just not interested.
4112000	4121000	Like, you know, we would we would rather just not make money or just rely on the generosity of those who are participating on Twitch and podcasts and stuff.
4121000	4131000	Because, like, I don't want that trash on our site. And but it does go to show that some sites you visit may not have those same type of standards.
4131000	4136000	Now, of course, you're supposed to print some big, you know, promotional piece or something like that.
4136000	4143000	But there's a lot of like even on sites like CNN and sites, you know, are in all of them.
4143000	4148000	Not just, you know, however you feel about lefty news or righty news, MSNBC, Fox News, you name it, all the same.
4148000	4155000	You go on their website and you scroll down to the bottom and it's also like additional articles suggested by Traffic Brain or something like that.
4155000	4160000	And they're all these like garbage articles that are oftentimes promotional spots.
4160000	4164000	It'll be things like because it's the same stuff that I hear on.
4164000	4172000	It's the same people that I will hear advertising on podcasts like why bleep mattress company provides the best sleep at night or something like that.
4172000	4177000	Or how you can get a bunch of good night's sleep on a bleep mattress or something like that.
4177000	4183000	Or, you know, bleep new underwear has this fantastic design that you have to believe.
4183000	4188000	I would do that, but I'd do it in a total monotone.
4188000	4194000	This mattress really helped my back problems. I sound like what's his name?
4194000	4199000	Stein. Why can't I think of his first name? Ben Stein. Wow.
4199000	4207000	Why we are in chat says and all of these recommended articles will have these young, attractive people pictured as a way of attracting clicks or it's the opposite.
4207000	4214000	You'll see some like horrendous looking like, like person that's bust out a bridge troll or something.
4214000	4221000	And it says you won't believe what these child stars look like now. And I think they should just bust out a bridge troll to read it.
4221000	4225000	Yeah. Anyway, so there's we all know there's a lot of garbage on the Internet.
4225000	4230000	Y'all are educated enough to know that. And the best ones are those articles are all like slide shows or whatever.
4230000	4233000	So like every single page is only going to have like one person on it.
4233000	4237000	Yeah. They keep clicking through and they have ads in between everything and then ads on the other pages.
4237000	4242000	Yeah. Let me ask you soon if he says that you do it in a Miss Vangie voice, but my voice does not get that hard.
4242000	4247000	You want to know what those child celebrities look like now?
4247000	4251000	Bam, bam. Yeah. All right, Emeril.
4251000	4255000	That number 10 could get these cookies. All right. Anyway, I'm thinking of cookies.
4255000	4261000	My cookies are amazing. Anyway. Oh, I'd like to say real quick.
4261000	4275000	So G2A, of course, responded to this. These emails were sent by our employee without authorization for which we apologize to the outlets that he sent the proposal to.
4275000	4281000	He will fake face strict consequences as this is an absolute absolutely unacceptable.
4281000	4284000	Sure, you will. Mm hmm.
4284000	4289000	Metal mayhem in chat says not to sound like I'm self-promoting, but I'm the same way when I post in the one steam group.
4289000	4293000	I don't post about deals and freebies on shady sites. I don't think you're self-promoting.
4293000	4302000	I mean, if we know a good free game deal going on, we usually like we usually update you guys on the PlayStation Plus and Xbox of like, you know, the legit stuff.
4302000	4306000	Yeah. We want people to know because I was going to play any PlayStation key sale.
4306000	4311000	I didn't realize that the Epic Game Store went to weekly releases for free games as opposed to every other week.
4311000	4315000	And now I've missed two games. So I wish I'd had that memo. You know what I mean?
4315000	4324000	So like, you know, you've got to grab things before you lose them. But yeah, I wouldn't want to trust like shady websites or you can not look and save your money.
4324000	4329000	But if they're free or you can save your time. Yes, I could save my time.
4329000	4335000	But, you know, look, look at the other ways I choose to spend my time, Dark Sakura.
4335000	4342000	We already know what you're on. We already talked about the subjecting myself to the intensity and mental trauma of playing survivor without a one million dollar prize.
4342000	4352000	So look at the look at my life. Look at my choices. Anyway, what else did I want to mention in our chat?
4352000	4357000	Let's see.
4357000	4366000	I think people are just like making fun of other articles. Questmaster says, I do have the epic game launcher, but just for this free Slime Rancher, I do want to ask about this.
4366000	4373000	And this is kind of like going out of like left field. But I think it's important when we talk about these types of like click bait articles and things like that.
4373000	4384000	Is that something they teach kids about now? And I guess I'm looking at you because you've got to get they don't teach kids about how to tell what is a spam garbage email versus a legit email.
4384000	4392000	Maybe they do. And like later on in like certain technology classes, it's a little young for that. They don't do that now.
4392000	4396000	Let's see. What was my son learning about today? Thanks to YouTube. Oh, gold diggers.
4396000	4404000	He was learning about gold diggers because apparently some stupid YouTuber that he was watching was talking about some gold diggers club in Roblox and how this woman was a gold digger.
4404000	4413000	And I was like, what the fuck are you listening to? I mean, like, I ain't saying she's a gold digger. I hope you asked it just like that, too.
4413000	4418000	No, I'm like, I'm like, what are you listening to? And then he got embarrassed.
4418000	4423000	OK, run, jump, stop actually answers my question in chat. When in doubt, if nobody here knows it, usually somebody in chat knows it.
4423000	4428000	Thank you. Run, jump, stop says they do in high school history classes at the school I teach at.
4428000	4441000	So it's like a high school level type of thing. Well, that's that's probably for the best, you know, because I was like, how do people start to learn to distinguish like what's a commercial versus what spam and what's real and stuff?
4441000	4448000	You know, anyway, it's just an interesting part about living in the year twenty nineteen in our very tapped in online world.
4448000	4454000	Siatabiri says information literacy was an important point they pushed back when I was in library school. Interesting.
4454000	4459000	So and YY says, I was just thinking about this. We have a 14 year old intern in my I.T. department now.
4459000	4466000	And he said they don't currently teach anything about phishing, identity theft, scams or any of that in high school or at least in high school.
4466000	4471000	Yeah, that's the phishing and how to identify websites that are trying to get password. That's an important skill to know.
4471000	4476000	Right. There should be like a class just called adulting adulting 101.
4476000	4480000	I'm serious. Well, you know, they don't put 101 in high school, Rob.
4480000	4485000	But you know what? Back in the day, some of that they used to call home economics.
4485000	4492000	Right. And I know back in the day day it was a class that was mostly aimed at the girls, although by the time I was in high school, it was a boys and girls class.
4492000	4496000	And you would learn basic like here's how to cook and fend for yourself.
4496000	4501000	Like I kind of think like knowing how to not get phished your bank account information online.
4501000	4505000	That's like that's the home economics we need in 2019. Yeah. No matter what.
4505000	4509000	No matter what your gender is or whatever is expected of you.
4509000	4513000	You know, you need to know all these basics about how to stay safe in an online world.
4513000	4519000	So anyway, that should really be like a required class versus like a second language.
4519000	4527000	I get it. Second language is good to learn. But being able to survive in the world is probably a little bit more useful.
4527000	4531000	Being able to speak a technical language is still exactly. Although I don't know.
4531000	4534000	I don't know. I still see that should be counted as a link. The second language.
4534000	4539000	I still see some of the benefit. I don't know. We're starting to get new topic this way outside video games.
4539000	4547000	But I can see some of the benefits still in learning a more classic language like, you know, Spanish or French or, you know, Japanese if your school offers it or whatever.
4547000	4554000	So anyway. All right. Well, let's move on. We better get back to games because we could go on tangent train all night long.
4554000	4558000	Let's talk about let's talk about the other thing that people need to learn how to do.
4558000	4564000	That is not cheat or report cheaters or identify cheaters. And, you know, Blizzard's got this huge game.
4564000	4569000	Overwatch like the Overwatch finals third stage were just today. Right.
4569000	4575000	And I heard the Shanghai Dragons won, which is because Shanghai Dragons was the team that was like they didn't have a single frickin win.
4575000	4578000	And now they're kind of like the comeback kids. So that's really cool.
4578000	4585000	And Shanghai Dragons is the team that I believe is still the lone female in the Overwatch League is on the Shanghai Dragons.
4585000	4592000	But they won. So yay for them. But anyway, Overwatch is obviously still huge.
4592000	4597000	I haven't played it as much as I used to, but I understand it's practically a sport at this point.
4597000	4599000	And a lot of people are still super into it.
4599000	4608000	And so, unfortunately, where there's a lot of people and where there is, you know, pro level gaming and potentially even money to be made, you got cheaters that are out there.
4608000	4619000	Well, in a recent developer update, the game director for Overwatch, Jeff Kaplan, said Blizzard is looking at automatically shutting down matches when it detects cheating.
4619000	4631000	Now, we don't know all the details yet. And that makes sense because usually you don't want to reveal all the details because then the like robots and the things that, you know, help the cheaters cheat, try to get around that and get ahead of that.
4631000	4634000	So they're not kind of playing all their cards on how they're going to do this.
4634000	4640000	But it just says that only the cheater will face very harsh actions.
4640000	4649000	You, the non-cheater, will not lose your SR points from a competitive match just because someone joined it wanting to fuck with it and your match gets aborted.
4649000	4655000	So it's kind of interesting. He also mentioned this feature is now live on public test realm servers.
4655000	4657000	So they're already kind of looking into it.
4657000	4665000	And again, we don't know exactly what they're doing because obviously if they were to say what they're doing to detect it, then that would just help the cheaters cheat.
4665000	4673000	So we'll see. But the concept of stopping the match completely because someone is cheating, that's kind of the new thing here.
4673000	4681000	What do you think about that? Like, as opposed to like letting it play out or whatever, just stop. The match is done because somebody is cheating.
4681000	4682000	I think it's good.
4682000	4689000	Yeah. I think it might be very frustrating for some of the other people in it that aren't cheating, but at least their records aren't being impacted or whatever.
4689000	4691000	And you kind of know it's being dealt with, I guess.
4691000	4697000	But I also kind of think the cheaters are still going to find a way around it, but I think it's kind of interesting.
4697000	4699000	Or do that to like fuck with matches.
4699000	4700000	Yeah.
4700000	4705000	YYR says, wait, shutting down the entire match or just kicking the cheaters?
4705000	4713000	No, it's shutting down the entire match, but only punishing the cheater and not impacting anyone else's score.
4713000	4720000	But like, wouldn't that lead to these weird situations where like your team is losing horrifically so somebody cheats on the team and takes a bullet for everybody else?
4720000	4725000	But I guess, I guess that would be silly because you might end up getting banned and that's not a bullet worth taking probably.
4725000	4726000	I guess, yeah.
4726000	4730000	Yeah. Anyway, it's interesting. I just kind of interested to see like where that ends up.
4730000	4738000	I'm curious to see when this starts happening on Twitch and you get some, you know, because lots of people play Overwatch here on Twitch, right?
4738000	4743000	So I'm kind of curious to see what's going to happen when some of these like pro level streamers are playing a game, they're streaming it, and then all of a sudden,
4743000	4748000	book kill switch gets activated, kind of like what the reactions are going to be, what that's going to do.
4748000	4751000	I'm curious to see what that's, what's going to happen there.
4751000	4753000	So more to come on this.
4753000	4757000	Again, it's in the public test room right now, but yet to hit the live servers.
4757000	4763000	Who knows if they're even going to say when it hits the live servers, but I guess people will start noticing when their matches just all of a sudden quit.
4763000	4764000	Right.
4764000	4766000	Anyway, Dark Sakura.
4766000	4775000	Well, there is going to be a glorious thing happening tomorrow, which is Monday the 15th on Amazon Prime Day.
4775000	4782000	It is the day that preorders for the Turbo Graphics Classic or whatever they're calling it.
4782000	4792000	The Turbo Graphics 16 Mini is going to go on preorder or order or sale or whatever the fuck they're calling it, presale.
4792000	4793000	Advanced purchase.
4793000	4794000	Advanced purchase. Thank you.
4795000	4799000	It will be released on March 19th, 2020.
4799000	4801000	But here's what's what's really neat about it.
4801000	4805000	By the way, the Japanese version is going to be 10,500 yen, so about 100 bucks.
4805000	4808000	They haven't done a U.S. price on it yet.
4808000	4817000	But this is the fun thing is that it's coming with 24 American versions of games and 26 Japanese versions.
4817000	4821000	They are going to have both the U.S. and Japanese versions of Utopia.
4821000	4826000	So not yet 50 games, really, because two of them, well, four of them are going to be the same.
4826000	4828000	Sorry, two of them are going to be the same.
4828000	4830000	It's going to be both versions of Utopia.
4830000	4835000	But among the ones that we're going to freakin get, and here's Jamie being happy.
4835000	4839000	We are going to be getting, of course, R-Type because Jamie loves R-Type.
4839000	4844000	It's going to have a Sapphire, which I've covered as a classic game.
4844000	4850000	One of those really awesome shooters.
4850000	4856000	It's going to have Parasol Stars and Cadash on it, which were working designs games.
4856000	4859000	Snatcher is going to be on it, but it's the Japanese version.
4859000	4861000	Rondo of Blood is going to be on it.
4861000	4863000	You know, I'm happy, you know, there's Space Harrier.
4863000	4865000	There's Cho Aniki.
4865000	4866000	That's awesome.
4866000	4868000	Yeah.
4868000	4873000	Daimakaimura, which is one of the super graphics games, Ghouls and Ghosts.
4873000	4875000	But it's a super graphics game.
4875000	4880000	Ninja Gaiden, or as that one was, Ninja Ryukenden.
4880000	4883000	PC Genjin, which was Bonk, Salamander.
4883000	4889000	I mean, Super Darius, Super Star Soldier, Ys I and II.
4889000	4893000	I mean, I'm just beside myself.
4893000	4900000	I got to say, I was not expecting the list to go this deep and be this good.
4900000	4903000	All dines will be on there, which is another super graphics game.
4903000	4907000	The fact that they're including Japanese stuff that we never even got here.
4907000	4909000	Gradius II.
4909000	4910000	That's awesome.
4910000	4911000	Yeah.
4911000	4914000	We didn't get Gradius II until that Gradius pack came out later.
4914000	4919000	I feel like more of these will sell than actual Turbo Graphics 16s did in America.
4919000	4921000	Maybe.
4921000	4925000	It also looks like they're having both versions of Ys Book 1 and 2.
4925000	4929000	But it is the US version of Parasol Stars.
4929000	4931000	Yeah, that's awesome.
4931000	4938000	J.J. and Jeff, Kaddash, Bonk's Adventure, Bomberman 93, Blazing Lasers, Alien Crush.
4938000	4942000	Oh, those Crush games are so... Is Devil's Crush there too, or just Alien?
4942000	4944000	I don't see Devil's Crush on here.
4944000	4945000	R-Type.
4945000	4949000	YYR points out the Turbo Graphics 16 mini is an Amazon exclusive.
4949000	4950000	Yeah.
4950000	4951000	Worth pointing out.
4951000	4952000	So it's the only way to get it.
4952000	4956000	And we'll see what happens.
4956000	4958000	I think I'm going to do it.
4958000	4960000	So I might stay up until midnight.
4960000	4963000	Oh yeah, just so you can get... Is it going to be midnight Eastern though?
4963000	4964000	I don't know.
4964000	4965000	I don't know.
4965000	4968000	Well, I'll be checking... Yeah, I'll be checking in two hours.
4968000	4970000	Yeah.
4970000	4972000	I think I might get one too.
4972000	4976000	The game selection is too fucking good on this thing.
4976000	4982000	And there's some real... Just as a retro gaming fan, how rare some of these games are.
4983000	4986000	That Castlevania game you paid...
4986000	4987000	A hundred bones.
4987000	4988000	Yeah, like an exchange thing.
4988000	4989000	Someone paid me back.
4989000	4990000	Yeah.
4990000	4992000	They owed us a hundred bucks and came back with Dracula X.
4992000	4996000	Yeah, so that game has been worth a lot historically for collectors.
4996000	4998000	So it's kind of neat.
4998000	5000000	Bobby Blackwolf says, I'm going to get it.
5000000	5002000	DJ Rama S says, I'm already planning on getting this.
5002000	5004000	SJ100Matt, I'm considering this.
5004000	5007000	All those comments from our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
5007000	5010000	So you better believe I'm going to be hanging out over here until nine o'clock.
5010000	5013000	Just to make sure. I understand.
5013000	5015000	I'm probably going to be right there with you honestly.
5015000	5017000	You don't have to pay the entire hundred up front though, right?
5017000	5018000	You just have to...
5018000	5020000	I don't know. It doesn't say.
5020000	5022000	Usually on Amazon you don't pay until it ships.
5022000	5024000	Yeah, so...
5024000	5027000	And now run, jump, stop and our chat is like, damn it, now I want it.
5027000	5029000	It's contagious, isn't it?
5029000	5030000	Loki, you in?
5030000	5031000	I don't know.
5031000	5032000	Turbo Graphics Club, you in?
5032000	5035000	I do have quite a bit of credit in...
5035000	5037000	This is on the Japanese site though that it's showing this.
5037000	5040000	I have quite a bit of credit in Amazon right now, so...
5040000	5044000	Yeah, actually I got a gift certificate for like a belated birthday present.
5044000	5045000	So yeah, I might...
5045000	5047000	Yeah, I got something through my work.
5047000	5048000	Put it towards that, yeah.
5048000	5049000	All right, anyway.
5049000	5050000	Let's move on.
5050000	5052000	A few more stories for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week.
5052000	5053000	Loki.
5053000	5056000	Let's talk about movies and video game movies.
5056000	5057000	Woo.
5057000	5062000	Now you know this is going to be good because it's a Space Invaders movie.
5062000	5064000	So New Line Cinemas...
5064000	5066000	Is it going to be good, Loki?
5066000	5069000	I say that with great sarcasm.
5069000	5073000	So apparently they're going to try to make a Space Invaders movie.
5073000	5079000	And currently the script is being written by Greg Russo.
5079000	5085000	And who has also written, I guess, the Mortal Kombat reboot.
5088000	5089000	I don't know.
5089000	5090000	I don't know what the plot's going to be.
5090000	5092000	Does it really matter?
5092000	5099000	Because it'll come out eventually and either it'll be like absolute shit, like pixels,
5099000	5102000	or it may be decent.
5102000	5107000	Or it could be like so bad it's actually kind of good like Independence Day.
5107000	5108000	That's a sci-fi movie.
5108000	5109000	I want it to be like a sci-fi...
5109000	5110000	Or like Sharknado.
5110000	5111000	Like Sharknado.
5111000	5112000	Okay.
5112000	5113000	Yeah, I'm with that.
5113000	5116000	I want my Space Invaders movie to be so bad it's kind of good.
5116000	5117000	Yes.
5117000	5118000	I'm down.
5118000	5119000	I'm with it.
5120000	5122000	Tara Reid to star in, please.
5122000	5126000	A movie that will probably be pretty good is actually the Mortal Kombat reboot.
5126000	5130000	And they have confirmed, also Greg Russo had confirmed that,
5130000	5136000	yes, it is going to be rated R, and yes, there's even going to be fatalities.
5138000	5142000	You're going to be there day one because I know how much you love those fatalities.
5142000	5145000	Well, I mean, the old Mortal Kombat movie had fatalities,
5145000	5148000	but they were the more like the same fatalities you would see on Super Nintendo.
5148000	5152000	Like I remember the one guy got turned to ice and then shattered into a million pieces.
5152000	5153000	Oh, I can't wait.
5153000	5156000	Yeah, like that was the Super Nintendo fatality, too.
5156000	5158000	I'd probably go see it just for that.
5158000	5161000	And then doesn't Shang Tsung like take the soul out of somebody, too?
5161000	5163000	But those are all very...
5163000	5166000	I want to see the friendships and the fatalities.
5166000	5168000	Like I think they should have all that.
5170000	5172000	Yeah, so I don't know.
5172000	5174000	I mean, if it looks like it's really good, I guess,
5174000	5177000	but I'm going to have to hear how gory it is.
5177000	5180000	Because if it's like on the level of these like new Mortal Kombat games
5180000	5183000	that are just like too much, I might just need...
5183000	5186000	I may need to just watch it at home and have somebody tell me, look away.
5187000	5188000	OK.
5188000	5189000	All right, you can look again.
5189000	5191000	Like I'm just going to need to watch it that way. Look away.
5194000	5196000	I need to see how bad it's going to be.
5196000	5201000	Pod Culture is asking, will the PG-13 version cut swap out the blood for sweat?
5201000	5203000	Well, if the movie does well enough, anything's possible.
5203000	5205000	They did a PG-13 version of Deadpool.
5205000	5209000	Yeah, that's because that's because they wanted to, you know, get...
5209000	5211000	They wanted more money.
5211000	5214000	Well, yes, that's that's why the studios do these things is to get more money.
5214000	5218000	So I'm just saying Mortal Kombat may have a sweat version as well, I guess.
5220000	5221000	Anyway.
5221000	5222000	All right.
5223000	5224000	Moving on.
5224000	5229000	Tigerclaw in chat says, James Wan, who directed Aquaman, previously did the Saw movies.
5229000	5231000	Also, they cast Sub-Zero.
5231000	5234000	Yeah, that's true. They had a Sub-Zero already cast.
5234000	5236000	I was seeing an article on that.
5236000	5238000	But, you know, you know, the guys...
5238000	5241000	Just because you directed Saw doesn't mean like I have something against you or something.
5241000	5243000	I just don't care for those movies.
5243000	5246000	But, I think he did Saw 3 and 4.
5246000	5248000	I like the Saw movies.
5248000	5250000	I just don't remember where I left off.
5250000	5252000	So I don't know what to start over.
5252000	5254000	You know, there's like a new Saw movie.
5254000	5255000	They're rebooting it.
5255000	5257000	Chris Rock and Samuel L. Jackson.
5257000	5259000	They're both confirmed they're in it.
5259000	5261000	Chris Rock is the star of the new Saw movie.
5261000	5262000	I need to see that.
5262000	5264000	I don't associate him with scary movies.
5264000	5266000	But maybe he's trying to reinvent himself. I don't know.
5266000	5268000	But anyway, I didn't want to talk about...
5268000	5273000	Well, Saw 3 and 4, the director of those was the guy that did Repo, the genetic opera.
5273000	5275000	Which is also... It's a little violent.
5275000	5277000	But it's one of those movies that kind of grew on me.
5277000	5281000	Just because the music is really good.
5281000	5286000	And it's Anthony Stewart Head and Sarah Brightman in a movie with Paris Hilton.
5286000	5288000	Is Sarah Brightman not sounding terrible?
5288000	5292000	Paris Hilton in a role that actually makes a lot of sense for Paris Hilton.
5292000	5294000	Yeah, Repo, the genetic opera is...
5294000	5296000	It took a couple of watches.
5296000	5298000	But then I was like...
5298000	5301000	I get why people really love this movie.
5301000	5303000	And then the whole cult thing.
5303000	5307000	I've been to the Rocky Horror style performances that are really astonishing.
5307000	5311000	And I hear another one's coming soon. We'll see.
5311000	5314000	Anyway, moving on.
5315000	5318000	Tigerclaw says the actor that they got is someone who is in the raid.
5318000	5324000	Dark Tetsuya says I wonder if the gore will be in line with Mortal Kombat 9, 10, 11 in that case.
5324000	5327000	I would anticipate probably it's going to be more along the lines of the reboot.
5327000	5330000	So that's why I kind of want to just... No more detail.
5330000	5332000	Alright. Anyway.
5332000	5335000	So for the record, by the way, to go back to the PC Engine thing.
5335000	5337000	I don't see it on the US site at all.
5337000	5342000	The link was for the Japanese site which links back to the Italian site and the UK site.
5342000	5346000	I'm sure it will be up on the US store. It's supposed to be a US release thing.
5346000	5348000	So it's probably just not there yet.
5348000	5350000	I'm looking at the early...
5350000	5353000	Japan is also on tomorrow right now. So maybe that's why.
5353000	5354000	Maybe.
5354000	5355000	Anyway.
5355000	5361000	So there was a new game that was going to be on its way out called Ion Maiden.
5361000	5363000	Remember? And then there was the whole lawsuit.
5363000	5366000	Because Iron Maiden was none too happy about that.
5366000	5369000	And I didn't know this. I learned this watching Bobby Black Wolf tonight.
5369000	5372000	I learned things on the Bobby Black Wolf show, believe it or not.
5372000	5374000	And Dark Soccer, you probably know this.
5374000	5376000	Iron Maiden has a pinball table.
5376000	5378000	I did not know. They have a brand new pinball table.
5378000	5380000	I think I mentioned it on the show.
5380000	5384000	You probably did. But you did it long enough ago
5384000	5387000	where I didn't connect the dots until tonight when Bobby brought it up.
5387000	5391000	I was like, oh, so Iron Maiden does have an interest in gaming
5391000	5396000	and making sure that their name for gaming purposes and gaming protection is like...
5396000	5398000	So they kind of have a purpose to do that.
5398000	5403000	So I was like, this makes a lot more sense why they went after Ion Maiden.
5403000	5409000	So anyhow, Ion Maiden has chosen, instead of going through a big court fight,
5409000	5411000	they are going to change the name of their game.
5411000	5414000	The game is now called Ion Fury.
5414000	5418000	And in a statement, Mike Nielsen, who's the CEO of 3D Realms, said,
5418000	5421000	After careful consideration, we've decided to rename our first-person shooter,
5421000	5423000	Ion Maiden, to Ion Fury.
5423000	5425000	A lot of thought went into this, but most importantly,
5425000	5428000	it would be a disservice to our loyal fanbase and the fantastic developers
5428000	5430000	to drag out a long lawsuit.
5430000	5432000	The amazing gameplay, interactivity, and pure fun
5432000	5436000	is what makes Ion Fury a great game, not the title.
5436000	5439000	And is anyone surprised that this is what ended up happening?
5439000	5442000	Nope. Nope. Nope. Thought so.
5442000	5446000	It's just, you know, it got settled before it ever went to court
5446000	5448000	and would be a waste of everyone's time.
5448000	5451000	And, you know, maybe they thought Iron Maiden would be flattered.
5451000	5454000	And maybe to some extent they still are, but because of the pinball machine
5454000	5456000	and maybe other things, who knows it's brewing,
5456000	5460000	that, you know, you have to protect your intellectual property, right?
5460000	5463000	It's like Nintendo. As much as we get fed up with how often they shut down sites,
5463000	5467000	if you don't actively enforce your intellectual property, you might lose it.
5467000	5469000	So they kind of have to do what they do.
5469000	5472000	And maybe to some extent, Iron Maiden felt that need as well.
5472000	5474000	So, anyway.
5474000	5478000	Dar Tetsuya points out, one of the local pizza places here
5478000	5481000	has the Iron Maiden table, though I haven't gotten around to playing on it yet.
5481000	5483000	I want to check that out at some point.
5483000	5485000	Does the place downtown with all the pinball machines have it?
5485000	5488000	Because they seem to have a lot of newer pinball machines.
5488000	5491000	They've had it around, I think, before, but mostly I've just played at cons.
5491000	5493000	Interesting. All right.
5493000	5497000	Yeah, I mean, California Extremes in a couple weeks, so I'm sure they'll have it there.
5497000	5500000	I really hope I can go to California Extreme this year, but I don't know.
5500000	5505000	Unfortunately, now that weekend shares the distinction with being the anniversary of my mom passing.
5505000	5509000	So it's like if there's family stuff going on, obviously I'm going to do that instead.
5509000	5512000	But if it works out to go to a California Extreme, I'd really love to do that.
5512000	5514000	So, anyhow.
5514000	5520000	Well, speaking of classic game shows, why not take a moment to take a trip down memory lane
5520000	5522000	and visit a classic game of the week?
5522000	5526000	Every week, Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,
5526000	5532000	hey, you guys need to recognize the importance of classic games, especially this week's game.
5532000	5536000	This is a pretty big one, I think, that's been highly influential.
5536000	5537000	So let's talk about it.
5537000	5540000	I went way back for this. We're looking at a 40-year-old game.
5540000	5543000	But this is very important. What is the classic game of the week this week?
5543000	5549000	Galaxian. Yes, Galaxian came out in 1979 by Namco.
5549000	5554000	It was licensed to Midway Games to distribute and manufacture here in North America.
5554000	5560000	So basically, if you played Galaga, you played Galaxian. It's the same type of game.
5560000	5566000	You have your little ship at the bottom, and you have to kill the Galaxian aliens.
5566000	5568000	They will show and fly in formation.
5568000	5575000	But it was created as a direct response to Space Invaders, which was released by Taito a year before.
5575000	5587000	Its development was headed by Sawano Kazunori, who produced electromechanical shooting gallery games for Namco.
5587000	5591000	And the programming was done by Tashiro Koichi.
5592000	5600000	Anyway, they didn't really expect it to do great, but it really was a great seller.
5600000	5605000	They had 40,000 arcade units out in North America by 1982.
5605000	5615000	It wasn't the first color arcade game, but it had RGB color graphics integrated into the animations and explosions.
5615000	5619000	So it really did more with color graphics for its time.
5620000	5626000	And for the record, the Japanese release was October 1979, and North American was December 1979.
5626000	5628000	So both of them were in the 70s.
5628000	5633000	And then, of course, the successor to this was Galaga.
5633000	5642000	And it actually replaced Galaxian in terms of popularity during the Golden Age of arcade games.
5642000	5647000	And then Galaxian has had other home releases. I'll get into that in a bit.
5647000	5653000	But again, it's a fixed shooter type of game, kind of that gallery style.
5653000	5661000	Your ship is called the Galaxip, G-A-L-A-X-I-P, and you have to kill the Galaxians.
5661000	5667000	So as far as its development, it was developed in 1979 as well and released in Japan that year.
5667000	5673000	They wanted to take and improve upon Space Invaders, which was at its time very revolutionary.
5673000	5679000	So they put in that new technology in its arcade board, and it was also called the Namco Galaxian board.
5682000	5689000	And so it had a full color screen, it had enemies that moved around, you had your own ship that moved about.
5689000	5697000	And the Galaxian arcade board also introduced tile map hardware.
5697000	5708000	So it would render a tile map that was 8x8 pixel tiles, which reduced processing memory requirements up to 64 times over Space Invaders.
5708000	5714000	So the whole, you know, what into it was really a bunch of innovation from what had been out before.
5714000	5725000	At any rate, we had other releases. We had Galaga, we had Galplus that came out in 1984, you know, went along the same type of gameplay.
5725000	5735000	And then there was Galaga 88 and 87, and then there was Galaga Arrangement that came out with the Namco Classics Collection Volume 1 in 1985.
5735000	5745000	The Namco Galaxian board was also used for later games such as Nintendo's Radarscope and Donkey Kong.
5745000	5751000	And then home consoles incorporated a lot of the same technology.
5751000	5762000	So as far as there being other ports, Atari did its own versions of Galaxian for the various 8-bit families, the Atari 2600 and the Atari 5200.
5762000	5774000	There were other ports that were under the Atari Soft label, which released some for Apple II, ColecoVision, Commodore 64, the VIC-20, the IBM PC, and the ZX Spectrum.
5774000	5785000	There were other ports that came out for MSX in Europe and Japan, NECPC-8801 and the Famicon that was in Japan, and the Sharp X1.
5785000	5792000	Bally Astrocade version was also published as Galaxian but changed it to Galactic Invasion.
5792000	5799000	Coleco did a standalone mini-arcade tabletop, remember those? The little standalone machines?
5799000	5804000	So they did Galaxian in 1981, and also of course did Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, and Frogger.
5804000	5815000	Entex did a handheld version of it called Galaxian 2, and it was called Galaxian 2 because it had two-player mode. It was not a sequel.
5815000	5822000	So at any rate, other re-releases that happened, we had the Namco Museum versions that released.
5822000	5826000	Galaxian and Galaga were bundled together for the Game Boy for Arcade Classics 3.
5826000	5832000	Galaxian was released on Windows in 1995 as part of Microsoft Return of Arcade.
5832000	5839000	There was also a release of it in Pac-Man's Arcade Party 30th Anniversary arcade machine.
5839000	5845000	It has also been part of the Jack-specific Plug It In and Play TV game controllers.
5846000	5861000	Galaxian as well as Galaga, Gal Plus, and Galaga 88 was, quote, redesigned and modernized as an iPhone app called Galaga 30th Anniversary Collection that commemorated the anniversary for Namco Bandai.
5861000	5866000	And then Super Impulse also did the standalone tiny arcade version of Galaxian.
5867000	5876000	Galaxian has really gone in to be in so, like, the ship, and it has been in so many other games that I'm not even gonna freaking list them all.
5876000	5885000	Including multiple Tekken games, you know, Super Smash Brothers, some Pac-Man games, basically just all kinds of things, including a game called Tinkle Pit.
5885000	5892000	Yeah, that little flower that's at the top of every board, or I guess a spaceship that looks like a flower, that is like iconic with Namco, you know what I mean?
5892000	5893000	Yeah.
5893000	5894000	Yeah.
5894000	5903000	So, of course, the Galaxian world record was a focus of competitive, you know, issue.
5905000	5923000	There was a, actually it looks like there was a big rivalry between a British fellow named Gary Whelan and an American named Perry Rogers who faced off at the Apollo Amusements in Pompano Beach, Florida on the 6th through the 9th of April 2006.
5923000	5946000	And Whelan had the world record of 1,114,550 points and was beaten by a netherlander named Arte van Wielet who scored 1,653,270 points on May 27, 2009 at Fun Spot Family Center in Wiers Beach, New Hampshire.
5946000	5948000	And there you go.
5948000	5952000	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week, Galaxian in the arcade.
5952000	5954000	That's older than a lot of y'all.
5954000	5957000	Yeah, obviously on a multitude of platforms later on.
5957000	5959000	I was three.
5959000	5961000	Great pick, thank you.
5961000	5978000	And yeah, it's kind of, it's interesting because obviously I know I used to get that game confused with Galaga all the time, although obviously we understand they have a lot in common, you know, and Galaga obviously built on it with the whole like the double ship thing is very iconic in Galaga and, you know, just there's bonus rounds and other things.
5978000	5979000	I don't know if I've ever done Galplus though.
5979000	5980000	Galplus?
5980000	5981000	Galplus?
5981000	5985000	I don't, I think I've played it once or twice, but I don't really remember it the same.
5985000	5987000	You know, I don't think it made quite as...
5987000	5990000	I played Galplus at California Extreme. They've had it there the last few years.
5990000	5991000	Right.
5991000	6006000	But like Galaxian, I mean, you know, it is, yes, an older game and so if you, especially if you're looking at the footage, you probably go, okay, it looks a little basic, but at the same time, it's like, okay, but consider that Space Invaders transformed the video game industry, especially when it came to Japan.
6006000	6013000	Like, you know, they were running out of the equivalent of quarters over there for people playing those games because Space Invaders was so freaking popular.
6013000	6018000	I want to say it was like a 5 yen coin shortage.
6018000	6019000	Yeah.
6019000	6020000	So it was pretty crazy.
6020000	6025000	Yeah. And so, you know, Galaxian is this interesting kind of evolution of that.
6025000	6034000	So obviously, you know, it was kind of like, okay, now what does this idea look like two years later where now the Space Invaders move beyond just this marching pattern.
6034000	6041000	And obviously you kind of see all the differences in that game that kind of led to some of the shooters that then followed in the late 80s.
6041000	6049000	I would say, you know, looking at that game in some ways, I see ways that it influenced a game like JIRUS, you know, even though it's, you know, very different and, you know, many shooters that came after it.
6049000	6059000	And one thing I have really noticed is that when a game comes out, there's going to be a group that loves it and is going to try to improve on it.
6059000	6060000	Yeah.
6060000	6064000	But it's always what I say. Be critical of the things that you love. Always make them better.
6064000	6067000	All right. Well, thank you for that classic game of the week.
6067000	6070000	We don't have a break segment tonight. We're just going to power through tonight.
6070000	6072000	I didn't have time to get a video done.
6073000	6080000	I have to admit one thing that also has been taking up my time this past week is that I binged Stranger Things 3.
6080000	6082000	Yes.
6082000	6086000	Don't worry. I'm not going to spoil. I might be a bitch, but I'm not that bitch.
6086000	6088000	OK, so I'm not going to say anything, but I did.
6088000	6094000	I actually part of the reason why I binged it was because I was worried about getting spoiled.
6094000	6095000	Yes.
6095000	6105000	And in fact, then my husband blurted something out that I guess he had read online or something and he's like, doesn't and he said something and I was like, what the fuck?
6105000	6109000	You know, I'm watching right now. Now, luckily, what he said was kind of not right.
6109000	6111000	So I was thankful.
6111000	6117000	But, you know, I'm like, that's part of the reason why I felt the need to power through, because I'm like, it's just a matter of time before I get spoiled on Twitter.
6117000	6121000	And now I realize some of the things I've been seeing were spoilers.
6121000	6123000	They just weren't labeled as such.
6123000	6127000	So and they were, I should say, more minor.
6127000	6130000	Don't worry. Like, if you're suddenly going through your head, what could have been a spoiler?
6130000	6132000	I'm just saying there were definitely like references.
6132000	6135000	I realized were references until like, oh, now that I'm finished with it.
6135000	6141000	So there's that weird thing that they have going on with where you can download Microsoft one point or something like that.
6141000	6146000	But it's a Stranger Things like mini game that Microsoft's doing.
6146000	6148000	Have you even seen that? I think a Windows one.
6148000	6150000	Yeah. Windows assignment.
6150000	6157000	And Alan saw at Target there was one because, you know, I collect these those little mini arcade machines.
6157000	6168000	And they had one that was like a Stranger Things machine, but it had like 50 games in it because it had some Namco classics in it, apparently, and then some random like Stranger Things game.
6168000	6174000	They all look like like garbagey cell phone games. It was interesting that they kind of crammed that all in a little cabinet.
6174000	6176000	License the crap out of it.
6176000	6181000	Well, yeah, they're they're going hog wild with the 80s references with Stranger Things three and all that.
6181000	6186000	So, you know, it's kind of, you know, but it's a it's a good show. I liked it overall.
6186000	6190000	I there's a few things about the plot. But again, I'm not going to go down that road.
6190000	6193000	I've just I was just kind of a few things to maybe go.
6193000	6196000	I don't know. I don't know if I like how they did that. But overall, I really liked it.
6196000	6200000	Yeah. Yeah. It's a good show. Anyway.
6200000	6205000	Dark Tetsuya in chat says, oh, the Stranger Things mini arcade. I saw a review. It looks awful.
6205000	6211000	It's just it's just a bunch of cheap games thrown in. You know, it's they and they have these go.
6211000	6221000	I swear when I was at Fry's not that long ago, like in the selection that had all the PlayStation one minis trying to offload and some of whatever was left of the NES and SNES minis.
6221000	6228000	There are all sorts of fucking minis now. Like everybody is getting on board with these minis and they were already like, you know.
6228000	6234000	Oh, yeah, that is weird. They sold those little joysticks that had like Pac-Man built into it and stuff.
6234000	6238000	Like they've been selling that type of stuff for a long time. And now that stuff is like really that looks like crap.
6238000	6245000	Yeah. I even told Alan, I said, you don't really need to buy that for me.
6245000	6249000	Yeah, it's got some Namco games and 16 Stranger Things themed game.
6249000	6253000	Yeah. And if you look at the Stranger Things games, they don't look there's like a match three.
6253000	6258000	And, you know, it's all your tropes that don't look that great. Let's see.
6258000	6261000	See a Tiberian chat says, I will not complain about a Winona Ryder vehicle.
6261000	6267000	Well, she's great. And that what's her name? That plays 11 Millie Bobby Brown.
6267000	6270000	They're going to nominate her for an Emmy again. Guarantee it.
6270000	6274000	Here's the more important thing that they have, though, the Dungeons and Dragons starter set.
6274000	6279000	The Stranger Things edition, because that's yeah, that's a big part of. Yeah, absolutely.
6279000	6284000	Everything. Everything's got Stranger Things. I will say this. This isn't spoilery.
6284000	6288000	Now that the kids are getting older and you can actually see like they look older. Right.
6288000	6295000	Like, you know, it's been like two and a half years. You can see them like growing up now that they look older because they are getting older.
6295000	6306000	They're not afraid to put them in more danger. And so like some of the scenes are really tense because, you know, you might see a kid get hurt because the kids are getting older.
6306000	6312000	So they're, you know, kind of willing to put them in more dangerous scenarios. So it's just kind of interesting.
6312000	6317000	Yeah. Anyway. All right. Moving on.
6317000	6323000	Guys, you know, in chat says no binge. I watch one episode a day in my VR theater. If you binge, you miss stuff.
6323000	6329000	I can say I don't like to I don't like to binge a lot of shows, but that one I binged. That's a pretty hard generalization.
6329000	6336000	What? If you binge, you miss stuff. I think it just depends on who you are and you know how you watch stuff. So, yeah.
6336000	6341000	As Joe and Hunter Matt says, apparently they're doing a fourth season and it's reportedly the last. Yes.
6341000	6347000	I've heard that they're going to end it at four or five. And that would make sense because those kids those kids are going to be like full on.
6347000	6352000	I think they're probably what it's hard to carry on the story.
6352000	6356000	I mean, yeah, it's got to come to an end at some point. It's going to have to.
6356000	6360000	So they have it like, oh, God save the world again. Oh, God save the world again. Oh, God save the world.
6360000	6367000	It's like you got to at some point. I think they're looking for a way desperately to spin it off.
6367000	6372000	And you saw that in the last season. And I wish nobody like that.
6372000	6377000	Nobody liked that episode. And there is nothing like that in season three. I will say that.
6377000	6382000	But I do think there are other ways that they have set little clues that they could spin it off.
6382000	6387000	So I think that's what's going to happen. There's only going to be four or five episodes of Stranger Things, but there will be a spin off.
6387000	6393000	Absolutely. Fucking look at Game of Thrones. You know, HBO didn't really want that ended badly.
6393000	6397000	So there. Well, yeah, we all heard the ending was horrible, but we know that we already know there.
6397000	6403000	I watched it. It was terrible. I know it was on Sunday nights. I know you can watch on demand and stuff.
6403000	6408000	I just don't didn't care enough. But they're spinning that off.
6408000	6413000	So that that's what I think will happen to Stranger Things. They do four or five seasons, then they're going to spin it off.
6413000	6419000	So. All right. Pod culture says hopefully they keep the VHS style packaging for the next seasons.
6419000	6424000	I picked up the first two hella cheap at Target. Oh, I'm sure they will. I'm sure. Anyway.
6424000	6429000	All right. Let's move on. Let's get into some other gaming news as we travel around and look at some rapid fire.
6429000	6433000	Some fast news for the week. Loki. Yes. Some breathtaking mods out there.
6433000	6439000	So we've got one familiar solid five that allows you to play as, of course, Keanu Reeves.
6439000	6448000	But, you know, John. Yes. John Wick or Silverhand from Cyberpunk 2077.
6448000	6455000	And of course, it's amazing. And you can go check it out.
6455000	6463000	Yeah, I know. You know, I think I have this game from some sort of bundle, but I haven't bothered to actually play it.
6463000	6467000	So maybe I have to go do this now. That's on Nexus mods, if you're interested.
6467000	6475000	And then another game that is on Steam that I know I was interested in when I saw the first trailer for it, because I do love Goat Simulator.
6475000	6480000	However, this does not tie in with Goat Simulator, but it's the same type of thing.
6480000	6489000	It's called Goat of Duty. And it's basically the puts the players in the role of a goat with this cybernetic arm that has guns attached to it.
6489000	6493000	And you're basically fighting each other in the Call of Duty style game.
6493000	6499000	But it has a lot of weird stuff that you can do in there. You can throw down tornadoes. You can fake your death.
6499000	6507000	You feign death. He has a two hundred and fifty bleeds you can do, which is pretty amazing.
6507000	6517000	But it is out in early access right now, so you can actually pick it up for $5.94 during the launch week or $6.99 when the sale ends on the 17th.
6517000	6520000	I may have to pick this up.
6520000	6523000	I was going to say, that was a very specific price, but I get it. It's a discount. Okay, I get it.
6523000	6526000	Yeah, yeah. It's probably like a 10% discount or something.
6526000	6538000	Yeah, sounds like it. Anyway, hey, if you still have not played the Arkham trilogy, the Batman Arkham trilogy, which was like Arkham City, Arkham Knight, Arkham Asylum.
6538000	6541000	I don't even remember all the games that were in it, but I know they were all good games, though.
6541000	6548000	They were fun. Yeah, Arkham Asylum was the first one. Then it was Arkham City was the second one, and then Arkham Knight was the last one.
6548000	6552000	Okay, so I did get them all the titles right. So anyway, that was the trilogy. Some of you may still not have played it.
6552000	6567000	Well, guess what? Thanks to an Amazon leak, we know that there's going to be a Steelbook release coming out. It's the Batman Arkham Collection Steelbook edition, which will have, or I could have looked at the story, and it's all right here, which will have Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and Arkham Knight. It's more fun to quiz myself.
6567000	6570000	But you knew it, though. You were doubting yourself.
6570000	6574000	But remember, there was another one. There was Arkham Origins that was done by a different studio.
6574000	6578000	Right. Yeah, that won't be a part of this. This is the Rocksteady releases.
6578000	6584000	Rocksteady did confirm that the leak was a legit thing, so this will be happening.
6584000	6591000	And I'm sure if you're a collector and you like to get things like Steelbooks and stuff, this will probably be something you're really into.
6591000	6596000	And it does sound like it's going to be physical discs, not just digital downloads.
6596000	6603000	You will get the post-release content, and there will be, I guess, an Earth to Dark Knight skin for the PS4 edition.
6603000	6611000	Anyway, if you have yet to get this trilogy, maybe now's the time. You can get it on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on September 6th for $50.
6611000	6616000	They were good games, though. I didn't beat any of them. I played them all, but I didn't beat them.
6616000	6624000	Anyway, apparently there was rumors this week that Final Fantasy VII's remake was going to be coming out for Xbox One.
6624000	6633000	And this was due to Xbox Germany apparently posting information about Final Fantasy VII Remake and then suddenly pulling it.
6633000	6637000	It was dubbed an internal mistake, and that's all that was there.
6637000	6644000	Apparently it had said that the remake would come to Xbox One in March of 2020, right when the PlayStation 4 version would come out,
6644000	6650000	which totally counter-dicted when they announced the game originally that it would be on PlayStation 4 first.
6650000	6659000	Well, in a follow-up statement, Square Enix did say they have no plans for other platforms, which is their nice way of saying PlayStation first.
6659000	6665000	But, I mean, maybe PlayStation first, but then maybe by the time they get to Episode 2 and 3,
6665000	6670000	and this game gets its own inevitable steelbook edition that has everything in it, because you all know that's how this ends.
6670000	6674000	Maybe that's the one that'll turn out on Xbox One. We'll see.
6674000	6677000	Anyway, Dark Sakura, what do you have for us for Rapid Fire?
6677000	6687000	So, for people who are waiting for Psychonauts 2, it has been delayed until 2020 to come out on PC and consoles,
6687000	6697000	and it will actually be published by Microsoft as a first-party title, though it is still going to be coming out on the PS4.
6697000	6704000	So there's apologies around, but it's what they're doing to get it out, so it is what it is, right?
6704000	6713000	So, in other news, and this is something that harkens back, harkens back to another thing.
6713000	6721000	It was a classic game that I talked about that was by Sunsoft that came out as Journey to Silius. I talked about the music in it.
6721000	6724000	Yeah, I was going to say, to be fair, it was classic soundtrack, but yes.
6724000	6728000	Soundtrack, yeah. But it was supposed to have been a Terminator game.
6728000	6738000	Well, there is a promo video that was acquired by Gaming Alexandria that Sunsoft made to promote the game at Winter CES 1989.
6738000	6749000	So, basically, they lost the license for the game, and then, well, basically, they lost the license after they abandoned the movie plot.
6749000	6756000	So, it's just completely, you know, they completely fucked it up, so they lost their license.
6756000	6767000	At any rate, though, there also were, it looks like apart from the video that, yeah, some people saw some sprite sheets for it, too.
6767000	6773000	But really, it's the video that's the big one, and if anyone wants to watch the video who's in chat, I'll happily post a link to it.
6773000	6775000	Just don't watch it right now.
6775000	6780000	Yeah. There's other things going on right now, yes. I got you. All right, pretty cool.
6780000	6785000	All right, it's always fun when we talk about a classic game, and then it's, like, in the news that week or a later week.
6785000	6789000	It's kind of fun how that all kind of circles back around at some point, so.
6789000	6798000	All right, well, moving on. Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and what is coming out in a game store near you this week.
6798000	6799000	Loki, starting with us.
6799000	6807000	Not much, but there is one game, and it's pretty good. So, on the Nintendo Switch, Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3, the Black Order.
6808000	6810000	Oh, yeah. Yeah, some people are going to be interested in that.
6810000	6814000	Yeah, some people. I am one of those people. I wish it was on more systems.
6814000	6820000	Gotcha. Well, traveling over to Japan, last week was kind of a slow week. I feel like it's picking up a little bit more this week.
6820000	6828000	On July 18th, we get Pro Yakyuu's Spirits is coming out. It's a baseball game. Professional baseball spirits would be the way it translates in English.
6828000	6830000	That is coming out this week in Japan.
6830000	6832000	What? It doesn't have the little bobblehead, guys.
6833000	6841000	It's very photorealistic, this one. So, yeah, and it actually says they captured the faces of the players from photographing, and 3D data was used to make the models.
6841000	6843000	It looks really realistic.
6843000	6848000	But it used to be not realistic. This is the same Konami game.
6848000	6854000	I think there's pro, and there's not pro. I think it's the difference. But anyway.
6854000	6856000	And baseball in Japan?
6856000	6857000	Oh, sure.
6857000	6858000	Fairly religious.
6858000	6862000	Big deal. So, pretty cool that that's on its way out, and I'm sure some people will be into that.
6862000	6866000	And that's a game that you're not going to ever see released here, because it is Japanese baseball.
6866000	6871000	And I'm sure even though there might be some fans of that here, it's just not enough to justify the cost of releasing the game here.
6871000	6874000	So some of you may import that on your region-free devices.
6874000	6878000	Some other games out this week. Kingdom Come Deliverance in Japan this week.
6878000	6880000	Also, Judgment gets a price reduction.
6880000	6885000	And The Sims 4 moves into Best Hits and gets a price reduction in Japan this week.
6885000	6889000	Also, a game called Lotus Labyrinth is coming out this week on the PlayStation 4.
6889000	6892000	Checking out the Nintendo Switch real quick.
6892000	6896000	We don't have that same baseball game, but we do have Lotus Labyrinth is also out there.
6896000	6901000	As well as a game called Sumikko Gurashi, School Life Begins.
6901000	6905000	Oh, I buy those notebooks with the little kappa character on it.
6905000	6910000	I think one of the Senex things, or like the Senex things.
6910000	6914000	Oh yeah, the little chibi little penguin and fluffy things.
6914000	6917000	There's like a kappa who has a cucumber and everything.
6917000	6920000	Yep, yep, that's it. He's there in the back of the box.
6920000	6922000	I have a bunch of those notebooks that I use at work.
6922000	6923000	Oh, cute.
6923000	6925000	I get them at Ichiban-kan.
6925000	6930000	Yeah, this says they might be able to settle down when they're in the corners, but they don't like being in the center of the room.
6930000	6933000	Can relate.
6933000	6934000	Alright.
6934000	6936000	Hashtag mood.
6936000	6938000	Let's go over to the UK, Darsakura.
6938000	6943000	We have FIIA European Truck Racing Championship on July 27th.
6943000	6946000	The following games are on the 18th.
6946000	6949000	We have Redeemer Enhanced Edition.
6949000	6953000	We have Cities Skyline Nintendo Switch Edition.
6953000	6957000	We have Kingdom Come Deliverance Royal Collectors Edition.
6957000	6962000	And then, last but not least, Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3 for Switch.
6962000	6964000	Which a lot of people are going to be excited about.
6964000	6968000	Was this Comic-Con weekend? I'm surprised we didn't see a lot come out of those panels yet.
6968000	6970000	Unless people are just like, oh my god.
6970000	6975000	Or maybe it just wasn't a lot of, or I guess I forgot to see if there was anything really big that came out of that.
6975000	6976000	People are still losing their shit.
6976000	6979000	Will you check some of the big headline sites to see if we missed anything from Comic-Con?
6979000	6981000	Just want to make sure we covered all the bases there.
6981000	6983000	So, as far as, I don't care about the movies.
6983000	6989000	I care more about the, because Marvel was going to have a panel and the Avengers game was supposed to show up there too.
6989000	6992000	And I remember it wasn't so well received in E3.
6992000	6999000	Yeah, and from what I hear, they did show gameplay and that gameplay is not going to come out.
6999000	7000000	What?
7000000	7003000	Like they're not going to release the gameplay video out to everyone.
7003000	7006000	Oh, it was one of the in the hall only. Got it, got it. Alright.
7006000	7009000	Well, let's move on. We're going to go to the mailbag.
7009000	7012000	Every week we invite your emails that participate at Orangelaunchradio.com.
7012000	7016000	And we read some of our favorite emails on the show, or in some cases we do.
7016000	7020000	And Comic-Con's not until, San Diego Comic-Con's not until this coming week.
7020000	7023000	Oh, it's the coming week. Okay. Sorry, I thought we missed it.
7023000	7026000	No, but I hear though that the footage they're going to show, they're not going to...
7026000	7030000	Okay, so you got to be there to see it. Okay. Sorry.
7030000	7032000	Yes, DarkSakura, one email this week.
7032000	7035000	Hello, Alar. Hi, YYR.
7035000	7040000	I just wanted to take a quick moment to clarify something I mentioned on last week's episode.
7040000	7044000	The Justifier light guns available on Genesis were not a Sega product at all.
7044000	7046000	They were made by Konami.
7046000	7051000	The light guns were specifically created for use with the home versions of Lethal Enforcers games.
7051000	7056000	And if you like your gameplay sanitized, you can get a Justifier for use with the stripe of Nintendo also.
7056000	7060000	Well, that's it. Thanks for bringing us another great show. Yay.
7060000	7062000	Warm regards, Aaron YYR.
7062000	7068000	Which I think is absolutely funny that the confidentiality statement at the end of this is longer than the email.
7068000	7070000	Good job.
7070000	7072000	That's how it goes.
7072000	7076000	Well, you know what, YYR, thank you for another good, I guess, fact checking.
7076000	7077000	Observation.
7077000	7079000	Yeah, observation. I like that.
7079000	7081000	Thank you for your clarification.
7081000	7083000	There you go.
7083000	7086000	Alright, well, there's nothing for us to respond to in that, however.
7086000	7088000	It's just, uh, no.
7088000	7090000	Drag Race talk!
7090000	7092000	No, there's no Drag Race on now anyway.
7092000	7094000	Drag Race Canada's coming on.
7094000	7096000	I guess you could talk about Dragula.
7096000	7097000	Dragula?
7097000	7101000	Having been to one of the Boulay Brothers events, though, that's a pretty stellar show.
7101000	7104000	But we got an email, so no tangent this week.
7104000	7106000	Ruining my fun. Eat a cookie.
7106000	7108000	After the show. I'll have a cookie in a little bit.
7108000	7110000	Tell everyone what my cookies are like.
7110000	7111000	They're good.
7111000	7113000	All my cookies are good.
7113000	7116000	My cookies bring more carbs to my tummy.
7116000	7119000	Alright, moving on, we got some more gaming stories for you guys,
7119000	7121000	and then we're gonna get to our Discord calls,
7121000	7123000	as well as if you have any chat questions.
7123000	7125000	Let's get to it. Loki.
7125000	7132000	So Ubisoft, of course, released their story creator tool for Assassin's Creed Odyssey
7132000	7137000	that lots of people have been creating their own custom quests and stuff,
7137000	7140000	but of course, like most things, when you put out a tool
7140000	7144000	that allows you to create custom things or mods for a game,
7144000	7149000	you're gonna have people using it to exploit easy XP boosting.
7149000	7153000	And so now they've decided to say that...
7153000	7155000	Here's what Ubisoft says.
7155000	7159000	These exploits risk jeopardizing the overall quality and integrity and purpose
7159000	7163000	of the story creator mode and results in less visibility for the creative,
7163000	7167000	interesting, and frankly fantastic community stories that have been published.
7167000	7169000	That's what they say.
7169000	7173000	But here's one thing you have to understand about Assassin's Creed Odyssey.
7173000	7177000	They sell XP boosts in their storefront.
7177000	7182000	That's why they're mad that people are making free XP boost quests,
7182000	7184000	because they want to sell them to you,
7184000	7189000	and it is in fact jeopardizing the overall quality and integrity
7190000	7196000	and purpose of their in-game storefront, is really what it comes down to.
7196000	7199000	Questbuster in chat really puts this succinctly, saying,
7199000	7203000	I love Odyssey, but the XP grind scaling is so trash.
7203000	7206000	If it wasn't a problem, people wouldn't want to find ways around it.
7206000	7210000	Yeah, it's nice to create a problem that you can then also create the solution for
7210000	7212000	and then charge for that solution.
7212000	7214000	Yep, that's how it works.
7214000	7218000	So yeah, just don't do it or you'll get banned.
7218000	7224000	And then of course, along with banning people for using the story creator,
7224000	7229000	there have been people that have been getting banned in Rainbow Six Siege,
7229000	7238000	because apparently people have been filling up game chat windows with random symbols,
7238000	7246000	and this has caused lag and apparently causes people to disconnect with this kind of exploit.
7246000	7254000	So you'll get banned for that now, and apparently they're deploying a fix for the chat symbol exploit.
7254000	7256000	But yeah, their games are all broken.
7256000	7259000	And don't do stuff that they don't like, otherwise they'll ban you.
7261000	7265000	Yeah, that's right. Don't try to cheat their storefronts, or you're going to get banned.
7265000	7267000	You be banned. You be banned!
7269000	7271000	Alright, moving on.
7271000	7274000	We got news about a new Turok game,
7274000	7277000	but it probably isn't the type of Turok game you're thinking about.
7277000	7279000	You're probably thinking about the old school Turok games.
7279000	7281000	N64 was the first one, right?
7281000	7282000	Yeah.
7282000	7284000	Yeah, this isn't quite the same thing.
7284000	7288000	It's just kind of rooted in some of the same stories that inspired the older games.
7288000	7289000	So here's the deal.
7289000	7292000	It's a new game coming out on Steam on July 25th.
7292000	7297000	It's called Turok Escape from Lost Valley, and it's a little more cartoony.
7297000	7301000	It's also isometric 3D. It's not first person dinosaur hunting.
7302000	7307000	It's still kind of the similar sort of concept where Turok and the brother Andar
7307000	7310000	are in a valley full of dinosaurs, and you hunt the dinosaurs,
7310000	7312000	and it just looks a little bit cuter.
7312000	7313000	It's super cute.
7313000	7314000	Yeah, it is super cute.
7314000	7317000	Now, even though you might be like,
7317000	7319000	they're making a new Turok game, I had no idea.
7319000	7322000	This actually was a finalist in the Universal Game Dev Challenge
7322000	7325000	that was during the 2018 Game Developers Conference.
7325000	7328000	And they took these small teams of Unity developers,
7328000	7334000	brought them together, and challenged them to make games about Universal-owned properties.
7334000	7337000	So that's why Turok was there.
7337000	7340000	Thank goodness we got a Turok game and not a Minions game.
7340000	7341000	Right.
7341000	7345000	Well, it should be noted that the ultimate grand prize went to a strategy game
7345000	7351000	called Voltron, Cubes of Volcarion, which is also coming to Steam on July 25th.
7351000	7352000	So, how about that?
7352000	7353000	Voltron game.
7353000	7354000	Yeah.
7354000	7355000	Cool.
7355000	7356000	Yeah, pretty cool.
7356000	7359000	Maybe if Turok isn't up your alley, maybe Voltron Cubes will be.
7359000	7361000	I know Voltron was pretty cool.
7361000	7363000	Anyway, some other just notes about this.
7363000	7369000	The character design from this goes all the way back to the 1954 roots of Turok
7369000	7372000	in Escape from Lost Valley in some of the earliest comics
7372000	7376000	that were originally published by Western Publishing, Dell and Gold Key.
7376000	7378000	So, that's pretty cool.
7378000	7380000	Yeah, just a very different type of Turok game,
7380000	7382000	but you have to remember Turok is a bigger property
7382000	7385000	than what you might remember from the Nintendo 64.
7385000	7388000	And then SGL 100 Matt is linking some articles in chat
7388000	7392000	where you can actually see screenshots and so forth.
7392000	7394000	Though I wish he'd use a better website.
7394000	7398000	But you can look him up on YouTube and stuff too as well.
7398000	7399000	All right, let's move on.
7399000	7400000	Dark Sakura, what do you have for us?
7400000	7404000	You have another kind of like gaming science type of thing, right?
7404000	7407000	Yes, because I love gaming and science.
7407000	7413000	So, basically, there was another study that was published,
7413000	7417000	and this was this time by the Creative Research Journal,
7417000	7420000	in the Creativity Research Journal,
7420000	7424000	where researchers analyzed 352 participants
7424000	7429000	to compare the effects of playing Minecraft with or without instruction
7429000	7433000	to watching a TV show or playing a race car video game.
7433000	7436000	So, after 40 minutes of play or watching TV,
7436000	7441000	the participants were supposed to create different creativity tasks.
7441000	7443000	To measure the production, they were asked to draw a creature
7443000	7445000	from a world much different than Earth.
7445000	7448000	More human-like creatures scored low for creativity,
7448000	7451000	and those less human scored high.
7451000	7456000	So, it was found that those who had full freedom to do Minecraft
7456000	7462000	on their own, without instructions, they were the least creative.
7462000	7468000	So, basically, let me start over.
7468000	7469000	I take that back.
7469000	7470000	They were the most creative.
7470000	7476000	Well, those who were instructed how to play Minecraft were least creative.
7476000	7477000	Oh, okay.
7477000	7478000	Sorry.
7478000	7480000	So, like if you were able to be more sandboxy,
7480000	7482000	then that's going to lead to, okay, I get that.
7482000	7484000	I get logically I understand why that would happen.
7484000	7485000	Okay.
7485000	7489000	So, basically, it's when you have like an open world,
7489000	7492000	instruction-less sort of thing,
7492000	7496000	is that it really does boost your own problem solving skills,
7496000	7499000	as well as your ability to think around a certain thing.
7499000	7501000	So, there you go.
7501000	7503000	Let your kids play Minecraft.
7503000	7504000	Just don't let them download anything.
7504000	7505000	Shit.
7505000	7506000	I was going to say,
7506000	7509000	if they were going to make different space aliens and things like that,
7509000	7511000	I'm surprised you don't play something like No Man's Sky.
7511000	7515000	You see all sorts of different types of what aliens would look like
7515000	7518000	in that type of game that are not necessarily human.
7518000	7519000	I mean, there's some humanoid creatures,
7519000	7523000	but there's a lot of space flying things and all that.
7523000	7526000	So, maybe No Man's Sky isn't really a kid's game.
7526000	7527000	I don't know.
7527000	7532000	Or maybe Spore, where there's lots of creatures that all look like dicks.
7532000	7533000	That takes me back.
7533000	7535000	Man, you know what?
7535000	7538000	As much as people rag on the way Spore came out,
7538000	7543000	Spore will always be the reason why I got to sit in the same room
7543000	7545000	as Will Wright showing off his game.
7545000	7550000	And when you talk about when you look back on 17 years of the show,
7550000	7553000	and even though, okay, we're not the most famous podcast out there,
7553000	7555000	we never had our viral moment,
7555000	7558000	we don't make buku bucks doing this show.
7558000	7562000	We did for a brief moment, and then everyone immediately forgot who we were.
7562000	7564000	Well, I don't even think for the brief moment.
7564000	7565000	It didn't really last long.
7565000	7569000	But I will say that one of the things that this show has been able to bring me
7569000	7570000	was that experience.
7570000	7573000	I got to sit in the same room with Will Wright as he played his game,
7573000	7574000	even if it was Spore.
7574000	7575000	Whatever.
7575000	7578000	I think Spore got shit on a little more than it needed.
7578000	7581000	The problem with Spore is that it was just mini-games
7581000	7583000	brought together in a weird sort of way.
7583000	7586000	But I don't think it was as bad as people made it out to be either.
7587000	7590000	It was really kind of like something I would think that would do well
7590000	7592000	on cell phones now.
7592000	7594000	Oh, God, I gave you ideas.
7595000	7596000	Yeah, I wouldn't do that.
7596000	7597000	All right.
7597000	7600000	Moving on, a couple more stories before we open up Discord.
7600000	7601000	So if you want to get in,
7601000	7603000	if you have something you want to talk about tonight on Discord,
7603000	7607000	you can make your way to the green room over at the VOG Network Discord server,
7607000	7611000	which all the information is down below on our Twitch page,
7611000	7614000	or you can just ask in chat if you're having any problems.
7614000	7618000	But vognetwork.com slash Discord is the place to be.
7618000	7624000	So apparently there's this new section in Steam called Steam Labs,
7624000	7628000	which has a bunch of new experimental things that they're doing to Steam
7628000	7630000	to kind of make it a little bit better.
7630000	7634000	So one of the things that they're experimenting with is micro-trailers.
7634000	7637000	So that's six-second trailers that are on every single game.
7637000	7643000	They have an automated daily half-hour show about games
7643000	7646000	and an interactive recommender.
7646000	7652000	So one of these things, the automated or the interactive recommending thing,
7652000	7658000	is like it's supposed to work off of the games that you play
7658000	7659000	in your playing time history,
7659000	7663000	and it's going to use that to recommend new games
7663000	7666000	based on what other people have played as well.
7666000	7667000	So that's kind of neat.
7667000	7669000	Yeah, but the algorithm part of the Steam store is,
7669000	7673000	I think, when the Steam store started losing all of its character,
7673000	7674000	and it's just kind of so...
7674000	7676000	The Steam store isn't great.
7676000	7677000	Well, they have to...
7677000	7679000	If I don't go in there knowing what I'm going to get...
7679000	7683000	They're trying to make ways that they don't have to do the curation themselves,
7683000	7686000	and fortunately that didn't work out well for YouTube,
7686000	7688000	and it's not working out well for them either.
7688000	7689000	Everybody forgets.
7689000	7692000	Steam has a Twitch competitor built into it,
7692000	7693000	but literally nobody...
7693000	7695000	Well, I shouldn't say literally nobody's using it,
7695000	7698000	but nobody I know is talking about it.
7698000	7702000	Nobody I know is out there promoting their Steam streaming.
7702000	7705000	It's all Twitch or YouTube,
7705000	7708000	and shit, I see people promoting Mixer as well.
7708000	7710000	So those are the ones I actually see promoted.
7710000	7714000	I don't see anybody trying to build their Steam channel presence.
7714000	7717000	I even think I saw a Facebook gamer the other day
7717000	7719000	that was streaming on Facebook.
7719000	7720000	I even saw that.
7720000	7722000	I don't see Steam.
7722000	7723000	Yeah.
7723000	7725000	But the six-second trailers?
7725000	7728000	That's a good idea.
7728000	7730000	That's about the attention span people have for that.
7730000	7731000	The micro...
7731000	7732000	They're saying, though...
7732000	7734000	The other thing that's kind of weird, though,
7734000	7738000	is apparently that those mini...
7738000	7741000	The 30...
7741000	7743000	The little game shows,
7743000	7746000	the daily half-hour shows about games,
7746000	7749000	I guess a lot of it's in text-to-speech or whatever.
7750000	7753000	I don't know. It's just weird.
7753000	7755000	I'm just curious.
7755000	7758000	I haven't actually signed into this to opt in,
7758000	7760000	but I'm curious to see what it would recommend.
7760000	7762000	It'd probably recommend that I start playing this
7762000	7764000	in my fucking backlog is what it would recommend.
7764000	7767000	I think you probably should stop buying games
7767000	7770000	and start playing the 500 to 600 that you have.
7770000	7772000	Do you even know what half of these are?
7772000	7775000	Yeah. It should show you six-second trailers
7775000	7778000	for games you already own but haven't funded yet.
7778000	7780000	Already own but haven't fucking touched.
7780000	7782000	That's what the Steam thing should do.
7782000	7783000	It's like, listen...
7783000	7784000	Look at what you're missing out on this week.
7784000	7785000	They did have that event.
7785000	7786000	They're all like,
7786000	7788000	Dude, fucking go play your games that you have.
7788000	7791000	I just haven't gotten around to it.
7791000	7792000	Maybe I will.
7792000	7794000	I thought about one time,
7794000	7798000	I should just film myself playing a new game in my library
7798000	7799000	every single...
7799000	7800000	Well, maybe not every day,
7800000	7801000	because that's a little much,
7801000	7803000	but I probably could do every day.
7803000	7806000	It'd take a few years to go through.
7806000	7808000	All right, well, one more story for you guys tonight.
7808000	7810000	And this is one of those things that,
7810000	7812000	even though I think in some ways
7812000	7813000	I felt it was just a matter of time,
7813000	7814000	it's like one of those,
7814000	7816000	like, wow, it's really gonna be happening.
7816000	7819000	And that is that a new Netflix series is coming
7819000	7821000	based on the video game Cuphead.
7821000	7822000	Yay!
7822000	7823000	That's right.
7823000	7825000	The Cuphead show is going to be starring Cuphead
7825000	7828000	and Mugman, or Player 2, if you will,
7828000	7830000	and their adventures on Inkwell Isle.
7830000	7832000	But we don't know much more.
7832000	7834000	All we know is that in an interview with IGN,
7834000	7837000	the game creators, Chad and Jared Moldenhauer,
7837000	7839000	said it's not a little kids cartoon,
7839000	7843000	and it will be the same kind of vibe that the game hints at.
7843000	7846000	So maybe it'll be a little more like of an adult cartoon.
7846000	7847000	But I also think those kind of,
7847000	7849000	like, the cartoons that work best,
7849000	7851000	why do so many people look back on things like Tiny Toons
7851000	7853000	and Animaniacs and think that those,
7853000	7855000	like, those are, like, some of the best?
7855000	7858000	Because it was humor that, like, was suitable for kids,
7858000	7861000	but, like, adults would find the deeper level humor in it,
7861000	7862000	right?
7862000	7864000	Hello, nurse, right?
7864000	7867000	You know, there's things in it that adults would find even funnier.
7867000	7870000	So, anyway, what's also interesting about this,
7870000	7873000	it is being animated in-house by Netflix,
7873000	7875000	but one of the producers on this, not just Netflix,
7875000	7877000	King Features Syndicate.
7877000	7881000	They're like the folks that hold, like, the licenses for Betty Boop,
7881000	7883000	Popeye, like, classics.
7883000	7887000	So this is, uh, it's so interesting how this has come full circle
7887000	7890000	because Cuphead is arguably inspired by those type of cartoons in the past,
7890000	7893000	and now we're getting an actual Cuphead show.
7893000	7898000	And, um, also goes to show just how many frickin',
7898000	7901000	like, video games are becoming Netflix things.
7901000	7903000	Like, we know The Witcher's on the way, right?
7903000	7906000	We just had a story not that long ago about Final Fantasy XIV.
7906000	7910000	Uh, The Division, if it's not a Netflix thing, it's a Hulu thing.
7910000	7911000	It's one of those, right?
7911000	7912000	No, The Vision's Netflix.
7912000	7914000	The Vision, okay, The Division's a Netflix thing.
7914000	7915000	I thought there was one that was Hulu.
7915000	7917000	What about The Doom, The Doom, uh, Creation?
7917000	7918000	No, that was a USA Network.
7918000	7919000	That wasn't a...
7919000	7920000	Yeah, that's USA.
7920000	7921000	...streaming service.
7921000	7923000	But still, it's, it's kinda interesting just, like,
7923000	7924000	how many video games are going over.
7924000	7926000	But the other interesting thing about Netflix,
7926000	7929000	Netflix is kind of in a position where they have to,
7929000	7931000	to really start creating their own stuff.
7931000	7932000	Why?
7932000	7935000	Because everybody else is pulling their shit off the service
7935000	7937000	and taking it to their own streaming platform.
7937000	7940000	Hence why Netflix is gonna lose friends in the office
7940000	7942000	in about another year and a half
7942000	7944000	because Comcast NBC wants to do their own thing.
7944000	7947000	Yeah, but I've only watched The Office,
7947000	7949000	like, the entire series, like, five times.
7949000	7951000	So I think I'm, I think I'm good.
7951000	7953000	You think you got it all out of your system at this point.
7953000	7954000	I think I'm good.
7954000	7956000	And The Friends, like, two or three times.
7956000	7959000	But you know, you know those are two of the most streamed shows on Netflix.
7959000	7963000	I get it, but, like, are people really gonna pay extra money to, like, no.
7963000	7966000	I, I think the bubble's gonna burst on some of that,
7966000	7968000	and if those services don't think about consolidating,
7968000	7970000	they're just gonna kill each other off.
7970000	7971000	And I think it's gonna bring back piracy.
7971000	7972000	It is.
7972000	7973000	Honestly, yeah.
7973000	7976000	I think that's already happening with Star Trek Discovery.
7976000	7978000	People don't want to get CBS All Access for it,
7978000	7980000	so they pirate it off international Netflix or whatever.
7980000	7982000	So I think, I think it's already happening.
7982000	7983000	VPNs.
7983000	7984000	Yeah.
7984000	7985000	Anyway.
7985000	7986000	Yeah, YYR in chat says,
7986000	7988000	Get ready for the dark ages of streaming.
7988000	7989000	And Kaijuto says,
7989000	7991000	Never watched Friends or The Office.
7991000	7992000	And SSJ100Matt says,
7992000	7994000	It all hinges on Disney Plus.
7994000	7995000	Let's not kid ourselves.
7995000	7997000	Disney Plus is going to do very, they're all,
7997000	7998000	Yeah.
7998000	8001000	just by putting the movies on a streaming service.
8001000	8004000	It's, like, instant babysitter for children.
8004000	8007000	Star Wars, Disney, and Marvel.
8007000	8008000	Yeah.
8008000	8010000	Disney Plus stands to do very well, and that's what probably,
8010000	8013000	I just hope they have a package that bundles in Hulu,
8013000	8016000	because, you know, since they're gonna be owning that as well,
8016000	8019000	I'm, it would be nice to be able to have both services.
8019000	8020000	Oh, my bad.
8020000	8021000	DGRMS says,
8021000	8024000	Friends isn't going to NBCU streaming service.
8024000	8026000	It's going to HBO Max streaming.
8026000	8029000	But I thought, I thought it was the other way around.
8029000	8032000	Like, NBC's new streaming thing included HBO.
8032000	8034000	But I guess maybe it is called HBO Max.
8034000	8035000	I can't, see, this is the problem.
8035000	8039000	Like, it's too many, you're spreading it across too many different platforms,
8039000	8042000	and it's just, if it's not going to be easy,
8042000	8044000	it's easier to go download it.
8044000	8045000	Right.
8045000	8046000	Right.
8046000	8047000	Or just not watch it.
8047000	8048000	Just like, you know what?
8048000	8049000	I fucking watch Friends enough.
8049000	8051000	Yeah, or if you really, like,
8051000	8054000	I hate to suggest this, but as long as, like,
8054000	8056000	the basic Netflix for whatever you're paying, like,
8056000	8057000	$14 a month is still strong,
8057000	8060000	they could probably get away with, like, what cable does,
8060000	8062000	and say, if you want to add Friends in the office,
8062000	8064000	you have to pay an extra $2 a month or something,
8064000	8066000	or this suite of NBC shows.
8066000	8067000	I don't know.
8067000	8068000	But again, I don't,
8068000	8070000	is that really any better than a separate streaming service?
8070000	8071000	I don't know.
8071000	8074000	But that's kind of what traditional cable does with HBO and Showtime
8074000	8076000	and those types of things, right?
8076000	8078000	So, anyway.
8078000	8079000	Ah, okay.
8079000	8080000	DGRMS says,
8080000	8083000	Friends was produced by Warner Brothers.
8083000	8085000	AT&T owns Warner Brothers.
8085000	8088000	They're the one putting out the new HBO streaming service.
8088000	8089000	Thank you.
8089000	8090000	It's an AT&T thing.
8090000	8091000	That I do remember reading.
8091000	8095000	So, now AT&T wants to get in on this.
8095000	8096000	Come on.
8096000	8097000	Too many.
8097000	8099000	Too many streaming services.
8099000	8101000	All right.
8101000	8103000	And Bobby Blackwell says,
8103000	8104000	I just don't watch Discovery.
8104000	8106000	If I'm not willing to get it legally, I just go without.
8106000	8109000	I don't believe I'm entitled to TV shows.
8109000	8111000	But it is interesting because, I mean,
8111000	8112000	so many TV shows are over the air.
8112000	8115000	I think many of us have kind of grew up with that entitlement
8115000	8116000	in a weird way.
8116000	8117000	I get what you're saying.
8117000	8118000	Don't get me wrong.
8118000	8120000	I just think it is interesting when we talk about specifically
8120000	8123000	television because, you know, since we were kids,
8123000	8125000	you could get a lot of that for free.
8125000	8127000	But anyway, I digress.
8127000	8129000	I'm just in the same boat where it's like,
8129000	8132000	if I don't, I don't really pirate TV shows because I just,
8132000	8135000	there's plenty that I can watch.
8135000	8138000	And Netflix does still have a lot of good stuff.
8138000	8139000	But the other services do too.
8139000	8142000	If I had Hulu, I'd probably be watching The Handmaid's Tale.
8142000	8145000	Even though apparently this new season is pissing everybody off.
8145000	8146000	But that's all I know.
8146000	8147000	I don't know what the details are.
8147000	8148000	I flat out refuse to watch that.
8148000	8149000	I've watched it.
8149000	8152000	I've heard it's like too scary and not in a...
8152000	8154000	I started reading the book and put it down.
8154000	8156000	Yeah. So.
8156000	8159000	I don't know if it's like too scary, but...
8159000	8163000	It's not, not scary like, like thriller slasher scary,
8163000	8164000	but too scary.
8164000	8167000	Like this hits too close to home right now.
8167000	8170000	Like I could see this happening and I don't like it.
8170000	8172000	And yeah, I, I get that.
8172000	8174000	So, all right.
8174000	8177000	All right. Anyhow, we've digressed enough.
8177000	8180000	I think it's time to get into the listener round table via chat,
8180000	8184000	as well as our Discord server over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.
8184000	8188000	While we're waiting to see if anybody wants to call by joining our green room,
8188000	8190000	we would welcome any last minute stories.
8190000	8193000	While I wait to see if there's any of those,
8193000	8197000	I would also open it up to our Twitch chat room over at twitch.tv slash vognetwork.
8197000	8201000	If you have anything you wanted to ask us tonight to talk about
8201000	8202000	or anything like that.
8202000	8206000	So, meanwhile, do we have any last minute things that are coming in?
8206000	8208000	Uh, no.
8208000	8209000	Not really.
8209000	8211000	Unfortunately, one thing I was going to mention,
8211000	8215000	because I have been reading a lot of different reviews for Astral Chain.
8215000	8218000	I think, was it Astral Chain? No, it wasn't Astral Chain.
8218000	8223000	It was the game that was supposed to be like Actraiser that Sega put out.
8223000	8224000	Oh, yeah.
8224000	8225000	I hear it's not good.
8225000	8226000	Oh, that's a bummer.
8226000	8227000	Yeah.
8227000	8228000	So, there it is.
8228000	8229000	I didn't realize it was already out.
8229000	8230000	Yeah, I think it already came out.
8230000	8231000	Oh, shoot.
8231000	8236000	But Blazing Chrome, the game that's like Contra, very good.
8236000	8238000	But that is if you believe internet people.
8238000	8239000	Yes.
8239000	8240000	Okay.
8240000	8243000	But I believe the internet videos that I've watched of Blazing Chrome,
8243000	8244000	it's very good.
8244000	8248000	It's very 16-bit Contra, and I need that in my life.
8248000	8251000	Question for Metal Mayhem in our chat room for those in studios.
8251000	8256000	Did you folks make use of the recent Steam summer sale?
8256000	8257000	A big no.
8257000	8258000	No.
8258000	8262000	I know for me, honestly, just with, well, I've had a lot.
8262000	8264000	Obviously, you guys know my mind's been going a million different directions
8264000	8265000	when it's been coming to gaming.
8265000	8267000	And I think just because when I am gaming,
8267000	8272000	I'm so into Final Fantasy XIV and like Mario Maker 2 and the stuff I already have.
8272000	8275000	I think I was really able to successfully put my foot down and be like,
8275000	8278000	I don't need to buy any new games right now just for the sake of owning games.
8278000	8279000	I'm not going to play.
8279000	8284000	Like, I think I finally was able to do that here in the year of our Lord 2019.
8284000	8287000	Finally able to resist a Steam sale.
8287000	8291000	I bought something, but I don't remember what it was that I bought.
8291000	8296000	In fact, I'm going to check now because I remember paying for something,
8296000	8300000	but I don't remember what it was that I paid for.
8300000	8303000	You know what I think it was?
8303000	8306000	It may have been Moshpit Simulator.
8306000	8309000	It may have been Moshpit Simulator.
8309000	8312000	I don't remember.
8312000	8313000	Hmm.
8313000	8314000	All right.
8314000	8315000	I'm going to go to another question.
8315000	8316000	If you think of it, great.
8316000	8320000	As Joe and Hunter Matt says, since Twitch is an Amazon company,
8320000	8322000	this is on people's minds today,
8322000	8326000	what are you hoping to get gaming-wise or in general on Prime Day?
8326000	8330000	Anybody going to be participating in the Prime Day shenanigans?
8330000	8331000	Just for the pre-order.
8331000	8337000	The TurboGrafx mini that was early spoken of I think is enough right there.
8337000	8343000	I do really want to get a 4K television, but...
8343000	8344000	I did last year.
8344000	8347000	I have other financial stuff going on right now.
8347000	8350000	We just paid off a big dental thing,
8350000	8356000	so I just feel like it's not a very adult idea to buy the 4K TV now,
8356000	8360000	but maybe that will be a November, December holiday thing
8360000	8364000	I treat myself and Alan to as a 4K TV.
8364000	8367000	But yeah, I think otherwise...
8367000	8368000	Because I just bought...
8368000	8372000	That TV is not that old, but it's like the price of...
8372000	8374000	When I bought that TV, it was almost...
8374000	8377000	I feel like that TV was almost $1200 or something like that.
8377000	8379000	I spent a lot of money on that TV.
8379000	8380000	You can get 4K TV much cheaper.
8380000	8383000	I know, now you can get 4K TVs that size for like $500.
8383000	8384000	Crazy.
8384000	8387000	So that's why I'm kind of like, well, I guess it's time...
8387000	8389000	Which means that TV, if it even fit, would move in here.
8389000	8391000	We'd have this giant fucking television in here.
8391000	8393000	And it was Moshpit Simulator.
8393000	8394000	Okay, thank you.
8394000	8395000	We're all dying to know.
8395000	8399000	Yes, and for those who are unaware of what Moshpit Simulator is,
8399000	8406000	it is a physics simulator with a lot of these like really bouncy around naked dudes for some reason.
8406000	8407000	But it's a VR game.
8407000	8408000	It's really fucking weird.
8408000	8409000	It's like...
8409000	8414000	If you can imagine like a VR version of Garry's Mod, I guess,
8414000	8415000	but with like a lot of...
8415000	8420000	It's just fucking a weird game that I really need to play on the stream.
8420000	8422000	Oh, Esther Jones under Matt says,
8422000	8424000	I'm hoping to get a new PC gaming headset.
8424000	8426000	You know what I should be looking for if I can find a good deal?
8426000	8428000	A new mechanical keyboard.
8428000	8432000	Because my current one, I spilled something on it like a dummy and now it's all fucked up.
8432000	8434000	And then I keep looking at Alan's.
8434000	8435000	Alan's keyboard is nicer than mine.
8435000	8436000	I want a new mechanical keyboard.
8436000	8437000	So maybe that...
8437000	8441000	If I can find a really good deal on one of those, I might be talked into it.
8441000	8442000	So we'll see.
8443000	8445000	Anything else on Prime Day?
8445000	8446000	Things you gotta have?
8446000	8447000	I'll be curious.
8447000	8451000	You know, Twitch is doing this whole thing for Prime Day.
8451000	8452000	So I'll be very curious.
8452000	8454000	I'll probably be watching some of that.
8454000	8456000	They're really pushing people to co-stream it.
8456000	8459000	Because of course, you know, they want people to know about the sales and stuff like that.
8459000	8463000	Which I sadly don't have the time to be participating in that.
8463000	8467000	But I'll be curious to see what other people are doing with it.
8467000	8470000	And how everybody tries to make coin off of Prime Day.
8470000	8472000	I'll be very curious about that.
8472000	8473000	So.
8473000	8474000	Dar2C in chat says,
8474000	8475000	I feel you.
8475000	8477000	I messed up my old wireless keyboard.
8477000	8479000	Had to hit up Goodwill for a replacement.
8479000	8480000	Yep.
8480000	8481000	Djurama S says,
8481000	8483000	Corsair is having some great sales on keyboards currently.
8483000	8485000	I'll have to look into that.
8485000	8486000	I really will.
8486000	8491000	It just so happens that like everything I have right now is Razer.
8491000	8494000	And it's not out of some brand loyalty or something like that.
8494000	8495000	It's just a weird coincidence.
8495000	8496000	But I'm open.
8496000	8499000	A good keyboard is a good keyboard at the end of the day, right?
8499000	8500000	So.
8500000	8501000	Alright.
8501000	8502000	Well.
8502000	8503000	I guess that's it.
8503000	8505000	Yeah, there's not really anything else.
8505000	8507000	Yeah, it was kind of a slower news week.
8507000	8509000	And I think we made the most of it though.
8509000	8510000	So there you go.
8510000	8513000	But we do invite you guys, of course, to always send us an email.
8513000	8517000	If there's something we didn't talk about on the show tonight that you want to send us an email for, you can do that.
8517000	8518000	Over at.
8518000	8519000	Oh, I was going to.
8519000	8523000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send your email.
8523000	8524000	Yes, your thought.
8524000	8526000	I was going to ask you if you had played the.
8526000	8528000	Because I haven't played it yet.
8528000	8530000	The Dr. Mario game that they put out in mobile.
8530000	8531000	Actually, yes, I did.
8531000	8532000	Just a little bit.
8532000	8533000	I haven't gotten past.
8533000	8535000	I think the tutorial is like the first 20 levels or something like that.
8535000	8537000	And I'm not even past that yet.
8537000	8538000	But I did download it.
8538000	8540000	And I'm tinkering with it.
8540000	8541000	We'll say that.
8541000	8543000	It's interesting because the pills go up, not down.
8543000	8544000	I thought that was interesting.
8544000	8547000	And it's not like it's not like the old Dr. Mario game.
8547000	8551000	I mean, the match for concept or whatever is like the old Dr. Mario game.
8551000	8554000	But it's it's different.
8554000	8558000	And I can also see where it's probably going to get annoying with the money asking later on and all that stuff.
8558000	8559000	All right. Yeah.
8559000	8563000	Fifth dream today in our chat says the Dr. Mario game is trash.
8563000	8565000	I haven't heard a lot of good things about it.
8565000	8566000	I thought it was pretty fun.
8566000	8567000	It's got the music in it.
8567000	8569000	Yeah, it was.
8569000	8570000	I thought was fun.
8570000	8573000	But it reminds me too much of that Sailor Moon game.
8573000	8576000	That puzzle Sailor Moon game.
8576000	8577000	Gotcha.
8577000	8578000	All right.
8578000	8579000	And some mixed reviews.
8579000	8581000	DJ Romas says it's pretty good for what it is.
8581000	8584000	So Sailor Moon drops is what you're trying to think of.
8584000	8586000	Also says DJ Romas.
8586000	8587000	All right.
8587000	8591000	Well, I think it's time to go around and get everybody's final thought and wrap up for the week.
8591000	8593000	So let's go around and get some final thoughts.
8593000	8595000	Dark Sakura, you want to start us off tonight?
8595000	8596000	Which final thought?
8596000	8597000	Oh, actually, sorry.
8597000	8599000	Before you do that, I should, as I always do, plug.
8599000	8603000	Thank you for listening to Orange Lawns Radio, be it on the podcast feed or live on Twitch.
8603000	8604000	We really appreciate the support.
8604000	8607000	And if you enjoyed what you heard here, please tell a friend about the show.
8607000	8610000	Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
8610000	8615000	But if the voices aren't here live, you know, we get we have an empty Discord.
8615000	8617000	So help us spread the word.
8617000	8620000	Also, auto hosts on Twitch goes so far.
8620000	8626000	Even if you're not like a streamer yourself, your friends still might follow you and be curious about the stuff you're hosting.
8626000	8629000	So auto hosts are the bomb dot com.
8629000	8630000	And that's a new thing I'm really trying to push.
8630000	8633000	So please consider VOG Network on your auto host list.
8633000	8635000	OK, now Dark Sakura, your final thought.
8635000	8643000	I'm a little worried about this link that Brad gave us in chat for getting the TurboGrafx-16 mini on U.S. Amazon.
8643000	8647000	Because it doesn't have anything on there, any alerts or anything.
8647000	8655000	Whereas on Konami's website, if you go in to find the TurboGrafx mini, it links you to the Japanese Amazon page.
8655000	8660000	Because it only has links to the U.K. and Italian pages. No links to the U.S. one.
8660000	8665000	So I'm wondering if it might be because it's already after midnight there.
8665000	8666000	Yeah, I think so.
8666000	8670000	And the link hasn't gone live. But even so, it's linked over to the Japanese site.
8670000	8673000	Only link. No matter which of those pages you're on.
8673000	8677000	I'll just try manually looking for it like two minutes after nine o'clock.
8677000	8678000	If they sell out.
8678000	8679000	No, it says midnight Pacific.
8679000	8681000	Oh, it's midnight Pacific. Oh, OK.
8681000	8682000	So that's when Prime Day starts.
8682000	8688000	If they're not up when I go there to load it in two minutes after the fact, then it just wasn't meant to be.
8688000	8691000	And I will deal with that fact for the rest of my life.
8691000	8693000	I don't think they're going to sell out.
8693000	8695000	I don't think so either. TurboGrafx doesn't have that.
8695000	8699000	To video game fans, like nerds, super nerds like us, yes.
8699000	8702000	But I just don't think they're going to have that same wide appeal.
8702000	8704000	That's what people said about other ones.
8704000	8705000	I guess that's true. That's true.
8705000	8708000	But I am going to. You know what? But here's the thing.
8708000	8713000	I think it's more dark soccer. Like if I can't get one, I'm not going to upset myself over it.
8713000	8714000	I'm not going to. If I get one.
8714000	8717000	Yeah. Nice surprise.
8717000	8720000	And also, you have a TurboGrafx. So, you know, I don't know.
8720000	8721000	I'm talking to her.
8721000	8725000	And well, and I'm also going to tell for why we are who is saying East Coast is screwed.
8725000	8731000	I think that the Prime Day starts specifically, though, for your region, I want to say.
8731000	8737000	So for you on the East Coast, it might be going live in 30 minutes.
8737000	8741000	I would check it out. Well, then that would suck for us because then they all get to grab it first.
8741000	8745000	But I'm going to sit and take a look. I'm going to wait until nine o'clock if you don't let me hang out.
8745000	8747000	That's fine. Yeah. I'm still going to check, too. Yeah.
8747000	8751000	So fine by me. If Alan gets back from the gym, maybe we can go.
8751000	8759000	It's not. Oh, so on there is saying it's three o'clock Eastern is what S.H.A. 100 Matt is saying.
8759000	8762000	Y.Y.R. in chat says Genesis mini preorders are still open.
8762000	8766000	Yeah, but that's the genesis. And it was a crap machine.
8766000	8772000	The mini was. Well, the new one, there's the new one that is doing not that because the old ones were done by a different company.
8772000	8776000	We'll see. All right. But at any rate, I'm going to hang around and then I'm going to go home.
8776000	8780000	That's fine. All right. So, Loki, your final thought tonight?
8780000	8785000	My final thought was I need to play some laser tag. We should play some laser tag.
8785000	8790000	I'd actually be down. I made the think of something. Maybe there's something we can.
8790000	8795000	I know. I see. I thought about like, you know, getting a GoPro or something for that.
8795000	8802000	But like what I really wanted to do was the state fair started this weekend and they had the Nintendo thing.
8802000	8808000	But it's gone. Today was last day. Oh, they have. They're doing some weird like gaming thing this year.
8808000	8813000	So like e-sports is like a big the state fair is really trying to cater to other stuff.
8813000	8817000	I got to applaud. They're really thinking outside the box of the way people in because I got the thing that I want to go.
8817000	8822000	They have an entire like hall that's dedicated to selfie stations.
8822000	8826000	So they have all these like awesome artwork that is intended for you to take selfies in front of.
8826000	8833000	And I'm all about that kind of vanity. So I'm going to I want to go to the state fair to see the selfie stations.
8833000	8840000	But if the gaming thing is out and about and around, I would definitely check that out, too, just because I like video games.
8840000	8843000	Yeah. But yeah, that's the thing. That's the thing they're doing this year.
8844000	8853000	All right. I guess that's just me. My final thought. My final thought is I may I don't know because it's being very last minute work.
8853000	8860000	I may go out of town next week. So if there isn't they told me that I would fly on Monday if I go.
8860000	8868000	But if something happens and there isn't a show next week, it's because I went out of town for work and day job comes first.
8868000	8875000	That's that's that. So if push came to shove, though, I'm sure Loki would dance on DDR or dark soccer would do a full hour or something.
8875000	8879000	So you never know. Maybe I'll finally get around to playing how to full boyfriend holiday star.
8879000	8884000	No, you know what I would do? I'm going to play some fucking laser tag.
8884000	8889000	That's right. You just say bye. I'm going to L.R. and then go play laser. I'm just going to play laser tag. Hell yeah.
8889000	8895000	Hell yeah. All right. That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Launch Radio. Thank you guys so much for listening to the show this week.
8895000	8901000	We appreciate you guys very much. Have a great week gaming. I'll try to get some Mario maker levels for you all to play.
8901000	8903000	So take care, guys. Good night.
8925000	8934000	Of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio or Vogue Network, but you know, they were all still true.
8934000	8937000	See you next week.
8955000	8969000	The.
