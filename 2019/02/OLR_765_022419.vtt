00:00.000 --> 00:18.080
This week, rumors swirl about Microsoft discussing a means for its titles to become available

00:18.080 --> 00:19.180
on the Nintendo Switch.

00:19.180 --> 00:22.180
This announcer would love more games available in a highly portable means.

00:22.180 --> 00:25.560
This is just one mixy rumor, stay tuned for the rest of the week's gaming news starting

00:25.560 --> 00:32.560
right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:32.560 --> 00:35.920
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.920 --> 00:37.880
where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.880 --> 00:44.800
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 765 for this February 24th

00:44.800 --> 00:46.580
of 2019.

00:46.580 --> 00:51.120
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always is the one and only Techmaster Loki.

00:51.120 --> 00:52.120
Hello.

00:52.120 --> 00:53.120
Hi, how are you?

00:53.120 --> 00:54.120
I'm good.

00:54.120 --> 00:56.880
We had five technical hiccups in the beginning but I think we got it all worked out.

00:56.880 --> 00:57.880
Yes.

00:57.880 --> 00:58.880
Do you know what I had to do to fix the issue?

00:58.880 --> 01:00.280
Turn it off and turn it back on.

01:00.280 --> 01:03.040
I had to turn it off and then turn it back on again and I fixed it.

01:03.040 --> 01:04.040
Alright.

01:04.040 --> 01:05.800
It's like magic, go figure.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.320
Tech support 101.

01:07.320 --> 01:11.960
Not joining us tonight in studio, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers, but this is the last week

01:11.960 --> 01:15.640
of her work thing that has kept her off the air for several months.

01:15.640 --> 01:19.680
Of course we'll hear from her at the classic game of the week as we have been over the

01:19.680 --> 01:23.440
past few months, but she will be back in studio full time next week.

01:23.440 --> 01:24.440
So that's pretty exciting.

01:24.440 --> 01:27.680
I know we had her last week, but you know, she's like, that was a special thing.

01:27.680 --> 01:32.280
So, um, but joining us tonight in studio is Mr. Smoosh and you might hear him in the background

01:32.280 --> 01:33.760
meowing cause I don't know what he's going.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.840
He was probably coming up through my sandwich cause I have half of it sitting on the couch

01:36.840 --> 01:37.840
right here.

01:37.840 --> 01:41.600
Oh, so he's like smelling the turkey or chicken or whatever's in your sandwich that you got.

01:41.600 --> 01:42.600
Yes.

01:42.600 --> 01:43.600
I see.

01:43.600 --> 01:44.600
All right.

01:44.600 --> 01:45.600
That explains a lot.

01:45.600 --> 01:47.800
He does kind of go crazy when he smells food because he thinks it's like feeding time.

01:47.800 --> 01:49.260
Just like me, just like dad.

01:49.260 --> 01:50.260
So there you go.

01:51.180 --> 01:55.620
We of course are live on the interwebs as we always are every Sunday night at six o'clock

01:55.620 --> 02:00.220
Pacific nine o'clock Eastern at the voice of geeks network vog network.com.

02:00.220 --> 02:05.700
We are on Twitch TV, the easiest way to find us Twitch TV slash vog network.

02:05.700 --> 02:10.300
Hello to everybody that's out there in our chat room over at Twitch TV and some folks

02:10.300 --> 02:16.100
talking a little bit about, uh, the, um, uh, intro that we did with the, we had a little

02:16.100 --> 02:20.180
joke, a star where you was born because there's obviously the Oscars are going on tonight,

02:20.180 --> 02:23.620
which I mean, I just, I don't really care about the Oscars.

02:23.620 --> 02:27.420
We've been doing this show for so long and not to be like that hipster.

02:27.420 --> 02:32.120
That's like, well, I don't care because my stuff is more important, but I mean, to me,

02:32.120 --> 02:35.540
this is more important and it's just, eh, you know, I don't know.

02:35.540 --> 02:41.040
It's like, it's an award show, whatever, like whether Gaga wins the Oscar or not, it's not

02:41.040 --> 02:44.540
going to change what kind of an artist she is and all this stuff.

02:44.540 --> 02:49.020
So I just kinda, I do understand that that the Oscars can bring like visibility maybe.

02:49.020 --> 02:52.160
And that's what it really used to be is that it really brought visibility to films that

02:52.160 --> 02:54.540
maybe otherwise people wouldn't see.

02:54.540 --> 02:57.740
But I feel like in this day and age and all the campaigns going behind it and all the,

02:57.740 --> 03:02.140
all the lead up with the hype and the 24 hours, seven internet news coverage, it's kinda,

03:02.140 --> 03:03.340
it's kind of a whatever.

03:03.340 --> 03:06.900
So yes, yet we all want gaming to have an award ceremony.

03:06.900 --> 03:08.100
I can tie it to gaming.

03:08.100 --> 03:09.400
We all want gaming to have an award ceremony.

03:09.400 --> 03:12.020
They have so many game trailers during the word ceremony.

03:12.020 --> 03:16.980
See if like they had like movie trailer debuts, Oh, make it like the MTV movie awards, but

03:16.980 --> 03:17.980
yeah.

03:17.980 --> 03:18.980
Okay.

03:18.980 --> 03:20.700
So that's more, who cares with the Oscars?

03:20.700 --> 03:22.420
You should, you know, the Oscars have been having problems.

03:22.420 --> 03:24.060
They don't even have a host this year.

03:24.060 --> 03:25.060
They got so many problems.

03:25.060 --> 03:27.020
No one called me.

03:27.020 --> 03:30.340
I was sitting here waiting and it's like, my phone's not ringing.

03:30.340 --> 03:35.020
I guess I'm not hosting the Oscars this year, unfortunately.

03:35.020 --> 03:36.020
So here I am.

03:36.020 --> 03:39.380
We'll be waiting here waiting for your call.

03:39.420 --> 03:43.460
I mean, they were scraping the bottom of the barrel to try to find people to do it.

03:43.460 --> 03:45.940
I'm telling you, I'm at the bottom of that barrel.

03:45.940 --> 03:49.740
So did you hear like the conspiracy theory that Whoopi Goldberg secretly was off the

03:49.740 --> 03:53.060
view because she was prepping to host the Oscars cause she'd done it before.

03:53.060 --> 03:56.220
So of course, you know, who better to host than somebody that hosted before, but no,

03:56.220 --> 03:57.220
she just had pneumonia.

03:57.220 --> 03:59.340
People made up that rumor.

03:59.340 --> 04:00.340
It's funny.

04:00.340 --> 04:05.500
Uh, in our chat over at Twitch TV, uh, slash vog network, uh, quest buster says, I'll see

04:05.500 --> 04:07.140
the winners list tomorrow morning.

04:07.140 --> 04:08.140
That's kind of where I'm at.

04:08.140 --> 04:09.140
That's where I'm at.

04:09.140 --> 04:13.860
Uh, Bobby Blackwell says, unfortunately the game trailers pay for the game awards.

04:13.860 --> 04:15.620
That's why they have to cram in the awards.

04:15.620 --> 04:19.420
That is a true statement though, is that, you know, they're commercials.

04:19.420 --> 04:20.420
Those game trailers are commercials.

04:20.420 --> 04:21.860
I don't care why they're there.

04:21.860 --> 04:23.060
I just like that they're there.

04:23.060 --> 04:24.860
I mean, it makes sense.

04:24.860 --> 04:25.860
I don't care.

04:25.860 --> 04:26.860
It's, it's fine.

04:26.860 --> 04:27.860
All right.

04:27.860 --> 04:31.220
Well let's, I guess, I guess movies are on everybody's mind, so it's appropriate that

04:31.220 --> 04:34.460
our kickoff topic tonight has a little bit to do with movies, right?

04:34.460 --> 04:35.460
Yes.

04:35.460 --> 04:38.940
It has to do with movies that were on steam cause they had that.

04:38.940 --> 04:43.220
I think the only movie they had on steam was indie game, the movie from humble bundle.

04:43.220 --> 04:45.920
You're actually really, really wrong.

04:45.920 --> 04:49.780
And this is the perfect reason why there are no longer movies on steam.

04:49.780 --> 04:54.260
I think indie game, the movie was like the first one because they kind of released it

04:54.260 --> 04:59.420
like it was a game and they had, well, no, I said the only game, only movie I had was

04:59.420 --> 05:03.340
indie game, the movie totally, you know, okay, sorry.

05:03.340 --> 05:04.500
Throw me under the bus there.

05:04.500 --> 05:05.500
It's fine.

05:05.500 --> 05:06.500
No.

05:06.500 --> 05:10.780
The only movie that I had on steam, I think it was indie game, the movie under the Pikachu.

05:10.780 --> 05:11.780
That's all I got.

05:11.780 --> 05:13.980
Um, but no, they did have more movies on there.

05:13.980 --> 05:17.660
It's just not a lot of people really remembered that they had them on there.

05:17.660 --> 05:20.660
And plus there's like a lot of different other video platforms.

05:20.660 --> 05:25.760
So I don't, I think if they did more like humble movie bundles or something like that,

05:25.760 --> 05:32.440
they might've, you know, brought more, um, exposure to it, but it didn't seem like that

05:32.440 --> 05:34.260
a lot of people knew about it or cared about it.

05:34.260 --> 05:35.260
And so now it's going away.

05:35.300 --> 05:39.140
Well, and I also like when were movies ever featured on the front page of steam?

05:39.140 --> 05:41.140
Like I've never seen movies.

05:41.140 --> 05:45.100
And is it because they switched more to that algorithm where it's kind of like, like everybody

05:45.100 --> 05:47.700
has a custom store based on the content you buy.

05:47.700 --> 05:52.060
So if you're not buying movies, you never see movies, but like, hello, how am I going

05:52.060 --> 05:54.180
to know about movies if they're not there?

05:54.180 --> 05:56.860
Plus they, they weren't exactly cheap either, right?

05:56.860 --> 06:00.300
Like maybe if they had like a 99 cent movie once in a while, people might be more into

06:00.300 --> 06:01.300
it.

06:01.300 --> 06:02.300
Or maybe a movie rental thing.

06:02.300 --> 06:03.300
I mean, I don't know.

06:03.340 --> 06:08.140
I'm looking right now cause like my library, I've got my library of stuff and so I don't

06:08.140 --> 06:16.460
even know where this would be cause there's games, software, VR and music.

06:16.460 --> 06:18.340
I don't see movies.

06:18.340 --> 06:20.740
So is that under software?

06:20.740 --> 06:22.100
Nope.

06:22.100 --> 06:24.660
So is it under music?

06:24.660 --> 06:25.660
Nope.

06:25.660 --> 06:29.860
So it really, so you, you're saying that it really feels like the movies is like just

06:29.860 --> 06:33.200
super like kind of like tacked on under a rock.

06:33.200 --> 06:35.840
You have to kind of know where to go to get it.

06:35.840 --> 06:38.040
Kind of like what Xbox indie games turned into.

06:38.040 --> 06:43.440
Like I don't even know where I would go in steam to watch that movie they have.

06:43.440 --> 06:45.540
Well, indie game shows up as a game.

06:45.540 --> 06:50.920
I know cause I have that same movie because I think I got that indie game, the movie in

06:50.920 --> 06:53.320
one of those things you're talking about, like a humble pack or something.

06:53.320 --> 06:58.280
So it's in the store in like, as just like a game, but that was a very special thing.

06:58.280 --> 07:01.160
Not all movies kind of like worked like that.

07:01.160 --> 07:02.160
Yeah.

07:02.160 --> 07:05.800
Well, it's gone or it's going to be gone soon.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.800
So hope you didn't get attached to it.

07:07.800 --> 07:08.800
Yeah.

07:08.800 --> 07:12.480
Oh, what do you, I mean, I guess this kind of leads it to a bigger question about how

07:12.480 --> 07:18.760
important is the integration of movies and all this stuff into your service?

07:18.760 --> 07:22.640
Because I mean, I think about like my PlayStation four, like, especially because it's in the

07:22.640 --> 07:25.840
living room, it's kind of like my, my device that's in there.

07:25.840 --> 07:31.100
Uh, I do a lot of Twitch TV on it and I really wish the Twitch TV app had like the same,

07:31.100 --> 07:34.820
I wish it was on par with the PC, PC desktop version.

07:34.820 --> 07:38.420
Like you can't search by tags on the PS four version.

07:38.420 --> 07:39.420
I do that a lot.

07:39.420 --> 07:42.580
So there's little things that I would like to still see improved and have like the parody

07:42.580 --> 07:43.580
with desktop, but whatever.

07:43.580 --> 07:49.100
Um, but I do a lot of like Netflix, in fact, Sony in particular really has a nice little

07:49.100 --> 07:51.020
like one stop thing.

07:51.020 --> 07:54.660
Like when you go into the TV and movies, it kind of shows like all these movies and it

07:54.660 --> 07:56.940
shows like what platforms they're all on.

07:56.940 --> 07:57.940
Yeah.

07:57.940 --> 07:58.940
This was on Amazon prime.

07:58.940 --> 07:59.940
This was on Hulu.

07:59.980 --> 08:04.740
And you kind of know like where to go and I think you can actually search for anything

08:04.740 --> 08:07.660
and it'll show you what service it's in, which is brilliant.

08:07.660 --> 08:12.660
A lot of different, I know like Google TV does or Android TV does the same thing.

08:12.660 --> 08:14.740
Um, you can search by that stuff.

08:14.740 --> 08:15.740
Roku.

08:15.740 --> 08:18.580
I think my Roku TV does that.

08:18.580 --> 08:20.920
Um, maybe, I don't know.

08:20.920 --> 08:24.620
I just remember my old one does and it has like voice chat, which never really worked

08:24.620 --> 08:29.900
correctly, but, um, yeah, I mean, I don't tend to buy.

08:29.900 --> 08:35.740
Movies digitally, which is because we have all these services that kind of keep coming

08:35.740 --> 08:37.660
and going away.

08:37.660 --> 08:42.780
Um, I've looked at a few, like during the sales and stuff and they have on the PlayStation

08:42.780 --> 08:45.340
store, like they'll have movies for sale sometimes.

08:45.340 --> 08:46.340
And they're still always too expensive.

08:46.340 --> 08:47.700
It's like 10 bucks for a movie.

08:47.700 --> 08:52.380
I'm like, eh, I'll just buy the physical movie if I'm going to do that.

08:52.380 --> 08:55.900
So that's why we turned to the old piracy.

08:55.900 --> 08:59.820
Well, I don't, I don't pirate movies, but I think you're right about the subscription

08:59.820 --> 09:00.820
service.

09:00.820 --> 09:03.140
I don't remember the last time I bought a movie.

09:03.140 --> 09:04.940
Like it's been a long time.

09:04.940 --> 09:09.780
I know I bought Tron, uh, legacy on Blu-ray, but that was how many years ago?

09:09.780 --> 09:10.940
Like that was 2010.

09:10.940 --> 09:11.940
Was that movie?

09:11.940 --> 09:12.940
Well, yeah.

09:12.940 --> 09:16.420
And also my, I honestly don't remember the last time I bought a Blu-ray and lots of fun.

09:16.420 --> 09:22.340
I'm acquiring is just, you know, for my wife or my kids to watch and then they'll watch

09:22.340 --> 09:25.020
it and get bored of it, but it's all for me.

09:25.020 --> 09:30.860
It's all subscription service, which is interesting because that's where music went, right?

09:30.860 --> 09:35.220
Music was, um, you know, you used to, it was like, it was all about going to for me when

09:35.220 --> 09:36.220
I was younger.

09:36.220 --> 09:37.220
Here I go.

09:37.220 --> 09:38.220
I'm going to date myself.

09:38.220 --> 09:39.220
Y'all ready?

09:39.220 --> 09:44.700
I used to go to the warehouse or tower records as back when tower records knew me back at

09:44.700 --> 09:45.700
the warehouse.

09:45.700 --> 09:53.140
Um, I remember I actually received a gift certificate, not a gift card, a gift certificate,

09:53.140 --> 09:57.940
like a written out piece of paper that you would take in to redeem for money.

09:57.940 --> 09:58.940
Yeah.

09:58.940 --> 10:03.540
Um, so I would go get the new, like the guy at tower records knew me.

10:03.540 --> 10:08.580
Like it was like, Oh, he's the one that will want the import Bjork single that came in

10:08.580 --> 10:13.060
with the, with the rare remix of hyper ballad or whatever it is like he knew they knew me

10:13.060 --> 10:14.060
there.

10:14.060 --> 10:18.780
But, um, but yeah, I used to like buy all that stuff and then Napster came out and like

10:18.780 --> 10:20.260
I would still buy CDs.

10:20.260 --> 10:23.700
I didn't like to pirate things, you know, all the time.

10:23.700 --> 10:29.060
I would still buy CDs for the artists I support, but for those like ultra rare remixes that

10:29.060 --> 10:34.200
was like a Europe only CD type of thing, you got to pay $12 because I would, it's only

10:34.200 --> 10:35.200
on the vinyl.

10:35.200 --> 10:40.420
I would, I would download those on Napster because you know, like I'm not like, you know,

10:40.420 --> 10:42.340
it was a ridiculous amount we were paying.

10:42.340 --> 10:43.340
Right.

10:43.340 --> 10:44.900
So I kind of justified it with that.

10:44.900 --> 10:48.580
Um, but, but then iTunes came out and that really changed everything.

10:48.580 --> 10:50.740
It made everything like a worldwide market.

10:50.740 --> 10:54.460
Like there was no import stuff, hardly any more, maybe in the very, very beginning.

10:54.460 --> 10:58.580
But now, you know, there's so much you can download like worldwide and through Apple

10:58.580 --> 11:02.420
music through Spotify, you know, we just had a story about Capcom soundtracks all being

11:02.420 --> 11:03.420
on Spotify last week.

11:03.420 --> 11:08.100
Like, you know, subscription services, where it at, where it's at now movies to do in this

11:08.100 --> 11:09.580
very similar thing, right?

11:09.580 --> 11:13.020
Like I don't really buy movies ever.

11:13.020 --> 11:17.100
I can't tell you, like, I have a very impressive collection of DVDs from when I lived with

11:17.100 --> 11:21.100
you and you worked for the movie distributor and you're always like, Oh, this is like

11:21.100 --> 11:22.100
a gay film.

11:22.100 --> 11:23.100
Rob would like this.

11:23.100 --> 11:24.780
You get the, I didn't always do that.

11:24.780 --> 11:25.780
Just no, it was just that.

11:25.780 --> 11:27.380
But like, Oh, Oh, you knew this stuff.

11:27.380 --> 11:30.460
I like to like, Oh, strangers with candy, the movie Rob was like obsessed with that

11:30.460 --> 11:31.460
show.

11:31.460 --> 11:33.500
I'll pull that, which I deeply appreciate to this day.

11:33.500 --> 11:36.580
However, the reality is like, how often do I really pop in those discs?

11:36.580 --> 11:40.660
I just don't because now it's more about, I want to watch something.

11:40.660 --> 11:42.220
Let's go to Netflix.

11:42.220 --> 11:43.220
Right.

11:43.220 --> 11:44.220
Yeah.

11:44.660 --> 11:48.500
For anybody that listens to shaking and crying, cheap plug, cause that just came back.

11:48.500 --> 11:53.160
Uh, Victoria told me that I had to let my homework assignment was to watch abducted

11:53.160 --> 12:01.260
in plain sight, which yes, which wow, wow is all I have to say, wow.

12:01.260 --> 12:02.260
That's all I have to say about that.

12:02.260 --> 12:06.280
My wife watched that and she wanted me to watch it, but I was like, no, Victoria told

12:06.280 --> 12:10.160
me it was like the beginning about like, yeah, and the parents didn't call for five days.

12:10.160 --> 12:11.160
Like it'll blow your mind.

12:11.160 --> 12:12.160
I'm like, why wouldn't they do it?

12:12.200 --> 12:17.320
You just have to watch the movie and I, wow, that was, I was not ready for that.

12:17.320 --> 12:20.840
So anyway, sorry, I didn't mean to be like glowing movie critic here, but that is, I

12:20.840 --> 12:24.000
mean, but that conversation, it wasn't like, Oh, I got to go buy this Blu-ray or, Oh, I

12:24.000 --> 12:26.840
got to go, you know, to the store or I got to go rent this.

12:26.840 --> 12:27.840
I got to go to the rental store.

12:27.840 --> 12:30.460
It's just, Oh, I'm going to log out of Netflix and get it, you know?

12:30.460 --> 12:36.160
And that's why places like CBS all access with their Twilight zone remake and all this

12:36.160 --> 12:38.680
stuff that, you know, looks, looks really good.

12:39.320 --> 12:43.600
And, you know, everybody else wants to do all of their subscription things, right?

12:43.600 --> 12:47.920
And then video game consoles have been a great way to kind of house all that in one, especially

12:47.920 --> 12:50.040
these smart ones to kind of bring all that together.

12:50.040 --> 12:53.580
Now here's, here's comes the game part, right?

12:53.580 --> 12:57.320
Because music did it, TV did it.

12:57.320 --> 12:58.960
How long before games do it?

12:58.960 --> 13:03.320
And you already see a lot of companies dipping their toe in the water of this, right?

13:03.320 --> 13:07.720
Like Microsoft very clearly is pushing this game pass thing.

13:07.720 --> 13:08.720
That's what they want to do.

13:08.720 --> 13:12.840
And they, they, they see this and Microsoft's like, Oh, I kind of want to be, you know,

13:12.840 --> 13:18.200
we want to be like the Netflix video games, um, Nintendo to some extent for better, for

13:18.200 --> 13:21.840
worse, doing it with their classic library on switch online.

13:21.840 --> 13:22.840
Right.

13:22.840 --> 13:23.840
Yeah.

13:23.840 --> 13:27.360
But like, look at a lot of the games that like everybody's talking about right now.

13:27.360 --> 13:29.000
It's like free stuff.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.840
It's not like 60.

13:30.840 --> 13:33.200
I mean, someone, I just want to buy Apex.

13:33.200 --> 13:35.080
Everybody's talking about crackdown three.

13:35.080 --> 13:36.960
They were pushing game pass on that.

13:36.960 --> 13:40.280
And they're like, well, you could just purchase game pass and you get this for this or you

13:40.280 --> 13:41.280
can buy the full thing.

13:41.280 --> 13:43.380
I'm like, well, I'm just going to buy the full thing.

13:43.380 --> 13:46.280
But to be honest, I probably could have just bought game pass for that.

13:46.280 --> 13:50.120
Um, I just didn't know, like, I don't know if it works on PC yet.

13:50.120 --> 13:54.360
Like I know a lot of stuff is crossed by, so you would think, okay, because it's available

13:54.360 --> 13:59.080
in game pass, this should be available on PC to be able to download.

13:59.080 --> 14:01.160
But I wasn't sure if that's a thing yet.

14:01.160 --> 14:03.880
So I didn't purchase the game pass that way.

14:03.880 --> 14:06.400
But um, having finished crackdown.

14:06.400 --> 14:07.400
Yeah.

14:07.400 --> 14:08.400
Yeah.

14:08.400 --> 14:09.400
Lots of comments in chat on this subject.

14:09.400 --> 14:10.400
Crystal skies.

14:10.400 --> 14:11.400
80 says I did that with Anthem.

14:11.400 --> 14:16.040
So I know some people are just buying that month subscription to the service because

14:16.040 --> 14:19.480
maybe they feel like, Oh, I'm only going to really play Anthem for a month and then I'll

14:19.480 --> 14:20.720
move over to the next big thing.

14:20.720 --> 14:21.720
Right.

14:21.720 --> 14:24.400
Like I feel like these types of services are made for people like me that just like don't

14:24.400 --> 14:26.200
have gaming attention span.

14:26.200 --> 14:27.200
Right.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.200
Um, let's see.

14:28.240 --> 14:33.160
200 Matt says I used to collect DVDs and Blu-rays not so much anymore with the instant gratification

14:33.160 --> 14:34.440
I get from streaming it.

14:34.440 --> 14:36.160
And not to, I think that's important too.

14:36.160 --> 14:40.640
Like collectibles collectors, like definitely like, I'm not saying like kill Blu-rays.

14:40.640 --> 14:41.640
Netflix is the only way.

14:41.640 --> 14:42.640
I'm not saying that at all actually.

14:42.640 --> 14:47.200
Cause like as collectibles as I will still even pick up a CD once in a while, but you

14:47.200 --> 14:52.240
know where I'll pick up a CD at a concert with the artists there about ready to sign

14:52.240 --> 14:56.440
it as like a memory, a collectible of that night or of that experience type of thing.

14:56.440 --> 14:57.440
Right.

14:57.680 --> 14:58.680
I don't buy CDs anymore.

14:58.680 --> 15:01.760
Um, it was just because it's the way I listen to my music in my car.

15:01.760 --> 15:07.680
Um, but I will purchase like MP3s directly from the artists and stuff a lot of times.

15:07.680 --> 15:12.760
Like one artist I, I'm fawning over right now is the band Gunship.

15:12.760 --> 15:16.440
So I tend to buy a lot of their albums and stuff all digitally.

15:16.440 --> 15:21.920
And so they're getting all of the profit from that and their merch and all that kind of

15:21.920 --> 15:22.920
stuff.

15:22.920 --> 15:26.160
So I don't know, that seems to be the better way for me to do it because I can find music

15:26.160 --> 15:31.880
online and I can purchase directly from the artists I used to though what I used to like

15:31.880 --> 15:36.680
back before, you know, the internet was fast and everything was going to a lot of these

15:36.680 --> 15:44.400
record stores and buying the like compilation, like trance electronica type things.

15:44.400 --> 15:46.880
Cause that introduced me to more artists and stuff.

15:46.880 --> 15:51.000
And then I could go search those artists out on, you know, which is funny because it's

15:51.000 --> 15:55.120
like Spotify to me now is these playlists that are all curated by Spotify and it's like,

15:55.120 --> 15:58.140
here's some of the artists you like with a few others mixed in we think you'd like.

15:58.140 --> 16:03.880
And I got to say, like, I like, I've discovered like a lot of great music because of that,

16:03.880 --> 16:05.400
that I really do like.

16:05.400 --> 16:09.000
So I mean, not to like endorse somebody that's not paying for an advertisement, but it's,

16:09.000 --> 16:10.000
it is what it is.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.000
Right.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
That's kind of how it goes now.

16:12.000 --> 16:16.960
So, and, um, funny enough, this whole show starting around dance, dance revolution and

16:16.960 --> 16:20.720
music game culture, where did all that music from DDR come from in the beginning that dance

16:20.720 --> 16:25.760
mania compilation, like the trance, but for, you know, silly dance music that was popular

16:25.760 --> 16:26.760
overseas.

16:26.760 --> 16:28.320
So it's kind of funny.

16:28.320 --> 16:29.320
Yeah.

16:29.320 --> 16:30.320
So that's pretty awesome.

16:30.320 --> 16:34.160
Anyway, we deviated a little bit from the whole like steam doing movies, but I guess

16:34.160 --> 16:37.320
this maybe all comes back to like, you know, maybe if steam had done something, it was

16:37.320 --> 16:41.120
a little more subscription based or maybe something with original content.

16:41.120 --> 16:45.280
But I also, I just feel like steam in this kind of era, I don't know if they've really

16:45.280 --> 16:49.120
been doing it so much lately, but there's definitely a type of a time when steam was

16:49.120 --> 16:51.160
just kind of like, Oh, we're just going to throw that in.

16:51.160 --> 16:52.280
We're going to throw that in there.

16:52.280 --> 16:54.200
We're going to throw in the movies and do that.

16:54.200 --> 16:59.560
Well, the broadcasting too, do you guys remember steam has a whole like Twitch TV competitor

16:59.560 --> 17:04.760
thing built into it, like steam broadcasting, even though he remembers that and why not?

17:04.760 --> 17:05.960
Because they don't push it.

17:05.960 --> 17:11.880
Steam just kind of, Hey, and maybe, you know, I don't, it may not be a space that they want

17:11.880 --> 17:12.880
to get into.

17:12.880 --> 17:17.720
I don't want to like hammer this into the ground, but maybe this is a drawback about

17:17.720 --> 17:20.960
the way valve is structured in general, right?

17:20.960 --> 17:22.760
You've heard this about valve, right?

17:22.760 --> 17:24.840
Nobody has a title at valve.

17:24.840 --> 17:27.320
Nobody has like primary responsibilities at valve.

17:27.320 --> 17:28.880
They find something they want to work on.

17:28.880 --> 17:29.880
It's just Gabe.

17:29.880 --> 17:33.640
And then everybody else say, you guys might remember how I work at my job.

17:33.640 --> 17:34.880
I find things I want to work on.

17:34.880 --> 17:39.720
You guys might remember a long time ago when that, uh, employee manual from valve leaked

17:39.720 --> 17:44.080
and who knows if it was intentional or not, but it describes a lot of this type of culture.

17:44.080 --> 17:51.120
Maybe this is part of where there's a little bit of an issue because nobody is really designated

17:51.120 --> 17:56.740
as, Oh, you're the guy that's going to make sure that broadcasting goes a step further

17:56.740 --> 18:00.880
on steam or you're the guy that's going to make sure we make a lot of us are working

18:00.880 --> 18:01.880
on half-life three.

18:01.880 --> 18:02.880
No water.

18:02.880 --> 18:03.880
It's not coming out.

18:03.880 --> 18:04.880
Jeez.

18:04.880 --> 18:08.360
So I thought you were working on it and I thought you were working on it.

18:08.360 --> 18:09.360
I don't know.

18:09.360 --> 18:11.380
That's just, that's just kind of my thought on steam.

18:11.380 --> 18:16.600
Let me get a few more, uh, chat comments here in, uh, our chat, um, over Twitch TV slash

18:16.600 --> 18:17.600
VOG network.

18:17.600 --> 18:23.900
Miltonius games says, uh, it's hard now being more selective in what I put in my house while

18:23.900 --> 18:26.500
also wanting to support smaller things.

18:26.500 --> 18:28.700
That's why I like Twitch subs and Patrion.

18:28.700 --> 18:29.940
Yeah, for sure.

18:29.940 --> 18:31.540
Like, you know, and this is a great way.

18:31.540 --> 18:35.820
Like obviously we are, we love you guys that do the subs and the biddies and stuff.

18:35.820 --> 18:39.740
It does go a long way in running this as a business and helping us to grow and attend

18:39.740 --> 18:40.740
more conventions, stuff like that.

18:40.740 --> 18:43.900
But to, to spare you that whole line, like obviously that's a great way to really reach

18:43.900 --> 18:49.260
out and directly affect, you know, creators and so forth.

18:49.260 --> 18:53.340
Metal mayhem says, aside from some stuff that steam has given away for free, I never grabbed

18:53.340 --> 18:56.660
any videos from steam, especially since most are streaming only.

18:56.660 --> 19:00.020
If I were to pay money for digital videos, it'll be through iTunes or whatever, at least

19:00.020 --> 19:02.000
there I can download videos.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
There's a good point too.

19:03.000 --> 19:07.480
If, if steam wasn't really letting you keep it on your own drive to like build up a collection

19:07.480 --> 19:11.960
when your internet goes down or something like then, you know, that ownership I think

19:11.960 --> 19:12.960
is important to some people.

19:12.960 --> 19:14.400
I think that's a really good point.

19:14.400 --> 19:19.280
So I'm pretty sure I had movies through like ultraviolet or something, but hell if I remember

19:19.280 --> 19:23.200
what my, you, you did hear the news, the ultraviolet like, yeah, I don't care though.

19:23.200 --> 19:25.360
I don't even care what movies I had on there.

19:25.360 --> 19:27.720
There's a blue Ray over there on the counter and I was just looking at, I'm like, there's

19:27.720 --> 19:29.400
a ultraviolet sticker on this.

19:29.400 --> 19:33.880
I wonder if like Alan or I ever like redeem that.

19:33.880 --> 19:36.720
There's so many people that probably never even bothered to redeem their digital copies.

19:36.720 --> 19:37.720
I don't care.

19:37.720 --> 19:40.160
Like at this point it's like, who cares?

19:40.160 --> 19:45.800
Well, because now, I mean, I have, I have one goo or I have one movie on, on a Google

19:45.800 --> 19:46.800
play movies.

19:46.800 --> 19:47.800
What's that?

19:47.800 --> 19:51.480
I have a elf because they gave it away for free one time.

19:51.480 --> 19:56.680
I have a few movies on iTunes because they're all movies that I did shadowcast stuff with.

19:56.680 --> 19:59.080
So I have Rocky horror picture show on iTunes.

19:59.080 --> 20:00.920
I have clue the movie on iTunes.

20:00.920 --> 20:06.700
I have repo the genetic opera on iTunes because it's great because you can go and any scene

20:06.700 --> 20:10.900
like, on my phone, I can go and it's like, okay, we want to look at this one scene or

20:10.900 --> 20:11.900
whatever.

20:11.900 --> 20:12.900
It's just like right there.

20:12.900 --> 20:14.260
And so that is extremely useful.

20:14.260 --> 20:17.780
Um, but that's about, you know, the most that I've used that stuff for.

20:17.780 --> 20:20.340
But anyway, so, um, I know there's like another part.

20:20.340 --> 20:21.340
Yes.

20:21.340 --> 20:25.720
So other stuff, since that's going away, well, what's, what's going in its place or what

20:25.720 --> 20:27.700
other things are they adding to the service?

20:27.700 --> 20:33.900
Well, one thing that they're going to be adding is, um, next VR virtual reality broadcasts.

20:33.900 --> 20:39.540
So these are basically like broadcasts of different events like, uh, I see, uh, NHL

20:39.540 --> 20:45.360
ICC soccer games, WWE matches, um, concerts and whatnot.

20:45.360 --> 20:50.180
And so you can actually kind of have a view from, you know, court side or whatever.

20:50.180 --> 20:54.500
And you can kind of look around as, um, like you're right there.

20:54.500 --> 20:56.700
Um, so it's going to be available.

20:56.700 --> 21:01.340
I think it's just like a software package that they're selling, um, but they're going

21:01.340 --> 21:07.260
to basically allow you to, um, use your Vive or, you know, windows mixed reality headset

21:07.260 --> 21:09.460
to watch this stuff on steam.

21:09.460 --> 21:12.320
Um, that's cool.

21:12.320 --> 21:17.820
Like it's nice to see VR in applications that aren't just games, you know, the real world

21:17.820 --> 21:18.820
stuff.

21:18.820 --> 21:22.580
And I kind of think this is the type of market that VR would be even, even more, you know,

21:22.580 --> 21:26.780
get more exposure and stuff for, and why Facebook got on in the business of VR as well.

21:26.780 --> 21:31.400
But, um, I digress it's, it's interesting though, that steam on the one hand, right

21:31.400 --> 21:35.300
as they're saying, you know what, we're kind of done with this movies is yet welcoming

21:35.300 --> 21:40.540
in, let's do this live broadcast and you know, event type broadcasting with the, you know,

21:40.540 --> 21:45.980
same things people do pay-per-view for wrestling matches, concerts, and so forth when steam

21:45.980 --> 21:51.180
hasn't really showed that they really go all in on anything like steam has broadcasting,

21:51.180 --> 21:56.580
but it's surprising to this, like at like, can like not necessarily conventions there's

21:56.580 --> 22:02.180
but like at arenas and stuff like actually have you pay subscription service to see all

22:02.180 --> 22:06.660
of the shows that are at this arena, you know, from home and then virtual, I guess they'd

22:06.660 --> 22:07.660
lose a lot of money that way.

22:07.660 --> 22:11.500
And that's probably why they probably, I mean, arenas make a lot of money from food and you

22:11.500 --> 22:12.500
know, everything else.

22:12.500 --> 22:17.540
But I, I, I w but if you think of, I mean, if you think about like WrestleMania or something

22:17.540 --> 22:20.780
like that, you know, once it sells out or whatever wrestling about, once it sells out,

22:20.780 --> 22:24.200
they sell the pay-per-view so they'll, they'll still sell more seats and stuff.

22:24.200 --> 22:25.900
But I think a subscription for that.

22:25.900 --> 22:30.380
I mean, sure, it sounds great, but I don't know if finding, I mean, these, these stars

22:30.380 --> 22:32.700
make a lot of money to do these live appearances.

22:32.700 --> 22:36.440
So it'd be, it would be an expensive ticket if nothing else, you know, think about what

22:36.440 --> 22:40.140
somebody is paying for a season ticket to like for the Kings game or something, you

22:40.140 --> 22:41.140
know, they ain't cheap.

22:41.140 --> 22:42.140
Well, I don't know.

22:42.140 --> 22:43.140
Anyway.

22:43.140 --> 22:44.140
All right.

22:44.140 --> 22:45.140
Well, we'll see.

22:45.140 --> 22:48.500
I'd be curious to see, you know, if steam actually kind of throws their back into this.

22:48.500 --> 22:52.740
I mean, I know they have an interest in this to revive or if they just kind of half-ass

22:52.740 --> 22:58.940
it or, um, you know, let's put this on other platforms like the PlayStation virtual reality

22:58.940 --> 22:59.940
headset.

22:59.940 --> 23:00.940
It'd be nice.

23:00.940 --> 23:05.420
Um, in chat, um, Miltonius game says arena digital tickets will probably happen to be

23:05.420 --> 23:06.420
fair.

23:06.420 --> 23:08.660
I mean, short the subscription, maybe you're talking about the subscription thing he's

23:08.660 --> 23:13.820
talking about, but as far as like, it kind of already happens, be it, you know, the football

23:13.820 --> 23:17.580
game is on TV and it's being subsidized by advertising.

23:17.580 --> 23:19.100
You're paying for it by watching ads, right?

23:19.100 --> 23:22.420
When you watch the super bowl or the NFL or something like that.

23:22.540 --> 23:26.860
Whether you're watching the NFL on Twitter or on NBC or whatever, you're, you're subsidizing

23:26.860 --> 23:27.860
it with ads.

23:27.860 --> 23:28.860
So you're still paying for it one way or the other.

23:28.860 --> 23:29.860
Right.

23:29.860 --> 23:34.260
Um, which is why if they don't sell X number of seats, if you get the blackout, right.

23:34.260 --> 23:37.740
And you can't watch it because they want to fill up the arena first, but sure.

23:37.740 --> 23:42.180
If they can find a way to, to milk it, to squeeze the toothpaste thing until it's completely

23:42.180 --> 23:44.380
out, of course they'll sell more seats, but they're done.

23:44.380 --> 23:46.060
They're not really, they do that for like sporting events.

23:46.060 --> 23:49.140
They don't really, and like WrestleMania and boxing and stuff like that, but they don't

23:49.140 --> 23:50.140
really do it for concerts.

23:50.460 --> 23:56.100
Disney on ice or yeah, but like, well, once in a while it'll be like, Oh, but this last

23:56.100 --> 24:01.100
concert on the tour they filmed for the blue Ray, you know, the, or, or that there might

24:01.100 --> 24:05.860
be a pay-per-view event or something, but not every show, but it's, it's interesting.

24:05.860 --> 24:10.540
It'd be interesting to see what next VR is kind of market would be for that and, and

24:10.540 --> 24:12.020
what it might develop with that.

24:12.020 --> 24:17.380
So, um, SSG100 Matt in our chat says there's going to be a war when it comes to live sports

24:17.380 --> 24:18.420
and VR.

24:18.420 --> 24:21.540
So much money is involved that it's going to explode very quickly.

24:21.540 --> 24:22.540
Yeah.

24:22.540 --> 24:26.980
I'll be so interesting in probably five years to look back on shows like this and what we

24:26.980 --> 24:31.820
were thinking of VR then, because I think especially as that VR, you know, we got in

24:31.820 --> 24:36.140
a little bit of a spirited exchange about VR last week on the show and, and, you know,

24:36.140 --> 24:40.300
Jamie had brought up some concerns about like, you know, the big, the big like headset and

24:40.300 --> 24:41.740
everything you kind of have to put on your head.

24:41.740 --> 24:43.540
And I'm kind of like, I feel like that.

24:43.540 --> 24:44.540
Sure.

24:44.540 --> 24:45.540
Sure.

24:45.540 --> 24:46.540
I mean, that makes a lot of sense now.

24:46.540 --> 24:50.100
I don't like wearing that PlayStation headset even for an extended period of time, but you

24:50.100 --> 24:55.240
know, the technology is going to be there in just five, 10 years wait, where it's just

24:55.240 --> 24:59.700
like a little set of glasses, like swim goggles that you put on, and it's going to be able

24:59.700 --> 25:00.700
to show VR.

25:00.700 --> 25:05.980
And if you don't believe me, think about the desktop computer from 1995 that you had and

25:05.980 --> 25:10.500
what these little cell phone guys can do now, you know, it's crazy.

25:10.500 --> 25:14.260
So how fast technology advances and so forth.

25:14.260 --> 25:16.060
So Bobby Black Wolf does point out.

25:16.060 --> 25:18.680
So to be fair, next VR has been around for years.

25:18.680 --> 25:21.380
It was even available for the Vive, just not on Steam.

25:21.380 --> 25:22.820
It was on Vive port.

25:22.820 --> 25:24.740
It's been an Oculus thing since 2015.

25:24.740 --> 25:29.940
Well, certainly Steam going in there is now like, here's a chance to put it in front of

25:29.940 --> 25:34.580
gamers and go into this audience and why not do gaming events?

25:34.580 --> 25:35.580
Shit.

25:35.580 --> 25:37.820
Esports getting more, more and more, right?

25:37.820 --> 25:42.060
Especially as Overwatch League's really taken off, Dota, huge worldwide.

25:42.980 --> 25:45.340
And Steam has a big thing for that.

25:45.340 --> 25:48.900
So you know, that would be a great thing for them to do possibly with the VR.

25:48.900 --> 25:51.940
But will they, will they go all in like that?

25:51.940 --> 25:53.180
We don't know.

25:53.180 --> 25:54.180
That's up to Valve, I guess.

25:54.180 --> 25:55.180
Yeah.

25:55.180 --> 25:56.180
All right.

25:56.180 --> 25:57.180
So anyway, enough about that.

25:57.180 --> 25:59.260
Let's move on because we have other stories to talk about, but of course we get to talk

25:59.260 --> 26:02.380
about our own gaming weeks as well and the types of video games that we have been playing

26:02.380 --> 26:03.380
this week.

26:03.380 --> 26:04.860
So Loki, how was your gaming week?

26:04.860 --> 26:05.860
It was all right.

26:05.860 --> 26:07.200
I did play a few things.

26:07.200 --> 26:10.420
So I finally got around to playing Tetris 99 and that was okay.

26:10.460 --> 26:11.900
I played that for a bit.

26:11.900 --> 26:15.860
Um, it's a little frustrating though, cause it's like, you kept coming in 80th place.

26:15.860 --> 26:17.180
Well, yeah, that too.

26:17.180 --> 26:19.540
But like, um, I didn't mean to shade you.

26:19.540 --> 26:23.500
No, it's just like, it's just random, like garbage, like just comes on the screen all

26:23.500 --> 26:24.500
the time.

26:24.500 --> 26:25.500
I mean, and I get it.

26:25.500 --> 26:26.500
That's the point of it.

26:26.500 --> 26:29.620
But like, it seems like the whole targeting other people and stuff is pretty much useless.

26:29.620 --> 26:33.380
Like I just said, it's a default to like whoever's attacking or whatever, but there's like, seems

26:33.380 --> 26:35.780
no strategy whatsoever to that at all.

26:35.780 --> 26:39.860
So I'll give a shout out, um, to, um, somebody who I know has listened to OLR in the past

26:39.900 --> 26:43.660
and has had a lot of success on Twitch streaming this, but Kevin DDR, if you're out there,

26:43.660 --> 26:44.660
howdy, howdy.

26:44.660 --> 26:46.980
I'm glad to see you're doing very well for yourself on Twitch.

26:46.980 --> 26:50.300
And uh, he streams a lot of this Tetris 99 because he was playing all like, it's the

26:50.300 --> 26:51.660
same creators that made the grand master.

26:51.660 --> 26:55.900
You know, he's done very well with that with the, um, um, Oh my God, why is the name of

26:55.900 --> 26:58.060
that speed games done quick?

26:58.060 --> 26:59.060
Yeah.

26:59.060 --> 27:00.060
I knew it would come to me.

27:00.060 --> 27:03.740
My brain's getting slower in my old age, but anyway, um, it's the same company that, that

27:03.740 --> 27:05.660
made those games made this Tetris 99.

27:05.660 --> 27:09.700
And so I've been watching his stream a little bit here that I've been lurking and uh, you

27:09.740 --> 27:13.900
know, he's kind of explained some of like why he might target a certain way or do like

27:13.900 --> 27:14.900
what he's doing.

27:14.900 --> 27:18.340
And I've actually kind of learned a little bit just like watching him because the dude's

27:18.340 --> 27:22.340
a pro when it comes to Tetris and he's, he does very well in his wins on that.

27:22.340 --> 27:26.940
So kind of interesting how you can like learn about the game stuff from watching people

27:26.940 --> 27:27.940
on Twitch and stuff.

27:27.940 --> 27:28.940
Yeah.

27:28.940 --> 27:32.100
Back in the day it was come over to my house and watch me beat level three, three when

27:32.100 --> 27:33.100
you could do it.

27:33.100 --> 27:34.740
And you know, now it's Twitch.

27:34.740 --> 27:35.740
Yeah.

27:35.740 --> 27:37.620
So I did play a little bit of that and it was all right.

27:37.860 --> 27:42.900
I tried out the demo for Daemon X Machina and I was bored with that.

27:42.900 --> 27:48.260
I am not picking up that game, which is disappointing because I like armored core and stuff, but

27:48.260 --> 27:50.540
I just didn't find this game too exciting.

27:50.540 --> 27:52.120
I'm curious why bored?

27:52.120 --> 27:57.020
You just, just, it just, it was very slow paced and it seemed like that everything was

27:57.020 --> 27:59.420
kind of lock on targeting type stuff.

27:59.420 --> 28:07.380
It just didn't have the kind of, uh, action and, um, I don't know.

28:07.380 --> 28:13.860
It wasn't paced as well as like armored core where it was like pretty fast paced and dashing

28:13.860 --> 28:14.860
around stuff.

28:14.860 --> 28:18.540
It was more of like, okay, fly around and shoot a thing and okay.

28:18.540 --> 28:23.180
And I don't know, it was all right, but I am not planning on picking it up, which is

28:23.180 --> 28:28.680
this point because it looked pretty awesome originally, but, um, I did mostly play this

28:28.680 --> 28:33.500
week, uh, crackdown three, uh, I didn't get the stream many of it, but I finished the

28:33.500 --> 28:34.500
game.

28:34.500 --> 28:38.860
It was very short, but I mean, it's crackdown and crackdown was very short as well.

28:38.860 --> 28:42.180
They, they want you to play through it multiple times, I guess.

28:42.180 --> 28:45.900
I don't know if I'm going to do that, but I'm at the point now where I was just trying

28:45.900 --> 28:52.180
to a hundred percent, everything max out my, uh, agent, but I don't know how long I'm actually

28:52.180 --> 28:53.300
gonna play around with that.

28:53.300 --> 28:55.900
Cause it's getting to the point now where it's boring.

28:55.900 --> 29:01.620
Even like with like some of the later levels, all they do is just throw more things at your

29:01.620 --> 29:02.620
way.

29:02.620 --> 29:07.180
And it's like artificially trying to increase the difficulty by just throwing like, okay,

29:07.180 --> 29:09.300
now there's 30 people attacking you at once.

29:09.300 --> 29:10.300
Okay.

29:10.300 --> 29:11.300
Well, they're not even harder to kill.

29:11.300 --> 29:15.700
It's just, I'm getting shot by like every little thing in all sides and somehow they're

29:15.700 --> 29:20.540
able to track me even though they can't see me and it's just ridiculous stuff like that.

29:20.540 --> 29:23.420
But there's not much of a penalty for dying.

29:23.420 --> 29:24.420
You just kind of respawn.

29:24.420 --> 29:29.180
And especially with the boss fights, you respond, the boss is just like, Oh, Hey, the boss followed

29:29.180 --> 29:30.180
me.

29:30.580 --> 29:34.420
I'm here and the boss is flying around or something and, and even like the end boss

29:34.420 --> 29:38.620
in the game was just very kind of, that's it.

29:38.620 --> 29:39.900
This is your big boss.

29:39.900 --> 29:41.260
It's pretty lame.

29:41.260 --> 29:42.340
Okay.

29:42.340 --> 29:47.220
And then they hint at something like, I don't know if it's from the earlier games because

29:47.220 --> 29:53.760
I have played cracked in one and two, um, but like they hint at some, like there's like

29:53.760 --> 29:59.060
some guys severed arm and I'm supposed to know who the fuck this person is.

29:59.060 --> 30:03.540
And like, he's supposed to be the guy that's like kind of controlling everything, but then

30:03.540 --> 30:05.140
there's like, it doesn't go anywhere.

30:05.140 --> 30:06.940
It's just, you finish the game and you're done.

30:06.940 --> 30:12.340
And it's like, stay tuned for the DLC or like sequel.

30:12.340 --> 30:13.700
I mean cracked up in form.

30:13.700 --> 30:15.420
I got the way another 12 years for that.

30:15.420 --> 30:18.640
I mean like, I don't know what they were trying to do with that.

30:18.640 --> 30:25.620
And I mean, I guess my bad if I don't remember the first and second game that well, I know

30:25.620 --> 30:30.580
like, I think some of the agents that were in the first game are like DNA things that

30:30.580 --> 30:32.100
you can find in the new game.

30:32.100 --> 30:36.100
And I, maybe that's the same with the second game as well, but I remember there were some

30:36.100 --> 30:40.740
like agent Rodriguez or something like that, that were in the first game.

30:40.740 --> 30:43.020
Um, but I don't know.

30:43.020 --> 30:47.040
It's just kind of, it's just cracked down.

30:47.040 --> 30:48.040
It's what it is.

30:48.040 --> 30:52.180
It's very, I had very low expectations for it and it's kind of, I don't know.

30:52.180 --> 30:57.500
It was entertaining, but now that I've finished it within like a week, I kind of wish, gee,

30:57.500 --> 31:03.620
that game pass would have been a, you know, a worthy investment because this game isn't

31:03.620 --> 31:06.380
very long and the multiplayer, I have no interest in playing.

31:06.380 --> 31:08.020
I was just about to ask about multiplayer.

31:08.020 --> 31:09.580
I haven't played the multiplayer yet.

31:09.580 --> 31:10.580
I could try that.

31:10.580 --> 31:12.140
I guess I've watched people play it online.

31:12.140 --> 31:18.540
I hear it's kind of lame just because it ends up being, um, since you can see the other

31:18.540 --> 31:21.460
players at all times on the map.

31:21.460 --> 31:25.940
So like you can see the Reddit, like where they are, even through buildings and stuff

31:25.940 --> 31:31.700
so that it ends up being whoever gets to the homing missiles first wins because it's just

31:31.700 --> 31:33.700
you homing missile, homing missiles all the time.

31:33.700 --> 31:37.020
Oh, so there's no like, there's no way you can hide or there's no stealth in it.

31:37.020 --> 31:38.280
No weird.

31:38.280 --> 31:39.380
So I don't know.

31:39.380 --> 31:43.700
I'll try, but it's not something like I'm very excited about.

31:43.700 --> 31:44.700
Co-op might be fun.

31:44.700 --> 31:48.340
If I had someone to play with, it'd be kind of fun, but you know, my character is maxed

31:48.340 --> 31:52.820
out and you can restart the game with your character maxed out.

31:52.820 --> 31:56.000
I don't know why I would want to do that other than, Oh, now I can rush just straight to

31:56.000 --> 31:59.340
the end and just kill the boss and be done.

31:59.340 --> 32:00.340
I don't know.

32:00.340 --> 32:01.340
We'll see.

32:01.340 --> 32:06.300
I'm kind of getting over this already, but it was fun while it lasted.

32:06.300 --> 32:07.300
All right.

32:07.300 --> 32:10.300
I'm going to go and that's about it.

32:10.300 --> 32:11.300
Um, okay.

32:11.300 --> 32:12.900
For my week, Pokemon go as well.

32:12.900 --> 32:15.340
They had that special little clam Pearl day.

32:15.340 --> 32:16.340
I got one of those.

32:16.340 --> 32:20.500
I had, I had family stuff, so I couldn't really like go the whole three hours, but they really

32:20.500 --> 32:23.340
improved on that Phoebus event, which was a similar thing.

32:23.340 --> 32:26.040
Um, a couple of months ago they did, they really improved on it.

32:26.040 --> 32:29.140
Like the quests were much more manageable and it was nice that they kind of changed

32:29.140 --> 32:30.620
the spawns during that time as well.

32:30.620 --> 32:34.500
So I caught two shinies only getting to play for like an hour and a half.

32:34.500 --> 32:35.820
So I was pretty happy with it.

32:35.820 --> 32:40.940
Um, and, uh, I just wish, like, I don't want there to be a Pokemon go thing every freaking

32:40.940 --> 32:41.940
weekend.

32:41.940 --> 32:42.940
You know what I mean?

32:42.940 --> 32:46.140
Like, I don't, I wish they would just do like one weekend a month and that's it.

32:46.140 --> 32:51.620
You know, and then don't, don't give us more than like a few days before, you know, cause

32:51.620 --> 32:55.300
they only announced it on like Tuesday or Wednesday that, Hey, this Saturday is going

32:55.300 --> 32:56.300
to be a big event.

32:56.300 --> 32:57.300
And it's like, you know,

32:57.300 --> 33:01.140
Or do them at different times, like shuffle the times around to like,

33:01.140 --> 33:02.140
Be careful what you ask for.

33:02.140 --> 33:05.860
Cause that next community day, the next community day they're doing is Trico and it's going

33:05.860 --> 33:10.300
to be a March 23rd and it's from 3 PM to 6 PM.

33:10.300 --> 33:12.260
So they're doing it more in the evening.

33:12.260 --> 33:13.780
Well that's, and that's our time.

33:13.780 --> 33:16.180
So East coasters, that's going to be 6 PM to 9 PM.

33:16.180 --> 33:17.180
That's like at night.

33:17.180 --> 33:21.500
So it's going to be a little weird, I think, but here's, so a lot of people don't understand

33:21.500 --> 33:23.140
the why behind it.

33:23.140 --> 33:27.400
And I'm not saying this is the reason, but I am saying this is quite the coincidence.

33:27.400 --> 33:31.240
So their other game Niantic's other game, Ingress, which you all know I've followed

33:31.240 --> 33:32.420
for a long time.

33:32.420 --> 33:37.940
Um, Ingress is having a big, uh, what they call anomaly event, which is their live events.

33:37.940 --> 33:41.220
Now obviously they're not nearly as big as what happens in Pokemon go, but they are events

33:41.220 --> 33:44.900
that take that game's resources, um, in cities around the world.

33:44.900 --> 33:49.060
So in the U S it happens to be on that day, uh, funny enough, Atlanta, uh, where our pal

33:49.060 --> 33:52.420
Bobby's at is one of the cities and Las Vegas is the other.

33:52.420 --> 33:58.860
So that event runs from, I think it's 10 AM until either 1 PM or 2 PM.

33:58.860 --> 34:05.040
But that event is already in the block where, uh, community day would usually be.

34:05.040 --> 34:07.660
So how about you just don't do a community day next week?

34:07.660 --> 34:09.780
That's, I mean, that would have been my answer.

34:09.780 --> 34:13.460
Like I can't explain why they insist on doing them the same day, but I was going to say

34:13.460 --> 34:15.580
there's a lot of Ingersers that also play Pokemon go.

34:15.580 --> 34:19.060
That'd be kind of pissed because you really have to focus when it's anomaly time.

34:19.060 --> 34:22.220
Cause that's, you know, player, very, very intense player versus player stuff.

34:22.220 --> 34:23.220
Right.

34:23.220 --> 34:26.500
Um, so, uh, you don't want to be over there catching Pokemon.

34:26.500 --> 34:30.380
So they probably scattered out the times a little bit so people could do both, but why

34:30.380 --> 34:32.300
did they feel the need to do?

34:32.300 --> 34:35.140
I don't think any Ingress player would have been upset.

34:35.140 --> 34:37.940
And to be fair, there's far less Ingress players, Pokemon go players.

34:37.940 --> 34:38.980
I get that.

34:38.980 --> 34:42.700
But you also have to consider resources on Niantic system and so forth because lots of

34:42.700 --> 34:44.620
Ingress players will be logged in at that time.

34:44.620 --> 34:49.180
But anyway, um, I'm just surprised they just didn't do it a different, do it on the Sunday.

34:49.180 --> 34:53.940
You know, I was going to stop and say, Oh, I got to catch Trico because dude, it's Trico.

34:53.940 --> 34:54.940
Yeah.

34:54.940 --> 34:57.180
Uh, Bobby and Chad is asking Rob, so you flying out?

34:57.180 --> 34:58.180
No, no, I'm not.

34:58.180 --> 34:59.180
Nothing that great.

34:59.180 --> 35:05.500
Well, I guess maybe a little that crazy because it is why I am going to Chicago in may, uh,

35:05.500 --> 35:06.700
Memorial day weekend.

35:06.700 --> 35:10.620
They're doing a big event in Chicago, but the thing about Chicago that makes it special

35:10.620 --> 35:14.220
is that whereas I mentioned there's cities around the world in Las Vegas, Atlanta, or

35:14.220 --> 35:19.420
two of them in that weekend in may, Memorial day weekend in Chicago, that is the only one

35:19.420 --> 35:20.640
is Chicago.

35:20.640 --> 35:21.640
That's it.

35:21.640 --> 35:24.400
And then they're doing another mega anomaly in Asia somewhere.

35:24.400 --> 35:25.740
One of the other weekends.

35:25.740 --> 35:28.500
So um, that's part of the reason I'm going to Chicago.

35:28.500 --> 35:31.140
And the fact I just know like people in Chicago always have a good time there.

35:31.140 --> 35:36.020
So um, yeah, anyway, I didn't mean to digress an Ingress tangent, but I guess I did.

35:36.020 --> 35:40.220
But it also, I think explains why maybe they're changing things up in Pokemon go.

35:40.220 --> 35:44.580
Um, other games I played this week, uh, I've continued to play things like world of Warcraft,

35:44.580 --> 35:50.140
of course, and kingdom hearts three at Tetris 99 is still fun for me.

35:50.140 --> 35:54.820
Um, but I did play some, well, I played some old stuff and some new stuff.

35:54.820 --> 35:56.180
So here's the old thing.

35:56.180 --> 36:00.380
So my buddy Delvin or VG realness, uh, who's probably in chat right now.

36:00.380 --> 36:06.140
I saw a minute ago, uh, convinced me to start a fantasy star online character.

36:06.140 --> 36:07.140
Yes.

36:07.140 --> 36:13.380
Fancy star online from like 2000, uh, which I think blue burst went offline in like 2007.

36:13.380 --> 36:17.780
But of course, thanks to the wonders of homegrown servers and how they, so there's still servers

36:17.780 --> 36:20.140
where you can play fantasy star online to this day.

36:20.140 --> 36:25.740
Um, like the dream cast one, uh, this one's, this one's all powered on, I'm sure that exists,

36:25.740 --> 36:30.100
but the one I'm playing is all powered on blue burst, uh, the piece that they had, which

36:30.140 --> 36:33.660
is the same, it's the same game, but blue burst had episode four.

36:33.660 --> 36:37.980
So there's actually kind of like more, so the PC probably got the biggest version, so

36:37.980 --> 36:38.980
to speak.

36:38.980 --> 36:43.020
Um, so he convinced me to roll a character there and I was playing that actually Friday

36:43.020 --> 36:46.340
night on my personal stream over at Rob Roberts on Twitch.

36:46.340 --> 36:47.900
We went for like four hours.

36:47.900 --> 36:51.420
We were, I was playing like all night Friday, started a character from scratch, got all

36:51.420 --> 36:52.940
the way up to like level 11.

36:52.940 --> 36:53.940
We were having a good time.

36:53.940 --> 36:54.940
Bobby joined us for a little while.

36:54.940 --> 36:55.940
Uh, it was fun.

36:55.940 --> 36:56.940
Yeah.

36:56.940 --> 37:01.140
Um, we'll probably stream that again at some point because I, as much as I would like play

37:01.140 --> 37:06.340
fantasy star online, I would get through like forest, maybe a little bit of caves.

37:06.340 --> 37:07.820
I think I got to the third one.

37:07.820 --> 37:09.340
What's the third one ruins or something.

37:09.340 --> 37:15.380
I think I got as far as that, but like I've never actually beat fantasy star online.

37:15.380 --> 37:18.740
So Delvin's like, no, we're doing this.

37:18.740 --> 37:22.060
We're going to, we're going to, this is going to be a series on Twitch.

37:22.060 --> 37:23.460
We're going to beat this damn game.

37:23.460 --> 37:26.580
So I'm like, okay, I'm kind of into it because fantasy star is fun.

37:26.580 --> 37:29.520
Playing with friends is fun and talking and stuff is always a good time.

37:29.520 --> 37:30.900
So I've been enjoying that.

37:30.900 --> 37:36.460
So living it up like it's the year 2000, but I did play new stuff as well.

37:36.460 --> 37:37.460
Okay.

37:37.460 --> 37:42.620
So I finally, after all the talk about it for like three weeks, I went into my first

37:42.620 --> 37:44.300
apex legends matches.

37:44.300 --> 37:45.300
Okay.

37:45.300 --> 37:49.100
So I did it not only on PlayStation four, but I also played on PC.

37:49.100 --> 37:54.180
So I did, um, I did a match on each and, uh, it was, it was funny.

37:54.180 --> 37:58.100
You know what the, on the PlayStation four match I did, we came in fourth.

37:58.100 --> 37:59.100
Not bad.

37:59.100 --> 38:00.100
Right.

38:00.100 --> 38:01.100
Out of like 20 teams.

38:01.100 --> 38:02.100
So here's the thing.

38:02.100 --> 38:06.380
So like I noticed because I was a level one player, I was getting matched with people

38:06.380 --> 38:11.900
on my squad that were like level 24, level 26, like I was getting matched with like high

38:11.900 --> 38:12.900
level people.

38:12.900 --> 38:13.900
Right.

38:13.900 --> 38:17.860
So I was just like, I'm just going to follow and like what I thought was so, so I played

38:17.860 --> 38:22.140
lifeline when I played on PlayStation four and, um, I was just like, it's like, you are

38:22.140 --> 38:23.140
the jump master.

38:23.140 --> 38:24.140
I was like, the fuck I am.

38:24.140 --> 38:26.580
I, I, cause there's a button you can press to pass it to somebody else.

38:26.580 --> 38:27.900
I'm like, I don't know where to land us.

38:27.900 --> 38:29.520
So that's the nice thing is you can pass somebody else.

38:29.520 --> 38:33.140
But I will say one thing I really did like about apex legends, nobody was really talking

38:33.140 --> 38:36.100
at all on the headsets, which is fine because people could be shitty.

38:36.100 --> 38:38.180
Um, but they were using that ping.

38:38.180 --> 38:41.260
Like it was like, I was like, they like were paying and everything paying.

38:41.260 --> 38:42.260
There's a gun over here.

38:42.260 --> 38:43.260
Ping.

38:43.260 --> 38:46.260
And the nice way it's built into the game is that the characters like talk about the

38:46.260 --> 38:48.060
pings, you know, and so forth.

38:48.060 --> 38:52.060
And like, let's say somebody pinged a gun, like bloodhound might go like, there's a gun

38:52.060 --> 38:53.060
over here.

38:53.060 --> 38:54.940
However, bloodhounds accents, very unique.

38:54.940 --> 38:56.780
Uh, you know, it says like, there's going to be here.

38:56.780 --> 39:00.800
And then if you go pick up the gun, you can, you'll say, press down to thank bloodhound

39:00.800 --> 39:01.800
and see press down.

39:01.800 --> 39:03.420
And then, you know, lifeline will be like, thank you.

39:03.420 --> 39:05.340
I needed that or whatever, you know, she says.

39:05.340 --> 39:07.500
So it was kind of, kind of fun in that regard.

39:07.500 --> 39:12.260
So yeah, all I did, I just kind of like, I just ran with my, I was just like, okay, when

39:12.260 --> 39:14.100
you're a new player, just stick with your squad.

39:14.100 --> 39:15.100
Right.

39:15.100 --> 39:18.100
That's the thing that annoys veteran players is when new people get in there and think

39:18.100 --> 39:20.060
like, just run off crazy.

39:20.060 --> 39:21.060
So I stayed with my people.

39:21.060 --> 39:22.060
I don't wait.

39:22.060 --> 39:26.020
I was like, okay, when I see people show up, I'll put down the little drone and we did

39:26.020 --> 39:27.020
okay for ourselves.

39:27.020 --> 39:30.940
I got to say, I got to give props to the, the Wraith and our match because it was me,

39:30.940 --> 39:35.580
a bloodhound or lifeline bloodhound Wraith and myself and bloodhound died.

39:35.580 --> 39:40.560
Wraith fucking went back, saved us when all the way to one of those respawn points to

39:40.560 --> 39:42.500
bring us back into the match.

39:42.500 --> 39:43.500
Like she was a rock star.

39:43.500 --> 39:47.620
She brought us back like, and then we were able to, that's how we got fourth place because

39:47.620 --> 39:51.140
pretty much she was sneaking around everything to get to the respawn thing and got us back

39:51.140 --> 39:54.180
in the match after like four more teams have been eliminated.

39:54.180 --> 39:55.180
So that was kind of fun.

39:55.180 --> 39:56.180
Right.

39:56.180 --> 39:58.380
And the way I'm talking about it, it's kind of like a sports match or something.

39:58.380 --> 39:59.380
So it was fun.

39:59.380 --> 40:04.720
I played it on PC that time I played as bloodhound because I'm, I want to see, I want to see

40:04.720 --> 40:05.980
some different abilities.

40:05.980 --> 40:07.660
And I heard the tracking thing was pretty cool.

40:07.660 --> 40:11.540
And a good thing for new players to do is that you can just keep spamming that tracking

40:11.540 --> 40:12.540
thing.

40:12.540 --> 40:13.540
And it's actually kind of helpful for people.

40:13.540 --> 40:16.320
So I was like, all right, I'll try this with bloodhound, but my experience didn't go as

40:16.320 --> 40:22.940
well on PC because the, the jump master kept launching us back in air and like would not

40:22.940 --> 40:24.360
find a place to land.

40:24.360 --> 40:26.960
And then of course, all of a sudden they got on the mic and then of course the two of them

40:26.960 --> 40:31.840
got on the microphones and it was like, dude, what the fuck you're going to fucking land

40:31.840 --> 40:32.900
this fucking thing.

40:32.900 --> 40:35.900
What the fuck are you doing?

40:35.900 --> 40:40.180
As people do, you know, when they go, when it's like when this microphone ends up in

40:40.180 --> 40:43.500
their mouth, it's just instantly there, they, they go to shit.

40:43.500 --> 40:44.500
And that's it.

40:44.500 --> 40:47.700
So I tried to kind of do the same thing and I stuck with the team, but of course the two

40:47.700 --> 40:50.020
of them were fighting and it was just ugly.

40:50.020 --> 40:51.800
And how about this, Loki?

40:51.800 --> 40:54.420
We came in 16th.

40:54.420 --> 40:59.140
Imagine that, yeah.

40:59.140 --> 41:03.740
So when everything was polite and using pings and they were helping me out, we get forth

41:03.740 --> 41:09.100
when everybody's like, it's 16th, irritating.

41:09.100 --> 41:10.100
Anyway.

41:10.100 --> 41:11.100
All right.

41:11.100 --> 41:16.340
Uh, going to our chat over Twitch TV, uh, slash vog network, uh, Miltonias game says,

41:16.340 --> 41:19.740
I love that lifeline can drop helpful gear us for special power.

41:19.740 --> 41:21.700
I can help while being bad.

41:21.700 --> 41:27.020
Have you noticed that apex really pushes you to play lifeline?

41:27.020 --> 41:28.440
Like and I think that's smart.

41:28.440 --> 41:34.740
Like the game teaches you to start as a support character cause you play lifeline in the tutorial.

41:34.740 --> 41:38.260
Lifeline is like your default character and your profile and all this.

41:38.260 --> 41:43.580
Like the game really pushes the healer on you and she's not, I mean like you, it's not

41:43.580 --> 41:48.660
like, it's not like you're playing, um, overwatch and like you're attacking is completely like

41:48.660 --> 41:49.660
negated.

41:49.660 --> 41:52.260
Like you can still fire a gun as lifeline.

41:52.260 --> 41:55.960
It's just her ability is more around the healing and the special drops and all that.

41:55.960 --> 41:59.600
So the game really pushes you to want to like lifeline, which I think is really smart and

41:59.600 --> 42:01.340
probably part of the reason it's doing well.

42:01.340 --> 42:02.940
Um, let's see.

42:02.940 --> 42:06.800
And a metal mayhem says, Hey now race and all star gets, Oh God, he's quoting lyrics

42:06.800 --> 42:07.800
from smash mouth.

42:08.240 --> 42:12.940
Uh, and then it says, I had a roommate in college put on academic probation because

42:12.940 --> 42:15.240
he skipped class to play PSL.

42:15.240 --> 42:16.320
That was a million years ago.

42:16.320 --> 42:18.080
He somehow graduated in the end.

42:18.080 --> 42:20.060
Do you know like fantasy star online has come up?

42:20.060 --> 42:22.960
Like not just on the Twitch chat, but in some of the group chats and so forth.

42:22.960 --> 42:27.120
Do you know how many people I've talked to that are like, Oh yeah, I flunked XYZ because

42:27.120 --> 42:30.600
of PSL like fantasy star online, like ruined lives.

42:30.600 --> 42:33.500
It's pretty impressive, pretty impressive.

42:33.500 --> 42:35.840
So anyway, there it is.

42:35.840 --> 42:40.600
Uh, some old stuff and some new stuff and I had a fun week and I will continue to play

42:40.600 --> 42:42.200
more in the coming weeks.

42:42.200 --> 42:43.200
Yes.

42:43.200 --> 42:44.820
So, all right, well, let's move on.

42:44.820 --> 42:45.860
Let's get to some more gaming news.

42:45.860 --> 42:47.440
I don't really have a lot of housekeeping.

42:47.440 --> 42:51.160
You should continue to follow us on Twitch, Twitch, of course, at VOG network, Twitter

42:51.160 --> 42:52.160
as well.

42:52.160 --> 42:56.040
Uh, at OLR is where our Twitter account is that we're also on Facebook, facebook.com

42:56.040 --> 42:58.600
slash orange lounge radio.

42:58.600 --> 43:01.160
So let's get to some more gaming news.

43:01.160 --> 43:02.160
Yes.

43:02.160 --> 43:06.480
So there's an announcement from Google that's going to happen during GDC.

43:06.480 --> 43:14.280
Um, it's on the 19th, they've got a little animated, um, image that they're talking about.

43:14.280 --> 43:19.480
It's kind of like teasing this mysterious announcement, basically saying, you know,

43:19.480 --> 43:26.620
gather around, uh, all will be explained on three 19 and of course this is expected to

43:26.620 --> 43:31.660
be their announcement of their new, um, gaming platform.

43:31.660 --> 43:35.780
So it could be a console or whatever, uh, some code name yeti.

43:35.780 --> 43:41.180
And they've kind of dabbled with gaming stuff before with, um, they had the whole experiment

43:41.180 --> 43:46.180
with assassin's creed, odyssey, the could stream in the Chrome browser type thing.

43:46.180 --> 43:50.940
Um, so maybe it has something to do with that, but I guess we'll find out in about a month.

43:50.940 --> 43:53.780
It's only, it's not that long.

43:53.780 --> 43:58.020
So it kind of neat to see what this will be.

43:58.020 --> 43:59.020
Any thoughts?

43:59.020 --> 44:00.820
I know everybody's playing armchair.

44:00.820 --> 44:01.820
I don't know.

44:01.820 --> 44:06.220
My thought is I'm going to be underwhelmed because it always tends to be like whenever

44:06.220 --> 44:10.740
one of these platforms comes out with, Oh, Hey, we're going to do some gaming thing.

44:10.740 --> 44:11.740
You know what?

44:11.740 --> 44:17.820
Whether it be like games center on the iOS and whatever Android has on the Google side

44:17.820 --> 44:20.140
of things, Google play games or something like that.

44:20.140 --> 44:23.780
It's just very, eh, achievements.

44:23.780 --> 44:24.780
Yay.

44:24.780 --> 44:28.060
It's like, don't really care.

44:28.540 --> 44:36.180
Um, I hope it's cool, but I, I'm, my level of expectation is around Ouya Ouya level.

44:36.180 --> 44:41.020
Well, I mean, one of the theories running around out there is that Google might be starting

44:41.020 --> 44:44.940
their own types of game service, which tying into the beginning, you know, segment of our

44:44.940 --> 44:47.420
show might not be such a bad idea.

44:47.420 --> 44:49.180
It just depends on the quality of games.

44:49.180 --> 44:56.380
Like if Google streaming games is like Farmville and match three tournament and solitaire,

44:56.380 --> 45:00.100
I don't know if it's going to be very compelling, but if Google can sign up some partners of

45:00.100 --> 45:03.420
some big games that people want to play, it might be a little more impressive.

45:03.420 --> 45:07.180
But of course, you know, bandwidth is always a concern with the streaming stuff.

45:07.180 --> 45:11.220
We didn't really get into that earlier, but a comment in our chat, a pixel pocket says

45:11.220 --> 45:14.820
the projects stream thing worked surprisingly well.

45:14.820 --> 45:18.740
If everyone had no data caps and high speed internet, that it would be a massive game

45:18.740 --> 45:19.740
changer.

45:19.740 --> 45:23.080
And Bobby Blackwell follows that up saying bandwidth caps are going to be a big issue

45:23.080 --> 45:25.180
and not many people talk about it.

45:25.220 --> 45:31.220
Well, until we push back on the cable companies for what we want and get those data caps inflated.

45:31.220 --> 45:36.300
I think eventually once we get, you know, some Democratic leadership that we'll get

45:36.300 --> 45:40.020
them outlawing data caps and that kind of stuff, it's just unfortunately, we just have

45:40.020 --> 45:42.580
like the whole I don't even know if it has to be a political thing.

45:42.580 --> 45:46.780
I think the political thing has to fix that whole issue with the net neutrality.

45:46.780 --> 45:52.340
But I digress the whole when it comes to data caps, I think ultimately consumers are going

45:52.340 --> 45:56.820
to be like, this is bullshit because of all these things that are around the popular place.

45:56.820 --> 46:00.780
Like, you know, I remember when data caps were like a lot smaller, especially on cell

46:00.780 --> 46:01.780
phones.

46:01.780 --> 46:02.780
Right.

46:02.780 --> 46:03.780
Because they're like, right.

46:03.780 --> 46:05.300
Nobody uses over two gigs in a month.

46:05.300 --> 46:06.380
Nobody uses two gigs in a month.

46:06.380 --> 46:08.420
And that was like three years ago, four years ago.

46:08.420 --> 46:11.140
Now it's like nobody uses more than 10 gigs in a month.

46:11.140 --> 46:16.260
And of course, when I went and checked my usage on AT&T, I use 18 gigs in a month.

46:16.260 --> 46:18.340
So thankfully I have unlimited.

46:18.340 --> 46:19.340
That's yeah.

46:19.340 --> 46:20.340
That's a lot.

46:20.340 --> 46:25.380
But dude, Spotify and podcasts in the car, Ingress and Pokemon go a lot, which is always

46:25.380 --> 46:26.380
downloading data.

46:26.380 --> 46:27.380
Right.

46:27.380 --> 46:28.380
Uh, you know, listening to music.

46:28.380 --> 46:32.780
If I'm in my desk at work and streaming from there, uh, you know, you use a lot of data.

46:32.780 --> 46:35.460
I'm always usually on wifi, so I don't tend to use that.

46:35.460 --> 46:36.460
I don't.

46:36.460 --> 46:37.940
My wifi, wifi at work is non-existent.

46:37.940 --> 46:38.940
I have to be on.

46:38.940 --> 46:39.940
Yeah.

46:39.940 --> 46:44.060
So yeah, but I pay for it.

46:44.060 --> 46:45.580
You sold me an unlimited plan.

46:45.580 --> 46:46.820
I'm going to cash in.

46:46.820 --> 46:48.100
I'm not pirating or anything.

46:48.100 --> 46:50.260
I'm just, you know, a heavy user.

46:50.260 --> 46:55.940
So anyway, um, well, could Google, Google, I brought up cell phones.

46:55.940 --> 46:57.980
Google's in the cell phone arena.

46:57.980 --> 47:01.540
Do you think they might do something with like, I don't know, something where it's like,

47:01.540 --> 47:06.300
Oh, it's on your computer and it's on your phone through the new, you know, probably

47:06.300 --> 47:09.860
I think if anything, they're going to do something integrated into Chrome.

47:09.860 --> 47:13.940
Um, so yeah, I could see them doing that.

47:13.940 --> 47:14.940
I don't know.

47:15.580 --> 47:19.340
I actually be curious to see, I didn't actually get the play, uh, Assassin's Creed Odyssey

47:19.340 --> 47:20.980
when they had that in Chrome.

47:20.980 --> 47:27.420
So I don't know what the hardware requirements are for that type of stuff, but I mean, I

47:27.420 --> 47:28.420
don't know.

47:28.420 --> 47:29.420
We'll see.

47:29.420 --> 47:33.140
It has to have something that I'm really interested in and just a lot of these like platforms

47:33.140 --> 47:34.220
that they come out with.

47:34.220 --> 47:37.720
It's just kind of like, I don't really need another platform to play like Assassin's Creed

47:37.720 --> 47:42.620
Odyssey on or, you know, whatever else is going to be on there.

47:42.620 --> 47:44.940
Like I have a huge steam library.

47:44.940 --> 47:49.340
Give me something that I really want that makes it, you know, really accessible for

47:49.340 --> 47:50.340
me to play.

47:50.340 --> 47:54.180
Like I, for example, would love Xbox game pass.

47:54.180 --> 48:00.420
If I could play my Xbox three 60 backwards compatible games on the PC would be pretty

48:00.420 --> 48:01.420
awesome.

48:01.420 --> 48:06.940
You kind of can because you use the whole, like, um, you go into the Xbox app and you

48:06.940 --> 48:09.940
stream from your Xbox one to your PC.

48:09.940 --> 48:10.940
I've done that.

48:10.940 --> 48:14.540
I've played like dungeon siege three on my PC, but it's, it's really playing it on the

48:14.540 --> 48:15.540
Xbox one.

48:15.540 --> 48:19.420
I've tried doing that with my PlayStation four, although I haven't tried with the pro

48:19.420 --> 48:20.420
yet though.

48:20.420 --> 48:24.500
So I mean, that might work a little bit better with the pro, but before my original PlayStation

48:24.500 --> 48:29.700
four, I tried doing that and it was mixed from just kind of like, okay.

48:29.700 --> 48:36.300
And working to, it's just not working at all on my internal network in, I mean, my PlayStation's

48:36.300 --> 48:41.740
wired directly to the router and I mean, I don't think there was that much bandwidth

48:41.740 --> 48:42.940
traffic going on.

48:42.940 --> 48:48.820
There's Netflix, but I mean, that shouldn't be clogging up my, you know, network that

48:48.820 --> 48:49.820
much, but who knows?

48:49.820 --> 48:52.900
I think bandwidth caps are going to go up again in a couple of years.

48:52.900 --> 48:58.120
I just, I would, I would hope more providers are able to provide internet when that element

48:58.120 --> 49:02.700
gets more competitive, which it very well might as over the air speeds and five G and

49:02.700 --> 49:03.700
stuff.

49:03.700 --> 49:05.340
I mean, five G is supposedly really, really fast.

49:05.380 --> 49:08.500
I haven't been able to use it myself yet, but five G supposedly like, so waiting and

49:08.500 --> 49:11.860
fast for fucking Verizon to get out of Sacramento to do it.

49:11.860 --> 49:15.780
So it's, well, you mean out, out into the suburbs of Sacramento, apparently downtown.

49:15.780 --> 49:16.780
Yes.

49:16.780 --> 49:17.780
Yeah.

49:17.780 --> 49:20.800
But, um, yeah, but as that stuff becomes more and more, and maybe I think that's when finally

49:20.800 --> 49:25.220
there's going to be more competition for companies like Comcast and your, your more traditional

49:25.220 --> 49:29.900
broadband providers is when it's so fast in the air that it competes with that.

49:29.900 --> 49:34.940
And then that's when all that discussion on data caps and stuff will have to be reevaluated,

49:34.940 --> 49:35.940
I suppose.

49:35.940 --> 49:36.940
Yeah.

49:36.940 --> 49:37.940
So we'll see.

49:37.940 --> 49:38.940
Anyway.

49:38.940 --> 49:45.180
Um, going into our chat at Twitch TV slash vog network, uh, Bobby points out Loki.

49:45.180 --> 49:46.260
It depends on your router.

49:46.260 --> 49:49.640
Some routers can't handle multiple streams like that and others can.

49:49.640 --> 49:52.700
So if someone else is streaming Netflix and you're trying to do share play between a PS

49:52.700 --> 49:57.540
four and PC, some routers don't have the CPU to be able to accurately handle that.

49:57.540 --> 49:58.540
That is very true.

49:58.540 --> 49:59.900
And I am streaming from the Xbox one.

49:59.900 --> 50:01.740
It's like, don't try to do anything else on the internet.

50:01.740 --> 50:06.460
Oh, I thought I had a pretty decent router, but I could always get one with more antennas

50:06.460 --> 50:07.460
on it.

50:07.460 --> 50:09.620
It doesn't look gamer enough yet.

50:09.620 --> 50:10.780
Yeah, it doesn't look gamer enough.

50:10.780 --> 50:15.380
Uh, and then a DJ Ram S in chat says, looks at Verizon router bandwidth caps.

50:15.380 --> 50:16.380
What's that?

50:16.380 --> 50:17.380
So, yeah, there you go.

50:17.380 --> 50:18.380
All right.

50:18.380 --> 50:19.520
Anyhow, let's move on to another story.

50:19.520 --> 50:21.580
And I know a lot of people are talking about this this week.

50:21.580 --> 50:25.860
I'm sure you guys have heard of this, but, uh, it was announced by Reggie fees and may,

50:25.860 --> 50:31.020
uh, on a special, uh, little, uh, announcement on their Twitter channel and YouTube and all

50:31.020 --> 50:34.340
that, uh, that Reggie fees and may plans to retire, uh, Reggie fees and may has been

50:34.340 --> 50:37.380
with Nintendo for 15 years, if you can believe it.

50:37.380 --> 50:42.040
Uh, and he is going to be retiring and, uh, the current senior vice president of sales

50:42.040 --> 50:47.700
and marketing, uh, Doug Bowser will succeed Reggie as the president of Nintendo of America.

50:47.700 --> 50:52.900
I'm sure you have heard the whole Bowser taking over Nintendo memes to death.

50:52.900 --> 50:57.300
So I will only bug you with that, that one time, although, you know, it is, it's kind

50:57.300 --> 50:59.980
of one of those, Oh, that's cute, but you know, it is.

50:59.980 --> 51:02.300
It is an actual like German last name and stuff.

51:02.300 --> 51:06.160
So, you know, it's not like, I don't think he was picked for his name that he was picked

51:06.160 --> 51:08.580
for his town, but he is leaning into it though.

51:08.580 --> 51:10.020
Well, yeah, he has fun.

51:10.020 --> 51:11.020
Sure.

51:11.020 --> 51:13.020
And I think when you're in a situation like that, you should have fun with it.

51:13.020 --> 51:14.020
Right.

51:14.020 --> 51:17.740
And you know, like when Doug Bowser was first tired, there was that picture of him on Twitter

51:17.740 --> 51:18.900
and he's like, I'm happy to be here.

51:18.900 --> 51:19.900
He's like holding a sign.

51:19.900 --> 51:24.640
If you look very subtly, it's very subtle in the background, but there's a stuffed animals

51:24.640 --> 51:28.980
or like whatever you call stuff, figures stuff, plushes of Mario and Luigi tied up with a

51:28.980 --> 51:30.500
GameCube controller.

51:30.500 --> 51:31.500
That's funny.

51:31.500 --> 51:34.980
That's, I love that like subtleness where it's like, you look twice, you got to look

51:34.980 --> 51:36.220
a little deeper to see that.

51:36.220 --> 51:41.120
So, and I'm sure, I'm sure in a Nintendo direct or something, there'll be something very tongue

51:41.120 --> 51:43.180
and cheek, but let's not forget.

51:43.180 --> 51:50.100
Nintendo is still very much a Japanese country, the country, you know what I mean?

51:50.100 --> 51:51.100
Company.

51:51.100 --> 51:52.100
Thank you.

51:52.100 --> 51:54.900
Uh, it's still very much a Japanese company and all the big, big decisions are being made

51:54.900 --> 52:00.060
in Japan and what, you know, Reggie Fils-Aime has been doing, very charismatic, great leader

52:00.060 --> 52:05.260
for the US and helping to get switch systems sold in the US.

52:05.260 --> 52:07.580
That is what Reggie Fils-Aime's job has been.

52:07.580 --> 52:10.020
And that's what, um, Doug Bowser will be doing.

52:10.020 --> 52:15.740
Um, of course the folks over in Japan, happy to see him go, uh, Shuntaro Furukawa, who

52:15.740 --> 52:18.860
is the current president of Nintendo said, I really appreciate everything Reggie has

52:18.860 --> 52:21.140
done for Nintendo inside and outside our company.

52:21.140 --> 52:23.000
Reggie is known as an exceptional leader.

52:23.000 --> 52:26.800
We are grateful that he is leaving the business in good shape with strong momentum.

52:26.800 --> 52:30.400
While we will miss him and we wish him the very best in his retirement, what we are also

52:30.400 --> 52:33.800
pleased to have such an able successor ready to step into that role.

52:33.800 --> 52:39.080
Uh, and then Reggie in his own comments said, quote, Nintendo owns a part of my heart forever.

52:39.080 --> 52:43.160
It's a part that is filled with gratitude for the incredibly talented people I've worked

52:43.160 --> 52:47.040
with for the opportunity to represent such a wonderful brand and most of all, to feel

52:47.040 --> 52:51.280
like a member of the world's most positive and enduring gamer community.

52:51.280 --> 52:54.960
As I look forward to departing in both good health and good humor, this is not game over

52:54.960 --> 53:00.440
for me, but instead leveling up to more time with my wife, family, and friends.

53:00.440 --> 53:03.480
And you know, uh, he's going out at the top of his game.

53:03.480 --> 53:07.720
You know, it might be a little different story if this was during some of the Wii U years.

53:07.720 --> 53:11.000
I don't think, I don't think it really would be that different because Reggie Fils-Aime

53:11.000 --> 53:15.120
has always really kind of been very liked as I think a charismatic leader by gamers

53:15.120 --> 53:16.120
and so forth.

53:16.120 --> 53:20.560
So I think no matter when he decided he was ready to move on, uh, he, he would have gotten

53:20.560 --> 53:21.560
a warm reception.

53:21.560 --> 53:26.240
But certainly, you know, if he does decide he wants to do more in the future, he's going

53:26.240 --> 53:29.800
out on the top of his game and this is a great thing, you know, in his resume that, you know,

53:29.800 --> 53:32.200
I left when the switch was a all time success.

53:32.200 --> 53:37.480
Um, keep in mind, Reggie Fils-Aime has not always been games, uh, before he was at Nintendo.

53:37.480 --> 53:38.480
I believe it was at Panda express.

53:38.480 --> 53:41.800
I don't know if that was the immediate thing, but it was certainly at some point before

53:41.800 --> 53:49.800
there, he was, uh, uh, uh, I think he was at, uh, PEP was it Pepsi or young foods or

53:49.800 --> 53:50.800
anything?

53:50.800 --> 53:51.800
Perhaps.

53:51.800 --> 53:52.800
I don't know.

53:52.800 --> 53:56.000
I just remember that Panda, but, but anyway, I mean, you know, I, and everybody's like,

53:56.000 --> 54:01.220
I wonder why he's leaving and there's a part of me that says, how many of you have stayed

54:01.220 --> 54:02.960
at jobs for 15 years?

54:02.960 --> 54:04.240
He's been there for 15 years.

54:04.240 --> 54:05.240
I've gotten close.

54:05.240 --> 54:07.320
I was at my last job for 14 years.

54:07.320 --> 54:09.120
That's 14 and a half at my last job.

54:09.120 --> 54:10.120
Yeah.

54:10.120 --> 54:11.120
Got close.

54:11.120 --> 54:12.680
But you know, even then it was like about the time where you're like, all right, I really

54:12.680 --> 54:14.880
like, you know, the signs are in the air and it was one of those things where I was like,

54:14.880 --> 54:16.120
I really need to go do something else.

54:16.120 --> 54:17.280
And so I did.

54:17.280 --> 54:22.420
And you know, for whatever reason, like I doubt, I doubt it's anything negative at all.

54:22.420 --> 54:26.600
You know, Reggie, maybe he wants to do something that's not video games, you know, even you

54:26.600 --> 54:30.320
can be a gaming fan and like things that aren't video games, right?

54:30.320 --> 54:31.320
Yeah.

54:31.320 --> 54:35.720
I do this gaming podcast, but I do hosting for, you know, performance shows and things

54:35.720 --> 54:36.720
like that.

54:36.720 --> 54:39.560
So, you know, it's gaming doesn't have to be your end all be all.

54:39.560 --> 54:44.400
So maybe he'll want to start his own company or maybe he'll want to go to a different industry

54:44.400 --> 54:45.400
or something.

54:45.400 --> 54:49.440
Or maybe he really just, you know, I don't, I know he asked kids, I don't know how old

54:49.440 --> 54:50.600
they are.

54:50.600 --> 54:54.160
Maybe the kids are old enough to be having their own kids and he wants to be around for

54:54.160 --> 54:55.160
that.

54:55.160 --> 54:56.160
Or maybe he just wants to be around more.

54:56.160 --> 54:57.160
You know what?

54:57.160 --> 54:58.320
Let the man take a fucking vacation.

54:58.320 --> 54:59.320
He's earned it.

54:59.320 --> 55:00.320
Hats off to you, sir.

55:00.320 --> 55:01.320
Yeah.

55:01.320 --> 55:06.060
So I think it's just, you know, we, we all know, Oh yeah, this, this has to be something

55:06.060 --> 55:07.060
that happens someday.

55:07.060 --> 55:12.000
But then when that day a lot arrives, it's like, but why Reggie?

55:12.000 --> 55:15.040
Don't you love me anymore?

55:15.040 --> 55:19.680
But you know, he, his body is ready for vacation.

55:19.680 --> 55:21.560
Body is ready for a fucking vacation.

55:21.560 --> 55:22.760
That is absolutely right.

55:22.760 --> 55:24.340
Let the man live.

55:24.340 --> 55:29.480
So yeah, we can just hope he set a great example for everybody Gil, cause not every CEO in

55:29.480 --> 55:34.800
the game industry is looked at with such a favor and fandom as somebody like Reggie visa

55:34.800 --> 55:35.800
may.

55:35.800 --> 55:39.080
Um, cause can you imagine what it's going to be like when Bobby Kotek retires?

55:39.080 --> 55:42.740
Yeah, it's going to be great.

55:42.740 --> 55:43.740
He's never going to retire though.

55:43.740 --> 55:46.780
Cause he's making tons of fucking money.

55:46.780 --> 55:51.580
So anyway, he has to drive the rest of the properties into the ground, which honestly

55:51.580 --> 55:55.820
with Activision, there's not a lot left.

55:55.820 --> 56:01.180
Uh, DJ Rama S points out Pepsi and BET as the 200 Matt says he worked for pizza hut

56:01.180 --> 56:02.180
and Guinness.

56:02.180 --> 56:05.000
Did he really work all those places or you guys just make us, are you guys just saying

56:05.000 --> 56:08.660
all the cool things is PepsiCo and yum foods or whatever.

56:08.660 --> 56:09.660
That's all like one.

56:09.660 --> 56:10.660
Oh yeah, that's right.

56:10.660 --> 56:11.660
Pepsi owns all that stuff.

56:11.660 --> 56:12.660
That makes sense.

56:13.580 --> 56:14.580
Cool.

56:14.580 --> 56:18.460
All right, well, uh, hats off to Reggie and a best of luck, uh, in the future.

56:18.460 --> 56:22.780
And uh, you know, other CEOs should take some cues from Reggie on how to be cool.

56:22.780 --> 56:23.780
Super cool.

56:23.780 --> 56:24.780
Let's move on.

56:24.780 --> 56:25.780
What do you have for us next?

56:25.780 --> 56:26.780
Logie.

56:26.780 --> 56:27.780
All right.

56:27.780 --> 56:32.980
So, um, there's this whole new kind of beginning of another adpocalypse type thing.

56:32.980 --> 56:39.940
This was, um, due to this guy named Matt Watson who put out a viral video on YouTube, basically

56:39.940 --> 56:43.100
explaining that there's this content out there.

56:43.100 --> 56:48.500
It's of like kids like posting videos either like, um, you know, doing like gymnastics

56:48.500 --> 56:49.500
or something like that.

56:49.500 --> 56:55.980
And of course with that, there's these kind of pedo, uh, people that are watching these

56:55.980 --> 57:01.920
videos and timestamping, you know, compromising positions and just being generally assholes.

57:01.920 --> 57:07.520
And then of course those people also re uploading this content and sharing similar content with

57:07.520 --> 57:08.520
each other.

57:08.520 --> 57:14.120
So he's kind of like, Oh, exposing this, you know, whole, um, ring of stuff going on.

57:14.120 --> 57:20.800
And of course, you know, he's been also mailing out to, uh, or, you know, going on social

57:20.800 --> 57:26.600
media to show all these people that had like, um, ads run in front of it, the, Hey, look

57:26.600 --> 57:30.040
at this contents on here and YouTube's not doing anything, even though they are sort

57:30.040 --> 57:35.280
of work, you know, to get rid of it and doing it in the worst possible way as well.

57:35.280 --> 57:37.600
Um, so yeah, I got it.

57:37.600 --> 57:42.760
Well, I got to admit it's a tricky, it's a tricky thing because like, well, and I'm,

57:42.760 --> 57:45.760
I have not been reading up in the story, but like, you know, if you want to put your kids

57:45.760 --> 57:48.800
gymnastic match on YouTube, you should be able to do that right.

57:48.800 --> 57:55.000
And any sane person that, well, here's the problem, you know, so here's the YouTube solution

57:55.000 --> 57:57.940
by the way, and you're going to love this.

57:57.940 --> 58:02.960
So YouTube solution to solve this problem because they can't really figure it out is

58:02.960 --> 58:05.220
your video now can be demonetized.

58:05.220 --> 58:10.120
You could be following all of the rules completely by the book.

58:10.120 --> 58:14.580
Everything is a okay with your video, but if you have ass hats that are posting sicko

58:14.580 --> 58:19.420
shit in your, uh, YouTube comments, your video is going to get demonetized.

58:19.420 --> 58:22.020
No that can't be abused in any sort of fucking way.

58:22.020 --> 58:24.900
What, what's happening to the sickos posting the comments?

58:24.900 --> 58:29.940
Well, they're going to try to ban them, but at the same time, anybody can, well, they

58:29.940 --> 58:32.340
could recreate accounts and stuff.

58:32.340 --> 58:33.680
I mean, so I don't know.

58:33.680 --> 58:38.320
You could, you could basically use this new method now to just attack any channel you

58:38.320 --> 58:42.760
want to demonetize all their videos or to possibly, you know, do all sorts of strikes

58:42.760 --> 58:43.900
or whatever.

58:43.900 --> 58:46.320
So there's that fun bit of information.

58:46.320 --> 58:48.480
So that's their plan right now, which is terrible.

58:48.480 --> 58:54.760
Um, and then on top of that, all sorts of advertisers are pulling their ads from YouTube

58:54.760 --> 58:58.640
right now because I swear if you are one of these, not that anybody, any of those people

58:58.640 --> 59:02.840
would ever be watching this and thank God, but for those people that are doing this type

59:02.840 --> 59:07.840
of just sick shit and you know, some of them are doing it because it's sick and they're

59:07.840 --> 59:08.840
sick.

59:08.840 --> 59:11.220
Some of them are doing it for the lols.

59:11.220 --> 59:15.400
That isn't fucking funny and you deserve to have your computer swapped into submission

59:15.400 --> 59:17.280
with a baseball bat over and over again.

59:17.280 --> 59:21.440
If you are participating in this garbage, this is just, it's gross.

59:21.440 --> 59:26.480
It's kind of, okay, so let's, let's talk weaponizing it to get at people and stuff is great.

59:26.480 --> 59:27.480
Yeah.

59:27.480 --> 59:28.480
How does it have to do with games by the way?

59:28.480 --> 59:29.480
Well, we're getting there.

59:29.480 --> 59:32.800
So like there's been several, several companies, something that has nothing to do with games.

59:32.800 --> 59:33.760
Yeah.

59:33.760 --> 59:38.240
So several companies have already pulled their ads from YouTube, including like Disney.

59:38.240 --> 59:44.080
One of them, of course, Epic games have pulled their ads and those of course mostly ads for

59:44.080 --> 59:49.080
Fortnite and so they have pulled it because they're in talks right now with YouTube to

59:49.080 --> 59:55.680
see if they can, what's YouTube doing to fix this algorithm problem that they have with

59:55.680 --> 59:59.440
basically, if you do find these videos and you click on a couple of them, that's all

59:59.440 --> 01:00:01.600
you get in your feed is these like videos.

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:07.720
It makes it very easy for somebody to find that content.

01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:09.920
So right now they're trying to figure out what they can do.

01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:15.560
They've banned, YouTube's banned channels, they've, you know, um, demonetized other channels,

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:16.920
reported some things to the police.

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:18.920
They said, um, I have an idea.

01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:19.920
I have an idea.

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:20.920
I know how to fix it.

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:21.920
I know how to fix it.

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:22.920
Ready?

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:23.920
Ready?

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:24.920
Delete the comments.

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:25.920
Done.

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:26.920
Problem solved.

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:27.920
Delete the comments, YouTube.

01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:28.920
Delete them.

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:29.920
We don't know.

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:30.920
What good are YouTube comments doing?

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:37.800
It is showing, um, I guess, what was it?

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:44.980
It's showing what they call it, um, I don't remember what it's called.

01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:50.320
It's showing how many viewers are actually interacting with the content creators on there.

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:56.320
And it's, um, it's for a way to monetize or basically show that this person is getting

01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:03.440
more, um, like, I guess, focused views on their content or view thumbs up button would

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:04.440
be fine.

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:05.440
Subscriptions are fine.

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:10.160
Uh, a system like biddies where you could tip your favorite people would be fine.

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:11.400
All of that would be fine.

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:12.580
Why do we need comments?

01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:17.320
We don't need comments, or better yet, just like if you have a way to see which comments

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:20.320
are like bad, why don't you just delete those comments?

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:24.160
Let content creators screen all their comments before they go up.

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:25.280
Is that a thing YouTube can do?

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:27.640
I'm pretty sure you can maybe...

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:28.640
Can you?

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:30.760
I don't know if you can disable stuff.

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:32.200
Can you just make it moderate?

01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:34.200
Everything's moderated.

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:35.280
I don't know, but whatever.

01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:38.040
It's gonna be worse before it gets better.

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:42.240
The ironic part about this, though, is the guy who actually posted this, um...

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:44.240
Wait, I gotta read this comment.

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:45.240
Yeah.

01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:48.920
Uh, Metonius Games in chat says, comments are profitable to YouTube, but they will also

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:50.280
punish channels for it.

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:55.180
Well, that just goes to show YouTube would far punish the creators than publish to people

01:01:55.180 --> 01:01:56.780
actually causing the problem.

01:01:56.780 --> 01:02:00.700
Bobby in chat says, why do we need a chat room for this show?

01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:06.180
Um, great question, but I, because I love having the live chat and the interaction with

01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:11.160
people and so forth, but I will not hesitate for a moment to ban your ass if you cross

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.160
the line.

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:15.700
Hell, I just gave someone a time out for pulling the Smash Mouth stun on me.

01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:17.160
So you know what?

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:18.160
I will rain down.

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:23.800
I will rain down with fire upon you a great vengeance if, you know, you bring that garbage

01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:24.800
here.

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:28.760
I'd like to give most people the benefit of the doubt, but we have a lot of control over

01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:29.760
moderation.

01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:34.280
And if I'm not looking, Bobby Banhammer Black Wolf's looking and he won't hesitate to ban

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:35.280
that stuff.

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:36.960
And there's several other mods in there as well.

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:40.920
Well, the thing is too, okay, so like this is kind of the ironic part of it.

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:47.840
So, um, this Matt Watson guy, he's basically going out and pointing out this thing, thinking

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:49.280
that he's doing some good.

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:52.820
But I think it's actually for, he's trying to get his 15 minutes of fame.

01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:55.660
He was an ex YouTuber.

01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:58.660
So he started a new channel, posted this stuff.

01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:03.500
People found his old channel and he has questionable shit on there, including, I don't know if

01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:07.460
it's a skit or something, but it's basically him.

01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:11.380
I don't know, doing it for the lols, asking people if they would like to be in an adult

01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:12.660
video with him.

01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:19.120
And there's one shows him driving in a car, talking to a school aged child saying, hey,

01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:21.820
you want to be in an adult video with me?

01:03:21.820 --> 01:03:23.940
Just ridiculous stuff.

01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:29.220
So this is, this is the fun stuff that we get to deal with.

01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:30.220
Delete YouTube!

01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:31.220
Just delete it!

01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:32.220
Delete YouTube!

01:03:32.220 --> 01:03:33.220
Delete the whole site!

01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:37.220
Burn it to the ground!

01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:39.900
Yes, that is one way to do it.

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:41.320
Burn it with fire.

01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:46.040
I just think the whole thing is, between this and like, you know, even earlier this week

01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:51.140
we had a thing with The Verge where, you know, they were content striking people because

01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:54.180
they didn't like what someone was seeing in a video like that.

01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:58.940
You know, between abuses that are with the DMCA service, between now the way that people

01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:04.420
can harass or even destroy YouTube channels by, with harassing comments, because I know

01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:09.020
we have certain listeners, Xtifer for example, posting constantly on Twitter about all these

01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:14.080
hateful comments he gets on his videos, and that kind of stuff right there, that would

01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:18.140
demonetize his channel even if he's not doing anything wrong because of all the hateful

01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:22.500
comments that are, it's like, it's the whole platform is messed up.

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:27.300
So sorry, but important, I'm doing my finger wag because I have something important to

01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:28.300
say.

01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:29.300
Okay, ready?

01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:30.300
Okay.

01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:31.300
Didn't we just have a story?

01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:32.300
Well, hold on, hold on.

01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:33.300
I got to check.

01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:34.300
Hold on.

01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:35.300
We got to go.

01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:36.300
I need to scroll up one.

01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:37.300
We got to scroll up.

01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:38.300
Then I hit the button.

01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:39.300
Okay.

01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:40.300
Do we not just have a story?

01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:41.820
Google is about to be a GDC, right?

01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:42.820
We did.

01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:43.820
We did just talk about that, right?

01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:44.820
Yes.

01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:45.820
Google owns YouTube, right?

01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:46.820
Well, yeah.

01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:51.260
Is somebody going to be asking Google, like, if you can't run a functioning video website

01:04:51.260 --> 01:04:57.180
and moderate your shit, why were you going to trust you with a gaming console?

01:04:57.180 --> 01:05:00.060
I mean, what's it going to happen if they're going to have a storefront that they're not

01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:01.060
going to monitor?

01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:02.060
What?

01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:07.060
Then they're going to be Steam?

01:05:07.060 --> 01:05:13.180
So, anyways, so let's talk a little bit more about Fortnite though instead of YouTube.

01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:15.380
We'll switch topics here a little bit.

01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:20.260
So Fortnite had this, they had this event called Fortnite Live.

01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:21.260
Wait, sorry.

01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:24.100
I just want to read, because when there are good comments, I read them on air.

01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:26.180
That's another way you reinforce positivity, right?

01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:27.180
Right.

01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:28.260
You read the good stuff on air.

01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:32.020
Not to say that everything I don't read is bad, but just, you know, reinforcing the good

01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:33.020
stuff.

01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:37.700
So Karts1 in our chat says, YouTube needs to put more pressure on creators to maintain

01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:39.600
a healthy comment community.

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:44.820
It's so easy to set word filters and appoint other viewers to update said word filter delete

01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:46.100
toxic comments.

01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:51.040
So yeah, I think there has to be some type of onus on the content creators to foster

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:52.620
a positive community.

01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:57.300
However, as you pointed out, the way things are working at YouTube right now, like YouTube

01:05:57.300 --> 01:06:01.180
is also like blaming the content creators for all this.

01:06:01.180 --> 01:06:05.420
And it's also though, I don't know if they can really control it because some of these

01:06:05.420 --> 01:06:11.660
they're posting, like say for example, the one example they had is that their kid was,

01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:16.100
they're posting videos of his gymnastics stuff online, which is fine.

01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:20.060
You know, you can post videos of your kids online doing gymnastics, whatever that should

01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:21.240
be fine.

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:25.820
But then people were making comments on that stuff and that's not, I mean, that's bad enough.

01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:30.040
But then other times they were finding when they dug into the comments, you know, like

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:33.940
looking at these users and where they're commenting and stuff like that, they found that they're

01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:39.020
taking these videos, downloading them, re uploading them on their own channels and like

01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:40.740
talking about that shit elsewhere.

01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:44.860
So you're not even getting to the point where they can even monitor the comments that are

01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:47.820
on that video because it's being re uploaded and commented.

01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:52.140
Mom and dad who shot that video should be able to sue those other, but not that I'm

01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:57.220
all for like a sue happy America, but there ought to be some type of way you can go after

01:06:57.220 --> 01:07:00.340
that troll that steals that video.

01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:02.660
And of course, I guess, I don't know.

01:07:02.660 --> 01:07:03.660
I know.

01:07:03.660 --> 01:07:07.700
And now as I'm thinking through it in my head, they're going to be like, it's parody.

01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:11.900
It's done for parody and you put it on the Internet and I don't know.

01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:14.340
It's complicated, I guess.

01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:18.860
But just people need to fucking behave themselves online is so gross anyway.

01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:19.860
So anyways, more Fortnite.

01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:20.860
Yeah.

01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:26.660
So we're talking about Fortnite Live, which was an event that they held in Norwich.

01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:31.420
They were advertising it as the ultimate Fortnite battle royale.

01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:38.620
Apparently that they were selling tickets for between 12 and 20 pounds and they had

01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:42.300
just about 3000 kids show up.

01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:49.660
But apparently there was a lot of like misorganization.

01:07:49.660 --> 01:07:53.480
They described it as basically saying it was a terrible disaster.

01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:55.860
It was terrible and absolute disaster.

01:07:55.860 --> 01:07:56.860
Not like advertise.

01:07:56.860 --> 01:07:59.780
We went for the early bird, but some stuff was even set up.

01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:02.540
The best part about it was the event was the burger I had.

01:08:02.540 --> 01:08:04.180
My son wanted to leave.

01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:09.260
And as an organizer saying it went well, one absolute joke.

01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:10.260
It was awful.

01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:12.340
I have a very disappointed child.

01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:13.340
Yeah.

01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:20.460
And they're saying that there was some sort of like like merch that was just it was the

01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:21.460
Fyre Festival.

01:08:21.460 --> 01:08:25.680
Yeah, it was Gartner Festival Fortnite garbage and nobody learned anything from those documentaries.

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:30.520
And basically because it was garbage and because they were using the Fortnite name,

01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:34.900
Epic doesn't want to be at all associated with it.

01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:39.240
So they, of course, are going to be suing the organizers of this event.

01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:42.680
They said the quality of our player experience is incredibly important to us.

01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:48.680
And whether it's inside the game or an official public event like Fortnite Pro-Am, Epic Games

01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:52.240
was not in any way associated with the event that took place in Norwich.

01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:57.800
And we've issued a claim against the organization in the High Court of London.

01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:04.000
The proceedings by Epic Games, of course, you know, this is regarding their response.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.300
Very important question about the convention from our chat comment of the night here from

01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:09.900
Crystal Skies 80.

01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:12.020
Did it have a ball pit?

01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:13.560
I don't think it had a ball pit.

01:09:13.560 --> 01:09:14.560
Sorry.

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:17.360
No wonder you got your ass in court.

01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:21.880
Extra time in the ball pit.

01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:28.600
They're saying, you know, the so Epic Games, you know, that has forced the shutdown to

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:32.220
prebooked future Fortnite live events.

01:09:32.220 --> 01:09:37.960
These proceedings by Epic Games has had a catastrophic impact on the company's ability

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:46.800
to trade, which has forced exciting events limited to cease all trading activities immediately.

01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:51.400
And now they're seeking to limit the losses to third parties as soon as possible.

01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:55.420
Well, boohoo, maybe you don't use someone else's intellectual property for a shitty

01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:56.420
ass event.

01:09:56.420 --> 01:10:00.440
Yeah, I think Epic is kind of in the right here to, you know, say, hey, don't put your

01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:01.440
name.

01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:04.440
I mean, it's one thing if you're like a gaming celebration festival and you just heavily

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:05.440
feature Fortnite.

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:06.840
We get some of those like around here, too.

01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:11.180
There's like not a Minecon event, but it's like a Minecraft event.

01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:13.820
And it's just kind of put together by other people.

01:10:13.820 --> 01:10:16.720
They also do like some like Lego events and stuff like that.

01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:17.720
That's not officially Lego.

01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:19.880
But I don't think any of those events are this bad.

01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:20.880
No.

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:22.360
It's I think I knew people.

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:23.360
It's also smaller.

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:25.400
I think I know people that went to Minecraft when they had a good time, actually.

01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:27.080
So a little different.

01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:29.800
So but this is a little bit different with Fortnite and stuff.

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:30.800
Yeah.

01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:31.800
Mm hmm.

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:32.800
All right.

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:33.800
Oh, OK.

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:37.560
I need to cleanse the palate after some of those stories we just talked about because

01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:38.920
it was a little bit upsetting.

01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:40.860
So how about some rumors?

01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:45.520
How about we get into some rumors about, oh, look, here's the thing.

01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:46.880
I know how y'all feel about rumors.

01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:48.520
Some of you hate them.

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:53.120
But this is also a show to talk about what people are talking about around the table

01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:55.000
this week in gaming.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.360
And this is this is on fire on social media.

01:10:58.360 --> 01:10:59.960
Is this rumor?

01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:05.920
And it has to do with a rumor about regular meetings being held between Nintendo and the

01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:13.000
Xbox team, which could culminate with Ori and the Blind Forest, as well as the sequel,

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
The Wisping Woods or whatever that the ones called.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Sorry.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:23.320
Cuphead, Game Pass and X Cloud coming to the Nintendo Switch later in the year.

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:29.000
This is coming from a large gaming Web site in France, which is talking about all these

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.000
leaks.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
What would Game Pass entail though?

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:35.240
Like, I don't understand if they're not going to be games on the platform.

01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:36.240
What would that entail?

01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:37.240
It's streaming.

01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:42.280
If you're streaming the games through, do you stream with Game Pass or is it all downloads?

01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:45.280
There's two different systems on Microsoft.

01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:46.560
One of them is the streaming.

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:48.960
One of them is the download on demand.

01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:53.560
So with the streaming one, I thought that was all game probably butchering this all

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:54.560
right now.

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:55.560
Well, you know what?

01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:56.560
Let's figure it out.

01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:57.560
Can't you Google it?

01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:58.640
Google it while we read this story.

01:11:58.640 --> 01:11:59.640
You answer your own damn question.

01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:01.640
You don't want to answer my own.

01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:05.640
OK, well, I know we butchered it on a show before and we got an email about it.

01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:08.240
So I feel some type of onus to get it right this time.

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:10.680
So anyway, apparently the rumor goes on.

01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:14.920
There were several meetings in Redmond regarding the partnership or in the Blind Forest and

01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:20.680
Cuphead coming to the switch, which I mean, that makes a lot of sense, right?

01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:26.560
More than 100 Xbox games via Game Pass and or X Cloud before the end of the year.

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:29.920
So I guess there's two things going on there.

01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:30.920
Yeah.

01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:31.920
You download the games.

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:32.920
OK.

01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:33.920
OK.

01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:34.920
Well, maybe it wouldn't be like all the games.

01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:38.140
So maybe like Xbox 360 games, if they are, they already kind of like built this emulator

01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:39.140
thing.

01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:40.140
Maybe that would work.

01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:41.140
I don't know.

01:12:41.140 --> 01:12:44.300
Rare games possibly coming to the switch and so on and so on.

01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:47.020
You get where this is going.

01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:51.340
And going to chat over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network.

01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:52.340
Let's see.

01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:56.760
Miltonius Games says the Xbox app on switch is making much more sense.

01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:00.420
She Hulk says streaming is not up and running yet.

01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:03.260
So that must be what this X Cloud thing is all about.

01:13:03.260 --> 01:13:08.140
And so it would make a lot of sense that that would be the thing that would exist on the

01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:09.180
Nintendo switch.

01:13:09.180 --> 01:13:13.700
And maybe some people, like we're doing, are calling that Game Pass because they just assume

01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:14.700
it's kind of like the same.

01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:19.100
So is the X Cloud thing where I play like I can stream to my system?

01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:21.100
I believe that's what it's for.

01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:22.100
Right.

01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:24.860
No, like stream any game like on the Internet.

01:13:24.860 --> 01:13:30.060
And the switch does this with things like Assassin's Creed Odyssey and the Resident

01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:31.060
Evil 7.

01:13:31.060 --> 01:13:32.060
Yeah.

01:13:32.060 --> 01:13:33.060
Right.

01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:34.060
In Japan.

01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:37.380
It wasn't Xbox related, but it was Japan had that switch where it was all based on streaming.

01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:42.940
So maybe Microsoft saw that and was kind of like, hey, you know, and there's there's a

01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:49.020
lot about this that just like, I mean, it's a lot of fanwank, but it's also like, damn,

01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:51.180
this would be a good partnership.

01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:56.500
I mean, there's been fanwank for years about Nintendo and Microsoft getting in bed together.

01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:57.500
Part of what makes this.

01:13:57.500 --> 01:14:02.140
Can you imagine if we go one way, can we go the other way and get some Nintendo games

01:14:02.140 --> 01:14:04.220
on Xbox one?

01:14:04.220 --> 01:14:05.220
Who knows?

01:14:05.220 --> 01:14:06.220
Who knows?

01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:07.740
But I would sell me an Xbox one.

01:14:07.740 --> 01:14:08.780
I will say this.

01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:13.440
There are some things that make sense about it, because as you see that Microsoft is trying

01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:18.780
to push themselves beyond just a company you think about with game hardware and Xbox and

01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:22.100
so forth, we've even talked about this on the show just a couple of weeks ago where

01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:25.700
there were some comments about how Microsoft's really trying to just grow into the whole

01:14:25.700 --> 01:14:32.380
like gaming system, gaming ecosystem where, you know, you've got this cloud and Microsoft

01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:36.440
wants to be Netflix for games again, going into what we just talked about at the very

01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:40.480
beginning of the show, Microsoft kind of sees this coming and they want to be Netflix

01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:41.480
for games.

01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:46.640
And what better person to team up with than the person that can't seem to figure out online

01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:48.640
and say, we'll deliver it all to you.

01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:49.640
And you know what?

01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:52.240
We're not, we're not going to be putting out a handheld and that's probably part of their

01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:56.760
agreement or whatever is that Xbox would not put out a handheld ever.

01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:59.960
And that is, you know, something that, you know, maybe is on the table.

01:14:59.960 --> 01:15:00.960
I don't know.

01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:06.380
Or this is just all fanwank that culminates in nothing, but damn, would this be like an

01:15:06.380 --> 01:15:10.740
industry changing thing, especially with E3 being this year.

01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:15.220
Think about who's not at E3 this year and who are the big gaming companies that will

01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:16.220
be at E3 this year.

01:15:16.220 --> 01:15:17.220
Oh my God.

01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:18.220
That'd be amazing.

01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:20.260
I mean, they would be able to dominate the conversation.

01:15:20.260 --> 01:15:23.380
They would be the entirety of the conversation if this happened.

01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:26.220
It would be a, it would really be something else.

01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:30.580
Microsoft has struggled to get an audience in Japan for a long time.

01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:34.540
I mean, and so you might be looking at like, well, who's going to buy Ori and the Blind

01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:35.900
Forest and Cuphead at this point?

01:15:35.900 --> 01:15:38.980
Those games are years old, um, Japan.

01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:43.860
I bet there would be a big audience that would like to check out Cuphead or if they can port

01:15:43.860 --> 01:15:44.860
it to the switch.

01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:47.220
Um, yeah, you know, that would be awesome.

01:15:47.220 --> 01:15:51.100
Although I'm surprised that the Cuphead's not really an Xbox game.

01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:53.320
That's just a, it's a PC title.

01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:57.140
So I mean, I would think that that would be independent of Microsoft.

01:15:57.140 --> 01:16:01.500
VG realness says, um, I would absolutely would love for Microsoft to take over Nintendo's

01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:05.780
online, but I just can't see the Japanese arm getting in bed with the U S company.

01:16:05.780 --> 01:16:06.780
And I don't either.

01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:11.540
And I don't necessarily, you know, a lot of that, that I said before is mostly for hyperbole

01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:15.340
because I think what it really comes down to, it's going to be more like a strategic

01:16:15.340 --> 01:16:16.480
partnership.

01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:20.080
Think about how Minecraft is on the switch right now.

01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:24.900
That's a Microsoft thing that they're putting on the switch and the switch is able to use

01:16:24.900 --> 01:16:25.900
that as well.

01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:29.980
Nintendo can kind of use Microsoft as a way to swell, sell more switches because, Hey,

01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:32.100
we can do Mike Minecraft on the go.

01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:33.860
That is a strategic partnership.

01:16:33.860 --> 01:16:39.980
I don't see in this scenario, Microsoft taking over Nintendo or Nintendo taking over Microsoft

01:16:39.980 --> 01:16:40.980
or anything like that.

01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:41.980
That's not what we're talking about.

01:16:41.980 --> 01:16:45.980
We're talking about a strategic partnership where now Microsoft can kind of get some of

01:16:45.980 --> 01:16:49.460
their games, especially in front of a Japanese audience.

01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:56.620
And then on the flip side, uh, you know, Nintendo, uh, has ways to say, now we have all these

01:16:56.620 --> 01:17:01.920
new libraries of games that are accessible and playable that are on the switch.

01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:06.240
But I don't think it goes to Nintendo making games for Xbox.

01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:11.060
That's too far because Nintendo is still in the, in the habit of, we need to sell consoles.

01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:12.280
We need to sell this hardware.

01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:16.900
And the best way we do it is through our own titles that, you know, we are one of the best

01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:18.460
games in the business.

01:17:18.460 --> 01:17:23.020
But think about it though, like you could still do that and like just offer your titles

01:17:23.020 --> 01:17:28.940
for sale if, you know, cause they don't ever drop in price for sale through like a download

01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:34.900
service on, you know, like a Nintendo eShop app on the Xbox one or something like that

01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:36.620
where you can download stuff.

01:17:36.620 --> 01:17:40.820
It would still be like through the Nintendo store and you're just playing it, stream it

01:17:40.820 --> 01:17:42.340
to that console or something.

01:17:42.340 --> 01:17:43.340
I don't know.

01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:46.420
I just don't see why they couldn't go both ways, but who cares?

01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:50.000
I've even finally just game pass being on the switch.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:55.360
And so the rumors don't stop there because Game Informer Senior Editor Imran Khan, I

01:17:55.360 --> 01:18:00.280
hope I said the name right, sorry, chimed in as well with this on a podcast that he's

01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:01.280
a part of.

01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:03.600
Oh, those podcasts breaking news.

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:09.160
He said, there's a game that's thought to be dead that Nintendo is reviving and it's

01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:11.480
not one that people would expect.

01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:15.480
It was very much a title that was dead and buried, very officially canceled.

01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:20.160
I've heard enough about this game that he's almost sure that it exists again.

01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:24.200
And some people connecting the dots believe that that game is scale bound.

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:25.200
Yeah.

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:27.000
Um, don't know.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:31.600
And then, but then right along with that, uh, I believe there was a rumor that kind

01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:36.680
of follows that up to say, eh, probably not, it might not actually be that that's, that's

01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:37.680
what's going on.

01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:41.000
So, you know, take that with a big grain of salt.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.960
Um, but it's sure interesting in it.

01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:44.960
Yeah.

01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:47.720
I wouldn't, I don't know about scale bound.

01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:50.200
It was all right looking.

01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:53.880
I'd be in, well, scale bound to, if I remember right, scale bound, they originally conceived

01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:54.880
for the wheat.

01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:59.720
So, you know, Hey, Nintendo, I thought it was the X-Box three, six, it was originally

01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:03.640
conceived of the Wii and the Microsoft, you know, that whole partnership kind of worked

01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:07.200
with platinum games to bring it over there and then it didn't work out for whatever reason.

01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:09.720
So it would be very interesting if it does get a life.

01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:14.920
I mean, again, I think a lot of that is kind of like fanboy dreams, but you know, um, Nintendo

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:20.320
bringing back a franchise thought dead is not exactly unheard of Bayonetta.

01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:25.320
So except Bayonetta happened kind of like a lot faster, but you know, again, have, have

01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:28.360
we yet to see Bayonetta two show up on any other console?

01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:29.360
Nope.

01:19:29.360 --> 01:19:31.360
Not going to happen because Nintendo saved it.

01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:38.720
So anyway, we'll see, I, you know, E3 could be very interesting this year.

01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:44.000
Obviously it's a, it's rumors, huge grain of salt, but boy, is it fun to think about

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.000
the possibilities.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:46.000
Isn't it?

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Yes.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:48.000
Yeah, sure thing.

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:53.000
Uh, over in our Twitch chat room, uh, at VOG network, uh, she Hulk thinks that Microsoft

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:57.000
will give Nintendo a piece of the sales, uh, VG realness chimes in.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:00.240
Nintendo will never put their games on another console.

01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:06.080
And I, I believe that just as heavy as it's written in the chat, Nintendo is that Nintendo

01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:09.960
would be dead or selling to somebody else before that happens.

01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:11.760
And they're not, they're not hurting right now.

01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:17.200
I wouldn't say never though, because we probably, one time we thought, okay, in 20 Sonic will

01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:18.840
never appear on a Nintendo console.

01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:19.840
Okay.

01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:20.840
But we're talking like 20 years.

01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:24.560
We're talking like an entirely different industry than what we're in now.

01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:29.320
One where Nintendo has flopped so hard, it ruined them and not even the Wii U did that.

01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:32.320
So I just don't see it happening anytime soon.

01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:33.320
That's for sure.

01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:34.320
Um, interesting.

01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:35.880
Interesting.

01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:41.200
Um, Miltonius Games says everybody and nobody wants Scalebound on their console, apparently.

01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:47.360
Well, you know, I, Hey, as long as the game is good, bring it on, you know, and I'm all

01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:50.600
for a variety of experiences on the Switch.

01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:54.280
You know, Nintendo has their wheelhouse very well covered.

01:20:54.280 --> 01:21:00.680
Nintendo makes Nintendo games very well, but if they can get other types of games, hardcore

01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:05.680
games, if you will, and so forth on their platform, it stands to do even better.

01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:06.680
Shit.

01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:07.680
Look at Fortnite, right?

01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:11.800
Fortnite was not always the type of game you'd expect to see on a Nintendo console, but where

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:13.960
is something like Fortnite thriving?

01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:14.960
Nintendo Switch.

01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:15.960
Yeah.

01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:21.680
This is why everybody's like Apex Legends on Switch when, which by the way, Apex Legends

01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:24.040
has some really low graphics settings in it.

01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:28.560
So I'm kinda, it doesn't seem like the hardware would be the issue with bringing something

01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:29.840
like that to the Switch.

01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:31.040
What do I know?

01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:33.240
I'm just some dude with a podcast.

01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:34.240
Anyway.

01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:36.600
All right, let's move on.

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:40.520
We have a few more stories before we get to the classic game of the week.

01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:47.080
So Dreams is going to have a special creator early access version of the game that's going

01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:55.700
to be coming out this spring for $30 and it says there'll be a strictly limited release.

01:21:55.740 --> 01:22:01.340
It's basically going to allow you to kind of get a full set of the creative tools along

01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:04.380
with tutorials, arcade games and whatnot.

01:22:04.380 --> 01:22:09.540
And then they'll be adding more features, tutorials, arcade levels and assets as stuff

01:22:09.540 --> 01:22:14.460
goes along and prioritize all the awesome stuff that they're doing there.

01:22:14.460 --> 01:22:20.420
Um, they said the most important, I do it, I probably will do it for 30 bucks for like,

01:22:20.420 --> 01:22:21.480
I'll probably do it.

01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:26.440
I will because like all the things that people are creating with this is crazy and I just

01:22:26.440 --> 01:22:28.040
want to get in there and explore.

01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:32.800
Like if I feel like this dreams thing is not just like a game, it's, it's going to sneak

01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:39.400
up on you because like seriously, when I, when they kept showing dreams and like all

01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:42.640
the stuff that they're doing with it during these like presentations, I didn't really

01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:43.640
get it.

01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:47.660
But then you see what people are making with it, like where they're recreating PT in dreams

01:22:47.660 --> 01:22:53.620
or they're making a first person shooter that looks pretty amazing in dreams.

01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:57.660
I mean it's going to be a pretty amazing thing once it comes out.

01:22:57.660 --> 01:23:02.800
Um, but yeah, they said the most important thing is to know that the dream of verse is

01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:09.380
going to form around you so that if it gets you excited, early access is for you.

01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:13.860
If you participated in the beta and felt like dreams wasn't fully featured enough for you

01:23:13.860 --> 01:23:19.940
yet or you wanted more media molecule game content, then early access might not be for

01:23:19.940 --> 01:23:20.940
you.

01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:24.340
And then we're working on all those things during this period and we have every, if you

01:23:24.340 --> 01:23:28.220
want to pay for a beta, then this is for you.

01:23:28.220 --> 01:23:30.300
I'll do it for 30 bucks or 30 bucks.

01:23:30.300 --> 01:23:35.340
What does it, does it give you the full game as well or does it, is it like, is it $30

01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:36.700
towards the full game or something?

01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:38.620
I hope that would at least be it.

01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:42.740
Um, it's like you could upgrade this to a full copy of the game for a lot less.

01:23:42.740 --> 01:23:45.260
This eventually becomes a full copy of the game.

01:23:45.260 --> 01:23:51.000
Um, I'm not, it doesn't really, $30 seems really low for a game like this unless they

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.740
plan to like charge for the things people create in this game or something.

01:23:54.740 --> 01:23:55.740
Yeah.

01:23:55.740 --> 01:24:01.080
It doesn't really specify that it's going to be, um, upgraded to the full version.

01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:07.600
Although if they're keeping constantly adding stuff to it, maybe I, I don't know, it'd still

01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:09.740
be worth checking it out though.

01:24:09.740 --> 01:24:10.740
Yeah.

01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:12.700
All right.

01:24:12.700 --> 01:24:16.380
Well, um, I, uh, already talked about the scale bound thing.

01:24:16.380 --> 01:24:19.540
I kind of threw it in there with the other, uh, Nintendo and Microsoft rumors.

01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:24.740
So I don't think there's a lot else to say on these whispers about, uh, uh, Nintendo

01:24:24.740 --> 01:24:30.160
possibly reviving a canceled game, but I guess let me turn this into a question for everybody

01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:34.660
out there in the chat or, um, us here in studio.

01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:40.560
Outside of scale bounds, you know, and that, what would you like to see Nintendo possibly

01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:42.860
reinvent or reignite?

01:24:42.860 --> 01:24:50.120
What would you want Nintendo to do to read, read, ignite, I guess an old X-Box game.

01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:51.120
Anything really.

01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:55.080
Um, do a new cameo or perfect dark.

01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:56.360
Oh, perfect dark.

01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:57.360
That's a good one.

01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:58.360
Yeah.

01:24:58.360 --> 01:24:59.360
It was like some of that stuff.

01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:00.360
Yeah.

01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:04.040
Cameo had potential I think, but they didn't really do anything with it aside from kind

01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:08.560
of, I don't know if people would get excited about a new cameo excited about a new perfect

01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:09.560
dark.

01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:10.560
Dark would be cool.

01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:11.560
Yeah.

01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:12.560
It would be very cool.

01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:13.560
Cause I was going to say something like golden.

01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:18.520
I, although I've already tried, I know it's already been activated.

01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:21.840
It didn't really work out so well, but I think a lot of people are very attached to that

01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:22.840
for sure.

01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:28.640
Um, looking at chat over at a Twitch TV slash vog network, uh, VG realness says fantasy

01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:30.280
star online.

01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:31.280
Very good choice.

01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:33.320
Uh, Oh, perfect dark is a good choice.

01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:34.320
Perfect dark.

01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:35.320
Zero is trash.

01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:36.320
She Hulk.

01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:37.320
Oh, I like this answer.

01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:38.320
Fable.

01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:39.320
All right.

01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:41.080
That's a good answer.

01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:42.920
That is a really good answer because I think of that.

01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:47.320
There was that fable game, the co-op thing that got canceled where that, and that was

01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:48.440
very officially canceled.

01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:52.040
And maybe that is something that Nintendo could bring fable legends, right?

01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:53.600
Maybe that's something Nintendo would, yeah.

01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:57.440
They were trying to do also that like, w weren't they also doing, I don't know if it was part

01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:02.160
of the fable universe or not, but they were doing that like game making thing as well.

01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:03.960
They didn't really end up being anything.

01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:04.960
Yeah.

01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:09.160
Um, I don't know if I'd want to see that, but, uh, Frodo swag, his wishes.

01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:11.320
Uh, they would remake golden eye the proper way.

01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:13.480
The one they tried to remake was garbage.

01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:16.640
And did you, Rama asked to just conquer.

01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:20.960
I think when we talk about like rare games coming out on switch, that would make a lot

01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:21.960
of sense.

01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:26.140
If that happens again, I really think people are taking this tiny little like nugget of

01:26:26.140 --> 01:26:30.560
information and like rolling it down a hill and turn it into a snowball.

01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:35.240
Let's take a wait and see and pro fusion frenzy.

01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:36.520
Let's take out the first one was good.

01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:41.040
Let's take a wait and see approach and just, you know, go in with little expectations.

01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:45.600
Do not expect this at E3, do not expect Microsoft to come out and say, we're going to be on

01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:46.600
the switch.

01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:48.240
Do not expect Nintendo to announce in a direct.

01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:51.880
We've revived scale bound because for all we know, Nintendo is going to say we're going

01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:53.160
to do a few Jim frenzy.

01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:56.160
And so you got to lower those expectations a little bit.

01:26:56.160 --> 01:27:00.000
So anyway, although the intended diffusion, they don't really need to do fusion frenzy

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.200
because it's basically Mario party and it kind of is right.

01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:04.680
It's that fusion frenzy was crap.

01:27:04.680 --> 01:27:05.680
All right.

01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:12.160
Let's take a step back to a simpler time and visit the classic game of the week and maybe

01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:16.480
something that needs to be reinvented at another time, another place.

01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:24.360
And so we take a step back through time and space and everything else that we can bend

01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:27.920
in our will to a journey to the classic game of the week.

01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:32.320
And joining us to share the classic game of the week is the one, the only dark Sakura

01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:33.520
or Jamie Summers.

01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:34.520
Hello.

01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:35.520
Hi.

01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:37.360
How are you?

01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:38.360
I'm all right.

01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:39.360
How are you?

01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:40.360
I am good.

01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:41.360
Yeah.

01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:42.360
I'm sad.

01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:45.360
It's not a three day weekend like last weekend, but, you know, I'll take it.

01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:46.360
It wasn't.

01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:50.360
Well, I guess it was a three day weekend for me because I made it one.

01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:51.600
There you go.

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:54.560
Well, we look forward to having you back in studio next week.

01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:55.560
Full time.

01:27:57.560 --> 01:27:58.560
Very soon.

01:27:58.560 --> 01:27:59.560
All right.

01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:02.880
Well, one more for the books for this tape stuff.

01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:03.880
So how about it?

01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:06.400
Let's talk about the classic game of the week.

01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:09.800
What did you pick as you ventured into the vault and found a game that you think everybody

01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:11.000
should be checking out this week?

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:12.000
What is it?

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.680
I really wish this wasn't my fault.

01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:15.680
It's called Magical Popping.

01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:18.680
All right.

01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:19.680
Magical Popping.

01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:21.680
It came out in 1995.

01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:28.000
It only came out for the Super Famicom and it was developed by Full Star and published

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:31.880
by a company called Pack In Video, which later, I think, joined.

01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:32.880
Hold on.

01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:35.380
I actually have the name of the company they became.

01:28:35.380 --> 01:28:41.880
They became Victor Entertainment and then became Victor Interactive Software.

01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:49.000
So as for Magical Popping, this game is considered one of the rarest Super Famicom titles and

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:55.560
it goes for a lot of money, but also it has a very high piracy rate and with people trying

01:28:55.560 --> 01:28:56.560
to sell repros.

01:28:56.560 --> 01:29:00.000
So just, you know, be careful.

01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:03.120
If you happen to find one, make sure it's legit.

01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:09.600
But this did release on March 10th, 1995 and it's a side-scrolling game.

01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:13.800
I was just going to say, if you do find one, put it in an envelope and mail it to Dark

01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:16.800
Sakura, care of OLR Studios.

01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:17.800
Yes.

01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:20.800
It is a side-scrolling game.

01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:26.560
It has six stages total, but the stages are sort of maze-like and non-linear.

01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:30.560
You also have no password or state feature, so if you're going to finish it, you need

01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:33.920
to sit down and commit.

01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:40.760
But basically, you're playing as a princess who lives in a castle that has a magical gem

01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:46.600
and the gem is stolen by an invading army and so the princess, you know, not having

01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:51.760
any heroes and having a go-get-it personality just does it herself.

01:29:51.760 --> 01:30:00.440
So the game was produced by Wada Yasuhiro, who also went on to work on Harvest Moon in

01:30:00.440 --> 01:30:07.720
1995 and had artwork on the box drawn by Akai Takami.

01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:15.880
One thing about the voice acting of the game was done by a lady named Ijima Ai, who had

01:30:15.880 --> 01:30:19.960
also worked in adult video earlier on in her career.

01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:26.880
She's actually one of the few people who this never became a scandal for her, also sadly.

01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:35.920
She died of a kidney failure and sepsis, I want to say, in 2010, if I remember correctly,

01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:38.280
so she's since gone.

01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:45.360
She was a big TV personality for a while after her initial days, but at any rate, this game

01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:53.720
has never had a release outside of Japan and never had a release on any other console.

01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:58.320
It was reviewed by Famitsu for a 23 out of 40.

01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:05.000
It was compared to the Monster World series that it was sort of an old-fashioned kind

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:11.120
of game and that the game was really difficult because the character's attack was very low,

01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:16.160
although the character had great animation.

01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:20.160
Some people didn't even think that Ijima's voice was all that good because of the sort

01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:25.680
of moe character, yet she has a kind of corny voice.

01:31:25.680 --> 01:31:33.280
It was basically considered cute and challenging and people were bad that you couldn't actually

01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:35.280
say it in the game.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:41.680
The intellectual property of the game now belongs to Marvelous Entertainment and it

01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:48.800
was listed in 2016 at 100,000 yen sold in the box, without 30,000 yen.

01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:58.880
A store in Tokyo in 2017 was selling it for 140,000 yen, which at the time was about $1200.

01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:08.480
I think the highest successful bid was 80,000 yen for this game, so 800 bucks, roughly.

01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:13.120
So there you go, a game that I probably won't own a copy of any time soon unless someone

01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:14.640
really loves me.

01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:18.920
I was going to say, that's approaching levels of that Super Mario game we talked about last

01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:21.200
week that sold for $100,000.

01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:25.920
I mean, maybe not that high yet, but I'm in condition, who knows?

01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:28.560
Yeah, but good luck.

01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:31.920
Yeah, this is the type of game, though, since you kept talking about how you can't really

01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:36.160
save it or there's no passwords, this is the type of game that would definitely lend itself

01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:42.080
to how you leave the power on all night long and just pray that your parents don't come

01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:46.240
in or your sibling or whatever doesn't come in and shut it off in the middle of the night.

01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:50.400
And it's like, man, my game, man, you ruined it.

01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:52.160
Mm-hmm, for sure.

01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:58.000
Now, just to throw this out there, if anyone is not super familiar with pack-in video from

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:04.000
before the day, they also published Moon or Lander, mine speaker for Game Boy.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.720
They did One Gun Dead heat games for Saturn.

01:33:06.720 --> 01:33:12.600
For Super Framacon, they did Atlas Run, Sunk, Voyager, Magical Pop'n, like I just said.

01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:17.120
They did Super Battle Tank 2, Super Solace Hair, Harvest Moon.

01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:22.280
And then for Turbo Graphics, the PC Engine, they did the Metal Angel games, Super Metal

01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:23.280
Crusher.

01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:25.400
They did virtual fishing for Virtual Boy.

01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:28.960
And they did a handful of MSX and MSX2 games.

01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:37.400
They also developed Burning Soldier for 3DO, Boundary Gate for PC-FX, and then a few other

01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:40.840
really only Japanese-only games except for Famicom.

01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:45.000
They did Die Hard and Knight Rider and Predator and Rambo.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
So some 80s movies tie-in.

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000
Yeah, a few.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:50.000
So how...

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:51.000
Go ahead.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000
You were saying?

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000
I just said that's it.

01:33:55.600 --> 01:33:57.600
Awkward phone delay.

01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:03.440
I was just about to ask, since this game is so rare and it's so difficult, how did you

01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:04.960
come across this for selection?

01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:08.400
Is this just because you kind of know the publisher?

01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:12.800
I just came over the game and it's been kind of on my secret want list for a while.

01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:16.640
I mean, I had that want list of rare games for a while that have gotten a few things

01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:17.900
off of.

01:34:17.900 --> 01:34:21.720
And then a few that had found out, oh, I actually do already own this.

01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:28.720
It was around the time I was learning about Panorama Cotton and Dracula X and some of

01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:30.720
those types of games.

01:34:30.720 --> 01:34:31.720
All right.

01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:32.720
Very cool.

01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:33.720
Well, there it is.

01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:38.720
Your classic game of the week, Magical Poppin', a very, very rare Super Famicom game.

01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:41.720
And again, if you find a copy of that, you can just send it right to our studio.

01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:43.720
Please do.

01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:46.720
I might even send you a taco.

01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:49.720
Real quick before we go back to the show.

01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:55.720
I know it's that Sunday night, it's that time, it's award season, it's Oscar season.

01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:58.720
So is there anything, I mean, maybe you don't give a hoot.

01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:01.720
I know I'm kind of in that category, but is there anything you're rooting for tonight

01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:03.720
at the Oscars?

01:35:03.720 --> 01:35:04.720
Two things.

01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:06.720
The tuxedo ball gown is epic.

01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:07.720
Oh, Billy.

01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:08.720
And the second Oscar.

01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:09.720
Yeah.

01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:10.720
Billy Porter.

01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:11.720
Sorry.

01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:12.720
Just, yeah, amazing.

01:35:12.720 --> 01:35:13.720
Yeah.

01:35:13.720 --> 01:35:14.720
And then secondly, I don't know.

01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:18.720
The only Oscar I care about lives in the trash can on Bethany Street.

01:35:19.720 --> 01:35:26.720
And so I suppose we end this segment with, and that's why I love trash.

01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:27.720
Yeah.

01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:28.720
All right.

01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:29.720
Seriously, though.

01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:32.720
He was our first, Oscar was our first upcycler, remember?

01:35:32.720 --> 01:35:33.720
That's right.

01:35:33.720 --> 01:35:37.720
Anyway, it shouldn't end with my final singing.

01:35:37.720 --> 01:35:40.720
What are your final words to the listeners tonight?

01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:46.720
That's why I like trash, too.

01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:50.720
I guess we're just big fans of trash here at Orange Lounge Radio.

01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:51.720
What can we say?

01:35:51.720 --> 01:35:52.720
Thank you, as always, DarkSagra.

01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:56.720
And we'll see you back in studio next week.

01:35:56.720 --> 01:36:01.720
Meanwhile, let's travel around the internet and touch on a few more stories that we have

01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:02.720
not had time to talk about yet.

01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:06.720
I was going to say, speaking to the Oscars, I was very pleased to see that Spider-Man

01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:08.720
entered the Spider-Verse 1 best animated film.

01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:09.720
Oh, did it?

01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:10.720
Okay.

01:36:10.720 --> 01:36:11.720
It was up against Wreck-It Ralph, too, right?

01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:12.720
Yeah.

01:36:13.720 --> 01:36:17.720
If you've seen Spider-Man, it was easily deserving of that.

01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:19.720
A lot of people were fans of that.

01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:21.720
I don't care about the Oscars.

01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:22.720
I don't care.

01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:25.720
I realize I'm probably the only gay guy on the planet that's going to tell you that,

01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:26.720
but I don't care about the Oscars.

01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:27.720
I just don't.

01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:28.720
I know.

01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:29.720
Who cares what other people think?

01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:32.720
I only cared about it when I worked in the movie industry.

01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:34.720
What does it matter about critics anyway?

01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:38.720
Look at what's going on with Anthem right now, which I've said my piece on Anthem, and

01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:41.720
I purposely wasn't going to get into this tonight because I haven't played the full game, so

01:36:41.720 --> 01:36:45.720
I really don't have anything to say, but I will point out, you know, it doesn't have

01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:47.720
a wonderful score on Metacritic.

01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:52.720
61 is lower than what Mass Effect Andromeda had, right?

01:36:52.720 --> 01:36:56.720
But I've got plenty of people on social media and other places that are like,

01:36:56.720 --> 01:36:57.720
I'm having fun.

01:36:57.720 --> 01:36:58.720
I'm having a good time.

01:36:58.720 --> 01:36:59.720
Whatever.

01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:00.720
You know?

01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:04.720
And I've seen other people that are saying these loading times are garbage.

01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:06.720
The game's not even done yet and so forth.

01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:09.720
I'm not going to talk about it because I didn't play it.

01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:10.720
Y'all know why I didn't.

01:37:10.720 --> 01:37:11.720
We're done.

01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:17.720
But if people are enjoying it, it shouldn't stop them from enjoying it.

01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:23.720
And seeing that it even goes with like Fallout 76, you know, if you're enjoying that game,

01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:25.720
more power to you.

01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:26.720
It's just, I'm surprised.

01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:29.720
You're one of the minority, I guess.

01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:30.720
Whatever.

01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:36.720
VG Realness in chat says, ooh, bitch, you'll care if Star is Born wins or if Gaga wins

01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:37.720
Best Actress.

01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:41.720
I would only be excited if Star is Born won because that's more exposure for Willem and

01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:43.720
Shangela who are in that movie.

01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:46.720
But I also completely understand why like Roma winning would be very good.

01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:47.720
Was that what it's called?

01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:48.720
Yeah.

01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:50.720
Well, that movie, the Netflix, because it's on Netflix.

01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:54.720
It's obviously, you know, it's a whole different kind of movie.

01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:55.720
I think best foreign.

01:37:55.720 --> 01:37:56.720
Right.

01:37:56.720 --> 01:37:57.720
Well, that'll win best foreign for sure.

01:37:57.720 --> 01:37:59.720
You don't you'll get anyway.

01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:01.720
Or, you know, Black Panther wins.

01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:05.720
That's going to be huge because, you know, it's a Marvel movie that's winning best.

01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:06.720
But, you know, so whatever.

01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:08.720
Cool.

01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:13.720
Gaga won't win Best Actress, though, because Glenn Close, I think it's it's her time.

01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:15.720
And that's honestly like I love Lady Gaga.

01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:16.720
She's great.

01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:19.720
But like her not winning an Oscar is not going to diminish.

01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:20.720
Apparently she did.

01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:21.720
She just won for the song.

01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:22.720
Of course.

01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:23.720
How is she not going to win that song?

01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:24.720
Give me a break.

01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:30.720
But it's it's not going to diminish what an artist she is or how amazing she was in that

01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:33.720
movie, whether she does or doesn't take home a gold statue.

01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:35.720
Glenn Close is kind of perfect.

01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:36.720
Like, come on.

01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:39.720
Y'all saw one hundred and one Dalmatians as kids.

01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:40.720
It's Glenn Close's time.

01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:41.720
It's fair.

01:38:41.720 --> 01:38:43.720
It's fair.

01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:46.720
She should have won the Oscar for Cruella.

01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:49.720
She got nominated for a Globe, if I remember right, for Cruella.

01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:52.720
Yeah, because the Globes will nominate anything.

01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:53.720
Let's move on.

01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:54.720
Why am I talking about award shows?

01:38:54.720 --> 01:38:55.720
What are you doing?

01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:56.720
I don't know.

01:38:56.720 --> 01:39:00.720
You're the one that went on that rapid fire news.

01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:01.720
All right.

01:39:01.720 --> 01:39:07.720
So the entitled goose game, better known as the asshole goose game, it's been delayed.

01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:10.720
So it's going to come out later in 2019 instead of the spring.

01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:11.720
That's unfortunate.

01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:15.720
So you're going to have to wait a little longer to torture people as a goose.

01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:18.720
But at least it won't lay an egg as a game.

01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:20.720
Yes, hopefully.

01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:25.720
This was a game that I actually played the game jam version of.

01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:29.720
There was a proof of concept called Baba is You.

01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:34.720
And it's kind of a puzzle game with game logic in there.

01:39:34.720 --> 01:39:39.720
So they have, for example, you walk around, you can push things or pick up things.

01:39:39.720 --> 01:39:46.720
So you can change, oh, key is you, or baba is open, or something like that.

01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:50.720
And you can change the logic in the game to solve puzzles.

01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:51.720
It's pretty clever.

01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:52.720
That's a clever concept.

01:39:52.720 --> 01:39:54.720
Using logic gates and logic puzzles.

01:39:54.720 --> 01:39:58.720
It's very interesting in how you solve some of the puzzles.

01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:03.720
So they have it coming out now on PC, Mac, and Nintendo Switch March 13th.

01:40:03.720 --> 01:40:05.720
So that's actually going to be a full game pretty soon.

01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:08.720
So pretty awesome to see that's coming out of there.

01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:15.720
And this one had me very excited because I loved this game when I first saw it back at Sac Indie Arcade.

01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:18.720
It is a local dev that's putting this out.

01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:21.720
It's a game called Black Future 88.

01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:28.720
And it's just this really cool cyberpunk 2D action roguelike shooter game.

01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:34.720
And it's going to be coming out on PC and Nintendo Switch as well pretty soon.

01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:37.720
We should reach out and try to get them on the show if they're here.

01:40:37.720 --> 01:40:38.720
Yes. Very awesome.

01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:43.720
And it was awesome when I played it, and it looks even more awesome now.

01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:44.720
Good for them.

01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:45.720
Definitely going to be checking that out.

01:40:45.720 --> 01:40:46.720
That's great.

01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:47.720
All right.

01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:50.720
Moving on to some stories that I have over here.

01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:54.720
Kunio-kun, that series, which is River City Ransom.

01:40:54.720 --> 01:40:55.720
It's those characters, right?

01:40:55.720 --> 01:40:56.720
Yeah.

01:40:56.720 --> 01:40:57.720
Dodgeball.

01:40:57.720 --> 01:41:01.720
They're going to be getting another game on PC, PlayStation 4, and Switch.

01:41:01.720 --> 01:41:04.720
And I guess it's, well, I mean, the Switch is region-free.

01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:05.720
Yeah.

01:41:05.720 --> 01:41:06.720
So you'd be able to play it anywhere.

01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:12.720
But this is a new version of River City Melee Battle Royale Special.

01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:17.720
So the game is actually called Downtown Rantou Koushin Koyoku Mak.

01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:20.720
So that is, it's kind of like a reimagined version of that game from 2016,

01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:22.720
which is on the PC and PS4,

01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:27.720
which in turn was a new version of River City Super Sports Challenge

01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:31.720
All-Star Special for the PC and PlayStation 3.

01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:33.720
Which, you know, again, the River City group,

01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:36.720
they were also in the dodgeball games, which are insanely possible.

01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:41.720
So seeing them in the sports universe, not a completely crazy concept.

01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:43.720
It is also going to be an arena brawler concept.

01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:46.720
New items and modes, create a character.

01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:47.720
That'll be fun.

01:41:47.720 --> 01:41:49.720
Probably sometime this year.

01:41:49.720 --> 01:41:50.720
How about a battle royale mode?

01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:51.720
Why not?

01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:52.720
A hundred people in the ring.

01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:53.720
One lives.

01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:54.720
Why not?

01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:55.720
River City Ransom Battle Royale game.

01:41:55.720 --> 01:41:56.720
Why not?

01:41:56.720 --> 01:41:57.720
I love that.

01:41:57.720 --> 01:41:58.720
That's where everything else is going.

01:41:58.720 --> 01:41:59.720
Let's do it.

01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:06.720
And this is getting a lot of eyes this week, is a trademark that Square Enix filed.

01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:14.720
The trademark that they filed in Europe and North America is called Collection of Mana.

01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:18.720
Just like something that they released in Japan.

01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:21.720
They did not have to file said trademark because it's already out.

01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:24.720
And it was that, of course, collection for the Switch that contains

01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:28.720
Second Detsetsu 1, 2, and 3.

01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:32.720
Which Second Detsetsu 2 is, of course, out here as Secret of Mana.

01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:35.720
And Second Detsetsu 3 is one of those infamous Super Nintendo games.

01:42:35.720 --> 01:42:41.720
Never came out here, but I'm sure a lot of y'all played it through ROM hack translation patches anyway.

01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:42.720
So it'd be very interesting.

01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:43.720
I mean, who knows?

01:42:43.720 --> 01:42:44.720
They might not include it.

01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:46.720
They might release it over here and not include that.

01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:49.720
It would just be the regular Secret of Mana and the Game Boy game or whatever.

01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:51.720
But maybe they will.

01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:53.720
And that would be pretty cool.

01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:57.720
Especially, you know, when Octopath Traveler did pretty well.

01:42:57.720 --> 01:43:02.720
Maybe Square Enix is probably looking to take more risks on the Switch.

01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:03.720
We'll see.

01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:04.720
That'd be great.

01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:09.720
Bob Coffee in chat says, hopefully we get Second 3 finally officially localized.

01:43:09.720 --> 01:43:11.720
I mean, that would be the best part.

01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:15.720
I mean, nothing against those translators who worked their ass off to make this happen.

01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:22.720
But to have the official version of that and Square, you know, it would feel really good to see that finally after all these years.

01:43:22.720 --> 01:43:23.720
Yeah.

01:43:23.720 --> 01:43:31.720
Anyhow, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of things that are coming out a little sooner than Collection of Mana, which is a rumor anyway.

01:43:31.720 --> 01:43:32.720
But these are happening for sure.

01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:38.720
Yes, so this week we've got Dirt Rally 2.0 on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:44.720
We have Stellaris, the console edition on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:43:44.720 --> 01:43:49.720
We have the LEGO Movie 2 video game on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:55.720
And Trials Rising on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:43:55.720 --> 01:44:01.720
Alien League on PC, Dead or Alive 6 on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:07.720
Swords and Soldiers 2, Shormageddon on the Nintendo Switch.

01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:14.720
And last but not least, Toejam and Earl back in the groove on PC, Mac, Linux, Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:16.720
Interesting. I forgot they were bringing that back.

01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:18.720
Yes, it's back.

01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:23.720
All right. Well, going over to Japan and looking at the releases over there, Dead or Alive 6 also coming out in Japan.

01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:27.720
It looks like it's a worldwide release day on March 1st, same day it hits the US.

01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:31.720
Just before that, on February 28th, we have some other releases in Japan.

01:44:31.720 --> 01:44:33.720
It's kind of a busy week, actually.

01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:40.720
A game called Noratu Ojutou Noraniko Heart 2 comes out in regular as well as some limited edition.

01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:44.720
This game has the subtitle Nora, Princess, and Crying Cat.

01:44:44.720 --> 01:44:49.720
That is the game. There's actually a little cat that's in the logo, like this little shadow.

01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:50.720
But is it crying?

01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:52.720
I can't tell because it's kind of from far away, so I don't know.

01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:57.720
It just looks like, you know, it looks like another one of those anime turned into a video game type of things,

01:44:57.720 --> 01:44:59.720
but I don't think it's anything they'd ever release over here.

01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:02.720
But you had me at cat.

01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:07.720
Leather games coming out in Japan, Left Alive, Wizard Symphony, all on PlayStation 4.

01:45:07.720 --> 01:45:13.720
Shinsun no Jushin Tante no Jikinbo comes out as well.

01:45:13.720 --> 01:45:20.720
Ride 3 also in Japan, Work Cross Work, Forgotten Anne, and Trials Rising also coming out in Japan.

01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:23.720
It's a very busy week, and that's just all on the PlayStation 4.

01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:29.720
On the Switch, Darius Cosmic Collection, that's pretty cool, in a regular and special edition.

01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:35.720
That Noratu Ojutou, the Crying Cat thing, that's also on the Switch as well.

01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:42.720
As well as a game called Boku no Kanojo wa Ningyo Hime comes out there as well.

01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:46.720
And a Doraemon game, Doraemon Nobita no Getsumen Tansaki.

01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:51.720
And, oh my god, this is great, a game called My Girlfriend is a Mermaid?

01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:54.720
Well, bitch, she might be.

01:45:54.720 --> 01:45:57.720
It's like Splash all over again.

01:45:57.720 --> 01:46:00.720
I'm going back to the Darius Collection because that's pretty rad, yeah.

01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:07.720
Darius 2, Sengaya, which was the Darius 2 overseas version, and Darius Gaiden.

01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:10.720
So, busy week. That's cool.

01:46:10.720 --> 01:46:13.720
That's your Japanese releases. How about Europe?

01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:16.720
Europe has 8-Bit Invaders coming out on PlayStation 4.

01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:20.720
Dirt Rally 2.0 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

01:46:20.720 --> 01:46:25.720
Nier Automata Game of the Year, or Game of the Yora edition.

01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:27.720
Haha, pun.

01:46:27.720 --> 01:46:29.720
That's on PlayStation 4.

01:46:29.720 --> 01:46:33.720
Trials Rising Gold on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and the Switch.

01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:40.720
Aces of the Luftwaffe Squadron edition, that's on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and the Switch.

01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:43.720
Rad Rogers Radical Edition on the Switch.

01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:47.720
Crash Dummy on PlayStation 4 and the Switch.

01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:50.720
Dead or Alive 6 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:54.720
The Lego Movie Video Game on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:46:54.720 --> 01:47:00.720
And, let's see, Dark Souls Trilogy on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

01:47:00.720 --> 01:47:01.720
That's it.

01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:07.720
Alright, every week we invite your emails at participate at orangeloungeradio.com

01:47:07.720 --> 01:47:10.720
and we read your emails here live on the air.

01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:13.720
So, again, that email address, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

01:47:13.720 --> 01:47:16.720
First email tonight from our good pal YYR.

01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:18.720
He likes to chime in with his thoughts.

01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:19.720
So, YYR starts us off tonight.

01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:23.720
Hello, LR. I was literally just listening to last week's show

01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:26.720
and I wanted to address something you guys mentioned in rapid fire news.

01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:28.720
Microsoft Solitaire Collection.

01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:30.720
Yes, it's still included with Windows today.

01:47:30.720 --> 01:47:33.720
However, it's not quite free. It's free to play.

01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:34.720
I wish I was joking.

01:47:34.720 --> 01:47:36.720
The thing is filled with ads.

01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:39.720
If you want to remove the ads, you have to buy an in-app purchase in order to do that.

01:47:39.720 --> 01:47:42.720
You know, now that he's saying that, I do remember that.

01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:45.720
Like, when I played so many levels, like to play another level,

01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:49.720
it was like, here's a crappy ad for something you'll never actually play.

01:47:49.720 --> 01:47:50.720
And, yeah, you had to sit through that.

01:47:50.720 --> 01:47:54.720
So, now, I just, I had blacked that out of my mind.

01:47:54.720 --> 01:47:56.720
Can you blame me on that?

01:47:56.720 --> 01:47:59.720
Anyway, if you want to remove the ads, you'll have to buy an in-app purchase in order to do that.

01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:01.720
But, here's the real kick in the ass.

01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:07.720
The purchase is a subscription that costs $1.50 a month or $10 a year.

01:48:07.720 --> 01:48:10.720
And, when the subscription expires, the ads come back.

01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:15.720
Not worth it. I'm deleting that off my system.

01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:17.720
Now, y'all got to make a choice.

01:48:17.720 --> 01:48:18.720
Y'all got to make a choice.

01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:19.720
Do I even have Solitaire?

01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:22.720
You want ad-free Solitaire or you want Grinder Extra?

01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:23.720
What are you going to do?

01:48:23.720 --> 01:48:27.720
By the way, I checked the latest user reviews

01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:31.720
and, apparently, the recent supposed improvements are controversial.

01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:35.720
Lots of folks recently left one-star reviews asking for the old version back.

01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:37.720
So, I'll just say this.

01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:41.720
If you're feeling nostalgic and want to play Solitaire or Minesweeper on Windows,

01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:45.720
just copy the Windows 7 versions from someone who's still running Windows 7.

01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:47.720
Done deal. I'm sure they're out there on the internet.

01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:50.720
I just uninstalled it. Take that, Microsoft.

01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:52.720
I will not play a crappy Solitaire game.

01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:57.720
Before I go, I know that you were asking for streams or videos to run

01:48:57.720 --> 01:48:59.720
during the post-classic Game of the Week break.

01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:03.720
I could certainly contribute a few videos of my current and upcoming games,

01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:06.720
but I'm not usually about shameless self-promotion.

01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:07.720
What do you think?

01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:08.720
Have a great week.

01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:09.720
YYR.

01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:10.720
I need to make some of those. You know what?

01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:11.720
Yeah.

01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:12.720
I do need to do that.

01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:13.720
Here's the thing.

01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:15.720
I have an idea for how to fill it in.

01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:17.720
I will probably do a spotlight.

01:49:17.720 --> 01:49:20.720
But this is like the default when nothing else exists.

01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:22.720
I will probably spotlight a free game.

01:49:22.720 --> 01:49:26.720
Meaning like in the Epic Store, they've been giving away those free games.

01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:28.720
Sometimes you get them on Steam too.

01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:30.720
Or itch.io, of course.

01:49:30.720 --> 01:49:32.720
Great indie place to play lots of free games.

01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:36.720
Speaking of which, I was going to say Epic Game Store has Thimbleweed Park.

01:49:36.720 --> 01:49:37.720
Have you played that yet?

01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:38.720
I haven't, but I grabbed it.

01:49:38.720 --> 01:49:40.720
And so if we don't get anything for next week,

01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:41.720
we'll probably see that.

01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:42.720
It is a great game.

01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:43.720
Yes.

01:49:43.720 --> 01:49:45.720
So here's the thing.

01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:47.720
But I would actually rather it not be me.

01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:49.720
You see enough of me on this program.

01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:54.720
So I would happily solicit somewhere between 7 to 10,

01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:58.720
no more than 12 minute segments to run during the break,

01:49:58.720 --> 01:50:01.720
or during the in-studio break for us to rest our voices,

01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:03.720
use the potty, get water, things like that.

01:50:03.720 --> 01:50:05.720
You know, things that we do to keep a show going.

01:50:05.720 --> 01:50:08.720
Because a regular radio show would have full length commercial breaks

01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:09.720
for people to do that.

01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:10.720
We don't have that.

01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:13.720
So I would like to welcome other Twitch contributors,

01:50:13.720 --> 01:50:16.720
and Twitch streamers, and game makers, and game developers.

01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:19.720
You know, as long as it's not just a flat out commercial,

01:50:19.720 --> 01:50:22.720
but especially YYR, you've been working with our show for forever.

01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:26.720
I think it would be really cool if you kind of had somebody

01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:29.720
who's a Twitch streamer show off one of your games.

01:50:29.720 --> 01:50:31.720
That would be really cool.

01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:34.720
You know, because I'd like to spotlight some other indie creators

01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:35.720
here on Twitch.

01:50:35.720 --> 01:50:38.720
And that could even be 10 minutes of your own podcast.

01:50:38.720 --> 01:50:40.720
I ain't worried about competition.

01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:43.720
There's plenty of time in the day to listen to lots of stuff,

01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:44.720
and a lot of the stuff is on demand.

01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:47.720
So anyway, if you'd like to contribute something like that,

01:50:47.720 --> 01:50:48.720
please get in touch with me.

01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:50.720
You can reach out on Twitter at MrRobRoberts,

01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:53.720
or you can email me directly, rob at voggenetwork.com.

01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:56.720
And I would be very interested in having those types of segments

01:50:56.720 --> 01:50:58.720
for the future.

01:50:58.720 --> 01:51:01.720
And you know, if we get flooded with them, you know what?

01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:04.720
We could do something after OLR.

01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:05.720
We could play a segment after it,

01:51:05.720 --> 01:51:07.720
because we kind of don't have a lot on Twitch afterwards.

01:51:07.720 --> 01:51:11.720
We could play something maybe even before, during Bobby's show on us.

01:51:11.720 --> 01:51:14.720
So I'm not worried about getting swarmed with content.

01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:17.720
But I don't want outright commercials.

01:51:17.720 --> 01:51:20.720
But when it comes to indie stuff, is it really a commercial?

01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:23.720
Because a lot of indie folks have a really hard time getting their word out.

01:51:23.720 --> 01:51:24.720
You know what I mean?

01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:25.720
Yeah.

01:51:25.720 --> 01:51:27.720
And I also, of course, would open it up to chatters.

01:51:27.720 --> 01:51:29.720
What would you guys like to see in our breaks?

01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:31.720
Because yeah, this is something that's going to start next week.

01:51:31.720 --> 01:51:35.720
So if we don't get anything, then it's going to be me playing Thimbleweed Park.

01:51:35.720 --> 01:51:37.720
That's what you're going to get for the break next week.

01:51:37.720 --> 01:51:40.720
Like I did Tetris 99 last week.

01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:43.720
But if we do start getting things, then I'd rather play those.

01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:47.720
But I just want all our content creators who want to be on the break,

01:51:47.720 --> 01:51:50.720
remember, it's a podcast too.

01:51:50.720 --> 01:51:52.720
So keep that in the back of your mind.

01:51:52.720 --> 01:51:55.720
You can't just say, look at this, look at that, look at this.

01:51:55.720 --> 01:51:56.720
You have to talk us through.

01:51:56.720 --> 01:52:01.720
And remember, we have folks that are also visually impaired who listen to this show and so forth.

01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:04.720
So we've got to keep them in our minds as well.

01:52:04.720 --> 01:52:08.720
So as Joe 100 Matt says, I would love to do more videos,

01:52:08.720 --> 01:52:11.720
but my day job takes up so much of my day to day life.

01:52:11.720 --> 01:52:13.720
I have a few ideas, but they do take time for me.

01:52:13.720 --> 01:52:15.720
I wouldn't expect any one person to do this every single week.

01:52:15.720 --> 01:52:17.720
In fact, I think that's actually a bad idea.

01:52:17.720 --> 01:52:23.720
It would be great if there were like 10 people that did it on like a rotating thing.

01:52:23.720 --> 01:52:24.720
You know what I mean?

01:52:24.720 --> 01:52:26.720
I'll find something to put together.

01:52:26.720 --> 01:52:29.720
I have all this footage of me playing DDR that I put together.

01:52:29.720 --> 01:52:30.720
Why not?

01:52:30.720 --> 01:52:32.720
Okay, here's the one caution with DDR.

01:52:32.720 --> 01:52:34.720
The problem is that license music.

01:52:34.720 --> 01:52:36.720
Well, I just pick a non-license song.

01:52:36.720 --> 01:52:38.720
Yeah, as long as you're picking Konami originals, it should be fine.

01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:40.720
I'm not as worried about getting muted with that stuff.

01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:41.720
Yeah.

01:52:41.720 --> 01:52:44.720
Anyway, let's see.

01:52:44.720 --> 01:52:48.720
Motonious Games in chat says, I'm going to start a yellow lounge radio podcast.

01:52:48.720 --> 01:52:49.720
Big bucks incoming.

01:52:49.720 --> 01:52:52.720
I actually want to hear a random side tangent, true story.

01:52:52.720 --> 01:52:58.720
So when we first launched Horde House all those years ago, remember Horde House?

01:52:58.720 --> 01:53:00.720
It was the sideshow that I did with Exfer and Shane.

01:53:00.720 --> 01:53:03.720
Originally it was just Exfer and I, but later we had Shane and Grandpa.

01:53:03.720 --> 01:53:05.720
It was about World of Warcraft because we were like obsessed with it at the time.

01:53:05.720 --> 01:53:07.720
We played a lot of it.

01:53:07.720 --> 01:53:12.720
So we ended up naming that show Horde House because I solicited names online

01:53:12.720 --> 01:53:15.720
and I was like, what would be a funny name for the show?

01:53:15.720 --> 01:53:17.720
And somebody submitted that and I'm like, I love it.

01:53:17.720 --> 01:53:19.720
I love it because it's like the double entendre, right?

01:53:19.720 --> 01:53:22.720
If you say Horde House over, it sounds like something else.

01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:24.720
I'll leave it at that, right?

01:53:24.720 --> 01:53:25.720
So we thought that was a funny name.

01:53:25.720 --> 01:53:28.720
In fact, actually the full name was the best little Horde House in Azeroth.

01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:31.720
Like I'm beating you over the head with the reference.

01:53:31.720 --> 01:53:32.720
I think you'd all get it.

01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:38.720
But my thing was, if we don't get any names, I think we could just be like Warcraft Lounge Radio, right?

01:53:38.720 --> 01:53:40.720
We'll take, cause it's kind of like a spinoff of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:42.720
We'll be Warcraft Lounge Radio.

01:53:42.720 --> 01:53:44.720
We'll get this. We didn't go with that name.

01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:48.720
Not even like, like it was like the same week Horde House started

01:53:48.720 --> 01:53:50.720
or like the week before or the week after.

01:53:50.720 --> 01:53:54.720
It was like within the same month, a new podcast popped up called Warcraft Lounge Radio.

01:53:54.720 --> 01:53:55.720
I kid you not.

01:53:55.720 --> 01:53:58.720
And it had nothing to do with LOLR.

01:53:58.720 --> 01:54:00.720
People I'd never heard of before.

01:54:00.720 --> 01:54:02.720
Other Warcraft fans doing their thing, making a podcast.

01:54:02.720 --> 01:54:04.720
Total fucking coincidence.

01:54:04.720 --> 01:54:08.720
But I just, I kind of had to step back and I was like, that's really funny.

01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:09.720
That's really funny.

01:54:09.720 --> 01:54:13.720
Cause I never said this on the show that I was thinking about doing a Warcraft thing, right?

01:54:13.720 --> 01:54:18.720
It's just that one of those funny fucking coincidences where somebody had the same idea.

01:54:18.720 --> 01:54:19.720
So, anyway.

01:54:19.720 --> 01:54:23.720
But it all worked out great cause some people came to LOLR because of Horde House.

01:54:23.720 --> 01:54:29.720
I'm sad that that show isn't still on but the reality is nobody had the passion for those types of games.

01:54:30.720 --> 01:54:31.720
You know, anymore.

01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:33.720
Kind of would like come and go and stuff.

01:54:33.720 --> 01:54:35.720
But everybody's doing some other type of content.

01:54:35.720 --> 01:54:37.720
Like Xfer has a Twitch channel.

01:54:37.720 --> 01:54:41.720
Grandpa's still working with Starboard Power Coupling.

01:54:41.720 --> 01:54:46.720
Which is, you know, if you're obsessed.com with Star Trek Discovery, as you should be.

01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:48.720
That's a great companion thing to be listening to.

01:54:48.720 --> 01:54:50.720
So check out Starboard Power Coupling.

01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:55.720
And then Shane, you know, he's not doing his ranger pride now.

01:54:55.720 --> 01:54:57.720
But I'm sure he'll think of something in the future.

01:54:57.720 --> 01:54:59.720
He pops in on this show and my own streams and stuff.

01:54:59.720 --> 01:55:03.720
So you still see all those guys around making their own things somewhere else.

01:55:03.720 --> 01:55:04.720
So, anyway.

01:55:04.720 --> 01:55:06.720
Ooh, that was a big tangent.

01:55:06.720 --> 01:55:07.720
Let's see.

01:55:07.720 --> 01:55:11.720
Going to chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

01:55:11.720 --> 01:55:17.720
S2100matt says, I would watch a video of Loki showing how he mods his DDR machine.

01:55:17.720 --> 01:55:19.720
Then again, that kind of promotes piracy.

01:55:19.720 --> 01:55:20.720
Yeah, you gotta watch that stuff.

01:55:20.720 --> 01:55:23.720
Just remember, everything you do is being recorded, right?

01:55:23.720 --> 01:55:25.720
Oh, how he mod it?

01:55:25.720 --> 01:55:27.720
Yeah, I mean, I wish it was complicated.

01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:34.720
But all it really is is literally just swapping out the drive for a DVD drive that's compatible with.

01:55:34.720 --> 01:55:37.720
And then popping any burned disc off the internet.

01:55:37.720 --> 01:55:42.720
Which is ironic because I'm still playing Extreme because all the other mods didn't work quite right.

01:55:42.720 --> 01:55:44.720
So I'm back to Extreme again.

01:55:44.720 --> 01:55:49.720
I'm running it off the mod disc because I'm too afraid to try to pop the original disc back in there.

01:55:49.720 --> 01:55:51.720
Because I may have to reinstall everything.

01:55:51.720 --> 01:55:53.720
And, yeah.

01:55:53.720 --> 01:55:57.720
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, bring it back as a Phantasy Star Online Blueburst podcast.

01:55:57.720 --> 01:55:59.720
Hey, hey, you tease.

01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:01.720
But I think that's also really good.

01:56:01.720 --> 01:56:03.720
It's a livestream kind of thing.

01:56:03.720 --> 01:56:06.720
And then Bob Coffee says, disco is really great.

01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:08.720
Most Star Trek asked Star Trek in like 84 years.

01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:11.720
But nobody was saying that after the first season.

01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:12.720
Isn't that funny?

01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:14.720
It's almost like the first season was just like all set.

01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:15.720
The first season was just a setup.

01:56:15.720 --> 01:56:17.720
It's all it was to get us to this point.

01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:20.720
And now, now, like, engage, right?

01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:21.720
Now we're going.

01:56:21.720 --> 01:56:25.720
Anyway, and then, like I said, Beetlejuice three times.

01:56:25.720 --> 01:56:26.720
Shane showed up in chat.

01:56:26.720 --> 01:56:28.720
I'm not doing anything. You're right.

01:56:28.720 --> 01:56:30.720
But you're here.

01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:31.720
You're showing up here.

01:56:31.720 --> 01:56:33.720
You show up on my livestream.

01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:37.720
And, you know, Shane, we should, like, do a show about, like, Pokemon.

01:56:37.720 --> 01:56:38.720
Wouldn't that be a lot of fun?

01:56:38.720 --> 01:56:40.720
Because I play a lot of Pokemon Go.

01:56:40.720 --> 01:56:42.720
Oh, yeah, wait, we tried that.

01:56:42.720 --> 01:56:45.720
Hey, but if shaking and crying can come back, anything's possible, right?

01:56:45.720 --> 01:56:46.720
Who knows?

01:56:46.720 --> 01:56:47.720
Who knows?

01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:50.720
Maybe Shane will find a show he wants to do in the future.

01:56:50.720 --> 01:56:54.720
Just do, like, the best little Pokestop and just kind of combine all of them.

01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:57.720
Do you remember there was a, the whole thing, there was a Pokestop podcast.

01:56:57.720 --> 01:56:58.720
Do you remember that?

01:56:58.720 --> 01:56:59.720
Yes, I remember there was a Pokestop podcast.

01:56:59.720 --> 01:57:00.720
That's what I'm saying.

01:57:00.720 --> 01:57:05.720
You mesh all the shows you don't really have enough passion for together to make one show.

01:57:05.720 --> 01:57:07.720
Just kind of combine the passion.

01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:08.720
This is Katamari.

01:57:08.720 --> 01:57:09.720
Yes.

01:57:09.720 --> 01:57:11.720
Katamari, but game fandom.

01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:12.720
Yeah, some of that.

01:57:12.720 --> 01:57:13.720
All right, anyway.

01:57:13.720 --> 01:57:14.720
Look, we got to get to another email.

01:57:14.720 --> 01:57:15.720
Fandomari.

01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:16.720
Fandomari.

01:57:16.720 --> 01:57:18.720
Oh, my God, that's a good name for a show.

01:57:18.720 --> 01:57:19.720
That's a good, patent pending.

01:57:19.720 --> 01:57:24.720
All right.

01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:29.720
Our last and second email tonight for Dark Tetsuya, who's in our chat room, but he used

01:57:29.720 --> 01:57:36.720
an email to expand on his thoughts, which I appreciate, which is a Damon Cross Machina.

01:57:36.720 --> 01:57:39.720
I don't know if I'm saying the name of that game right.

01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:41.720
The thoughts, the demo impressions.

01:57:41.720 --> 01:57:42.720
Remember, I didn't watch the direct.

01:57:42.720 --> 01:57:44.720
I was only able to get the play by play on Twitter.

01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:46.720
So I don't even know if I'm saying it right.

01:57:46.720 --> 01:57:47.720
But anyway.

01:57:47.720 --> 01:57:48.720
It's Damon X Machina.

01:57:48.720 --> 01:57:49.720
That's OK.

01:57:49.720 --> 01:57:50.720
So I was I was close.

01:57:50.720 --> 01:57:51.720
All right.

01:57:51.720 --> 01:57:52.720
Hey, O.L.R.

01:57:52.720 --> 01:57:56.720
So with the release of the preview of Damon X Machina, I checked it out as soon as it

01:57:56.720 --> 01:57:58.720
launched and spent the week trying to complete it.

01:57:58.720 --> 01:58:01.720
So I wanted to send my impressions of the demo right out of the gate.

01:58:01.720 --> 01:58:04.720
You can customize your avatar's appearance in his or her uniform color.

01:58:04.720 --> 01:58:05.720
Oh, that's more than anthem.

01:58:05.720 --> 01:58:06.720
I'll let you do.

01:58:06.720 --> 01:58:08.720
I said I said I wouldn't be shady.

01:58:08.720 --> 01:58:09.720
I'm sorry.

01:58:09.720 --> 01:58:10.720
All right.

01:58:10.720 --> 01:58:15.800
To make it whatever you want, as well as various customization options for your mech, different

01:58:15.800 --> 01:58:20.480
parts, weapons and some internal upgrades, as well as, of course, customizes paint job

01:58:20.480 --> 01:58:23.440
as well and add decals to put on your neck.

01:58:23.440 --> 01:58:26.200
Looks like there will be a wide variety of parts.

01:58:26.200 --> 01:58:30.360
And then you're thrown into your first tutorial mission to get a feel for the game.

01:58:30.360 --> 01:58:31.360
Controls are pretty simple.

01:58:31.360 --> 01:58:35.020
One button for each arm and one, I believe, for secondary weapons like missiles.

01:58:35.020 --> 01:58:39.400
And you can also use jump jets to fly over everything or descend back onto the ground,

01:58:39.400 --> 01:58:42.640
as well as a dash maneuver to avoid enemies and gunfire.

01:58:42.640 --> 01:58:45.600
Lock on is automatic, though the camera doesn't lock on enemies.

01:58:45.600 --> 01:58:46.600
You have to track it yourself.

01:58:46.600 --> 01:58:50.080
But once you get the hang of the controls, it becomes second nature and you'll be flying,

01:58:50.080 --> 01:58:53.160
dashing and dodging enemies and returning fire with ease.

01:58:53.160 --> 01:58:56.720
The music is pretty cool with a very heavy metal inspired soundtrack.

01:58:56.720 --> 01:59:00.360
Works pretty well in the background of giant robots blowing stuff up.

01:59:00.360 --> 01:59:01.360
The demo is pretty generous.

01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:05.640
You get the tutorial mission and three extra ones, culminating with a fight against a giant

01:59:05.640 --> 01:59:07.880
spider tank mech.

01:59:07.880 --> 01:59:09.140
Rad.

01:59:09.140 --> 01:59:12.360
This is definitely the toughest mission I've come across, so you might be at this one for

01:59:12.360 --> 01:59:13.360
a while.

01:59:13.360 --> 01:59:16.520
Overall, I was quite happy with what the developers came up with in this game.

01:59:16.520 --> 01:59:21.320
They've even sent out a survey to demo players to get their thoughts and anything they might

01:59:21.320 --> 01:59:22.840
want to change or improve.

01:59:22.840 --> 01:59:26.640
So I'm definitely looking forward to playing the final game.

01:59:26.640 --> 01:59:27.800
Thank you very much for sharing your thoughts.

01:59:27.800 --> 01:59:31.960
I appreciate the little mini review, especially when I have not gotten around to playing it

01:59:31.960 --> 01:59:32.960
myself.

01:59:32.960 --> 01:59:33.960
But you did.

01:59:33.960 --> 01:59:34.960
And you weren't as glowing.

01:59:34.960 --> 01:59:38.640
I mean, I got bored after the first mission, so maybe it gets better, but I just didn't

01:59:38.640 --> 01:59:39.640
care.

01:59:39.640 --> 01:59:41.200
Do you think maybe you need to go back and just play a few more missions to see?

01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:42.200
I didn't want to.

01:59:42.200 --> 01:59:43.200
Like, I don't know.

01:59:44.080 --> 01:59:47.400
I basically went to that because I got frustrated playing Tetris 99.

01:59:47.400 --> 01:59:48.760
Well, I wouldn't say get frustrated.

01:59:48.760 --> 01:59:52.240
I just got bored with it because you can only play you can probably play that for like a

01:59:52.240 --> 01:59:53.240
little bit.

01:59:53.240 --> 01:59:57.120
And it's just like, eh, I'm tired of playing Tetris, so I'll try this out.

01:59:57.120 --> 02:00:00.720
And then I it just didn't really click with me, I guess.

02:00:00.720 --> 02:00:02.520
I mean, doesn't mean it's a bad game.

02:00:02.520 --> 02:00:05.280
I just sure didn't really draw in Fortnite.

02:00:05.280 --> 02:00:08.940
Like I've really tried with Fortnite, but it's just not it doesn't I haven't tried any

02:00:08.940 --> 02:00:09.940
of the battle royale games.

02:00:09.940 --> 02:00:11.360
I just don't really have an interest in them.

02:00:11.400 --> 02:00:13.560
So I know a lot of people play them.

02:00:13.560 --> 02:00:15.760
I think it'd be more fun, like playing in a group of people.

02:00:15.760 --> 02:00:17.360
I'm going to try Apex again.

02:00:17.360 --> 02:00:18.360
I am.

02:00:18.360 --> 02:00:19.840
I especially on PlayStation 4.

02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:23.200
Is it easier to party up in Apex?

02:00:23.200 --> 02:00:26.120
You get thrown in matchmaking and it just gives you two random people.

02:00:26.120 --> 02:00:29.440
Oh, and I suppose you're at the mercy of who you get, but you can have a party of people.

02:00:29.440 --> 02:00:30.440
Oh, sure.

02:00:30.440 --> 02:00:31.440
You can.

02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:32.440
Yeah.

02:00:32.440 --> 02:00:33.440
You get bonuses, too, if you party with other people.

02:00:33.440 --> 02:00:34.440
OK.

02:00:34.440 --> 02:00:35.440
So you can definitely do that.

02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:36.440
So.

02:00:36.440 --> 02:00:37.440
Yeah.

02:00:37.440 --> 02:00:38.440
Anyhow.

02:00:38.440 --> 02:00:39.440
Let's see other comments in our chat.

02:00:39.520 --> 02:00:42.680
Articio says, I know it's not for everyone, but I really got into it.

02:00:42.680 --> 02:00:44.040
Quest Buster says demo is fun.

02:00:44.040 --> 02:00:45.280
It needed cyber legs.

02:00:45.280 --> 02:00:50.760
Got cyber legs at depth, pointing out as far as battle royales go, Tetris 99 is so good.

02:00:50.760 --> 02:00:51.760
That's a good battle.

02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:52.760
We're good.

02:00:52.760 --> 02:00:53.760
Yeah, that's a good one to get your feet wet on.

02:00:53.760 --> 02:00:59.840
So I am here for more like of those types of like mega multiplayer games in different

02:00:59.840 --> 02:01:00.840
genres.

02:01:00.840 --> 02:01:02.080
Dr. Mario 99.

02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:03.080
Sure.

02:01:03.080 --> 02:01:04.520
We can do a couple more puzzle games.

02:01:04.520 --> 02:01:09.880
But how about how about in Super Mario Maker, 100 people take on the same level at once

02:01:09.880 --> 02:01:13.720
with all these shadow Mario's bouncing everywhere would be hilarious.

02:01:13.720 --> 02:01:14.720
I don't know.

02:01:14.720 --> 02:01:16.720
I think it'd be fun.

02:01:16.720 --> 02:01:17.720
All right.

02:01:17.720 --> 02:01:18.720
Anyhow.

02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:22.760
Oh, Miltonia's games from my heart.

02:01:22.760 --> 02:01:24.320
One versus 100.

02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:26.680
The original battle royale game show battle royale.

02:01:26.680 --> 02:01:27.680
Of course.

02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:28.680
Of course.

02:01:28.680 --> 02:01:29.680
Maybe something Jackbox.

02:01:29.680 --> 02:01:31.680
Because we we talked about this on the show.

02:01:31.680 --> 02:01:32.680
I don't repeat myself too much.

02:01:32.680 --> 02:01:35.920
Jackbox, you know, they build their games for lots and lots of people, but you sort

02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:39.000
of have to like invite people there.

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.360
They don't match make people for those games, really.

02:01:41.360 --> 02:01:43.920
So because, you know, it kind of would alter that party atmosphere.

02:01:43.920 --> 02:01:47.000
But I would love to see a Jackbox game with matchmaking.

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:48.640
I think there's an audience for that.

02:01:48.640 --> 02:01:51.560
I think there's an audience for a game that you don't just play with your friends.

02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:53.400
You play with strangers.

02:01:53.400 --> 02:01:59.280
And oh, my God, like patent pending, Jackbox, how about a game called like talk to strangers

02:01:59.280 --> 02:02:01.400
or a game called strangers with candy?

02:02:01.400 --> 02:02:03.960
Well, maybe that would conflict with the TV.

02:02:03.960 --> 02:02:04.960
Stranger danger.

02:02:04.960 --> 02:02:06.040
Stranger danger.

02:02:06.040 --> 02:02:07.040
Come on.

02:02:07.040 --> 02:02:08.040
There's a there's an untapped.

02:02:08.040 --> 02:02:09.040
Do we have anybody?

02:02:09.040 --> 02:02:10.040
Jackbox still listens to the show.

02:02:10.040 --> 02:02:14.640
There's an untapped well here of like games you play in matchmaking stuff, these mega

02:02:14.640 --> 02:02:15.640
games.

02:02:15.640 --> 02:02:20.560
But the whole joke is that it's people you don't know and how sick they can be a stranger

02:02:20.560 --> 02:02:21.560
danger.

02:02:21.560 --> 02:02:22.920
That's a great name for a Jackbox game.

02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:23.920
Oh, my God.

02:02:23.920 --> 02:02:24.920
I hope they're watching.

02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:25.920
All right.

02:02:25.920 --> 02:02:26.920
Candy van.

02:02:26.920 --> 02:02:27.920
Candy van.

02:02:28.440 --> 02:02:33.160
They need to do a whole Jackbox party packages like battle royale type games, but game shows

02:02:33.160 --> 02:02:34.480
I would so be here.

02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:37.760
I don't know what their battle royale type game would be, but I'm totally down to see

02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:38.760
what it would be.

02:02:38.760 --> 02:02:42.120
Just do another voting game, another voting on like what's funnier.

02:02:42.120 --> 02:02:48.080
But then I think what they're probably worried about is that if you let people enter in anything,

02:02:48.080 --> 02:02:52.120
it's always going to go to, you know, dicks, butts, boobs, right?

02:02:52.120 --> 02:02:53.780
Like somebody's just going to put that as their answer.

02:02:53.780 --> 02:02:56.160
You could put in like, who is your favorite president?

02:02:56.400 --> 02:03:00.000
And somebody's going to put dicks, butts, boobs, right?

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:03.000
It's going to it's going to be ding ding.

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.440
And then that answer is going to get like 40 votes.

02:03:05.440 --> 02:03:08.880
And then it's like, oh, I let my seven year old play your filth ass game.

02:03:08.880 --> 02:03:11.280
And I'm a very upset parent because I didn't watch him.

02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:12.280
That's why it's emirated.

02:03:12.280 --> 02:03:13.280
So, you know, anyway.

02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:18.920
Well, I still remember back in the day with Acrophobia, which is a very similar thing.

02:03:18.920 --> 02:03:23.060
I mean, I think that Berkeley systems that made Acrophobia like a lot of those people

02:03:23.060 --> 02:03:24.800
are like Jackbox games now.

02:03:24.800 --> 02:03:25.800
Right.

02:03:25.940 --> 02:03:35.040
They had Acrophobia split into mature rooms where every acronym was like, you know, dicks,

02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:37.880
butts, fart, you know, pussy.

02:03:37.880 --> 02:03:40.840
Like it's just like every acronym is just like every dirty word you think of.

02:03:40.840 --> 02:03:41.840
Right.

02:03:41.840 --> 02:03:45.880
But then there was the clean rooms and their expectation was that in the clean rooms you

02:03:45.880 --> 02:03:47.920
play, you know, the not dirty stuff.

02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:52.280
And, you know, obviously the better experience obviously was in the clean rooms for the for

02:03:52.280 --> 02:03:53.280
the game.

02:03:53.280 --> 02:03:58.280
I still am hoping someday that they come up with a online version of Eat Poop You Cat

02:03:58.280 --> 02:04:02.200
because it's just the best.

02:04:02.200 --> 02:04:03.200
Yeah.

02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:06.640
Miltonius Games suggests a new title, Strangers with Cookies.

02:04:06.640 --> 02:04:10.040
That's I like it's a good like, you know what you mean?

02:04:10.040 --> 02:04:13.720
Anyway, I feel like we should be charging our one of our favorite gaming companies for

02:04:13.720 --> 02:04:15.400
a consultation right now.

02:04:15.400 --> 02:04:18.400
Anyway, at least a special thanks credit will be great.

02:04:18.400 --> 02:04:19.880
It's a little special thanks credit.

02:04:19.880 --> 02:04:20.880
So we ask.

02:04:20.880 --> 02:04:21.880
All right.

02:04:22.600 --> 02:04:23.600
Moving on.

02:04:26.120 --> 02:04:27.120
That was it for emails.

02:04:27.120 --> 02:04:29.040
Well, we got on quite a tangent with that email, but it was a good one.

02:04:29.040 --> 02:04:31.920
So anyway, let's get to some more news.

02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:34.200
Oh, I'm so happy to get back into the news.

02:04:34.200 --> 02:04:35.200
Yeah.

02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:36.200
Not with this story.

02:04:36.200 --> 02:04:37.200
More layout.

02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:38.200
Not with this.

02:04:38.200 --> 02:04:39.200
This is horrible.

02:04:39.200 --> 02:04:48.940
So EA, they have, I guess, apparently laid off some people from their Australian studio.

02:04:48.980 --> 02:04:54.620
So apparently it was previously Iron Monkey and Fireman Studios.

02:04:54.620 --> 02:04:57.020
And now it's, I guess, EA Australia.

02:04:57.020 --> 02:05:03.600
They were known for making Real Racing 3, The Sims Freeplay, and Need for Speed No Limits.

02:05:03.600 --> 02:05:07.800
And apparently they were also developing Real Racing 4, but I don't know if that's going

02:05:07.800 --> 02:05:09.980
to happen.

02:05:09.980 --> 02:05:15.060
They said that they haven't really talked about it's going to be close to.

02:05:16.060 --> 02:05:20.620
Yeah, they had a number, about 200 people at Firemonkeys, and they were saying that

02:05:20.620 --> 02:05:28.420
they were going to be estimating that 80 to 100 people were going to be laid off.

02:05:28.420 --> 02:05:33.420
But apparently that's now dropped down to 40 to 50, but still that's a pretty good chunk

02:05:33.420 --> 02:05:37.420
of their staff that's going to be laid off.

02:05:37.420 --> 02:05:43.600
And then they were saying the Firemonkeys studio is working on some of the most popular

02:05:43.600 --> 02:05:44.600
mobile games.

02:05:44.640 --> 02:05:50.800
We recently made the decision to shift teams to focus on more of our live services and

02:05:50.800 --> 02:05:55.600
to have entered into a consultation period that may impact some roles in the studio.

02:05:55.600 --> 02:05:59.840
We're working to match skills with opportunities as we go through this period, identifying

02:05:59.840 --> 02:06:04.880
other opportunities at EA and providing as much help to our employees as we possibly

02:06:04.880 --> 02:06:05.880
can.

02:06:05.880 --> 02:06:13.360
And then they declined to talk about Real Racing 4, whether it's canceled or not.

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:15.360
That sucks.

02:06:15.360 --> 02:06:22.000
And then on top of that, outside of EA, apparently the arena net is also going to be laying off

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.480
people as well.

02:06:24.480 --> 02:06:30.360
There was an email that went out to employees from their CEO saying our lives, our live

02:06:30.360 --> 02:06:36.760
games business revenue is declining as our franchises age and delays in development on

02:06:36.760 --> 02:06:43.840
PC and mobile have created further drains against our revenue projects while operating

02:06:43.840 --> 02:06:46.680
costs in the west have increased.

02:06:46.680 --> 02:06:53.920
We are not sustainable and it's not going to set us up for future success.

02:06:53.920 --> 02:06:57.000
So they have to cut costs across the organization.

02:06:57.000 --> 02:07:01.760
Well that's obviously extremely disappointing, but at the same time, I look at arena net,

02:07:01.760 --> 02:07:04.960
they did Guild Wars 2, but that was how many years ago?

02:07:04.960 --> 02:07:10.040
And Guild Wars 2 doesn't charge a monthly fee, so I know there's been expansions and

02:07:10.040 --> 02:07:13.800
there's been other ways that they've been able to get money from the player base, but

02:07:13.800 --> 02:07:18.800
I feel like the lifespan of a game like Guild Wars 2 probably is about up, and we haven't

02:07:18.800 --> 02:07:23.880
heard of a Guild Wars 3 or anything, I mean I don't know what other games arena net even

02:07:23.880 --> 02:07:27.840
works on, which is probably part of the problem unfortunately, is that I associate them with

02:07:27.840 --> 02:07:33.240
Guild Wars and not a lot else, and it's just unfortunate.

02:07:33.240 --> 02:07:38.360
I wish they had something else they were working on that there was more awareness about that

02:07:38.360 --> 02:07:39.360
might...

02:07:39.360 --> 02:07:43.840
Yeah, they said that right now they have about 400 employees, and they haven't said how many

02:07:43.840 --> 02:07:50.600
employees are going to be affected by this, so I guess we'll have to wait and see, maybe

02:07:50.600 --> 02:07:53.880
later this week we'll understand what the impact is going to be on that, but that's

02:07:53.880 --> 02:07:54.880
unfortunate.

02:07:54.880 --> 02:07:59.240
I was trying to see what else, what other games arena net does, and there was Guild

02:07:59.240 --> 02:08:03.680
Wars, and there was five expansions for Guild Wars, and there was Guild Wars 2, and three

02:08:03.680 --> 02:08:08.400
expansions for Guild Wars 2, that's actually it.

02:08:08.400 --> 02:08:12.580
I was reminded though, is that, because I'm just looking at Wikipedia, a great place to

02:08:12.580 --> 02:08:18.280
just kind of get my mind reminded of certain things, there was a controversy a little while

02:08:18.280 --> 02:08:23.960
ago that went down on Twitter, I don't want to rehash that old controversy, but perhaps

02:08:23.960 --> 02:08:27.200
you just remember there was some stuff going on with arena net and some of the writing

02:08:27.200 --> 02:08:32.580
and so forth that happened about a year ago, I mean I don't know if there was a significant

02:08:32.580 --> 02:08:38.660
fallout from that, but certainly that coupled with the age of the game, coupled with there's

02:08:38.660 --> 02:08:43.440
nothing on their plate besides these Guild Wars games and no sign of the Guild Wars 3,

02:08:43.440 --> 02:08:49.520
it doesn't add up unfortunately to a very lovely scenario, but again I hate it because

02:08:49.520 --> 02:08:54.080
I don't like to hear people losing their jobs and so forth, I hope again they can get the

02:08:54.080 --> 02:08:59.360
capital, get the investment, the financing to start a new project, a lot of these folks

02:08:59.360 --> 02:09:04.600
got expertise developing online games, I know people that love Guild Wars, and heck, the

02:09:04.600 --> 02:09:09.280
people that founded arena net used to work for Blizzard, so sometimes you take these

02:09:09.280 --> 02:09:13.560
skills and take them other places.

02:09:13.560 --> 02:09:18.520
Questbuster in chat points out they just had a big event in Guild Wars 2 to end a big story

02:09:18.520 --> 02:09:22.260
arc, so it does kind of sound like the game's probably ramping down, but I'm sure the original

02:09:22.260 --> 02:09:27.700
Guild Wars still has people playing it, you know, hello, I just talked about that we're

02:09:27.700 --> 02:09:32.060
playing Phantasy Star online, there's just always going to be online games you remember

02:09:32.060 --> 02:09:36.540
you want to go visit, and those games really lend themselves to being able to do it, right?

02:09:36.540 --> 02:09:37.540
Yeah.

02:09:37.540 --> 02:09:43.660
So anyway, well wishes, I mean they haven't laid off yet, they're trying to not do what

02:09:43.660 --> 02:09:47.540
Activision just did and they're trying to really warn people and this whole thing, right,

02:09:47.540 --> 02:09:49.540
is this not my understanding?

02:09:49.540 --> 02:09:50.540
Yeah.

02:09:50.540 --> 02:09:54.260
Well, and they haven't really said how many are going to be affected yet, so.

02:09:54.260 --> 02:09:55.260
Yeah.

02:09:55.260 --> 02:09:56.260
Hope it goes okay.

02:09:56.260 --> 02:10:01.620
Alright, anyway, let's move on to somebody that's profiting in a different way, you guys

02:10:01.620 --> 02:10:06.540
probably are familiar with a popular game streamer who's been on talk shows and things

02:10:06.540 --> 02:10:13.000
like that, Ninja, whose real name is Tyler Blevins, who I will admit I haven't really

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:17.500
watched, I have seen some of his appearances on these other things, I have seen the ads

02:10:17.500 --> 02:10:20.820
that popped in his stream for some of the festivals he was working with, but I'm not

02:10:20.820 --> 02:10:25.900
very familiar with his content, but that's not shade against him, props to him, he does

02:10:25.900 --> 02:10:31.380
something, he's done it very well, and as long as he is spreading a message of positivity

02:10:31.380 --> 02:10:38.700
for the community and not a message of being an asshole, then hooray for you, right?

02:10:38.700 --> 02:10:40.180
Like I got nothing against him.

02:10:40.180 --> 02:10:41.180
Is he a positive guy?

02:10:41.180 --> 02:10:42.180
I don't know.

02:10:42.180 --> 02:10:46.420
Uh oh, alright, well then maybe I'm better off being ignorant in this case.

02:10:46.420 --> 02:10:54.820
Alright, but anyway, apparently he's teaming up with Wicked Cool Toys, who's doing, I guess,

02:10:54.820 --> 02:10:58.660
like not just like a t-shirt and stickers and that sort of thing, which by the way,

02:10:58.660 --> 02:11:03.060
if you like to support your favorite streamers with that kind of merchandise, we're working

02:11:03.060 --> 02:11:04.060
on it.

02:11:04.060 --> 02:11:05.060
We're working on it.

02:11:05.060 --> 02:11:06.340
That's what I'm going to say.

02:11:06.340 --> 02:11:10.620
Bobby's already like, technically if you know where to look, you could already get some

02:11:10.620 --> 02:11:14.620
Bobby branded stuff, but I'm lagging behind a little bit.

02:11:14.620 --> 02:11:21.460
Anyway, you can get some two inch collectibles in certain packs, $5 each for little figures,

02:11:21.460 --> 02:11:25.540
four inch dancing figures for $10 that are themed around the emotes and the characters

02:11:25.540 --> 02:11:29.380
that are already in the streams, headwear for $20 if you want to have your own blue

02:11:29.380 --> 02:11:33.740
hair and headband and so forth, and there's other streamers that they're going to be working

02:11:33.740 --> 02:11:36.380
with as well, I guess, which is pretty cool.

02:11:36.380 --> 02:11:40.220
So yeah, I mean, everybody does it.

02:11:40.220 --> 02:11:44.460
Isn't it interesting now how, like, these are the types of things that I would expect

02:11:44.460 --> 02:11:49.260
around TV shows when I was a kid, like, well, but now this is what kids are considering,

02:11:49.260 --> 02:11:50.260
right?

02:11:50.260 --> 02:11:51.260
Your kids watch a lot.

02:11:51.260 --> 02:11:52.260
Not Ninja, specifically.

02:11:52.260 --> 02:11:53.300
No, they don't watch Ninja.

02:11:53.300 --> 02:11:54.300
They watch YouTubers, right?

02:11:54.300 --> 02:12:00.140
Yeah, they watch YouTubers, like, they kind of go back and forth about who they watch.

02:12:00.140 --> 02:12:07.640
Like for example, my kids are watching DanTDM again, and DanTDM, he has his own line of

02:12:07.640 --> 02:12:14.780
toys as well, some figures in his own, like, Minecraft book and stuff.

02:12:14.780 --> 02:12:21.940
So he's got all that around there, plus there's also, God, stupid Ryan Toy Review, who has

02:12:21.940 --> 02:12:24.280
his whole Ryan's toys lined up.

02:12:24.280 --> 02:12:29.980
My youngest son is just bonkers over, and they're just the cheapest piece of shit crap

02:12:29.980 --> 02:12:32.200
that you can buy, but he loves that stuff.

02:12:32.200 --> 02:12:33.200
He just doesn't play with it.

02:12:33.200 --> 02:12:34.200
He just needs it, though.

02:12:34.200 --> 02:12:38.680
He needs all of it, because Ryan's playing with it and looks up to him, but I mean, that

02:12:38.680 --> 02:12:43.320
stuff, there's a lot of, like, when you get that big, of course you're gonna have merchandise

02:12:43.320 --> 02:12:48.720
and make even more money, because it's only smart business, so more power to him, I guess,

02:12:48.720 --> 02:12:49.960
and it doesn't look like complete crap.

02:12:49.960 --> 02:12:55.040
At least those are kind of cute, so yeah, more power to him.

02:12:55.040 --> 02:12:57.240
Yeah, I think it's great.

02:12:57.240 --> 02:13:00.600
Sorry, I got distracted for a minute, because I was hearing Discord noises, and I couldn't

02:13:00.600 --> 02:13:03.380
tell if that was coming through on our stream or not.

02:13:03.380 --> 02:13:08.540
So I thought I shut down Discord, hopefully I did, I'm gonna just quit that way so those

02:13:08.540 --> 02:13:12.020
sounds don't come through on stream, so sorry if I made you think your Discord noises were

02:13:12.020 --> 02:13:16.540
going through, but just in general, during the show is not a good time to send me DMs

02:13:16.540 --> 02:13:19.420
on Discord, just throwing it out there.

02:13:19.420 --> 02:13:21.380
Very bad time to try to get my attention on Discord.

02:13:21.380 --> 02:13:25.140
Oh, and they're doing blind box figures, everybody does fucking blind boxes.

02:13:25.140 --> 02:13:29.140
Unless you are one individual who hosts a show before this one, because you have to

02:13:29.140 --> 02:13:31.820
tell me things about when I can take the stream and stuff.

02:13:31.860 --> 02:13:37.100
Alright, anyway, so when are we going to release our figures?

02:13:37.100 --> 02:13:39.820
We have people asking, when do we get the broccoli farm shirts?

02:13:39.820 --> 02:13:42.100
I never made them.

02:13:42.100 --> 02:13:46.520
Alright, anyway, let's move on, we have a few more stories for you guys before we will

02:13:46.520 --> 02:13:51.380
get to Discord and open that up for your calls in our green room, but first...

02:13:51.380 --> 02:13:54.460
Someday though, if I have free time, I will definitely design it.

02:13:54.460 --> 02:13:56.740
First we have a few more stories for you guys.

02:13:56.740 --> 02:13:58.300
You're taking this one, right, Loki, about the...

02:13:58.300 --> 02:14:02.340
Yeah, so let's talk a little bit about HoloLens.

02:14:02.340 --> 02:14:10.780
So Microsoft, some of their employees are demanding that Microsoft terminate their contract

02:14:10.780 --> 02:14:14.580
with the US military because they feel that they're...

02:14:14.580 --> 02:14:17.460
Sorry, this is delayed, I have to get this out though, because this made a lightning

02:14:17.460 --> 02:14:20.260
bolt go off in my head to go, oh, oh, oh!

02:14:20.260 --> 02:14:24.220
Apricot sushi in our chat, which is not a name I recognize, so hello and welcome, says

02:14:24.220 --> 02:14:26.980
I was trying to remember what Ninja did that was crappy.

02:14:26.980 --> 02:14:31.020
She's the guy who said he doesn't stream with female gamers to avoid rumors or something.

02:14:31.020 --> 02:14:32.540
That was the weird thing.

02:14:32.540 --> 02:14:35.860
Oh, I thought he also dropped the other F bomb.

02:14:35.860 --> 02:14:38.660
Oh, I hope, oh, I hope not.

02:14:38.660 --> 02:14:42.100
On accident, because he was mad at somebody.

02:14:42.100 --> 02:14:44.140
Okay, that's not cool.

02:14:44.140 --> 02:14:47.780
If true, that's not cool, but if I don't have the receipts in front of me, I'm not going

02:14:47.780 --> 02:14:52.660
to pay that on him right now, but in general, please don't...

02:14:52.660 --> 02:14:56.960
If you have words like that in your vocabulary, and there are other very, very bad ones to

02:14:56.960 --> 02:15:01.760
that you shouldn't say on stream, you should consider removing them completely from your

02:15:01.760 --> 02:15:06.080
vocabulary, because there's certain words that you don't say ever.

02:15:06.080 --> 02:15:07.920
Consider your audience, how about that?

02:15:07.920 --> 02:15:08.920
That too.

02:15:08.920 --> 02:15:09.920
Anyhow.

02:15:09.920 --> 02:15:17.080
Anyways, so there's a group of Microsoft workers that are called Microsoft Workers for Good,

02:15:17.080 --> 02:15:25.160
and they have basically put together an open letter to their executive saying that, hey,

02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:33.260
we did not sign up to develop weapons, and we demand a say in how our work is being used,

02:15:33.260 --> 02:15:39.420
because they had signed a $479 million contract with the army to develop augmented reality

02:15:39.420 --> 02:15:44.600
technology for use in combat, and they said augmented reality technology will provide

02:15:44.600 --> 02:15:52.920
troops with more than better information to make decisions, and this new work extends

02:15:52.920 --> 02:15:57.960
to a long-standing, trusted relationship with the Department of Defense into this new area,

02:15:57.960 --> 02:16:03.560
and with that, they said, we've worked with the U.S. Department of Defense on a long-standing

02:16:03.560 --> 02:16:08.360
and reliable basis for four decades, and you'll find Microsoft technology throughout the American

02:16:08.360 --> 02:16:13.680
military helping power its front office, fuel operations bases, ships, aircraft training

02:16:13.680 --> 02:16:19.720
facilities, and we're proud of this relationship, as we are of the many military veterans we

02:16:19.720 --> 02:16:26.600
employ, but still, though, the people that are working on these projects don't like the

02:16:26.600 --> 02:16:34.280
fact that it's gonna provide increased lethality, mobility, situational awareness necessary

02:16:34.280 --> 02:16:41.680
to achieve, overmatch against our current and future adversaries.

02:16:41.680 --> 02:16:42.680
I don't know.

02:16:42.680 --> 02:16:45.760
So they're just against the whole contract thing, but I don't know if they-

02:16:45.760 --> 02:16:51.720
This is a complicated story, and one that I'm not sure we can solve here on OLR, even

02:16:51.720 --> 02:16:58.720
necessary one that we can get into the nitty-gritty details of, but it is fascinating how, and

02:16:58.720 --> 02:17:03.200
obviously it's about gaming because Microsoft does the gaming stuff, and a lot of people

02:17:03.200 --> 02:17:08.480
have thought about HoloLens as what's next for gaming because Microsoft has brought it

02:17:08.480 --> 02:17:12.120
out on stage at E3 and shown the Minecraft and HoloLens and all this stuff.

02:17:12.120 --> 02:17:17.720
Instead of thinking of it as a way to make soldiers more lethal, I would think of it

02:17:17.720 --> 02:17:26.720
as a way to prevent, to help the soldiers from not getting killed, I should say, to

02:17:26.720 --> 02:17:28.280
protect them more.

02:17:28.280 --> 02:17:31.600
Look at it that way, and it doesn't seem as bad, but if you look at it as like, oh, it's

02:17:31.600 --> 02:17:35.560
gonna make these future soldiers that are just gonna be super lethal, I don't think

02:17:35.560 --> 02:17:36.560
that's really what's gonna happen here.

02:17:36.560 --> 02:17:39.080
Yeah, HoloLens is not gonna turn people into Robocop.

02:17:39.080 --> 02:17:40.080
Yeah.

02:17:40.080 --> 02:17:41.080
Yeah.

02:17:41.120 --> 02:17:42.120
It is very interesting.

02:17:42.120 --> 02:17:45.640
Well, I mean, but we know, I think now, like HoloLens, and I guess they just announced

02:17:45.640 --> 02:17:48.520
HoloLens 2 today, because Bobby got into it on his show a little bit.

02:17:48.520 --> 02:17:49.520
Yes, it looks awesome.

02:17:49.520 --> 02:17:54.720
Yeah, but, you know, again, not really, and as Bobby pointed out in the trailer, if you

02:17:54.720 --> 02:17:56.880
watch trailer, you don't see games in that trailer.

02:17:56.880 --> 02:18:01.520
You see the real world applications, that thing, like fixing cars and bikes and surgeries

02:18:01.520 --> 02:18:03.440
and things like that, which is really, you know, it's cool.

02:18:03.440 --> 02:18:07.680
And once again, they don't show the depth, you know, the field of view that's on there.

02:18:07.680 --> 02:18:10.680
They say it's double in size, but I don't know if it was...

02:18:10.680 --> 02:18:15.400
The old one was, it wasn't bad, but like, you know, because I've been lucky enough to

02:18:15.400 --> 02:18:20.080
try one, thanks to Bobby, and, you know, it's, again, I kind of look at it as like a concept

02:18:20.080 --> 02:18:23.480
thing, and like as a concept, I really enjoyed HoloLens.

02:18:23.480 --> 02:18:24.480
I really, really did.

02:18:24.480 --> 02:18:29.400
I almost kind of like, like there's things about it I liked better than VR, and probably

02:18:29.400 --> 02:18:32.840
a lot of it was the headset, because it felt, you know, it was kind of big, but it wasn't

02:18:32.840 --> 02:18:36.680
like, you know, it felt a little more, and then this one looks like it's scaled down

02:18:36.680 --> 02:18:40.960
even more, where it's just like the glasses and so forth, and, you know, the interactive

02:18:40.960 --> 02:18:44.800
detective game that he was showing me that we were playing, which I know he streamed

02:18:44.800 --> 02:18:49.980
at some point on his channel, it's probably in his archives, is really neat.

02:18:49.980 --> 02:18:54.680
Like it's cool that you can like scan the room and stuff, and the actors like participate

02:18:54.680 --> 02:18:58.800
in the room and everything, so like it definitely has like potential in gaming, even if not

02:18:58.800 --> 02:19:04.800
fully realized yet, but it's interesting that this time, unlike Kinect, which was developed

02:19:04.840 --> 02:19:09.140
for games and then kind of became this thing that really wasn't games, it's interesting

02:19:09.140 --> 02:19:12.320
that HoloLens is taking this approach where it's like, okay, we're kind of like the other

02:19:12.320 --> 02:19:18.400
stuff and maybe games will happen, which is kind of what personal computing was always

02:19:18.400 --> 02:19:19.480
about, right?

02:19:19.480 --> 02:19:22.200
Were personal computers made for gaming?

02:19:22.200 --> 02:19:27.880
No, but it was a very, you know, things like word processing and spreadsheets and those

02:19:27.880 --> 02:19:31.680
sorts of things, right, were some of the early things in computing, and it's like, oh, but

02:19:31.680 --> 02:19:34.760
it plays games too, that's even better, you know, and I think maybe that's maybe the

02:19:34.760 --> 02:19:37.680
approach Microsoft's taking with HoloLens, but anyway, I don't want to digress too much

02:19:37.680 --> 02:19:41.160
from the topic, which is about the Department of Defense using it.

02:19:41.160 --> 02:19:46.120
I think being able to have these like glasses that, you know, would show you basically like

02:19:46.120 --> 02:19:51.000
a HUD, you know, I don't know what they're doing for defense, so maybe my brain just

02:19:51.000 --> 02:19:53.280
goes to what do I see when I play Call of Duty?

02:19:53.280 --> 02:19:57.880
I might see a radar, you know, that shows me a map of this terrain I'm in or something

02:19:57.880 --> 02:20:01.960
like that, which could be like, you know, imagine like if they're, you know, my brain

02:20:01.960 --> 02:20:04.960
can't help but go to here, I'm sorry if it's inappropriate, but I think about the stories

02:20:04.960 --> 02:20:08.840
I hear about the raid when they went to go get Osama bin Laden and all that, right?

02:20:08.840 --> 02:20:10.400
You hear those stories about that, right?

02:20:10.400 --> 02:20:16.560
Imagine if like the layout of that house had been something that was like in, like on their

02:20:16.560 --> 02:20:18.600
vision and stuff, you know what I mean?

02:20:18.600 --> 02:20:19.600
Yeah.

02:20:19.600 --> 02:20:23.920
Yeah, and you know, that would be so like interesting and how that would have like changed

02:20:23.920 --> 02:20:28.200
it and maybe helped them and so forth and further with what they were doing.

02:20:28.200 --> 02:20:33.240
I think it's fascinating, but I also understand why some people don't want to be involved

02:20:33.240 --> 02:20:37.600
in making, because if it's used for defense, hypothetically in the wrong hands, it could

02:20:37.600 --> 02:20:39.160
be used for offense, right?

02:20:39.160 --> 02:20:43.000
And I understand why some people want to wash their hands of that.

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:47.760
But isn't AR in general kind of like a growing thing anyway?

02:20:47.760 --> 02:20:48.760
Yeah.

02:20:48.760 --> 02:20:53.160
So if not Microsoft, we know Google Glass was a thing not that long ago.

02:20:53.160 --> 02:20:55.860
Yes, they have Magic Leap also doing stuff, right?

02:20:55.860 --> 02:20:58.700
So if not Microsoft, won't somebody else?

02:20:58.700 --> 02:20:59.700
Someone is.

02:20:59.700 --> 02:21:00.700
Yeah.

02:21:00.700 --> 02:21:01.700
So I don't know.

02:21:01.700 --> 02:21:05.660
I mean, like I would just think, whereas I don't want to diminish the concerns and heck,

02:21:05.660 --> 02:21:08.740
if anybody wants to come on the show and like talk about it from this perspective, I would

02:21:08.740 --> 02:21:09.740
so invite that.

02:21:09.740 --> 02:21:11.100
It would be awesome.

02:21:11.100 --> 02:21:16.420
But at the same time, I'm just kind of like, at least if you're the one kind of developing

02:21:16.420 --> 02:21:21.740
it, you can kind of help make sure it's a good guys emphasize thing that it's going

02:21:21.740 --> 02:21:26.320
to be something the good guys use and not something used for attack or aggression or

02:21:26.320 --> 02:21:27.820
so forth.

02:21:27.820 --> 02:21:36.100
Anyway, going to chat over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network, Tigerclaw says, so they want

02:21:36.100 --> 02:21:39.980
to use the HoloLens as a way for soldiers to be able to see information during combat,

02:21:39.980 --> 02:21:43.080
kind of like what you see on those futuristic FPS games where the helmet they wear shows

02:21:43.080 --> 02:21:44.240
the info on the screen.

02:21:44.240 --> 02:21:45.620
We don't know, Tigerclaw.

02:21:45.620 --> 02:21:47.060
We kind of have to make it up.

02:21:47.060 --> 02:21:51.940
And when your brain kind of doesn't know things, you fill in the gaps with your perceptions.

02:21:51.940 --> 02:21:56.300
And for us as gamers, our perceptions is these video games like Call of Duty and these other

02:21:56.300 --> 02:21:57.300
games we play.

02:21:57.300 --> 02:22:01.220
So that's so we don't really know, because, well, I like to know what I like.

02:22:01.220 --> 02:22:05.540
The picture that they show was that Trimble has a version of the HoloLens 2 that's built

02:22:05.540 --> 02:22:09.900
into a hard hat because they're using it for like construction and engineering and that

02:22:09.900 --> 02:22:10.900
type of stuff.

02:22:10.900 --> 02:22:11.900
Well, that's pretty awesome.

02:22:11.900 --> 02:22:12.900
Yeah.

02:22:13.180 --> 02:22:14.180
And then let's see.

02:22:14.180 --> 02:22:19.500
Bobby Black Wolf says HoloLens 2 uses the next Gen Connect, Azure Connect, which I'm

02:22:19.500 --> 02:22:21.260
guessing is cloud supported connect.

02:22:21.260 --> 02:22:23.740
Nobody knows how they're actually using HoloLens 2.

02:22:23.740 --> 02:22:28.020
And then S2100 Matt says, remember when Iraq bought thousands of PlayStation 2s to try

02:22:28.020 --> 02:22:30.100
to power their missile guidance system?

02:22:30.100 --> 02:22:33.180
Not sure if that actually happened or not, but I remember it was talked about.

02:22:33.180 --> 02:22:36.880
I remember something about our military using PlayStation 3s because they were affected

02:22:36.880 --> 02:22:38.420
by the other OS removal.

02:22:38.420 --> 02:22:41.780
Well, they weren't because those systems definitely didn't connect to the internet because they

02:22:42.020 --> 02:22:46.940
But like they were super computers at a very low price.

02:22:46.940 --> 02:22:49.460
That was part of what made those PlayStation 3s.

02:22:49.460 --> 02:22:50.460
Yeah, because of the cell processor.

02:22:50.460 --> 02:22:51.460
Exactly.

02:22:51.460 --> 02:22:53.500
So that's what made that whole thing attractive.

02:22:53.500 --> 02:23:00.780
So yeah, military has and we've heard that games like America's Army and stuff have been

02:23:00.780 --> 02:23:03.880
used to recruit for the military and so forth.

02:23:03.880 --> 02:23:04.880
So if you think there's no...

02:23:04.880 --> 02:23:06.300
That's a game we haven't seen in a long time.

02:23:06.300 --> 02:23:08.860
I'm surprised they haven't tried to put out a new America's Army game.

02:23:08.860 --> 02:23:09.860
Who knows?

02:23:09.860 --> 02:23:13.180
But anyway, if you think there isn't crossover with gaming when it comes to some things like

02:23:13.180 --> 02:23:14.180
this, just wait.

02:23:14.180 --> 02:23:19.180
And again, maybe now there's a little bit of pushback on what's ethically appropriate,

02:23:19.180 --> 02:23:22.120
I suppose, or what have you for the development of these things.

02:23:22.120 --> 02:23:27.220
But again, like they're saying, they're putting HoloLens in a hard hat.

02:23:27.220 --> 02:23:32.660
Maybe today that's prohibitively expensive for people to have everywhere.

02:23:32.660 --> 02:23:35.820
But again, where are we going to be in 10 years?

02:23:35.820 --> 02:23:39.500
And then the other thing I was going to mention along with the HoloLens stuff, there is some

02:23:39.540 --> 02:23:43.900
other news around that, being that Epic Games has announced that they're adding HoloLens

02:23:43.900 --> 02:23:47.060
support to Unreal Engine 4.

02:23:47.060 --> 02:23:53.140
That they're saying that it'll allow people to use that to build games and 3D productivity

02:23:53.140 --> 02:23:54.500
apps.

02:23:54.500 --> 02:23:59.620
There's no games for it right now, but it's something that's going to be supported.

02:23:59.620 --> 02:24:02.620
So you could build something if you'd like.

02:24:02.620 --> 02:24:05.780
And maybe that's a better approach for something like this to take, is instead of launching

02:24:05.780 --> 02:24:11.540
it as a gaming thing, launch it as a productivity, a life thing, that the gaming is, oh, then

02:24:11.540 --> 02:24:12.980
the gaming just kind of builds on top of that.

02:24:12.980 --> 02:24:17.380
Well, a lot of people use Unreal Engine 4 as well for building architecture.

02:24:17.380 --> 02:24:22.220
So along with that whole thing we saw for Trimble, where they'd basically be using it

02:24:22.220 --> 02:24:26.540
at the job site to kind of visualize a 3D model or something like that.

02:24:26.540 --> 02:24:30.660
You have a building or something you're designing, I mean, I could see that kind of all tying

02:24:30.660 --> 02:24:31.660
together.

02:24:31.660 --> 02:24:34.420
All right, well, let's go to another type of AR.

02:24:34.420 --> 02:24:36.740
It's very different, but it's still AR.

02:24:36.740 --> 02:24:40.620
It's just a little, it's not quite the same type of technology.

02:24:40.620 --> 02:24:43.060
It's a little bit more scaled back, and that's Pokemon Go.

02:24:43.060 --> 02:24:45.240
I tried using the photo app.

02:24:45.240 --> 02:24:49.140
Which the photo app is, which they call AR mode, is even more augmented reality.

02:24:49.140 --> 02:24:53.640
But the fact that Pokemon Go makes you go to places in the real world to catch Pokemon,

02:24:53.640 --> 02:24:54.640
that is AR.

02:24:54.640 --> 02:24:55.640
Yeah.

02:24:55.640 --> 02:25:02.800
And then when you take a picture with your phone, that's kind of, I don't know, maybe

02:25:02.800 --> 02:25:07.160
Bobby's going to correct me on this, I don't know, but the Pokemon Go picture AR mode,

02:25:07.160 --> 02:25:11.300
that's a good way to know what HoloLens does.

02:25:11.300 --> 02:25:15.560
Because you're still seeing the world the way you would see it, it's just now you see

02:25:15.560 --> 02:25:19.240
cute little Pokemon on your screen that you're trying to throw the ball at and catch.

02:25:19.240 --> 02:25:21.140
Now imagine that right up against your face.

02:25:21.140 --> 02:25:24.040
That's what HoloLens is, basically.

02:25:24.040 --> 02:25:25.040
Except it's small.

02:25:25.040 --> 02:25:26.040
Well, yeah.

02:25:26.040 --> 02:25:27.040
But you know what I mean.

02:25:27.040 --> 02:25:28.040
You know what I'm getting at, right?

02:25:28.040 --> 02:25:29.040
Yeah.

02:25:29.040 --> 02:25:30.040
I know what you're getting at.

02:25:30.400 --> 02:25:34.200
But Pokemon Go is doing a new feature that some people have been asking for for a long

02:25:34.200 --> 02:25:37.480
time and it is the ability to change your team.

02:25:37.480 --> 02:25:41.520
So if you are on the yellow team and you're sick of your gyms already getting taken, you

02:25:41.520 --> 02:25:42.980
can now switch to red or blue.

02:25:42.980 --> 02:25:47.680
Or I don't want the Instinct players to hate me because the reality is now maybe some people,

02:25:47.680 --> 02:25:48.680
that will be the appeal for them.

02:25:48.680 --> 02:25:51.160
They're going to want to go to the less popular team.

02:25:51.160 --> 02:25:56.300
I got to admit, I'm given thought about going to yellow team just for the challenge and

02:25:56.300 --> 02:25:58.740
for the fun of being on the underdogs.

02:25:58.740 --> 02:25:59.740
Why not?

02:25:59.740 --> 02:26:01.940
Because there's an Ingress right now in this area, so why not do the same thing?

02:26:01.940 --> 02:26:02.940
What's the matter?

02:26:02.940 --> 02:26:04.940
There's no point to the teams yet anyways.

02:26:04.940 --> 02:26:05.940
Like maybe if you gave...

02:26:05.940 --> 02:26:06.940
The coins.

02:26:06.940 --> 02:26:07.940
The gyms.

02:26:07.940 --> 02:26:08.940
That's it.

02:26:08.940 --> 02:26:09.940
Yeah.

02:26:09.940 --> 02:26:13.220
Maybe you just gave me a purpose of there's some point to the actual teams other than

02:26:13.220 --> 02:26:15.900
collecting coins, which I have quite a few.

02:26:15.900 --> 02:26:16.900
Here's how to do it.

02:26:16.900 --> 02:26:17.900
Here's how to do it.

02:26:17.900 --> 02:26:21.900
So as of next week, February 26 specifically, at 1 p.m. they were going to enable a new

02:26:21.900 --> 02:26:24.500
item in the shop, a team medallion.

02:26:24.500 --> 02:26:29.160
It's going to set you back 1,000 Pokecoins, which conveniently you could buy with real

02:26:29.200 --> 02:26:32.120
world money, which I think is about, it's about 10 bucks.

02:26:32.120 --> 02:26:36.240
Well, no, because you get like more Pokecoins the more you spend, but about, we'll say about

02:26:36.240 --> 02:26:42.760
10 bucks, discounts if you spend more, or you can earn up to 50 coins a day playing

02:26:42.760 --> 02:26:43.760
the gym game.

02:26:43.760 --> 02:26:46.600
Well, yeah, per Pokemon you drop.

02:26:46.600 --> 02:26:48.260
But you're capped out at 50 a day.

02:26:48.260 --> 02:26:50.940
You don't get any more than 50 a day, no matter what.

02:26:50.940 --> 02:26:53.200
If you've earned more, this just happened to me yesterday.

02:26:53.200 --> 02:26:57.520
I got a Pokemon that came back, I got my coins, then when Snorlax or whatever I had at a third

02:26:57.520 --> 02:27:03.280
gym came back and said, Snorlax is back from a hard battle, 50 or maximum daily limit already

02:27:03.280 --> 02:27:04.280
reached.

02:27:04.280 --> 02:27:05.280
So you don't get any more coins.

02:27:05.280 --> 02:27:06.280
So 50 is the most you can get.

02:27:06.280 --> 02:27:09.160
So you do that for 20 days, you'd have a thousand coins.

02:27:09.160 --> 02:27:14.420
But anyway, so, but I mean, they got to pay the server bills and all that stuff somehow.

02:27:14.420 --> 02:27:17.600
So I imagine a lot of people are going to pay for it if they want to switch teams.

02:27:17.600 --> 02:27:20.760
I bet there's a lot of people that don't care and are going to just stay where they're at.

02:27:20.760 --> 02:27:22.320
There is one restriction.

02:27:22.320 --> 02:27:27.840
You can only use this once every 365 days.

02:27:27.840 --> 02:27:33.560
So I'm not sure exactly why they're doing that as a means to prevent some type of like

02:27:33.560 --> 02:27:35.820
maybe trolling or griefing or what have you.

02:27:35.820 --> 02:27:39.660
But they're also saying that if you have any Pokemon in gyms when you switch teams, they

02:27:39.660 --> 02:27:42.480
are returned with no Pokecoins earned.

02:27:42.480 --> 02:27:44.960
You cannot battle your own Pokemon.

02:27:44.960 --> 02:27:48.920
If you return to a gym that one of your Pokemon is defending, your Pokemon is coming back

02:27:48.920 --> 02:27:52.440
to you with no Pokecoins earned.

02:27:52.440 --> 02:27:54.440
So interesting.

02:27:54.440 --> 02:27:59.120
Finally that feature many people have been asking for.

02:27:59.120 --> 02:28:00.120
Let's see.

02:28:00.120 --> 02:28:01.120
Interesting.

02:28:01.120 --> 02:28:04.500
Shane is in chat saying, we could have done more clam pearl research if we were Instinct

02:28:04.500 --> 02:28:06.040
or Valor this weekend.

02:28:06.040 --> 02:28:09.320
All the gyms were blue and people were defending for some reason.

02:28:09.320 --> 02:28:12.000
And we ran into a lot of battle in a gym quest.

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.760
Well, the good news, I mean, I was in a different part of town.

02:28:14.760 --> 02:28:16.120
I went to a place I don't usually go to.

02:28:16.120 --> 02:28:19.960
I went to old downtown Roseville, which I know has a lot of stops.

02:28:19.960 --> 02:28:22.560
And the reason why I went there, I knew they had a lot of portals in Ingress, so I knew

02:28:22.560 --> 02:28:26.440
they have a lot of stops and it's not far from where my dad lives.

02:28:26.440 --> 02:28:29.280
And I had family engagements that same day that was limiting my time.

02:28:29.280 --> 02:28:34.840
So we went down there and luckily there was a pretty even amount because what happened,

02:28:34.840 --> 02:28:38.600
the worst thing that happened to me is that I was fighting a red gym to do one of my like

02:28:38.600 --> 02:28:39.900
battle in a gym things.

02:28:39.900 --> 02:28:43.520
And right as I took it out, I was like, oh, I'll deploy in this gym since I just took

02:28:43.520 --> 02:28:44.560
it anyway.

02:28:44.560 --> 02:28:48.600
And as I tried to deploy a yellow player beat me to it who had been fighting the red player

02:28:48.600 --> 02:28:50.560
at the exact same time.

02:28:50.560 --> 02:28:52.920
And I was like, eh, whatever, no big deal.

02:28:52.920 --> 02:28:58.440
So but yeah, if everybody had been blue up and down the street, then it would have been

02:28:58.440 --> 02:28:59.840
more difficult to finish things.

02:28:59.840 --> 02:29:00.840
Yeah.

02:29:00.840 --> 02:29:04.000
But here's where, you know, you could consider changing your teams so that that won't happen

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:05.060
in the future.

02:29:05.060 --> 02:29:08.880
So anyway, and yeah.

02:29:08.880 --> 02:29:10.520
You know, do your teams really matter?

02:29:10.520 --> 02:29:14.840
Because as she, when her mat and chat says, I'm on team red and my girlfriend's on blue,

02:29:14.840 --> 02:29:18.680
we haven't broken up yet in all seriousness, it works out great being on opposite teams.

02:29:18.680 --> 02:29:22.760
You know, a lot of people that run with multiple accounts don't pick the same team on their

02:29:22.760 --> 02:29:24.200
multiple accounts.

02:29:24.200 --> 02:29:27.720
Not that I'm endorsing that, but the reality is we know a lot of people are doing that

02:29:27.720 --> 02:29:31.680
and they will pick the other color to knock their own Pokemon out of gyms, which is what

02:29:31.680 --> 02:29:32.980
Niantic doesn't want you to do.

02:29:32.980 --> 02:29:33.980
But I don't know.

02:29:33.980 --> 02:29:37.600
Do you think Niantic will ever take steps against multi-accounters and Pokemon go?

02:29:37.600 --> 02:29:38.600
I don't think it's going down.

02:29:38.680 --> 02:29:39.680
No.

02:29:39.680 --> 02:29:42.680
Probably as long as people are spending money, they probably don't give a hoot.

02:29:42.680 --> 02:29:44.680
I don't think they will.

02:29:44.680 --> 02:29:45.680
Yeah.

02:29:45.680 --> 02:29:46.680
All right.

02:29:46.680 --> 02:29:48.520
Anyhow, we've got a few more stories for you guys before we get to Discord.

02:29:48.520 --> 02:29:53.840
But if you want to call in, you might want to make your way over to our Discord at vognetwork.com

02:29:53.840 --> 02:29:58.040
slash Discord and set up in the green room and tell us a little bit about what you want

02:29:58.040 --> 02:30:00.560
to talk about tonight in the Orange Launch Radio channel.

02:30:00.560 --> 02:30:02.560
And we will get to those calls in just a little bit.

02:30:02.560 --> 02:30:04.520
But first, we have this story.

02:30:04.640 --> 02:30:09.480
Yes, how nice of Bethesda to lay out a roadmap of how they're going to fix Fallout 76.

02:30:09.480 --> 02:30:14.200
Because, you know, this is all going to be a huge shit show anyways once we finally get

02:30:14.200 --> 02:30:15.200
there.

02:30:15.200 --> 02:30:17.600
But it's nice to at least see it laid out.

02:30:17.600 --> 02:30:22.080
So what they're going to do for 2019, they've got three different segments.

02:30:22.080 --> 02:30:25.640
So Wild Appalachia, Nuclear Winter, and Wastelanders.

02:30:25.640 --> 02:30:30.760
So Wild Appalachia, they're going to have all new quests, game modes, features, and

02:30:30.760 --> 02:30:37.320
more, including they've added Survival, there's going to be the new game mode, Nuclear Winter

02:30:37.320 --> 02:30:45.120
with Nuclear Winter, the Vault 94, which is a high level Vault Raids, and additional new

02:30:45.120 --> 02:30:46.120
features.

02:30:46.120 --> 02:30:52.400
Wastelanders is going to add a new main quest, new events, and additional new features.

02:30:52.400 --> 02:30:57.000
But I can't help but think they're going to fuck this up somehow because at the same time,

02:30:57.000 --> 02:31:01.360
like just this week, they banned a player.

02:31:01.360 --> 02:31:03.760
Is it just me or is this too fucking late?

02:31:03.760 --> 02:31:04.800
It's too fucking late.

02:31:04.800 --> 02:31:10.040
Like that's, I mean, that's great that they have a plan to fix it and so forth, but isn't

02:31:10.040 --> 02:31:12.400
it too fucking late?

02:31:12.400 --> 02:31:20.880
Or has No Man's Sky and the relative success of its own turnaround shown game companies

02:31:20.880 --> 02:31:23.760
that maybe it's never too fucking late?

02:31:23.760 --> 02:31:26.720
No, I think it's too late.

02:31:26.760 --> 02:31:31.480
I think it's too late because I think people are just fed up with how the game plays.

02:31:31.480 --> 02:31:34.920
But just also it's the constant stream of fuck-ups that they're doing.

02:31:34.920 --> 02:31:39.980
You know, No Man's Sky was just kind of bad from the beginning, but like they were doing

02:31:39.980 --> 02:31:41.480
updates as it went along.

02:31:41.480 --> 02:31:45.520
It just wasn't like they were fucking up every single time that they tried to do something.

02:31:45.520 --> 02:31:51.000
So like, for example, this week they had banned a player who had, they said he had too much

02:31:51.000 --> 02:31:58.120
ammunition on him because he had played over like 300 some hours and he has a couple characters

02:31:58.120 --> 02:32:01.740
that he swaps weapons back and forth to try to figure out which weapons he wants to run

02:32:01.740 --> 02:32:03.680
with or main with.

02:32:03.680 --> 02:32:10.200
And I think that he came to the conclusion that they seem to track the ammo that you

02:32:10.200 --> 02:32:13.940
pick up, but not necessarily the ammo that you drop or trade.

02:32:13.940 --> 02:32:18.820
And so because their system calculated it incorrectly, it made it seem like he had like

02:32:18.820 --> 02:32:21.420
an excessive amount of ammo on him.

02:32:21.420 --> 02:32:25.540
And so, of course, you know, a player that is dedicated to the game that's played over,

02:32:25.540 --> 02:32:30.860
you know, several hundred hours into the game, let's ban him because that's that's appropriate

02:32:30.860 --> 02:32:34.600
for one of the people who actually enjoys your game.

02:32:34.600 --> 02:32:36.500
So there's that.

02:32:36.500 --> 02:32:43.300
And then speaking of another game that's not getting such great success, but also is got

02:32:43.300 --> 02:32:48.260
their roadmap in there, Anthem, for example, is talking about what they're going to be

02:32:48.260 --> 02:32:49.860
doing going forward.

02:32:49.860 --> 02:32:55.380
So they've got kind of a roadmap of reoccurring updates, fixes, improvements and optimizations.

02:32:55.380 --> 02:32:58.240
Weekly Alliance, the case of Anthem, like it just came out.

02:32:58.240 --> 02:33:02.380
So it doesn't feel like it's too late, whereas like Fallout kind of already passed the holiday

02:33:02.380 --> 02:33:03.380
period.

02:33:03.380 --> 02:33:04.380
Right.

02:33:04.380 --> 02:33:06.580
But I can't help but look at this and go.

02:33:06.580 --> 02:33:13.540
All those issues I had with Mass Effect Andromeda, where the product was not released the way

02:33:13.540 --> 02:33:16.860
it was truly envisioned in many ways.

02:33:16.860 --> 02:33:21.140
It's like, here we go again in the same thing.

02:33:21.140 --> 02:33:22.140
And here's the thing, too.

02:33:22.140 --> 02:33:26.220
Like it for me, it feels like especially when it's like a game that, you know, you're in

02:33:26.220 --> 02:33:30.980
a they want you to spend a lot of time and stuff, maybe not so much without a monthly

02:33:30.980 --> 02:33:36.540
fee and things, but almost would want to wait until it drops in price even more.

02:33:36.540 --> 02:33:40.480
And they have all these updates done so that it's a little bit more polished.

02:33:40.480 --> 02:33:45.380
But even by then, there'll be another thing that comes out that's more popular, that people

02:33:45.380 --> 02:33:46.940
are just not going to want to waste their time on.

02:33:46.940 --> 02:33:50.060
Apex Legends, the free game, will get that same content.

02:33:50.060 --> 02:33:51.060
Yeah.

02:33:51.060 --> 02:33:57.860
Why should I spend money on a game like Fallout 76 when, for example, right now they're teasing

02:33:57.860 --> 02:34:01.300
on Amazon, there's a Fallout announcement that's going to be made.

02:34:01.300 --> 02:34:05.940
It's most likely going to be probably a remaster of 3 or New Vegas.

02:34:05.940 --> 02:34:12.180
Why the fuck am I going to put drop money in Fallout 76 when I can play a better game?

02:34:12.180 --> 02:34:13.180
And I don't know.

02:34:13.180 --> 02:34:16.980
I just I don't know why I would want to play Fallout 76.

02:34:16.980 --> 02:34:17.980
Let's see.

02:34:17.980 --> 02:34:22.780
Going to our chat, Quest Buster says the patches with Fallout 76 have been an unending clown

02:34:22.780 --> 02:34:24.220
car of missteps.

02:34:24.220 --> 02:34:25.220
It's insane.

02:34:25.220 --> 02:34:27.500
Sounds like we need the yackety stacks here.

02:34:27.500 --> 02:34:32.460
The last patch wanted 38 gigs of space, but was only four or five in actual size.

02:34:32.460 --> 02:34:37.300
As John says, if there was a game that ever needed a total reboot like Realm Reborn, it

02:34:37.300 --> 02:34:38.300
was Fallout 76.

02:34:38.300 --> 02:34:41.780
Well, but at the same time, something on Final Fantasy also kind of lives.

02:34:41.780 --> 02:34:46.260
Well, Final Fantasy 14 specifically makes its bread and butter off those monthly fees.

02:34:46.260 --> 02:34:47.260
Right.

02:34:47.260 --> 02:34:48.900
You know, and a reason to keep paying every month.

02:34:48.900 --> 02:34:53.540
I mean, thank God Bethesda didn't try to charge a monthly fee for this game.

02:34:53.540 --> 02:34:56.260
Yeah, it's good for that.

02:34:56.260 --> 02:34:57.260
Yeah.

02:34:57.260 --> 02:34:58.260
So, I mean, we'll see.

02:34:58.260 --> 02:35:01.660
Anthem, on the other hand, is kind of a different case because it is still kind of newer.

02:35:01.660 --> 02:35:05.660
And although it does seem like it's not going to hit that.

02:35:05.660 --> 02:35:06.660
I mean, I don't know.

02:35:06.660 --> 02:35:07.660
We haven't seen the sales figure.

02:35:08.020 --> 02:35:09.020
I just don't know.

02:35:09.020 --> 02:35:11.420
I just know EA set some big expectations for it.

02:35:11.420 --> 02:35:12.420
When they first showed it off.

02:35:12.420 --> 02:35:15.300
I feel like some people are into it, but not six million.

02:35:15.300 --> 02:35:19.420
Just like when they first showed off, it looked cool and then just like my interest just went

02:35:19.420 --> 02:35:20.420
downhill from there.

02:35:20.420 --> 02:35:25.860
It just was kind of like, eh, because it's EA and it's like EA just fucks everything

02:35:25.860 --> 02:35:29.980
up with the way their monetization and just everything in this.

02:35:29.980 --> 02:35:34.460
It seems like this is almost like a cookie cutter type game that they just shoving in

02:35:34.460 --> 02:35:38.740
monetization in and just tons of grind in the game.

02:35:38.740 --> 02:35:43.300
I just, for me, I just knew this was going to happen again.

02:35:43.300 --> 02:35:44.700
Like I knew this was going to happen again.

02:35:44.700 --> 02:35:49.860
And I said this way back when we were first talking about why I was irritated with the

02:35:49.860 --> 02:35:53.180
quarry and arc stuff getting canceled to Mass Effect and all this other stuff and turning

02:35:53.180 --> 02:35:56.140
to this hot new thing that's going to save it as I'm like, it's not going to save anything

02:35:56.140 --> 02:36:00.340
if EA repeats the same mistakes, you know, in this whole thing.

02:36:00.340 --> 02:36:05.820
You know, and I'm I there's a part of me that feels like maybe I owe it to my bio or fandom

02:36:05.820 --> 02:36:06.820
or something to try it.

02:36:06.820 --> 02:36:08.180
But at the same time, no, you don't.

02:36:08.180 --> 02:36:09.180
Exactly.

02:36:09.180 --> 02:36:10.180
Exactly.

02:36:10.180 --> 02:36:11.180
No, I don't.

02:36:11.180 --> 02:36:15.340
Because the other games out there, because it is that argument that we owe it to a company,

02:36:15.340 --> 02:36:18.500
the purchase or stuff, whether it's good or not, will they owe it to us to make a good

02:36:18.500 --> 02:36:19.500
game then?

02:36:19.500 --> 02:36:22.060
Like, you know, you come up.

02:36:22.060 --> 02:36:23.060
It's a business.

02:36:23.060 --> 02:36:27.060
I would want to use the word complete complete game.

02:36:27.060 --> 02:36:30.140
Yes, I think a lot of games, a big difference.

02:36:30.140 --> 02:36:35.300
And I think a lot of games that come out nowadays are not complete products that they just kind

02:36:35.300 --> 02:36:41.140
of do this early access crap where it's not even labeled as early access is just, oh,

02:36:41.140 --> 02:36:42.140
it's incomplete.

02:36:42.140 --> 02:36:45.860
Like even like Battlefield Five had that problem where it came out and there's modes on the

02:36:45.860 --> 02:36:48.400
menu that aren't even accessible yet.

02:36:48.400 --> 02:36:52.180
But isn't it interesting we have that story on Dreams just a little bit ago earlier in

02:36:52.180 --> 02:36:58.780
the show that that now is setting the stage, setting the expectations at that level of

02:36:58.780 --> 02:37:03.020
we're going to charge you thirty dollars for the half done game and tell you up front

02:37:03.020 --> 02:37:05.220
this is the half done game.

02:37:05.220 --> 02:37:06.220
And right.

02:37:06.220 --> 02:37:11.180
And you know, how would how would you felt about Fallout 76 if they had taken that approach?

02:37:11.180 --> 02:37:14.340
Because I'll tell you how I would have felt about Anthem a lot different.

02:37:14.340 --> 02:37:17.840
I would have felt a little bit better about it because they would if at least I would

02:37:17.840 --> 02:37:20.880
my expectations would be lower.

02:37:20.880 --> 02:37:27.820
Also the price point being much lower be something, you know, to look forward to as well.

02:37:27.860 --> 02:37:32.860
The media molecule, though, I have more faith in as far as the games that they produce and

02:37:32.860 --> 02:37:34.340
the quality of their products.

02:37:34.340 --> 02:37:38.440
So I know what I'm getting into with that.

02:37:38.440 --> 02:37:39.440
So I don't know.

02:37:39.440 --> 02:37:44.620
I'm just not really and just what I've seen so far Dreams.

02:37:44.620 --> 02:37:50.640
It's more an interesting concept versus Fallout 76, which is just basically follow for remove

02:37:50.640 --> 02:37:53.460
all the NPCs and try to shoehorn it into an MMO.

02:37:53.460 --> 02:37:55.060
And that just doesn't fucking work.

02:37:55.060 --> 02:37:56.060
All right.

02:37:56.300 --> 02:37:57.860
Well, let's move on because I want to make sure we have time.

02:37:57.860 --> 02:38:00.700
It's almost nine o'clock and I want to make sure we have time to hear from our listeners

02:38:00.700 --> 02:38:01.700
a little bit.

02:38:01.700 --> 02:38:05.500
So let me quickly address this story, which is about the PlayStation Vita.

02:38:05.500 --> 02:38:06.620
And you already knew this.

02:38:06.620 --> 02:38:09.860
The days are winding down for the PlayStation Vita.

02:38:09.860 --> 02:38:16.700
We're almost at the end because the official website for Sony Japan does say that only

02:38:16.700 --> 02:38:20.820
two remaining models, black and aqua blue, that's all that's left.

02:38:20.820 --> 02:38:24.340
And they will no longer be shipped in the coming days.

02:38:24.340 --> 02:38:29.860
So if you want a Vita for collector's purposes or that type of thing, you might want to grab

02:38:29.860 --> 02:38:37.060
one because pretty soon the Vita is going to be officially no more because Sony is ending

02:38:37.060 --> 02:38:38.340
production on them.

02:38:38.340 --> 02:38:44.260
So pour one out for the Vita and I'm sure maybe we'll do another retrospective on that

02:38:44.260 --> 02:38:45.260
a little later.

02:38:45.260 --> 02:38:46.260
I don't know.

02:38:46.260 --> 02:38:50.980
Bobby Blackwell pointing out the cause her I CEO Twitter account was gold this week over

02:38:50.980 --> 02:38:51.980
this.

02:38:51.980 --> 02:38:52.980
I missed that account.

02:38:52.980 --> 02:38:56.980
We came back just for this landmark event because, you know, that parody account kind

02:38:56.980 --> 02:38:57.980
of retired.

02:38:57.980 --> 02:38:58.980
Yeah.

02:38:58.980 --> 02:39:02.980
But I think it comes back for these big, you know, announcements and so forth.

02:39:02.980 --> 02:39:05.860
Anyway, we invite you to participate with our show.

02:39:05.860 --> 02:39:08.620
We use discord to do it.

02:39:08.620 --> 02:39:12.620
Something we're going to be kind of actually like like kind of like an idea or whatever

02:39:12.620 --> 02:39:17.220
that I want to change in the coming weeks, I guess maybe like a thing for the show.

02:39:17.220 --> 02:39:19.780
I know with this point, we usually take phone calls.

02:39:19.780 --> 02:39:20.780
We're going to continue to do that.

02:39:20.780 --> 02:39:21.940
It's not changing.

02:39:21.940 --> 02:39:26.700
But I have noticed that, like, we get a lot of the how do I word this is I don't make

02:39:26.700 --> 02:39:30.060
it sound like I'm upset by this or anything, but we get a lot of the same people to call

02:39:30.060 --> 02:39:31.060
in every year.

02:39:31.060 --> 02:39:32.060
A lot of new callers.

02:39:32.060 --> 02:39:33.060
What's that?

02:39:33.060 --> 02:39:34.060
We don't get a lot.

02:39:34.060 --> 02:39:35.060
We don't get a lot of new callers.

02:39:35.060 --> 02:39:36.060
And that's not bad.

02:39:36.060 --> 02:39:37.060
Like, don't be wrong.

02:39:37.060 --> 02:39:38.060
I love the people that we talk to every week.

02:39:38.060 --> 02:39:40.140
We wouldn't do this segment anymore if I got sick of it.

02:39:40.140 --> 02:39:44.380
But I'm thinking, like, why aren't we getting more new people in here?

02:39:44.380 --> 02:39:47.900
And then I kind of I was kind of thinking I verbalized some of this on Twitter earlier

02:39:47.900 --> 02:39:51.300
and then I kind of got to thinking about, you know, there's a lot of people in this

02:39:51.300 --> 02:39:55.900
day and age that, like, don't like to do customer service and talk on the phone.

02:39:55.900 --> 02:39:59.300
There's a lot of people that, like, they don't want to be called on the phone and talk that

02:39:59.300 --> 02:40:00.300
way.

02:40:00.300 --> 02:40:01.300
They want to text.

02:40:01.300 --> 02:40:04.260
They want to text message or they want to do live Internet chat support or so forth.

02:40:04.260 --> 02:40:10.780
And maybe the reality is, like, for, you know, a show like this, a call in radio show is

02:40:10.780 --> 02:40:14.460
I don't necessarily say a dying format, but maybe a more and more niche format than I

02:40:14.460 --> 02:40:15.780
want to admit.

02:40:15.780 --> 02:40:20.260
So I think what you can see in the coming weeks is I want to invite, like, more varying

02:40:20.260 --> 02:40:24.500
types of participation in the segment so that we do get more diverse people.

02:40:24.500 --> 02:40:25.660
Because I completely get it.

02:40:25.660 --> 02:40:31.500
Like, just like I don't owe Bioware my purchase of Anthem, you don't owe this show a phone

02:40:31.500 --> 02:40:33.220
call just because you listen.

02:40:33.220 --> 02:40:37.060
Y'all know you're always welcome as long as you're going to be a decent, nice person.

02:40:37.060 --> 02:40:40.260
Don't call this show just to be a dick, but I don't think anybody out there is going to

02:40:40.260 --> 02:40:41.260
do that.

02:40:41.260 --> 02:40:42.860
But I think we should also invite other ways.

02:40:42.860 --> 02:40:47.700
So we'll be inviting questions from chat and discussion topics from chat.

02:40:47.700 --> 02:40:50.020
So if you guys have any questions, fill in the time.

02:40:50.020 --> 02:40:51.140
Great thing to do that.

02:40:51.140 --> 02:40:53.440
And I'm going to bring back tweets.

02:40:53.440 --> 02:40:58.340
So the tweets that come in to us every week at Twitter dot com slash O.L.R., we will use

02:40:58.340 --> 02:40:59.940
in this segment.

02:40:59.940 --> 02:41:02.820
So that way I'm not always looking at Loki going, well, the phone's dead.

02:41:02.820 --> 02:41:03.820
Any last minute stories?

02:41:03.820 --> 02:41:05.020
We got anything?

02:41:05.020 --> 02:41:10.180
So we're going to, you know, in the spirit of that, we always have talked about this

02:41:10.180 --> 02:41:11.180
before.

02:41:11.180 --> 02:41:16.500
This show is kind of born of that roundtable discussion at a diner after we were at, you

02:41:16.500 --> 02:41:20.900
know, the arcade playing DDR and then we go back to the diner and talk some shit about

02:41:20.900 --> 02:41:21.900
games.

02:41:21.900 --> 02:41:26.060
I kind of want to just invite everybody to the table in whatever way they feel comfortable

02:41:26.060 --> 02:41:27.060
doing so.

02:41:27.060 --> 02:41:29.860
So if that's through phone calls, cool.

02:41:29.860 --> 02:41:33.060
But if that's through just like one off, like this isn't worth a phone call, but I want

02:41:33.060 --> 02:41:35.380
to know your opinion on that, then cool.

02:41:35.380 --> 02:41:39.140
We can do that, too, as long as it's like somewhat gaming related or at least geek related,

02:41:39.140 --> 02:41:43.220
at least geek related, because obviously tonight we I would expect to ask your questions, right?

02:41:43.220 --> 02:41:44.660
That's fine.

02:41:44.660 --> 02:41:45.940
And then, of course, tweets as well.

02:41:45.940 --> 02:41:48.220
So come on back to Twitter at OLR.

02:41:48.220 --> 02:41:50.860
We will read your tweets throughout the week.

02:41:50.860 --> 02:41:57.140
So anyway, let's see.

02:41:57.140 --> 02:42:02.500
I think they're talking in chat about the whole Skype versus Discord thing as well.

02:42:02.500 --> 02:42:05.700
This is something that would have come up even if we hadn't changed platforms.

02:42:05.700 --> 02:42:11.140
But the reality is Skype technologically was preventing me from doing what we're doing

02:42:11.140 --> 02:42:12.140
here on Twitch.

02:42:12.140 --> 02:42:13.140
So I changed.

02:42:13.140 --> 02:42:14.140
Done.

02:42:14.140 --> 02:42:15.140
All right.

02:42:15.340 --> 02:42:16.340
Let's move on.

02:42:16.340 --> 02:42:19.900
We have a couple of folks in the green room waiting to talk to us.

02:42:19.900 --> 02:42:20.900
So let's get to it.

02:42:20.900 --> 02:42:21.900
Let's get to some of these calls tonight.

02:42:21.900 --> 02:42:22.900
Hi.

02:42:22.900 --> 02:42:23.900
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:42:23.900 --> 02:42:24.900
Who's this?

02:42:24.900 --> 02:42:25.900
Hey, this is Akdeft.

02:42:25.900 --> 02:42:26.900
Hey, Akdeft.

02:42:26.900 --> 02:42:27.900
What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

02:42:27.900 --> 02:42:31.460
Well, I want to talk about Pokemon Go.

02:42:31.460 --> 02:42:34.140
Everybody's favorite casual, filthy game.

02:42:34.140 --> 02:42:36.840
What's on your mind about Pokemon Go?

02:42:36.840 --> 02:42:37.840
Everyone's favorite dead game.

02:42:37.840 --> 02:42:38.840
Yes.

02:42:38.840 --> 02:42:44.540
Everyone's favorite dead game that's that's still somehow on the top grossing iTunes charts.

02:42:44.940 --> 02:42:51.580
But anyways, I'm pretty sure you already talked about the Clamperl event, but I want to talk

02:42:51.580 --> 02:42:55.280
about my personal opinions on it.

02:42:55.280 --> 02:43:02.460
And if you remember, I called about the Phoebus event and how a disaster that was.

02:43:02.460 --> 02:43:08.260
Yeah, it was pretty shitty, but I thought this Clamperl one, they improved so much.

02:43:08.260 --> 02:43:09.260
What did you think?

02:43:09.260 --> 02:43:13.740
Yeah, it was way, like way better.

02:43:13.940 --> 02:43:19.220
It was gigantic, learned from all the mistakes they made on the Phoebus event, and they made

02:43:19.220 --> 02:43:24.780
this event way, way more accessible for everyone to do.

02:43:24.780 --> 02:43:29.380
It's almost like once in a while they actually listen to feedback, and it's pretty astounding

02:43:29.380 --> 02:43:31.420
when gaming companies do that.

02:43:31.420 --> 02:43:39.860
Yeah, it was surprising for me because even the shiny rate for this, it was like really

02:43:39.860 --> 02:43:40.860
insane.

02:43:41.060 --> 02:43:47.300
Myself, I got like six shiny Clamperl on the first hour.

02:43:47.300 --> 02:43:51.460
Lucky you, because we went for like about an hour and a half, two hours.

02:43:51.460 --> 02:43:54.860
I got two shiny Clamperls and so did Alan.

02:43:54.860 --> 02:44:03.500
Yeah, and at the end I got like 10 other people that probably played like, again like you,

02:44:03.500 --> 02:44:09.300
an hour and a half or maybe less, got at least one or even up to three.

02:44:09.300 --> 02:44:17.020
So it was a good event, and again, all the special research they made for this were like

02:44:17.020 --> 02:44:21.860
not that difficult because if you remember with the Phoebus event, they were like, oh,

02:44:21.860 --> 02:44:27.800
make 10 nice throws or 15 great throws or do something like really, really insane that

02:44:27.800 --> 02:44:30.180
takes a lot of time.

02:44:30.180 --> 02:44:36.860
And with this event, oh, you have to capture one Psyduck or one Krabby or you have to do

02:44:36.860 --> 02:44:39.460
like only one or two or up.

02:44:39.460 --> 02:44:46.060
I think the most great throws or nice throws was like three or five, I can remember.

02:44:46.060 --> 02:44:47.740
I'll tell you exactly what it was.

02:44:47.740 --> 02:44:55.220
It was three nice curve balls in a row because that was the one I kept fucking up and I got

02:44:55.220 --> 02:44:57.260
really frustrated.

02:44:57.260 --> 02:45:00.860
So yeah, it was three nights, but I mean, it's reasonable.

02:45:00.860 --> 02:45:06.100
It was frustrating, but like trying to get past a difficult level in a platformer and

02:45:06.100 --> 02:45:11.080
eventually you do it frustrating, not like I'm going to throw my phone into the ocean

02:45:11.080 --> 02:45:12.080
frustrating.

02:45:12.080 --> 02:45:13.080
Yeah.

02:45:13.080 --> 02:45:14.080
Yeah.

02:45:14.080 --> 02:45:19.680
Some were like kind of not difficult, but time consuming because yeah, they were the

02:45:19.680 --> 02:45:23.500
ones like battling a gym or do a raid even.

02:45:23.500 --> 02:45:29.500
But even those, they were not like really, really hard to do because you just like have

02:45:29.500 --> 02:45:36.020
to find either a group or a simple like double one or two raid and maybe even a level three

02:45:36.020 --> 02:45:38.820
one if you can do those.

02:45:38.820 --> 02:45:45.020
But still that the event was like really great and I'm amazed they learn from their mistakes

02:45:45.020 --> 02:45:50.540
because we both know Niantic and how they can screw up things like really bad.

02:45:50.540 --> 02:45:53.340
They still do.

02:45:53.340 --> 02:45:57.660
But when something good like this happens, when they have to be commended for something

02:45:57.660 --> 02:46:04.580
like this, yeah, I really have to thank Niantic for this type of events and hopefully they

02:46:04.580 --> 02:46:10.500
will probably add more or do more stuff like, like even with the next community day that

02:46:10.500 --> 02:46:16.680
it's going to be like a global same time event, not necessarily everyone at the same time,

02:46:16.680 --> 02:46:22.360
but the same time for everyone instead like different time hours or zones.

02:46:22.360 --> 02:46:25.820
So that's also going to be like really, really great too.

02:46:25.820 --> 02:46:32.500
I think the best event they did in Pokemon Go so far was the December community day because

02:46:32.500 --> 02:46:36.980
it was the Encore one and the key thing about it that made it great is that it went all

02:46:36.980 --> 02:46:43.880
weekend long, but there were still some heightened perks for a three hour window to draw people

02:46:43.880 --> 02:46:46.900
out to play in that specific three hour window.

02:46:46.900 --> 02:46:51.460
But if you miss that window, oh, well, you missed some XP boosts, some walking credits,

02:46:51.460 --> 02:46:55.740
some lures, those types of things, but you'd still catch all the shinies and all the Pokemons

02:46:55.740 --> 02:46:58.180
and the things that were like the must haves.

02:46:58.180 --> 02:47:01.420
So I think that's the one thing is that it seems like these arbitrary times that they

02:47:01.420 --> 02:47:04.120
pick, like they don't always work for everybody.

02:47:04.120 --> 02:47:08.260
So Niantic really needs to think about, like, I understand they wanted, if they were to

02:47:08.260 --> 02:47:13.260
do a community day all weekend long, they couldn't get those photo ops of people all

02:47:13.260 --> 02:47:15.100
in one place at the same time.

02:47:15.100 --> 02:47:16.820
That's what they're kind of trying to do.

02:47:16.820 --> 02:47:22.540
But I think they really need to think about like, could we do like Saturday or Sunday,

02:47:22.540 --> 02:47:25.060
pick one and that's the one you're stuck doing.

02:47:25.060 --> 02:47:27.740
You can't do both like that type of thing.

02:47:27.940 --> 02:47:34.380
And that technology exists within Niantic and within Pokemon Go because Pokemon Go Fest,

02:47:34.380 --> 02:47:38.740
you had to buy a ticket to that, you had to buy Saturday or Sunday, and only once your

02:47:38.740 --> 02:47:43.100
ticket was like redeemed in the system, could you see those Pokemon spawns in the park.

02:47:43.100 --> 02:47:47.320
If you tried to go to the park on a day that your ticket wasn't for, you didn't see them.

02:47:47.320 --> 02:47:53.180
So I think that would be my idea is that maybe Niantic should offer choices.

02:47:53.180 --> 02:47:58.460
Like here's three community event times, pick one, but once you do it, you're stuck

02:47:58.460 --> 02:48:02.260
with that time and that's the only three.

02:48:02.260 --> 02:48:06.700
So that way the people that are like, I'm going to go out and catch 47 shinies during

02:48:06.700 --> 02:48:10.060
the weekend, because I feel like that's what Shane would actually do if the times were

02:48:10.060 --> 02:48:11.420
available.

02:48:11.420 --> 02:48:16.860
It kind of lessens those power players from being able to play way more than like, you

02:48:16.860 --> 02:48:21.460
know, the three hour period, which is a reasonable amount of time to binge Pokemon Go.

02:48:21.460 --> 02:48:25.380
I think you should pick one and stick with it and encourage people to sync up and pick

02:48:25.380 --> 02:48:27.260
the window that works for them.

02:48:27.260 --> 02:48:31.020
Yeah, that would actually be like really, really great.

02:48:31.020 --> 02:48:34.940
I think they do this for the Safari zones too.

02:48:34.940 --> 02:48:39.660
So yeah, it's not like impossible for them to do it.

02:48:39.660 --> 02:48:44.620
So yeah, it would actually like be nice to have like that choice.

02:48:44.620 --> 02:48:50.820
Like if you, you can only do Sunday at a certain time or you can only do Saturday at a certain

02:48:50.820 --> 02:48:56.980
time, that would be like a really, really great like option and you can probably like

02:48:56.980 --> 02:49:06.620
plan with your team or with friends to, oh, we're going to do Saturday at 3 p.m. or we're

02:49:06.620 --> 02:49:10.620
going to do Sunday at 10, I don't know.

02:49:10.620 --> 02:49:15.940
And you can organize that way too and have like really, really great experience because

02:49:15.940 --> 02:49:21.460
even with the system like it is now, you really have a good time.

02:49:21.460 --> 02:49:27.660
I really enjoy this community events like they are right now, but having that option

02:49:27.660 --> 02:49:31.060
would be like really better for everyone at all.

02:49:31.060 --> 02:49:32.060
Yeah.

02:49:32.060 --> 02:49:35.900
So yeah, I think these are some good ideas, but at least Niantic is kind of like, they're

02:49:35.900 --> 02:49:38.240
not like hell bent on sticking with their old way.

02:49:38.240 --> 02:49:39.980
They are trying some new things.

02:49:39.980 --> 02:49:43.620
So I'll give them some credit for that, especially when it came to the Go Festival.

02:49:43.620 --> 02:49:47.500
Like my understanding is last year, everybody I talked to who went this last year in 2018

02:49:47.500 --> 02:49:48.660
had a great time.

02:49:48.660 --> 02:49:56.220
People who in 2017, not so much, but it sounds like they really like implemented that feedback

02:49:56.220 --> 02:49:58.420
and made it a stronger, better event.

02:49:58.420 --> 02:50:01.380
I just kind of wish they did more of those type of events.

02:50:01.380 --> 02:50:07.720
Like surely there's got to be a way for Niantic to like, no, these are the top 500 cities

02:50:07.720 --> 02:50:13.460
in the world and have a small team of people for a couple of days, go to these 500 cities

02:50:13.460 --> 02:50:17.780
and look like where's the, where would be a good place to like, where's a big park that's

02:50:17.780 --> 02:50:21.500
dense with stops that we could have like an event like to really kind of draw people to

02:50:21.500 --> 02:50:22.500
the same place.

02:50:22.500 --> 02:50:26.060
Or could they have it like, you know, even incorporate something like how they do those

02:50:26.060 --> 02:50:31.300
um, EX raids or whatever, where you get an invite to go to a specific park and you go

02:50:31.300 --> 02:50:36.060
check in at the, you know, the, that would be some cool features to explore.

02:50:36.060 --> 02:50:40.260
But anyway, I don't want to turn this into a Pokemon Go podcast, but I think, cause there's

02:50:40.260 --> 02:50:43.440
lots of great ones already out there, but, um, I think these are great ideas and great

02:50:43.440 --> 02:50:46.760
examples and a lot of us are still trucking along on Pokemon Go.

02:50:46.760 --> 02:50:48.580
So all right.

02:50:48.580 --> 02:50:54.080
And I suggest everyone just like a final word, uh, to check it out, uh, even if you don't

02:50:54.080 --> 02:51:00.000
like play like religiously, the game has like improved a lot in the last year.

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:05.440
So again, I really, really suggest everyone that has played Pokemon Go and dropped it

02:51:05.440 --> 02:51:06.880
or even hasn't tried it yet.

02:51:06.880 --> 02:51:08.480
It's a, it's a good social game.

02:51:08.480 --> 02:51:11.000
Like, uh, like I really, really recommend it.

02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:12.000
All right.

02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:13.260
That's a strong recommendation.

02:51:13.300 --> 02:51:15.820
I'm going to let you go to try and squeeze in one more call here.

02:51:15.820 --> 02:51:17.140
So thanks so much for the call though.

02:51:17.140 --> 02:51:18.620
Hey, thanks for having me.

02:51:18.620 --> 02:51:19.620
All right.

02:51:19.620 --> 02:51:20.620
Anytime.

02:51:20.620 --> 02:51:21.620
Take care.

02:51:21.620 --> 02:51:22.620
All right.

02:51:22.620 --> 02:51:23.620
Let's see if we can get to one more call here.

02:51:23.620 --> 02:51:24.620
Hi.

02:51:24.620 --> 02:51:25.620
You're on Orange Lawns Radio.

02:51:25.620 --> 02:51:26.620
Who's this?

02:51:26.620 --> 02:51:27.620
Hello.

02:51:27.620 --> 02:51:28.620
You're on Orange Lawns Radio.

02:51:28.620 --> 02:51:29.620
Who is it?

02:51:29.620 --> 02:51:30.620
Oh, sorry.

02:51:30.620 --> 02:51:33.780
I hit, I hit you on mute accidentally.

02:51:33.780 --> 02:51:34.780
That's okay.

02:51:34.780 --> 02:51:35.780
I know you've been waiting a little bit.

02:51:35.780 --> 02:51:36.780
Who is it?

02:51:36.780 --> 02:51:38.300
It's on Metal Mayhem.

02:51:38.300 --> 02:51:39.300
Cool.

02:51:39.300 --> 02:51:42.060
Just always, I always have to have you introduce yourself cause you never know who's listening

02:51:42.060 --> 02:51:43.060
for the first time.

02:51:43.060 --> 02:51:44.060
Uh, what's on your mind tonight?

02:51:44.060 --> 02:51:46.260
I want to take your, uh, first topic here.

02:51:46.260 --> 02:51:50.540
You mentioned in the chat because I'm a little pressed for time, but I'm curious of this

02:51:50.540 --> 02:51:52.660
question behind your first topic here.

02:51:52.660 --> 02:52:05.380
All right, well, has there been any game or games that you know is a total nuclear turd

02:52:05.380 --> 02:52:09.420
for some strange reason you love it anyway?

02:52:09.420 --> 02:52:10.940
I love this question.

02:52:10.940 --> 02:52:11.940
Yes.

02:52:12.060 --> 02:52:19.700
It's a game called Dance Dance Revolution and it's so good that we created a whole show

02:52:19.700 --> 02:52:25.260
that's persisted for 16 years about it because let's be real, I don't think the game reviews

02:52:25.260 --> 02:52:28.260
for Dance Dance Revolution were ever really that good.

02:52:28.260 --> 02:52:30.440
Uh, but here we are.

02:52:30.440 --> 02:52:32.500
So that's my number one answer.

02:52:32.500 --> 02:52:36.900
But if we want to take a step back from that obvious answer, how about you, Loki, a guilty

02:52:36.900 --> 02:52:37.900
pleasure.

02:52:37.900 --> 02:52:38.900
I already know your answer.

02:52:38.900 --> 02:52:39.900
God.

02:52:39.900 --> 02:52:40.900
I already know it's Earth Defense Force.

02:52:40.900 --> 02:52:45.220
Earth Defense Force is a guilty pleasure game where it's, you know, why or Twisted Metal.

02:52:45.220 --> 02:52:48.820
Well, I guess people actually, I guess if we want to pick another obscure one, that's

02:52:48.820 --> 02:52:50.700
a guilty pleasure game.

02:52:50.700 --> 02:52:53.980
It would be Gals Panic, the arcade game.

02:52:53.980 --> 02:52:54.980
Oh yeah.

02:52:54.980 --> 02:52:55.980
Oh yeah.

02:52:55.980 --> 02:52:57.820
You do like the, you sit down and play that.

02:52:57.820 --> 02:52:58.820
Yes.

02:52:58.820 --> 02:53:03.420
So it's the, um, I wouldn't even really call it hentai, but it's like, it's just an anime

02:53:03.420 --> 02:53:10.060
puzzle game, but it's semi lewd anime puzzle game, I guess, but it's not really me.

02:53:10.060 --> 02:53:11.060
It's an arcade game.

02:53:11.060 --> 02:53:16.500
It wasn't like, you know, Miss Nude World or something like that, um, that one.

02:53:16.500 --> 02:53:19.060
And there was the 3D one as well.

02:53:19.060 --> 02:53:23.340
That was, I don't remember the name of it though, but there's a 3D one.

02:53:23.340 --> 02:53:26.500
It's basically the same type of thing as well.

02:53:26.500 --> 02:53:31.740
Um, and the name is just escaping me right now, but Gals Panic, yes.

02:53:31.740 --> 02:53:35.500
I'm looking at my phone to see if I have any guilty pleasure phone games.

02:53:35.500 --> 02:53:37.500
Oh, that Disney emoji blitz.

02:53:37.500 --> 02:53:41.060
I stopped playing it finally, but I was super into that for a little bit.

02:53:41.060 --> 02:53:44.700
So maybe like something like Tsum Tsum, cause it's like a match three game, but it's still

02:53:44.700 --> 02:53:46.140
really adorable and fun.

02:53:46.140 --> 02:53:48.180
And yeah, I like playing that in the arcades.

02:53:48.180 --> 02:53:49.180
I don't know.

02:53:49.180 --> 02:53:52.380
Like I'm also tempted to just be, be sassy and say Pokemon go.

02:53:52.380 --> 02:53:54.340
That's the answer here.

02:53:54.340 --> 02:53:58.100
You know, again, there's a lot of ways I think people would make that game better, but I

02:53:58.100 --> 02:53:59.100
can't stop playing it.

02:53:59.100 --> 02:54:02.060
And to some extent, Ingress would be an answer for that as well, I think.

02:54:02.060 --> 02:54:06.140
Uh, but Metal Mayhem, you know, I'm going to turn the tables on you.

02:54:06.140 --> 02:54:10.020
It's your guilty pleasure game that everybody says is crap, but you can't help but love

02:54:10.020 --> 02:54:11.020
it anyway.

02:54:11.020 --> 02:54:19.860
I'll go with the obvious one, two words, two.

02:54:19.860 --> 02:54:28.700
That game is so bad, so distasteful, the game was even made, but for some strange reason,

02:54:28.700 --> 02:54:30.260
I can't stop playing it.

02:54:30.260 --> 02:54:32.300
Wait, one game, what game did you say?

02:54:32.300 --> 02:54:36.860
I think, I think, am I crazy or did discord or maybe discord dropped out at just the wrong

02:54:36.860 --> 02:54:37.860
time.

02:54:37.860 --> 02:54:38.860
You said I have two words for you.

02:54:38.860 --> 02:54:39.860
And then all I heard was two.

02:54:39.860 --> 02:54:44.820
What, what's the game postal to, uh, to, Oh, okay.

02:54:44.820 --> 02:54:48.500
So, so the word postal didn't come through, which I thought he said, I got two words for

02:54:48.500 --> 02:54:49.500
you.

02:54:49.500 --> 02:54:53.060
It's two, the number two, what are the words?

02:54:53.060 --> 02:54:54.060
Okay.

02:54:54.060 --> 02:54:55.060
Postal two.

02:54:55.060 --> 02:54:56.060
Yes.

02:54:56.060 --> 02:54:57.060
That game is absolute garbage.

02:54:57.060 --> 02:54:58.060
And so is the movie, but I get it.

02:54:58.060 --> 02:54:59.060
I get it.

02:54:59.060 --> 02:55:01.380
People can't help it anyway.

02:55:01.380 --> 02:55:02.380
Yeah.

02:55:02.380 --> 02:55:03.380
Yeah.

02:55:03.380 --> 02:55:08.140
Like I was saying, yes, that game was in bad taste.

02:55:08.140 --> 02:55:14.180
It's a really shitty game, but I couldn't, could not put the game down.

02:55:14.180 --> 02:55:19.300
Um, was it, was it your wife or who was it that actually liked dead or alive, extreme

02:55:19.300 --> 02:55:20.300
beach volleyball?

02:55:20.300 --> 02:55:21.300
No, it wasn't my wife.

02:55:21.300 --> 02:55:22.300
She's never seen that game.

02:55:22.300 --> 02:55:24.420
I thought there's somebody that was in melody.

02:55:24.420 --> 02:55:28.900
Maybe somebody affiliated with a show that was like that was their guilty pleasure game

02:55:28.900 --> 02:55:32.300
because again, those games are, they're, they're not great games.

02:55:32.300 --> 02:55:34.220
We all know what those games are about.

02:55:34.220 --> 02:55:38.860
Um, but, um, I, I remember there was distinctly, there was some, or goats simulator.

02:55:38.860 --> 02:55:39.860
I like goats.

02:55:39.860 --> 02:55:42.780
There was a girl gamer who said that that was the guilty pleasure game because it was

02:55:42.780 --> 02:55:43.780
all the dress up and all this.

02:55:43.780 --> 02:55:44.980
I can't remember who said that.

02:55:44.980 --> 02:55:46.860
Maybe it was princess Irene years ago.

02:55:46.860 --> 02:55:48.740
I think she would've said, I don't know.

02:55:48.740 --> 02:55:52.580
Anyway, so I don't want to, but I don't want to attribute things to people that didn't

02:55:52.580 --> 02:55:53.580
actually say them either.

02:55:53.580 --> 02:55:55.260
So I will just leave it as I don't remember.

02:55:55.260 --> 02:55:57.300
Um, but anyway, great question.

02:55:57.300 --> 02:55:59.220
I, I'm curious for the chat as well.

02:55:59.220 --> 02:56:01.660
I'll read some of the chat answers here in a minute, but a metal mayhem.

02:56:01.660 --> 02:56:02.660
Thanks for the call.

02:56:02.660 --> 02:56:03.660
As always.

02:56:03.660 --> 02:56:04.660
I really appreciate it.

02:56:04.660 --> 02:56:05.660
I have a good one.

02:56:05.660 --> 02:56:06.660
You too.

02:56:06.660 --> 02:56:07.660
All right.

02:56:07.660 --> 02:56:08.660
Uh, that's going to do it for the discord calls tonight.

02:56:08.660 --> 02:56:10.660
Um, but if you didn't get in, uh, I'm sorry.

02:56:10.660 --> 02:56:15.580
You can always send an email or tweet participate at orange lounge, radio.com or of course you

02:56:15.580 --> 02:56:22.340
can always tweet us at O L R. Um, K art says, wait, is postal still banned in Australia?

02:56:22.340 --> 02:56:23.340
Pro?

02:56:23.340 --> 02:56:25.340
I don't think games really get unbanned.

02:56:25.340 --> 02:56:26.340
Do they?

02:56:26.340 --> 02:56:27.340
Maybe a long time later.

02:56:27.340 --> 02:56:28.340
Sometimes.

02:56:28.340 --> 02:56:29.340
Yeah.

02:56:29.340 --> 02:56:30.340
I don't.

02:56:30.340 --> 02:56:31.900
I mean, were there any, any efforts to try to unban it?

02:56:31.900 --> 02:56:34.020
It's probably one of those things where it's like, it's not, they're not exactly going

02:56:34.020 --> 02:56:37.840
to haul you to jail for playing it, but they don't exactly sell it in stores.

02:56:37.840 --> 02:56:44.580
So people are probably anyone sells postal to in the stores or no, not at this point

02:56:44.580 --> 02:56:45.580
anymore.

02:56:45.580 --> 02:56:46.580
Um, let's see.

02:56:46.580 --> 02:56:49.740
Uh, Shane and chat says, I kind of want that Tsum Tsum switch game.

02:56:49.740 --> 02:56:50.740
Not going to lie.

02:56:50.740 --> 02:56:51.740
Me too.

02:56:51.740 --> 02:56:52.740
Actually.

02:56:53.140 --> 02:56:55.860
S two 100 Matt says I was on a road trip this weekend and went to a town where they use

02:56:55.860 --> 02:56:58.320
Slack to communicate in the community.

02:56:58.320 --> 02:56:59.320
So strange.

02:56:59.320 --> 02:57:00.420
It must be a Pokemon go thing.

02:57:00.420 --> 02:57:01.420
Why not?

02:57:01.420 --> 02:57:04.340
Slack is hard because you have to invite to Slack.

02:57:04.340 --> 02:57:10.460
We use Slack for ingress, but that's because with the whole espionage and secrecy, you

02:57:10.460 --> 02:57:13.000
have to be in a secure environment for that stuff.

02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:14.420
Discord isn't as good for that stuff.

02:57:14.420 --> 02:57:15.420
Yeah.

02:57:15.420 --> 02:57:19.060
Um, although there's been talk about use because the voice integration and discord is pretty

02:57:19.060 --> 02:57:20.060
great.

02:57:20.380 --> 02:57:25.220
Um, yeah, I thought most Pokemon go communities use discord plus Slack is really limited.

02:57:25.220 --> 02:57:26.220
I don't know.

02:57:26.220 --> 02:57:27.220
Anyway.

02:57:27.220 --> 02:57:28.620
Um, let's see.

02:57:28.620 --> 02:57:32.740
And also, uh, fifth dream today confirming I know three or four women who love all the

02:57:32.740 --> 02:57:35.140
dead or alive games, including X.

02:57:35.140 --> 02:57:36.140
Why not?

02:57:36.140 --> 02:57:37.140
Why not?

02:57:37.140 --> 02:57:40.060
Uh, and Miltonia's game says people don't like doom three, but I have played it many

02:57:40.060 --> 02:57:41.060
times.

02:57:41.060 --> 02:57:42.060
Yeah.

02:57:42.060 --> 02:57:43.060
That was the one.

02:57:43.060 --> 02:57:44.060
It was like, it was on the X-Box original X-Box, right?

02:57:44.060 --> 02:57:47.060
I actually own that cause I liked the old doom games and yeah, I just remember it being

02:57:47.060 --> 02:57:49.220
like, I played that game going, it's too dark.

02:57:49.380 --> 02:57:50.780
I didn't see anything in this game.

02:57:50.780 --> 02:57:51.780
Yeah.

02:57:51.780 --> 02:57:52.780
Anyway.

02:57:52.780 --> 02:57:53.780
All right.

02:57:53.780 --> 02:57:56.780
That brings us about to the close of another episode of orange lounge radio.

02:57:56.780 --> 02:57:57.780
I'm checking in.

02:57:57.780 --> 02:57:59.380
Did you have any last minute stories?

02:57:59.380 --> 02:58:00.380
Loki?

02:58:00.380 --> 02:58:01.380
Yes.

02:58:01.380 --> 02:58:05.220
I did have a quick little thing and that is that there apparently there's some indie developers,

02:58:05.220 --> 02:58:10.980
Billy laws and max Keller have got, um, a rough version of Android Q running on the

02:58:10.980 --> 02:58:11.980
switch.

02:58:11.980 --> 02:58:13.500
Thanks to home brew.

02:58:13.500 --> 02:58:18.380
So, of course, home brew is going to home brew.

02:58:18.540 --> 02:58:23.820
So yeah, that it, how, how useful it is.

02:58:23.820 --> 02:58:24.820
I don't know.

02:58:24.820 --> 02:58:27.420
I still have, I have a switch mod chip.

02:58:27.420 --> 02:58:31.700
I just never planned to use it at some point.

02:58:31.700 --> 02:58:36.660
I could use it for something, but yeah, probably end up losing it before I end up using it.

02:58:36.660 --> 02:58:37.660
All right.

02:58:37.660 --> 02:58:39.220
Any other last minute stories for us tonight?

02:58:39.220 --> 02:58:40.220
That's all I got.

02:58:40.220 --> 02:58:41.220
All right.

02:58:41.220 --> 02:58:42.220
I guess that's time for us to wrap up then.

02:58:42.220 --> 02:58:46.500
So I thank you guys again, as always for tuning into another episode of orange lounge radio,

02:58:46.500 --> 02:58:51.500
whether you were here live watching us, whether you were watching us on demand on our, the

02:58:51.500 --> 02:58:55.540
Twitch library over at VOG network, or you were listening on our podcast feed, however

02:58:55.540 --> 02:58:58.860
you are participating with this show, we thank you so much for spending your time with us

02:58:58.860 --> 02:58:59.860
this week.

02:58:59.860 --> 02:59:03.500
All we ask here at orange lounge radio, um, is please help us spread the word.

02:59:03.500 --> 02:59:07.060
We're the show where every gamer has a voice, but, uh, you know, that we need more voices

02:59:07.060 --> 02:59:10.740
here to get more opinions and more perspectives on things.

02:59:10.740 --> 02:59:14.580
So please tell a friend or two about the show, um, help us spread the word that way.

02:59:15.140 --> 02:59:19.500
Um, and a nice five star review on a site like iTunes goes a long, long way.

02:59:19.500 --> 02:59:21.900
And this is one I need to start putting out there more often too.

02:59:21.900 --> 02:59:25.220
You hear me say the same thing at the end of every show, but this one is really important

02:59:25.220 --> 02:59:26.220
too.

02:59:26.220 --> 02:59:29.900
Your hosts on Twitch are so, so good.

02:59:29.900 --> 02:59:35.060
So if you consider, um, hosting us and putting us on your auto host list, that would be fantastic.

02:59:35.060 --> 02:59:37.620
Um, that stuff goes a real long way.

02:59:37.620 --> 02:59:39.460
So that please consider it.

02:59:39.460 --> 02:59:42.300
I mean, but if you don't, we're still going to keep going with the show as long as we

02:59:42.300 --> 02:59:43.300
got it in us.

02:59:43.300 --> 02:59:44.780
So, uh, appreciate it anyway.

02:59:44.780 --> 02:59:46.980
Um, I guess that's, that's it.

02:59:46.980 --> 02:59:49.940
So I guess now we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

02:59:49.940 --> 02:59:51.660
Um, I'll start tonight.

02:59:51.660 --> 02:59:56.260
My final thought is even though my experiences were kind of varied, I look forward to playing

02:59:56.260 --> 02:59:57.260
more apex legends.

02:59:57.260 --> 03:00:01.380
I think that's going to be interesting, but I'm really looking forward to more fantasy

03:00:01.380 --> 03:00:02.380
star online.

03:00:02.380 --> 03:00:06.180
So stay tuned to my personal stream at Rob Roberts here on Twitch.

03:00:06.180 --> 03:00:10.620
I'm going to be doing some more, uh, fantasy star online, and I'm sure my good pal Delvin

03:00:10.620 --> 03:00:14.180
out there at VG realness will also be streaming as well.

03:00:14.180 --> 03:00:16.740
And, you know, I like to give him promotion as well.

03:00:16.740 --> 03:00:21.420
Uh, I also look forward to welcoming dark soccer back in studio full time next week.

03:00:21.420 --> 03:00:22.420
Yes.

03:00:22.420 --> 03:00:24.420
I was hoping to stream some this week.

03:00:24.420 --> 03:00:29.140
I didn't get a chance to, um, because I was cooking like a lot this week.

03:00:29.140 --> 03:00:33.580
So I, you know, get home and then I have all this time to cook and I didn't have, I only

03:00:33.580 --> 03:00:35.680
have a finite amount of time to do things.

03:00:35.680 --> 03:00:38.420
So, um, I don't know if I'm going to be doing it.

03:00:38.460 --> 03:00:41.460
I know I have to cook at least one or two days this week.

03:00:41.460 --> 03:00:44.660
Um, I do want to do some more streaming.

03:00:44.660 --> 03:00:46.140
Maybe I'll do some more DDR.

03:00:46.140 --> 03:00:48.740
I need to get step mania up and running at some point.

03:00:48.740 --> 03:00:53.940
I have the PZ to do it and I've got, I don't have the theme done, but I may just forego

03:00:53.940 --> 03:00:57.060
that and just put something together just to get it on the machine.

03:00:57.060 --> 03:00:59.420
Um, it's all the mess around with that.

03:00:59.420 --> 03:01:03.340
But yeah, if you guys are interested in how like my machines modded, I'm not really modded,

03:01:03.340 --> 03:01:05.740
but I need to go and clean the pads again.

03:01:05.780 --> 03:01:10.300
I don't know how interesting of a stream that would be, but I do need to do that at some

03:01:10.300 --> 03:01:11.300
point.

03:01:11.300 --> 03:01:13.540
And be sure to promote your Twitch again, cause somebody just asked.

03:01:13.540 --> 03:01:17.300
Yes, uh, twitch.tv slash Loki O L R.

03:01:17.300 --> 03:01:22.060
Um, unfortunately I'm not regular in my streaming stuff.

03:01:22.060 --> 03:01:28.340
It's usually around six o'clock, um, six 30 to like seven or eight or whatever.

03:01:28.340 --> 03:01:31.580
Um, the regular streaming thing is really hard for me too.

03:01:31.620 --> 03:01:36.340
That's why I save all my streams so that actually that fantasy star one got a lot like, well

03:01:36.340 --> 03:01:40.300
not like a ton of views, but like it was like probably more people watching it after the

03:01:40.300 --> 03:01:41.300
fact that we're watching a lot.

03:01:41.300 --> 03:01:42.300
Yeah.

03:01:42.300 --> 03:01:45.700
I'm surprised on like some of my views on stuff, um, like anybody's interest.

03:01:45.700 --> 03:01:49.180
I think as more and more people are getting jaded with YouTube, I think, I think a Twitch

03:01:49.180 --> 03:01:51.580
is very smart to get into that video on demand stuff.

03:01:51.580 --> 03:01:52.580
So good for them.

03:01:52.580 --> 03:01:53.580
Yeah.

03:01:53.580 --> 03:01:54.580
I don't know.

03:01:54.580 --> 03:01:58.180
But yeah, you can always go and watch my old, um, stuff and I am, like I said, I did crack

03:01:58.180 --> 03:01:59.180
down three the other day.

03:01:59.180 --> 03:02:02.340
I can't really stream that again because I'm already done with the game and it's kind

03:02:02.340 --> 03:02:07.700
of boring at that point, but, um, speed running, you didn't miss much.

03:02:07.700 --> 03:02:08.700
Let's put it that way.

03:02:08.700 --> 03:02:09.700
You didn't miss much.

03:02:09.700 --> 03:02:10.700
It's pretty grindy.

03:02:10.700 --> 03:02:11.900
We get to wrap up and get out of here.

03:02:11.900 --> 03:02:16.100
We will be back with dark soccer in seven days, a new month in seven days.

03:02:16.100 --> 03:02:17.100
It'll be March.

03:02:17.100 --> 03:02:18.100
I can't believe it.

03:02:18.100 --> 03:02:19.100
This year's flying by.

03:02:19.100 --> 03:02:20.580
We'll be back to do it all again in seven days.

03:02:20.580 --> 03:02:24.400
Thank you again so much for watching, uh, orange on trading and listening to orange

03:02:24.400 --> 03:02:25.400
on trail.

03:02:25.400 --> 03:02:27.020
Have a great week, everybody.

03:02:27.020 --> 03:02:28.020
Good night.

03:02:28.860 --> 03:02:32.660
