0	28000	This week Valve learned of the existence of Blastbeat drummers. Noticing the movements tracked by Vive lighthouses was too stringent for very real possibilities by human players. This is just one human powered story, stay tuned for plenty more news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
28000	30000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	46000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 764 for this February the 17th of 2019.
46000	51000	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined here in studio by Techmaster Loki. How are you, Loki?
51000	52000	I'm here.
52000	53000	You're here.
53000	56000	You made it sound like you're almost not here. Are you doing okay?
56000	57000	Yes.
57000	58000	Yes.
58000	59000	I'm fine.
59000	60000	You're just present in the moment.
60000	61000	I am present.
61000	62000	Did you have a good week?
62000	63000	Yeah, it was alright.
63000	66000	Good. You ready to go with the show? I noticed you have a Red Bull. Need a little energy, a little pick-me-up today.
66000	68000	That's more of just to avoid a headache.
68000	69000	Ah.
69000	74000	Because I think I get like caffeine withdrawal headaches. Usually I'll drink like a soda a day.
74000	75000	Right, right.
76000	85000	And yeah, I'm very tired today because I've had a very busy weekend. I was doing hostings. I hosted a gig on Friday. I did a thing last night.
85000	93000	So I'm really like tired today. But thankfully I have my version of that. I have coffee. So that's very good.
93000	101000	Anyway, as you know, Dark Sakura has been out for a little bit. She hasn't been able to join the show due to a conflict in her work schedule a little bit.
101000	105000	So we really miss Dark Sakura and we hope she'll come back real soon to the program.
105000	113000	Wait, what was that? Is there a ghost in this house? What was? Oh my gosh, she's here live in studio.
113000	114000	Dark Sakura.
114000	115000	She's squishing your head.
115000	123000	Jamie Summer is squishing my head once again on the cam because I was unable yet again to get everything organized for an over-the-shoulder shot.
123000	124000	Hi, Rob!
124000	130000	Like, stop it. It's a podcast. The podcast listeners can't see you putting unicorn faces on you.
130000	133000	You could take a hand puppet form in the show.
133000	139000	I know. There's all sorts of ideas. The idea is that the camera is going to move back over there so you'll just be able to see her back.
139000	141000	And if she chooses to wear a wig, you'll see the wig.
141000	142000	I'll bring my Dr. Claw arm.
142000	143000	Yeah, exactly.
143000	146000	But I've got a bunch of wigs now.
146000	152000	You know, I could bring the extension cord I have for my USB since I'm not using the rear camera on my cabinet.
152000	154000	Well, you can't use them with webcams.
154000	155000	Sure you can.
155000	157000	Well, but it really degrades quality.
157000	158000	No, it doesn't.
158000	159000	Really?
159000	167000	12 feet is what you can do. Or it's like 16 feet. I should know because I'm using... I have the exact same setup with that. I mean, come on.
167000	170000	Alright, then let's compare notes later and we'll make it work.
170000	176000	Well, I was more preparing for Dark Sakura's return period in March.
176000	178000	But I took a day off anyway for reasons.
178000	180000	That's right. Well, I'm not complaining. You're here.
180000	182000	You think I like working on Sunday?
182000	183000	No, of course not.
183000	185000	So now I'm going to be working on Saturday instead.
185000	187000	I'm going to 4x10s at my job.
187000	189000	That's not so bad, though. You'll have that extra day off.
189000	191000	Thursday, Friday, and Sunday off. I can deal with that.
191000	193000	Yeah. Alright, yeah.
193000	198000	Wow, everybody in chat is reading me to filth over the extension thing, which goes against a lot of the stuff I read online.
198000	199000	Yeah, there's a limit.
199000	201000	Rob, do you believe everything you read on the internet?
201000	202000	Yeah.
202000	210000	There is a limit. Yeah, you can't go over... I don't remember how much it is. It's like 16 feet or something.
211000	217000	It's a 5 foot extension cable, and I think the one I had with it was 8 feet.
217000	223000	Alright, live tech support here on Orange Launch Radio with dummy Rob Roberts who can't get everything going.
223000	226000	Why am I not seeing anybody chat? This is crazy.
226000	229000	If she really wanted to, Dark Sakura could come sit over here on the couch.
229000	233000	And that's an if I really want to, and guess who doesn't really want to?
233000	234000	There you go.
234000	235000	That would be...
235000	238000	That's it. That's the other key thing, so that's fine.
238000	242000	So, are people actually talking in the chat room? Because I don't see Jack.
242000	245000	Yeah, are you in the VOG Network chat room? Because remember to...
245000	249000	Oh, I'm on the Orange Launch Radio one. No, it says VOG Network.
249000	257000	Probably because it's hosting VOG Network, but you actually have to be at twitch.tv slash vognetwork, where we do tape live every Sunday night.
257000	258000	That's where I am.
258000	261000	At 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackill show.
261000	263000	I know where I'll be. Y'all certainly aren't here.
263000	264000	Alright, well I don't...
264000	269000	There we go. Okay, well I said I picked stream chat, so whatever, we'll see.
269000	275000	Alright, well hopefully you'll see it come up. You won't see all the history, you just see the new stuff that comes up.
275000	279000	Well, no one in America pays attention to history, so there we go, there we go.
279000	281000	Alright, you got it? You see me saying hi there in chat?
281000	283000	Yeah, that's all I got. I guess I'll deal with just Rob.
283000	288000	Wow, it's a tech support episode of Orange Launch Radio. Chat rooms and webcams, extension cords, oh my.
289000	297000	Well, apart from that though, apart from that, I do have a teensy amount of plugs to do, if that's cool.
297000	299000	I suppose. How much are we getting paid?
299000	307000	We're not, but we owe these people big for past good deeds done in our direction, and they're our official lesbians.
307000	314000	Farron, oh yes, I miss those folks. I miss them a lot. I know they used to be at the show all the time, so yeah, I miss them.
315000	319000	They moved. If they haven't been on Orange Launch Radio in a long time, because they moved to...
319000	320000	They live in the snow.
320000	323000	Yeah, they moved to the North Pole, essentially.
323000	324000	Well, at least some lake up north.
324000	326000	The other side of the wall.
326000	328000	Not that far north.
328000	336000	So, Chris and Megzi are doing an episodic podcast of their D&D games, called Let's Be Legendary.
336000	344000	It is a steampunk Wild West setting that follows bounty hunters who are romantically involved.
344000	350000	There's a half-werewolf and a grave domain cleric who likes to screw with people's heads.
350000	353000	They have 36 episodes out and do a new one every Monday.
353000	359000	They put it on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Podbean, and Stitcher.
359000	363000	And you can get to all the stuff at let'sbelegendarypodcast.com.
363000	370000	And, of course, best of all, it is highly LGBTQ plus friendly.
370000	375000	And also, Chris says, say hi to Rob. Hi, Rob.
375000	376000	Thank you very much.
376000	381000	But yeah, I'd say check them out. They're really talented.
381000	388000	And there's art for it and everything. And they have a Facebook group that you can follow.
388000	389000	It's really just good fun.
389000	393000	And honestly, they were my all-time favorite April Fool's prank we did on this show.
393000	395000	Now, it was probably like 2006 or 2007.
395000	396000	We did the Giggling Lesbian Podcast.
396000	399000	Yeah, it was the Giggling Lesbian Gaming Show was what we did.
399000	403000	And honestly, in retrospect, if you were listening to it now, you'd probably go,
403000	404000	Ooh, this is problematic or whatever.
404000	412000	But that's part of what the joke was, was all the stereotypes about the girl gamers and lesbians and stuff.
412000	416000	We kind of did all of that in just a big 20-minute joke.
416000	418000	And it was really funny, so the listeners seemed to get a kick out of it.
418000	421000	But on top of that, you know, they're just really lovely people.
421000	422000	Of course.
422000	427000	And so, you know, go out and, you know, it's kind of a unique type of podcast.
427000	429000	It's one that we don't get a lot of.
429000	433000	I mean, we do get episodic content out there, but we don't get a live D&D game too often.
433000	437000	And on top of that, they're very creative. It's just a lot of fun.
437000	438000	I think everyone should check them out.
438000	444000	I only wish they'd started their gig like two years sooner because when VOG had the radio feed,
444000	448000	I was dying for some type of like D&D serial type of podcast.
448000	449000	We could probably still make it work somehow.
449000	451000	Well, but now there's no radio feed. It's just Twitch.
451000	453000	We could probably still make it work.
453000	454000	Play it on Twitch.
454000	459000	We'll have our people call your people and our people will all discuss people things.
459000	462000	And then there will be the Hokey Pokey.
462000	469000	And then they have the new, was it Stranger Things D&D starter set that they have now?
469000	470000	I saw that.
470000	471000	Oh, yeah. I heard about that.
471000	472000	It'll be fun.
473000	479000	I think as a token, can we have like a monster named after me on the next episode?
479000	480000	Would that be appropriate?
480000	482000	I should try to dictate the narrative.
482000	486000	Dear friends, make a monster called Rob.
486000	487000	Yeah, we want a cameo.
487000	489000	And it's iridescent with a horn.
489000	490000	All right.
490000	492000	We don't know where the horn is, but there's one.
492000	494000	And what Bobby is saying in our chat.
494000	497000	And by the way, I think we may actually have a cameo from,
497000	501000	oh, yeah, that's got to be Chris in the chat right now saying I will do that.
501000	502000	Good to see you.
502000	508000	Bobby in chat says, I think half the podcasts of Dragon Con podcast track are D&D live plays.
508000	510000	It's gotten really popular in the last few years.
510000	513000	Oh, for sure. Yeah, it's it's definitely a growing genre.
513000	514000	And that's a great it's a great thing.
514000	516000	I know people love to listen to that stuff.
516000	518000	I've learned anything from the gaming industry.
518000	522000	It's a jump on that bandwagon when you can, you know, even if it's too late.
522000	523000	You know what, though?
523000	528000	You know what? No one would listen to because of all the math and physics involved in it.
528000	530000	A rifts podcast.
530000	532000	If anyone's played rifts, you know what I'm talking about.
532000	538000	And if you have played rifts, I am so freaking sorry, unless you're like a physics major and then go have at it.
538000	541000	Do you know that rifts was my first tabletop game?
541000	542000	No, I didn't know that.
542000	547000	Well, OK. I was in another one, but I didn't have to roll my own dice because the guy was like an absolute control freak.
547000	550000	But but rifts was my first tabletop game.
550000	556000	And I did have to freak and sit out with a graphing calculator to do all of my stuff because I was playing a new class.
556000	560000	It was like some battle mage, which, by the way, I got the rest of the party killed. And it was great.
560000	563000	I remember. OK, we will get into the true neutral.
563000	566000	We need to get into the Nintendo Direct, but I will go on a D&D tangent.
566000	572000	And this one's for our pals over at the Let's Be Legendary podcast.
572000	577000	My first D&D I ever played was Planeswalker. Does that sound right?
577000	580000	Well, in Planescape. That's D&D.
580000	581000	That's it. Planescape.
581000	582000	That's D&D.
582000	586000	And I remember I was in high school and it was a bunch of dudes like nerds. We all didn't fit anywhere else.
586000	588000	Did you play a tifling Rob?
588000	591000	I was the only one willing to play a female.
591000	594000	So everybody else was male and I was female.
594000	598000	So, of course, they wanted to be like, well, I'm going to hit on your character stuff.
598000	602000	And I said, you know what? I'm a lesbian. Don't bother.
602000	606000	So I remember that was one of my first D&D experiences was like that.
606000	608000	Stop. Stop trying to get awkward in here.
608000	611000	So you had to be very now that I can finally see your name right.
611000	614000	I was talking about AOL chat rooms with the dice roll feature.
614000	617000	So, girl, let me tell you a thing real quick thing.
617000	618000	All right. Real quick.
618000	620000	The Nintendo back right.
620000	626000	Actually, just before I met Dan, I was a AOL chat room role player.
626000	635000	And we used to have sparring in the various Sailor Moon or Kuno's Island for a while or then it became the right in sparring ring.
635000	638000	And this was after Dan and I were just starting to get together.
638000	646000	But I used to I still have like tons of characters that even to this day, people still know who they are because they were kind of.
646000	653000	We had prominent characters that hung out in that chat room originals after a while, because just doing the characters and games already kind of were boring.
653000	658000	But you throw them in that universe and change things up a bit. But yeah, I did dice bars and we did games like that.
658000	664000	And we even did Digimon game with dice rolling nerd.
664000	668000	Gee, Rob, what show is this?
669000	671000	Ask how long it's been running.
671000	673000	Well, since everyone's talking about.
673000	675000	Ask what game it started around.
675000	677000	Since everyone's been talking about D&D.
677000	681000	I mean, the one game that I remember why we played a D&D game.
681000	689000	It didn't get very far, but I remember the character that I played was Malcolm the Evil Jester from Chirandia, the old PC game.
689000	695000	And so I had a deck of cards that was like a, you know, magical deck of cards that did different things depending on which card you pulled.
695000	697000	It was fun.
697000	702000	I just remember when we did a Dragonlance game that we were really bored one night.
702000	706000	And so we played three kinder and a fairy dragon.
706000	714000	And I don't know if anyone would you call me kinder are really annoying kleptomaniac races who always tell the same stories about things.
714000	718000	They're kind of like really chibi like elf elf, but not like cool elves.
718000	724000	They're like, we wish we were elves, but we were a gigantic mistake of magic elf.
724000	725000	I'm a cool elf.
725000	728000	No, they were a gigantic mistake of magic.
728000	730000	Seriously, in the series they are.
730000	732000	And they're just really annoying, but can be really awesome.
732000	736000	So we had the kleptomaniac Taro or Taro or was it?
736000	737000	All right.
737000	739000	I don't even know what the hell they're called in Final Fantasy 14.
739000	741000	You turned a 30 second plug into a five minute tangent.
741000	742000	That's all right.
742000	745000	Have you just started listening to this show?
745000	746000	I mean, it's serious.
746000	747000	You're right. It's my first time here.
747000	748000	All right.
748000	749000	Let's move on.
749000	752000	I think Bobby's field is a savings throw.
752000	753000	All right, let's move on.
753000	756000	We got to talk about because there's a lot of gaming news this week, actually.
756000	762000	And it all started with the Nintendo Direct, which last week we talked about as a rumor.
762000	767000	And some of y'all, Bobby Blackwell, were like, why are you talking about rumors?
767000	768000	Because rumors don't happen.
768000	771000	I'm paraphrasing some of my own words in there.
771000	773000	Unless it's Fleetwood Mac.
773000	778000	But it turns out there really was a Nintendo Direct last week, and there was a lot of news.
778000	783000	Now, what we didn't necessarily know from all the rumors was exactly what was going to be discussed.
783000	785000	And there was some pretty big announcements.
785000	790000	Dark Sakura, I think you wanted to touch on probably what was the biggest announcement out of the whole thing, right?
790000	793000	Hold on, I have to say, Shun the Disbeliever in chat real quick.
793000	794000	Okay.
794000	795000	Oh, take your time.
795000	796000	It's just a live show.
796000	798000	Okay. Shun! Shun!
798000	804000	Anyway, so there was a lot of excitement over this one.
804000	807000	And even I might have peed my pants a little bit. Just kidding.
807000	809000	It's actually a game I never finished.
809000	813000	And I never finished it because at the time I had shit to do.
813000	817000	But The Legend of Zelda, Link's Awakening, though, that's pretty big news.
818000	827000	It is getting a full-on, you know, that 2.5D remake quality rendered stuff, prettiness.
827000	829000	Yeah, it's kind of a new look for Zelda.
829000	834000	It's kind of like, imagine if the Super Nintendo look or the link between...
834000	838000	I would put this more GameCube-ish, because it's very simple 3D.
838000	842000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. But I meant like that look, but like then enhanced in a cartoony...
842000	848000	You know what it actually reminded me of? If you ever played that, what was it, 3D.bit Game Heroes?
848000	849000	It's 3D.Game Heroes.
849000	850000	Was that at 3D.Game Heroes?
850000	855000	But like with actuals, because that was a Zelda rip-off game, or excuse me, Zelda-inspired game.
855000	858000	But now like an actual like Zelda with that.
858000	862000	Even better, though, this is going to be out on the Switch this year.
862000	865000	Although where the hell is my Animal Crossing, y'all?
865000	867000	Gotta wait for E3 for that one, I'm pretty sure.
867000	871000	Anyway, so, but a lot of people are really excited about it.
871000	873000	I'm really excited. I never actually got a chance to finish it.
873000	876000	I mean, I know how it ends, but it's funny.
876000	880000	I sent the picture to Dan and he's like, oh, this is cool.
880000	882000	And then I was like, weaned fish.
882000	885000	He's like, that fish is so windy.
885000	889000	So obviously this is the Game Boy game that they're remaking for the Switch.
889000	890000	Yes.
890000	892000	Which, you know, there's certainly going to be that part that's like,
892000	894000	but a Game Boy game's kind of, you know, aged a bit.
894000	900000	But didn't we just have on the 3DS not that long ago, we had Metroid 2, Return of Samus.
900000	903000	Had its reimagining that was released on the 3DS.
903000	909000	You know, I can't help but wonder, could this have been originally planned for 3DS?
909000	912000	But because things are slowing down a little bit on that front,
912000	915000	they did the right thing and moved it over to Switch,
915000	918000	which is definitely the right place to put something like this out.
918000	923000	But Game Boy reimaginings all these years later are certainly not unheard of at Nintendo.
923000	928000	Well, I mean, you know, the big trend right now is just, you know, remakes and rehashes.
928000	932000	But I hope that they do something else with the story to make it a little bit better.
932000	938000	I mean, how many remakes and rereleases and things have been just announced or have already come out?
938000	942000	I'll cut Nintendo a little more slack in that department
942000	948000	because when they have done the, like, reimaginings, like, in both Metroid instances,
948000	951000	Metroid Zero Mission and Metroid 2, Return of Samus,
951000	954000	they really felt like new games just with the old narrative
954000	956000	because they would add either new mechanics or, like,
956000	960000	in Zero Mission you had that whole post storyline with the Chozo and all this stuff.
960000	964000	You know, I feel like I'll let Nintendo have a pass
964000	967000	because they've never really disappointed me unless they made it very clear,
967000	972000	like, when they did the Zelda Wind Waker HD remaster and that's, like, all they did.
972000	974000	And they called it HD remaster. That's it.
974000	979000	But even in that one, they still kind of, like, they added fast travel.
979000	981000	Well, yeah, and the Metroid 2 remake was pretty awesome.
981000	982000	Yeah, yeah.
982000	985000	So I'm definitely hyped for this.
985000	987000	And this was just, I mean, I don't think anybody could have called this.
987000	991000	Now we need to see a Super Mario Land remake or...
991000	992000	You think?
992000	993000	I'm surprised we haven't seen it.
993000	998000	I would be willing to bet that that's maybe going to be in Mario Maker 2.
998000	1001000	Well, let's talk about, if we, anything else we want to say on Zelda?
1001000	1003000	Not really. I mean, what we see is what we get.
1003000	1006000	There's the trailer showing off some of the graphics.
1006000	1011000	There's just all kinds of, all kinds of good stuff.
1011000	1014000	Well, then let's move into some of the other announcements here.
1014000	1019000	Before I go to Loki, I want to read this comment from Kaijuto over at our chat at twitch.tv slash vog network,
1019000	1023000	who says they remake stuff because fans ask for them all the time.
1023000	1025000	I suppose that's part of it.
1025000	1027000	As long as they do the remake right.
1027000	1030000	You know, like, I'll get into this when we do our gaming weeks,
1030000	1034000	but the Resident Evil 2 remake is, I can't gush on it enough.
1034000	1035000	It's beautiful.
1035000	1036000	Okay.
1036000	1039000	Especially with, you know, proper skull rendering and bullet physics.
1039000	1042000	Hold that thought. Let's do some of the other Nintendo Direct News.
1042000	1045000	You touched on Mario Maker 2, so that was another big announcement.
1045000	1047000	Which is part of the rumor too, funny enough.
1047000	1050000	Yeah, that was like one of the first things that they showed off was Mario Maker 2,
1050000	1054000	and it looks awesome. They added a bunch of new things to the game, different game modes.
1054000	1060000	Now they have a Super Mario 3D World type style, I guess, of the game.
1060000	1061000	They've got a...
1061000	1063000	Oh, I didn't see that there was a 3D World. That's cool.
1063000	1066000	Yeah, well, it's still 2D, but the style is 3D.
1066000	1068000	That's where they have the cat Mario.
1068000	1069000	Okay.
1069000	1072000	And then they have slopes, and they've added new enemies.
1072000	1073000	The sun was there.
1073000	1074000	The sun is there.
1074000	1076000	Clear pipes, I saw, yeah.
1076000	1079000	They have a desert is one of the themes as well.
1079000	1083000	And then, I don't know, just lots of good stuff.
1083000	1086000	So is this kind of maybe more like Super Mario Maker Plus?
1086000	1088000	I think there's enough that they've changed.
1088000	1089000	Yeah.
1089000	1092000	I feel like there's this interesting thing that they're doing on the Switch,
1092000	1095000	and I feel it happened a little bit with Splatoon 2,
1095000	1097000	happened a little bit with Super Smash Brothers, honestly,
1097000	1101000	is that they kind of took what really worked in the Wii U game,
1101000	1104000	and honestly, I'm not going to say they copy-pasted,
1104000	1106000	because obviously we know more goes into the programming than that,
1106000	1111000	but they kind of took a base and added all this other flavor around it
1111000	1113000	to make a new experience.
1113000	1115000	And I think that's kind of what we're getting with this,
1115000	1118000	or it seems from the early trailer what we're getting from this Mario Maker 2.
1118000	1120000	Yeah, and it's good to see that it's actually coming out,
1120000	1123000	and I know the worry was before that,
1123000	1128000	well, how is that going to translate from touchscreen to actual TV?
1128000	1131000	They've got this new radial menu that they're using now,
1131000	1132000	which looks pretty cool.
1132000	1134000	But you can also do a touchscreen.
1134000	1137000	Well, right, you can do it on that for handheld mode, too,
1137000	1140000	but they do have the radial thing if you want to do that.
1140000	1144000	And it's hinted, but they don't really talk about it,
1144000	1148000	but you'll notice that Mario Maker 2 has both Mario and Luigi on the front,
1148000	1151000	meaning maybe we'll see some two-player co-op in there.
1151000	1154000	Which I kind of hypothesized in the last episode
1154000	1156000	that it would be cool to have the player versus player,
1156000	1158000	but your shadows, you don't really run into each other.
1158000	1159000	Yeah.
1159000	1160000	Yeah, that would be cool.
1160000	1161000	I hope there's something like that.
1161000	1162000	That's something that they had.
1162000	1169000	And then along with that, there was also some stuff that they showed off for,
1169000	1170000	well, they had demos that they announced.
1170000	1174000	So they had a Daemon X Machina Switch demo that came out,
1174000	1179000	as well as a demo for the new Yoshi Crafted World.
1179000	1185000	They showed off, they were talking about Smash Bros. Ultimate 3.0 update.
1185000	1188000	There's a lot of other games that are just kind of, eh, okay.
1188000	1191000	Rune Factory, they announced a new one.
1191000	1193000	You know, some people get really into those, though.
1193000	1196000	On my Twitter feed, maybe you're not a big fan of Rune Factory.
1196000	1198000	I got friends that were hype about that.
1198000	1202000	Final Fantasy VII, they announced dates for that,
1202000	1204000	as well as Choco-bo Mystery Dungeon.
1204000	1207000	And then Final Fantasy IX came out that day.
1207000	1208000	That was a big...
1208000	1213000	Yeah, they did quite a few, like, it's out today announcements,
1213000	1217000	whether it was a demo or, you know, 21 bucks for Final Fantasy IX,
1217000	1221000	or I'm sure you'll get to it here in a minute, but Tetris 99, obviously.
1221000	1223000	Tetris 99 was a big announcement.
1223000	1224000	Yeah.
1224000	1225000	And like Battle Royale Tetris game.
1225000	1230000	Yeah, and it was interesting because it's only for the Nintendo Online subscribers.
1230000	1233000	And we just had been talking about on the show a couple weeks ago
1233000	1236000	about how Nintendo's investors were kind of pressuring them
1236000	1239000	to do some things to make that service a little sweeter.
1239000	1241000	And so people were saying,
1241000	1243000	oh, it's going to be Super Nintendo games on the service.
1243000	1247000	But I think it's kind of nice to see games that are being designed
1247000	1251000	for the service as like a free, you know, type of experience.
1251000	1255000	And so, I mean, I don't think anybody could have thought,
1255000	1259000	oh, Tetris as a Battle Royale game is something Nintendo should do for online.
1259000	1261000	But now that it's here, it's kind of like,
1261000	1263000	this is a very Nintendo way to do it.
1263000	1265000	Yes, this is good.
1265000	1269000	They showed off some of the content for Dragon Quest 11.
1269000	1272000	That's going to be exclusive to the platform.
1272000	1274000	Oh, yeah, that retro mode. That's a big deal.
1274000	1275000	Yeah, that's kind of different.
1275000	1277000	Again, they're taking like the 3DS stuff
1277000	1280000	and now they're putting it on the, because in Japan it was on 3DS,
1280000	1282000	and now they're going to put it on the Switch as like,
1282000	1284000	I think instead of like a dual screen,
1284000	1286000	it'll kind of be something you can flip back and forth between.
1286000	1288000	And that's really cool.
1288000	1290000	If only they could go back and redo the soundtrack,
1290000	1292000	which I guess, well, I guess they are kind of doing that.
1292000	1293000	Yeah, well, they have.
1293000	1294000	I mean, they need like new music.
1294000	1296000	Right, right. Sorry.
1296000	1300000	I was going to say also they announced Deltarune coming to the Switch.
1300000	1303000	They've got some new Fire Emblem Three Houses game.
1303000	1306000	Announced a date for that in July.
1306000	1310000	Assassin's Creed 3 remasters coming to the Switch.
1310000	1311000	Fun.
1311000	1314000	Starlink Battle for Atlas, which I...
1314000	1317000	They're still trying to push that game.
1317000	1319000	Well, it's not Star Fox, but...
1319000	1322000	But they've got a lot of Star Fox content in there,
1322000	1325000	but I don't think anyone gives a shit about it, but whatever.
1325000	1328000	Okay, but you say that you're projecting what you think on everybody out there.
1328000	1330000	Is anybody in chat a fan of Starlink?
1330000	1332000	Set Loki straight.
1332000	1334000	All two of you out there.
1334000	1339000	They showed off a Disney Tsum Tsum festival, which is...
1339000	1342000	I kind of like thought that was interesting.
1342000	1345000	Because I like the Tsum Tsum arcade game at round one.
1345000	1347000	And like, have you ever seen those little collectibles?
1347000	1348000	No.
1348000	1349000	They're cute.
1349000	1351000	No, I have not.
1352000	1353000	What else?
1353000	1355000	Box boy and box girl coming to the Switch.
1355000	1357000	And they announce Captain Marvel is going to be
1357000	1359000	part of the cast of Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3,
1359000	1360000	which is like, duh.
1360000	1361000	Of course.
1361000	1362000	Of course.
1362000	1363000	Of course.
1365000	1367000	Some comments in chat on Starlink.
1367000	1368000	Bobby Blackwell says,
1368000	1371000	I have a friend who's a huge fan of Starlink on the Switch.
1371000	1372000	He has like 85 hours in it.
1372000	1374000	So Bobby knows a guy.
1374000	1375000	There's one.
1375000	1376000	Let's see.
1377000	1378000	Act F says,
1378000	1383000	I got Starlink with the AR wing for $25 on Amazon.
1383000	1384000	MNZeba says,
1384000	1385000	I am interested in Starlink.
1385000	1386000	Thank you, MNZeba.
1386000	1387000	VG Realness says,
1387000	1390000	Nintendo has full on stolen Starlink
1390000	1392000	and just made it their game now.
1392000	1393000	I made this.
1393000	1394000	You made this.
1394000	1395000	I made this.
1395000	1396000	Yes, they did.
1396000	1397000	They did do that.
1397000	1398000	I think that's why, you know,
1398000	1399000	originally when Starfox was in there,
1399000	1400000	that was the whole reason people bought it.
1400000	1401000	It's like, oh, hey, Starfox.
1401000	1402000	You know, it wasn't because,
1402000	1403000	Oh my God, Starlink.
1403000	1404000	Yeah.
1404000	1405000	I needed this.
1405000	1407000	And Big Red Pimp says,
1407000	1408000	I enjoyed Starlink.
1408000	1409000	Still playing it too.
1409000	1410000	So there's,
1410000	1412000	there's a few people in chat who are,
1412000	1413000	have at least some,
1413000	1415000	some tepid excitement about it.
1415000	1416000	Yeah.
1416000	1419000	They had some other games that they showed off as well.
1419000	1420000	I'm not,
1420000	1423000	I know they had a new game by,
1423000	1425000	Oh God.
1425000	1428000	I can't remember the name of the studio now.
1428000	1429000	The platinum game?
1429000	1430000	Yeah.
1430000	1431000	The new platinum.
1431000	1432000	Yeah.
1432000	1433000	That looked pretty awesome.
1433000	1434000	Yeah, sure did.
1435000	1438000	Although I was hoping maybe it would be Bayonetta 3 stuff,
1438000	1440000	but they already talked about Bayonetta 3.
1440000	1442000	So yeah, they, they did talk about that before.
1442000	1443000	And I don't know if,
1443000	1444000	I don't think it's on the show world tonight.
1444000	1445000	No, it's not.
1445000	1446000	And,
1446000	1447000	but it was on discord.
1447000	1448000	If you're on the VOG network discord,
1448000	1450000	there was some chatter about this in the OLR channel,
1450000	1454000	about how it seems like the director or who was assumed to be
1454000	1458000	directing Bayonetta 3 is no longer with platinum games.
1458000	1461000	And had posted a thing on his Twitter about I'm no longer,
1461000	1462000	you know, with the studio or whatever.
1462000	1465000	So there may have been some switcheroo that, I mean,
1465000	1469000	may have set Bayonetta 3 back. Don't know.
1469000	1472000	I mean, I don't want to make stuff up, but it definitely seems like,
1472000	1474000	you know, with the change in staffing,
1474000	1475000	there could be some things that are,
1475000	1478000	they're putting a little bump in Bayonetta 3's development,
1478000	1481000	but you know what? Take the time to get it right.
1481000	1482000	It's just fine.
1482000	1483000	Exactly.
1483000	1485000	And I do like the fact that a lot of the stuff that they're showing off
1485000	1487000	were indie games as well.
1487000	1489000	So that's pretty cool that they had all that like a focus,
1489000	1492000	but I mean, yes, a lot of the directs are like that.
1492000	1497000	Um, but yeah, I mean that probably that's a good portion of it.
1497000	1501000	I don't know if we've missed anything in huge in particular, but.
1501000	1504000	What'd you guys think? And I'll open this question up to chat as well.
1504000	1505000	And Dark Soccer, I don't know if you,
1505000	1509000	you watched the director just kind of saw the headlines, but overall,
1509000	1511000	like what'd you guys think of the direct?
1511000	1513000	Like, did you think it was a good presentation?
1513000	1514000	Do you think it was a waste of 30 minutes?
1514000	1515000	No, I think it was good.
1515000	1516000	Yeah.
1516000	1517000	I thought it was good.
1517000	1520000	There was a lot of big announcements packed in 30 minutes.
1520000	1521000	It's.
1521000	1524000	I don't usually think many of the directs are bad anyway.
1524000	1525000	Yeah.
1525000	1526000	So.
1526000	1527000	Yeah.
1527000	1529000	Um, I thought, I actually thought it was like a strong direct.
1529000	1532000	I thought it was like, this was probably on par,
1532000	1536000	if not past some of their E3 directs, honestly.
1536000	1539000	Like, and I'm talking, I'm not talking like E3 recently,
1539000	1540000	cause they've been pretty strong recently,
1540000	1543000	but like in some of the Wii U years where it was a little weaker,
1543000	1546000	I think this direct was probably stronger than some of those E3 years.
1546000	1548000	So, um, I did a really good job.
1548000	1550000	So, and, um,
1550000	1557000	very interesting to see how E3 is like more and more becoming like a
1557000	1558000	footnote for some.
1558000	1562000	So I think we're going to start to see more announcements, big stuff,
1562000	1564000	definitely outside the June period. I mean, again,
1564000	1566000	I don't think it's on the show world tonight, but, uh, there was a,
1566000	1569000	it was a pretty, um, I don't know,
1569000	1573000	it was a pretty interesting comment from, um, one of the heads up at Sony.
1573000	1576000	I don't remember if it was Shawn Layton or somebody else. I apologize.
1576000	1577000	I don't remember in the moment,
1577000	1581000	but basically laid it out on why they weren't going to E3.
1581000	1583000	And it was basically, you know,
1583000	1587000	kind of about that E3 is not what it used to be. It's not like they, they,
1587000	1590000	they get all the retailers at their own event now.
1590000	1593000	And it's not like it's not what it was. So, uh,
1593000	1597000	it's going to be interesting to see more of a calendar year full of these big
1597000	1601000	bang announcements as opposed to holding everything for June. Huh? Yeah. Yeah.
1602000	1604000	Uh, let's see, going to our chat, uh,
1604000	1608000	Bobby Black Wolf in chat says Intellivision is going to have a larger E3
1608000	1611000	presence than Sony. You know what though, for something like that,
1611000	1612000	I'm fine with that actually.
1612000	1616000	For something like Intellivision that actually makes a lot of sense because if
1616000	1621000	E3 is going to be more about gamers and starting to get, uh, like, you know,
1621000	1625000	more like regular people, so to speak out on the floor as well as, you know,
1625000	1629000	I don't know, uh, bloggers and YouTubers and things like that. Like, you know,
1629000	1632000	Intellivision is going to be kind of challenged with, uh,
1632000	1635000	and the Amico and all this stuff is just kind of challenged with finding its
1635000	1639000	niche and getting the message about where they see themselves with gamers. Right.
1639000	1643000	And taking your case directly to the gamers is not a bad idea.
1643000	1650000	So like aside from indie game studios having to really focus on trying to get
1650000	1652000	their game out on as many platforms as possible,
1652000	1654000	let's just like completely ignore that for a second here.
1654000	1658000	What seems to be driving a lot of these game, you know,
1658000	1665000	major game hardware publishers and their consoles between their releases of games.
1665000	1666000	It's all the indie games.
1666000	1672000	So if you get a console that's basically able to get all those indie games on it,
1672000	1676000	um, then I think that's really going to be a strong console.
1676000	1680000	But the problem is they're also everywhere else. So, you know, you have that.
1680000	1684000	But I think that they were doing some stuff that was supposed to be exclusive to it.
1684000	1689000	Well, I also think this is one place where the Switch has really succeeded
1689000	1693000	and why it's done better than the Wii U in so many ways is because it got in with
1693000	1697000	those indies early on. And yes, even though it might be like, you know,
1697000	1701000	something like Wargroove or whatever is essentially the same game on the Switch
1701000	1705000	as is on the PlayStation 4, the fact that, you know, you're thinking in the back of your head,
1705000	1709000	oh, well, if I buy it on the Switch, I have it portable and on the TV,
1709000	1712000	like that really kind of clinches the deal for a lot of people.
1712000	1716000	So I think that's, even though something might be available on multiple platforms,
1716000	1722000	um, we'll see. So it'll be interesting to see if Sony or Microsoft with PlayStation 5
1722000	1727000	try to do something like that. I'm not saying they're going to like jack the Switch,
1727000	1732000	but what about something that you have like a cell phone app where you can tap into your console
1732000	1735000	and do a limited amount of things. I don't know. I'm going...
1735000	1740000	No phone apps. Stop with the phone apps. I'll take a Vita 2. I don't want the phone apps.
1740000	1744000	I know. I'm going a little crazy and tinfoil hatty, but, you know, it happens.
1744000	1749000	Uh, let's see. Some other comments in chat. VGRealness says, uh, LOL, remember the E3?
1749000	1754000	They talked about Woolly World for like 20 minutes and had the woman who made the giant amiibo talk
1754000	1759000	for like ever the dark years. Maybe it wasn't E3, but it was a direct. And I was like, wow.
1759000	1764000	That's a lot of these. And it's not even just necessarily Nintendo, but there's a lot of these.
1764000	1770000	EA, um, where they'll bring out, you know, FIFA players and they'll talk forever about FIFA, which is fine.
1770000	1775000	I guess people like FIFA around the world mean it's, you know, the soccer is the number one sports game.
1775000	1781000	You know, so that's what we call soccer. That's fine. But even if like, OK, like for me, no,
1781000	1785000	actually, no, you're right. If they're talking with the thought of for 20 minutes, I'd be fine with that, too.
1785000	1789000	But it depends. Like if they're talking about the game, then I'd be fine with that.
1789000	1793000	But if it's just like I'm to do the create a grant, the daughter, let me talk about 20 minutes about bullshit.
1793000	1797000	You know, then I don't really care about it. Yeah, no. If they were to and Jamie's going to back me up on this.
1797000	1801000	If they were to come out and say, we're going to be doing a guardian legend remaster.
1801000	1806000	I'm going to be like, oh, I need I need you to spend the next hour going over the following details.
1806000	1810000	How are you inspired by the original? What's the soundtrack going to be like?
1810000	1815000	Tell me about the character. Like, I want to make sure you will there be a low low.
1815000	1820000	I don't want to make sure you're just remastering one of the greatest, most underlooked eight big titles of all time.
1821000	1824000	I want to make sure you're fucking doing it right, because I've been let down.
1824000	1828000	I was still mad about that project that got shut down. Yeah, right.
1828000	1834000	So anyway, imagine somebody like just tuned in on Twitch and heard us talking about guardian legend remaster.
1834000	1838000	Got really excited for a minute. Sorry, I was talking about.
1838000	1842000	But you should be really, really excited about the guardian legend in general.
1842000	1849000	Just go back and play the original. Just to be honest, don't play guardic because it's not great in all of its MSX non-scrolling glory.
1849000	1853000	It's the reason why we have what we have anyway.
1853000	1855000	Yeah, they learned from their mistakes. All right.
1855000	1858000	If we don't have anything else to say on the Nintendo Direct, then I think we're good.
1858000	1864000	I think we'll move on to the types of games we have been playing this week, be it the guardian legend or something else.
1864000	1867000	And I'll start with you, dark soccer. How was your gaming week?
1867000	1876000	Well, the the ghost survivor dropped for Resident Evil two, and it's some pretty good what if stuff.
1876000	1880000	It's basically you've got three scenarios to start off with.
1880000	1887000	One of them is the about to be embalmed woman that you find somewhere in the game who's already dead.
1887000	1891000	But you play her having survived and escaping.
1891000	1898000	And then another one is the cop that like that you find dead right at the start of the game.
1898000	1905000	That's not really a spoiler. So you actually play him escaping and, you know, getting out.
1905000	1910000	And then another umbrella person also escaping these scenarios are pretty hard.
1910000	1917000	And you get like vendor zombies, these zombies wandering around with backpacks and you shoot them and you get stuff.
1917000	1926000	You also do have vending machines that you can. Oh, you can get a flash grenade or a chemical flamethrower.
1926000	1932000	If I got a chemical flamethrower out of the vending machine, I'd be like, shit, yeah, but no.
1932000	1939000	And then, like, if you beat all three, then you get like another thing actually to get back one of the one of the other ones.
1939000	1945000	I think that was the the the one with the cop. I think that was the special edition one.
1945000	1949000	But there's another one where you can play like Richard Kendo, the guy who owns the gun shop.
1949000	1957000	And, you know, his issues with his family is his part of the story made me cry, not cry, like for real, but like, oh.
1957000	1961000	And then we got another pimple.
1961000	1963000	We sold the getaway.
1963000	1965000	You might have a problem if.
1965000	1966000	No, we traded.
1966000	1968000	I think it's no, I think it's rad. You guys.
1968000	1970000	We have a Ghostbusters pro edition.
1970000	1971000	Oh, wow.
1971000	1975000	So Ghostbusters is a really, really good table and I'm super happy we have it.
1975000	1978000	Is that the one that makes it? I could be right. Is that mix the new and the old?
1978000	1979000	No, no, it's all the old.
1979000	1980000	It's just the old. OK.
1980000	1982000	Yeah, it's a really fun table.
1982000	1991000	And the thing that I like is that the pin that was in the the firehouse in the movie is actually on the little painted window in the firehouse in the game.
1991000	1993000	So it's pretty cool.
1993000	2000000	And then that's really been about the extent I've had a lot of projects going on in some drama.
2000000	2003000	So that's been the extent of it.
2003000	2007000	Sounds good. Well, except the drama part, but the game stuff sounds good.
2007000	2012000	If drama was a person, it could sit on a dildo made of sandpaper and spin for an hour.
2012000	2013000	OK, wow.
2013000	2016000	Anyway, thanks for that visual. Moving on.
2016000	2019000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
2019000	2022000	It was all right. I played a lot of Crackdown three.
2022000	2025000	I did stream some of it as well.
2025000	2029000	It's running OK on my PC, but it's I don't know.
2029000	2032000	I'm surprised how much it definitely makes the fans rev up.
2032000	2035000	Sounds like I have a jet engine taking off, but I like it.
2035000	2039000	It's really fun. The reviews haven't been so great for it, though.
2039000	2042000	Everyone complains about it. I don't know.
2042000	2049000	I really think that they really overhyped the whole like, oh, the cloud.
2049000	2052000	We need the cloud to be able to process all the epicness.
2052000	2054000	No, no, you don't.
2054000	2059000	I haven't played the multiplayer mode yet, but I've watched video online and it's just it's neat.
2059000	2064000	But there's other aside from it being like a tech demo for here's what we can do with the cloud
2064000	2070000	and processing destruction stuff, which, to be honest, the same type of destruction.
2070000	2076000	You can probably see that in Battlefield, all those games and stuff with their destruction engine.
2076000	2081000	I just think that other people have done it way better and it's been out for a while.
2081000	2085000	But the game itself is fun. It's Crackdown.
2085000	2087000	If you played Crackdown, do you know what this is?
2087000	2091000	Plus, it has Terry Crews being extra and it's awesome.
2091000	2100000	The beginning cinematic with Terry Crews in it had me grinning pretty wide.
2100000	2102000	So it's pretty awesome.
2102000	2105000	I have yet to check this out. I really want to check out Crackdown 3.
2105000	2108000	I'm just like, you know, cost and all that stuff.
2108000	2110000	But you were doing a live stream the other night, right?
2110000	2111000	Yes, I was for VR.
2111000	2115000	Sadly, I was hosting a show I couldn't watch, but I saw a little thing came up on my notifications.
2115000	2117000	I wanted to watch it.
2117000	2123000	Yes, so I did do that for a little bit because I'm trying to get my affiliate thing still.
2123000	2126000	I still need more people chatting and watching.
2128000	2131000	What else? I played a little DDR this week.
2134000	2136000	That's pretty much it. I downloaded Tetris 99.
2136000	2139000	I didn't get a chance to play it and I still haven't played any Kingdom Hearts.
2139000	2143000	Hopefully, I do actually play some of it because I'm worried it's going to end up being
2143000	2146000	like a lot of the other games I buy and don't play.
2147000	2150000	Whatever. But Crackdown 3, though, I've been playing quite a bit.
2150000	2152000	I've gotten through...
2153000	2156000	It's a lot harder than the very first Crackdown game.
2156000	2159000	You could just blow through that super fast.
2159000	2164000	You go to the lieutenants. It's just like you literally sprint to the lieutenants headquarters
2164000	2166000	and just kill them instantly and done.
2166000	2168000	It's like awesome.
2168000	2171000	This is a little bit more involved.
2171000	2176000	I like the way they have it set up because Saints Row did steal a lot from Crackdown
2176000	2180000	as far as how they set up where you do small little activities
2180000	2184000	to build towards taking on a boss and stuff.
2184000	2187000	They do that with a lot of the gangs and the side missions.
2187000	2193000	Same thing with Crackdown. You have to take over certain parts of the map.
2193000	2197000	As you do that, it weakens the boss that you're going to fight.
2197000	2201000	Then when you defeat the boss, it weakens the big boss.
2201000	2206000	I took out this AI that was controlling all of these monorail terminals.
2206000	2213000	Because I took over the AI, these moving platforms that were frozen in this building
2213000	2215000	are now moving because I did that.
2215000	2218000	It sounds kind of like Zelda Breath of the Wild in a little bit of a way.
2218000	2221000	You can run to the final boss if you want. It's really hard.
2221000	2226000	But if you take out the big machine dungeon things, then it makes it easier.
2226000	2228000	Yeah, it's sort of like that.
2228000	2232000	It'll be interesting. And of course all the orbs and stuff are pretty fun.
2232000	2235000	But yeah, I'm really enjoying it.
2235000	2237000	So I'll try to stream some more of that.
2237000	2239000	I was going to do that earlier today, too.
2239000	2243000	But my family didn't end up leaving when I needed them to.
2243000	2247000	I was going to do it before the show because I thought it would be the perfect time to do that.
2247000	2248000	Whoops.
2248000	2249000	Alright.
2249000	2252000	Well, my gaming week, I did play a little bit of Tetris 99.
2252000	2256000	It's going to come up again later in the show in a little pre-recorded segment.
2256000	2258000	So I won't get too far into that.
2258000	2260000	But I am enjoying it. I'll say that.
2260000	2265000	Even though it's very bare bones, very simple, I do hope they are looking to expand on it later.
2265000	2268000	Which I understand they may have found some things in data mining.
2268000	2270000	So that would be good.
2270000	2272000	That would be good if they expand on that in the future.
2272000	2275000	But I've enjoyed what little I've played of Tetris 99 so far.
2275000	2277000	Been continuing World of Warcraft.
2277000	2279000	That's kind of my old standby time waster.
2279000	2281000	Because I'm not really playing Final Fantasy XIV right now.
2281000	2283000	That's on the back burner until the expansion release.
2284000	2286000	I got my shaman up to level 120.
2286000	2288000	Been world questing, trying to get my gear up.
2288000	2290000	You have no idea what any of this means, huh?
2290000	2292000	Just wow things.
2292000	2294000	Just wow things.
2294000	2296000	So I've been playing that.
2296000	2299000	And then the good old cell phone games too, like Pokemon Go.
2299000	2301000	Nobody brought up Community Day.
2301000	2304000	I'll mention the Community Day was yesterday.
2304000	2306000	And it was really low key.
2306000	2308000	What was it?
2308000	2310000	Oh, that's why I kept seeing those around.
2311000	2314000	I just thought it was like the Chinese New Year crap.
2314000	2316000	Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, right?
2316000	2318000	No, that was Community Day was yesterday.
2318000	2320000	I guess that was a few weeks ago.
2320000	2322000	I was reminded though, I'm so mad.
2322000	2325000	Because I had such a busy day yesterday, as did Alan.
2325000	2328000	Is that I did all my trainer battles and got the Sinnoh Stones from those.
2328000	2330000	And I did one PvP battle with Alan.
2330000	2332000	But I forgot to do four more.
2332000	2335000	So I missed out on those extra Sinnoh Stones.
2335000	2338000	And I'm really pressed about it because I still have stuff I need to evolve.
2339000	2342000	But I did get five shinies during the event.
2342000	2344000	And really we took it easy.
2344000	2348000	You know, Shane, the shiny hunter friend of mine, moved.
2348000	2351000	So he's doing Community Day elsewhere now.
2351000	2353000	But it's not really go, go, go, go, go.
2353000	2355000	We got to get shinies.
2355000	2358000	He would always kind of end up going off on his own anyway.
2358000	2360000	But yeah, we kind of were like really lazy.
2360000	2363000	And once we got like three shinies, we were like eh.
2363000	2365000	And so we ended up raiding for the last hour of it.
2365000	2369000	Because Alan and I still didn't have the Palika.
2369000	2371000	Sorry, I forget the name of that boss that's out right now.
2371000	2373000	We didn't have it yet still.
2373000	2376000	So because we were downtown, there's lots of people around.
2376000	2377000	It was a really good chance to raid.
2377000	2380000	And so I got one on the first raid finally.
2380000	2381000	And Alan got one on the second raid.
2381000	2384000	So we were like, okay, well that actually feels like just...
2384000	2386000	That almost feels like more of an accomplishment than the shinies.
2386000	2388000	Because we needed that for the Pokédex.
2388000	2390000	So that was good.
2391000	2392000	Still quite a few people out.
2392000	2395000	But I feel like it wasn't as crowded this time as it was before.
2395000	2397000	It's Swinub, so no one gives a crap about it.
2397000	2400000	I think it's part that and part the fact that rain was in the forecast.
2400000	2405000	And maybe just the fact that Pokémon GO has had a lot of like go, go, go stuff lately.
2405000	2409000	And I don't know, like I don't want to say Pokémon GO is dying.
2409000	2411000	It's not, but it's probably starting to...
2411000	2416000	You know, I'm not sure their strategy of drip feeding the Gen 4 Pokémon
2416000	2419000	and then forcing you to use stones to evolve a lot of them.
2419000	2421000	And a lot of them I still haven't been...
2421000	2423000	Which, how do you get those?
2423000	2430000	You have to do either trainer battles or you do the PvP battles with friends that are 3 stars or higher.
2430000	2431000	And they're not guaranteed.
2431000	2432000	But the Sinnoh stones?
2432000	2436000	No, you can also get them by completing the weekly challenge things too.
2436000	2438000	I've done those too and haven't gotten them.
2438000	2440000	It's a 20% drop rate from that.
2440000	2441000	I've gotten a few.
2441000	2442000	I know.
2442000	2443000	All of mine are from that.
2444000	2452000	I did the trainer battles with the heads of each of the groups or whatever.
2452000	2454000	And those are stupid easy.
2454000	2455000	Shut the front door.
2455000	2457000	Act F says you can still do battles to get Sinnoh stones today.
2457000	2458000	Really?
2458000	2460000	Well we might have to do that later.
2460000	2462000	Before Dark Sakura leaves.
2462000	2463000	I'll battle her.
2463000	2464000	Help her get some Sinnoh stones.
2464000	2465000	Because I want them too.
2465000	2467000	So you don't have to win.
2467000	2468000	You just have to do them.
2468000	2469000	Which is really weird.
2469000	2471000	So you get participation trophies.
2471000	2472000	It's all Pidgeys.
2472000	2473000	I'm gonna do all Pidgeys.
2473000	2474000	Yeah, sure.
2474000	2475000	Why?
2475000	2476000	Why not?
2476000	2477000	It's getting destroyed.
2477000	2480000	Anyhow, so that's enough of my gaming week.
2480000	2481000	I suppose that's all I really need to say about that.
2481000	2483000	So we will get into some gaming news.
2483000	2485000	I don't have a lot to say for any type of housekeeping stuff.
2485000	2489000	Just the good old always follow us on Twitter at OLR.
2489000	2491000	And of course we are on Twitch every week.
2491000	2493000	Sunday nights at VOG Network.
2493000	2495000	So please follow us at VOG Network.
2495000	2500000	And we do really appreciate all you guys who send us biddies throughout the show.
2500000	2501000	We really appreciate that.
2501000	2503000	And the subscriptions are great as well.
2503000	2505000	And I know some people have been very interested in subscribing.
2505000	2508000	Because some people are actually like watching the video.
2508000	2510000	Instead of listening to the podcast.
2510000	2513000	Which is still gonna be free like it always was.
2513000	2515000	But we thought if we're gonna do a little something extra like the video.
2515000	2517000	That will be the thing that's behind the subscription.
2517000	2520000	But so many people have Twitch Prime anyway.
2520000	2523000	Like you kinda have a free sub a month anyway.
2523000	2525000	So if you feel like using it on us.
2525000	2526000	That'd be awesome.
2526000	2528000	And then yeah follow me on Twitch as well.
2529000	2530000	And come watch my streams.
2530000	2532000	Because I need more people to watch my streams.
2532000	2535000	Thank you Act Deaf for tuning into my Crackdown stream.
2535000	2537000	You were streaming on Friday night though right?
2537000	2538000	I know.
2538000	2540000	It was just it was just timing.
2540000	2541000	Do something like.
2541000	2543000	I try to do stuff during the week.
2543000	2545000	But I also have to like you have to understand like.
2545000	2548000	I have to also cook and get the kids ready for bed.
2548000	2552000	Because God forbid no one else in our house is gonna actually do any of that.
2552000	2553000	So yeah.
2553000	2554000	You have to see if you can get a friend to host you or something.
2554000	2555000	Because that'll go a long way.
2555000	2558000	Like see if you can do Tuesday after anime jam session.
2558000	2561000	And then go to Rama and say please please please help me out and host.
2561000	2564000	Or like you know Sunday after OLR would be perfect.
2564000	2566000	But unfortunately you have to drive home.
2566000	2567000	Yes.
2567000	2568000	Yeah so.
2568000	2571000	But well I mean sometime you could have maybe Bobby would do it for 30 minutes.
2571000	2573000	And then you could go after him or something.
2573000	2574000	Yeah I guess.
2574000	2575000	Or something out.
2575000	2576000	Yeah.
2576000	2577000	It's fine.
2577000	2578000	You know what.
2578000	2580000	The more I think about it though it's like.
2580000	2581000	Eh.
2581000	2583000	You know like how much am I actually doing this.
2583000	2584000	It's not like you're gonna make.
2584000	2585000	Like eh.
2585000	2586000	It's just like.
2586000	2587000	That's the thing with VoG too.
2587000	2589000	Like we appreciate the biddies and we appreciate the subs and all that stuff.
2589000	2593000	But like we do not have fantasies or actually like make a profit off this thing.
2593000	2594000	Yeah.
2594000	2598000	Like the money is going into essentially like the business element of this whole thing is
2598000	2599000	a big part of it.
2599000	2604000	And then at some point we would like to put the money I think into making more like merchandise.
2604000	2607000	And I think conventions is really the big thing we would like to be able to use money
2607000	2611000	to do is to like sponsor or get our name out there and more things.
2611000	2612000	Yeah.
2612000	2614000	Like in the marketing side of things to help grow.
2614000	2615000	I think.
2615000	2618000	And that that ain't free because we've been paying all that out of pocket until now.
2618000	2621000	But having a little extra coin will help us maybe do a few extra events.
2621000	2622000	So.
2622000	2623000	I'll be fine.
2623000	2624000	Yeah.
2624000	2625000	All right.
2625000	2626000	Anyhow.
2626000	2627000	Gaming news.
2627000	2628000	We have a lot of news to touch on for the week.
2628000	2629000	It was a busy week and not so great news to start.
2629000	2630000	Right.
2630000	2631000	Yes.
2631000	2636000	Unfortunately as we hinted last week it ended up becoming true on Tuesday.
2636000	2641000	Activision Blizzard did lay off 8 percent of its staff which was about 800 people.
2641000	2648000	And you know from all different lines of their business basically I think they're seeing
2648000	2656000	the king Activision Blizzard the Blizzard side of the house and Activision were all
2656000	2659000	kind of a lot of them were let go.
2659000	2666000	They had a lot of the I think a lot of the people that got let go just found out from
2666000	2667000	the call.
2667000	2674000	The worst part about it though was during the earnings call they started our Bobby Kotick
2674000	2680000	started off once again achieved record results in 2018.
2680000	2684000	So that's why we got to lay off 800 peoples because we've made all this money and we need
2684000	2686000	more of it I guess.
2686000	2687000	Well.
2687000	2688000	Here's the thing.
2688000	2689000	I don't know.
2689000	2694000	This is a very complicated story obviously and I know people like that were affected
2694000	2695000	by this.
2695000	2699000	You know you get to know people on Twitter and social media and you've been to you know
2699000	2703000	the L.A. area enough times and do gaming events you start to meet people and so I know people
2703000	2707000	that were affected by this stuff and so it sucks and my heart really goes out to them.
2707000	2716000	There is a part of me that kind of like gets the business side of it purely because obviously
2716000	2720000	Activision Blizzard had Destiny 2 their partnership with Bungie.
2720000	2724000	Bungie took that away and they're putting it all in house which they had the right to
2724000	2728000	do and many people cheered that when it happened right.
2728000	2732000	But the unfortunate side effect of that is that you had people that were supporting Destiny
2732000	2736000	2 would be it and I'm not just talking about like development I'm talking about everything
2736000	2740000	that goes into the marketing the promotion running things at conventions running things
2740000	2743000	you know all this you know other stuff and privacy too.
2743000	2745000	And suddenly it's like well now what.
2745000	2749000	You know and they were left without something to do so that end on the business side it's
2749000	2752000	like I kind of like I get that.
2752000	2757000	I'm as horrible as that sounds I mean like I get but I'm not excusing it because there's
2757000	2762000	also a part of me that says but that's poor planning on the management's part that they
2762000	2768000	did not have what is what the next the next you know launch pattern the next big thing
2768000	2773000	the next thing we're working on that we will have these people work on in our plan development
2773000	2777000	it's almost kind of like this Bungie thing may not have been extremely known about or
2777000	2780000	planned out I don't know so that part is extremely disappointing.
2780000	2787000	But I think again and this is now several instances in the past few months where Activision
2787000	2792000	Blizzard very clearly has a messaging problem that you have very clearly outlined here is
2792000	2798000	that they've opened this call saying the numbers are and I get that they have to say that to
2798000	2804000	investors even if the fucking sky is falling you've got to get on there and be like investors
2804000	2806000	things are going to be great you know.
2806000	2809000	Well that's the problem though it's like you like as I mentioned last week you know how
2809000	2814000	you're going to keep growing like this you only have you're getting to the point where
2814000	2818000	like you saturated the market you're like I don't see how you're going to grow even more
2818000	2824000	even aside from just like microtransactions but like how much more can you possibly you're
2824000	2828000	eventually going to you know plateau out.
2828000	2832000	I just don't know what the ends I guess that's where cutting you know being more efficient
2832000	2836000	as a company also comes into play making more of that money.
2836000	2841000	And so here's what pisses me off about the whole thing and here's why I'm mad for those
2841000	2846000	people that lost their job so suddenly you know with you know and if you were a contractor
2846000	2851000	with literally like nothing you're just basically it's done that's it the end.
2851000	2856000	What pisses me off about it is that it's it's poor planning is part of the reason why this
2856000	2861000	is happening because you look at Activision Blizzard's 2019 calendar and it's kind of
2861000	2864000	they've got Warcraft 3 coming out of Blizzard.
2864000	2870000	Surely there'll be a new call of duty. I mean you've got the Warcraft vanilla
2870000	2874000	they're putting out all over again right. But it's kind of like you don't really see a lot of
2874000	2879000	exciting new things in 2019. So it's like where was the planning for that. My point is
2879000	2884000	where was the news about Bobby Kotick is going to take a hit in his salary or
2884000	2888000	the board's going to take a hit in their salary. Of course they don't. Of course. Of course not.
2888000	2893000	You know what. You know what. When it was Satoru Iwata at Nintendo when the Wii U
2893000	2898000	was failing he took a 50 percent pay cut. Remember that. Do you remember when he went on the
2898000	2902000	I'm taking a 50 percent pay cut because I let you all down. That is why we
2902000	2907000	respect Satoru Iwata and why we eulogize him the way we do. But this is also
2907000	2913000	dealing with a cultural thing as well. Fair. Where. And this is just I may be
2913000	2917000	off base but it's something I've noticed in general specifically with Japanese companies they are a huge entity.
2918000	2923000	And everybody's contributions to the company are considered first.
2923000	2928000	You know how does this affect everybody. You know we're here is all about greed it's
2928000	2933000	capitalism and it's worse. And you know I really do think that instead of
2933000	2938000	punishing the employees they start at the top and punish the executives.
2938000	2943000	The ones who have lost touch with their markets with their employees and with people in general
2944000	2949000	who only think of that bottom line you punish them first because they're the ones that are making
2949000	2953000	the decisions that are fucking it up for everybody else. Bobby Blackwell says
2953000	2958000	unfortunately Kotek taking a pay cut wouldn't save those jobs those people don't have work anymore but it could have gone
2958000	2963000	into enhance the severance package. It could have gone into. And here's the thing. It could have gone into
2963000	2968000	laying off fewer people. Right. And as much as you know here's the thing as much as I'm like
2968000	2973000	and you hope for this and you pray for this for the folks that were affected is that it's going to be
2973000	2978000	like a phoenix. You know what. You got devastated by this company but there'll be a new game
2978000	2983000	studio and something that builds from that. But at the same time when it comes to like making a game
2983000	2988000	you have to have investors in that game because you can't just like make a
2988000	2993000	game if you'd have nothing to live on and eat on. That's why Kickstarter was hugely
2993000	2998000	successful for a long time because it was a way to kind of like get your game invested when you were in your project.
2998000	3003000	Unfortunately too many of them failed or I think the public has lost trust in a big way in Kickstarter. Right.
3003000	3008000	But I feel like OK well couldn't Activision have used some of that money if they plan better
3008000	3013000	if their management to plan better to have more projects for these folks to work
3013000	3018000	on to have these. You know. Sure. Would it have been enough for everybody.
3018000	3023000	Maybe not but at least maybe we could have had something to look forward to
3023000	3028000	besides more this. Well that's the thing. That's the thing with Activision though they
3028000	3033000	do kind of tend to put their eggs in all in one basket because I mean aside from it's basically
3033000	3038000	the Blizzard side of the house kind of has their stuff diverse between your World of Warcraft and
3038000	3043000	Overwatch and then the Call of Duty or you know Activision just has Call of Duty
3043000	3048000	pretty much they put all of their eggs in Call of Duty. I mean granted this year they've got I was just checking their
3048000	3053000	site and like what the hell is even coming out from them because I know even just in the history of me dealing with them
3053000	3058000	they haven't had a lot of games release out throughout the year. So they've got was it that
3058000	3063000	Sekiro Shadows Die twice. So they have that game coming out which is kind of like a Dark Souls
3063000	3068000	game and then Crash Team Racing. But I mean granted those aren't going to be huge titles. So
3068000	3073000	it's I don't know. You know Questbuster does bring up an important point and it's worth mentioning here is that
3073000	3078000	answering a question from another analyst Activision noted that the job losses are from the SG&A
3078000	3083000	and non core parts of the business and that does seem to be kind of lining up with what we're hearing is
3083000	3088000	that it's like these losses weren't really coming from development or
3088000	3093000	programmers or artists. I mean I don't I don't know all the facts. Granted I'll be the first to
3093000	3098000	admit that you know I don't know if those teams were like zero impact but it does seem like the brunt was
3098000	3103000	in the distributing and this whole combination of the two Blizzard arms or was that we know that
3103000	3108000	the esports thing already was you had taken a hit. We know like support for Destiny 2
3108000	3113000	and so forth and marketing for this game that they pretty much are no longer involved with and so forth. It seems like
3113000	3118000	that is all the stuff that took a hit not the stuff that's actually going to develop the games in the future. But then
3118000	3123000	part of me goes well you've got to be looking down the road at what you're going
3123000	3128000	to be developing in the future that you're going to need support for. And if I'm somebody in the industry and I've
3128000	3133000	heard about how Activision kind of did this go round when they need those people in the future
3133000	3138000	I'm going to be thinking about that. I don't know. But then at the same time I know for a lot of people a job's a job
3138000	3143000	and you're going to go wherever you can get work. But it's a complicated issue.
3143000	3148000	How about this question that's coming up all the time. Would a union have fixed everything?
3148000	3153000	If they were just unionized couldn't the union have punched Bobby in the face
3153000	3158000	and said no you can't do it. No because I think this is completely different than like we're
3158000	3163000	talking about crunch time and laying off developers after crunch time type of thing. This
3163000	3168000	is more of other. This is just a different type of layoff scenario.
3168000	3173000	A union probably would have helped it be more of a coast as opposed to
3173000	3178000	a drop off the cliff. Does that make sense. I feel like that's what the union could have
3178000	3183000	negotiated for things like the severance things like the medical things like you know
3183000	3188000	the analyzing what is absolutely needed and what is you know so forth. And you're right.
3188000	3193000	And a lot of the stuff about and I'm not saying I'm not like anti-union for the game developers or anything. I think a lot
3193000	3198000	of good could come out of that when we talk about the working conditions and the other things that you brought up there. But
3198000	3203000	would a union have magically fixed this whole scenario and prevented it from happening. Probably not. No many
3203000	3208000	many companies that do have union employees do go through layoffs. It happens. But it's
3208000	3213000	just the way it happens may have been different. So anyhow at
3213000	3218000	the end of the day you know our thoughts go out to those that were affected by this. And again fingers crossed.
3218000	3223000	It is great and I'll try to end this segment on a happy note and we'll go on to the next story. It is really nice
3223000	3228000	to see the game developer and Jason you know all the people other people to make games
3228000	3233000	industry work too. It is nice to see everybody come together where it's like dang all at once it's like you see
3233000	3238000	hey look at this resume and hey we're hiring all these people and hey have you looked at our game
3238000	3243000	list and we would love to have some of the Activision Blizzard people come over here and it's like you definitely see a lot of that
3243000	3248000	support. You know even if it's not an official union game developers and the gaming community
3248000	3253000	that make the games are really looking out for each other and that that part is positive and I think a really
3253000	3258000	good thing even if people are feeling a little sour this week. I think to see all that
3258000	3263000	support out there from peers really probably means a lot at least they're getting some money.
3263000	3268000	It's not you know telltale games scenario where they just kind of
3268000	3273000	garbage. Yeah I was even worse. Yeah. Yeah for sure. Anyway
3273000	3278000	let's move on. I mean I know I know it's a lot of the news this week is kind
3278000	3283000	of centered around that but I do want to move on to another story talking about maybe another way that
3283000	3288000	Blizzard and Activision are making money and that is off the popularity of Overwatch
3288000	3293000	even though I've also seen some reports that like the Overwatch popularity
3293000	3298000	is kind of declining a little bit. Maybe that's just because the game's been out a couple of years. I mean in some ways
3298000	3303000	I kind of think. Now's the time. Lego Overwatch the game. Well
3303000	3308000	well maybe not that but Hasbro is doing things for Overwatch
3308000	3313000	besides just the Nerf gun. They are going to be doing a Monopoly branded or
3313000	3318000	a Monopoly Overwatch branded. There's Monopoly for everything. You can even make
3318000	3323000	your own Monopoly. We could have an O.L.R. Monopoly. I saw Pizza Monopoly the other day. I was like
3323000	3328000	huh. You can make Monopoly out of like literally anything. And
3328000	3333000	who buys all those. You know what's funny is like was it Boardwalk was
3333000	3338000	Pepperoni and like Baltic Avenue was like macaroni and cheese. I'm like that's not even pizza
3338000	3343000	that's mac and cheese. Tell that to John's incredibly mediocre pizza. I've seen mac and cheese on a pizza. It's
3343000	3348000	weird but I mean some of y'all know that's why it's Baltic. I like peanut butter pizza
3348000	3353000	too. I'm surprised the cheapest one wasn't pineapple as a joke to that which by the way I'm completely fine with
3353000	3358000	pineapple on pizza. Y'all need to stop hating but no one's forcing you to eat it. But
3358000	3363000	I like mayonnaise and eel on a pizza. You can enjoy that over there.
3363000	3368000	Anyway that I don't understand. Yes Monopoly. So
3368000	3373000	do you do you own a lottery. Do you own like branded Monopoly things. I have a few. I get
3373000	3378000	texted that Golden Girls one like at least once a month if not twice a month.
3378000	3383000	We have the Super Mario Brothers one. Yeah. And I think Dan has a
3383000	3388000	Mustang one. Have you ever played it. No it's more. It's just a collectible thing. I have a Monopoly
3388000	3393000	game. I don't need to buy another Monopoly game. And I have Monopoly. Well which
3393000	3398000	one's that. I remember the master system misprint. Oh God that's oh that's OK. That's
3398000	3403000	throwback. Yes. Mono polio. And I have a monopoly pinball.
3403000	3408000	There was a monopoly. I have the one stern did the newer one. There was a monopoly game show years ago too. But anyway
3408000	3413000	moving on. So there's not just the monopoly Overwatch which the
3413000	3418000	pieces for the players will be of course characters like Deva and Winston and so forth. But
3418000	3423000	there's also going to be six inch action figures for twenty three bucks. You get characters like
3423000	3428000	Lucio Reaper Sombra and Tracer. But there's also a fifty dollar Reinhardt figure
3428000	3433000	that comes with like a giant energy shield type of thing that you can kind of put in front of the character in
3433000	3438000	it. It does look really cool. Also there's some dual character packs. So for fifty bucks you can
3438000	3443000	get an Anna and Soldier 76 dual pack and you can also get a mercy and Farah
3443000	3448000	dual pack as well. So figures array and making money.
3448000	3453000	I saw Fortnite figures the other day too. Of course. There's like a Fortnite aisle at Target.
3453000	3458000	It's crazy. Yeah. Merch merch merch. Hey it's you know it's just like the movie industry.
3458000	3463000	That's like they don't just make money off the movies. They make money off the industry.
3463000	3468000	Yep. Spaceballs the toilet paper. Spaceballs the flamethrower.
3469000	3474000	Pixel Pacas in chat says but what about that Golden Girls cruise. Stay tuned
3474000	3479000	for the next episode of Shaking and Crying which yes there was a new episode of that this week.
3479000	3484000	DJ Roma S brings up Sailor Moon Monopoly. VG Realness says I have Golden Girls
3484000	3489000	Monopoly but have you ever played it or do you just own it to own it. Like I have to
3489000	3494000	I have to really take that approach of I need to stop for me. I'm not judging nobody else. But for me
3494000	3499000	because of all the crap we have this house. I just have to like do I really need this.
3499000	3504000	You have a perfectly unused calendar right here. Well look it's on the right month.
3504000	3509000	Oh I didn't even notice. I thought that was just a cover. How dare you. It's
3509000	3514000	it's the lamp behind you. Oh geez. Anyway no one can see it. I got to put it in front of Pikachu.
3514000	3519000	There you go. It was doing well. Now you're covering Pikachu. Ah whatever. Just because. All right.
3519000	3524000	He's like he's almost got the mean face on it. Anyway Fifth Dream
3524000	3529000	today in our chat says I have a seventy dollar Widowmaker action figure because Japan.
3529000	3534000	Well yeah I mean Hasbro is not the only one doing action figures. I mean there's there's pop because the pop
3534000	3539000	figures are everywhere for everything right. Then there's like a little tiny figures I've seen
3539000	3544000	at Target as well like Overwatch. There's lots of yeah they have also their own pop figure
3544000	3549000	type thing. It's not pop but it's target pop or whatever. I don't know. Yeah.
3549000	3554000	Knock knock off things. Yeah I get it. It's the same your mom's not going to know any
3554000	3559000	different when she buys it for you. Exactly. All right. Let's move on to another story.
3559000	3564000	Dark Sakura what do you have for us. Well it's not really so much a matter of the show itself
3564000	3569000	but what was going on behind closed doors are actually behind the scenes.
3569000	3574000	So that show I have never watched nor am interested in Black
3574000	3579000	Black Mirror. It's great. I still I don't. It's like the Twilight Zone but Internet.
3579000	3584000	I don't like going back and watching Twilight Zone either. Interesting. But anyway
3584000	3589000	they did that Black Mirror Bandersnatch where it's sort of like a choose your own adventure sort of thing.
3589000	3594000	So as you watch it you pick the direction that the story goes. Well
3594000	3599000	Netflix has saved all of that information. In fact there
3599000	3604000	was a general data protection regulation request that was filed by University College
3604000	3609000	London technology researcher named Michael Veal who wanted
3609000	3614000	to basically they revealed that Netflix kept track of every decision that was
3614000	3619000	made. So you know they've held onto it for a very long time and no telling when they're going to let it
3619000	3624000	go which in itself sounds like an episode of Black Mirror. Well basically
3624000	3629000	in response to that request Netflix did disclose that it used the individual's choices
3629000	3634000	so that they could figure out what segment of the story they were on which of course you know if you're going to leave the show and come back to it
3634000	3639000	as you can with Netflix then you can pick up on the decision that you last left up
3639000	3644000	the thought that left off on. Yeah I think that there is nothing really malicious
3644000	3649000	about it. It's more of just you know the function of Netflix. But think about
3649000	3654000	how this could be used. Well I don't know. I want to let Jamie finish and then I'll. Well at any
3654000	3659000	at any rate you know Netflix also though while they did say that they wanted to
3659000	3664000	hold onto the information to quote determine how to improve this model of storytelling
3664000	3669000	in the context of a show or movie and quote they really didn't say how long
3669000	3674000	we plan on holding on to that information. Well I mean if you haven't watched it which I
3674000	3679000	know you haven't. Jamie one of the early choices you make and I don't think this is a spoiler because I think it really
3679000	3684000	is just kind of like a test to see how this works. You make a very early choice about
3684000	3689000	which breakfast cereal do you want to eat. Do you want to eat like it was like Frosted Flakes or Fruit Loops some
3689000	3694000	type of generic names for those. I mean you get this bit like that. And so you pick which one you want.
3694000	3699000	And then I think like it later will come up like in a commercial or something while somebody's watching
3699000	3704000	TV. So like that's how your choice like impacts it later on. But it's like it's a practice one.
3704000	3709000	They keep that data to show who likes healthy cereals versus fruity cereal. That's it.
3709000	3714000	And tailor their advertisements and show you finished my thought for me. That's the type of thing that
3714000	3719000	I could see. Oh but they're getting this data with these choices and then it could potentially tailor advertisements.
3719000	3724000	Now what does this have to do with video games. The actual shitty person.
3724000	3729000	What does this have to do with video games is because you make a lot of choices in video games too.
3729000	3734000	And a lot of these online environment things you know we talk we see more and more like advertisement
3734000	3739000	in games like Street Fighter 5 and stuff. Controversially I mean how many video games do you think
3739000	3744000	might be listening to the types of choices you're making. Like maybe there's you want to fuck the
3744000	3749000	Turian or do you want the lizard alien showing which type
3749000	3754000	of personal ads are you going to see based on spiky cat bird aliens
3754000	3759000	or lizard folk based on your romance choices in Mass Effect. You may be a fan
3759000	3764000	of hot to full boyfriend based on based on your choices.
3764000	3769000	You may like killing people at a distance or up close and personal hot local Turian's
3769000	3774000	near you. You may be into calibrations. Some interesting comments in chat. Let's see.
3774000	3779000	Dark to see you in chat says Yeah I don't know if it's surprising. I mean don't they track that sort of thing to give you recommendations.
3779000	3784000	Sure. Netflix what attracts what you watch to do that act
3784000	3789000	deaf says but you don't get as a joke. I know. But then again it is an Internet based service
3789000	3794000	and if it's tied into other like say you're watching through the Internet like through your browser you
3794000	3799000	don't you don't think it still gathers browser data. And we all know if you sell it. We all know if this
3799000	3804000	company was Facebook they'd be using it for things you already have.
3804000	3809000	They you don't even need to be on Facebook for them to make a profile and track you. It's it's
3809000	3814000	well it's just the modern Internet anyway active says that you don't get ads and Netflix
3814000	3819000	you kind of do. You are right. But you get ads for an ad other shows to watch.
3819000	3824000	Here's what Jamie's eating. Take that off. They didn't pay for it. They didn't pay for that. Who wants one. What is it.
3824000	3829000	What even is it. These are butter soy sauce potato crisps. All right I'll try one. But give me.
3829000	3834000	Let me finish the story first. Stop trying to tempt me while I'm trying to do a show here. All right.
3834000	3839000	Now Bobby Blackwell if I think this is an interesting comment to Bobby Blackwell says I can tell you 100 percent for
3839000	3844000	sure that Borderlands 2 tracks everything you do because they wanted to hire me to maintain it.
3844000	3849000	They talk about exactly how many bullets you fire which ones hit where you fired
3849000	3854000	from et cetera. Some of that could be more just like trying to develop to me. I think that's also the
3854000	3859000	stat tracking in the game tracks all that. So yeah interesting
3859000	3864000	nonetheless though I tell you how quickly was it before he cheated immediately. But it was
3864000	3869000	very interesting like how many people probably watch that he punches horse. How many people probably watched
3869000	3874000	Bandersnatch without really thinking. And like ultimately is it going to be used for anything bad. Probably not.
3874000	3879000	But could they. Maybe. I know another
3879000	3884000	choice might tell him what type of music I like. That was another choice that was in the episode you watch the episode.
3884000	3889000	Who's I really. I started watching it. I got bored with it pretty fast
3889000	3894000	and I liked it was black. I like all the Black Mirror stuff but I just couldn't get into
3894000	3899000	it. It was the story just wasn't really kind of interesting enough for
3899000	3904000	me. Yeah. Bobby says I mean you have to make some terrible choices in Bandersnatch you really do. I don't want to ruin it but it gets
3904000	3909000	it gets dark. We'll just put it that way. Oh maybe I'll have to watch it again. All right. Yeah. All right. Anyway
3909000	3914000	let's move on. We'll talk about another story Loki.
3914000	3919000	So speaking of Fortnite of course you may remember that there was a few lawsuits
3919000	3924000	regarding the dance emotes in the game. Well apparently there's been some progress
3924000	3929000	regarding that. So Epic Games has already asked the court to dismiss the 2
3929000	3934000	Millie lawsuit because they said their Fortnite dance is different. So after
3934000	3939000	I guess about two months they said that the Millie dance in the game
3939000	3944000	is too short to be copyrighted.
3944000	3949000	And it's not the same as the swipe it dance in Fortnite
3949000	3954000	and along those lines as well. Apparently the
3954000	3959000	Carlton dance that was in there. Well here's an ironic twist.
3959000	3964000	Alfonso Ribeiro the court has decided that
3964000	3969000	he doesn't have ownership to that either. The NBC
3969000	3974000	does. Whoops. I thought that might happen in that case
3974000	3979000	because he was an employee of NBC doing that show and that show that he was on ends up
3979000	3984000	being property of NBC. So I kind of figured that's how that would go. It's not unusual
3984000	3989000	to be sued by anyone. So could NBC sue ABC
3989000	3994000	because he did it on Dancing with the Stars? I don't think well being
3994000	3999000	that I don't think they care to be it's an expression. I don't know. I think that the
3999000	4004000	lawsuit was kind of stupid anyways. But I mean other games have had emotes like this
4004000	4009000	before. It's like how I don't know. The courts have decided. Did Shakira
4009000	4014000	sue Blizzard for the hips don't lie dance. I don't think so.
4016000	4021000	There's been several games that have had Carlton like dance and it's just interesting he tried to get the
4021000	4026000	copyright now. That also I think kind of weakens the case. Yeah. How many years
4026000	4031000	ago was that on the air. Like if you felt that strongly about it maybe that's something you should have gone
4031000	4036000	for in the 90s at least you know. And actually when it was French
4036000	4041000	Prince of Bel-Air the 90s 90s 90s. Yeah definitely the 90s. All right.
4041000	4046000	Anyhow. Well does this mean the dances will show back up in
4046000	4051000	Fortnite you think or you think they're going to like never went away. What games took him out.
4051000	4056000	Some games took him out. Oh is that Forza. Forza took those out. Yeah but who needs fucking
4056000	4061000	emotes in. It's a fucking racing game. Like where are you going to see you doing an
4061000	4066000	emote in the goddamn game. If you would play said racing game you would know
4066000	4071000	that when you're on the little victory stand the one two three that's when you're thinking
4071000	4076000	Oh see that's the problem I never get in the top victory.
4077000	4082000	That explains it. Yes. Aha. Gotcha. All right. Moving on.
4082000	4087000	Let's talk about speaking of lawsuits. This is one that could have a ripple
4087000	4092000	effect of sorts. It has to do with Pokemon Go. It's a game we've talked about a few times on the show. I think everybody
4092000	4097000	here in studio plays that game. And I'm sure many of you do as well. You might remember when the game first came
4097000	4102000	out it was nuts. Tons of people were playing and sometimes they were playing in places
4102000	4107000	that maybe they should have been playing because some ingress player put a couch portal in there years ago.
4107000	4112000	And now all these Pokemon people are showing up because it's where the gyms. I thought it was because people
4112000	4117000	were dumb and didn't understand that like you don't have to be near the Pokemon to catch the
4117000	4122000	Pokemon. And so they were like wandering into like secured areas to get near a Pokemon
4122000	4127000	that they probably could have just touched on their screen. Well or
4127000	4132000	remember I had the one two three tracking like yeah when it first came out. And so like they thought they were close.
4132000	4137000	I mean there's there's some or they were using one of those sites that would show. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway
4137000	4142000	there's a million reasons why people would make some questionable decisions that whole thing. But anyway
4142000	4147000	what happened earlier this week is that some homeowners that had sued over Pokemon
4147000	4152000	go basically hit a proposed settlement for review from a California
4152000	4157000	federal judge. And assuming this gets the blessing which it seems like it would go that way
4157000	4162000	and Iantic will have to take on some additional responsibility for this whole thing.
4162000	4167000	So these are all lawsuits dating back to 2016 when the game first came out
4167000	4172000	from places like condos in Florida and so forth who complained that
4172000	4177000	hundreds of players would be there behaving like zombies walking around and bumping
4177000	4182000	into things. And although that's kind of you know I remember. Yeah it's
4182000	4187000	still like you know you're you are trespassing and especially in a place like Florida where there's a lot of like
4187000	4192000	there's like pokey stops in a lot of apartment complexes I see all the
4192000	4197000	time with fountains and stuff. So I mean I don't know I'd be pissed if
4197000	4202000	they took it out but you know. So anyway here are some things. Some put gyms there. Let's talk let's talk
4202000	4207000	about what Niantic is going to do. Well it's all a formula and it's all it all dates back to Ingress and
4207000	4212000	the portals going in in Ingress which in the beginning stages of
4212000	4217000	Ingress Google employees because Niantic was a Google subsidiary Google employees were essentially
4217000	4222000	screening which were good candidates and which weren't and they didn't always like really know
4222000	4227000	that's changed in the past couple of years to now it's a peer review it's a whole OPR
4227000	4232000	and the peer review. And I know this because I'm a part of it. I've seen a lot of them disappear both games.
4232000	4237000	Yeah. Well because more and more people are reporting stuff too. Like you know I have no problem
4237000	4242000	like if there is a portal that is it should not be there per the rules. It's something that is just completely
4242000	4247000	inaccessible or like there was one the other day I reported because it's it's a frickin poster
4247000	4252000	in somebody's apartment. It shouldn't be there. It's not it's not a camera. They have artwork in the Kaiser
4252000	4257000	medical offices. Right. But that is stationary. At least anybody can go in there. But technically
4257000	4262000	if it obstructs emergency services it shouldn't be there. There was one I saw that was in a
4262000	4267000	government building area that they have security guards and they don't like you going near it. And they finally
4267000	4272000	remove that pokey stop. I always try to get it from the sidewalk but I couldn't quite get it.
4272000	4277000	It was the unclean property thing over in Rancho.
4277000	4282000	Oh yeah. I used to like try to get I got it once in Ingress but like the security guards
4282000	4286000	like what the hell are you doing here. I'm like I'm just trying to get this and I show my phone and show that
4286000	4291000	and he's there. OK fine. But then like they just they really don't want you over there. Well OK.
4291000	4296000	So now what's going to happen here. So this is going to be kind of where things change with Niantic upon
4296000	4301000	complaints of nuisance or trespass and demands of the removal of a pokey stopper Jim the company
4301000	4306000	will make commercially reasonable efforts to resolve the complaint and communicate
4306000	4311000	a resolution within 15 days. That's the part that makes my head explode because Niantic
4311000	4316000	is so fucking slow at responding to these things that now they're basically going to be on the hook with this settlement.
4316000	4321000	So I don't know if they're going to have to staff a support team or what they're going to do. They're going to have to respond to this shit in 15 days.
4321000	4326000	And honestly there's a part of me that's like finally you
4326000	4331000	know like they need to have the fire to get lit especially with the amount of money
4331000	4336000	that Pokemon Go is supposedly bringing in like they should be having the support staff
4336000	4341000	by the way Niantic I don't want to sound tacky or anything but I think there's plenty
4341000	4346000	of very capable support staff type people looking for work right now because of what happened
4346000	4351000	this week. So you know Niantic has a full very
4351000	4356000	talented pool of folks to help them out to get these types of requests. Maybe it'll work out.
4356000	4361000	If you are an owner of a single family residence not
4361000	4366000	an apartment single family residence you have the right of removal within 40 meters
4366000	4371000	of your property can have the right of addition using the number one question I've seen
4371000	4376000	that joke is the number one thing on every Reddit post about this is like can I get one added and it's like
4376000	4381000	sure roll an Ingress account get to level 10 try to submit it. But at the same time
4381000	4386000	if again if I and I review portals at OPR and I'll tell you here's the number one thing I see
4386000	4391000	that I kick out. OK I get the little submissions for they're called little free libraries.
4391000	4396000	You've seen those right. Yes yes libraries are like take a book or leave a book behind and those types
4396000	4401000	of things. If they are in a park. Cool. If they're meta and they're at a library.
4401000	4406000	Cool. If they're I've seen one in a there's actually one in
4406000	4411000	the grocery store not far from here. That's that's fine as well. All that stuff is fine. But
4411000	4416000	when I see it in front of somebody's house on private property in a residential street in a private
4416000	4421000	neighborhood I always say no. And I say no it's on private property. So you
4421000	4426000	know and that's that's why in a big way I think Ingress people are doing the review
4426000	4431000	and not Pokemon Go players because if you open it up to Pokemon Go players all that stuff would get
4431000	4436000	added. Absolutely people wouldn't give a crap. They'd just be like a more stops more gems. But when you look at the more
4436000	4441000	PvP element Ingress and stuff like a it's a strategical nightmare
4441000	4446000	to have that stuff on people's private property because people in a game like that get
4446000	4451000	very possessive and fucking crazy control over things like that
4451000	4456000	right. So like it can add up to ugly scenarios. So like that just that type of stuff should not
4456000	4461000	be on private property. I am all for parks being loaded up trails
4461000	4466000	load them up with stops every everything that's like accessible and out there
4466000	4471000	load them up private property be it a business be it a government be it a house. No I don't think
4471000	4476000	that stuff should be there whatsoever. But that's my opinion. Anyway
4477000	4482000	let's see what else. Moving on to other bullet points. I'm also missing our chat because I brought up the bullet points. I haven't really been
4482000	4487000	checking the chat here. Oh Bobby says they just added a Pokestop near my house. It's at a playground
4487000	4492000	in an apartment complex. You didn't you also didn't have a lot of
4492000	4497000	stops in your area Bobby our members. So that's good that they're adding new stuff at least in your area.
4497000	4502000	That's that's great. Let's see. Act F says I have a Pokestop
4502000	4507000	in my house approved last month but it's a mural on the wall of the house
4507000	4512000	next to the street. It's it's tricky I would say in those situations
4512000	4517000	with a mural as long as like again if it's in a residential neighborhood I would tend to say no.
4517000	4522000	But if it's a mural like on a like downtown on a on a club or something
4522000	4527000	then I would say yes. Yeah it just depends. I just try to ask the question with everything in
4527000	4532000	OPR and I would hope everybody reviewing in there does this. If a Pokemon
4532000	4537000	raid happened there would it be disruptive. That's what I would a Pokemon raid be desired at this
4537000	4542000	location. That's usually the number one question I would ask. All right.
4542000	4547000	Anyhow some other bullet points on Niantic because I didn't mean to go on a tangent
4547000	4552000	but I do feel like having played both these games for a long time I I have a really pretty good
4552000	4557000	understanding about how a lot of that works. But anyway Niantic will maintain a database
4557000	4562000	of complaints in an attempt to avoid poor placement. So I'd almost
4562000	4567000	guarantee some type of geofencing is going to go in where you're not going to be able to submit new
4567000	4572000	portals in locations that have been geofenced off. I'm almost sure that's got to be a thing that's going to happen.
4572000	4577000	When Niantic system detects a raid of more than 10 players congregating
4577000	4582000	a warning message will appear on their screens reminding them to be courteous and respectful
4582000	4587000	of surroundings. That's interesting. Hooray another pop up I get to dismiss.
4587000	4592000	It's the type of thing that should be obvious but I understand why Niantic. It's like you're driving
4592000	4597000	you're there's weather. I have a notification of news Niantic wants to pass that liability
4597000	4602000	to you and they want to be able to say we warn them. That's that's what it's about. Honestly they should have the warnings
4602000	4607000	on there. They should keep these in the forward people's minds. Yeah and I don't this this one doesn't bother actually
4607000	4612000	honestly none of the none of these rules bother me except for I'm worried about the
4612000	4617000	geofencing and what that might do. I'm worried that that's going to get used for naughty
4617000	4622000	purposes that people are going to try to get that stuff enabled on like
4622000	4627000	again Ingress like PVP stuff. That's what I worry about and I don't want
4627000	4632000	to get ugly like that. I won't participate in that and I hope the other team doesn't either. Let's see.
4632000	4637000	What was the other one. Oh Niantic working with user reviewers and mapping services like Google
4637000	4642000	Maps to also mitigate any problems plus maintaining a mechanism so park authorities
4642000	4647000	can request a park's hours of operation be honored. That mechanic is in
4647000	4652000	Pokemon Go. It's not an Ingress though so I'd be curious how that's going to work. But in
4652000	4657000	Pokemon Go there's like certain gyms and stuff like you can't like if you try to tap it past a certain hour
4657000	4662000	it'll say this gym is closed. I don't think there's anything in our area like that but there are
4662000	4667000	like parks and other areas where they feel like you try to do a gym past seven o'clock and say this gym is closed.
4667000	4672000	Interesting. Yeah. And then lastly Niantic will have a independent firm
4672000	4677000	audit compliance with the obligations during a three year period just to make sure they're following the rules. So
4677000	4682000	I know it could be could be interesting to see the effects that have on Pokemon Go. But again I actually don't think any of it
4682000	4687000	is that bad. Like it may sound like some pokey stops are going to get removed and that part kind of sucks
4687000	4692000	but at the same time you know especially when Niantic has a third game coming down down the turnpike with
4692000	4697000	this Harry Potter thing you know we really need to have a place of locations
4697000	4702000	that is cool stuff but is also accessible by the public in mass
4702000	4707000	you know at times that it should be assessed. So I will never get over the
4707000	4712000	I'll never get over the that frickin portal they had out in the boonies. Do you remember this one that
4712000	4717000	was frickin googly eyes put on a tree and somehow that was a portal
4717000	4722000	slash pokey stop. And it was like it was like at grandma's house or something on the frickin tree
4722000	4727000	or they had a horse statue in someone's front yard. I remember that. Oh yeah
4727000	4732000	that one too. That was yeah. Yeah. And there was another one that was like and it was like a
4732000	4737000	it was like it was like in front of somebody's like trailer. And it was like not even like
4737000	4742000	you look in the perspective of the picture it's like some like frickin Home Depot statue that doesn't even come up to my knee
4742000	4747000	but the way the picture was taken it made it look like it was really big. And it was like not you know
4747000	4752000	again it was just somebody's somebody wanted something they could sit on top of and get
4752000	4757000	gear all day long because that's an advantage to have that. So anyway
4757000	4762000	interesting. I'm going to chat over at twitch TV slash vog
4762000	4767000	network bonds 006 says waiting for the news of a real life turf war in
4767000	4772000	Pokemon go Bobby Blackwell says that's an ingress thing. True. That's exactly that. There's actually
4772000	4777000	also another GPS game called Turf Wars that has got turned on too recently. It's been around
4777000	4782000	forever. But it's it's very like I think that game has been around since like 2012 and it kind of feels
4782000	4787000	like it. But it's interesting that you bring that up and there actually is a game called that
4787000	4792000	bonds 006 says we got a horse statue in New York City as a stop in
4792000	4797000	a park. It's good to have. That's fine. That's totally different. Yeah. But can you imagine like I think I know what you're
4797000	4802000	talking about. It was like somebody's U shaped drive. Oh right. And the horse that was it
4802000	4807000	turnpike all of their stops are removed. That was a controversial thing. Yes.
4807000	4812000	So what happened because you know the other team in ingress was using it as a farm right. Yeah.
4812000	4817000	And what happened is that my understanding is that in Pokemon go all these kids were out in the
4817000	4822000	street doing the whole like catching and the raid and stuff. And so somebody on our team was
4822000	4827000	over there and the neighborhood people were complaining our team about like what is why are all these
4827000	4831000	kids on the street like this is not safe this whole thing. And so our team was like well you know and they were kind of like you're
4832000	4837000	right. Like you're not supposed to have stuff in the medians. So they submitted stuff for removal and it got removed because Niantic
4837000	4842000	looked like yeah it's not supposed to be in the street and the other team got livid and they were like you're only doing this
4842000	4847000	because you can't win in it you know and they're just they're too tough about it and they think that it was only done to
4847000	4852000	push them back. But my understanding is that the whole thing was initiated because people when Pokemon go
4852000	4857000	is a huge thing. People actually were asking like why are all these people standing out in the middle of the street when I'm trying to like
4857000	4862000	drive into my house and all this stuff. So yeah I know it's not the other day. Yeah.
4862000	4867000	They're like oh what the hell. Yeah. No they added a couple more at the park there though. Oh
4867000	4872000	there's only for Pokemon. Well yeah Pokemon. There's only three at the park. A million of them. But like
4872000	4877000	yeah. Ingress is like probably 15. Anyway let's move on enough local politic.
4877000	4882000	But it's the interesting nature of juggling a network that functions both in your PVP game
4882000	4887000	and your PVE game. Honestly why do you think I partly quit. Oh no I get it.
4887000	4892000	I got completely tired of just all the stupidity. It's a fucking game. I'm I'm getting
4892000	4897000	to the point where I'm like I'm getting there. I'm getting to the point where I'm just kind of like I'm
4897000	4902000	starting to like fail to like see the point in this. Like I'm definitely getting
4902000	4907000	up where I'm like how do you defeat that which has no life. So I kind of like stop caring.
4907000	4912000	Yes. On one end I kind of like. How do you win something that has no intention of having a winner.
4912000	4917000	Right. Well that's why. But I do get into the in-person events. They do like those anomalies and things like that.
4917000	4922000	And that those do have winners. And I like those better. And then you actually get to see
4922000	4927000	people and be social and it's a lot more interesting. I hate competition honestly enough. I was just doing it because it was fun
4927000	4932000	for a bit. And then when it got competitive and there's like you know top secret
4932000	4937000	you know groups and everything I'm like that's a bit much. Yeah. When you when you have retired people that are driving around at three in the
4937000	4942000	morning in their van with like 20 people like just it's just not. There's
4942000	4947000	the James Bond element of doing stuff in secrecy in the planning. I actually kind of dug that. But it is
4947000	4952000	one of those things where it's like you're starting to kind of look at this and go but beyond the social part which is still cool.
4952000	4957000	What's the point. There's this thing called having a life. It's true. But it's I mean
4957000	4961000	it's OK. Jamie like if I want to just like I just want to get in the car and go for a drive and have my moment
4961000	4965000	is that I've been doing that a lot late at night lately where it's like I'm just going to go chill do something
4965000	4969000	take some portals in my neighborhood and like go on a drive just clear my head get out of the house and like that.
4969000	4974000	But that's my approach. Buying stuff. What I usually end up buying stuff. See this is I buy
4974000	4979000	gas but at least I drive a hybrid. All right. We need to move on though. Let's move on to another story.
4979000	4984000	Speaking about spending a lot of money on something right. Right. This game is common as fucking
4984000	4989000	dirt. Super Mario Brothers. Everyone has had multiple copies.
4989000	4994000	I'm sure even if you never have owned a Nintendo product you probably have had
4994000	4999000	a copy of Super Mario Brothers. I'm just saying. Well there is a particular
4999000	5005000	though one an unopened copy that originally released in 1985.
5005000	5010000	It's a particular sealed copy of Super Mario Brothers
5010000	5015000	that recently sold for one hundred thousand one hundred and fifty dollars.
5015000	5020000	It was bought by a group of collectors who
5020000	5025000	include some owners and chairmans of
5025000	5030000	like heritage auctions and just press play video games in Lancaster
5030000	5035000	P.A. and another video game collector. So basically
5035000	5040000	the whole thing about this particular one is it is a sticker sealed copy that was
5040000	5045000	only available in New York and Los Angeles. So we now have
5045000	5050000	you know one of the highest sales of a Nintendo game topping one hundred thousand dollars
5050000	5055000	which still I would like to sell my final fight guy
5055000	5060000	and my mighty final fight. I could get a couple grand for the two of them together.
5060000	5065000	So anyone got two grand and want to buy my games. You got to put them out there
5065000	5070000	though. I put them out. I give them I give them to listeners first listeners get first crack at them. Fair enough.
5070000	5075000	You got five hundred bucks. You can have a box Ninja Gaiden trilogy. Just saying
5075000	5080000	but one hundred thousand dollars. I mean I feel like recently we had that stadium events just went for like
5080000	5085000	was it like sixty thousand things. I remember that. But it seems like wow these the amounts of
5085000	5090000	these games are going way way up. Let's see here's here's the thing Dan and I were talking about this.
5090000	5095000	You know we just bought games that we liked. You know if they happen to have the box with it. Cool.
5095000	5100000	We got the box independently afterwards. Cool. We have the box. But now
5100000	5105000	the market is just getting stupid for classic games. It's kind of why we're not collecting
5105000	5110000	anymore. You know like every so often I'll go get something classic because it's fun
5110000	5115000	like for Dan's birthday. I got him two classic games. I got him the treasure box for PS2
5115000	5120000	which is basically Gunstar Heroes one of his favorite games. And I got him a
5120000	5125000	salamander deluxe pack. Thank you to Akuma J.P. Dan loves it. But you
5125000	5130000	know I got Dan you know a couple of amazing games that are fun for him
5130000	5135000	to play. You know if I can get my hands on a radiant silver gun and not break the bank that would be rad too.
5135000	5140000	But the fact is that these games are becoming so valuable the market is really
5140000	5145000	becoming just cutthroat lately and pinball is the same way.
5145000	5150000	Like a couple of our pins that we had in the past we wouldn't gotten more than a couple grand for them
5150000	5155000	and now we could easily get like five grand for some of them. It's absolutely ridiculous.
5157000	5162000	So just the gaming market itself has gotten kind of nuts.
5162000	5167000	But before you go crazy thinking you have a hundred thousand dollar copy of Super Mario Brothers in your house it is a very specific.
5167000	5172000	I mean they printed that game like 14 different times and I'm just talking about the original
5172000	5177000	like I think most people owned Super Mario Brothers in a combo pack with
5177000	5182000	Duck Hunt or maybe the world track meet as well. This is not that you know
5182000	5187000	this is the pre pack in sealed copy and it was only availed this particular
5187000	5192000	like first pressing was only available in New York and L.A. which was kind of like
5192000	5197000	the soft launch of the NES. Yeah. And looking at this one I mean it is
5197000	5202000	hold on let me see if I can get the image pulled up it's on CNET posted on Twitter.
5202000	5207000	But you never know what you might find at a garage sale or things like that because I know like I know the video
5207000	5212000	store by my house back in the day they I remember they rented a copy of stadium
5212000	5217000	events because that's how I knew about that game. So they had a copy of stadium events. Lord knows
5217000	5222000	whatever happened to that cartridge. Now I'd love to know. But for all I know they they got rid of it in like a mass
5222000	5227000	on loading to another store somewhere completely stupid. But I'm going to put the picture up on the feet on the feet. OK.
5227000	5232000	Do what you need to do. Can you see. Yeah. It's coming through a little bit. Yeah. That is
5232000	5237000	the copy. So it's it's it's a little picture for I mean I don't know how to
5237000	5242000	describe it for the podcast folks in the Twitter feed not the Twitter feed but it's there and I'll go to
5242000	5246000	repost it on my own Twitter. So there you go.
5246000	5251000	Quest buster points out. So now you have a lot of bad actors getting in on sealing their copies in
5251000	5256000	plastic and posting them on auction sites for 10 times the average price with a dubious
5256000	5261000	rating. Yeah. When I bought a copy of clue for the Super Nintendo
5261000	5266000	sealed at the farmer's market it had been resealed because when I opened it
5266000	5271000	like I didn't I didn't actually think I was getting like a sealed copy as I was coming. But you
5271000	5276000	notice the notes in the back of the manual had already been filled out. Yeah. So somebody like resealed it which I thought was a
5276000	5281000	little shady. No. Anyway. All right. Well
5281000	5286000	Dark Soccer sadly nothing worth one hundred thousand dollars in your collection. But girl some good stuff. Maybe
5286000	5290000	maybe maybe no seriously maybe you need to go through and audit it.
5290000	5295000	Well as probably what I'm going to do but I mean the thing is that what something is worth is what
5295000	5300000	you get for it. I mean in terms of finance financial true you know. But
5300000	5305000	now that I'm seeing you know when we first were thinking about like offloading our Ninja Gaiden trilogy it was
5305000	5310000	going for about three hundred and fifty in the box. I've seen auctions for that exceed
5310000	5315000	seven hundred and I'm asking five. So I mean if
5315000	5320000	if I get close to that that'll be great. It'll put me closer to drag con.
5320000	5325000	Excellent. All right. Well good luck. Well moving on we have a few more stories before we get to our classic
5325000	5330000	game of the week. Yes. So there's a little bit of mixed
5330000	5335000	messaging coming from Sony regarding their cross play enabling.
5335000	5340000	So Sony of course you know their official announcements was you know hey we're open for business
5340000	5345000	for cross play between PlayStation 4 and other consoles. Although devs that
5345000	5350000	have been inquiring into it seem to be getting a different message. So for example one
5350000	5355000	of those deaths would be the death for war group. They had comments
5355000	5360000	saying you just was not a music game. Right. No I was sad to find that out. I thought for sure I was like oh
5360000	5365000	very much like a like an advanced war. Yeah I guess we're saying yeah it's tactics.
5365000	5370000	So you know they said you just want to provide some balance on the issue and say it certainly isn't
5370000	5375000	a question of developers having not contacted their account managers or having dropped the ball.
5375000	5380000	We were told no. So basically you know they had run it up the
5380000	5385000	chain and were denied. It's they said you know it's time to stop playing favorites and
5385000	5390000	tear down the cross play progression wall for everyone. We have Smite Paladins
5390000	5395000	Realm Royale ready to go when you are. So
5395000	5400000	yeah it's kind of weird to see that you know they're sending out messages saying oh yeah it's really
5400000	5405000	it's these devs that are holding it back. We're cool with it now but no that's not the case.
5405000	5410000	So I think there may be a little bit more that they have to do. Maybe they're just not. I don't know
5410000	5415000	but it doesn't seem like we're getting the full story from Sony regarding this stuff. So if you're
5415000	5420000	wondering why your favorite game is a cross platform yet maybe Sony's fault. But I
5420000	5425000	think I didn't expect all this to happen in the next couple months anyway. I knew they were going to get the big ones like
5425000	5430000	Minecraft and Rocket League. I knew that would happen pretty quick. But as far as like other games it would be things that were
5430000	5435000	like starting development now that would be released like we would really start to see more cross play in like
5435000	5440000	2020. You know what I mean. Yeah. When those games start coming out. Yeah. All
5440000	5445000	right. Well one more story for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week and it has to do
5445000	5450000	with some classic soundtracks. If you're a Spotify user a I don't know how else to
5450000	5455000	describe this but a shit ton of soundtracks from Capcom games were added to
5455000	5460000	Spotify this week. So if you search for Capcom sound team you can find soundtracks
5460000	5465000	like Mega Man games although they might be listed as Rockman because obviously that was you know
5465000	5470000	gaming soundtracks were kind of bigger in Japan. So a lot of the Japanese names there but also like Street Fighter 5
5470000	5475000	soundtrack is there Devil May Cry Monster Hunter various soundtracks and so on.
5475000	5480000	I mean there's just a lot of stuff to listen to if you are a Capcom gaming fan on Spotify.
5480000	5485000	So I actually have the pay Spotify I use it a lot. Sadly I haven't explored
5485000	5490000	a lot of the Capcom stuff yet but they're getting up and up on the video game soundtracks on there. I got to say there's more
5490000	5495000	and more things to enjoy on there. I know a lot of Final Fantasy related things are there and other stuff as well.
5495000	5500000	And certainly I listened to the new Utada Hikaru selections from Kingdom Hearts 3
5500000	5504000	because she had put that out on Spotify so that was nice too.
5504000	5509000	ActDeft asking a related question. When are we getting OLR on Spotify? I'm hoping soon.
5509000	5514000	I still am in dire need to do a behind the scenes switcheroo on where we're hosting our files
5514000	5519000	and things like that. I actually really needed to do that like a couple months ago but I've been so focused on this whole Twitch move
5519000	5524000	thing and some other personal stuff. But I'm hoping soon. So I didn't want to
5524000	5529000	do the Spotify thing until that part's done and then we'll submit to Spotify after that.
5529000	5534000	But I think Bobby Blackwolf's up on there if you want to check that out. I'm sure there's lots of other great podcasts. Indie stuff on Spotify as well.
5534000	5539000	Alright. Anyhow. Let's get to the classic game
5539000	5544000	of the week where... Game? That's time for games.
5544000	5549000	Dark Soccer usually steps into the gaming vault every week to find a game that she thinks
5549000	5554000	hey we should check out this game this week. But once a month in a 2019 twist
5554000	5559000	she says you know what you should be checking out this soundtrack instead. So it's the classic
5559000	5564000	soundtrack of the month. 8-bit. Oh sorry 8-bit specifically.
5564000	5569000	What did you pick for us this week? I picked the soundtrack to Journey to Silius.
5569000	5574000	This is a deep cut. I like this. Which is not really a game that
5574000	5579000	I've enjoyed very much. It's okay. It was actually meant to be a Terminator game. But it was
5579000	5584000	released in Japan as a game called Rough World. And of course we got out here as Journey
5584000	5589000	to Silius. And I'm not going to go into the game because it could be a classic game and I don't want to shoot myself in the foot.
5589000	5594000	But the music itself is really what's remarkable about it.
5594000	5599000	The music was composed by Kodaka Naoki
5599000	5604000	along with four other composers and he used a really interesting approach
5604000	5609000	to the music. So the bass sounds were sampled
5609000	5614000	so and it gave a lot more detail to the music
5614000	5619000	and some of the songs were of course meant to resemble
5619000	5624000	Terminator music because at the time they were aiming for a Terminator license and they never got
5624000	5629000	it. I mean it came out in 1984. Yeah I think there's actually a little clip from a magazine where it was previewed as a
5629000	5634000	Terminator game in a magazine and obviously that's not what we got. Although there is a hack out
5634000	5639000	there where someone tried to redo it as a Terminator game. I mean it exists now. But
5639000	5644000	there's also a sound test that's hidden on the title screen that if you press the B button
5644000	5649000	33 times and then pressing start the sound test the screen will show up that gives
5649000	5654000	you also an option for a number of continues to play with. But the music
5654000	5659000	in here I just thought was really good. It was fairly unique. And I mean it is one of those
5659000	5664000	LJN games you know. And we know what LJN is good for.
5664000	5669000	Barf. I mean it was an OK game. It really was an OK
5669000	5674000	game. But the music is really what drives it for me. So we'll play some of this is like the
5674000	5679000	third stage music or like the home base music or something. But do we
5679000	5684000	want to. I can't I can't change the volume after that because it's in the video. But it should be strong enough in the background
5684000	5689000	for them to hear. But at any rate there you go. This is my chosen soundtrack
5689000	5694000	a soundtrack for February. Awesome. Good pick. And because when I wasn't
5694000	5699000	really thinking about the soundtrack this game but it certainly has a good story behind it and get this music
5699000	5704000	is very good. I mean this is just one year that base though. Yeah it's like stage
5704000	5709000	three or something. But yeah I mean a lot of music in this game is pretty good. So oh yeah this is one of the
5709000	5714000	soundtracks that I can just sit and listen all the way through. And like I said I don't really care for the game.
5714000	5719000	Music is amazing. Did you remember as points out this was a sunsoft title. Oh that's right sunsoft.
5719000	5724000	Still I was to say I thought. Yeah but a lot of sunsoft title had really strong music a lot of like
5724000	5729000	blaster master had a freaking phenomenal soundtrack. I don't know why I thought LJN. Yeah.
5729000	5734000	Oh because LJN got the terminator license. Ah that was it LJN got it.
5734000	5739000	And of course you know LJN everything they do. They did. All right. Well there it is. Yeah.
5739000	5744000	But just one other little thing about this one is that the
5744000	5749000	other sound producers for programming were Hara Nobuyuki
5749000	5754000	Seiya Shinichi and Moroto Naohisa. So there you go. All right.
5754000	5759000	Your classic soundtrack of the month Journey to Silius not the
5759000	5764000	Terminator. But it could have been. And honestly if it was we would have at least had a great game
5764000	5769000	soundtrack based on a movie. Right. All right. Awesome.
5769000	5774000	Well we're going to take a quick studio break here. And while we take a quick break in studio I want to
5774000	5779000	go to a little special segment I taped earlier doing a little play through on Tetris
5779000	5784000	99. So I thought we'd take a look at I'm sure a lot of you have played it at this point. But if you haven't
5784000	5789000	had a chance to play Tetris 99 we're going to take a look at it. And for those I'm listening on the podcast
5789000	5794000	feed I do do my very best to talk a lot through this. So it's about
5794000	5799000	six or seven minutes if you want to check it out or maybe you just want to skip ahead to when we come back here
5799000	5804000	on Orange Lounge Radio. But let me go ahead and kick it over to me earlier.
5806000	5811000	Hi there. It's Rob and we're on an in-studio break right now. So I thought
5811000	5816000	during the break tonight we could take a look at this game that a lot of people are talking about this week.
5816000	5821000	It's Tetris 99. It was announced as a surprise release during the Nintendo Direct
5821000	5826000	and it's available for people that have the Nintendo online subscription trying to sweeten
5826000	5831000	the pot a little bit outside of just the NES flicks and those types of things. So this is Tetris 99.
5831000	5836000	Again it's like a battle royale type of game but not a shooty shooty bang bang type of thing like
5836000	5841000	Fortnite or Apex Legends or what have you. Instead it's a puzzle game. It's Tetris.
5841000	5846000	I think a lot of you know what Tetris is. I think you've probably played Tetris before. It's only one of the most popular
5846000	5851000	video games of all time. So instead of 100 people it's 99 people but
5851000	5856000	close enough. Right. So this is it. I mean we're looking at it here in on
5856000	5861000	the screen and you know it's tracking my level. I played a little bit. So I'm level four right
5861000	5866000	now but it doesn't really tell you what your level is for. It just shows that you have a
5866000	5871000	level. And I notice that it does have my name for my Nintendo account. And right now my icon is
5871000	5876000	a little sprout. So I'm assuming that maybe like as I grow in level that icon will change as well.
5876000	5881000	And maybe that will affect who I get matched with. I don't know. I'm sure other
5881000	5886000	people there have figured out the science and all that but I haven't yet. Otherwise you really have some barebone
5886000	5891000	options here. You just have options where you can go in and do the settings. These are very standard
5891000	5896000	Tetris options. Do you want to use the hard drop which is where you can press up to actually drop the piece
5896000	5901000	really fast or not have that enabled. And then you can change your control type from a couple
5901000	5906000	different ideas here. I'm actually going to use the pro controller for playing this night.
5906000	5911000	I have a splatoon pro controller. So one of the handles is green. So it's funny on the video it ends
5911000	5916000	up being see through. But what can you do. So I just tend to use the standard stuff
5916000	5921000	and then otherwise the game does track your stats. It'll show you you know like how many different
5921000	5926000	types of lineups you've got and like what combos and how long you've been playing and so forth.
5926000	5931000	But it doesn't really show you a lot outside of that. It's pretty bare bones. So let's
5931000	5936000	go in and check out the actual Tetris 99 and play a quick game here so you guys can see
5936000	5941000	what it's about.
5941000	5946000	All right. So right now you can see it's actually matching
5946000	5951000	all these other people. That's what all those other windows are in the background here as it counts down. It's trying to
5951000	5956000	it'll give us about you know 100 seconds or so I'm assuming to actually find a match.
5956000	5961000	And here we go. It's going to get started here in a minute.
5961000	5966000	It's probably syncing everything up.
5966000	5971000	Hopefully I don't lose my online connection. There we go. Oh my God. All these people attacking me all at once.
5971000	5976000	You can. I'm using the left stick to control who I want to target.
5976000	5981000	But you can also use the right stick where I'm going to target these people attacking me. Screw
5981000	5986000	them. So let's see I'm going to try to hold bricks so you can hold bricks just like you could in the
5986000	5991000	other variants of Tetris including Tetris Effect and some other versions of the game you've probably played.
5991000	5996000	Now I'm not getting the greatest pieces in the world here.
5999000	6004000	And you'll see I kind of I walled myself in a little but maybe I can get myself
6004000	6009000	out. There we go. I'm getting there. Oh I hit the up button too easy.
6009000	6014000	And I accidentally dropped a piece too soon. And that is not going to be good.
6016000	6021000	That's one thing you've got to be careful with in the pro controller. Wow I'm usually not this messy. It's only because I'm recording it
6021000	6026000	that obviously this is a little bit of a nightmare right now. Let's see I want to get my bar in here to try
6026000	6031000	to. Now I'm just kind of in cleanup mode.
6031000	6036000	You can see that one person two people still have me targeted. So you can see those lines that are coming in right now which
6036000	6041000	I think has been a meme that's kind of been around online as you know
6041000	6046000	showing all these people targeting you and oh crap.
6048000	6053000	But you'll notice with the right stick you can actually choose what you want to do. Do you want to.
6053000	6058000	I did it again. I hit that button too easy. I think that's one of the problems using the control pro controller.
6059000	6064000	But anyway with the with the right stick you can kind of choose. Do you want to do
6065000	6070000	the people attacking you. I knocked somebody out. Do you want to do just random people. Do you want to do people that have the most
6070000	6075000	badges. Who is it that you want to target in your quest to be on top of the heap.
6075000	6080000	So right now it looks like I'm up to seventy four seventy three out of ninety eight people still in the match.
6081000	6086000	Not that 98 people were in the match. So one person must have a connection problem because usually you get ninety
6086000	6091000	nine. That's not too shabby considering I am playing really
6091000	6096000	sloppy here. And I do blame the pro controller and
6096000	6101000	how easy it is to hit the button as a part of that.
6102000	6107000	And I'm also just getting pieces I just don't like.
6109000	6113000	What a mess.
6114000	6119000	I'm sure I'm being made fun of in chat right now.
6122000	6127000	I you know why I knocked somebody else out. So
6127000	6132000	it's not going that bad. I think right now I'm kind of doing like
6132000	6137000	I feel like this is what you would call on a reality TV competition and under the radar type of
6137000	6142000	strategy. Like I'm doing OK. I'm keeping myself above water but I'm not doing well
6142000	6147000	enough where the other players are going to attack me because I'm pretty sure the most common
6147000	6152000	thing people probably set their R button to is attackers. They want to attack the people attacking them.
6152000	6157000	Well I'm not clearing a lot of lines not really attacking a lot of people. So
6157000	6162000	therefore I'm not getting a lot of B.S. coming in. Of course as I say that I'm getting targeted by
6162000	6167000	three people now. So far so good. We're in the top 50 and you'll notice the music kind of picks up
6167000	6172000	a little bit the further you get into the game. Oh I've got a big
6172000	6177000	mess coming in soon. All right. This might be where I need to try to
6177000	6182000	work myself down a little bit.
6183000	6188000	So I'm trying to work down right now so you can see just like in the Gameboy version of Tetris as other people.
6188000	6193000	Oh it went red as other people drop lines on you.
6193000	6198000	It starts to just fill up the screen.
6198000	6203000	Oh fuck. I hit the up button. That's going to kill me.
6203000	6208000	Yeah that took me out. Oh well. But you can see
6208000	6213000	so I ended up ranking 30th overall in that which isn't too shabby. I still leveled up
6213000	6218000	out of it. And you can see not only you know as the other people kind of finish where they
6218000	6223000	stand in the ranking but then you can kind of go up and down this list and you can actually see
6223000	6228000	there's somebody I KO'd. So I got you Dr. Z. And let's see I think there was a couple
6228000	6233000	others too. So Dimension D whoever that is. And then poor Ray
6233000	6238000	in 98th place. But hey at least it wasn't the bottom of the barrel because there were
6238000	6243000	99 people playing. So anyway if you haven't seen it yet there's a little bit of
6243000	6248000	what Tetris 99 looks like. Obviously you know I'm a big fan of Tetris Attack.
6248000	6253000	So or excuse me well I am a big fan of Tetris Attack but Tetris Effect
6253000	6258000	I've been a big fan of that and talking about that a lot on the show. So it's kind of interesting we have these
6258000	6263000	two big Tetris games but they're very very very different approaches. This is you know that kind
6263000	6268000	of battle royale multiplayer you know attacking each other deal which Tetris
6268000	6273000	Effect made a conscious decision to really not do any of that whatsoever.
6273000	6278000	Whereas Tetris Effect is really about kind of like you know the mode and the ambience and everything which
6278000	6283000	this is a very kind of bare bones version of Tetris. So anyway but I really enjoy it. I think
6283000	6288000	a lot of people are kind of picking this up and they're probably playing it for just you know a couple minutes at a time because that match
6288000	6293000	really didn't take that long. That's probably about five minutes most. I mean maybe if I did a little better and I
6293000	6298000	hadn't I hadn't kept sliding my thumb accidentally over to the up button which kept maybe
6298000	6303000	that's why in the options I should actually consider keeping that hard drop off and then maybe that wouldn't happen
6303000	6308000	to me so much. I don't know. But anyway I hope that this game just kind of continues to grow
6308000	6313000	and that some of the rumors about additional modes that are being data mined and things like that end up being true because I
6313000	6318000	think it'd be a lot of fun to keep playing for that multiplayer Tetris experience. So Tetris
6318000	6323000	Effect is more for that single player getting in the zone and then this is very much multiplayer
6323000	6328000	but it would be cool to have reasons why I'm leveling up and have the
6328000	6333000	ability to play with friends and do some more matchmaking like that kind of some of those more modes you see in
6333000	6338000	Fortnite. But you know for a game that you're getting essentially for free with a Nintendo Online
6338000	6343000	subscription you know to play things like Mario Kart Online and stuff it's really not that bad. So
6343000	6348000	there it is. A look at Tetris 99. So let's go back to tonight's episode
6348000	6353000	of Orange Lounge Radio in the studio. Thank you me.
6353000	6358000	It's me here in the studio and continuing on with tonight's Orange Lounge Radio. Hope you
6358000	6363000	enjoyed that little look at Tetris 99. That was the first time you'd actually seen that right Loki because you downloaded it but you haven't really played it right?
6363000	6368000	Yeah I haven't played it. What did you think? It looks fun. Yeah. Yeah. I'll probably play it. Darsakra you
6368000	6373000	didn't seem as keen on it. I hate competition. I really don't like competitive games and this
6373000	6378000	just doesn't sound at all interesting to me. If I'm going to play Tetris I want to fucking play Tetris
6378000	6383000	the way it was intended by my fucking self. Well and you know
6383000	6388000	and as I tried. Go ahead. I used to do Tetranet and but I was still
6388000	6393000	didn't get that overwhelming people are going to ruin my fucking game by playing
6393000	6398000	you know even when I play P.O.P.O. I play by myself. I'm just playing against the computer. Well and I think
6398000	6403000	you know and as I tried to kind of point out in the video I think that's why you kind of that's why this can coexist with Tetris
6403000	6408000	Effect because I think Tetris Effect is like that's your game because and to be fair
6408000	6413000	I actually I as much as I've enjoyed Tetris 99 is kind of like like a sideshow I think Tetris
6413000	6418000	Effect is still like that's the Tetris if I just was like I want to sit down and like play some Tetris I'm going to play Tetris
6418000	6423000	Effect because that's the one that's really going to immerse me in it and just kind of like but if I just want I need a
6423000	6428000	five minute distraction. I need something akin to a cell phone game as I play for a hot minute. Tetris
6428000	6433000	99 is really good at filling that void I think. Yeah. You know what though M.N. Ziba in our
6433000	6438000	chat is kind of with you DarkSakura M.N. Ziba says this is really fun to watch but I would never
6438000	6443000	be good enough to play. I'm sure I'm sure you'd be fine. You do better than poor Ray did in that video.
6443000	6448000	It's always inevitable like at least if you can get through like the first few blocks you're not going to be 19 98 and 99.
6448000	6453000	It's the same thing in Fortnite. I think there's people that try to be 100th place in Fortnite
6453000	6458000	or something because I feel like even when I played Fortnite I had no idea what the fuck I was doing. I still was able to get up
6458000	6463000	into like the 60s just by like running and hiding. Right. Because you have people like my son
6463000	6468000	playing the game. And so I mean like anybody can be him. Yeah. Right.
6469000	6474000	Let's see. And Bobby pointing out that we both used our own Twitch streaming set up to show Tetris
6474000	6479000	99. Yeah. Kind of funny. Something a little different. I was trying to figure out because obviously Jamie's
6479000	6484000	here in the studio tonight and we've been using the classic game of the week ever since we moved over to Twitch. We've
6484000	6489000	kind of been using that to sort of bridge between the two parts. And the other time Jamie
6489000	6494000	was here in studio we actually had that listener email that kind of helped us bridge the parts. But I
6494000	6499000	would like to in the future and just throwing this out there for all of you out there who are streamers on Twitch
6499000	6504000	or whatever else. We would love to get like 10 minute segments of you
6504000	6509000	featuring like a game like in your backlog especially indie games other current games
6509000	6514000	like just talking about like why you enjoy it. Obviously we would prefer you don't do like retro stuff
6514000	6519000	because Jamie's already doing a classic game of the week. But we would love to see like maybe you know indie stuff or
6519000	6523000	just stuff that maybe you want more people to hear about. If you just want to do like a little 10 minute segment
6523000	6527000	like I think we're going to be looking to put more things like that in our break space.
6527000	6532000	But if we don't get a lot of submissions then I'll start to attack my steam backlog and play other random
6532000	6537000	stuff. We'll see. We'll try to fill that in with other fun stuff. But all right.
6537000	6542000	Anyhow let's move on. We've got some more news to get into in a segment called
6542000	6547000	Rapid Fire News. So I think Loki start us off. Yep. There's a game
6547000	6552000	that's coming out pretty soon in April called Dangerous Driving.
6552000	6557000	Now Dangerous Driving is a game by Three Fields Entertainment who did
6558000	6563000	Danger Zone and Danger Zone 2. You may remember those as kind of burnout
6563000	6568000	esque. It's I think it's actually the old team that did the burnout series
6568000	6573000	and so the danger zone is more like the crash mode in those.
6573000	6578000	Whereas Dangerous Driving is like the traditional burnout type game.
6578000	6583000	And so it's actually going to be. They
6583000	6588000	said that they had a preview of it that was unlockable at the end of Danger Zone 2 that you could
6588000	6593000	actually drive in there. And I got to say by watching the trailer.
6593000	6598000	Yeah it's just straight up copying burnout. I mean it's yeah
6598000	6603000	it's like almost like burnout take down all over again. So dangerous because I
6603000	6608000	missed those games. Yeah. Dangerous driving is going to be available digitally for 30 bucks on April 9th.
6608000	6613000	And then they're also doing a physical version for consoles with it comes with danger zone 2
6613000	6618000	for thirty nine ninety nine. I really if the theme song is not danger zone
6618000	6623000	I'm going to be very upset. I don't. Well danger zone was it's a different game and
6623000	6628000	I don't think they had danger zone that could be the theme song everything. But I do love the name dangerous
6628000	6633000	driving dangerous driving dangerous. And then of course
6633000	6638000	Microsoft is pushing out an update for their
6638000	6643000	solitaire games which you know they've been like like solitaire is on every every computer. Yes.
6643000	6648000	So Klondike spider freestyle pyramid and tri peaks all of
6648000	6653000	those are getting a leveling system so you can actually
6653000	6658000	level up in the game by playing more of the game. So
6658000	6663000	neat. That's kind of odd. What would you do
6663000	6668000	for a Klondike level. Because Klondike saw forget it. Yeah
6668000	6673000	I got it. It just wasn't funny there. But you're going
6673000	6678000	to get experience points and rewards and it's also meant to track your progress and grab new badges and stuff
6678000	6683000	to go along with it. And if I remember correctly I think these are free anyways. They come with it's
6683000	6688000	like it's like the quintessential windows thing that's on every computer. Yeah.
6688000	6693000	All right. I'm not playing it so I've I've peaked at solitaire
6693000	6698000	a couple of times. I think I looked at some of those Microsoft like Windows 10 games because they had achievements in them
6698000	6703000	and I was like what easy achievements can I get on like word a minute. And I know there's
6703000	6708000	there's a few free things in my sweeper. Yeah mine sweeper has achievements and stuff. So I was like what
6708000	6713000	easy achievements can I get. And I've gotten a few like low hanging fruit achievement points on games like this. And I'm sure
6713000	6718000	this whole RPG solitaire leveling up in solitaire is going to add more easy
6718000	6723000	achievements and things to you know just inflate your EP which is what it's all about at the end of the day.
6723000	6728000	Right. Right. Exactly. Anyway we've been talking tonight about some battle royale
6728000	6733000	games and of course now in 2019 you can't talk battle royale without mentioning
6733000	6738000	apex legends because that has really taken over. But some data miners
6738000	6743000	finding that perhaps there are some new modes that will be coming to apex legends.
6743000	6748000	This is a fortnight data miner who turned their sights on apex legends who found references in the
6748000	6753000	code to a solo mode and two man squad mode because right now
6753000	6758000	apex legends part of what makes it a little different is that it's a three person. Yeah you play in squads
6758000	6763000	of three and that's actually part of the reason why I've been a little hesitant to play it because I don't know what the frick I'm doing
6763000	6768000	and like the tutorial only gets you so far. You don't really get to practice in an environment with people.
6768000	6773000	So I'm a little nervous about getting in there with like real people. But I guess my understanding is there's
6773000	6778000	a lot of idiots that get in there and don't know what they're doing. So
6778000	6783000	maybe I'll be OK. I don't know. But I would love if there was like a solo mode that I could kind of poke around
6783000	6788000	in first. I'm not opposed to playing on teams. I just want to know what the fuck I'm doing before I do it. I feel like
6788000	6793000	the tutorial wallets kind of good is not good enough for
6793000	6798000	me. And then one other little tidbit about Tekken 7 which is a game I
6798000	6803000	still need to pick up. I really do. Dark soccer. You were kind of into Tekken 7 though right. Didn't you know.
6803000	6808000	Oh I thought you were checking out the new one. I got you confused somebody else. Anyway I'll be honest. The last one I
6808000	6813000	really enjoyed was Tekken 4. OK. Yeah. Well I think I honestly think a lot of people are kind of with you
6813000	6818000	like the early Tekken games like they haven't played one in a while but I heard this new one's good like Tekken 7
6818000	6823000	is pretty good. It's a good place to pick up. Well some new DLC characters are coming out on February 28th
6823000	6828000	including Julia and the very
6828000	6833000	hyped Walking Dead crossover Negan is coming to Tekken and that is on February
6833000	6838000	28th. So not too far away from that. I did want to do the whole Geese Howard thing
6838000	6843000	because that was pretty fun. Yeah. You know because Dan and I just would went on this
6843000	6848000	rampage just watching all things Geese Howard. It was pretty funny. I didn't know there was that
6848000	6853000	much Geese Howard stuff to watch. But then again you know I got that.
6853000	6858000	I thought I said this to you too Jamie. I don't know if you ever installed it or what but Twitch was given away a bunch
6858000	6863000	of old SNK games or something at one point and he had them all. I figured that was going to happen.
6863000	6868000	But I was like well if anybody is going to like this Jamie will. But you can play like Fatal Fury Special which is
6868000	6873000	awesome. So I also have several copies of Fatal Fury
6873000	6878000	Special. That's cool. And I think it's either Fatal Fury
6878000	6883000	Special or Fatal Fury 2 that I actually have on Neo Geo. Yeah. That was like my favorite like Street Fighter
6883000	6888000	knockoff. Well besides I guess Mortal Kombat. But you know how SNK had a ton of those fighter games. That was my favorite
6888000	6893000	was Fatal Fury. Anyway Darcigro what do you have for us for rapid fire news. Oh
6893000	6897000	well I am not a fan at all of VR.
6897000	6902000	There are people out there who are Five Nights at Freddy's is going to be doing a VR
6902000	6907000	that lets you repair the animatronics. So I'm sure that there will
6907000	6912000	be people out there who will enjoy being a repair person and playing it in VR while
6912000	6917000	you know potentially being murdered by the said things that you're repairing. But it is
6917000	6922000	it's called Five Nights at Freddy's VR help wanted only right now
6922000	6927000	listen for PS4 but they're expecting other outlets and it should be out in 2019
6927000	6932000	sometime. Hey look it's a game you can play Rob. I will not be live
6932000	6937000	streaming this game. Oh that's OK. I will never play it. Why would you want to
6937000	6942000	repair them. Leave them broken. Don't repair the demons
6942000	6947000	and another VR game is
6947000	6952000	and honestly I'm not like super excited about harmonics anymore but harmonics has
6952000	6957000	announced a game called Otica that's a VR rhythm
6957000	6962000	shooter and it looks like you basically just pick different targets and you shoot
6962000	6967000	at them with your virtual move gun dildos. So
6967000	6972000	and I guess it changes the notes or changes the music around. So I
6972000	6977000	don't get why they couldn't have just done this with a controller but well
6977000	6982000	VR. I hate VR. But to be OK. You but you have
6982000	6987000	and this is understandable but you have physical challenges to yours that it's
6987000	6992000	annoying. Why. I just never have enjoyed it. I
6992000	6997000	hate to say I think you're tainted because you had that one game that I like to gamer X
6997000	7002000	but you have the physical limitations and I think of course and that's understandable
7002000	7007000	but I don't like having to wear something on my head to immerse myself in a game but that it's
7007000	7012000	not going to be that way forever. I would rather have the holodeck. I would be happy with that.
7012000	7017000	I don't like having to wear this heavy painful thing on my head to immerse myself
7017000	7022000	in something when the sensation of having it on my head takes me out of the immersion immediately. Well what
7022000	7027000	about since you brought up hollow what about like something like hollow lens which is more like glasses and it's not like
7027000	7032000	a heavy component on the head or whatever. I can still I'd still be able
7032000	7037000	to not be immersed. It's just on top of that too. I mean it's just
7037000	7042000	also very overstimulating. I really do not enjoy it. The only reason I like that one game
7042000	7047000	that I played is because the color palette was so limited in it that it really didn't hurt my eyes too
7047000	7052000	much to play it. And but I still felt out of the environment
7052000	7057000	I could still hear everybody around me. I could still feel everything around me. And the difference
7057000	7062000	between the two is really unsettling for me. So I hate VR. I really hate VR.
7062000	7067000	And if other people like it good for them. I hope you guys enjoy these games.
7067000	7072000	But I mean certainly not me. I think something like well talking about like why
7072000	7077000	can't the games exist on a monitor. I think a lot of people have been asked that question about something like beat saver like
7077000	7082000	why can't that exist in a monitor space. But I know there's a lot to do with
7082000	7087000	not just about like hitting the note on a line but it's
7087000	7092000	kind of part of like the depth perception and that kind of plays into the actual mechanic of the game
7092000	7097000	and the finesse of following through the moves and so forth. Honestly it's very obvious that these games are invented by people
7097000	7102000	who have no concept of what autistic people live with. So I'm completely
7102000	7107000	I would hate to find a study that shows that perhaps there are those types of folks that work on
7107000	7112000	these games because that would be contradicting a bit. Except that
7112000	7117000	a lot of problems that we have also have to do with depth perception and
7117000	7122000	overstimulation. And a lot of these are highly bright light with
7122000	7127000	no way to get away from it unless you take the thing off your head and leave the game.
7127000	7132000	And I really I can't see how any of this would be friendly
7132000	7137000	to autistic people. I'll be curious to see if anybody's possibly done a study on that.
7137000	7142000	All right. Well let's move on. We want to travel around the world and check out some release dates and check out some
7142000	7147000	games that are coming out soon to a console near you. Starting
7147000	7152000	off with the US. So we have 8 bit adventure Steins Gate coming out on
7152000	7157000	the Switch. Death and Request on PlayStation 4.
7157000	7162000	Steins Gate Elite on PC, Switch, and PlayStation 4.
7162000	7167000	And yet another Steins Gate game. Steins Gate Linear Bounded Phenogram on
7167000	7172000	PC and PlayStation 4. And then we've got
7172000	7177000	Aragami Shadow Edition on the Nintendo Switch. And Phoenix Wright Ace
7177000	7182000	Attorney Trilogy on the Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. And oh my
7182000	7187000	god we're already here. Anthem coming out on PC, PlayStation
7187000	7192000	4, and Xbox One. It's like it just snuck up on
7192000	7197000	us. Hopefully it doesn't suck. I'll just let that moment of silence speak for itself.
7197000	7202000	That's it. Oh okay. Traveling to Japan and checking out the release
7202000	7207000	dates over there. Starting off with the PlayStation 4 on the 21st of February. We have
7207000	7212000	Gaikuten Saiban 123 Noruhodo Selection.
7212000	7217000	That's Phoenix Wright. Oh is it? Oh. So it must be, oh so they're putting the
7217000	7222000	Phoenix Wright games on PS4. Right I just said the Phoenix Wright trilogy's coming out.
7222000	7227000	Got it. Okay. Makes sense. Sorry. Alright. Cool. Also coming out.
7227000	7232000	Taekano Gaito Daki Shimete in regular and limited edition.
7232000	7236000	That's from Entergram so I don't think that's anything that they have over here.
7236000	7241000	Also NG is coming out from Experience Inc. And a re-release
7241000	7246000	I believe of Nier Automata because it's a game of the Yorha edition.
7246000	7251000	I think that they're using like Nier speak for that stuff. That is coming out as well. And I like the name of this
7251000	7256000	game. Daito Shoukan no Hitsuji Kai. Library
7256000	7261000	party comes out in regular and limited edition. It makes me think of that. What was that
7261000	7266000	horrible show? The show on MTV. The Quiet Library. Which I'm sure
7266000	7271000	had to have been ripped off another country's television station or something. It was awesome.
7271000	7276000	It couldn't have been a concept that they came up with here. Quickly looking at the Switch. That same Phoenix
7276000	7281000	Wright collection is also making its way to the Switch in Japan this week. And a game
7281000	7286000	called Girls und Panzer Dream Tank Match DX in a regular
7286000	7291000	and special box edition. I bet that's an awesome box art. We'll just leave it at that.
7291000	7296000	It's probably tank girls. Like they're literally tanks. Because I've seen the ones where they're literally
7296000	7301000	jets. Yeah. So why not? Why not? Well why not? We love
7301000	7306000	the Guardian legend and that started Jet Girl. So why not?
7306000	7311000	We did get the Guardian before Jamie Hewlett gave us Jet Girl.
7311000	7316000	Alright. Moving on to Europe though. Darsagra. So for European releases we
7316000	7321000	have. Let's see. On the. Is it.
7321000	7326000	Okay. On tomorrow the 18th. Which is already. Oh it's nevermind. It's a pre-order. Whatever.
7326000	7331000	For Steins Gate Elite. God these are. Okay.
7331000	7336000	On the 21st we have Aragami Shadow Edition. The Game That
7336000	7341000	Shall Not Be Mentioned. Also on the 21st. Dirt Rally 2.0 Deluxe Edition.
7341000	7346000	8-Bit Invaders out on February 25th.
7346000	7351000	And let me see if I've got any. Oh that's next week so nevermind.
7351000	7356000	I'm not going to talk about The Game That Shall Not Be Mentioned.
7357000	7362000	I hope it fails. Yeah I have some thoughts and feelings. But we'll move
7362000	7367000	on. We'll move on to your thoughts and feelings in our mailbag segment because every week you guys send us emails.
7367000	7372000	Participate at OrangeLaundryRadio.com is the place to send us an email which I just realized I left out
7372000	7377000	of the little sidebar. But oops that happens. But I'll say it again. Participate at OrangeLaundryRadio.com
7377000	7382000	and I think we have. I mean we're on episode 764 so I mean really like. We did change
7382000	7387000	it like 500 episodes in though. Because we were getting the invitation to spam. Okay well I'm sorry
7387000	7392000	that you've only known about it for you know like a few years now. All right. Sorry.
7392000	7397000	Regardless. Dark Soccer you're here. I think I think they showed you mercy tonight and only sent one
7397000	7402000	email. It's a big one though. All right. Well it's somebody I enjoy hearing from though. Yes.
7402000	7407000	Hey OLR crew. AZHP here. I have been really behind on podcasts. Me too.
7407000	7412000	And as a result every time I hear something on the show I want to write about I think
7412000	7417000	they've probably forgotten they've said that already. I guess I won't bother writing in. Well this topic
7417000	7422000	is no different but it was so important I felt compelled to write anyway.
7422000	7427000	A few weeks ago you mentioned that a Chrono Cross concert would be held for its 20th anniversary in Japan.
7427000	7432000	Initially brushed that off as ha too bad it's in Japan. Then I realized I had bought my wife
7432000	7437000	and okay it's not my wife and I it's my wife and me or myself.
7437000	7442000	That would be grammatically correct. Tickets to Japan. You don't say I would buy I bought I stuff.
7442000	7447000	You say I bought me stuff. Just saying. Tickets to Japan for not one week
7447000	7452000	not one week ago owing to the fact that nonstop flights were 655 from SFO
7452000	7457000	to ANA. An unbelievably low price for that airline from that airport.
7458000	7463000	We were scheduled to be there for two weeks in November and so I checked hoping against hope that the tour
7463000	7468000	would be there when we were. The dates line up and I am going to be hitting F5 on that page
7468000	7473000	for several months until the ticket sale date is announced. So thank you so much OLR you let me know
7473000	7478000	about an amazing event for a game that was super important to my childhood. One with the best soundtracks
7478000	7483000	in gaming history. And besides that you know it's not me if I don't do grammar corrections please don't
7483000	7488000	take it personally blah blah blah blah blah. Okay. Speaking of Chrono Cross in this music a new free to play game
7488000	7493000	came out on phones in America recently called Another Eden the cat beyond time and space and yes I know about it
7493000	7498000	and yes the music is good. It is. I haven't started it yet but I listened to some from the game.
7498000	7503000	Sorry what was it called. It's called Another Eden the cat beyond time and space. I don't know that one.
7503000	7508000	I'll check it out. It was not only written by the writer for Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross but the main
7508000	7513000	theme is composed by the composer for Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross. The game
7513000	7518000	is thematically very similar to Chrono Trigger and the music is like a love letter to Chrono Cross
7518000	7523000	with the instrument selection and keys the songs closely mirroring that of many songs in Chrono Cross.
7523000	7528000	The art is gorgeous as well and the writing is some of the best writing I've seen in a JRPG
7528000	7533000	bone gamer no random side quests which in any other game would have been a crummy
7533000	7538000	thrown together story or rich and compelling in Another Eden. The gameplay is traditional
7538000	7543000	turn based JRPG fare which and mostly
7543000	7548000	in service of delivering the story which you have no complaints about and most importantly the game
7548000	7553000	despite being free to play has no paywalls. All of the amazing story can be completed
7553000	7558000	with the default characters in the game although you can buy loot boxes if you so choose to obtain stronger
7558000	7563000	units. From what I have heard they are only necessary for clearing end game content
7563000	7568000	which has no story in it and there are no timers or limited events or
7568000	7573000	anything else to distract from the experience or make you pull out your wallet. I will admit that I
7573000	7578000	paid $24 for a one time guaranteed 5 star unit that they were selling as a launch promotion which
7578000	7583000	I feel is a fitting price to pay for this game.
7583000	7588000	There's nothing wrong with tipping a little coin in if you enjoy the game. Support the developers. It's your money your decision.
7588000	7593000	Yep. You don't have to justify it to anybody. No guilt no shame. I honestly think that
7593000	7598000	this game was a passion project for the developers and most likely the only way they were able to get the game
7598000	7603000	greenlit in this day and age was to design it as a free to play game. By the way one thing
7603000	7608000	Rob. Frog is in the game. Oh weird. OK. Yeah. That's kind of nice. As his
7608000	7613000	original name which right now my brain was Glenn Glenn. Yeah I think he's in there as Glenn. Well
7613000	7618000	unless that was a translation thing. But I believe in the US version was Glenn.
7618000	7623000	Let me get back. Design is a free to play game. OK. Because that was the name of my ex. That's how I
7623000	7628000	know that. Well we don't talk about those things do we. It was a long time ago.
7628000	7633000	You know what. Sometimes exes are like ill fitting underwear. You just have to throw them away.
7634000	7639000	As much as game as much as gamer opinion is negative about free to play mobile
7639000	7644000	games like this. When the quality is this high I'm glad that the model exists to bring quality content like this
7644000	7649000	to the market. Game has been out for two years in Japan and appears profitable
7649000	7654000	has won game awards for innovation and creativity. I'm looking forward to experiencing this for myself
7654000	7659000	and recommend any fan of Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross. Sorry for the lengthy email. I just got so excited
7659000	7664000	thinking about Chrono Cross and had to write in and ramble about it. Oh no am I getting old now.
7664000	7669000	Yours truly is HP. We all are. Do not even.
7669000	7674000	Or as dark soccer might say in another time and place girl.
7676000	7681000	Oh my levels of girl now have been elaborate.
7682000	7687000	I will leave it at that. Especially watching the in a drag race.
7688000	7693000	All right. But we can't talk about drag race now because we did get an email this week. So I'll have to save it for another week.
7693000	7699000	It's done. But there it is. That's it for the emails tonight. Participate at orange launch radio dot com is the place to send your email.
7699000	7704000	And we would love to hear from you in a future week. In the meantime let's go to Loki
7704000	7709000	with our next story. Yes. So they're doing some updates.
7709000	7714000	Well Red Dead Online they've basically got
7714000	7719000	some news that they're going to do the fight griefing in the game. So I haven't really
7719000	7724000	actually got a chance to I don't know like honestly read that online
7724000	7729000	seems very boring to me versus like say Grand Theft Auto online where you actually have well they've been adding
7729000	7734000	like go carts and or not go carts RC carts into the game instead of you know
7734000	7739000	stuff. But what can you really do with horses except unicorns. And so actually
7739000	7744000	you know what I take that back. You know what they could do is they could do the whole undead nightmare stuff because that's you can eat horse.
7746000	7751000	Yeah I think you could do that in the original game too. But don't you want it. You don't want to eat zombie horse because then you
7751000	7757000	would turn into a zombie right. You don't eat zombie into a zombie horse. Well
7757000	7762000	some turn into a zombie centaur. So they're doing some
7762000	7767000	rebalancing of the weapons in the game as well. So this update is coming out on February
7767000	7772000	26 and it's supposed to add new daily challenges to the game.
7772000	7777000	On top of that they're working on some of the griefing that's in there.
7777000	7782000	But really like what is there to actually do in there. They're saying minimize certain destructive player behaviors.
7784000	7789000	So I guess well they don't want to tell you what they're doing is they don't want you to go do them before they fix them. That's what's that's
7789000	7794000	why they're not being very descriptive on what players are doing to grieve each other.
7794000	7799000	Yeah. So the basically the system the way to describe it is kind of like Grand Theft Auto lines
7799000	7804000	mental state mechanics. So the way that worked was like if you
7804000	7809000	were an asshole online and several infractions
7809000	7814000	would put you in with the asshole pool. And so you only got to play with the
7814000	7819000	assholes for a few weeks. So like if you were a cheater in the
7819000	7824000	game you have put in with all the other cheaters and you had to play with them. It's like OK you you're in your own playground
7824000	7829000	with those assholes. So now they're going to do something similar that in
7829000	7834000	Red Dead Online they're also going to be doing bounty hunting as
7834000	7839000	well. So that apparently if you're overly aggressive and break the law often
7839000	7844000	you'll have a bounty put on your head which is I think also similar to Grand Theft Auto. I know they
7844000	7849000	have a bounty system you could do with that as well. Yeah.
7849000	7854000	And some new weapons. I don't know. This isn't really getting me to jump into the game.
7854000	7859000	Well Fantas in our chat at VOG Network on Twitch said I just bought Red Dead Redemption 2
7859000	7864000	went on sale finally. So you know well you are a single player game here is really
7864000	7869000	good. I still haven't played through the whole thing because it's just there's a little too much survival in it
7869000	7874000	for my taste. But I do need to go back. I never really finished Red Dead Redemption you wanted death.
7875000	7880000	Well I wanted me death or don't get I wanted I wanted like Grand Theft Auto in the Wild West.
7880000	7885000	I didn't want OK. I had to buy some. I had to eat and I had to sleep and I had to go. Oh no
7885000	7890000	that was not in Grand Theft Auto 5. My real life is for is exactly like I don't want to have
7890000	7895000	to like you know take baths and like you know like shave myself
7895000	7900000	in the game. No seriously these are all things you do in the game because you get smelly
7900000	7905000	or you yeah you have a beard. Do you have to wash your balls. Is that. Well you
7905000	7910000	take a bath and if you play your cards right you can get a woman to wash your balls in the game.
7910000	7915000	Well maybe I don't want a woman to wash my balls. Well I don't know maybe they have men that wash your balls in there.
7915000	7920000	I haven't played the game enough but all I know is like they have you
7920000	7925000	can you can do that. But I just don't want to do all that crap.
7925000	7930000	I just want to play a game where I shoot things and run around and do crazy stuff. That's what
7930000	7935000	Grand Theft Auto was. You know you do it. And I had a lot of fun in Grand Theft Auto because I didn't have to do all that
7935000	7940000	bullshit. All right.
7941000	7946000	Let's see guys you know in chat says it was in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas you could eat
7946000	7951000	workout in Grand Theft Auto five you shower. Was that a thing.
7951000	7956000	I don't you play those games more than I do. Well showering aside she was the sideshow type of showering
7956000	7961000	you could do like I know you could shower in Grand Theft Auto
7961000	7966000	online and then they had a funny thing where if you apparently if you sing in the shower you
7966000	7971000	get extra experience points. It's basically making any noise in the shower.
7971000	7976000	But they also did that too with like the strippers and stuff to you could talk to the
7976000	7981000	strippers and as you shower to get the blood off. Oh OK. That sounds so appealing.
7981000	7986000	All right. Let's let's move on to something a little more wholesome please. Can we talk
7986000	7991000	about Minecraft. Wholesome fun for the whole family. Minecraft there's another
7991000	7996000	update for Minecraft where I guess I guess fans are kind of taking this on a little snapshot update
7996000	8001000	went into the game and paintings can I guess animate. So paintings
8001000	8006000	in Minecraft before used a single texture and now modders allowed the paintings to
8006000	8011000	change. So they've done some creative things with this by basically making TVs.
8011000	8016000	So but the TV like images and files they get really big because they're
8016000	8021000	you know they got to have like. Yeah. All the way it's drawn out everything just pink
8021000	8026000	files. They're not really compressed I don't think in these types of formats anyway either. So
8026000	8031000	they get really big. But I thought the one that's highlighted in this particular article I'm looking at that I thought was
8031000	8035000	very meta and funny was from a Reddit user named Hope
8035000	8040000	Abandoner who made a pixelated Minecraft YouTube video of somebody
8040000	8045000	playing Minecraft. Get it. Yeah. So you can you can what yo dog I heard you like
8045000	8050000	Minecraft. So now you can watch Minecraft while you Minecraft. So I just thought that was pretty
8050000	8055000	like the Gravity Falls pictures. Those are really nice looking. Yeah. Apparently though those files are like gigantic
8055000	8060000	again because they don't really compress like it was what 100 makes a space for like 30 frames. So you can't
8060000	8065000	you're not good. Although that inside the somebody put B movie in Minecraft because of course
8065000	8070000	they did. There's just certain things you always know people are going to do and putting B
8070000	8074000	movie is going to be one of them. Anyway.
8074000	8079000	Minecraft. Good times. You know my buddy of mine started a server and there's like a lot of people playing on it
8079000	8084000	and they've done a lot of cool work in there and then I log in and I'm just lost. I'm like these guys
8084000	8089000	these guys are pro Minecraft and I don't know what I'm doing. Oh well I need to do our server the fog
8089000	8094000	server and then they'll be all screwed up again. I know you'd like to do like I don't know.
8094000	8099000	I want to do mods again but like we need to have like some more survival
8099000	8104000	server where we actually work together to do something because Loki's plain vanilla server with
8104000	8108000	5000 mods on it. All right.
8108000	8113000	Moving on let's talk about Minecraft is educational. So let's keep it educational. Dark
8113000	8117000	Sakura. Well this actually
8117000	8122000	is coming from like a paper in Texas but some students
8122000	8127000	at Texas A&M boosted students scores in calculus
8127000	8132000	by making an educational video game. The game is called variant limits and
8132000	8137000	it connects the way that math and the gameplay work together in this
8137000	8142000	3D environment. And they use geo magnetic storms that
8142000	8147000	threaten their planet's survival. And so they have to solve a series of increasingly challenging calculus
8147000	8152000	problems. And so as they could apply it into their game it made the
8152000	8157000	concept work in real life or on paper for tests or whatever. So
8157000	8162000	they had some students play for like eight hours a day.
8162000	8167000	And they were fine. They got more out of it than they did by studying
8167000	8172000	their textbooks. That's a lot of play. And it became really fun. Then again I know people
8172000	8177000	that play MMOs that much so I guess can't talk. But they said
8177000	8182000	that 22 to 38 percent of university students depending on their preparation
8182000	8187000	failed calculus at more than 200 colleges that participated in a particular
8187000	8192000	study about this. So they are hoping
8192000	8197000	they're actually going to be showing variant limits at the Texas
8197000	8202000	A&M Powerhouse. Hold on let me see.
8202000	8207000	Yeah and the Texas A&M House at the upcoming SXSW Interactive
8207000	8212000	Festival in Austin Texas on March 10th through 12th. So there you go. I was kind of wondering
8212000	8217000	if like a regular person could get their hands on this game just to maybe help their own knowledge if they want to learn
8217000	8222000	a little more about calculus. Well the study itself actually took place in fall of 2018 that involved
8222000	8227000	more than 2000 Texas A&M engineering calculus students. So half
8227000	8232000	of them played variant limits and the other half just had to do normal study.
8232000	8237000	Well yeah you always have your control group. You have your control. But 79 percent
8237000	8242000	of the students agreed that the game increased their knowledge limits and
8242000	8247000	83 percent reported they were able to apply their knowledge from the game in class. So
8247000	8252000	they go. Oh and also the students performed well regardless
8252000	8257000	of racial or gender identity. Well they will. Yeah. Which I think there's no
8257000	8262000	no problem. But this is Texas. Fair enough. Fair enough. Yeah. So
8262000	8267000	I think is worth mentioning that they threw that in Texas.
8267000	8272000	Go figure. All those sorts of things have no no
8272000	8277000	difference on your capability to understand math and learn math. Yeah.
8277000	8282000	Go figure. Who knew. Obviously a slash sarcastic. But
8282000	8287000	you know I still think it's pretty neat that a video game is being used to you know teach it like this
8287000	8292000	high of a level like you know when we think of the educational type of games we think like Oregon Trail number
8292000	8297000	Munchers and you know that. But it's kind of neat that gaming as a teaching tool at
8297000	8302000	this complex of a college calculus level which I don't know about you guys like
8302000	8307000	I learned a little bit of that math stuff like the high end stuff but I don't really
8307000	8312000	despite the fact that I was like oh you'll use this year you need to know this because I was too busy programming games in my calculator.
8312000	8317000	OK. But I don't use I like AP calculus
8317000	8322000	I don't use it in my never took calculus when I was taking algebra in
8322000	8327000	college for my major teacher puts up this whole big diagram on the thing like you're
8327000	8332000	having to figure out the perimeter banner for this board and you're
8332000	8337000	missing this calculation. What do you do. And I just said I'll ask my client.
8337000	8342000	And she just looks at me and I'm like is that really what you do. I was like yeah I'd ask my client
8342000	8347000	this was to get me all the measurements like OK.
8347000	8352000	Yeah I would I would say algebra you use maybe even a little bit of
8352000	8357000	like the geometry maybe trade had to use it to do a
8357000	8362000	an accruing calculation in a number spreadsheet because I had to put in the equation.
8362000	8367000	I do think if you can prove that you can use a computer to answer all your questions that should be
8367000	8372000	you know but I don't know I'm we need to teach people in office spaces to learn how to use a
8372000	8377000	V look up in Excel because my God I've had so many people keep up this Excel
8377000	8382000	file against this other Excel file. Can you just type equals V look up and then
8382000	8387000	you know just do that yourself.
8387000	8392000	People just need to only know what they know. People need to learn that
8394000	8399000	you need to learn how to move with the times and just because you've always done something
8399000	8404000	one way doesn't always mean that there's not a better way to do it and that you
8404000	8409000	should be willing to adapt to learn different things that are going to increase your productivity and make you work
8409000	8414000	smarter not harder. All right let's move on and
8414000	8419000	to one more. No two more stories for you guys. So going to Loki.
8419000	8424000	Yes. So this is kind of a funny story. So valve had to update the steam
8424000	8429000	VR API because apparently they were having some tracking issues
8429000	8434000	with some games because people were moving so fast. So for example
8434000	8439000	there they were tracking the movement from people playing Beat Saber
8439000	8444000	and there was some issues where I guess the lighthouse tracking sensors
8444000	8449000	were miss interpreting where the position and movement of the players
8449000	8454000	were and apparently they had to add some sanity checks to prevent
8454000	8459000	things from going wrong. So like for example one of the things
8459000	8464000	that they tracked there was a person moving that was a thirty six hundred
8464000	8469000	degrees per second which is moving your they said the equivalent moving risk
8469000	8474000	90 degrees and zero point two five seconds. And apparently
8474000	8479000	they never guessed that people would be moving that quickly. So they had to update
8479000	8484000	it to Beat Saber kind of reward you for that type of intense move it
8484000	8489000	because you get more points if you kind of complete the motion or you may or I
8489000	8494000	guess I think it's more the starting was you make a motion to slice through because if you just sit there
8494000	8499000	you don't get any funny then their changes they they list they'll increase the limits
8499000	8504000	of what we thought was humanly possible for controller motion based on tracking
8504000	8509000	data from Beat Saber experts.
8509000	8514000	Interesting how that game is really had an impact on the VR scene
8514000	8519000	but I mean it's a great I mean as far as like music gaming and stuff go it's a great great
8519000	8524000	I love that game but obviously the experience on PlayStation VR is very different
8524000	8529000	from this because you know all these mods and the songs that this difficulty level
8529000	8534000	and stuff don't exist on PlayStation PlayStation is hard enough though in my opinion I can't clear
8534000	8539000	the advanced stuff I can clear like the mid-level stuff that's about any better tracking controllers
8539000	8544000	although I've been seeing patents online for new move controllers so maybe those are
8544000	8549000	coming. Yeah I kind of be curious what they have in store for PlayStation 5 like if
8549000	8554000	they're going to go further into VR but then obviously you know and I'm
8554000	8559000	going to buy a whole nother headset. And I'm sure and I'm sure Jamie's not alone in the whole like I don't want VR to
8559000	8563000	be the future of gaming. I need to hear what you know traditional television displays are going to do as well.
8563000	8568000	So they have to kind of be thinking about both sides of that you know so it'll be it'll be
8568000	8573000	interesting to see how this works itself into being integrated into the next
8573000	8578000	series of PlayStation as opposed to like an add on you know or maybe it will continue to be an add on.
8578000	8583000	We don't know. We don't know until we start hearing some secrets. So Bobby
8583000	8588000	Blackwell says don't bundle it with the PlayStation 5. And he says I love VR. I hope Sony
8588000	8593000	doesn't do the same thing Microsoft did with Kinect. True. I think that's a very fair point because again
8593000	8598000	I don't think Jamie's alone in the whole I'm not interested in VR. There's and you know it's just like there were a lot of people
8598000	8603000	that like I'm not interested in Kinect. And so if you were to kind of like force bundle that you're
8603000	8608000	going to absolutely be like why am I paying this overly inflate price. So that's exactly
8608000	8613000	probably keep me from buying it. Right. But I think still Sony still got to be thinking
8613000	8618000	about OK well I mean just like oh I don't know there's probably a terrible
8618000	8623000	example but like Nintendo would sell you the base Nintendo but they also had the
8623000	8628000	version that came with the Zapper and they've got to be thinking about how that would all kind of work together. So it doesn't mean
8628000	8633000	just because I'm saying I just hope there's backwards compatibility with the old hardware because I can understand like putting
8633000	8638000	out new hardware that's nice. Oh with VR. Yeah with the VR it's just I don't want to have to buy
8638000	8643000	like a headset right away and also like for whatever games that they're going to put out for it.
8643000	8648000	But I'm just saying they don't have to force bundle it. But I'm sure they've got to be thinking about what is the
8648000	8653000	path of this look like and where is VR going to fit into the entire PlayStation ecosystem and that sort of thing.
8653000	8658000	And that you know that doesn't necessarily just VR but
8658000	8663000	could be just move by itself for some things too. And it could get
8663000	8668000	away from move because move is old as from PlayStation 3. I mean come on.
8668000	8673000	All right. Anyway let's move on to something we're not going to have any time soon but
8673000	8678000	this is one that you should file under rumor but it is one of those things that also kind of
8678000	8683000	adds up and makes sense. So take it for what it is. But it has to do with Mother 3 and we've
8683000	8688000	been wondering where the hell is this. I don't think it's ever coming. It's a long time. Well this is a Game Informer
8688000	8693000	senior editor Imran Khan talked about the supposed
8693000	8698000	inside story on what's happened with Mother 3. Nintendo was
8698000	8703000	apparently considering localization of Mother 3 and they were like really they were going to do it
8703000	8708000	like they were very gung ho about it. But they went back they took a closer look at the game and
8708000	8713000	they had some question about some controversy about certain
8713000	8718000	elements of the game. And so they decided not to localize it. I thought this was already out.
8718000	8723000	Not in America. But I know I did. I meant this
8723000	8728000	information. I thought this had already been talked about like
8728000	8733000	right after the game came out came out in Japan. Kind of. I think people have always assumed
8733000	8738000	that that's part of the reason why it never came over here. But this is more kind of playing into
8739000	8744000	its confirmation that Nintendo looked into doing it wanted to do it and kind of hit that same
8744000	8749000	conclusion that probably people were thinking when the game first came out is that there's no way this is
8749000	8754000	going to fly in America. I already have my fan translation so I'm happy. Right. But it also goes to show that
8754000	8759000	Nintendo didn't want to edit or censor it and probably they didn't want to spend the money to go back and I
8759000	8764000	guess for lack of a better term fix it either. So they just decided we're going to leave it
8764000	8769000	where it is and that's that. So anyway that's sad
8769000	8774000	though because that's something I would have played. But I guess I
8774000	8779000	can't. All right. Dark Tetsuya is suggesting you need to go look at our discord
8779000	8784000	if you haven't already Loki because there's been a lot of talk about backwards compatibility on PlayStation. No I've seen
8784000	8789000	we talked about that like a while ago like about how they had the different like like
8789000	8794000	patents for like backwards compatibility and stuff like that. The patent doesn't mean anything.
8794000	8799000	I mean and I don't want to even think about rumors and speculation about new consoles
8799000	8804000	right now. So like I'll believe what's
8804000	8809000	told to me from Sony themselves once we get there. Yeah that's fair.
8809000	8814000	All right. We are going to make our way to discord. So
8814000	8819000	we're going to set up in the discord space right now. And if you want to be on the show
8819000	8824000	tonight all you have to do is join our green room and then we will be taking
8824000	8829000	calls shortly on discord except. Oh this has not happened before.
8829000	8834000	I'm having a problem connecting to discord right now. Oh there we go. Who got a little nervous that discord
8834000	8839000	wouldn't it's like the opposite of Skype. I heard you talking about it. It's like oh I better fix myself. Not like oh you're
8839000	8844000	talking about me. I'm going to break right. I was getting nervous there a little bit. All right. Anyway
8844000	8849000	we want to get to some calls here. So if you want to call the show tonight you should make our
8849000	8854000	way or make your way excuse me to our discord over at vog network
8854000	8859000	dot com slash discord. And I think we have a very familiar face already in the green
8859000	8864000	room waiting to go to be on tonight's program. So let's get to our first call tonight.
8864000	8869000	Hello you're on orange launch radio. Who's this.
8870000	8875000	Oh hi you're on orange launch radio. Who's this.
8875000	8880000	I'm a little concerned because I see do you see on the discord it says one bar with voice
8880000	8885000	connected. So like we're not don't have a very strong signal and I'm a little worried that maybe we are not going
8885000	8890000	through where the caller can hear us or perhaps that we can hear them.
8890000	8895000	So why don't I'm going to try to fix this here real quick. So while I do that Loki do you have any
8895000	8900000	like last minute stories we get into. Yes apparently the Evo
8900000	8905000	Japan live stream. We had some apologies that
8905000	8910000	for the dead or alive six stream being cut off because it was too sexy apparently.
8910000	8915000	So during the stream they had two Japanese models goofing around between rounds
8915000	8920000	when the dead or alive six producer and director
8920000	8925000	Yohei Shimbura was setting up the match and included clips of the girls jiggling
8925000	8930000	their butts and boobs to mimic the soft body physics and dead or alive six
8930000	8935000	is surely. Yes. Really after that they had the free camo
8935000	8940000	in the game zooming in the girls butts when they were wearing swimsuits. But that's really kind of
8940000	8945000	the heart of dead or alive 16. All right. We're going to try it again because I see a
8945000	8949000	green signal there. So hopefully it's going to work this out. You know what he did. I turned it off and then on again.
8949000	8954000	So let's see if that fixed it. Hi. You're an orange on radio. Who's this. Hey this is Bobby Black Wolf. Hello
8954000	8959000	Bobby Black Wolf. It's nice to have you here. Hello. Hey sorry I turned off my
8959000	8964000	twitch stream. So I hope it may have I don't know. We were having it was weird discord
8964000	8969000	was showing a very weak connection. So I turned it off and then on again and now it's showing green three bars.
8969000	8974000	So knock on plastic. Hopefully it will stay connected for us. But you're always great
8974000	8979000	and having us on your show every week. So I'm always delighted to hear you call in to us
8979000	8984000	what's on your mind tonight. So I wanted to fill in some of the
8984000	8989000	blanks about audica by harmonics. Sure.
8989000	8994000	So the VR game. I know you guys covered it a little bit but you didn't actually talk about
8994000	8999000	what it was. And the reason they did not make this for controllers
8999000	9004000	is because you already own this game on controllers. It's a carbon
9004000	9009000	copy of elite beat agents or rerave or any of those type of games where
9009000	9014000	you're using fingers like mostly on DS but like arcade games where you're using your fingers
9014000	9019000	except this time you're actually just pointing and shooting. So it's a game that already
9019000	9024000	exists and they're adapting it for VR and calling it their own thing.
9024000	9029000	Yeah. And I know we kind of ended up driving down a different path when we were talking about the
9029000	9034000	audica. So for me I'm I love elite beat agents and
9034000	9039000	I just wish that series would come back truthfully. But I'm curious to see harmonics
9039000	9044000	take on it. I mean I also understand the concern that harmonics is kind of it. They've kind
9044000	9049000	of been in a really weird place lately. And I was certainly not a big fan of the
9049000	9054000	amplitude reboot but you know not every game is going to be a five star winner. So I
9054000	9059000	will approach with a cautiously optimistic about what this game could hold.
9059000	9064000	Well my thing about harmonics is that I think they were they're in worse shape now
9064000	9069000	than they were right before MTV bought them. I think they were left worse off.
9069000	9074000	And so now they're like a smaller indie studio than they were when they were doing Guitar Hero
9074000	9079000	and Rock Band. Right. So they really need to you know they need to take some of these
9079000	9084000	risks like this because nobody really cares about them anymore and they're not
9084000	9089000	the big triple A developer that they used to be. That's true. Although I didn't
9089000	9094000	I mean honestly I didn't mind a lot of their triple A stuff. I don't think that. But I mean you know
9094000	9099000	I think in general with the rise and fall of Guitar Hero S type of games you know obviously
9099000	9104000	harmonics kind of got sucked into that whether they deserved it or not
9104000	9109000	with that whole thing. But you know they have that what was that game. They were testing
9109000	9114000	that one game that was like a fighting game and then they decided to abandon
9114000	9119000	it. And I was I was I was kind of sad to hear that because I thought it was pretty cool idea there. But I guess
9119000	9124000	they felt it wasn't fun at the end of the day or what have you. And these things happen. Yeah. I think that was
9124000	9129000	Chroma. Yeah. That's right. Chroma. That was it. That was the name of it. And
9129000	9134000	Chad Leland's in our chat mentioning drop mix which that is
9134000	9139000	now that is really cool. But that's not a video game. But it's obviously heavily inspired
9139000	9144000	by that. But as like a board game and the whole integration with phones everything drop mixes
9144000	9149000	is really brilliant. Honestly it's a brilliant game. Yeah. And I actually have some of those
9149000	9154000	exclusive cards from Pax. So no listener sent them to me when you wanted him to. And I'm
9154000	9159000	like I got him. Well it was never for me. It was for our
9159000	9164000	collector friend Shane over there in chat. I think I ended up getting
9164000	9169000	think he ended up getting a one way or another. OK. Yeah. But yeah. No I just wanted
9169000	9174000	to fill in the blanks on that. You know that's why it's in VR and I am someone who likes VR.
9174000	9179000	And I'm going to say something controversial here. You know me my controversial
9179000	9184000	opinions. Sure. Is that I am of the belief that not
9184000	9189000	every game needs to be playable by every person in the world. And so I understand
9189000	9194000	that there are some people like you know somebody made the thing amputees can't play DDR even though yes
9194000	9199000	on the console version you can play button button revolution on the controller. But like I do
9199000	9204000	love the blind community that we have here at VOG and I respect them.
9204000	9209000	But even I don't think I think they would even say not every game needs to be made to be
9209000	9214000	playable by someone who's blind. So I respect that there are people that have
9214000	9219000	different advantages and disadvantages to playing. But I don't think that every single
9219000	9224000	game needs to cater to everybody because then we'd only have one or two types of games.
9226000	9231000	Let me give a tiny needle back though on that. OK. Because because it's not it's not that I disagree
9231000	9236000	because obviously you know like it's kind of like you've mentioned with like the DDR and everything
9236000	9241000	is that like you know there's you want to try to open your game to as many people as possible.
9241000	9246000	I think certainly. But sometimes just due to the delivery mechanism that just may not be
9246000	9251000	possible or what have you. I think we need games made only for autistic people and not N.T. people.
9251000	9256000	Cool. If we're going to be excluded from everybody else's games why shouldn't other people be excluded from our
9256000	9261000	game. That same logic should be fair. It wouldn't be all that. But I would support
9261000	9266000	that honestly. But I don't think autistic folks or any of the other things we've
9266000	9271000	named are excluded from everything. I was using the same logic. Sure.
9271000	9276000	But the other thing I want to kneel back on was what about like difficulty
9276000	9281000	because I know we've had a lot of like jokes and things about how you don't like
9281000	9286000	to play games that are difficult because and so we talk about how well
9286000	9291000	when there's a Bobby Black Wolf mode in the game that makes the game more accessible because now it's something that like
9291000	9296000	I feel like I can play and I can like I can do isn't that kind of an accessibility thing too.
9297000	9302000	And I am totally fine with me being excluded from the souls genre.
9302000	9307000	OK. Yeah. And to be fair I don't really care for the souls games.
9307000	9312000	Yeah. But I mean I am totally fine with there being a challenge for people that want that challenge.
9312000	9317000	I don't want to take that away from them. Right. And you know that's that is a principle like let's
9317000	9322000	take the souls series. You know that series is predicated on
9322000	9327000	it being overly difficult. And if you make it accessible to me you
9327000	9332000	destroy what makes those games the souls games. Whereas I understand like I know the later Mega Man
9332000	9337000	said it the easier modes and stuff but that doesn't necessarily destroy inherently what Mega Man is
9337000	9342000	where the souls games were built around. This is difficult and I'm OK but that's not for
9342000	9347000	me. I think at the end of the day you know in the games industry and especially
9347000	9352000	in the case of like a triple A studio you're going to live and die by your sales. And if you exclude a certain
9352000	9357000	segment no matter what how you're excluding or what it is whether it's difficulty whether it's disability
9357000	9362000	if you exclude a certain segment then you're going to affect your sales. But depending
9362000	9367000	on what kind of studio you are if you're like an indie studio and maybe you do want
9367000	9372000	to make a game that only a very specific set of individuals are going to be able to play
9372000	9377000	then that's that's awesome that's cool and you know everybody should support the ability of that to exist.
9377000	9382000	But it is going to impact sales and you kind of just have to know like I'm not going to sell 11 billion copies
9382000	9387000	of this game because I'm going against or I'm going only for this one little market if that makes sense.
9387000	9392000	Well and that's what Bungie wants to do with Destiny 2. They want to make it more accessible to the hardcore
9392000	9397000	Activision reportedly wanted to sell a billion copies. And so that's why
9397000	9402000	there was the disconnect there and Bungie is like we'd rather sell less and deliver an experience for the hardcore
9402000	9407000	that Activision wouldn't let us do. Interesting
9407000	9412000	way to bring it full circle how this is kind of impacting many corners of the industry
9412000	9417000	for sure. So I think I'll leave the discussion at that. But Bobby anything else you want to talk about or anything you want to
9417000	9422000	plug while you're here. Well I am on the voice of geeks network twitch channel right before
9422000	9427000	OLR. So come an hour early and hang out with me in the pre-show for OLR.
9427000	9432000	I always do. Sometimes I'm distracted by the smell of food
9432000	9437000	getting brought into the house or what have you. But yeah I always try to
9437000	9442000	catch the Bobby Black Wolf show when I can. All right. All right. Take care Bobby.
9442000	9447000	Thanks for calling. See ya. All right. So if you
9447000	9452000	want to call on the show tonight our green room is currently empty but you can join the green room over on Discord and
9452000	9457000	we will try to bring in some more calls. Some interesting comments in our chat room.
9457000	9462000	VG realness in chat says another good example of quote not for everyone is Dream Daddy.
9462000	9467000	That's for a specific market. If they made it for everyone the game wouldn't be the same. Interesting because it's
9467000	9472000	almost like you kind of flip that. And sometimes where you know I get I
9472000	9477000	feel left out sometimes as a LGBT plus plus community member is that in some
9477000	9482000	games you know when you have a create your own character and you can do whatever
9482000	9487000	you want but you can't do this thing romantically. That is me. You feel
9487000	9492000	like I don't I mean I can play the game but can I really enjoy can I
9492000	9497000	connect with the game the same way somebody else can. Maybe not. So that's why you hear a lot of
9497000	9502000	social justice people. I'm using my big quotey fingers for those in the podcast complaining
9502000	9507000	about that sometimes because you know that's representation. It's important. And that's
9507000	9512000	in all sorts of things. Anyway let's see.
9514000	9519000	Kajuda says I always say if everyone has a hammer you can't build a house. Everyone has to have different tools.
9519000	9524000	Questbuster says not a huge fan of permadeath RPGs but not going to argue that other people can't have them.
9524000	9529000	All right. Let's move on to any other last minute stories we might have tonight
9529000	9534000	from either dark soccer or Loki really cracked down sales are down. So correct down three
9534000	9539000	they're saying that way down only about 10 percent of crack down to sales.
9540000	9545000	That's not good. They said the launch week it's
9545000	9550000	sold only 4000 units in the UK. Is that 10 percent of lifetime
9550000	9555000	sales or is it 10 percent of the same week one figures. I think it may be week one.
9555000	9560000	I don't know. But they I don't I don't know if that's even
9560000	9565000	accurate. I don't know if the game sold as well but I think
9565000	9570000	it price it's going to sell OK. I think you also have to consider and Jamie are you trying to get
9570000	9575000	a comment on this or another story. OK. The the other thing to consider
9575000	9580000	is that Microsoft is also selling this game pass thing which is very important to them and
9580000	9585000	what they want to do. And right people that are getting this game on that game pass are not going to be counted in this.
9585000	9590000	And I do think you need to consider some of those things to you meaning the Internet not you Loki
9590000	9595000	but you know armchair critics on forums and this need to consider there are more ways that games get
9595000	9600000	delivered than just what it used to be too. Well there's other games coming out too this week as well.
9600000	9605000	Metro Exodus came out the same day for the new Far Cry
9605000	9610000	game. I don't know. I don't think it's such a big deal. We'll see whatever. I mean
9610000	9615000	it's cracked down. What do you expect. It's not like you know it's just cracked down every
9615000	9620000	crackdown game is exactly the same. Yeah we're not we're not breaking the mold or anything.
9620000	9625000	It's just cracked down. Any other last minute
9625000	9630000	stories. Jamie Loki. Anybody. All right. Well our green room is pretty
9630000	9635000	quiet. So I think that might be someone call.
9635000	9640000	Do it. Some weeks are crazier. Is there something on TV tonight. I am here. Why are you not
9640000	9645000	talking to me. I'll talk to you. What do you want to talk about stuff.
9645000	9650000	I probably want caffeine. You want caffeine. Yeah I'm probably going to get a soda.
9650000	9655000	The coffee from earlier wasn't enough. It was a decaf.
9655000	9660000	Because I'm not supposed to have caffeine. But you know what. I love caffeine. Yeah.
9660000	9665000	Same thing my doctor told me I was supposed to stop drinking coffee and I was like so that's not going to happen. So we need to negotiate.
9665000	9670000	She kind of laughed and was like all right. Well also just to
9670000	9675000	point out we got another green room but go ahead. Well just a point of education if you are prone
9675000	9680000	to kidney stones don't drink fucking airborne vitamin C will lead to
9680000	9685000	a buildup in your kidneys that leads to guess what. Kidney stones. Is that specific
9685000	9690000	to airborne or like vitamin C supplements to vitamin C supplements as well. Because after my surgery
9690000	9695000	I was told basically I can only take vitamin C in very limited doses.
9695000	9700000	Interesting because they will make you it will make you more prone to kidney stones because it leads to deposits.
9700000	9705000	But those are yeah those yeah those like airborne in the emergency and that stuff is just like it's just like
9705000	9710000	flacking your body with a ton of vitamin C. And second of all there's absolutely no science behind it doing any
9710000	9715000	good it's all conjecture. All right. Let's get to another call here on the show. Hello you're on
9715000	9720000	orange on radio. Who's this. Hey it's Ron. How is everybody tonight.
9720000	9725000	Fabulous. How are you. Why are you not sharing any Okonomiyaki with me.
9725000	9730000	I tagged you as the best I could do. Yeah but that just means you need to send me a ticket
9730000	9735000	so I can go out there and eat Okonomiyaki. Oh well I think that may happen
9735000	9740000	I'm saying given the news I told you anything could be plausible. You
9740000	9745000	know like for three years in a row I've been talking about this is the year I'm going to have to come to New York City
9745000	9750000	but seriously seriously now that they're putting jagged little pill on Broadway this
9750000	9754000	fall like I that that might be the thing that finally
9754000	9758000	I'm waiting for Beetlejuice. Oh are they doing a musical out of Beetlejuice?
9758000	9763000	Beetlejuice musical. That's going to be a lot of fun. I'm still waiting for the second movie. I thought they weren't going to do the second movie now.
9763000	9768000	No I think they are. Of course I'm waiting for Bill into three as well. Oh yes.
9768000	9773000	Yes yes. Anyway although Alex Winter does not look any different and Keanu Reeves never ages.
9773000	9778000	All right. I'm sure Rama didn't call in to talk about Broadway tonight. Well maybe it's because Keanu Reeves is a vampire
9778000	9783000	and he turned Alex Winter. So you know what would you like to talk about tonight Rama. Well I was going to
9783000	9787000	say you know you know the Beetlejuice musical is not us but we do have
9787000	9792000	Beetle House. It's an amazing restaurant. So if you do come out here you got to bring Jamie
9792000	9797000	you got to bring Loki. You got to bring the squad out here. All right.
9797000	9803000	As soon as we have time and money done. Oh and a sitter for Loki's kids.
9804000	9809000	And a sitter for my cat and Jamie's too. Dan can watch Midna. That's true.
9809000	9815000	Alan can watch Smush. He doesn't need to go right. Nobody's going to watch my cat. She's going to die.
9815000	9821000	All right. Anyway OK. All right. So you should know you should tell your kids that if they watch
9821000	9826000	your cat perfectly you'll take him back to the broccoli farm. But this time you actually take him to a broccoli farm.
9826000	9831000	All right. What is actually on your mind tonight Rama.
9836000	9841000	We talked about games and games and so forth but there's some gaming accessories we haven't really touched on.
9841000	9846000	So I want to talk about this new amazing gaming chair that I went out and bought
9846000	9851000	and this thing is amazing. I saw your chair. Yeah. All right.
9851000	9856000	All right. So this is an unpaid promotional spot. No I'm kidding. What was the chair. Tell me about it.
9856000	9861000	I didn't I didn't see this. Well a couple of years back going through cheap
9861000	9866000	40 50 dollar chairs you had to relax and I'm like I need something you know
9866000	9871000	for my back something better. So I was looking more on a budget. So I got like this decent
9871000	9876000	chair by third party knockoff company whatever I paid
9876000	9881000	maybe about 150 shipping. It was nice for a couple of years until the gas cylinder started to sink.
9881000	9886000	So what about these gaming chairs. They say that it is rated for a certain weight
9886000	9891000	but it's like well you know long story short I can't
9891000	9896000	replace like the cylinder and the parts on it. So last Thursday night I'm going through different game sites
9896000	9901000	for gaming chairs like DX Racer Alpine opposite
9901000	9906000	Secret Lab and a bunch of others. So I decided you know looking at my budget
9906000	9911000	I dropped maybe about a little bit over 200 for this chair by
9911000	9916000	OPC comes within a day and it takes me like a half hour to assemble it and it's just
9916000	9921000	comfy as all hell. What makes it a
9921000	9926000	gaming chair like racing chairs. Yeah.
9927000	9932000	Like bucket seat style sitting you know it's
9932000	9937000	sitting in a race car more or less. Well sometimes like a gaming chair as I've seen
9937000	9942000	sold is like this like overlay you put on your regular chair that's just there to vibrate your ass.
9942000	9947000	That is what like I've seen those gaming chairs. It's vibration for your ass. No it does.
9947000	9952000	You need to see the chairs they do for racing rigs that have full on
9952000	9957000	hydraulics built into it. Well I've seen some of the stuff your husband built. Yeah. Yeah.
9957000	9962000	I want a hydraulic chair for playing Star Blade.
9963000	9968000	That sounds that's the area you know and you don't I mean you
9968000	9973000	you've joked before that you I mean you live in New York City so you obviously don't live in a gigantic
9973000	9978000	space. So this is something that's kind of you're able to fit it in a smaller
9978000	9983000	space even. Yes and I'll say it once I say it again my
9983000	9988000	studio which is smaller than studio it's an efficiency it's probably about the
9988000	9993000	size of the studio you're doing the show from. Which would be like the family room
9993000	9998000	in a house. Yeah I mean I have a
9998000	10003000	galley kitchen what more does that tell you. But on the plus side directly to my left is the fridge
10003000	10008000	and right behind me is the microwave toaster of it and the coffee maker. So it's like one
10008000	10013000	stop shopping. I get it though. I get it though. I mean that's that's big city living. I mean a lot of my friends in San
10013000	10018000	Francisco in a similar thing. So basically. Yeah.
10018000	10023000	All right. Well Rama thank you for the call. Thank you for talking about a topic we don't always talk about
10023000	10028000	but the accessories to the games and not just the games themselves but the things that
10028000	10033000	power them and make them more and more entertaining and vibrates your ass. All right.
10033000	10038000	Well I can get something separate for that but I will say this. I'll say this when it comes to various
10038000	10043000	accessories. I mean I understand a lot of people were on budget. You don't want to spend
10043000	10048000	too much money. I mean yeah I spent 150 on this chair that started to fall
10048000	10053000	apart after a couple of years. Mind you the book like a third of the cost was shipping.
10054000	10059000	I paid honestly two hundred and twenty nine for this chair and I got next day shipping because of how
10059000	10064000	close the warehouse is. But I've been getting nothing but great support through the people for any issues
10064000	10069000	and it's very simple to put together. There are some things you really shouldn't skimp out
10069000	10074000	on because it lasts you a lot better in the long run. I get that there are some chairs are like
10074000	10079000	three four five hundred dollars. They come with five 10 year limited lifetime warranties.
10079000	10084000	I'm just saying if you're going to invest in something I'd say
10084000	10089000	if you look at it like the cheapest go up a couple of notches and go from there. You want to invest
10089000	10094000	in something pretty well. And I have to say there is a major difference between the prior
10094000	10099000	chair that I had for a couple of years and the current one that I need. So
10099000	10104000	my back has never felt any better. Loki found a picture of the chair for me so I'm able to look at it.
10104000	10109000	And for the podcast folks it kind of it has like definitely like two big like they look like a lumbar
10109000	10114000	cushions in the head for like your back and your typical like you
10114000	10119000	almost like a DX researcher. Yeah. But that does look comfy. So if I come to New York
10119000	10124000	I'm going to come sit in your chair. Absolutely. You can you can enjoy the throne.
10124000	10129000	I will get you the Bugs Bunny throne everything. You can sit there and be like
10129000	10134000	when people say who the hell you think I am you just look at them like I know who I am. Who is you?
10134000	10139000	Sounds like a plan. Rama pleasure to have you here as always. You take care, buddy.
10139000	10144000	Always. You take care, bro. And you all stay awesome. All right. You too. Bye.
10144000	10149000	Bye. All right. Always a pleasure to hear from Rama. I think, though, with that, we will start to
10149000	10154000	wrap up. So I'm sorry to those that didn't get through tonight, although there was nobody else in the green room at that time.
10154000	10159000	So I don't think anybody else tried. But if you do want to think of something after the fact, you can always send us an e-mail.
10159000	10164000	Participate at OrangeLaundrio.com or you can always tweet us at Twitter dot com slash o l r. There's lots
10164000	10169000	of ways you can reach out to the show. And yeah, it's always a delight to hear from listeners. Hey, if you enjoyed
10169000	10174000	what you heard here at Orange Laundrio, tell a friend or two about the show. Help us spread the word. We are the show where every
10174000	10179000	gamer has a voice, but we can only air those voices if they're out there
10179000	10184000	hearing us. So, yeah, tell a friend. Leave a nice five star review on a site like
10184000	10189000	iTunes. That goes a long way as well. We also really appreciate all the followers and the hosts over at
10189000	10194000	Twitch TV slash VOG Network. And of course, the biddies and subscriptions are great, too, although we never want to
10194000	10199000	beg for your money. I will say it does go to videos. So I appreciate that as well.
10199000	10204000	With all that, I think we're ready to go around to get final thoughts. So I'll start with you tonight,
10204000	10209000	Loki. What's your final thought as we bring things to a close here in the studio?
10209000	10214000	My final thought is I would like to stream more this week. It's just I have to cook several days now.
10214000	10219000	I've got barbecue chicken wings and make in my wife wants to make her
10219000	10224000	matzo ball soup. And that's good, though. And some other
10224000	10229000	stuff, I'm sure always something comes up. But I'll try to stream some
10229000	10234000	more this week, maybe more crackdown three and Skyrim eventually.
10234000	10240000	Then I realize all this is taken away from game development time. That should probably be doing since you guys all keep bugging me about game development.
10240000	10245000	So I tried doing that at my son's
10245000	10250000	coding class thing, but it is packed in like it was pretty uncomfortable just to work on
10250000	10255000	with where I was sitting. So I just kind of because the sun was like coming
10255000	10260000	in through the window, blinding me. So I just kind of gave up on that. But we'll see.
10260000	10265000	My final thought and then we'll get to Jamie. My final thought tonight is I've
10265000	10270000	had a very busy weekend. So I've had a show Friday, a show Saturday, a show tonight. So I'm ready
10270000	10275000	for a day off tomorrow. So hooray for a three day weekend. And I've also been very
10275000	10280000	bad at the streaming thing on my personal channel lately. So maybe that's something I'll try to do tomorrow. We'll see.
10280000	10285000	Stay tuned to Twitter is a good place to follow me over at Mr. Rob Roberts on Twitter.
10285000	10290000	Last but certainly not least, dark soccer. Fantastic to have you here in the studio tonight. Always appreciate
10290000	10295000	you being here and your perspectives and all that good stuff. Can't wait to have you back full time. I'm looking forward to it. And that's only what,
10295000	10300000	like two weeks, right? Or a week after next. So that's great. So really, you just have next week
10300000	10305000	off and then you're back for half. Well, sorry. Off this. Sorry. But yes,
10305000	10310000	I am tireder than a white suburbanite mom of three
10310000	10315000	with her glass of Franzia. Tip it.
10315000	10320000	Right now. And I am still planning on doing Jamie Cheats to win.
10320000	10325000	I need to find the Eddie Guerrero theme song for this. And I also have to
10325000	10330000	clean off the floor in my office so I can use the TV in there. But Jamie
10330000	10335000	Cheats to win is going to be a thing. I'm also deciding if I want to do Legend of Zelda Link to the Past
10335000	10340000	or if I want to do like debug Sonic. Why not both?
10340000	10345000	Because I want to do something that's going to be fun first. Do them all. All the things.
10345000	10350000	Stream all the games. All right. Maybe. All right. That's it. We're on out of here for tonight. We will
10350000	10355000	see you in seven days. At least Loki and I'll be here then for whatever happens in gaming news next week.
10355000	10360000	It was pretty busy this week. So we'll see what happens next week. Lots more stuff to talk about, I'm sure. Until then,
10360000	10365000	happy gaming, everybody. We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio. Good night.
