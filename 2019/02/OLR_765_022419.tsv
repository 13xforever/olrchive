0	18080	This week, rumors swirl about Microsoft discussing a means for its titles to become available
18080	19180	on the Nintendo Switch.
19180	22180	This announcer would love more games available in a highly portable means.
22180	25560	This is just one mixy rumor, stay tuned for the rest of the week's gaming news starting
25560	32560	right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.
32560	35920	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
35920	37880	where every gamer has a voice.
37880	44800	It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 765 for this February 24th
44800	46580	of 2019.
46580	51120	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always is the one and only Techmaster Loki.
51120	52120	Hello.
52120	53120	Hi, how are you?
53120	54120	I'm good.
54120	56880	We had five technical hiccups in the beginning but I think we got it all worked out.
56880	57880	Yes.
57880	58880	Do you know what I had to do to fix the issue?
58880	60280	Turn it off and turn it back on.
60280	63040	I had to turn it off and then turn it back on again and I fixed it.
63040	64040	Alright.
64040	65800	It's like magic, go figure.
65800	67320	Tech support 101.
67320	71960	Not joining us tonight in studio, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers, but this is the last week
71960	75640	of her work thing that has kept her off the air for several months.
75640	79680	Of course we'll hear from her at the classic game of the week as we have been over the
79680	83440	past few months, but she will be back in studio full time next week.
83440	84440	So that's pretty exciting.
84440	87680	I know we had her last week, but you know, she's like, that was a special thing.
87680	92280	So, um, but joining us tonight in studio is Mr. Smoosh and you might hear him in the background
92280	93760	meowing cause I don't know what he's going.
93760	96840	He was probably coming up through my sandwich cause I have half of it sitting on the couch
96840	97840	right here.
97840	101600	Oh, so he's like smelling the turkey or chicken or whatever's in your sandwich that you got.
101600	102600	Yes.
102600	103600	I see.
103600	104600	All right.
104600	105600	That explains a lot.
105600	107800	He does kind of go crazy when he smells food because he thinks it's like feeding time.
107800	109260	Just like me, just like dad.
109260	110260	So there you go.
111180	115620	We of course are live on the interwebs as we always are every Sunday night at six o'clock
115620	120220	Pacific nine o'clock Eastern at the voice of geeks network vog network.com.
120220	125700	We are on Twitch TV, the easiest way to find us Twitch TV slash vog network.
125700	130300	Hello to everybody that's out there in our chat room over at Twitch TV and some folks
130300	136100	talking a little bit about, uh, the, um, uh, intro that we did with the, we had a little
136100	140180	joke, a star where you was born because there's obviously the Oscars are going on tonight,
140180	143620	which I mean, I just, I don't really care about the Oscars.
143620	147420	We've been doing this show for so long and not to be like that hipster.
147420	152120	That's like, well, I don't care because my stuff is more important, but I mean, to me,
152120	155540	this is more important and it's just, eh, you know, I don't know.
155540	161040	It's like, it's an award show, whatever, like whether Gaga wins the Oscar or not, it's not
161040	164540	going to change what kind of an artist she is and all this stuff.
164540	169020	So I just kinda, I do understand that that the Oscars can bring like visibility maybe.
169020	172160	And that's what it really used to be is that it really brought visibility to films that
172160	174540	maybe otherwise people wouldn't see.
174540	177740	But I feel like in this day and age and all the campaigns going behind it and all the,
177740	182140	all the lead up with the hype and the 24 hours, seven internet news coverage, it's kinda,
182140	183340	it's kind of a whatever.
183340	186900	So yes, yet we all want gaming to have an award ceremony.
186900	188100	I can tie it to gaming.
188100	189400	We all want gaming to have an award ceremony.
189400	192020	They have so many game trailers during the word ceremony.
192020	196980	See if like they had like movie trailer debuts, Oh, make it like the MTV movie awards, but
196980	197980	yeah.
197980	198980	Okay.
198980	200700	So that's more, who cares with the Oscars?
200700	202420	You should, you know, the Oscars have been having problems.
202420	204060	They don't even have a host this year.
204060	205060	They got so many problems.
205060	207020	No one called me.
207020	210340	I was sitting here waiting and it's like, my phone's not ringing.
210340	215020	I guess I'm not hosting the Oscars this year, unfortunately.
215020	216020	So here I am.
216020	219380	We'll be waiting here waiting for your call.
219420	223460	I mean, they were scraping the bottom of the barrel to try to find people to do it.
223460	225940	I'm telling you, I'm at the bottom of that barrel.
225940	229740	So did you hear like the conspiracy theory that Whoopi Goldberg secretly was off the
229740	233060	view because she was prepping to host the Oscars cause she'd done it before.
233060	236220	So of course, you know, who better to host than somebody that hosted before, but no,
236220	237220	she just had pneumonia.
237220	239340	People made up that rumor.
239340	240340	It's funny.
240340	245500	Uh, in our chat over at Twitch TV, uh, slash vog network, uh, quest buster says, I'll see
245500	247140	the winners list tomorrow morning.
247140	248140	That's kind of where I'm at.
248140	249140	That's where I'm at.
249140	253860	Uh, Bobby Blackwell says, unfortunately the game trailers pay for the game awards.
253860	255620	That's why they have to cram in the awards.
255620	259420	That is a true statement though, is that, you know, they're commercials.
259420	260420	Those game trailers are commercials.
260420	261860	I don't care why they're there.
261860	263060	I just like that they're there.
263060	264860	I mean, it makes sense.
264860	265860	I don't care.
265860	266860	It's, it's fine.
266860	267860	All right.
267860	271220	Well let's, I guess, I guess movies are on everybody's mind, so it's appropriate that
271220	274460	our kickoff topic tonight has a little bit to do with movies, right?
274460	275460	Yes.
275460	278940	It has to do with movies that were on steam cause they had that.
278940	283220	I think the only movie they had on steam was indie game, the movie from humble bundle.
283220	285920	You're actually really, really wrong.
285920	289780	And this is the perfect reason why there are no longer movies on steam.
289780	294260	I think indie game, the movie was like the first one because they kind of released it
294260	299420	like it was a game and they had, well, no, I said the only game, only movie I had was
299420	303340	indie game, the movie totally, you know, okay, sorry.
303340	304500	Throw me under the bus there.
304500	305500	It's fine.
305500	306500	No.
306500	310780	The only movie that I had on steam, I think it was indie game, the movie under the Pikachu.
310780	311780	That's all I got.
311780	313980	Um, but no, they did have more movies on there.
313980	317660	It's just not a lot of people really remembered that they had them on there.
317660	320660	And plus there's like a lot of different other video platforms.
320660	325760	So I don't, I think if they did more like humble movie bundles or something like that,
325760	332440	they might've, you know, brought more, um, exposure to it, but it didn't seem like that
332440	334260	a lot of people knew about it or cared about it.
334260	335260	And so now it's going away.
335300	339140	Well, and I also like when were movies ever featured on the front page of steam?
339140	341140	Like I've never seen movies.
341140	345100	And is it because they switched more to that algorithm where it's kind of like, like everybody
345100	347700	has a custom store based on the content you buy.
347700	352060	So if you're not buying movies, you never see movies, but like, hello, how am I going
352060	354180	to know about movies if they're not there?
354180	356860	Plus they, they weren't exactly cheap either, right?
356860	360300	Like maybe if they had like a 99 cent movie once in a while, people might be more into
360300	361300	it.
361300	362300	Or maybe a movie rental thing.
362300	363300	I mean, I don't know.
363340	368140	I'm looking right now cause like my library, I've got my library of stuff and so I don't
368140	376460	even know where this would be cause there's games, software, VR and music.
376460	378340	I don't see movies.
378340	380740	So is that under software?
380740	382100	Nope.
382100	384660	So is it under music?
384660	385660	Nope.
385660	389860	So it really, so you, you're saying that it really feels like the movies is like just
389860	393200	super like kind of like tacked on under a rock.
393200	395840	You have to kind of know where to go to get it.
395840	398040	Kind of like what Xbox indie games turned into.
398040	403440	Like I don't even know where I would go in steam to watch that movie they have.
403440	405540	Well, indie game shows up as a game.
405540	410920	I know cause I have that same movie because I think I got that indie game, the movie in
410920	413320	one of those things you're talking about, like a humble pack or something.
413320	418280	So it's in the store in like, as just like a game, but that was a very special thing.
418280	421160	Not all movies kind of like worked like that.
421160	422160	Yeah.
422160	425800	Well, it's gone or it's going to be gone soon.
425800	427800	So hope you didn't get attached to it.
427800	428800	Yeah.
428800	432480	Oh, what do you, I mean, I guess this kind of leads it to a bigger question about how
432480	438760	important is the integration of movies and all this stuff into your service?
438760	442640	Because I mean, I think about like my PlayStation four, like, especially because it's in the
442640	445840	living room, it's kind of like my, my device that's in there.
445840	451100	Uh, I do a lot of Twitch TV on it and I really wish the Twitch TV app had like the same,
451100	454820	I wish it was on par with the PC, PC desktop version.
454820	458420	Like you can't search by tags on the PS four version.
458420	459420	I do that a lot.
459420	462580	So there's little things that I would like to still see improved and have like the parody
462580	463580	with desktop, but whatever.
463580	469100	Um, but I do a lot of like Netflix, in fact, Sony in particular really has a nice little
469100	471020	like one stop thing.
471020	474660	Like when you go into the TV and movies, it kind of shows like all these movies and it
474660	476940	shows like what platforms they're all on.
476940	477940	Yeah.
477940	478940	This was on Amazon prime.
478940	479940	This was on Hulu.
479980	484740	And you kind of know like where to go and I think you can actually search for anything
484740	487660	and it'll show you what service it's in, which is brilliant.
487660	492660	A lot of different, I know like Google TV does or Android TV does the same thing.
492660	494740	Um, you can search by that stuff.
494740	495740	Roku.
495740	498580	I think my Roku TV does that.
498580	500920	Um, maybe, I don't know.
500920	504620	I just remember my old one does and it has like voice chat, which never really worked
504620	509900	correctly, but, um, yeah, I mean, I don't tend to buy.
509900	515740	Movies digitally, which is because we have all these services that kind of keep coming
515740	517660	and going away.
517660	522780	Um, I've looked at a few, like during the sales and stuff and they have on the PlayStation
522780	525340	store, like they'll have movies for sale sometimes.
525340	526340	And they're still always too expensive.
526340	527700	It's like 10 bucks for a movie.
527700	532380	I'm like, eh, I'll just buy the physical movie if I'm going to do that.
532380	535900	So that's why we turned to the old piracy.
535900	539820	Well, I don't, I don't pirate movies, but I think you're right about the subscription
539820	540820	service.
540820	543140	I don't remember the last time I bought a movie.
543140	544940	Like it's been a long time.
544940	549780	I know I bought Tron, uh, legacy on Blu-ray, but that was how many years ago?
549780	550940	Like that was 2010.
550940	551940	Was that movie?
551940	552940	Well, yeah.
552940	556420	And also my, I honestly don't remember the last time I bought a Blu-ray and lots of fun.
556420	562340	I'm acquiring is just, you know, for my wife or my kids to watch and then they'll watch
562340	565020	it and get bored of it, but it's all for me.
565020	570860	It's all subscription service, which is interesting because that's where music went, right?
570860	575220	Music was, um, you know, you used to, it was like, it was all about going to for me when
575220	576220	I was younger.
576220	577220	Here I go.
577220	578220	I'm going to date myself.
578220	579220	Y'all ready?
579220	584700	I used to go to the warehouse or tower records as back when tower records knew me back at
584700	585700	the warehouse.
585700	593140	Um, I remember I actually received a gift certificate, not a gift card, a gift certificate,
593140	597940	like a written out piece of paper that you would take in to redeem for money.
597940	598940	Yeah.
598940	603540	Um, so I would go get the new, like the guy at tower records knew me.
603540	608580	Like it was like, Oh, he's the one that will want the import Bjork single that came in
608580	613060	with the, with the rare remix of hyper ballad or whatever it is like he knew they knew me
613060	614060	there.
614060	618780	But, um, but yeah, I used to like buy all that stuff and then Napster came out and like
618780	620260	I would still buy CDs.
620260	623700	I didn't like to pirate things, you know, all the time.
623700	629060	I would still buy CDs for the artists I support, but for those like ultra rare remixes that
629060	634200	was like a Europe only CD type of thing, you got to pay $12 because I would, it's only
634200	635200	on the vinyl.
635200	640420	I would, I would download those on Napster because you know, like I'm not like, you know,
640420	642340	it was a ridiculous amount we were paying.
642340	643340	Right.
643340	644900	So I kind of justified it with that.
644900	648580	Um, but, but then iTunes came out and that really changed everything.
648580	650740	It made everything like a worldwide market.
650740	654460	Like there was no import stuff, hardly any more, maybe in the very, very beginning.
654460	658580	But now, you know, there's so much you can download like worldwide and through Apple
658580	662420	music through Spotify, you know, we just had a story about Capcom soundtracks all being
662420	663420	on Spotify last week.
663420	668100	Like, you know, subscription services, where it at, where it's at now movies to do in this
668100	669580	very similar thing, right?
669580	673020	Like I don't really buy movies ever.
673020	677100	I can't tell you, like, I have a very impressive collection of DVDs from when I lived with
677100	681100	you and you worked for the movie distributor and you're always like, Oh, this is like
681100	682100	a gay film.
682100	683100	Rob would like this.
683100	684780	You get the, I didn't always do that.
684780	685780	Just no, it was just that.
685780	687380	But like, Oh, Oh, you knew this stuff.
687380	690460	I like to like, Oh, strangers with candy, the movie Rob was like obsessed with that
690460	691460	show.
691460	693500	I'll pull that, which I deeply appreciate to this day.
693500	696580	However, the reality is like, how often do I really pop in those discs?
696580	700660	I just don't because now it's more about, I want to watch something.
700660	702220	Let's go to Netflix.
702220	703220	Right.
703220	704220	Yeah.
704660	708500	For anybody that listens to shaking and crying, cheap plug, cause that just came back.
708500	713160	Uh, Victoria told me that I had to let my homework assignment was to watch abducted
713160	721260	in plain sight, which yes, which wow, wow is all I have to say, wow.
721260	722260	That's all I have to say about that.
722260	726280	My wife watched that and she wanted me to watch it, but I was like, no, Victoria told
726280	730160	me it was like the beginning about like, yeah, and the parents didn't call for five days.
730160	731160	Like it'll blow your mind.
731160	732160	I'm like, why wouldn't they do it?
732200	737320	You just have to watch the movie and I, wow, that was, I was not ready for that.
737320	740840	So anyway, sorry, I didn't mean to be like glowing movie critic here, but that is, I
740840	744000	mean, but that conversation, it wasn't like, Oh, I got to go buy this Blu-ray or, Oh, I
744000	746840	got to go, you know, to the store or I got to go rent this.
746840	747840	I got to go to the rental store.
747840	750460	It's just, Oh, I'm going to log out of Netflix and get it, you know?
750460	756160	And that's why places like CBS all access with their Twilight zone remake and all this
756160	758680	stuff that, you know, looks, looks really good.
759320	763600	And, you know, everybody else wants to do all of their subscription things, right?
763600	767920	And then video game consoles have been a great way to kind of house all that in one, especially
767920	770040	these smart ones to kind of bring all that together.
770040	773580	Now here's, here's comes the game part, right?
773580	777320	Because music did it, TV did it.
777320	778960	How long before games do it?
778960	783320	And you already see a lot of companies dipping their toe in the water of this, right?
783320	787720	Like Microsoft very clearly is pushing this game pass thing.
787720	788720	That's what they want to do.
788720	792840	And they, they, they see this and Microsoft's like, Oh, I kind of want to be, you know,
792840	798200	we want to be like the Netflix video games, um, Nintendo to some extent for better, for
798200	801840	worse, doing it with their classic library on switch online.
801840	802840	Right.
802840	803840	Yeah.
803840	807360	But like, look at a lot of the games that like everybody's talking about right now.
807360	809000	It's like free stuff.
809000	810840	It's not like 60.
810840	813200	I mean, someone, I just want to buy Apex.
813200	815080	Everybody's talking about crackdown three.
815080	816960	They were pushing game pass on that.
816960	820280	And they're like, well, you could just purchase game pass and you get this for this or you
820280	821280	can buy the full thing.
821280	823380	I'm like, well, I'm just going to buy the full thing.
823380	826280	But to be honest, I probably could have just bought game pass for that.
826280	830120	Um, I just didn't know, like, I don't know if it works on PC yet.
830120	834360	Like I know a lot of stuff is crossed by, so you would think, okay, because it's available
834360	839080	in game pass, this should be available on PC to be able to download.
839080	841160	But I wasn't sure if that's a thing yet.
841160	843880	So I didn't purchase the game pass that way.
843880	846400	But um, having finished crackdown.
846400	847400	Yeah.
847400	848400	Yeah.
848400	849400	Lots of comments in chat on this subject.
849400	850400	Crystal skies.
850400	851400	80 says I did that with Anthem.
851400	856040	So I know some people are just buying that month subscription to the service because
856040	859480	maybe they feel like, Oh, I'm only going to really play Anthem for a month and then I'll
859480	860720	move over to the next big thing.
860720	861720	Right.
861720	864400	Like I feel like these types of services are made for people like me that just like don't
864400	866200	have gaming attention span.
866200	867200	Right.
867200	868200	Um, let's see.
868240	873160	200 Matt says I used to collect DVDs and Blu-rays not so much anymore with the instant gratification
873160	874440	I get from streaming it.
874440	876160	And not to, I think that's important too.
876160	880640	Like collectibles collectors, like definitely like, I'm not saying like kill Blu-rays.
880640	881640	Netflix is the only way.
881640	882640	I'm not saying that at all actually.
882640	887200	Cause like as collectibles as I will still even pick up a CD once in a while, but you
887200	892240	know where I'll pick up a CD at a concert with the artists there about ready to sign
892240	896440	it as like a memory, a collectible of that night or of that experience type of thing.
896440	897440	Right.
897680	898680	I don't buy CDs anymore.
898680	901760	Um, it was just because it's the way I listen to my music in my car.
901760	907680	Um, but I will purchase like MP3s directly from the artists and stuff a lot of times.
907680	912760	Like one artist I, I'm fawning over right now is the band Gunship.
912760	916440	So I tend to buy a lot of their albums and stuff all digitally.
916440	921920	And so they're getting all of the profit from that and their merch and all that kind of
921920	922920	stuff.
922920	926160	So I don't know, that seems to be the better way for me to do it because I can find music
926160	931880	online and I can purchase directly from the artists I used to though what I used to like
931880	936680	back before, you know, the internet was fast and everything was going to a lot of these
936680	944400	record stores and buying the like compilation, like trance electronica type things.
944400	946880	Cause that introduced me to more artists and stuff.
946880	951000	And then I could go search those artists out on, you know, which is funny because it's
951000	955120	like Spotify to me now is these playlists that are all curated by Spotify and it's like,
955120	958140	here's some of the artists you like with a few others mixed in we think you'd like.
958140	963880	And I got to say, like, I like, I've discovered like a lot of great music because of that,
963880	965400	that I really do like.
965400	969000	So I mean, not to like endorse somebody that's not paying for an advertisement, but it's,
969000	970000	it is what it is.
970000	971000	Right.
971000	972000	That's kind of how it goes now.
972000	976960	So, and, um, funny enough, this whole show starting around dance, dance revolution and
976960	980720	music game culture, where did all that music from DDR come from in the beginning that dance
980720	985760	mania compilation, like the trance, but for, you know, silly dance music that was popular
985760	986760	overseas.
986760	988320	So it's kind of funny.
988320	989320	Yeah.
989320	990320	So that's pretty awesome.
990320	994160	Anyway, we deviated a little bit from the whole like steam doing movies, but I guess
994160	997320	this maybe all comes back to like, you know, maybe if steam had done something, it was
997320	1001120	a little more subscription based or maybe something with original content.
1001120	1005280	But I also, I just feel like steam in this kind of era, I don't know if they've really
1005280	1009120	been doing it so much lately, but there's definitely a type of a time when steam was
1009120	1011160	just kind of like, Oh, we're just going to throw that in.
1011160	1012280	We're going to throw that in there.
1012280	1014200	We're going to throw in the movies and do that.
1014200	1019560	Well, the broadcasting too, do you guys remember steam has a whole like Twitch TV competitor
1019560	1024760	thing built into it, like steam broadcasting, even though he remembers that and why not?
1024760	1025960	Because they don't push it.
1025960	1031880	Steam just kind of, Hey, and maybe, you know, I don't, it may not be a space that they want
1031880	1032880	to get into.
1032880	1037720	I don't want to like hammer this into the ground, but maybe this is a drawback about
1037720	1040960	the way valve is structured in general, right?
1040960	1042760	You've heard this about valve, right?
1042760	1044840	Nobody has a title at valve.
1044840	1047320	Nobody has like primary responsibilities at valve.
1047320	1048880	They find something they want to work on.
1048880	1049880	It's just Gabe.
1049880	1053640	And then everybody else say, you guys might remember how I work at my job.
1053640	1054880	I find things I want to work on.
1054880	1059720	You guys might remember a long time ago when that, uh, employee manual from valve leaked
1059720	1064080	and who knows if it was intentional or not, but it describes a lot of this type of culture.
1064080	1071120	Maybe this is part of where there's a little bit of an issue because nobody is really designated
1071120	1076740	as, Oh, you're the guy that's going to make sure that broadcasting goes a step further
1076740	1080880	on steam or you're the guy that's going to make sure we make a lot of us are working
1080880	1081880	on half-life three.
1081880	1082880	No water.
1082880	1083880	It's not coming out.
1083880	1084880	Jeez.
1084880	1088360	So I thought you were working on it and I thought you were working on it.
1088360	1089360	I don't know.
1089360	1091380	That's just, that's just kind of my thought on steam.
1091380	1096600	Let me get a few more, uh, chat comments here in, uh, our chat, um, over Twitch TV slash
1096600	1097600	VOG network.
1097600	1103900	Miltonius games says, uh, it's hard now being more selective in what I put in my house while
1103900	1106500	also wanting to support smaller things.
1106500	1108700	That's why I like Twitch subs and Patrion.
1108700	1109940	Yeah, for sure.
1109940	1111540	Like, you know, and this is a great way.
1111540	1115820	Like obviously we are, we love you guys that do the subs and the biddies and stuff.
1115820	1119740	It does go a long way in running this as a business and helping us to grow and attend
1119740	1120740	more conventions, stuff like that.
1120740	1123900	But to, to spare you that whole line, like obviously that's a great way to really reach
1123900	1129260	out and directly affect, you know, creators and so forth.
1129260	1133340	Metal mayhem says, aside from some stuff that steam has given away for free, I never grabbed
1133340	1136660	any videos from steam, especially since most are streaming only.
1136660	1140020	If I were to pay money for digital videos, it'll be through iTunes or whatever, at least
1140020	1142000	there I can download videos.
1142000	1143000	There's a good point too.
1143000	1147480	If, if steam wasn't really letting you keep it on your own drive to like build up a collection
1147480	1151960	when your internet goes down or something like then, you know, that ownership I think
1151960	1152960	is important to some people.
1152960	1154400	I think that's a really good point.
1154400	1159280	So I'm pretty sure I had movies through like ultraviolet or something, but hell if I remember
1159280	1163200	what my, you, you did hear the news, the ultraviolet like, yeah, I don't care though.
1163200	1165360	I don't even care what movies I had on there.
1165360	1167720	There's a blue Ray over there on the counter and I was just looking at, I'm like, there's
1167720	1169400	a ultraviolet sticker on this.
1169400	1173880	I wonder if like Alan or I ever like redeem that.
1173880	1176720	There's so many people that probably never even bothered to redeem their digital copies.
1176720	1177720	I don't care.
1177720	1180160	Like at this point it's like, who cares?
1180160	1185800	Well, because now, I mean, I have, I have one goo or I have one movie on, on a Google
1185800	1186800	play movies.
1186800	1187800	What's that?
1187800	1191480	I have a elf because they gave it away for free one time.
1191480	1196680	I have a few movies on iTunes because they're all movies that I did shadowcast stuff with.
1196680	1199080	So I have Rocky horror picture show on iTunes.
1199080	1200920	I have clue the movie on iTunes.
1200920	1206700	I have repo the genetic opera on iTunes because it's great because you can go and any scene
1206700	1210900	like, on my phone, I can go and it's like, okay, we want to look at this one scene or
1210900	1211900	whatever.
1211900	1212900	It's just like right there.
1212900	1214260	And so that is extremely useful.
1214260	1217780	Um, but that's about, you know, the most that I've used that stuff for.
1217780	1220340	But anyway, so, um, I know there's like another part.
1220340	1221340	Yes.
1221340	1225720	So other stuff, since that's going away, well, what's, what's going in its place or what
1225720	1227700	other things are they adding to the service?
1227700	1233900	Well, one thing that they're going to be adding is, um, next VR virtual reality broadcasts.
1233900	1239540	So these are basically like broadcasts of different events like, uh, I see, uh, NHL
1239540	1245360	ICC soccer games, WWE matches, um, concerts and whatnot.
1245360	1250180	And so you can actually kind of have a view from, you know, court side or whatever.
1250180	1254500	And you can kind of look around as, um, like you're right there.
1254500	1256700	Um, so it's going to be available.
1256700	1261340	I think it's just like a software package that they're selling, um, but they're going
1261340	1267260	to basically allow you to, um, use your Vive or, you know, windows mixed reality headset
1267260	1269460	to watch this stuff on steam.
1269460	1272320	Um, that's cool.
1272320	1277820	Like it's nice to see VR in applications that aren't just games, you know, the real world
1277820	1278820	stuff.
1278820	1282580	And I kind of think this is the type of market that VR would be even, even more, you know,
1282580	1286780	get more exposure and stuff for, and why Facebook got on in the business of VR as well.
1286780	1291400	But, um, I digress it's, it's interesting though, that steam on the one hand, right
1291400	1295300	as they're saying, you know what, we're kind of done with this movies is yet welcoming
1295300	1300540	in, let's do this live broadcast and you know, event type broadcasting with the, you know,
1300540	1305980	same things people do pay-per-view for wrestling matches, concerts, and so forth when steam
1305980	1311180	hasn't really showed that they really go all in on anything like steam has broadcasting,
1311180	1316580	but it's surprising to this, like at like, can like not necessarily conventions there's
1316580	1322180	but like at arenas and stuff like actually have you pay subscription service to see all
1322180	1326660	of the shows that are at this arena, you know, from home and then virtual, I guess they'd
1326660	1327660	lose a lot of money that way.
1327660	1331500	And that's probably why they probably, I mean, arenas make a lot of money from food and you
1331500	1332500	know, everything else.
1332500	1337540	But I, I, I w but if you think of, I mean, if you think about like WrestleMania or something
1337540	1340780	like that, you know, once it sells out or whatever wrestling about, once it sells out,
1340780	1344200	they sell the pay-per-view so they'll, they'll still sell more seats and stuff.
1344200	1345900	But I think a subscription for that.
1345900	1350380	I mean, sure, it sounds great, but I don't know if finding, I mean, these, these stars
1350380	1352700	make a lot of money to do these live appearances.
1352700	1356440	So it'd be, it would be an expensive ticket if nothing else, you know, think about what
1356440	1360140	somebody is paying for a season ticket to like for the Kings game or something, you
1360140	1361140	know, they ain't cheap.
1361140	1362140	Well, I don't know.
1362140	1363140	Anyway.
1363140	1364140	All right.
1364140	1365140	Well, we'll see.
1365140	1368500	I'd be curious to see, you know, if steam actually kind of throws their back into this.
1368500	1372740	I mean, I know they have an interest in this to revive or if they just kind of half-ass
1372740	1378940	it or, um, you know, let's put this on other platforms like the PlayStation virtual reality
1378940	1379940	headset.
1379940	1380940	It'd be nice.
1380940	1385420	Um, in chat, um, Miltonius game says arena digital tickets will probably happen to be
1385420	1386420	fair.
1386420	1388660	I mean, short the subscription, maybe you're talking about the subscription thing he's
1388660	1393820	talking about, but as far as like, it kind of already happens, be it, you know, the football
1393820	1397580	game is on TV and it's being subsidized by advertising.
1397580	1399100	You're paying for it by watching ads, right?
1399100	1402420	When you watch the super bowl or the NFL or something like that.
1402540	1406860	Whether you're watching the NFL on Twitter or on NBC or whatever, you're, you're subsidizing
1406860	1407860	it with ads.
1407860	1408860	So you're still paying for it one way or the other.
1408860	1409860	Right.
1409860	1414260	Um, which is why if they don't sell X number of seats, if you get the blackout, right.
1414260	1417740	And you can't watch it because they want to fill up the arena first, but sure.
1417740	1422180	If they can find a way to, to milk it, to squeeze the toothpaste thing until it's completely
1422180	1424380	out, of course they'll sell more seats, but they're done.
1424380	1426060	They're not really, they do that for like sporting events.
1426060	1429140	They don't really, and like WrestleMania and boxing and stuff like that, but they don't
1429140	1430140	really do it for concerts.
1430460	1436100	Disney on ice or yeah, but like, well, once in a while it'll be like, Oh, but this last
1436100	1441100	concert on the tour they filmed for the blue Ray, you know, the, or, or that there might
1441100	1445860	be a pay-per-view event or something, but not every show, but it's, it's interesting.
1445860	1450540	It'd be interesting to see what next VR is kind of market would be for that and, and
1450540	1452020	what it might develop with that.
1452020	1457380	So, um, SSG100 Matt in our chat says there's going to be a war when it comes to live sports
1457380	1458420	and VR.
1458420	1461540	So much money is involved that it's going to explode very quickly.
1461540	1462540	Yeah.
1462540	1466980	I'll be so interesting in probably five years to look back on shows like this and what we
1466980	1471820	were thinking of VR then, because I think especially as that VR, you know, we got in
1471820	1476140	a little bit of a spirited exchange about VR last week on the show and, and, you know,
1476140	1480300	Jamie had brought up some concerns about like, you know, the big, the big like headset and
1480300	1481740	everything you kind of have to put on your head.
1481740	1483540	And I'm kind of like, I feel like that.
1483540	1484540	Sure.
1484540	1485540	Sure.
1485540	1486540	I mean, that makes a lot of sense now.
1486540	1490100	I don't like wearing that PlayStation headset even for an extended period of time, but you
1490100	1495240	know, the technology is going to be there in just five, 10 years wait, where it's just
1495240	1499700	like a little set of glasses, like swim goggles that you put on, and it's going to be able
1499700	1500700	to show VR.
1500700	1505980	And if you don't believe me, think about the desktop computer from 1995 that you had and
1505980	1510500	what these little cell phone guys can do now, you know, it's crazy.
1510500	1514260	So how fast technology advances and so forth.
1514260	1516060	So Bobby Black Wolf does point out.
1516060	1518680	So to be fair, next VR has been around for years.
1518680	1521380	It was even available for the Vive, just not on Steam.
1521380	1522820	It was on Vive port.
1522820	1524740	It's been an Oculus thing since 2015.
1524740	1529940	Well, certainly Steam going in there is now like, here's a chance to put it in front of
1529940	1534580	gamers and go into this audience and why not do gaming events?
1534580	1535580	Shit.
1535580	1537820	Esports getting more, more and more, right?
1537820	1542060	Especially as Overwatch League's really taken off, Dota, huge worldwide.
1542980	1545340	And Steam has a big thing for that.
1545340	1548900	So you know, that would be a great thing for them to do possibly with the VR.
1548900	1551940	But will they, will they go all in like that?
1551940	1553180	We don't know.
1553180	1554180	That's up to Valve, I guess.
1554180	1555180	Yeah.
1555180	1556180	All right.
1556180	1557180	So anyway, enough about that.
1557180	1559260	Let's move on because we have other stories to talk about, but of course we get to talk
1559260	1562380	about our own gaming weeks as well and the types of video games that we have been playing
1562380	1563380	this week.
1563380	1564860	So Loki, how was your gaming week?
1564860	1565860	It was all right.
1565860	1567200	I did play a few things.
1567200	1570420	So I finally got around to playing Tetris 99 and that was okay.
1570460	1571900	I played that for a bit.
1571900	1575860	Um, it's a little frustrating though, cause it's like, you kept coming in 80th place.
1575860	1577180	Well, yeah, that too.
1577180	1579540	But like, um, I didn't mean to shade you.
1579540	1583500	No, it's just like, it's just random, like garbage, like just comes on the screen all
1583500	1584500	the time.
1584500	1585500	I mean, and I get it.
1585500	1586500	That's the point of it.
1586500	1589620	But like, it seems like the whole targeting other people and stuff is pretty much useless.
1589620	1593380	Like I just said, it's a default to like whoever's attacking or whatever, but there's like, seems
1593380	1595780	no strategy whatsoever to that at all.
1595780	1599860	So I'll give a shout out, um, to, um, somebody who I know has listened to OLR in the past
1599900	1603660	and has had a lot of success on Twitch streaming this, but Kevin DDR, if you're out there,
1603660	1604660	howdy, howdy.
1604660	1606980	I'm glad to see you're doing very well for yourself on Twitch.
1606980	1610300	And uh, he streams a lot of this Tetris 99 because he was playing all like, it's the
1610300	1611660	same creators that made the grand master.
1611660	1615900	You know, he's done very well with that with the, um, um, Oh my God, why is the name of
1615900	1618060	that speed games done quick?
1618060	1619060	Yeah.
1619060	1620060	I knew it would come to me.
1620060	1623740	My brain's getting slower in my old age, but anyway, um, it's the same company that, that
1623740	1625660	made those games made this Tetris 99.
1625660	1629700	And so I've been watching his stream a little bit here that I've been lurking and uh, you
1629740	1633900	know, he's kind of explained some of like why he might target a certain way or do like
1633900	1634900	what he's doing.
1634900	1638340	And I've actually kind of learned a little bit just like watching him because the dude's
1638340	1642340	a pro when it comes to Tetris and he's, he does very well in his wins on that.
1642340	1646940	So kind of interesting how you can like learn about the game stuff from watching people
1646940	1647940	on Twitch and stuff.
1647940	1648940	Yeah.
1648940	1652100	Back in the day it was come over to my house and watch me beat level three, three when
1652100	1653100	you could do it.
1653100	1654740	And you know, now it's Twitch.
1654740	1655740	Yeah.
1655740	1657620	So I did play a little bit of that and it was all right.
1657860	1662900	I tried out the demo for Daemon X Machina and I was bored with that.
1662900	1668260	I am not picking up that game, which is disappointing because I like armored core and stuff, but
1668260	1670540	I just didn't find this game too exciting.
1670540	1672120	I'm curious why bored?
1672120	1677020	You just, just, it just, it was very slow paced and it seemed like that everything was
1677020	1679420	kind of lock on targeting type stuff.
1679420	1687380	It just didn't have the kind of, uh, action and, um, I don't know.
1687380	1693860	It wasn't paced as well as like armored core where it was like pretty fast paced and dashing
1693860	1694860	around stuff.
1694860	1698540	It was more of like, okay, fly around and shoot a thing and okay.
1698540	1703180	And I don't know, it was all right, but I am not planning on picking it up, which is
1703180	1708680	this point because it looked pretty awesome originally, but, um, I did mostly play this
1708680	1713500	week, uh, crackdown three, uh, I didn't get the stream many of it, but I finished the
1713500	1714500	game.
1714500	1718860	It was very short, but I mean, it's crackdown and crackdown was very short as well.
1718860	1722180	They, they want you to play through it multiple times, I guess.
1722180	1725900	I don't know if I'm going to do that, but I'm at the point now where I was just trying
1725900	1732180	to a hundred percent, everything max out my, uh, agent, but I don't know how long I'm actually
1732180	1733300	gonna play around with that.
1733300	1735900	Cause it's getting to the point now where it's boring.
1735900	1741620	Even like with like some of the later levels, all they do is just throw more things at your
1741620	1742620	way.
1742620	1747180	And it's like artificially trying to increase the difficulty by just throwing like, okay,
1747180	1749300	now there's 30 people attacking you at once.
1749300	1750300	Okay.
1750300	1751300	Well, they're not even harder to kill.
1751300	1755700	It's just, I'm getting shot by like every little thing in all sides and somehow they're
1755700	1760540	able to track me even though they can't see me and it's just ridiculous stuff like that.
1760540	1763420	But there's not much of a penalty for dying.
1763420	1764420	You just kind of respawn.
1764420	1769180	And especially with the boss fights, you respond, the boss is just like, Oh, Hey, the boss followed
1769180	1770180	me.
1770580	1774420	I'm here and the boss is flying around or something and, and even like the end boss
1774420	1778620	in the game was just very kind of, that's it.
1778620	1779900	This is your big boss.
1779900	1781260	It's pretty lame.
1781260	1782340	Okay.
1782340	1787220	And then they hint at something like, I don't know if it's from the earlier games because
1787220	1793760	I have played cracked in one and two, um, but like they hint at some, like there's like
1793760	1799060	some guys severed arm and I'm supposed to know who the fuck this person is.
1799060	1803540	And like, he's supposed to be the guy that's like kind of controlling everything, but then
1803540	1805140	there's like, it doesn't go anywhere.
1805140	1806940	It's just, you finish the game and you're done.
1806940	1812340	And it's like, stay tuned for the DLC or like sequel.
1812340	1813700	I mean cracked up in form.
1813700	1815420	I got the way another 12 years for that.
1815420	1818640	I mean like, I don't know what they were trying to do with that.
1818640	1825620	And I mean, I guess my bad if I don't remember the first and second game that well, I know
1825620	1830580	like, I think some of the agents that were in the first game are like DNA things that
1830580	1832100	you can find in the new game.
1832100	1836100	And I, maybe that's the same with the second game as well, but I remember there were some
1836100	1840740	like agent Rodriguez or something like that, that were in the first game.
1840740	1843020	Um, but I don't know.
1843020	1847040	It's just kind of, it's just cracked down.
1847040	1848040	It's what it is.
1848040	1852180	It's very, I had very low expectations for it and it's kind of, I don't know.
1852180	1857500	It was entertaining, but now that I've finished it within like a week, I kind of wish, gee,
1857500	1863620	that game pass would have been a, you know, a worthy investment because this game isn't
1863620	1866380	very long and the multiplayer, I have no interest in playing.
1866380	1868020	I was just about to ask about multiplayer.
1868020	1869580	I haven't played the multiplayer yet.
1869580	1870580	I could try that.
1870580	1872140	I guess I've watched people play it online.
1872140	1878540	I hear it's kind of lame just because it ends up being, um, since you can see the other
1878540	1881460	players at all times on the map.
1881460	1885940	So like you can see the Reddit, like where they are, even through buildings and stuff
1885940	1891700	so that it ends up being whoever gets to the homing missiles first wins because it's just
1891700	1893700	you homing missile, homing missiles all the time.
1893700	1897020	Oh, so there's no like, there's no way you can hide or there's no stealth in it.
1897020	1898280	No weird.
1898280	1899380	So I don't know.
1899380	1903700	I'll try, but it's not something like I'm very excited about.
1903700	1904700	Co-op might be fun.
1904700	1908340	If I had someone to play with, it'd be kind of fun, but you know, my character is maxed
1908340	1912820	out and you can restart the game with your character maxed out.
1912820	1916000	I don't know why I would want to do that other than, Oh, now I can rush just straight to
1916000	1919340	the end and just kill the boss and be done.
1919340	1920340	I don't know.
1920340	1921340	We'll see.
1921340	1926300	I'm kind of getting over this already, but it was fun while it lasted.
1926300	1927300	All right.
1927300	1930300	I'm going to go and that's about it.
1930300	1931300	Um, okay.
1931300	1932900	For my week, Pokemon go as well.
1932900	1935340	They had that special little clam Pearl day.
1935340	1936340	I got one of those.
1936340	1940500	I had, I had family stuff, so I couldn't really like go the whole three hours, but they really
1940500	1943340	improved on that Phoebus event, which was a similar thing.
1943340	1946040	Um, a couple of months ago they did, they really improved on it.
1946040	1949140	Like the quests were much more manageable and it was nice that they kind of changed
1949140	1950620	the spawns during that time as well.
1950620	1954500	So I caught two shinies only getting to play for like an hour and a half.
1954500	1955820	So I was pretty happy with it.
1955820	1960940	Um, and, uh, I just wish, like, I don't want there to be a Pokemon go thing every freaking
1960940	1961940	weekend.
1961940	1962940	You know what I mean?
1962940	1966140	Like, I don't, I wish they would just do like one weekend a month and that's it.
1966140	1971620	You know, and then don't, don't give us more than like a few days before, you know, cause
1971620	1975300	they only announced it on like Tuesday or Wednesday that, Hey, this Saturday is going
1975300	1976300	to be a big event.
1976300	1977300	And it's like, you know,
1977300	1981140	Or do them at different times, like shuffle the times around to like,
1981140	1982140	Be careful what you ask for.
1982140	1985860	Cause that next community day, the next community day they're doing is Trico and it's going
1985860	1990300	to be a March 23rd and it's from 3 PM to 6 PM.
1990300	1992260	So they're doing it more in the evening.
1992260	1993780	Well that's, and that's our time.
1993780	1996180	So East coasters, that's going to be 6 PM to 9 PM.
1996180	1997180	That's like at night.
1997180	2001500	So it's going to be a little weird, I think, but here's, so a lot of people don't understand
2001500	2003140	the why behind it.
2003140	2007400	And I'm not saying this is the reason, but I am saying this is quite the coincidence.
2007400	2011240	So their other game Niantic's other game, Ingress, which you all know I've followed
2011240	2012420	for a long time.
2012420	2017940	Um, Ingress is having a big, uh, what they call anomaly event, which is their live events.
2017940	2021220	Now obviously they're not nearly as big as what happens in Pokemon go, but they are events
2021220	2024900	that take that game's resources, um, in cities around the world.
2024900	2029060	So in the U S it happens to be on that day, uh, funny enough, Atlanta, uh, where our pal
2029060	2032420	Bobby's at is one of the cities and Las Vegas is the other.
2032420	2038860	So that event runs from, I think it's 10 AM until either 1 PM or 2 PM.
2038860	2045040	But that event is already in the block where, uh, community day would usually be.
2045040	2047660	So how about you just don't do a community day next week?
2047660	2049780	That's, I mean, that would have been my answer.
2049780	2053460	Like I can't explain why they insist on doing them the same day, but I was going to say
2053460	2055580	there's a lot of Ingersers that also play Pokemon go.
2055580	2059060	That'd be kind of pissed because you really have to focus when it's anomaly time.
2059060	2062220	Cause that's, you know, player, very, very intense player versus player stuff.
2062220	2063220	Right.
2063220	2066500	Um, so, uh, you don't want to be over there catching Pokemon.
2066500	2070380	So they probably scattered out the times a little bit so people could do both, but why
2070380	2072300	did they feel the need to do?
2072300	2075140	I don't think any Ingress player would have been upset.
2075140	2077940	And to be fair, there's far less Ingress players, Pokemon go players.
2077940	2078980	I get that.
2078980	2082700	But you also have to consider resources on Niantic system and so forth because lots of
2082700	2084620	Ingress players will be logged in at that time.
2084620	2089180	But anyway, um, I'm just surprised they just didn't do it a different, do it on the Sunday.
2089180	2093940	You know, I was going to stop and say, Oh, I got to catch Trico because dude, it's Trico.
2093940	2094940	Yeah.
2094940	2097180	Uh, Bobby and Chad is asking Rob, so you flying out?
2097180	2098180	No, no, I'm not.
2098180	2099180	Nothing that great.
2099180	2105500	Well, I guess maybe a little that crazy because it is why I am going to Chicago in may, uh,
2105500	2106700	Memorial day weekend.
2106700	2110620	They're doing a big event in Chicago, but the thing about Chicago that makes it special
2110620	2114220	is that whereas I mentioned there's cities around the world in Las Vegas, Atlanta, or
2114220	2119420	two of them in that weekend in may, Memorial day weekend in Chicago, that is the only one
2119420	2120640	is Chicago.
2120640	2121640	That's it.
2121640	2124400	And then they're doing another mega anomaly in Asia somewhere.
2124400	2125740	One of the other weekends.
2125740	2128500	So um, that's part of the reason I'm going to Chicago.
2128500	2131140	And the fact I just know like people in Chicago always have a good time there.
2131140	2136020	So um, yeah, anyway, I didn't mean to digress an Ingress tangent, but I guess I did.
2136020	2140220	But it also, I think explains why maybe they're changing things up in Pokemon go.
2140220	2144580	Um, other games I played this week, uh, I've continued to play things like world of Warcraft,
2144580	2150140	of course, and kingdom hearts three at Tetris 99 is still fun for me.
2150140	2154820	Um, but I did play some, well, I played some old stuff and some new stuff.
2154820	2156180	So here's the old thing.
2156180	2160380	So my buddy Delvin or VG realness, uh, who's probably in chat right now.
2160380	2166140	I saw a minute ago, uh, convinced me to start a fantasy star online character.
2166140	2167140	Yes.
2167140	2173380	Fancy star online from like 2000, uh, which I think blue burst went offline in like 2007.
2173380	2177780	But of course, thanks to the wonders of homegrown servers and how they, so there's still servers
2177780	2180140	where you can play fantasy star online to this day.
2180140	2185740	Um, like the dream cast one, uh, this one's, this one's all powered on, I'm sure that exists,
2185740	2190100	but the one I'm playing is all powered on blue burst, uh, the piece that they had, which
2190140	2193660	is the same, it's the same game, but blue burst had episode four.
2193660	2197980	So there's actually kind of like more, so the PC probably got the biggest version, so
2197980	2198980	to speak.
2198980	2203020	Um, so he convinced me to roll a character there and I was playing that actually Friday
2203020	2206340	night on my personal stream over at Rob Roberts on Twitch.
2206340	2207900	We went for like four hours.
2207900	2211420	We were, I was playing like all night Friday, started a character from scratch, got all
2211420	2212940	the way up to like level 11.
2212940	2213940	We were having a good time.
2213940	2214940	Bobby joined us for a little while.
2214940	2215940	Uh, it was fun.
2215940	2216940	Yeah.
2216940	2221140	Um, we'll probably stream that again at some point because I, as much as I would like play
2221140	2226340	fantasy star online, I would get through like forest, maybe a little bit of caves.
2226340	2227820	I think I got to the third one.
2227820	2229340	What's the third one ruins or something.
2229340	2235380	I think I got as far as that, but like I've never actually beat fantasy star online.
2235380	2238740	So Delvin's like, no, we're doing this.
2238740	2242060	We're going to, we're going to, this is going to be a series on Twitch.
2242060	2243460	We're going to beat this damn game.
2243460	2246580	So I'm like, okay, I'm kind of into it because fantasy star is fun.
2246580	2249520	Playing with friends is fun and talking and stuff is always a good time.
2249520	2250900	So I've been enjoying that.
2250900	2256460	So living it up like it's the year 2000, but I did play new stuff as well.
2256460	2257460	Okay.
2257460	2262620	So I finally, after all the talk about it for like three weeks, I went into my first
2262620	2264300	apex legends matches.
2264300	2265300	Okay.
2265300	2269100	So I did it not only on PlayStation four, but I also played on PC.
2269100	2274180	So I did, um, I did a match on each and, uh, it was, it was funny.
2274180	2278100	You know what the, on the PlayStation four match I did, we came in fourth.
2278100	2279100	Not bad.
2279100	2280100	Right.
2280100	2281100	Out of like 20 teams.
2281100	2282100	So here's the thing.
2282100	2286380	So like I noticed because I was a level one player, I was getting matched with people
2286380	2291900	on my squad that were like level 24, level 26, like I was getting matched with like high
2291900	2292900	level people.
2292900	2293900	Right.
2293900	2297860	So I was just like, I'm just going to follow and like what I thought was so, so I played
2297860	2302140	lifeline when I played on PlayStation four and, um, I was just like, it's like, you are
2302140	2303140	the jump master.
2303140	2304140	I was like, the fuck I am.
2304140	2306580	I, I, cause there's a button you can press to pass it to somebody else.
2306580	2307900	I'm like, I don't know where to land us.
2307900	2309520	So that's the nice thing is you can pass somebody else.
2309520	2313140	But I will say one thing I really did like about apex legends, nobody was really talking
2313140	2316100	at all on the headsets, which is fine because people could be shitty.
2316100	2318180	Um, but they were using that ping.
2318180	2321260	Like it was like, I was like, they like were paying and everything paying.
2321260	2322260	There's a gun over here.
2322260	2323260	Ping.
2323260	2326260	And the nice way it's built into the game is that the characters like talk about the
2326260	2328060	pings, you know, and so forth.
2328060	2332060	And like, let's say somebody pinged a gun, like bloodhound might go like, there's a gun
2332060	2333060	over here.
2333060	2334940	However, bloodhounds accents, very unique.
2334940	2336780	Uh, you know, it says like, there's going to be here.
2336780	2340800	And then if you go pick up the gun, you can, you'll say, press down to thank bloodhound
2340800	2341800	and see press down.
2341800	2343420	And then, you know, lifeline will be like, thank you.
2343420	2345340	I needed that or whatever, you know, she says.
2345340	2347500	So it was kind of, kind of fun in that regard.
2347500	2352260	So yeah, all I did, I just kind of like, I just ran with my, I was just like, okay, when
2352260	2354100	you're a new player, just stick with your squad.
2354100	2355100	Right.
2355100	2358100	That's the thing that annoys veteran players is when new people get in there and think
2358100	2360060	like, just run off crazy.
2360060	2361060	So I stayed with my people.
2361060	2362060	I don't wait.
2362060	2366020	I was like, okay, when I see people show up, I'll put down the little drone and we did
2366020	2367020	okay for ourselves.
2367020	2370940	I got to say, I got to give props to the, the Wraith and our match because it was me,
2370940	2375580	a bloodhound or lifeline bloodhound Wraith and myself and bloodhound died.
2375580	2380560	Wraith fucking went back, saved us when all the way to one of those respawn points to
2380560	2382500	bring us back into the match.
2382500	2383500	Like she was a rock star.
2383500	2387620	She brought us back like, and then we were able to, that's how we got fourth place because
2387620	2391140	pretty much she was sneaking around everything to get to the respawn thing and got us back
2391140	2394180	in the match after like four more teams have been eliminated.
2394180	2395180	So that was kind of fun.
2395180	2396180	Right.
2396180	2398380	And the way I'm talking about it, it's kind of like a sports match or something.
2398380	2399380	So it was fun.
2399380	2404720	I played it on PC that time I played as bloodhound because I'm, I want to see, I want to see
2404720	2405980	some different abilities.
2405980	2407660	And I heard the tracking thing was pretty cool.
2407660	2411540	And a good thing for new players to do is that you can just keep spamming that tracking
2411540	2412540	thing.
2412540	2413540	And it's actually kind of helpful for people.
2413540	2416320	So I was like, all right, I'll try this with bloodhound, but my experience didn't go as
2416320	2422940	well on PC because the, the jump master kept launching us back in air and like would not
2422940	2424360	find a place to land.
2424360	2426960	And then of course, all of a sudden they got on the mic and then of course the two of them
2426960	2431840	got on the microphones and it was like, dude, what the fuck you're going to fucking land
2431840	2432900	this fucking thing.
2432900	2435900	What the fuck are you doing?
2435900	2440180	As people do, you know, when they go, when it's like when this microphone ends up in
2440180	2443500	their mouth, it's just instantly there, they, they go to shit.
2443500	2444500	And that's it.
2444500	2447700	So I tried to kind of do the same thing and I stuck with the team, but of course the two
2447700	2450020	of them were fighting and it was just ugly.
2450020	2451800	And how about this, Loki?
2451800	2454420	We came in 16th.
2454420	2459140	Imagine that, yeah.
2459140	2463740	So when everything was polite and using pings and they were helping me out, we get forth
2463740	2469100	when everybody's like, it's 16th, irritating.
2469100	2470100	Anyway.
2470100	2471100	All right.
2471100	2476340	Uh, going to our chat over Twitch TV, uh, slash vog network, uh, Miltonias game says,
2476340	2479740	I love that lifeline can drop helpful gear us for special power.
2479740	2481700	I can help while being bad.
2481700	2487020	Have you noticed that apex really pushes you to play lifeline?
2487020	2488440	Like and I think that's smart.
2488440	2494740	Like the game teaches you to start as a support character cause you play lifeline in the tutorial.
2494740	2498260	Lifeline is like your default character and your profile and all this.
2498260	2503580	Like the game really pushes the healer on you and she's not, I mean like you, it's not
2503580	2508660	like, it's not like you're playing, um, overwatch and like you're attacking is completely like
2508660	2509660	negated.
2509660	2512260	Like you can still fire a gun as lifeline.
2512260	2515960	It's just her ability is more around the healing and the special drops and all that.
2515960	2519600	So the game really pushes you to want to like lifeline, which I think is really smart and
2519600	2521340	probably part of the reason it's doing well.
2521340	2522940	Um, let's see.
2522940	2526800	And a metal mayhem says, Hey now race and all star gets, Oh God, he's quoting lyrics
2526800	2527800	from smash mouth.
2528240	2532940	Uh, and then it says, I had a roommate in college put on academic probation because
2532940	2535240	he skipped class to play PSL.
2535240	2536320	That was a million years ago.
2536320	2538080	He somehow graduated in the end.
2538080	2540060	Do you know like fantasy star online has come up?
2540060	2542960	Like not just on the Twitch chat, but in some of the group chats and so forth.
2542960	2547120	Do you know how many people I've talked to that are like, Oh yeah, I flunked XYZ because
2547120	2550600	of PSL like fantasy star online, like ruined lives.
2550600	2553500	It's pretty impressive, pretty impressive.
2553500	2555840	So anyway, there it is.
2555840	2560600	Uh, some old stuff and some new stuff and I had a fun week and I will continue to play
2560600	2562200	more in the coming weeks.
2562200	2563200	Yes.
2563200	2564820	So, all right, well, let's move on.
2564820	2565860	Let's get to some more gaming news.
2565860	2567440	I don't really have a lot of housekeeping.
2567440	2571160	You should continue to follow us on Twitch, Twitch, of course, at VOG network, Twitter
2571160	2572160	as well.
2572160	2576040	Uh, at OLR is where our Twitter account is that we're also on Facebook, facebook.com
2576040	2578600	slash orange lounge radio.
2578600	2581160	So let's get to some more gaming news.
2581160	2582160	Yes.
2582160	2586480	So there's an announcement from Google that's going to happen during GDC.
2586480	2594280	Um, it's on the 19th, they've got a little animated, um, image that they're talking about.
2594280	2599480	It's kind of like teasing this mysterious announcement, basically saying, you know,
2599480	2606620	gather around, uh, all will be explained on three 19 and of course this is expected to
2606620	2611660	be their announcement of their new, um, gaming platform.
2611660	2615780	So it could be a console or whatever, uh, some code name yeti.
2615780	2621180	And they've kind of dabbled with gaming stuff before with, um, they had the whole experiment
2621180	2626180	with assassin's creed, odyssey, the could stream in the Chrome browser type thing.
2626180	2630940	Um, so maybe it has something to do with that, but I guess we'll find out in about a month.
2630940	2633780	It's only, it's not that long.
2633780	2638020	So it kind of neat to see what this will be.
2638020	2639020	Any thoughts?
2639020	2640820	I know everybody's playing armchair.
2640820	2641820	I don't know.
2641820	2646220	My thought is I'm going to be underwhelmed because it always tends to be like whenever
2646220	2650740	one of these platforms comes out with, Oh, Hey, we're going to do some gaming thing.
2650740	2651740	You know what?
2651740	2657820	Whether it be like games center on the iOS and whatever Android has on the Google side
2657820	2660140	of things, Google play games or something like that.
2660140	2663780	It's just very, eh, achievements.
2663780	2664780	Yay.
2664780	2668060	It's like, don't really care.
2668540	2676180	Um, I hope it's cool, but I, I'm, my level of expectation is around Ouya Ouya level.
2676180	2681020	Well, I mean, one of the theories running around out there is that Google might be starting
2681020	2684940	their own types of game service, which tying into the beginning, you know, segment of our
2684940	2687420	show might not be such a bad idea.
2687420	2689180	It just depends on the quality of games.
2689180	2696380	Like if Google streaming games is like Farmville and match three tournament and solitaire,
2696380	2700100	I don't know if it's going to be very compelling, but if Google can sign up some partners of
2700100	2703420	some big games that people want to play, it might be a little more impressive.
2703420	2707180	But of course, you know, bandwidth is always a concern with the streaming stuff.
2707180	2711220	We didn't really get into that earlier, but a comment in our chat, a pixel pocket says
2711220	2714820	the projects stream thing worked surprisingly well.
2714820	2718740	If everyone had no data caps and high speed internet, that it would be a massive game
2718740	2719740	changer.
2719740	2723080	And Bobby Blackwell follows that up saying bandwidth caps are going to be a big issue
2723080	2725180	and not many people talk about it.
2725220	2731220	Well, until we push back on the cable companies for what we want and get those data caps inflated.
2731220	2736300	I think eventually once we get, you know, some Democratic leadership that we'll get
2736300	2740020	them outlawing data caps and that kind of stuff, it's just unfortunately, we just have
2740020	2742580	like the whole I don't even know if it has to be a political thing.
2742580	2746780	I think the political thing has to fix that whole issue with the net neutrality.
2746780	2752340	But I digress the whole when it comes to data caps, I think ultimately consumers are going
2752340	2756820	to be like, this is bullshit because of all these things that are around the popular place.
2756820	2760780	Like, you know, I remember when data caps were like a lot smaller, especially on cell
2760780	2761780	phones.
2761780	2762780	Right.
2762780	2763780	Because they're like, right.
2763780	2765300	Nobody uses over two gigs in a month.
2765300	2766380	Nobody uses two gigs in a month.
2766380	2768420	And that was like three years ago, four years ago.
2768420	2771140	Now it's like nobody uses more than 10 gigs in a month.
2771140	2776260	And of course, when I went and checked my usage on AT&T, I use 18 gigs in a month.
2776260	2778340	So thankfully I have unlimited.
2778340	2779340	That's yeah.
2779340	2780340	That's a lot.
2780340	2785380	But dude, Spotify and podcasts in the car, Ingress and Pokemon go a lot, which is always
2785380	2786380	downloading data.
2786380	2787380	Right.
2787380	2788380	Uh, you know, listening to music.
2788380	2792780	If I'm in my desk at work and streaming from there, uh, you know, you use a lot of data.
2792780	2795460	I'm always usually on wifi, so I don't tend to use that.
2795460	2796460	I don't.
2796460	2797940	My wifi, wifi at work is non-existent.
2797940	2798940	I have to be on.
2798940	2799940	Yeah.
2799940	2804060	So yeah, but I pay for it.
2804060	2805580	You sold me an unlimited plan.
2805580	2806820	I'm going to cash in.
2806820	2808100	I'm not pirating or anything.
2808100	2810260	I'm just, you know, a heavy user.
2810260	2815940	So anyway, um, well, could Google, Google, I brought up cell phones.
2815940	2817980	Google's in the cell phone arena.
2817980	2821540	Do you think they might do something with like, I don't know, something where it's like,
2821540	2826300	Oh, it's on your computer and it's on your phone through the new, you know, probably
2826300	2829860	I think if anything, they're going to do something integrated into Chrome.
2829860	2833940	Um, so yeah, I could see them doing that.
2833940	2834940	I don't know.
2835580	2839340	I actually be curious to see, I didn't actually get the play, uh, Assassin's Creed Odyssey
2839340	2840980	when they had that in Chrome.
2840980	2847420	So I don't know what the hardware requirements are for that type of stuff, but I mean, I
2847420	2848420	don't know.
2848420	2849420	We'll see.
2849420	2853140	It has to have something that I'm really interested in and just a lot of these like platforms
2853140	2854220	that they come out with.
2854220	2857720	It's just kind of like, I don't really need another platform to play like Assassin's Creed
2857720	2862620	Odyssey on or, you know, whatever else is going to be on there.
2862620	2864940	Like I have a huge steam library.
2864940	2869340	Give me something that I really want that makes it, you know, really accessible for
2869340	2870340	me to play.
2870340	2874180	Like I, for example, would love Xbox game pass.
2874180	2880420	If I could play my Xbox three 60 backwards compatible games on the PC would be pretty
2880420	2881420	awesome.
2881420	2886940	You kind of can because you use the whole, like, um, you go into the Xbox app and you
2886940	2889940	stream from your Xbox one to your PC.
2889940	2890940	I've done that.
2890940	2894540	I've played like dungeon siege three on my PC, but it's, it's really playing it on the
2894540	2895540	Xbox one.
2895540	2899420	I've tried doing that with my PlayStation four, although I haven't tried with the pro
2899420	2900420	yet though.
2900420	2904500	So I mean, that might work a little bit better with the pro, but before my original PlayStation
2904500	2909700	four, I tried doing that and it was mixed from just kind of like, okay.
2909700	2916300	And working to, it's just not working at all on my internal network in, I mean, my PlayStation's
2916300	2921740	wired directly to the router and I mean, I don't think there was that much bandwidth
2921740	2922940	traffic going on.
2922940	2928820	There's Netflix, but I mean, that shouldn't be clogging up my, you know, network that
2928820	2929820	much, but who knows?
2929820	2932900	I think bandwidth caps are going to go up again in a couple of years.
2932900	2938120	I just, I would, I would hope more providers are able to provide internet when that element
2938120	2942700	gets more competitive, which it very well might as over the air speeds and five G and
2942700	2943700	stuff.
2943700	2945340	I mean, five G is supposedly really, really fast.
2945380	2948500	I haven't been able to use it myself yet, but five G supposedly like, so waiting and
2948500	2951860	fast for fucking Verizon to get out of Sacramento to do it.
2951860	2955780	So it's, well, you mean out, out into the suburbs of Sacramento, apparently downtown.
2955780	2956780	Yes.
2956780	2957780	Yeah.
2957780	2960800	But, um, yeah, but as that stuff becomes more and more, and maybe I think that's when finally
2960800	2965220	there's going to be more competition for companies like Comcast and your, your more traditional
2965220	2969900	broadband providers is when it's so fast in the air that it competes with that.
2969900	2974940	And then that's when all that discussion on data caps and stuff will have to be reevaluated,
2974940	2975940	I suppose.
2975940	2976940	Yeah.
2976940	2977940	So we'll see.
2977940	2978940	Anyway.
2978940	2985180	Um, going into our chat at Twitch TV slash vog network, uh, Bobby points out Loki.
2985180	2986260	It depends on your router.
2986260	2989640	Some routers can't handle multiple streams like that and others can.
2989640	2992700	So if someone else is streaming Netflix and you're trying to do share play between a PS
2992700	2997540	four and PC, some routers don't have the CPU to be able to accurately handle that.
2997540	2998540	That is very true.
2998540	2999900	And I am streaming from the Xbox one.
2999900	3001740	It's like, don't try to do anything else on the internet.
3001740	3006460	Oh, I thought I had a pretty decent router, but I could always get one with more antennas
3006460	3007460	on it.
3007460	3009620	It doesn't look gamer enough yet.
3009620	3010780	Yeah, it doesn't look gamer enough.
3010780	3015380	Uh, and then a DJ Ram S in chat says, looks at Verizon router bandwidth caps.
3015380	3016380	What's that?
3016380	3017380	So, yeah, there you go.
3017380	3018380	All right.
3018380	3019520	Anyhow, let's move on to another story.
3019520	3021580	And I know a lot of people are talking about this this week.
3021580	3025860	I'm sure you guys have heard of this, but, uh, it was announced by Reggie fees and may,
3025860	3031020	uh, on a special, uh, little, uh, announcement on their Twitter channel and YouTube and all
3031020	3034340	that, uh, that Reggie fees and may plans to retire, uh, Reggie fees and may has been
3034340	3037380	with Nintendo for 15 years, if you can believe it.
3037380	3042040	Uh, and he is going to be retiring and, uh, the current senior vice president of sales
3042040	3047700	and marketing, uh, Doug Bowser will succeed Reggie as the president of Nintendo of America.
3047700	3052900	I'm sure you have heard the whole Bowser taking over Nintendo memes to death.
3052900	3057300	So I will only bug you with that, that one time, although, you know, it is, it's kind
3057300	3059980	of one of those, Oh, that's cute, but you know, it is.
3059980	3062300	It is an actual like German last name and stuff.
3062300	3066160	So, you know, it's not like, I don't think he was picked for his name that he was picked
3066160	3068580	for his town, but he is leaning into it though.
3068580	3070020	Well, yeah, he has fun.
3070020	3071020	Sure.
3071020	3073020	And I think when you're in a situation like that, you should have fun with it.
3073020	3074020	Right.
3074020	3077740	And you know, like when Doug Bowser was first tired, there was that picture of him on Twitter
3077740	3078900	and he's like, I'm happy to be here.
3078900	3079900	He's like holding a sign.
3079900	3084640	If you look very subtly, it's very subtle in the background, but there's a stuffed animals
3084640	3088980	or like whatever you call stuff, figures stuff, plushes of Mario and Luigi tied up with a
3088980	3090500	GameCube controller.
3090500	3091500	That's funny.
3091500	3094980	That's, I love that like subtleness where it's like, you look twice, you got to look
3094980	3096220	a little deeper to see that.
3096220	3101120	So, and I'm sure, I'm sure in a Nintendo direct or something, there'll be something very tongue
3101120	3103180	and cheek, but let's not forget.
3103180	3110100	Nintendo is still very much a Japanese country, the country, you know what I mean?
3110100	3111100	Company.
3111100	3112100	Thank you.
3112100	3114900	Uh, it's still very much a Japanese company and all the big, big decisions are being made
3114900	3120060	in Japan and what, you know, Reggie Fils-Aime has been doing, very charismatic, great leader
3120060	3125260	for the US and helping to get switch systems sold in the US.
3125260	3127580	That is what Reggie Fils-Aime's job has been.
3127580	3130020	And that's what, um, Doug Bowser will be doing.
3130020	3135740	Um, of course the folks over in Japan, happy to see him go, uh, Shuntaro Furukawa, who
3135740	3138860	is the current president of Nintendo said, I really appreciate everything Reggie has
3138860	3141140	done for Nintendo inside and outside our company.
3141140	3143000	Reggie is known as an exceptional leader.
3143000	3146800	We are grateful that he is leaving the business in good shape with strong momentum.
3146800	3150400	While we will miss him and we wish him the very best in his retirement, what we are also
3150400	3153800	pleased to have such an able successor ready to step into that role.
3153800	3159080	Uh, and then Reggie in his own comments said, quote, Nintendo owns a part of my heart forever.
3159080	3163160	It's a part that is filled with gratitude for the incredibly talented people I've worked
3163160	3167040	with for the opportunity to represent such a wonderful brand and most of all, to feel
3167040	3171280	like a member of the world's most positive and enduring gamer community.
3171280	3174960	As I look forward to departing in both good health and good humor, this is not game over
3174960	3180440	for me, but instead leveling up to more time with my wife, family, and friends.
3180440	3183480	And you know, uh, he's going out at the top of his game.
3183480	3187720	You know, it might be a little different story if this was during some of the Wii U years.
3187720	3191000	I don't think, I don't think it really would be that different because Reggie Fils-Aime
3191000	3195120	has always really kind of been very liked as I think a charismatic leader by gamers
3195120	3196120	and so forth.
3196120	3200560	So I think no matter when he decided he was ready to move on, uh, he, he would have gotten
3200560	3201560	a warm reception.
3201560	3206240	But certainly, you know, if he does decide he wants to do more in the future, he's going
3206240	3209800	out on the top of his game and this is a great thing, you know, in his resume that, you know,
3209800	3212200	I left when the switch was a all time success.
3212200	3217480	Um, keep in mind, Reggie Fils-Aime has not always been games, uh, before he was at Nintendo.
3217480	3218480	I believe it was at Panda express.
3218480	3221800	I don't know if that was the immediate thing, but it was certainly at some point before
3221800	3229800	there, he was, uh, uh, uh, I think he was at, uh, PEP was it Pepsi or young foods or
3229800	3230800	anything?
3230800	3231800	Perhaps.
3231800	3232800	I don't know.
3232800	3236000	I just remember that Panda, but, but anyway, I mean, you know, I, and everybody's like,
3236000	3241220	I wonder why he's leaving and there's a part of me that says, how many of you have stayed
3241220	3242960	at jobs for 15 years?
3242960	3244240	He's been there for 15 years.
3244240	3245240	I've gotten close.
3245240	3247320	I was at my last job for 14 years.
3247320	3249120	That's 14 and a half at my last job.
3249120	3250120	Yeah.
3250120	3251120	Got close.
3251120	3252680	But you know, even then it was like about the time where you're like, all right, I really
3252680	3254880	like, you know, the signs are in the air and it was one of those things where I was like,
3254880	3256120	I really need to go do something else.
3256120	3257280	And so I did.
3257280	3262420	And you know, for whatever reason, like I doubt, I doubt it's anything negative at all.
3262420	3266600	You know, Reggie, maybe he wants to do something that's not video games, you know, even you
3266600	3270320	can be a gaming fan and like things that aren't video games, right?
3270320	3271320	Yeah.
3271320	3275720	I do this gaming podcast, but I do hosting for, you know, performance shows and things
3275720	3276720	like that.
3276720	3279560	So, you know, it's gaming doesn't have to be your end all be all.
3279560	3284400	So maybe he'll want to start his own company or maybe he'll want to go to a different industry
3284400	3285400	or something.
3285400	3289440	Or maybe he really just, you know, I don't, I know he asked kids, I don't know how old
3289440	3290600	they are.
3290600	3294160	Maybe the kids are old enough to be having their own kids and he wants to be around for
3294160	3295160	that.
3295160	3296160	Or maybe he just wants to be around more.
3296160	3297160	You know what?
3297160	3298320	Let the man take a fucking vacation.
3298320	3299320	He's earned it.
3299320	3300320	Hats off to you, sir.
3300320	3301320	Yeah.
3301320	3306060	So I think it's just, you know, we, we all know, Oh yeah, this, this has to be something
3306060	3307060	that happens someday.
3307060	3312000	But then when that day a lot arrives, it's like, but why Reggie?
3312000	3315040	Don't you love me anymore?
3315040	3319680	But you know, he, his body is ready for vacation.
3319680	3321560	Body is ready for a fucking vacation.
3321560	3322760	That is absolutely right.
3322760	3324340	Let the man live.
3324340	3329480	So yeah, we can just hope he set a great example for everybody Gil, cause not every CEO in
3329480	3334800	the game industry is looked at with such a favor and fandom as somebody like Reggie visa
3334800	3335800	may.
3335800	3339080	Um, cause can you imagine what it's going to be like when Bobby Kotek retires?
3339080	3342740	Yeah, it's going to be great.
3342740	3343740	He's never going to retire though.
3343740	3346780	Cause he's making tons of fucking money.
3346780	3351580	So anyway, he has to drive the rest of the properties into the ground, which honestly
3351580	3355820	with Activision, there's not a lot left.
3355820	3361180	Uh, DJ Rama S points out Pepsi and BET as the 200 Matt says he worked for pizza hut
3361180	3362180	and Guinness.
3362180	3365000	Did he really work all those places or you guys just make us, are you guys just saying
3365000	3368660	all the cool things is PepsiCo and yum foods or whatever.
3368660	3369660	That's all like one.
3369660	3370660	Oh yeah, that's right.
3370660	3371660	Pepsi owns all that stuff.
3371660	3372660	That makes sense.
3373580	3374580	Cool.
3374580	3378460	All right, well, uh, hats off to Reggie and a best of luck, uh, in the future.
3378460	3382780	And uh, you know, other CEOs should take some cues from Reggie on how to be cool.
3382780	3383780	Super cool.
3383780	3384780	Let's move on.
3384780	3385780	What do you have for us next?
3385780	3386780	Logie.
3386780	3387780	All right.
3387780	3392980	So, um, there's this whole new kind of beginning of another adpocalypse type thing.
3392980	3399940	This was, um, due to this guy named Matt Watson who put out a viral video on YouTube, basically
3399940	3403100	explaining that there's this content out there.
3403100	3408500	It's of like kids like posting videos either like, um, you know, doing like gymnastics
3408500	3409500	or something like that.
3409500	3415980	And of course with that, there's these kind of pedo, uh, people that are watching these
3415980	3421920	videos and timestamping, you know, compromising positions and just being generally assholes.
3421920	3427520	And then of course those people also re uploading this content and sharing similar content with
3427520	3428520	each other.
3428520	3434120	So he's kind of like, Oh, exposing this, you know, whole, um, ring of stuff going on.
3434120	3440800	And of course, you know, he's been also mailing out to, uh, or, you know, going on social
3440800	3446600	media to show all these people that had like, um, ads run in front of it, the, Hey, look
3446600	3450040	at this contents on here and YouTube's not doing anything, even though they are sort
3450040	3455280	of work, you know, to get rid of it and doing it in the worst possible way as well.
3455280	3457600	Um, so yeah, I got it.
3457600	3462760	Well, I got to admit it's a tricky, it's a tricky thing because like, well, and I'm,
3462760	3465760	I have not been reading up in the story, but like, you know, if you want to put your kids
3465760	3468800	gymnastic match on YouTube, you should be able to do that right.
3468800	3475000	And any sane person that, well, here's the problem, you know, so here's the YouTube solution
3475000	3477940	by the way, and you're going to love this.
3477940	3482960	So YouTube solution to solve this problem because they can't really figure it out is
3482960	3485220	your video now can be demonetized.
3485220	3490120	You could be following all of the rules completely by the book.
3490120	3494580	Everything is a okay with your video, but if you have ass hats that are posting sicko
3494580	3499420	shit in your, uh, YouTube comments, your video is going to get demonetized.
3499420	3502020	No that can't be abused in any sort of fucking way.
3502020	3504900	What, what's happening to the sickos posting the comments?
3504900	3509940	Well, they're going to try to ban them, but at the same time, anybody can, well, they
3509940	3512340	could recreate accounts and stuff.
3512340	3513680	I mean, so I don't know.
3513680	3518320	You could, you could basically use this new method now to just attack any channel you
3518320	3522760	want to demonetize all their videos or to possibly, you know, do all sorts of strikes
3522760	3523900	or whatever.
3523900	3526320	So there's that fun bit of information.
3526320	3528480	So that's their plan right now, which is terrible.
3528480	3534760	Um, and then on top of that, all sorts of advertisers are pulling their ads from YouTube
3534760	3538640	right now because I swear if you are one of these, not that anybody, any of those people
3538640	3542840	would ever be watching this and thank God, but for those people that are doing this type
3542840	3547840	of just sick shit and you know, some of them are doing it because it's sick and they're
3547840	3548840	sick.
3548840	3551220	Some of them are doing it for the lols.
3551220	3555400	That isn't fucking funny and you deserve to have your computer swapped into submission
3555400	3557280	with a baseball bat over and over again.
3557280	3561440	If you are participating in this garbage, this is just, it's gross.
3561440	3566480	It's kind of, okay, so let's, let's talk weaponizing it to get at people and stuff is great.
3566480	3567480	Yeah.
3567480	3568480	How does it have to do with games by the way?
3568480	3569480	Well, we're getting there.
3569480	3572800	So like there's been several, several companies, something that has nothing to do with games.
3572800	3573760	Yeah.
3573760	3578240	So several companies have already pulled their ads from YouTube, including like Disney.
3578240	3584080	One of them, of course, Epic games have pulled their ads and those of course mostly ads for
3584080	3589080	Fortnite and so they have pulled it because they're in talks right now with YouTube to
3589080	3595680	see if they can, what's YouTube doing to fix this algorithm problem that they have with
3595680	3599440	basically, if you do find these videos and you click on a couple of them, that's all
3599440	3601600	you get in your feed is these like videos.
3601600	3607720	It makes it very easy for somebody to find that content.
3607720	3609920	So right now they're trying to figure out what they can do.
3609920	3615560	They've banned, YouTube's banned channels, they've, you know, um, demonetized other channels,
3615560	3616920	reported some things to the police.
3616920	3618920	They said, um, I have an idea.
3618920	3619920	I have an idea.
3619920	3620920	I know how to fix it.
3620920	3621920	I know how to fix it.
3621920	3622920	Ready?
3622920	3623920	Ready?
3623920	3624920	Delete the comments.
3624920	3625920	Done.
3625920	3626920	Problem solved.
3626920	3627920	Delete the comments, YouTube.
3627920	3628920	Delete them.
3628920	3629920	We don't know.
3629920	3630920	What good are YouTube comments doing?
3630920	3637800	It is showing, um, I guess, what was it?
3637800	3644980	It's showing what they call it, um, I don't remember what it's called.
3644980	3650320	It's showing how many viewers are actually interacting with the content creators on there.
3650320	3656320	And it's, um, it's for a way to monetize or basically show that this person is getting
3656320	3663440	more, um, like, I guess, focused views on their content or view thumbs up button would
3663440	3664440	be fine.
3664440	3665440	Subscriptions are fine.
3665440	3670160	Uh, a system like biddies where you could tip your favorite people would be fine.
3670160	3671400	All of that would be fine.
3671400	3672580	Why do we need comments?
3672580	3677320	We don't need comments, or better yet, just like if you have a way to see which comments
3677320	3680320	are like bad, why don't you just delete those comments?
3680320	3684160	Let content creators screen all their comments before they go up.
3684160	3685280	Is that a thing YouTube can do?
3685280	3687640	I'm pretty sure you can maybe...
3687640	3688640	Can you?
3688640	3690760	I don't know if you can disable stuff.
3690760	3692200	Can you just make it moderate?
3692200	3694200	Everything's moderated.
3694200	3695280	I don't know, but whatever.
3695280	3698040	It's gonna be worse before it gets better.
3698040	3702240	The ironic part about this, though, is the guy who actually posted this, um...
3702240	3704240	Wait, I gotta read this comment.
3704240	3705240	Yeah.
3705240	3708920	Uh, Metonius Games in chat says, comments are profitable to YouTube, but they will also
3708920	3710280	punish channels for it.
3710280	3715180	Well, that just goes to show YouTube would far punish the creators than publish to people
3715180	3716780	actually causing the problem.
3716780	3720700	Bobby in chat says, why do we need a chat room for this show?
3720700	3726180	Um, great question, but I, because I love having the live chat and the interaction with
3726180	3731160	people and so forth, but I will not hesitate for a moment to ban your ass if you cross
3731160	3732160	the line.
3732160	3735700	Hell, I just gave someone a time out for pulling the Smash Mouth stun on me.
3735700	3737160	So you know what?
3737160	3738160	I will rain down.
3738160	3743800	I will rain down with fire upon you a great vengeance if, you know, you bring that garbage
3743800	3744800	here.
3744920	3748760	I'd like to give most people the benefit of the doubt, but we have a lot of control over
3748760	3749760	moderation.
3749760	3754280	And if I'm not looking, Bobby Banhammer Black Wolf's looking and he won't hesitate to ban
3754280	3755280	that stuff.
3755280	3756960	And there's several other mods in there as well.
3756960	3760920	Well, the thing is too, okay, so like this is kind of the ironic part of it.
3760920	3767840	So, um, this Matt Watson guy, he's basically going out and pointing out this thing, thinking
3767840	3769280	that he's doing some good.
3769280	3772820	But I think it's actually for, he's trying to get his 15 minutes of fame.
3772860	3775660	He was an ex YouTuber.
3775660	3778660	So he started a new channel, posted this stuff.
3778660	3783500	People found his old channel and he has questionable shit on there, including, I don't know if
3783500	3787460	it's a skit or something, but it's basically him.
3787460	3791380	I don't know, doing it for the lols, asking people if they would like to be in an adult
3791380	3792660	video with him.
3792660	3799120	And there's one shows him driving in a car, talking to a school aged child saying, hey,
3799120	3801820	you want to be in an adult video with me?
3801820	3803940	Just ridiculous stuff.
3803940	3809220	So this is, this is the fun stuff that we get to deal with.
3809220	3810220	Delete YouTube!
3810220	3811220	Just delete it!
3811220	3812220	Delete YouTube!
3812220	3813220	Delete the whole site!
3813220	3817220	Burn it to the ground!
3817220	3819900	Yes, that is one way to do it.
3819900	3821320	Burn it with fire.
3821320	3826040	I just think the whole thing is, between this and like, you know, even earlier this week
3826040	3831140	we had a thing with The Verge where, you know, they were content striking people because
3831140	3834180	they didn't like what someone was seeing in a video like that.
3834180	3838940	You know, between abuses that are with the DMCA service, between now the way that people
3838940	3844420	can harass or even destroy YouTube channels by, with harassing comments, because I know
3844420	3849020	we have certain listeners, Xtifer for example, posting constantly on Twitter about all these
3849020	3854080	hateful comments he gets on his videos, and that kind of stuff right there, that would
3854080	3858140	demonetize his channel even if he's not doing anything wrong because of all the hateful
3858140	3862500	comments that are, it's like, it's the whole platform is messed up.
3862500	3867300	So sorry, but important, I'm doing my finger wag because I have something important to
3867300	3868300	say.
3868300	3869300	Okay, ready?
3869300	3870300	Okay.
3870300	3871300	Didn't we just have a story?
3871300	3872300	Well, hold on, hold on.
3872300	3873300	I got to check.
3873300	3874300	Hold on.
3874300	3875300	We got to go.
3875300	3876300	I need to scroll up one.
3876300	3877300	We got to scroll up.
3877300	3878300	Then I hit the button.
3878300	3879300	Okay.
3879300	3880300	Do we not just have a story?
3880300	3881820	Google is about to be a GDC, right?
3881820	3882820	We did.
3882820	3883820	We did just talk about that, right?
3883820	3884820	Yes.
3884820	3885820	Google owns YouTube, right?
3885820	3886820	Well, yeah.
3886820	3891260	Is somebody going to be asking Google, like, if you can't run a functioning video website
3891260	3897180	and moderate your shit, why were you going to trust you with a gaming console?
3897180	3900060	I mean, what's it going to happen if they're going to have a storefront that they're not
3900060	3901060	going to monitor?
3901060	3902060	What?
3902060	3907060	Then they're going to be Steam?
3907060	3913180	So, anyways, so let's talk a little bit more about Fortnite though instead of YouTube.
3913180	3915380	We'll switch topics here a little bit.
3915420	3920260	So Fortnite had this, they had this event called Fortnite Live.
3920260	3921260	Wait, sorry.
3921260	3924100	I just want to read, because when there are good comments, I read them on air.
3924100	3926180	That's another way you reinforce positivity, right?
3926180	3927180	Right.
3927180	3928260	You read the good stuff on air.
3928260	3932020	Not to say that everything I don't read is bad, but just, you know, reinforcing the good
3932020	3933020	stuff.
3933020	3937700	So Karts1 in our chat says, YouTube needs to put more pressure on creators to maintain
3937700	3939600	a healthy comment community.
3939600	3944820	It's so easy to set word filters and appoint other viewers to update said word filter delete
3944820	3946100	toxic comments.
3946100	3951040	So yeah, I think there has to be some type of onus on the content creators to foster
3951040	3952620	a positive community.
3952620	3957300	However, as you pointed out, the way things are working at YouTube right now, like YouTube
3957300	3961180	is also like blaming the content creators for all this.
3961180	3965420	And it's also though, I don't know if they can really control it because some of these
3965420	3971660	they're posting, like say for example, the one example they had is that their kid was,
3971660	3976100	they're posting videos of his gymnastics stuff online, which is fine.
3976100	3980060	You know, you can post videos of your kids online doing gymnastics, whatever that should
3980060	3981240	be fine.
3981240	3985820	But then people were making comments on that stuff and that's not, I mean, that's bad enough.
3985820	3990040	But then other times they were finding when they dug into the comments, you know, like
3990040	3993940	looking at these users and where they're commenting and stuff like that, they found that they're
3993940	3999020	taking these videos, downloading them, re uploading them on their own channels and like
3999020	4000740	talking about that shit elsewhere.
4000740	4004860	So you're not even getting to the point where they can even monitor the comments that are
4004860	4007820	on that video because it's being re uploaded and commented.
4007820	4012140	Mom and dad who shot that video should be able to sue those other, but not that I'm
4012140	4017220	all for like a sue happy America, but there ought to be some type of way you can go after
4017220	4020340	that troll that steals that video.
4020340	4022660	And of course, I guess, I don't know.
4022660	4023660	I know.
4023660	4027700	And now as I'm thinking through it in my head, they're going to be like, it's parody.
4027700	4031900	It's done for parody and you put it on the Internet and I don't know.
4031900	4034340	It's complicated, I guess.
4034340	4038860	But just people need to fucking behave themselves online is so gross anyway.
4038860	4039860	So anyways, more Fortnite.
4039860	4040860	Yeah.
4040860	4046660	So we're talking about Fortnite Live, which was an event that they held in Norwich.
4046660	4051420	They were advertising it as the ultimate Fortnite battle royale.
4051420	4058620	Apparently that they were selling tickets for between 12 and 20 pounds and they had
4058620	4062300	just about 3000 kids show up.
4062300	4069660	But apparently there was a lot of like misorganization.
4069660	4073480	They described it as basically saying it was a terrible disaster.
4073480	4075860	It was terrible and absolute disaster.
4075860	4076860	Not like advertise.
4076860	4079780	We went for the early bird, but some stuff was even set up.
4079780	4082540	The best part about it was the event was the burger I had.
4082540	4084180	My son wanted to leave.
4084180	4089260	And as an organizer saying it went well, one absolute joke.
4089260	4090260	It was awful.
4090260	4092340	I have a very disappointed child.
4092340	4093340	Yeah.
4093340	4100460	And they're saying that there was some sort of like like merch that was just it was the
4100460	4101460	Fyre Festival.
4101460	4105680	Yeah, it was Gartner Festival Fortnite garbage and nobody learned anything from those documentaries.
4105680	4110520	And basically because it was garbage and because they were using the Fortnite name,
4110520	4114900	Epic doesn't want to be at all associated with it.
4114900	4119240	So they, of course, are going to be suing the organizers of this event.
4119240	4122680	They said the quality of our player experience is incredibly important to us.
4122680	4128680	And whether it's inside the game or an official public event like Fortnite Pro-Am, Epic Games
4128680	4132240	was not in any way associated with the event that took place in Norwich.
4132240	4137800	And we've issued a claim against the organization in the High Court of London.
4137800	4144000	The proceedings by Epic Games, of course, you know, this is regarding their response.
4144000	4148300	Very important question about the convention from our chat comment of the night here from
4148300	4149900	Crystal Skies 80.
4149900	4152020	Did it have a ball pit?
4152020	4153560	I don't think it had a ball pit.
4153560	4154560	Sorry.
4154560	4157360	No wonder you got your ass in court.
4157360	4161880	Extra time in the ball pit.
4161880	4168600	They're saying, you know, the so Epic Games, you know, that has forced the shutdown to
4168600	4172220	prebooked future Fortnite live events.
4172220	4177960	These proceedings by Epic Games has had a catastrophic impact on the company's ability
4177960	4186800	to trade, which has forced exciting events limited to cease all trading activities immediately.
4186800	4191400	And now they're seeking to limit the losses to third parties as soon as possible.
4191400	4195420	Well, boohoo, maybe you don't use someone else's intellectual property for a shitty
4195420	4196420	ass event.
4196420	4200440	Yeah, I think Epic is kind of in the right here to, you know, say, hey, don't put your
4200440	4201440	name.
4201440	4204440	I mean, it's one thing if you're like a gaming celebration festival and you just heavily
4204440	4205440	feature Fortnite.
4205440	4206840	We get some of those like around here, too.
4206840	4211180	There's like not a Minecon event, but it's like a Minecraft event.
4211180	4213820	And it's just kind of put together by other people.
4213820	4216720	They also do like some like Lego events and stuff like that.
4216720	4217720	That's not officially Lego.
4217720	4219880	But I don't think any of those events are this bad.
4219880	4220880	No.
4221360	4222360	It's I think I knew people.
4222360	4223360	It's also smaller.
4223360	4225400	I think I know people that went to Minecraft when they had a good time, actually.
4225400	4227080	So a little different.
4227080	4229800	So but this is a little bit different with Fortnite and stuff.
4229800	4230800	Yeah.
4230800	4231800	Mm hmm.
4231800	4232800	All right.
4232800	4233800	Oh, OK.
4233800	4237560	I need to cleanse the palate after some of those stories we just talked about because
4237560	4238920	it was a little bit upsetting.
4238920	4240860	So how about some rumors?
4240860	4245520	How about we get into some rumors about, oh, look, here's the thing.
4245520	4246880	I know how y'all feel about rumors.
4246880	4248520	Some of you hate them.
4248560	4253120	But this is also a show to talk about what people are talking about around the table
4253120	4255000	this week in gaming.
4255000	4258360	And this is this is on fire on social media.
4258360	4259960	Is this rumor?
4259960	4265920	And it has to do with a rumor about regular meetings being held between Nintendo and the
4265920	4273000	Xbox team, which could culminate with Ori and the Blind Forest, as well as the sequel,
4273000	4275000	The Wisping Woods or whatever that the ones called.
4275000	4276000	Sorry.
4277000	4283320	Cuphead, Game Pass and X Cloud coming to the Nintendo Switch later in the year.
4283320	4289000	This is coming from a large gaming Web site in France, which is talking about all these
4289000	4290000	leaks.
4290000	4292000	What would Game Pass entail though?
4292000	4295240	Like, I don't understand if they're not going to be games on the platform.
4295240	4296240	What would that entail?
4296240	4297240	It's streaming.
4297240	4302280	If you're streaming the games through, do you stream with Game Pass or is it all downloads?
4302280	4305280	There's two different systems on Microsoft.
4305560	4306560	One of them is the streaming.
4306560	4308960	One of them is the download on demand.
4308960	4313560	So with the streaming one, I thought that was all game probably butchering this all
4313560	4314560	right now.
4314560	4315560	Well, you know what?
4315560	4316560	Let's figure it out.
4316560	4317560	Can't you Google it?
4317560	4318640	Google it while we read this story.
4318640	4319640	You answer your own damn question.
4319640	4321640	You don't want to answer my own.
4321640	4325640	OK, well, I know we butchered it on a show before and we got an email about it.
4325640	4328240	So I feel some type of onus to get it right this time.
4328240	4330680	So anyway, apparently the rumor goes on.
4330680	4334920	There were several meetings in Redmond regarding the partnership or in the Blind Forest and
4334920	4340680	Cuphead coming to the switch, which I mean, that makes a lot of sense, right?
4340680	4346560	More than 100 Xbox games via Game Pass and or X Cloud before the end of the year.
4346560	4349920	So I guess there's two things going on there.
4349920	4350920	Yeah.
4350920	4351920	You download the games.
4351920	4352920	OK.
4352920	4353920	OK.
4353920	4354920	Well, maybe it wouldn't be like all the games.
4354920	4358140	So maybe like Xbox 360 games, if they are, they already kind of like built this emulator
4358140	4359140	thing.
4359140	4360140	Maybe that would work.
4360140	4361140	I don't know.
4361140	4364300	Rare games possibly coming to the switch and so on and so on.
4364300	4367020	You get where this is going.
4367020	4371340	And going to chat over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network.
4371340	4372340	Let's see.
4372340	4376760	Miltonius Games says the Xbox app on switch is making much more sense.
4376760	4380420	She Hulk says streaming is not up and running yet.
4380420	4383260	So that must be what this X Cloud thing is all about.
4383260	4388140	And so it would make a lot of sense that that would be the thing that would exist on the
4388140	4389180	Nintendo switch.
4389180	4393700	And maybe some people, like we're doing, are calling that Game Pass because they just assume
4393700	4394700	it's kind of like the same.
4394700	4399100	So is the X Cloud thing where I play like I can stream to my system?
4399100	4401100	I believe that's what it's for.
4401100	4402100	Right.
4402100	4404860	No, like stream any game like on the Internet.
4404860	4410060	And the switch does this with things like Assassin's Creed Odyssey and the Resident
4410060	4411060	Evil 7.
4411060	4412060	Yeah.
4412060	4413060	Right.
4413060	4414060	In Japan.
4414060	4417380	It wasn't Xbox related, but it was Japan had that switch where it was all based on streaming.
4417380	4422940	So maybe Microsoft saw that and was kind of like, hey, you know, and there's there's a
4422940	4429020	lot about this that just like, I mean, it's a lot of fanwank, but it's also like, damn,
4429020	4431180	this would be a good partnership.
4431180	4436500	I mean, there's been fanwank for years about Nintendo and Microsoft getting in bed together.
4436500	4437500	Part of what makes this.
4437500	4442140	Can you imagine if we go one way, can we go the other way and get some Nintendo games
4442140	4444220	on Xbox one?
4444220	4445220	Who knows?
4445220	4446220	Who knows?
4446220	4447740	But I would sell me an Xbox one.
4447740	4448780	I will say this.
4448780	4453440	There are some things that make sense about it, because as you see that Microsoft is trying
4453440	4458780	to push themselves beyond just a company you think about with game hardware and Xbox and
4458780	4462100	so forth, we've even talked about this on the show just a couple of weeks ago where
4462100	4465700	there were some comments about how Microsoft's really trying to just grow into the whole
4465700	4472380	like gaming system, gaming ecosystem where, you know, you've got this cloud and Microsoft
4472380	4476440	wants to be Netflix for games again, going into what we just talked about at the very
4476440	4480480	beginning of the show, Microsoft kind of sees this coming and they want to be Netflix
4480480	4481480	for games.
4481480	4486640	And what better person to team up with than the person that can't seem to figure out online
4486640	4488640	and say, we'll deliver it all to you.
4488640	4489640	And you know what?
4489640	4492240	We're not, we're not going to be putting out a handheld and that's probably part of their
4492240	4496760	agreement or whatever is that Xbox would not put out a handheld ever.
4496760	4499960	And that is, you know, something that, you know, maybe is on the table.
4499960	4500960	I don't know.
4500960	4506380	Or this is just all fanwank that culminates in nothing, but damn, would this be like an
4506380	4510740	industry changing thing, especially with E3 being this year.
4510740	4515220	Think about who's not at E3 this year and who are the big gaming companies that will
4515220	4516220	be at E3 this year.
4516220	4517220	Oh my God.
4517220	4518220	That'd be amazing.
4518220	4520260	I mean, they would be able to dominate the conversation.
4520260	4523380	They would be the entirety of the conversation if this happened.
4523380	4526220	It would be a, it would really be something else.
4526220	4530580	Microsoft has struggled to get an audience in Japan for a long time.
4530580	4534540	I mean, and so you might be looking at like, well, who's going to buy Ori and the Blind
4534540	4535900	Forest and Cuphead at this point?
4535900	4538980	Those games are years old, um, Japan.
4538980	4543860	I bet there would be a big audience that would like to check out Cuphead or if they can port
4543860	4544860	it to the switch.
4544860	4547220	Um, yeah, you know, that would be awesome.
4547220	4551100	Although I'm surprised that the Cuphead's not really an Xbox game.
4551100	4553320	That's just a, it's a PC title.
4553320	4557140	So I mean, I would think that that would be independent of Microsoft.
4557140	4561500	VG realness says, um, I would absolutely would love for Microsoft to take over Nintendo's
4561500	4565780	online, but I just can't see the Japanese arm getting in bed with the U S company.
4565780	4566780	And I don't either.
4566780	4571540	And I don't necessarily, you know, a lot of that, that I said before is mostly for hyperbole
4571540	4575340	because I think what it really comes down to, it's going to be more like a strategic
4575340	4576480	partnership.
4576480	4580080	Think about how Minecraft is on the switch right now.
4580080	4584900	That's a Microsoft thing that they're putting on the switch and the switch is able to use
4584900	4585900	that as well.
4585900	4589980	Nintendo can kind of use Microsoft as a way to swell, sell more switches because, Hey,
4589980	4592100	we can do Mike Minecraft on the go.
4592100	4593860	That is a strategic partnership.
4593860	4599980	I don't see in this scenario, Microsoft taking over Nintendo or Nintendo taking over Microsoft
4599980	4600980	or anything like that.
4600980	4601980	That's not what we're talking about.
4601980	4605980	We're talking about a strategic partnership where now Microsoft can kind of get some of
4605980	4609460	their games, especially in front of a Japanese audience.
4609460	4616620	And then on the flip side, uh, you know, Nintendo, uh, has ways to say, now we have all these
4616620	4621920	new libraries of games that are accessible and playable that are on the switch.
4621920	4626240	But I don't think it goes to Nintendo making games for Xbox.
4626240	4631060	That's too far because Nintendo is still in the, in the habit of, we need to sell consoles.
4631060	4632280	We need to sell this hardware.
4632280	4636900	And the best way we do it is through our own titles that, you know, we are one of the best
4636900	4638460	games in the business.
4638460	4643020	But think about it though, like you could still do that and like just offer your titles
4643020	4648940	for sale if, you know, cause they don't ever drop in price for sale through like a download
4648940	4654900	service on, you know, like a Nintendo eShop app on the Xbox one or something like that
4654900	4656620	where you can download stuff.
4656620	4660820	It would still be like through the Nintendo store and you're just playing it, stream it
4660820	4662340	to that console or something.
4662340	4663340	I don't know.
4663340	4666420	I just don't see why they couldn't go both ways, but who cares?
4666420	4670000	I've even finally just game pass being on the switch.
4670000	4675360	And so the rumors don't stop there because Game Informer Senior Editor Imran Khan, I
4675360	4680280	hope I said the name right, sorry, chimed in as well with this on a podcast that he's
4680280	4681280	a part of.
4681280	4683600	Oh, those podcasts breaking news.
4683600	4689160	He said, there's a game that's thought to be dead that Nintendo is reviving and it's
4689160	4691480	not one that people would expect.
4691480	4695480	It was very much a title that was dead and buried, very officially canceled.
4695480	4700160	I've heard enough about this game that he's almost sure that it exists again.
4700160	4704200	And some people connecting the dots believe that that game is scale bound.
4704200	4705200	Yeah.
4705200	4707000	Um, don't know.
4707000	4711600	And then, but then right along with that, uh, I believe there was a rumor that kind
4711600	4716680	of follows that up to say, eh, probably not, it might not actually be that that's, that's
4716680	4717680	what's going on.
4717680	4721000	So, you know, take that with a big grain of salt.
4721000	4723960	Um, but it's sure interesting in it.
4723960	4724960	Yeah.
4725960	4727720	I wouldn't, I don't know about scale bound.
4727720	4730200	It was all right looking.
4730200	4733880	I'd be in, well, scale bound to, if I remember right, scale bound, they originally conceived
4733880	4734880	for the wheat.
4734880	4739720	So, you know, Hey, Nintendo, I thought it was the X-Box three, six, it was originally
4739720	4743640	conceived of the Wii and the Microsoft, you know, that whole partnership kind of worked
4743640	4747200	with platinum games to bring it over there and then it didn't work out for whatever reason.
4747200	4749720	So it would be very interesting if it does get a life.
4749720	4754920	I mean, again, I think a lot of that is kind of like fanboy dreams, but you know, um, Nintendo
4754960	4760320	bringing back a franchise thought dead is not exactly unheard of Bayonetta.
4760320	4765320	So except Bayonetta happened kind of like a lot faster, but you know, again, have, have
4765320	4768360	we yet to see Bayonetta two show up on any other console?
4768360	4769360	Nope.
4769360	4771360	Not going to happen because Nintendo saved it.
4771360	4778720	So anyway, we'll see, I, you know, E3 could be very interesting this year.
4778720	4784000	Obviously it's a, it's rumors, huge grain of salt, but boy, is it fun to think about
4784000	4785000	the possibilities.
4785000	4786000	Isn't it?
4786000	4787000	Yes.
4787000	4788000	Yeah, sure thing.
4788000	4793000	Uh, over in our Twitch chat room, uh, at VOG network, uh, she Hulk thinks that Microsoft
4793000	4797000	will give Nintendo a piece of the sales, uh, VG realness chimes in.
4797000	4800240	Nintendo will never put their games on another console.
4800240	4806080	And I, I believe that just as heavy as it's written in the chat, Nintendo is that Nintendo
4806080	4809960	would be dead or selling to somebody else before that happens.
4809960	4811760	And they're not, they're not hurting right now.
4811760	4817200	I wouldn't say never though, because we probably, one time we thought, okay, in 20 Sonic will
4817200	4818840	never appear on a Nintendo console.
4818840	4819840	Okay.
4819840	4820840	But we're talking like 20 years.
4820840	4824560	We're talking like an entirely different industry than what we're in now.
4824560	4829320	One where Nintendo has flopped so hard, it ruined them and not even the Wii U did that.
4829320	4832320	So I just don't see it happening anytime soon.
4832320	4833320	That's for sure.
4833320	4834320	Um, interesting.
4834880	4835880	Interesting.
4835880	4841200	Um, Miltonius Games says everybody and nobody wants Scalebound on their console, apparently.
4841200	4847360	Well, you know, I, Hey, as long as the game is good, bring it on, you know, and I'm all
4847360	4850600	for a variety of experiences on the Switch.
4850600	4854280	You know, Nintendo has their wheelhouse very well covered.
4854280	4860680	Nintendo makes Nintendo games very well, but if they can get other types of games, hardcore
4860680	4865680	games, if you will, and so forth on their platform, it stands to do even better.
4865680	4866680	Shit.
4866680	4867680	Look at Fortnite, right?
4867680	4871800	Fortnite was not always the type of game you'd expect to see on a Nintendo console, but where
4871800	4873960	is something like Fortnite thriving?
4873960	4874960	Nintendo Switch.
4874960	4875960	Yeah.
4875960	4881680	This is why everybody's like Apex Legends on Switch when, which by the way, Apex Legends
4881680	4884040	has some really low graphics settings in it.
4884040	4888560	So I'm kinda, it doesn't seem like the hardware would be the issue with bringing something
4888560	4889840	like that to the Switch.
4890040	4891040	What do I know?
4891040	4893240	I'm just some dude with a podcast.
4893240	4894240	Anyway.
4894240	4896600	All right, let's move on.
4896600	4900520	We have a few more stories before we get to the classic game of the week.
4900520	4907080	So Dreams is going to have a special creator early access version of the game that's going
4907080	4915700	to be coming out this spring for $30 and it says there'll be a strictly limited release.
4915740	4921340	It's basically going to allow you to kind of get a full set of the creative tools along
4921340	4924380	with tutorials, arcade games and whatnot.
4924380	4929540	And then they'll be adding more features, tutorials, arcade levels and assets as stuff
4929540	4934460	goes along and prioritize all the awesome stuff that they're doing there.
4934460	4940420	Um, they said the most important, I do it, I probably will do it for 30 bucks for like,
4940420	4941480	I'll probably do it.
4941480	4946440	I will because like all the things that people are creating with this is crazy and I just
4946440	4948040	want to get in there and explore.
4948040	4952800	Like if I feel like this dreams thing is not just like a game, it's, it's going to sneak
4952800	4959400	up on you because like seriously, when I, when they kept showing dreams and like all
4959400	4962640	the stuff that they're doing with it during these like presentations, I didn't really
4962640	4963640	get it.
4963640	4967660	But then you see what people are making with it, like where they're recreating PT in dreams
4967660	4973620	or they're making a first person shooter that looks pretty amazing in dreams.
4973620	4977660	I mean it's going to be a pretty amazing thing once it comes out.
4977660	4982800	Um, but yeah, they said the most important thing is to know that the dream of verse is
4982800	4989380	going to form around you so that if it gets you excited, early access is for you.
4989380	4993860	If you participated in the beta and felt like dreams wasn't fully featured enough for you
4993860	4999940	yet or you wanted more media molecule game content, then early access might not be for
4999940	5000940	you.
5000940	5004340	And then we're working on all those things during this period and we have every, if you
5004340	5008220	want to pay for a beta, then this is for you.
5008220	5010300	I'll do it for 30 bucks or 30 bucks.
5010300	5015340	What does it, does it give you the full game as well or does it, is it like, is it $30
5015340	5016700	towards the full game or something?
5016700	5018620	I hope that would at least be it.
5018620	5022740	Um, it's like you could upgrade this to a full copy of the game for a lot less.
5022740	5025260	This eventually becomes a full copy of the game.
5025260	5031000	Um, I'm not, it doesn't really, $30 seems really low for a game like this unless they
5031000	5034740	plan to like charge for the things people create in this game or something.
5034740	5035740	Yeah.
5035740	5041080	It doesn't really specify that it's going to be, um, upgraded to the full version.
5041080	5047600	Although if they're keeping constantly adding stuff to it, maybe I, I don't know, it'd still
5047600	5049740	be worth checking it out though.
5049740	5050740	Yeah.
5050740	5052700	All right.
5052700	5056380	Well, um, I, uh, already talked about the scale bound thing.
5056380	5059540	I kind of threw it in there with the other, uh, Nintendo and Microsoft rumors.
5059540	5064740	So I don't think there's a lot else to say on these whispers about, uh, uh, Nintendo
5064740	5070160	possibly reviving a canceled game, but I guess let me turn this into a question for everybody
5070160	5074660	out there in the chat or, um, us here in studio.
5074660	5080560	Outside of scale bounds, you know, and that, what would you like to see Nintendo possibly
5080560	5082860	reinvent or reignite?
5082860	5090120	What would you want Nintendo to do to read, read, ignite, I guess an old X-Box game.
5090120	5091120	Anything really.
5091120	5095080	Um, do a new cameo or perfect dark.
5095080	5096360	Oh, perfect dark.
5096360	5097360	That's a good one.
5097360	5098360	Yeah.
5098360	5099360	It was like some of that stuff.
5099360	5100360	Yeah.
5100360	5104040	Cameo had potential I think, but they didn't really do anything with it aside from kind
5104040	5108560	of, I don't know if people would get excited about a new cameo excited about a new perfect
5108560	5109560	dark.
5109560	5110560	Dark would be cool.
5110560	5111560	Yeah.
5111560	5112560	It would be very cool.
5112560	5113560	Cause I was going to say something like golden.
5113560	5118520	I, although I've already tried, I know it's already been activated.
5118520	5121840	It didn't really work out so well, but I think a lot of people are very attached to that
5121840	5122840	for sure.
5122840	5128640	Um, looking at chat over at a Twitch TV slash vog network, uh, VG realness says fantasy
5128640	5130280	star online.
5130280	5131280	Very good choice.
5131280	5133320	Uh, Oh, perfect dark is a good choice.
5133320	5134320	Perfect dark.
5134320	5135320	Zero is trash.
5135320	5136320	She Hulk.
5136320	5137320	Oh, I like this answer.
5137320	5138320	Fable.
5138320	5139320	All right.
5140080	5141080	That's a good answer.
5141080	5142920	That is a really good answer because I think of that.
5142920	5147320	There was that fable game, the co-op thing that got canceled where that, and that was
5147320	5148440	very officially canceled.
5148440	5152040	And maybe that is something that Nintendo could bring fable legends, right?
5152040	5153600	Maybe that's something Nintendo would, yeah.
5153600	5157440	They were trying to do also that like, w weren't they also doing, I don't know if it was part
5157440	5162160	of the fable universe or not, but they were doing that like game making thing as well.
5162160	5163960	They didn't really end up being anything.
5163960	5164960	Yeah.
5164960	5169160	Um, I don't know if I'd want to see that, but, uh, Frodo swag, his wishes.
5169200	5171320	Uh, they would remake golden eye the proper way.
5171320	5173480	The one they tried to remake was garbage.
5173480	5176640	And did you, Rama asked to just conquer.
5176640	5180960	I think when we talk about like rare games coming out on switch, that would make a lot
5180960	5181960	of sense.
5181960	5186140	If that happens again, I really think people are taking this tiny little like nugget of
5186140	5190560	information and like rolling it down a hill and turn it into a snowball.
5190560	5195240	Let's take a wait and see and pro fusion frenzy.
5195240	5196520	Let's take out the first one was good.
5196520	5201040	Let's take a wait and see approach and just, you know, go in with little expectations.
5201040	5205600	Do not expect this at E3, do not expect Microsoft to come out and say, we're going to be on
5205600	5206600	the switch.
5206600	5208240	Do not expect Nintendo to announce in a direct.
5208240	5211880	We've revived scale bound because for all we know, Nintendo is going to say we're going
5211880	5213160	to do a few Jim frenzy.
5213160	5216160	And so you got to lower those expectations a little bit.
5216160	5220000	So anyway, although the intended diffusion, they don't really need to do fusion frenzy
5220000	5223200	because it's basically Mario party and it kind of is right.
5223200	5224680	It's that fusion frenzy was crap.
5224680	5225680	All right.
5225840	5232160	Let's take a step back to a simpler time and visit the classic game of the week and maybe
5232160	5236480	something that needs to be reinvented at another time, another place.
5239480	5244360	And so we take a step back through time and space and everything else that we can bend
5244360	5247920	in our will to a journey to the classic game of the week.
5247920	5252320	And joining us to share the classic game of the week is the one, the only dark Sakura
5252320	5253520	or Jamie Summers.
5253520	5254520	Hello.
5254520	5255520	Hi.
5256360	5257360	How are you?
5257360	5258360	I'm all right.
5258360	5259360	How are you?
5259360	5260360	I am good.
5260360	5261360	Yeah.
5261360	5262360	I'm sad.
5262360	5265360	It's not a three day weekend like last weekend, but, you know, I'll take it.
5265360	5266360	It wasn't.
5266360	5270360	Well, I guess it was a three day weekend for me because I made it one.
5270360	5271600	There you go.
5271600	5274560	Well, we look forward to having you back in studio next week.
5274560	5275560	Full time.
5277560	5278560	Very soon.
5278560	5279560	All right.
5279560	5282880	Well, one more for the books for this tape stuff.
5282880	5283880	So how about it?
5284240	5286400	Let's talk about the classic game of the week.
5286400	5289800	What did you pick as you ventured into the vault and found a game that you think everybody
5289800	5291000	should be checking out this week?
5291000	5292000	What is it?
5292000	5293680	I really wish this wasn't my fault.
5293680	5295680	It's called Magical Popping.
5297680	5298680	All right.
5298680	5299680	Magical Popping.
5300680	5301680	It came out in 1995.
5301680	5308000	It only came out for the Super Famicom and it was developed by Full Star and published
5308000	5311880	by a company called Pack In Video, which later, I think, joined.
5311880	5312880	Hold on.
5312880	5315380	I actually have the name of the company they became.
5315380	5321880	They became Victor Entertainment and then became Victor Interactive Software.
5321880	5329000	So as for Magical Popping, this game is considered one of the rarest Super Famicom titles and
5329000	5335560	it goes for a lot of money, but also it has a very high piracy rate and with people trying
5335560	5336560	to sell repros.
5336560	5340000	So just, you know, be careful.
5340120	5343120	If you happen to find one, make sure it's legit.
5343120	5349600	But this did release on March 10th, 1995 and it's a side-scrolling game.
5349600	5353800	I was just going to say, if you do find one, put it in an envelope and mail it to Dark
5353800	5356800	Sakura, care of OLR Studios.
5356800	5357800	Yes.
5357800	5360800	It is a side-scrolling game.
5360800	5366560	It has six stages total, but the stages are sort of maze-like and non-linear.
5366560	5370560	You also have no password or state feature, so if you're going to finish it, you need
5370560	5373920	to sit down and commit.
5373920	5380760	But basically, you're playing as a princess who lives in a castle that has a magical gem
5380760	5386600	and the gem is stolen by an invading army and so the princess, you know, not having
5386600	5391760	any heroes and having a go-get-it personality just does it herself.
5391760	5400440	So the game was produced by Wada Yasuhiro, who also went on to work on Harvest Moon in
5400440	5407720	1995 and had artwork on the box drawn by Akai Takami.
5407720	5415880	One thing about the voice acting of the game was done by a lady named Ijima Ai, who had
5415880	5419960	also worked in adult video earlier on in her career.
5420160	5426880	She's actually one of the few people who this never became a scandal for her, also sadly.
5426880	5435920	She died of a kidney failure and sepsis, I want to say, in 2010, if I remember correctly,
5435920	5438280	so she's since gone.
5438280	5445360	She was a big TV personality for a while after her initial days, but at any rate, this game
5445360	5453720	has never had a release outside of Japan and never had a release on any other console.
5453720	5458320	It was reviewed by Famitsu for a 23 out of 40.
5458320	5465000	It was compared to the Monster World series that it was sort of an old-fashioned kind
5465000	5471120	of game and that the game was really difficult because the character's attack was very low,
5471120	5476160	although the character had great animation.
5476160	5480160	Some people didn't even think that Ijima's voice was all that good because of the sort
5480160	5485680	of moe character, yet she has a kind of corny voice.
5485680	5493280	It was basically considered cute and challenging and people were bad that you couldn't actually
5493280	5495280	say it in the game.
5496000	5501680	The intellectual property of the game now belongs to Marvelous Entertainment and it
5501680	5508800	was listed in 2016 at 100,000 yen sold in the box, without 30,000 yen.
5508800	5518880	A store in Tokyo in 2017 was selling it for 140,000 yen, which at the time was about $1200.
5518880	5528480	I think the highest successful bid was 80,000 yen for this game, so 800 bucks, roughly.
5528480	5533120	So there you go, a game that I probably won't own a copy of any time soon unless someone
5533120	5534640	really loves me.
5534640	5538920	I was going to say, that's approaching levels of that Super Mario game we talked about last
5538920	5541200	week that sold for $100,000.
5541200	5545920	I mean, maybe not that high yet, but I'm in condition, who knows?
5545920	5548560	Yeah, but good luck.
5548560	5551920	Yeah, this is the type of game, though, since you kept talking about how you can't really
5551920	5556160	save it or there's no passwords, this is the type of game that would definitely lend itself
5556160	5562080	to how you leave the power on all night long and just pray that your parents don't come
5562080	5566240	in or your sibling or whatever doesn't come in and shut it off in the middle of the night.
5566240	5570400	And it's like, man, my game, man, you ruined it.
5570400	5572160	Mm-hmm, for sure.
5572160	5578000	Now, just to throw this out there, if anyone is not super familiar with pack-in video from
5578000	5584000	before the day, they also published Moon or Lander, mine speaker for Game Boy.
5584000	5586720	They did One Gun Dead heat games for Saturn.
5586720	5592600	For Super Framacon, they did Atlas Run, Sunk, Voyager, Magical Pop'n, like I just said.
5592600	5597120	They did Super Battle Tank 2, Super Solace Hair, Harvest Moon.
5597120	5602280	And then for Turbo Graphics, the PC Engine, they did the Metal Angel games, Super Metal
5602280	5603280	Crusher.
5603280	5605400	They did virtual fishing for Virtual Boy.
5605400	5608960	And they did a handful of MSX and MSX2 games.
5608960	5617400	They also developed Burning Soldier for 3DO, Boundary Gate for PC-FX, and then a few other
5617400	5620840	really only Japanese-only games except for Famicom.
5620840	5625000	They did Die Hard and Knight Rider and Predator and Rambo.
5625000	5627000	So some 80s movies tie-in.
5627000	5629000	Yeah, a few.
5629000	5630000	So how...
5630000	5631000	Go ahead.
5631000	5633000	You were saying?
5633000	5635000	I just said that's it.
5635600	5637600	Awkward phone delay.
5637600	5643440	I was just about to ask, since this game is so rare and it's so difficult, how did you
5643440	5644960	come across this for selection?
5644960	5648400	Is this just because you kind of know the publisher?
5648400	5652800	I just came over the game and it's been kind of on my secret want list for a while.
5652800	5656640	I mean, I had that want list of rare games for a while that have gotten a few things
5656640	5657900	off of.
5657900	5661720	And then a few that had found out, oh, I actually do already own this.
5662440	5668720	It was around the time I was learning about Panorama Cotton and Dracula X and some of
5668720	5670720	those types of games.
5670720	5671720	All right.
5671720	5672720	Very cool.
5672720	5673720	Well, there it is.
5673720	5678720	Your classic game of the week, Magical Poppin', a very, very rare Super Famicom game.
5678720	5681720	And again, if you find a copy of that, you can just send it right to our studio.
5681720	5683720	Please do.
5683720	5686720	I might even send you a taco.
5686720	5689720	Real quick before we go back to the show.
5689720	5695720	I know it's that Sunday night, it's that time, it's award season, it's Oscar season.
5695720	5698720	So is there anything, I mean, maybe you don't give a hoot.
5698720	5701720	I know I'm kind of in that category, but is there anything you're rooting for tonight
5701720	5703720	at the Oscars?
5703720	5704720	Two things.
5704720	5706720	The tuxedo ball gown is epic.
5706720	5707720	Oh, Billy.
5707720	5708720	And the second Oscar.
5708720	5709720	Yeah.
5709720	5710720	Billy Porter.
5710720	5711720	Sorry.
5711720	5712720	Just, yeah, amazing.
5712720	5713720	Yeah.
5713720	5714720	And then secondly, I don't know.
5714720	5718720	The only Oscar I care about lives in the trash can on Bethany Street.
5719720	5726720	And so I suppose we end this segment with, and that's why I love trash.
5726720	5727720	Yeah.
5727720	5728720	All right.
5728720	5729720	Seriously, though.
5729720	5732720	He was our first, Oscar was our first upcycler, remember?
5732720	5733720	That's right.
5733720	5737720	Anyway, it shouldn't end with my final singing.
5737720	5740720	What are your final words to the listeners tonight?
5740720	5746720	That's why I like trash, too.
5746720	5750720	I guess we're just big fans of trash here at Orange Lounge Radio.
5750720	5751720	What can we say?
5751720	5752720	Thank you, as always, DarkSagra.
5752720	5756720	And we'll see you back in studio next week.
5756720	5761720	Meanwhile, let's travel around the internet and touch on a few more stories that we have
5761720	5762720	not had time to talk about yet.
5762720	5766720	I was going to say, speaking to the Oscars, I was very pleased to see that Spider-Man
5766720	5768720	entered the Spider-Verse 1 best animated film.
5768720	5769720	Oh, did it?
5769720	5770720	Okay.
5770720	5771720	It was up against Wreck-It Ralph, too, right?
5771720	5772720	Yeah.
5773720	5777720	If you've seen Spider-Man, it was easily deserving of that.
5777720	5779720	A lot of people were fans of that.
5779720	5781720	I don't care about the Oscars.
5781720	5782720	I don't care.
5782720	5785720	I realize I'm probably the only gay guy on the planet that's going to tell you that,
5785720	5786720	but I don't care about the Oscars.
5786720	5787720	I just don't.
5787720	5788720	I know.
5788720	5789720	Who cares what other people think?
5789720	5792720	I only cared about it when I worked in the movie industry.
5792720	5794720	What does it matter about critics anyway?
5794720	5798720	Look at what's going on with Anthem right now, which I've said my piece on Anthem, and
5798720	5801720	I purposely wasn't going to get into this tonight because I haven't played the full game, so
5801720	5805720	I really don't have anything to say, but I will point out, you know, it doesn't have
5805720	5807720	a wonderful score on Metacritic.
5807720	5812720	61 is lower than what Mass Effect Andromeda had, right?
5812720	5816720	But I've got plenty of people on social media and other places that are like,
5816720	5817720	I'm having fun.
5817720	5818720	I'm having a good time.
5818720	5819720	Whatever.
5819720	5820720	You know?
5820720	5824720	And I've seen other people that are saying these loading times are garbage.
5824720	5826720	The game's not even done yet and so forth.
5826720	5829720	I'm not going to talk about it because I didn't play it.
5829720	5830720	Y'all know why I didn't.
5830720	5831720	We're done.
5831720	5837720	But if people are enjoying it, it shouldn't stop them from enjoying it.
5837720	5843720	And seeing that it even goes with like Fallout 76, you know, if you're enjoying that game,
5843720	5845720	more power to you.
5845720	5846720	It's just, I'm surprised.
5846720	5849720	You're one of the minority, I guess.
5849720	5850720	Whatever.
5850720	5856720	VG Realness in chat says, ooh, bitch, you'll care if Star is Born wins or if Gaga wins
5856720	5857720	Best Actress.
5858720	5861720	I would only be excited if Star is Born won because that's more exposure for Willem and
5861720	5863720	Shangela who are in that movie.
5863720	5866720	But I also completely understand why like Roma winning would be very good.
5866720	5867720	Was that what it's called?
5867720	5868720	Yeah.
5868720	5870720	Well, that movie, the Netflix, because it's on Netflix.
5870720	5874720	It's obviously, you know, it's a whole different kind of movie.
5874720	5875720	I think best foreign.
5875720	5876720	Right.
5876720	5877720	Well, that'll win best foreign for sure.
5877720	5879720	You don't you'll get anyway.
5879720	5881720	Or, you know, Black Panther wins.
5881720	5885720	That's going to be huge because, you know, it's a Marvel movie that's winning best.
5885720	5886720	But, you know, so whatever.
5887720	5888720	Cool.
5888720	5893720	Gaga won't win Best Actress, though, because Glenn Close, I think it's it's her time.
5893720	5895720	And that's honestly like I love Lady Gaga.
5895720	5896720	She's great.
5896720	5899720	But like her not winning an Oscar is not going to diminish.
5899720	5900720	Apparently she did.
5900720	5901720	She just won for the song.
5901720	5902720	Of course.
5902720	5903720	How is she not going to win that song?
5903720	5904720	Give me a break.
5904720	5910720	But it's it's not going to diminish what an artist she is or how amazing she was in that
5910720	5913720	movie, whether she does or doesn't take home a gold statue.
5913720	5915720	Glenn Close is kind of perfect.
5915720	5916720	Like, come on.
5916720	5919720	Y'all saw one hundred and one Dalmatians as kids.
5919720	5920720	It's Glenn Close's time.
5920720	5921720	It's fair.
5921720	5923720	It's fair.
5923720	5926720	She should have won the Oscar for Cruella.
5926720	5929720	She got nominated for a Globe, if I remember right, for Cruella.
5929720	5932720	Yeah, because the Globes will nominate anything.
5932720	5933720	Let's move on.
5933720	5934720	Why am I talking about award shows?
5934720	5935720	What are you doing?
5935720	5936720	I don't know.
5936720	5940720	You're the one that went on that rapid fire news.
5940720	5941720	All right.
5941720	5947720	So the entitled goose game, better known as the asshole goose game, it's been delayed.
5947720	5950720	So it's going to come out later in 2019 instead of the spring.
5950720	5951720	That's unfortunate.
5951720	5955720	So you're going to have to wait a little longer to torture people as a goose.
5955720	5958720	But at least it won't lay an egg as a game.
5958720	5960720	Yes, hopefully.
5960720	5965720	This was a game that I actually played the game jam version of.
5965720	5969720	There was a proof of concept called Baba is You.
5969720	5974720	And it's kind of a puzzle game with game logic in there.
5974720	5979720	So they have, for example, you walk around, you can push things or pick up things.
5979720	5986720	So you can change, oh, key is you, or baba is open, or something like that.
5986720	5990720	And you can change the logic in the game to solve puzzles.
5990720	5991720	It's pretty clever.
5991720	5992720	That's a clever concept.
5992720	5994720	Using logic gates and logic puzzles.
5994720	5998720	It's very interesting in how you solve some of the puzzles.
5998720	6003720	So they have it coming out now on PC, Mac, and Nintendo Switch March 13th.
6003720	6005720	So that's actually going to be a full game pretty soon.
6005720	6008720	So pretty awesome to see that's coming out of there.
6008720	6015720	And this one had me very excited because I loved this game when I first saw it back at Sac Indie Arcade.
6015720	6018720	It is a local dev that's putting this out.
6018720	6021720	It's a game called Black Future 88.
6021720	6028720	And it's just this really cool cyberpunk 2D action roguelike shooter game.
6028720	6034720	And it's going to be coming out on PC and Nintendo Switch as well pretty soon.
6034720	6037720	We should reach out and try to get them on the show if they're here.
6037720	6038720	Yes. Very awesome.
6038720	6043720	And it was awesome when I played it, and it looks even more awesome now.
6043720	6044720	Good for them.
6044720	6045720	Definitely going to be checking that out.
6045720	6046720	That's great.
6046720	6047720	All right.
6047720	6050720	Moving on to some stories that I have over here.
6050720	6054720	Kunio-kun, that series, which is River City Ransom.
6054720	6055720	It's those characters, right?
6055720	6056720	Yeah.
6056720	6057720	Dodgeball.
6057720	6061720	They're going to be getting another game on PC, PlayStation 4, and Switch.
6061720	6064720	And I guess it's, well, I mean, the Switch is region-free.
6064720	6065720	Yeah.
6065720	6066720	So you'd be able to play it anywhere.
6066720	6072720	But this is a new version of River City Melee Battle Royale Special.
6072720	6077720	So the game is actually called Downtown Rantou Koushin Koyoku Mak.
6077720	6080720	So that is, it's kind of like a reimagined version of that game from 2016,
6080720	6082720	which is on the PC and PS4,
6082720	6087720	which in turn was a new version of River City Super Sports Challenge
6087720	6091720	All-Star Special for the PC and PlayStation 3.
6091720	6093720	Which, you know, again, the River City group,
6093720	6096720	they were also in the dodgeball games, which are insanely possible.
6096720	6101720	So seeing them in the sports universe, not a completely crazy concept.
6101720	6103720	It is also going to be an arena brawler concept.
6103720	6106720	New items and modes, create a character.
6106720	6107720	That'll be fun.
6107720	6109720	Probably sometime this year.
6109720	6110720	How about a battle royale mode?
6110720	6111720	Why not?
6111720	6112720	A hundred people in the ring.
6112720	6113720	One lives.
6113720	6114720	Why not?
6114720	6115720	River City Ransom Battle Royale game.
6115720	6116720	Why not?
6116720	6117720	I love that.
6117720	6118720	That's where everything else is going.
6118720	6119720	Let's do it.
6119720	6126720	And this is getting a lot of eyes this week, is a trademark that Square Enix filed.
6126720	6134720	The trademark that they filed in Europe and North America is called Collection of Mana.
6134720	6138720	Just like something that they released in Japan.
6138720	6141720	They did not have to file said trademark because it's already out.
6141720	6144720	And it was that, of course, collection for the Switch that contains
6144720	6148720	Second Detsetsu 1, 2, and 3.
6148720	6152720	Which Second Detsetsu 2 is, of course, out here as Secret of Mana.
6152720	6155720	And Second Detsetsu 3 is one of those infamous Super Nintendo games.
6155720	6161720	Never came out here, but I'm sure a lot of y'all played it through ROM hack translation patches anyway.
6161720	6162720	So it'd be very interesting.
6162720	6163720	I mean, who knows?
6163720	6164720	They might not include it.
6164720	6166720	They might release it over here and not include that.
6166720	6169720	It would just be the regular Secret of Mana and the Game Boy game or whatever.
6169720	6171720	But maybe they will.
6171720	6173720	And that would be pretty cool.
6173720	6177720	Especially, you know, when Octopath Traveler did pretty well.
6177720	6182720	Maybe Square Enix is probably looking to take more risks on the Switch.
6182720	6183720	We'll see.
6183720	6184720	That'd be great.
6184720	6189720	Bob Coffee in chat says, hopefully we get Second 3 finally officially localized.
6189720	6191720	I mean, that would be the best part.
6191720	6195720	I mean, nothing against those translators who worked their ass off to make this happen.
6195720	6202720	But to have the official version of that and Square, you know, it would feel really good to see that finally after all these years.
6202720	6203720	Yeah.
6203720	6211720	Anyhow, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of things that are coming out a little sooner than Collection of Mana, which is a rumor anyway.
6211720	6212720	But these are happening for sure.
6212720	6218720	Yes, so this week we've got Dirt Rally 2.0 on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6218720	6224720	We have Stellaris, the console edition on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6224720	6229720	We have the LEGO Movie 2 video game on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6229720	6235720	And Trials Rising on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6235720	6241720	Alien League on PC, Dead or Alive 6 on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6241720	6247720	Swords and Soldiers 2, Shormageddon on the Nintendo Switch.
6247720	6254720	And last but not least, Toejam and Earl back in the groove on PC, Mac, Linux, Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
6254720	6256720	Interesting. I forgot they were bringing that back.
6256720	6258720	Yes, it's back.
6258720	6263720	All right. Well, going over to Japan and looking at the releases over there, Dead or Alive 6 also coming out in Japan.
6263720	6267720	It looks like it's a worldwide release day on March 1st, same day it hits the US.
6267720	6271720	Just before that, on February 28th, we have some other releases in Japan.
6271720	6273720	It's kind of a busy week, actually.
6273720	6280720	A game called Noratu Ojutou Noraniko Heart 2 comes out in regular as well as some limited edition.
6280720	6284720	This game has the subtitle Nora, Princess, and Crying Cat.
6284720	6289720	That is the game. There's actually a little cat that's in the logo, like this little shadow.
6289720	6290720	But is it crying?
6290720	6292720	I can't tell because it's kind of from far away, so I don't know.
6292720	6297720	It just looks like, you know, it looks like another one of those anime turned into a video game type of things,
6297720	6299720	but I don't think it's anything they'd ever release over here.
6299720	6302720	But you had me at cat.
6302720	6307720	Leather games coming out in Japan, Left Alive, Wizard Symphony, all on PlayStation 4.
6307720	6313720	Shinsun no Jushin Tante no Jikinbo comes out as well.
6313720	6320720	Ride 3 also in Japan, Work Cross Work, Forgotten Anne, and Trials Rising also coming out in Japan.
6320720	6323720	It's a very busy week, and that's just all on the PlayStation 4.
6323720	6329720	On the Switch, Darius Cosmic Collection, that's pretty cool, in a regular and special edition.
6329720	6335720	That Noratu Ojutou, the Crying Cat thing, that's also on the Switch as well.
6335720	6342720	As well as a game called Boku no Kanojo wa Ningyo Hime comes out there as well.
6342720	6346720	And a Doraemon game, Doraemon Nobita no Getsumen Tansaki.
6346720	6351720	And, oh my god, this is great, a game called My Girlfriend is a Mermaid?
6351720	6354720	Well, bitch, she might be.
6354720	6357720	It's like Splash all over again.
6357720	6360720	I'm going back to the Darius Collection because that's pretty rad, yeah.
6360720	6367720	Darius 2, Sengaya, which was the Darius 2 overseas version, and Darius Gaiden.
6367720	6370720	So, busy week. That's cool.
6370720	6373720	That's your Japanese releases. How about Europe?
6373720	6376720	Europe has 8-Bit Invaders coming out on PlayStation 4.
6376720	6380720	Dirt Rally 2.0 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.
6380720	6385720	Nier Automata Game of the Year, or Game of the Yora edition.
6385720	6387720	Haha, pun.
6387720	6389720	That's on PlayStation 4.
6389720	6393720	Trials Rising Gold on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and the Switch.
6393720	6400720	Aces of the Luftwaffe Squadron edition, that's on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and the Switch.
6400720	6403720	Rad Rogers Radical Edition on the Switch.
6403720	6407720	Crash Dummy on PlayStation 4 and the Switch.
6407720	6410720	Dead or Alive 6 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6410720	6414720	The Lego Movie Video Game on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6414720	6420720	And, let's see, Dark Souls Trilogy on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6420720	6421720	That's it.
6422720	6427720	Alright, every week we invite your emails at participate at orangeloungeradio.com
6427720	6430720	and we read your emails here live on the air.
6430720	6433720	So, again, that email address, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.
6433720	6436720	First email tonight from our good pal YYR.
6436720	6438720	He likes to chime in with his thoughts.
6438720	6439720	So, YYR starts us off tonight.
6439720	6443720	Hello, LR. I was literally just listening to last week's show
6443720	6446720	and I wanted to address something you guys mentioned in rapid fire news.
6446720	6448720	Microsoft Solitaire Collection.
6448720	6450720	Yes, it's still included with Windows today.
6450720	6453720	However, it's not quite free. It's free to play.
6453720	6454720	I wish I was joking.
6454720	6456720	The thing is filled with ads.
6456720	6459720	If you want to remove the ads, you have to buy an in-app purchase in order to do that.
6459720	6462720	You know, now that he's saying that, I do remember that.
6462720	6465720	Like, when I played so many levels, like to play another level,
6465720	6469720	it was like, here's a crappy ad for something you'll never actually play.
6469720	6470720	And, yeah, you had to sit through that.
6470720	6474720	So, now, I just, I had blacked that out of my mind.
6474720	6476720	Can you blame me on that?
6476720	6479720	Anyway, if you want to remove the ads, you'll have to buy an in-app purchase in order to do that.
6479720	6481720	But, here's the real kick in the ass.
6481720	6487720	The purchase is a subscription that costs $1.50 a month or $10 a year.
6487720	6490720	And, when the subscription expires, the ads come back.
6490720	6495720	Not worth it. I'm deleting that off my system.
6495720	6497720	Now, y'all got to make a choice.
6497720	6498720	Y'all got to make a choice.
6498720	6499720	Do I even have Solitaire?
6499720	6502720	You want ad-free Solitaire or you want Grinder Extra?
6502720	6503720	What are you going to do?
6503720	6507720	By the way, I checked the latest user reviews
6507720	6511720	and, apparently, the recent supposed improvements are controversial.
6511720	6515720	Lots of folks recently left one-star reviews asking for the old version back.
6515720	6517720	So, I'll just say this.
6517720	6521720	If you're feeling nostalgic and want to play Solitaire or Minesweeper on Windows,
6521720	6525720	just copy the Windows 7 versions from someone who's still running Windows 7.
6525720	6527720	Done deal. I'm sure they're out there on the internet.
6527720	6530720	I just uninstalled it. Take that, Microsoft.
6530720	6532720	I will not play a crappy Solitaire game.
6532720	6537720	Before I go, I know that you were asking for streams or videos to run
6537720	6539720	during the post-classic Game of the Week break.
6539720	6543720	I could certainly contribute a few videos of my current and upcoming games,
6543720	6546720	but I'm not usually about shameless self-promotion.
6546720	6547720	What do you think?
6547720	6548720	Have a great week.
6548720	6549720	YYR.
6549720	6550720	I need to make some of those. You know what?
6550720	6551720	Yeah.
6551720	6552720	I do need to do that.
6552720	6553720	Here's the thing.
6553720	6555720	I have an idea for how to fill it in.
6555720	6557720	I will probably do a spotlight.
6557720	6560720	But this is like the default when nothing else exists.
6560720	6562720	I will probably spotlight a free game.
6562720	6566720	Meaning like in the Epic Store, they've been giving away those free games.
6566720	6568720	Sometimes you get them on Steam too.
6568720	6570720	Or itch.io, of course.
6570720	6572720	Great indie place to play lots of free games.
6572720	6576720	Speaking of which, I was going to say Epic Game Store has Thimbleweed Park.
6576720	6577720	Have you played that yet?
6577720	6578720	I haven't, but I grabbed it.
6578720	6580720	And so if we don't get anything for next week,
6580720	6581720	we'll probably see that.
6581720	6582720	It is a great game.
6582720	6583720	Yes.
6583720	6585720	So here's the thing.
6585720	6587720	But I would actually rather it not be me.
6587720	6589720	You see enough of me on this program.
6589720	6594720	So I would happily solicit somewhere between 7 to 10,
6594720	6598720	no more than 12 minute segments to run during the break,
6598720	6601720	or during the in-studio break for us to rest our voices,
6601720	6603720	use the potty, get water, things like that.
6603720	6605720	You know, things that we do to keep a show going.
6605720	6608720	Because a regular radio show would have full length commercial breaks
6608720	6609720	for people to do that.
6609720	6610720	We don't have that.
6610720	6613720	So I would like to welcome other Twitch contributors,
6613720	6616720	and Twitch streamers, and game makers, and game developers.
6616720	6619720	You know, as long as it's not just a flat out commercial,
6619720	6622720	but especially YYR, you've been working with our show for forever.
6622720	6626720	I think it would be really cool if you kind of had somebody
6626720	6629720	who's a Twitch streamer show off one of your games.
6629720	6631720	That would be really cool.
6631720	6634720	You know, because I'd like to spotlight some other indie creators
6634720	6635720	here on Twitch.
6635720	6638720	And that could even be 10 minutes of your own podcast.
6638720	6640720	I ain't worried about competition.
6640720	6643720	There's plenty of time in the day to listen to lots of stuff,
6643720	6644720	and a lot of the stuff is on demand.
6644720	6647720	So anyway, if you'd like to contribute something like that,
6647720	6648720	please get in touch with me.
6648720	6650720	You can reach out on Twitter at MrRobRoberts,
6650720	6653720	or you can email me directly, rob at voggenetwork.com.
6653720	6656720	And I would be very interested in having those types of segments
6656720	6658720	for the future.
6658720	6661720	And you know, if we get flooded with them, you know what?
6661720	6664720	We could do something after OLR.
6664720	6665720	We could play a segment after it,
6665720	6667720	because we kind of don't have a lot on Twitch afterwards.
6667720	6671720	We could play something maybe even before, during Bobby's show on us.
6671720	6674720	So I'm not worried about getting swarmed with content.
6674720	6677720	But I don't want outright commercials.
6677720	6680720	But when it comes to indie stuff, is it really a commercial?
6680720	6683720	Because a lot of indie folks have a really hard time getting their word out.
6683720	6684720	You know what I mean?
6684720	6685720	Yeah.
6685720	6687720	And I also, of course, would open it up to chatters.
6687720	6689720	What would you guys like to see in our breaks?
6689720	6691720	Because yeah, this is something that's going to start next week.
6691720	6695720	So if we don't get anything, then it's going to be me playing Thimbleweed Park.
6695720	6697720	That's what you're going to get for the break next week.
6697720	6700720	Like I did Tetris 99 last week.
6700720	6703720	But if we do start getting things, then I'd rather play those.
6703720	6707720	But I just want all our content creators who want to be on the break,
6707720	6710720	remember, it's a podcast too.
6710720	6712720	So keep that in the back of your mind.
6712720	6715720	You can't just say, look at this, look at that, look at this.
6715720	6716720	You have to talk us through.
6716720	6721720	And remember, we have folks that are also visually impaired who listen to this show and so forth.
6721720	6724720	So we've got to keep them in our minds as well.
6724720	6728720	So as Joe 100 Matt says, I would love to do more videos,
6728720	6731720	but my day job takes up so much of my day to day life.
6731720	6733720	I have a few ideas, but they do take time for me.
6733720	6735720	I wouldn't expect any one person to do this every single week.
6735720	6737720	In fact, I think that's actually a bad idea.
6737720	6743720	It would be great if there were like 10 people that did it on like a rotating thing.
6743720	6744720	You know what I mean?
6744720	6746720	I'll find something to put together.
6746720	6749720	I have all this footage of me playing DDR that I put together.
6749720	6750720	Why not?
6750720	6752720	Okay, here's the one caution with DDR.
6752720	6754720	The problem is that license music.
6754720	6756720	Well, I just pick a non-license song.
6756720	6758720	Yeah, as long as you're picking Konami originals, it should be fine.
6758720	6760720	I'm not as worried about getting muted with that stuff.
6760720	6761720	Yeah.
6761720	6764720	Anyway, let's see.
6764720	6768720	Motonious Games in chat says, I'm going to start a yellow lounge radio podcast.
6768720	6769720	Big bucks incoming.
6769720	6772720	I actually want to hear a random side tangent, true story.
6772720	6778720	So when we first launched Horde House all those years ago, remember Horde House?
6778720	6780720	It was the sideshow that I did with Exfer and Shane.
6780720	6783720	Originally it was just Exfer and I, but later we had Shane and Grandpa.
6783720	6785720	It was about World of Warcraft because we were like obsessed with it at the time.
6785720	6787720	We played a lot of it.
6787720	6792720	So we ended up naming that show Horde House because I solicited names online
6792720	6795720	and I was like, what would be a funny name for the show?
6795720	6797720	And somebody submitted that and I'm like, I love it.
6797720	6799720	I love it because it's like the double entendre, right?
6799720	6802720	If you say Horde House over, it sounds like something else.
6802720	6804720	I'll leave it at that, right?
6804720	6805720	So we thought that was a funny name.
6805720	6808720	In fact, actually the full name was the best little Horde House in Azeroth.
6808720	6811720	Like I'm beating you over the head with the reference.
6811720	6812720	I think you'd all get it.
6812720	6818720	But my thing was, if we don't get any names, I think we could just be like Warcraft Lounge Radio, right?
6818720	6820720	We'll take, cause it's kind of like a spinoff of Orange Lounge Radio.
6820720	6822720	We'll be Warcraft Lounge Radio.
6822720	6824720	We'll get this. We didn't go with that name.
6824720	6828720	Not even like, like it was like the same week Horde House started
6828720	6830720	or like the week before or the week after.
6830720	6834720	It was like within the same month, a new podcast popped up called Warcraft Lounge Radio.
6834720	6835720	I kid you not.
6835720	6838720	And it had nothing to do with LOLR.
6838720	6840720	People I'd never heard of before.
6840720	6842720	Other Warcraft fans doing their thing, making a podcast.
6842720	6844720	Total fucking coincidence.
6844720	6848720	But I just, I kind of had to step back and I was like, that's really funny.
6848720	6849720	That's really funny.
6849720	6853720	Cause I never said this on the show that I was thinking about doing a Warcraft thing, right?
6853720	6858720	It's just that one of those funny fucking coincidences where somebody had the same idea.
6858720	6859720	So, anyway.
6859720	6863720	But it all worked out great cause some people came to LOLR because of Horde House.
6863720	6869720	I'm sad that that show isn't still on but the reality is nobody had the passion for those types of games.
6870720	6871720	You know, anymore.
6871720	6873720	Kind of would like come and go and stuff.
6873720	6875720	But everybody's doing some other type of content.
6875720	6877720	Like Xfer has a Twitch channel.
6877720	6881720	Grandpa's still working with Starboard Power Coupling.
6881720	6886720	Which is, you know, if you're obsessed.com with Star Trek Discovery, as you should be.
6886720	6888720	That's a great companion thing to be listening to.
6888720	6890720	So check out Starboard Power Coupling.
6890720	6895720	And then Shane, you know, he's not doing his ranger pride now.
6895720	6897720	But I'm sure he'll think of something in the future.
6897720	6899720	He pops in on this show and my own streams and stuff.
6899720	6903720	So you still see all those guys around making their own things somewhere else.
6903720	6904720	So, anyway.
6904720	6906720	Ooh, that was a big tangent.
6906720	6907720	Let's see.
6907720	6911720	Going to chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.
6911720	6917720	S2100matt says, I would watch a video of Loki showing how he mods his DDR machine.
6917720	6919720	Then again, that kind of promotes piracy.
6919720	6920720	Yeah, you gotta watch that stuff.
6920720	6923720	Just remember, everything you do is being recorded, right?
6923720	6925720	Oh, how he mod it?
6925720	6927720	Yeah, I mean, I wish it was complicated.
6927720	6934720	But all it really is is literally just swapping out the drive for a DVD drive that's compatible with.
6934720	6937720	And then popping any burned disc off the internet.
6937720	6942720	Which is ironic because I'm still playing Extreme because all the other mods didn't work quite right.
6942720	6944720	So I'm back to Extreme again.
6944720	6949720	I'm running it off the mod disc because I'm too afraid to try to pop the original disc back in there.
6949720	6951720	Because I may have to reinstall everything.
6951720	6953720	And, yeah.
6953720	6957720	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, bring it back as a Phantasy Star Online Blueburst podcast.
6957720	6959720	Hey, hey, you tease.
6959720	6961720	But I think that's also really good.
6961720	6963720	It's a livestream kind of thing.
6963720	6966720	And then Bob Coffee says, disco is really great.
6966720	6968720	Most Star Trek asked Star Trek in like 84 years.
6968720	6971720	But nobody was saying that after the first season.
6971720	6972720	Isn't that funny?
6972720	6974720	It's almost like the first season was just like all set.
6974720	6975720	The first season was just a setup.
6975720	6977720	It's all it was to get us to this point.
6977720	6980720	And now, now, like, engage, right?
6980720	6981720	Now we're going.
6981720	6985720	Anyway, and then, like I said, Beetlejuice three times.
6985720	6986720	Shane showed up in chat.
6986720	6988720	I'm not doing anything. You're right.
6988720	6990720	But you're here.
6990720	6991720	You're showing up here.
6991720	6993720	You show up on my livestream.
6993720	6997720	And, you know, Shane, we should, like, do a show about, like, Pokemon.
6997720	6998720	Wouldn't that be a lot of fun?
6998720	7000720	Because I play a lot of Pokemon Go.
7000720	7002720	Oh, yeah, wait, we tried that.
7002720	7005720	Hey, but if shaking and crying can come back, anything's possible, right?
7005720	7006720	Who knows?
7006720	7007720	Who knows?
7007720	7010720	Maybe Shane will find a show he wants to do in the future.
7010720	7014720	Just do, like, the best little Pokestop and just kind of combine all of them.
7014720	7017720	Do you remember there was a, the whole thing, there was a Pokestop podcast.
7017720	7018720	Do you remember that?
7018720	7019720	Yes, I remember there was a Pokestop podcast.
7019720	7020720	That's what I'm saying.
7020720	7025720	You mesh all the shows you don't really have enough passion for together to make one show.
7025720	7027720	Just kind of combine the passion.
7027720	7028720	This is Katamari.
7028720	7029720	Yes.
7029720	7031720	Katamari, but game fandom.
7031720	7032720	Yeah, some of that.
7032720	7033720	All right, anyway.
7033720	7034720	Look, we got to get to another email.
7034720	7035720	Fandomari.
7035720	7036720	Fandomari.
7036720	7038720	Oh, my God, that's a good name for a show.
7038720	7039720	That's a good, patent pending.
7039720	7044720	All right.
7044720	7049720	Our last and second email tonight for Dark Tetsuya, who's in our chat room, but he used
7049720	7056720	an email to expand on his thoughts, which I appreciate, which is a Damon Cross Machina.
7056720	7059720	I don't know if I'm saying the name of that game right.
7059720	7061720	The thoughts, the demo impressions.
7061720	7062720	Remember, I didn't watch the direct.
7062720	7064720	I was only able to get the play by play on Twitter.
7064720	7066720	So I don't even know if I'm saying it right.
7066720	7067720	But anyway.
7067720	7068720	It's Damon X Machina.
7068720	7069720	That's OK.
7069720	7070720	So I was I was close.
7070720	7071720	All right.
7071720	7072720	Hey, O.L.R.
7072720	7076720	So with the release of the preview of Damon X Machina, I checked it out as soon as it
7076720	7078720	launched and spent the week trying to complete it.
7078720	7081720	So I wanted to send my impressions of the demo right out of the gate.
7081720	7084720	You can customize your avatar's appearance in his or her uniform color.
7084720	7085720	Oh, that's more than anthem.
7085720	7086720	I'll let you do.
7086720	7088720	I said I said I wouldn't be shady.
7088720	7089720	I'm sorry.
7089720	7090720	All right.
7090720	7095800	To make it whatever you want, as well as various customization options for your mech, different
7095800	7100480	parts, weapons and some internal upgrades, as well as, of course, customizes paint job
7100480	7103440	as well and add decals to put on your neck.
7103440	7106200	Looks like there will be a wide variety of parts.
7106200	7110360	And then you're thrown into your first tutorial mission to get a feel for the game.
7110360	7111360	Controls are pretty simple.
7111360	7115020	One button for each arm and one, I believe, for secondary weapons like missiles.
7115020	7119400	And you can also use jump jets to fly over everything or descend back onto the ground,
7119400	7122640	as well as a dash maneuver to avoid enemies and gunfire.
7122640	7125600	Lock on is automatic, though the camera doesn't lock on enemies.
7125600	7126600	You have to track it yourself.
7126600	7130080	But once you get the hang of the controls, it becomes second nature and you'll be flying,
7130080	7133160	dashing and dodging enemies and returning fire with ease.
7133160	7136720	The music is pretty cool with a very heavy metal inspired soundtrack.
7136720	7140360	Works pretty well in the background of giant robots blowing stuff up.
7140360	7141360	The demo is pretty generous.
7141360	7145640	You get the tutorial mission and three extra ones, culminating with a fight against a giant
7145640	7147880	spider tank mech.
7147880	7149140	Rad.
7149140	7152360	This is definitely the toughest mission I've come across, so you might be at this one for
7152360	7153360	a while.
7153360	7156520	Overall, I was quite happy with what the developers came up with in this game.
7156520	7161320	They've even sent out a survey to demo players to get their thoughts and anything they might
7161320	7162840	want to change or improve.
7162840	7166640	So I'm definitely looking forward to playing the final game.
7166640	7167800	Thank you very much for sharing your thoughts.
7167800	7171960	I appreciate the little mini review, especially when I have not gotten around to playing it
7171960	7172960	myself.
7172960	7173960	But you did.
7173960	7174960	And you weren't as glowing.
7174960	7178640	I mean, I got bored after the first mission, so maybe it gets better, but I just didn't
7178640	7179640	care.
7179640	7181200	Do you think maybe you need to go back and just play a few more missions to see?
7181200	7182200	I didn't want to.
7182200	7183200	Like, I don't know.
7184080	7187400	I basically went to that because I got frustrated playing Tetris 99.
7187400	7188760	Well, I wouldn't say get frustrated.
7188760	7192240	I just got bored with it because you can only play you can probably play that for like a
7192240	7193240	little bit.
7193240	7197120	And it's just like, eh, I'm tired of playing Tetris, so I'll try this out.
7197120	7200720	And then I it just didn't really click with me, I guess.
7200720	7202520	I mean, doesn't mean it's a bad game.
7202520	7205280	I just sure didn't really draw in Fortnite.
7205280	7208940	Like I've really tried with Fortnite, but it's just not it doesn't I haven't tried any
7208940	7209940	of the battle royale games.
7209940	7211360	I just don't really have an interest in them.
7211400	7213560	So I know a lot of people play them.
7213560	7215760	I think it'd be more fun, like playing in a group of people.
7215760	7217360	I'm going to try Apex again.
7217360	7218360	I am.
7218360	7219840	I especially on PlayStation 4.
7219840	7223200	Is it easier to party up in Apex?
7223200	7226120	You get thrown in matchmaking and it just gives you two random people.
7226120	7229440	Oh, and I suppose you're at the mercy of who you get, but you can have a party of people.
7229440	7230440	Oh, sure.
7230440	7231440	You can.
7231440	7232440	Yeah.
7232440	7233440	You get bonuses, too, if you party with other people.
7233440	7234440	OK.
7234440	7235440	So you can definitely do that.
7235440	7236440	So.
7236440	7237440	Yeah.
7237440	7238440	Anyhow.
7238440	7239440	Let's see other comments in our chat.
7239520	7242680	Articio says, I know it's not for everyone, but I really got into it.
7242680	7244040	Quest Buster says demo is fun.
7244040	7245280	It needed cyber legs.
7245280	7250760	Got cyber legs at depth, pointing out as far as battle royales go, Tetris 99 is so good.
7250760	7251760	That's a good battle.
7251760	7252760	We're good.
7252760	7253760	Yeah, that's a good one to get your feet wet on.
7253760	7259840	So I am here for more like of those types of like mega multiplayer games in different
7259840	7260840	genres.
7260840	7262080	Dr. Mario 99.
7262080	7263080	Sure.
7263080	7264520	We can do a couple more puzzle games.
7264520	7269880	But how about how about in Super Mario Maker, 100 people take on the same level at once
7269880	7273720	with all these shadow Mario's bouncing everywhere would be hilarious.
7273720	7274720	I don't know.
7274720	7276720	I think it'd be fun.
7276720	7277720	All right.
7277720	7278720	Anyhow.
7278720	7282760	Oh, Miltonia's games from my heart.
7282760	7284320	One versus 100.
7284320	7286680	The original battle royale game show battle royale.
7286680	7287680	Of course.
7287680	7288680	Of course.
7288680	7289680	Maybe something Jackbox.
7289680	7291680	Because we we talked about this on the show.
7291680	7292680	I don't repeat myself too much.
7292680	7295920	Jackbox, you know, they build their games for lots and lots of people, but you sort
7295920	7299000	of have to like invite people there.
7299000	7301360	They don't match make people for those games, really.
7301360	7303920	So because, you know, it kind of would alter that party atmosphere.
7303920	7307000	But I would love to see a Jackbox game with matchmaking.
7307000	7308640	I think there's an audience for that.
7308640	7311560	I think there's an audience for a game that you don't just play with your friends.
7311560	7313400	You play with strangers.
7313400	7319280	And oh, my God, like patent pending, Jackbox, how about a game called like talk to strangers
7319280	7321400	or a game called strangers with candy?
7321400	7323960	Well, maybe that would conflict with the TV.
7323960	7324960	Stranger danger.
7324960	7326040	Stranger danger.
7326040	7327040	Come on.
7327040	7328040	There's a there's an untapped.
7328040	7329040	Do we have anybody?
7329040	7330040	Jackbox still listens to the show.
7330040	7334640	There's an untapped well here of like games you play in matchmaking stuff, these mega
7334640	7335640	games.
7335640	7340560	But the whole joke is that it's people you don't know and how sick they can be a stranger
7340560	7341560	danger.
7341560	7342920	That's a great name for a Jackbox game.
7342920	7343920	Oh, my God.
7343920	7344920	I hope they're watching.
7344920	7345920	All right.
7345920	7346920	Candy van.
7346920	7347920	Candy van.
7348440	7353160	They need to do a whole Jackbox party packages like battle royale type games, but game shows
7353160	7354480	I would so be here.
7354480	7357760	I don't know what their battle royale type game would be, but I'm totally down to see
7357760	7358760	what it would be.
7358760	7362120	Just do another voting game, another voting on like what's funnier.
7362120	7368080	But then I think what they're probably worried about is that if you let people enter in anything,
7368080	7372120	it's always going to go to, you know, dicks, butts, boobs, right?
7372120	7373780	Like somebody's just going to put that as their answer.
7373780	7376160	You could put in like, who is your favorite president?
7376400	7380000	And somebody's going to put dicks, butts, boobs, right?
7380000	7383000	It's going to it's going to be ding ding.
7383000	7385440	And then that answer is going to get like 40 votes.
7385440	7388880	And then it's like, oh, I let my seven year old play your filth ass game.
7388880	7391280	And I'm a very upset parent because I didn't watch him.
7391280	7392280	That's why it's emirated.
7392280	7393280	So, you know, anyway.
7393280	7398920	Well, I still remember back in the day with Acrophobia, which is a very similar thing.
7398920	7403060	I mean, I think that Berkeley systems that made Acrophobia like a lot of those people
7403060	7404800	are like Jackbox games now.
7404800	7405800	Right.
7405940	7415040	They had Acrophobia split into mature rooms where every acronym was like, you know, dicks,
7415040	7417880	butts, fart, you know, pussy.
7417880	7420840	Like it's just like every acronym is just like every dirty word you think of.
7420840	7421840	Right.
7421840	7425880	But then there was the clean rooms and their expectation was that in the clean rooms you
7425880	7427920	play, you know, the not dirty stuff.
7427920	7432280	And, you know, obviously the better experience obviously was in the clean rooms for the for
7432280	7433280	the game.
7433280	7438280	I still am hoping someday that they come up with a online version of Eat Poop You Cat
7438280	7442200	because it's just the best.
7442200	7443200	Yeah.
7443200	7446640	Miltonius Games suggests a new title, Strangers with Cookies.
7446640	7450040	That's I like it's a good like, you know what you mean?
7450040	7453720	Anyway, I feel like we should be charging our one of our favorite gaming companies for
7453720	7455400	a consultation right now.
7455400	7458400	Anyway, at least a special thanks credit will be great.
7458400	7459880	It's a little special thanks credit.
7459880	7460880	So we ask.
7460880	7461880	All right.
7462600	7463600	Moving on.
7466120	7467120	That was it for emails.
7467120	7469040	Well, we got on quite a tangent with that email, but it was a good one.
7469040	7471920	So anyway, let's get to some more news.
7471920	7474200	Oh, I'm so happy to get back into the news.
7474200	7475200	Yeah.
7475200	7476200	Not with this story.
7476200	7477200	More layout.
7477200	7478200	Not with this.
7478200	7479200	This is horrible.
7479200	7488940	So EA, they have, I guess, apparently laid off some people from their Australian studio.
7488980	7494620	So apparently it was previously Iron Monkey and Fireman Studios.
7494620	7497020	And now it's, I guess, EA Australia.
7497020	7503600	They were known for making Real Racing 3, The Sims Freeplay, and Need for Speed No Limits.
7503600	7507800	And apparently they were also developing Real Racing 4, but I don't know if that's going
7507800	7509980	to happen.
7509980	7515060	They said that they haven't really talked about it's going to be close to.
7516060	7520620	Yeah, they had a number, about 200 people at Firemonkeys, and they were saying that
7520620	7528420	they were going to be estimating that 80 to 100 people were going to be laid off.
7528420	7533420	But apparently that's now dropped down to 40 to 50, but still that's a pretty good chunk
7533420	7537420	of their staff that's going to be laid off.
7537420	7543600	And then they were saying the Firemonkeys studio is working on some of the most popular
7543600	7544600	mobile games.
7544640	7550800	We recently made the decision to shift teams to focus on more of our live services and
7550800	7555600	to have entered into a consultation period that may impact some roles in the studio.
7555600	7559840	We're working to match skills with opportunities as we go through this period, identifying
7559840	7564880	other opportunities at EA and providing as much help to our employees as we possibly
7564880	7565880	can.
7565880	7573360	And then they declined to talk about Real Racing 4, whether it's canceled or not.
7574000	7575360	That sucks.
7575360	7582000	And then on top of that, outside of EA, apparently the arena net is also going to be laying off
7582000	7584480	people as well.
7584480	7590360	There was an email that went out to employees from their CEO saying our lives, our live
7590360	7596760	games business revenue is declining as our franchises age and delays in development on
7596760	7603840	PC and mobile have created further drains against our revenue projects while operating
7603840	7606680	costs in the west have increased.
7606680	7613920	We are not sustainable and it's not going to set us up for future success.
7613920	7617000	So they have to cut costs across the organization.
7617000	7621760	Well that's obviously extremely disappointing, but at the same time, I look at arena net,
7621760	7624960	they did Guild Wars 2, but that was how many years ago?
7624960	7630040	And Guild Wars 2 doesn't charge a monthly fee, so I know there's been expansions and
7630040	7633800	there's been other ways that they've been able to get money from the player base, but
7633800	7638800	I feel like the lifespan of a game like Guild Wars 2 probably is about up, and we haven't
7638800	7643880	heard of a Guild Wars 3 or anything, I mean I don't know what other games arena net even
7643880	7647840	works on, which is probably part of the problem unfortunately, is that I associate them with
7647840	7653240	Guild Wars and not a lot else, and it's just unfortunate.
7653240	7658360	I wish they had something else they were working on that there was more awareness about that
7658360	7659360	might...
7659360	7663840	Yeah, they said that right now they have about 400 employees, and they haven't said how many
7663840	7670600	employees are going to be affected by this, so I guess we'll have to wait and see, maybe
7670600	7673880	later this week we'll understand what the impact is going to be on that, but that's
7673880	7674880	unfortunate.
7674880	7679240	I was trying to see what else, what other games arena net does, and there was Guild
7679240	7683680	Wars, and there was five expansions for Guild Wars, and there was Guild Wars 2, and three
7683680	7688400	expansions for Guild Wars 2, that's actually it.
7688400	7692580	I was reminded though, is that, because I'm just looking at Wikipedia, a great place to
7692580	7698280	just kind of get my mind reminded of certain things, there was a controversy a little while
7698280	7703960	ago that went down on Twitter, I don't want to rehash that old controversy, but perhaps
7703960	7707200	you just remember there was some stuff going on with arena net and some of the writing
7707200	7712580	and so forth that happened about a year ago, I mean I don't know if there was a significant
7712580	7718660	fallout from that, but certainly that coupled with the age of the game, coupled with there's
7718660	7723440	nothing on their plate besides these Guild Wars games and no sign of the Guild Wars 3,
7723440	7729520	it doesn't add up unfortunately to a very lovely scenario, but again I hate it because
7729520	7734080	I don't like to hear people losing their jobs and so forth, I hope again they can get the
7734080	7739360	capital, get the investment, the financing to start a new project, a lot of these folks
7739360	7744600	got expertise developing online games, I know people that love Guild Wars, and heck, the
7744600	7749280	people that founded arena net used to work for Blizzard, so sometimes you take these
7749280	7753560	skills and take them other places.
7753560	7758520	Questbuster in chat points out they just had a big event in Guild Wars 2 to end a big story
7758520	7762260	arc, so it does kind of sound like the game's probably ramping down, but I'm sure the original
7762260	7767700	Guild Wars still has people playing it, you know, hello, I just talked about that we're
7767700	7772060	playing Phantasy Star online, there's just always going to be online games you remember
7772060	7776540	you want to go visit, and those games really lend themselves to being able to do it, right?
7776540	7777540	Yeah.
7777540	7783660	So anyway, well wishes, I mean they haven't laid off yet, they're trying to not do what
7783660	7787540	Activision just did and they're trying to really warn people and this whole thing, right,
7787540	7789540	is this not my understanding?
7789540	7790540	Yeah.
7790540	7794260	Well, and they haven't really said how many are going to be affected yet, so.
7794260	7795260	Yeah.
7795260	7796260	Hope it goes okay.
7796260	7801620	Alright, anyway, let's move on to somebody that's profiting in a different way, you guys
7801620	7806540	probably are familiar with a popular game streamer who's been on talk shows and things
7806540	7813000	like that, Ninja, whose real name is Tyler Blevins, who I will admit I haven't really
7813000	7817500	watched, I have seen some of his appearances on these other things, I have seen the ads
7817500	7820820	that popped in his stream for some of the festivals he was working with, but I'm not
7820820	7825900	very familiar with his content, but that's not shade against him, props to him, he does
7825900	7831380	something, he's done it very well, and as long as he is spreading a message of positivity
7831380	7838700	for the community and not a message of being an asshole, then hooray for you, right?
7838700	7840180	Like I got nothing against him.
7840180	7841180	Is he a positive guy?
7841180	7842180	I don't know.
7842180	7846420	Uh oh, alright, well then maybe I'm better off being ignorant in this case.
7846420	7854820	Alright, but anyway, apparently he's teaming up with Wicked Cool Toys, who's doing, I guess,
7854820	7858660	like not just like a t-shirt and stickers and that sort of thing, which by the way,
7858660	7863060	if you like to support your favorite streamers with that kind of merchandise, we're working
7863060	7864060	on it.
7864060	7865060	We're working on it.
7865060	7866340	That's what I'm going to say.
7866340	7870620	Bobby's already like, technically if you know where to look, you could already get some
7870620	7874620	Bobby branded stuff, but I'm lagging behind a little bit.
7874620	7881460	Anyway, you can get some two inch collectibles in certain packs, $5 each for little figures,
7881460	7885540	four inch dancing figures for $10 that are themed around the emotes and the characters
7885540	7889380	that are already in the streams, headwear for $20 if you want to have your own blue
7889380	7893740	hair and headband and so forth, and there's other streamers that they're going to be working
7893740	7896380	with as well, I guess, which is pretty cool.
7896380	7900220	So yeah, I mean, everybody does it.
7900220	7904460	Isn't it interesting now how, like, these are the types of things that I would expect
7904460	7909260	around TV shows when I was a kid, like, well, but now this is what kids are considering,
7909260	7910260	right?
7910260	7911260	Your kids watch a lot.
7911260	7912260	Not Ninja, specifically.
7912260	7913300	No, they don't watch Ninja.
7913300	7914300	They watch YouTubers, right?
7914300	7920140	Yeah, they watch YouTubers, like, they kind of go back and forth about who they watch.
7920140	7927640	Like for example, my kids are watching DanTDM again, and DanTDM, he has his own line of
7927640	7934780	toys as well, some figures in his own, like, Minecraft book and stuff.
7934780	7941940	So he's got all that around there, plus there's also, God, stupid Ryan Toy Review, who has
7941940	7944280	his whole Ryan's toys lined up.
7944280	7949980	My youngest son is just bonkers over, and they're just the cheapest piece of shit crap
7949980	7952200	that you can buy, but he loves that stuff.
7952200	7953200	He just doesn't play with it.
7953200	7954200	He just needs it, though.
7954200	7958680	He needs all of it, because Ryan's playing with it and looks up to him, but I mean, that
7958680	7963320	stuff, there's a lot of, like, when you get that big, of course you're gonna have merchandise
7963320	7968720	and make even more money, because it's only smart business, so more power to him, I guess,
7968720	7969960	and it doesn't look like complete crap.
7969960	7975040	At least those are kind of cute, so yeah, more power to him.
7975040	7977240	Yeah, I think it's great.
7977240	7980600	Sorry, I got distracted for a minute, because I was hearing Discord noises, and I couldn't
7980600	7983380	tell if that was coming through on our stream or not.
7983380	7988540	So I thought I shut down Discord, hopefully I did, I'm gonna just quit that way so those
7988540	7992020	sounds don't come through on stream, so sorry if I made you think your Discord noises were
7992020	7996540	going through, but just in general, during the show is not a good time to send me DMs
7996540	7999420	on Discord, just throwing it out there.
7999420	8001380	Very bad time to try to get my attention on Discord.
8001380	8005140	Oh, and they're doing blind box figures, everybody does fucking blind boxes.
8005140	8009140	Unless you are one individual who hosts a show before this one, because you have to
8009140	8011820	tell me things about when I can take the stream and stuff.
8011860	8017100	Alright, anyway, so when are we going to release our figures?
8017100	8019820	We have people asking, when do we get the broccoli farm shirts?
8019820	8022100	I never made them.
8022100	8026520	Alright, anyway, let's move on, we have a few more stories for you guys before we will
8026520	8031380	get to Discord and open that up for your calls in our green room, but first...
8031380	8034460	Someday though, if I have free time, I will definitely design it.
8034460	8036740	First we have a few more stories for you guys.
8036740	8038300	You're taking this one, right, Loki, about the...
8038300	8042340	Yeah, so let's talk a little bit about HoloLens.
8042340	8050780	So Microsoft, some of their employees are demanding that Microsoft terminate their contract
8050780	8054580	with the US military because they feel that they're...
8054580	8057460	Sorry, this is delayed, I have to get this out though, because this made a lightning
8057460	8060260	bolt go off in my head to go, oh, oh, oh!
8060260	8064220	Apricot sushi in our chat, which is not a name I recognize, so hello and welcome, says
8064220	8066980	I was trying to remember what Ninja did that was crappy.
8066980	8071020	She's the guy who said he doesn't stream with female gamers to avoid rumors or something.
8071020	8072540	That was the weird thing.
8072540	8075860	Oh, I thought he also dropped the other F bomb.
8075860	8078660	Oh, I hope, oh, I hope not.
8078660	8082100	On accident, because he was mad at somebody.
8082100	8084140	Okay, that's not cool.
8084140	8087780	If true, that's not cool, but if I don't have the receipts in front of me, I'm not going
8087780	8092660	to pay that on him right now, but in general, please don't...
8092660	8096960	If you have words like that in your vocabulary, and there are other very, very bad ones to
8096960	8101760	that you shouldn't say on stream, you should consider removing them completely from your
8101760	8106080	vocabulary, because there's certain words that you don't say ever.
8106080	8107920	Consider your audience, how about that?
8107920	8108920	That too.
8108920	8109920	Anyhow.
8109920	8117080	Anyways, so there's a group of Microsoft workers that are called Microsoft Workers for Good,
8117080	8125160	and they have basically put together an open letter to their executive saying that, hey,
8125160	8133260	we did not sign up to develop weapons, and we demand a say in how our work is being used,
8133260	8139420	because they had signed a $479 million contract with the army to develop augmented reality
8139420	8144600	technology for use in combat, and they said augmented reality technology will provide
8144600	8152920	troops with more than better information to make decisions, and this new work extends
8152920	8157960	to a long-standing, trusted relationship with the Department of Defense into this new area,
8157960	8163560	and with that, they said, we've worked with the U.S. Department of Defense on a long-standing
8163560	8168360	and reliable basis for four decades, and you'll find Microsoft technology throughout the American
8168360	8173680	military helping power its front office, fuel operations bases, ships, aircraft training
8173680	8179720	facilities, and we're proud of this relationship, as we are of the many military veterans we
8179720	8186600	employ, but still, though, the people that are working on these projects don't like the
8186600	8194280	fact that it's gonna provide increased lethality, mobility, situational awareness necessary
8194280	8201680	to achieve, overmatch against our current and future adversaries.
8201680	8202680	I don't know.
8202680	8205760	So they're just against the whole contract thing, but I don't know if they-
8205760	8211720	This is a complicated story, and one that I'm not sure we can solve here on OLR, even
8211720	8218720	necessary one that we can get into the nitty-gritty details of, but it is fascinating how, and
8218720	8223200	obviously it's about gaming because Microsoft does the gaming stuff, and a lot of people
8223200	8228480	have thought about HoloLens as what's next for gaming because Microsoft has brought it
8228480	8232120	out on stage at E3 and shown the Minecraft and HoloLens and all this stuff.
8232120	8237720	Instead of thinking of it as a way to make soldiers more lethal, I would think of it
8237720	8246720	as a way to prevent, to help the soldiers from not getting killed, I should say, to
8246720	8248280	protect them more.
8248280	8251600	Look at it that way, and it doesn't seem as bad, but if you look at it as like, oh, it's
8251600	8255560	gonna make these future soldiers that are just gonna be super lethal, I don't think
8255560	8256560	that's really what's gonna happen here.
8256560	8259080	Yeah, HoloLens is not gonna turn people into Robocop.
8259080	8260080	Yeah.
8260080	8261080	Yeah.
8261120	8262120	It is very interesting.
8262120	8265640	Well, I mean, but we know, I think now, like HoloLens, and I guess they just announced
8265640	8268520	HoloLens 2 today, because Bobby got into it on his show a little bit.
8268520	8269520	Yes, it looks awesome.
8269520	8274720	Yeah, but, you know, again, not really, and as Bobby pointed out in the trailer, if you
8274720	8276880	watch trailer, you don't see games in that trailer.
8276880	8281520	You see the real world applications, that thing, like fixing cars and bikes and surgeries
8281520	8283440	and things like that, which is really, you know, it's cool.
8283440	8287680	And once again, they don't show the depth, you know, the field of view that's on there.
8287680	8290680	They say it's double in size, but I don't know if it was...
8290680	8295400	The old one was, it wasn't bad, but like, you know, because I've been lucky enough to
8295400	8300080	try one, thanks to Bobby, and, you know, it's, again, I kind of look at it as like a concept
8300080	8303480	thing, and like as a concept, I really enjoyed HoloLens.
8303480	8304480	I really, really did.
8304480	8309400	I almost kind of like, like there's things about it I liked better than VR, and probably
8309400	8312840	a lot of it was the headset, because it felt, you know, it was kind of big, but it wasn't
8312840	8316680	like, you know, it felt a little more, and then this one looks like it's scaled down
8316680	8320960	even more, where it's just like the glasses and so forth, and, you know, the interactive
8320960	8324800	detective game that he was showing me that we were playing, which I know he streamed
8324800	8329980	at some point on his channel, it's probably in his archives, is really neat.
8329980	8334680	Like it's cool that you can like scan the room and stuff, and the actors like participate
8334680	8338800	in the room and everything, so like it definitely has like potential in gaming, even if not
8338800	8344800	fully realized yet, but it's interesting that this time, unlike Kinect, which was developed
8344840	8349140	for games and then kind of became this thing that really wasn't games, it's interesting
8349140	8352320	that HoloLens is taking this approach where it's like, okay, we're kind of like the other
8352320	8358400	stuff and maybe games will happen, which is kind of what personal computing was always
8358400	8359480	about, right?
8359480	8362200	Were personal computers made for gaming?
8362200	8367880	No, but it was a very, you know, things like word processing and spreadsheets and those
8367880	8371680	sorts of things, right, were some of the early things in computing, and it's like, oh, but
8371680	8374760	it plays games too, that's even better, you know, and I think maybe that's maybe the
8374760	8377680	approach Microsoft's taking with HoloLens, but anyway, I don't want to digress too much
8377680	8381160	from the topic, which is about the Department of Defense using it.
8381160	8386120	I think being able to have these like glasses that, you know, would show you basically like
8386120	8391000	a HUD, you know, I don't know what they're doing for defense, so maybe my brain just
8391000	8393280	goes to what do I see when I play Call of Duty?
8393280	8397880	I might see a radar, you know, that shows me a map of this terrain I'm in or something
8397880	8401960	like that, which could be like, you know, imagine like if they're, you know, my brain
8401960	8404960	can't help but go to here, I'm sorry if it's inappropriate, but I think about the stories
8404960	8408840	I hear about the raid when they went to go get Osama bin Laden and all that, right?
8408840	8410400	You hear those stories about that, right?
8410400	8416560	Imagine if like the layout of that house had been something that was like in, like on their
8416560	8418600	vision and stuff, you know what I mean?
8418600	8419600	Yeah.
8419600	8423920	Yeah, and you know, that would be so like interesting and how that would have like changed
8423920	8428200	it and maybe helped them and so forth and further with what they were doing.
8428200	8433240	I think it's fascinating, but I also understand why some people don't want to be involved
8433240	8437600	in making, because if it's used for defense, hypothetically in the wrong hands, it could
8437600	8439160	be used for offense, right?
8439160	8443000	And I understand why some people want to wash their hands of that.
8443000	8447760	But isn't AR in general kind of like a growing thing anyway?
8447760	8448760	Yeah.
8448760	8453160	So if not Microsoft, we know Google Glass was a thing not that long ago.
8453160	8455860	Yes, they have Magic Leap also doing stuff, right?
8455860	8458700	So if not Microsoft, won't somebody else?
8458700	8459700	Someone is.
8459700	8460700	Yeah.
8460700	8461700	So I don't know.
8461700	8465660	I mean, like I would just think, whereas I don't want to diminish the concerns and heck,
8465660	8468740	if anybody wants to come on the show and like talk about it from this perspective, I would
8468740	8469740	so invite that.
8469740	8471100	It would be awesome.
8471100	8476420	But at the same time, I'm just kind of like, at least if you're the one kind of developing
8476420	8481740	it, you can kind of help make sure it's a good guys emphasize thing that it's going
8481740	8486320	to be something the good guys use and not something used for attack or aggression or
8486320	8487820	so forth.
8487820	8496100	Anyway, going to chat over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network, Tigerclaw says, so they want
8496100	8499980	to use the HoloLens as a way for soldiers to be able to see information during combat,
8499980	8503080	kind of like what you see on those futuristic FPS games where the helmet they wear shows
8503080	8504240	the info on the screen.
8504240	8505620	We don't know, Tigerclaw.
8505620	8507060	We kind of have to make it up.
8507060	8511940	And when your brain kind of doesn't know things, you fill in the gaps with your perceptions.
8511940	8516300	And for us as gamers, our perceptions is these video games like Call of Duty and these other
8516300	8517300	games we play.
8517300	8521220	So that's so we don't really know, because, well, I like to know what I like.
8521220	8525540	The picture that they show was that Trimble has a version of the HoloLens 2 that's built
8525540	8529900	into a hard hat because they're using it for like construction and engineering and that
8529900	8530900	type of stuff.
8530900	8531900	Well, that's pretty awesome.
8531900	8532900	Yeah.
8533180	8534180	And then let's see.
8534180	8539500	Bobby Black Wolf says HoloLens 2 uses the next Gen Connect, Azure Connect, which I'm
8539500	8541260	guessing is cloud supported connect.
8541260	8543740	Nobody knows how they're actually using HoloLens 2.
8543740	8548020	And then S2100 Matt says, remember when Iraq bought thousands of PlayStation 2s to try
8548020	8550100	to power their missile guidance system?
8550100	8553180	Not sure if that actually happened or not, but I remember it was talked about.
8553180	8556880	I remember something about our military using PlayStation 3s because they were affected
8556880	8558420	by the other OS removal.
8558420	8561780	Well, they weren't because those systems definitely didn't connect to the internet because they
8562020	8566940	But like they were super computers at a very low price.
8566940	8569460	That was part of what made those PlayStation 3s.
8569460	8570460	Yeah, because of the cell processor.
8570460	8571460	Exactly.
8571460	8573500	So that's what made that whole thing attractive.
8573500	8580780	So yeah, military has and we've heard that games like America's Army and stuff have been
8580780	8583880	used to recruit for the military and so forth.
8583880	8584880	So if you think there's no...
8584880	8586300	That's a game we haven't seen in a long time.
8586300	8588860	I'm surprised they haven't tried to put out a new America's Army game.
8588860	8589860	Who knows?
8589860	8593180	But anyway, if you think there isn't crossover with gaming when it comes to some things like
8593180	8594180	this, just wait.
8594180	8599180	And again, maybe now there's a little bit of pushback on what's ethically appropriate,
8599180	8602120	I suppose, or what have you for the development of these things.
8602120	8607220	But again, like they're saying, they're putting HoloLens in a hard hat.
8607220	8612660	Maybe today that's prohibitively expensive for people to have everywhere.
8612660	8615820	But again, where are we going to be in 10 years?
8615820	8619500	And then the other thing I was going to mention along with the HoloLens stuff, there is some
8619540	8623900	other news around that, being that Epic Games has announced that they're adding HoloLens
8623900	8627060	support to Unreal Engine 4.
8627060	8633140	That they're saying that it'll allow people to use that to build games and 3D productivity
8633140	8634500	apps.
8634500	8639620	There's no games for it right now, but it's something that's going to be supported.
8639620	8642620	So you could build something if you'd like.
8642620	8645780	And maybe that's a better approach for something like this to take, is instead of launching
8645780	8651540	it as a gaming thing, launch it as a productivity, a life thing, that the gaming is, oh, then
8651540	8652980	the gaming just kind of builds on top of that.
8652980	8657380	Well, a lot of people use Unreal Engine 4 as well for building architecture.
8657380	8662220	So along with that whole thing we saw for Trimble, where they'd basically be using it
8662220	8666540	at the job site to kind of visualize a 3D model or something like that.
8666540	8670660	You have a building or something you're designing, I mean, I could see that kind of all tying
8670660	8671660	together.
8671660	8674420	All right, well, let's go to another type of AR.
8674420	8676740	It's very different, but it's still AR.
8676740	8680620	It's just a little, it's not quite the same type of technology.
8680620	8683060	It's a little bit more scaled back, and that's Pokemon Go.
8683060	8685240	I tried using the photo app.
8685240	8689140	Which the photo app is, which they call AR mode, is even more augmented reality.
8689140	8693640	But the fact that Pokemon Go makes you go to places in the real world to catch Pokemon,
8693640	8694640	that is AR.
8694640	8695640	Yeah.
8695640	8702800	And then when you take a picture with your phone, that's kind of, I don't know, maybe
8702800	8707160	Bobby's going to correct me on this, I don't know, but the Pokemon Go picture AR mode,
8707160	8711300	that's a good way to know what HoloLens does.
8711300	8715560	Because you're still seeing the world the way you would see it, it's just now you see
8715560	8719240	cute little Pokemon on your screen that you're trying to throw the ball at and catch.
8719240	8721140	Now imagine that right up against your face.
8721140	8724040	That's what HoloLens is, basically.
8724040	8725040	Except it's small.
8725040	8726040	Well, yeah.
8726040	8727040	But you know what I mean.
8727040	8728040	You know what I'm getting at, right?
8728040	8729040	Yeah.
8729040	8730040	I know what you're getting at.
8730400	8734200	But Pokemon Go is doing a new feature that some people have been asking for for a long
8734200	8737480	time and it is the ability to change your team.
8737480	8741520	So if you are on the yellow team and you're sick of your gyms already getting taken, you
8741520	8742980	can now switch to red or blue.
8742980	8747680	Or I don't want the Instinct players to hate me because the reality is now maybe some people,
8747680	8748680	that will be the appeal for them.
8748680	8751160	They're going to want to go to the less popular team.
8751160	8756300	I got to admit, I'm given thought about going to yellow team just for the challenge and
8756300	8758740	for the fun of being on the underdogs.
8758740	8759740	Why not?
8759740	8761940	Because there's an Ingress right now in this area, so why not do the same thing?
8761940	8762940	What's the matter?
8762940	8764940	There's no point to the teams yet anyways.
8764940	8765940	Like maybe if you gave...
8765940	8766940	The coins.
8766940	8767940	The gyms.
8767940	8768940	That's it.
8768940	8769940	Yeah.
8769940	8773220	Maybe you just gave me a purpose of there's some point to the actual teams other than
8773220	8775900	collecting coins, which I have quite a few.
8775900	8776900	Here's how to do it.
8776900	8777900	Here's how to do it.
8777900	8781900	So as of next week, February 26 specifically, at 1 p.m. they were going to enable a new
8781900	8784500	item in the shop, a team medallion.
8784500	8789160	It's going to set you back 1,000 Pokecoins, which conveniently you could buy with real
8789200	8792120	world money, which I think is about, it's about 10 bucks.
8792120	8796240	Well, no, because you get like more Pokecoins the more you spend, but about, we'll say about
8796240	8802760	10 bucks, discounts if you spend more, or you can earn up to 50 coins a day playing
8802760	8803760	the gym game.
8803760	8806600	Well, yeah, per Pokemon you drop.
8806600	8808260	But you're capped out at 50 a day.
8808260	8810940	You don't get any more than 50 a day, no matter what.
8810940	8813200	If you've earned more, this just happened to me yesterday.
8813200	8817520	I got a Pokemon that came back, I got my coins, then when Snorlax or whatever I had at a third
8817520	8823280	gym came back and said, Snorlax is back from a hard battle, 50 or maximum daily limit already
8823280	8824280	reached.
8824280	8825280	So you don't get any more coins.
8825280	8826280	So 50 is the most you can get.
8826280	8829160	So you do that for 20 days, you'd have a thousand coins.
8829160	8834420	But anyway, so, but I mean, they got to pay the server bills and all that stuff somehow.
8834420	8837600	So I imagine a lot of people are going to pay for it if they want to switch teams.
8837600	8840760	I bet there's a lot of people that don't care and are going to just stay where they're at.
8840760	8842320	There is one restriction.
8842320	8847840	You can only use this once every 365 days.
8847840	8853560	So I'm not sure exactly why they're doing that as a means to prevent some type of like
8853560	8855820	maybe trolling or griefing or what have you.
8855820	8859660	But they're also saying that if you have any Pokemon in gyms when you switch teams, they
8859660	8862480	are returned with no Pokecoins earned.
8862480	8864960	You cannot battle your own Pokemon.
8864960	8868920	If you return to a gym that one of your Pokemon is defending, your Pokemon is coming back
8868920	8872440	to you with no Pokecoins earned.
8872440	8874440	So interesting.
8874440	8879120	Finally that feature many people have been asking for.
8879120	8880120	Let's see.
8880120	8881120	Interesting.
8881120	8884500	Shane is in chat saying, we could have done more clam pearl research if we were Instinct
8884500	8886040	or Valor this weekend.
8886040	8889320	All the gyms were blue and people were defending for some reason.
8889320	8892000	And we ran into a lot of battle in a gym quest.
8892000	8894760	Well, the good news, I mean, I was in a different part of town.
8894760	8896120	I went to a place I don't usually go to.
8896120	8899960	I went to old downtown Roseville, which I know has a lot of stops.
8899960	8902560	And the reason why I went there, I knew they had a lot of portals in Ingress, so I knew
8902560	8906440	they have a lot of stops and it's not far from where my dad lives.
8906440	8909280	And I had family engagements that same day that was limiting my time.
8909280	8914840	So we went down there and luckily there was a pretty even amount because what happened,
8914840	8918600	the worst thing that happened to me is that I was fighting a red gym to do one of my like
8918600	8919900	battle in a gym things.
8919900	8923520	And right as I took it out, I was like, oh, I'll deploy in this gym since I just took
8923520	8924560	it anyway.
8924560	8928600	And as I tried to deploy a yellow player beat me to it who had been fighting the red player
8928600	8930560	at the exact same time.
8930560	8932920	And I was like, eh, whatever, no big deal.
8932920	8938440	So but yeah, if everybody had been blue up and down the street, then it would have been
8938440	8939840	more difficult to finish things.
8939840	8940840	Yeah.
8940840	8944000	But here's where, you know, you could consider changing your teams so that that won't happen
8944000	8945060	in the future.
8945060	8948880	So anyway, and yeah.
8948880	8950520	You know, do your teams really matter?
8950520	8954840	Because as she, when her mat and chat says, I'm on team red and my girlfriend's on blue,
8954840	8958680	we haven't broken up yet in all seriousness, it works out great being on opposite teams.
8958680	8962760	You know, a lot of people that run with multiple accounts don't pick the same team on their
8962760	8964200	multiple accounts.
8964200	8967720	Not that I'm endorsing that, but the reality is we know a lot of people are doing that
8967720	8971680	and they will pick the other color to knock their own Pokemon out of gyms, which is what
8971680	8972980	Niantic doesn't want you to do.
8972980	8973980	But I don't know.
8973980	8977600	Do you think Niantic will ever take steps against multi-accounters and Pokemon go?
8977600	8978600	I don't think it's going down.
8978680	8979680	No.
8979680	8982680	Probably as long as people are spending money, they probably don't give a hoot.
8982680	8984680	I don't think they will.
8984680	8985680	Yeah.
8985680	8986680	All right.
8986680	8988520	Anyhow, we've got a few more stories for you guys before we get to Discord.
8988520	8993840	But if you want to call in, you might want to make your way over to our Discord at vognetwork.com
8993840	8998040	slash Discord and set up in the green room and tell us a little bit about what you want
8998040	9000560	to talk about tonight in the Orange Launch Radio channel.
9000560	9002560	And we will get to those calls in just a little bit.
9002560	9004520	But first, we have this story.
9004640	9009480	Yes, how nice of Bethesda to lay out a roadmap of how they're going to fix Fallout 76.
9009480	9014200	Because, you know, this is all going to be a huge shit show anyways once we finally get
9014200	9015200	there.
9015200	9017600	But it's nice to at least see it laid out.
9017600	9022080	So what they're going to do for 2019, they've got three different segments.
9022080	9025640	So Wild Appalachia, Nuclear Winter, and Wastelanders.
9025640	9030760	So Wild Appalachia, they're going to have all new quests, game modes, features, and
9030760	9037320	more, including they've added Survival, there's going to be the new game mode, Nuclear Winter
9037320	9045120	with Nuclear Winter, the Vault 94, which is a high level Vault Raids, and additional new
9045120	9046120	features.
9046120	9052400	Wastelanders is going to add a new main quest, new events, and additional new features.
9052400	9057000	But I can't help but think they're going to fuck this up somehow because at the same time,
9057000	9061360	like just this week, they banned a player.
9061360	9063760	Is it just me or is this too fucking late?
9063760	9064800	It's too fucking late.
9064800	9070040	Like that's, I mean, that's great that they have a plan to fix it and so forth, but isn't
9070040	9072400	it too fucking late?
9072400	9080880	Or has No Man's Sky and the relative success of its own turnaround shown game companies
9080880	9083760	that maybe it's never too fucking late?
9083760	9086720	No, I think it's too late.
9086760	9091480	I think it's too late because I think people are just fed up with how the game plays.
9091480	9094920	But just also it's the constant stream of fuck-ups that they're doing.
9094920	9099980	You know, No Man's Sky was just kind of bad from the beginning, but like they were doing
9099980	9101480	updates as it went along.
9101480	9105520	It just wasn't like they were fucking up every single time that they tried to do something.
9105520	9111000	So like, for example, this week they had banned a player who had, they said he had too much
9111000	9118120	ammunition on him because he had played over like 300 some hours and he has a couple characters
9118120	9121740	that he swaps weapons back and forth to try to figure out which weapons he wants to run
9121740	9123680	with or main with.
9123680	9130200	And I think that he came to the conclusion that they seem to track the ammo that you
9130200	9133940	pick up, but not necessarily the ammo that you drop or trade.
9133940	9138820	And so because their system calculated it incorrectly, it made it seem like he had like
9138820	9141420	an excessive amount of ammo on him.
9141420	9145540	And so, of course, you know, a player that is dedicated to the game that's played over,
9145540	9150860	you know, several hundred hours into the game, let's ban him because that's that's appropriate
9150860	9154600	for one of the people who actually enjoys your game.
9154600	9156500	So there's that.
9156500	9163300	And then speaking of another game that's not getting such great success, but also is got
9163300	9168260	their roadmap in there, Anthem, for example, is talking about what they're going to be
9168260	9169860	doing going forward.
9169860	9175380	So they've got kind of a roadmap of reoccurring updates, fixes, improvements and optimizations.
9175380	9178240	Weekly Alliance, the case of Anthem, like it just came out.
9178240	9182380	So it doesn't feel like it's too late, whereas like Fallout kind of already passed the holiday
9182380	9183380	period.
9183380	9184380	Right.
9184380	9186580	But I can't help but look at this and go.
9186580	9193540	All those issues I had with Mass Effect Andromeda, where the product was not released the way
9193540	9196860	it was truly envisioned in many ways.
9196860	9201140	It's like, here we go again in the same thing.
9201140	9202140	And here's the thing, too.
9202140	9206220	Like it for me, it feels like especially when it's like a game that, you know, you're in
9206220	9210980	a they want you to spend a lot of time and stuff, maybe not so much without a monthly
9210980	9216540	fee and things, but almost would want to wait until it drops in price even more.
9216540	9220480	And they have all these updates done so that it's a little bit more polished.
9220480	9225380	But even by then, there'll be another thing that comes out that's more popular, that people
9225380	9226940	are just not going to want to waste their time on.
9226940	9230060	Apex Legends, the free game, will get that same content.
9230060	9231060	Yeah.
9231060	9237860	Why should I spend money on a game like Fallout 76 when, for example, right now they're teasing
9237860	9241300	on Amazon, there's a Fallout announcement that's going to be made.
9241300	9245940	It's most likely going to be probably a remaster of 3 or New Vegas.
9245940	9252180	Why the fuck am I going to put drop money in Fallout 76 when I can play a better game?
9252180	9253180	And I don't know.
9253180	9256980	I just I don't know why I would want to play Fallout 76.
9256980	9257980	Let's see.
9257980	9262780	Going to our chat, Quest Buster says the patches with Fallout 76 have been an unending clown
9262780	9264220	car of missteps.
9264220	9265220	It's insane.
9265220	9267500	Sounds like we need the yackety stacks here.
9267500	9272460	The last patch wanted 38 gigs of space, but was only four or five in actual size.
9272460	9277300	As John says, if there was a game that ever needed a total reboot like Realm Reborn, it
9277300	9278300	was Fallout 76.
9278300	9281780	Well, but at the same time, something on Final Fantasy also kind of lives.
9281780	9286260	Well, Final Fantasy 14 specifically makes its bread and butter off those monthly fees.
9286260	9287260	Right.
9287260	9288900	You know, and a reason to keep paying every month.
9288900	9293540	I mean, thank God Bethesda didn't try to charge a monthly fee for this game.
9293540	9296260	Yeah, it's good for that.
9296260	9297260	Yeah.
9297260	9298260	So, I mean, we'll see.
9298260	9301660	Anthem, on the other hand, is kind of a different case because it is still kind of newer.
9301660	9305660	And although it does seem like it's not going to hit that.
9305660	9306660	I mean, I don't know.
9306660	9307660	We haven't seen the sales figure.
9308020	9309020	I just don't know.
9309020	9311420	I just know EA set some big expectations for it.
9311420	9312420	When they first showed it off.
9312420	9315300	I feel like some people are into it, but not six million.
9315300	9319420	Just like when they first showed off, it looked cool and then just like my interest just went
9319420	9320420	downhill from there.
9320420	9325860	It just was kind of like, eh, because it's EA and it's like EA just fucks everything
9325860	9329980	up with the way their monetization and just everything in this.
9329980	9334460	It seems like this is almost like a cookie cutter type game that they just shoving in
9334460	9338740	monetization in and just tons of grind in the game.
9338740	9343300	I just, for me, I just knew this was going to happen again.
9343300	9344700	Like I knew this was going to happen again.
9344700	9349860	And I said this way back when we were first talking about why I was irritated with the
9349860	9353180	quarry and arc stuff getting canceled to Mass Effect and all this other stuff and turning
9353180	9356140	to this hot new thing that's going to save it as I'm like, it's not going to save anything
9356140	9360340	if EA repeats the same mistakes, you know, in this whole thing.
9360340	9365820	You know, and I'm I there's a part of me that feels like maybe I owe it to my bio or fandom
9365820	9366820	or something to try it.
9366820	9368180	But at the same time, no, you don't.
9368180	9369180	Exactly.
9369180	9370180	Exactly.
9370180	9371180	No, I don't.
9371180	9375340	Because the other games out there, because it is that argument that we owe it to a company,
9375340	9378500	the purchase or stuff, whether it's good or not, will they owe it to us to make a good
9378500	9379500	game then?
9379500	9382060	Like, you know, you come up.
9382060	9383060	It's a business.
9383060	9387060	I would want to use the word complete complete game.
9387060	9390140	Yes, I think a lot of games, a big difference.
9390140	9395300	And I think a lot of games that come out nowadays are not complete products that they just kind
9395300	9401140	of do this early access crap where it's not even labeled as early access is just, oh,
9401140	9402140	it's incomplete.
9402140	9405860	Like even like Battlefield Five had that problem where it came out and there's modes on the
9405860	9408400	menu that aren't even accessible yet.
9408400	9412180	But isn't it interesting we have that story on Dreams just a little bit ago earlier in
9412180	9418780	the show that that now is setting the stage, setting the expectations at that level of
9418780	9423020	we're going to charge you thirty dollars for the half done game and tell you up front
9423020	9425220	this is the half done game.
9425220	9426220	And right.
9426220	9431180	And you know, how would how would you felt about Fallout 76 if they had taken that approach?
9431180	9434340	Because I'll tell you how I would have felt about Anthem a lot different.
9434340	9437840	I would have felt a little bit better about it because they would if at least I would
9437840	9440880	my expectations would be lower.
9440880	9447820	Also the price point being much lower be something, you know, to look forward to as well.
9447860	9452860	The media molecule, though, I have more faith in as far as the games that they produce and
9452860	9454340	the quality of their products.
9454340	9458440	So I know what I'm getting into with that.
9458440	9459440	So I don't know.
9459440	9464620	I'm just not really and just what I've seen so far Dreams.
9464620	9470640	It's more an interesting concept versus Fallout 76, which is just basically follow for remove
9470640	9473460	all the NPCs and try to shoehorn it into an MMO.
9473460	9475060	And that just doesn't fucking work.
9475060	9476060	All right.
9476300	9477860	Well, let's move on because I want to make sure we have time.
9477860	9480700	It's almost nine o'clock and I want to make sure we have time to hear from our listeners
9480700	9481700	a little bit.
9481700	9485500	So let me quickly address this story, which is about the PlayStation Vita.
9485500	9486620	And you already knew this.
9486620	9489860	The days are winding down for the PlayStation Vita.
9489860	9496700	We're almost at the end because the official website for Sony Japan does say that only
9496700	9500820	two remaining models, black and aqua blue, that's all that's left.
9500820	9504340	And they will no longer be shipped in the coming days.
9504340	9509860	So if you want a Vita for collector's purposes or that type of thing, you might want to grab
9509860	9517060	one because pretty soon the Vita is going to be officially no more because Sony is ending
9517060	9518340	production on them.
9518340	9524260	So pour one out for the Vita and I'm sure maybe we'll do another retrospective on that
9524260	9525260	a little later.
9525260	9526260	I don't know.
9526260	9530980	Bobby Blackwell pointing out the cause her I CEO Twitter account was gold this week over
9530980	9531980	this.
9531980	9532980	I missed that account.
9532980	9536980	We came back just for this landmark event because, you know, that parody account kind
9536980	9537980	of retired.
9537980	9538980	Yeah.
9538980	9542980	But I think it comes back for these big, you know, announcements and so forth.
9542980	9545860	Anyway, we invite you to participate with our show.
9545860	9548620	We use discord to do it.
9548620	9552620	Something we're going to be kind of actually like like kind of like an idea or whatever
9552620	9557220	that I want to change in the coming weeks, I guess maybe like a thing for the show.
9557220	9559780	I know with this point, we usually take phone calls.
9559780	9560780	We're going to continue to do that.
9560780	9561940	It's not changing.
9561940	9566700	But I have noticed that, like, we get a lot of the how do I word this is I don't make
9566700	9570060	it sound like I'm upset by this or anything, but we get a lot of the same people to call
9570060	9571060	in every year.
9571060	9572060	A lot of new callers.
9572060	9573060	What's that?
9573060	9574060	We don't get a lot.
9574060	9575060	We don't get a lot of new callers.
9575060	9576060	And that's not bad.
9576060	9577060	Like, don't be wrong.
9577060	9578060	I love the people that we talk to every week.
9578060	9580140	We wouldn't do this segment anymore if I got sick of it.
9580140	9584380	But I'm thinking, like, why aren't we getting more new people in here?
9584380	9587900	And then I kind of I was kind of thinking I verbalized some of this on Twitter earlier
9587900	9591300	and then I kind of got to thinking about, you know, there's a lot of people in this
9591300	9595900	day and age that, like, don't like to do customer service and talk on the phone.
9595900	9599300	There's a lot of people that, like, they don't want to be called on the phone and talk that
9599300	9600300	way.
9600300	9601300	They want to text.
9601300	9604260	They want to text message or they want to do live Internet chat support or so forth.
9604260	9610780	And maybe the reality is, like, for, you know, a show like this, a call in radio show is
9610780	9614460	I don't necessarily say a dying format, but maybe a more and more niche format than I
9614460	9615780	want to admit.
9615780	9620260	So I think what you can see in the coming weeks is I want to invite, like, more varying
9620260	9624500	types of participation in the segment so that we do get more diverse people.
9624500	9625660	Because I completely get it.
9625660	9631500	Like, just like I don't owe Bioware my purchase of Anthem, you don't owe this show a phone
9631500	9633220	call just because you listen.
9633220	9637060	Y'all know you're always welcome as long as you're going to be a decent, nice person.
9637060	9640260	Don't call this show just to be a dick, but I don't think anybody out there is going to
9640260	9641260	do that.
9641260	9642860	But I think we should also invite other ways.
9642860	9647700	So we'll be inviting questions from chat and discussion topics from chat.
9647700	9650020	So if you guys have any questions, fill in the time.
9650020	9651140	Great thing to do that.
9651140	9653440	And I'm going to bring back tweets.
9653440	9658340	So the tweets that come in to us every week at Twitter dot com slash O.L.R., we will use
9658340	9659940	in this segment.
9659940	9662820	So that way I'm not always looking at Loki going, well, the phone's dead.
9662820	9663820	Any last minute stories?
9663820	9665020	We got anything?
9665020	9670180	So we're going to, you know, in the spirit of that, we always have talked about this
9670180	9671180	before.
9671180	9676500	This show is kind of born of that roundtable discussion at a diner after we were at, you
9676500	9680900	know, the arcade playing DDR and then we go back to the diner and talk some shit about
9680900	9681900	games.
9681900	9686060	I kind of want to just invite everybody to the table in whatever way they feel comfortable
9686060	9687060	doing so.
9687060	9689860	So if that's through phone calls, cool.
9689860	9693060	But if that's through just like one off, like this isn't worth a phone call, but I want
9693060	9695380	to know your opinion on that, then cool.
9695380	9699140	We can do that, too, as long as it's like somewhat gaming related or at least geek related,
9699140	9703220	at least geek related, because obviously tonight we I would expect to ask your questions, right?
9703220	9704660	That's fine.
9704660	9705940	And then, of course, tweets as well.
9705940	9708220	So come on back to Twitter at OLR.
9708220	9710860	We will read your tweets throughout the week.
9710860	9717140	So anyway, let's see.
9717140	9722500	I think they're talking in chat about the whole Skype versus Discord thing as well.
9722500	9725700	This is something that would have come up even if we hadn't changed platforms.
9725700	9731140	But the reality is Skype technologically was preventing me from doing what we're doing
9731140	9732140	here on Twitch.
9732140	9733140	So I changed.
9733140	9734140	Done.
9734140	9735140	All right.
9735340	9736340	Let's move on.
9736340	9739900	We have a couple of folks in the green room waiting to talk to us.
9739900	9740900	So let's get to it.
9740900	9741900	Let's get to some of these calls tonight.
9741900	9742900	Hi.
9742900	9743900	You're on Orange Launch Radio.
9743900	9744900	Who's this?
9744900	9745900	Hey, this is Akdeft.
9745900	9746900	Hey, Akdeft.
9746900	9747900	What's on your mind tonight, buddy?
9747900	9751460	Well, I want to talk about Pokemon Go.
9751460	9754140	Everybody's favorite casual, filthy game.
9754140	9756840	What's on your mind about Pokemon Go?
9756840	9757840	Everyone's favorite dead game.
9757840	9758840	Yes.
9758840	9764540	Everyone's favorite dead game that's that's still somehow on the top grossing iTunes charts.
9764940	9771580	But anyways, I'm pretty sure you already talked about the Clamperl event, but I want to talk
9771580	9775280	about my personal opinions on it.
9775280	9782460	And if you remember, I called about the Phoebus event and how a disaster that was.
9782460	9788260	Yeah, it was pretty shitty, but I thought this Clamperl one, they improved so much.
9788260	9789260	What did you think?
9789260	9793740	Yeah, it was way, like way better.
9793940	9799220	It was gigantic, learned from all the mistakes they made on the Phoebus event, and they made
9799220	9804780	this event way, way more accessible for everyone to do.
9804780	9809380	It's almost like once in a while they actually listen to feedback, and it's pretty astounding
9809380	9811420	when gaming companies do that.
9811420	9819860	Yeah, it was surprising for me because even the shiny rate for this, it was like really
9819860	9820860	insane.
9821060	9827300	Myself, I got like six shiny Clamperl on the first hour.
9827300	9831460	Lucky you, because we went for like about an hour and a half, two hours.
9831460	9834860	I got two shiny Clamperls and so did Alan.
9834860	9843500	Yeah, and at the end I got like 10 other people that probably played like, again like you,
9843500	9849300	an hour and a half or maybe less, got at least one or even up to three.
9849300	9857020	So it was a good event, and again, all the special research they made for this were like
9857020	9861860	not that difficult because if you remember with the Phoebus event, they were like, oh,
9861860	9867800	make 10 nice throws or 15 great throws or do something like really, really insane that
9867800	9870180	takes a lot of time.
9870180	9876860	And with this event, oh, you have to capture one Psyduck or one Krabby or you have to do
9876860	9879460	like only one or two or up.
9879460	9886060	I think the most great throws or nice throws was like three or five, I can remember.
9886060	9887740	I'll tell you exactly what it was.
9887740	9895220	It was three nice curve balls in a row because that was the one I kept fucking up and I got
9895220	9897260	really frustrated.
9897260	9900860	So yeah, it was three nights, but I mean, it's reasonable.
9900860	9906100	It was frustrating, but like trying to get past a difficult level in a platformer and
9906100	9911080	eventually you do it frustrating, not like I'm going to throw my phone into the ocean
9911080	9912080	frustrating.
9912080	9913080	Yeah.
9913080	9914080	Yeah.
9914080	9919680	Some were like kind of not difficult, but time consuming because yeah, they were the
9919680	9923500	ones like battling a gym or do a raid even.
9923500	9929500	But even those, they were not like really, really hard to do because you just like have
9929500	9936020	to find either a group or a simple like double one or two raid and maybe even a level three
9936020	9938820	one if you can do those.
9938820	9945020	But still that the event was like really great and I'm amazed they learn from their mistakes
9945020	9950540	because we both know Niantic and how they can screw up things like really bad.
9950540	9953340	They still do.
9953340	9957660	But when something good like this happens, when they have to be commended for something
9957660	9964580	like this, yeah, I really have to thank Niantic for this type of events and hopefully they
9964580	9970500	will probably add more or do more stuff like, like even with the next community day that
9970500	9976680	it's going to be like a global same time event, not necessarily everyone at the same time,
9976680	9982360	but the same time for everyone instead like different time hours or zones.
9982360	9985820	So that's also going to be like really, really great too.
9985820	9992500	I think the best event they did in Pokemon Go so far was the December community day because
9992500	9996980	it was the Encore one and the key thing about it that made it great is that it went all
9996980	10003880	weekend long, but there were still some heightened perks for a three hour window to draw people
10003880	10006900	out to play in that specific three hour window.
10006900	10011460	But if you miss that window, oh, well, you missed some XP boosts, some walking credits,
10011460	10015740	some lures, those types of things, but you'd still catch all the shinies and all the Pokemons
10015740	10018180	and the things that were like the must haves.
10018180	10021420	So I think that's the one thing is that it seems like these arbitrary times that they
10021420	10024120	pick, like they don't always work for everybody.
10024120	10028260	So Niantic really needs to think about, like, I understand they wanted, if they were to
10028260	10033260	do a community day all weekend long, they couldn't get those photo ops of people all
10033260	10035100	in one place at the same time.
10035100	10036820	That's what they're kind of trying to do.
10036820	10042540	But I think they really need to think about like, could we do like Saturday or Sunday,
10042540	10045060	pick one and that's the one you're stuck doing.
10045060	10047740	You can't do both like that type of thing.
10047940	10054380	And that technology exists within Niantic and within Pokemon Go because Pokemon Go Fest,
10054380	10058740	you had to buy a ticket to that, you had to buy Saturday or Sunday, and only once your
10058740	10063100	ticket was like redeemed in the system, could you see those Pokemon spawns in the park.
10063100	10067320	If you tried to go to the park on a day that your ticket wasn't for, you didn't see them.
10067320	10073180	So I think that would be my idea is that maybe Niantic should offer choices.
10073180	10078460	Like here's three community event times, pick one, but once you do it, you're stuck
10078460	10082260	with that time and that's the only three.
10082260	10086700	So that way the people that are like, I'm going to go out and catch 47 shinies during
10086700	10090060	the weekend, because I feel like that's what Shane would actually do if the times were
10090060	10091420	available.
10091420	10096860	It kind of lessens those power players from being able to play way more than like, you
10096860	10101460	know, the three hour period, which is a reasonable amount of time to binge Pokemon Go.
10101460	10105380	I think you should pick one and stick with it and encourage people to sync up and pick
10105380	10107260	the window that works for them.
10107260	10111020	Yeah, that would actually be like really, really great.
10111020	10114940	I think they do this for the Safari zones too.
10114940	10119660	So yeah, it's not like impossible for them to do it.
10119660	10124620	So yeah, it would actually like be nice to have like that choice.
10124620	10130820	Like if you, you can only do Sunday at a certain time or you can only do Saturday at a certain
10130820	10136980	time, that would be like a really, really great like option and you can probably like
10136980	10146620	plan with your team or with friends to, oh, we're going to do Saturday at 3 p.m. or we're
10146620	10150620	going to do Sunday at 10, I don't know.
10150620	10155940	And you can organize that way too and have like really, really great experience because
10155940	10161460	even with the system like it is now, you really have a good time.
10161460	10167660	I really enjoy this community events like they are right now, but having that option
10167660	10171060	would be like really better for everyone at all.
10171060	10172060	Yeah.
10172060	10175900	So yeah, I think these are some good ideas, but at least Niantic is kind of like, they're
10175900	10178240	not like hell bent on sticking with their old way.
10178240	10179980	They are trying some new things.
10179980	10183620	So I'll give them some credit for that, especially when it came to the Go Festival.
10183620	10187500	Like my understanding is last year, everybody I talked to who went this last year in 2018
10187500	10188660	had a great time.
10188660	10196220	People who in 2017, not so much, but it sounds like they really like implemented that feedback
10196220	10198420	and made it a stronger, better event.
10198420	10201380	I just kind of wish they did more of those type of events.
10201380	10207720	Like surely there's got to be a way for Niantic to like, no, these are the top 500 cities
10207720	10213460	in the world and have a small team of people for a couple of days, go to these 500 cities
10213460	10217780	and look like where's the, where would be a good place to like, where's a big park that's
10217780	10221500	dense with stops that we could have like an event like to really kind of draw people to
10221500	10222500	the same place.
10222500	10226060	Or could they have it like, you know, even incorporate something like how they do those
10226060	10231300	um, EX raids or whatever, where you get an invite to go to a specific park and you go
10231300	10236060	check in at the, you know, the, that would be some cool features to explore.
10236060	10240260	But anyway, I don't want to turn this into a Pokemon Go podcast, but I think, cause there's
10240260	10243440	lots of great ones already out there, but, um, I think these are great ideas and great
10243440	10246760	examples and a lot of us are still trucking along on Pokemon Go.
10246760	10248580	So all right.
10248580	10254080	And I suggest everyone just like a final word, uh, to check it out, uh, even if you don't
10254080	10260000	like play like religiously, the game has like improved a lot in the last year.
10260000	10265440	So again, I really, really suggest everyone that has played Pokemon Go and dropped it
10265440	10266880	or even hasn't tried it yet.
10266880	10268480	It's a, it's a good social game.
10268480	10271000	Like, uh, like I really, really recommend it.
10271000	10272000	All right.
10272000	10273260	That's a strong recommendation.
10273300	10275820	I'm going to let you go to try and squeeze in one more call here.
10275820	10277140	So thanks so much for the call though.
10277140	10278620	Hey, thanks for having me.
10278620	10279620	All right.
10279620	10280620	Anytime.
10280620	10281620	Take care.
10281620	10282620	All right.
10282620	10283620	Let's see if we can get to one more call here.
10283620	10284620	Hi.
10284620	10285620	You're on Orange Lawns Radio.
10285620	10286620	Who's this?
10286620	10287620	Hello.
10287620	10288620	You're on Orange Lawns Radio.
10288620	10289620	Who is it?
10289620	10290620	Oh, sorry.
10290620	10293780	I hit, I hit you on mute accidentally.
10293780	10294780	That's okay.
10294780	10295780	I know you've been waiting a little bit.
10295780	10296780	Who is it?
10296780	10298300	It's on Metal Mayhem.
10298300	10299300	Cool.
10299300	10302060	Just always, I always have to have you introduce yourself cause you never know who's listening
10302060	10303060	for the first time.
10303060	10304060	Uh, what's on your mind tonight?
10304060	10306260	I want to take your, uh, first topic here.
10306260	10310540	You mentioned in the chat because I'm a little pressed for time, but I'm curious of this
10310540	10312660	question behind your first topic here.
10312660	10325380	All right, well, has there been any game or games that you know is a total nuclear turd
10325380	10329420	for some strange reason you love it anyway?
10329420	10330940	I love this question.
10330940	10331940	Yes.
10332060	10339700	It's a game called Dance Dance Revolution and it's so good that we created a whole show
10339700	10345260	that's persisted for 16 years about it because let's be real, I don't think the game reviews
10345260	10348260	for Dance Dance Revolution were ever really that good.
10348260	10350440	Uh, but here we are.
10350440	10352500	So that's my number one answer.
10352500	10356900	But if we want to take a step back from that obvious answer, how about you, Loki, a guilty
10356900	10357900	pleasure.
10357900	10358900	I already know your answer.
10358900	10359900	God.
10359900	10360900	I already know it's Earth Defense Force.
10360900	10365220	Earth Defense Force is a guilty pleasure game where it's, you know, why or Twisted Metal.
10365220	10368820	Well, I guess people actually, I guess if we want to pick another obscure one, that's
10368820	10370700	a guilty pleasure game.
10370700	10373980	It would be Gals Panic, the arcade game.
10373980	10374980	Oh yeah.
10374980	10375980	Oh yeah.
10375980	10377820	You do like the, you sit down and play that.
10377820	10378820	Yes.
10378820	10383420	So it's the, um, I wouldn't even really call it hentai, but it's like, it's just an anime
10383420	10390060	puzzle game, but it's semi lewd anime puzzle game, I guess, but it's not really me.
10390060	10391060	It's an arcade game.
10391060	10396500	It wasn't like, you know, Miss Nude World or something like that, um, that one.
10396500	10399060	And there was the 3D one as well.
10399060	10403340	That was, I don't remember the name of it though, but there's a 3D one.
10403340	10406500	It's basically the same type of thing as well.
10406500	10411740	Um, and the name is just escaping me right now, but Gals Panic, yes.
10411740	10415500	I'm looking at my phone to see if I have any guilty pleasure phone games.
10415500	10417500	Oh, that Disney emoji blitz.
10417500	10421060	I stopped playing it finally, but I was super into that for a little bit.
10421060	10424700	So maybe like something like Tsum Tsum, cause it's like a match three game, but it's still
10424700	10426140	really adorable and fun.
10426140	10428180	And yeah, I like playing that in the arcades.
10428180	10429180	I don't know.
10429180	10432380	Like I'm also tempted to just be, be sassy and say Pokemon go.
10432380	10434340	That's the answer here.
10434340	10438100	You know, again, there's a lot of ways I think people would make that game better, but I
10438100	10439100	can't stop playing it.
10439100	10442060	And to some extent, Ingress would be an answer for that as well, I think.
10442060	10446140	Uh, but Metal Mayhem, you know, I'm going to turn the tables on you.
10446140	10450020	It's your guilty pleasure game that everybody says is crap, but you can't help but love
10450020	10451020	it anyway.
10451020	10459860	I'll go with the obvious one, two words, two.
10459860	10468700	That game is so bad, so distasteful, the game was even made, but for some strange reason,
10468700	10470260	I can't stop playing it.
10470260	10472300	Wait, one game, what game did you say?
10472300	10476860	I think, I think, am I crazy or did discord or maybe discord dropped out at just the wrong
10476860	10477860	time.
10477860	10478860	You said I have two words for you.
10478860	10479860	And then all I heard was two.
10479860	10484820	What, what's the game postal to, uh, to, Oh, okay.
10484820	10488500	So, so the word postal didn't come through, which I thought he said, I got two words for
10488500	10489500	you.
10489500	10493060	It's two, the number two, what are the words?
10493060	10494060	Okay.
10494060	10495060	Postal two.
10495060	10496060	Yes.
10496060	10497060	That game is absolute garbage.
10497060	10498060	And so is the movie, but I get it.
10498060	10499060	I get it.
10499060	10501380	People can't help it anyway.
10501380	10502380	Yeah.
10502380	10503380	Yeah.
10503380	10508140	Like I was saying, yes, that game was in bad taste.
10508140	10514180	It's a really shitty game, but I couldn't, could not put the game down.
10514180	10519300	Um, was it, was it your wife or who was it that actually liked dead or alive, extreme
10519300	10520300	beach volleyball?
10520300	10521300	No, it wasn't my wife.
10521300	10522300	She's never seen that game.
10522300	10524420	I thought there's somebody that was in melody.
10524420	10528900	Maybe somebody affiliated with a show that was like that was their guilty pleasure game
10528900	10532300	because again, those games are, they're, they're not great games.
10532300	10534220	We all know what those games are about.
10534220	10538860	Um, but, um, I, I remember there was distinctly, there was some, or goats simulator.
10538860	10539860	I like goats.
10539860	10542780	There was a girl gamer who said that that was the guilty pleasure game because it was
10542780	10543780	all the dress up and all this.
10543780	10544980	I can't remember who said that.
10544980	10546860	Maybe it was princess Irene years ago.
10546860	10548740	I think she would've said, I don't know.
10548740	10552580	Anyway, so I don't want to, but I don't want to attribute things to people that didn't
10552580	10553580	actually say them either.
10553580	10555260	So I will just leave it as I don't remember.
10555260	10557300	Um, but anyway, great question.
10557300	10559220	I, I'm curious for the chat as well.
10559220	10561660	I'll read some of the chat answers here in a minute, but a metal mayhem.
10561660	10562660	Thanks for the call.
10562660	10563660	As always.
10563660	10564660	I really appreciate it.
10564660	10565660	I have a good one.
10565660	10566660	You too.
10566660	10567660	All right.
10567660	10568660	Uh, that's going to do it for the discord calls tonight.
10568660	10570660	Um, but if you didn't get in, uh, I'm sorry.
10570660	10575580	You can always send an email or tweet participate at orange lounge, radio.com or of course you
10575580	10582340	can always tweet us at O L R. Um, K art says, wait, is postal still banned in Australia?
10582340	10583340	Pro?
10583340	10585340	I don't think games really get unbanned.
10585340	10586340	Do they?
10586340	10587340	Maybe a long time later.
10587340	10588340	Sometimes.
10588340	10589340	Yeah.
10589340	10590340	I don't.
10590340	10591900	I mean, were there any, any efforts to try to unban it?
10591900	10594020	It's probably one of those things where it's like, it's not, they're not exactly going
10594020	10597840	to haul you to jail for playing it, but they don't exactly sell it in stores.
10597840	10604580	So people are probably anyone sells postal to in the stores or no, not at this point
10604580	10605580	anymore.
10605580	10606580	Um, let's see.
10606580	10609740	Uh, Shane and chat says, I kind of want that Tsum Tsum switch game.
10609740	10610740	Not going to lie.
10610740	10611740	Me too.
10611740	10612740	Actually.
10613140	10615860	S two 100 Matt says I was on a road trip this weekend and went to a town where they use
10615860	10618320	Slack to communicate in the community.
10618320	10619320	So strange.
10619320	10620420	It must be a Pokemon go thing.
10620420	10621420	Why not?
10621420	10624340	Slack is hard because you have to invite to Slack.
10624340	10630460	We use Slack for ingress, but that's because with the whole espionage and secrecy, you
10630460	10633000	have to be in a secure environment for that stuff.
10633000	10634420	Discord isn't as good for that stuff.
10634420	10635420	Yeah.
10635420	10639060	Um, although there's been talk about use because the voice integration and discord is pretty
10639060	10640060	great.
10640380	10645220	Um, yeah, I thought most Pokemon go communities use discord plus Slack is really limited.
10645220	10646220	I don't know.
10646220	10647220	Anyway.
10647220	10648620	Um, let's see.
10648620	10652740	And also, uh, fifth dream today confirming I know three or four women who love all the
10652740	10655140	dead or alive games, including X.
10655140	10656140	Why not?
10656140	10657140	Why not?
10657140	10660060	Uh, and Miltonia's game says people don't like doom three, but I have played it many
10660060	10661060	times.
10661060	10662060	Yeah.
10662060	10663060	That was the one.
10663060	10664060	It was like, it was on the X-Box original X-Box, right?
10664060	10667060	I actually own that cause I liked the old doom games and yeah, I just remember it being
10667060	10669220	like, I played that game going, it's too dark.
10669380	10670780	I didn't see anything in this game.
10670780	10671780	Yeah.
10671780	10672780	Anyway.
10672780	10673780	All right.
10673780	10676780	That brings us about to the close of another episode of orange lounge radio.
10676780	10677780	I'm checking in.
10677780	10679380	Did you have any last minute stories?
10679380	10680380	Loki?
10680380	10681380	Yes.
10681380	10685220	I did have a quick little thing and that is that there apparently there's some indie developers,
10685220	10690980	Billy laws and max Keller have got, um, a rough version of Android Q running on the
10690980	10691980	switch.
10691980	10693500	Thanks to home brew.
10693500	10698380	So, of course, home brew is going to home brew.
10698540	10703820	So yeah, that it, how, how useful it is.
10703820	10704820	I don't know.
10704820	10707420	I still have, I have a switch mod chip.
10707420	10711700	I just never planned to use it at some point.
10711700	10716660	I could use it for something, but yeah, probably end up losing it before I end up using it.
10716660	10717660	All right.
10717660	10719220	Any other last minute stories for us tonight?
10719220	10720220	That's all I got.
10720220	10721220	All right.
10721220	10722220	I guess that's time for us to wrap up then.
10722220	10726500	So I thank you guys again, as always for tuning into another episode of orange lounge radio,
10726500	10731500	whether you were here live watching us, whether you were watching us on demand on our, the
10731500	10735540	Twitch library over at VOG network, or you were listening on our podcast feed, however
10735540	10738860	you are participating with this show, we thank you so much for spending your time with us
10738860	10739860	this week.
10739860	10743500	All we ask here at orange lounge radio, um, is please help us spread the word.
10743500	10747060	We're the show where every gamer has a voice, but, uh, you know, that we need more voices
10747060	10750740	here to get more opinions and more perspectives on things.
10750740	10754580	So please tell a friend or two about the show, um, help us spread the word that way.
10755140	10759500	Um, and a nice five star review on a site like iTunes goes a long, long way.
10759500	10761900	And this is one I need to start putting out there more often too.
10761900	10765220	You hear me say the same thing at the end of every show, but this one is really important
10765220	10766220	too.
10766220	10769900	Your hosts on Twitch are so, so good.
10769900	10775060	So if you consider, um, hosting us and putting us on your auto host list, that would be fantastic.
10775060	10777620	Um, that stuff goes a real long way.
10777620	10779460	So that please consider it.
10779460	10782300	I mean, but if you don't, we're still going to keep going with the show as long as we
10782300	10783300	got it in us.
10783300	10784780	So, uh, appreciate it anyway.
10784780	10786980	Um, I guess that's, that's it.
10786980	10789940	So I guess now we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
10789940	10791660	Um, I'll start tonight.
10791660	10796260	My final thought is even though my experiences were kind of varied, I look forward to playing
10796260	10797260	more apex legends.
10797260	10801380	I think that's going to be interesting, but I'm really looking forward to more fantasy
10801380	10802380	star online.
10802380	10806180	So stay tuned to my personal stream at Rob Roberts here on Twitch.
10806180	10810620	I'm going to be doing some more, uh, fantasy star online, and I'm sure my good pal Delvin
10810620	10814180	out there at VG realness will also be streaming as well.
10814180	10816740	And, you know, I like to give him promotion as well.
10816740	10821420	Uh, I also look forward to welcoming dark soccer back in studio full time next week.
10821420	10822420	Yes.
10822420	10824420	I was hoping to stream some this week.
10824420	10829140	I didn't get a chance to, um, because I was cooking like a lot this week.
10829140	10833580	So I, you know, get home and then I have all this time to cook and I didn't have, I only
10833580	10835680	have a finite amount of time to do things.
10835680	10838420	So, um, I don't know if I'm going to be doing it.
10838460	10841460	I know I have to cook at least one or two days this week.
10841460	10844660	Um, I do want to do some more streaming.
10844660	10846140	Maybe I'll do some more DDR.
10846140	10848740	I need to get step mania up and running at some point.
10848740	10853940	I have the PZ to do it and I've got, I don't have the theme done, but I may just forego
10853940	10857060	that and just put something together just to get it on the machine.
10857060	10859420	Um, it's all the mess around with that.
10859420	10863340	But yeah, if you guys are interested in how like my machines modded, I'm not really modded,
10863340	10865740	but I need to go and clean the pads again.
10865780	10870300	I don't know how interesting of a stream that would be, but I do need to do that at some
10870300	10871300	point.
10871300	10873540	And be sure to promote your Twitch again, cause somebody just asked.
10873540	10877300	Yes, uh, twitch.tv slash Loki O L R.
10877300	10882060	Um, unfortunately I'm not regular in my streaming stuff.
10882060	10888340	It's usually around six o'clock, um, six 30 to like seven or eight or whatever.
10888340	10891580	Um, the regular streaming thing is really hard for me too.
10891620	10896340	That's why I save all my streams so that actually that fantasy star one got a lot like, well
10896340	10900300	not like a ton of views, but like it was like probably more people watching it after the
10900300	10901300	fact that we're watching a lot.
10901300	10902300	Yeah.
10902300	10905700	I'm surprised on like some of my views on stuff, um, like anybody's interest.
10905700	10909180	I think as more and more people are getting jaded with YouTube, I think, I think a Twitch
10909180	10911580	is very smart to get into that video on demand stuff.
10911580	10912580	So good for them.
10912580	10913580	Yeah.
10913580	10914580	I don't know.
10914580	10918180	But yeah, you can always go and watch my old, um, stuff and I am, like I said, I did crack
10918180	10919180	down three the other day.
10919180	10922340	I can't really stream that again because I'm already done with the game and it's kind
10922340	10927700	of boring at that point, but, um, speed running, you didn't miss much.
10927700	10928700	Let's put it that way.
10928700	10929700	You didn't miss much.
10929700	10930700	It's pretty grindy.
10930700	10931900	We get to wrap up and get out of here.
10931900	10936100	We will be back with dark soccer in seven days, a new month in seven days.
10936100	10937100	It'll be March.
10937100	10938100	I can't believe it.
10938100	10939100	This year's flying by.
10939100	10940580	We'll be back to do it all again in seven days.
10940580	10944400	Thank you again so much for watching, uh, orange on trading and listening to orange
10944400	10945400	on trail.
