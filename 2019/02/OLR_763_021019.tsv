14000	21000	This week, alongside the surprise release of Apex Legends, the Nintendo Switch sees a surprise in Keen Dreams. Billy Blaze gets a second release on a system that can be played on the go.
21000	27000	This is just one trip down memory lane, stay tuned for all the week's gaming news starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	44000	Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back, it's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, episode number 763 for this February the 10th of 2019.
44000	48000	I am Rob Roberts, he is Techmaster Loki joining me in studio.
48000	50000	I am here, and I am the butt of the joke.
51000	59000	Oh well yes, so it doesn't go on the podcast, but the little, when we go live on Twitch we do this little like inspired by you can't do that on television thing.
59000	66000	So like we've had a couple, like so and so is not going to be seen tonight. If you ever watch you can't do that on television back in the day, they used to do that.
66000	76000	So we've had all sorts of like little like tongue and cheek gaming inventory things, like what was Mavis Beacon Teaches Murder was one of them, Maria Kondo Organizes My Warcraft Inventory, that was another one we did.
76000	91000	So tonight was Broccoli Farming Simulator 19. Also, I was kind of busy this weekend so I kind of had to pick something fast, so I was like alright I'm doing the obvious joke tonight, I'm going to burn my obvious one so I can think of a better one for next time.
91000	98000	So I was trying to rack my brain thinking of a Valentine's one, but I was busy, I didn't have time. But I'm glad you enjoyed that Loki.
98000	109000	It's just all the reason to be here live because of course if you are listening on the podcast feed we love you, we appreciate you being here because we've been an audio podcast for years and years and years, way too long, longer than I care to admit.
109000	123000	But we love all the guys that listen to us on the podcast feed. But if you want to join us live you can over on our Twitch network, it's twitch.tv slash vog network, where we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
123000	136000	And yeah, here we are live again with another episode, Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers, sadly, again not with us tonight, she is still out on a work commitment, but we will hear from her later in the show during the classic game of the week segment.
136000	139000	But for now, how are you Loki, everything going well with you?
139000	142000	I'm fine, I shoved a bunch of breadsticks in my mouth so you know.
142000	144000	Yes, powered by carbs.
144000	149000	That was all of the food I've eaten today so, all at one go.
149000	162000	Some people don't realize that we've definitely had to change some things with this whole move to Twitch, because one of them was that we would just kind of casually eat during the show, and now it's like, oh shoot, we're going to be live, we don't want to be sitting here eating on camel.
162000	166000	Oh, I wouldn't mind doing that, it's just the pizza box gets in the way of the screen, so you know.
166000	173000	Sometimes during the Bobby call, you can still catch Loki finishing up something live, yeah, it just depends on what's going on.
173000	180000	So, I saw you were streaming this week, I know you'll probably talk a little bit about it during your gaming week, but I saw you were finally doing some non-DDR stuff.
180000	181000	Yes.
181000	182000	Which I mean, DDR is cool and all, don't get me wrong.
182000	184000	I also do DDR stuff too.
184000	189000	Okay, but I caught you doing a Skyrim stream, so the thing, you were kind of teasing it on the last show.
189000	190000	Yes.
190000	191000	Is that you were going to do like a...
191000	196000	My wife was out of the house for a few days, and so I was able to actually sit down and do that.
196000	205000	I didn't get to do it the first day, because I think I had to actually set up everything, and it wasn't ready yet, and also kids needed things, and it just wasn't working out, I was exhausted.
205000	210000	So, I ended up, though, getting a good portion of time to do it.
210000	219000	And of course, you know, in typical fashion, I didn't test anything going into it at all, and so it started off horribly, which is great.
219000	227000	Testing is good, yeah. I was there at the very beginning, and I was like, he could have figured out that the intro wouldn't work with some of his mods.
227000	228000	It should have.
228000	229000	It's fine.
229000	240000	There was no reason that the horses didn't know where to go, it's just, I think it was the weird horse mod thing that like, you'd see like the guard's horse just jet off into the mountains, and you know, it was downhill from there.
240000	248000	But one of the mods I saw, and I know here we are talking about Skyrim mods, like hello, it's like 2012 all over again, but some things are forever funny.
248000	256000	Like, you had that Thomas the Tank Engine that replaced the dragon at the very beginning, so it was really funny, instead of the big roar, you'd hear this doot doot.
256000	258000	It just cracked me up, I loved it.
258000	266000	Yeah, there was a lot of weird things. There ended up being two followers I had, so Gary the Goat and Dave the Dragon.
266000	277000	And at one point somehow, because I kept playing with this one spell that was an orbital cannon, and so I aggroed Dave at one point.
277000	283000	And so he tried to kill me, so I had to kill him in order for him to calm down.
283000	298000	And then later in the stream, which not a lot of people got to see, but later in the stream there was a thing that had to do with falling barrels from the sky that all screamed that ended up going over well, because it was incredibly loud.
298000	303000	And then My Little Pony stuff, because just for the hell of it.
304000	308000	Now, you do archive all your video, right? So people could go back and watch it.
308000	309000	Yes.
309000	314000	Because for whatever reason, Twitch doesn't enable that by default. You have to tell it to save your videos so you can watch it.
314000	319000	Well, I'm pretty sure I do, and if I don't, I archive my stuff on my local PC.
319000	321000	Good, that's smart, that's smart.
321000	331000	Yeah, and I guess I should plug here, something extra we've been doing ever since we moved over to Twitch, is that we do broadcast the video live on Sunday nights, and you can be here and watch along with it.
331000	338000	You can't be here on Sunday night, and you still really want video, the audio podcast that we've been doing for years and years for free, it's just not enough for you.
338000	348000	You want to see the video on demand, all you have to do is subscribe to the VOG Network Twitch channel, which many of you with Amazon Prime, you get a free sub a month anyway, so you just use that to subscribe at the lowest level.
348000	353000	You don't have to do anything but the lowest level, and you get access to the video archive.
353000	355000	And not just us, but Bobby Black Wolf, and any special things we do.
355000	359000	And SSJ100Matt says, the Macho Man Dragon mod is still the best.
359000	373000	And that was the tough part, it's like you can only really choose one dragon mod, like if it were up to me, I would put the Macho Man dragon mod, and the Skyrim Thomas mod, and the My Little Pony mod, and whatever other stupid dragon mods they have.
373000	375000	But you can only pick one.
375000	386000	And so, instead for the Macho Man part, which unfortunately there's two chicken mods I had, so they kind of combine together.
386000	396000	So I had one mod that made chickens look like tiny little strong men guys with chicken heads, and they would make Macho Man Randy Savage comments.
396000	401000	And then I made one that apparently made chickens the size of like, they're just huge.
401000	409000	So what we got instead now in there is giant chickens that occasionally when you walk up to them will make Macho Man Randy Savage comments.
409000	414000	So it's something. Oh, and they explode, because of course they do.
414000	419000	Alright, we're going to get into our kickoff topic for the night, which I'll have you do, Logie.
419000	425000	But first off, I want to read this comment, because again, we're taping live on Twitch, and we read some comments from our chat.
425000	428000	Big Red Pimp says, the video stream is not enough.
428000	431000	I'm not sure what else we can give you, until they invent the holodeck.
431000	435000	I'm not sure what else we can give you, short of you actually sitting here in the studio.
435000	436000	Virtual reality stream.
436000	440000	To be fair, many of our listeners have come to the studio and sat in on the show.
440000	446000	I feel like years ago you might have done that actually, Big Red Pimp. I know your wife did. Early, early on. Way back in the day.
446000	454000	We should do, like, we should get the VR camera set up, like they use for those VR porn videos, and then that way we can get uncomfortably close to people and tell them the news.
455000	460000	So we'll be like, hey, hey guess what? So like there's some Nintendo stuff going on.
461000	466000	You guys, I played Apex Legends this week, and it's really rad.
467000	469000	There you go. Yeah, see like that.
470000	473000	Just get uncomfortably, like, practically sitting in there laughing.
474000	477000	God, every imperfection I just put on full blast on Twitch anyway.
477000	478000	It was perfect.
478000	479000	Eh, whatever.
480000	482000	Thank God for decent lighting.
482000	486000	Alright, anyway, let's get into our kickoff topic tonight. Speaking of Nintendo and stuff that Nintendo's doing.
486000	493000	So Nintendo, they've of course, you know, been very reluctant to sunset 3DS.
494000	496000	But apparently that might be changing.
497000	501000	The 3DS market has contracted faster than we anticipated.
501000	507000	So apparently, you know, they had thought that this was going to go on for a lot longer, but they say that continuing.
508000	512000	Right now they are still continuing to bring out new content for the 3DS.
513000	528000	But during the recent financial briefing, basically saying the owners, that many of the 3DS owners are buying it as their first game systems and basically the nice price point.
529000	534000	And then there's still room to improve with the Switch market as well.
534000	540000	Also that they are still trying to push people to buy multiple Switch units per household.
541000	546000	Although, honestly, I don't think that's really going to happen until you get the price of the system down.
547000	551000	I don't know. The house I was visiting this weekend had at least two, I think maybe three.
552000	553000	And then I brought mine.
554000	556000	So, I don't know.
557000	558000	One percent problems, I guess.
559000	561000	Shut up. I was going to say, it probably just depends on the house.
561000	562000	It depends on the house.
563000	565000	I mean, to be fair, this is a house full of gamers.
566000	567000	So, I mean, it makes sense.
568000	574000	Yeah, so basically they are saying that 2018 isn't the last year that we are going to see the 3DS.
575000	576000	It's still going to be going strong this year.
577000	578000	They are going to keep bringing out new content.
579000	586000	Try to keep it, as they put it, vibrant and going well into next year.
586000	588000	And, I don't know.
589000	594000	So, we'll kind of see maybe, I think it's probably a couple of years away from being dead.
595000	598000	But, you know, it's all about what they put out on the Switch.
599000	601000	And getting people to buy stuff, because I think honestly with the 3DS,
602000	604000	because I just bought my kids a 2DS, which is basically a 3DS.
605000	610000	And, I just can't imagine buying multiple copies of Switch games.
610000	612000	Like, that's expensive as it is.
613000	616000	Like, on the 3DS, let alone, you know, $60 games.
617000	618000	No, no thank you.
619000	620000	Well, digital distribution, too.
621000	622000	There's a lot of people that aren't just buying the $60 games.
623000	625000	Maybe buying, like, Overcooked for, like, $20.
626000	627000	You know, and things like that.
628000	630000	But, there's not a lot of games that we're having multiple Switch systems as really a benefit.
631000	632000	I get it.
633000	634000	Again, it depends on the household.
635000	638000	If you have a lot of people that are more likely to be out and on the go separately,
638000	641000	and maybe they take transit a lot or something, so they want to have something to play.
642000	643000	Like, it makes more sense in those situations.
644000	645000	But, you're right. It's probably...
646000	650000	I'm talking about a situation that probably applies to far less households than the other situation.
651000	652000	But, what I think is going on...
653000	654000	And, you know, I'm not a 3DS hater by any means.
655000	657000	I love the 3DS as a system. There's been so many great games on it.
658000	660000	But, you know, at some point, a couple years ago,
661000	664000	Nintendo kind of already walked away from the 3D part of it.
665000	666000	And, it was just, hey, here's our...
666000	668000	Here's another new DS.
669000	671000	The Pokemon games barely support 3D.
672000	674000	It's an afterthought in one mode.
675000	677000	And, they really started doing this 2DS and pushing that whole thing,
678000	681000	which is fine because Nintendo really had the portable market covered.
682000	683000	I mean, they killed their only competition, the Vita.
684000	685000	You know, congrats Nintendo.
686000	687000	I mean, they had that market cornered.
688000	689000	But, by the time they brought out the Switch, I was kind of like,
690000	694000	okay, 3DS, you can go now, bye, because we have a portable system that is capable...
694000	696000	I mean, yes, you can put it on the dock and have it on TV too.
697000	700000	But, as we all know, the whole thing is that you can pick it up and take it portable.
701000	703000	And, it's a more powerful device.
704000	706000	So, I'm kind of like, all right, you can stop putting games there.
707000	708000	Put it on the more powerful one on the Switch.
709000	710000	And, I've been saying that on the show for a long time.
711000	714000	But, you know, something that you guys have been saying,
715000	716000	and sometimes you guys here in studio is that,
717000	720000	well, Nintendo probably had the 3DS around kind of for insurance purposes.
720000	725000	Because, the Wii U didn't do so hot, right? All things considered.
726000	730000	So, the Switch, they didn't know if it was going to be successful, right?
731000	733000	Because, you don't know until it's out there.
734000	735000	You don't know how something's going to do.
736000	738000	So, maybe Nintendo in some ways kind of under...
739000	742000	Well, but it's weird, I say they under predicted the success of the Switch.
743000	744000	But, I swear, didn't we have a story just last week,
745000	749000	where Nintendo then had to like shift down their projections by like 1 million or something?
750000	753000	I almost feel like they under predicted, then they over predicted,
754000	757000	now they got to go back to this, it's like this constant need to correct something.
758000	760000	I don't know, they're not forecasting very well, but whatever.
761000	762000	But, anyway, my point is...
763000	767000	Maybe that explains all the shortages because they can't forecast their numbers correctly.
768000	771000	Maybe. But, anyway, my point is that, you know, the Switch has been successful,
772000	775000	whether it, you know, met the even more targets that Nintendo was setting, whatever.
776000	779000	But, the Switch has been successful enough where I think it's kind of killing the 3DS,
780000	783000	and there's a lot of people that are probably approaching it the way I'm approaching it,
784000	787000	where it's like, my bag is not big enough to take the Switch and the 3DS,
788000	789000	and that's a lot to get stolen.
790000	793000	So, I'm just going to take the Switch and, you know, there's nothing right now in the 3DS anyway
794000	796000	that I want to play that I didn't already play 3 or 4 years ago.
797000	800000	There's a lot of games though too, even on like, aside from maybe like Pokémon and stuff,
801000	802000	but there's a lot of games that have come out on...
803000	808000	Well, when that Pokémon game comes out on Switch, I mean, take the DS out back and shoot it, it's dead.
808000	815000	Luigi's Mansion, whoopee-doo, I know there's fans of that series, but it's not enough to keep the DS alive.
816000	820000	I would say the last real hurrah of that system, and I'm pointing this way for those on Twitch,
821000	826000	because my DS is in the other room over here, it's just like forever alone on the living room table,
827000	831000	but the Metroid game they did, the reinvention of Metroid 2 is probably the last great shout.
832000	835000	Which really, they should just port that stuff over to, you know, the Switch.
835000	836000	Agreed, I'm not gonna...
837000	843000	And maybe that will happen once they finally sunset the 3DS, and then they'll bring over all that old stuff,
844000	845000	do like a 2D Metroid collection or something like that.
846000	850000	Well, and I wonder, and you know, later in the show we're gonna get into some more Nintendo rumors and things,
851000	854000	but there are rumors about potentially new 2D games and other franchises as well,
855000	860000	and I wonder, actually Loki, I wonder if they are things that maybe were being planned for the 3DS,
860000	867000	and now Nintendo is going, maybe, even though the 3DS has a larger install base overall,
868000	871000	maybe the reality is the software is all moving on the Switch right now,
872000	874000	so we should probably aim this game over there instead.
875000	876000	Maybe.
877000	882000	And then of course they also talk a little bit about Nintendo online, so...
883000	885000	Actually, real quick, I want to get some comments, because these are some good comments.
885000	891000	Over at VOG Network, our... VOGnetwork.com is the website, and it'll take you right to twitch.tv slash vognetwork,
892000	898000	where Bobby Blackwolf says, they even stopped making P-Cross games for the 3DS, and now they're on the Switch.
899000	900000	I really preferred that game with the stylus.
901000	905000	Well, you know, if they really wanted to, they could still make it work with touch controls,
906000	910000	because the Switch is a touch screen, so that is... I mean, I realize not every Switch has a stylus,
911000	913000	so you'd have to use your finger, which isn't very accurate, and you know, make sure...
913000	916000	Well, you can still get a stylus. They could make a stylus that would work with it.
917000	922000	You can, but they are making a choice that not enough people are going to do this to make it worth the development time,
923000	925000	because I think those P-Cross games are kind of meant to be...
926000	927000	To develop a stylus that's already out on the market?
928000	930000	No, no, no. I mean, develop the control scheme in the P-Cross game.
931000	932000	Oh, fine.
933000	934000	Because you have to kind of re-approach it for the stylus or whatever.
935000	939000	Right, because they have to have it for the TV mode, too, and so that's the problem, is you have to support both modes.
940000	942000	Right. Right. And I think those games are kind of meant to be.
943000	950000	I doubt there's a very large team making those P-Cross games. They're probably meant to be low effort, low risk, medium reward.
951000	952000	What was the P-Cross out on the Game Boy originally?
953000	954000	Oh, yeah. The series been around forever.
955000	956000	Couldn't we just adapt those same controls?
957000	958000	Well, that's...
959000	961000	Are we too spoiled now with our touch screens and stuff that we can't pause?
962000	963000	What directional pad?
964000	968000	That's what they did. He's saying it's a preference to use the touch thing on the 3DS, which I admit was kind of handy,
968000	973000	because, Loki, they're all based off of, like, think like Sudoku, right?
974000	978000	It really boils down to like a pen and paper game. You know those, like, books you used to be able to buy at the grocery store?
979000	980000	You probably still can.
981000	985000	That's where those P-Cross things come from, or like those types of books, but I think Japan.
986000	989000	So it started as like a pen and pencil type thing.
990000	996000	So that's why it's like, oh, a stylus feels natural for these games because originally that's really literally what it was.
996000	998000	It was a pen to play these things. That's what it is.
999000	1000000	Right.
1000000	1006000	Okay. Anyway, other comments in chat at twitch.tv slash vog network. Let's see.
1007000	1013000	SG100Matt says, it's a hassle to take the switch on the train to work. I have, but I get unnecessary attention because of it.
1014000	1020000	That's probably a good point, too, is that you don't always want to take a very expensive little device on these public transit things,
1021000	1024000	because you get a lot of people that are kind of looking over going, what's that?
1024000	1032000	Maybe they haven't seen one before because they just don't follow tech as closely or they're not really gamers outside of, you know,
1033000	1038000	possibly like, you know, earlier systems or touch phone games.
1039000	1040000	So those things always kind of attract attention.
1041000	1047000	So then also they made a comment as well about the Switch online service, which they said, of course,
1047000	1060000	you know, they've had eight million accounts signed up, but they're finding that the trends right now is that it's actually that people are picking very short enrollment periods.
1061000	1066000	So they're signing up for maybe like a month at a time and then not continuing to keep up with the service,
1067000	1073000	which I guess that makes sense a little bit because let's be honest that, you know, the NES games that they offer there,
1073000	1079000	that's not really all that great in the online portion of it is not all that great.
1080000	1091000	I think honestly, like I've used the online for that last time we played Mario Kart 8 was probably the only time I've used Nintendo online for that.
1091000	1099000	And then the NES games, I mean, I don't really play them.
1100000	1110000	If I'm going to play NES games, I can just fire up my modded, you know, SNES classic or something like that and playing with a nice original controller.
1111000	1114000	I don't know. I've been playing the NES library a little bit here and there.
1114000	1121000	I am more fascinated by the downloading the Japanese versions and looking at those because that's really the first time I've looked at many of those.
1122000	1130000	Like I did a live stream about a month or so ago when Metroid first came out because, you know, playing Metroid on the Japanese Nintendo online,
1131000	1139000	you get the Famicom Disk System version. So you see things you haven't seen before like the save screen because Metroid has, like in the original Legend of Zelda, a save screen.
1139000	1143000	So Metroid has that in the FDS version. You've just never seen it really in America. So there's that.
1144000	1149000	And then the sound chip differences, very subtle, but we kind of, you know, I did a little playthrough on stream and it's not like going to change your life,
1150000	1154000	but it's kind of neat to go back and play it and go, huh, that's interesting. Like these very subtle differences.
1155000	1160000	And I think Zelda and Zelda 2 might have some very minor differences as well because they were originally Disk System games as well.
1161000	1164000	And I'm waiting for Kid Icarus because I think that's another one that was originally a Disk System game.
1164000	1171000	So yeah, there's a lot of those early NES games because they hadn't quite developed the battery thing yet.
1172000	1176000	They used those password things instead to get them to work. But anyway, I'm deviating a little bit.
1177000	1183000	The online system, I just watched somebody play Splatoon 2 over the weekend, so I know that's still going.
1184000	1190000	And of course along with that, since they do recognize that, you know, they said a growing percentage of subscribers are going for shorter one month memberships,
1190000	1198000	that they're going to, you know, try to make it more worthwhile, basically.
1199000	1207000	Currently we're planning on ways to boost the appeal of the service on a yearly basis and we'll announce more details as soon as they are ready.
1208000	1211000	So, yeah.
1212000	1216000	Maybe the Super Nintendo always rumored Datamined in the...
1217000	1225000	Is that really going to be enough? I mean, like, how... I don't know. It's just, it seems like we need more.
1226000	1231000	I think they need to, like, either ditch that app or make it a lot better.
1232000	1236000	They need to, like, just ditch that app because the voice chat thing is ridiculous. I don't know anybody that's using it.
1237000	1242000	Or they just need to try to, like, make it better, like, maybe where you can, like, and I thought this was supposed to be a thing of it.
1242000	1246000	Maybe it's even there and I just don't even realize it. But, like, schedule gaming sessions with friends.
1247000	1253000	Or interact more with Facebook and Twitter to see, like, what friends are playing and instantly be able to join their games and things of that sort.
1254000	1256000	I don't know. I feel like there's just other things they could do with that app.
1257000	1258000	I don't know.
1259000	1265000	Achievements and leaderboards. But, you know, last week we talked a little bit about Xbox Live is now kind of creeping in there a little bit.
1266000	1269000	So it'll be interesting to see if Microsoft maybe pushes something.
1269000	1271000	I think patching the achievements would be pretty cool.
1272000	1282000	Yeah, but again, and I've said this last week, I think it's important to say, before you get carried away with this whole Xbox Live on Nintendo thing, don't expect that Nintendo to implement it in their own games.
1283000	1292000	That's not what Xbox Live on Switch is going to do. It's not going to work with Mario and Zelda. I mean, that would be a monumental deal if that happens. I really don't think it's going to.
1292000	1301000	It's more for the indie things. The Minecrafts of the world, obviously, and then other indie developers that want to enable that sort of thing on their indie games.
1302000	1305000	But you're not going to see it in Mario, Zelda, Metroid. Ain't happening.
1306000	1311000	Nintendo is going to try to convince you, whether it's true or not, that their system is better.
1311000	1322000	And that's what they're tasked with and facing their investors with is even the investors are kind of calling them out that your online system isn't what the others are offering.
1323000	1326000	Step it up. Basically what I'm hearing in this question.
1326000	1340000	Yeah. All right. Going to our Twitch chat. Bobby says, well, I mean, what more do you want? Like, define more. Playing games online isn't enough and Netflix with online play isn't enough.
1341000	1353000	Fair question. I think you'd have to look at what some of the competition is doing. Where has the bar been set with things like PlayStation Plus and Xbox Live Gold?
1353000	1360000	Where has the bar been set that Nintendo, even though they're coming into this game later, where are they not meeting the bar?
1361000	1370000	Not really doing it with discounts. I know they have their whole coins thing, but that's, is that really a part of the online? I don't think you have to pay to be in the coins.
1371000	1374000	So that's not really a part of it. So they're not really doing discounts in that regard.
1375000	1376000	That is nice.
1376000	1385000	It's nice. Yeah, sure. The coins thing is nice. I don't know. I kind of think it's an after. It doesn't really save you that much money. I mean, it's like...
1386000	1387000	It's like 10% or...
1388000	1390000	You have to get a lot of coins for that. You don't get that much. It depends if you buy it digitally.
1391000	1393000	No, it's 10%. Whatever you buy, you get 10% back in coins.
1394000	1396000	If you buy it digitally. I don't think you get as much if you buy it.
1397000	1398000	Oh, I don't know. I buy most things digitally.
1399000	1406000	But anyway, whatever. But anyway, so, but I would say it's, it's the, it's a lot of the voice chat is what it's really coming down to.
1407000	1412000	And the fact that, you know, in the PlayStation environment, you can hop on there with, you know, party and join friends.
1413000	1420000	And now look at some of the other stuff that PlayStation has been offering. SharePlay, the ability to stream now streaming isn't really a plus feature, right?
1421000	1427000	Streaming is inherently a thing, but the SharePlay or private streaming, that's a huge deal, I think. And that's something that you get with the plus.
1428000	1433000	Being able to form the parties kind of natively in the system and have that party chat no matter what game you're in.
1434000	1439000	Like having to use a secondary app for that, that's very hit and miss. I think it's, I don't think it's connecting with people.
1440000	1444000	And that's one big problem I think Nintendo's having and where it's feeling like they're really playing catch up.
1445000	1448000	I think that app is holding them back because the app just doesn't do enough.
1449000	1452000	It was a dumb idea. I don't even know what the thought process.
1453000	1454000	Everybody's doing an app.
1455000	1461000	But no, not everybody's doing an app. Sony doesn't have an app that I need to use for voice chat.
1462000	1464000	Microsoft doesn't have an app that I need to use for voice chat.
1465000	1470000	Now, ActDeft takes a little deeper dive in our chat about what's wrong with Nintendo's online saying,
1471000	1477000	What I want for Nintendo online is better servers, not a peer-to-peer service. I shouldn't be paying for peer-to-peer.
1477000	1484000	Now, there's a more direct shot on what Nintendo is, you know, not giving that the other ones are giving us.
1485000	1489000	I know ActDeft's been having a lot of problems with Nintendo online.
1490000	1494000	So, not too surprised to see him very vocal about that in our chat room.
1495000	1498000	Let's see, Tiberius suggests, how about extended demos?
1498000	1504000	Miltonious Games, or excuse me, Miltonious Games, I can't see if that's two eyes or not,
1505000	1508000	says maybe like an EA Access-style trial for games.
1509000	1514000	More types of streaming things, but I don't know what is the Switch necessarily capable of.
1515000	1520000	These may be things that Nintendo is challenged to think about with Switch Plus or whatever they're going to do.
1520000	1530000	Like, new Switch, Switch 2, whatever inevitable, like, not successor, but upgrade they end up selling to the Switch happens to be.
1531000	1535000	I think these are things they might have to think about, is this console beefy enough to do more of this competitive online stuff?
1536000	1541000	And I think that's where you're going to start to see Nintendo online kind of start to have to develop an offer more. We'll see.
1542000	1543000	Yeah, I don't know.
1544000	1550000	Anyway, alright, I think that's enough on Nintendo for now. We have some other stories later on in the show that deal with Nintendo things,
1551000	1555000	so let's get into our gaming weeks and talk about the video games that we have been playing this week, Nintendo or not.
1556000	1557000	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1558000	1566000	Well, I didn't play a whole ton of things. I played Skyrim a little bit on stream and I played Dance Dance Revolution a little bit on stream,
1566000	1574000	so I did some more of the edit doubles stuff there. I switched down to one camera because my other camera is for my Skyrim setup,
1575000	1582000	so I had to move it, and I didn't feel like moving it back and forth, and we really don't need two cameras, so whatevs.
1583000	1593000	And then what else? So, I did a little bit of Pokemon Go. I still haven't played any Kingdom Hearts yet because I just didn't bother to do it.
1593000	1598000	I don't know, I could have played it when my wife was gone, but meh. I don't know.
1599000	1601000	I'm looking forward to this week's Crackdown 3 finally coming out.
1602000	1603000	Oh yeah, that's a sweet feeling.
1604000	1609000	So I'll have to pick that up once I get paid, but yeah, that'll play on PC. That's going to be awesome.
1610000	1617000	I watched some video of the online mode, and I could do without that. That's fine.
1618000	1619000	Are you at least going to try it?
1619000	1626000	Eh, I don't know. Maybe. It doesn't really matter to me, but the destruction part of it, like,
1627000	1631000	it's fully destructive and stuff like that, and we need the cloud to drive this stuff.
1632000	1637000	Dude, I gotta be honest. You see more destruction in the Battlefield games than you do in this thing.
1638000	1644000	It's kind of a waste of the tech if you ask me, but we'll give it a try.
1645000	1650000	I'll wait and see what it looks like, but at the very least the end of the single player game is going to be awesome, so I'm done with that.
1651000	1653000	And then, yeah, I think that was it.
1654000	1657000	Alright, well I played a few games this week. I had to make some notes. That's why I'm playing with my phone over here,
1658000	1660000	because I actually made some notes about things I played this week.
1661000	1663000	So I played a little more Kingdom Hearts 3. I don't have a lot more to say that I didn't say last week,
1664000	1666000	but I'm enjoying my time with the game. I'm taking it nice and slow.
1667000	1672000	I know this is the point now where a lot of the more fans and people that were really anxiously awaiting Kingdom Hearts 3,
1672000	1676000	more and more people are beating it, so I'm just trying to take it at my own pace,
1677000	1679000	because it's going to be 13 years before there's another one.
1680000	1682000	So, you know what, I'm going to take it at my speed.
1683000	1687000	And that's because I also tend to play things like World of Warcraft quite a bit and in between.
1688000	1692000	I've just been playing more WoW lately. It's kind of been my MMO. Final Fantasy XIV has been kind of on the back burner a little bit,
1693000	1695000	just because you're kind of getting towards the end of expansion right now in XIV,
1696000	1698000	and so I feel like there's not as much to do.
1698000	1704000	I mean, there will be a new story patch before the next expansion officially, so I'll get excited about it again then,
1705000	1709000	but for right now, I've just been kind of filling the void, because I haven't been playing World of Warcraft for years, regularly, really.
1710000	1713000	So I got another character up to 120. I hit max level on my Shaman.
1714000	1716000	Resto is mostly what I'm playing there, so I have a healer now.
1717000	1719000	So that's three, that's actually three characters I have at 120.
1720000	1725000	I have a Horde, Resto Druid, and an Alliance, Resto Shaman, and Alliance Goblin Warlock.
1725000	1728000	So I've been playing a lot of WoW, but it's fun.
1729000	1733000	I don't even really do the raiding or anything like that. I do the world quests.
1734000	1738000	You can do a lot of upgrading through world quests and doing those events, and it's nice. I just take things at my own pace.
1739000	1745000	Okay, I also played some more Pokemon Let's Go this week. I know that game came out a while ago,
1746000	1753000	but because of the Pokemon Go event, where they're like, hey, don't you want to get Meltan more frequently out of boxes?
1753000	1759000	And I'm like, I still have not gotten to the point in Pokemon Let's Go where you can start, because it's a ways into the game.
1760000	1766000	You have to get past at least four gym leaders, which that's over half the gym leaders, in the game before you can do that.
1767000	1773000	So finally, I had some time on Friday while I was at a friend's, and they were doing a board game thing that I wasn't in.
1774000	1779000	So I had some time to play Switch, and I got caught up to that point in the game in Let's Go.
1779000	1786000	So I finally gave myself a freaking Meltan box in Pokemon Go, and I got a shiny Meltan.
1787000	1791000	My very last Pokemon in my first box was shiny, so I was happy about that.
1792000	1794000	Yeah, I'll have to try that. I haven't gotten a shiny one yet.
1795000	1798000	Well, Go's doing a special event just for a couple weeks, I think, where you have a chance at a shiny one.
1798000	1808000	I've got the big evolved one, though, but I need one also that's for Pokemon Let's Go as well.
1809000	1810000	I don't know.
1811000	1815000	Interesting take from DJ Rama S in our chat on why people are moving fast through Kingdom Hearts.
1816000	1824000	The only reason why I've seen so many people power through Kingdom Hearts 3 is because most of those people are cosplayers, and they're trying to get their cosplays done for Katsucon this weekend.
1825000	1828000	That's a good point. Thank you, DJ Rama S. I didn't think about that.
1829000	1835000	ActDeaf reminded me I need to get a couple more shinies if I want a shiny Meltan and Melmetal in Let's Go.
1836000	1837000	There's a shiny Dratini on your house.
1838000	1840000	You just got a shiny Dratini? No, the shinies are per person.
1841000	1843000	If I tap it always. So you just got a shiny just now?
1844000	1846000	Yeah. Good for you. Look at that. Show them on the Twitch feed.
1847000	1848000	I already have one of these, though.
1849000	1852000	I know Dratini's not as exciting because they already had a community day.
1853000	1857000	Well, lucky you. Get one of those little piggies. Shiny. That's supposed to be the thing going on.
1858000	1859000	That might finally be over.
1860000	1861000	I've gotten so many of those.
1862000	1864000	That's still going. The Chinese New Year thing.
1865000	1869000	Our chat is lighting up. ActDeaf is like, Damn, Loki. That's lucky.
1870000	1872000	And Bobby's like, It's just a shiny. LOL.
1873000	1876000	I don't know. I don't really care about the shinies.
1876000	1879000	Suddenly a wild Shane approaches and is like, I'll take that shiny from you.
1880000	1884000	Alright. Quest buster. Loki gets a shiny. Oh, okay.
1886000	1888000	Alright. Other things I played this week.
1889000	1892000	I played Overcooked 2. Have you played those games? The Overcooked games? No.
1893000	1898000	So I was at a buddy's house and they have it and so we were playing like four player Overcooked.
1899000	1902000	And it was a little harder for me because they all kind of knew the game and I didn't know it so well.
1902000	1905000	So, I mean, the game definitely has a learning curve.
1906000	1909000	And we were trying to do some of the like, I guess they have like special event levels.
1910000	1912000	So they had like Lunar New Year levels and I felt like I was getting in the way.
1913000	1918000	So if you haven't played Overcooked, it's like you have to go get the ingredient to make the dish.
1919000	1924000	Like somebody might order a hamburger, but they want their, or somebody wants a chicken sandwich and this person wants a hamburger.
1925000	1927000	So you might have to do like bun, tomato, burger.
1928000	1931000	And then for another you have to do bun, tomato, chicken or something like that.
1932000	1938000	So you have to go like get the ingredient and sometimes you have to fry it in a pan or you have to boil rice or whatever the ingredient is.
1939000	1941000	And then you have to put them on a plate in a certain order and then serve it.
1942000	1951000	Well it gets really hysterical when there's like four people all running over each other because you can't walk on top of each other so you're all getting each other's way.
1952000	1959000	And then you have certain stages where like the conveyor belts start moving or you're in a hot air balloon where you just get blown out of the balloon and stuff like that.
1959000	1964000	I've seen the one with trains or whatever, like it's two moving trains or something.
1965000	1967000	Okay, so you've seen some footage in the game.
1968000	1974000	So that was a little bit that I played, but I was like, I am just getting in the way because they're very fast at it.
1975000	1978000	They're just able to pick up the fish, chop the fish, boil the fish, whatever they do. They were doing it all fast.
1979000	1982000	So I ended up just, I had to go to the corner and wash dishes.
1983000	1986000	So when the dishes came back I'd wash it and then put it in another stack.
1986000	1989000	So that was one less thing everybody else had to worry about. I was like, I found my little roll.
1990000	1997000	And I guess Overcooked kind of works that way. Everybody kind of finds their different ways in the assembly line, but it always gets screwed up somehow.
1998000	2005000	Because there'll be an order that you didn't account for in your assembly line or something gets screwed up or there's a fire and so it all gets screwed up.
2006000	2008000	Anyway, that was a little Overcooked that I played this week.
2009000	2014000	And I also played some board games. I should give a shout out to board games here on the show because I don't talk enough about them.
2014000	2020000	But of course I like board games. I mean, I talk a lot about video games. I don't get to play board games a lot.
2021000	2023000	Alan and I have a few, but we don't really just play the two of us board games.
2024000	2034000	And it's very rare that I get invited to board game stuff, but I went to this LGBTQ plus board game day in San Francisco and I had a good time.
2035000	2041000	We played Codenames, I think was the name of the game. It was a word guessing game and I liked that a lot.
2041000	2046000	And then we played one called Pandemic that I think is pretty popular. A lot of board gamers probably know that game.
2047000	2055000	I never played it before, but that was a lot of fun because in, you know, there's more and more board games where like, I remember board games as I always kind of knew them were always like one person wins.
2056000	2058000	It's like, you know, monopoly, one winner, clue, one winner, right?
2059000	2066000	But now there's more and more games where it's like, it's you against the game. And that's something like Pandemic. It's all the players against the game.
2066000	2070000	So it's kind of neat and the different ways you draw cards will affect what happens in the game.
2071000	2076000	And I've played other like deck building games like that. It's like, there was like a DC heroes game and Sentinels, the multiverse was that.
2077000	2083000	I've played one that was as on the board game thing with Cthulhu. I don't remember what it was, but there was one where it's everybody against Cthulhu.
2084000	2090000	So, and Cthulhu won, you know, as, as he normally does. Yeah. So I had a board game day, so that was fun.
2090000	2096000	Uh, and then the other video game I played this week was Apex Legends, because there's a lot of people going crazy about this game also.
2097000	2101000	We'll get into it a little later in the show, but I mean, we talked about it last week and we're kind of like, eh, we'll see what happens.
2102000	2106000	And all of a sudden, like it blows up. Right. Yeah. So I was like, all right, I got to see what all this fuss is about. Right.
2107000	2115000	I tried four nights. I got to try Apex Legends. Sadly, I did not like, there is a tutorial, but that's like, it's very short and there's not a lot to it.
2116000	2124000	And there's no like PvE or there's no practice or there's no, you have to jump in there and do a squad of three people and do it.
2125000	2134000	So I've been a little scared to go past the tutorial. I will get past the tutorial later, but that's really all I've done is beat the tutorial way, which is more than some people playing Cuphead.
2135000	2140000	All right. But obviously I didn't have a lot of tutorial in Cuphead. There is, remember there's like an infamous.
2141000	2150000	So yeah, that's such a brief part of the game. Yeah. So anyway, I've, I've played that, but that's sadly about as far as I've gotten, but I do, I just had a busy weekend.
2151000	2159000	I didn't get to play more and that game just came out on like what Monday or Tuesday. So Monday really taken off since then, but we'll get into that a little later in the show, but I did at least download it and check it out.
2160000	2165000	It's a nice looking game. I'll give it that, but I'll expand on my thoughts, I guess a little bit later when we get into more on Apex Legends.
2165000	2172000	So, all right. I guess we will get into some gaming news. I don't have a lot of housekeeping, but I will say as always, you can follow us on Twitter at twitter.com slash O L R.
2173000	2178000	Uh, and of course we're also on Facebook at orange lounge radio. Uh, but the best place to follow us is right here on Twitch at VOG network.
2179000	2185000	And we appreciate all the follows and appreciate the subscriptions and the biddies, uh, that people have been showing us. Well, we really appreciate all that.
2186000	2194000	Thank you so much for helping this, uh, move to Twitch, uh, for VOG network be really successful so far, but we've been having a good time on Twitch and hopefully getting our show out to more people.
2195000	2198000	Uh, a lot of fun. So, all right, let's get into some other gaming news. Loki.
2199000	2210000	All right. So unfortunately there are rumors that there's going to be a massive layoffs at Activision Blizzard, uh, according to some rumblings from the employees of the publisher.
2211000	2222000	Um, this is supposedly going to go down on Tuesday and it's supposed to take place right before the, um, quarterly earnings call that they're going to have.
2222000	2231000	Um, it's expected according to reports from Bloomberg that the layoffs are going to be in numbering in the hundreds.
2232000	2242000	And of course, um, they didn't, Activision hasn't really confirmed that this is going to happen or not, but I guess we'll have to wait and see.
2242000	2258000	Um, the thought is that it's supposed to be for like cost cutting. Um, cause now I don't know with like some of these games like hall of duty and stuff, even though black ops four was like one of the more successful games of 2018.
2259000	2271000	Um, it didn't meet, it failed to meet expectations. This is what they do all the time. So you have a game that comes out, they set the expectations way too high because you know, they're trying to beat the numbers for the previous year.
2272000	2275000	So a big studio probably spent a lot of money developing it to be fair.
2276000	2285000	Well, it's, they have like four or five studios developing call of duty games. So whatever paying all that overtime pay for crunch time because they didn't plan appropriately.
2286000	2299000	Um, but still, so you're going to have this game come out, it's going to not meet expectations ever. And then they're going to cut, um, employees to bring down the cost of the studio.
2299000	2309000	So that, you know, shareholders will be happy. And so Bobby coca tick can make his millions of dollars. Um, so yeah, so we'll have to see what happens.
2310000	2317000	But unfortunately, um, you know, now also being that destiny is going to part, you know, bungees kind of parting ways with destiny.
2317000	2329000	Um, I don't know. It's not, not a great sign. So, um, we may hear of, uh, quite a few layoffs in the next day or so.
2330000	2344000	Well, I mean, I hope it's not true, but, um, I think unfortunately this type of news is inevitable in the industry. I think a lot of people, you know, I follow a lot of people on Twitter that are very loyal for Blizzard products because, you know, I had the Warcraft podcast a long time ago.
2344000	2354000	Rest in peace, courthouse. Um, but, uh, you know, I followed a lot of people in the Blizzard community back in that state. So a lot of people were very curious how this may affect Blizzard. You know, Blizzard's had a lot of changes.
2355000	2367000	Um, they, uh, scaled back on heroes, the storm, which is very controversial. We all know what happened with Diablo. We don't need to retread that ground. Um, but obviously it did not go the, the reveal and the hype did not go the way that was anticipated.
2367000	2382000	Um, whether they anticipated correctly or not is not the point. It just was not what is anticipated. Um, and, um, and so on. So some people, and then, um, you know, this is Overwatch League. Somebody in chat just mentioned Overwatch League is about to start, you know, in a matter of days.
2382000	2397000	So it's like, what, what might happen at Blizzard? And that's, that's kind of scary. And obviously, you know, it's a company that a lot of people love and adore because of their games, but Blizzard also makes games in a certain way that doesn't mesh well with the big culture.
2398000	2407000	If you think about it, when was the last time Blizzard put out a game that was not an expansion or an update patch? When was the last time Blizzard put out a new game?
2408000	2425000	Overwatch. Yeah. And when was Overwatch? A little bit ago. It was a little, a little while ago at this point. It was two years ago at this point. So I think their style of development, while it's worked for them in the past, it's not working for a company that's needing to deliver the hits a little faster.
2425000	2433000	And this is where I think some of the Blizzard fans get really agitated with the Activision ownership because they miss the Blizzard from before.
2433000	2446000	Well, Activision though, too, like I just think with these games, I mean, what more can you possibly do to them that this is the problem we have? Like you have Call of Duty, which is like one of the best selling games each year.
2447000	2455000	You're selling that. You're selling the season pass that go along with that. You're selling all of the loot boxes and stuff that go along with that.
2456000	2469000	It's just like if all of that combined is not enough to make the amount of money that you want to make, where's it going to come from? Because you only have a finite amount of people that are going to buy the game.
2469000	2476000	And I can tell you this much, cutting out the single player campaign, that made at least one less person that bought that game because that was something I was looking forward to.
2476000	2485000	Instead, you're jumping on a bandwagon with the battle royale stuff, which on top of that, you're even selling more loot boxes for more like cosmetics or whatever.
2486000	2498000	It's just it's all a money grab. And this is the problem is it's it's less now. It seems like about making a good game. It's more of like how can we engineer this to make us the most money?
2498000	2508000	And it's becoming so transparent that that's what it is, that people are kind of turned off by it. And I just think that they kind of have to step back and actually make some good games.
2508000	2520000	And I'm not saying on the Blizzard side of the house, I'm talking more of the Activision side of the house where it's just like, let's just take any of these franchises and just stamp them into the ground until we can get all the money out of it.
2520000	2524000	You know, Tar Hero. Hello. You know, they destroyed.
2524000	2533000	Yes, but but I just just the Guitar Hero revival was probably better than the consumers gave it credit for. You know what I mean?
2533000	2543000	Like it's just one of those things was like, yes, I told when they had the Guitar Hero like tour edition and all this stuff that came out like all at once in one year, it was just too much.
2544000	2552000	They were milk and a cow that was already on its way out the door. But when they did that revival, it's it's unfortunate in my opinion, because it was better than it was worth.
2552000	2563000	And DJ Hero, which came out in that same era where too much hero was happening at once. Also, I think an unfortunate victim of too much because that game was better than y'all gave it credit for.
2563000	2568000	So many people slept on that game, in my opinion. But maybe not everybody's into the music games like we were.
2568000	2574000	I hope you still want to get in on that. I can tell you right now, Goodwill has a ton of those turntables like dirt.
2574000	2581000	And it's unfortunate you can't like but it's like my PlayStation three is long since like not really utilized.
2581000	2589000	I think you can get all your guitar controllers or hey, you're in the market for a Wii Fit balance board because they've got stacks of those.
2589000	2597000	You get that stuff so dirt cheap. It's funny trying to like see what they think that they're supposed to because, of course, the people that work there, they don't know what half that shit coming in is.
2597000	2602000	And so they're like, OK, I'm going to take the turntable. I'm going to put two turntables in the crossfader in the middle.
2602000	2605000	Yeah, that looks about right. We'll sell that for five dollars.
2605000	2611000	All right. Well, going out to the chat, because you guys have a lot to say in our chat, lots of talk on Hearthstone actually in chat.
2611000	2618000	Questbuster says Hearthstone saw player declines and killed the tournament scene and Overwatch growth was flat from their last quarterly report.
2618000	2623000	Well, I mean, what what Overwatch is it?
2623000	2628000	I mean, sure, they had a new character once in a while and a new map, but it's not enough to like grow the player base.
2628000	2635000	What is going to make more people what is going to make new people want to check out Overwatch playing game?
2635000	2643000	I don't know. I my opinion, single player mode, even though I completely understand that is completely against what Overwatch is about.
2643000	2651000	And if you want to bring in new people, what that aren't already playing it, you want to bring in new people to experience it.
2651000	2656000	I think that the key is to do a single player mode, because then the people they're always like, I don't want to play a team based game.
2656000	2662000	I want to do this. Then they'll be, oh, well, now I'll check it out because that's a single player story, something I can check out.
2662000	2671000	That's my opinion on how you get Overwatch to game, because it's I mean, I would who out there in gamer world that is interested in a team based shooter
2671000	2675000	has not at least like tried Overwatch on one of those free weekends or something at this point.
2675000	2682000	You know, if you haven't bought the game now that it's down to like 20 bucks, then it's very much a financial slash hardware type of decision.
2682000	2686000	You know, I just I just who's left to buy Overwatch. I mean, that's just my opinion.
2686000	2691000	Let's see. And there was another comment here I want to read in our chat at Twitch TV slash VOG Network.
2691000	2699000	Miltonius game says my friend is a hardcore follower of Hearthstone, and even he stopped playing after they nerfed some classic cards.
2699000	2709000	You know, Blizzard has been trying to milk games a long time after they're out, and not so many games get to do that nowadays.
2709000	2720000	You know, Blizzard was maybe a precedent got set with World of Warcraft, where for years and years and years, they were the dominant MMO and went unchallenged.
2720000	2728000	And in many ways, they still are. I think really WoW is just another one of those things where it's like it's just I think a victim of its own age.
2728000	2736000	People just let it go because they move on to doing other stuff. They don't like a change or they don't like where the expansion went or something.
2736000	2742000	Or you know what, the group the group that they were rating with just fell apart because sometimes people grow apart.
2742000	2747000	One person got a new job that and then the whole thing fell apart. So they all canceled their WoW accounts.
2748000	2755000	I wonder how far away we are from like some of these games because they're trying to find ways to get more money out of them.
2755000	2764000	Where maybe not so much now with the loot boxes or they can still do loot boxes, I guess, but adding a subscription service to it instead.
2764000	2771000	Like kind of go in the World of Warcraft model where like, hey, we're in charge, you know, $12 a month for Overwatch.
2771000	2777000	You know what WoW needs to do, in my opinion, if Warcraft wants to, again, grow beyond what you already have.
2777000	2785000	Grow beyond the people that have played. The trying to catch up in WoW can feel very overwhelming at this point because there's so much and so many expansion things.
2785000	2793000	I think for one, they need to sell World of Warcraft for 20 bucks. That's just everything.
2793000	2798000	Stop trying to piecemeal original game. I know they grouped some expansions together, but you know what?
2798000	2804000	They need to just do the whole kit and caboodle for 20 bucks and then make their money off the monthly fees or whatever.
2804000	2812000	That's what they need to do at World of Warcraft. And honestly, I think it should be free to play up far past where it is now.
2812000	2818000	I think the entirety of at least vanilla WoW ought to be free to play. At least, if not Burning Crusade and Lich King.
2818000	2824000	Why not top it out when Warcraft was at its peak? Let people go to Lich King for free. You know what I mean? I don't know. That's thought.
2824000	2833000	Or when it comes to something like World of Warcraft, or I was going to say Final Fantasy XIV, something interesting they're doing.
2833000	2837000	And this came out of their Paris Fan Fest, which we'll talk about in more detail later on in the show.
2837000	2845000	But they, and you may have noticed this on Twitch, if you're a Twitch Prime person, you can get Final Fantasy XIV for free up to level 15.
2845000	2852000	You get the base basically Realm Reborn for free right now. And I think it might be a free month. Correct me if I'm wrong, chatters?
2852000	2853000	It's 30 days.
2853000	2861000	Is it 30 days for free for Twitch Prime? So that is a very smart thing for Square to do with an expansion that they're pushing in June.
2861000	2869000	Let people get to that point now in the game and really get to winning that expansion and then sell them the expansion. You know what I mean?
2869000	2871000	I thought about it, Buzzing.
2872000	2877000	It's like 30 days for free. Get them hooked, right? So I think Square is doing the type of thing right now.
2877000	2884000	And I realize, you know, I know I've personally talked about that I enjoy Final Fantasy XIV a lot. It does not compete with numbers wise with WoW.
2884000	2887000	I mean it does very well, but it doesn't do as good as WoW.
2887000	2896000	Who knows though? Activision Blizzard hasn't released WoW numbers for a while, but I assume just based on people streaming it on Twitch, people talking about it on Twitter.
2896000	2903000	There's probably just more people on WoW still than there is Final Fantasy. WoW is still going to take a long time to topple, but it's not the 10 million it once was.
2903000	2909000	So, anyway. Some folks in chat, interesting. Bobby Blackwell saying,
2909000	2914000	I remember back when everyone thought EverQuest was the 800 pound gorilla and would never be dethroned.
2914000	2916000	I'm going to come back to that thought in a minute actually.
2916000	2919000	Miltonius Games says, Battle Pass is the new kind of subscription model.
2919000	2924000	S2100Matt says, sports games are going to have to go that subscription route. It kind of already is leaning towards that.
2924000	2933000	You know, you're kind of paying for the yearly updates to the rosters and some new, you know, that's why everybody makes those jokes about roster update 2019 or whatever. Anyway.
2933000	2942000	Miltonius just pointed out, ESO has my favorite MMO model. A lot of people like that. Buy the game once, you don't have to pay a monthly fee anymore.
2942000	2948000	I know that monthly fee turns a lot of people away, but that's how Blizzard made its money for years and years and years.
2948000	2956000	So it's going to be interesting. So it happens again. I hope layoffs don't occur, but it wouldn't be surprising at this point, especially on the Activision side.
2956000	2964000	I don't think Blizzard is going to be as hurt by this as we think. I think Blizzard's already made those cutbacks with what we've seen happen with Heroes of the Storm and so on.
2964000	2970000	But I think I would worry a little more for the Activision side and I hope we're wrong and I hope this is all just rumors. But you know what?
2970000	2978000	Some of the interesting things that the big companies have had to deal with lately is that, you know, how many, how many times we've heard this story?
2978000	2989000	Developers that used to work for XYZ big company have spun off and started their own indie studio and developed this indie darling for PC and Switch, PlayStation 4.
2989000	2997000	You know, how often are we hearing that these days? So, you know, even for folks that may unfortunately experience a layoff with Activision,
2997000	3011000	I hope folks are able to find the diamond in the rough, you know, is that maybe new studios will be birthed where they can do something on a smaller budget, you know, with a smaller risk and maybe still a great reward because a lot of those indie titles are still doing pretty well for themselves.
3011000	3020000	Yeah. So we'll see. Anyway, I want to move on to another story because I think in some ways this is actually related a little bit. Bear with me.
3020000	3037000	I want to talk about The Behemoth from this week. Like literally second story slot on our last episode was, oh, we're hearing rumors that EA might drop this game called Apex Legends on us this next week from the Titanfall developers.
3037000	3049000	We didn't know a whole lot besides that, right? Well, it dropped on Monday and boy did it drop because they are saying that as far as Apex Legends go, it is landed hugely.
3049000	3061000	What were they saying? I think it was saying 10 million people within the first like already and it's not even been out a week and 10 million people have already downloaded it and experienced it up to, I think they said a million people online at the same time.
3061000	3069000	And now some blogs and some sites are questioning, could Apex Legends be a threat to Fortnite's dominance?
3069000	3078000	And this kind of ties back to what Bobby was saying is that at one point we all thought EverQuest was going to be The Behemoth that can never be toppled.
3078000	3092000	Now here we are looking at a game that at least this week, we'll see what the longevity holds, but at least this week has managed to really put a little, a little bruise on Fortnite.
3092000	3099000	Go look at what the top streaming games are on Twitch. I don't know what they are right now, but I'm going to guess it's Apex Legends.
3100000	3107000	Almost like a hero shooter battle royale type game. They kind of took a little bit from Overwatch.
3107000	3125000	Yeah, they did. And, um, you know, and I'm sure one thing that many of you have been hearing about Apex Legends as well is that, uh, there's some very strong, uh, representation in the game, you know, which I know some people go a big deal, but you know, for some people, yes, it's a big deal because it's like, oh, you get to see yourself, you know, represented in the game.
3125000	3138000	Okay. Like to me, like, and I was thinking about this earlier, like a lot of these announcements nowadays seem very forced. Like it's like, we're just including it just, I'm going to stop you right there because it's not the developers.
3138000	3150000	It's not these people that are forcing it. What's happening. And this is the mistake so many fucking people are making. I'm sorry. I get very passionate about this because when you read the responses to things on Twitter, it's like, so what, who cares?
3150000	3162000	And all this stuff. Well, for one, when I hear that there's like a gay dude in, um, Apex Legends, I go, well, I care. That's pretty awesome in a way. But here's the thing, you know, who's making a big deal out of it.
3162000	3177000	They're usually, these things are in little quotes. So for example, there was a interview that they did with this website, rock paper shotgun, which I don't even, I've heard of that site, but it's not, oh, I'm going to be real shady here for a minute.
3177000	3187000	It's not like the one I'm going to go to every day. Right? Right. It's not an, a little God, somebody's going to send this to them and they're going to hate us. It's not like the A-list site that everybody knows about.
3187000	3199000	You know what I mean? When it comes to gaming news, right? They were asked in an interview if this, uh, is, is bloodhound non-binary and it was confirmed that fact. Okay. So it was asked in this one interview, not a big deal, right?
3199000	3215000	It was asked in an interview question by this outlet that wanted to know the answer. The answer was given. Then what happened, Loki? Every other website takes it and runs with it. The developer didn't make a big deal out of it, Loki. Everybody else did.
3215000	3233000	All right. I'm just thinking back to like, you know, the original Metroid one, we didn't even know the main character's gender in that game. I mean, and it, it just, it didn't matter because it's just a fucking video game. It doesn't like, it doesn't matter. Like what do I care about the sexuality of this person that's killing other people is, I mean, it's, it's just the person killing another person.
3233000	3244000	There's, there was no internet at the time, Loki. So it's a little bit different because if the internet had been out, then probably, you know, that, that little spoiler probably would have been out there a lot sooner.
3244000	3248000	I mean, I get it. It was, when that happened, it was a big deal, you know?
3248000	3272000	Right, but why? I get it. Chicks can be heroes too. No, I get that it's important to some people, but I'm, what I'm trying to say is that like, unless the game is having me engage in sex with people, I don't see how the sexuality of the character even comes into play at all in the, as, I mean, it's cool to have that as the background of the character, but it doesn't really, it's not a part of the game, I guess.
3272000	3276000	Okay. So play the game then.
3276000	3287000	Exactly. I don't care about that. I'm just like, I don't, I'm just thinking like from an outsider looking, it's just like we see a lot more of these announcements that, oh yeah, this character is this person now. Oh, this character is this. And it's like,
3287000	3291000	It wasn't an announcement. That's where I'm correcting you. It wasn't an announcement.
3291000	3294000	But what about like on the Overwatch side of things?
3295000	3307000	They also remember with Blizzard, also remember that they were under a lot of pressure because when you look at the characters in World of Warcraft, it's a lot of, you know, big titty delves and you know, there was very low stereotype there.
3307000	3317000	So they were under a lot of pressure to really make, you know, make something that reflects the fucking real world. And so when they did Overwatch, they did a really good job, but it's also, Loki, it is kind of the same thing.
3317000	3328000	Blizzard did not put out a press release that said she's gay. They didn't do that. What happened is that they put it in one comic book. They said, by the way, Trish got a girlfriend, you know, there's a nice story.
3328000	3341000	And for those that are gay, it's like, Oh my God, like somebody, like there's somebody out there like me. It's not always like the same thing. I see something that actually represents me a little bit. And then everybody else runs with the headline.
3342000	3351000	It's Kotaku and it's all these other websites. Sorry, I'm picking on one, but it's all these sites. It's rock, paper, shotgun. It's everybody that's running the headlines and saying, Tracer's gay.
3351000	3357000	All right, cool. Yeah, I don't know. Neat.
3357000	3366000	Um, let's see. Uh, let's see. Uh, Darted Studio says, I do kind of get where Loki's coming from though. To be fair, I'm all for representation. I mean it is, it is a little exhausting.
3366000	3376000	I'm not saying there shouldn't be representation. I'm just saying like, cause there's some people that are like, Oh, there's, there's, you know, people that aren't, men are, you know, are, are straight.
3376000	3391000	Well then I'm just not going to play this game. And there's stupid people out there. But like, I don't know. I just don't, I don't even know why people are asking these questions. I, whatever. I guess it's, it's cool. They can ask whatever they want.
3391000	3403000	Well, I think, I think in Bloodhound's case, it's very ambiguous in the game is that, and I think there were a lot of people going, well, looking at how diverse this cast is, Bloodhound, you can't see Bloodhound's face.
3403000	3416000	So, and the voice is kind of, you're not sure. So I think there were a lot of people going, is Bloodhound male? Is Bloodhound female? And so I think somebody asked the question, like, where is Bloodhound male or female? And the answer was, Bloodhound is neither.
3416000	3427000	Bloodhound is a non-binary character. Oh, wait, that's a thing. People can be non-binary. Yeah. And you wouldn't have known cause the game never showed it to you before.
3427000	3428000	I guess that's cool.
3428000	3439000	Yeah. So that's just, but anyway, okay. Let's back up from that. Obviously that is exciting and all that other stuff. I mean, as far as, you know, Loki someday it won't be such a big deal.
3439000	3448000	Someday, someday it'll just be like, oh cool. Like, you know, there's a couple, you know, black women that are a part of this squad and we see that all the time.
3448000	3456000	So I'm used to seeing that now because yes, a certain population of the planet happens to be black women. And so, you know, like there will come a time. We're not at that time.
3456000	3462000	And especially if you look at all the other stuff in society, I can talk to you off about this for hours and hours. I'm not going to do that.
3462000	3480000	Right. Let's go back to the whole apex legends and the, um, you know, the, the impact that it's having here today gone tomorrow. I'm not saying Fortnite's going to go under or anything like that, but it is very interesting how the attitudes in gaming and how the gaming community and so forth that can shift on a dime.
3480000	3496000	You know what I mean? And it's like, if I am Epic and I am the creators of Fortnite, you bet your ass I'm watching this going, oh shit, somebody's here to, you know, snatch a lot of the people that are looking at Fortnite because it is another battle royale game.
3496000	3502000	But to be fair, didn't Fortnite do that to PUBG? Right?
3502000	3515000	Yeah. And look, PUBG's doing fine for itself. It's still a game that a lot of people are playing. Fortnite's not going to die. I mean, you can't play apex legends on the switch or mobile phones. So Fortnite's still a thing there.
3515000	3523000	So I'm not saying like, oh, there can be only one. That's not what I'm saying. But you've got it. Like the dominance, the king of the pack, the number one movie at the box office.
3523000	3532000	That's going to change at some point as attitudes start changing. And so apex legends like literally came out of nowhere and has now kind of done that.
3532000	3544000	And I'm sure that free price tag has gone a long way in doing that. But, you know, a lot of people I think also appreciate, yes, they do loot boxes, but they tell you the percentages right up front. Right.
3545000	3547000	And these other things that they're doing.
3547000	3556000	And also like with that, though, it's like, I don't feel as bad with loot boxes in a game that's free to play. You know, it's not like you're trying to sell me a $60 game.
3556000	3569000	And by the way, you also need to buy the season pass and you need to buy all these loot boxes because we need to make all the money and we're still not meeting our expectations. So let's fire 100 people.
3570000	3580000	Questbuster says it also helps that when apex legends dropped, it wasn't a demo or a beta. It was a finished triple a battle royale that no one expected. And it's been holding up quite well, which is interesting.
3580000	3587000	Now, isn't this interesting? Apex legends essentially is an EA game, right? Because respawn and it's through origin. It's an EA game.
3588000	3599000	So now I'm looking at Anthem and they had kind of a trouble demo weekend, but this apex legends has had no problems.
3599000	3607000	Now I'm not going to look every time I try to talk about why can't the servers just fucking work. I hear from the tech people on why the servers can't just fucking work.
3607000	3615000	But let's be real. The consumers have got to be looking at this going apex. I mean, it's had some hiccups. I had like a difficult.
3615000	3619000	I couldn't connect to the server right away, but I literally clicked retry and then it worked.
3619000	3624000	So like just minor little hiccups. Apex legends has been kind of working, especially for a game that's free.
3624000	3632000	You could say, though, that it could slightly undercut, you know, because that's where I'm going.
3632000	3637000	It's free to play and it works versus paying $60 for something that it hopefully will work.
3637000	3651000	If I were Bioware, I would be fucking livid right now. I would be livid that EA, my corporate bosses, allowed this game to drop four weeks before my big game.
3651000	3659000	Well, that's $60 to buy that had a forced online early staggered thing done by the publisher.
3659000	3665000	So some of the early warts could be exposed. All that stuff is is it's it's going to cut into sales.
3665000	3671000	Well, to be fair, respawn and kind of hat was on the opposite end of that spectrum.
3671000	3676000	Come Battlefield or Battlefield one and Titanfall two.
3676000	3685000	You remember they released Titanfall two and then it got butchered by, I think, Battlefield one and the Call of Duty game.
3686000	3695000	So. Yeah, so now at least they have something that's come out that hopefully won't be will be doing all of the undercutting instead.
3695000	3702000	But I am very disappointed that Titans aren't in the game because it is in the Titanfall universe, but there's no giant robots or wall running.
3702000	3708000	You do call things down. Like the gal that you play in the very beginning, she's some sort of medic that you play the tutorial level.
3708000	3714000	And like her ultimate is she calls down a big like heel thing or like a heel thing.
3714000	3719000	It's a pod that has supplies in it, like heel supplies. And you see it come down from space and all that stuff.
3719000	3724000	So there's there's elements from the Titanfall games that that kind of make their way in there.
3724000	3727000	The Titans, I know. Well, I mean, this is the beginning.
3727000	3731000	There's only like, what, eight characters in the game, like in six.
3731000	3734000	And then also like all the wall running and stuff that they had in Titanfall is pretty awesome.
3734000	3737000	Like if they had that kind of movement in this.
3737000	3741000	So, I mean, wait, because a lot of that stuff may be a reality later on down the line.
3741000	3745000	I would like to see more like things that I don't necessarily have to team up with other people to do.
3745000	3747000	But we'll see. We'll see. I don't know.
3747000	3751000	Well, I just need to get in there and play already and then maybe I'll kind of change my mind.
3751000	3753000	Oh, it was really fun. It wasn't that bad. We'll see.
3753000	3758000	So but I liked what little little very little I played of Apex Legends so far.
3758000	3764000	But I really I really think this nobody I don't think was expecting it to do this well.
3764000	3767000	And it's going to have some very interesting ripple effects.
3767000	3772000	I think Anthem again, I mean, I might be surprised and the anthem just runs away.
3772000	3778000	But I think that game is being set up to fail in so many ways that, like, again, if I am Bioware,
3778000	3781000	I'm just like, why are you doing this to us?
3781000	3784000	Because it's going to fail to meet expectations.
3784000	3791000	And then hundreds of people are going to get laid off because they have to mitigate costs or something.
3791000	3796000	It's going to be really it's and it's the sad thing is going to be EA's fucking fault all across.
3796000	3799000	This is what they do. They eat studios.
3799000	3803000	Anyway, so but there's that. But then what about like, you know, the Fortnite?
3803000	3808000	It's not that I'm saying like Fortnite is like just suddenly disappear, but maybe Fortnite's dominance is, you know,
3808000	3811000	maybe it's going to be the number two game on Twitch now for a little bit or at least.
3811000	3815000	Or if anything, maybe like PUBG or something is going to get, you know, kind of.
3815000	3819000	Yeah, I think they both will. And I think, you know, any game that's out there, you know, that you only have so many,
3819000	3822000	so much time in the day to play so many games. So I think all the games are gonna be feeling that.
3822000	3828000	But I think now we also see a little more about why Epic has been trying to do more besides just Fortnite.
3828000	3836000	They have used their time at the top of the heap very wisely to launch a new store that gives away free games
3836000	3842000	and ties in with their publishing platform that gives a better cut.
3842000	3845000	They've been using their time on the top of the heat to heap to the best of their ability,
3845000	3849000	because maybe in a way Epic has also foreseen we can't be on the top forever.
3849000	3850000	Yeah.
3850000	3853000	Because tons of people have been trying to come for the battle royale crown.
3853000	3858000	Just nobody has quite succeeded at this level yet. But here we are now.
3858000	3861000	Apex Legends has really come out of the blue. We'll see if they maintain it.
3861000	3864000	After the next genre will come along and then, you know.
3864000	3867000	That will be up to respawn in EA. You're right. Then there'll be another thing.
3867000	3873000	So, um, let's see. Frodo's wagons and chat says they're going to make a lot of money with this game though.
3873000	3876000	Perhaps we'll lead to something else one day. We'll see.
3876000	3880000	Sjoan Hunter-Matt says the shitty thing is they're going to put all this effort to get the servers working for Anthem,
3880000	3884000	only to shut them down in a few short years if the game doesn't sell well.
3884000	3888000	And then Frodo's wagons also says probably a good thing because Titanfall never got that big.
3888000	3895000	And as Bobby pointed out, again, Titanfall 2 was released right next to another game that took all the attention you were kind of getting into.
3895000	3900000	Well, that's another thing, yeah. Like speaking about Anthem there, like I know you like your BioWare games and stuff like that,
3900000	3909000	but like, it's kind of hard for me to sell me on a game that is, given EA's track record, may be unplayable in a few years.
3909000	3916000	I mean, that's pretty, and the same can be said about like the last Call of Duty, Call of Duty Black Ops 4.
3916000	3923000	I mean, that game will be unplayable in a few, you know, at some point when they shut the servers down.
3923000	3929000	I really do think, I think EA's gonna, the person EA's gonna hurt most of all with the success of this game is EA.
3930000	3938000	But we'll see. Maybe I'll be wrong. What do I know? I'm some schmo on the internet with a podcast. What do I know? You know?
3938000	3941000	So, we'll see. Maybe I'll be proven completely wrong.
3941000	3944000	But for now, we'll move on to our next story, Loki.
3944000	3957000	So, since we were talking about Epic and Fortnite, we can also talk about Nintendo because we did reference to them earlier in their online platform and how they have some creative ways to do voice chat.
3957000	3961000	Well, you may remember when Fortnite came out on the Switch, it said,
3961000	3969000	Fuck your stupid way using the app. We just will have you plug in a microphone into the Switch and it'll just fucking work.
3969000	3979000	And so, now they are licensing that voice chat software to other companies that want to be able to put it in their own games.
3979000	3985000	So, the company, Vivox, they are focused on voice and text chat in online games.
3985000	3993000	So, basically, they are going to authorize Switch developers that can integrate the Vivox SDK software kit into their games.
3993000	4004000	Which allowed Switch owners to be able to play games and be able to do voice chat using just the existing audio jack on the Switch itself.
4004000	4013000	And not some stupid phone Switch headset splitter hybrid bullshit that you have to do.
4013000	4015000	Because it just works.
4015000	4027000	So, they are saying that the chat tools will also allow Switch games that incorporate cross-play with PC, Xbox One, or Playstation 4 to work as well.
4027000	4031000	And, yeah. It's pretty awesome.
4031000	4036000	So, interesting that somebody besides Nintendo solved one of Nintendo's online biggest problems.
4036000	4038000	This is so fucking dumb.
4039000	4047000	Well, maybe. And you know what? Maybe Nintendo is going to look at this own thing and just be like, well, we're just going to, you know, if they decide ultimately they want to get rid of the app.
4047000	4054000	I think, Loki, I think the whole time the Switch could have done this perfectly well, I think Nintendo wanted that app to be a big deal.
4054000	4064000	Nintendo wanted that app on everybody's phones because at some point they wanted that app to be like a central hub for Nintendo's growth into the mobile phone thing.
4064000	4070000	So that you could tap other buttons within the map to go right to Mario Run or the upcoming Dr. Mario or things like this.
4070000	4072000	This was part of a bigger picture.
4072000	4074000	But did they ever do any of that with the app?
4074000	4076000	No, it's part of a bigger picture that never came together.
4076000	4078000	That's what I truly think is happening here.
4078000	4080000	I don't think the Switch ever needed that app.
4080000	4082000	Nintendo wanted to make you get that app.
4082000	4086000	But it's just like, it's basically like...
4086000	4089000	Thank you. Bobby phrases this another way.
4089000	4093000	They wanted that app to be a Trojan horse like how Discord did it. That's what I'm saying.
4094000	4099000	But it sounds to me like when I was working at previous companies and they're like,
4099000	4104000	Oh, well this company is doing this and they have an app. We should have an app because they have an app.
4104000	4106000	Do you really need an app?
4106000	4109000	Loki, all the other podcasts have an app.
4109000	4111000	Why doesn't O.L.R. have an app?
4111000	4119000	Shouldn't O.L.R. have an app so you can like download, I don't know, extra shows and I don't know, behind the scenes things and other stuff.
4119000	4121000	Don't we need an app?
4121000	4123000	They have an app. Why can't we have an app?
4123000	4125000	I don't know. Bobby, why don't we have an app?
4127000	4130000	Get working on it, Bobby. We need an app.
4130000	4132000	Maybe Bobby doesn't want to do a fucking app.
4132000	4134000	Now what do we do?
4134000	4138000	Well, gonna have to cobble something together.
4138000	4141000	Here's the thing. The point is, and you know...
4141000	4144000	I still have my old O.L.R. PSP file somewhere.
4144000	4148000	And that was the thing we did that worked for us that not a lot of people did.
4148000	4150000	They have a PSP website. Why don't we have a PSP website?
4150000	4155000	And no disrespect to any podcast with apps. There's an awful lot of them, right?
4155000	4161000	My whole thing is just that what works for one person might not just be in another person's wheelhouse right now, you know what I mean?
4161000	4164000	It might not just be what another person's looking to do at this time.
4164000	4169000	Sometimes the measure of success is not just copying what everybody else is doing.
4169000	4172000	Even though the gaming industry tends to do that a lot.
4172000	4174000	So, anyway, what are you smirking about?
4174000	4176000	Bobby, where's our battle royale game?
4176000	4178000	What the hell?
4181000	4185000	Let's see. As soon as Matt's like, Bobby's like, pay me.
4187000	4191000	Poor chat. You leave Bobby alone. He's trying to do his own damn show.
4191000	4193000	So, anyway.
4194000	4198000	Okay. I guess we'll move on. I guess we ran out of steam on that topic.
4198000	4205000	So, let's talk about Axiom Verge being the free game on the Epic Storefront right now.
4205000	4212000	So, Epic Games Store had Axiom Verge as the free game and apparently it was broken for a hot minute.
4212000	4215000	Now, I was gone this weekend, so I didn't get to get it until today and I think it's already fixed.
4215000	4222000	But here's the irony. The Epic Games version was broken because of something about steam.
4222000	4226000	But it's not totally what you think. Here's the deal.
4226000	4231000	So, some tweets started going out to Epic and developer Tom Happ who made Axiom Verge.
4231000	4237000	Because, you know, despite however you might feel about Axiom Verge, it's pretty fucking impressive that one person did that whole game.
4237000	4242000	Soundtrack, design, art, like everything. So, props to Tom because that game is pretty awesome.
4242000	4245000	So, anyway. Then Tom Happ put out a tweet.
4245000	4253000	For anyone missing steam.xmb from the Epic Store, please go to AV in your library, click the gear icon, verify, then update.
4253000	4260000	I was thinking, it being Epic and all, I shouldn't include Valve's DLLs and such.
4260000	4264000	So, I excluded all files with steam in the name. Oops.
4264000	4271000	And what happened is that when you would go into one room that had these steam pipes, they made a sound effect.
4271000	4278000	And the sound file was called steam something something. Well, he deleted that file. So, guess what made the game crash?
4278000	4286000	So, in his effort to, oh, I gotta scrub all the references to steam. No, no, but this was actual steam.
4287000	4290000	I'm simplifying it greatly.
4290000	4297000	He was just giving you, you know, a brief emulation of how some games work on steam.
4297000	4301000	Whereas they don't because they're broken and there's no quality control.
4301000	4306000	And at the end of the day, it was free. So, you can't complain about that much.
4306000	4311000	And it's one of those things, you know, you gotta love it or hate it. I know people have feelings on the Epic Store.
4311000	4321000	It's free free. Not like sign up for a subscription and get a free game every two, no, it's just sign up for the free store account.
4321000	4326000	Which, granted, means you're gonna get spam email, but everybody has a pocket email address.
4326000	4328000	All their spam email goes to. Come on.
4328000	4329000	That's all of them.
4329000	4333000	And people sign up for it and get the free game.
4333000	4336000	I was trying to see if I already have this game. I think I have it somewhere.
4336000	4341000	You might have it in Steam or you might have it on, I think it was a free game on PlayStation Plus at one point.
4341000	4342000	Yeah.
4342000	4343000	So, I think a lot of people have it on PlayStation Plus.
4343000	4345000	I'm surprised they don't have it on Steam.
4345000	4350000	It's a really, I mean, obviously it's heavily inspired by Super Metroid, but it's not a copy either.
4350000	4356000	Like a lot of the, you know, like power ups and things you use to get through the game are very different.
4356000	4364000	So, but I would, I mean, if you haven't played Axiom Verge, there's no better time than the present because you have that free one on PC.
4364000	4365000	So, I would say check it out.
4365000	4367000	Frodo's Wagon says, what's the game about?
4367000	4373000	I actually have a hard time remembering the story. I think it's one of those you wake up and you're not sure what's going on type of thing.
4373000	4375000	But you're obviously like you're in an alien landscape.
4375000	4377000	And I remember there's things about hacking.
4377000	4383000	A lot of hacking comes in because you like end up like hacking walls to make new walls and you actually like glitch things out.
4383000	4385000	And that's an intended part of the game mechanic.
4385000	4388000	So, but it's all like 2D Super Metroid style.
4389000	4398000	So, that's, that's more the way I've tried to like explain the game to other people is it's, oh, it's Super Metroid, but like different power ups, different kind of mechanic.
4398000	4401000	But at the end of the day, you know, it's that same type of setup.
4401000	4403000	I see you going to the Epic Store and getting it right now.
4403000	4406000	Well, it expires on the 21st. I just want to make sure I don't forget.
4406000	4408000	Might as well, right? Of course.
4408000	4410000	All right.
4411000	4415000	Metal Mayhem says Origin was giving out games left and right for a while, remember?
4415000	4418000	But then again, compared to Steam, Origin is the redheaded stepchild.
4418000	4421000	So, well, interestingly enough, did they stop giving out?
4421000	4424000	I mean, they were only EA games because EA is Origin.
4424000	4425000	I don't know.
4425000	4426000	Did they stop? I don't remember.
4426000	4434000	But, well, if you think about it, though, this Apex Legends is free and it's a pretty high quality game.
4434000	4439000	You know, it's obviously got the loot box mechanics and other types of pay mechanics in there.
4439000	4442000	But for the most part, you get a pretty rich experience for free.
4442000	4446000	So maybe that's just the direction they've decided to go in at this point.
4446000	4447000	I don't know.
4447000	4450000	Anyway, let's move on. Loki, let's get to your story.
4450000	4451000	All right.
4451000	4456000	So, Microsoft is basically...
4456000	4460000	Sorry, quickly, Pixel Pacas does say, I think Origin did stop their free game a month ago.
4460000	4462000	They probably ran out of games to give away, honestly.
4462000	4463000	Yeah.
4463000	4467000	So Microsoft's making a slight rebrand of their game studio.
4467000	4472000	So instead of Microsoft Studios now making your favorite games on the Microsoft platforms,
4472000	4479000	you can look forward to Xbox Game Studios as making those games on that platform.
4479000	4486000	So they're rebranding and they have all those different studios, which we still don't know what the fuck they're making.
4486000	4487000	But there's a lot of studios that are...
4487000	4488000	Yes, we do.
4488000	4490000	We know they're making things for the next console.
4490000	4491000	That's what they're making.
4491000	4493000	But what things for the next console?
4493000	4496000	Wait till June and find out. A few of them.
4496000	4497000	I don't want to wait.
4497000	4499000	Typical gamer.
4499000	4501000	As far as the rename goes, what do you think?
4501000	4503000	I think this is a big deal.
4503000	4505000	I think nobody cares.
4505000	4510000	The average consumer does not care about what title is on their splash screen.
4510000	4518000	Yeah, basically their excuse is, well, Microsoft Studios stands at 13 distinct and diverse game development teams.
4518000	4524000	And with this new rebranding, they're going to be organized under one letter.
4524000	4526000	Okay, yay for reorganization.
4526000	4534000	But I think at the end of the day also, I think this has a lot to do with maybe Microsoft really wanting Xbox to be synonymous with gaming,
4534000	4537000	especially when it comes to like PC and their actual boxes.
4537000	4540000	Oh yeah, because they're going to be doing the Xbox stuff from PC.
4540000	4541000	Right, exactly.
4541000	4548000	So I think this is more about a shift to getting you to think like when you think Xbox, you think games, which is what they want to do.
4548000	4554000	And they want to leverage their dominance in the operating system industry to kind of do that a little bit.
4554000	4556000	And I think that's what this is really all about.
4556000	4563000	But otherwise for them, I mean, this is and this is also like I'm really kind of like diving into the whole like brands and what does it mean?
4563000	4564000	And, you know, the whole stuff.
4564000	4568000	But I think for the average consumer, it's like, eh, just sell me a good game.
4568000	4570000	Is Crackdown 3 going to be good or not?
4570000	4572000	That's that's what the average consumer cares about.
4572000	4577000	So anyway. All right, moving on.
4577000	4584000	Let's talk about a kind of a surprise release of a very old game on the Nintendo Switch.
4584000	4591000	And I actually noticed this, too, going into the store because I was trying to look at some of the other games that have released recently,
4591000	4597000	which, by the way, shout out to the game Tangledeep, because remember, we had that guy on OLR that made that game.
4597000	4599000	God, it was probably about two years ago or whatever.
4599000	4602000	I think they were doing a Kickstarter for the publishing at the time.
4602000	4605000	Yeah. I don't like to get a lot of Kickstarters on OLR anymore.
4605000	4613000	And I think I think in general, less people are doing them because so many of the Kickstarter projects like where is Bloodstained still?
4613000	4617000	I mean, yes, we have the the eight bit inspired version, but I mean, we're still waiting on that.
4617000	4625000	But anyway, my point is, I don't usually like to get Kickstarters here anymore unless it is like for the publishing costs or like you already have a game ready to go.
4625000	4627000	You just need a little help getting it out the door.
4627000	4631000	But anyway, that was we had them on the show and they're out on the Switch store.
4631000	4633000	So there they were on the store this week. So I saw that.
4633000	4641000	But anyway, but what I also wanted to shout out was that I also noticed Commander Keen and I was like, what?
4641000	4643000	Did they reboot Commander Keen?
4643000	4645000	I don't remember talking about this on OLR.
4645000	4648000	This would have caught my eye that they're like remaking Commander Keen for the Switch.
4649000	4659000	No, no, this this was a surprise release of Commander Keen in Keen Dreams, which I don't think was the original series.
4659000	4661000	I think it was one of the later ones.
4661000	4667000	If I remember, I'm trying to remember. Keen Dreams, I think, came a little later, but it was, you know, it was a little bit more platformer on PC.
4667000	4670000	But here's the thing about it. Is it a remaster for the Switch?
4670000	4677000	No, it's the PC game in all of its VGA graphic glory.
4677000	4681000	Oh, VGA. I'm sure that looks more like EGA to me.
4681000	4685000	Well, yeah, but I mean, that's that is literally it. That's what you're paying for.
4685000	4687000	The actual original game.
4689000	4695000	But I did think it was kind of neat. I was like, wow, this like old school 90s PC game is just all of a sudden on the Switch.
4695000	4701000	That's kind of cool. But then I'm like, wow, if this sells well, I mean, unleash the hounds.
4701000	4704000	We're going to have all sorts of like 90s retro things.
4704000	4708000	ZZT for Switch. Hell, yeah.
4708000	4712000	But OK, why not? Why not? The original Duke Nukem or Jill of the Jungle?
4712000	4716000	Yeah. Jazz Jackrabbit.
4716000	4720000	Oh, my gosh. Anyway, but I thought that was kind of neat.
4720000	4725000	I don't know. That should be like the like, you know, how they have the Sonic racing game.
4725000	4729000	They should have Jazz Jackrabbit as the character, because why not? Why not?
4729000	4733000	Danica Patrick. Why not? They should do an Apogee racing game.
4733000	4736000	I kind of don't think that's going to happen anyway.
4736000	4739000	So I thought that was like kind of like a nice little surprise release on the switch this week.
4739000	4743000	So, hey, if you're into the old classic 90s games, go check it out.
4743000	4748000	Also, an interesting little thing, because I bet a lot of people like if you're downloading and playing that game today,
4748000	4754000	you're probably experiencing it through like abandonware where people have made up this law that says,
4754000	4759000	oh, they don't sell game. If they haven't sold a game in a year, you can just pirate it for free.
4759000	4761000	I don't know what they made up with that whole thing.
4761000	4765000	But it's like this kind of proves that they don't necessarily want you to do that,
4765000	4771000	because they may still like whoever owns the rights to the game may want to put it out on a new console or what have you.
4771000	4779000	So anyway. All right. Let's move on to let's move on to some other classic games
4779000	4783000	in a regular segment that we do here called the Classic Game of the Week.
4783000	4791000	And so we venture through the portal of time and space, the portal labeled Radio Magic,
4791000	4797000	and visit the Classic Game of the Week, where we are joined by the one and only Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.
4797000	4799000	Oh, hi.
4799000	4800000	Hi, how are you?
4800000	4802000	I'm OK. How are you?
4802000	4810000	I am good. It is nice to have you here once again, even if by phone and even if graciously while you're on a break from your work.
4810000	4812000	But it's always good to have you here on the show.
4812000	4816000	And I know you're going to be back full time very, very soon. So very happy to have it.
4816000	4819000	And there may even be a surprise before that.
4819000	4825000	Oh, can't wait. Well, anyway, no surprise here, because we've done this segment for a very, very, very long time.
4825000	4829000	It's the Classic Game of the Week where you're going to jump into the gaming vault and find a game that,
4829000	4834000	hey, these kids should be checking out this game this week. What did you pick?
4834000	4838000	This literally will not fit in my vault right now, but maybe my garage.
4838000	4841000	Excuse me. It's Alpine Racer.
4841000	4848000	It was a 3D skiing game that came out by Namco in 1994.
4848000	4852000	I played a lot more of the sequels in this than starting at the beginning.
4852000	4858000	Basically, the very first game really just had three courses and two modes.
4858000	4864000	It was you would either do downhill or gate racing and then you had the three courses for each.
4864000	4867000	And then you had race and time attack.
4867000	4876000	So you actually stood on a set of like skis that would move and you held on to the stability bars to play.
4876000	4881000	And believe it or not, it actually came out in North America first.
4881000	4887000	It came out September 11th, 1994. And then in Japan, it came out in June 1995.
4887000	4899000	It was on Namco's system, 22 arcade systems, which the other stuff that came out on it was, let's see, Ridge Racer.
4899000	4907000	The other stuff that came out on it was, let's see what else, Time Crisis,
4907000	4914000	Air Combat 22, Dirt Dash, Rave Racer, Tokyo Wars, Prop Cycle.
4914000	4919000	So there were, you know, that puts things in perspective for people.
4919000	4925000	But as far as the game itself, it did get a sequel called Alpine Racer 2 that also ran on system 22 software.
4925000	4928000	It had three different skiers that you could choose.
4928000	4933000	And then you could play two players simultaneously with two cabinets linked.
4933000	4938000	And then, of course, there was a sequel to that, Alpine Racer 3, which came out on the PS2.
4938000	4944000	And then they made a remake for the iPhone and iPod Touch and it was ported to whatever the Zeebo is.
4944000	4946000	I have to see what a Zeebo is.
4946000	4950000	3D enabled entertainment and education system from Zeebo Inc.
4950000	4952000	Oooh, okay, whatever that is.
4952000	4956000	So that's the sequel.
4956000	4960000	It actually had another sequel to the game.
4960000	4966000	It came out in 2013 called Super Alpine Racer by Bondi Namco Games.
4966000	4974000	As for its production, it was actually considered to be one of the best and most unique and realistic games of its time for its controls.
4974000	4978000	It gave five out of five stars to Next Generation Magazine for, quote,
4978000	4981000	a typical approach in its success and execution.
4981000	4987000	And then it won best new equipment at the 1995 New Music Operators Association Expo.
4987000	4996000	This was, I think, one of those big games that really got racing games sort of out of the car and onto your feet.
4996000	5001000	Yeah, I remember, didn't they have one of these at Golf Land back in the day when we were discovered DDR?
5001000	5005000	Like, I feel like I remember there being a big, like, skiing thing.
5005000	5009000	They had an Alpine Racer 2, which is like the one that they looked up.
5009000	5011000	Gotcha. Okay, so close enough, close enough.
5011000	5016000	And yeah, you're right about the complicated setup, meaning that probably not a ton, a ton of people.
5016000	5019000	I mean, you know, if you had a big arcade near you, you probably saw this game.
5019000	5024000	But there is an extremely limited amount of footage of this game out there online,
5024000	5027000	at least things that are ripped directly from the video feed.
5027000	5031000	I mean, there's some, like, over the shoulder video that's not as glamorous to look at,
5031000	5033000	just because, you know, there's a lot of background noise and stuff.
5033000	5038000	But I'm really having to rely on the PlayStation sequel to give us some footage tonight,
5038000	5040000	just because the original was pretty limited.
5040000	5043000	I think this game probably is better known for the sequels.
5043000	5047000	Well, the other thing about, though, especially with Alpine Racer 2,
5047000	5051000	it actually was involved in a sleep study with Tetris.
5051000	5056000	It was used by a Harvard sleep scientist named Robert Stickle
5056000	5058000	to study the relationship between learning and sleep.
5058000	5063000	He found that after playing the game for hours before going to sleep,
5063000	5070000	subjects suffering from interrogate amnesia, which is the inability to form new memories,
5070000	5072000	would dream about skiing.
5073000	5077000	Huh. I wonder if that's, well, I don't think it's the same study,
5077000	5082000	but it's interesting to note that, you know, the recent release Tetris Effect was that whole thing.
5082000	5084000	The Tetris Effect was named after a study.
5084000	5086000	I know I'm deviating from what this game is,
5086000	5091000	but it is interesting how video games used in studies really kind of, you know,
5091000	5093000	kind of show us a little something about ourselves.
5093000	5095000	Yeah, for sure.
5096000	5102000	So, I mean, basically, I think that a lot of, you know,
5102000	5109000	anything that we do that stimulates the brain and leads to, you know,
5109000	5113000	leads to something that's going to have an impact on what you've done in your day
5113000	5115000	would still bring in that same sort of thing.
5115000	5117000	I had the same thing happen with DDR.
5117000	5121000	That's actually how I learned not to, you know, go back to the center every time,
5121000	5124000	is I dreamed of myself playing without going back to the center,
5124000	5126000	and after that, I never had any problems with DDR.
5126000	5128000	Huh, interesting.
5128000	5131000	Interesting how dreams can impact real life like that.
5131000	5132000	Well...
5132000	5135000	I miss SpeedCuber's dream about Rubik's Cube algorithms.
5135000	5139000	Well, I don't know if there's much more to say about Alpine Racer,
5139000	5141000	so there it is, your classic game of the week.
5141000	5142000	Alpine Racer!
5142000	5144000	Yay!
5144000	5147000	Just because we didn't have a lot to say on it this week compared to some of the other previous weeks
5147000	5149000	doesn't mean it's not an important game,
5149000	5151000	because obviously, you know, you have the sequels,
5151000	5154000	but it looked great for its time, as you kind of mentioned.
5154000	5157000	Like, it really was kind of ahead of its time in its way.
5157000	5161000	And in some ways, I don't know, it's similar.
5161000	5164000	Obviously, you have, like, Ridge Racer, and you have Alpine Racers.
5164000	5167000	There's kind of, like, some similarities there, but there's some things even I don't know.
5167000	5168000	It was all Namco.
5168000	5169000	Yeah, yeah, exactly. Why not?
5169000	5173000	They probably were, had a lot of stuff in common kind of at its core,
5173000	5175000	but yeah, a lot that I really enjoyed.
5175000	5176000	They ran under the same equipment.
5176000	5177000	Yeah.
5177000	5180000	So, well, I know that was a little short,
5180000	5182000	but we'll get back to the show here in just a moment.
5182000	5185000	But quickly, I thought I'd just kind of see, like, how have you been?
5185000	5188000	What kind of games have you been playing this week
5188000	5191000	while you unfortunately haven't been with us on OLR?
5191000	5195000	Still Resident Evil 2, you know? Shoot them in the head, shoot them in the head.
5195000	5199000	I'm so absolutely into this game for more of its graphical things now
5199000	5203000	and noticing, like, the Easter eggs and background detail.
5203000	5206000	But this is going to sound completely disgusting.
5206000	5208000	I don't know if I've talked about it before.
5208000	5212000	I'm really pleased with how they've rendered anatomy
5212000	5216000	because, um, what you do with the zombies.
5216000	5219000	I think you did mention a little bit of this when you did the original Resident Evil
5219000	5221000	a couple weeks ago as your classic game,
5221000	5223000	because you kind of talked about how this new one, you were like,
5223000	5225000	wow, the kills are very real.
5225000	5228000	Well, it's not really just a matter of that.
5228000	5232000	It's just that, you know, they are, depending on the bullet you use,
5232000	5235000	you know, you have the effects on the body.
5235000	5238000	I do miss the mags. I'm completely blown to head wide open.
5238000	5240000	But, you know, it's still pretty fun.
5240000	5244000	And just, like, those little details to me make the game live a little bit more.
5244000	5247000	And the voice acting is tremendously amazing.
5247000	5251000	Okay. Well, Jamie, it's great to talk to you as always
5251000	5254000	and hope to see you back here real, real soon.
5254000	5257000	Any parting thoughts or parting words for our listeners this week?
5257000	5260000	I've discovered that we have a jolly bee in town
5260000	5262000	and I've eaten there twice in the last three days.
5262000	5264000	It's good stuff and I don't blame her.
5264000	5266000	Anyway, we are back in studio.
5266000	5267000	What'd she say was in town?
5267000	5268000	Jolly bee.
5268000	5269000	What's that?
5269000	5273000	It's like a fast food chain, but I think its roots are in Filipino related food.
5273000	5274000	So, yeah.
5274000	5275000	Cool.
5275000	5276000	So, anyway, we're back.
5276000	5280000	Hi. Live in studio with our show already in progress.
5280000	5285000	Episode number 763 for tonight, February the 10th of 2019.
5285000	5290000	Welcome to all those of you that are watching us live at twitch.tv slash vog network on Sunday night.
5290000	5294000	And, of course, those that are listening along on our podcast feed as well.
5294000	5297000	We're going to get back into our show here with some rapid fire news.
5297000	5301000	Actually, real quick, though, I skipped something I was going to talk about earlier in the show.
5301000	5305000	I accidentally did this, but I think you kind of touched on this a little bit as well.
5305000	5308000	But the story I was going to talk about was Battlefield 5
5308000	5311000	and the hopes for how well that was going to sell in this whole thing.
5311000	5313000	I was supposed to talk about that when I talked about the Apex Legends and everything.
5313000	5319000	But, apparently, Battlefield 5 did not sell as well as EA had hoped it would.
5319000	5324000	The lowered outlook for revenue in the quarter is what EA did,
5324000	5328000	saying that the sales last quarter 2018 did not perform to their expectations.
5328000	5334000	They didn't really say what it was, but that was their big flagship game was Battlefield 5.
5334000	5338000	And you remember this game got delayed.
5338000	5341000	And so it was supposed to originally, I think, be in the spring.
5341000	5343000	And then it ended up getting pushed back a little bit.
5343000	5347000	So kind of had some problems getting out there from the get-go.
5347000	5350000	Obviously, they have some good news now with everything that's going on with Apex Legends.
5350000	5353000	And I think some of their stock and that sort of thing is recovered a little bit.
5353000	5355000	So that's good, right?
5355000	5356000	Yeah.
5356000	5358000	Anyway, now let's get in. Sorry, I missed that earlier.
5358000	5360000	I was going to bring that up when we talked about EA
5360000	5362000	and how they've been coming and going.
5362000	5365000	But let's get into some other rapid-fire news here, Loki.
5365000	5371000	So, with Crackdown 3 right around the corner, you may want to play some Crackdown.
5371000	5379000	So to be able to do that, Microsoft has made the original Crackdown free for everyone to download and play.
5379000	5383000	So it's actually available through the Xbox One through backwards compatibility
5383000	5385000	because it wasn't originally in the 360 title.
5385000	5388000	And you can go ahead and get it for free.
5388000	5395000	I already got it for free the last time they had it available for free, which is around Crackdown 2.
5395000	5397000	I don't know. It was a while ago, but I have it already.
5397000	5400000	But it's awesome, and you should go check it out.
5400000	5403000	And it's free, so you can't be free.
5403000	5409000	And then, of course, there's the movies and everything.
5409000	5413000	So I'm still waiting for my Sonic the Hedgehog trailer already.
5413000	5418000	We saw a poster for it when I went to the movies yesterday to see the Lego Movie 2.
5418000	5424000	But a movie that is still in the works is the Super Mario Bros. movie.
5424000	5428000	And, of course, the Mario movie is going to be done by Illumination.
5428000	5433000	Though it's not expected to be released any time soon, though.
5433000	5438000	It's going to be released likely sometime in 2022.
5438000	5440000	That's a little wait.
5440000	5442000	So got a bit of a wait for that.
5442000	5447000	We'll probably forget that there is even a Super Mario Bros. movie by then.
5447000	5451000	But yeah, so you'll just have to wait.
5451000	5456000	And instead you're just going to have to do what Sega is going to do when Nintendon't.
5456000	5462000	And that's release a movie that's live action with Sonic the Hedgehog.
5462000	5465000	And oh god, it's going to be terrible.
5465000	5468000	But I am totally seeing it because Jim Carrey is in it.
5468000	5471000	Alright, let me get into some news as well.
5471000	5475000	So the next Nintendo Switch Online titles have been revealed.
5475000	5480000	So we're going to be getting Super Mario Bros. 2 and Kirby's Adventure
5480000	5483000	will be the games that we're going to be getting on Switch Online this month.
5483000	5486000	So, I mean, those are both pretty huge titles.
5486000	5489000	I think a lot of people knew Mario 2 especially was an inevitability.
5489000	5491000	It was just a matter of when.
5491000	5495000	So the answer is this week, February 13th, I believe was the day those were getting added.
5495000	5498000	So only two games for us.
5498000	5501000	That's because Japan, again, getting the third game.
5501000	5504000	So they're getting a game, and I'm sorry, guys, I forget the original title of the game,
5504000	5507000	but it's a sumo wrestling game that we never, because, you know,
5507000	5509000	sumo wrestling isn't quite as big here.
5509000	5513000	But it was a Tecmo-related sumo wrestling game that they're getting as well.
5513000	5515000	So that's the third game.
5515000	5517000	But what's interesting, they're getting Super Mario 2.
5517000	5520000	Now, a lot of people would think, oh, does that mean they're getting Doki Doki Panic?
5520000	5524000	No, no, no. They're getting Super Mario USA,
5524000	5530000	which, if you didn't already know, when Super Mario Bros. 2 was released in Japan,
5530000	5535000	R Mario 2 was released in Japan, they rebranded it as Super Mario USA.
5535000	5537000	Because they already had a Super Mario Bros. 2.
5537000	5538000	They did.
5538000	5541000	Which was our lost levels. Are you confused yet?
5541000	5545000	Well, that's how things were complicated before the internet existed.
5545000	5549000	Which doesn't make any sense, because they thought it was going to be too hard for, like, people to play it, I guess,
5549000	5551000	was originally the thought.
5551000	5557000	And to my recollection, we're in all games really hard back then anyways,
5557000	5561000	so what would be the point if it was just a little bit harder?
5561000	5566000	You would just get used to it, because that's, it's just like, that's what games are, they're hard.
5566000	5570000	It's also interesting to me that they released Super Mario USA in Japan,
5570000	5573000	when it was all based off Doki Doki Panic anyway.
5573000	5580000	So, Japan had Doki Doki Panic, but, and here's, I think, the reason why they did not get Doki Doki Panic on their thing,
5580000	5584000	remember, that whole thing was an agreement with, like, Fuji Television?
5584000	5585000	Yeah.
5585000	5588000	And so, the licenses are probably impossible to get renewed and so forth,
5588000	5592000	so that's, like, the closest they could do was to give Mario USA,
5592000	5596000	which, I don't know, maybe more people in Japan, that's what they actually played, maybe.
5596000	5602000	I don't know what the sales of those two games were like, but I have a feeling Mario USA probably actually sold better
5602000	5606000	than the original Doki Doki Panic did, so, no. Anyway.
5606000	5612000	Metal Mayhem in our chat says, too hard? Motherfucker, have you not played an NES game ever?
5612000	5615000	Um, hello? Basically, like, a lot of the classic NES games.
5615000	5618000	Yeah, exactly. Like, all of the games.
5618000	5624000	Anyway, I am excited for Mario 2 on Switch, even though I know you're kind of over the Nintendo Online thing.
5624000	5628000	Also, interesting to note, those are really primarily single-player games.
5628000	5632000	I mean, I guess the sumo wrestling game is a little more head-to-head, but we're not getting that here.
5632000	5637000	But Mario 2 and Kirby, I mean, but Nintendo Switch Online, the whole thing is, like, sharing with other people, but...
5637000	5640000	But isn't it, like, don't you take turns, though, and...
5640000	5644000	I don't think Mario 2 even has... Oh, maybe Kirby does, but I don't even think... Mario 2...
5644000	5646000	No, Mario 2 was only one player, yeah.
5646000	5652000	I think Kirby was only really one player, too. I don't think it had a pass-the-controller type of mode on that, either, so...
5652000	5656000	Alright, moving on. Let's talk about Mortal Kombat 11.
5656000	5665000	So, still some more information trickling out about Mortal Kombat 11, including D'Vorah coming back from Mortal Kombat X, or X, into Mortal Kombat 11.
5665000	5669000	That's the one where it's not the bees, not the bees, she's the bee lady.
5669000	5671000	Well, I think they're, like, actually wasps or things like that.
5671000	5673000	You know those wasps are gonna eat someone's face off.
5673000	5677000	You know, I already know this thing's gonna have it, so people are excited about that.
5677000	5680000	Now we just need to get Nicolas Cage as a character.
5680000	5682000	And then it will be perfect.
5682000	5686000	Okay, you're starting to sound like the internet who wanted Shaggy as a character.
5686000	5688000	Where the fuck did that even come from, and why...
5688000	5690000	It's a meme, but I'm down.
5690000	5696000	Why is it on websites as, like, this is something we reported on, Shaggy is not in Mortal Kombat 11?
5697000	5702000	No shit. That was never, or should I say nether, in the realm of possibility.
5702000	5707000	Because, first off, Shaggy's a licensed character in a kid's cartoon show.
5707000	5711000	Just because the internet screams and whines and bakes or something doesn't mean they're gonna get it.
5711000	5713000	I guess once in a while they do, but they weren't gonna get this ever.
5713000	5718000	But Rob, they had Ninja Turtles in Infamous 2.
5720000	5722000	Well, also there wasn't...
5722000	5724000	Not Infamous 2, I'm sorry.
5724000	5725000	Injustice 2.
5725000	5729000	Also, there wasn't decapitations in Injustice 2, so it's a little different.
5731000	5732000	The bees...
5732000	5733000	I'm fine with him.
5733000	5737000	Can you imagine the horrors if the bees came out and chewed off his face?
5737000	5738000	Come on.
5738000	5740000	It would be awesome.
5740000	5741000	Lord, anyway.
5741000	5746000	So, I don't know, the internet's gonna internet, and Shaggy was a thing they internetted.
5746000	5750000	And NetherRealm came out and said, not gonna happen.
5750000	5756000	Also, it was announced, though, Cabal was also announced this week, which was actually a character I really enjoyed in Mortal Kombat 3.
5757000	5764000	Alan said, I'm waiting for you to get home because I want to make you watch the Cabal fatality that they showed during the livestream today.
5764000	5768000	So, I watched it, and I was just like...
5768000	5770000	This is my reaction.
5770000	5771000	Why?
5771000	5773000	This is excessive.
5773000	5774000	It's disgusting.
5774000	5775000	Anyway.
5775000	5777000	It's not excessive enough.
5778000	5783000	And Shad Leland's in our chat right now saying, Cabal's fatality was amazing to see when they showed it off.
5783000	5784000	Of course, y'all are sick.
5784000	5785000	Anyway.
5788000	5792000	Moving on, one more story for you guys in rapid fire news.
5792000	5794000	The Mega Man series apparently doing pretty good.
5794000	5802000	Capcom mentioning that the sales for Mega Man 11 and the Mega Man X Legacy Collection were both strong.
5802000	5806000	That was according to their latest financial briefing for the nine months ending December 31st.
5806000	5813000	So, apparently Mega Man 11 was a strong revival game, and it was probably good that they put it out on almost every system that is out there and available.
5813000	5815000	But, good job for Capcom.
5815000	5819000	And good job, yay for Mega Man, because this means Mega Man 12?
5819000	5820000	Probably.
5820000	5821000	Right?
5821000	5822000	I would think.
5822000	5828000	Yeah, and it also means that, you know, other games that are Mega Man-like don't have to have sequels.
5828000	5835000	Capcom also wanted to say Monster Hunter World was doing very well, and Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection was doing strongly.
5835000	5838000	And the Onimusha remaster, off to a good start.
5838000	5842000	Alright, Mega Man 12, who knows, maybe in the future.
5842000	5848000	For now, let's travel around the world and check out what's happening this week as we check out some world release dates, starting in the U.S., Loki.
5848000	5855000	So we've got The Liar Princess and The Blind Prince on the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.
5855000	5860000	Trials Rising on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
5860000	5863000	Of course, Crackdown 3 on PC and Xbox One.
5864000	5868000	Dreamworks, Dragons, Dawn of the New Riders on Nintendo Switch.
5868000	5873000	Far Cry New Dawn on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
5873000	5877000	Jump Force on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
5877000	5882000	And finally, Metro Exodus on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.
5882000	5887000	But that's the one that you can only buy on PC in one place, right?
5887000	5891000	Well, not, I mean, now you can only buy it.
5891000	5894000	Alright, that was the whole thing we got into last week a little bit.
5894000	5895000	Alright, anyway.
5895000	5899000	Going over to Japan and checking out the releases over there on the PlayStation 4 this week.
5899000	5902000	Catherine Full Body is out just in time for Valentine's Day.
5902000	5905000	Also, Jump Force is out on the PlayStation 4 in Japan this week.
5905000	5911000	Nobunaga's Ambition, Tashi, apparently some power-up kit, regular limited edition.
5911000	5914000	What the hell has that series become these days? I don't even know.
5914000	5918000	Anyway, it's still going on the PlayStation 4 and has a new one coming out this week.
5918000	5921000	There's also a full-body box version of Catherine.
5921000	5923000	Your guess is as good as mine would that mean?
5923000	5926000	Some collector's edition coming out in Japan as well.
5926000	5931000	There's also price reduction on the game Omega Labyrinth Z.
5931000	5933000	They added a new Catherine to that Catherine game.
5933000	5934000	Oh, really?
5934000	5936000	So now there's three Catharines.
5936000	5938000	Oh, all the Catharines.
5938000	5943000	And then quickly looking at Nintendo Switch, seeing if they have, they also have the Nobunaga Ambition game this week.
5943000	5945000	It's coming out in Japan.
5946000	5953000	Kinero no Corda Octave comes out in regular, something called a Treasure Box and a Blessed Party Box.
5953000	5955000	Like, there's a lot of editions of this game.
5955000	5958000	I'm trying to see if this is a series we have over here.
5960000	5968000	It looks like, it might be based off an anime or something because it looks like a group of, like, college or high school-aged kids that are all playing violin and trumpet and things like that.
5968000	5976000	So it's, it's not exactly Eternal Sonata. Remember that game on 3C? That was an underrated RPG.
5976000	5980000	It's not exactly Eternal Sonata, but it's definitely rooted in music and it's...
5980000	5981000	It looks like a...
5981000	5983000	It's got to be based off an anime. It's got to be.
5985000	5987000	It looks like it's just a visual novel.
5987000	5988000	Maybe.
5988000	5993000	All right. Well, there it is. Some more releases for you guys and what's coming up in stores this week.
5993000	5996000	So now we're going to get to the mailbag.
5996000	5998000	Nope. We're getting to the UK.
5998000	6000000	Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, we've got to get to the UK releases.
6000000	6003000	Exactly. Let's not jump to the mailbag.
6004000	6006000	Sorry. Sorry, UK. You don't count.
6007000	6009000	No, I'm just forgetful. Sorry.
6009000	6016000	So we've got Sid Meier's Civilization VI, Gathering Storm, out on PC.
6016000	6021000	Far Cry New Dawn on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and PC.
6022000	6025000	Jump Force on Xbox One and PlayStation 4.
6026000	6029000	Metro Exodus, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC.
6029000	6036000	And let's see, Legend of Heroes, Trials of Cold Steel on PlayStation 4.
6036000	6041000	And Crackdown 3 on Xbox One and PC.
6041000	6042000	That's it.
6042000	6048000	All right. Pixel Pacas, by the way, in our chat, clearing up a little bit on Kinetoro no Korda on this.
6048000	6050000	It is an Otome game.
6050000	6053000	A dating sim where a lady dates guys.
6053000	6054000	Cool.
6054000	6056000	Representation, huh?
6057000	6058000	Got to have it. All right.
6058000	6061000	Anyway, let's move on and go to the mailbag.
6061000	6063000	Every week you guys e-mail us.
6063000	6067000	Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and we read your e-mails here on the show.
6067000	6070000	So let's get to our first e-mail tonight from Robert M.
6070000	6072000	who starts us off saying,
6072000	6076000	Interesting to hear about the Nintendo partnership with Line for Dr. Mario.
6076000	6080000	I do know the service dropped the Skullgirls mobile app and Cookie Run,
6080000	6082000	which went on to other publishers.
6082000	6084000	Disney Tsum Tsum is still with Line.
6084000	6087000	Hopefully the game, if it's well designed and probably would be,
6087000	6090000	considerably outlasts Puzzle Fighter.
6090000	6094000	Or, I mean, honestly, Robert M., some of Nintendo's other games.
6094000	6096000	I mean, Miitomo didn't exactly last a long time.
6096000	6100000	So, yeah, hopefully Dr. Mario has the Steam to last a little while.
6100000	6102000	So there it is. That was the e-mail from Robert M.
6102000	6104000	So are we talking about like the new puzzle?
6104000	6106000	Didn't they do like a new Puzzle Fighter that was kind of crap?
6106000	6111000	Yeah, there was like a whole new Puzzle Fighter that came out on mobile and about as fast as it came out, it went away.
6111000	6113000	They pulled it like really fast.
6113000	6117000	Which, by the way, speaking of stuff they pulled, oh, my gosh, Alan, Alan, Alan,
6117000	6119000	are you dressed to be on the show?
6119000	6121000	Alan, come here, come here.
6121000	6123000	I'm sorry, guys, I'm making Alan make a cameo.
6123000	6125000	Okay, hi, Alan.
6125000	6126000	Hello.
6126000	6128000	Sorry to make you pull you away from whatever else you're doing.
6131000	6134000	Come sit on the couch. Come sit on the edge of the couch.
6134000	6136000	All right, here, hold this. There.
6136000	6138000	Perfect.
6138000	6143000	So let's talk about, I want to talk about like mobile games that go away too soon.
6143000	6148000	So you've been playing this match three game. What happened?
6148000	6150000	Tell us what game and what's going on.
6150000	6155000	It was a game that I actually started playing when it came out in Japan a whole year before it came out in the US.
6155000	6161000	I had to get like a little app that lets you use the Google Play store, the Japanese one.
6161000	6163000	So I was very into this game.
6163000	6166000	Sailor Moon Drops posted on their Facebook.
6166000	6168000	We're closing.
6168000	6172000	Okay, it's fun.
6172000	6176000	I like collecting all the weird characters like Alan, the boy from the arcade or whatever.
6176000	6179000	I don't understand it.
6179000	6182000	And no reason given, just bye.
6182000	6185000	This isn't working out for us, so see you later.
6185000	6186000	Yeah.
6186000	6188000	All right, go tend to Mr. Samos.
6188000	6190000	She's trying to get into something over there in the kitchen.
6190000	6191000	He's playing with his toy.
6191000	6194000	Thank you for letting us drag you on the show just like that.
6194000	6195000	Appreciate it.
6195000	6196000	All right.
6196000	6200000	Unfortunately, poor Litten took a nosedive there. That's all right.
6200000	6202000	Bobby Black Wolf says, Alan just hipstered us.
6202000	6204000	Alan's like, I played it before it was cool.
6204000	6207000	And DJ Rama S says, I'm still salty about that.
6207000	6210000	There's a petition going around to keep it alive.
6210000	6213000	And Pixel pockets is complimenting your t-shirt.
6213000	6214000	Just so we're clear.
6214000	6215000	All right.
6215000	6217000	Anyway, moving on.
6217000	6220000	Let's get to our next email in the mailbag tonight.
6220000	6222000	And again, if you want to email us some week,
6222000	6224000	participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com.
6224000	6227000	Our last email tonight from Frodo Swagons.
6227000	6229000	Hey, OLR, Frodo Swagons here.
6229000	6236000	If you are forced to choose only one game to play for the rest of your life,
6236000	6239000	life, life, life, what would that game be?
6239000	6242000	Could even be a game that has not come out yet.
6242000	6244000	Yet another short and sweet email.
6244000	6245000	Haha, love the show as always.
6245000	6246000	Take care.
6246000	6247000	Hey, we love the short emails.
6247000	6249000	We'll read the long emails too.
6249000	6251000	Although we may have to cut some things for time.
6251000	6252000	But yeah, please email us.
6252000	6254000	Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com.
6254000	6256000	Now on to the question.
6256000	6258000	You get to play one game for the rest of your life.
6258000	6260000	What game is it going to be?
6262000	6263000	That's tough.
6266000	6267000	I don't know.
6267000	6269000	Maybe I would get bored with it.
6269000	6272000	But we'll pick ZZT.
6273000	6275000	Because you can make an infinite amount of games.
6275000	6277000	Make other games than the game.
6277000	6280000	Yes, actually I'm going to go for a similar answer.
6280000	6283000	You might think that I would say an MMO, which is a good answer.
6283000	6287000	I could say WoW or Final Fantasy XIV, which I think are really good answers.
6287000	6292000	But yeah, I think this whole how do you trick this question and wish for more wishes
6292000	6297000	is to answer this with LittleBigPlanet would be the game that I would want to play.
6297000	6303000	Because there's infinite amounts of games still out there within LittleBigPlanet to be discovered.
6303000	6309000	Honestly, this whole Dreams thing, which I'm hearing more and more about.
6309000	6312000	And it sounds like people are recreating full-on other games in Dreams.
6312000	6316000	Did you see the Everything's Fine meme that they recreated in Dreams?
6316000	6319000	No, I didn't see that. No, that sounds funny.
6319000	6321000	But yeah, it sounds like Dreams.
6321000	6326000	So if you talk about I can use upcoming games, I bet that might be a good candidate
6326000	6330000	for an upcoming game that I would use to wish for more wishes.
6330000	6332000	Which is exactly what I'm doing with this answer.
6332000	6335000	Sorry. I mean, I can always say the Guardian Legend.
6335000	6337000	I mean, that's a really good pick, too.
6337000	6339000	But you get bored with it after a while.
6339000	6343000	Would I? I don't know. I don't know about that.
6343000	6348000	All right. Let's see. I'm looking at chat, some of the answers in our chat room.
6348000	6351000	OnlySonic says Roblox is kind of infinite.
6351000	6354000	You know, I know more and more people that are randomly playing that game.
6354000	6358000	I should say randomly. It seems like it's really big and like a casual gaming space
6358000	6360000	and with younger people as well.
6360000	6364000	You know, like I mentioned, my son's doing that Code Ninjas program now.
6364000	6366000	Did that start officially?
6366000	6371000	Yeah, he's done his official. He's paying for it and he's going to it.
6371000	6374000	It's getting deducted from a bank account. You better be doing it.
6374000	6380000	Eventually, though, he gets into, after like the second year into it,
6380000	6384000	they start doing Lua scripting for Roblox.
6384000	6388000	So they actually teach him how to make their own Roblox levels, which is pretty cool.
6390000	6393000	But right now they're doing Scratch and then after that they're doing JavaScript.
6393000	6398000	And the JavaScript part I thought was something to do with Minecraft, but it might not be.
6398000	6401000	I don't really know what exactly they do with JavaScript.
6401000	6408000	But I know that the Lua portion is with Roblox and actually creating levels for Roblox.
6408000	6410000	So that's something he wants to do.
6410000	6414000	But yeah, that's all he plays is like Roblox games.
6414000	6416000	So, I mean, there's a lot out there.
6416000	6419000	I don't know how much of it's good, but there's a lot of things you can do with it.
6419000	6423000	I'm reading some of the other answers in chat about what game to play for the rest of your life.
6423000	6427000	Sia Tabiri says, could it be a compiled game like the US release of Popolo Christ,
6427000	6429000	which was three Japanese games?
6429000	6434000	That's a good idea, too. Can I play one of those like 101 games in one NES carts?
6434000	6438000	Although a lot of those games were shit. Let's be real.
6438000	6441000	Super Mario All-Stars would be a good pick because that's really four games.
6441000	6442000	Mario Maker.
6442000	6445000	Yes, there you go. Mario Maker is a good choice, too.
6445000	6449000	Alright, good enough. That's enough answers for now.
6449000	6452000	Let's move on and get into...
6452000	6455000	Now we can... I'm sorry, we did the emails.
6455000	6457000	So again, participate at orangelauntrader.com.
6457000	6460000	It's the place where you can send us an email in the future and we hope you will.
6460000	6463000	But in the meantime, let's get back into some stories.
6463000	6465000	And Loki's going to get into the next story.
6465000	6470000	So we talked about franchises that Activision's burned into the ground.
6470000	6472000	One of those being Guitar Hero.
6472000	6478000	And Guitar Hero Live now is actually refunding people for December.
6478000	6482000	So Guitar Hero Live had this thing called Guitar Hero TV.
6482000	6487000	So instead of having like the normal DLC thing, you kind of had this subscription service that you paid for.
6487000	6491000	I think SingStar does something similar to that.
6491000	6497000	So you had this like streaming servicing to get the play along with the music and stuff that was in there.
6497000	6500000	But apparently they announced, of course, that they're going to be seizing the service.
6500000	6505000	But apparently not everybody has gotten the message.
6505000	6515000	And so anybody that bought the game in December will actually be getting a refund for the game.
6515000	6518000	So you probably have to like send in a receipt or some other proof of purchase.
6518000	6521000	They'll be getting a refund for the Guitar Hero TV if you paid for that service.
6521000	6522000	Oh, I see. Okay.
6522000	6526000	So you still have this stuff that's on disc, but you have to do that.
6526000	6531000	So apparently. Oh, no, actually, maybe you do get a refund for the games.
6531000	6535000	Yes, as publishers announced the season, but the news got out.
6535000	6543000	But for anybody that bought the game December this past year before Guitar Hero TV closed down on January 1st is entitled to refund for the game.
6543000	6547000	So it says you'll be left with the songs on the disc, but you get your money back.
6547000	6551000	So they have a claim form that you can go to.
6551000	6559000	So support that Activision's article slash and us slash facts slash guitar dash hero dash live.
6559000	6562000	I'm sure you're all right there right now.
6562000	6566000	I'm sure you can do what Google for heaven's sakes.
6566000	6572000	But you you have to show proof of purchase and then they will send you a gift card for your purchase price.
6572000	6576000	As Joe and Matt says, I think this refund is just to avoid the class action lawsuit.
6576000	6579000	Probably. Mm hmm. Boy, they can't win on that one, huh?
6579000	6583000	But yeah, you guys got to think about that when it comes to games to have like a really big online presence.
6583000	6587000	When you pull that plug, there's going to be some people that are really ticked off about the very least.
6587000	6591000	So with this guitar hero game, you're only losing a portion of the functionality of it.
6591000	6594000	There's still songs on this that you can play the same.
6594000	6599000	It can't be said for anthem when that goes down.
6599000	6605000	Or a number of Overwatch or who knows what else. All right, let's move on.
6605000	6610000	I want to talk about some tidbits from Final Fantasy 14 Fan Fest in Paris.
6610000	6616000	Some little tidbits about the game came out, including a crossover with Final Fantasy 15.
6616000	6620000	There is going to be a new mount that you will get in Final Fantasy 14.
6620000	6624000	It is the first four person mount in the game. Why?
6624000	6629000	Because they brought over the car. They brought over the regalia from Final Fantasy 15 as a mount in Final Fantasy 14.
6629000	6634000	So you can actually get that as a mount. And that actually in 14, that'll be really useful in some areas.
6634000	6641000	I'm thinking of the area Eureka, which you can really lose XP if you run into mobs.
6641000	6648000	And if somebody can ferry a bunch of people over from one area to another to get XP easier, I think it'll actually work out really well.
6648000	6650000	So anyway, yes, there is going to be a Final Fantasy 14.
6650000	6654000	Are they going to have Ubers now in the game? People charging a little bit of gil for it?
6654000	6659000	Port please, cross please. Anyway, who knows? Anything's possible.
6659000	6664000	Other stuff to come with that Final Fantasy 15 crossover, but also an interesting crossover.
6664000	6668000	They announced the next raid and who is designing it.
6668000	6674000	And basically the next 24 man raid and the next expansion is a Nier influenced raid.
6674000	6679000	So the creators of Nier are making, just like in this latest expansion, Stormblood,
6679000	6686000	the creators of Final Fantasy Tactics and Ivalice and 12 influenced the raid there.
6686000	6688000	They have the creators of Nier.
6688000	6692000	So how does that work with influencing? Do they have characters that appear in Nier?
6692000	6695000	They may. We don't know. We don't know the details yet.
6695000	6698000	So, I mean, I think we got the name and I forget the exact name.
6698000	6703000	It had a very Nier sounding name to it. So yeah, going to be very interesting.
6703000	6711000	There's that as well. They also officially confirmed the next class in the game.
6711000	6714000	I already forgot the name. Gunbreaker, I think was the name of it.
6714000	6720000	It's basically, it's the gun blade thing, but it's a tank so they can do like little shield things.
6720000	6722000	And so, yeah, it looks really cool in motion.
6722000	6727000	And as Shane says in our chat room, or excuse me, Shad Leland says in our chat room,
6727000	6732000	Rob, talk about how excited you were when they showed off male Viera. Oh, wait, you can't.
6732000	6736000	Yeah. So they officially announced that the Viera is going to be the next playable class
6736000	6741000	and only showed off female toons and female versions of the Viera.
6741000	6745000	There was no boy bunnies to be found, which is,
6745000	6749000	and don't you fucking pull that lore card on me because lore can be rewritten.
6749000	6753000	And remember in Final Fantasy 11, only female could be, what was it, Mithra in 11?
6753000	6756000	Mithra and Galkas were only male.
6756000	6761000	Well, in the original original Final Fantasy 14 release, that was the same way.
6761000	6764000	Only female could be Makoto, only male.
6764000	6768000	But then when Yoshida came in and they did Realm Reborn, they said, no, that's stupid.
6768000	6773000	And they did, they did male makote or whatever they're called in this game.
6773000	6777000	And they did female Rogadins, which are Galka in 11, basically.
6777000	6782000	So everybody's got the same gender. So why on earth they would now be like,
6782000	6787000	Viera is only going to be female is going to like really irritate me.
6787000	6789000	Because, yes, I wanted to be a bunny boy.
6789000	6794000	Now, they could just be waiting for Tokyo, like honest to God, it could just not be done yet.
6794000	6798000	As it sounds like there's a lot of things for the next expansion that just straight up aren't done.
6798000	6800000	And they're doing it by the seat of their pants.
6800000	6804000	So maybe they're going to wait and show them off in Tokyo, at least I hope that's the idea.
6804000	6809000	Because I have heard rumblings that they may, that the male Viera will actually be,
6809000	6814000	and this is rumor, that the male Viera will actually be the Ronso from Final Fantasy 10.
6814000	6817000	Do you remember Kilmari, the Blue Panther looking guy?
6817000	6824000	Oh, yeah. So that instead of Viera, you'll play the male character will be only Ronso's.
6824000	6826000	But I seem to remember there were female Ronso's.
6826000	6831000	So I don't know. I hope that's not true. I want a boy bunny.
6834000	6838000	Act F says female Viera is probably more appealing to you.
6841000	6845000	Just because they're boy bunnies doesn't mean they have to be scantily clad.
6846000	6854000	But let us not forget Final Fantasy 14 and on back to 11 is kind of infamous for its equal opportunity hoe armor.
6854000	6861000	Is that if you want to be a female and dress like a hoe, you have that opportunity just like you do in every other MMO.
6861000	6862000	But guess what?
6862000	6863000	Oh, is it the sublegar?
6863000	6869000	Yeah, if you want to be a male and dress like a hoe, just ask Shane to share screenshots of his characters because they're all hoes.
6870000	6874000	You can do that in Final Fantasy 14. You can absolutely do it.
6874000	6879000	Anyhow, did the sublegars make it over to 14 as well?
6879000	6884000	They have a version of it. Yeah, but they also have like they did like bathing suits at one point.
6884000	6887000	And they're just based like they're somehow smaller than Speedos.
6887000	6892000	Like it's it's like you're just you're running around and like not even like tighty whities, but like a thong or something.
6892000	6895000	It's pretty it's pretty not a lot.
6896000	6898000	The armor, of course, they all look like Ken dolls.
6898000	6902000	Are the armor buffs good on that kind of stuff or is it just like.
6902000	6904000	Well, here's the thing, because glamour, you're off.
6904000	6908000	You're asking a lot of questions, Logie, because glamour is a thing.
6908000	6916000	You can have like iron boots of plus 40 or whatever, and you glamour them into thong.
6916000	6918000	And that's fine. You get the stats of your iron thing.
6918000	6919000	Iron thong.
6919000	6922000	But it looks like an iron thong.
6922000	6925000	All right. Anyway, that's a little bit on.
6925000	6927000	Oh, actually, there's one other thing on 14 I wanted to say.
6927000	6929000	It's actually not specifically 14.
6929000	6936000	But again, a question that was asked to Naoki Yoshida at the Fan Fest that now people are kind of running with,
6936000	6940000	even though it's not directly about 14, because, you know, Yoshida,
6940000	6946000	I imagine he's a pretty popular guy within Square Enix because he did take this game that was a disaster
6946000	6950000	and has reinvented it into something that's very much playable in his success.
6950000	6956000	So there has been a lot of rumors that Yoshida may be tasked with the next Final Fantasy game.
6956000	6959000	And that's a big maybe, and I don't know. I don't know if that's true or not.
6959000	6964000	I would think what he's doing on Final Fantasy 14 is enough of an undertaking because he's director and producer.
6964000	6970000	But anyhow, he got asked about Final Fantasy 16.
6970000	6972000	So obviously they had to ask in a very roundabout way.
6972000	6976000	Well, first they asked him, is Nobui Matsu going to do the theme for Shadowbringers?
6976000	6979000	And he said, I don't have any info on that yet. I'm paraphrasing.
6979000	6982000	He didn't say, I'm not trying to be, but, you know, his health.
6982000	6985000	You remember Nobui Matsu took a break because of his health.
6985000	6987000	We reported on that some time ago.
6987000	6992000	And so basically Yoshida is saying, we just don't know if he's at a point where he can do that.
6992000	6995000	And he's also in demand for the Final Fantasy 7 remake.
6995000	6999000	So it's really one of those things of, if he can do it, great.
6999000	7001000	But if not, it may not happen.
7001000	7005000	And please respect that his health has been an issue for some time.
7005000	7010000	But then the other question he got asked about, for the future of online and Final Fantasy,
7010000	7016000	as a director, what kind of elements do you think Final Fantasy 16 and Final Fantasy 17 should offer?
7016000	7020000	And Naoki Yoshida was kind of blindsided by the question and then said,
7020000	7024000	first, if you're asking whether the Final Fantasy series will get another MMO soon,
7024000	7028000	I think the chances are unlikely so long as Final Fantasy 14 is doing well.
7028000	7034000	On that note, personally speaking, I'd like to see a Final Fantasy that is straightforward fantasy.
7034000	7038000	One that doesn't have much machinery and with no mecha in it.
7038000	7042000	After all, we're having trouble with the Garlean Empire being too powerful.
7042000	7043000	That's a joke about 14.
7043000	7045000	Okay, that was a bad joke and he laughed.
7045000	7048000	But a lot of people are kind of looking at what he said and going,
7048000	7052000	let him make it because that's what I want too.
7052000	7055000	I would like to see a Final Fantasy, me personally speaking.
7055000	7058000	I mean, the mech stuff that they've done has been fine.
7058000	7065000	I like a small mix. I like what they did with like 7 and 6.
7066000	7068000	6 is a good example.
7068000	7072000	Well, aesthetic-wise, I really liked what they did with 9.
7072000	7075000	It was the classic Final Fantasy but a little bit of that new stuff.
7075000	7078000	And I've said this before on the show, I know I have, I'll say it again.
7078000	7084000	My dream Final Fantasy 16 would just be like, take something in 15's engine.
7084000	7087000	Honestly, so you don't have to take 20 years to make it.
7087000	7090000	Take 15's engine, obviously tweak it a little bit,
7090000	7093000	maybe make the battles a little more traditional or whatever, whatever they're going to do.
7093000	7098000	And just use that type of graphical power with a game in the setting that's more like 9.
7098000	7104000	Traditional Final Fantasy, a fantasy type setting without all the steampunk and the mech and all that stuff.
7104000	7107000	Which, fine, there's a time and a place for that but they've had plenty of Final Fantasy games.
7107000	7112000	I would eat that up. Wouldn't you love to see like a Final Fantasy 15 graphical power
7112000	7114000	but like an old school Final Fantasy game?
7114000	7117000	Which, ironically, I pretty much just said what the 7 remake is.
7117000	7120000	But the 7 remake was all the mech stuff.
7120000	7122000	But I like some of the mech stuff.
7122000	7128000	I just like a little bit less of it, you know, like 6 was fine.
7128000	7134000	Dr. Seeya in chat says, shouldn't they finish 7 remake first or rather Final Fantasy 7 remakes first chapter first?
7134000	7141000	Yes, I guess, and as some people have said before, Final Fantasy 7 remake is Final Fantasy 16.
7141000	7146000	It's not going to be called that, but the effort they're putting into it,
7146000	7149000	the time they're developing to make it, the way they're going to sell it when it comes out,
7149000	7154000	is going to be on par with what a Final Fantasy 16 would get.
7154000	7158000	And I think once that's finally out, then we'll finally hear about Final Fantasy 16.
7158000	7160000	We'll see.
7160000	7164000	Okay, now we'll move on. Sorry, I had a lot to say about Fan Fest and Tangenty things.
7164000	7168000	But let's move on to some updates on other Square Enix things.
7168000	7174000	Yes, so as you may remember, Kingdom Hearts 3 just recently came out and it's done pretty well.
7174000	7182000	The Kingdom Hearts Twitter account posted that over 5 million copies of Kingdom Hearts 3 have been shipped worldwide.
7182000	7185000	So that's a lot of copies potentially sold.
7185000	7190000	That's shipped, not sold. They like to fudge numbers that way, but you know, they're out there.
7190000	7192000	They're going to be sold eventually.
7192000	7195000	I mean, they sold them to retail outlets.
7195000	7199000	So technically they've already made their money, you know, so it's fine.
7199000	7202000	So yeah, doing pretty good.
7202000	7205000	Yeah, that's really not a bad number considering how long that's been out.
7205000	7210000	And considering it didn't launch during the holiday season, that game will probably continue to deliver.
7210000	7215000	And I bet they cut the price of that game just in time for the holidays down to like 30, 40 bucks.
7215000	7219000	And they'll sell a lot more entering the holiday period later this year.
7219000	7224000	And who knows if they really do that Switch version that's always rumored or not. I don't know.
7224000	7226000	You haven't really gotten into Kingdom Hearts 3, huh, Loki?
7226000	7227000	I haven't played it yet.
7227000	7229000	Is it something you bought?
7229000	7231000	I already bought it, yeah. I just haven't played it yet.
7232000	7236000	I was, um, what was I doing the other day? I was doing something on the PlayStation.
7236000	7238000	I was like, oh yeah, I have to play Kingdom Hearts.
7238000	7244000	Oh, I was looking, there was, um, I saw a posting online saying that Earth Defense Force 5 was on sale.
7244000	7247000	Um, but it was only on sale for 20% off here.
7247000	7249000	And I was like, that's a $60 game.
7249000	7256000	Like, I remember when Earth Defense Force 2017 was like a $20 or $30 game brand new.
7256000	7259000	And now they want 60 bucks for that shit?
7259000	7262000	And let's be honest, I mean, it hasn't gotten that much better.
7262000	7268000	It's just, it was a simple series, dude. It was like $20 games. Come on.
7270000	7272000	Alright, moving on to our next story.
7272000	7275000	And by the way, we're just a little ways away from taking calls.
7275000	7279000	So, if you would like to call into OLR and talk about something we have talked about,
7279000	7283000	or maybe something we haven't addressed yet, you're going to head on over to our VoG Network Discord channel.
7283000	7288000	Go to vognetwork.com slash Discord, and I think that's linked below on our Twitch page.
7288000	7292000	And you can join our Discord server, and you're going to want to wait in the Green Room channel.
7292000	7296000	And tell us a little bit about, in the Orange Dance Radio channel, what you want to talk about tonight.
7296000	7298000	And we will get to calls in a little bit.
7298000	7300000	But for now, let's talk about this rumor.
7300000	7304000	So, Shane really wanted me to talk about this for some reason.
7304000	7306000	It's still a rumor, so I don't know.
7306000	7307000	Yeah.
7307000	7311000	But anyway, apparently there's a Nintendo Direct that's coming next week.
7311000	7314000	And it's going to have news on the Metroid Prime trilogy for Switch,
7314000	7316000	which we've already heard rumors about,
7316000	7319000	which would make a lot of sense considering Metroid Prime 4.
7319000	7320000	We all know what happened there.
7320000	7322000	A couple weeks ago, they had to say,
7322000	7325000	we are starting over, basically, with that whole thing, right?
7325000	7330000	So, a Metroid Prime trilogy kind of holdover makes a lot of sense, right?
7330000	7333000	But then the other big thing, and I don't know where this rumor's coming from,
7333000	7335000	but Super Mario Maker 2 is also...
7335000	7337000	It's coming from Fanwink, is where it's coming from.
7337000	7338000	It's coming from Fan...
7338000	7341000	Well, it's, I guess it is reset era forums,
7341000	7343000	which, that's what happened to NeoGaf, right?
7343000	7345000	It became reset, or all the people...
7345000	7346000	No, NeoGaf is NeoGaf.
7346000	7347000	It's so complicated.
7347000	7348000	Y'all are dramatic.
7348000	7352000	Anyway, so there's a user over there, King Zell,
7352000	7354000	who I guess has been reliable before.
7354000	7357000	So it's one of those, well, he was right before, so he's probably right now.
7357000	7360000	So he's talking about the Metroid Prime trilogy,
7360000	7362000	or I should say they, because we don't know their gender,
7362000	7365000	a Metroid Prime trilogy on Switch.
7365000	7368000	And then also brought out news about the Super Mario Maker 2.
7369000	7374000	I mean, we keep saying Mario Maker on Switch win,
7374000	7379000	and it would make a lot of sense that Nintendo may take an approach
7379000	7382000	that's worked very well for them with Smash Brothers,
7382000	7386000	where it's like, it's not a remaster for Switch.
7386000	7390000	I mean, we kind of did use a lot of the stuff we had on Wii U,
7390000	7395000	but we did a real deep dive into this and rebalanced and redid things.
7395000	7400000	We really went into this and made a new game out of it.
7400000	7404000	And to be fair, I think Splatoon 2 is in a very similar type of boat.
7404000	7406000	I mean, we kind of took what worked with the first game
7406000	7409000	and kind of added more to it and made Splatoon 2.
7409000	7414000	So, I mean, a Mario Maker 2 in that regard, it does make a lot of sense, right, Loki?
7414000	7416000	Would you be all about a Mario Maker 2?
7416000	7420000	What do you think would justify a 2 in Mario Maker 2?
7420000	7422000	Because I have an idea.
7422000	7425000	They would just have to...
7425000	7427000	It would just be more game types, I think.
7427000	7433000	So you'd have stuff from Super Mario Brothers 2 in there.
7433000	7436000	I don't think so. But go ahead.
7436000	7441000	I would like to see other games, like a Nintendo Maker almost,
7441000	7446000	instead of just Mario Maker, like Metroid, Zelda.
7446000	7452000	I like that. So other types of games, not just necessarily Mario platformers.
7452000	7456000	Super Mario Maker, but they use that brand and that name people know,
7456000	7458000	but they expand it in other types of games.
7458000	7462000	That's a very lofty goal, but I like that idea.
7462000	7464000	I would think maybe one thing they'd put into it
7464000	7467000	is that it's going to have more of a focus on competitive.
7467000	7471000	That you would be able to play a level at the same time with your friend,
7471000	7477000	Nintendo Online, and I'm saying they've got to try to make that more appealing somehow,
7477000	7481000	and that you would race with friends online, and they would be like little shadows.
7481000	7485000	I swear there was a Game Boy version of the game that did this exact thing,
7485000	7487000	where you would use the link cable.
7487000	7490000	I think it was the remake of one. Maybe chat knows what I'm talking about.
7490000	7494000	But you'd use the link cable, and you'd see the shadow of the other person playing while you're playing,
7494000	7496000	and you didn't collide or run into each other or anything,
7496000	7499000	but it's like you were doing competitive speed runs.
7499000	7501000	And I can see that being a thing in a sequel.
7501000	7503000	And why limit it to two people?
7503000	7506000	Maybe you could have four people all playing at once,
7506000	7511000	and we know that part of the fun of Mario is all the different costume Marios with the amiibo,
7511000	7514000	so maybe everybody could be a different Mario sprite.
7514000	7517000	I don't know. It could be interesting.
7517000	7519000	Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,
7519000	7521000	Total fan wank from Loki.
7521000	7523000	Mario Maker Battle Royale.
7525000	7526000	I like that.
7526000	7527000	Darktitsia says,
7527000	7530000	Yeah, Super Mario Deluxe had you race against a boo.
7530000	7533000	Yeah, okay. I thought that was a thing. I remember that.
7533000	7536000	Let's see. Also, Darktitsia says,
7536000	7539000	Well, Splatoon 2 did have a lot of the old maps revived.
7539000	7541000	And Shane is pointing out,
7541000	7544000	The Mario Maker 2 rumor isn't for this Direct.
7544000	7547000	I only wanted you to talk about it because everybody loves Directs.
7547000	7550000	It'll mean more when we get a confirmation on it.
7550000	7552000	I mean, that would be cool if it is true.
7552000	7555000	I guess other things that are rumored they could talk about
7555000	7558000	is that we had that Super Nintendo data mine file
7558000	7560000	in the Nintendo Online thing,
7560000	7563000	so this might be a great time to tell us what that means
7563000	7566000	and maybe outline some of the other Switch Online titles
7566000	7569000	for the rest of the year, if not up to the summer in E3.
7569000	7570000	So we'll see.
7570000	7574000	Do you think it's plausible
7574000	7576000	that there could be a Nintendo Direct this week?
7576000	7577000	I guess.
7577000	7580000	It's just as plausible as there could be one another week.
7580000	7582000	So we'll see.
7582000	7583000	Bobby Blackwell says,
7583000	7585000	I'd rather just wait for the Direct to happen
7585000	7587000	before spending time talking about it.
7587000	7589000	Well, isn't it great that you have your own show
7589000	7591000	where you can pick and choose what you want to talk about?
7591000	7593000	But sometimes, especially at the end of the show,
7593000	7595000	sometimes rumors are fun to get into
7595000	7597000	because, and here's my perspective on it,
7597000	7601000	if some of these rumors gain so much traction,
7601000	7603000	and these Nintendo Direct ones especially,
7603000	7607000	because on Twitter, people will take the ball and run with it
7607000	7609000	with these Direct things.
7609000	7611000	And sometimes, I just want to say,
7611000	7613000	y'all, stop putting the cart before the horse.
7613000	7616000	Just because you read the tea leaves one way in 2017
7616000	7618000	doesn't mean you'll be able to read it the same way in 2019,
7618000	7619000	and so forth.
7619000	7622000	So sometimes I want to bring up rumors just to squash them.
7622000	7626000	But I mean, sure, it's been a hot minute
7626000	7628000	since we've had a Nintendo Direct.
7628000	7631000	And I think a Metroid Prime trilogy,
7631000	7633000	I mean, heck, we kind of already guessed
7633000	7636000	that that might be a bridge when this happened with 4.
7636000	7640000	As far as Mario Maker 2 coming out of a random Direct in February,
7640000	7641000	I doubt it.
7641000	7643000	But I think maybe outlining,
7643000	7646000	especially since we know that Nintendo has more pressure on Switch Online,
7646000	7649000	I think outlining maybe what the calendar looks like a little further out,
7649000	7650000	that makes sense.
7650000	7652000	Spotlighting more indie stuff,
7652000	7654000	because there's a ton of it on the marketplace,
7654000	7656000	makes a lot of sense as well.
7656000	7658000	So, anyway.
7661000	7662000	Moving on.
7662000	7665000	Let's go to a couple more stories.
7665000	7668000	Loki, what about one of your favorite series, right?
7668000	7670000	Yes, Grand Theft Auto Online.
7670000	7673000	So, of course, one thing with Grand Theft Auto and Grand Theft Auto Online
7673000	7675000	is there's been a lot of cheating.
7675000	7679000	And so, of course, Rockstar Games has been trying to crack down on that.
7679000	7684000	So, apparently, there is a guy by the name of Johnny Perez,
7684000	7689000	who was a creator of an online cheat program called Illusive.
7689000	7693000	And he's been found guilty by default from the District Court.
7693000	7694000	Guilty by default!
7694000	7696000	District Court of New York.
7696000	7698000	Because, you know, that means he didn't show up the court.
7698000	7699000	Uh-oh.
7699000	7704000	So, apparently, what the program Illusive did
7704000	7709000	is it allowed you to basically generate unlimited currency in the game.
7709000	7710000	Because everything in the game is expensive,
7710000	7712000	because they want you to grind for it,
7712000	7717000	or buy those shark cards and spend real-world money on the game.
7717000	7719000	And that's how they make a ton of extra money on it.
7719000	7725000	So, of course, Take-Two had contacted this Johnny Perez,
7725000	7727000	apparently last year,
7727000	7730000	and ordered him to cease the sale of Illusive
7730000	7733000	and the distribution of the software,
7733000	7736000	because he was selling it to people to actually use.
7736000	7740000	And he apparently complied with the request,
7740000	7745000	but also, when they tried to contact him again,
7745000	7747000	he basically just didn't respond to them.
7747000	7751000	So, with that, of course, they went to court,
7751000	7754000	and then damages were awarded to Take-Two,
7754000	7757000	so they've been awarded $150,000 in damages,
7757000	7763000	and also he is supposed to pay $70,000 in legal fees.
7763000	7768000	So that's a lot of money for cheating in an online game.
7768000	7771000	So the chatroom on Twitch is giving me shit,
7771000	7775000	because if you look at the storyboard, look what happened.
7775000	7778000	I was typing so fast.
7778000	7783000	It says, Grant that photo online, cheat tray.
7783000	7785000	And so now they're making French jokes in the chat,
7785000	7788000	because apparently I typed too fast,
7788000	7789000	and I got my E in my arm.
7789000	7791000	And for those listening on the podcast,
7791000	7792000	the little thing says,
7792000	7793000	Grant that photo is supposed to say,
7793000	7795000	Cheater owes money, but because I typed so fast.
7795000	7799000	Because you all have never made a typo in your entire life.
7799000	7801000	I textily put cheat tray.
7801000	7803000	Whatever. You know what?
7803000	7807000	Fine. I'll scroll it off the screen, then we'll get to the next story.
7807000	7809000	And no, I didn't make up that.
7809000	7811000	That's the actual name of a game.
7811000	7812000	Nino Cooney.
7812000	7813000	Nino Cooney.
7813000	7815000	Bobby Blackwell's favorite game.
7815000	7816000	Oh, man.
7816000	7818000	That was like his game of the year, the year that came out.
7818000	7819000	Nino Cooney.
7819000	7820000	Did he even play it?
7820000	7821000	Because I don't think he passed the demo.
7821000	7823000	No, because he couldn't get past the demo.
7823000	7824000	And to be fair, it did have a shit demo.
7824000	7826000	But anyway, the game itself, I liked.
7826000	7830000	So you're going to go see the movie and get past the trailer?
7830000	7832000	You're not going to let me read the fucking story
7832000	7834000	before you start making jokes looking.
7834000	7835000	No, I'm not.
7837000	7840000	But yes, Nino Cooney, they are going to be making a movie about it.
7840000	7843000	Warner Brothers Japan is teaming up with Level 5,
7843000	7845000	who made the Nino Cooney games.
7845000	7847000	They're going to be doing an anime film adaptation,
7847000	7851000	so it's not a live action film, but it's going to be anime based.
7851000	7854000	The character designs, of course, by Yoshiuki Momose
7854000	7856000	and the score by Joe Hisahashi.
7856000	7859000	It's going to be a summer 2019 release, apparently,
7859000	7860000	so that's going to be pretty soon.
7860000	7862000	Level 5 did a press conference recently
7862000	7864000	where they announced that their CEO would be working
7864000	7868000	as executive producer and script writer for this film.
7868000	7871000	Of course, you should know this series
7871000	7874000	because Studio Ghibli had a huge influence on this series.
7874000	7875000	It was actually a partnership with them.
7875000	7877000	And that's what made this game very interesting to some people.
7877000	7879000	And again, I liked the game.
7879000	7881000	I mean, it had its faults.
7881000	7883000	And then the sequel was pretty decent, too.
7883000	7886000	Again, they all had their faults, but it was a good RPG
7886000	7888000	and I think people really enjoyed it.
7888000	7892000	So, needless to say, I really enjoy Studio Ghibli's work.
7892000	7895000	So, as far as, like, here's the ironic thing,
7895000	7899000	because a lot of video game movie adaptations become trash,
7899000	7903000	this has the formula to be a pretty good one, Bobby,
7903000	7908000	because Studio Ghibli kind of, like, they don't really make bad films.
7908000	7909000	You know what I mean?
7909000	7911000	I'm sure somebody is in the chat going,
7911000	7912000	but what about that?
7912000	7913000	Okay, maybe one or two.
7913000	7915000	But, like, for the most part, they make really good movies.
7915000	7917000	So, I'd be curious. I'd be into it.
7917000	7918000	Why not?
7918000	7921000	Of course, I wonder if we're going to get a release of it here in the US.
7921000	7923000	Probably not, but you never know.
7923000	7924000	Yeah.
7924000	7927000	Sometimes. Some of the Miyazaki movies have come over.
7927000	7928000	Yeah.
7928000	7929000	If it was possible.
7929000	7931000	So, all right.
7933000	7937000	We're going to get into the part of the show where we take calls on our Discord.
7937000	7941000	vognetwork.com slash Discord, if you want to get into our Discord.
7941000	7943000	And you just got to join that Green Room channel
7943000	7948000	and we'll be pulling you into our room to talk about stuff on air with us.
7948000	7950000	If we have enough time, we'll try to get to everybody.
7950000	7952000	I wanted to ask, Loki, though, last minute stories.
7952000	7954000	Anything else we didn't quite get around to talking about tonight?
7954000	7955000	Yes.
7955000	7962000	There is a Sony Interactive Air Team patent regarding a new motion controller for,
7962000	7965000	I'm assuming, the PlayStation VR.
7965000	7969000	Apparently, the patent, they filed that originally in 2017,
7970000	7973000	but it was published just a couple of days ago.
7973000	7982000	And it looks like, almost like the, I don't know, an upgraded move controller.
7982000	7984000	Block ears.
7984000	7985000	Fuck, though.
7985000	7986000	That's why I got to say.
7986000	7992000	It looks like it has an L2R2 button that can be depressed on the back of it.
7992000	7997000	And they have a thumb stick there and some more face buttons.
7997000	7998000	Cool.
7998000	7999000	Interesting.
7999000	8002000	Anything's better than what we have now with that thing.
8002000	8004000	Although, this doesn't necessarily look like the move controller
8004000	8007000	with the fact that it doesn't have the giant, you know, ice cream ball at the end.
8007000	8013000	But it's, I forget the second one that they had, not the move controller,
8013000	8017000	but there was the nav controller, I think it was called.
8017000	8020000	Well, they also probably don't need the giant, like, on the PlayStation 3,
8020000	8023000	it was probably one thing because the camera was one resolution.
8023000	8025000	But if you think about it, the PlayStation 4 camera can pick up
8025000	8027000	the much smaller lights on the back of your controllers.
8027000	8030000	And know where you're at with those lights.
8030000	8034000	So, there could still be a light that's just a lot smaller.
8034000	8035000	Probably, yeah.
8035000	8036000	Who knows?
8036000	8037000	I don't know.
8037000	8038000	It looks neat, I guess.
8038000	8041000	But I just need something better than what they have.
8041000	8047000	Alright, so we have one caller waiting to go in our green room.
8047000	8048000	Let's get to it.
8048000	8051000	And then I'll come back and see if you have any other stories you want to talk about tonight.
8051000	8053000	But, hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8053000	8054000	Who's this?
8054000	8055000	Hey, it's Metal Man here.
8055000	8056000	How are you?
8056000	8057000	Good, how are you, buddy?
8057000	8059000	Pretty good.
8059000	8063000	I was going to ask three interrelated questions,
8063000	8069000	but I'll narrow it down to one for time reasons.
8069000	8070000	That's probably best.
8070000	8071000	What's on your mind?
8071000	8078000	Now, you know how I think I was last week,
8078000	8084000	I had given the quick anecdote about going to show up at this pizza place
8084000	8086000	as a kid and loving it.
8086000	8087000	Yeah.
8087000	8100000	As a result of that place, I will forever associate food with me, specifically pizza.
8100000	8110000	Do you mean like all pizza or like shitty cardboard gross disgusting pizza,
8110000	8113000	which is what they served at places like Chuck E. Cheese, if you remember.
8113000	8114000	But who gives a fuck?
8114000	8115000	It's pizza.
8115000	8119000	Yeah, well, I don't remember how good or bad the pizza was.
8119000	8122000	The only thing I remember is they sold pizza there.
8122000	8125000	As a kid, there is no bad pizza.
8125000	8128000	You would eat those pizzas that they'd make at your school, which were disgusting.
8128000	8129000	Anyway, sorry.
8129000	8131000	I don't mean to derail you, Metal Man.
8131000	8132000	What's your question?
8132000	8139000	Yeah, well, also bear in mind, we're talking about close to 35-year-old memories.
8139000	8142000	But anyway, that's besides the point.
8142000	8154000	Now, going with that theme, do you associate any specific foods with video games and why?
8154000	8160000	Our two favorite topics, yet this question has never come up, food and video games.
8160000	8164000	Our two very favorite topics mashed into the blender.
8164000	8165000	Will it blend into one question?
8165000	8169000	Is there a food that you associate with a video game?
8169000	8177000	Well, I mean, I guess there's, I would say Parmesan.
8177000	8180000	Not Parmesan, like the cheese sticks.
8180000	8182000	Fucker stole my answer.
8182000	8183000	And Dance Dance Revolution.
8183000	8184000	Stole my answer.
8184000	8185000	Sorry.
8185000	8186000	No, it's fine.
8186000	8188000	It's just funny that we're on the same wavelength like that.
8188000	8189000	Yeah, absolutely.
8189000	8195000	Mozzarella sticks for Brookfields and Dance Dance Revolution because, well, for one, those
8195000	8197000	were some good mozzarella sticks.
8197000	8198000	They don't pay me to endorse.
8198000	8201000	They're a local chain anyway, so you have to be here.
8201000	8202000	But, and I don't even know.
8202000	8205000	They could have changed the recipe in the last 10 years.
8205000	8206000	I wouldn't know.
8206000	8207000	I haven't ordered those in years.
8207000	8212000	But remember how Orange Lawns Radio started is that we used to meet up at Golf Land and
8212000	8217000	we would play DDR and Alpine Racer 2, as you heard earlier in the show, Soul Calibur 2
8217000	8219000	and other stuff they had at the arcade.
8219000	8223000	And then when we were done, we'd go to the diner that was like across the parking lot
8223000	8228000	and just kind of sit at a giant table and talk about games and the games that we loved,
8228000	8231000	which included music games, but other types of games too.
8231000	8238000	And I think we had that response because I was younger then, earlier in my twenties,
8238000	8239000	as were you.
8239000	8243000	And so it was like mozzarella sticks because we don't get fat at this age.
8243000	8246000	Well, also we were like playing DDR for like five hours a day.
8246000	8252000	So it's like, you know, that did contribute a lot to it.
8253000	8258000	Yeah, that and then that seemed to me like McDonald's and Call of Duty and Grand Theft Auto
8258000	8260000	because we used to get McDonald's.
8260000	8261000	Because both are basic.
8261000	8265000	And play on, you know, play our games during lunch and stuff.
8265000	8268000	But, you know, that's about it.
8268000	8270000	Bobby Blackwell says, you'll love this.
8270000	8275000	I associate Cheesic grooves with Final Fantasy 14 because that's what I was eating a lot of times
8275000	8278000	when I was playing Final Fantasy 14 with you guys.
8278000	8279000	That's cute.
8279000	8280000	I like that answer too.
8280000	8281000	Yeah, like a snack food.
8281000	8282000	I don't know.
8282000	8283000	There's so many.
8283000	8284000	I'm trying to think.
8284000	8286000	I don't think there's a snack food I only ate for a limited time.
8286000	8289000	It's like I could sit here and go sour cream and onion pringles.
8289000	8294000	I associate with literally anything because those are like really fucking good chips.
8294000	8299000	So that's like I eat a lot of those when I play video games.
8299000	8301000	Roast beef and Orion 78.
8301000	8303000	Oh, now you're getting into.
8303000	8306000	These are jokes that people are not going to understand in 2019.
8306000	8309000	A very, very small subset of gamers will get those jokes.
8309000	8310000	But yes.
8310000	8311000	Anyway.
8311000	8316000	Well, was there anything for you, Metal Mayhem, besides the pizza?
8316000	8319000	No, that's pretty much it.
8319000	8320000	No.
8320000	8326000	Well, here in Buffalo, we also associate wings with pizza.
8326000	8337000	So by virtue of the connection, well, pizza being the intermediary, I also associate wings
8337000	8340000	with video games in general.
8340000	8341000	So but fair enough.
8341000	8344000	You know, another thing I would associate, actually, now I think about it, I would associate
8344000	8351000	with DDR in the arcade as I would associate Slurpees because they sold Slurpees there.
8351000	8352000	Or was it Icee?
8352000	8353000	Icee.
8353000	8354000	Icee.
8354000	8355000	Whatever.
8355000	8356000	The same thing.
8356000	8357000	Icees are just awesome.
8357000	8358000	So I associate Icee's with that.
8358000	8361000	That hideous snack bar nacho flavor.
8361000	8362000	And in the later years, remember this?
8362000	8364000	They put a full on Subway in there.
8364000	8365000	Yeah.
8366000	8367000	Some other sandwich.
8367000	8368000	Oh, it's not even Subway anymore.
8368000	8369000	It's not Subway anymore.
8369000	8370000	It's like interesting.
8370000	8371000	Something else.
8371000	8372000	You know, this is going to sound complete.
8372000	8373000	Is it Port-A-Subs?
8373000	8374000	Because we finally got one in the sack area.
8374000	8375000	No, it's not Port-A-Subs.
8375000	8376000	It's like their own thing.
8376000	8377000	Did you know there's one in the sack now?
8377000	8378000	What's a Port-A-Sub?
8378000	8379000	It's a sub.
8379000	8380000	I should.
8380000	8381000	I'm giving free advertising.
8381000	8382000	It's a Subway.
8382000	8385000	It's a sub sandwich chain that used to be here that I really liked as a kid growing
8385000	8386000	up.
8386000	8387000	And then it like went away.
8387000	8388000	And it's only been in Nevada.
8388000	8389000	It's been up in Reno.
8389000	8390000	But they finally built another one here.
8390000	8392000	Oh, they have like now I've been seeing.
8393000	8394000	They replaced a Subway.
8394000	8399000	That's why they have like Jersey Mike's and they have a sourdough and company.
8399000	8401000	The firehouse is really growing, too.
8401000	8403000	That used to be the type of thing I could only get at Dragon Con.
8403000	8404000	And now they're everywhere.
8404000	8405000	Yeah.
8405000	8406000	Firehouse.
8406000	8407000	Yeah.
8407000	8408000	We've got one of those nearby.
8408000	8409000	Well, I've brought that to the show a few times.
8409000	8410000	It's a little too much, though.
8410000	8411000	It's like too heavy.
8411000	8413000	If you if you want to if you want you're trying to go on the subway diet.
8413000	8418000	That's a little bit more than, you know, feasible than the firehouse subs diet where you get
8418000	8423000	like a giant thing of like pulled pork on your sandwich or something like that.
8423000	8424000	All right.
8424000	8425000	Congratulations.
8425000	8426000	You got a food tangent on our good job.
8426000	8427000	All right.
8427000	8428000	Thank you.
8428000	8429000	Metal mayhem for the call.
8429000	8430000	Appreciate it.
8430000	8431000	Take care.
8431000	8432000	OK.
8432000	8433000	All right.
8433000	8434000	Have a good one.
8434000	8435000	You too.
8435000	8436000	All right.
8436000	8437000	There's nobody else in our green room right now.
8437000	8438000	So if you do want to call into the show, you can over at Vogue Network dot com slash discord
8438000	8439000	in the green room.
8439000	8443000	Quest Buster is in our chat room saying Dragon's Lair and spaghetti.
8443000	8448000	Another arcade near us had an old cabinet of Dragon's Lair, and next door was a pasta
8448000	8449000	place.
8449000	8452000	Well, there's a lot of like pizza and arcade games, I mean, because like we associate those
8452000	8457000	roundtable garlic sticks with Orange Lounge Radio because you bring them here all the
8457000	8458000	time.
8458000	8463000	Well, like even like roundtable, like arcade games, like we used to go to arcades all the
8463000	8464000	time that were pizza places.
8464000	8468000	And so like there was Rico's Pizza with their two foot long party pizzas.
8468000	8472000	And that's per slice, too, by the way.
8472000	8479000	And then like, well, roundtable used to go to roundtable and Chuck E. Cheese, you know,
8479000	8481000	all of those had pizza.
8481000	8487000	So pizza and arcade games, frozen yogurt and Ms. Pac-Man, because there used to be a yogurt
8487000	8490000	place that my mom would take me to because it was right next door to Mervyn's, her favorite
8490000	8491000	store.
8491000	8492000	So I'm dating this whole thing.
8492000	8496000	But there was a little yogurt place next to Mervyn's.
8496000	8501000	And they were the only place that I saw that had a cocktail cabinet with Ms. Ms. Pac-Man
8501000	8503000	actually was in the cocktail cabinet.
8503000	8506000	So I associate Ms. Pac-Man with frozen yogurt.
8506000	8510000	Because that would be the time I could play the cocktail, which is cocktail cabinets are
8510000	8511000	awesome.
8511000	8514000	Like, I don't know if you know, I think they're kind of a relic of the 80s.
8514000	8517000	I don't think you really see them anymore, but it used to be like basically like a stand
8517000	8521000	up arcade table, but but in a table, they're really awesome.
8521000	8522000	So I kind of miss those.
8522000	8525000	So anyway.
8525000	8526000	All right.
8526000	8527000	Let's see.
8527000	8531000	Oh, seeing active says, holy fuck Mervyn's.
8531000	8532000	That's a name I haven't heard in a while.
8532000	8533000	Yeah, I know.
8533000	8537000	I know they went under many years ago, but that that was like the place to go shopping
8537000	8539000	if you were my mother growing up.
8539000	8541000	So anyhow, any other last minute stories?
8541000	8542000	Because we really have.
8542000	8543000	Oh, I think somebody else just joined the green room.
8543000	8546000	But I'll take one more story if you got a last minute story.
8546000	8547000	Let's see.
8547000	8549000	I'll have to dig something up real quick here.
8550000	8559000	How about there was a German techno DJ who's releasing an album on Sega Mega Drive cart.
8559000	8560000	I heard about this.
8560000	8561000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
8561000	8563000	Remute, it looks like.
8563000	8566000	So, yeah, DJ Remute from Hamburg.
8566000	8572000	He's releasing his techno optimistic LP on an actual cartridge that will play in actual
8572000	8573000	Mega Drive.
8573000	8575000	So that's pretty cool.
8575000	8581000	It's a custom built flash chip with four megabytes only, and this contains a custom
8581000	8587000	music player programmed, they said, by some coders from the demo scene.
8587000	8588000	Neat.
8588000	8589000	That's an inventive way to release your album.
8589000	8590000	That's for sure.
8590000	8591000	I like that.
8591000	8592000	That's pretty cool.
8592000	8593000	All right.
8593000	8595000	We'll take one more call here and then I'll probably be it because I don't see anybody
8595000	8596000	else in the green room.
8596000	8597000	But hello.
8597000	8598000	You're on orange on radio.
8598000	8599000	Who's this?
8599000	8600000	Hey, so we're only wrong.
8600000	8602000	How is everybody doing tonight?
8602000	8603000	Fantastic.
8603000	8604000	It's great to hear from you.
8604000	8605000	What's on your mind tonight, buddy?
8605000	8608000	I have a bit of a gaming dilemma.
8608000	8615000	I haven't yet posted this to get outside suggestions, but I want to run this by you in low key and
8615000	8617000	see what should be the best thing I should do about this.
8617000	8618000	All right.
8618000	8619000	Let's fire away.
8619000	8620000	Let's try it.
8620000	8621000	All right.
8621000	8622000	So I have a PS3 fat.
8622000	8623000	Great little device.
8623000	8624000	Love it.
8624000	8627000	Main reason why I got a fat, backwards compatibility for the PS2.
8627000	8633000	So far, I have had it repaired twice for the same old reason, yellow light.
8633000	8636000	This time when I got it back, they cranked up the fans.
8636000	8638000	So I'm like, okay, fine.
8638000	8639000	That's cool.
8639000	8642000	But when I play my PS3, it sounds like a jet engine.
8642000	8646000	So I'm like, I can't sit here and play this unless it's during the summer when the air
8646000	8647000	conditioner is running.
8647000	8650000	And my mind thinks it's the AC and not the PS3.
8650000	8653000	Now they clean the fans and it sounds worse.
8653000	8655000	No, they probably would think it is.
8655000	8661000	They took the fan control off and they just wired it straight to the 12 volt or seven
8661000	8663000	volt or whatever it's running.
8663000	8665000	So it's always at max speed.
8665000	8666000	Got it.
8666000	8668000	Yeah, that's basically what it is.
8668000	8673000	So I thought about, you know, maybe if I get lucky, I'll come across another PS3 fat, do
8673000	8675000	a data transfer and retire this one.
8675000	8684000	But given with what Square Enix and other companies porting some PS3 games over to Xbox
8684000	8690000	and we're seeing some PS4 versions of PS3 games, I have been wondering, should I just
8690000	8698000	figure out which PS3 games that are available on PS4 and Xbox and just get retired as fat
8698000	8703000	for a slim or should I just drop another 80 bucks on getting it repaired or getting lucky
8703000	8704000	to get another fat?
8704000	8710000	Okay, so I'm going to take the Mario Kondo approach and ask, does it spark joy?
8710000	8718000	Because I'm being serious here because, you know, a lot of times I think we kind of hold
8718000	8723000	on to old consoles to say, I still have this old console that plays old games, but you
8723000	8726000	have to really, and this is even something I'm finding myself challenged with.
8726000	8730000	Like I still hanging onto a Dreamcast and I love the Dreamcast and Dreamcast has a great
8730000	8735000	library of games, but how often am I really playing that Dreamcast?
8735000	8737000	I'm really not.
8737000	8741000	It's funny you bring that up because I don't know if you've seen it, but I have like a
8741000	8744000	little shelf of all my gaming consoles.
8744000	8748000	I realize as I'm going through old cables, I find my Dreamcast controller and cables.
8748000	8750000	I'm like, my Dreamcast is in the storage closet.
8750000	8753000	I should take it out, put it on display and have it.
8753000	8755000	I said this about two weeks ago.
8755000	8759000	But to be fair, a big reason why I don't really play the Dreamcast is that a lot of the big
8759000	8763000	games that I had on Dreamcast that I enjoyed, they're available on PC now, like Space Channel
8763000	8765000	5, probably the best example.
8765000	8767000	Uh, Red is available on other platforms.
8767000	8772000	Yeah, I had the Space Channel for PS2, but there was one game on Dreamcast that's only
8772000	8773000	available on Dreamcast.
8773000	8774000	That's Project Justice.
8774000	8777000	So I'm like, I'm not getting rid of Dreamcast for that one reason.
8777000	8780000	Sure, and Power Stone would be another good reason.
8780000	8781000	But anyway.
8781000	8782000	Yeah, exactly.
8782000	8783000	Yeah.
8783000	8785000	But anyway, I mean, all that stuff aside, I think the first question you should ask
8785000	8788000	is how much am I really using this PS3?
8788000	8792000	And if the answer is you are still using it quite frequently, I would think like second
8792000	8797000	hand at a flea market or thrift store or something, you ought to be able to find a replacement.
8797000	8800000	And that would probably be the route I would go.
8800000	8803000	But you said it was the kind that had PS2 backwards compatibility, right?
8803000	8804000	Yeah.
8804000	8805000	Mm hmm.
8805000	8809000	How often are you using it?
8809000	8812000	Not often because I've actually retired my PS2.
8812000	8813000	It's in the storage closet.
8813000	8819000	And I'm thinking if I go through my PlayStation 3 games to see what plays where I have no
8819000	8825000	problems taking the PS2 out, hooking it up, getting a PS3 slim, because what got me thinking
8825000	8830000	about this is when Square Enix said Final Fantasy 13 is available for Xbox One.
8830000	8834000	And I'm sitting there looking at Amazon, all three of those games I could buy new and used
8834000	8836000	for under 15 bucks.
8836000	8839000	Meanwhile, I have the three games on PS3.
8839000	8843000	I've been sitting here like, should I just trade these and just get the Xbox ones and
8843000	8847000	just install it on my, you know, I kind of feel like that might be the right route to
8847000	8850000	go is to just replace the PlayStation 3 with a new one.
8850000	8854000	And then, you know, you can retire your PlayStation 2 and use that for your PlayStation 3.
8854000	8856000	And use that for your PlayStation 2 games.
8856000	8859000	But I mean, if you want, this is going to be a very tinfoil hat approach.
8859000	8863000	But we did talk on the show last week about a heavy rumor.
8863000	8867000	But, you know, you know how we all feel about rumors, but that PlayStation 5 might have
8867000	8870000	more backwards compatibility and that whole thing.
8870000	8874000	And we had a very animated discussion and discord on backwards compatibility and that
8874000	8875000	whole thing when it comes to Sony.
8875000	8880000	And I think at the end of the day, we don't really know because Sony hasn't really established
8880000	8881000	a standard.
8881000	8883000	It's changed from system to system.
8883000	8886000	So we don't know what's going to happen with PlayStation 5.
8886000	8889000	But you can risk it.
8889000	8890000	You know what?
8890000	8895000	I might, but to touch on that, I'm sitting here going, to me, there's no reason why Sony
8895000	8897000	can't do it because Microsoft did it.
8897000	8900000	I mean, they're going through the backwards compatibility.
8900000	8904000	Yes, I still have a 360 for a bunch of games I still play.
8904000	8909000	Uh oh, did we lose you?
8909000	8911000	Yep, I think we did.
8911000	8912000	Rama, come in, Rama.
8912000	8915000	Yeah, he's still connected in our discord room.
8915000	8918000	But let's try to finish and then maybe he'll kind of join.
8918000	8922000	So I think he was kind of talking about that he's still, you know, a lot of the Xbox 360
8922000	8924000	kind of ended up on the backwards compatibility.
8924000	8929000	And so he probably uses his Xbox One to play a lot of those former Xbox games and so forth.
8929000	8931000	So, yeah.
8931000	8932000	I don't know.
8932000	8935000	My fat's still in the garage.
8935000	8936000	Oh, really?
8936000	8940000	I don't know if it works yet or if it still works.
8940000	8941000	I have a 20, though.
8941000	8944000	So that kind of sucks because it doesn't have Wi-Fi built into it.
8944000	8946000	But, eh, whatever.
8946000	8947000	He just popped back in the green room.
8947000	8950000	Let me try to pull him back in and see maybe if you wanted to finish his thought.
8950000	8951000	Are you back, Rama?
8951000	8952000	Yeah, I'm back.
8952000	8954000	I don't know what happened lately.
8954000	8958000	Um, my Wi-Fi here has been kind of odd with the router.
8958000	8960000	So it's like I might have to call and get that replaced.
8960000	8963000	So I apologize for cutting off.
8963000	8964000	That's OK.
8964000	8967000	But let's finish your thought and then we'll try to wrap up here because you were talking
8967000	8969000	about the Xbox and you were using your Xbox.
8969000	8974000	I'm just saying if we had backwards compatibility on the Xbox, the hardware is there.
8974000	8975000	So Microsoft can do it.
8975000	8980000	We don't know what how customizable the the chip is in the PS3.
8980000	8985000	So that could be way Sony's like, we don't know how to properly emulate, which I get
8985000	8986000	that.
8986000	8990000	But the PS5 with the hardware that they're coming out with, which is basically off the
8990000	8996000	shelf parts to me from a technological hardware point, there's no reason why they can't do
8997000	8998000	that.
8998000	9002000	Ultimately, it's going to be up to Sony because, you know, maybe they want you to buy them
9002000	9003000	again.
9003000	9004000	And it's all going to be digital and streaming only.
9004000	9007000	Maybe they don't want to have native backwards compatibility on it.
9007000	9009000	I mean, who knows?
9009000	9010000	I don't.
9010000	9012000	We could come up with a million different solutions.
9012000	9017000	But as far as you say, as far as your immediate problem goes, I would say, you know what?
9017000	9022000	Look at how many hours you're really spending a day playing the PlayStation 3 and the associated
9022000	9023000	games.
9023000	9025000	And if you are still playing in a significant amount, then I would say just replace it.
9025000	9028000	It's not going to be that expensive to replace it secondhand.
9028000	9029000	And I would go that route.
9029000	9030000	No.
9030000	9032000	I mean, there's a couple of secondhand shops I can check out.
9032000	9038000	But, you know, if I can just like look at my options to see what goes where, I'm good
9038000	9044000	because, I mean, I have the Kingdom Hearts Collector's Edition for PS3, and now I have
9044000	9046000	it for PS4, so I'm blessed for that.
9046000	9050000	The Final Fantasy 10.10.2, I get that for PS4.
9050000	9053000	I'm just like, well, hey.
9053000	9054000	Yeah.
9054000	9058000	You just have to ask yourself, how many hours am I really going to use it, and is it worth
9058000	9059000	it?
9059000	9060000	And only really you know the answer to that.
9060000	9062000	That's as far as we can help you.
9062000	9066000	Yeah, I think I'm probably going to go that route, but I just, but it's the same way as
9066000	9068000	when I upgraded my PC hardware.
9068000	9074000	I just wanted to have somebody on the outside come in and take a look at it from another
9074000	9075000	point of view.
9075000	9076000	Sure.
9076000	9077000	And I appreciate that.
9077000	9078000	You are welcome.
9078000	9082000	Anime Jam Sessions, Tuesday nights, hosted here at VOG Network.
9082000	9086000	And if you aren't already following the Anime Jam Sessions channel here on Twitch, y'all
9086000	9087000	should do that right away.
9087000	9088000	Thank you so much, Rama.
9088000	9090000	Always a pleasure to have you here.
9090000	9091000	Love it.
9091000	9092000	Take care, you guys.
9092000	9093000	Take care, buddy.
9093000	9094000	All right.
9094000	9096000	And I think Katsu Kahn is coming up real soon.
9096000	9099000	I think he said this weekend, so probably this coming weekend, President's Day weekend,
9099000	9103000	so I'm sure they'll have a lot to say on that over on Anime Jam Sessions.
9103000	9104000	Actually, Rama got me to go to that one year.
9104000	9105000	I had a good time.
9105000	9110000	I'd love to go again if I had the travel budget for it, but you know, only so much time off
9110000	9112000	available and so much money and so forth.
9112000	9114000	But Alan starts a new job tomorrow.
9114000	9115000	That's really exciting.
9115000	9116000	I'm very happy.
9116000	9118000	Yeah, I know he is really happy about that, too.
9118000	9122000	And we are happy to be at the end of another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
9122000	9124000	That's going to do it for our calls tonight.
9124000	9127000	Sorry to anyone that didn't get through, but I didn't see anybody else in there.
9127000	9132000	I know we've had a lot of the same callers week after week, but it's it's open to everybody.
9132000	9136000	You know, we are, as I say, we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
9136000	9138000	But you got to put your voices out there if you want to be heard.
9138000	9140000	So be it in our chat room.
9140000	9141000	Not everybody.
9141000	9142000	I know some people get shy.
9142000	9143000	I get it.
9143000	9144000	They don't want to have their voice at school.
9144000	9148000	But, you know, you can always lend us a thought in our chat room live.
9148000	9152000	Or if you aren't able to be here Sunday nights live with us because of other commitments,
9152000	9154000	we certainly do appreciate emails and tweets.
9154000	9155000	I don't always read the tweets on air.
9155000	9157000	I just kind of forget, honestly.
9157000	9161000	But I do reply like if you guys ask questions that like necessitate a reply.
9161000	9164000	I always try to go in and reply.
9164000	9167000	If you just say like, thanks, love the show, I'll usually favorite it.
9167000	9168000	It's like I read it.
9168000	9170000	Thank you type of thing.
9170000	9171000	And I do appreciate that stuff.
9171000	9173000	So, yeah.
9173000	9176000	So I guess that really brings us to the end of another show.
9176000	9180000	As I always say, thank you for supporting Orange Lounge Radio.
9180000	9186000	You can continue to support the show by leaving us a nice five star review on iTunes or wherever it is that you found this podcast.
9186000	9188000	I really appreciate that.
9188000	9192000	As far as Twitch goes, you know, we really appreciate the subscriptions and the biddies.
9192000	9193000	I saw some biddies come in tonight.
9193000	9195000	So thank you guys so much for all of that.
9195000	9197000	And that always goes a long way as well.
9197000	9199000	And again, if you can just tell your friends to subscribe.
9199000	9202000	The little hosts, a lot of you guys are hosting us on Sunday nights.
9202000	9203000	That is awesome.
9203000	9204000	That really helps as well.
9204000	9205000	And all of that goes a long way.
9205000	9209000	And we are looking at more ideas on how to grow out VOG Network on Twitch,
9209000	9212000	not just through us here at OLR and Mr. Bobby Black Wolf,
9212000	9217000	but through our other content providers that have historically been a part of the voice geeks network
9217000	9220000	and really excited to hopefully have some more stuff in the future.
9220000	9222000	Anyway, for now, it's time to wrap up.
9222000	9223000	So final thoughts time.
9223000	9225000	Loki, any final thoughts for you tonight?
9225000	9229000	I'm going to try to do more streaming because I know I'm just about to fill you.
9229000	9233000	I've got the followers now, but I need to get the hours day streaming
9233000	9238000	and number of people chatting at one time up.
9238000	9242000	I've been really bad about the streaming lately, honestly.
9242000	9247000	I've been so focused on this that I just haven't really had the time to do other stuff.
9247000	9249000	But I do really want to get back into that habit.
9249000	9250000	That's the problem is I'm falling out of the habit.
9250000	9253000	If you don't make it a habit, then you don't do it as much.
9253000	9257000	Yeah, so I need to do that, and I also need to be playing DDR more.
9257000	9259000	And I do want to stream other things.
9259000	9265000	I just have to figure out the setup with not disturbing the rest of my family when I do it and stuff.
9265000	9270000	Although I didn't think it was too crazy last time when I was streaming by myself.
9270000	9273000	So, well, we'll see.
9273000	9277000	Because I do want to do more Skyrim stuff because that was pretty fun.
9277000	9281000	And my final thought is I hope to do more VR gaming this week.
9281000	9285000	Because I bought a new one based off a Twitter recommendation I haven't been able to touch this week.
9285000	9289000	And then from watching your stream, I was like, oh yeah, I still need to play Skyrim VR.
9289000	9291000	Yeah, I still need to play Skyrim VR.
9291000	9293000	Let's do that this week.
9293000	9296000	So we can talk about a seven-year-old game again next week.
9296000	9299000	That'll be a lot of fun. But that's the way we game sometimes.
9299000	9302000	Anyway, that's going to do it for another episode here of Orange Lounge Radio.
9302000	9306000	Thank you guys again so much for either watching live or downloading and listening on the podcast feed.
9306000	9309000	We appreciate you guys so much and we'll be back to do it again in seven days.
9309000	9311000	On a three-day weekend nonetheless.
9311000	9313000	So that'll be a lot of fun. We'll see you next time, guys.
9313000	9315000	Have a good night everybody. Bye.
9336000	9338000	See you next week.
9366000	9368000	Thanks for watching.
