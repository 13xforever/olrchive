00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This week Valve learned of the existence of Blastbeat drummers. Noticing the movements tracked by Vive lighthouses was too stringent for very real possibilities by human players. This is just one human powered story, stay tuned for plenty more news starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Orange Lounge Radio

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 764 for this February the 17th of 2019.

4
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'm joined here in studio by Techmaster Loki. How are you, Loki?

5
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm here.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You're here.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You made it sound like you're almost not here. Are you doing okay?

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yes.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yes.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm fine.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You're just present in the moment.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I am present.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Did you have a good week?

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yeah, it was alright.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Good. You ready to go with the show? I noticed you have a Red Bull. Need a little energy, a little pick-me-up today.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
That's more of just to avoid a headache.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Ah.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Because I think I get like caffeine withdrawal headaches. Usually I'll drink like a soda a day.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Right, right.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And yeah, I'm very tired today because I've had a very busy weekend. I was doing hostings. I hosted a gig on Friday. I did a thing last night.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So I'm really like tired today. But thankfully I have my version of that. I have coffee. So that's very good.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Anyway, as you know, Dark Sakura has been out for a little bit. She hasn't been able to join the show due to a conflict in her work schedule a little bit.

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
So we really miss Dark Sakura and we hope she'll come back real soon to the program.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Wait, what was that? Is there a ghost in this house? What was? Oh my gosh, she's here live in studio.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Dark Sakura.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
She's squishing your head.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Jamie Summer is squishing my head once again on the cam because I was unable yet again to get everything organized for an over-the-shoulder shot.

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Hi, Rob!

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Like, stop it. It's a podcast. The podcast listeners can't see you putting unicorn faces on you.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You could take a hand puppet form in the show.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I know. There's all sorts of ideas. The idea is that the camera is going to move back over there so you'll just be able to see her back.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And if she chooses to wear a wig, you'll see the wig.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'll bring my Dr. Claw arm.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yeah, exactly.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But I've got a bunch of wigs now.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You know, I could bring the extension cord I have for my USB since I'm not using the rear camera on my cabinet.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Well, you can't use them with webcams.

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Sure you can.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Well, but it really degrades quality.

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
No, it doesn't.

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Really?

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,000
12 feet is what you can do. Or it's like 16 feet. I should know because I'm using... I have the exact same setup with that. I mean, come on.

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Alright, then let's compare notes later and we'll make it work.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Well, I was more preparing for Dark Sakura's return period in March.

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But I took a day off anyway for reasons.

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That's right. Well, I'm not complaining. You're here.

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You think I like working on Sunday?

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
No, of course not.

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
So now I'm going to be working on Saturday instead.

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm going to 4x10s at my job.

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
That's not so bad, though. You'll have that extra day off.

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Thursday, Friday, and Sunday off. I can deal with that.

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yeah. Alright, yeah.

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Wow, everybody in chat is reading me to filth over the extension thing, which goes against a lot of the stuff I read online.

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yeah, there's a limit.

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Rob, do you believe everything you read on the internet?

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yeah.

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:30,000
There is a limit. Yeah, you can't go over... I don't remember how much it is. It's like 16 feet or something.

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's a 5 foot extension cable, and I think the one I had with it was 8 feet.

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Alright, live tech support here on Orange Launch Radio with dummy Rob Roberts who can't get everything going.

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Why am I not seeing anybody chat? This is crazy.

62
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
If she really wanted to, Dark Sakura could come sit over here on the couch.

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And that's an if I really want to, and guess who doesn't really want to?

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
There you go.

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That would be...

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That's it. That's the other key thing, so that's fine.

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So, are people actually talking in the chat room? Because I don't see Jack.

68
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Yeah, are you in the VOG Network chat room? Because remember to...

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Oh, I'm on the Orange Launch Radio one. No, it says VOG Network.

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Probably because it's hosting VOG Network, but you actually have to be at twitch.tv slash vognetwork, where we do tape live every Sunday night.

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
That's where I am.

72
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
At 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackill show.

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I know where I'll be. Y'all certainly aren't here.

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Alright, well I don't...

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
There we go. Okay, well I said I picked stream chat, so whatever, we'll see.

76
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Alright, well hopefully you'll see it come up. You won't see all the history, you just see the new stuff that comes up.

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Well, no one in America pays attention to history, so there we go, there we go.

78
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Alright, you got it? You see me saying hi there in chat?

79
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yeah, that's all I got. I guess I'll deal with just Rob.

80
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Wow, it's a tech support episode of Orange Launch Radio. Chat rooms and webcams, extension cords, oh my.

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Well, apart from that though, apart from that, I do have a teensy amount of plugs to do, if that's cool.

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I suppose. How much are we getting paid?

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:07,000
We're not, but we owe these people big for past good deeds done in our direction, and they're our official lesbians.

84
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Farron, oh yes, I miss those folks. I miss them a lot. I know they used to be at the show all the time, so yeah, I miss them.

85
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
They moved. If they haven't been on Orange Launch Radio in a long time, because they moved to...

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
They live in the snow.

87
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yeah, they moved to the North Pole, essentially.

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Well, at least some lake up north.

89
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The other side of the wall.

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Not that far north.

91
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So, Chris and Megzi are doing an episodic podcast of their D&D games, called Let's Be Legendary.

92
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It is a steampunk Wild West setting that follows bounty hunters who are romantically involved.

93
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
There's a half-werewolf and a grave domain cleric who likes to screw with people's heads.

94
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
They have 36 episodes out and do a new one every Monday.

95
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
They put it on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Podbean, and Stitcher.

96
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And you can get to all the stuff at let'sbelegendarypodcast.com.

97
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And, of course, best of all, it is highly LGBTQ plus friendly.

98
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And also, Chris says, say hi to Rob. Hi, Rob.

99
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Thank you very much.

100
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
But yeah, I'd say check them out. They're really talented.

101
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:28,000
And there's art for it and everything. And they have a Facebook group that you can follow.

102
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's really just good fun.

103
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And honestly, they were my all-time favorite April Fool's prank we did on this show.

104
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Now, it was probably like 2006 or 2007.

105
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
We did the Giggling Lesbian Podcast.

106
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yeah, it was the Giggling Lesbian Gaming Show was what we did.

107
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And honestly, in retrospect, if you were listening to it now, you'd probably go,

108
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Ooh, this is problematic or whatever.

109
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:52,000
But that's part of what the joke was, was all the stereotypes about the girl gamers and lesbians and stuff.

110
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
We kind of did all of that in just a big 20-minute joke.

111
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
And it was really funny, so the listeners seemed to get a kick out of it.

112
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But on top of that, you know, they're just really lovely people.

113
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Of course.

114
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
And so, you know, go out and, you know, it's kind of a unique type of podcast.

115
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's one that we don't get a lot of.

116
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I mean, we do get episodic content out there, but we don't get a live D&D game too often.

117
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And on top of that, they're very creative. It's just a lot of fun.

118
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I think everyone should check them out.

119
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I only wish they'd started their gig like two years sooner because when VOG had the radio feed,

120
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I was dying for some type of like D&D serial type of podcast.

121
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
We could probably still make it work somehow.

122
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Well, but now there's no radio feed. It's just Twitch.

123
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
We could probably still make it work.

124
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Play it on Twitch.

125
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
We'll have our people call your people and our people will all discuss people things.

126
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And then there will be the Hokey Pokey.

127
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And then they have the new, was it Stranger Things D&D starter set that they have now?

128
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I saw that.

129
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Oh, yeah. I heard about that.

130
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It'll be fun.

131
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I think as a token, can we have like a monster named after me on the next episode?

132
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Would that be appropriate?

133
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I should try to dictate the narrative.

134
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Dear friends, make a monster called Rob.

135
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yeah, we want a cameo.

136
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
And it's iridescent with a horn.

137
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
All right.

138
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
We don't know where the horn is, but there's one.

139
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And what Bobby is saying in our chat.

140
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And by the way, I think we may actually have a cameo from,

141
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
oh, yeah, that's got to be Chris in the chat right now saying I will do that.

142
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Good to see you.

143
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Bobby in chat says, I think half the podcasts of Dragon Con podcast track are D&D live plays.

144
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's gotten really popular in the last few years.

145
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Oh, for sure. Yeah, it's it's definitely a growing genre.

146
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And that's a great it's a great thing.

147
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I know people love to listen to that stuff.

148
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I've learned anything from the gaming industry.

149
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It's a jump on that bandwagon when you can, you know, even if it's too late.

150
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You know what, though?

151
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You know what? No one would listen to because of all the math and physics involved in it.

152
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
A rifts podcast.

153
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
If anyone's played rifts, you know what I'm talking about.

154
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And if you have played rifts, I am so freaking sorry, unless you're like a physics major and then go have at it.

155
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Do you know that rifts was my first tabletop game?

156
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
No, I didn't know that.

157
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Well, OK. I was in another one, but I didn't have to roll my own dice because the guy was like an absolute control freak.

158
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
But but rifts was my first tabletop game.

159
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And I did have to freak and sit out with a graphing calculator to do all of my stuff because I was playing a new class.

160
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It was like some battle mage, which, by the way, I got the rest of the party killed. And it was great.

161
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I remember. OK, we will get into the true neutral.

162
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
We need to get into the Nintendo Direct, but I will go on a D&D tangent.

163
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And this one's for our pals over at the Let's Be Legendary podcast.

164
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
My first D&D I ever played was Planeswalker. Does that sound right?

165
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Well, in Planescape. That's D&D.

166
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
That's it. Planescape.

167
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
That's D&D.

168
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And I remember I was in high school and it was a bunch of dudes like nerds. We all didn't fit anywhere else.

169
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Did you play a tifling Rob?

170
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I was the only one willing to play a female.

171
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So everybody else was male and I was female.

172
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So, of course, they wanted to be like, well, I'm going to hit on your character stuff.

173
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And I said, you know what? I'm a lesbian. Don't bother.

174
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So I remember that was one of my first D&D experiences was like that.

175
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Stop. Stop trying to get awkward in here.

176
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So you had to be very now that I can finally see your name right.

177
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I was talking about AOL chat rooms with the dice roll feature.

178
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So, girl, let me tell you a thing real quick thing.

179
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
All right. Real quick.

180
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
The Nintendo back right.

181
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Actually, just before I met Dan, I was a AOL chat room role player.

182
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And we used to have sparring in the various Sailor Moon or Kuno's Island for a while or then it became the right in sparring ring.

183
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
And this was after Dan and I were just starting to get together.

184
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:46,000
But I used to I still have like tons of characters that even to this day, people still know who they are because they were kind of.

185
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,000
We had prominent characters that hung out in that chat room originals after a while, because just doing the characters and games already kind of were boring.

186
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
But you throw them in that universe and change things up a bit. But yeah, I did dice bars and we did games like that.

187
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
And we even did Digimon game with dice rolling nerd.

188
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Gee, Rob, what show is this?

189
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Ask how long it's been running.

190
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Well, since everyone's talking about.

191
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Ask what game it started around.

192
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Since everyone's been talking about D&D.

193
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I mean, the one game that I remember why we played a D&D game.

194
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:29,000
It didn't get very far, but I remember the character that I played was Malcolm the Evil Jester from Chirandia, the old PC game.

195
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And so I had a deck of cards that was like a, you know, magical deck of cards that did different things depending on which card you pulled.

196
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It was fun.

197
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I just remember when we did a Dragonlance game that we were really bored one night.

198
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And so we played three kinder and a fairy dragon.

199
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:54,000
And I don't know if anyone would you call me kinder are really annoying kleptomaniac races who always tell the same stories about things.

200
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
They're kind of like really chibi like elf elf, but not like cool elves.

201
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,000
They're like, we wish we were elves, but we were a gigantic mistake of magic elf.

202
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm a cool elf.

203
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
No, they were a gigantic mistake of magic.

204
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Seriously, in the series they are.

205
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
And they're just really annoying, but can be really awesome.

206
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
So we had the kleptomaniac Taro or Taro or was it?

207
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
All right.

208
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I don't even know what the hell they're called in Final Fantasy 14.

209
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You turned a 30 second plug into a five minute tangent.

210
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
That's all right.

211
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Have you just started listening to this show?

212
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I mean, it's serious.

213
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You're right. It's my first time here.

214
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
All right.

215
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Let's move on.

216
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I think Bobby's field is a savings throw.

217
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
All right, let's move on.

218
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
We got to talk about because there's a lot of gaming news this week, actually.

219
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And it all started with the Nintendo Direct, which last week we talked about as a rumor.

220
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And some of y'all, Bobby Blackwell, were like, why are you talking about rumors?

221
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Because rumors don't happen.

222
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm paraphrasing some of my own words in there.

223
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Unless it's Fleetwood Mac.

224
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
But it turns out there really was a Nintendo Direct last week, and there was a lot of news.

225
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Now, what we didn't necessarily know from all the rumors was exactly what was going to be discussed.

226
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And there was some pretty big announcements.

227
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Dark Sakura, I think you wanted to touch on probably what was the biggest announcement out of the whole thing, right?

228
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Hold on, I have to say, Shun the Disbeliever in chat real quick.

229
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Okay.

230
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Oh, take your time.

231
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's just a live show.

232
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Okay. Shun! Shun!

233
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Anyway, so there was a lot of excitement over this one.

234
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And even I might have peed my pants a little bit. Just kidding.

235
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
It's actually a game I never finished.

236
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
And I never finished it because at the time I had shit to do.

237
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
But The Legend of Zelda, Link's Awakening, though, that's pretty big news.

238
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It is getting a full-on, you know, that 2.5D remake quality rendered stuff, prettiness.

239
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Yeah, it's kind of a new look for Zelda.

240
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's kind of like, imagine if the Super Nintendo look or the link between...

241
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I would put this more GameCube-ish, because it's very simple 3D.

242
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. But I meant like that look, but like then enhanced in a cartoony...

243
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You know what it actually reminded me of? If you ever played that, what was it, 3D.bit Game Heroes?

244
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It's 3D.Game Heroes.

245
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Was that at 3D.Game Heroes?

246
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
But like with actuals, because that was a Zelda rip-off game, or excuse me, Zelda-inspired game.

247
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
But now like an actual like Zelda with that.

248
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Even better, though, this is going to be out on the Switch this year.

249
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Although where the hell is my Animal Crossing, y'all?

250
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Gotta wait for E3 for that one, I'm pretty sure.

251
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Anyway, so, but a lot of people are really excited about it.

252
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'm really excited. I never actually got a chance to finish it.

253
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I mean, I know how it ends, but it's funny.

254
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I sent the picture to Dan and he's like, oh, this is cool.

255
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
And then I was like, weaned fish.

256
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
He's like, that fish is so windy.

257
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
So obviously this is the Game Boy game that they're remaking for the Switch.

258
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Yes.

259
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Which, you know, there's certainly going to be that part that's like,

260
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
but a Game Boy game's kind of, you know, aged a bit.

261
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,000
But didn't we just have on the 3DS not that long ago, we had Metroid 2, Return of Samus.

262
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Had its reimagining that was released on the 3DS.

263
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You know, I can't help but wonder, could this have been originally planned for 3DS?

264
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
But because things are slowing down a little bit on that front,

265
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
they did the right thing and moved it over to Switch,

266
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
which is definitely the right place to put something like this out.

267
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
But Game Boy reimaginings all these years later are certainly not unheard of at Nintendo.

268
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Well, I mean, you know, the big trend right now is just, you know, remakes and rehashes.

269
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
But I hope that they do something else with the story to make it a little bit better.

270
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I mean, how many remakes and rereleases and things have been just announced or have already come out?

271
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I'll cut Nintendo a little more slack in that department

272
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,000
because when they have done the, like, reimaginings, like, in both Metroid instances,

273
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Metroid Zero Mission and Metroid 2, Return of Samus,

274
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
they really felt like new games just with the old narrative

275
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
because they would add either new mechanics or, like,

276
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
in Zero Mission you had that whole post storyline with the Chozo and all this stuff.

277
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You know, I feel like I'll let Nintendo have a pass

278
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
because they've never really disappointed me unless they made it very clear,

279
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
like, when they did the Zelda Wind Waker HD remaster and that's, like, all they did.

280
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
And they called it HD remaster. That's it.

281
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
But even in that one, they still kind of, like, they added fast travel.

282
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Well, yeah, and the Metroid 2 remake was pretty awesome.

283
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Yeah, yeah.

284
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
So I'm definitely hyped for this.

285
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And this was just, I mean, I don't think anybody could have called this.

286
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Now we need to see a Super Mario Land remake or...

287
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You think?

288
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I'm surprised we haven't seen it.

289
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I would be willing to bet that that's maybe going to be in Mario Maker 2.

290
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Well, let's talk about, if we, anything else we want to say on Zelda?

291
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Not really. I mean, what we see is what we get.

292
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
There's the trailer showing off some of the graphics.

293
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
There's just all kinds of, all kinds of good stuff.

294
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Well, then let's move into some of the other announcements here.

295
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Before I go to Loki, I want to read this comment from Kaijuto over at our chat at twitch.tv slash vog network,

296
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
who says they remake stuff because fans ask for them all the time.

297
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I suppose that's part of it.

298
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
As long as they do the remake right.

299
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You know, like, I'll get into this when we do our gaming weeks,

300
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
but the Resident Evil 2 remake is, I can't gush on it enough.

301
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It's beautiful.

302
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Okay.

303
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Especially with, you know, proper skull rendering and bullet physics.

304
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Hold that thought. Let's do some of the other Nintendo Direct News.

305
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You touched on Mario Maker 2, so that was another big announcement.

306
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Which is part of the rumor too, funny enough.

307
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Yeah, that was like one of the first things that they showed off was Mario Maker 2,

308
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
and it looks awesome. They added a bunch of new things to the game, different game modes.

309
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Now they have a Super Mario 3D World type style, I guess, of the game.

310
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
They've got a...

311
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Oh, I didn't see that there was a 3D World. That's cool.

312
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Yeah, well, it's still 2D, but the style is 3D.

313
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
That's where they have the cat Mario.

314
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Okay.

315
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
And then they have slopes, and they've added new enemies.

316
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
The sun was there.

317
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
The sun is there.

318
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Clear pipes, I saw, yeah.

319
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
They have a desert is one of the themes as well.

320
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
And then, I don't know, just lots of good stuff.

321
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
So is this kind of maybe more like Super Mario Maker Plus?

322
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I think there's enough that they've changed.

323
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Yeah.

324
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I feel like there's this interesting thing that they're doing on the Switch,

325
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
and I feel it happened a little bit with Splatoon 2,

326
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
happened a little bit with Super Smash Brothers, honestly,

327
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
is that they kind of took what really worked in the Wii U game,

328
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
and honestly, I'm not going to say they copy-pasted,

329
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
because obviously we know more goes into the programming than that,

330
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
but they kind of took a base and added all this other flavor around it

331
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
to make a new experience.

332
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And I think that's kind of what we're getting with this,

333
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
or it seems from the early trailer what we're getting from this Mario Maker 2.

334
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Yeah, and it's good to see that it's actually coming out,

335
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
and I know the worry was before that,

336
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,000
well, how is that going to translate from touchscreen to actual TV?

337
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
They've got this new radial menu that they're using now,

338
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
which looks pretty cool.

339
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
But you can also do a touchscreen.

340
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Well, right, you can do it on that for handheld mode, too,

341
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
but they do have the radial thing if you want to do that.

342
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
And it's hinted, but they don't really talk about it,

343
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
but you'll notice that Mario Maker 2 has both Mario and Luigi on the front,

344
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
meaning maybe we'll see some two-player co-op in there.

345
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Which I kind of hypothesized in the last episode

346
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
that it would be cool to have the player versus player,

347
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
but your shadows, you don't really run into each other.

348
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Yeah.

349
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Yeah, that would be cool.

350
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I hope there's something like that.

351
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
That's something that they had.

352
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And then along with that, there was also some stuff that they showed off for,

353
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
well, they had demos that they announced.

354
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
So they had a Daemon X Machina Switch demo that came out,

355
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
as well as a demo for the new Yoshi Crafted World.

356
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,000
They showed off, they were talking about Smash Bros. Ultimate 3.0 update.

357
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
There's a lot of other games that are just kind of, eh, okay.

358
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Rune Factory, they announced a new one.

359
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
You know, some people get really into those, though.

360
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
On my Twitter feed, maybe you're not a big fan of Rune Factory.

361
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I got friends that were hype about that.

362
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Final Fantasy VII, they announced dates for that,

363
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
as well as Choco-bo Mystery Dungeon.

364
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
And then Final Fantasy IX came out that day.

365
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
That was a big...

366
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Yeah, they did quite a few, like, it's out today announcements,

367
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
whether it was a demo or, you know, 21 bucks for Final Fantasy IX,

368
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
or I'm sure you'll get to it here in a minute, but Tetris 99, obviously.

369
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Tetris 99 was a big announcement.

370
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Yeah.

371
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
And like Battle Royale Tetris game.

372
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Yeah, and it was interesting because it's only for the Nintendo Online subscribers.

373
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
And we just had been talking about on the show a couple weeks ago

374
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
about how Nintendo's investors were kind of pressuring them

375
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
to do some things to make that service a little sweeter.

376
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
And so people were saying,

377
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
oh, it's going to be Super Nintendo games on the service.

378
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
But I think it's kind of nice to see games that are being designed

379
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
for the service as like a free, you know, type of experience.

380
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
And so, I mean, I don't think anybody could have thought,

381
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
oh, Tetris as a Battle Royale game is something Nintendo should do for online.

382
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
But now that it's here, it's kind of like,

383
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
this is a very Nintendo way to do it.

384
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Yes, this is good.

385
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
They showed off some of the content for Dragon Quest 11.

386
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
That's going to be exclusive to the platform.

387
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Oh, yeah, that retro mode. That's a big deal.

388
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Yeah, that's kind of different.

389
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Again, they're taking like the 3DS stuff

390
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
and now they're putting it on the, because in Japan it was on 3DS,

391
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
and now they're going to put it on the Switch as like,

392
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I think instead of like a dual screen,

393
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
it'll kind of be something you can flip back and forth between.

394
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
And that's really cool.

395
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
If only they could go back and redo the soundtrack,

396
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
which I guess, well, I guess they are kind of doing that.

397
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Yeah, well, they have.

398
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I mean, they need like new music.

399
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Right, right. Sorry.

400
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I was going to say also they announced Deltarune coming to the Switch.

401
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
They've got some new Fire Emblem Three Houses game.

402
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Announced a date for that in July.

403
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Assassin's Creed 3 remasters coming to the Switch.

404
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Fun.

405
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Starlink Battle for Atlas, which I...

406
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
They're still trying to push that game.

407
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Well, it's not Star Fox, but...

408
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
But they've got a lot of Star Fox content in there,

409
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
but I don't think anyone gives a shit about it, but whatever.

410
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Okay, but you say that you're projecting what you think on everybody out there.

411
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Is anybody in chat a fan of Starlink?

412
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Set Loki straight.

413
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
All two of you out there.

414
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,000
They showed off a Disney Tsum Tsum festival, which is...

415
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I kind of like thought that was interesting.

416
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Because I like the Tsum Tsum arcade game at round one.

417
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
And like, have you ever seen those little collectibles?

418
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
No.

419
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
They're cute.

420
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
No, I have not.

421
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
What else?

422
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Box boy and box girl coming to the Switch.

423
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And they announce Captain Marvel is going to be

424
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
part of the cast of Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3,

425
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
which is like, duh.

426
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Of course.

427
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Of course.

428
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Of course.

429
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Some comments in chat on Starlink.

430
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Bobby Blackwell says,

431
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I have a friend who's a huge fan of Starlink on the Switch.

432
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
He has like 85 hours in it.

433
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
So Bobby knows a guy.

434
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
There's one.

435
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Let's see.

436
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Act F says,

437
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I got Starlink with the AR wing for $25 on Amazon.

438
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
MNZeba says,

439
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I am interested in Starlink.

440
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Thank you, MNZeba.

441
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
VG Realness says,

442
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Nintendo has full on stolen Starlink

443
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
and just made it their game now.

444
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I made this.

445
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
You made this.

446
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I made this.

447
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Yes, they did.

448
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
They did do that.

449
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I think that's why, you know,

450
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
originally when Starfox was in there,

451
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
that was the whole reason people bought it.

452
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
It's like, oh, hey, Starfox.

453
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
You know, it wasn't because,

454
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Oh my God, Starlink.

455
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Yeah.

456
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I needed this.

457
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
And Big Red Pimp says,

458
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I enjoyed Starlink.

459
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Still playing it too.

460
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
So there's,

461
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
there's a few people in chat who are,

462
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
have at least some,

463
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
some tepid excitement about it.

464
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Yeah.

465
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
They had some other games that they showed off as well.

466
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I'm not,

467
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I know they had a new game by,

468
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Oh God.

469
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
I can't remember the name of the studio now.

470
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
The platinum game?

471
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Yeah.

472
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
The new platinum.

473
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Yeah.

474
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
That looked pretty awesome.

475
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Yeah, sure did.

476
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Although I was hoping maybe it would be Bayonetta 3 stuff,

477
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
but they already talked about Bayonetta 3.

478
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
So yeah, they, they did talk about that before.

479
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
And I don't know if,

480
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I don't think it's on the show world tonight.

481
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
No, it's not.

482
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
And,

483
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
but it was on discord.

484
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
If you're on the VOG network discord,

485
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
there was some chatter about this in the OLR channel,

486
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
about how it seems like the director or who was assumed to be

487
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
directing Bayonetta 3 is no longer with platinum games.

488
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
And had posted a thing on his Twitter about I'm no longer,

489
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
you know, with the studio or whatever.

490
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
So there may have been some switcheroo that, I mean,

491
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
may have set Bayonetta 3 back. Don't know.

492
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I mean, I don't want to make stuff up, but it definitely seems like,

493
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
you know, with the change in staffing,

494
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
there could be some things that are,

495
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
they're putting a little bump in Bayonetta 3's development,

496
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
but you know what? Take the time to get it right.

497
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
It's just fine.

498
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Exactly.

499
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
And I do like the fact that a lot of the stuff that they're showing off

500
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
were indie games as well.

501
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
So that's pretty cool that they had all that like a focus,

502
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
but I mean, yes, a lot of the directs are like that.

503
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Um, but yeah, I mean that probably that's a good portion of it.

504
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I don't know if we've missed anything in huge in particular, but.

505
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
What'd you guys think? And I'll open this question up to chat as well.

506
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
And Dark Soccer, I don't know if you,

507
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
you watched the director just kind of saw the headlines, but overall,

508
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
like what'd you guys think of the direct?

509
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Like, did you think it was a good presentation?

510
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Do you think it was a waste of 30 minutes?

511
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
No, I think it was good.

512
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Yeah.

513
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I thought it was good.

514
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
There was a lot of big announcements packed in 30 minutes.

515
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
It's.

516
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I don't usually think many of the directs are bad anyway.

517
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Yeah.

518
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
So.

519
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Yeah.

520
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Um, I thought, I actually thought it was like a strong direct.

521
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I thought it was like, this was probably on par,

522
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
if not past some of their E3 directs, honestly.

523
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Like, and I'm talking, I'm not talking like E3 recently,

524
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
cause they've been pretty strong recently,

525
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
but like in some of the Wii U years where it was a little weaker,

526
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I think this direct was probably stronger than some of those E3 years.

527
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
So, um, I did a really good job.

528
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
So, and, um,

529
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:57,000
very interesting to see how E3 is like more and more becoming like a

530
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
footnote for some.

531
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
So I think we're going to start to see more announcements, big stuff,

532
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
definitely outside the June period. I mean, again,

533
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I don't think it's on the show world tonight, but, uh, there was a,

534
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
it was a pretty, um, I don't know,

535
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
it was a pretty interesting comment from, um, one of the heads up at Sony.

536
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I don't remember if it was Shawn Layton or somebody else. I apologize.

537
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I don't remember in the moment,

538
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
but basically laid it out on why they weren't going to E3.

539
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
And it was basically, you know,

540
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
kind of about that E3 is not what it used to be. It's not like they, they,

541
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
they get all the retailers at their own event now.

542
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
And it's not like it's not what it was. So, uh,

543
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
it's going to be interesting to see more of a calendar year full of these big

544
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
bang announcements as opposed to holding everything for June. Huh? Yeah. Yeah.

545
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Uh, let's see, going to our chat, uh,

546
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Bobby Black Wolf in chat says Intellivision is going to have a larger E3

547
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
presence than Sony. You know what though, for something like that,

548
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
I'm fine with that actually.

549
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
For something like Intellivision that actually makes a lot of sense because if

550
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
E3 is going to be more about gamers and starting to get, uh, like, you know,

551
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
more like regular people, so to speak out on the floor as well as, you know,

552
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I don't know, uh, bloggers and YouTubers and things like that. Like, you know,

553
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Intellivision is going to be kind of challenged with, uh,

554
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
and the Amico and all this stuff is just kind of challenged with finding its

555
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
niche and getting the message about where they see themselves with gamers. Right.

556
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
And taking your case directly to the gamers is not a bad idea.

557
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:30,000
So like aside from indie game studios having to really focus on trying to get

558
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
their game out on as many platforms as possible,

559
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
let's just like completely ignore that for a second here.

560
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,000
What seems to be driving a lot of these game, you know,

561
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:45,000
major game hardware publishers and their consoles between their releases of games.

562
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
It's all the indie games.

563
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,000
So if you get a console that's basically able to get all those indie games on it,

564
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
um, then I think that's really going to be a strong console.

565
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,000
But the problem is they're also everywhere else. So, you know, you have that.

566
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
But I think that they were doing some stuff that was supposed to be exclusive to it.

567
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Well, I also think this is one place where the Switch has really succeeded

568
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
and why it's done better than the Wii U in so many ways is because it got in with

569
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
those indies early on. And yes, even though it might be like, you know,

570
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
something like Wargroove or whatever is essentially the same game on the Switch

571
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,000
as is on the PlayStation 4, the fact that, you know, you're thinking in the back of your head,

572
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
oh, well, if I buy it on the Switch, I have it portable and on the TV,

573
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
like that really kind of clinches the deal for a lot of people.

574
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
So I think that's, even though something might be available on multiple platforms,

575
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,000
um, we'll see. So it'll be interesting to see if Sony or Microsoft with PlayStation 5

576
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
try to do something like that. I'm not saying they're going to like jack the Switch,

577
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
but what about something that you have like a cell phone app where you can tap into your console

578
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
and do a limited amount of things. I don't know. I'm going...

579
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:00,000
No phone apps. Stop with the phone apps. I'll take a Vita 2. I don't want the phone apps.

580
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I know. I'm going a little crazy and tinfoil hatty, but, you know, it happens.

581
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Uh, let's see. Some other comments in chat. VGRealness says, uh, LOL, remember the E3?

582
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,000
They talked about Woolly World for like 20 minutes and had the woman who made the giant amiibo talk

583
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,000
for like ever the dark years. Maybe it wasn't E3, but it was a direct. And I was like, wow.

584
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,000
That's a lot of these. And it's not even just necessarily Nintendo, but there's a lot of these.

585
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,000
EA, um, where they'll bring out, you know, FIFA players and they'll talk forever about FIFA, which is fine.

586
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I guess people like FIFA around the world mean it's, you know, the soccer is the number one sports game.

587
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:41,000
You know, so that's what we call soccer. That's fine. But even if like, OK, like for me, no,

588
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
actually, no, you're right. If they're talking with the thought of for 20 minutes, I'd be fine with that, too.

589
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
But it depends. Like if they're talking about the game, then I'd be fine with that.

590
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,000
But if it's just like I'm to do the create a grant, the daughter, let me talk about 20 minutes about bullshit.

591
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,000
You know, then I don't really care about it. Yeah, no. If they were to and Jamie's going to back me up on this.

592
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
If they were to come out and say, we're going to be doing a guardian legend remaster.

593
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,000
I'm going to be like, oh, I need I need you to spend the next hour going over the following details.

594
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
How are you inspired by the original? What's the soundtrack going to be like?

595
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Tell me about the character. Like, I want to make sure you will there be a low low.

596
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I don't want to make sure you're just remastering one of the greatest, most underlooked eight big titles of all time.

597
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I want to make sure you're fucking doing it right, because I've been let down.

598
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
I was still mad about that project that got shut down. Yeah, right.

599
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:34,000
So anyway, imagine somebody like just tuned in on Twitch and heard us talking about guardian legend remaster.

600
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Got really excited for a minute. Sorry, I was talking about.

601
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
But you should be really, really excited about the guardian legend in general.

602
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Just go back and play the original. Just to be honest, don't play guardic because it's not great in all of its MSX non-scrolling glory.

603
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
It's the reason why we have what we have anyway.

604
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Yeah, they learned from their mistakes. All right.

605
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
If we don't have anything else to say on the Nintendo Direct, then I think we're good.

606
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I think we'll move on to the types of games we have been playing this week, be it the guardian legend or something else.

607
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
And I'll start with you, dark soccer. How was your gaming week?

608
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Well, the the ghost survivor dropped for Resident Evil two, and it's some pretty good what if stuff.

609
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
It's basically you've got three scenarios to start off with.

610
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:27,000
One of them is the about to be embalmed woman that you find somewhere in the game who's already dead.

611
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
But you play her having survived and escaping.

612
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:38,000
And then another one is the cop that like that you find dead right at the start of the game.

613
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:45,000
That's not really a spoiler. So you actually play him escaping and, you know, getting out.

614
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,000
And then another umbrella person also escaping these scenarios are pretty hard.

615
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:57,000
And you get like vendor zombies, these zombies wandering around with backpacks and you shoot them and you get stuff.

616
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:06,000
You also do have vending machines that you can. Oh, you can get a flash grenade or a chemical flamethrower.

617
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,000
If I got a chemical flamethrower out of the vending machine, I'd be like, shit, yeah, but no.

618
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:19,000
And then, like, if you beat all three, then you get like another thing actually to get back one of the one of the other ones.

619
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:25,000
I think that was the the the one with the cop. I think that was the special edition one.

620
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
But there's another one where you can play like Richard Kendo, the guy who owns the gun shop.

621
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:37,000
And, you know, his issues with his family is his part of the story made me cry, not cry, like for real, but like, oh.

622
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
And then we got another pimple.

623
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
We sold the getaway.

624
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
You might have a problem if.

625
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
No, we traded.

626
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I think it's no, I think it's rad. You guys.

627
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
We have a Ghostbusters pro edition.

628
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Oh, wow.

629
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
So Ghostbusters is a really, really good table and I'm super happy we have it.

630
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Is that the one that makes it? I could be right. Is that mix the new and the old?

631
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
No, no, it's all the old.

632
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
It's just the old. OK.

633
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Yeah, it's a really fun table.

634
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:11,000
And the thing that I like is that the pin that was in the the firehouse in the movie is actually on the little painted window in the firehouse in the game.

635
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
So it's pretty cool.

636
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:20,000
And then that's really been about the extent I've had a lot of projects going on in some drama.

637
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
So that's been the extent of it.

638
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Sounds good. Well, except the drama part, but the game stuff sounds good.

639
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:32,000
If drama was a person, it could sit on a dildo made of sandpaper and spin for an hour.

640
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
OK, wow.

641
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Anyway, thanks for that visual. Moving on.

642
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

643
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
It was all right. I played a lot of Crackdown three.

644
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I did stream some of it as well.

645
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,000
It's running OK on my PC, but it's I don't know.

646
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I'm surprised how much it definitely makes the fans rev up.

647
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Sounds like I have a jet engine taking off, but I like it.

648
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
It's really fun. The reviews haven't been so great for it, though.

649
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Everyone complains about it. I don't know.

650
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:09,000
I really think that they really overhyped the whole like, oh, the cloud.

651
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
We need the cloud to be able to process all the epicness.

652
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
No, no, you don't.

653
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I haven't played the multiplayer mode yet, but I've watched video online and it's just it's neat.

654
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,000
But there's other aside from it being like a tech demo for here's what we can do with the cloud

655
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,000
and processing destruction stuff, which, to be honest, the same type of destruction.

656
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,000
You can probably see that in Battlefield, all those games and stuff with their destruction engine.

657
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I just think that other people have done it way better and it's been out for a while.

658
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,000
But the game itself is fun. It's Crackdown.

659
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
If you played Crackdown, do you know what this is?

660
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Plus, it has Terry Crews being extra and it's awesome.

661
00:34:51,000 --> 00:35:00,000
The beginning cinematic with Terry Crews in it had me grinning pretty wide.

662
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
So it's pretty awesome.

663
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I have yet to check this out. I really want to check out Crackdown 3.

664
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I'm just like, you know, cost and all that stuff.

665
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
But you were doing a live stream the other night, right?

666
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Yes, I was for VR.

667
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Sadly, I was hosting a show I couldn't watch, but I saw a little thing came up on my notifications.

668
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I wanted to watch it.

669
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Yes, so I did do that for a little bit because I'm trying to get my affiliate thing still.

670
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I still need more people chatting and watching.

671
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
What else? I played a little DDR this week.

672
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
That's pretty much it. I downloaded Tetris 99.

673
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I didn't get a chance to play it and I still haven't played any Kingdom Hearts.

674
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Hopefully, I do actually play some of it because I'm worried it's going to end up being

675
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
like a lot of the other games I buy and don't play.

676
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Whatever. But Crackdown 3, though, I've been playing quite a bit.

677
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I've gotten through...

678
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
It's a lot harder than the very first Crackdown game.

679
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
You could just blow through that super fast.

680
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,000
You go to the lieutenants. It's just like you literally sprint to the lieutenants headquarters

681
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
and just kill them instantly and done.

682
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
It's like awesome.

683
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
This is a little bit more involved.

684
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
I like the way they have it set up because Saints Row did steal a lot from Crackdown

685
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
as far as how they set up where you do small little activities

686
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,000
to build towards taking on a boss and stuff.

687
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,000
They do that with a lot of the gangs and the side missions.

688
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Same thing with Crackdown. You have to take over certain parts of the map.

689
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
As you do that, it weakens the boss that you're going to fight.

690
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Then when you defeat the boss, it weakens the big boss.

691
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I took out this AI that was controlling all of these monorail terminals.

692
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Because I took over the AI, these moving platforms that were frozen in this building

693
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
are now moving because I did that.

694
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
It sounds kind of like Zelda Breath of the Wild in a little bit of a way.

695
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,000
You can run to the final boss if you want. It's really hard.

696
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:06,000
But if you take out the big machine dungeon things, then it makes it easier.

697
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Yeah, it's sort of like that.

698
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
It'll be interesting. And of course all the orbs and stuff are pretty fun.

699
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
But yeah, I'm really enjoying it.

700
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
So I'll try to stream some more of that.

701
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I was going to do that earlier today, too.

702
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
But my family didn't end up leaving when I needed them to.

703
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I was going to do it before the show because I thought it would be the perfect time to do that.

704
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Whoops.

705
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Alright.

706
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Well, my gaming week, I did play a little bit of Tetris 99.

707
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
It's going to come up again later in the show in a little pre-recorded segment.

708
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
So I won't get too far into that.

709
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
But I am enjoying it. I'll say that.

710
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Even though it's very bare bones, very simple, I do hope they are looking to expand on it later.

711
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Which I understand they may have found some things in data mining.

712
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
So that would be good.

713
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
That would be good if they expand on that in the future.

714
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
But I've enjoyed what little I've played of Tetris 99 so far.

715
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Been continuing World of Warcraft.

716
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
That's kind of my old standby time waster.

717
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Because I'm not really playing Final Fantasy XIV right now.

718
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
That's on the back burner until the expansion release.

719
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I got my shaman up to level 120.

720
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Been world questing, trying to get my gear up.

721
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
You have no idea what any of this means, huh?

722
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Just wow things.

723
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Just wow things.

724
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
So I've been playing that.

725
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
And then the good old cell phone games too, like Pokemon Go.

726
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Nobody brought up Community Day.

727
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
I'll mention the Community Day was yesterday.

728
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
And it was really low key.

729
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
What was it?

730
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Oh, that's why I kept seeing those around.

731
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I just thought it was like the Chinese New Year crap.

732
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, right?

733
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
No, that was Community Day was yesterday.

734
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
I guess that was a few weeks ago.

735
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
I was reminded though, I'm so mad.

736
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Because I had such a busy day yesterday, as did Alan.

737
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Is that I did all my trainer battles and got the Sinnoh Stones from those.

738
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
And I did one PvP battle with Alan.

739
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
But I forgot to do four more.

740
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
So I missed out on those extra Sinnoh Stones.

741
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
And I'm really pressed about it because I still have stuff I need to evolve.

742
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
But I did get five shinies during the event.

743
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
And really we took it easy.

744
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,000
You know, Shane, the shiny hunter friend of mine, moved.

745
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
So he's doing Community Day elsewhere now.

746
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
But it's not really go, go, go, go, go.

747
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
We got to get shinies.

748
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
He would always kind of end up going off on his own anyway.

749
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
But yeah, we kind of were like really lazy.

750
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
And once we got like three shinies, we were like eh.

751
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
And so we ended up raiding for the last hour of it.

752
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Because Alan and I still didn't have the Palika.

753
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Sorry, I forget the name of that boss that's out right now.

754
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
We didn't have it yet still.

755
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,000
So because we were downtown, there's lots of people around.

756
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
It was a really good chance to raid.

757
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
And so I got one on the first raid finally.

758
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
And Alan got one on the second raid.

759
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
So we were like, okay, well that actually feels like just...

760
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
That almost feels like more of an accomplishment than the shinies.

761
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Because we needed that for the Pokédex.

762
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
So that was good.

763
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Still quite a few people out.

764
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
But I feel like it wasn't as crowded this time as it was before.

765
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
It's Swinub, so no one gives a crap about it.

766
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I think it's part that and part the fact that rain was in the forecast.

767
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:05,000
And maybe just the fact that Pokémon GO has had a lot of like go, go, go stuff lately.

768
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000
And I don't know, like I don't want to say Pokémon GO is dying.

769
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
It's not, but it's probably starting to...

770
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,000
You know, I'm not sure their strategy of drip feeding the Gen 4 Pokémon

771
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
and then forcing you to use stones to evolve a lot of them.

772
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
And a lot of them I still haven't been...

773
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Which, how do you get those?

774
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:30,000
You have to do either trainer battles or you do the PvP battles with friends that are 3 stars or higher.

775
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,000
And they're not guaranteed.

776
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
But the Sinnoh stones?

777
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
No, you can also get them by completing the weekly challenge things too.

778
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I've done those too and haven't gotten them.

779
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
It's a 20% drop rate from that.

780
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I've gotten a few.

781
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I know.

782
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
All of mine are from that.

783
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I did the trainer battles with the heads of each of the groups or whatever.

784
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
And those are stupid easy.

785
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Shut the front door.

786
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Act F says you can still do battles to get Sinnoh stones today.

787
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Really?

788
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Well we might have to do that later.

789
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Before Dark Sakura leaves.

790
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I'll battle her.

791
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Help her get some Sinnoh stones.

792
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Because I want them too.

793
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
So you don't have to win.

794
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
You just have to do them.

795
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Which is really weird.

796
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
So you get participation trophies.

797
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
It's all Pidgeys.

798
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I'm gonna do all Pidgeys.

799
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Yeah, sure.

800
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Why?

801
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Why not?

802
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
It's getting destroyed.

803
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Anyhow, so that's enough of my gaming week.

804
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I suppose that's all I really need to say about that.

805
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
So we will get into some gaming news.

806
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I don't have a lot to say for any type of housekeeping stuff.

807
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Just the good old always follow us on Twitter at OLR.

808
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
And of course we are on Twitch every week.

809
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Sunday nights at VOG Network.

810
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
So please follow us at VOG Network.

811
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,000
And we do really appreciate all you guys who send us biddies throughout the show.

812
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
We really appreciate that.

813
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
And the subscriptions are great as well.

814
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
And I know some people have been very interested in subscribing.

815
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Because some people are actually like watching the video.

816
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Instead of listening to the podcast.

817
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Which is still gonna be free like it always was.

818
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
But we thought if we're gonna do a little something extra like the video.

819
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
That will be the thing that's behind the subscription.

820
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
But so many people have Twitch Prime anyway.

821
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Like you kinda have a free sub a month anyway.

822
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
So if you feel like using it on us.

823
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,000
That'd be awesome.

824
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
And then yeah follow me on Twitch as well.

825
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
And come watch my streams.

826
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Because I need more people to watch my streams.

827
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Thank you Act Deaf for tuning into my Crackdown stream.

828
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
You were streaming on Friday night though right?

829
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
I know.

830
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
It was just it was just timing.

831
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Do something like.

832
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I try to do stuff during the week.

833
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
But I also have to like you have to understand like.

834
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I have to also cook and get the kids ready for bed.

835
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Because God forbid no one else in our house is gonna actually do any of that.

836
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
So yeah.

837
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
You have to see if you can get a friend to host you or something.

838
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Because that'll go a long way.

839
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Like see if you can do Tuesday after anime jam session.

840
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
And then go to Rama and say please please please help me out and host.

841
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Or like you know Sunday after OLR would be perfect.

842
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
But unfortunately you have to drive home.

843
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Yes.

844
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Yeah so.

845
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
But well I mean sometime you could have maybe Bobby would do it for 30 minutes.

846
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
And then you could go after him or something.

847
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Yeah I guess.

848
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Or something out.

849
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Yeah.

850
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
It's fine.

851
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,000
You know what.

852
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
The more I think about it though it's like.

853
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Eh.

854
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
You know like how much am I actually doing this.

855
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
It's not like you're gonna make.

856
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Like eh.

857
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
It's just like.

858
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
That's the thing with VoG too.

859
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Like we appreciate the biddies and we appreciate the subs and all that stuff.

860
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:13,000
But like we do not have fantasies or actually like make a profit off this thing.

861
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Yeah.

862
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Like the money is going into essentially like the business element of this whole thing is

863
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
a big part of it.

864
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,000
And then at some point we would like to put the money I think into making more like merchandise.

865
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,000
And I think conventions is really the big thing we would like to be able to use money

866
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
to do is to like sponsor or get our name out there and more things.

867
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Yeah.

868
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Like in the marketing side of things to help grow.

869
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I think.

870
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
And that that ain't free because we've been paying all that out of pocket until now.

871
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
But having a little extra coin will help us maybe do a few extra events.

872
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,000
So.

873
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I'll be fine.

874
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Yeah.

875
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
All right.

876
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Anyhow.

877
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Gaming news.

878
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
We have a lot of news to touch on for the week.

879
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
It was a busy week and not so great news to start.

880
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Right.

881
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Yes.

882
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Unfortunately as we hinted last week it ended up becoming true on Tuesday.

883
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Activision Blizzard did lay off 8 percent of its staff which was about 800 people.

884
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:08,000
And you know from all different lines of their business basically I think they're seeing

885
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:16,000
the king Activision Blizzard the Blizzard side of the house and Activision were all

886
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
kind of a lot of them were let go.

887
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:26,000
They had a lot of the I think a lot of the people that got let go just found out from

888
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
the call.

889
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:34,000
The worst part about it though was during the earnings call they started our Bobby Kotick

890
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:40,000
started off once again achieved record results in 2018.

891
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:44,000
So that's why we got to lay off 800 peoples because we've made all this money and we need

892
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
more of it I guess.

893
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Well.

894
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Here's the thing.

895
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I don't know.

896
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,000
This is a very complicated story obviously and I know people like that were affected

897
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
by this.

898
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,000
You know you get to know people on Twitter and social media and you've been to you know

899
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,000
the L.A. area enough times and do gaming events you start to meet people and so I know people

900
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,000
that were affected by this stuff and so it sucks and my heart really goes out to them.

901
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:16,000
There is a part of me that kind of like gets the business side of it purely because obviously

902
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Activision Blizzard had Destiny 2 their partnership with Bungie.

903
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Bungie took that away and they're putting it all in house which they had the right to

904
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,000
do and many people cheered that when it happened right.

905
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,000
But the unfortunate side effect of that is that you had people that were supporting Destiny

906
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,000
2 would be it and I'm not just talking about like development I'm talking about everything

907
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000
that goes into the marketing the promotion running things at conventions running things

908
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
you know all this you know other stuff and privacy too.

909
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
And suddenly it's like well now what.

910
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,000
You know and they were left without something to do so that end on the business side it's

911
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
like I kind of like I get that.

912
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,000
I'm as horrible as that sounds I mean like I get but I'm not excusing it because there's

913
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,000
also a part of me that says but that's poor planning on the management's part that they

914
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:08,000
did not have what is what the next the next you know launch pattern the next big thing

915
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,000
the next thing we're working on that we will have these people work on in our plan development

916
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
it's almost kind of like this Bungie thing may not have been extremely known about or

917
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
planned out I don't know so that part is extremely disappointing.

918
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:27,000
But I think again and this is now several instances in the past few months where Activision

919
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Blizzard very clearly has a messaging problem that you have very clearly outlined here is

920
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:38,000
that they've opened this call saying the numbers are and I get that they have to say that to

921
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:44,000
investors even if the fucking sky is falling you've got to get on there and be like investors

922
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
things are going to be great you know.

923
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Well that's the problem though it's like you like as I mentioned last week you know how

924
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,000
you're going to keep growing like this you only have you're getting to the point where

925
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
like you saturated the market you're like I don't see how you're going to grow even more

926
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:04,000
even aside from just like microtransactions but like how much more can you possibly you're

927
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
eventually going to you know plateau out.

928
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,000
I just don't know what the ends I guess that's where cutting you know being more efficient

929
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
as a company also comes into play making more of that money.

930
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:21,000
And so here's what pisses me off about the whole thing and here's why I'm mad for those

931
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:26,000
people that lost their job so suddenly you know with you know and if you were a contractor

932
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,000
with literally like nothing you're just basically it's done that's it the end.

933
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:36,000
What pisses me off about it is that it's it's poor planning is part of the reason why this

934
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,000
is happening because you look at Activision Blizzard's 2019 calendar and it's kind of

935
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
they've got Warcraft 3 coming out of Blizzard.

936
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Surely there'll be a new call of duty. I mean you've got the Warcraft vanilla

937
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,000
they're putting out all over again right. But it's kind of like you don't really see a lot of

938
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:59,000
exciting new things in 2019. So it's like where was the planning for that. My point is

939
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:04,000
where was the news about Bobby Kotick is going to take a hit in his salary or

940
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
the board's going to take a hit in their salary. Of course they don't. Of course. Of course not.

941
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,000
You know what. You know what. When it was Satoru Iwata at Nintendo when the Wii U

942
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:18,000
was failing he took a 50 percent pay cut. Remember that. Do you remember when he went on the

943
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
I'm taking a 50 percent pay cut because I let you all down. That is why we

944
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,000
respect Satoru Iwata and why we eulogize him the way we do. But this is also

945
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:33,000
dealing with a cultural thing as well. Fair. Where. And this is just I may be

946
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,000
off base but it's something I've noticed in general specifically with Japanese companies they are a huge entity.

947
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,000
And everybody's contributions to the company are considered first.

948
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:48,000
You know how does this affect everybody. You know we're here is all about greed it's

949
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:53,000
capitalism and it's worse. And you know I really do think that instead of

950
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:58,000
punishing the employees they start at the top and punish the executives.

951
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,000
The ones who have lost touch with their markets with their employees and with people in general

952
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,000
who only think of that bottom line you punish them first because they're the ones that are making

953
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:13,000
the decisions that are fucking it up for everybody else. Bobby Blackwell says

954
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:18,000
unfortunately Kotek taking a pay cut wouldn't save those jobs those people don't have work anymore but it could have gone

955
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,000
into enhance the severance package. It could have gone into. And here's the thing. It could have gone into

956
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:28,000
laying off fewer people. Right. And as much as you know here's the thing as much as I'm like

957
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:33,000
and you hope for this and you pray for this for the folks that were affected is that it's going to be

958
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:38,000
like a phoenix. You know what. You got devastated by this company but there'll be a new game

959
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:43,000
studio and something that builds from that. But at the same time when it comes to like making a game

960
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,000
you have to have investors in that game because you can't just like make a

961
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,000
game if you'd have nothing to live on and eat on. That's why Kickstarter was hugely

962
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:58,000
successful for a long time because it was a way to kind of like get your game invested when you were in your project.

963
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Unfortunately too many of them failed or I think the public has lost trust in a big way in Kickstarter. Right.

964
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,000
But I feel like OK well couldn't Activision have used some of that money if they plan better

965
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,000
if their management to plan better to have more projects for these folks to work

966
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:18,000
on to have these. You know. Sure. Would it have been enough for everybody.

967
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Maybe not but at least maybe we could have had something to look forward to

968
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:28,000
besides more this. Well that's the thing. That's the thing with Activision though they

969
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,000
do kind of tend to put their eggs in all in one basket because I mean aside from it's basically

970
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:38,000
the Blizzard side of the house kind of has their stuff diverse between your World of Warcraft and

971
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Overwatch and then the Call of Duty or you know Activision just has Call of Duty

972
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:48,000
pretty much they put all of their eggs in Call of Duty. I mean granted this year they've got I was just checking their

973
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:53,000
site and like what the hell is even coming out from them because I know even just in the history of me dealing with them

974
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:58,000
they haven't had a lot of games release out throughout the year. So they've got was it that

975
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Sekiro Shadows Die twice. So they have that game coming out which is kind of like a Dark Souls

976
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:08,000
game and then Crash Team Racing. But I mean granted those aren't going to be huge titles. So

977
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,000
it's I don't know. You know Questbuster does bring up an important point and it's worth mentioning here is that

978
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,000
answering a question from another analyst Activision noted that the job losses are from the SG&A

979
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,000
and non core parts of the business and that does seem to be kind of lining up with what we're hearing is

980
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:28,000
that it's like these losses weren't really coming from development or

981
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:33,000
programmers or artists. I mean I don't I don't know all the facts. Granted I'll be the first to

982
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,000
admit that you know I don't know if those teams were like zero impact but it does seem like the brunt was

983
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,000
in the distributing and this whole combination of the two Blizzard arms or was that we know that

984
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:48,000
the esports thing already was you had taken a hit. We know like support for Destiny 2

985
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,000
and so forth and marketing for this game that they pretty much are no longer involved with and so forth. It seems like

986
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:58,000
that is all the stuff that took a hit not the stuff that's actually going to develop the games in the future. But then

987
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,000
part of me goes well you've got to be looking down the road at what you're going

988
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,000
to be developing in the future that you're going to need support for. And if I'm somebody in the industry and I've

989
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,000
heard about how Activision kind of did this go round when they need those people in the future

990
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:18,000
I'm going to be thinking about that. I don't know. But then at the same time I know for a lot of people a job's a job

991
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:23,000
and you're going to go wherever you can get work. But it's a complicated issue.

992
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:28,000
How about this question that's coming up all the time. Would a union have fixed everything?

993
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,000
If they were just unionized couldn't the union have punched Bobby in the face

994
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:38,000
and said no you can't do it. No because I think this is completely different than like we're

995
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,000
talking about crunch time and laying off developers after crunch time type of thing. This

996
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:48,000
is more of other. This is just a different type of layoff scenario.

997
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:53,000
A union probably would have helped it be more of a coast as opposed to

998
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:58,000
a drop off the cliff. Does that make sense. I feel like that's what the union could have

999
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,000
negotiated for things like the severance things like the medical things like you know

1000
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:08,000
the analyzing what is absolutely needed and what is you know so forth. And you're right.

1001
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,000
And a lot of the stuff about and I'm not saying I'm not like anti-union for the game developers or anything. I think a lot

1002
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:18,000
of good could come out of that when we talk about the working conditions and the other things that you brought up there. But

1003
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:23,000
would a union have magically fixed this whole scenario and prevented it from happening. Probably not. No many

1004
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:28,000
many companies that do have union employees do go through layoffs. It happens. But it's

1005
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,000
just the way it happens may have been different. So anyhow at

1006
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:38,000
the end of the day you know our thoughts go out to those that were affected by this. And again fingers crossed.

1007
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,000
It is great and I'll try to end this segment on a happy note and we'll go on to the next story. It is really nice

1008
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:48,000
to see the game developer and Jason you know all the people other people to make games

1009
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:53,000
industry work too. It is nice to see everybody come together where it's like dang all at once it's like you see

1010
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:58,000
hey look at this resume and hey we're hiring all these people and hey have you looked at our game

1011
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:03,000
list and we would love to have some of the Activision Blizzard people come over here and it's like you definitely see a lot of that

1012
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:08,000
support. You know even if it's not an official union game developers and the gaming community

1013
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:13,000
that make the games are really looking out for each other and that that part is positive and I think a really

1014
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:18,000
good thing even if people are feeling a little sour this week. I think to see all that

1015
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:23,000
support out there from peers really probably means a lot at least they're getting some money.

1016
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:28,000
It's not you know telltale games scenario where they just kind of

1017
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:33,000
garbage. Yeah I was even worse. Yeah. Yeah for sure. Anyway

1018
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:38,000
let's move on. I mean I know I know it's a lot of the news this week is kind

1019
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,000
of centered around that but I do want to move on to another story talking about maybe another way that

1020
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Blizzard and Activision are making money and that is off the popularity of Overwatch

1021
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,000
even though I've also seen some reports that like the Overwatch popularity

1022
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:58,000
is kind of declining a little bit. Maybe that's just because the game's been out a couple of years. I mean in some ways

1023
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:03,000
I kind of think. Now's the time. Lego Overwatch the game. Well

1024
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:08,000
well maybe not that but Hasbro is doing things for Overwatch

1025
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:13,000
besides just the Nerf gun. They are going to be doing a Monopoly branded or

1026
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:18,000
a Monopoly Overwatch branded. There's Monopoly for everything. You can even make

1027
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:23,000
your own Monopoly. We could have an O.L.R. Monopoly. I saw Pizza Monopoly the other day. I was like

1028
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:28,000
huh. You can make Monopoly out of like literally anything. And

1029
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:33,000
who buys all those. You know what's funny is like was it Boardwalk was

1030
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Pepperoni and like Baltic Avenue was like macaroni and cheese. I'm like that's not even pizza

1031
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:43,000
that's mac and cheese. Tell that to John's incredibly mediocre pizza. I've seen mac and cheese on a pizza. It's

1032
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:48,000
weird but I mean some of y'all know that's why it's Baltic. I like peanut butter pizza

1033
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:53,000
too. I'm surprised the cheapest one wasn't pineapple as a joke to that which by the way I'm completely fine with

1034
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:58,000
pineapple on pizza. Y'all need to stop hating but no one's forcing you to eat it. But

1035
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:03,000
I like mayonnaise and eel on a pizza. You can enjoy that over there.

1036
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Anyway that I don't understand. Yes Monopoly. So

1037
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:13,000
do you do you own a lottery. Do you own like branded Monopoly things. I have a few. I get

1038
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:18,000
texted that Golden Girls one like at least once a month if not twice a month.

1039
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:23,000
We have the Super Mario Brothers one. Yeah. And I think Dan has a

1040
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Mustang one. Have you ever played it. No it's more. It's just a collectible thing. I have a Monopoly

1041
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:33,000
game. I don't need to buy another Monopoly game. And I have Monopoly. Well which

1042
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:38,000
one's that. I remember the master system misprint. Oh God that's oh that's OK. That's

1043
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:43,000
throwback. Yes. Mono polio. And I have a monopoly pinball.

1044
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:48,000
There was a monopoly. I have the one stern did the newer one. There was a monopoly game show years ago too. But anyway

1045
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:53,000
moving on. So there's not just the monopoly Overwatch which the

1046
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:58,000
pieces for the players will be of course characters like Deva and Winston and so forth. But

1047
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:03,000
there's also going to be six inch action figures for twenty three bucks. You get characters like

1048
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Lucio Reaper Sombra and Tracer. But there's also a fifty dollar Reinhardt figure

1049
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:13,000
that comes with like a giant energy shield type of thing that you can kind of put in front of the character in

1050
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:18,000
it. It does look really cool. Also there's some dual character packs. So for fifty bucks you can

1051
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,000
get an Anna and Soldier 76 dual pack and you can also get a mercy and Farah

1052
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:28,000
dual pack as well. So figures array and making money.

1053
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:33,000
I saw Fortnite figures the other day too. Of course. There's like a Fortnite aisle at Target.

1054
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:38,000
It's crazy. Yeah. Merch merch merch. Hey it's you know it's just like the movie industry.

1055
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:43,000
That's like they don't just make money off the movies. They make money off the industry.

1056
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Yep. Spaceballs the toilet paper. Spaceballs the flamethrower.

1057
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Pixel Pacas in chat says but what about that Golden Girls cruise. Stay tuned

1058
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:59,000
for the next episode of Shaking and Crying which yes there was a new episode of that this week.

1059
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:04,000
DJ Roma S brings up Sailor Moon Monopoly. VG Realness says I have Golden Girls

1060
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Monopoly but have you ever played it or do you just own it to own it. Like I have to

1061
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:14,000
I have to really take that approach of I need to stop for me. I'm not judging nobody else. But for me

1062
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:19,000
because of all the crap we have this house. I just have to like do I really need this.

1063
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:24,000
You have a perfectly unused calendar right here. Well look it's on the right month.

1064
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Oh I didn't even notice. I thought that was just a cover. How dare you. It's

1065
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:34,000
it's the lamp behind you. Oh geez. Anyway no one can see it. I got to put it in front of Pikachu.

1066
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:39,000
There you go. It was doing well. Now you're covering Pikachu. Ah whatever. Just because. All right.

1067
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:44,000
He's like he's almost got the mean face on it. Anyway Fifth Dream

1068
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:49,000
today in our chat says I have a seventy dollar Widowmaker action figure because Japan.

1069
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Well yeah I mean Hasbro is not the only one doing action figures. I mean there's there's pop because the pop

1070
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:59,000
figures are everywhere for everything right. Then there's like a little tiny figures I've seen

1071
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:04,000
at Target as well like Overwatch. There's lots of yeah they have also their own pop figure

1072
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:09,000
type thing. It's not pop but it's target pop or whatever. I don't know. Yeah.

1073
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Knock knock off things. Yeah I get it. It's the same your mom's not going to know any

1074
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:19,000
different when she buys it for you. Exactly. All right. Let's move on to another story.

1075
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Dark Sakura what do you have for us. Well it's not really so much a matter of the show itself

1076
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:29,000
but what was going on behind closed doors are actually behind the scenes.

1077
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:34,000
So that show I have never watched nor am interested in Black

1078
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Black Mirror. It's great. I still I don't. It's like the Twilight Zone but Internet.

1079
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:44,000
I don't like going back and watching Twilight Zone either. Interesting. But anyway

1080
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:49,000
they did that Black Mirror Bandersnatch where it's sort of like a choose your own adventure sort of thing.

1081
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:54,000
So as you watch it you pick the direction that the story goes. Well

1082
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Netflix has saved all of that information. In fact there

1083
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:04,000
was a general data protection regulation request that was filed by University College

1084
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:09,000
London technology researcher named Michael Veal who wanted

1085
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:14,000
to basically they revealed that Netflix kept track of every decision that was

1086
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:19,000
made. So you know they've held onto it for a very long time and no telling when they're going to let it

1087
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:24,000
go which in itself sounds like an episode of Black Mirror. Well basically

1088
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:29,000
in response to that request Netflix did disclose that it used the individual's choices

1089
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:34,000
so that they could figure out what segment of the story they were on which of course you know if you're going to leave the show and come back to it

1090
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:39,000
as you can with Netflix then you can pick up on the decision that you last left up

1091
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:44,000
the thought that left off on. Yeah I think that there is nothing really malicious

1092
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:49,000
about it. It's more of just you know the function of Netflix. But think about

1093
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:54,000
how this could be used. Well I don't know. I want to let Jamie finish and then I'll. Well at any

1094
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:59,000
at any rate you know Netflix also though while they did say that they wanted to

1095
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:04,000
hold onto the information to quote determine how to improve this model of storytelling

1096
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:09,000
in the context of a show or movie and quote they really didn't say how long

1097
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:14,000
we plan on holding on to that information. Well I mean if you haven't watched it which I

1098
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:19,000
know you haven't. Jamie one of the early choices you make and I don't think this is a spoiler because I think it really

1099
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:24,000
is just kind of like a test to see how this works. You make a very early choice about

1100
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:29,000
which breakfast cereal do you want to eat. Do you want to eat like it was like Frosted Flakes or Fruit Loops some

1101
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:34,000
type of generic names for those. I mean you get this bit like that. And so you pick which one you want.

1102
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:39,000
And then I think like it later will come up like in a commercial or something while somebody's watching

1103
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:44,000
TV. So like that's how your choice like impacts it later on. But it's like it's a practice one.

1104
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:49,000
They keep that data to show who likes healthy cereals versus fruity cereal. That's it.

1105
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:54,000
And tailor their advertisements and show you finished my thought for me. That's the type of thing that

1106
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:59,000
I could see. Oh but they're getting this data with these choices and then it could potentially tailor advertisements.

1107
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Now what does this have to do with video games. The actual shitty person.

1108
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:09,000
What does this have to do with video games is because you make a lot of choices in video games too.

1109
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:14,000
And a lot of these online environment things you know we talk we see more and more like advertisement

1110
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:19,000
in games like Street Fighter 5 and stuff. Controversially I mean how many video games do you think

1111
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:24,000
might be listening to the types of choices you're making. Like maybe there's you want to fuck the

1112
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Turian or do you want the lizard alien showing which type

1113
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:34,000
of personal ads are you going to see based on spiky cat bird aliens

1114
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:39,000
or lizard folk based on your romance choices in Mass Effect. You may be a fan

1115
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:44,000
of hot to full boyfriend based on based on your choices.

1116
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:49,000
You may like killing people at a distance or up close and personal hot local Turian's

1117
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:54,000
near you. You may be into calibrations. Some interesting comments in chat. Let's see.

1118
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Dark to see you in chat says Yeah I don't know if it's surprising. I mean don't they track that sort of thing to give you recommendations.

1119
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Sure. Netflix what attracts what you watch to do that act

1120
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:09,000
deaf says but you don't get as a joke. I know. But then again it is an Internet based service

1121
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:14,000
and if it's tied into other like say you're watching through the Internet like through your browser you

1122
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:19,000
don't you don't think it still gathers browser data. And we all know if you sell it. We all know if this

1123
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:24,000
company was Facebook they'd be using it for things you already have.

1124
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:29,000
They you don't even need to be on Facebook for them to make a profile and track you. It's it's

1125
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:34,000
well it's just the modern Internet anyway active says that you don't get ads and Netflix

1126
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:39,000
you kind of do. You are right. But you get ads for an ad other shows to watch.

1127
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Here's what Jamie's eating. Take that off. They didn't pay for it. They didn't pay for that. Who wants one. What is it.

1128
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:49,000
What even is it. These are butter soy sauce potato crisps. All right I'll try one. But give me.

1129
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Let me finish the story first. Stop trying to tempt me while I'm trying to do a show here. All right.

1130
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:59,000
Now Bobby Blackwell if I think this is an interesting comment to Bobby Blackwell says I can tell you 100 percent for

1131
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:04,000
sure that Borderlands 2 tracks everything you do because they wanted to hire me to maintain it.

1132
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:09,000
They talk about exactly how many bullets you fire which ones hit where you fired

1133
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:14,000
from et cetera. Some of that could be more just like trying to develop to me. I think that's also the

1134
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:19,000
stat tracking in the game tracks all that. So yeah interesting

1135
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:24,000
nonetheless though I tell you how quickly was it before he cheated immediately. But it was

1136
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:29,000
very interesting like how many people probably watch that he punches horse. How many people probably watched

1137
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Bandersnatch without really thinking. And like ultimately is it going to be used for anything bad. Probably not.

1138
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:39,000
But could they. Maybe. I know another

1139
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:44,000
choice might tell him what type of music I like. That was another choice that was in the episode you watch the episode.

1140
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Who's I really. I started watching it. I got bored with it pretty fast

1141
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:54,000
and I liked it was black. I like all the Black Mirror stuff but I just couldn't get into

1142
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:59,000
it. It was the story just wasn't really kind of interesting enough for

1143
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:04,000
me. Yeah. Bobby says I mean you have to make some terrible choices in Bandersnatch you really do. I don't want to ruin it but it gets

1144
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:09,000
it gets dark. We'll just put it that way. Oh maybe I'll have to watch it again. All right. Yeah. All right. Anyway

1145
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:14,000
let's move on. We'll talk about another story Loki.

1146
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:19,000
So speaking of Fortnite of course you may remember that there was a few lawsuits

1147
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:24,000
regarding the dance emotes in the game. Well apparently there's been some progress

1148
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:29,000
regarding that. So Epic Games has already asked the court to dismiss the 2

1149
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Millie lawsuit because they said their Fortnite dance is different. So after

1150
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:39,000
I guess about two months they said that the Millie dance in the game

1151
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:44,000
is too short to be copyrighted.

1152
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:49,000
And it's not the same as the swipe it dance in Fortnite

1153
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:54,000
and along those lines as well. Apparently the

1154
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Carlton dance that was in there. Well here's an ironic twist.

1155
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Alfonso Ribeiro the court has decided that

1156
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:09,000
he doesn't have ownership to that either. The NBC

1157
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:14,000
does. Whoops. I thought that might happen in that case

1158
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:19,000
because he was an employee of NBC doing that show and that show that he was on ends up

1159
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:24,000
being property of NBC. So I kind of figured that's how that would go. It's not unusual

1160
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:29,000
to be sued by anyone. So could NBC sue ABC

1161
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:34,000
because he did it on Dancing with the Stars? I don't think well being

1162
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:39,000
that I don't think they care to be it's an expression. I don't know. I think that the

1163
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:44,000
lawsuit was kind of stupid anyways. But I mean other games have had emotes like this

1164
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:49,000
before. It's like how I don't know. The courts have decided. Did Shakira

1165
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:54,000
sue Blizzard for the hips don't lie dance. I don't think so.

1166
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:01,000
There's been several games that have had Carlton like dance and it's just interesting he tried to get the

1167
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:06,000
copyright now. That also I think kind of weakens the case. Yeah. How many years

1168
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:11,000
ago was that on the air. Like if you felt that strongly about it maybe that's something you should have gone

1169
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:16,000
for in the 90s at least you know. And actually when it was French

1170
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Prince of Bel-Air the 90s 90s 90s. Yeah definitely the 90s. All right.

1171
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Anyhow. Well does this mean the dances will show back up in

1172
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Fortnite you think or you think they're going to like never went away. What games took him out.

1173
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Some games took him out. Oh is that Forza. Forza took those out. Yeah but who needs fucking

1174
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:41,000
emotes in. It's a fucking racing game. Like where are you going to see you doing an

1175
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:46,000
emote in the goddamn game. If you would play said racing game you would know

1176
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:51,000
that when you're on the little victory stand the one two three that's when you're thinking

1177
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Oh see that's the problem I never get in the top victory.

1178
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:02,000
That explains it. Yes. Aha. Gotcha. All right. Moving on.

1179
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Let's talk about speaking of lawsuits. This is one that could have a ripple

1180
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:12,000
effect of sorts. It has to do with Pokemon Go. It's a game we've talked about a few times on the show. I think everybody

1181
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:17,000
here in studio plays that game. And I'm sure many of you do as well. You might remember when the game first came

1182
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:22,000
out it was nuts. Tons of people were playing and sometimes they were playing in places

1183
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:27,000
that maybe they should have been playing because some ingress player put a couch portal in there years ago.

1184
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:32,000
And now all these Pokemon people are showing up because it's where the gyms. I thought it was because people

1185
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:37,000
were dumb and didn't understand that like you don't have to be near the Pokemon to catch the

1186
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Pokemon. And so they were like wandering into like secured areas to get near a Pokemon

1187
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:47,000
that they probably could have just touched on their screen. Well or

1188
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:52,000
remember I had the one two three tracking like yeah when it first came out. And so like they thought they were close.

1189
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:57,000
I mean there's there's some or they were using one of those sites that would show. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway

1190
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:02,000
there's a million reasons why people would make some questionable decisions that whole thing. But anyway

1191
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:07,000
what happened earlier this week is that some homeowners that had sued over Pokemon

1192
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:12,000
go basically hit a proposed settlement for review from a California

1193
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:17,000
federal judge. And assuming this gets the blessing which it seems like it would go that way

1194
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:22,000
and Iantic will have to take on some additional responsibility for this whole thing.

1195
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:27,000
So these are all lawsuits dating back to 2016 when the game first came out

1196
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:32,000
from places like condos in Florida and so forth who complained that

1197
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:37,000
hundreds of players would be there behaving like zombies walking around and bumping

1198
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:42,000
into things. And although that's kind of you know I remember. Yeah it's

1199
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:47,000
still like you know you're you are trespassing and especially in a place like Florida where there's a lot of like

1200
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:52,000
there's like pokey stops in a lot of apartment complexes I see all the

1201
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:57,000
time with fountains and stuff. So I mean I don't know I'd be pissed if

1202
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:02,000
they took it out but you know. So anyway here are some things. Some put gyms there. Let's talk let's talk

1203
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:07,000
about what Niantic is going to do. Well it's all a formula and it's all it all dates back to Ingress and

1204
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:12,000
the portals going in in Ingress which in the beginning stages of

1205
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Ingress Google employees because Niantic was a Google subsidiary Google employees were essentially

1206
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:22,000
screening which were good candidates and which weren't and they didn't always like really know

1207
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:27,000
that's changed in the past couple of years to now it's a peer review it's a whole OPR

1208
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:32,000
and the peer review. And I know this because I'm a part of it. I've seen a lot of them disappear both games.

1209
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:37,000
Yeah. Well because more and more people are reporting stuff too. Like you know I have no problem

1210
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:42,000
like if there is a portal that is it should not be there per the rules. It's something that is just completely

1211
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:47,000
inaccessible or like there was one the other day I reported because it's it's a frickin poster

1212
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:52,000
in somebody's apartment. It shouldn't be there. It's not it's not a camera. They have artwork in the Kaiser

1213
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:57,000
medical offices. Right. But that is stationary. At least anybody can go in there. But technically

1214
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:02,000
if it obstructs emergency services it shouldn't be there. There was one I saw that was in a

1215
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:07,000
government building area that they have security guards and they don't like you going near it. And they finally

1216
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:12,000
remove that pokey stop. I always try to get it from the sidewalk but I couldn't quite get it.

1217
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:17,000
It was the unclean property thing over in Rancho.

1218
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Oh yeah. I used to like try to get I got it once in Ingress but like the security guards

1219
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:26,000
like what the hell are you doing here. I'm like I'm just trying to get this and I show my phone and show that

1220
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:31,000
and he's there. OK fine. But then like they just they really don't want you over there. Well OK.

1221
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:36,000
So now what's going to happen here. So this is going to be kind of where things change with Niantic upon

1222
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:41,000
complaints of nuisance or trespass and demands of the removal of a pokey stopper Jim the company

1223
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:46,000
will make commercially reasonable efforts to resolve the complaint and communicate

1224
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:51,000
a resolution within 15 days. That's the part that makes my head explode because Niantic

1225
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:56,000
is so fucking slow at responding to these things that now they're basically going to be on the hook with this settlement.

1226
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:01,000
So I don't know if they're going to have to staff a support team or what they're going to do. They're going to have to respond to this shit in 15 days.

1227
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:06,000
And honestly there's a part of me that's like finally you

1228
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:11,000
know like they need to have the fire to get lit especially with the amount of money

1229
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:16,000
that Pokemon Go is supposedly bringing in like they should be having the support staff

1230
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:21,000
by the way Niantic I don't want to sound tacky or anything but I think there's plenty

1231
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:26,000
of very capable support staff type people looking for work right now because of what happened

1232
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:31,000
this week. So you know Niantic has a full very

1233
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:36,000
talented pool of folks to help them out to get these types of requests. Maybe it'll work out.

1234
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:41,000
If you are an owner of a single family residence not

1235
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:46,000
an apartment single family residence you have the right of removal within 40 meters

1236
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:51,000
of your property can have the right of addition using the number one question I've seen

1237
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:56,000
that joke is the number one thing on every Reddit post about this is like can I get one added and it's like

1238
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:01,000
sure roll an Ingress account get to level 10 try to submit it. But at the same time

1239
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:06,000
if again if I and I review portals at OPR and I'll tell you here's the number one thing I see

1240
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:11,000
that I kick out. OK I get the little submissions for they're called little free libraries.

1241
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:16,000
You've seen those right. Yes yes libraries are like take a book or leave a book behind and those types

1242
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:21,000
of things. If they are in a park. Cool. If they're meta and they're at a library.

1243
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Cool. If they're I've seen one in a there's actually one in

1244
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:31,000
the grocery store not far from here. That's that's fine as well. All that stuff is fine. But

1245
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:36,000
when I see it in front of somebody's house on private property in a residential street in a private

1246
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:41,000
neighborhood I always say no. And I say no it's on private property. So you

1247
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:46,000
know and that's that's why in a big way I think Ingress people are doing the review

1248
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:51,000
and not Pokemon Go players because if you open it up to Pokemon Go players all that stuff would get

1249
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:56,000
added. Absolutely people wouldn't give a crap. They'd just be like a more stops more gems. But when you look at the more

1250
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:01,000
PvP element Ingress and stuff like a it's a strategical nightmare

1251
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:06,000
to have that stuff on people's private property because people in a game like that get

1252
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:11,000
very possessive and fucking crazy control over things like that

1253
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:16,000
right. So like it can add up to ugly scenarios. So like that just that type of stuff should not

1254
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:21,000
be on private property. I am all for parks being loaded up trails

1255
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:26,000
load them up with stops every everything that's like accessible and out there

1256
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:31,000
load them up private property be it a business be it a government be it a house. No I don't think

1257
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:36,000
that stuff should be there whatsoever. But that's my opinion. Anyway

1258
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:42,000
let's see what else. Moving on to other bullet points. I'm also missing our chat because I brought up the bullet points. I haven't really been

1259
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:47,000
checking the chat here. Oh Bobby says they just added a Pokestop near my house. It's at a playground

1260
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:52,000
in an apartment complex. You didn't you also didn't have a lot of

1261
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:57,000
stops in your area Bobby our members. So that's good that they're adding new stuff at least in your area.

1262
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:02,000
That's that's great. Let's see. Act F says I have a Pokestop

1263
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:07,000
in my house approved last month but it's a mural on the wall of the house

1264
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:12,000
next to the street. It's it's tricky I would say in those situations

1265
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:17,000
with a mural as long as like again if it's in a residential neighborhood I would tend to say no.

1266
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:22,000
But if it's a mural like on a like downtown on a on a club or something

1267
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:27,000
then I would say yes. Yeah it just depends. I just try to ask the question with everything in

1268
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:32,000
OPR and I would hope everybody reviewing in there does this. If a Pokemon

1269
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:37,000
raid happened there would it be disruptive. That's what I would a Pokemon raid be desired at this

1270
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:42,000
location. That's usually the number one question I would ask. All right.

1271
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Anyhow some other bullet points on Niantic because I didn't mean to go on a tangent

1272
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:52,000
but I do feel like having played both these games for a long time I I have a really pretty good

1273
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:57,000
understanding about how a lot of that works. But anyway Niantic will maintain a database

1274
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:02,000
of complaints in an attempt to avoid poor placement. So I'd almost

1275
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:07,000
guarantee some type of geofencing is going to go in where you're not going to be able to submit new

1276
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:12,000
portals in locations that have been geofenced off. I'm almost sure that's got to be a thing that's going to happen.

1277
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:17,000
When Niantic system detects a raid of more than 10 players congregating

1278
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:22,000
a warning message will appear on their screens reminding them to be courteous and respectful

1279
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:27,000
of surroundings. That's interesting. Hooray another pop up I get to dismiss.

1280
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:32,000
It's the type of thing that should be obvious but I understand why Niantic. It's like you're driving

1281
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:37,000
you're there's weather. I have a notification of news Niantic wants to pass that liability

1282
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:42,000
to you and they want to be able to say we warn them. That's that's what it's about. Honestly they should have the warnings

1283
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:47,000
on there. They should keep these in the forward people's minds. Yeah and I don't this this one doesn't bother actually

1284
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:52,000
honestly none of the none of these rules bother me except for I'm worried about the

1285
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:57,000
geofencing and what that might do. I'm worried that that's going to get used for naughty

1286
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:02,000
purposes that people are going to try to get that stuff enabled on like

1287
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:07,000
again Ingress like PVP stuff. That's what I worry about and I don't want

1288
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:12,000
to get ugly like that. I won't participate in that and I hope the other team doesn't either. Let's see.

1289
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:17,000
What was the other one. Oh Niantic working with user reviewers and mapping services like Google

1290
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Maps to also mitigate any problems plus maintaining a mechanism so park authorities

1291
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:27,000
can request a park's hours of operation be honored. That mechanic is in

1292
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Pokemon Go. It's not an Ingress though so I'd be curious how that's going to work. But in

1293
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Pokemon Go there's like certain gyms and stuff like you can't like if you try to tap it past a certain hour

1294
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:42,000
it'll say this gym is closed. I don't think there's anything in our area like that but there are

1295
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:47,000
like parks and other areas where they feel like you try to do a gym past seven o'clock and say this gym is closed.

1296
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Interesting. Yeah. And then lastly Niantic will have a independent firm

1297
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:57,000
audit compliance with the obligations during a three year period just to make sure they're following the rules. So

1298
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:02,000
I know it could be could be interesting to see the effects that have on Pokemon Go. But again I actually don't think any of it

1299
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:07,000
is that bad. Like it may sound like some pokey stops are going to get removed and that part kind of sucks

1300
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:12,000
but at the same time you know especially when Niantic has a third game coming down down the turnpike with

1301
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:17,000
this Harry Potter thing you know we really need to have a place of locations

1302
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:22,000
that is cool stuff but is also accessible by the public in mass

1303
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:27,000
you know at times that it should be assessed. So I will never get over the

1304
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:32,000
I'll never get over the that frickin portal they had out in the boonies. Do you remember this one that

1305
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:37,000
was frickin googly eyes put on a tree and somehow that was a portal

1306
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:42,000
slash pokey stop. And it was like it was like at grandma's house or something on the frickin tree

1307
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:47,000
or they had a horse statue in someone's front yard. I remember that. Oh yeah

1308
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:52,000
that one too. That was yeah. Yeah. And there was another one that was like and it was like a

1309
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:57,000
it was like it was like in front of somebody's like trailer. And it was like not even like

1310
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:02,000
you look in the perspective of the picture it's like some like frickin Home Depot statue that doesn't even come up to my knee

1311
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:07,000
but the way the picture was taken it made it look like it was really big. And it was like not you know

1312
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:12,000
again it was just somebody's somebody wanted something they could sit on top of and get

1313
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:17,000
gear all day long because that's an advantage to have that. So anyway

1314
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:22,000
interesting. I'm going to chat over at twitch TV slash vog

1315
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:27,000
network bonds 006 says waiting for the news of a real life turf war in

1316
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Pokemon go Bobby Blackwell says that's an ingress thing. True. That's exactly that. There's actually

1317
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:37,000
also another GPS game called Turf Wars that has got turned on too recently. It's been around

1318
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:42,000
forever. But it's it's very like I think that game has been around since like 2012 and it kind of feels

1319
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:47,000
like it. But it's interesting that you bring that up and there actually is a game called that

1320
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:52,000
bonds 006 says we got a horse statue in New York City as a stop in

1321
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:57,000
a park. It's good to have. That's fine. That's totally different. Yeah. But can you imagine like I think I know what you're

1322
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:02,000
talking about. It was like somebody's U shaped drive. Oh right. And the horse that was it

1323
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:07,000
turnpike all of their stops are removed. That was a controversial thing. Yes.

1324
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:12,000
So what happened because you know the other team in ingress was using it as a farm right. Yeah.

1325
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:17,000
And what happened is that my understanding is that in Pokemon go all these kids were out in the

1326
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:22,000
street doing the whole like catching and the raid and stuff. And so somebody on our team was

1327
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:27,000
over there and the neighborhood people were complaining our team about like what is why are all these

1328
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:31,000
kids on the street like this is not safe this whole thing. And so our team was like well you know and they were kind of like you're

1329
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:37,000
right. Like you're not supposed to have stuff in the medians. So they submitted stuff for removal and it got removed because Niantic

1330
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:42,000
looked like yeah it's not supposed to be in the street and the other team got livid and they were like you're only doing this

1331
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:47,000
because you can't win in it you know and they're just they're too tough about it and they think that it was only done to

1332
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:52,000
push them back. But my understanding is that the whole thing was initiated because people when Pokemon go

1333
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:57,000
is a huge thing. People actually were asking like why are all these people standing out in the middle of the street when I'm trying to like

1334
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:02,000
drive into my house and all this stuff. So yeah I know it's not the other day. Yeah.

1335
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:07,000
They're like oh what the hell. Yeah. No they added a couple more at the park there though. Oh

1336
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:12,000
there's only for Pokemon. Well yeah Pokemon. There's only three at the park. A million of them. But like

1337
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:17,000
yeah. Ingress is like probably 15. Anyway let's move on enough local politic.

1338
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:22,000
But it's the interesting nature of juggling a network that functions both in your PVP game

1339
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:27,000
and your PVE game. Honestly why do you think I partly quit. Oh no I get it.

1340
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:32,000
I got completely tired of just all the stupidity. It's a fucking game. I'm I'm getting

1341
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:37,000
to the point where I'm like I'm getting there. I'm getting to the point where I'm just kind of like I'm

1342
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:42,000
starting to like fail to like see the point in this. Like I'm definitely getting

1343
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:47,000
up where I'm like how do you defeat that which has no life. So I kind of like stop caring.

1344
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Yes. On one end I kind of like. How do you win something that has no intention of having a winner.

1345
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Right. Well that's why. But I do get into the in-person events. They do like those anomalies and things like that.

1346
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:02,000
And that those do have winners. And I like those better. And then you actually get to see

1347
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:07,000
people and be social and it's a lot more interesting. I hate competition honestly enough. I was just doing it because it was fun

1348
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:12,000
for a bit. And then when it got competitive and there's like you know top secret

1349
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:17,000
you know groups and everything I'm like that's a bit much. Yeah. When you when you have retired people that are driving around at three in the

1350
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:22,000
morning in their van with like 20 people like just it's just not. There's

1351
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:27,000
the James Bond element of doing stuff in secrecy in the planning. I actually kind of dug that. But it is

1352
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:32,000
one of those things where it's like you're starting to kind of look at this and go but beyond the social part which is still cool.

1353
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:37,000
What's the point. There's this thing called having a life. It's true. But it's I mean

1354
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:41,000
it's OK. Jamie like if I want to just like I just want to get in the car and go for a drive and have my moment

1355
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:45,000
is that I've been doing that a lot late at night lately where it's like I'm just going to go chill do something

1356
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:49,000
take some portals in my neighborhood and like go on a drive just clear my head get out of the house and like that.

1357
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:54,000
But that's my approach. Buying stuff. What I usually end up buying stuff. See this is I buy

1358
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:59,000
gas but at least I drive a hybrid. All right. We need to move on though. Let's move on to another story.

1359
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Speaking about spending a lot of money on something right. Right. This game is common as fucking

1360
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:09,000
dirt. Super Mario Brothers. Everyone has had multiple copies.

1361
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:14,000
I'm sure even if you never have owned a Nintendo product you probably have had

1362
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:19,000
a copy of Super Mario Brothers. I'm just saying. Well there is a particular

1363
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:25,000
though one an unopened copy that originally released in 1985.

1364
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:30,000
It's a particular sealed copy of Super Mario Brothers

1365
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:35,000
that recently sold for one hundred thousand one hundred and fifty dollars.

1366
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:40,000
It was bought by a group of collectors who

1367
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:45,000
include some owners and chairmans of

1368
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:50,000
like heritage auctions and just press play video games in Lancaster

1369
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:55,000
P.A. and another video game collector. So basically

1370
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:00,000
the whole thing about this particular one is it is a sticker sealed copy that was

1371
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:05,000
only available in New York and Los Angeles. So we now have

1372
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:10,000
you know one of the highest sales of a Nintendo game topping one hundred thousand dollars

1373
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:15,000
which still I would like to sell my final fight guy

1374
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:20,000
and my mighty final fight. I could get a couple grand for the two of them together.

1375
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:25,000
So anyone got two grand and want to buy my games. You got to put them out there

1376
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:30,000
though. I put them out. I give them I give them to listeners first listeners get first crack at them. Fair enough.

1377
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:35,000
You got five hundred bucks. You can have a box Ninja Gaiden trilogy. Just saying

1378
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:40,000
but one hundred thousand dollars. I mean I feel like recently we had that stadium events just went for like

1379
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:45,000
was it like sixty thousand things. I remember that. But it seems like wow these the amounts of

1380
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:50,000
these games are going way way up. Let's see here's here's the thing Dan and I were talking about this.

1381
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:55,000
You know we just bought games that we liked. You know if they happen to have the box with it. Cool.

1382
01:24:55,000 --> 01:25:00,000
We got the box independently afterwards. Cool. We have the box. But now

1383
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:05,000
the market is just getting stupid for classic games. It's kind of why we're not collecting

1384
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:10,000
anymore. You know like every so often I'll go get something classic because it's fun

1385
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:15,000
like for Dan's birthday. I got him two classic games. I got him the treasure box for PS2

1386
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:20,000
which is basically Gunstar Heroes one of his favorite games. And I got him a

1387
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:25,000
salamander deluxe pack. Thank you to Akuma J.P. Dan loves it. But you

1388
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:30,000
know I got Dan you know a couple of amazing games that are fun for him

1389
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:35,000
to play. You know if I can get my hands on a radiant silver gun and not break the bank that would be rad too.

1390
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:40,000
But the fact is that these games are becoming so valuable the market is really

1391
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:45,000
becoming just cutthroat lately and pinball is the same way.

1392
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Like a couple of our pins that we had in the past we wouldn't gotten more than a couple grand for them

1393
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:55,000
and now we could easily get like five grand for some of them. It's absolutely ridiculous.

1394
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:02,000
So just the gaming market itself has gotten kind of nuts.

1395
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:07,000
But before you go crazy thinking you have a hundred thousand dollar copy of Super Mario Brothers in your house it is a very specific.

1396
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:12,000
I mean they printed that game like 14 different times and I'm just talking about the original

1397
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:17,000
like I think most people owned Super Mario Brothers in a combo pack with

1398
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Duck Hunt or maybe the world track meet as well. This is not that you know

1399
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:27,000
this is the pre pack in sealed copy and it was only availed this particular

1400
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:32,000
like first pressing was only available in New York and L.A. which was kind of like

1401
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:37,000
the soft launch of the NES. Yeah. And looking at this one I mean it is

1402
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:42,000
hold on let me see if I can get the image pulled up it's on CNET posted on Twitter.

1403
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:47,000
But you never know what you might find at a garage sale or things like that because I know like I know the video

1404
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:52,000
store by my house back in the day they I remember they rented a copy of stadium

1405
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:57,000
events because that's how I knew about that game. So they had a copy of stadium events. Lord knows

1406
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:02,000
whatever happened to that cartridge. Now I'd love to know. But for all I know they they got rid of it in like a mass

1407
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:07,000
on loading to another store somewhere completely stupid. But I'm going to put the picture up on the feet on the feet. OK.

1408
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Do what you need to do. Can you see. Yeah. It's coming through a little bit. Yeah. That is

1409
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:17,000
the copy. So it's it's it's a little picture for I mean I don't know how to

1410
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:22,000
describe it for the podcast folks in the Twitter feed not the Twitter feed but it's there and I'll go to

1411
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:26,000
repost it on my own Twitter. So there you go.

1412
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Quest buster points out. So now you have a lot of bad actors getting in on sealing their copies in

1413
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:36,000
plastic and posting them on auction sites for 10 times the average price with a dubious

1414
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:41,000
rating. Yeah. When I bought a copy of clue for the Super Nintendo

1415
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:46,000
sealed at the farmer's market it had been resealed because when I opened it

1416
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:51,000
like I didn't I didn't actually think I was getting like a sealed copy as I was coming. But you

1417
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:56,000
notice the notes in the back of the manual had already been filled out. Yeah. So somebody like resealed it which I thought was a

1418
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:01,000
little shady. No. Anyway. All right. Well

1419
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Dark Soccer sadly nothing worth one hundred thousand dollars in your collection. But girl some good stuff. Maybe

1420
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:10,000
maybe maybe no seriously maybe you need to go through and audit it.

1421
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Well as probably what I'm going to do but I mean the thing is that what something is worth is what

1422
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:20,000
you get for it. I mean in terms of finance financial true you know. But

1423
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:25,000
now that I'm seeing you know when we first were thinking about like offloading our Ninja Gaiden trilogy it was

1424
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:30,000
going for about three hundred and fifty in the box. I've seen auctions for that exceed

1425
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:35,000
seven hundred and I'm asking five. So I mean if

1426
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:40,000
if I get close to that that'll be great. It'll put me closer to drag con.

1427
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Excellent. All right. Well good luck. Well moving on we have a few more stories before we get to our classic

1428
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:50,000
game of the week. Yes. So there's a little bit of mixed

1429
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:55,000
messaging coming from Sony regarding their cross play enabling.

1430
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:00,000
So Sony of course you know their official announcements was you know hey we're open for business

1431
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:05,000
for cross play between PlayStation 4 and other consoles. Although devs that

1432
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:10,000
have been inquiring into it seem to be getting a different message. So for example one

1433
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:15,000
of those deaths would be the death for war group. They had comments

1434
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:20,000
saying you just was not a music game. Right. No I was sad to find that out. I thought for sure I was like oh

1435
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:25,000
very much like a like an advanced war. Yeah I guess we're saying yeah it's tactics.

1436
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:30,000
So you know they said you just want to provide some balance on the issue and say it certainly isn't

1437
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:35,000
a question of developers having not contacted their account managers or having dropped the ball.

1438
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:40,000
We were told no. So basically you know they had run it up the

1439
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:45,000
chain and were denied. It's they said you know it's time to stop playing favorites and

1440
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:50,000
tear down the cross play progression wall for everyone. We have Smite Paladins

1441
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Realm Royale ready to go when you are. So

1442
01:29:55,000 --> 01:30:00,000
yeah it's kind of weird to see that you know they're sending out messages saying oh yeah it's really

1443
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:05,000
it's these devs that are holding it back. We're cool with it now but no that's not the case.

1444
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:10,000
So I think there may be a little bit more that they have to do. Maybe they're just not. I don't know

1445
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:15,000
but it doesn't seem like we're getting the full story from Sony regarding this stuff. So if you're

1446
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:20,000
wondering why your favorite game is a cross platform yet maybe Sony's fault. But I

1447
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:25,000
think I didn't expect all this to happen in the next couple months anyway. I knew they were going to get the big ones like

1448
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Minecraft and Rocket League. I knew that would happen pretty quick. But as far as like other games it would be things that were

1449
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:35,000
like starting development now that would be released like we would really start to see more cross play in like

1450
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:40,000
2020. You know what I mean. Yeah. When those games start coming out. Yeah. All

1451
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:45,000
right. Well one more story for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week and it has to do

1452
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:50,000
with some classic soundtracks. If you're a Spotify user a I don't know how else to

1453
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:55,000
describe this but a shit ton of soundtracks from Capcom games were added to

1454
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Spotify this week. So if you search for Capcom sound team you can find soundtracks

1455
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:05,000
like Mega Man games although they might be listed as Rockman because obviously that was you know

1456
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:10,000
gaming soundtracks were kind of bigger in Japan. So a lot of the Japanese names there but also like Street Fighter 5

1457
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:15,000
soundtrack is there Devil May Cry Monster Hunter various soundtracks and so on.

1458
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:20,000
I mean there's just a lot of stuff to listen to if you are a Capcom gaming fan on Spotify.

1459
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:25,000
So I actually have the pay Spotify I use it a lot. Sadly I haven't explored

1460
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:30,000
a lot of the Capcom stuff yet but they're getting up and up on the video game soundtracks on there. I got to say there's more

1461
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:35,000
and more things to enjoy on there. I know a lot of Final Fantasy related things are there and other stuff as well.

1462
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:40,000
And certainly I listened to the new Utada Hikaru selections from Kingdom Hearts 3

1463
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:44,000
because she had put that out on Spotify so that was nice too.

1464
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:49,000
ActDeft asking a related question. When are we getting OLR on Spotify? I'm hoping soon.

1465
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:54,000
I still am in dire need to do a behind the scenes switcheroo on where we're hosting our files

1466
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:59,000
and things like that. I actually really needed to do that like a couple months ago but I've been so focused on this whole Twitch move

1467
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:04,000
thing and some other personal stuff. But I'm hoping soon. So I didn't want to

1468
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:09,000
do the Spotify thing until that part's done and then we'll submit to Spotify after that.

1469
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:14,000
But I think Bobby Blackwolf's up on there if you want to check that out. I'm sure there's lots of other great podcasts. Indie stuff on Spotify as well.

1470
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Alright. Anyhow. Let's get to the classic game

1471
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:24,000
of the week where... Game? That's time for games.

1472
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Dark Soccer usually steps into the gaming vault every week to find a game that she thinks

1473
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:34,000
hey we should check out this game this week. But once a month in a 2019 twist

1474
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:39,000
she says you know what you should be checking out this soundtrack instead. So it's the classic

1475
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:44,000
soundtrack of the month. 8-bit. Oh sorry 8-bit specifically.

1476
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:49,000
What did you pick for us this week? I picked the soundtrack to Journey to Silius.

1477
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:54,000
This is a deep cut. I like this. Which is not really a game that

1478
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:59,000
I've enjoyed very much. It's okay. It was actually meant to be a Terminator game. But it was

1479
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:04,000
released in Japan as a game called Rough World. And of course we got out here as Journey

1480
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:09,000
to Silius. And I'm not going to go into the game because it could be a classic game and I don't want to shoot myself in the foot.

1481
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:14,000
But the music itself is really what's remarkable about it.

1482
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:19,000
The music was composed by Kodaka Naoki

1483
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:24,000
along with four other composers and he used a really interesting approach

1484
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:29,000
to the music. So the bass sounds were sampled

1485
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:34,000
so and it gave a lot more detail to the music

1486
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:39,000
and some of the songs were of course meant to resemble

1487
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Terminator music because at the time they were aiming for a Terminator license and they never got

1488
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:49,000
it. I mean it came out in 1984. Yeah I think there's actually a little clip from a magazine where it was previewed as a

1489
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Terminator game in a magazine and obviously that's not what we got. Although there is a hack out

1490
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:59,000
there where someone tried to redo it as a Terminator game. I mean it exists now. But

1491
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:04,000
there's also a sound test that's hidden on the title screen that if you press the B button

1492
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:09,000
33 times and then pressing start the sound test the screen will show up that gives

1493
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:14,000
you also an option for a number of continues to play with. But the music

1494
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:19,000
in here I just thought was really good. It was fairly unique. And I mean it is one of those

1495
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:24,000
LJN games you know. And we know what LJN is good for.

1496
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Barf. I mean it was an OK game. It really was an OK

1497
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:34,000
game. But the music is really what drives it for me. So we'll play some of this is like the

1498
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:39,000
third stage music or like the home base music or something. But do we

1499
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:44,000
want to. I can't I can't change the volume after that because it's in the video. But it should be strong enough in the background

1500
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:49,000
for them to hear. But at any rate there you go. This is my chosen soundtrack

1501
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:54,000
a soundtrack for February. Awesome. Good pick. And because when I wasn't

1502
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:59,000
really thinking about the soundtrack this game but it certainly has a good story behind it and get this music

1503
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:04,000
is very good. I mean this is just one year that base though. Yeah it's like stage

1504
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:09,000
three or something. But yeah I mean a lot of music in this game is pretty good. So oh yeah this is one of the

1505
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:14,000
soundtracks that I can just sit and listen all the way through. And like I said I don't really care for the game.

1506
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Music is amazing. Did you remember as points out this was a sunsoft title. Oh that's right sunsoft.

1507
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Still I was to say I thought. Yeah but a lot of sunsoft title had really strong music a lot of like

1508
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:29,000
blaster master had a freaking phenomenal soundtrack. I don't know why I thought LJN. Yeah.

1509
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:34,000
Oh because LJN got the terminator license. Ah that was it LJN got it.

1510
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:39,000
And of course you know LJN everything they do. They did. All right. Well there it is. Yeah.

1511
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:44,000
But just one other little thing about this one is that the

1512
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:49,000
other sound producers for programming were Hara Nobuyuki

1513
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Seiya Shinichi and Moroto Naohisa. So there you go. All right.

1514
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Your classic soundtrack of the month Journey to Silius not the

1515
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Terminator. But it could have been. And honestly if it was we would have at least had a great game

1516
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:09,000
soundtrack based on a movie. Right. All right. Awesome.

1517
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Well we're going to take a quick studio break here. And while we take a quick break in studio I want to

1518
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:19,000
go to a little special segment I taped earlier doing a little play through on Tetris

1519
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:24,000
99. So I thought we'd take a look at I'm sure a lot of you have played it at this point. But if you haven't

1520
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:29,000
had a chance to play Tetris 99 we're going to take a look at it. And for those I'm listening on the podcast

1521
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:34,000
feed I do do my very best to talk a lot through this. So it's about

1522
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:39,000
six or seven minutes if you want to check it out or maybe you just want to skip ahead to when we come back here

1523
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:44,000
on Orange Lounge Radio. But let me go ahead and kick it over to me earlier.

1524
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Hi there. It's Rob and we're on an in-studio break right now. So I thought

1525
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:56,000
during the break tonight we could take a look at this game that a lot of people are talking about this week.

1526
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:01,000
It's Tetris 99. It was announced as a surprise release during the Nintendo Direct

1527
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:06,000
and it's available for people that have the Nintendo online subscription trying to sweeten

1528
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:11,000
the pot a little bit outside of just the NES flicks and those types of things. So this is Tetris 99.

1529
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Again it's like a battle royale type of game but not a shooty shooty bang bang type of thing like

1530
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Fortnite or Apex Legends or what have you. Instead it's a puzzle game. It's Tetris.

1531
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:26,000
I think a lot of you know what Tetris is. I think you've probably played Tetris before. It's only one of the most popular

1532
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:31,000
video games of all time. So instead of 100 people it's 99 people but

1533
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:36,000
close enough. Right. So this is it. I mean we're looking at it here in on

1534
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:41,000
the screen and you know it's tracking my level. I played a little bit. So I'm level four right

1535
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:46,000
now but it doesn't really tell you what your level is for. It just shows that you have a

1536
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:51,000
level. And I notice that it does have my name for my Nintendo account. And right now my icon is

1537
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:56,000
a little sprout. So I'm assuming that maybe like as I grow in level that icon will change as well.

1538
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:01,000
And maybe that will affect who I get matched with. I don't know. I'm sure other

1539
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:06,000
people there have figured out the science and all that but I haven't yet. Otherwise you really have some barebone

1540
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:11,000
options here. You just have options where you can go in and do the settings. These are very standard

1541
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Tetris options. Do you want to use the hard drop which is where you can press up to actually drop the piece

1542
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:21,000
really fast or not have that enabled. And then you can change your control type from a couple

1543
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:26,000
different ideas here. I'm actually going to use the pro controller for playing this night.

1544
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:31,000
I have a splatoon pro controller. So one of the handles is green. So it's funny on the video it ends

1545
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:36,000
up being see through. But what can you do. So I just tend to use the standard stuff

1546
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:41,000
and then otherwise the game does track your stats. It'll show you you know like how many different

1547
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:46,000
types of lineups you've got and like what combos and how long you've been playing and so forth.

1548
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:51,000
But it doesn't really show you a lot outside of that. It's pretty bare bones. So let's

1549
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:56,000
go in and check out the actual Tetris 99 and play a quick game here so you guys can see

1550
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:01,000
what it's about.

1551
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:06,000
All right. So right now you can see it's actually matching

1552
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:11,000
all these other people. That's what all those other windows are in the background here as it counts down. It's trying to

1553
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:16,000
it'll give us about you know 100 seconds or so I'm assuming to actually find a match.

1554
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:21,000
And here we go. It's going to get started here in a minute.

1555
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:26,000
It's probably syncing everything up.

1556
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:31,000
Hopefully I don't lose my online connection. There we go. Oh my God. All these people attacking me all at once.

1557
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:36,000
You can. I'm using the left stick to control who I want to target.

1558
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:41,000
But you can also use the right stick where I'm going to target these people attacking me. Screw

1559
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:46,000
them. So let's see I'm going to try to hold bricks so you can hold bricks just like you could in the

1560
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:51,000
other variants of Tetris including Tetris Effect and some other versions of the game you've probably played.

1561
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Now I'm not getting the greatest pieces in the world here.

1562
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:04,000
And you'll see I kind of I walled myself in a little but maybe I can get myself

1563
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:09,000
out. There we go. I'm getting there. Oh I hit the up button too easy.

1564
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:14,000
And I accidentally dropped a piece too soon. And that is not going to be good.

1565
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:21,000
That's one thing you've got to be careful with in the pro controller. Wow I'm usually not this messy. It's only because I'm recording it

1566
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:26,000
that obviously this is a little bit of a nightmare right now. Let's see I want to get my bar in here to try

1567
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:31,000
to. Now I'm just kind of in cleanup mode.

1568
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:36,000
You can see that one person two people still have me targeted. So you can see those lines that are coming in right now which

1569
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:41,000
I think has been a meme that's kind of been around online as you know

1570
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:46,000
showing all these people targeting you and oh crap.

1571
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:53,000
But you'll notice with the right stick you can actually choose what you want to do. Do you want to.

1572
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:58,000
I did it again. I hit that button too easy. I think that's one of the problems using the control pro controller.

1573
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:04,000
But anyway with the with the right stick you can kind of choose. Do you want to do

1574
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:10,000
the people attacking you. I knocked somebody out. Do you want to do just random people. Do you want to do people that have the most

1575
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:15,000
badges. Who is it that you want to target in your quest to be on top of the heap.

1576
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:20,000
So right now it looks like I'm up to seventy four seventy three out of ninety eight people still in the match.

1577
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Not that 98 people were in the match. So one person must have a connection problem because usually you get ninety

1578
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:31,000
nine. That's not too shabby considering I am playing really

1579
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:36,000
sloppy here. And I do blame the pro controller and

1580
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:41,000
how easy it is to hit the button as a part of that.

1581
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:47,000
And I'm also just getting pieces I just don't like.

1582
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:53,000
What a mess.

1583
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:59,000
I'm sure I'm being made fun of in chat right now.

1584
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:07,000
I you know why I knocked somebody else out. So

1585
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:12,000
it's not going that bad. I think right now I'm kind of doing like

1586
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:17,000
I feel like this is what you would call on a reality TV competition and under the radar type of

1587
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:22,000
strategy. Like I'm doing OK. I'm keeping myself above water but I'm not doing well

1588
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:27,000
enough where the other players are going to attack me because I'm pretty sure the most common

1589
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:32,000
thing people probably set their R button to is attackers. They want to attack the people attacking them.

1590
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:37,000
Well I'm not clearing a lot of lines not really attacking a lot of people. So

1591
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:42,000
therefore I'm not getting a lot of B.S. coming in. Of course as I say that I'm getting targeted by

1592
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:47,000
three people now. So far so good. We're in the top 50 and you'll notice the music kind of picks up

1593
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:52,000
a little bit the further you get into the game. Oh I've got a big

1594
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:57,000
mess coming in soon. All right. This might be where I need to try to

1595
01:42:57,000 --> 01:43:02,000
work myself down a little bit.

1596
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:08,000
So I'm trying to work down right now so you can see just like in the Gameboy version of Tetris as other people.

1597
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Oh it went red as other people drop lines on you.

1598
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:18,000
It starts to just fill up the screen.

1599
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:23,000
Oh fuck. I hit the up button. That's going to kill me.

1600
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:28,000
Yeah that took me out. Oh well. But you can see

1601
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:33,000
so I ended up ranking 30th overall in that which isn't too shabby. I still leveled up

1602
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:38,000
out of it. And you can see not only you know as the other people kind of finish where they

1603
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:43,000
stand in the ranking but then you can kind of go up and down this list and you can actually see

1604
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:48,000
there's somebody I KO'd. So I got you Dr. Z. And let's see I think there was a couple

1605
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:53,000
others too. So Dimension D whoever that is. And then poor Ray

1606
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:58,000
in 98th place. But hey at least it wasn't the bottom of the barrel because there were

1607
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:03,000
99 people playing. So anyway if you haven't seen it yet there's a little bit of

1608
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:08,000
what Tetris 99 looks like. Obviously you know I'm a big fan of Tetris Attack.

1609
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:13,000
So or excuse me well I am a big fan of Tetris Attack but Tetris Effect

1610
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:18,000
I've been a big fan of that and talking about that a lot on the show. So it's kind of interesting we have these

1611
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:23,000
two big Tetris games but they're very very very different approaches. This is you know that kind

1612
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:28,000
of battle royale multiplayer you know attacking each other deal which Tetris

1613
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:33,000
Effect made a conscious decision to really not do any of that whatsoever.

1614
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Whereas Tetris Effect is really about kind of like you know the mode and the ambience and everything which

1615
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:43,000
this is a very kind of bare bones version of Tetris. So anyway but I really enjoy it. I think

1616
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:48,000
a lot of people are kind of picking this up and they're probably playing it for just you know a couple minutes at a time because that match

1617
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:53,000
really didn't take that long. That's probably about five minutes most. I mean maybe if I did a little better and I

1618
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:58,000
hadn't I hadn't kept sliding my thumb accidentally over to the up button which kept maybe

1619
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:03,000
that's why in the options I should actually consider keeping that hard drop off and then maybe that wouldn't happen

1620
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:08,000
to me so much. I don't know. But anyway I hope that this game just kind of continues to grow

1621
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:13,000
and that some of the rumors about additional modes that are being data mined and things like that end up being true because I

1622
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:18,000
think it'd be a lot of fun to keep playing for that multiplayer Tetris experience. So Tetris

1623
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:23,000
Effect is more for that single player getting in the zone and then this is very much multiplayer

1624
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:28,000
but it would be cool to have reasons why I'm leveling up and have the

1625
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:33,000
ability to play with friends and do some more matchmaking like that kind of some of those more modes you see in

1626
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Fortnite. But you know for a game that you're getting essentially for free with a Nintendo Online

1627
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:43,000
subscription you know to play things like Mario Kart Online and stuff it's really not that bad. So

1628
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:48,000
there it is. A look at Tetris 99. So let's go back to tonight's episode

1629
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:53,000
of Orange Lounge Radio in the studio. Thank you me.

1630
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:58,000
It's me here in the studio and continuing on with tonight's Orange Lounge Radio. Hope you

1631
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:03,000
enjoyed that little look at Tetris 99. That was the first time you'd actually seen that right Loki because you downloaded it but you haven't really played it right?

1632
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:08,000
Yeah I haven't played it. What did you think? It looks fun. Yeah. Yeah. I'll probably play it. Darsakra you

1633
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:13,000
didn't seem as keen on it. I hate competition. I really don't like competitive games and this

1634
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:18,000
just doesn't sound at all interesting to me. If I'm going to play Tetris I want to fucking play Tetris

1635
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:23,000
the way it was intended by my fucking self. Well and you know

1636
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:28,000
and as I tried. Go ahead. I used to do Tetranet and but I was still

1637
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:33,000
didn't get that overwhelming people are going to ruin my fucking game by playing

1638
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:38,000
you know even when I play P.O.P.O. I play by myself. I'm just playing against the computer. Well and I think

1639
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:43,000
you know and as I tried to kind of point out in the video I think that's why you kind of that's why this can coexist with Tetris

1640
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Effect because I think Tetris Effect is like that's your game because and to be fair

1641
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:53,000
I actually I as much as I've enjoyed Tetris 99 is kind of like like a sideshow I think Tetris

1642
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Effect is still like that's the Tetris if I just was like I want to sit down and like play some Tetris I'm going to play Tetris

1643
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:03,000
Effect because that's the one that's really going to immerse me in it and just kind of like but if I just want I need a

1644
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:08,000
five minute distraction. I need something akin to a cell phone game as I play for a hot minute. Tetris

1645
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:13,000
99 is really good at filling that void I think. Yeah. You know what though M.N. Ziba in our

1646
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:18,000
chat is kind of with you DarkSakura M.N. Ziba says this is really fun to watch but I would never

1647
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:23,000
be good enough to play. I'm sure I'm sure you'd be fine. You do better than poor Ray did in that video.

1648
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:28,000
It's always inevitable like at least if you can get through like the first few blocks you're not going to be 19 98 and 99.

1649
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:33,000
It's the same thing in Fortnite. I think there's people that try to be 100th place in Fortnite

1650
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:38,000
or something because I feel like even when I played Fortnite I had no idea what the fuck I was doing. I still was able to get up

1651
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:43,000
into like the 60s just by like running and hiding. Right. Because you have people like my son

1652
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:48,000
playing the game. And so I mean like anybody can be him. Yeah. Right.

1653
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:54,000
Let's see. And Bobby pointing out that we both used our own Twitch streaming set up to show Tetris

1654
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:59,000
99. Yeah. Kind of funny. Something a little different. I was trying to figure out because obviously Jamie's

1655
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:04,000
here in the studio tonight and we've been using the classic game of the week ever since we moved over to Twitch. We've

1656
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:09,000
kind of been using that to sort of bridge between the two parts. And the other time Jamie

1657
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:14,000
was here in studio we actually had that listener email that kind of helped us bridge the parts. But I

1658
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:19,000
would like to in the future and just throwing this out there for all of you out there who are streamers on Twitch

1659
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:24,000
or whatever else. We would love to get like 10 minute segments of you

1660
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:29,000
featuring like a game like in your backlog especially indie games other current games

1661
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:34,000
like just talking about like why you enjoy it. Obviously we would prefer you don't do like retro stuff

1662
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:39,000
because Jamie's already doing a classic game of the week. But we would love to see like maybe you know indie stuff or

1663
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:43,000
just stuff that maybe you want more people to hear about. If you just want to do like a little 10 minute segment

1664
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:47,000
like I think we're going to be looking to put more things like that in our break space.

1665
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:52,000
But if we don't get a lot of submissions then I'll start to attack my steam backlog and play other random

1666
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:57,000
stuff. We'll see. We'll try to fill that in with other fun stuff. But all right.

1667
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:02,000
Anyhow let's move on. We've got some more news to get into in a segment called

1668
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:07,000
Rapid Fire News. So I think Loki start us off. Yep. There's a game

1669
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:12,000
that's coming out pretty soon in April called Dangerous Driving.

1670
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:17,000
Now Dangerous Driving is a game by Three Fields Entertainment who did

1671
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:23,000
Danger Zone and Danger Zone 2. You may remember those as kind of burnout

1672
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:28,000
esque. It's I think it's actually the old team that did the burnout series

1673
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:33,000
and so the danger zone is more like the crash mode in those.

1674
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Whereas Dangerous Driving is like the traditional burnout type game.

1675
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:43,000
And so it's actually going to be. They

1676
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:48,000
said that they had a preview of it that was unlockable at the end of Danger Zone 2 that you could

1677
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:53,000
actually drive in there. And I got to say by watching the trailer.

1678
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:58,000
Yeah it's just straight up copying burnout. I mean it's yeah

1679
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:03,000
it's like almost like burnout take down all over again. So dangerous because I

1680
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:08,000
missed those games. Yeah. Dangerous driving is going to be available digitally for 30 bucks on April 9th.

1681
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:13,000
And then they're also doing a physical version for consoles with it comes with danger zone 2

1682
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:18,000
for thirty nine ninety nine. I really if the theme song is not danger zone

1683
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:23,000
I'm going to be very upset. I don't. Well danger zone was it's a different game and

1684
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:28,000
I don't think they had danger zone that could be the theme song everything. But I do love the name dangerous

1685
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:33,000
driving dangerous driving dangerous. And then of course

1686
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:38,000
Microsoft is pushing out an update for their

1687
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:43,000
solitaire games which you know they've been like like solitaire is on every every computer. Yes.

1688
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:48,000
So Klondike spider freestyle pyramid and tri peaks all of

1689
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:53,000
those are getting a leveling system so you can actually

1690
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:58,000
level up in the game by playing more of the game. So

1691
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:03,000
neat. That's kind of odd. What would you do

1692
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:08,000
for a Klondike level. Because Klondike saw forget it. Yeah

1693
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:13,000
I got it. It just wasn't funny there. But you're going

1694
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:18,000
to get experience points and rewards and it's also meant to track your progress and grab new badges and stuff

1695
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:23,000
to go along with it. And if I remember correctly I think these are free anyways. They come with it's

1696
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:28,000
like it's like the quintessential windows thing that's on every computer. Yeah.

1697
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:33,000
All right. I'm not playing it so I've I've peaked at solitaire

1698
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:38,000
a couple of times. I think I looked at some of those Microsoft like Windows 10 games because they had achievements in them

1699
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:43,000
and I was like what easy achievements can I get on like word a minute. And I know there's

1700
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:48,000
there's a few free things in my sweeper. Yeah mine sweeper has achievements and stuff. So I was like what

1701
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:53,000
easy achievements can I get. And I've gotten a few like low hanging fruit achievement points on games like this. And I'm sure

1702
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:58,000
this whole RPG solitaire leveling up in solitaire is going to add more easy

1703
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:03,000
achievements and things to you know just inflate your EP which is what it's all about at the end of the day.

1704
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:08,000
Right. Right. Exactly. Anyway we've been talking tonight about some battle royale

1705
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:13,000
games and of course now in 2019 you can't talk battle royale without mentioning

1706
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:18,000
apex legends because that has really taken over. But some data miners

1707
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:23,000
finding that perhaps there are some new modes that will be coming to apex legends.

1708
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:28,000
This is a fortnight data miner who turned their sights on apex legends who found references in the

1709
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:33,000
code to a solo mode and two man squad mode because right now

1710
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:38,000
apex legends part of what makes it a little different is that it's a three person. Yeah you play in squads

1711
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:43,000
of three and that's actually part of the reason why I've been a little hesitant to play it because I don't know what the frick I'm doing

1712
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:48,000
and like the tutorial only gets you so far. You don't really get to practice in an environment with people.

1713
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:53,000
So I'm a little nervous about getting in there with like real people. But I guess my understanding is there's

1714
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:58,000
a lot of idiots that get in there and don't know what they're doing. So

1715
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:03,000
maybe I'll be OK. I don't know. But I would love if there was like a solo mode that I could kind of poke around

1716
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:08,000
in first. I'm not opposed to playing on teams. I just want to know what the fuck I'm doing before I do it. I feel like

1717
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:13,000
the tutorial wallets kind of good is not good enough for

1718
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:18,000
me. And then one other little tidbit about Tekken 7 which is a game I

1719
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:23,000
still need to pick up. I really do. Dark soccer. You were kind of into Tekken 7 though right. Didn't you know.

1720
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:28,000
Oh I thought you were checking out the new one. I got you confused somebody else. Anyway I'll be honest. The last one I

1721
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:33,000
really enjoyed was Tekken 4. OK. Yeah. Well I think I honestly think a lot of people are kind of with you

1722
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:38,000
like the early Tekken games like they haven't played one in a while but I heard this new one's good like Tekken 7

1723
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:43,000
is pretty good. It's a good place to pick up. Well some new DLC characters are coming out on February 28th

1724
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:48,000
including Julia and the very

1725
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:53,000
hyped Walking Dead crossover Negan is coming to Tekken and that is on February

1726
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:58,000
28th. So not too far away from that. I did want to do the whole Geese Howard thing

1727
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:03,000
because that was pretty fun. Yeah. You know because Dan and I just would went on this

1728
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:08,000
rampage just watching all things Geese Howard. It was pretty funny. I didn't know there was that

1729
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:13,000
much Geese Howard stuff to watch. But then again you know I got that.

1730
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:18,000
I thought I said this to you too Jamie. I don't know if you ever installed it or what but Twitch was given away a bunch

1731
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:23,000
of old SNK games or something at one point and he had them all. I figured that was going to happen.

1732
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:28,000
But I was like well if anybody is going to like this Jamie will. But you can play like Fatal Fury Special which is

1733
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:33,000
awesome. So I also have several copies of Fatal Fury

1734
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:38,000
Special. That's cool. And I think it's either Fatal Fury

1735
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:43,000
Special or Fatal Fury 2 that I actually have on Neo Geo. Yeah. That was like my favorite like Street Fighter

1736
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:48,000
knockoff. Well besides I guess Mortal Kombat. But you know how SNK had a ton of those fighter games. That was my favorite

1737
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:53,000
was Fatal Fury. Anyway Darcigro what do you have for us for rapid fire news. Oh

1738
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:57,000
well I am not a fan at all of VR.

1739
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:02,000
There are people out there who are Five Nights at Freddy's is going to be doing a VR

1740
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:07,000
that lets you repair the animatronics. So I'm sure that there will

1741
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:12,000
be people out there who will enjoy being a repair person and playing it in VR while

1742
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:17,000
you know potentially being murdered by the said things that you're repairing. But it is

1743
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:22,000
it's called Five Nights at Freddy's VR help wanted only right now

1744
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:27,000
listen for PS4 but they're expecting other outlets and it should be out in 2019

1745
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:32,000
sometime. Hey look it's a game you can play Rob. I will not be live

1746
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:37,000
streaming this game. Oh that's OK. I will never play it. Why would you want to

1747
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:42,000
repair them. Leave them broken. Don't repair the demons

1748
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:47,000
and another VR game is

1749
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:52,000
and honestly I'm not like super excited about harmonics anymore but harmonics has

1750
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:57,000
announced a game called Otica that's a VR rhythm

1751
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:02,000
shooter and it looks like you basically just pick different targets and you shoot

1752
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:07,000
at them with your virtual move gun dildos. So

1753
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:12,000
and I guess it changes the notes or changes the music around. So I

1754
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:17,000
don't get why they couldn't have just done this with a controller but well

1755
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:22,000
VR. I hate VR. But to be OK. You but you have

1756
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:27,000
and this is understandable but you have physical challenges to yours that it's

1757
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:32,000
annoying. Why. I just never have enjoyed it. I

1758
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:37,000
hate to say I think you're tainted because you had that one game that I like to gamer X

1759
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:42,000
but you have the physical limitations and I think of course and that's understandable

1760
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:47,000
but I don't like having to wear something on my head to immerse myself in a game but that it's

1761
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:52,000
not going to be that way forever. I would rather have the holodeck. I would be happy with that.

1762
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:57,000
I don't like having to wear this heavy painful thing on my head to immerse myself

1763
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:02,000
in something when the sensation of having it on my head takes me out of the immersion immediately. Well what

1764
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:07,000
about since you brought up hollow what about like something like hollow lens which is more like glasses and it's not like

1765
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:12,000
a heavy component on the head or whatever. I can still I'd still be able

1766
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:17,000
to not be immersed. It's just on top of that too. I mean it's just

1767
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:22,000
also very overstimulating. I really do not enjoy it. The only reason I like that one game

1768
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:27,000
that I played is because the color palette was so limited in it that it really didn't hurt my eyes too

1769
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:32,000
much to play it. And but I still felt out of the environment

1770
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:37,000
I could still hear everybody around me. I could still feel everything around me. And the difference

1771
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:42,000
between the two is really unsettling for me. So I hate VR. I really hate VR.

1772
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:47,000
And if other people like it good for them. I hope you guys enjoy these games.

1773
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:52,000
But I mean certainly not me. I think something like well talking about like why

1774
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:57,000
can't the games exist on a monitor. I think a lot of people have been asked that question about something like beat saver like

1775
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:02,000
why can't that exist in a monitor space. But I know there's a lot to do with

1776
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:07,000
not just about like hitting the note on a line but it's

1777
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:12,000
kind of part of like the depth perception and that kind of plays into the actual mechanic of the game

1778
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:17,000
and the finesse of following through the moves and so forth. Honestly it's very obvious that these games are invented by people

1779
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:22,000
who have no concept of what autistic people live with. So I'm completely

1780
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:27,000
I would hate to find a study that shows that perhaps there are those types of folks that work on

1781
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:32,000
these games because that would be contradicting a bit. Except that

1782
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:37,000
a lot of problems that we have also have to do with depth perception and

1783
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:42,000
overstimulation. And a lot of these are highly bright light with

1784
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:47,000
no way to get away from it unless you take the thing off your head and leave the game.

1785
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:52,000
And I really I can't see how any of this would be friendly

1786
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:57,000
to autistic people. I'll be curious to see if anybody's possibly done a study on that.

1787
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:02,000
All right. Well let's move on. We want to travel around the world and check out some release dates and check out some

1788
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:07,000
games that are coming out soon to a console near you. Starting

1789
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:12,000
off with the US. So we have 8 bit adventure Steins Gate coming out on

1790
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:17,000
the Switch. Death and Request on PlayStation 4.

1791
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:22,000
Steins Gate Elite on PC, Switch, and PlayStation 4.

1792
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:27,000
And yet another Steins Gate game. Steins Gate Linear Bounded Phenogram on

1793
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:32,000
PC and PlayStation 4. And then we've got

1794
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:37,000
Aragami Shadow Edition on the Nintendo Switch. And Phoenix Wright Ace

1795
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:42,000
Attorney Trilogy on the Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. And oh my

1796
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:47,000
god we're already here. Anthem coming out on PC, PlayStation

1797
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:52,000
4, and Xbox One. It's like it just snuck up on

1798
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:57,000
us. Hopefully it doesn't suck. I'll just let that moment of silence speak for itself.

1799
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:02,000
That's it. Oh okay. Traveling to Japan and checking out the release

1800
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:07,000
dates over there. Starting off with the PlayStation 4 on the 21st of February. We have

1801
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:12,000
Gaikuten Saiban 123 Noruhodo Selection.

1802
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:17,000
That's Phoenix Wright. Oh is it? Oh. So it must be, oh so they're putting the

1803
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Phoenix Wright games on PS4. Right I just said the Phoenix Wright trilogy's coming out.

1804
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:27,000
Got it. Okay. Makes sense. Sorry. Alright. Cool. Also coming out.

1805
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:32,000
Taekano Gaito Daki Shimete in regular and limited edition.

1806
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:36,000
That's from Entergram so I don't think that's anything that they have over here.

1807
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:41,000
Also NG is coming out from Experience Inc. And a re-release

1808
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:46,000
I believe of Nier Automata because it's a game of the Yorha edition.

1809
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:51,000
I think that they're using like Nier speak for that stuff. That is coming out as well. And I like the name of this

1810
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:56,000
game. Daito Shoukan no Hitsuji Kai. Library

1811
02:00:56,000 --> 02:01:01,000
party comes out in regular and limited edition. It makes me think of that. What was that

1812
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:06,000
horrible show? The show on MTV. The Quiet Library. Which I'm sure

1813
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:11,000
had to have been ripped off another country's television station or something. It was awesome.

1814
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:16,000
It couldn't have been a concept that they came up with here. Quickly looking at the Switch. That same Phoenix

1815
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:21,000
Wright collection is also making its way to the Switch in Japan this week. And a game

1816
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:26,000
called Girls und Panzer Dream Tank Match DX in a regular

1817
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:31,000
and special box edition. I bet that's an awesome box art. We'll just leave it at that.

1818
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:36,000
It's probably tank girls. Like they're literally tanks. Because I've seen the ones where they're literally

1819
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:41,000
jets. Yeah. So why not? Why not? Well why not? We love

1820
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:46,000
the Guardian legend and that started Jet Girl. So why not?

1821
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:51,000
We did get the Guardian before Jamie Hewlett gave us Jet Girl.

1822
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:56,000
Alright. Moving on to Europe though. Darsagra. So for European releases we

1823
02:01:56,000 --> 02:02:01,000
have. Let's see. On the. Is it.

1824
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:06,000
Okay. On tomorrow the 18th. Which is already. Oh it's nevermind. It's a pre-order. Whatever.

1825
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:11,000
For Steins Gate Elite. God these are. Okay.

1826
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:16,000
On the 21st we have Aragami Shadow Edition. The Game That

1827
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:21,000
Shall Not Be Mentioned. Also on the 21st. Dirt Rally 2.0 Deluxe Edition.

1828
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:26,000
8-Bit Invaders out on February 25th.

1829
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:31,000
And let me see if I've got any. Oh that's next week so nevermind.

1830
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:36,000
I'm not going to talk about The Game That Shall Not Be Mentioned.

1831
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:42,000
I hope it fails. Yeah I have some thoughts and feelings. But we'll move

1832
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:47,000
on. We'll move on to your thoughts and feelings in our mailbag segment because every week you guys send us emails.

1833
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:52,000
Participate at OrangeLaundryRadio.com is the place to send us an email which I just realized I left out

1834
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:57,000
of the little sidebar. But oops that happens. But I'll say it again. Participate at OrangeLaundryRadio.com

1835
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:02,000
and I think we have. I mean we're on episode 764 so I mean really like. We did change

1836
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:07,000
it like 500 episodes in though. Because we were getting the invitation to spam. Okay well I'm sorry

1837
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:12,000
that you've only known about it for you know like a few years now. All right. Sorry.

1838
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:17,000
Regardless. Dark Soccer you're here. I think I think they showed you mercy tonight and only sent one

1839
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:22,000
email. It's a big one though. All right. Well it's somebody I enjoy hearing from though. Yes.

1840
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:27,000
Hey OLR crew. AZHP here. I have been really behind on podcasts. Me too.

1841
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:32,000
And as a result every time I hear something on the show I want to write about I think

1842
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:37,000
they've probably forgotten they've said that already. I guess I won't bother writing in. Well this topic

1843
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:42,000
is no different but it was so important I felt compelled to write anyway.

1844
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:47,000
A few weeks ago you mentioned that a Chrono Cross concert would be held for its 20th anniversary in Japan.

1845
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:52,000
Initially brushed that off as ha too bad it's in Japan. Then I realized I had bought my wife

1846
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:57,000
and okay it's not my wife and I it's my wife and me or myself.

1847
02:03:57,000 --> 02:04:02,000
That would be grammatically correct. Tickets to Japan. You don't say I would buy I bought I stuff.

1848
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:07,000
You say I bought me stuff. Just saying. Tickets to Japan for not one week

1849
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:12,000
not one week ago owing to the fact that nonstop flights were 655 from SFO

1850
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:17,000
to ANA. An unbelievably low price for that airline from that airport.

1851
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:23,000
We were scheduled to be there for two weeks in November and so I checked hoping against hope that the tour

1852
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:28,000
would be there when we were. The dates line up and I am going to be hitting F5 on that page

1853
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:33,000
for several months until the ticket sale date is announced. So thank you so much OLR you let me know

1854
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:38,000
about an amazing event for a game that was super important to my childhood. One with the best soundtracks

1855
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:43,000
in gaming history. And besides that you know it's not me if I don't do grammar corrections please don't

1856
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:48,000
take it personally blah blah blah blah blah. Okay. Speaking of Chrono Cross in this music a new free to play game

1857
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:53,000
came out on phones in America recently called Another Eden the cat beyond time and space and yes I know about it

1858
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:58,000
and yes the music is good. It is. I haven't started it yet but I listened to some from the game.

1859
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:03,000
Sorry what was it called. It's called Another Eden the cat beyond time and space. I don't know that one.

1860
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:08,000
I'll check it out. It was not only written by the writer for Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross but the main

1861
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:13,000
theme is composed by the composer for Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross. The game

1862
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:18,000
is thematically very similar to Chrono Trigger and the music is like a love letter to Chrono Cross

1863
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:23,000
with the instrument selection and keys the songs closely mirroring that of many songs in Chrono Cross.

1864
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:28,000
The art is gorgeous as well and the writing is some of the best writing I've seen in a JRPG

1865
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:33,000
bone gamer no random side quests which in any other game would have been a crummy

1866
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:38,000
thrown together story or rich and compelling in Another Eden. The gameplay is traditional

1867
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:43,000
turn based JRPG fare which and mostly

1868
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:48,000
in service of delivering the story which you have no complaints about and most importantly the game

1869
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:53,000
despite being free to play has no paywalls. All of the amazing story can be completed

1870
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:58,000
with the default characters in the game although you can buy loot boxes if you so choose to obtain stronger

1871
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:03,000
units. From what I have heard they are only necessary for clearing end game content

1872
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:08,000
which has no story in it and there are no timers or limited events or

1873
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:13,000
anything else to distract from the experience or make you pull out your wallet. I will admit that I

1874
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:18,000
paid $24 for a one time guaranteed 5 star unit that they were selling as a launch promotion which

1875
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:23,000
I feel is a fitting price to pay for this game.

1876
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:28,000
There's nothing wrong with tipping a little coin in if you enjoy the game. Support the developers. It's your money your decision.

1877
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:33,000
Yep. You don't have to justify it to anybody. No guilt no shame. I honestly think that

1878
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:38,000
this game was a passion project for the developers and most likely the only way they were able to get the game

1879
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:43,000
greenlit in this day and age was to design it as a free to play game. By the way one thing

1880
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:48,000
Rob. Frog is in the game. Oh weird. OK. Yeah. That's kind of nice. As his

1881
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:53,000
original name which right now my brain was Glenn Glenn. Yeah I think he's in there as Glenn. Well

1882
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:58,000
unless that was a translation thing. But I believe in the US version was Glenn.

1883
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:03,000
Let me get back. Design is a free to play game. OK. Because that was the name of my ex. That's how I

1884
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:08,000
know that. Well we don't talk about those things do we. It was a long time ago.

1885
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:13,000
You know what. Sometimes exes are like ill fitting underwear. You just have to throw them away.

1886
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:19,000
As much as game as much as gamer opinion is negative about free to play mobile

1887
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:24,000
games like this. When the quality is this high I'm glad that the model exists to bring quality content like this

1888
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:29,000
to the market. Game has been out for two years in Japan and appears profitable

1889
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:34,000
has won game awards for innovation and creativity. I'm looking forward to experiencing this for myself

1890
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:39,000
and recommend any fan of Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross. Sorry for the lengthy email. I just got so excited

1891
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:44,000
thinking about Chrono Cross and had to write in and ramble about it. Oh no am I getting old now.

1892
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:49,000
Yours truly is HP. We all are. Do not even.

1893
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:54,000
Or as dark soccer might say in another time and place girl.

1894
02:07:56,000 --> 02:08:01,000
Oh my levels of girl now have been elaborate.

1895
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:07,000
I will leave it at that. Especially watching the in a drag race.

1896
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:13,000
All right. But we can't talk about drag race now because we did get an email this week. So I'll have to save it for another week.

1897
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:19,000
It's done. But there it is. That's it for the emails tonight. Participate at orange launch radio dot com is the place to send your email.

1898
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:24,000
And we would love to hear from you in a future week. In the meantime let's go to Loki

1899
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:29,000
with our next story. Yes. So they're doing some updates.

1900
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:34,000
Well Red Dead Online they've basically got

1901
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:39,000
some news that they're going to do the fight griefing in the game. So I haven't really

1902
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:44,000
actually got a chance to I don't know like honestly read that online

1903
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:49,000
seems very boring to me versus like say Grand Theft Auto online where you actually have well they've been adding

1904
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:54,000
like go carts and or not go carts RC carts into the game instead of you know

1905
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:59,000
stuff. But what can you really do with horses except unicorns. And so actually

1906
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:04,000
you know what I take that back. You know what they could do is they could do the whole undead nightmare stuff because that's you can eat horse.

1907
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:11,000
Yeah I think you could do that in the original game too. But don't you want it. You don't want to eat zombie horse because then you

1908
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:17,000
would turn into a zombie right. You don't eat zombie into a zombie horse. Well

1909
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:22,000
some turn into a zombie centaur. So they're doing some

1910
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:27,000
rebalancing of the weapons in the game as well. So this update is coming out on February

1911
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:32,000
26 and it's supposed to add new daily challenges to the game.

1912
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:37,000
On top of that they're working on some of the griefing that's in there.

1913
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:42,000
But really like what is there to actually do in there. They're saying minimize certain destructive player behaviors.

1914
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:49,000
So I guess well they don't want to tell you what they're doing is they don't want you to go do them before they fix them. That's what's that's

1915
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:54,000
why they're not being very descriptive on what players are doing to grieve each other.

1916
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:59,000
Yeah. So the basically the system the way to describe it is kind of like Grand Theft Auto lines

1917
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:04,000
mental state mechanics. So the way that worked was like if you

1918
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:09,000
were an asshole online and several infractions

1919
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:14,000
would put you in with the asshole pool. And so you only got to play with the

1920
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:19,000
assholes for a few weeks. So like if you were a cheater in the

1921
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:24,000
game you have put in with all the other cheaters and you had to play with them. It's like OK you you're in your own playground

1922
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:29,000
with those assholes. So now they're going to do something similar that in

1923
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:34,000
Red Dead Online they're also going to be doing bounty hunting as

1924
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:39,000
well. So that apparently if you're overly aggressive and break the law often

1925
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:44,000
you'll have a bounty put on your head which is I think also similar to Grand Theft Auto. I know they

1926
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:49,000
have a bounty system you could do with that as well. Yeah.

1927
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:54,000
And some new weapons. I don't know. This isn't really getting me to jump into the game.

1928
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:59,000
Well Fantas in our chat at VOG Network on Twitch said I just bought Red Dead Redemption 2

1929
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:04,000
went on sale finally. So you know well you are a single player game here is really

1930
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:09,000
good. I still haven't played through the whole thing because it's just there's a little too much survival in it

1931
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:14,000
for my taste. But I do need to go back. I never really finished Red Dead Redemption you wanted death.

1932
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:20,000
Well I wanted me death or don't get I wanted I wanted like Grand Theft Auto in the Wild West.

1933
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:25,000
I didn't want OK. I had to buy some. I had to eat and I had to sleep and I had to go. Oh no

1934
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:30,000
that was not in Grand Theft Auto 5. My real life is for is exactly like I don't want to have

1935
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:35,000
to like you know take baths and like you know like shave myself

1936
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:40,000
in the game. No seriously these are all things you do in the game because you get smelly

1937
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:45,000
or you yeah you have a beard. Do you have to wash your balls. Is that. Well you

1938
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:50,000
take a bath and if you play your cards right you can get a woman to wash your balls in the game.

1939
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:55,000
Well maybe I don't want a woman to wash my balls. Well I don't know maybe they have men that wash your balls in there.

1940
02:11:55,000 --> 02:12:00,000
I haven't played the game enough but all I know is like they have you

1941
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:05,000
can you can do that. But I just don't want to do all that crap.

1942
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:10,000
I just want to play a game where I shoot things and run around and do crazy stuff. That's what

1943
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:15,000
Grand Theft Auto was. You know you do it. And I had a lot of fun in Grand Theft Auto because I didn't have to do all that

1944
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:20,000
bullshit. All right.

1945
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:26,000
Let's see guys you know in chat says it was in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas you could eat

1946
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:31,000
workout in Grand Theft Auto five you shower. Was that a thing.

1947
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:36,000
I don't you play those games more than I do. Well showering aside she was the sideshow type of showering

1948
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:41,000
you could do like I know you could shower in Grand Theft Auto

1949
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:46,000
online and then they had a funny thing where if you apparently if you sing in the shower you

1950
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:51,000
get extra experience points. It's basically making any noise in the shower.

1951
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:56,000
But they also did that too with like the strippers and stuff to you could talk to the

1952
02:12:56,000 --> 02:13:01,000
strippers and as you shower to get the blood off. Oh OK. That sounds so appealing.

1953
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:06,000
All right. Let's let's move on to something a little more wholesome please. Can we talk

1954
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:11,000
about Minecraft. Wholesome fun for the whole family. Minecraft there's another

1955
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:16,000
update for Minecraft where I guess I guess fans are kind of taking this on a little snapshot update

1956
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:21,000
went into the game and paintings can I guess animate. So paintings

1957
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:26,000
in Minecraft before used a single texture and now modders allowed the paintings to

1958
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:31,000
change. So they've done some creative things with this by basically making TVs.

1959
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:36,000
So but the TV like images and files they get really big because they're

1960
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:41,000
you know they got to have like. Yeah. All the way it's drawn out everything just pink

1961
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:46,000
files. They're not really compressed I don't think in these types of formats anyway either. So

1962
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:51,000
they get really big. But I thought the one that's highlighted in this particular article I'm looking at that I thought was

1963
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:55,000
very meta and funny was from a Reddit user named Hope

1964
02:13:55,000 --> 02:14:00,000
Abandoner who made a pixelated Minecraft YouTube video of somebody

1965
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:05,000
playing Minecraft. Get it. Yeah. So you can you can what yo dog I heard you like

1966
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:10,000
Minecraft. So now you can watch Minecraft while you Minecraft. So I just thought that was pretty

1967
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:15,000
like the Gravity Falls pictures. Those are really nice looking. Yeah. Apparently though those files are like gigantic

1968
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:20,000
again because they don't really compress like it was what 100 makes a space for like 30 frames. So you can't

1969
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:25,000
you're not good. Although that inside the somebody put B movie in Minecraft because of course

1970
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:30,000
they did. There's just certain things you always know people are going to do and putting B

1971
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:34,000
movie is going to be one of them. Anyway.

1972
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:39,000
Minecraft. Good times. You know my buddy of mine started a server and there's like a lot of people playing on it

1973
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:44,000
and they've done a lot of cool work in there and then I log in and I'm just lost. I'm like these guys

1974
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:49,000
these guys are pro Minecraft and I don't know what I'm doing. Oh well I need to do our server the fog

1975
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:54,000
server and then they'll be all screwed up again. I know you'd like to do like I don't know.

1976
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:59,000
I want to do mods again but like we need to have like some more survival

1977
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:04,000
server where we actually work together to do something because Loki's plain vanilla server with

1978
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:08,000
5000 mods on it. All right.

1979
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:13,000
Moving on let's talk about Minecraft is educational. So let's keep it educational. Dark

1980
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:17,000
Sakura. Well this actually

1981
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:22,000
is coming from like a paper in Texas but some students

1982
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:27,000
at Texas A&M boosted students scores in calculus

1983
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:32,000
by making an educational video game. The game is called variant limits and

1984
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:37,000
it connects the way that math and the gameplay work together in this

1985
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:42,000
3D environment. And they use geo magnetic storms that

1986
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:47,000
threaten their planet's survival. And so they have to solve a series of increasingly challenging calculus

1987
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:52,000
problems. And so as they could apply it into their game it made the

1988
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:57,000
concept work in real life or on paper for tests or whatever. So

1989
02:15:57,000 --> 02:16:02,000
they had some students play for like eight hours a day.

1990
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:07,000
And they were fine. They got more out of it than they did by studying

1991
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:12,000
their textbooks. That's a lot of play. And it became really fun. Then again I know people

1992
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:17,000
that play MMOs that much so I guess can't talk. But they said

1993
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:22,000
that 22 to 38 percent of university students depending on their preparation

1994
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:27,000
failed calculus at more than 200 colleges that participated in a particular

1995
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:32,000
study about this. So they are hoping

1996
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:37,000
they're actually going to be showing variant limits at the Texas

1997
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:42,000
A&M Powerhouse. Hold on let me see.

1998
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:47,000
Yeah and the Texas A&M House at the upcoming SXSW Interactive

1999
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:52,000
Festival in Austin Texas on March 10th through 12th. So there you go. I was kind of wondering

2000
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:57,000
if like a regular person could get their hands on this game just to maybe help their own knowledge if they want to learn

2001
02:16:57,000 --> 02:17:02,000
a little more about calculus. Well the study itself actually took place in fall of 2018 that involved

2002
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:07,000
more than 2000 Texas A&M engineering calculus students. So half

2003
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:12,000
of them played variant limits and the other half just had to do normal study.

2004
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:17,000
Well yeah you always have your control group. You have your control. But 79 percent

2005
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:22,000
of the students agreed that the game increased their knowledge limits and

2006
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:27,000
83 percent reported they were able to apply their knowledge from the game in class. So

2007
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:32,000
they go. Oh and also the students performed well regardless

2008
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:37,000
of racial or gender identity. Well they will. Yeah. Which I think there's no

2009
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:42,000
no problem. But this is Texas. Fair enough. Fair enough. Yeah. So

2010
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:47,000
I think is worth mentioning that they threw that in Texas.

2011
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:52,000
Go figure. All those sorts of things have no no

2012
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:57,000
difference on your capability to understand math and learn math. Yeah.

2013
02:17:57,000 --> 02:18:02,000
Go figure. Who knew. Obviously a slash sarcastic. But

2014
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:07,000
you know I still think it's pretty neat that a video game is being used to you know teach it like this

2015
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:12,000
high of a level like you know when we think of the educational type of games we think like Oregon Trail number

2016
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:17,000
Munchers and you know that. But it's kind of neat that gaming as a teaching tool at

2017
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:22,000
this complex of a college calculus level which I don't know about you guys like

2018
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:27,000
I learned a little bit of that math stuff like the high end stuff but I don't really

2019
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:32,000
despite the fact that I was like oh you'll use this year you need to know this because I was too busy programming games in my calculator.

2020
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:37,000
OK. But I don't use I like AP calculus

2021
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:42,000
I don't use it in my never took calculus when I was taking algebra in

2022
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:47,000
college for my major teacher puts up this whole big diagram on the thing like you're

2023
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:52,000
having to figure out the perimeter banner for this board and you're

2024
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:57,000
missing this calculation. What do you do. And I just said I'll ask my client.

2025
02:18:57,000 --> 02:19:02,000
And she just looks at me and I'm like is that really what you do. I was like yeah I'd ask my client

2026
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:07,000
this was to get me all the measurements like OK.

2027
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:12,000
Yeah I would I would say algebra you use maybe even a little bit of

2028
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:17,000
like the geometry maybe trade had to use it to do a

2029
02:19:17,000 --> 02:19:22,000
an accruing calculation in a number spreadsheet because I had to put in the equation.

2030
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:27,000
I do think if you can prove that you can use a computer to answer all your questions that should be

2031
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:32,000
you know but I don't know I'm we need to teach people in office spaces to learn how to use a

2032
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:37,000
V look up in Excel because my God I've had so many people keep up this Excel

2033
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:42,000
file against this other Excel file. Can you just type equals V look up and then

2034
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:47,000
you know just do that yourself.

2035
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:52,000
People just need to only know what they know. People need to learn that

2036
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:59,000
you need to learn how to move with the times and just because you've always done something

2037
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:04,000
one way doesn't always mean that there's not a better way to do it and that you

2038
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:09,000
should be willing to adapt to learn different things that are going to increase your productivity and make you work

2039
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:14,000
smarter not harder. All right let's move on and

2040
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:19,000
to one more. No two more stories for you guys. So going to Loki.

2041
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:24,000
Yes. So this is kind of a funny story. So valve had to update the steam

2042
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:29,000
VR API because apparently they were having some tracking issues

2043
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:34,000
with some games because people were moving so fast. So for example

2044
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:39,000
there they were tracking the movement from people playing Beat Saber

2045
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:44,000
and there was some issues where I guess the lighthouse tracking sensors

2046
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:49,000
were miss interpreting where the position and movement of the players

2047
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:54,000
were and apparently they had to add some sanity checks to prevent

2048
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:59,000
things from going wrong. So like for example one of the things

2049
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:04,000
that they tracked there was a person moving that was a thirty six hundred

2050
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:09,000
degrees per second which is moving your they said the equivalent moving risk

2051
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:14,000
90 degrees and zero point two five seconds. And apparently

2052
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:19,000
they never guessed that people would be moving that quickly. So they had to update

2053
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:24,000
it to Beat Saber kind of reward you for that type of intense move it

2054
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:29,000
because you get more points if you kind of complete the motion or you may or I

2055
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:34,000
guess I think it's more the starting was you make a motion to slice through because if you just sit there

2056
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:39,000
you don't get any funny then their changes they they list they'll increase the limits

2057
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:44,000
of what we thought was humanly possible for controller motion based on tracking

2058
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:49,000
data from Beat Saber experts.

2059
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:54,000
Interesting how that game is really had an impact on the VR scene

2060
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:59,000
but I mean it's a great I mean as far as like music gaming and stuff go it's a great great

2061
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:04,000
I love that game but obviously the experience on PlayStation VR is very different

2062
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:09,000
from this because you know all these mods and the songs that this difficulty level

2063
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:14,000
and stuff don't exist on PlayStation PlayStation is hard enough though in my opinion I can't clear

2064
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:19,000
the advanced stuff I can clear like the mid-level stuff that's about any better tracking controllers

2065
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:24,000
although I've been seeing patents online for new move controllers so maybe those are

2066
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:29,000
coming. Yeah I kind of be curious what they have in store for PlayStation 5 like if

2067
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:34,000
they're going to go further into VR but then obviously you know and I'm

2068
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:39,000
going to buy a whole nother headset. And I'm sure and I'm sure Jamie's not alone in the whole like I don't want VR to

2069
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:43,000
be the future of gaming. I need to hear what you know traditional television displays are going to do as well.

2070
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:48,000
So they have to kind of be thinking about both sides of that you know so it'll be it'll be

2071
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:53,000
interesting to see how this works itself into being integrated into the next

2072
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:58,000
series of PlayStation as opposed to like an add on you know or maybe it will continue to be an add on.

2073
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:03,000
We don't know. We don't know until we start hearing some secrets. So Bobby

2074
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:08,000
Blackwell says don't bundle it with the PlayStation 5. And he says I love VR. I hope Sony

2075
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:13,000
doesn't do the same thing Microsoft did with Kinect. True. I think that's a very fair point because again

2076
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:18,000
I don't think Jamie's alone in the whole I'm not interested in VR. There's and you know it's just like there were a lot of people

2077
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:23,000
that like I'm not interested in Kinect. And so if you were to kind of like force bundle that you're

2078
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:28,000
going to absolutely be like why am I paying this overly inflate price. So that's exactly

2079
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:33,000
probably keep me from buying it. Right. But I think still Sony still got to be thinking

2080
02:23:33,000 --> 02:23:38,000
about OK well I mean just like oh I don't know there's probably a terrible

2081
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:43,000
example but like Nintendo would sell you the base Nintendo but they also had the

2082
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:48,000
version that came with the Zapper and they've got to be thinking about how that would all kind of work together. So it doesn't mean

2083
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:53,000
just because I'm saying I just hope there's backwards compatibility with the old hardware because I can understand like putting

2084
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:58,000
out new hardware that's nice. Oh with VR. Yeah with the VR it's just I don't want to have to buy

2085
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:03,000
like a headset right away and also like for whatever games that they're going to put out for it.

2086
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:08,000
But I'm just saying they don't have to force bundle it. But I'm sure they've got to be thinking about what is the

2087
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:13,000
path of this look like and where is VR going to fit into the entire PlayStation ecosystem and that sort of thing.

2088
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:18,000
And that you know that doesn't necessarily just VR but

2089
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:23,000
could be just move by itself for some things too. And it could get

2090
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:28,000
away from move because move is old as from PlayStation 3. I mean come on.

2091
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:33,000
All right. Anyway let's move on to something we're not going to have any time soon but

2092
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:38,000
this is one that you should file under rumor but it is one of those things that also kind of

2093
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:43,000
adds up and makes sense. So take it for what it is. But it has to do with Mother 3 and we've

2094
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:48,000
been wondering where the hell is this. I don't think it's ever coming. It's a long time. Well this is a Game Informer

2095
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:53,000
senior editor Imran Khan talked about the supposed

2096
02:24:53,000 --> 02:24:58,000
inside story on what's happened with Mother 3. Nintendo was

2097
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:03,000
apparently considering localization of Mother 3 and they were like really they were going to do it

2098
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:08,000
like they were very gung ho about it. But they went back they took a closer look at the game and

2099
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:13,000
they had some question about some controversy about certain

2100
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:18,000
elements of the game. And so they decided not to localize it. I thought this was already out.

2101
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:23,000
Not in America. But I know I did. I meant this

2102
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:28,000
information. I thought this had already been talked about like

2103
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:33,000
right after the game came out came out in Japan. Kind of. I think people have always assumed

2104
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:38,000
that that's part of the reason why it never came over here. But this is more kind of playing into

2105
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:44,000
its confirmation that Nintendo looked into doing it wanted to do it and kind of hit that same

2106
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:49,000
conclusion that probably people were thinking when the game first came out is that there's no way this is

2107
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:54,000
going to fly in America. I already have my fan translation so I'm happy. Right. But it also goes to show that

2108
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:59,000
Nintendo didn't want to edit or censor it and probably they didn't want to spend the money to go back and I

2109
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:04,000
guess for lack of a better term fix it either. So they just decided we're going to leave it

2110
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:09,000
where it is and that's that. So anyway that's sad

2111
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:14,000
though because that's something I would have played. But I guess I

2112
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:19,000
can't. All right. Dark Tetsuya is suggesting you need to go look at our discord

2113
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:24,000
if you haven't already Loki because there's been a lot of talk about backwards compatibility on PlayStation. No I've seen

2114
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:29,000
we talked about that like a while ago like about how they had the different like like

2115
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:34,000
patents for like backwards compatibility and stuff like that. The patent doesn't mean anything.

2116
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:39,000
I mean and I don't want to even think about rumors and speculation about new consoles

2117
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:44,000
right now. So like I'll believe what's

2118
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:49,000
told to me from Sony themselves once we get there. Yeah that's fair.

2119
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:54,000
All right. We are going to make our way to discord. So

2120
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:59,000
we're going to set up in the discord space right now. And if you want to be on the show

2121
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:04,000
tonight all you have to do is join our green room and then we will be taking

2122
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:09,000
calls shortly on discord except. Oh this has not happened before.

2123
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:14,000
I'm having a problem connecting to discord right now. Oh there we go. Who got a little nervous that discord

2124
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:19,000
wouldn't it's like the opposite of Skype. I heard you talking about it. It's like oh I better fix myself. Not like oh you're

2125
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:24,000
talking about me. I'm going to break right. I was getting nervous there a little bit. All right. Anyway

2126
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:29,000
we want to get to some calls here. So if you want to call the show tonight you should make our

2127
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:34,000
way or make your way excuse me to our discord over at vog network

2128
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:39,000
dot com slash discord. And I think we have a very familiar face already in the green

2129
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:44,000
room waiting to go to be on tonight's program. So let's get to our first call tonight.

2130
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:49,000
Hello you're on orange launch radio. Who's this.

2131
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:55,000
Oh hi you're on orange launch radio. Who's this.

2132
02:27:55,000 --> 02:28:00,000
I'm a little concerned because I see do you see on the discord it says one bar with voice

2133
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:05,000
connected. So like we're not don't have a very strong signal and I'm a little worried that maybe we are not going

2134
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:10,000
through where the caller can hear us or perhaps that we can hear them.

2135
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:15,000
So why don't I'm going to try to fix this here real quick. So while I do that Loki do you have any

2136
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:20,000
like last minute stories we get into. Yes apparently the Evo

2137
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:25,000
Japan live stream. We had some apologies that

2138
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:30,000
for the dead or alive six stream being cut off because it was too sexy apparently.

2139
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:35,000
So during the stream they had two Japanese models goofing around between rounds

2140
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:40,000
when the dead or alive six producer and director

2141
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:45,000
Yohei Shimbura was setting up the match and included clips of the girls jiggling

2142
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:50,000
their butts and boobs to mimic the soft body physics and dead or alive six

2143
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:55,000
is surely. Yes. Really after that they had the free camo

2144
02:28:55,000 --> 02:29:00,000
in the game zooming in the girls butts when they were wearing swimsuits. But that's really kind of

2145
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:05,000
the heart of dead or alive 16. All right. We're going to try it again because I see a

2146
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:09,000
green signal there. So hopefully it's going to work this out. You know what he did. I turned it off and then on again.

2147
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:14,000
So let's see if that fixed it. Hi. You're an orange on radio. Who's this. Hey this is Bobby Black Wolf. Hello

2148
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:19,000
Bobby Black Wolf. It's nice to have you here. Hello. Hey sorry I turned off my

2149
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:24,000
twitch stream. So I hope it may have I don't know. We were having it was weird discord

2150
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:29,000
was showing a very weak connection. So I turned it off and then on again and now it's showing green three bars.

2151
02:29:29,000 --> 02:29:34,000
So knock on plastic. Hopefully it will stay connected for us. But you're always great

2152
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:39,000
and having us on your show every week. So I'm always delighted to hear you call in to us

2153
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:44,000
what's on your mind tonight. So I wanted to fill in some of the

2154
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:49,000
blanks about audica by harmonics. Sure.

2155
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:54,000
So the VR game. I know you guys covered it a little bit but you didn't actually talk about

2156
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:59,000
what it was. And the reason they did not make this for controllers

2157
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:04,000
is because you already own this game on controllers. It's a carbon

2158
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:09,000
copy of elite beat agents or rerave or any of those type of games where

2159
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:14,000
you're using fingers like mostly on DS but like arcade games where you're using your fingers

2160
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:19,000
except this time you're actually just pointing and shooting. So it's a game that already

2161
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:24,000
exists and they're adapting it for VR and calling it their own thing.

2162
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:29,000
Yeah. And I know we kind of ended up driving down a different path when we were talking about the

2163
02:30:29,000 --> 02:30:34,000
audica. So for me I'm I love elite beat agents and

2164
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:39,000
I just wish that series would come back truthfully. But I'm curious to see harmonics

2165
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:44,000
take on it. I mean I also understand the concern that harmonics is kind of it. They've kind

2166
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:49,000
of been in a really weird place lately. And I was certainly not a big fan of the

2167
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:54,000
amplitude reboot but you know not every game is going to be a five star winner. So I

2168
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:59,000
will approach with a cautiously optimistic about what this game could hold.

2169
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:04,000
Well my thing about harmonics is that I think they were they're in worse shape now

2170
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:09,000
than they were right before MTV bought them. I think they were left worse off.

2171
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:14,000
And so now they're like a smaller indie studio than they were when they were doing Guitar Hero

2172
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:19,000
and Rock Band. Right. So they really need to you know they need to take some of these

2173
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:24,000
risks like this because nobody really cares about them anymore and they're not

2174
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:29,000
the big triple A developer that they used to be. That's true. Although I didn't

2175
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:34,000
I mean honestly I didn't mind a lot of their triple A stuff. I don't think that. But I mean you know

2176
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:39,000
I think in general with the rise and fall of Guitar Hero S type of games you know obviously

2177
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:44,000
harmonics kind of got sucked into that whether they deserved it or not

2178
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:49,000
with that whole thing. But you know they have that what was that game. They were testing

2179
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:54,000
that one game that was like a fighting game and then they decided to abandon

2180
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:59,000
it. And I was I was I was kind of sad to hear that because I thought it was pretty cool idea there. But I guess

2181
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:04,000
they felt it wasn't fun at the end of the day or what have you. And these things happen. Yeah. I think that was

2182
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:09,000
Chroma. Yeah. That's right. Chroma. That was it. That was the name of it. And

2183
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:14,000
Chad Leland's in our chat mentioning drop mix which that is

2184
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:19,000
now that is really cool. But that's not a video game. But it's obviously heavily inspired

2185
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:24,000
by that. But as like a board game and the whole integration with phones everything drop mixes

2186
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:29,000
is really brilliant. Honestly it's a brilliant game. Yeah. And I actually have some of those

2187
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:34,000
exclusive cards from Pax. So no listener sent them to me when you wanted him to. And I'm

2188
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:39,000
like I got him. Well it was never for me. It was for our

2189
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:44,000
collector friend Shane over there in chat. I think I ended up getting

2190
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:49,000
think he ended up getting a one way or another. OK. Yeah. But yeah. No I just wanted

2191
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:54,000
to fill in the blanks on that. You know that's why it's in VR and I am someone who likes VR.

2192
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:59,000
And I'm going to say something controversial here. You know me my controversial

2193
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:04,000
opinions. Sure. Is that I am of the belief that not

2194
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:09,000
every game needs to be playable by every person in the world. And so I understand

2195
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:14,000
that there are some people like you know somebody made the thing amputees can't play DDR even though yes

2196
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:19,000
on the console version you can play button button revolution on the controller. But like I do

2197
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:24,000
love the blind community that we have here at VOG and I respect them.

2198
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:29,000
But even I don't think I think they would even say not every game needs to be made to be

2199
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:34,000
playable by someone who's blind. So I respect that there are people that have

2200
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:39,000
different advantages and disadvantages to playing. But I don't think that every single

2201
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:44,000
game needs to cater to everybody because then we'd only have one or two types of games.

2202
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:51,000
Let me give a tiny needle back though on that. OK. Because because it's not it's not that I disagree

2203
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:56,000
because obviously you know like it's kind of like you've mentioned with like the DDR and everything

2204
02:33:56,000 --> 02:34:01,000
is that like you know there's you want to try to open your game to as many people as possible.

2205
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:06,000
I think certainly. But sometimes just due to the delivery mechanism that just may not be

2206
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:11,000
possible or what have you. I think we need games made only for autistic people and not N.T. people.

2207
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:16,000
Cool. If we're going to be excluded from everybody else's games why shouldn't other people be excluded from our

2208
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:21,000
game. That same logic should be fair. It wouldn't be all that. But I would support

2209
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:26,000
that honestly. But I don't think autistic folks or any of the other things we've

2210
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:31,000
named are excluded from everything. I was using the same logic. Sure.

2211
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:36,000
But the other thing I want to kneel back on was what about like difficulty

2212
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:41,000
because I know we've had a lot of like jokes and things about how you don't like

2213
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:46,000
to play games that are difficult because and so we talk about how well

2214
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:51,000
when there's a Bobby Black Wolf mode in the game that makes the game more accessible because now it's something that like

2215
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:56,000
I feel like I can play and I can like I can do isn't that kind of an accessibility thing too.

2216
02:34:57,000 --> 02:35:02,000
And I am totally fine with me being excluded from the souls genre.

2217
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:07,000
OK. Yeah. And to be fair I don't really care for the souls games.

2218
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:12,000
Yeah. But I mean I am totally fine with there being a challenge for people that want that challenge.

2219
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:17,000
I don't want to take that away from them. Right. And you know that's that is a principle like let's

2220
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:22,000
take the souls series. You know that series is predicated on

2221
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:27,000
it being overly difficult. And if you make it accessible to me you

2222
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:32,000
destroy what makes those games the souls games. Whereas I understand like I know the later Mega Man

2223
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:37,000
said it the easier modes and stuff but that doesn't necessarily destroy inherently what Mega Man is

2224
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:42,000
where the souls games were built around. This is difficult and I'm OK but that's not for

2225
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:47,000
me. I think at the end of the day you know in the games industry and especially

2226
02:35:47,000 --> 02:35:52,000
in the case of like a triple A studio you're going to live and die by your sales. And if you exclude a certain

2227
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:57,000
segment no matter what how you're excluding or what it is whether it's difficulty whether it's disability

2228
02:35:57,000 --> 02:36:02,000
if you exclude a certain segment then you're going to affect your sales. But depending

2229
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:07,000
on what kind of studio you are if you're like an indie studio and maybe you do want

2230
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:12,000
to make a game that only a very specific set of individuals are going to be able to play

2231
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:17,000
then that's that's awesome that's cool and you know everybody should support the ability of that to exist.

2232
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:22,000
But it is going to impact sales and you kind of just have to know like I'm not going to sell 11 billion copies

2233
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:27,000
of this game because I'm going against or I'm going only for this one little market if that makes sense.

2234
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:32,000
Well and that's what Bungie wants to do with Destiny 2. They want to make it more accessible to the hardcore

2235
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:37,000
Activision reportedly wanted to sell a billion copies. And so that's why

2236
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:42,000
there was the disconnect there and Bungie is like we'd rather sell less and deliver an experience for the hardcore

2237
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:47,000
that Activision wouldn't let us do. Interesting

2238
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:52,000
way to bring it full circle how this is kind of impacting many corners of the industry

2239
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:57,000
for sure. So I think I'll leave the discussion at that. But Bobby anything else you want to talk about or anything you want to

2240
02:36:57,000 --> 02:37:02,000
plug while you're here. Well I am on the voice of geeks network twitch channel right before

2241
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:07,000
OLR. So come an hour early and hang out with me in the pre-show for OLR.

2242
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:12,000
I always do. Sometimes I'm distracted by the smell of food

2243
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:17,000
getting brought into the house or what have you. But yeah I always try to

2244
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:22,000
catch the Bobby Black Wolf show when I can. All right. All right. Take care Bobby.

2245
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:27,000
Thanks for calling. See ya. All right. So if you

2246
02:37:27,000 --> 02:37:32,000
want to call on the show tonight our green room is currently empty but you can join the green room over on Discord and

2247
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:37,000
we will try to bring in some more calls. Some interesting comments in our chat room.

2248
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:42,000
VG realness in chat says another good example of quote not for everyone is Dream Daddy.

2249
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:47,000
That's for a specific market. If they made it for everyone the game wouldn't be the same. Interesting because it's

2250
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:52,000
almost like you kind of flip that. And sometimes where you know I get I

2251
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:57,000
feel left out sometimes as a LGBT plus plus community member is that in some

2252
02:37:57,000 --> 02:38:02,000
games you know when you have a create your own character and you can do whatever

2253
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:07,000
you want but you can't do this thing romantically. That is me. You feel

2254
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:12,000
like I don't I mean I can play the game but can I really enjoy can I

2255
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:17,000
connect with the game the same way somebody else can. Maybe not. So that's why you hear a lot of

2256
02:38:17,000 --> 02:38:22,000
social justice people. I'm using my big quotey fingers for those in the podcast complaining

2257
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:27,000
about that sometimes because you know that's representation. It's important. And that's

2258
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:32,000
in all sorts of things. Anyway let's see.

2259
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:39,000
Kajuda says I always say if everyone has a hammer you can't build a house. Everyone has to have different tools.

2260
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:44,000
Questbuster says not a huge fan of permadeath RPGs but not going to argue that other people can't have them.

2261
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:49,000
All right. Let's move on to any other last minute stories we might have tonight

2262
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:54,000
from either dark soccer or Loki really cracked down sales are down. So correct down three

2263
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:59,000
they're saying that way down only about 10 percent of crack down to sales.

2264
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:05,000
That's not good. They said the launch week it's

2265
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:10,000
sold only 4000 units in the UK. Is that 10 percent of lifetime

2266
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:15,000
sales or is it 10 percent of the same week one figures. I think it may be week one.

2267
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:20,000
I don't know. But they I don't I don't know if that's even

2268
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:25,000
accurate. I don't know if the game sold as well but I think

2269
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:30,000
it price it's going to sell OK. I think you also have to consider and Jamie are you trying to get

2270
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:35,000
a comment on this or another story. OK. The the other thing to consider

2271
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:40,000
is that Microsoft is also selling this game pass thing which is very important to them and

2272
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:45,000
what they want to do. And right people that are getting this game on that game pass are not going to be counted in this.

2273
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:50,000
And I do think you need to consider some of those things to you meaning the Internet not you Loki

2274
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:55,000
but you know armchair critics on forums and this need to consider there are more ways that games get

2275
02:39:55,000 --> 02:40:00,000
delivered than just what it used to be too. Well there's other games coming out too this week as well.

2276
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:05,000
Metro Exodus came out the same day for the new Far Cry

2277
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:10,000
game. I don't know. I don't think it's such a big deal. We'll see whatever. I mean

2278
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:15,000
it's cracked down. What do you expect. It's not like you know it's just cracked down every

2279
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:20,000
crackdown game is exactly the same. Yeah we're not we're not breaking the mold or anything.

2280
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:25,000
It's just cracked down. Any other last minute

2281
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:30,000
stories. Jamie Loki. Anybody. All right. Well our green room is pretty

2282
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:35,000
quiet. So I think that might be someone call.

2283
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:40,000
Do it. Some weeks are crazier. Is there something on TV tonight. I am here. Why are you not

2284
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:45,000
talking to me. I'll talk to you. What do you want to talk about stuff.

2285
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:50,000
I probably want caffeine. You want caffeine. Yeah I'm probably going to get a soda.

2286
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:55,000
The coffee from earlier wasn't enough. It was a decaf.

2287
02:40:55,000 --> 02:41:00,000
Because I'm not supposed to have caffeine. But you know what. I love caffeine. Yeah.

2288
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:05,000
Same thing my doctor told me I was supposed to stop drinking coffee and I was like so that's not going to happen. So we need to negotiate.

2289
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:10,000
She kind of laughed and was like all right. Well also just to

2290
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:15,000
point out we got another green room but go ahead. Well just a point of education if you are prone

2291
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:20,000
to kidney stones don't drink fucking airborne vitamin C will lead to

2292
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:25,000
a buildup in your kidneys that leads to guess what. Kidney stones. Is that specific

2293
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:30,000
to airborne or like vitamin C supplements to vitamin C supplements as well. Because after my surgery

2294
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:35,000
I was told basically I can only take vitamin C in very limited doses.

2295
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:40,000
Interesting because they will make you it will make you more prone to kidney stones because it leads to deposits.

2296
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:45,000
But those are yeah those yeah those like airborne in the emergency and that stuff is just like it's just like

2297
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:50,000
flacking your body with a ton of vitamin C. And second of all there's absolutely no science behind it doing any

2298
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:55,000
good it's all conjecture. All right. Let's get to another call here on the show. Hello you're on

2299
02:41:55,000 --> 02:42:00,000
orange on radio. Who's this. Hey it's Ron. How is everybody tonight.

2300
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:05,000
Fabulous. How are you. Why are you not sharing any Okonomiyaki with me.

2301
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:10,000
I tagged you as the best I could do. Yeah but that just means you need to send me a ticket

2302
02:42:10,000 --> 02:42:15,000
so I can go out there and eat Okonomiyaki. Oh well I think that may happen

2303
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:20,000
I'm saying given the news I told you anything could be plausible. You

2304
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:25,000
know like for three years in a row I've been talking about this is the year I'm going to have to come to New York City

2305
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:30,000
but seriously seriously now that they're putting jagged little pill on Broadway this

2306
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:34,000
fall like I that that might be the thing that finally

2307
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:38,000
I'm waiting for Beetlejuice. Oh are they doing a musical out of Beetlejuice?

2308
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:43,000
Beetlejuice musical. That's going to be a lot of fun. I'm still waiting for the second movie. I thought they weren't going to do the second movie now.

2309
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:48,000
No I think they are. Of course I'm waiting for Bill into three as well. Oh yes.

2310
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:53,000
Yes yes. Anyway although Alex Winter does not look any different and Keanu Reeves never ages.

2311
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:58,000
All right. I'm sure Rama didn't call in to talk about Broadway tonight. Well maybe it's because Keanu Reeves is a vampire

2312
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:03,000
and he turned Alex Winter. So you know what would you like to talk about tonight Rama. Well I was going to

2313
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:07,000
say you know you know the Beetlejuice musical is not us but we do have

2314
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:12,000
Beetle House. It's an amazing restaurant. So if you do come out here you got to bring Jamie

2315
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:17,000
you got to bring Loki. You got to bring the squad out here. All right.

2316
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:23,000
As soon as we have time and money done. Oh and a sitter for Loki's kids.

2317
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:29,000
And a sitter for my cat and Jamie's too. Dan can watch Midna. That's true.

2318
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:35,000
Alan can watch Smush. He doesn't need to go right. Nobody's going to watch my cat. She's going to die.

2319
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:41,000
All right. Anyway OK. All right. So you should know you should tell your kids that if they watch

2320
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:46,000
your cat perfectly you'll take him back to the broccoli farm. But this time you actually take him to a broccoli farm.

2321
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:51,000
All right. What is actually on your mind tonight Rama.

2322
02:43:56,000 --> 02:44:01,000
We talked about games and games and so forth but there's some gaming accessories we haven't really touched on.

2323
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:06,000
So I want to talk about this new amazing gaming chair that I went out and bought

2324
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:11,000
and this thing is amazing. I saw your chair. Yeah. All right.

2325
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:16,000
All right. So this is an unpaid promotional spot. No I'm kidding. What was the chair. Tell me about it.

2326
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:21,000
I didn't I didn't see this. Well a couple of years back going through cheap

2327
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:26,000
40 50 dollar chairs you had to relax and I'm like I need something you know

2328
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:31,000
for my back something better. So I was looking more on a budget. So I got like this decent

2329
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:36,000
chair by third party knockoff company whatever I paid

2330
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:41,000
maybe about 150 shipping. It was nice for a couple of years until the gas cylinder started to sink.

2331
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:46,000
So what about these gaming chairs. They say that it is rated for a certain weight

2332
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:51,000
but it's like well you know long story short I can't

2333
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:56,000
replace like the cylinder and the parts on it. So last Thursday night I'm going through different game sites

2334
02:44:56,000 --> 02:45:01,000
for gaming chairs like DX Racer Alpine opposite

2335
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:06,000
Secret Lab and a bunch of others. So I decided you know looking at my budget

2336
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:11,000
I dropped maybe about a little bit over 200 for this chair by

2337
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:16,000
OPC comes within a day and it takes me like a half hour to assemble it and it's just

2338
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:21,000
comfy as all hell. What makes it a

2339
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:26,000
gaming chair like racing chairs. Yeah.

2340
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:32,000
Like bucket seat style sitting you know it's

2341
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:37,000
sitting in a race car more or less. Well sometimes like a gaming chair as I've seen

2342
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:42,000
sold is like this like overlay you put on your regular chair that's just there to vibrate your ass.

2343
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:47,000
That is what like I've seen those gaming chairs. It's vibration for your ass. No it does.

2344
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:52,000
You need to see the chairs they do for racing rigs that have full on

2345
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:57,000
hydraulics built into it. Well I've seen some of the stuff your husband built. Yeah. Yeah.

2346
02:45:57,000 --> 02:46:02,000
I want a hydraulic chair for playing Star Blade.

2347
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:08,000
That sounds that's the area you know and you don't I mean you

2348
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:13,000
you've joked before that you I mean you live in New York City so you obviously don't live in a gigantic

2349
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:18,000
space. So this is something that's kind of you're able to fit it in a smaller

2350
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:23,000
space even. Yes and I'll say it once I say it again my

2351
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:28,000
studio which is smaller than studio it's an efficiency it's probably about the

2352
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:33,000
size of the studio you're doing the show from. Which would be like the family room

2353
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:38,000
in a house. Yeah I mean I have a

2354
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:43,000
galley kitchen what more does that tell you. But on the plus side directly to my left is the fridge

2355
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:48,000
and right behind me is the microwave toaster of it and the coffee maker. So it's like one

2356
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:53,000
stop shopping. I get it though. I get it though. I mean that's that's big city living. I mean a lot of my friends in San

2357
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:58,000
Francisco in a similar thing. So basically. Yeah.

2358
02:46:58,000 --> 02:47:03,000
All right. Well Rama thank you for the call. Thank you for talking about a topic we don't always talk about

2359
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:08,000
but the accessories to the games and not just the games themselves but the things that

2360
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:13,000
power them and make them more and more entertaining and vibrates your ass. All right.

2361
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:18,000
Well I can get something separate for that but I will say this. I'll say this when it comes to various

2362
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:23,000
accessories. I mean I understand a lot of people were on budget. You don't want to spend

2363
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:28,000
too much money. I mean yeah I spent 150 on this chair that started to fall

2364
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:33,000
apart after a couple of years. Mind you the book like a third of the cost was shipping.

2365
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:39,000
I paid honestly two hundred and twenty nine for this chair and I got next day shipping because of how

2366
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:44,000
close the warehouse is. But I've been getting nothing but great support through the people for any issues

2367
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:49,000
and it's very simple to put together. There are some things you really shouldn't skimp out

2368
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:54,000
on because it lasts you a lot better in the long run. I get that there are some chairs are like

2369
02:47:54,000 --> 02:47:59,000
three four five hundred dollars. They come with five 10 year limited lifetime warranties.

2370
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:04,000
I'm just saying if you're going to invest in something I'd say

2371
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:09,000
if you look at it like the cheapest go up a couple of notches and go from there. You want to invest

2372
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:14,000
in something pretty well. And I have to say there is a major difference between the prior

2373
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:19,000
chair that I had for a couple of years and the current one that I need. So

2374
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:24,000
my back has never felt any better. Loki found a picture of the chair for me so I'm able to look at it.

2375
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:29,000
And for the podcast folks it kind of it has like definitely like two big like they look like a lumbar

2376
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:34,000
cushions in the head for like your back and your typical like you

2377
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:39,000
almost like a DX researcher. Yeah. But that does look comfy. So if I come to New York

2378
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:44,000
I'm going to come sit in your chair. Absolutely. You can you can enjoy the throne.

2379
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:49,000
I will get you the Bugs Bunny throne everything. You can sit there and be like

2380
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:54,000
when people say who the hell you think I am you just look at them like I know who I am. Who is you?

2381
02:48:54,000 --> 02:48:59,000
Sounds like a plan. Rama pleasure to have you here as always. You take care, buddy.

2382
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:04,000
Always. You take care, bro. And you all stay awesome. All right. You too. Bye.

2383
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:09,000
Bye. All right. Always a pleasure to hear from Rama. I think, though, with that, we will start to

2384
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:14,000
wrap up. So I'm sorry to those that didn't get through tonight, although there was nobody else in the green room at that time.

2385
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:19,000
So I don't think anybody else tried. But if you do want to think of something after the fact, you can always send us an e-mail.

2386
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:24,000
Participate at OrangeLaundrio.com or you can always tweet us at Twitter dot com slash o l r. There's lots

02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:29,000

2388

2389
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:39,000

2390

hearing us. So, yeah, tell a friend. Leave a nice five star review on a site like

2391
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:49,000
iTunes. That goes a long way as well. We also really appreciate all the followers and the hosts over at

2392
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:54,000
Twitch TV slash VOG Network. And of course, the biddies and subscriptions are great, too, although we never want to

2393
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:59,000
beg for your money. I will say it does go to videos. So I appreciate that as well.

2394
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:04,000
With all that, I think we're ready to go around to get final thoughts. So I'll start with you tonight,

2395
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:09,000
Loki. What's your final thought as we bring things to a close here in the studio?

2396
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:14,000
My final thought is I would like to stream more this week. It's just I have to cook several days now.

2397
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:19,000
I've got barbecue chicken wings and make in my wife wants to make her

2398
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:24,000
matzo ball soup. And that's good, though. And some other

2399
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:29,000
stuff, I'm sure always something comes up. But I'll try to stream some

2400
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:34,000
more this week, maybe more crackdown three and Skyrim eventually.

2401
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:40,000
Then I realize all this is taken away from game development time. That should probably be doing since you guys all keep bugging me about game development.

2402
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:45,000
So I tried doing that at my son's

2403
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:50,000
coding class thing, but it is packed in like it was pretty uncomfortable just to work on

2404
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:55,000
with where I was sitting. So I just kind of because the sun was like coming

2405
02:50:55,000 --> 02:51:00,000
in through the window, blinding me. So I just kind of gave up on that. But we'll see.

2406
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:05,000
My final thought and then we'll get to Jamie. My final thought tonight is I've

2407
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:10,000
had a very busy weekend. So I've had a show Friday, a show Saturday, a show tonight. So I'm ready

2408
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:15,000
for a day off tomorrow. So hooray for a three day weekend. And I've also been very

2409
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:20,000
bad at the streaming thing on my personal channel lately. So maybe that's something I'll try to do tomorrow. We'll see.

2410
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:25,000
Stay tuned to Twitter is a good place to follow me over at Mr. Rob Roberts on Twitter.

2411
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:30,000
Last but certainly not least, dark soccer. Fantastic to have you here in the studio tonight. Always appreciate

2412
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:35,000
you being here and your perspectives and all that good stuff. Can't wait to have you back full time. I'm looking forward to it. And that's only what,

2413
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:40,000
like two weeks, right? Or a week after next. So that's great. So really, you just have next week

2414
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:45,000
off and then you're back for half. Well, sorry. Off this. Sorry. But yes,

2415
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:50,000
I am tireder than a white suburbanite mom of three

2416
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:55,000
with her glass of Franzia. Tip it.

2417
02:51:55,000 --> 02:52:00,000
Right now. And I am still planning on doing Jamie Cheats to win.

2418
02:52:00,000 --> 02:52:05,000
I need to find the Eddie Guerrero theme song for this. And I also have to

2419
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:10,000
clean off the floor in my office so I can use the TV in there. But Jamie

2420
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:15,000
Cheats to win is going to be a thing. I'm also deciding if I want to do Legend of Zelda Link to the Past

2421
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:20,000
or if I want to do like debug Sonic. Why not both?

2422
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:25,000
Because I want to do something that's going to be fun first. Do them all. All the things.

2423
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:30,000
Stream all the games. All right. Maybe. All right. That's it. We're on out of here for tonight. We will

2424
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:35,000
see you in seven days. At least Loki and I'll be here then for whatever happens in gaming news next week.

2425
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:40,000
It was pretty busy this week. So we'll see what happens next week. Lots more stuff to talk about, I'm sure. Until then,

2426
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:45,000
happy gaming, everybody. We'll see you next time here on Orange Lounge Radio. Good night.
