00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,080
This week, rumors swirl about Microsoft discussing a means for its titles to become available

2
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,180
on the Nintendo Switch.

3
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,180
This announcer would love more games available in a highly portable means.

4
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,560
This is just one mixy rumor, stay tuned for the rest of the week's gaming news starting

5
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:32,560
right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,920
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,880
where every gamer has a voice.

8
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:44,800
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 765 for this February 24th

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,580
of 2019.

10
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,120
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me as always is the one and only Techmaster Loki.

11
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,120
Hello.

12
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,120
Hi, how are you?

13
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,120
I'm good.

14
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,880
We had five technical hiccups in the beginning but I think we got it all worked out.

15
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,880
Yes.

16
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,880
Do you know what I had to do to fix the issue?

17
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,280
Turn it off and turn it back on.

18
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,040
I had to turn it off and then turn it back on again and I fixed it.

19
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,040
Alright.

20
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,800
It's like magic, go figure.

21
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,320
Tech support 101.

22
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,960
Not joining us tonight in studio, DarkSakura or Jamie Summers, but this is the last week

23
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,640
of her work thing that has kept her off the air for several months.

24
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,680
Of course we'll hear from her at the classic game of the week as we have been over the

25
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,440
past few months, but she will be back in studio full time next week.

26
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,440
So that's pretty exciting.

27
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,680
I know we had her last week, but you know, she's like, that was a special thing.

28
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,280
So, um, but joining us tonight in studio is Mr. Smoosh and you might hear him in the background

29
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,760
meowing cause I don't know what he's going.

30
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,840
He was probably coming up through my sandwich cause I have half of it sitting on the couch

31
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,840
right here.

32
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,600
Oh, so he's like smelling the turkey or chicken or whatever's in your sandwich that you got.

33
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,600
Yes.

34
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,600
I see.

35
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,600
All right.

36
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,600
That explains a lot.

37
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,800
He does kind of go crazy when he smells food because he thinks it's like feeding time.

38
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,260
Just like me, just like dad.

39
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,260
So there you go.

40
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,620
We of course are live on the interwebs as we always are every Sunday night at six o'clock

41
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:00,220
Pacific nine o'clock Eastern at the voice of geeks network vog network.com.

42
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:05,700
We are on Twitch TV, the easiest way to find us Twitch TV slash vog network.

43
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,300
Hello to everybody that's out there in our chat room over at Twitch TV and some folks

44
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:16,100
talking a little bit about, uh, the, um, uh, intro that we did with the, we had a little

45
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:20,180
joke, a star where you was born because there's obviously the Oscars are going on tonight,

46
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,620
which I mean, I just, I don't really care about the Oscars.

47
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:27,420
We've been doing this show for so long and not to be like that hipster.

48
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:32,120
That's like, well, I don't care because my stuff is more important, but I mean, to me,

49
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,540
this is more important and it's just, eh, you know, I don't know.

50
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:41,040
It's like, it's an award show, whatever, like whether Gaga wins the Oscar or not, it's not

51
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,540
going to change what kind of an artist she is and all this stuff.

52
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:49,020
So I just kinda, I do understand that that the Oscars can bring like visibility maybe.

53
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:52,160
And that's what it really used to be is that it really brought visibility to films that

54
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,540
maybe otherwise people wouldn't see.

55
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,740
But I feel like in this day and age and all the campaigns going behind it and all the,

56
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:02,140
all the lead up with the hype and the 24 hours, seven internet news coverage, it's kinda,

57
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,340
it's kind of a whatever.

58
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,900
So yes, yet we all want gaming to have an award ceremony.

59
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,100
I can tie it to gaming.

60
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,400
We all want gaming to have an award ceremony.

61
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,020
They have so many game trailers during the word ceremony.

62
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:16,980
See if like they had like movie trailer debuts, Oh, make it like the MTV movie awards, but

63
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:17,980
yeah.

64
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:18,980
Okay.

65
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,700
So that's more, who cares with the Oscars?

66
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,420
You should, you know, the Oscars have been having problems.

67
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,060
They don't even have a host this year.

68
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,060
They got so many problems.

69
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,020
No one called me.

70
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:30,340
I was sitting here waiting and it's like, my phone's not ringing.

71
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:35,020
I guess I'm not hosting the Oscars this year, unfortunately.

72
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,020
So here I am.

73
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,380
We'll be waiting here waiting for your call.

74
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,460
I mean, they were scraping the bottom of the barrel to try to find people to do it.

75
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,940
I'm telling you, I'm at the bottom of that barrel.

76
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,740
So did you hear like the conspiracy theory that Whoopi Goldberg secretly was off the

77
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:53,060
view because she was prepping to host the Oscars cause she'd done it before.

78
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,220
So of course, you know, who better to host than somebody that hosted before, but no,

79
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,220
she just had pneumonia.

80
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,340
People made up that rumor.

81
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,340
It's funny.

82
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:05,500
Uh, in our chat over at Twitch TV, uh, slash vog network, uh, quest buster says, I'll see

83
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,140
the winners list tomorrow morning.

84
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,140
That's kind of where I'm at.

85
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,140
That's where I'm at.

86
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:13,860
Uh, Bobby Blackwell says, unfortunately the game trailers pay for the game awards.

87
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,620
That's why they have to cram in the awards.

88
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:19,420
That is a true statement though, is that, you know, they're commercials.

89
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,420
Those game trailers are commercials.

90
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,860
I don't care why they're there.

91
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,060
I just like that they're there.

92
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,860
I mean, it makes sense.

93
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,860
I don't care.

94
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,860
It's, it's fine.

95
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,860
All right.

96
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,220
Well let's, I guess, I guess movies are on everybody's mind, so it's appropriate that

97
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,460
our kickoff topic tonight has a little bit to do with movies, right?

98
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,460
Yes.

99
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,940
It has to do with movies that were on steam cause they had that.

100
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:43,220
I think the only movie they had on steam was indie game, the movie from humble bundle.

101
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,920
You're actually really, really wrong.

102
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,780
And this is the perfect reason why there are no longer movies on steam.

103
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:54,260
I think indie game, the movie was like the first one because they kind of released it

104
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:59,420
like it was a game and they had, well, no, I said the only game, only movie I had was

105
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:03,340
indie game, the movie totally, you know, okay, sorry.

106
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,500
Throw me under the bus there.

107
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,500
It's fine.

108
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,500
No.

109
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,780
The only movie that I had on steam, I think it was indie game, the movie under the Pikachu.

110
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,780
That's all I got.

111
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,980
Um, but no, they did have more movies on there.

112
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,660
It's just not a lot of people really remembered that they had them on there.

113
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,660
And plus there's like a lot of different other video platforms.

114
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:25,760
So I don't, I think if they did more like humble movie bundles or something like that,

115
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:32,440
they might've, you know, brought more, um, exposure to it, but it didn't seem like that

116
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,260
a lot of people knew about it or cared about it.

117
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,260
And so now it's going away.

118
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,140
Well, and I also like when were movies ever featured on the front page of steam?

119
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,140
Like I've never seen movies.

120
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:45,100
And is it because they switched more to that algorithm where it's kind of like, like everybody

121
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,700
has a custom store based on the content you buy.

122
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:52,060
So if you're not buying movies, you never see movies, but like, hello, how am I going

123
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,180
to know about movies if they're not there?

124
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,860
Plus they, they weren't exactly cheap either, right?

125
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,300
Like maybe if they had like a 99 cent movie once in a while, people might be more into

126
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,300
it.

127
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,300
Or maybe a movie rental thing.

128
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,300
I mean, I don't know.

129
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:08,140
I'm looking right now cause like my library, I've got my library of stuff and so I don't

130
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:16,460
even know where this would be cause there's games, software, VR and music.

131
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,340
I don't see movies.

132
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,740
So is that under software?

133
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,100
Nope.

134
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,660
So is it under music?

135
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,660
Nope.

136
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,860
So it really, so you, you're saying that it really feels like the movies is like just

137
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:33,200
super like kind of like tacked on under a rock.

138
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,840
You have to kind of know where to go to get it.

139
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,040
Kind of like what Xbox indie games turned into.

140
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:43,440
Like I don't even know where I would go in steam to watch that movie they have.

141
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,540
Well, indie game shows up as a game.

142
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:50,920
I know cause I have that same movie because I think I got that indie game, the movie in

143
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,320
one of those things you're talking about, like a humble pack or something.

144
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:58,280
So it's in the store in like, as just like a game, but that was a very special thing.

145
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,160
Not all movies kind of like worked like that.

146
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,160
Yeah.

147
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,800
Well, it's gone or it's going to be gone soon.

148
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,800
So hope you didn't get attached to it.

149
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,800
Yeah.

150
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,480
Oh, what do you, I mean, I guess this kind of leads it to a bigger question about how

151
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:18,760
important is the integration of movies and all this stuff into your service?

152
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:22,640
Because I mean, I think about like my PlayStation four, like, especially because it's in the

153
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,840
living room, it's kind of like my, my device that's in there.

154
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,100
Uh, I do a lot of Twitch TV on it and I really wish the Twitch TV app had like the same,

155
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,820
I wish it was on par with the PC, PC desktop version.

156
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:38,420
Like you can't search by tags on the PS four version.

157
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,420
I do that a lot.

158
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,580
So there's little things that I would like to still see improved and have like the parody

159
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,580
with desktop, but whatever.

160
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:49,100
Um, but I do a lot of like Netflix, in fact, Sony in particular really has a nice little

161
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,020
like one stop thing.

162
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:54,660
Like when you go into the TV and movies, it kind of shows like all these movies and it

163
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,940
shows like what platforms they're all on.

164
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:57,940
Yeah.

165
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,940
This was on Amazon prime.

166
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:59,940
This was on Hulu.

167
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:04,740
And you kind of know like where to go and I think you can actually search for anything

168
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,660
and it'll show you what service it's in, which is brilliant.

169
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:12,660
A lot of different, I know like Google TV does or Android TV does the same thing.

170
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,740
Um, you can search by that stuff.

171
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,740
Roku.

172
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,580
I think my Roku TV does that.

173
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,920
Um, maybe, I don't know.

174
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,620
I just remember my old one does and it has like voice chat, which never really worked

175
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,900
correctly, but, um, yeah, I mean, I don't tend to buy.

176
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:35,740
Movies digitally, which is because we have all these services that kind of keep coming

177
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,660
and going away.

178
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:42,780
Um, I've looked at a few, like during the sales and stuff and they have on the PlayStation

179
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,340
store, like they'll have movies for sale sometimes.

180
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,340
And they're still always too expensive.

181
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,700
It's like 10 bucks for a movie.

182
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:52,380
I'm like, eh, I'll just buy the physical movie if I'm going to do that.

183
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,900
So that's why we turned to the old piracy.

184
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,820
Well, I don't, I don't pirate movies, but I think you're right about the subscription

185
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:00,820
service.

186
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,140
I don't remember the last time I bought a movie.

187
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,940
Like it's been a long time.

188
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:09,780
I know I bought Tron, uh, legacy on Blu-ray, but that was how many years ago?

189
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,940
Like that was 2010.

190
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,940
Was that movie?

191
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,940
Well, yeah.

192
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:16,420
And also my, I honestly don't remember the last time I bought a Blu-ray and lots of fun.

193
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:22,340
I'm acquiring is just, you know, for my wife or my kids to watch and then they'll watch

194
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:25,020
it and get bored of it, but it's all for me.

195
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:30,860
It's all subscription service, which is interesting because that's where music went, right?

196
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:35,220
Music was, um, you know, you used to, it was like, it was all about going to for me when

197
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,220
I was younger.

198
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,220
Here I go.

199
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,220
I'm going to date myself.

200
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,220
Y'all ready?

201
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:44,700
I used to go to the warehouse or tower records as back when tower records knew me back at

202
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,700
the warehouse.

203
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:53,140
Um, I remember I actually received a gift certificate, not a gift card, a gift certificate,

204
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:57,940
like a written out piece of paper that you would take in to redeem for money.

205
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:58,940
Yeah.

206
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:03,540
Um, so I would go get the new, like the guy at tower records knew me.

207
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:08,580
Like it was like, Oh, he's the one that will want the import Bjork single that came in

208
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:13,060
with the, with the rare remix of hyper ballad or whatever it is like he knew they knew me

209
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,060
there.

210
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:18,780
But, um, but yeah, I used to like buy all that stuff and then Napster came out and like

211
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,260
I would still buy CDs.

212
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,700
I didn't like to pirate things, you know, all the time.

213
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:29,060
I would still buy CDs for the artists I support, but for those like ultra rare remixes that

214
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:34,200
was like a Europe only CD type of thing, you got to pay $12 because I would, it's only

215
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,200
on the vinyl.

216
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,420
I would, I would download those on Napster because you know, like I'm not like, you know,

217
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,340
it was a ridiculous amount we were paying.

218
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,340
Right.

219
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,900
So I kind of justified it with that.

220
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,580
Um, but, but then iTunes came out and that really changed everything.

221
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,740
It made everything like a worldwide market.

222
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:54,460
Like there was no import stuff, hardly any more, maybe in the very, very beginning.

223
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:58,580
But now, you know, there's so much you can download like worldwide and through Apple

224
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:02,420
music through Spotify, you know, we just had a story about Capcom soundtracks all being

225
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,420
on Spotify last week.

226
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:08,100
Like, you know, subscription services, where it at, where it's at now movies to do in this

227
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,580
very similar thing, right?

228
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:13,020
Like I don't really buy movies ever.

229
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:17,100
I can't tell you, like, I have a very impressive collection of DVDs from when I lived with

230
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,100
you and you worked for the movie distributor and you're always like, Oh, this is like

231
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,100
a gay film.

232
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,100
Rob would like this.

233
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,780
You get the, I didn't always do that.

234
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,780
Just no, it was just that.

235
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,380
But like, Oh, Oh, you knew this stuff.

236
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:30,460
I like to like, Oh, strangers with candy, the movie Rob was like obsessed with that

237
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,460
show.

238
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,500
I'll pull that, which I deeply appreciate to this day.

239
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,580
However, the reality is like, how often do I really pop in those discs?

240
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:40,660
I just don't because now it's more about, I want to watch something.

241
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,220
Let's go to Netflix.

242
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,220
Right.

243
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,220
Yeah.

244
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:48,500
For anybody that listens to shaking and crying, cheap plug, cause that just came back.

245
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:53,160
Uh, Victoria told me that I had to let my homework assignment was to watch abducted

246
00:11:53,160 --> 00:12:01,260
in plain sight, which yes, which wow, wow is all I have to say, wow.

247
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,260
That's all I have to say about that.

248
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:06,280
My wife watched that and she wanted me to watch it, but I was like, no, Victoria told

249
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:10,160
me it was like the beginning about like, yeah, and the parents didn't call for five days.

250
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,160
Like it'll blow your mind.

251
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,160
I'm like, why wouldn't they do it?

252
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:17,320
You just have to watch the movie and I, wow, that was, I was not ready for that.

253
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,840
So anyway, sorry, I didn't mean to be like glowing movie critic here, but that is, I

254
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,000
mean, but that conversation, it wasn't like, Oh, I got to go buy this Blu-ray or, Oh, I

255
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,840
got to go, you know, to the store or I got to go rent this.

256
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,840
I got to go to the rental store.

257
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,460
It's just, Oh, I'm going to log out of Netflix and get it, you know?

258
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:36,160
And that's why places like CBS all access with their Twilight zone remake and all this

259
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,680
stuff that, you know, looks, looks really good.

260
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,600
And, you know, everybody else wants to do all of their subscription things, right?

261
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,920
And then video game consoles have been a great way to kind of house all that in one, especially

262
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,040
these smart ones to kind of bring all that together.

263
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,580
Now here's, here's comes the game part, right?

264
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:57,320
Because music did it, TV did it.

265
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,960
How long before games do it?

266
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,320
And you already see a lot of companies dipping their toe in the water of this, right?

267
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:07,720
Like Microsoft very clearly is pushing this game pass thing.

268
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,720
That's what they want to do.

269
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,840
And they, they, they see this and Microsoft's like, Oh, I kind of want to be, you know,

270
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:18,200
we want to be like the Netflix video games, um, Nintendo to some extent for better, for

271
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,840
worse, doing it with their classic library on switch online.

272
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,840
Right.

273
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,840
Yeah.

274
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,360
But like, look at a lot of the games that like everybody's talking about right now.

275
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,000
It's like free stuff.

276
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,840
It's not like 60.

277
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,200
I mean, someone, I just want to buy Apex.

278
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,080
Everybody's talking about crackdown three.

279
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,960
They were pushing game pass on that.

280
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,280
And they're like, well, you could just purchase game pass and you get this for this or you

281
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,280
can buy the full thing.

282
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,380
I'm like, well, I'm just going to buy the full thing.

283
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,280
But to be honest, I probably could have just bought game pass for that.

284
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:50,120
Um, I just didn't know, like, I don't know if it works on PC yet.

285
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,360
Like I know a lot of stuff is crossed by, so you would think, okay, because it's available

286
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,080
in game pass, this should be available on PC to be able to download.

287
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,160
But I wasn't sure if that's a thing yet.

288
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,880
So I didn't purchase the game pass that way.

289
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,400
But um, having finished crackdown.

290
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,400
Yeah.

291
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,400
Yeah.

292
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,400
Lots of comments in chat on this subject.

293
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,400
Crystal skies.

294
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,400
80 says I did that with Anthem.

295
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:16,040
So I know some people are just buying that month subscription to the service because

296
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,480
maybe they feel like, Oh, I'm only going to really play Anthem for a month and then I'll

297
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,720
move over to the next big thing.

298
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,720
Right.

299
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,400
Like I feel like these types of services are made for people like me that just like don't

300
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,200
have gaming attention span.

301
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,200
Right.

302
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,200
Um, let's see.

303
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,160
200 Matt says I used to collect DVDs and Blu-rays not so much anymore with the instant gratification

304
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,440
I get from streaming it.

305
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,160
And not to, I think that's important too.

306
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,640
Like collectibles collectors, like definitely like, I'm not saying like kill Blu-rays.

307
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,640
Netflix is the only way.

308
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,640
I'm not saying that at all actually.

309
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:47,200
Cause like as collectibles as I will still even pick up a CD once in a while, but you

310
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:52,240
know where I'll pick up a CD at a concert with the artists there about ready to sign

311
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,440
it as like a memory, a collectible of that night or of that experience type of thing.

312
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,440
Right.

313
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,680
I don't buy CDs anymore.

314
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,760
Um, it was just because it's the way I listen to my music in my car.

315
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:07,680
Um, but I will purchase like MP3s directly from the artists and stuff a lot of times.

316
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,760
Like one artist I, I'm fawning over right now is the band Gunship.

317
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:16,440
So I tend to buy a lot of their albums and stuff all digitally.

318
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,920
And so they're getting all of the profit from that and their merch and all that kind of

319
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,920
stuff.

320
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,160
So I don't know, that seems to be the better way for me to do it because I can find music

321
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:31,880
online and I can purchase directly from the artists I used to though what I used to like

322
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,680
back before, you know, the internet was fast and everything was going to a lot of these

323
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:44,400
record stores and buying the like compilation, like trance electronica type things.

324
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,880
Cause that introduced me to more artists and stuff.

325
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,000
And then I could go search those artists out on, you know, which is funny because it's

326
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,120
like Spotify to me now is these playlists that are all curated by Spotify and it's like,

327
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,140
here's some of the artists you like with a few others mixed in we think you'd like.

328
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:03,880
And I got to say, like, I like, I've discovered like a lot of great music because of that,

329
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,400
that I really do like.

330
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,000
So I mean, not to like endorse somebody that's not paying for an advertisement, but it's,

331
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
it is what it is.

332
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Right.

333
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
That's kind of how it goes now.

334
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,960
So, and, um, funny enough, this whole show starting around dance, dance revolution and

335
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,720
music game culture, where did all that music from DDR come from in the beginning that dance

336
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,760
mania compilation, like the trance, but for, you know, silly dance music that was popular

337
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:26,760
overseas.

338
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,320
So it's kind of funny.

339
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,320
Yeah.

340
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,320
So that's pretty awesome.

341
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,160
Anyway, we deviated a little bit from the whole like steam doing movies, but I guess

342
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,320
this maybe all comes back to like, you know, maybe if steam had done something, it was

343
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,120
a little more subscription based or maybe something with original content.

344
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,280
But I also, I just feel like steam in this kind of era, I don't know if they've really

345
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:49,120
been doing it so much lately, but there's definitely a type of a time when steam was

346
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,160
just kind of like, Oh, we're just going to throw that in.

347
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,280
We're going to throw that in there.

348
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,200
We're going to throw in the movies and do that.

349
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:59,560
Well, the broadcasting too, do you guys remember steam has a whole like Twitch TV competitor

350
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:04,760
thing built into it, like steam broadcasting, even though he remembers that and why not?

351
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,960
Because they don't push it.

352
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:11,880
Steam just kind of, Hey, and maybe, you know, I don't, it may not be a space that they want

353
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:12,880
to get into.

354
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,720
I don't want to like hammer this into the ground, but maybe this is a drawback about

355
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,960
the way valve is structured in general, right?

356
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,760
You've heard this about valve, right?

357
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,840
Nobody has a title at valve.

358
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,320
Nobody has like primary responsibilities at valve.

359
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,880
They find something they want to work on.

360
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,880
It's just Gabe.

361
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,640
And then everybody else say, you guys might remember how I work at my job.

362
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,880
I find things I want to work on.

363
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,720
You guys might remember a long time ago when that, uh, employee manual from valve leaked

364
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,080
and who knows if it was intentional or not, but it describes a lot of this type of culture.

365
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:51,120
Maybe this is part of where there's a little bit of an issue because nobody is really designated

366
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:56,740
as, Oh, you're the guy that's going to make sure that broadcasting goes a step further

367
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,880
on steam or you're the guy that's going to make sure we make a lot of us are working

368
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,880
on half-life three.

369
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,880
No water.

370
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,880
It's not coming out.

371
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,880
Jeez.

372
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,360
So I thought you were working on it and I thought you were working on it.

373
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,360
I don't know.

374
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,380
That's just, that's just kind of my thought on steam.

375
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:16,600
Let me get a few more, uh, chat comments here in, uh, our chat, um, over Twitch TV slash

376
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,600
VOG network.

377
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:23,900
Miltonius games says, uh, it's hard now being more selective in what I put in my house while

378
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,500
also wanting to support smaller things.

379
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,700
That's why I like Twitch subs and Patrion.

380
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,940
Yeah, for sure.

381
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,540
Like, you know, and this is a great way.

382
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:35,820
Like obviously we are, we love you guys that do the subs and the biddies and stuff.

383
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:39,740
It does go a long way in running this as a business and helping us to grow and attend

384
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,740
more conventions, stuff like that.

385
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,900
But to, to spare you that whole line, like obviously that's a great way to really reach

386
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:49,260
out and directly affect, you know, creators and so forth.

387
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:53,340
Metal mayhem says, aside from some stuff that steam has given away for free, I never grabbed

388
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,660
any videos from steam, especially since most are streaming only.

389
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:00,020
If I were to pay money for digital videos, it'll be through iTunes or whatever, at least

390
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,000
there I can download videos.

391
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
There's a good point too.

392
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,480
If, if steam wasn't really letting you keep it on your own drive to like build up a collection

393
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,960
when your internet goes down or something like then, you know, that ownership I think

394
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,960
is important to some people.

395
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,400
I think that's a really good point.

396
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,280
So I'm pretty sure I had movies through like ultraviolet or something, but hell if I remember

397
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,200
what my, you, you did hear the news, the ultraviolet like, yeah, I don't care though.

398
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,360
I don't even care what movies I had on there.

399
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,720
There's a blue Ray over there on the counter and I was just looking at, I'm like, there's

400
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,400
a ultraviolet sticker on this.

401
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,880
I wonder if like Alan or I ever like redeem that.

402
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,720
There's so many people that probably never even bothered to redeem their digital copies.

403
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,720
I don't care.

404
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,160
Like at this point it's like, who cares?

405
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,800
Well, because now, I mean, I have, I have one goo or I have one movie on, on a Google

406
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,800
play movies.

407
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,800
What's that?

408
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,480
I have a elf because they gave it away for free one time.

409
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,680
I have a few movies on iTunes because they're all movies that I did shadowcast stuff with.

410
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,080
So I have Rocky horror picture show on iTunes.

411
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,920
I have clue the movie on iTunes.

412
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:06,700
I have repo the genetic opera on iTunes because it's great because you can go and any scene

413
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,900
like, on my phone, I can go and it's like, okay, we want to look at this one scene or

414
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,900
whatever.

415
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,900
It's just like right there.

416
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,260
And so that is extremely useful.

417
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:17,780
Um, but that's about, you know, the most that I've used that stuff for.

418
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,340
But anyway, so, um, I know there's like another part.

419
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,340
Yes.

420
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:25,720
So other stuff, since that's going away, well, what's, what's going in its place or what

421
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,700
other things are they adding to the service?

422
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:33,900
Well, one thing that they're going to be adding is, um, next VR virtual reality broadcasts.

423
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:39,540
So these are basically like broadcasts of different events like, uh, I see, uh, NHL

424
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:45,360
ICC soccer games, WWE matches, um, concerts and whatnot.

425
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:50,180
And so you can actually kind of have a view from, you know, court side or whatever.

426
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:54,500
And you can kind of look around as, um, like you're right there.

427
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,700
Um, so it's going to be available.

428
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:01,340
I think it's just like a software package that they're selling, um, but they're going

429
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:07,260
to basically allow you to, um, use your Vive or, you know, windows mixed reality headset

430
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,460
to watch this stuff on steam.

431
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,320
Um, that's cool.

432
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,820
Like it's nice to see VR in applications that aren't just games, you know, the real world

433
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,820
stuff.

434
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:22,580
And I kind of think this is the type of market that VR would be even, even more, you know,

435
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:26,780
get more exposure and stuff for, and why Facebook got on in the business of VR as well.

436
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:31,400
But, um, I digress it's, it's interesting though, that steam on the one hand, right

437
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,300
as they're saying, you know what, we're kind of done with this movies is yet welcoming

438
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:40,540
in, let's do this live broadcast and you know, event type broadcasting with the, you know,

439
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:45,980
same things people do pay-per-view for wrestling matches, concerts, and so forth when steam

440
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:51,180
hasn't really showed that they really go all in on anything like steam has broadcasting,

441
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:56,580
but it's surprising to this, like at like, can like not necessarily conventions there's

442
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:02,180
but like at arenas and stuff like actually have you pay subscription service to see all

443
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:06,660
of the shows that are at this arena, you know, from home and then virtual, I guess they'd

444
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,660
lose a lot of money that way.

445
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,500
And that's probably why they probably, I mean, arenas make a lot of money from food and you

446
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,500
know, everything else.

447
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:17,540
But I, I, I w but if you think of, I mean, if you think about like WrestleMania or something

448
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:20,780
like that, you know, once it sells out or whatever wrestling about, once it sells out,

449
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:24,200
they sell the pay-per-view so they'll, they'll still sell more seats and stuff.

450
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,900
But I think a subscription for that.

451
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:30,380
I mean, sure, it sounds great, but I don't know if finding, I mean, these, these stars

452
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,700
make a lot of money to do these live appearances.

453
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,440
So it'd be, it would be an expensive ticket if nothing else, you know, think about what

454
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,140
somebody is paying for a season ticket to like for the Kings game or something, you

455
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,140
know, they ain't cheap.

456
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,140
Well, I don't know.

457
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,140
Anyway.

458
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,140
All right.

459
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,140
Well, we'll see.

460
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:48,500
I'd be curious to see, you know, if steam actually kind of throws their back into this.

461
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,740
I mean, I know they have an interest in this to revive or if they just kind of half-ass

462
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:58,940
it or, um, you know, let's put this on other platforms like the PlayStation virtual reality

463
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,940
headset.

464
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,940
It'd be nice.

465
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:05,420
Um, in chat, um, Miltonius game says arena digital tickets will probably happen to be

466
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,420
fair.

467
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,660
I mean, short the subscription, maybe you're talking about the subscription thing he's

468
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:13,820
talking about, but as far as like, it kind of already happens, be it, you know, the football

469
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:17,580
game is on TV and it's being subsidized by advertising.

470
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,100
You're paying for it by watching ads, right?

471
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:22,420
When you watch the super bowl or the NFL or something like that.

472
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:26,860
Whether you're watching the NFL on Twitter or on NBC or whatever, you're, you're subsidizing

473
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,860
it with ads.

474
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,860
So you're still paying for it one way or the other.

475
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,860
Right.

476
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:34,260
Um, which is why if they don't sell X number of seats, if you get the blackout, right.

477
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:37,740
And you can't watch it because they want to fill up the arena first, but sure.

478
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:42,180
If they can find a way to, to milk it, to squeeze the toothpaste thing until it's completely

479
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,380
out, of course they'll sell more seats, but they're done.

480
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,060
They're not really, they do that for like sporting events.

481
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:49,140
They don't really, and like WrestleMania and boxing and stuff like that, but they don't

482
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,140
really do it for concerts.

483
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:56,100
Disney on ice or yeah, but like, well, once in a while it'll be like, Oh, but this last

484
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:01,100
concert on the tour they filmed for the blue Ray, you know, the, or, or that there might

485
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:05,860
be a pay-per-view event or something, but not every show, but it's, it's interesting.

486
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:10,540
It'd be interesting to see what next VR is kind of market would be for that and, and

487
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,020
what it might develop with that.

488
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:17,380
So, um, SSG100 Matt in our chat says there's going to be a war when it comes to live sports

489
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,420
and VR.

490
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:21,540
So much money is involved that it's going to explode very quickly.

491
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,540
Yeah.

492
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:26,980
I'll be so interesting in probably five years to look back on shows like this and what we

493
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:31,820
were thinking of VR then, because I think especially as that VR, you know, we got in

494
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:36,140
a little bit of a spirited exchange about VR last week on the show and, and, you know,

495
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:40,300
Jamie had brought up some concerns about like, you know, the big, the big like headset and

496
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,740
everything you kind of have to put on your head.

497
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,540
And I'm kind of like, I feel like that.

498
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,540
Sure.

499
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,540
Sure.

500
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,540
I mean, that makes a lot of sense now.

501
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:50,100
I don't like wearing that PlayStation headset even for an extended period of time, but you

502
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:55,240
know, the technology is going to be there in just five, 10 years wait, where it's just

503
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:59,700
like a little set of glasses, like swim goggles that you put on, and it's going to be able

504
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,700
to show VR.

505
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:05,980
And if you don't believe me, think about the desktop computer from 1995 that you had and

506
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:10,500
what these little cell phone guys can do now, you know, it's crazy.

507
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:14,260
So how fast technology advances and so forth.

508
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,060
So Bobby Black Wolf does point out.

509
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,680
So to be fair, next VR has been around for years.

510
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,380
It was even available for the Vive, just not on Steam.

511
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,820
It was on Vive port.

512
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,740
It's been an Oculus thing since 2015.

513
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:29,940
Well, certainly Steam going in there is now like, here's a chance to put it in front of

514
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:34,580
gamers and go into this audience and why not do gaming events?

515
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,580
Shit.

516
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,820
Esports getting more, more and more, right?

517
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:42,060
Especially as Overwatch League's really taken off, Dota, huge worldwide.

518
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:45,340
And Steam has a big thing for that.

519
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:48,900
So you know, that would be a great thing for them to do possibly with the VR.

520
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,940
But will they, will they go all in like that?

521
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,180
We don't know.

522
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,180
That's up to Valve, I guess.

523
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,180
Yeah.

524
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,180
All right.

525
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,180
So anyway, enough about that.

526
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,260
Let's move on because we have other stories to talk about, but of course we get to talk

527
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:02,380
about our own gaming weeks as well and the types of video games that we have been playing

528
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,380
this week.

529
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,860
So Loki, how was your gaming week?

530
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,860
It was all right.

531
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,200
I did play a few things.

532
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,420
So I finally got around to playing Tetris 99 and that was okay.

533
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,900
I played that for a bit.

534
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:15,860
Um, it's a little frustrating though, cause it's like, you kept coming in 80th place.

535
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,180
Well, yeah, that too.

536
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,540
But like, um, I didn't mean to shade you.

537
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:23,500
No, it's just like, it's just random, like garbage, like just comes on the screen all

538
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,500
the time.

539
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,500
I mean, and I get it.

540
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,500
That's the point of it.

541
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,620
But like, it seems like the whole targeting other people and stuff is pretty much useless.

542
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:33,380
Like I just said, it's a default to like whoever's attacking or whatever, but there's like, seems

543
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,780
no strategy whatsoever to that at all.

544
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:39,860
So I'll give a shout out, um, to, um, somebody who I know has listened to OLR in the past

545
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,660
and has had a lot of success on Twitch streaming this, but Kevin DDR, if you're out there,

546
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,660
howdy, howdy.

547
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,980
I'm glad to see you're doing very well for yourself on Twitch.

548
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,300
And uh, he streams a lot of this Tetris 99 because he was playing all like, it's the

549
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,660
same creators that made the grand master.

550
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:55,900
You know, he's done very well with that with the, um, um, Oh my God, why is the name of

551
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,060
that speed games done quick?

552
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,060
Yeah.

553
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,060
I knew it would come to me.

554
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:03,740
My brain's getting slower in my old age, but anyway, um, it's the same company that, that

555
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,660
made those games made this Tetris 99.

556
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:09,700
And so I've been watching his stream a little bit here that I've been lurking and uh, you

557
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:13,900
know, he's kind of explained some of like why he might target a certain way or do like

558
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,900
what he's doing.

559
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,340
And I've actually kind of learned a little bit just like watching him because the dude's

560
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:22,340
a pro when it comes to Tetris and he's, he does very well in his wins on that.

561
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:26,940
So kind of interesting how you can like learn about the game stuff from watching people

562
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,940
on Twitch and stuff.

563
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:28,940
Yeah.

564
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:32,100
Back in the day it was come over to my house and watch me beat level three, three when

565
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,100
you could do it.

566
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,740
And you know, now it's Twitch.

567
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,740
Yeah.

568
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,620
So I did play a little bit of that and it was all right.

569
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:42,900
I tried out the demo for Daemon X Machina and I was bored with that.

570
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:48,260
I am not picking up that game, which is disappointing because I like armored core and stuff, but

571
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,540
I just didn't find this game too exciting.

572
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,120
I'm curious why bored?

573
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:57,020
You just, just, it just, it was very slow paced and it seemed like that everything was

574
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,420
kind of lock on targeting type stuff.

575
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:07,380
It just didn't have the kind of, uh, action and, um, I don't know.

576
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:13,860
It wasn't paced as well as like armored core where it was like pretty fast paced and dashing

577
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,860
around stuff.

578
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:18,540
It was more of like, okay, fly around and shoot a thing and okay.

579
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:23,180
And I don't know, it was all right, but I am not planning on picking it up, which is

580
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:28,680
this point because it looked pretty awesome originally, but, um, I did mostly play this

581
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:33,500
week, uh, crackdown three, uh, I didn't get the stream many of it, but I finished the

582
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,500
game.

583
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:38,860
It was very short, but I mean, it's crackdown and crackdown was very short as well.

584
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:42,180
They, they want you to play through it multiple times, I guess.

585
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:45,900
I don't know if I'm going to do that, but I'm at the point now where I was just trying

586
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:52,180
to a hundred percent, everything max out my, uh, agent, but I don't know how long I'm actually

587
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,300
gonna play around with that.

588
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,900
Cause it's getting to the point now where it's boring.

589
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:01,620
Even like with like some of the later levels, all they do is just throw more things at your

590
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,620
way.

591
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:07,180
And it's like artificially trying to increase the difficulty by just throwing like, okay,

592
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,300
now there's 30 people attacking you at once.

593
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,300
Okay.

594
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,300
Well, they're not even harder to kill.

595
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:15,700
It's just, I'm getting shot by like every little thing in all sides and somehow they're

596
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:20,540
able to track me even though they can't see me and it's just ridiculous stuff like that.

597
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,420
But there's not much of a penalty for dying.

598
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,420
You just kind of respawn.

599
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:29,180
And especially with the boss fights, you respond, the boss is just like, Oh, Hey, the boss followed

600
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,180
me.

601
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:34,420
I'm here and the boss is flying around or something and, and even like the end boss

602
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:38,620
in the game was just very kind of, that's it.

603
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,900
This is your big boss.

604
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,260
It's pretty lame.

605
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,340
Okay.

606
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:47,220
And then they hint at something like, I don't know if it's from the earlier games because

607
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:53,760
I have played cracked in one and two, um, but like they hint at some, like there's like

608
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:59,060
some guys severed arm and I'm supposed to know who the fuck this person is.

609
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:03,540
And like, he's supposed to be the guy that's like kind of controlling everything, but then

610
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,140
there's like, it doesn't go anywhere.

611
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,940
It's just, you finish the game and you're done.

612
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:12,340
And it's like, stay tuned for the DLC or like sequel.

613
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,700
I mean cracked up in form.

614
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,420
I got the way another 12 years for that.

615
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:18,640
I mean like, I don't know what they were trying to do with that.

616
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:25,620
And I mean, I guess my bad if I don't remember the first and second game that well, I know

617
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:30,580
like, I think some of the agents that were in the first game are like DNA things that

618
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,100
you can find in the new game.

619
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:36,100
And I, maybe that's the same with the second game as well, but I remember there were some

620
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:40,740
like agent Rodriguez or something like that, that were in the first game.

621
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,020
Um, but I don't know.

622
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:47,040
It's just kind of, it's just cracked down.

623
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,040
It's what it is.

624
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:52,180
It's very, I had very low expectations for it and it's kind of, I don't know.

625
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:57,500
It was entertaining, but now that I've finished it within like a week, I kind of wish, gee,

626
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:03,620
that game pass would have been a, you know, a worthy investment because this game isn't

627
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:06,380
very long and the multiplayer, I have no interest in playing.

628
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,020
I was just about to ask about multiplayer.

629
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,580
I haven't played the multiplayer yet.

630
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,580
I could try that.

631
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:12,140
I guess I've watched people play it online.

632
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:18,540
I hear it's kind of lame just because it ends up being, um, since you can see the other

633
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:21,460
players at all times on the map.

634
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:25,940
So like you can see the Reddit, like where they are, even through buildings and stuff

635
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:31,700
so that it ends up being whoever gets to the homing missiles first wins because it's just

636
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,700
you homing missile, homing missiles all the time.

637
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:37,020
Oh, so there's no like, there's no way you can hide or there's no stealth in it.

638
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,280
No weird.

639
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,380
So I don't know.

640
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:43,700
I'll try, but it's not something like I'm very excited about.

641
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,700
Co-op might be fun.

642
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:48,340
If I had someone to play with, it'd be kind of fun, but you know, my character is maxed

643
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:52,820
out and you can restart the game with your character maxed out.

644
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:56,000
I don't know why I would want to do that other than, Oh, now I can rush just straight to

645
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,340
the end and just kill the boss and be done.

646
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,340
I don't know.

647
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,340
We'll see.

648
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:06,300
I'm kind of getting over this already, but it was fun while it lasted.

649
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,300
All right.

650
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,300
I'm going to go and that's about it.

651
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,300
Um, okay.

652
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,900
For my week, Pokemon go as well.

653
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,340
They had that special little clam Pearl day.

654
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,340
I got one of those.

655
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:20,500
I had, I had family stuff, so I couldn't really like go the whole three hours, but they really

656
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,340
improved on that Phoebus event, which was a similar thing.

657
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:26,040
Um, a couple of months ago they did, they really improved on it.

658
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,140
Like the quests were much more manageable and it was nice that they kind of changed

659
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,620
the spawns during that time as well.

660
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:34,500
So I caught two shinies only getting to play for like an hour and a half.

661
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,820
So I was pretty happy with it.

662
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:40,940
Um, and, uh, I just wish, like, I don't want there to be a Pokemon go thing every freaking

663
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:41,940
weekend.

664
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,940
You know what I mean?

665
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:46,140
Like, I don't, I wish they would just do like one weekend a month and that's it.

666
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:51,620
You know, and then don't, don't give us more than like a few days before, you know, cause

667
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:55,300
they only announced it on like Tuesday or Wednesday that, Hey, this Saturday is going

668
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,300
to be a big event.

669
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,300
And it's like, you know,

670
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:01,140
Or do them at different times, like shuffle the times around to like,

671
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,140
Be careful what you ask for.

672
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:05,860
Cause that next community day, the next community day they're doing is Trico and it's going

673
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:10,300
to be a March 23rd and it's from 3 PM to 6 PM.

674
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,260
So they're doing it more in the evening.

675
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,780
Well that's, and that's our time.

676
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:16,180
So East coasters, that's going to be 6 PM to 9 PM.

677
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,180
That's like at night.

678
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:21,500
So it's going to be a little weird, I think, but here's, so a lot of people don't understand

679
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,140
the why behind it.

680
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:27,400
And I'm not saying this is the reason, but I am saying this is quite the coincidence.

681
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:31,240
So their other game Niantic's other game, Ingress, which you all know I've followed

682
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,420
for a long time.

683
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:37,940
Um, Ingress is having a big, uh, what they call anomaly event, which is their live events.

684
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:41,220
Now obviously they're not nearly as big as what happens in Pokemon go, but they are events

685
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:44,900
that take that game's resources, um, in cities around the world.

686
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:49,060
So in the U S it happens to be on that day, uh, funny enough, Atlanta, uh, where our pal

687
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:52,420
Bobby's at is one of the cities and Las Vegas is the other.

688
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:58,860
So that event runs from, I think it's 10 AM until either 1 PM or 2 PM.

689
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:05,040
But that event is already in the block where, uh, community day would usually be.

690
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,660
So how about you just don't do a community day next week?

691
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,780
That's, I mean, that would have been my answer.

692
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:13,460
Like I can't explain why they insist on doing them the same day, but I was going to say

693
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,580
there's a lot of Ingersers that also play Pokemon go.

694
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:19,060
That'd be kind of pissed because you really have to focus when it's anomaly time.

695
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:22,220
Cause that's, you know, player, very, very intense player versus player stuff.

696
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,220
Right.

697
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:26,500
Um, so, uh, you don't want to be over there catching Pokemon.

698
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:30,380
So they probably scattered out the times a little bit so people could do both, but why

699
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,300
did they feel the need to do?

700
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:35,140
I don't think any Ingress player would have been upset.

701
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,940
And to be fair, there's far less Ingress players, Pokemon go players.

702
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:38,980
I get that.

703
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:42,700
But you also have to consider resources on Niantic system and so forth because lots of

704
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,620
Ingress players will be logged in at that time.

705
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:49,180
But anyway, um, I'm just surprised they just didn't do it a different, do it on the Sunday.

706
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:53,940
You know, I was going to stop and say, Oh, I got to catch Trico because dude, it's Trico.

707
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:54,940
Yeah.

708
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:57,180
Uh, Bobby and Chad is asking Rob, so you flying out?

709
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,180
No, no, I'm not.

710
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,180
Nothing that great.

711
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:05,500
Well, I guess maybe a little that crazy because it is why I am going to Chicago in may, uh,

712
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,700
Memorial day weekend.

713
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:10,620
They're doing a big event in Chicago, but the thing about Chicago that makes it special

714
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:14,220
is that whereas I mentioned there's cities around the world in Las Vegas, Atlanta, or

715
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:19,420
two of them in that weekend in may, Memorial day weekend in Chicago, that is the only one

716
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,640
is Chicago.

717
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,640
That's it.

718
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:24,400
And then they're doing another mega anomaly in Asia somewhere.

719
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,740
One of the other weekends.

720
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:28,500
So um, that's part of the reason I'm going to Chicago.

721
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,140
And the fact I just know like people in Chicago always have a good time there.

722
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:36,020
So um, yeah, anyway, I didn't mean to digress an Ingress tangent, but I guess I did.

723
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:40,220
But it also, I think explains why maybe they're changing things up in Pokemon go.

724
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:44,580
Um, other games I played this week, uh, I've continued to play things like world of Warcraft,

725
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:50,140
of course, and kingdom hearts three at Tetris 99 is still fun for me.

726
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:54,820
Um, but I did play some, well, I played some old stuff and some new stuff.

727
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,180
So here's the old thing.

728
00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:00,380
So my buddy Delvin or VG realness, uh, who's probably in chat right now.

729
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:06,140
I saw a minute ago, uh, convinced me to start a fantasy star online character.

730
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,140
Yes.

731
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:13,380
Fancy star online from like 2000, uh, which I think blue burst went offline in like 2007.

732
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:17,780
But of course, thanks to the wonders of homegrown servers and how they, so there's still servers

733
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,140
where you can play fantasy star online to this day.

734
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:25,740
Um, like the dream cast one, uh, this one's, this one's all powered on, I'm sure that exists,

735
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:30,100
but the one I'm playing is all powered on blue burst, uh, the piece that they had, which

736
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:33,660
is the same, it's the same game, but blue burst had episode four.

737
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:37,980
So there's actually kind of like more, so the PC probably got the biggest version, so

738
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,980
to speak.

739
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:43,020
Um, so he convinced me to roll a character there and I was playing that actually Friday

740
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:46,340
night on my personal stream over at Rob Roberts on Twitch.

741
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,900
We went for like four hours.

742
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:51,420
We were, I was playing like all night Friday, started a character from scratch, got all

743
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,940
the way up to like level 11.

744
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:53,940
We were having a good time.

745
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:54,940
Bobby joined us for a little while.

746
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:55,940
Uh, it was fun.

747
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,940
Yeah.

748
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:01,140
Um, we'll probably stream that again at some point because I, as much as I would like play

749
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:06,340
fantasy star online, I would get through like forest, maybe a little bit of caves.

750
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,820
I think I got to the third one.

751
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,340
What's the third one ruins or something.

752
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:15,380
I think I got as far as that, but like I've never actually beat fantasy star online.

753
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:18,740
So Delvin's like, no, we're doing this.

754
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:22,060
We're going to, we're going to, this is going to be a series on Twitch.

755
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,460
We're going to beat this damn game.

756
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:26,580
So I'm like, okay, I'm kind of into it because fantasy star is fun.

757
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:29,520
Playing with friends is fun and talking and stuff is always a good time.

758
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,900
So I've been enjoying that.

759
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:36,460
So living it up like it's the year 2000, but I did play new stuff as well.

760
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,460
Okay.

761
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:42,620
So I finally, after all the talk about it for like three weeks, I went into my first

762
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,300
apex legends matches.

763
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,300
Okay.

764
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:49,100
So I did it not only on PlayStation four, but I also played on PC.

765
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:54,180
So I did, um, I did a match on each and, uh, it was, it was funny.

766
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:58,100
You know what the, on the PlayStation four match I did, we came in fourth.

767
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,100
Not bad.

768
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,100
Right.

769
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,100
Out of like 20 teams.

770
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,100
So here's the thing.

771
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:06,380
So like I noticed because I was a level one player, I was getting matched with people

772
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:11,900
on my squad that were like level 24, level 26, like I was getting matched with like high

773
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:12,900
level people.

774
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,900
Right.

775
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:17,860
So I was just like, I'm just going to follow and like what I thought was so, so I played

776
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:22,140
lifeline when I played on PlayStation four and, um, I was just like, it's like, you are

777
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,140
the jump master.

778
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,140
I was like, the fuck I am.

779
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:26,580
I, I, cause there's a button you can press to pass it to somebody else.

780
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,900
I'm like, I don't know where to land us.

781
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,520
So that's the nice thing is you can pass somebody else.

782
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,140
But I will say one thing I really did like about apex legends, nobody was really talking

783
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:36,100
at all on the headsets, which is fine because people could be shitty.

784
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:38,180
Um, but they were using that ping.

785
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:41,260
Like it was like, I was like, they like were paying and everything paying.

786
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,260
There's a gun over here.

787
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,260
Ping.

788
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:46,260
And the nice way it's built into the game is that the characters like talk about the

789
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,060
pings, you know, and so forth.

790
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:52,060
And like, let's say somebody pinged a gun, like bloodhound might go like, there's a gun

791
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,060
over here.

792
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,940
However, bloodhounds accents, very unique.

793
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,780
Uh, you know, it says like, there's going to be here.

794
00:38:56,780 --> 00:39:00,800
And then if you go pick up the gun, you can, you'll say, press down to thank bloodhound

795
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,800
and see press down.

796
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,420
And then, you know, lifeline will be like, thank you.

797
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,340
I needed that or whatever, you know, she says.

798
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,500
So it was kind of, kind of fun in that regard.

799
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:12,260
So yeah, all I did, I just kind of like, I just ran with my, I was just like, okay, when

800
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,100
you're a new player, just stick with your squad.

801
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,100
Right.

802
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:18,100
That's the thing that annoys veteran players is when new people get in there and think

803
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,060
like, just run off crazy.

804
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,060
So I stayed with my people.

805
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,060
I don't wait.

806
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:26,020
I was like, okay, when I see people show up, I'll put down the little drone and we did

807
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,020
okay for ourselves.

808
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:30,940
I got to say, I got to give props to the, the Wraith and our match because it was me,

809
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:35,580
a bloodhound or lifeline bloodhound Wraith and myself and bloodhound died.

810
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:40,560
Wraith fucking went back, saved us when all the way to one of those respawn points to

811
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,500
bring us back into the match.

812
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,500
Like she was a rock star.

813
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:47,620
She brought us back like, and then we were able to, that's how we got fourth place because

814
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:51,140
pretty much she was sneaking around everything to get to the respawn thing and got us back

815
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:54,180
in the match after like four more teams have been eliminated.

816
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,180
So that was kind of fun.

817
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,180
Right.

818
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:58,380
And the way I'm talking about it, it's kind of like a sports match or something.

819
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,380
So it was fun.

820
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:04,720
I played it on PC that time I played as bloodhound because I'm, I want to see, I want to see

821
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,980
some different abilities.

822
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,660
And I heard the tracking thing was pretty cool.

823
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:11,540
And a good thing for new players to do is that you can just keep spamming that tracking

824
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,540
thing.

825
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,540
And it's actually kind of helpful for people.

826
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:16,320
So I was like, all right, I'll try this with bloodhound, but my experience didn't go as

827
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:22,940
well on PC because the, the jump master kept launching us back in air and like would not

828
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,360
find a place to land.

829
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,960
And then of course, all of a sudden they got on the mic and then of course the two of them

830
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,840
got on the microphones and it was like, dude, what the fuck you're going to fucking land

831
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,900
this fucking thing.

832
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,900
What the fuck are you doing?

833
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:40,180
As people do, you know, when they go, when it's like when this microphone ends up in

834
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:43,500
their mouth, it's just instantly there, they, they go to shit.

835
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,500
And that's it.

836
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,700
So I tried to kind of do the same thing and I stuck with the team, but of course the two

837
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,020
of them were fighting and it was just ugly.

838
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,800
And how about this, Loki?

839
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,420
We came in 16th.

840
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:59,140
Imagine that, yeah.

841
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:03,740
So when everything was polite and using pings and they were helping me out, we get forth

842
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:09,100
when everybody's like, it's 16th, irritating.

843
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,100
Anyway.

844
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,100
All right.

845
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:16,340
Uh, going to our chat over Twitch TV, uh, slash vog network, uh, Miltonias game says,

846
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:19,740
I love that lifeline can drop helpful gear us for special power.

847
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,700
I can help while being bad.

848
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:27,020
Have you noticed that apex really pushes you to play lifeline?

849
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,440
Like and I think that's smart.

850
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:34,740
Like the game teaches you to start as a support character cause you play lifeline in the tutorial.

851
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:38,260
Lifeline is like your default character and your profile and all this.

852
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:43,580
Like the game really pushes the healer on you and she's not, I mean like you, it's not

853
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:48,660
like, it's not like you're playing, um, overwatch and like you're attacking is completely like

854
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,660
negated.

855
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:52,260
Like you can still fire a gun as lifeline.

856
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,960
It's just her ability is more around the healing and the special drops and all that.

857
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,600
So the game really pushes you to want to like lifeline, which I think is really smart and

858
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,340
probably part of the reason it's doing well.

859
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,940
Um, let's see.

860
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:06,800
And a metal mayhem says, Hey now race and all star gets, Oh God, he's quoting lyrics

861
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,800
from smash mouth.

862
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:12,940
Uh, and then it says, I had a roommate in college put on academic probation because

863
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:15,240
he skipped class to play PSL.

864
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,320
That was a million years ago.

865
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:18,080
He somehow graduated in the end.

866
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,060
Do you know like fantasy star online has come up?

867
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:22,960
Like not just on the Twitch chat, but in some of the group chats and so forth.

868
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:27,120
Do you know how many people I've talked to that are like, Oh yeah, I flunked XYZ because

869
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:30,600
of PSL like fantasy star online, like ruined lives.

870
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:33,500
It's pretty impressive, pretty impressive.

871
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:35,840
So anyway, there it is.

872
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:40,600
Uh, some old stuff and some new stuff and I had a fun week and I will continue to play

873
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,200
more in the coming weeks.

874
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,200
Yes.

875
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,820
So, all right, well, let's move on.

876
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:45,860
Let's get to some more gaming news.

877
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,440
I don't really have a lot of housekeeping.

878
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,160
You should continue to follow us on Twitch, Twitch, of course, at VOG network, Twitter

879
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,160
as well.

880
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:56,040
Uh, at OLR is where our Twitter account is that we're also on Facebook, facebook.com

881
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,600
slash orange lounge radio.

882
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,160
So let's get to some more gaming news.

883
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,160
Yes.

884
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:06,480
So there's an announcement from Google that's going to happen during GDC.

885
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:14,280
Um, it's on the 19th, they've got a little animated, um, image that they're talking about.

886
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:19,480
It's kind of like teasing this mysterious announcement, basically saying, you know,

887
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:26,620
gather around, uh, all will be explained on three 19 and of course this is expected to

888
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:31,660
be their announcement of their new, um, gaming platform.

889
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:35,780
So it could be a console or whatever, uh, some code name yeti.

890
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:41,180
And they've kind of dabbled with gaming stuff before with, um, they had the whole experiment

891
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:46,180
with assassin's creed, odyssey, the could stream in the Chrome browser type thing.

892
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:50,940
Um, so maybe it has something to do with that, but I guess we'll find out in about a month.

893
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:53,780
It's only, it's not that long.

894
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:58,020
So it kind of neat to see what this will be.

895
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:59,020
Any thoughts?

896
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:00,820
I know everybody's playing armchair.

897
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:01,820
I don't know.

898
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:06,220
My thought is I'm going to be underwhelmed because it always tends to be like whenever

899
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:10,740
one of these platforms comes out with, Oh, Hey, we're going to do some gaming thing.

900
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:11,740
You know what?

901
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:17,820
Whether it be like games center on the iOS and whatever Android has on the Google side

902
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:20,140
of things, Google play games or something like that.

903
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:23,780
It's just very, eh, achievements.

904
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:24,780
Yay.

905
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:28,060
It's like, don't really care.

906
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:36,180
Um, I hope it's cool, but I, I'm, my level of expectation is around Ouya Ouya level.

907
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:41,020
Well, I mean, one of the theories running around out there is that Google might be starting

908
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:44,940
their own types of game service, which tying into the beginning, you know, segment of our

909
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:47,420
show might not be such a bad idea.

910
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:49,180
It just depends on the quality of games.

911
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:56,380
Like if Google streaming games is like Farmville and match three tournament and solitaire,

912
00:44:56,380 --> 00:45:00,100
I don't know if it's going to be very compelling, but if Google can sign up some partners of

913
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:03,420
some big games that people want to play, it might be a little more impressive.

914
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:07,180
But of course, you know, bandwidth is always a concern with the streaming stuff.

915
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:11,220
We didn't really get into that earlier, but a comment in our chat, a pixel pocket says

916
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:14,820
the projects stream thing worked surprisingly well.

917
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:18,740
If everyone had no data caps and high speed internet, that it would be a massive game

918
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:19,740
changer.

919
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:23,080
And Bobby Blackwell follows that up saying bandwidth caps are going to be a big issue

920
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:25,180
and not many people talk about it.

921
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:31,220
Well, until we push back on the cable companies for what we want and get those data caps inflated.

922
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:36,300
I think eventually once we get, you know, some Democratic leadership that we'll get

923
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:40,020
them outlawing data caps and that kind of stuff, it's just unfortunately, we just have

924
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,580
like the whole I don't even know if it has to be a political thing.

925
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:46,780
I think the political thing has to fix that whole issue with the net neutrality.

926
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:52,340
But I digress the whole when it comes to data caps, I think ultimately consumers are going

927
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:56,820
to be like, this is bullshit because of all these things that are around the popular place.

928
00:45:56,820 --> 00:46:00,780
Like, you know, I remember when data caps were like a lot smaller, especially on cell

929
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:01,780
phones.

930
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:02,780
Right.

931
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:03,780
Because they're like, right.

932
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:05,300
Nobody uses over two gigs in a month.

933
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,380
Nobody uses two gigs in a month.

934
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:08,420
And that was like three years ago, four years ago.

935
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:11,140
Now it's like nobody uses more than 10 gigs in a month.

936
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:16,260
And of course, when I went and checked my usage on AT&T, I use 18 gigs in a month.

937
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:18,340
So thankfully I have unlimited.

938
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:19,340
That's yeah.

939
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:20,340
That's a lot.

940
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:25,380
But dude, Spotify and podcasts in the car, Ingress and Pokemon go a lot, which is always

941
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:26,380
downloading data.

942
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:27,380
Right.

943
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:28,380
Uh, you know, listening to music.

944
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:32,780
If I'm in my desk at work and streaming from there, uh, you know, you use a lot of data.

945
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:35,460
I'm always usually on wifi, so I don't tend to use that.

946
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,460
I don't.

947
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,940
My wifi, wifi at work is non-existent.

948
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:38,940
I have to be on.

949
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:39,940
Yeah.

950
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:44,060
So yeah, but I pay for it.

951
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:45,580
You sold me an unlimited plan.

952
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:46,820
I'm going to cash in.

953
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:48,100
I'm not pirating or anything.

954
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,260
I'm just, you know, a heavy user.

955
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:55,940
So anyway, um, well, could Google, Google, I brought up cell phones.

956
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:57,980
Google's in the cell phone arena.

957
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:01,540
Do you think they might do something with like, I don't know, something where it's like,

958
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:06,300
Oh, it's on your computer and it's on your phone through the new, you know, probably

959
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:09,860
I think if anything, they're going to do something integrated into Chrome.

960
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:13,940
Um, so yeah, I could see them doing that.

961
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:14,940
I don't know.

962
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:19,340
I actually be curious to see, I didn't actually get the play, uh, Assassin's Creed Odyssey

963
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:20,980
when they had that in Chrome.

964
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:27,420
So I don't know what the hardware requirements are for that type of stuff, but I mean, I

965
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:28,420
don't know.

966
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:29,420
We'll see.

967
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:33,140
It has to have something that I'm really interested in and just a lot of these like platforms

968
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:34,220
that they come out with.

969
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:37,720
It's just kind of like, I don't really need another platform to play like Assassin's Creed

970
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:42,620
Odyssey on or, you know, whatever else is going to be on there.

971
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:44,940
Like I have a huge steam library.

972
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:49,340
Give me something that I really want that makes it, you know, really accessible for

973
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:50,340
me to play.

974
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:54,180
Like I, for example, would love Xbox game pass.

975
00:47:54,180 --> 00:48:00,420
If I could play my Xbox three 60 backwards compatible games on the PC would be pretty

976
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:01,420
awesome.

977
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:06,940
You kind of can because you use the whole, like, um, you go into the Xbox app and you

978
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:09,940
stream from your Xbox one to your PC.

979
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:10,940
I've done that.

980
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:14,540
I've played like dungeon siege three on my PC, but it's, it's really playing it on the

981
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:15,540
Xbox one.

982
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:19,420
I've tried doing that with my PlayStation four, although I haven't tried with the pro

983
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:20,420
yet though.

984
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:24,500
So I mean, that might work a little bit better with the pro, but before my original PlayStation

985
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:29,700
four, I tried doing that and it was mixed from just kind of like, okay.

986
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:36,300
And working to, it's just not working at all on my internal network in, I mean, my PlayStation's

987
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:41,740
wired directly to the router and I mean, I don't think there was that much bandwidth

988
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:42,940
traffic going on.

989
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:48,820
There's Netflix, but I mean, that shouldn't be clogging up my, you know, network that

990
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:49,820
much, but who knows?

991
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:52,900
I think bandwidth caps are going to go up again in a couple of years.

992
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:58,120
I just, I would, I would hope more providers are able to provide internet when that element

993
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:02,700
gets more competitive, which it very well might as over the air speeds and five G and

994
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:03,700
stuff.

995
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,340
I mean, five G is supposedly really, really fast.

996
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:08,500
I haven't been able to use it myself yet, but five G supposedly like, so waiting and

997
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:11,860
fast for fucking Verizon to get out of Sacramento to do it.

998
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:15,780
So it's, well, you mean out, out into the suburbs of Sacramento, apparently downtown.

999
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:16,780
Yes.

1000
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:17,780
Yeah.

1001
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:20,800
But, um, yeah, but as that stuff becomes more and more, and maybe I think that's when finally

1002
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:25,220
there's going to be more competition for companies like Comcast and your, your more traditional

1003
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:29,900
broadband providers is when it's so fast in the air that it competes with that.

1004
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:34,940
And then that's when all that discussion on data caps and stuff will have to be reevaluated,

1005
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:35,940
I suppose.

1006
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:36,940
Yeah.

1007
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:37,940
So we'll see.

1008
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:38,940
Anyway.

1009
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:45,180
Um, going into our chat at Twitch TV slash vog network, uh, Bobby points out Loki.

1010
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:46,260
It depends on your router.

1011
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:49,640
Some routers can't handle multiple streams like that and others can.

1012
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:52,700
So if someone else is streaming Netflix and you're trying to do share play between a PS

1013
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:57,540
four and PC, some routers don't have the CPU to be able to accurately handle that.

1014
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:58,540
That is very true.

1015
00:49:58,540 --> 00:49:59,900
And I am streaming from the Xbox one.

1016
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,740
It's like, don't try to do anything else on the internet.

1017
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:06,460
Oh, I thought I had a pretty decent router, but I could always get one with more antennas

1018
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:07,460
on it.

1019
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:09,620
It doesn't look gamer enough yet.

1020
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:10,780
Yeah, it doesn't look gamer enough.

1021
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:15,380
Uh, and then a DJ Ram S in chat says, looks at Verizon router bandwidth caps.

1022
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:16,380
What's that?

1023
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:17,380
So, yeah, there you go.

1024
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:18,380
All right.

1025
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:19,520
Anyhow, let's move on to another story.

1026
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,580
And I know a lot of people are talking about this this week.

1027
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:25,860
I'm sure you guys have heard of this, but, uh, it was announced by Reggie fees and may,

1028
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:31,020
uh, on a special, uh, little, uh, announcement on their Twitter channel and YouTube and all

1029
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:34,340
that, uh, that Reggie fees and may plans to retire, uh, Reggie fees and may has been

1030
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:37,380
with Nintendo for 15 years, if you can believe it.

1031
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:42,040
Uh, and he is going to be retiring and, uh, the current senior vice president of sales

1032
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:47,700
and marketing, uh, Doug Bowser will succeed Reggie as the president of Nintendo of America.

1033
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:52,900
I'm sure you have heard the whole Bowser taking over Nintendo memes to death.

1034
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:57,300
So I will only bug you with that, that one time, although, you know, it is, it's kind

1035
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,980
of one of those, Oh, that's cute, but you know, it is.

1036
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:02,300
It is an actual like German last name and stuff.

1037
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:06,160
So, you know, it's not like, I don't think he was picked for his name that he was picked

1038
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,580
for his town, but he is leaning into it though.

1039
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:10,020
Well, yeah, he has fun.

1040
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:11,020
Sure.

1041
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:13,020
And I think when you're in a situation like that, you should have fun with it.

1042
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:14,020
Right.

1043
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:17,740
And you know, like when Doug Bowser was first tired, there was that picture of him on Twitter

1044
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:18,900
and he's like, I'm happy to be here.

1045
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:19,900
He's like holding a sign.

1046
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:24,640
If you look very subtly, it's very subtle in the background, but there's a stuffed animals

1047
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:28,980
or like whatever you call stuff, figures stuff, plushes of Mario and Luigi tied up with a

1048
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:30,500
GameCube controller.

1049
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:31,500
That's funny.

1050
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:34,980
That's, I love that like subtleness where it's like, you look twice, you got to look

1051
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:36,220
a little deeper to see that.

1052
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:41,120
So, and I'm sure, I'm sure in a Nintendo direct or something, there'll be something very tongue

1053
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,180
and cheek, but let's not forget.

1054
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:50,100
Nintendo is still very much a Japanese country, the country, you know what I mean?

1055
00:51:50,100 --> 00:51:51,100
Company.

1056
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:52,100
Thank you.

1057
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:54,900
Uh, it's still very much a Japanese company and all the big, big decisions are being made

1058
00:51:54,900 --> 00:52:00,060
in Japan and what, you know, Reggie Fils-Aime has been doing, very charismatic, great leader

1059
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:05,260
for the US and helping to get switch systems sold in the US.

1060
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:07,580
That is what Reggie Fils-Aime's job has been.

1061
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:10,020
And that's what, um, Doug Bowser will be doing.

1062
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:15,740
Um, of course the folks over in Japan, happy to see him go, uh, Shuntaro Furukawa, who

1063
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:18,860
is the current president of Nintendo said, I really appreciate everything Reggie has

1064
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:21,140
done for Nintendo inside and outside our company.

1065
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:23,000
Reggie is known as an exceptional leader.

1066
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,800
We are grateful that he is leaving the business in good shape with strong momentum.

1067
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:30,400
While we will miss him and we wish him the very best in his retirement, what we are also

1068
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,800
pleased to have such an able successor ready to step into that role.

1069
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:39,080
Uh, and then Reggie in his own comments said, quote, Nintendo owns a part of my heart forever.

1070
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:43,160
It's a part that is filled with gratitude for the incredibly talented people I've worked

1071
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:47,040
with for the opportunity to represent such a wonderful brand and most of all, to feel

1072
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:51,280
like a member of the world's most positive and enduring gamer community.

1073
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,960
As I look forward to departing in both good health and good humor, this is not game over

1074
00:52:54,960 --> 00:53:00,440
for me, but instead leveling up to more time with my wife, family, and friends.

1075
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:03,480
And you know, uh, he's going out at the top of his game.

1076
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:07,720
You know, it might be a little different story if this was during some of the Wii U years.

1077
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:11,000
I don't think, I don't think it really would be that different because Reggie Fils-Aime

1078
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,120
has always really kind of been very liked as I think a charismatic leader by gamers

1079
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:16,120
and so forth.

1080
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:20,560
So I think no matter when he decided he was ready to move on, uh, he, he would have gotten

1081
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:21,560
a warm reception.

1082
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:26,240
But certainly, you know, if he does decide he wants to do more in the future, he's going

1083
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,800
out on the top of his game and this is a great thing, you know, in his resume that, you know,

1084
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,200
I left when the switch was a all time success.

1085
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:37,480
Um, keep in mind, Reggie Fils-Aime has not always been games, uh, before he was at Nintendo.

1086
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,480
I believe it was at Panda express.

1087
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,800
I don't know if that was the immediate thing, but it was certainly at some point before

1088
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:49,800
there, he was, uh, uh, uh, I think he was at, uh, PEP was it Pepsi or young foods or

1089
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:50,800
anything?

1090
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:51,800
Perhaps.

1091
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:52,800
I don't know.

1092
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:56,000
I just remember that Panda, but, but anyway, I mean, you know, I, and everybody's like,

1093
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:01,220
I wonder why he's leaving and there's a part of me that says, how many of you have stayed

1094
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:02,960
at jobs for 15 years?

1095
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,240
He's been there for 15 years.

1096
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,240
I've gotten close.

1097
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:07,320
I was at my last job for 14 years.

1098
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,120
That's 14 and a half at my last job.

1099
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,120
Yeah.

1100
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,120
Got close.

1101
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:12,680
But you know, even then it was like about the time where you're like, all right, I really

1102
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:14,880
like, you know, the signs are in the air and it was one of those things where I was like,

1103
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,120
I really need to go do something else.

1104
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:17,280
And so I did.

1105
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:22,420
And you know, for whatever reason, like I doubt, I doubt it's anything negative at all.

1106
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:26,600
You know, Reggie, maybe he wants to do something that's not video games, you know, even you

1107
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:30,320
can be a gaming fan and like things that aren't video games, right?

1108
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,320
Yeah.

1109
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:35,720
I do this gaming podcast, but I do hosting for, you know, performance shows and things

1110
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:36,720
like that.

1111
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,560
So, you know, it's gaming doesn't have to be your end all be all.

1112
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:44,400
So maybe he'll want to start his own company or maybe he'll want to go to a different industry

1113
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,400
or something.

1114
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:49,440
Or maybe he really just, you know, I don't, I know he asked kids, I don't know how old

1115
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:50,600
they are.

1116
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:54,160
Maybe the kids are old enough to be having their own kids and he wants to be around for

1117
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,160
that.

1118
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,160
Or maybe he just wants to be around more.

1119
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:57,160
You know what?

1120
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,320
Let the man take a fucking vacation.

1121
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,320
He's earned it.

1122
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:00,320
Hats off to you, sir.

1123
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,320
Yeah.

1124
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:06,060
So I think it's just, you know, we, we all know, Oh yeah, this, this has to be something

1125
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:07,060
that happens someday.

1126
00:55:07,060 --> 00:55:12,000
But then when that day a lot arrives, it's like, but why Reggie?

1127
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,040
Don't you love me anymore?

1128
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:19,680
But you know, he, his body is ready for vacation.

1129
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,560
Body is ready for a fucking vacation.

1130
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:22,760
That is absolutely right.

1131
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,340
Let the man live.

1132
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:29,480
So yeah, we can just hope he set a great example for everybody Gil, cause not every CEO in

1133
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:34,800
the game industry is looked at with such a favor and fandom as somebody like Reggie visa

1134
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:35,800
may.

1135
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:39,080
Um, cause can you imagine what it's going to be like when Bobby Kotek retires?

1136
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:42,740
Yeah, it's going to be great.

1137
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:43,740
He's never going to retire though.

1138
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:46,780
Cause he's making tons of fucking money.

1139
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:51,580
So anyway, he has to drive the rest of the properties into the ground, which honestly

1140
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:55,820
with Activision, there's not a lot left.

1141
00:55:55,820 --> 00:56:01,180
Uh, DJ Rama S points out Pepsi and BET as the 200 Matt says he worked for pizza hut

1142
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:02,180
and Guinness.

1143
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:05,000
Did he really work all those places or you guys just make us, are you guys just saying

1144
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,660
all the cool things is PepsiCo and yum foods or whatever.

1145
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:09,660
That's all like one.

1146
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:10,660
Oh yeah, that's right.

1147
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:11,660
Pepsi owns all that stuff.

1148
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:12,660
That makes sense.

1149
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:14,580
Cool.

1150
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:18,460
All right, well, uh, hats off to Reggie and a best of luck, uh, in the future.

1151
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:22,780
And uh, you know, other CEOs should take some cues from Reggie on how to be cool.

1152
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:23,780
Super cool.

1153
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:24,780
Let's move on.

1154
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:25,780
What do you have for us next?

1155
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:26,780
Logie.

1156
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:27,780
All right.

1157
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:32,980
So, um, there's this whole new kind of beginning of another adpocalypse type thing.

1158
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:39,940
This was, um, due to this guy named Matt Watson who put out a viral video on YouTube, basically

1159
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:43,100
explaining that there's this content out there.

1160
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:48,500
It's of like kids like posting videos either like, um, you know, doing like gymnastics

1161
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:49,500
or something like that.

1162
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:55,980
And of course with that, there's these kind of pedo, uh, people that are watching these

1163
00:56:55,980 --> 00:57:01,920
videos and timestamping, you know, compromising positions and just being generally assholes.

1164
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:07,520
And then of course those people also re uploading this content and sharing similar content with

1165
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:08,520
each other.

1166
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:14,120
So he's kind of like, Oh, exposing this, you know, whole, um, ring of stuff going on.

1167
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:20,800
And of course, you know, he's been also mailing out to, uh, or, you know, going on social

1168
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:26,600
media to show all these people that had like, um, ads run in front of it, the, Hey, look

1169
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:30,040
at this contents on here and YouTube's not doing anything, even though they are sort

1170
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:35,280
of work, you know, to get rid of it and doing it in the worst possible way as well.

1171
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,600
Um, so yeah, I got it.

1172
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:42,760
Well, I got to admit it's a tricky, it's a tricky thing because like, well, and I'm,

1173
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:45,760
I have not been reading up in the story, but like, you know, if you want to put your kids

1174
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,800
gymnastic match on YouTube, you should be able to do that right.

1175
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:55,000
And any sane person that, well, here's the problem, you know, so here's the YouTube solution

1176
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,940
by the way, and you're going to love this.

1177
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:02,960
So YouTube solution to solve this problem because they can't really figure it out is

1178
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,220
your video now can be demonetized.

1179
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:10,120
You could be following all of the rules completely by the book.

1180
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:14,580
Everything is a okay with your video, but if you have ass hats that are posting sicko

1181
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:19,420
shit in your, uh, YouTube comments, your video is going to get demonetized.

1182
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:22,020
No that can't be abused in any sort of fucking way.

1183
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:24,900
What, what's happening to the sickos posting the comments?

1184
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:29,940
Well, they're going to try to ban them, but at the same time, anybody can, well, they

1185
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:32,340
could recreate accounts and stuff.

1186
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:33,680
I mean, so I don't know.

1187
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:38,320
You could, you could basically use this new method now to just attack any channel you

1188
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:42,760
want to demonetize all their videos or to possibly, you know, do all sorts of strikes

1189
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:43,900
or whatever.

1190
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:46,320
So there's that fun bit of information.

1191
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,480
So that's their plan right now, which is terrible.

1192
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:54,760
Um, and then on top of that, all sorts of advertisers are pulling their ads from YouTube

1193
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:58,640
right now because I swear if you are one of these, not that anybody, any of those people

1194
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:02,840
would ever be watching this and thank God, but for those people that are doing this type

1195
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:07,840
of just sick shit and you know, some of them are doing it because it's sick and they're

1196
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:08,840
sick.

1197
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:11,220
Some of them are doing it for the lols.

1198
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:15,400
That isn't fucking funny and you deserve to have your computer swapped into submission

1199
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,280
with a baseball bat over and over again.

1200
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:21,440
If you are participating in this garbage, this is just, it's gross.

1201
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:26,480
It's kind of, okay, so let's, let's talk weaponizing it to get at people and stuff is great.

1202
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:27,480
Yeah.

1203
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:28,480
How does it have to do with games by the way?

1204
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:29,480
Well, we're getting there.

1205
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:32,800
So like there's been several, several companies, something that has nothing to do with games.

1206
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:33,760
Yeah.

1207
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:38,240
So several companies have already pulled their ads from YouTube, including like Disney.

1208
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:44,080
One of them, of course, Epic games have pulled their ads and those of course mostly ads for

1209
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:49,080
Fortnite and so they have pulled it because they're in talks right now with YouTube to

1210
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:55,680
see if they can, what's YouTube doing to fix this algorithm problem that they have with

1211
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:59,440
basically, if you do find these videos and you click on a couple of them, that's all

1212
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,600
you get in your feed is these like videos.

1213
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:07,720
It makes it very easy for somebody to find that content.

1214
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:09,920
So right now they're trying to figure out what they can do.

1215
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:15,560
They've banned, YouTube's banned channels, they've, you know, um, demonetized other channels,

1216
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:16,920
reported some things to the police.

1217
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:18,920
They said, um, I have an idea.

1218
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:19,920
I have an idea.

1219
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:20,920
I know how to fix it.

1220
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:21,920
I know how to fix it.

1221
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:22,920
Ready?

1222
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:23,920
Ready?

1223
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:24,920
Delete the comments.

1224
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:25,920
Done.

1225
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:26,920
Problem solved.

1226
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:27,920
Delete the comments, YouTube.

1227
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:28,920
Delete them.

1228
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:29,920
We don't know.

1229
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:30,920
What good are YouTube comments doing?

1230
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:37,800
It is showing, um, I guess, what was it?

1231
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:44,980
It's showing what they call it, um, I don't remember what it's called.

1232
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:50,320
It's showing how many viewers are actually interacting with the content creators on there.

1233
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:56,320
And it's, um, it's for a way to monetize or basically show that this person is getting

1234
01:00:56,320 --> 01:01:03,440
more, um, like, I guess, focused views on their content or view thumbs up button would

1235
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:04,440
be fine.

1236
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:05,440
Subscriptions are fine.

1237
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:10,160
Uh, a system like biddies where you could tip your favorite people would be fine.

1238
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:11,400
All of that would be fine.

1239
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:12,580
Why do we need comments?

1240
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:17,320
We don't need comments, or better yet, just like if you have a way to see which comments

1241
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:20,320
are like bad, why don't you just delete those comments?

1242
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:24,160
Let content creators screen all their comments before they go up.

1243
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,280
Is that a thing YouTube can do?

1244
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,640
I'm pretty sure you can maybe...

1245
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:28,640
Can you?

1246
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:30,760
I don't know if you can disable stuff.

1247
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,200
Can you just make it moderate?

1248
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:34,200
Everything's moderated.

1249
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:35,280
I don't know, but whatever.

1250
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:38,040
It's gonna be worse before it gets better.

1251
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:42,240
The ironic part about this, though, is the guy who actually posted this, um...

1252
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,240
Wait, I gotta read this comment.

1253
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:45,240
Yeah.

1254
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:48,920
Uh, Metonius Games in chat says, comments are profitable to YouTube, but they will also

1255
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:50,280
punish channels for it.

1256
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:55,180
Well, that just goes to show YouTube would far punish the creators than publish to people

1257
01:01:55,180 --> 01:01:56,780
actually causing the problem.

1258
01:01:56,780 --> 01:02:00,700
Bobby in chat says, why do we need a chat room for this show?

1259
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:06,180
Um, great question, but I, because I love having the live chat and the interaction with

1260
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:11,160
people and so forth, but I will not hesitate for a moment to ban your ass if you cross

1261
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:12,160
the line.

1262
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:15,700
Hell, I just gave someone a time out for pulling the Smash Mouth stun on me.

1263
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:17,160
So you know what?

1264
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:18,160
I will rain down.

1265
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:23,800
I will rain down with fire upon you a great vengeance if, you know, you bring that garbage

1266
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:24,800
here.

1267
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:28,760
I'd like to give most people the benefit of the doubt, but we have a lot of control over

1268
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:29,760
moderation.

1269
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:34,280
And if I'm not looking, Bobby Banhammer Black Wolf's looking and he won't hesitate to ban

1270
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:35,280
that stuff.

1271
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:36,960
And there's several other mods in there as well.

1272
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:40,920
Well, the thing is too, okay, so like this is kind of the ironic part of it.

1273
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:47,840
So, um, this Matt Watson guy, he's basically going out and pointing out this thing, thinking

1274
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:49,280
that he's doing some good.

1275
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:52,820
But I think it's actually for, he's trying to get his 15 minutes of fame.

1276
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:55,660
He was an ex YouTuber.

1277
01:02:55,660 --> 01:02:58,660
So he started a new channel, posted this stuff.

1278
01:02:58,660 --> 01:03:03,500
People found his old channel and he has questionable shit on there, including, I don't know if

1279
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:07,460
it's a skit or something, but it's basically him.

1280
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:11,380
I don't know, doing it for the lols, asking people if they would like to be in an adult

1281
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:12,660
video with him.

1282
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:19,120
And there's one shows him driving in a car, talking to a school aged child saying, hey,

1283
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:21,820
you want to be in an adult video with me?

1284
01:03:21,820 --> 01:03:23,940
Just ridiculous stuff.

1285
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:29,220
So this is, this is the fun stuff that we get to deal with.

1286
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:30,220
Delete YouTube!

1287
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:31,220
Just delete it!

1288
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:32,220
Delete YouTube!

1289
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:33,220
Delete the whole site!

1290
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:37,220
Burn it to the ground!

1291
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:39,900
Yes, that is one way to do it.

1292
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:41,320
Burn it with fire.

1293
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:46,040
I just think the whole thing is, between this and like, you know, even earlier this week

1294
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:51,140
we had a thing with The Verge where, you know, they were content striking people because

1295
01:03:51,140 --> 01:03:54,180
they didn't like what someone was seeing in a video like that.

1296
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:58,940
You know, between abuses that are with the DMCA service, between now the way that people

1297
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:04,420
can harass or even destroy YouTube channels by, with harassing comments, because I know

1298
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:09,020
we have certain listeners, Xtifer for example, posting constantly on Twitter about all these

1299
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:14,080
hateful comments he gets on his videos, and that kind of stuff right there, that would

1300
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:18,140
demonetize his channel even if he's not doing anything wrong because of all the hateful

1301
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:22,500
comments that are, it's like, it's the whole platform is messed up.

1302
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:27,300
So sorry, but important, I'm doing my finger wag because I have something important to

1303
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:28,300
say.

1304
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:29,300
Okay, ready?

1305
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:30,300
Okay.

1306
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:31,300
Didn't we just have a story?

1307
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:32,300
Well, hold on, hold on.

1308
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:33,300
I got to check.

1309
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:34,300
Hold on.

1310
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:35,300
We got to go.

1311
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:36,300
I need to scroll up one.

1312
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:37,300
We got to scroll up.

1313
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:38,300
Then I hit the button.

1314
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:39,300
Okay.

1315
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:40,300
Do we not just have a story?

1316
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:41,820
Google is about to be a GDC, right?

1317
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:42,820
We did.

1318
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:43,820
We did just talk about that, right?

1319
01:04:43,820 --> 01:04:44,820
Yes.

1320
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:45,820
Google owns YouTube, right?

1321
01:04:45,820 --> 01:04:46,820
Well, yeah.

1322
01:04:46,820 --> 01:04:51,260
Is somebody going to be asking Google, like, if you can't run a functioning video website

1323
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:57,180
and moderate your shit, why were you going to trust you with a gaming console?

1324
01:04:57,180 --> 01:05:00,060
I mean, what's it going to happen if they're going to have a storefront that they're not

1325
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:01,060
going to monitor?

1326
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:02,060
What?

1327
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:07,060
Then they're going to be Steam?

1328
01:05:07,060 --> 01:05:13,180
So, anyways, so let's talk a little bit more about Fortnite though instead of YouTube.

1329
01:05:13,180 --> 01:05:15,380
We'll switch topics here a little bit.

1330
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:20,260
So Fortnite had this, they had this event called Fortnite Live.

1331
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:21,260
Wait, sorry.

1332
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:24,100
I just want to read, because when there are good comments, I read them on air.

1333
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:26,180
That's another way you reinforce positivity, right?

1334
01:05:26,180 --> 01:05:27,180
Right.

1335
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:28,260
You read the good stuff on air.

1336
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:32,020
Not to say that everything I don't read is bad, but just, you know, reinforcing the good

1337
01:05:32,020 --> 01:05:33,020
stuff.

1338
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:37,700
So Karts1 in our chat says, YouTube needs to put more pressure on creators to maintain

1339
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:39,600
a healthy comment community.

1340
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:44,820
It's so easy to set word filters and appoint other viewers to update said word filter delete

1341
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:46,100
toxic comments.

1342
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:51,040
So yeah, I think there has to be some type of onus on the content creators to foster

1343
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:52,620
a positive community.

1344
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:57,300
However, as you pointed out, the way things are working at YouTube right now, like YouTube

1345
01:05:57,300 --> 01:06:01,180
is also like blaming the content creators for all this.

1346
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:05,420
And it's also though, I don't know if they can really control it because some of these

1347
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:11,660
they're posting, like say for example, the one example they had is that their kid was,

1348
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:16,100
they're posting videos of his gymnastics stuff online, which is fine.

1349
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:20,060
You know, you can post videos of your kids online doing gymnastics, whatever that should

1350
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:21,240
be fine.

1351
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:25,820
But then people were making comments on that stuff and that's not, I mean, that's bad enough.

1352
01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:30,040
But then other times they were finding when they dug into the comments, you know, like

1353
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:33,940
looking at these users and where they're commenting and stuff like that, they found that they're

1354
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:39,020
taking these videos, downloading them, re uploading them on their own channels and like

1355
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:40,740
talking about that shit elsewhere.

1356
01:06:40,740 --> 01:06:44,860
So you're not even getting to the point where they can even monitor the comments that are

1357
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:47,820
on that video because it's being re uploaded and commented.

1358
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:52,140
Mom and dad who shot that video should be able to sue those other, but not that I'm

1359
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:57,220
all for like a sue happy America, but there ought to be some type of way you can go after

1360
01:06:57,220 --> 01:07:00,340
that troll that steals that video.

1361
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:02,660
And of course, I guess, I don't know.

1362
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:03,660
I know.

1363
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:07,700
And now as I'm thinking through it in my head, they're going to be like, it's parody.

1364
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:11,900
It's done for parody and you put it on the Internet and I don't know.

1365
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:14,340
It's complicated, I guess.

1366
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:18,860
But just people need to fucking behave themselves online is so gross anyway.

1367
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:19,860
So anyways, more Fortnite.

1368
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:20,860
Yeah.

1369
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:26,660
So we're talking about Fortnite Live, which was an event that they held in Norwich.

1370
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:31,420
They were advertising it as the ultimate Fortnite battle royale.

1371
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:38,620
Apparently that they were selling tickets for between 12 and 20 pounds and they had

1372
01:07:38,620 --> 01:07:42,300
just about 3000 kids show up.

1373
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:49,660
But apparently there was a lot of like misorganization.

1374
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:53,480
They described it as basically saying it was a terrible disaster.

1375
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:55,860
It was terrible and absolute disaster.

1376
01:07:55,860 --> 01:07:56,860
Not like advertise.

1377
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:59,780
We went for the early bird, but some stuff was even set up.

1378
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:02,540
The best part about it was the event was the burger I had.

1379
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:04,180
My son wanted to leave.

1380
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:09,260
And as an organizer saying it went well, one absolute joke.

1381
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:10,260
It was awful.

1382
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:12,340
I have a very disappointed child.

1383
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:13,340
Yeah.

1384
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:20,460
And they're saying that there was some sort of like like merch that was just it was the

1385
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:21,460
Fyre Festival.

1386
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:25,680
Yeah, it was Gartner Festival Fortnite garbage and nobody learned anything from those documentaries.

1387
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:30,520
And basically because it was garbage and because they were using the Fortnite name,

1388
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:34,900
Epic doesn't want to be at all associated with it.

1389
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:39,240
So they, of course, are going to be suing the organizers of this event.

1390
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:42,680
They said the quality of our player experience is incredibly important to us.

1391
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:48,680
And whether it's inside the game or an official public event like Fortnite Pro-Am, Epic Games

1392
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:52,240
was not in any way associated with the event that took place in Norwich.

1393
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:57,800
And we've issued a claim against the organization in the High Court of London.

1394
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:04,000
The proceedings by Epic Games, of course, you know, this is regarding their response.

1395
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,300
Very important question about the convention from our chat comment of the night here from

1396
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:09,900
Crystal Skies 80.

1397
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:12,020
Did it have a ball pit?

1398
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:13,560
I don't think it had a ball pit.

1399
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:14,560
Sorry.

1400
01:09:14,560 --> 01:09:17,360
No wonder you got your ass in court.

1401
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:21,880
Extra time in the ball pit.

1402
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:28,600
They're saying, you know, the so Epic Games, you know, that has forced the shutdown to

1403
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:32,220
prebooked future Fortnite live events.

1404
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:37,960
These proceedings by Epic Games has had a catastrophic impact on the company's ability

1405
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:46,800
to trade, which has forced exciting events limited to cease all trading activities immediately.

1406
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:51,400
And now they're seeking to limit the losses to third parties as soon as possible.

1407
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:55,420
Well, boohoo, maybe you don't use someone else's intellectual property for a shitty

1408
01:09:55,420 --> 01:09:56,420
ass event.

1409
01:09:56,420 --> 01:10:00,440
Yeah, I think Epic is kind of in the right here to, you know, say, hey, don't put your

1410
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:01,440
name.

1411
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:04,440
I mean, it's one thing if you're like a gaming celebration festival and you just heavily

1412
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:05,440
feature Fortnite.

1413
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:06,840
We get some of those like around here, too.

1414
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:11,180
There's like not a Minecon event, but it's like a Minecraft event.

1415
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:13,820
And it's just kind of put together by other people.

1416
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:16,720
They also do like some like Lego events and stuff like that.

1417
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:17,720
That's not officially Lego.

1418
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:19,880
But I don't think any of those events are this bad.

1419
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:20,880
No.

1420
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:22,360
It's I think I knew people.

1421
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:23,360
It's also smaller.

1422
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,400
I think I know people that went to Minecraft when they had a good time, actually.

1423
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:27,080
So a little different.

1424
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:29,800
So but this is a little bit different with Fortnite and stuff.

1425
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:30,800
Yeah.

1426
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:31,800
Mm hmm.

1427
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:32,800
All right.

1428
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:33,800
Oh, OK.

1429
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:37,560
I need to cleanse the palate after some of those stories we just talked about because

1430
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:38,920
it was a little bit upsetting.

1431
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:40,860
So how about some rumors?

1432
01:10:40,860 --> 01:10:45,520
How about we get into some rumors about, oh, look, here's the thing.

1433
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:46,880
I know how y'all feel about rumors.

1434
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,520
Some of you hate them.

1435
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:53,120
But this is also a show to talk about what people are talking about around the table

1436
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:55,000
this week in gaming.

1437
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,360
And this is this is on fire on social media.

1438
01:10:58,360 --> 01:10:59,960
Is this rumor?

1439
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:05,920
And it has to do with a rumor about regular meetings being held between Nintendo and the

1440
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:13,000
Xbox team, which could culminate with Ori and the Blind Forest, as well as the sequel,

1441
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
The Wisping Woods or whatever that the ones called.

1442
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,000
Sorry.

1443
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:23,320
Cuphead, Game Pass and X Cloud coming to the Nintendo Switch later in the year.

1444
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:29,000
This is coming from a large gaming Web site in France, which is talking about all these

1445
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
leaks.

1446
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
What would Game Pass entail though?

1447
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,240
Like, I don't understand if they're not going to be games on the platform.

1448
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:36,240
What would that entail?

1449
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:37,240
It's streaming.

1450
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:42,280
If you're streaming the games through, do you stream with Game Pass or is it all downloads?

1451
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:45,280
There's two different systems on Microsoft.

1452
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:46,560
One of them is the streaming.

1453
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:48,960
One of them is the download on demand.

1454
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:53,560
So with the streaming one, I thought that was all game probably butchering this all

1455
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:54,560
right now.

1456
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:55,560
Well, you know what?

1457
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:56,560
Let's figure it out.

1458
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:57,560
Can't you Google it?

1459
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:58,640
Google it while we read this story.

1460
01:11:58,640 --> 01:11:59,640
You answer your own damn question.

1461
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:01,640
You don't want to answer my own.

1462
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:05,640
OK, well, I know we butchered it on a show before and we got an email about it.

1463
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:08,240
So I feel some type of onus to get it right this time.

1464
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:10,680
So anyway, apparently the rumor goes on.

1465
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:14,920
There were several meetings in Redmond regarding the partnership or in the Blind Forest and

1466
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:20,680
Cuphead coming to the switch, which I mean, that makes a lot of sense, right?

1467
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:26,560
More than 100 Xbox games via Game Pass and or X Cloud before the end of the year.

1468
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:29,920
So I guess there's two things going on there.

1469
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:30,920
Yeah.

1470
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:31,920
You download the games.

1471
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:32,920
OK.

1472
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:33,920
OK.

1473
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:34,920
Well, maybe it wouldn't be like all the games.

1474
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:38,140
So maybe like Xbox 360 games, if they are, they already kind of like built this emulator

1475
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:39,140
thing.

1476
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:40,140
Maybe that would work.

1477
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:41,140
I don't know.

1478
01:12:41,140 --> 01:12:44,300
Rare games possibly coming to the switch and so on and so on.

1479
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:47,020
You get where this is going.

1480
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:51,340
And going to chat over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network.

1481
01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:52,340
Let's see.

1482
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:56,760
Miltonius Games says the Xbox app on switch is making much more sense.

1483
01:12:56,760 --> 01:13:00,420
She Hulk says streaming is not up and running yet.

1484
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:03,260
So that must be what this X Cloud thing is all about.

1485
01:13:03,260 --> 01:13:08,140
And so it would make a lot of sense that that would be the thing that would exist on the

1486
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:09,180
Nintendo switch.

1487
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:13,700
And maybe some people, like we're doing, are calling that Game Pass because they just assume

1488
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:14,700
it's kind of like the same.

1489
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:19,100
So is the X Cloud thing where I play like I can stream to my system?

1490
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:21,100
I believe that's what it's for.

1491
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:22,100
Right.

1492
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:24,860
No, like stream any game like on the Internet.

1493
01:13:24,860 --> 01:13:30,060
And the switch does this with things like Assassin's Creed Odyssey and the Resident

1494
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:31,060
Evil 7.

1495
01:13:31,060 --> 01:13:32,060
Yeah.

1496
01:13:32,060 --> 01:13:33,060
Right.

1497
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:34,060
In Japan.

1498
01:13:34,060 --> 01:13:37,380
It wasn't Xbox related, but it was Japan had that switch where it was all based on streaming.

1499
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:42,940
So maybe Microsoft saw that and was kind of like, hey, you know, and there's there's a

1500
01:13:42,940 --> 01:13:49,020
lot about this that just like, I mean, it's a lot of fanwank, but it's also like, damn,

1501
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:51,180
this would be a good partnership.

1502
01:13:51,180 --> 01:13:56,500
I mean, there's been fanwank for years about Nintendo and Microsoft getting in bed together.

1503
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:57,500
Part of what makes this.

1504
01:13:57,500 --> 01:14:02,140
Can you imagine if we go one way, can we go the other way and get some Nintendo games

1505
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:04,220
on Xbox one?

1506
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:05,220
Who knows?

1507
01:14:05,220 --> 01:14:06,220
Who knows?

1508
01:14:06,220 --> 01:14:07,740
But I would sell me an Xbox one.

1509
01:14:07,740 --> 01:14:08,780
I will say this.

1510
01:14:08,780 --> 01:14:13,440
There are some things that make sense about it, because as you see that Microsoft is trying

1511
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:18,780
to push themselves beyond just a company you think about with game hardware and Xbox and

1512
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:22,100
so forth, we've even talked about this on the show just a couple of weeks ago where

1513
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:25,700
there were some comments about how Microsoft's really trying to just grow into the whole

1514
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:32,380
like gaming system, gaming ecosystem where, you know, you've got this cloud and Microsoft

1515
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:36,440
wants to be Netflix for games again, going into what we just talked about at the very

1516
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:40,480
beginning of the show, Microsoft kind of sees this coming and they want to be Netflix

1517
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:41,480
for games.

1518
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:46,640
And what better person to team up with than the person that can't seem to figure out online

1519
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,640
and say, we'll deliver it all to you.

1520
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:49,640
And you know what?

1521
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:52,240
We're not, we're not going to be putting out a handheld and that's probably part of their

1522
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:56,760
agreement or whatever is that Xbox would not put out a handheld ever.

1523
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:59,960
And that is, you know, something that, you know, maybe is on the table.

1524
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:00,960
I don't know.

1525
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:06,380
Or this is just all fanwank that culminates in nothing, but damn, would this be like an

1526
01:15:06,380 --> 01:15:10,740
industry changing thing, especially with E3 being this year.

1527
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:15,220
Think about who's not at E3 this year and who are the big gaming companies that will

1528
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:16,220
be at E3 this year.

1529
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:17,220
Oh my God.

1530
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:18,220
That'd be amazing.

1531
01:15:18,220 --> 01:15:20,260
I mean, they would be able to dominate the conversation.

1532
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:23,380
They would be the entirety of the conversation if this happened.

1533
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:26,220
It would be a, it would really be something else.

1534
01:15:26,220 --> 01:15:30,580
Microsoft has struggled to get an audience in Japan for a long time.

1535
01:15:30,580 --> 01:15:34,540
I mean, and so you might be looking at like, well, who's going to buy Ori and the Blind

1536
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:35,900
Forest and Cuphead at this point?

1537
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:38,980
Those games are years old, um, Japan.

1538
01:15:38,980 --> 01:15:43,860
I bet there would be a big audience that would like to check out Cuphead or if they can port

1539
01:15:43,860 --> 01:15:44,860
it to the switch.

1540
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:47,220
Um, yeah, you know, that would be awesome.

1541
01:15:47,220 --> 01:15:51,100
Although I'm surprised that the Cuphead's not really an Xbox game.

1542
01:15:51,100 --> 01:15:53,320
That's just a, it's a PC title.

1543
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:57,140
So I mean, I would think that that would be independent of Microsoft.

1544
01:15:57,140 --> 01:16:01,500
VG realness says, um, I would absolutely would love for Microsoft to take over Nintendo's

1545
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:05,780
online, but I just can't see the Japanese arm getting in bed with the U S company.

1546
01:16:05,780 --> 01:16:06,780
And I don't either.

1547
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:11,540
And I don't necessarily, you know, a lot of that, that I said before is mostly for hyperbole

1548
01:16:11,540 --> 01:16:15,340
because I think what it really comes down to, it's going to be more like a strategic

1549
01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:16,480
partnership.

1550
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:20,080
Think about how Minecraft is on the switch right now.

1551
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:24,900
That's a Microsoft thing that they're putting on the switch and the switch is able to use

1552
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:25,900
that as well.

1553
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:29,980
Nintendo can kind of use Microsoft as a way to swell, sell more switches because, Hey,

1554
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:32,100
we can do Mike Minecraft on the go.

1555
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:33,860
That is a strategic partnership.

1556
01:16:33,860 --> 01:16:39,980
I don't see in this scenario, Microsoft taking over Nintendo or Nintendo taking over Microsoft

1557
01:16:39,980 --> 01:16:40,980
or anything like that.

1558
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:41,980
That's not what we're talking about.

1559
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:45,980
We're talking about a strategic partnership where now Microsoft can kind of get some of

1560
01:16:45,980 --> 01:16:49,460
their games, especially in front of a Japanese audience.

1561
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:56,620
And then on the flip side, uh, you know, Nintendo, uh, has ways to say, now we have all these

1562
01:16:56,620 --> 01:17:01,920
new libraries of games that are accessible and playable that are on the switch.

1563
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:06,240
But I don't think it goes to Nintendo making games for Xbox.

1564
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:11,060
That's too far because Nintendo is still in the, in the habit of, we need to sell consoles.

1565
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:12,280
We need to sell this hardware.

1566
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:16,900
And the best way we do it is through our own titles that, you know, we are one of the best

1567
01:17:16,900 --> 01:17:18,460
games in the business.

1568
01:17:18,460 --> 01:17:23,020
But think about it though, like you could still do that and like just offer your titles

1569
01:17:23,020 --> 01:17:28,940
for sale if, you know, cause they don't ever drop in price for sale through like a download

1570
01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:34,900
service on, you know, like a Nintendo eShop app on the Xbox one or something like that

1571
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,620
where you can download stuff.

1572
01:17:36,620 --> 01:17:40,820
It would still be like through the Nintendo store and you're just playing it, stream it

1573
01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:42,340
to that console or something.

1574
01:17:42,340 --> 01:17:43,340
I don't know.

1575
01:17:43,340 --> 01:17:46,420
I just don't see why they couldn't go both ways, but who cares?

1576
01:17:46,420 --> 01:17:50,000
I've even finally just game pass being on the switch.

1577
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:55,360
And so the rumors don't stop there because Game Informer Senior Editor Imran Khan, I

1578
01:17:55,360 --> 01:18:00,280
hope I said the name right, sorry, chimed in as well with this on a podcast that he's

1579
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:01,280
a part of.

1580
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:03,600
Oh, those podcasts breaking news.

1581
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:09,160
He said, there's a game that's thought to be dead that Nintendo is reviving and it's

1582
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:11,480
not one that people would expect.

1583
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:15,480
It was very much a title that was dead and buried, very officially canceled.

1584
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:20,160
I've heard enough about this game that he's almost sure that it exists again.

1585
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:24,200
And some people connecting the dots believe that that game is scale bound.

1586
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:25,200
Yeah.

1587
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,000
Um, don't know.

1588
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,600
And then, but then right along with that, uh, I believe there was a rumor that kind

1589
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:36,680
of follows that up to say, eh, probably not, it might not actually be that that's, that's

1590
01:18:36,680 --> 01:18:37,680
what's going on.

1591
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:41,000
So, you know, take that with a big grain of salt.

1592
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,960
Um, but it's sure interesting in it.

1593
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:44,960
Yeah.

1594
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:47,720
I wouldn't, I don't know about scale bound.

1595
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:50,200
It was all right looking.

1596
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:53,880
I'd be in, well, scale bound to, if I remember right, scale bound, they originally conceived

1597
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:54,880
for the wheat.

1598
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:59,720
So, you know, Hey, Nintendo, I thought it was the X-Box three, six, it was originally

1599
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:03,640
conceived of the Wii and the Microsoft, you know, that whole partnership kind of worked

1600
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:07,200
with platinum games to bring it over there and then it didn't work out for whatever reason.

1601
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:09,720
So it would be very interesting if it does get a life.

1602
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:14,920
I mean, again, I think a lot of that is kind of like fanboy dreams, but you know, um, Nintendo

1603
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:20,320
bringing back a franchise thought dead is not exactly unheard of Bayonetta.

1604
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:25,320
So except Bayonetta happened kind of like a lot faster, but you know, again, have, have

1605
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:28,360
we yet to see Bayonetta two show up on any other console?

1606
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:29,360
Nope.

1607
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:31,360
Not going to happen because Nintendo saved it.

1608
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:38,720
So anyway, we'll see, I, you know, E3 could be very interesting this year.

1609
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:44,000
Obviously it's a, it's rumors, huge grain of salt, but boy, is it fun to think about

1610
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,000
the possibilities.

1611
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Isn't it?

1612
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Yes.

1613
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Yeah, sure thing.

1614
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Uh, over in our Twitch chat room, uh, at VOG network, uh, she Hulk thinks that Microsoft

1615
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:57,000
will give Nintendo a piece of the sales, uh, VG realness chimes in.

1616
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,240
Nintendo will never put their games on another console.

1617
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:06,080
And I, I believe that just as heavy as it's written in the chat, Nintendo is that Nintendo

1618
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:09,960
would be dead or selling to somebody else before that happens.

1619
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:11,760
And they're not, they're not hurting right now.

1620
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:17,200
I wouldn't say never though, because we probably, one time we thought, okay, in 20 Sonic will

1621
01:20:17,200 --> 01:20:18,840
never appear on a Nintendo console.

1622
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:19,840
Okay.

1623
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:20,840
But we're talking like 20 years.

1624
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:24,560
We're talking like an entirely different industry than what we're in now.

1625
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:29,320
One where Nintendo has flopped so hard, it ruined them and not even the Wii U did that.

1626
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:32,320
So I just don't see it happening anytime soon.

1627
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:33,320
That's for sure.

1628
01:20:33,320 --> 01:20:34,320
Um, interesting.

1629
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:35,880
Interesting.

1630
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:41,200
Um, Miltonius Games says everybody and nobody wants Scalebound on their console, apparently.

1631
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:47,360
Well, you know, I, Hey, as long as the game is good, bring it on, you know, and I'm all

1632
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:50,600
for a variety of experiences on the Switch.

1633
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:54,280
You know, Nintendo has their wheelhouse very well covered.

1634
01:20:54,280 --> 01:21:00,680
Nintendo makes Nintendo games very well, but if they can get other types of games, hardcore

1635
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:05,680
games, if you will, and so forth on their platform, it stands to do even better.

1636
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:06,680
Shit.

1637
01:21:06,680 --> 01:21:07,680
Look at Fortnite, right?

1638
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:11,800
Fortnite was not always the type of game you'd expect to see on a Nintendo console, but where

1639
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:13,960
is something like Fortnite thriving?

1640
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:14,960
Nintendo Switch.

1641
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:15,960
Yeah.

1642
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:21,680
This is why everybody's like Apex Legends on Switch when, which by the way, Apex Legends

1643
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:24,040
has some really low graphics settings in it.

1644
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:28,560
So I'm kinda, it doesn't seem like the hardware would be the issue with bringing something

1645
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:29,840
like that to the Switch.

1646
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:31,040
What do I know?

1647
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:33,240
I'm just some dude with a podcast.

1648
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:34,240
Anyway.

1649
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:36,600
All right, let's move on.

1650
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:40,520
We have a few more stories before we get to the classic game of the week.

1651
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:47,080
So Dreams is going to have a special creator early access version of the game that's going

1652
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:55,700
to be coming out this spring for $30 and it says there'll be a strictly limited release.

1653
01:21:55,740 --> 01:22:01,340
It's basically going to allow you to kind of get a full set of the creative tools along

1654
01:22:01,340 --> 01:22:04,380
with tutorials, arcade games and whatnot.

1655
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:09,540
And then they'll be adding more features, tutorials, arcade levels and assets as stuff

1656
01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:14,460
goes along and prioritize all the awesome stuff that they're doing there.

1657
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:20,420
Um, they said the most important, I do it, I probably will do it for 30 bucks for like,

1658
01:22:20,420 --> 01:22:21,480
I'll probably do it.

1659
01:22:21,480 --> 01:22:26,440
I will because like all the things that people are creating with this is crazy and I just

1660
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:28,040
want to get in there and explore.

1661
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:32,800
Like if I feel like this dreams thing is not just like a game, it's, it's going to sneak

1662
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:39,400
up on you because like seriously, when I, when they kept showing dreams and like all

1663
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:42,640
the stuff that they're doing with it during these like presentations, I didn't really

1664
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:43,640
get it.

1665
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:47,660
But then you see what people are making with it, like where they're recreating PT in dreams

1666
01:22:47,660 --> 01:22:53,620
or they're making a first person shooter that looks pretty amazing in dreams.

1667
01:22:53,620 --> 01:22:57,660
I mean it's going to be a pretty amazing thing once it comes out.

1668
01:22:57,660 --> 01:23:02,800
Um, but yeah, they said the most important thing is to know that the dream of verse is

1669
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:09,380
going to form around you so that if it gets you excited, early access is for you.

1670
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:13,860
If you participated in the beta and felt like dreams wasn't fully featured enough for you

1671
01:23:13,860 --> 01:23:19,940
yet or you wanted more media molecule game content, then early access might not be for

1672
01:23:19,940 --> 01:23:20,940
you.

1673
01:23:20,940 --> 01:23:24,340
And then we're working on all those things during this period and we have every, if you

1674
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:28,220
want to pay for a beta, then this is for you.

1675
01:23:28,220 --> 01:23:30,300
I'll do it for 30 bucks or 30 bucks.

1676
01:23:30,300 --> 01:23:35,340
What does it, does it give you the full game as well or does it, is it like, is it $30

1677
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:36,700
towards the full game or something?

1678
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:38,620
I hope that would at least be it.

1679
01:23:38,620 --> 01:23:42,740
Um, it's like you could upgrade this to a full copy of the game for a lot less.

1680
01:23:42,740 --> 01:23:45,260
This eventually becomes a full copy of the game.

1681
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:51,000
Um, I'm not, it doesn't really, $30 seems really low for a game like this unless they

1682
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,740
plan to like charge for the things people create in this game or something.

1683
01:23:54,740 --> 01:23:55,740
Yeah.

1684
01:23:55,740 --> 01:24:01,080
It doesn't really specify that it's going to be, um, upgraded to the full version.

1685
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:07,600
Although if they're keeping constantly adding stuff to it, maybe I, I don't know, it'd still

1686
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:09,740
be worth checking it out though.

1687
01:24:09,740 --> 01:24:10,740
Yeah.

1688
01:24:10,740 --> 01:24:12,700
All right.

1689
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:16,380
Well, um, I, uh, already talked about the scale bound thing.

1690
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:19,540
I kind of threw it in there with the other, uh, Nintendo and Microsoft rumors.

1691
01:24:19,540 --> 01:24:24,740
So I don't think there's a lot else to say on these whispers about, uh, uh, Nintendo

1692
01:24:24,740 --> 01:24:30,160
possibly reviving a canceled game, but I guess let me turn this into a question for everybody

1693
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:34,660
out there in the chat or, um, us here in studio.

1694
01:24:34,660 --> 01:24:40,560
Outside of scale bounds, you know, and that, what would you like to see Nintendo possibly

1695
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:42,860
reinvent or reignite?

1696
01:24:42,860 --> 01:24:50,120
What would you want Nintendo to do to read, read, ignite, I guess an old X-Box game.

1697
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:51,120
Anything really.

1698
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:55,080
Um, do a new cameo or perfect dark.

1699
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:56,360
Oh, perfect dark.

1700
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:57,360
That's a good one.

1701
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:58,360
Yeah.

1702
01:24:58,360 --> 01:24:59,360
It was like some of that stuff.

1703
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:00,360
Yeah.

1704
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:04,040
Cameo had potential I think, but they didn't really do anything with it aside from kind

1705
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:08,560
of, I don't know if people would get excited about a new cameo excited about a new perfect

1706
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:09,560
dark.

1707
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:10,560
Dark would be cool.

1708
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:11,560
Yeah.

1709
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:12,560
It would be very cool.

1710
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:13,560
Cause I was going to say something like golden.

1711
01:25:13,560 --> 01:25:18,520
I, although I've already tried, I know it's already been activated.

1712
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:21,840
It didn't really work out so well, but I think a lot of people are very attached to that

1713
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:22,840
for sure.

1714
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:28,640
Um, looking at chat over at a Twitch TV slash vog network, uh, VG realness says fantasy

1715
01:25:28,640 --> 01:25:30,280
star online.

1716
01:25:30,280 --> 01:25:31,280
Very good choice.

1717
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:33,320
Uh, Oh, perfect dark is a good choice.

1718
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:34,320
Perfect dark.

1719
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:35,320
Zero is trash.

1720
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:36,320
She Hulk.

1721
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:37,320
Oh, I like this answer.

1722
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:38,320
Fable.

1723
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:39,320
All right.

1724
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:41,080
That's a good answer.

1725
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:42,920
That is a really good answer because I think of that.

1726
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:47,320
There was that fable game, the co-op thing that got canceled where that, and that was

1727
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:48,440
very officially canceled.

1728
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:52,040
And maybe that is something that Nintendo could bring fable legends, right?

1729
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:53,600
Maybe that's something Nintendo would, yeah.

1730
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:57,440
They were trying to do also that like, w weren't they also doing, I don't know if it was part

1731
01:25:57,440 --> 01:26:02,160
of the fable universe or not, but they were doing that like game making thing as well.

1732
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:03,960
They didn't really end up being anything.

1733
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:04,960
Yeah.

1734
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:09,160
Um, I don't know if I'd want to see that, but, uh, Frodo swag, his wishes.

1735
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:11,320
Uh, they would remake golden eye the proper way.

1736
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:13,480
The one they tried to remake was garbage.

1737
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:16,640
And did you, Rama asked to just conquer.

1738
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:20,960
I think when we talk about like rare games coming out on switch, that would make a lot

1739
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:21,960
of sense.

1740
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:26,140
If that happens again, I really think people are taking this tiny little like nugget of

1741
01:26:26,140 --> 01:26:30,560
information and like rolling it down a hill and turn it into a snowball.

1742
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:35,240
Let's take a wait and see and pro fusion frenzy.

1743
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:36,520
Let's take out the first one was good.

1744
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:41,040
Let's take a wait and see approach and just, you know, go in with little expectations.

1745
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:45,600
Do not expect this at E3, do not expect Microsoft to come out and say, we're going to be on

1746
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:46,600
the switch.

1747
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:48,240
Do not expect Nintendo to announce in a direct.

1748
01:26:48,240 --> 01:26:51,880
We've revived scale bound because for all we know, Nintendo is going to say we're going

1749
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:53,160
to do a few Jim frenzy.

1750
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:56,160
And so you got to lower those expectations a little bit.

1751
01:26:56,160 --> 01:27:00,000
So anyway, although the intended diffusion, they don't really need to do fusion frenzy

1752
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,200
because it's basically Mario party and it kind of is right.

1753
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:04,680
It's that fusion frenzy was crap.

1754
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:05,680
All right.

1755
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:12,160
Let's take a step back to a simpler time and visit the classic game of the week and maybe

1756
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:16,480
something that needs to be reinvented at another time, another place.

1757
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:24,360
And so we take a step back through time and space and everything else that we can bend

1758
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:27,920
in our will to a journey to the classic game of the week.

1759
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:32,320
And joining us to share the classic game of the week is the one, the only dark Sakura

1760
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:33,520
or Jamie Summers.

1761
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:34,520
Hello.

1762
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:35,520
Hi.

1763
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:37,360
How are you?

1764
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:38,360
I'm all right.

1765
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:39,360
How are you?

1766
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:40,360
I am good.

1767
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:41,360
Yeah.

1768
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:42,360
I'm sad.

1769
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:45,360
It's not a three day weekend like last weekend, but, you know, I'll take it.

1770
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:46,360
It wasn't.

1771
01:27:46,360 --> 01:27:50,360
Well, I guess it was a three day weekend for me because I made it one.

1772
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:51,600
There you go.

1773
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,560
Well, we look forward to having you back in studio next week.

1774
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:55,560
Full time.

1775
01:27:57,560 --> 01:27:58,560
Very soon.

1776
01:27:58,560 --> 01:27:59,560
All right.

1777
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:02,880
Well, one more for the books for this tape stuff.

1778
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:03,880
So how about it?

1779
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:06,400
Let's talk about the classic game of the week.

1780
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:09,800
What did you pick as you ventured into the vault and found a game that you think everybody

1781
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:11,000
should be checking out this week?

1782
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,000
What is it?

1783
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,680
I really wish this wasn't my fault.

1784
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:15,680
It's called Magical Popping.

1785
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:18,680
All right.

1786
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:19,680
Magical Popping.

1787
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:21,680
It came out in 1995.

1788
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:28,000
It only came out for the Super Famicom and it was developed by Full Star and published

1789
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:31,880
by a company called Pack In Video, which later, I think, joined.

1790
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:32,880
Hold on.

1791
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:35,380
I actually have the name of the company they became.

1792
01:28:35,380 --> 01:28:41,880
They became Victor Entertainment and then became Victor Interactive Software.

1793
01:28:41,880 --> 01:28:49,000
So as for Magical Popping, this game is considered one of the rarest Super Famicom titles and

1794
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:55,560
it goes for a lot of money, but also it has a very high piracy rate and with people trying

1795
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:56,560
to sell repros.

1796
01:28:56,560 --> 01:29:00,000
So just, you know, be careful.

1797
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:03,120
If you happen to find one, make sure it's legit.

1798
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:09,600
But this did release on March 10th, 1995 and it's a side-scrolling game.

1799
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:13,800
I was just going to say, if you do find one, put it in an envelope and mail it to Dark

1800
01:29:13,800 --> 01:29:16,800
Sakura, care of OLR Studios.

1801
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:17,800
Yes.

1802
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:20,800
It is a side-scrolling game.

1803
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:26,560
It has six stages total, but the stages are sort of maze-like and non-linear.

1804
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:30,560
You also have no password or state feature, so if you're going to finish it, you need

1805
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:33,920
to sit down and commit.

1806
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:40,760
But basically, you're playing as a princess who lives in a castle that has a magical gem

1807
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:46,600
and the gem is stolen by an invading army and so the princess, you know, not having

1808
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:51,760
any heroes and having a go-get-it personality just does it herself.

1809
01:29:51,760 --> 01:30:00,440
So the game was produced by Wada Yasuhiro, who also went on to work on Harvest Moon in

1810
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:07,720
1995 and had artwork on the box drawn by Akai Takami.

1811
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:15,880
One thing about the voice acting of the game was done by a lady named Ijima Ai, who had

1812
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:19,960
also worked in adult video earlier on in her career.

1813
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:26,880
She's actually one of the few people who this never became a scandal for her, also sadly.

1814
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:35,920
She died of a kidney failure and sepsis, I want to say, in 2010, if I remember correctly,

1815
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:38,280
so she's since gone.

1816
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:45,360
She was a big TV personality for a while after her initial days, but at any rate, this game

1817
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:53,720
has never had a release outside of Japan and never had a release on any other console.

1818
01:30:53,720 --> 01:30:58,320
It was reviewed by Famitsu for a 23 out of 40.

1819
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:05,000
It was compared to the Monster World series that it was sort of an old-fashioned kind

1820
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:11,120
of game and that the game was really difficult because the character's attack was very low,

1821
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:16,160
although the character had great animation.

1822
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:20,160
Some people didn't even think that Ijima's voice was all that good because of the sort

1823
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:25,680
of moe character, yet she has a kind of corny voice.

1824
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:33,280
It was basically considered cute and challenging and people were bad that you couldn't actually

1825
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:35,280
say it in the game.

1826
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:41,680
The intellectual property of the game now belongs to Marvelous Entertainment and it

1827
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:48,800
was listed in 2016 at 100,000 yen sold in the box, without 30,000 yen.

1828
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:58,880
A store in Tokyo in 2017 was selling it for 140,000 yen, which at the time was about $1200.

1829
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:08,480
I think the highest successful bid was 80,000 yen for this game, so 800 bucks, roughly.

1830
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:13,120
So there you go, a game that I probably won't own a copy of any time soon unless someone

1831
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:14,640
really loves me.

1832
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:18,920
I was going to say, that's approaching levels of that Super Mario game we talked about last

1833
01:32:18,920 --> 01:32:21,200
week that sold for $100,000.

1834
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:25,920
I mean, maybe not that high yet, but I'm in condition, who knows?

1835
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:28,560
Yeah, but good luck.

1836
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:31,920
Yeah, this is the type of game, though, since you kept talking about how you can't really

1837
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:36,160
save it or there's no passwords, this is the type of game that would definitely lend itself

1838
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:42,080
to how you leave the power on all night long and just pray that your parents don't come

1839
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:46,240
in or your sibling or whatever doesn't come in and shut it off in the middle of the night.

1840
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:50,400
And it's like, man, my game, man, you ruined it.

1841
01:32:50,400 --> 01:32:52,160
Mm-hmm, for sure.

1842
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:58,000
Now, just to throw this out there, if anyone is not super familiar with pack-in video from

1843
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:04,000
before the day, they also published Moon or Lander, mine speaker for Game Boy.

1844
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,720
They did One Gun Dead heat games for Saturn.

1845
01:33:06,720 --> 01:33:12,600
For Super Framacon, they did Atlas Run, Sunk, Voyager, Magical Pop'n, like I just said.

1846
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:17,120
They did Super Battle Tank 2, Super Solace Hair, Harvest Moon.

1847
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:22,280
And then for Turbo Graphics, the PC Engine, they did the Metal Angel games, Super Metal

1848
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:23,280
Crusher.

1849
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:25,400
They did virtual fishing for Virtual Boy.

1850
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:28,960
And they did a handful of MSX and MSX2 games.

1851
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:37,400
They also developed Burning Soldier for 3DO, Boundary Gate for PC-FX, and then a few other

1852
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:40,840
really only Japanese-only games except for Famicom.

1853
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:45,000
They did Die Hard and Knight Rider and Predator and Rambo.

1854
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
So some 80s movies tie-in.

1855
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Yeah, a few.

1856
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:50,000
So how...

1857
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Go ahead.

1858
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
You were saying?

1859
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
I just said that's it.

1860
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:57,600
Awkward phone delay.

1861
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:03,440
I was just about to ask, since this game is so rare and it's so difficult, how did you

1862
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:04,960
come across this for selection?

1863
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:08,400
Is this just because you kind of know the publisher?

1864
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:12,800
I just came over the game and it's been kind of on my secret want list for a while.

1865
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:16,640
I mean, I had that want list of rare games for a while that have gotten a few things

1866
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:17,900
off of.

1867
01:34:17,900 --> 01:34:21,720
And then a few that had found out, oh, I actually do already own this.

1868
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:28,720
It was around the time I was learning about Panorama Cotton and Dracula X and some of

1869
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:30,720
those types of games.

1870
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:31,720
All right.

1871
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:32,720
Very cool.

1872
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:33,720
Well, there it is.

1873
01:34:33,720 --> 01:34:38,720
Your classic game of the week, Magical Poppin', a very, very rare Super Famicom game.

1874
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:41,720
And again, if you find a copy of that, you can just send it right to our studio.

1875
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:43,720
Please do.

1876
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:46,720
I might even send you a taco.

1877
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:49,720
Real quick before we go back to the show.

1878
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:55,720
I know it's that Sunday night, it's that time, it's award season, it's Oscar season.

1879
01:34:55,720 --> 01:34:58,720
So is there anything, I mean, maybe you don't give a hoot.

1880
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:01,720
I know I'm kind of in that category, but is there anything you're rooting for tonight

1881
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:03,720
at the Oscars?

1882
01:35:03,720 --> 01:35:04,720
Two things.

1883
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:06,720
The tuxedo ball gown is epic.

1884
01:35:06,720 --> 01:35:07,720
Oh, Billy.

1885
01:35:07,720 --> 01:35:08,720
And the second Oscar.

1886
01:35:08,720 --> 01:35:09,720
Yeah.

1887
01:35:09,720 --> 01:35:10,720
Billy Porter.

1888
01:35:10,720 --> 01:35:11,720
Sorry.

1889
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:12,720
Just, yeah, amazing.

1890
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:13,720
Yeah.

1891
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:14,720
And then secondly, I don't know.

1892
01:35:14,720 --> 01:35:18,720
The only Oscar I care about lives in the trash can on Bethany Street.

1893
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:26,720
And so I suppose we end this segment with, and that's why I love trash.

1894
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:27,720
Yeah.

1895
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:28,720
All right.

1896
01:35:28,720 --> 01:35:29,720
Seriously, though.

1897
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:32,720
He was our first, Oscar was our first upcycler, remember?

1898
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:33,720
That's right.

1899
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:37,720
Anyway, it shouldn't end with my final singing.

1900
01:35:37,720 --> 01:35:40,720
What are your final words to the listeners tonight?

1901
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:46,720
That's why I like trash, too.

1902
01:35:46,720 --> 01:35:50,720
I guess we're just big fans of trash here at Orange Lounge Radio.

1903
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:51,720
What can we say?

1904
01:35:51,720 --> 01:35:52,720
Thank you, as always, DarkSagra.

1905
01:35:52,720 --> 01:35:56,720
And we'll see you back in studio next week.

1906
01:35:56,720 --> 01:36:01,720
Meanwhile, let's travel around the internet and touch on a few more stories that we have

1907
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:02,720
not had time to talk about yet.

1908
01:36:02,720 --> 01:36:06,720
I was going to say, speaking to the Oscars, I was very pleased to see that Spider-Man

1909
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:08,720
entered the Spider-Verse 1 best animated film.

1910
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:09,720
Oh, did it?

1911
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:10,720
Okay.

1912
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:11,720
It was up against Wreck-It Ralph, too, right?

1913
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:12,720
Yeah.

1914
01:36:13,720 --> 01:36:17,720
If you've seen Spider-Man, it was easily deserving of that.

1915
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:19,720
A lot of people were fans of that.

1916
01:36:19,720 --> 01:36:21,720
I don't care about the Oscars.

1917
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:22,720
I don't care.

1918
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:25,720
I realize I'm probably the only gay guy on the planet that's going to tell you that,

1919
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:26,720
but I don't care about the Oscars.

1920
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:27,720
I just don't.

1921
01:36:27,720 --> 01:36:28,720
I know.

1922
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:29,720
Who cares what other people think?

1923
01:36:29,720 --> 01:36:32,720
I only cared about it when I worked in the movie industry.

1924
01:36:32,720 --> 01:36:34,720
What does it matter about critics anyway?

1925
01:36:34,720 --> 01:36:38,720
Look at what's going on with Anthem right now, which I've said my piece on Anthem, and

1926
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:41,720
I purposely wasn't going to get into this tonight because I haven't played the full game, so

1927
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:45,720
I really don't have anything to say, but I will point out, you know, it doesn't have

1928
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:47,720
a wonderful score on Metacritic.

1929
01:36:47,720 --> 01:36:52,720
61 is lower than what Mass Effect Andromeda had, right?

1930
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:56,720
But I've got plenty of people on social media and other places that are like,

1931
01:36:56,720 --> 01:36:57,720
I'm having fun.

1932
01:36:57,720 --> 01:36:58,720
I'm having a good time.

1933
01:36:58,720 --> 01:36:59,720
Whatever.

1934
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:00,720
You know?

1935
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:04,720
And I've seen other people that are saying these loading times are garbage.

1936
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:06,720
The game's not even done yet and so forth.

1937
01:37:06,720 --> 01:37:09,720
I'm not going to talk about it because I didn't play it.

1938
01:37:09,720 --> 01:37:10,720
Y'all know why I didn't.

1939
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:11,720
We're done.

1940
01:37:11,720 --> 01:37:17,720
But if people are enjoying it, it shouldn't stop them from enjoying it.

1941
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:23,720
And seeing that it even goes with like Fallout 76, you know, if you're enjoying that game,

1942
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:25,720
more power to you.

1943
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:26,720
It's just, I'm surprised.

1944
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:29,720
You're one of the minority, I guess.

1945
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:30,720
Whatever.

1946
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:36,720
VG Realness in chat says, ooh, bitch, you'll care if Star is Born wins or if Gaga wins

1947
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:37,720
Best Actress.

1948
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:41,720
I would only be excited if Star is Born won because that's more exposure for Willem and

1949
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:43,720
Shangela who are in that movie.

1950
01:37:43,720 --> 01:37:46,720
But I also completely understand why like Roma winning would be very good.

1951
01:37:46,720 --> 01:37:47,720
Was that what it's called?

1952
01:37:47,720 --> 01:37:48,720
Yeah.

1953
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:50,720
Well, that movie, the Netflix, because it's on Netflix.

1954
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:54,720
It's obviously, you know, it's a whole different kind of movie.

1955
01:37:54,720 --> 01:37:55,720
I think best foreign.

1956
01:37:55,720 --> 01:37:56,720
Right.

1957
01:37:56,720 --> 01:37:57,720
Well, that'll win best foreign for sure.

1958
01:37:57,720 --> 01:37:59,720
You don't you'll get anyway.

1959
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:01,720
Or, you know, Black Panther wins.

1960
01:38:01,720 --> 01:38:05,720
That's going to be huge because, you know, it's a Marvel movie that's winning best.

1961
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:06,720
But, you know, so whatever.

1962
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:08,720
Cool.

1963
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:13,720
Gaga won't win Best Actress, though, because Glenn Close, I think it's it's her time.

1964
01:38:13,720 --> 01:38:15,720
And that's honestly like I love Lady Gaga.

1965
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:16,720
She's great.

1966
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:19,720
But like her not winning an Oscar is not going to diminish.

1967
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:20,720
Apparently she did.

1968
01:38:20,720 --> 01:38:21,720
She just won for the song.

1969
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:22,720
Of course.

1970
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:23,720
How is she not going to win that song?

1971
01:38:23,720 --> 01:38:24,720
Give me a break.

1972
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:30,720
But it's it's not going to diminish what an artist she is or how amazing she was in that

1973
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:33,720
movie, whether she does or doesn't take home a gold statue.

1974
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:35,720
Glenn Close is kind of perfect.

1975
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:36,720
Like, come on.

1976
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:39,720
Y'all saw one hundred and one Dalmatians as kids.

1977
01:38:39,720 --> 01:38:40,720
It's Glenn Close's time.

1978
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:41,720
It's fair.

1979
01:38:41,720 --> 01:38:43,720
It's fair.

1980
01:38:43,720 --> 01:38:46,720
She should have won the Oscar for Cruella.

1981
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:49,720
She got nominated for a Globe, if I remember right, for Cruella.

1982
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:52,720
Yeah, because the Globes will nominate anything.

1983
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:53,720
Let's move on.

1984
01:38:53,720 --> 01:38:54,720
Why am I talking about award shows?

1985
01:38:54,720 --> 01:38:55,720
What are you doing?

1986
01:38:55,720 --> 01:38:56,720
I don't know.

1987
01:38:56,720 --> 01:39:00,720
You're the one that went on that rapid fire news.

1988
01:39:00,720 --> 01:39:01,720
All right.

1989
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:07,720
So the entitled goose game, better known as the asshole goose game, it's been delayed.

1990
01:39:07,720 --> 01:39:10,720
So it's going to come out later in 2019 instead of the spring.

1991
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:11,720
That's unfortunate.

1992
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:15,720
So you're going to have to wait a little longer to torture people as a goose.

1993
01:39:15,720 --> 01:39:18,720
But at least it won't lay an egg as a game.

1994
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:20,720
Yes, hopefully.

1995
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:25,720
This was a game that I actually played the game jam version of.

1996
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:29,720
There was a proof of concept called Baba is You.

1997
01:39:29,720 --> 01:39:34,720
And it's kind of a puzzle game with game logic in there.

1998
01:39:34,720 --> 01:39:39,720
So they have, for example, you walk around, you can push things or pick up things.

1999
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:46,720
So you can change, oh, key is you, or baba is open, or something like that.

2000
01:39:46,720 --> 01:39:50,720
And you can change the logic in the game to solve puzzles.

2001
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:51,720
It's pretty clever.

2002
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:52,720
That's a clever concept.

2003
01:39:52,720 --> 01:39:54,720
Using logic gates and logic puzzles.

2004
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:58,720
It's very interesting in how you solve some of the puzzles.

2005
01:39:58,720 --> 01:40:03,720
So they have it coming out now on PC, Mac, and Nintendo Switch March 13th.

2006
01:40:03,720 --> 01:40:05,720
So that's actually going to be a full game pretty soon.

2007
01:40:05,720 --> 01:40:08,720
So pretty awesome to see that's coming out of there.

2008
01:40:08,720 --> 01:40:15,720
And this one had me very excited because I loved this game when I first saw it back at Sac Indie Arcade.

2009
01:40:15,720 --> 01:40:18,720
It is a local dev that's putting this out.

2010
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:21,720
It's a game called Black Future 88.

2011
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:28,720
And it's just this really cool cyberpunk 2D action roguelike shooter game.

2012
01:40:28,720 --> 01:40:34,720
And it's going to be coming out on PC and Nintendo Switch as well pretty soon.

2013
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:37,720
We should reach out and try to get them on the show if they're here.

2014
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:38,720
Yes. Very awesome.

2015
01:40:38,720 --> 01:40:43,720
And it was awesome when I played it, and it looks even more awesome now.

2016
01:40:43,720 --> 01:40:44,720
Good for them.

2017
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:45,720
Definitely going to be checking that out.

2018
01:40:45,720 --> 01:40:46,720
That's great.

2019
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:47,720
All right.

2020
01:40:47,720 --> 01:40:50,720
Moving on to some stories that I have over here.

2021
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:54,720
Kunio-kun, that series, which is River City Ransom.

2022
01:40:54,720 --> 01:40:55,720
It's those characters, right?

2023
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:56,720
Yeah.

2024
01:40:56,720 --> 01:40:57,720
Dodgeball.

2025
01:40:57,720 --> 01:41:01,720
They're going to be getting another game on PC, PlayStation 4, and Switch.

2026
01:41:01,720 --> 01:41:04,720
And I guess it's, well, I mean, the Switch is region-free.

2027
01:41:04,720 --> 01:41:05,720
Yeah.

2028
01:41:05,720 --> 01:41:06,720
So you'd be able to play it anywhere.

2029
01:41:06,720 --> 01:41:12,720
But this is a new version of River City Melee Battle Royale Special.

2030
01:41:12,720 --> 01:41:17,720
So the game is actually called Downtown Rantou Koushin Koyoku Mak.

2031
01:41:17,720 --> 01:41:20,720
So that is, it's kind of like a reimagined version of that game from 2016,

2032
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:22,720
which is on the PC and PS4,

2033
01:41:22,720 --> 01:41:27,720
which in turn was a new version of River City Super Sports Challenge

2034
01:41:27,720 --> 01:41:31,720
All-Star Special for the PC and PlayStation 3.

2035
01:41:31,720 --> 01:41:33,720
Which, you know, again, the River City group,

2036
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:36,720
they were also in the dodgeball games, which are insanely possible.

2037
01:41:36,720 --> 01:41:41,720
So seeing them in the sports universe, not a completely crazy concept.

2038
01:41:41,720 --> 01:41:43,720
It is also going to be an arena brawler concept.

2039
01:41:43,720 --> 01:41:46,720
New items and modes, create a character.

2040
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:47,720
That'll be fun.

2041
01:41:47,720 --> 01:41:49,720
Probably sometime this year.

2042
01:41:49,720 --> 01:41:50,720
How about a battle royale mode?

2043
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:51,720
Why not?

2044
01:41:51,720 --> 01:41:52,720
A hundred people in the ring.

2045
01:41:52,720 --> 01:41:53,720
One lives.

2046
01:41:53,720 --> 01:41:54,720
Why not?

2047
01:41:54,720 --> 01:41:55,720
River City Ransom Battle Royale game.

2048
01:41:55,720 --> 01:41:56,720
Why not?

2049
01:41:56,720 --> 01:41:57,720
I love that.

2050
01:41:57,720 --> 01:41:58,720
That's where everything else is going.

2051
01:41:58,720 --> 01:41:59,720
Let's do it.

2052
01:41:59,720 --> 01:42:06,720
And this is getting a lot of eyes this week, is a trademark that Square Enix filed.

2053
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:14,720
The trademark that they filed in Europe and North America is called Collection of Mana.

2054
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:18,720
Just like something that they released in Japan.

2055
01:42:18,720 --> 01:42:21,720
They did not have to file said trademark because it's already out.

2056
01:42:21,720 --> 01:42:24,720
And it was that, of course, collection for the Switch that contains

2057
01:42:24,720 --> 01:42:28,720
Second Detsetsu 1, 2, and 3.

2058
01:42:28,720 --> 01:42:32,720
Which Second Detsetsu 2 is, of course, out here as Secret of Mana.

2059
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:35,720
And Second Detsetsu 3 is one of those infamous Super Nintendo games.

2060
01:42:35,720 --> 01:42:41,720
Never came out here, but I'm sure a lot of y'all played it through ROM hack translation patches anyway.

2061
01:42:41,720 --> 01:42:42,720
So it'd be very interesting.

2062
01:42:42,720 --> 01:42:43,720
I mean, who knows?

2063
01:42:43,720 --> 01:42:44,720
They might not include it.

2064
01:42:44,720 --> 01:42:46,720
They might release it over here and not include that.

2065
01:42:46,720 --> 01:42:49,720
It would just be the regular Secret of Mana and the Game Boy game or whatever.

2066
01:42:49,720 --> 01:42:51,720
But maybe they will.

2067
01:42:51,720 --> 01:42:53,720
And that would be pretty cool.

2068
01:42:53,720 --> 01:42:57,720
Especially, you know, when Octopath Traveler did pretty well.

2069
01:42:57,720 --> 01:43:02,720
Maybe Square Enix is probably looking to take more risks on the Switch.

2070
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:03,720
We'll see.

2071
01:43:03,720 --> 01:43:04,720
That'd be great.

2072
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:09,720
Bob Coffee in chat says, hopefully we get Second 3 finally officially localized.

2073
01:43:09,720 --> 01:43:11,720
I mean, that would be the best part.

2074
01:43:11,720 --> 01:43:15,720
I mean, nothing against those translators who worked their ass off to make this happen.

2075
01:43:15,720 --> 01:43:22,720
But to have the official version of that and Square, you know, it would feel really good to see that finally after all these years.

2076
01:43:22,720 --> 01:43:23,720
Yeah.

2077
01:43:23,720 --> 01:43:31,720
Anyhow, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of things that are coming out a little sooner than Collection of Mana, which is a rumor anyway.

2078
01:43:31,720 --> 01:43:32,720
But these are happening for sure.

2079
01:43:32,720 --> 01:43:38,720
Yes, so this week we've got Dirt Rally 2.0 on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

2080
01:43:38,720 --> 01:43:44,720
We have Stellaris, the console edition on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2081
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:49,720
We have the LEGO Movie 2 video game on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

2082
01:43:49,720 --> 01:43:55,720
And Trials Rising on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

2083
01:43:55,720 --> 01:44:01,720
Alien League on PC, Dead or Alive 6 on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

2084
01:44:01,720 --> 01:44:07,720
Swords and Soldiers 2, Shormageddon on the Nintendo Switch.

2085
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:14,720
And last but not least, Toejam and Earl back in the groove on PC, Mac, Linux, Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

2086
01:44:14,720 --> 01:44:16,720
Interesting. I forgot they were bringing that back.

2087
01:44:16,720 --> 01:44:18,720
Yes, it's back.

2088
01:44:18,720 --> 01:44:23,720
All right. Well, going over to Japan and looking at the releases over there, Dead or Alive 6 also coming out in Japan.

2089
01:44:23,720 --> 01:44:27,720
It looks like it's a worldwide release day on March 1st, same day it hits the US.

2090
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:31,720
Just before that, on February 28th, we have some other releases in Japan.

2091
01:44:31,720 --> 01:44:33,720
It's kind of a busy week, actually.

2092
01:44:33,720 --> 01:44:40,720
A game called Noratu Ojutou Noraniko Heart 2 comes out in regular as well as some limited edition.

2093
01:44:40,720 --> 01:44:44,720
This game has the subtitle Nora, Princess, and Crying Cat.

2094
01:44:44,720 --> 01:44:49,720
That is the game. There's actually a little cat that's in the logo, like this little shadow.

2095
01:44:49,720 --> 01:44:50,720
But is it crying?

2096
01:44:50,720 --> 01:44:52,720
I can't tell because it's kind of from far away, so I don't know.

2097
01:44:52,720 --> 01:44:57,720
It just looks like, you know, it looks like another one of those anime turned into a video game type of things,

2098
01:44:57,720 --> 01:44:59,720
but I don't think it's anything they'd ever release over here.

2099
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:02,720
But you had me at cat.

2100
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:07,720
Leather games coming out in Japan, Left Alive, Wizard Symphony, all on PlayStation 4.

2101
01:45:07,720 --> 01:45:13,720
Shinsun no Jushin Tante no Jikinbo comes out as well.

2102
01:45:13,720 --> 01:45:20,720
Ride 3 also in Japan, Work Cross Work, Forgotten Anne, and Trials Rising also coming out in Japan.

2103
01:45:20,720 --> 01:45:23,720
It's a very busy week, and that's just all on the PlayStation 4.

2104
01:45:23,720 --> 01:45:29,720
On the Switch, Darius Cosmic Collection, that's pretty cool, in a regular and special edition.

2105
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:35,720
That Noratu Ojutou, the Crying Cat thing, that's also on the Switch as well.

2106
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:42,720
As well as a game called Boku no Kanojo wa Ningyo Hime comes out there as well.

2107
01:45:42,720 --> 01:45:46,720
And a Doraemon game, Doraemon Nobita no Getsumen Tansaki.

2108
01:45:46,720 --> 01:45:51,720
And, oh my god, this is great, a game called My Girlfriend is a Mermaid?

2109
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:54,720
Well, bitch, she might be.

2110
01:45:54,720 --> 01:45:57,720
It's like Splash all over again.

2111
01:45:57,720 --> 01:46:00,720
I'm going back to the Darius Collection because that's pretty rad, yeah.

2112
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:07,720
Darius 2, Sengaya, which was the Darius 2 overseas version, and Darius Gaiden.

2113
01:46:07,720 --> 01:46:10,720
So, busy week. That's cool.

2114
01:46:10,720 --> 01:46:13,720
That's your Japanese releases. How about Europe?

2115
01:46:13,720 --> 01:46:16,720
Europe has 8-Bit Invaders coming out on PlayStation 4.

2116
01:46:16,720 --> 01:46:20,720
Dirt Rally 2.0 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

2117
01:46:20,720 --> 01:46:25,720
Nier Automata Game of the Year, or Game of the Yora edition.

2118
01:46:25,720 --> 01:46:27,720
Haha, pun.

2119
01:46:27,720 --> 01:46:29,720
That's on PlayStation 4.

2120
01:46:29,720 --> 01:46:33,720
Trials Rising Gold on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and the Switch.

2121
01:46:33,720 --> 01:46:40,720
Aces of the Luftwaffe Squadron edition, that's on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and the Switch.

2122
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:43,720
Rad Rogers Radical Edition on the Switch.

2123
01:46:43,720 --> 01:46:47,720
Crash Dummy on PlayStation 4 and the Switch.

2124
01:46:47,720 --> 01:46:50,720
Dead or Alive 6 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2125
01:46:50,720 --> 01:46:54,720
The Lego Movie Video Game on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2126
01:46:54,720 --> 01:47:00,720
And, let's see, Dark Souls Trilogy on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

2127
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:01,720
That's it.

2128
01:47:02,720 --> 01:47:07,720
Alright, every week we invite your emails at participate at orangeloungeradio.com

2129
01:47:07,720 --> 01:47:10,720
and we read your emails here live on the air.

2130
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:13,720
So, again, that email address, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

2131
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:16,720
First email tonight from our good pal YYR.

2132
01:47:16,720 --> 01:47:18,720
He likes to chime in with his thoughts.

2133
01:47:18,720 --> 01:47:19,720
So, YYR starts us off tonight.

2134
01:47:19,720 --> 01:47:23,720
Hello, LR. I was literally just listening to last week's show

2135
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:26,720
and I wanted to address something you guys mentioned in rapid fire news.

2136
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:28,720
Microsoft Solitaire Collection.

2137
01:47:28,720 --> 01:47:30,720
Yes, it's still included with Windows today.

2138
01:47:30,720 --> 01:47:33,720
However, it's not quite free. It's free to play.

2139
01:47:33,720 --> 01:47:34,720
I wish I was joking.

2140
01:47:34,720 --> 01:47:36,720
The thing is filled with ads.

2141
01:47:36,720 --> 01:47:39,720
If you want to remove the ads, you have to buy an in-app purchase in order to do that.

2142
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:42,720
You know, now that he's saying that, I do remember that.

2143
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:45,720
Like, when I played so many levels, like to play another level,

2144
01:47:45,720 --> 01:47:49,720
it was like, here's a crappy ad for something you'll never actually play.

2145
01:47:49,720 --> 01:47:50,720
And, yeah, you had to sit through that.

2146
01:47:50,720 --> 01:47:54,720
So, now, I just, I had blacked that out of my mind.

2147
01:47:54,720 --> 01:47:56,720
Can you blame me on that?

2148
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:59,720
Anyway, if you want to remove the ads, you'll have to buy an in-app purchase in order to do that.

2149
01:47:59,720 --> 01:48:01,720
But, here's the real kick in the ass.

2150
01:48:01,720 --> 01:48:07,720
The purchase is a subscription that costs $1.50 a month or $10 a year.

2151
01:48:07,720 --> 01:48:10,720
And, when the subscription expires, the ads come back.

2152
01:48:10,720 --> 01:48:15,720
Not worth it. I'm deleting that off my system.

2153
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:17,720
Now, y'all got to make a choice.

2154
01:48:17,720 --> 01:48:18,720
Y'all got to make a choice.

2155
01:48:18,720 --> 01:48:19,720
Do I even have Solitaire?

2156
01:48:19,720 --> 01:48:22,720
You want ad-free Solitaire or you want Grinder Extra?

2157
01:48:22,720 --> 01:48:23,720
What are you going to do?

2158
01:48:23,720 --> 01:48:27,720
By the way, I checked the latest user reviews

2159
01:48:27,720 --> 01:48:31,720
and, apparently, the recent supposed improvements are controversial.

2160
01:48:31,720 --> 01:48:35,720
Lots of folks recently left one-star reviews asking for the old version back.

2161
01:48:35,720 --> 01:48:37,720
So, I'll just say this.

2162
01:48:37,720 --> 01:48:41,720
If you're feeling nostalgic and want to play Solitaire or Minesweeper on Windows,

2163
01:48:41,720 --> 01:48:45,720
just copy the Windows 7 versions from someone who's still running Windows 7.

2164
01:48:45,720 --> 01:48:47,720
Done deal. I'm sure they're out there on the internet.

2165
01:48:47,720 --> 01:48:50,720
I just uninstalled it. Take that, Microsoft.

2166
01:48:50,720 --> 01:48:52,720
I will not play a crappy Solitaire game.

2167
01:48:52,720 --> 01:48:57,720
Before I go, I know that you were asking for streams or videos to run

2168
01:48:57,720 --> 01:48:59,720
during the post-classic Game of the Week break.

2169
01:48:59,720 --> 01:49:03,720
I could certainly contribute a few videos of my current and upcoming games,

2170
01:49:03,720 --> 01:49:06,720
but I'm not usually about shameless self-promotion.

2171
01:49:06,720 --> 01:49:07,720
What do you think?

2172
01:49:07,720 --> 01:49:08,720
Have a great week.

2173
01:49:08,720 --> 01:49:09,720
YYR.

2174
01:49:09,720 --> 01:49:10,720
I need to make some of those. You know what?

2175
01:49:10,720 --> 01:49:11,720
Yeah.

2176
01:49:11,720 --> 01:49:12,720
I do need to do that.

2177
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:13,720
Here's the thing.

2178
01:49:13,720 --> 01:49:15,720
I have an idea for how to fill it in.

2179
01:49:15,720 --> 01:49:17,720
I will probably do a spotlight.

2180
01:49:17,720 --> 01:49:20,720
But this is like the default when nothing else exists.

2181
01:49:20,720 --> 01:49:22,720
I will probably spotlight a free game.

2182
01:49:22,720 --> 01:49:26,720
Meaning like in the Epic Store, they've been giving away those free games.

2183
01:49:26,720 --> 01:49:28,720
Sometimes you get them on Steam too.

2184
01:49:28,720 --> 01:49:30,720
Or itch.io, of course.

2185
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:32,720
Great indie place to play lots of free games.

2186
01:49:32,720 --> 01:49:36,720
Speaking of which, I was going to say Epic Game Store has Thimbleweed Park.

2187
01:49:36,720 --> 01:49:37,720
Have you played that yet?

2188
01:49:37,720 --> 01:49:38,720
I haven't, but I grabbed it.

2189
01:49:38,720 --> 01:49:40,720
And so if we don't get anything for next week,

2190
01:49:40,720 --> 01:49:41,720
we'll probably see that.

2191
01:49:41,720 --> 01:49:42,720
It is a great game.

2192
01:49:42,720 --> 01:49:43,720
Yes.

2193
01:49:43,720 --> 01:49:45,720
So here's the thing.

2194
01:49:45,720 --> 01:49:47,720
But I would actually rather it not be me.

2195
01:49:47,720 --> 01:49:49,720
You see enough of me on this program.

2196
01:49:49,720 --> 01:49:54,720
So I would happily solicit somewhere between 7 to 10,

2197
01:49:54,720 --> 01:49:58,720
no more than 12 minute segments to run during the break,

2198
01:49:58,720 --> 01:50:01,720
or during the in-studio break for us to rest our voices,

2199
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:03,720
use the potty, get water, things like that.

2200
01:50:03,720 --> 01:50:05,720
You know, things that we do to keep a show going.

2201
01:50:05,720 --> 01:50:08,720
Because a regular radio show would have full length commercial breaks

2202
01:50:08,720 --> 01:50:09,720
for people to do that.

2203
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:10,720
We don't have that.

2204
01:50:10,720 --> 01:50:13,720
So I would like to welcome other Twitch contributors,

2205
01:50:13,720 --> 01:50:16,720
and Twitch streamers, and game makers, and game developers.

2206
01:50:16,720 --> 01:50:19,720
You know, as long as it's not just a flat out commercial,

2207
01:50:19,720 --> 01:50:22,720
but especially YYR, you've been working with our show for forever.

2208
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:26,720
I think it would be really cool if you kind of had somebody

2209
01:50:26,720 --> 01:50:29,720
who's a Twitch streamer show off one of your games.

2210
01:50:29,720 --> 01:50:31,720
That would be really cool.

2211
01:50:31,720 --> 01:50:34,720
You know, because I'd like to spotlight some other indie creators

2212
01:50:34,720 --> 01:50:35,720
here on Twitch.

2213
01:50:35,720 --> 01:50:38,720
And that could even be 10 minutes of your own podcast.

2214
01:50:38,720 --> 01:50:40,720
I ain't worried about competition.

2215
01:50:40,720 --> 01:50:43,720
There's plenty of time in the day to listen to lots of stuff,

2216
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:44,720
and a lot of the stuff is on demand.

2217
01:50:44,720 --> 01:50:47,720
So anyway, if you'd like to contribute something like that,

2218
01:50:47,720 --> 01:50:48,720
please get in touch with me.

2219
01:50:48,720 --> 01:50:50,720
You can reach out on Twitter at MrRobRoberts,

2220
01:50:50,720 --> 01:50:53,720
or you can email me directly, rob at voggenetwork.com.

2221
01:50:53,720 --> 01:50:56,720
And I would be very interested in having those types of segments

2222
01:50:56,720 --> 01:50:58,720
for the future.

2223
01:50:58,720 --> 01:51:01,720
And you know, if we get flooded with them, you know what?

2224
01:51:01,720 --> 01:51:04,720
We could do something after OLR.

2225
01:51:04,720 --> 01:51:05,720
We could play a segment after it,

2226
01:51:05,720 --> 01:51:07,720
because we kind of don't have a lot on Twitch afterwards.

2227
01:51:07,720 --> 01:51:11,720
We could play something maybe even before, during Bobby's show on us.

2228
01:51:11,720 --> 01:51:14,720
So I'm not worried about getting swarmed with content.

2229
01:51:14,720 --> 01:51:17,720
But I don't want outright commercials.

2230
01:51:17,720 --> 01:51:20,720
But when it comes to indie stuff, is it really a commercial?

2231
01:51:20,720 --> 01:51:23,720
Because a lot of indie folks have a really hard time getting their word out.

2232
01:51:23,720 --> 01:51:24,720
You know what I mean?

2233
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:25,720
Yeah.

2234
01:51:25,720 --> 01:51:27,720
And I also, of course, would open it up to chatters.

2235
01:51:27,720 --> 01:51:29,720
What would you guys like to see in our breaks?

2236
01:51:29,720 --> 01:51:31,720
Because yeah, this is something that's going to start next week.

2237
01:51:31,720 --> 01:51:35,720
So if we don't get anything, then it's going to be me playing Thimbleweed Park.

2238
01:51:35,720 --> 01:51:37,720
That's what you're going to get for the break next week.

2239
01:51:37,720 --> 01:51:40,720
Like I did Tetris 99 last week.

2240
01:51:40,720 --> 01:51:43,720
But if we do start getting things, then I'd rather play those.

2241
01:51:43,720 --> 01:51:47,720
But I just want all our content creators who want to be on the break,

2242
01:51:47,720 --> 01:51:50,720
remember, it's a podcast too.

2243
01:51:50,720 --> 01:51:52,720
So keep that in the back of your mind.

2244
01:51:52,720 --> 01:51:55,720
You can't just say, look at this, look at that, look at this.

2245
01:51:55,720 --> 01:51:56,720
You have to talk us through.

2246
01:51:56,720 --> 01:52:01,720
And remember, we have folks that are also visually impaired who listen to this show and so forth.

2247
01:52:01,720 --> 01:52:04,720
So we've got to keep them in our minds as well.

2248
01:52:04,720 --> 01:52:08,720
So as Joe 100 Matt says, I would love to do more videos,

2249
01:52:08,720 --> 01:52:11,720
but my day job takes up so much of my day to day life.

2250
01:52:11,720 --> 01:52:13,720
I have a few ideas, but they do take time for me.

2251
01:52:13,720 --> 01:52:15,720
I wouldn't expect any one person to do this every single week.

2252
01:52:15,720 --> 01:52:17,720
In fact, I think that's actually a bad idea.

2253
01:52:17,720 --> 01:52:23,720
It would be great if there were like 10 people that did it on like a rotating thing.

2254
01:52:23,720 --> 01:52:24,720
You know what I mean?

2255
01:52:24,720 --> 01:52:26,720
I'll find something to put together.

2256
01:52:26,720 --> 01:52:29,720
I have all this footage of me playing DDR that I put together.

2257
01:52:29,720 --> 01:52:30,720
Why not?

2258
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:32,720
Okay, here's the one caution with DDR.

2259
01:52:32,720 --> 01:52:34,720
The problem is that license music.

2260
01:52:34,720 --> 01:52:36,720
Well, I just pick a non-license song.

2261
01:52:36,720 --> 01:52:38,720
Yeah, as long as you're picking Konami originals, it should be fine.

2262
01:52:38,720 --> 01:52:40,720
I'm not as worried about getting muted with that stuff.

2263
01:52:40,720 --> 01:52:41,720
Yeah.

2264
01:52:41,720 --> 01:52:44,720
Anyway, let's see.

2265
01:52:44,720 --> 01:52:48,720
Motonious Games in chat says, I'm going to start a yellow lounge radio podcast.

2266
01:52:48,720 --> 01:52:49,720
Big bucks incoming.

2267
01:52:49,720 --> 01:52:52,720
I actually want to hear a random side tangent, true story.

2268
01:52:52,720 --> 01:52:58,720
So when we first launched Horde House all those years ago, remember Horde House?

2269
01:52:58,720 --> 01:53:00,720
It was the sideshow that I did with Exfer and Shane.

2270
01:53:00,720 --> 01:53:03,720
Originally it was just Exfer and I, but later we had Shane and Grandpa.

2271
01:53:03,720 --> 01:53:05,720
It was about World of Warcraft because we were like obsessed with it at the time.

2272
01:53:05,720 --> 01:53:07,720
We played a lot of it.

2273
01:53:07,720 --> 01:53:12,720
So we ended up naming that show Horde House because I solicited names online

2274
01:53:12,720 --> 01:53:15,720
and I was like, what would be a funny name for the show?

2275
01:53:15,720 --> 01:53:17,720
And somebody submitted that and I'm like, I love it.

2276
01:53:17,720 --> 01:53:19,720
I love it because it's like the double entendre, right?

2277
01:53:19,720 --> 01:53:22,720
If you say Horde House over, it sounds like something else.

2278
01:53:22,720 --> 01:53:24,720
I'll leave it at that, right?

2279
01:53:24,720 --> 01:53:25,720
So we thought that was a funny name.

2280
01:53:25,720 --> 01:53:28,720
In fact, actually the full name was the best little Horde House in Azeroth.

2281
01:53:28,720 --> 01:53:31,720
Like I'm beating you over the head with the reference.

2282
01:53:31,720 --> 01:53:32,720
I think you'd all get it.

2283
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:38,720
But my thing was, if we don't get any names, I think we could just be like Warcraft Lounge Radio, right?

2284
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:40,720
We'll take, cause it's kind of like a spinoff of Orange Lounge Radio.

2285
01:53:40,720 --> 01:53:42,720
We'll be Warcraft Lounge Radio.

2286
01:53:42,720 --> 01:53:44,720
We'll get this. We didn't go with that name.

2287
01:53:44,720 --> 01:53:48,720
Not even like, like it was like the same week Horde House started

2288
01:53:48,720 --> 01:53:50,720
or like the week before or the week after.

2289
01:53:50,720 --> 01:53:54,720
It was like within the same month, a new podcast popped up called Warcraft Lounge Radio.

2290
01:53:54,720 --> 01:53:55,720
I kid you not.

2291
01:53:55,720 --> 01:53:58,720
And it had nothing to do with LOLR.

2292
01:53:58,720 --> 01:54:00,720
People I'd never heard of before.

2293
01:54:00,720 --> 01:54:02,720
Other Warcraft fans doing their thing, making a podcast.

2294
01:54:02,720 --> 01:54:04,720
Total fucking coincidence.

2295
01:54:04,720 --> 01:54:08,720
But I just, I kind of had to step back and I was like, that's really funny.

2296
01:54:08,720 --> 01:54:09,720
That's really funny.

2297
01:54:09,720 --> 01:54:13,720
Cause I never said this on the show that I was thinking about doing a Warcraft thing, right?

2298
01:54:13,720 --> 01:54:18,720
It's just that one of those funny fucking coincidences where somebody had the same idea.

2299
01:54:18,720 --> 01:54:19,720
So, anyway.

2300
01:54:19,720 --> 01:54:23,720
But it all worked out great cause some people came to LOLR because of Horde House.

2301
01:54:23,720 --> 01:54:29,720
I'm sad that that show isn't still on but the reality is nobody had the passion for those types of games.

2302
01:54:30,720 --> 01:54:31,720
You know, anymore.

2303
01:54:31,720 --> 01:54:33,720
Kind of would like come and go and stuff.

2304
01:54:33,720 --> 01:54:35,720
But everybody's doing some other type of content.

2305
01:54:35,720 --> 01:54:37,720
Like Xfer has a Twitch channel.

2306
01:54:37,720 --> 01:54:41,720
Grandpa's still working with Starboard Power Coupling.

2307
01:54:41,720 --> 01:54:46,720
Which is, you know, if you're obsessed.com with Star Trek Discovery, as you should be.

2308
01:54:46,720 --> 01:54:48,720
That's a great companion thing to be listening to.

2309
01:54:48,720 --> 01:54:50,720
So check out Starboard Power Coupling.

2310
01:54:50,720 --> 01:54:55,720
And then Shane, you know, he's not doing his ranger pride now.

2311
01:54:55,720 --> 01:54:57,720
But I'm sure he'll think of something in the future.

2312
01:54:57,720 --> 01:54:59,720
He pops in on this show and my own streams and stuff.

2313
01:54:59,720 --> 01:55:03,720
So you still see all those guys around making their own things somewhere else.

2314
01:55:03,720 --> 01:55:04,720
So, anyway.

2315
01:55:04,720 --> 01:55:06,720
Ooh, that was a big tangent.

2316
01:55:06,720 --> 01:55:07,720
Let's see.

2317
01:55:07,720 --> 01:55:11,720
Going to chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network.

2318
01:55:11,720 --> 01:55:17,720
S2100matt says, I would watch a video of Loki showing how he mods his DDR machine.

2319
01:55:17,720 --> 01:55:19,720
Then again, that kind of promotes piracy.

2320
01:55:19,720 --> 01:55:20,720
Yeah, you gotta watch that stuff.

2321
01:55:20,720 --> 01:55:23,720
Just remember, everything you do is being recorded, right?

2322
01:55:23,720 --> 01:55:25,720
Oh, how he mod it?

2323
01:55:25,720 --> 01:55:27,720
Yeah, I mean, I wish it was complicated.

2324
01:55:27,720 --> 01:55:34,720
But all it really is is literally just swapping out the drive for a DVD drive that's compatible with.

2325
01:55:34,720 --> 01:55:37,720
And then popping any burned disc off the internet.

2326
01:55:37,720 --> 01:55:42,720
Which is ironic because I'm still playing Extreme because all the other mods didn't work quite right.

2327
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:44,720
So I'm back to Extreme again.

2328
01:55:44,720 --> 01:55:49,720
I'm running it off the mod disc because I'm too afraid to try to pop the original disc back in there.

2329
01:55:49,720 --> 01:55:51,720
Because I may have to reinstall everything.

2330
01:55:51,720 --> 01:55:53,720
And, yeah.

2331
01:55:53,720 --> 01:55:57,720
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, bring it back as a Phantasy Star Online Blueburst podcast.

2332
01:55:57,720 --> 01:55:59,720
Hey, hey, you tease.

2333
01:55:59,720 --> 01:56:01,720
But I think that's also really good.

2334
01:56:01,720 --> 01:56:03,720
It's a livestream kind of thing.

2335
01:56:03,720 --> 01:56:06,720
And then Bob Coffee says, disco is really great.

2336
01:56:06,720 --> 01:56:08,720
Most Star Trek asked Star Trek in like 84 years.

2337
01:56:08,720 --> 01:56:11,720
But nobody was saying that after the first season.

2338
01:56:11,720 --> 01:56:12,720
Isn't that funny?

2339
01:56:12,720 --> 01:56:14,720
It's almost like the first season was just like all set.

2340
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:15,720
The first season was just a setup.

2341
01:56:15,720 --> 01:56:17,720
It's all it was to get us to this point.

2342
01:56:17,720 --> 01:56:20,720
And now, now, like, engage, right?

2343
01:56:20,720 --> 01:56:21,720
Now we're going.

2344
01:56:21,720 --> 01:56:25,720
Anyway, and then, like I said, Beetlejuice three times.

2345
01:56:25,720 --> 01:56:26,720
Shane showed up in chat.

2346
01:56:26,720 --> 01:56:28,720
I'm not doing anything. You're right.

2347
01:56:28,720 --> 01:56:30,720
But you're here.

2348
01:56:30,720 --> 01:56:31,720
You're showing up here.

2349
01:56:31,720 --> 01:56:33,720
You show up on my livestream.

2350
01:56:33,720 --> 01:56:37,720
And, you know, Shane, we should, like, do a show about, like, Pokemon.

2351
01:56:37,720 --> 01:56:38,720
Wouldn't that be a lot of fun?

2352
01:56:38,720 --> 01:56:40,720
Because I play a lot of Pokemon Go.

2353
01:56:40,720 --> 01:56:42,720
Oh, yeah, wait, we tried that.

2354
01:56:42,720 --> 01:56:45,720
Hey, but if shaking and crying can come back, anything's possible, right?

2355
01:56:45,720 --> 01:56:46,720
Who knows?

2356
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:47,720
Who knows?

2357
01:56:47,720 --> 01:56:50,720
Maybe Shane will find a show he wants to do in the future.

2358
01:56:50,720 --> 01:56:54,720
Just do, like, the best little Pokestop and just kind of combine all of them.

2359
01:56:54,720 --> 01:56:57,720
Do you remember there was a, the whole thing, there was a Pokestop podcast.

2360
01:56:57,720 --> 01:56:58,720
Do you remember that?

2361
01:56:58,720 --> 01:56:59,720
Yes, I remember there was a Pokestop podcast.

2362
01:56:59,720 --> 01:57:00,720
That's what I'm saying.

2363
01:57:00,720 --> 01:57:05,720
You mesh all the shows you don't really have enough passion for together to make one show.

2364
01:57:05,720 --> 01:57:07,720
Just kind of combine the passion.

2365
01:57:07,720 --> 01:57:08,720
This is Katamari.

2366
01:57:08,720 --> 01:57:09,720
Yes.

2367
01:57:09,720 --> 01:57:11,720
Katamari, but game fandom.

2368
01:57:11,720 --> 01:57:12,720
Yeah, some of that.

2369
01:57:12,720 --> 01:57:13,720
All right, anyway.

2370
01:57:13,720 --> 01:57:14,720
Look, we got to get to another email.

2371
01:57:14,720 --> 01:57:15,720
Fandomari.

2372
01:57:15,720 --> 01:57:16,720
Fandomari.

2373
01:57:16,720 --> 01:57:18,720
Oh, my God, that's a good name for a show.

2374
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:19,720
That's a good, patent pending.

2375
01:57:19,720 --> 01:57:24,720
All right.

2376
01:57:24,720 --> 01:57:29,720
Our last and second email tonight for Dark Tetsuya, who's in our chat room, but he used

2377
01:57:29,720 --> 01:57:36,720
an email to expand on his thoughts, which I appreciate, which is a Damon Cross Machina.

2378
01:57:36,720 --> 01:57:39,720
I don't know if I'm saying the name of that game right.

2379
01:57:39,720 --> 01:57:41,720
The thoughts, the demo impressions.

2380
01:57:41,720 --> 01:57:42,720
Remember, I didn't watch the direct.

2381
01:57:42,720 --> 01:57:44,720
I was only able to get the play by play on Twitter.

2382
01:57:44,720 --> 01:57:46,720
So I don't even know if I'm saying it right.

2383
01:57:46,720 --> 01:57:47,720
But anyway.

2384
01:57:47,720 --> 01:57:48,720
It's Damon X Machina.

2385
01:57:48,720 --> 01:57:49,720
That's OK.

2386
01:57:49,720 --> 01:57:50,720
So I was I was close.

2387
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:51,720
All right.

2388
01:57:51,720 --> 01:57:52,720
Hey, O.L.R.

2389
01:57:52,720 --> 01:57:56,720
So with the release of the preview of Damon X Machina, I checked it out as soon as it

2390
01:57:56,720 --> 01:57:58,720
launched and spent the week trying to complete it.

2391
01:57:58,720 --> 01:58:01,720
So I wanted to send my impressions of the demo right out of the gate.

2392
01:58:01,720 --> 01:58:04,720
You can customize your avatar's appearance in his or her uniform color.

2393
01:58:04,720 --> 01:58:05,720
Oh, that's more than anthem.

2394
01:58:05,720 --> 01:58:06,720
I'll let you do.

2395
01:58:06,720 --> 01:58:08,720
I said I said I wouldn't be shady.

2396
01:58:08,720 --> 01:58:09,720
I'm sorry.

2397
01:58:09,720 --> 01:58:10,720
All right.

2398
01:58:10,720 --> 01:58:15,800
To make it whatever you want, as well as various customization options for your mech, different

2399
01:58:15,800 --> 01:58:20,480
parts, weapons and some internal upgrades, as well as, of course, customizes paint job

2400
01:58:20,480 --> 01:58:23,440
as well and add decals to put on your neck.

2401
01:58:23,440 --> 01:58:26,200
Looks like there will be a wide variety of parts.

2402
01:58:26,200 --> 01:58:30,360
And then you're thrown into your first tutorial mission to get a feel for the game.

2403
01:58:30,360 --> 01:58:31,360
Controls are pretty simple.

2404
01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:35,020
One button for each arm and one, I believe, for secondary weapons like missiles.

2405
01:58:35,020 --> 01:58:39,400
And you can also use jump jets to fly over everything or descend back onto the ground,

2406
01:58:39,400 --> 01:58:42,640
as well as a dash maneuver to avoid enemies and gunfire.

2407
01:58:42,640 --> 01:58:45,600
Lock on is automatic, though the camera doesn't lock on enemies.

2408
01:58:45,600 --> 01:58:46,600
You have to track it yourself.

2409
01:58:46,600 --> 01:58:50,080
But once you get the hang of the controls, it becomes second nature and you'll be flying,

2410
01:58:50,080 --> 01:58:53,160
dashing and dodging enemies and returning fire with ease.

2411
01:58:53,160 --> 01:58:56,720
The music is pretty cool with a very heavy metal inspired soundtrack.

2412
01:58:56,720 --> 01:59:00,360
Works pretty well in the background of giant robots blowing stuff up.

2413
01:59:00,360 --> 01:59:01,360
The demo is pretty generous.

2414
01:59:01,360 --> 01:59:05,640
You get the tutorial mission and three extra ones, culminating with a fight against a giant

2415
01:59:05,640 --> 01:59:07,880
spider tank mech.

2416
01:59:07,880 --> 01:59:09,140
Rad.

2417
01:59:09,140 --> 01:59:12,360
This is definitely the toughest mission I've come across, so you might be at this one for

2418
01:59:12,360 --> 01:59:13,360
a while.

2419
01:59:13,360 --> 01:59:16,520
Overall, I was quite happy with what the developers came up with in this game.

2420
01:59:16,520 --> 01:59:21,320
They've even sent out a survey to demo players to get their thoughts and anything they might

2421
01:59:21,320 --> 01:59:22,840
want to change or improve.

2422
01:59:22,840 --> 01:59:26,640
So I'm definitely looking forward to playing the final game.

2423
01:59:26,640 --> 01:59:27,800
Thank you very much for sharing your thoughts.

2424
01:59:27,800 --> 01:59:31,960
I appreciate the little mini review, especially when I have not gotten around to playing it

2425
01:59:31,960 --> 01:59:32,960
myself.

2426
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:33,960
But you did.

2427
01:59:33,960 --> 01:59:34,960
And you weren't as glowing.

2428
01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:38,640
I mean, I got bored after the first mission, so maybe it gets better, but I just didn't

2429
01:59:38,640 --> 01:59:39,640
care.

2430
01:59:39,640 --> 01:59:41,200
Do you think maybe you need to go back and just play a few more missions to see?

2431
01:59:41,200 --> 01:59:42,200
I didn't want to.

2432
01:59:42,200 --> 01:59:43,200
Like, I don't know.

2433
01:59:44,080 --> 01:59:47,400
I basically went to that because I got frustrated playing Tetris 99.

2434
01:59:47,400 --> 01:59:48,760
Well, I wouldn't say get frustrated.

2435
01:59:48,760 --> 01:59:52,240
I just got bored with it because you can only play you can probably play that for like a

2436
01:59:52,240 --> 01:59:53,240
little bit.

2437
01:59:53,240 --> 01:59:57,120
And it's just like, eh, I'm tired of playing Tetris, so I'll try this out.

2438
01:59:57,120 --> 02:00:00,720
And then I it just didn't really click with me, I guess.

2439
02:00:00,720 --> 02:00:02,520
I mean, doesn't mean it's a bad game.

2440
02:00:02,520 --> 02:00:05,280
I just sure didn't really draw in Fortnite.

2441
02:00:05,280 --> 02:00:08,940
Like I've really tried with Fortnite, but it's just not it doesn't I haven't tried any

2442
02:00:08,940 --> 02:00:09,940
of the battle royale games.

2443
02:00:09,940 --> 02:00:11,360
I just don't really have an interest in them.

2444
02:00:11,400 --> 02:00:13,560
So I know a lot of people play them.

2445
02:00:13,560 --> 02:00:15,760
I think it'd be more fun, like playing in a group of people.

2446
02:00:15,760 --> 02:00:17,360
I'm going to try Apex again.

2447
02:00:17,360 --> 02:00:18,360
I am.

2448
02:00:18,360 --> 02:00:19,840
I especially on PlayStation 4.

2449
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:23,200
Is it easier to party up in Apex?

2450
02:00:23,200 --> 02:00:26,120
You get thrown in matchmaking and it just gives you two random people.

2451
02:00:26,120 --> 02:00:29,440
Oh, and I suppose you're at the mercy of who you get, but you can have a party of people.

2452
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:30,440
Oh, sure.

2453
02:00:30,440 --> 02:00:31,440
You can.

2454
02:00:31,440 --> 02:00:32,440
Yeah.

2455
02:00:32,440 --> 02:00:33,440
You get bonuses, too, if you party with other people.

2456
02:00:33,440 --> 02:00:34,440
OK.

2457
02:00:34,440 --> 02:00:35,440
So you can definitely do that.

2458
02:00:35,440 --> 02:00:36,440
So.

2459
02:00:36,440 --> 02:00:37,440
Yeah.

2460
02:00:37,440 --> 02:00:38,440
Anyhow.

2461
02:00:38,440 --> 02:00:39,440
Let's see other comments in our chat.

2462
02:00:39,520 --> 02:00:42,680
Articio says, I know it's not for everyone, but I really got into it.

2463
02:00:42,680 --> 02:00:44,040
Quest Buster says demo is fun.

2464
02:00:44,040 --> 02:00:45,280
It needed cyber legs.

2465
02:00:45,280 --> 02:00:50,760
Got cyber legs at depth, pointing out as far as battle royales go, Tetris 99 is so good.

2466
02:00:50,760 --> 02:00:51,760
That's a good battle.

2467
02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:52,760
We're good.

2468
02:00:52,760 --> 02:00:53,760
Yeah, that's a good one to get your feet wet on.

2469
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:59,840
So I am here for more like of those types of like mega multiplayer games in different

2470
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:00,840
genres.

2471
02:01:00,840 --> 02:01:02,080
Dr. Mario 99.

2472
02:01:02,080 --> 02:01:03,080
Sure.

2473
02:01:03,080 --> 02:01:04,520
We can do a couple more puzzle games.

2474
02:01:04,520 --> 02:01:09,880
But how about how about in Super Mario Maker, 100 people take on the same level at once

2475
02:01:09,880 --> 02:01:13,720
with all these shadow Mario's bouncing everywhere would be hilarious.

2476
02:01:13,720 --> 02:01:14,720
I don't know.

2477
02:01:14,720 --> 02:01:16,720
I think it'd be fun.

2478
02:01:16,720 --> 02:01:17,720
All right.

2479
02:01:17,720 --> 02:01:18,720
Anyhow.

2480
02:01:18,720 --> 02:01:22,760
Oh, Miltonia's games from my heart.

2481
02:01:22,760 --> 02:01:24,320
One versus 100.

2482
02:01:24,320 --> 02:01:26,680
The original battle royale game show battle royale.

2483
02:01:26,680 --> 02:01:27,680
Of course.

2484
02:01:27,680 --> 02:01:28,680
Of course.

2485
02:01:28,680 --> 02:01:29,680
Maybe something Jackbox.

2486
02:01:29,680 --> 02:01:31,680
Because we we talked about this on the show.

2487
02:01:31,680 --> 02:01:32,680
I don't repeat myself too much.

2488
02:01:32,680 --> 02:01:35,920
Jackbox, you know, they build their games for lots and lots of people, but you sort

2489
02:01:35,920 --> 02:01:39,000
of have to like invite people there.

2490
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,360
They don't match make people for those games, really.

2491
02:01:41,360 --> 02:01:43,920
So because, you know, it kind of would alter that party atmosphere.

2492
02:01:43,920 --> 02:01:47,000
But I would love to see a Jackbox game with matchmaking.

2493
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:48,640
I think there's an audience for that.

2494
02:01:48,640 --> 02:01:51,560
I think there's an audience for a game that you don't just play with your friends.

2495
02:01:51,560 --> 02:01:53,400
You play with strangers.

2496
02:01:53,400 --> 02:01:59,280
And oh, my God, like patent pending, Jackbox, how about a game called like talk to strangers

2497
02:01:59,280 --> 02:02:01,400
or a game called strangers with candy?

2498
02:02:01,400 --> 02:02:03,960
Well, maybe that would conflict with the TV.

2499
02:02:03,960 --> 02:02:04,960
Stranger danger.

2500
02:02:04,960 --> 02:02:06,040
Stranger danger.

2501
02:02:06,040 --> 02:02:07,040
Come on.

2502
02:02:07,040 --> 02:02:08,040
There's a there's an untapped.

2503
02:02:08,040 --> 02:02:09,040
Do we have anybody?

2504
02:02:09,040 --> 02:02:10,040
Jackbox still listens to the show.

2505
02:02:10,040 --> 02:02:14,640
There's an untapped well here of like games you play in matchmaking stuff, these mega

2506
02:02:14,640 --> 02:02:15,640
games.

2507
02:02:15,640 --> 02:02:20,560
But the whole joke is that it's people you don't know and how sick they can be a stranger

2508
02:02:20,560 --> 02:02:21,560
danger.

2509
02:02:21,560 --> 02:02:22,920
That's a great name for a Jackbox game.

2510
02:02:22,920 --> 02:02:23,920
Oh, my God.

2511
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:24,920
I hope they're watching.

2512
02:02:24,920 --> 02:02:25,920
All right.

2513
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:26,920
Candy van.

2514
02:02:26,920 --> 02:02:27,920
Candy van.

2515
02:02:28,440 --> 02:02:33,160
They need to do a whole Jackbox party packages like battle royale type games, but game shows

2516
02:02:33,160 --> 02:02:34,480
I would so be here.

2517
02:02:34,480 --> 02:02:37,760
I don't know what their battle royale type game would be, but I'm totally down to see

2518
02:02:37,760 --> 02:02:38,760
what it would be.

2519
02:02:38,760 --> 02:02:42,120
Just do another voting game, another voting on like what's funnier.

2520
02:02:42,120 --> 02:02:48,080
But then I think what they're probably worried about is that if you let people enter in anything,

2521
02:02:48,080 --> 02:02:52,120
it's always going to go to, you know, dicks, butts, boobs, right?

2522
02:02:52,120 --> 02:02:53,780
Like somebody's just going to put that as their answer.

2523
02:02:53,780 --> 02:02:56,160
You could put in like, who is your favorite president?

2524
02:02:56,400 --> 02:03:00,000
And somebody's going to put dicks, butts, boobs, right?

2525
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:03,000
It's going to it's going to be ding ding.

2526
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,440
And then that answer is going to get like 40 votes.

2527
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:08,880
And then it's like, oh, I let my seven year old play your filth ass game.

2528
02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:11,280
And I'm a very upset parent because I didn't watch him.

2529
02:03:11,280 --> 02:03:12,280
That's why it's emirated.

2530
02:03:12,280 --> 02:03:13,280
So, you know, anyway.

2531
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:18,920
Well, I still remember back in the day with Acrophobia, which is a very similar thing.

2532
02:03:18,920 --> 02:03:23,060
I mean, I think that Berkeley systems that made Acrophobia like a lot of those people

2533
02:03:23,060 --> 02:03:24,800
are like Jackbox games now.

2534
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:25,800
Right.

2535
02:03:25,940 --> 02:03:35,040
They had Acrophobia split into mature rooms where every acronym was like, you know, dicks,

2536
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:37,880
butts, fart, you know, pussy.

2537
02:03:37,880 --> 02:03:40,840
Like it's just like every acronym is just like every dirty word you think of.

2538
02:03:40,840 --> 02:03:41,840
Right.

2539
02:03:41,840 --> 02:03:45,880
But then there was the clean rooms and their expectation was that in the clean rooms you

2540
02:03:45,880 --> 02:03:47,920
play, you know, the not dirty stuff.

2541
02:03:47,920 --> 02:03:52,280
And, you know, obviously the better experience obviously was in the clean rooms for the for

2542
02:03:52,280 --> 02:03:53,280
the game.

2543
02:03:53,280 --> 02:03:58,280
I still am hoping someday that they come up with a online version of Eat Poop You Cat

2544
02:03:58,280 --> 02:04:02,200
because it's just the best.

2545
02:04:02,200 --> 02:04:03,200
Yeah.

2546
02:04:03,200 --> 02:04:06,640
Miltonius Games suggests a new title, Strangers with Cookies.

2547
02:04:06,640 --> 02:04:10,040
That's I like it's a good like, you know what you mean?

2548
02:04:10,040 --> 02:04:13,720
Anyway, I feel like we should be charging our one of our favorite gaming companies for

2549
02:04:13,720 --> 02:04:15,400
a consultation right now.

2550
02:04:15,400 --> 02:04:18,400
Anyway, at least a special thanks credit will be great.

2551
02:04:18,400 --> 02:04:19,880
It's a little special thanks credit.

2552
02:04:19,880 --> 02:04:20,880
So we ask.

2553
02:04:20,880 --> 02:04:21,880
All right.

2554
02:04:22,600 --> 02:04:23,600
Moving on.

2555
02:04:26,120 --> 02:04:27,120
That was it for emails.

2556
02:04:27,120 --> 02:04:29,040
Well, we got on quite a tangent with that email, but it was a good one.

2557
02:04:29,040 --> 02:04:31,920
So anyway, let's get to some more news.

2558
02:04:31,920 --> 02:04:34,200
Oh, I'm so happy to get back into the news.

2559
02:04:34,200 --> 02:04:35,200
Yeah.

2560
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:36,200
Not with this story.

2561
02:04:36,200 --> 02:04:37,200
More layout.

2562
02:04:37,200 --> 02:04:38,200
Not with this.

2563
02:04:38,200 --> 02:04:39,200
This is horrible.

2564
02:04:39,200 --> 02:04:48,940
So EA, they have, I guess, apparently laid off some people from their Australian studio.

2565
02:04:48,980 --> 02:04:54,620
So apparently it was previously Iron Monkey and Fireman Studios.

2566
02:04:54,620 --> 02:04:57,020
And now it's, I guess, EA Australia.

2567
02:04:57,020 --> 02:05:03,600
They were known for making Real Racing 3, The Sims Freeplay, and Need for Speed No Limits.

2568
02:05:03,600 --> 02:05:07,800
And apparently they were also developing Real Racing 4, but I don't know if that's going

2569
02:05:07,800 --> 02:05:09,980
to happen.

2570
02:05:09,980 --> 02:05:15,060
They said that they haven't really talked about it's going to be close to.

2571
02:05:16,060 --> 02:05:20,620
Yeah, they had a number, about 200 people at Firemonkeys, and they were saying that

2572
02:05:20,620 --> 02:05:28,420
they were going to be estimating that 80 to 100 people were going to be laid off.

2573
02:05:28,420 --> 02:05:33,420
But apparently that's now dropped down to 40 to 50, but still that's a pretty good chunk

2574
02:05:33,420 --> 02:05:37,420
of their staff that's going to be laid off.

2575
02:05:37,420 --> 02:05:43,600
And then they were saying the Firemonkeys studio is working on some of the most popular

2576
02:05:43,600 --> 02:05:44,600
mobile games.

2577
02:05:44,640 --> 02:05:50,800
We recently made the decision to shift teams to focus on more of our live services and

2578
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:55,600
to have entered into a consultation period that may impact some roles in the studio.

2579
02:05:55,600 --> 02:05:59,840
We're working to match skills with opportunities as we go through this period, identifying

2580
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:04,880
other opportunities at EA and providing as much help to our employees as we possibly

2581
02:06:04,880 --> 02:06:05,880
can.

2582
02:06:05,880 --> 02:06:13,360
And then they declined to talk about Real Racing 4, whether it's canceled or not.

2583
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:15,360
That sucks.

2584
02:06:15,360 --> 02:06:22,000
And then on top of that, outside of EA, apparently the arena net is also going to be laying off

2585
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,480
people as well.

2586
02:06:24,480 --> 02:06:30,360
There was an email that went out to employees from their CEO saying our lives, our live

2587
02:06:30,360 --> 02:06:36,760
games business revenue is declining as our franchises age and delays in development on

2588
02:06:36,760 --> 02:06:43,840
PC and mobile have created further drains against our revenue projects while operating

2589
02:06:43,840 --> 02:06:46,680
costs in the west have increased.

2590
02:06:46,680 --> 02:06:53,920
We are not sustainable and it's not going to set us up for future success.

2591
02:06:53,920 --> 02:06:57,000
So they have to cut costs across the organization.

2592
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:01,760
Well that's obviously extremely disappointing, but at the same time, I look at arena net,

2593
02:07:01,760 --> 02:07:04,960
they did Guild Wars 2, but that was how many years ago?

2594
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:10,040
And Guild Wars 2 doesn't charge a monthly fee, so I know there's been expansions and

2595
02:07:10,040 --> 02:07:13,800
there's been other ways that they've been able to get money from the player base, but

2596
02:07:13,800 --> 02:07:18,800
I feel like the lifespan of a game like Guild Wars 2 probably is about up, and we haven't

2597
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:23,880
heard of a Guild Wars 3 or anything, I mean I don't know what other games arena net even

2598
02:07:23,880 --> 02:07:27,840
works on, which is probably part of the problem unfortunately, is that I associate them with

2599
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:33,240
Guild Wars and not a lot else, and it's just unfortunate.

2600
02:07:33,240 --> 02:07:38,360
I wish they had something else they were working on that there was more awareness about that

2601
02:07:38,360 --> 02:07:39,360
might...

2602
02:07:39,360 --> 02:07:43,840
Yeah, they said that right now they have about 400 employees, and they haven't said how many

2603
02:07:43,840 --> 02:07:50,600
employees are going to be affected by this, so I guess we'll have to wait and see, maybe

2604
02:07:50,600 --> 02:07:53,880
later this week we'll understand what the impact is going to be on that, but that's

2605
02:07:53,880 --> 02:07:54,880
unfortunate.

2606
02:07:54,880 --> 02:07:59,240
I was trying to see what else, what other games arena net does, and there was Guild

2607
02:07:59,240 --> 02:08:03,680
Wars, and there was five expansions for Guild Wars, and there was Guild Wars 2, and three

2608
02:08:03,680 --> 02:08:08,400
expansions for Guild Wars 2, that's actually it.

2609
02:08:08,400 --> 02:08:12,580
I was reminded though, is that, because I'm just looking at Wikipedia, a great place to

2610
02:08:12,580 --> 02:08:18,280
just kind of get my mind reminded of certain things, there was a controversy a little while

2611
02:08:18,280 --> 02:08:23,960
ago that went down on Twitter, I don't want to rehash that old controversy, but perhaps

2612
02:08:23,960 --> 02:08:27,200
you just remember there was some stuff going on with arena net and some of the writing

2613
02:08:27,200 --> 02:08:32,580
and so forth that happened about a year ago, I mean I don't know if there was a significant

2614
02:08:32,580 --> 02:08:38,660
fallout from that, but certainly that coupled with the age of the game, coupled with there's

2615
02:08:38,660 --> 02:08:43,440
nothing on their plate besides these Guild Wars games and no sign of the Guild Wars 3,

2616
02:08:43,440 --> 02:08:49,520
it doesn't add up unfortunately to a very lovely scenario, but again I hate it because

2617
02:08:49,520 --> 02:08:54,080
I don't like to hear people losing their jobs and so forth, I hope again they can get the

2618
02:08:54,080 --> 02:08:59,360
capital, get the investment, the financing to start a new project, a lot of these folks

2619
02:08:59,360 --> 02:09:04,600
got expertise developing online games, I know people that love Guild Wars, and heck, the

2620
02:09:04,600 --> 02:09:09,280
people that founded arena net used to work for Blizzard, so sometimes you take these

2621
02:09:09,280 --> 02:09:13,560
skills and take them other places.

2622
02:09:13,560 --> 02:09:18,520
Questbuster in chat points out they just had a big event in Guild Wars 2 to end a big story

2623
02:09:18,520 --> 02:09:22,260
arc, so it does kind of sound like the game's probably ramping down, but I'm sure the original

2624
02:09:22,260 --> 02:09:27,700
Guild Wars still has people playing it, you know, hello, I just talked about that we're

2625
02:09:27,700 --> 02:09:32,060
playing Phantasy Star online, there's just always going to be online games you remember

2626
02:09:32,060 --> 02:09:36,540
you want to go visit, and those games really lend themselves to being able to do it, right?

2627
02:09:36,540 --> 02:09:37,540
Yeah.

2628
02:09:37,540 --> 02:09:43,660
So anyway, well wishes, I mean they haven't laid off yet, they're trying to not do what

2629
02:09:43,660 --> 02:09:47,540
Activision just did and they're trying to really warn people and this whole thing, right,

2630
02:09:47,540 --> 02:09:49,540
is this not my understanding?

2631
02:09:49,540 --> 02:09:50,540
Yeah.

2632
02:09:50,540 --> 02:09:54,260
Well, and they haven't really said how many are going to be affected yet, so.

2633
02:09:54,260 --> 02:09:55,260
Yeah.

2634
02:09:55,260 --> 02:09:56,260
Hope it goes okay.

2635
02:09:56,260 --> 02:10:01,620
Alright, anyway, let's move on to somebody that's profiting in a different way, you guys

2636
02:10:01,620 --> 02:10:06,540
probably are familiar with a popular game streamer who's been on talk shows and things

2637
02:10:06,540 --> 02:10:13,000
like that, Ninja, whose real name is Tyler Blevins, who I will admit I haven't really

2638
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:17,500
watched, I have seen some of his appearances on these other things, I have seen the ads

2639
02:10:17,500 --> 02:10:20,820
that popped in his stream for some of the festivals he was working with, but I'm not

2640
02:10:20,820 --> 02:10:25,900
very familiar with his content, but that's not shade against him, props to him, he does

2641
02:10:25,900 --> 02:10:31,380
something, he's done it very well, and as long as he is spreading a message of positivity

2642
02:10:31,380 --> 02:10:38,700
for the community and not a message of being an asshole, then hooray for you, right?

2643
02:10:38,700 --> 02:10:40,180
Like I got nothing against him.

2644
02:10:40,180 --> 02:10:41,180
Is he a positive guy?

2645
02:10:41,180 --> 02:10:42,180
I don't know.

2646
02:10:42,180 --> 02:10:46,420
Uh oh, alright, well then maybe I'm better off being ignorant in this case.

2647
02:10:46,420 --> 02:10:54,820
Alright, but anyway, apparently he's teaming up with Wicked Cool Toys, who's doing, I guess,

2648
02:10:54,820 --> 02:10:58,660
like not just like a t-shirt and stickers and that sort of thing, which by the way,

2649
02:10:58,660 --> 02:11:03,060
if you like to support your favorite streamers with that kind of merchandise, we're working

2650
02:11:03,060 --> 02:11:04,060
on it.

2651
02:11:04,060 --> 02:11:05,060
We're working on it.

2652
02:11:05,060 --> 02:11:06,340
That's what I'm going to say.

2653
02:11:06,340 --> 02:11:10,620
Bobby's already like, technically if you know where to look, you could already get some

2654
02:11:10,620 --> 02:11:14,620
Bobby branded stuff, but I'm lagging behind a little bit.

2655
02:11:14,620 --> 02:11:21,460
Anyway, you can get some two inch collectibles in certain packs, $5 each for little figures,

2656
02:11:21,460 --> 02:11:25,540
four inch dancing figures for $10 that are themed around the emotes and the characters

2657
02:11:25,540 --> 02:11:29,380
that are already in the streams, headwear for $20 if you want to have your own blue

2658
02:11:29,380 --> 02:11:33,740
hair and headband and so forth, and there's other streamers that they're going to be working

2659
02:11:33,740 --> 02:11:36,380
with as well, I guess, which is pretty cool.

2660
02:11:36,380 --> 02:11:40,220
So yeah, I mean, everybody does it.

2661
02:11:40,220 --> 02:11:44,460
Isn't it interesting now how, like, these are the types of things that I would expect

2662
02:11:44,460 --> 02:11:49,260
around TV shows when I was a kid, like, well, but now this is what kids are considering,

2663
02:11:49,260 --> 02:11:50,260
right?

2664
02:11:50,260 --> 02:11:51,260
Your kids watch a lot.

2665
02:11:51,260 --> 02:11:52,260
Not Ninja, specifically.

2666
02:11:52,260 --> 02:11:53,300
No, they don't watch Ninja.

2667
02:11:53,300 --> 02:11:54,300
They watch YouTubers, right?

2668
02:11:54,300 --> 02:12:00,140
Yeah, they watch YouTubers, like, they kind of go back and forth about who they watch.

2669
02:12:00,140 --> 02:12:07,640
Like for example, my kids are watching DanTDM again, and DanTDM, he has his own line of

2670
02:12:07,640 --> 02:12:14,780
toys as well, some figures in his own, like, Minecraft book and stuff.

2671
02:12:14,780 --> 02:12:21,940
So he's got all that around there, plus there's also, God, stupid Ryan Toy Review, who has

2672
02:12:21,940 --> 02:12:24,280
his whole Ryan's toys lined up.

2673
02:12:24,280 --> 02:12:29,980
My youngest son is just bonkers over, and they're just the cheapest piece of shit crap

2674
02:12:29,980 --> 02:12:32,200
that you can buy, but he loves that stuff.

2675
02:12:32,200 --> 02:12:33,200
He just doesn't play with it.

2676
02:12:33,200 --> 02:12:34,200
He just needs it, though.

2677
02:12:34,200 --> 02:12:38,680
He needs all of it, because Ryan's playing with it and looks up to him, but I mean, that

2678
02:12:38,680 --> 02:12:43,320
stuff, there's a lot of, like, when you get that big, of course you're gonna have merchandise

2679
02:12:43,320 --> 02:12:48,720
and make even more money, because it's only smart business, so more power to him, I guess,

2680
02:12:48,720 --> 02:12:49,960
and it doesn't look like complete crap.

2681
02:12:49,960 --> 02:12:55,040
At least those are kind of cute, so yeah, more power to him.

2682
02:12:55,040 --> 02:12:57,240
Yeah, I think it's great.

2683
02:12:57,240 --> 02:13:00,600
Sorry, I got distracted for a minute, because I was hearing Discord noises, and I couldn't

2684
02:13:00,600 --> 02:13:03,380
tell if that was coming through on our stream or not.

2685
02:13:03,380 --> 02:13:08,540
So I thought I shut down Discord, hopefully I did, I'm gonna just quit that way so those

2686
02:13:08,540 --> 02:13:12,020
sounds don't come through on stream, so sorry if I made you think your Discord noises were

2687
02:13:12,020 --> 02:13:16,540
going through, but just in general, during the show is not a good time to send me DMs

2688
02:13:16,540 --> 02:13:19,420
on Discord, just throwing it out there.

2689
02:13:19,420 --> 02:13:21,380
Very bad time to try to get my attention on Discord.

2690
02:13:21,380 --> 02:13:25,140
Oh, and they're doing blind box figures, everybody does fucking blind boxes.

2691
02:13:25,140 --> 02:13:29,140
Unless you are one individual who hosts a show before this one, because you have to

2692
02:13:29,140 --> 02:13:31,820
tell me things about when I can take the stream and stuff.

2693
02:13:31,860 --> 02:13:37,100
Alright, anyway, so when are we going to release our figures?

2694
02:13:37,100 --> 02:13:39,820
We have people asking, when do we get the broccoli farm shirts?

2695
02:13:39,820 --> 02:13:42,100
I never made them.

2696
02:13:42,100 --> 02:13:46,520
Alright, anyway, let's move on, we have a few more stories for you guys before we will

2697
02:13:46,520 --> 02:13:51,380
get to Discord and open that up for your calls in our green room, but first...

2698
02:13:51,380 --> 02:13:54,460
Someday though, if I have free time, I will definitely design it.

2699
02:13:54,460 --> 02:13:56,740
First we have a few more stories for you guys.

2700
02:13:56,740 --> 02:13:58,300
You're taking this one, right, Loki, about the...

2701
02:13:58,300 --> 02:14:02,340
Yeah, so let's talk a little bit about HoloLens.

2702
02:14:02,340 --> 02:14:10,780
So Microsoft, some of their employees are demanding that Microsoft terminate their contract

2703
02:14:10,780 --> 02:14:14,580
with the US military because they feel that they're...

2704
02:14:14,580 --> 02:14:17,460
Sorry, this is delayed, I have to get this out though, because this made a lightning

2705
02:14:17,460 --> 02:14:20,260
bolt go off in my head to go, oh, oh, oh!

2706
02:14:20,260 --> 02:14:24,220
Apricot sushi in our chat, which is not a name I recognize, so hello and welcome, says

2707
02:14:24,220 --> 02:14:26,980
I was trying to remember what Ninja did that was crappy.

2708
02:14:26,980 --> 02:14:31,020
She's the guy who said he doesn't stream with female gamers to avoid rumors or something.

2709
02:14:31,020 --> 02:14:32,540
That was the weird thing.

2710
02:14:32,540 --> 02:14:35,860
Oh, I thought he also dropped the other F bomb.

2711
02:14:35,860 --> 02:14:38,660
Oh, I hope, oh, I hope not.

2712
02:14:38,660 --> 02:14:42,100
On accident, because he was mad at somebody.

2713
02:14:42,100 --> 02:14:44,140
Okay, that's not cool.

2714
02:14:44,140 --> 02:14:47,780
If true, that's not cool, but if I don't have the receipts in front of me, I'm not going

2715
02:14:47,780 --> 02:14:52,660
to pay that on him right now, but in general, please don't...

2716
02:14:52,660 --> 02:14:56,960
If you have words like that in your vocabulary, and there are other very, very bad ones to

2717
02:14:56,960 --> 02:15:01,760
that you shouldn't say on stream, you should consider removing them completely from your

2718
02:15:01,760 --> 02:15:06,080
vocabulary, because there's certain words that you don't say ever.

2719
02:15:06,080 --> 02:15:07,920
Consider your audience, how about that?

2720
02:15:07,920 --> 02:15:08,920
That too.

2721
02:15:08,920 --> 02:15:09,920
Anyhow.

2722
02:15:09,920 --> 02:15:17,080
Anyways, so there's a group of Microsoft workers that are called Microsoft Workers for Good,

2723
02:15:17,080 --> 02:15:25,160
and they have basically put together an open letter to their executive saying that, hey,

2724
02:15:25,160 --> 02:15:33,260
we did not sign up to develop weapons, and we demand a say in how our work is being used,

2725
02:15:33,260 --> 02:15:39,420
because they had signed a $479 million contract with the army to develop augmented reality

2726
02:15:39,420 --> 02:15:44,600
technology for use in combat, and they said augmented reality technology will provide

2727
02:15:44,600 --> 02:15:52,920
troops with more than better information to make decisions, and this new work extends

2728
02:15:52,920 --> 02:15:57,960
to a long-standing, trusted relationship with the Department of Defense into this new area,

2729
02:15:57,960 --> 02:16:03,560
and with that, they said, we've worked with the U.S. Department of Defense on a long-standing

2730
02:16:03,560 --> 02:16:08,360
and reliable basis for four decades, and you'll find Microsoft technology throughout the American

2731
02:16:08,360 --> 02:16:13,680
military helping power its front office, fuel operations bases, ships, aircraft training

2732
02:16:13,680 --> 02:16:19,720
facilities, and we're proud of this relationship, as we are of the many military veterans we

2733
02:16:19,720 --> 02:16:26,600
employ, but still, though, the people that are working on these projects don't like the

2734
02:16:26,600 --> 02:16:34,280
fact that it's gonna provide increased lethality, mobility, situational awareness necessary

2735
02:16:34,280 --> 02:16:41,680
to achieve, overmatch against our current and future adversaries.

2736
02:16:41,680 --> 02:16:42,680
I don't know.

2737
02:16:42,680 --> 02:16:45,760
So they're just against the whole contract thing, but I don't know if they-

2738
02:16:45,760 --> 02:16:51,720
This is a complicated story, and one that I'm not sure we can solve here on OLR, even

2739
02:16:51,720 --> 02:16:58,720
necessary one that we can get into the nitty-gritty details of, but it is fascinating how, and

2740
02:16:58,720 --> 02:17:03,200
obviously it's about gaming because Microsoft does the gaming stuff, and a lot of people

2741
02:17:03,200 --> 02:17:08,480
have thought about HoloLens as what's next for gaming because Microsoft has brought it

2742
02:17:08,480 --> 02:17:12,120
out on stage at E3 and shown the Minecraft and HoloLens and all this stuff.

2743
02:17:12,120 --> 02:17:17,720
Instead of thinking of it as a way to make soldiers more lethal, I would think of it

2744
02:17:17,720 --> 02:17:26,720
as a way to prevent, to help the soldiers from not getting killed, I should say, to

2745
02:17:26,720 --> 02:17:28,280
protect them more.

2746
02:17:28,280 --> 02:17:31,600
Look at it that way, and it doesn't seem as bad, but if you look at it as like, oh, it's

2747
02:17:31,600 --> 02:17:35,560
gonna make these future soldiers that are just gonna be super lethal, I don't think

2748
02:17:35,560 --> 02:17:36,560
that's really what's gonna happen here.

2749
02:17:36,560 --> 02:17:39,080
Yeah, HoloLens is not gonna turn people into Robocop.

2750
02:17:39,080 --> 02:17:40,080
Yeah.

2751
02:17:40,080 --> 02:17:41,080
Yeah.

2752
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:42,120
It is very interesting.

2753
02:17:42,120 --> 02:17:45,640
Well, I mean, but we know, I think now, like HoloLens, and I guess they just announced

2754
02:17:45,640 --> 02:17:48,520
HoloLens 2 today, because Bobby got into it on his show a little bit.

2755
02:17:48,520 --> 02:17:49,520
Yes, it looks awesome.

2756
02:17:49,520 --> 02:17:54,720
Yeah, but, you know, again, not really, and as Bobby pointed out in the trailer, if you

2757
02:17:54,720 --> 02:17:56,880
watch trailer, you don't see games in that trailer.

2758
02:17:56,880 --> 02:18:01,520
You see the real world applications, that thing, like fixing cars and bikes and surgeries

2759
02:18:01,520 --> 02:18:03,440
and things like that, which is really, you know, it's cool.

2760
02:18:03,440 --> 02:18:07,680
And once again, they don't show the depth, you know, the field of view that's on there.

2761
02:18:07,680 --> 02:18:10,680
They say it's double in size, but I don't know if it was...

2762
02:18:10,680 --> 02:18:15,400
The old one was, it wasn't bad, but like, you know, because I've been lucky enough to

2763
02:18:15,400 --> 02:18:20,080
try one, thanks to Bobby, and, you know, it's, again, I kind of look at it as like a concept

2764
02:18:20,080 --> 02:18:23,480
thing, and like as a concept, I really enjoyed HoloLens.

2765
02:18:23,480 --> 02:18:24,480
I really, really did.

2766
02:18:24,480 --> 02:18:29,400
I almost kind of like, like there's things about it I liked better than VR, and probably

2767
02:18:29,400 --> 02:18:32,840
a lot of it was the headset, because it felt, you know, it was kind of big, but it wasn't

2768
02:18:32,840 --> 02:18:36,680
like, you know, it felt a little more, and then this one looks like it's scaled down

2769
02:18:36,680 --> 02:18:40,960
even more, where it's just like the glasses and so forth, and, you know, the interactive

2770
02:18:40,960 --> 02:18:44,800
detective game that he was showing me that we were playing, which I know he streamed

2771
02:18:44,800 --> 02:18:49,980
at some point on his channel, it's probably in his archives, is really neat.

2772
02:18:49,980 --> 02:18:54,680
Like it's cool that you can like scan the room and stuff, and the actors like participate

2773
02:18:54,680 --> 02:18:58,800
in the room and everything, so like it definitely has like potential in gaming, even if not

2774
02:18:58,800 --> 02:19:04,800
fully realized yet, but it's interesting that this time, unlike Kinect, which was developed

2775
02:19:04,840 --> 02:19:09,140
for games and then kind of became this thing that really wasn't games, it's interesting

2776
02:19:09,140 --> 02:19:12,320
that HoloLens is taking this approach where it's like, okay, we're kind of like the other

2777
02:19:12,320 --> 02:19:18,400
stuff and maybe games will happen, which is kind of what personal computing was always

2778
02:19:18,400 --> 02:19:19,480
about, right?

2779
02:19:19,480 --> 02:19:22,200
Were personal computers made for gaming?

2780
02:19:22,200 --> 02:19:27,880
No, but it was a very, you know, things like word processing and spreadsheets and those

2781
02:19:27,880 --> 02:19:31,680
sorts of things, right, were some of the early things in computing, and it's like, oh, but

2782
02:19:31,680 --> 02:19:34,760
it plays games too, that's even better, you know, and I think maybe that's maybe the

2783
02:19:34,760 --> 02:19:37,680
approach Microsoft's taking with HoloLens, but anyway, I don't want to digress too much

2784
02:19:37,680 --> 02:19:41,160
from the topic, which is about the Department of Defense using it.

2785
02:19:41,160 --> 02:19:46,120
I think being able to have these like glasses that, you know, would show you basically like

2786
02:19:46,120 --> 02:19:51,000
a HUD, you know, I don't know what they're doing for defense, so maybe my brain just

2787
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,280
goes to what do I see when I play Call of Duty?

2788
02:19:53,280 --> 02:19:57,880
I might see a radar, you know, that shows me a map of this terrain I'm in or something

2789
02:19:57,880 --> 02:20:01,960
like that, which could be like, you know, imagine like if they're, you know, my brain

2790
02:20:01,960 --> 02:20:04,960
can't help but go to here, I'm sorry if it's inappropriate, but I think about the stories

2791
02:20:04,960 --> 02:20:08,840
I hear about the raid when they went to go get Osama bin Laden and all that, right?

2792
02:20:08,840 --> 02:20:10,400
You hear those stories about that, right?

2793
02:20:10,400 --> 02:20:16,560
Imagine if like the layout of that house had been something that was like in, like on their

2794
02:20:16,560 --> 02:20:18,600
vision and stuff, you know what I mean?

2795
02:20:18,600 --> 02:20:19,600
Yeah.

2796
02:20:19,600 --> 02:20:23,920
Yeah, and you know, that would be so like interesting and how that would have like changed

2797
02:20:23,920 --> 02:20:28,200
it and maybe helped them and so forth and further with what they were doing.

2798
02:20:28,200 --> 02:20:33,240
I think it's fascinating, but I also understand why some people don't want to be involved

2799
02:20:33,240 --> 02:20:37,600
in making, because if it's used for defense, hypothetically in the wrong hands, it could

2800
02:20:37,600 --> 02:20:39,160
be used for offense, right?

2801
02:20:39,160 --> 02:20:43,000
And I understand why some people want to wash their hands of that.

2802
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:47,760
But isn't AR in general kind of like a growing thing anyway?

2803
02:20:47,760 --> 02:20:48,760
Yeah.

2804
02:20:48,760 --> 02:20:53,160
So if not Microsoft, we know Google Glass was a thing not that long ago.

2805
02:20:53,160 --> 02:20:55,860
Yes, they have Magic Leap also doing stuff, right?

2806
02:20:55,860 --> 02:20:58,700
So if not Microsoft, won't somebody else?

2807
02:20:58,700 --> 02:20:59,700
Someone is.

2808
02:20:59,700 --> 02:21:00,700
Yeah.

2809
02:21:00,700 --> 02:21:01,700
So I don't know.

2810
02:21:01,700 --> 02:21:05,660
I mean, like I would just think, whereas I don't want to diminish the concerns and heck,

2811
02:21:05,660 --> 02:21:08,740
if anybody wants to come on the show and like talk about it from this perspective, I would

2812
02:21:08,740 --> 02:21:09,740
so invite that.

2813
02:21:09,740 --> 02:21:11,100
It would be awesome.

2814
02:21:11,100 --> 02:21:16,420
But at the same time, I'm just kind of like, at least if you're the one kind of developing

2815
02:21:16,420 --> 02:21:21,740
it, you can kind of help make sure it's a good guys emphasize thing that it's going

2816
02:21:21,740 --> 02:21:26,320
to be something the good guys use and not something used for attack or aggression or

2817
02:21:26,320 --> 02:21:27,820
so forth.

2818
02:21:27,820 --> 02:21:36,100
Anyway, going to chat over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network, Tigerclaw says, so they want

2819
02:21:36,100 --> 02:21:39,980
to use the HoloLens as a way for soldiers to be able to see information during combat,

2820
02:21:39,980 --> 02:21:43,080
kind of like what you see on those futuristic FPS games where the helmet they wear shows

2821
02:21:43,080 --> 02:21:44,240
the info on the screen.

2822
02:21:44,240 --> 02:21:45,620
We don't know, Tigerclaw.

2823
02:21:45,620 --> 02:21:47,060
We kind of have to make it up.

2824
02:21:47,060 --> 02:21:51,940
And when your brain kind of doesn't know things, you fill in the gaps with your perceptions.

2825
02:21:51,940 --> 02:21:56,300
And for us as gamers, our perceptions is these video games like Call of Duty and these other

2826
02:21:56,300 --> 02:21:57,300
games we play.

2827
02:21:57,300 --> 02:22:01,220
So that's so we don't really know, because, well, I like to know what I like.

2828
02:22:01,220 --> 02:22:05,540
The picture that they show was that Trimble has a version of the HoloLens 2 that's built

2829
02:22:05,540 --> 02:22:09,900
into a hard hat because they're using it for like construction and engineering and that

2830
02:22:09,900 --> 02:22:10,900
type of stuff.

2831
02:22:10,900 --> 02:22:11,900
Well, that's pretty awesome.

2832
02:22:11,900 --> 02:22:12,900
Yeah.

2833
02:22:13,180 --> 02:22:14,180
And then let's see.

2834
02:22:14,180 --> 02:22:19,500
Bobby Black Wolf says HoloLens 2 uses the next Gen Connect, Azure Connect, which I'm

2835
02:22:19,500 --> 02:22:21,260
guessing is cloud supported connect.

2836
02:22:21,260 --> 02:22:23,740
Nobody knows how they're actually using HoloLens 2.

2837
02:22:23,740 --> 02:22:28,020
And then S2100 Matt says, remember when Iraq bought thousands of PlayStation 2s to try

2838
02:22:28,020 --> 02:22:30,100
to power their missile guidance system?

2839
02:22:30,100 --> 02:22:33,180
Not sure if that actually happened or not, but I remember it was talked about.

2840
02:22:33,180 --> 02:22:36,880
I remember something about our military using PlayStation 3s because they were affected

2841
02:22:36,880 --> 02:22:38,420
by the other OS removal.

2842
02:22:38,420 --> 02:22:41,780
Well, they weren't because those systems definitely didn't connect to the internet because they

2843
02:22:42,020 --> 02:22:46,940
But like they were super computers at a very low price.

2844
02:22:46,940 --> 02:22:49,460
That was part of what made those PlayStation 3s.

2845
02:22:49,460 --> 02:22:50,460
Yeah, because of the cell processor.

2846
02:22:50,460 --> 02:22:51,460
Exactly.

2847
02:22:51,460 --> 02:22:53,500
So that's what made that whole thing attractive.

2848
02:22:53,500 --> 02:23:00,780
So yeah, military has and we've heard that games like America's Army and stuff have been

2849
02:23:00,780 --> 02:23:03,880
used to recruit for the military and so forth.

2850
02:23:03,880 --> 02:23:04,880
So if you think there's no...

2851
02:23:04,880 --> 02:23:06,300
That's a game we haven't seen in a long time.

2852
02:23:06,300 --> 02:23:08,860
I'm surprised they haven't tried to put out a new America's Army game.

2853
02:23:08,860 --> 02:23:09,860
Who knows?

2854
02:23:09,860 --> 02:23:13,180
But anyway, if you think there isn't crossover with gaming when it comes to some things like

2855
02:23:13,180 --> 02:23:14,180
this, just wait.

2856
02:23:14,180 --> 02:23:19,180
And again, maybe now there's a little bit of pushback on what's ethically appropriate,

2857
02:23:19,180 --> 02:23:22,120
I suppose, or what have you for the development of these things.

2858
02:23:22,120 --> 02:23:27,220
But again, like they're saying, they're putting HoloLens in a hard hat.

2859
02:23:27,220 --> 02:23:32,660
Maybe today that's prohibitively expensive for people to have everywhere.

2860
02:23:32,660 --> 02:23:35,820
But again, where are we going to be in 10 years?

2861
02:23:35,820 --> 02:23:39,500
And then the other thing I was going to mention along with the HoloLens stuff, there is some

2862
02:23:39,540 --> 02:23:43,900
other news around that, being that Epic Games has announced that they're adding HoloLens

2863
02:23:43,900 --> 02:23:47,060
support to Unreal Engine 4.

2864
02:23:47,060 --> 02:23:53,140
That they're saying that it'll allow people to use that to build games and 3D productivity

2865
02:23:53,140 --> 02:23:54,500
apps.

2866
02:23:54,500 --> 02:23:59,620
There's no games for it right now, but it's something that's going to be supported.

2867
02:23:59,620 --> 02:24:02,620
So you could build something if you'd like.

2868
02:24:02,620 --> 02:24:05,780
And maybe that's a better approach for something like this to take, is instead of launching

2869
02:24:05,780 --> 02:24:11,540
it as a gaming thing, launch it as a productivity, a life thing, that the gaming is, oh, then

2870
02:24:11,540 --> 02:24:12,980
the gaming just kind of builds on top of that.

2871
02:24:12,980 --> 02:24:17,380
Well, a lot of people use Unreal Engine 4 as well for building architecture.

2872
02:24:17,380 --> 02:24:22,220
So along with that whole thing we saw for Trimble, where they'd basically be using it

2873
02:24:22,220 --> 02:24:26,540
at the job site to kind of visualize a 3D model or something like that.

2874
02:24:26,540 --> 02:24:30,660
You have a building or something you're designing, I mean, I could see that kind of all tying

2875
02:24:30,660 --> 02:24:31,660
together.

2876
02:24:31,660 --> 02:24:34,420
All right, well, let's go to another type of AR.

2877
02:24:34,420 --> 02:24:36,740
It's very different, but it's still AR.

2878
02:24:36,740 --> 02:24:40,620
It's just a little, it's not quite the same type of technology.

2879
02:24:40,620 --> 02:24:43,060
It's a little bit more scaled back, and that's Pokemon Go.

2880
02:24:43,060 --> 02:24:45,240
I tried using the photo app.

2881
02:24:45,240 --> 02:24:49,140
Which the photo app is, which they call AR mode, is even more augmented reality.

2882
02:24:49,140 --> 02:24:53,640
But the fact that Pokemon Go makes you go to places in the real world to catch Pokemon,

2883
02:24:53,640 --> 02:24:54,640
that is AR.

2884
02:24:54,640 --> 02:24:55,640
Yeah.

2885
02:24:55,640 --> 02:25:02,800
And then when you take a picture with your phone, that's kind of, I don't know, maybe

2886
02:25:02,800 --> 02:25:07,160
Bobby's going to correct me on this, I don't know, but the Pokemon Go picture AR mode,

2887
02:25:07,160 --> 02:25:11,300
that's a good way to know what HoloLens does.

2888
02:25:11,300 --> 02:25:15,560
Because you're still seeing the world the way you would see it, it's just now you see

2889
02:25:15,560 --> 02:25:19,240
cute little Pokemon on your screen that you're trying to throw the ball at and catch.

2890
02:25:19,240 --> 02:25:21,140
Now imagine that right up against your face.

2891
02:25:21,140 --> 02:25:24,040
That's what HoloLens is, basically.

2892
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:25,040
Except it's small.

2893
02:25:25,040 --> 02:25:26,040
Well, yeah.

2894
02:25:26,040 --> 02:25:27,040
But you know what I mean.

2895
02:25:27,040 --> 02:25:28,040
You know what I'm getting at, right?

2896
02:25:28,040 --> 02:25:29,040
Yeah.

2897
02:25:29,040 --> 02:25:30,040
I know what you're getting at.

2898
02:25:30,400 --> 02:25:34,200
But Pokemon Go is doing a new feature that some people have been asking for for a long

2899
02:25:34,200 --> 02:25:37,480
time and it is the ability to change your team.

2900
02:25:37,480 --> 02:25:41,520
So if you are on the yellow team and you're sick of your gyms already getting taken, you

2901
02:25:41,520 --> 02:25:42,980
can now switch to red or blue.

2902
02:25:42,980 --> 02:25:47,680
Or I don't want the Instinct players to hate me because the reality is now maybe some people,

2903
02:25:47,680 --> 02:25:48,680
that will be the appeal for them.

2904
02:25:48,680 --> 02:25:51,160
They're going to want to go to the less popular team.

2905
02:25:51,160 --> 02:25:56,300
I got to admit, I'm given thought about going to yellow team just for the challenge and

2906
02:25:56,300 --> 02:25:58,740
for the fun of being on the underdogs.

2907
02:25:58,740 --> 02:25:59,740
Why not?

2908
02:25:59,740 --> 02:26:01,940
Because there's an Ingress right now in this area, so why not do the same thing?

2909
02:26:01,940 --> 02:26:02,940
What's the matter?

2910
02:26:02,940 --> 02:26:04,940
There's no point to the teams yet anyways.

2911
02:26:04,940 --> 02:26:05,940
Like maybe if you gave...

2912
02:26:05,940 --> 02:26:06,940
The coins.

2913
02:26:06,940 --> 02:26:07,940
The gyms.

2914
02:26:07,940 --> 02:26:08,940
That's it.

2915
02:26:08,940 --> 02:26:09,940
Yeah.

2916
02:26:09,940 --> 02:26:13,220
Maybe you just gave me a purpose of there's some point to the actual teams other than

2917
02:26:13,220 --> 02:26:15,900
collecting coins, which I have quite a few.

2918
02:26:15,900 --> 02:26:16,900
Here's how to do it.

2919
02:26:16,900 --> 02:26:17,900
Here's how to do it.

2920
02:26:17,900 --> 02:26:21,900
So as of next week, February 26 specifically, at 1 p.m. they were going to enable a new

2921
02:26:21,900 --> 02:26:24,500
item in the shop, a team medallion.

2922
02:26:24,500 --> 02:26:29,160
It's going to set you back 1,000 Pokecoins, which conveniently you could buy with real

2923
02:26:29,200 --> 02:26:32,120
world money, which I think is about, it's about 10 bucks.

2924
02:26:32,120 --> 02:26:36,240
Well, no, because you get like more Pokecoins the more you spend, but about, we'll say about

2925
02:26:36,240 --> 02:26:42,760
10 bucks, discounts if you spend more, or you can earn up to 50 coins a day playing

2926
02:26:42,760 --> 02:26:43,760
the gym game.

2927
02:26:43,760 --> 02:26:46,600
Well, yeah, per Pokemon you drop.

2928
02:26:46,600 --> 02:26:48,260
But you're capped out at 50 a day.

2929
02:26:48,260 --> 02:26:50,940
You don't get any more than 50 a day, no matter what.

2930
02:26:50,940 --> 02:26:53,200
If you've earned more, this just happened to me yesterday.

2931
02:26:53,200 --> 02:26:57,520
I got a Pokemon that came back, I got my coins, then when Snorlax or whatever I had at a third

2932
02:26:57,520 --> 02:27:03,280
gym came back and said, Snorlax is back from a hard battle, 50 or maximum daily limit already

2933
02:27:03,280 --> 02:27:04,280
reached.

2934
02:27:04,280 --> 02:27:05,280
So you don't get any more coins.

2935
02:27:05,280 --> 02:27:06,280
So 50 is the most you can get.

2936
02:27:06,280 --> 02:27:09,160
So you do that for 20 days, you'd have a thousand coins.

2937
02:27:09,160 --> 02:27:14,420
But anyway, so, but I mean, they got to pay the server bills and all that stuff somehow.

2938
02:27:14,420 --> 02:27:17,600
So I imagine a lot of people are going to pay for it if they want to switch teams.

2939
02:27:17,600 --> 02:27:20,760
I bet there's a lot of people that don't care and are going to just stay where they're at.

2940
02:27:20,760 --> 02:27:22,320
There is one restriction.

2941
02:27:22,320 --> 02:27:27,840
You can only use this once every 365 days.

2942
02:27:27,840 --> 02:27:33,560
So I'm not sure exactly why they're doing that as a means to prevent some type of like

2943
02:27:33,560 --> 02:27:35,820
maybe trolling or griefing or what have you.

2944
02:27:35,820 --> 02:27:39,660
But they're also saying that if you have any Pokemon in gyms when you switch teams, they

2945
02:27:39,660 --> 02:27:42,480
are returned with no Pokecoins earned.

2946
02:27:42,480 --> 02:27:44,960
You cannot battle your own Pokemon.

2947
02:27:44,960 --> 02:27:48,920
If you return to a gym that one of your Pokemon is defending, your Pokemon is coming back

2948
02:27:48,920 --> 02:27:52,440
to you with no Pokecoins earned.

2949
02:27:52,440 --> 02:27:54,440
So interesting.

2950
02:27:54,440 --> 02:27:59,120
Finally that feature many people have been asking for.

2951
02:27:59,120 --> 02:28:00,120
Let's see.

2952
02:28:00,120 --> 02:28:01,120
Interesting.

2953
02:28:01,120 --> 02:28:04,500
Shane is in chat saying, we could have done more clam pearl research if we were Instinct

2954
02:28:04,500 --> 02:28:06,040
or Valor this weekend.

2955
02:28:06,040 --> 02:28:09,320
All the gyms were blue and people were defending for some reason.

2956
02:28:09,320 --> 02:28:12,000
And we ran into a lot of battle in a gym quest.

2957
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,760
Well, the good news, I mean, I was in a different part of town.

2958
02:28:14,760 --> 02:28:16,120
I went to a place I don't usually go to.

2959
02:28:16,120 --> 02:28:19,960
I went to old downtown Roseville, which I know has a lot of stops.

2960
02:28:19,960 --> 02:28:22,560
And the reason why I went there, I knew they had a lot of portals in Ingress, so I knew

2961
02:28:22,560 --> 02:28:26,440
they have a lot of stops and it's not far from where my dad lives.

2962
02:28:26,440 --> 02:28:29,280
And I had family engagements that same day that was limiting my time.

2963
02:28:29,280 --> 02:28:34,840
So we went down there and luckily there was a pretty even amount because what happened,

2964
02:28:34,840 --> 02:28:38,600
the worst thing that happened to me is that I was fighting a red gym to do one of my like

2965
02:28:38,600 --> 02:28:39,900
battle in a gym things.

2966
02:28:39,900 --> 02:28:43,520
And right as I took it out, I was like, oh, I'll deploy in this gym since I just took

2967
02:28:43,520 --> 02:28:44,560
it anyway.

2968
02:28:44,560 --> 02:28:48,600
And as I tried to deploy a yellow player beat me to it who had been fighting the red player

2969
02:28:48,600 --> 02:28:50,560
at the exact same time.

2970
02:28:50,560 --> 02:28:52,920
And I was like, eh, whatever, no big deal.

2971
02:28:52,920 --> 02:28:58,440
So but yeah, if everybody had been blue up and down the street, then it would have been

2972
02:28:58,440 --> 02:28:59,840
more difficult to finish things.

2973
02:28:59,840 --> 02:29:00,840
Yeah.

2974
02:29:00,840 --> 02:29:04,000
But here's where, you know, you could consider changing your teams so that that won't happen

2975
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:05,060
in the future.

2976
02:29:05,060 --> 02:29:08,880
So anyway, and yeah.

2977
02:29:08,880 --> 02:29:10,520
You know, do your teams really matter?

2978
02:29:10,520 --> 02:29:14,840
Because as she, when her mat and chat says, I'm on team red and my girlfriend's on blue,

2979
02:29:14,840 --> 02:29:18,680
we haven't broken up yet in all seriousness, it works out great being on opposite teams.

2980
02:29:18,680 --> 02:29:22,760
You know, a lot of people that run with multiple accounts don't pick the same team on their

2981
02:29:22,760 --> 02:29:24,200
multiple accounts.

2982
02:29:24,200 --> 02:29:27,720
Not that I'm endorsing that, but the reality is we know a lot of people are doing that

2983
02:29:27,720 --> 02:29:31,680
and they will pick the other color to knock their own Pokemon out of gyms, which is what

2984
02:29:31,680 --> 02:29:32,980
Niantic doesn't want you to do.

2985
02:29:32,980 --> 02:29:33,980
But I don't know.

2986
02:29:33,980 --> 02:29:37,600
Do you think Niantic will ever take steps against multi-accounters and Pokemon go?

2987
02:29:37,600 --> 02:29:38,600
I don't think it's going down.

2988
02:29:38,680 --> 02:29:39,680
No.

2989
02:29:39,680 --> 02:29:42,680
Probably as long as people are spending money, they probably don't give a hoot.

2990
02:29:42,680 --> 02:29:44,680
I don't think they will.

2991
02:29:44,680 --> 02:29:45,680
Yeah.

2992
02:29:45,680 --> 02:29:46,680
All right.

2993
02:29:46,680 --> 02:29:48,520
Anyhow, we've got a few more stories for you guys before we get to Discord.

2994
02:29:48,520 --> 02:29:53,840
But if you want to call in, you might want to make your way over to our Discord at vognetwork.com

2995
02:29:53,840 --> 02:29:58,040
slash Discord and set up in the green room and tell us a little bit about what you want

2996
02:29:58,040 --> 02:30:00,560
to talk about tonight in the Orange Launch Radio channel.

2997
02:30:00,560 --> 02:30:02,560
And we will get to those calls in just a little bit.

2998
02:30:02,560 --> 02:30:04,520
But first, we have this story.

2999
02:30:04,640 --> 02:30:09,480
Yes, how nice of Bethesda to lay out a roadmap of how they're going to fix Fallout 76.

3000
02:30:09,480 --> 02:30:14,200
Because, you know, this is all going to be a huge shit show anyways once we finally get

3001
02:30:14,200 --> 02:30:15,200
there.

3002
02:30:15,200 --> 02:30:17,600
But it's nice to at least see it laid out.

3003
02:30:17,600 --> 02:30:22,080
So what they're going to do for 2019, they've got three different segments.

3004
02:30:22,080 --> 02:30:25,640
So Wild Appalachia, Nuclear Winter, and Wastelanders.

3005
02:30:25,640 --> 02:30:30,760
So Wild Appalachia, they're going to have all new quests, game modes, features, and

3006
02:30:30,760 --> 02:30:37,320
more, including they've added Survival, there's going to be the new game mode, Nuclear Winter

3007
02:30:37,320 --> 02:30:45,120
with Nuclear Winter, the Vault 94, which is a high level Vault Raids, and additional new

3008
02:30:45,120 --> 02:30:46,120
features.

3009
02:30:46,120 --> 02:30:52,400
Wastelanders is going to add a new main quest, new events, and additional new features.

3010
02:30:52,400 --> 02:30:57,000
But I can't help but think they're going to fuck this up somehow because at the same time,

3011
02:30:57,000 --> 02:31:01,360
like just this week, they banned a player.

3012
02:31:01,360 --> 02:31:03,760
Is it just me or is this too fucking late?

3013
02:31:03,760 --> 02:31:04,800
It's too fucking late.

3014
02:31:04,800 --> 02:31:10,040
Like that's, I mean, that's great that they have a plan to fix it and so forth, but isn't

3015
02:31:10,040 --> 02:31:12,400
it too fucking late?

3016
02:31:12,400 --> 02:31:20,880
Or has No Man's Sky and the relative success of its own turnaround shown game companies

3017
02:31:20,880 --> 02:31:23,760
that maybe it's never too fucking late?

3018
02:31:23,760 --> 02:31:26,720
No, I think it's too late.

3019
02:31:26,760 --> 02:31:31,480
I think it's too late because I think people are just fed up with how the game plays.

3020
02:31:31,480 --> 02:31:34,920
But just also it's the constant stream of fuck-ups that they're doing.

3021
02:31:34,920 --> 02:31:39,980
You know, No Man's Sky was just kind of bad from the beginning, but like they were doing

3022
02:31:39,980 --> 02:31:41,480
updates as it went along.

3023
02:31:41,480 --> 02:31:45,520
It just wasn't like they were fucking up every single time that they tried to do something.

3024
02:31:45,520 --> 02:31:51,000
So like, for example, this week they had banned a player who had, they said he had too much

3025
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:58,120
ammunition on him because he had played over like 300 some hours and he has a couple characters

3026
02:31:58,120 --> 02:32:01,740
that he swaps weapons back and forth to try to figure out which weapons he wants to run

3027
02:32:01,740 --> 02:32:03,680
with or main with.

3028
02:32:03,680 --> 02:32:10,200
And I think that he came to the conclusion that they seem to track the ammo that you

3029
02:32:10,200 --> 02:32:13,940
pick up, but not necessarily the ammo that you drop or trade.

3030
02:32:13,940 --> 02:32:18,820
And so because their system calculated it incorrectly, it made it seem like he had like

3031
02:32:18,820 --> 02:32:21,420
an excessive amount of ammo on him.

3032
02:32:21,420 --> 02:32:25,540
And so, of course, you know, a player that is dedicated to the game that's played over,

3033
02:32:25,540 --> 02:32:30,860
you know, several hundred hours into the game, let's ban him because that's that's appropriate

3034
02:32:30,860 --> 02:32:34,600
for one of the people who actually enjoys your game.

3035
02:32:34,600 --> 02:32:36,500
So there's that.

3036
02:32:36,500 --> 02:32:43,300
And then speaking of another game that's not getting such great success, but also is got

3037
02:32:43,300 --> 02:32:48,260
their roadmap in there, Anthem, for example, is talking about what they're going to be

3038
02:32:48,260 --> 02:32:49,860
doing going forward.

3039
02:32:49,860 --> 02:32:55,380
So they've got kind of a roadmap of reoccurring updates, fixes, improvements and optimizations.

3040
02:32:55,380 --> 02:32:58,240
Weekly Alliance, the case of Anthem, like it just came out.

3041
02:32:58,240 --> 02:33:02,380
So it doesn't feel like it's too late, whereas like Fallout kind of already passed the holiday

3042
02:33:02,380 --> 02:33:03,380
period.

3043
02:33:03,380 --> 02:33:04,380
Right.

3044
02:33:04,380 --> 02:33:06,580
But I can't help but look at this and go.

3045
02:33:06,580 --> 02:33:13,540
All those issues I had with Mass Effect Andromeda, where the product was not released the way

3046
02:33:13,540 --> 02:33:16,860
it was truly envisioned in many ways.

3047
02:33:16,860 --> 02:33:21,140
It's like, here we go again in the same thing.

3048
02:33:21,140 --> 02:33:22,140
And here's the thing, too.

3049
02:33:22,140 --> 02:33:26,220
Like it for me, it feels like especially when it's like a game that, you know, you're in

3050
02:33:26,220 --> 02:33:30,980
a they want you to spend a lot of time and stuff, maybe not so much without a monthly

3051
02:33:30,980 --> 02:33:36,540
fee and things, but almost would want to wait until it drops in price even more.

3052
02:33:36,540 --> 02:33:40,480
And they have all these updates done so that it's a little bit more polished.

3053
02:33:40,480 --> 02:33:45,380
But even by then, there'll be another thing that comes out that's more popular, that people

3054
02:33:45,380 --> 02:33:46,940
are just not going to want to waste their time on.

3055
02:33:46,940 --> 02:33:50,060
Apex Legends, the free game, will get that same content.

3056
02:33:50,060 --> 02:33:51,060
Yeah.

3057
02:33:51,060 --> 02:33:57,860
Why should I spend money on a game like Fallout 76 when, for example, right now they're teasing

3058
02:33:57,860 --> 02:34:01,300
on Amazon, there's a Fallout announcement that's going to be made.

3059
02:34:01,300 --> 02:34:05,940
It's most likely going to be probably a remaster of 3 or New Vegas.

3060
02:34:05,940 --> 02:34:12,180
Why the fuck am I going to put drop money in Fallout 76 when I can play a better game?

3061
02:34:12,180 --> 02:34:13,180
And I don't know.

3062
02:34:13,180 --> 02:34:16,980
I just I don't know why I would want to play Fallout 76.

3063
02:34:16,980 --> 02:34:17,980
Let's see.

3064
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:22,780
Going to our chat, Quest Buster says the patches with Fallout 76 have been an unending clown

3065
02:34:22,780 --> 02:34:24,220
car of missteps.

3066
02:34:24,220 --> 02:34:25,220
It's insane.

3067
02:34:25,220 --> 02:34:27,500
Sounds like we need the yackety stacks here.

3068
02:34:27,500 --> 02:34:32,460
The last patch wanted 38 gigs of space, but was only four or five in actual size.

3069
02:34:32,460 --> 02:34:37,300
As John says, if there was a game that ever needed a total reboot like Realm Reborn, it

3070
02:34:37,300 --> 02:34:38,300
was Fallout 76.

3071
02:34:38,300 --> 02:34:41,780
Well, but at the same time, something on Final Fantasy also kind of lives.

3072
02:34:41,780 --> 02:34:46,260
Well, Final Fantasy 14 specifically makes its bread and butter off those monthly fees.

3073
02:34:46,260 --> 02:34:47,260
Right.

3074
02:34:47,260 --> 02:34:48,900
You know, and a reason to keep paying every month.

3075
02:34:48,900 --> 02:34:53,540
I mean, thank God Bethesda didn't try to charge a monthly fee for this game.

3076
02:34:53,540 --> 02:34:56,260
Yeah, it's good for that.

3077
02:34:56,260 --> 02:34:57,260
Yeah.

3078
02:34:57,260 --> 02:34:58,260
So, I mean, we'll see.

3079
02:34:58,260 --> 02:35:01,660
Anthem, on the other hand, is kind of a different case because it is still kind of newer.

3080
02:35:01,660 --> 02:35:05,660
And although it does seem like it's not going to hit that.

3081
02:35:05,660 --> 02:35:06,660
I mean, I don't know.

3082
02:35:06,660 --> 02:35:07,660
We haven't seen the sales figure.

3083
02:35:08,020 --> 02:35:09,020
I just don't know.

3084
02:35:09,020 --> 02:35:11,420
I just know EA set some big expectations for it.

3085
02:35:11,420 --> 02:35:12,420
When they first showed it off.

3086
02:35:12,420 --> 02:35:15,300
I feel like some people are into it, but not six million.

3087
02:35:15,300 --> 02:35:19,420
Just like when they first showed off, it looked cool and then just like my interest just went

3088
02:35:19,420 --> 02:35:20,420
downhill from there.

3089
02:35:20,420 --> 02:35:25,860
It just was kind of like, eh, because it's EA and it's like EA just fucks everything

3090
02:35:25,860 --> 02:35:29,980
up with the way their monetization and just everything in this.

3091
02:35:29,980 --> 02:35:34,460
It seems like this is almost like a cookie cutter type game that they just shoving in

3092
02:35:34,460 --> 02:35:38,740
monetization in and just tons of grind in the game.

3093
02:35:38,740 --> 02:35:43,300
I just, for me, I just knew this was going to happen again.

3094
02:35:43,300 --> 02:35:44,700
Like I knew this was going to happen again.

3095
02:35:44,700 --> 02:35:49,860
And I said this way back when we were first talking about why I was irritated with the

3096
02:35:49,860 --> 02:35:53,180
quarry and arc stuff getting canceled to Mass Effect and all this other stuff and turning

3097
02:35:53,180 --> 02:35:56,140
to this hot new thing that's going to save it as I'm like, it's not going to save anything

3098
02:35:56,140 --> 02:36:00,340
if EA repeats the same mistakes, you know, in this whole thing.

3099
02:36:00,340 --> 02:36:05,820
You know, and I'm I there's a part of me that feels like maybe I owe it to my bio or fandom

3100
02:36:05,820 --> 02:36:06,820
or something to try it.

3101
02:36:06,820 --> 02:36:08,180
But at the same time, no, you don't.

3102
02:36:08,180 --> 02:36:09,180
Exactly.

3103
02:36:09,180 --> 02:36:10,180
Exactly.

3104
02:36:10,180 --> 02:36:11,180
No, I don't.

3105
02:36:11,180 --> 02:36:15,340
Because the other games out there, because it is that argument that we owe it to a company,

3106
02:36:15,340 --> 02:36:18,500
the purchase or stuff, whether it's good or not, will they owe it to us to make a good

3107
02:36:18,500 --> 02:36:19,500
game then?

3108
02:36:19,500 --> 02:36:22,060
Like, you know, you come up.

3109
02:36:22,060 --> 02:36:23,060
It's a business.

3110
02:36:23,060 --> 02:36:27,060
I would want to use the word complete complete game.

3111
02:36:27,060 --> 02:36:30,140
Yes, I think a lot of games, a big difference.

3112
02:36:30,140 --> 02:36:35,300
And I think a lot of games that come out nowadays are not complete products that they just kind

3113
02:36:35,300 --> 02:36:41,140
of do this early access crap where it's not even labeled as early access is just, oh,

3114
02:36:41,140 --> 02:36:42,140
it's incomplete.

3115
02:36:42,140 --> 02:36:45,860
Like even like Battlefield Five had that problem where it came out and there's modes on the

3116
02:36:45,860 --> 02:36:48,400
menu that aren't even accessible yet.

3117
02:36:48,400 --> 02:36:52,180
But isn't it interesting we have that story on Dreams just a little bit ago earlier in

3118
02:36:52,180 --> 02:36:58,780
the show that that now is setting the stage, setting the expectations at that level of

3119
02:36:58,780 --> 02:37:03,020
we're going to charge you thirty dollars for the half done game and tell you up front

3120
02:37:03,020 --> 02:37:05,220
this is the half done game.

3121
02:37:05,220 --> 02:37:06,220
And right.

3122
02:37:06,220 --> 02:37:11,180
And you know, how would how would you felt about Fallout 76 if they had taken that approach?

3123
02:37:11,180 --> 02:37:14,340
Because I'll tell you how I would have felt about Anthem a lot different.

3124
02:37:14,340 --> 02:37:17,840
I would have felt a little bit better about it because they would if at least I would

3125
02:37:17,840 --> 02:37:20,880
my expectations would be lower.

3126
02:37:20,880 --> 02:37:27,820
Also the price point being much lower be something, you know, to look forward to as well.

3127
02:37:27,860 --> 02:37:32,860
The media molecule, though, I have more faith in as far as the games that they produce and

3128
02:37:32,860 --> 02:37:34,340
the quality of their products.

3129
02:37:34,340 --> 02:37:38,440
So I know what I'm getting into with that.

3130
02:37:38,440 --> 02:37:39,440
So I don't know.

3131
02:37:39,440 --> 02:37:44,620
I'm just not really and just what I've seen so far Dreams.

3132
02:37:44,620 --> 02:37:50,640
It's more an interesting concept versus Fallout 76, which is just basically follow for remove

3133
02:37:50,640 --> 02:37:53,460
all the NPCs and try to shoehorn it into an MMO.

3134
02:37:53,460 --> 02:37:55,060
And that just doesn't fucking work.

3135
02:37:55,060 --> 02:37:56,060
All right.

3136
02:37:56,300 --> 02:37:57,860
Well, let's move on because I want to make sure we have time.

3137
02:37:57,860 --> 02:38:00,700
It's almost nine o'clock and I want to make sure we have time to hear from our listeners

3138
02:38:00,700 --> 02:38:01,700
a little bit.

3139
02:38:01,700 --> 02:38:05,500
So let me quickly address this story, which is about the PlayStation Vita.

3140
02:38:05,500 --> 02:38:06,620
And you already knew this.

3141
02:38:06,620 --> 02:38:09,860
The days are winding down for the PlayStation Vita.

3142
02:38:09,860 --> 02:38:16,700
We're almost at the end because the official website for Sony Japan does say that only

3143
02:38:16,700 --> 02:38:20,820
two remaining models, black and aqua blue, that's all that's left.

3144
02:38:20,820 --> 02:38:24,340
And they will no longer be shipped in the coming days.

3145
02:38:24,340 --> 02:38:29,860
So if you want a Vita for collector's purposes or that type of thing, you might want to grab

3146
02:38:29,860 --> 02:38:37,060
one because pretty soon the Vita is going to be officially no more because Sony is ending

3147
02:38:37,060 --> 02:38:38,340
production on them.

3148
02:38:38,340 --> 02:38:44,260
So pour one out for the Vita and I'm sure maybe we'll do another retrospective on that

3149
02:38:44,260 --> 02:38:45,260
a little later.

3150
02:38:45,260 --> 02:38:46,260
I don't know.

3151
02:38:46,260 --> 02:38:50,980
Bobby Blackwell pointing out the cause her I CEO Twitter account was gold this week over

3152
02:38:50,980 --> 02:38:51,980
this.

3153
02:38:51,980 --> 02:38:52,980
I missed that account.

3154
02:38:52,980 --> 02:38:56,980
We came back just for this landmark event because, you know, that parody account kind

3155
02:38:56,980 --> 02:38:57,980
of retired.

3156
02:38:57,980 --> 02:38:58,980
Yeah.

3157
02:38:58,980 --> 02:39:02,980
But I think it comes back for these big, you know, announcements and so forth.

3158
02:39:02,980 --> 02:39:05,860
Anyway, we invite you to participate with our show.

3159
02:39:05,860 --> 02:39:08,620
We use discord to do it.

3160
02:39:08,620 --> 02:39:12,620
Something we're going to be kind of actually like like kind of like an idea or whatever

3161
02:39:12,620 --> 02:39:17,220
that I want to change in the coming weeks, I guess maybe like a thing for the show.

3162
02:39:17,220 --> 02:39:19,780
I know with this point, we usually take phone calls.

3163
02:39:19,780 --> 02:39:20,780
We're going to continue to do that.

3164
02:39:20,780 --> 02:39:21,940
It's not changing.

3165
02:39:21,940 --> 02:39:26,700
But I have noticed that, like, we get a lot of the how do I word this is I don't make

3166
02:39:26,700 --> 02:39:30,060
it sound like I'm upset by this or anything, but we get a lot of the same people to call

3167
02:39:30,060 --> 02:39:31,060
in every year.

3168
02:39:31,060 --> 02:39:32,060
A lot of new callers.

3169
02:39:32,060 --> 02:39:33,060
What's that?

3170
02:39:33,060 --> 02:39:34,060
We don't get a lot.

3171
02:39:34,060 --> 02:39:35,060
We don't get a lot of new callers.

3172
02:39:35,060 --> 02:39:36,060
And that's not bad.

3173
02:39:36,060 --> 02:39:37,060
Like, don't be wrong.

3174
02:39:37,060 --> 02:39:38,060
I love the people that we talk to every week.

3175
02:39:38,060 --> 02:39:40,140
We wouldn't do this segment anymore if I got sick of it.

3176
02:39:40,140 --> 02:39:44,380
But I'm thinking, like, why aren't we getting more new people in here?

3177
02:39:44,380 --> 02:39:47,900
And then I kind of I was kind of thinking I verbalized some of this on Twitter earlier

3178
02:39:47,900 --> 02:39:51,300
and then I kind of got to thinking about, you know, there's a lot of people in this

3179
02:39:51,300 --> 02:39:55,900
day and age that, like, don't like to do customer service and talk on the phone.

3180
02:39:55,900 --> 02:39:59,300
There's a lot of people that, like, they don't want to be called on the phone and talk that

3181
02:39:59,300 --> 02:40:00,300
way.

3182
02:40:00,300 --> 02:40:01,300
They want to text.

3183
02:40:01,300 --> 02:40:04,260
They want to text message or they want to do live Internet chat support or so forth.

3184
02:40:04,260 --> 02:40:10,780
And maybe the reality is, like, for, you know, a show like this, a call in radio show is

3185
02:40:10,780 --> 02:40:14,460
I don't necessarily say a dying format, but maybe a more and more niche format than I

3186
02:40:14,460 --> 02:40:15,780
want to admit.

3187
02:40:15,780 --> 02:40:20,260
So I think what you can see in the coming weeks is I want to invite, like, more varying

3188
02:40:20,260 --> 02:40:24,500
types of participation in the segment so that we do get more diverse people.

3189
02:40:24,500 --> 02:40:25,660
Because I completely get it.

3190
02:40:25,660 --> 02:40:31,500
Like, just like I don't owe Bioware my purchase of Anthem, you don't owe this show a phone

3191
02:40:31,500 --> 02:40:33,220
call just because you listen.

3192
02:40:33,220 --> 02:40:37,060
Y'all know you're always welcome as long as you're going to be a decent, nice person.

3193
02:40:37,060 --> 02:40:40,260
Don't call this show just to be a dick, but I don't think anybody out there is going to

3194
02:40:40,260 --> 02:40:41,260
do that.

3195
02:40:41,260 --> 02:40:42,860
But I think we should also invite other ways.

3196
02:40:42,860 --> 02:40:47,700
So we'll be inviting questions from chat and discussion topics from chat.

3197
02:40:47,700 --> 02:40:50,020
So if you guys have any questions, fill in the time.

3198
02:40:50,020 --> 02:40:51,140
Great thing to do that.

3199
02:40:51,140 --> 02:40:53,440
And I'm going to bring back tweets.

3200
02:40:53,440 --> 02:40:58,340
So the tweets that come in to us every week at Twitter dot com slash O.L.R., we will use

3201
02:40:58,340 --> 02:40:59,940
in this segment.

3202
02:40:59,940 --> 02:41:02,820
So that way I'm not always looking at Loki going, well, the phone's dead.

3203
02:41:02,820 --> 02:41:03,820
Any last minute stories?

3204
02:41:03,820 --> 02:41:05,020
We got anything?

3205
02:41:05,020 --> 02:41:10,180
So we're going to, you know, in the spirit of that, we always have talked about this

3206
02:41:10,180 --> 02:41:11,180
before.

3207
02:41:11,180 --> 02:41:16,500
This show is kind of born of that roundtable discussion at a diner after we were at, you

3208
02:41:16,500 --> 02:41:20,900
know, the arcade playing DDR and then we go back to the diner and talk some shit about

3209
02:41:20,900 --> 02:41:21,900
games.

3210
02:41:21,900 --> 02:41:26,060
I kind of want to just invite everybody to the table in whatever way they feel comfortable

3211
02:41:26,060 --> 02:41:27,060
doing so.

3212
02:41:27,060 --> 02:41:29,860
So if that's through phone calls, cool.

3213
02:41:29,860 --> 02:41:33,060
But if that's through just like one off, like this isn't worth a phone call, but I want

3214
02:41:33,060 --> 02:41:35,380
to know your opinion on that, then cool.

3215
02:41:35,380 --> 02:41:39,140
We can do that, too, as long as it's like somewhat gaming related or at least geek related,

3216
02:41:39,140 --> 02:41:43,220
at least geek related, because obviously tonight we I would expect to ask your questions, right?

3217
02:41:43,220 --> 02:41:44,660
That's fine.

3218
02:41:44,660 --> 02:41:45,940
And then, of course, tweets as well.

3219
02:41:45,940 --> 02:41:48,220
So come on back to Twitter at OLR.

3220
02:41:48,220 --> 02:41:50,860
We will read your tweets throughout the week.

3221
02:41:50,860 --> 02:41:57,140
So anyway, let's see.

3222
02:41:57,140 --> 02:42:02,500
I think they're talking in chat about the whole Skype versus Discord thing as well.

3223
02:42:02,500 --> 02:42:05,700
This is something that would have come up even if we hadn't changed platforms.

3224
02:42:05,700 --> 02:42:11,140
But the reality is Skype technologically was preventing me from doing what we're doing

3225
02:42:11,140 --> 02:42:12,140
here on Twitch.

3226
02:42:12,140 --> 02:42:13,140
So I changed.

3227
02:42:13,140 --> 02:42:14,140
Done.

3228
02:42:14,140 --> 02:42:15,140
All right.

3229
02:42:15,340 --> 02:42:16,340
Let's move on.

3230
02:42:16,340 --> 02:42:19,900
We have a couple of folks in the green room waiting to talk to us.

3231
02:42:19,900 --> 02:42:20,900
So let's get to it.

3232
02:42:20,900 --> 02:42:21,900
Let's get to some of these calls tonight.

3233
02:42:21,900 --> 02:42:22,900
Hi.

3234
02:42:22,900 --> 02:42:23,900
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

3235
02:42:23,900 --> 02:42:24,900
Who's this?

3236
02:42:24,900 --> 02:42:25,900
Hey, this is Akdeft.

3237
02:42:25,900 --> 02:42:26,900
Hey, Akdeft.

3238
02:42:26,900 --> 02:42:27,900
What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

3239
02:42:27,900 --> 02:42:31,460
Well, I want to talk about Pokemon Go.

3240
02:42:31,460 --> 02:42:34,140
Everybody's favorite casual, filthy game.

3241
02:42:34,140 --> 02:42:36,840
What's on your mind about Pokemon Go?

3242
02:42:36,840 --> 02:42:37,840
Everyone's favorite dead game.

3243
02:42:37,840 --> 02:42:38,840
Yes.

3244
02:42:38,840 --> 02:42:44,540
Everyone's favorite dead game that's that's still somehow on the top grossing iTunes charts.

3245
02:42:44,940 --> 02:42:51,580
But anyways, I'm pretty sure you already talked about the Clamperl event, but I want to talk

3246
02:42:51,580 --> 02:42:55,280
about my personal opinions on it.

3247
02:42:55,280 --> 02:43:02,460
And if you remember, I called about the Phoebus event and how a disaster that was.

3248
02:43:02,460 --> 02:43:08,260
Yeah, it was pretty shitty, but I thought this Clamperl one, they improved so much.

3249
02:43:08,260 --> 02:43:09,260
What did you think?

3250
02:43:09,260 --> 02:43:13,740
Yeah, it was way, like way better.

3251
02:43:13,940 --> 02:43:19,220
It was gigantic, learned from all the mistakes they made on the Phoebus event, and they made

3252
02:43:19,220 --> 02:43:24,780
this event way, way more accessible for everyone to do.

3253
02:43:24,780 --> 02:43:29,380
It's almost like once in a while they actually listen to feedback, and it's pretty astounding

3254
02:43:29,380 --> 02:43:31,420
when gaming companies do that.

3255
02:43:31,420 --> 02:43:39,860
Yeah, it was surprising for me because even the shiny rate for this, it was like really

3256
02:43:39,860 --> 02:43:40,860
insane.

3257
02:43:41,060 --> 02:43:47,300
Myself, I got like six shiny Clamperl on the first hour.

3258
02:43:47,300 --> 02:43:51,460
Lucky you, because we went for like about an hour and a half, two hours.

3259
02:43:51,460 --> 02:43:54,860
I got two shiny Clamperls and so did Alan.

3260
02:43:54,860 --> 02:44:03,500
Yeah, and at the end I got like 10 other people that probably played like, again like you,

3261
02:44:03,500 --> 02:44:09,300
an hour and a half or maybe less, got at least one or even up to three.

3262
02:44:09,300 --> 02:44:17,020
So it was a good event, and again, all the special research they made for this were like

3263
02:44:17,020 --> 02:44:21,860
not that difficult because if you remember with the Phoebus event, they were like, oh,

3264
02:44:21,860 --> 02:44:27,800
make 10 nice throws or 15 great throws or do something like really, really insane that

3265
02:44:27,800 --> 02:44:30,180
takes a lot of time.

3266
02:44:30,180 --> 02:44:36,860
And with this event, oh, you have to capture one Psyduck or one Krabby or you have to do

3267
02:44:36,860 --> 02:44:39,460
like only one or two or up.

3268
02:44:39,460 --> 02:44:46,060
I think the most great throws or nice throws was like three or five, I can remember.

3269
02:44:46,060 --> 02:44:47,740
I'll tell you exactly what it was.

3270
02:44:47,740 --> 02:44:55,220
It was three nice curve balls in a row because that was the one I kept fucking up and I got

3271
02:44:55,220 --> 02:44:57,260
really frustrated.

3272
02:44:57,260 --> 02:45:00,860
So yeah, it was three nights, but I mean, it's reasonable.

3273
02:45:00,860 --> 02:45:06,100
It was frustrating, but like trying to get past a difficult level in a platformer and

3274
02:45:06,100 --> 02:45:11,080
eventually you do it frustrating, not like I'm going to throw my phone into the ocean

3275
02:45:11,080 --> 02:45:12,080
frustrating.

3276
02:45:12,080 --> 02:45:13,080
Yeah.

3277
02:45:13,080 --> 02:45:14,080
Yeah.

3278
02:45:14,080 --> 02:45:19,680
Some were like kind of not difficult, but time consuming because yeah, they were the

3279
02:45:19,680 --> 02:45:23,500
ones like battling a gym or do a raid even.

3280
02:45:23,500 --> 02:45:29,500
But even those, they were not like really, really hard to do because you just like have

3281
02:45:29,500 --> 02:45:36,020
to find either a group or a simple like double one or two raid and maybe even a level three

3282
02:45:36,020 --> 02:45:38,820
one if you can do those.

3283
02:45:38,820 --> 02:45:45,020
But still that the event was like really great and I'm amazed they learn from their mistakes

3284
02:45:45,020 --> 02:45:50,540
because we both know Niantic and how they can screw up things like really bad.

3285
02:45:50,540 --> 02:45:53,340
They still do.

3286
02:45:53,340 --> 02:45:57,660
But when something good like this happens, when they have to be commended for something

3287
02:45:57,660 --> 02:46:04,580
like this, yeah, I really have to thank Niantic for this type of events and hopefully they

3288
02:46:04,580 --> 02:46:10,500
will probably add more or do more stuff like, like even with the next community day that

3289
02:46:10,500 --> 02:46:16,680
it's going to be like a global same time event, not necessarily everyone at the same time,

3290
02:46:16,680 --> 02:46:22,360
but the same time for everyone instead like different time hours or zones.

3291
02:46:22,360 --> 02:46:25,820
So that's also going to be like really, really great too.

3292
02:46:25,820 --> 02:46:32,500
I think the best event they did in Pokemon Go so far was the December community day because

3293
02:46:32,500 --> 02:46:36,980
it was the Encore one and the key thing about it that made it great is that it went all

3294
02:46:36,980 --> 02:46:43,880
weekend long, but there were still some heightened perks for a three hour window to draw people

3295
02:46:43,880 --> 02:46:46,900
out to play in that specific three hour window.

3296
02:46:46,900 --> 02:46:51,460
But if you miss that window, oh, well, you missed some XP boosts, some walking credits,

3297
02:46:51,460 --> 02:46:55,740
some lures, those types of things, but you'd still catch all the shinies and all the Pokemons

3298
02:46:55,740 --> 02:46:58,180
and the things that were like the must haves.

3299
02:46:58,180 --> 02:47:01,420
So I think that's the one thing is that it seems like these arbitrary times that they

3300
02:47:01,420 --> 02:47:04,120
pick, like they don't always work for everybody.

3301
02:47:04,120 --> 02:47:08,260
So Niantic really needs to think about, like, I understand they wanted, if they were to

3302
02:47:08,260 --> 02:47:13,260
do a community day all weekend long, they couldn't get those photo ops of people all

3303
02:47:13,260 --> 02:47:15,100
in one place at the same time.

3304
02:47:15,100 --> 02:47:16,820
That's what they're kind of trying to do.

3305
02:47:16,820 --> 02:47:22,540
But I think they really need to think about like, could we do like Saturday or Sunday,

3306
02:47:22,540 --> 02:47:25,060
pick one and that's the one you're stuck doing.

3307
02:47:25,060 --> 02:47:27,740
You can't do both like that type of thing.

3308
02:47:27,940 --> 02:47:34,380
And that technology exists within Niantic and within Pokemon Go because Pokemon Go Fest,

3309
02:47:34,380 --> 02:47:38,740
you had to buy a ticket to that, you had to buy Saturday or Sunday, and only once your

3310
02:47:38,740 --> 02:47:43,100
ticket was like redeemed in the system, could you see those Pokemon spawns in the park.

3311
02:47:43,100 --> 02:47:47,320
If you tried to go to the park on a day that your ticket wasn't for, you didn't see them.

3312
02:47:47,320 --> 02:47:53,180
So I think that would be my idea is that maybe Niantic should offer choices.

3313
02:47:53,180 --> 02:47:58,460
Like here's three community event times, pick one, but once you do it, you're stuck

3314
02:47:58,460 --> 02:48:02,260
with that time and that's the only three.

3315
02:48:02,260 --> 02:48:06,700
So that way the people that are like, I'm going to go out and catch 47 shinies during

3316
02:48:06,700 --> 02:48:10,060
the weekend, because I feel like that's what Shane would actually do if the times were

3317
02:48:10,060 --> 02:48:11,420
available.

3318
02:48:11,420 --> 02:48:16,860
It kind of lessens those power players from being able to play way more than like, you

3319
02:48:16,860 --> 02:48:21,460
know, the three hour period, which is a reasonable amount of time to binge Pokemon Go.

3320
02:48:21,460 --> 02:48:25,380
I think you should pick one and stick with it and encourage people to sync up and pick

3321
02:48:25,380 --> 02:48:27,260
the window that works for them.

3322
02:48:27,260 --> 02:48:31,020
Yeah, that would actually be like really, really great.

3323
02:48:31,020 --> 02:48:34,940
I think they do this for the Safari zones too.

3324
02:48:34,940 --> 02:48:39,660
So yeah, it's not like impossible for them to do it.

3325
02:48:39,660 --> 02:48:44,620
So yeah, it would actually like be nice to have like that choice.

3326
02:48:44,620 --> 02:48:50,820
Like if you, you can only do Sunday at a certain time or you can only do Saturday at a certain

3327
02:48:50,820 --> 02:48:56,980
time, that would be like a really, really great like option and you can probably like

3328
02:48:56,980 --> 02:49:06,620
plan with your team or with friends to, oh, we're going to do Saturday at 3 p.m. or we're

3329
02:49:06,620 --> 02:49:10,620
going to do Sunday at 10, I don't know.

3330
02:49:10,620 --> 02:49:15,940
And you can organize that way too and have like really, really great experience because

3331
02:49:15,940 --> 02:49:21,460
even with the system like it is now, you really have a good time.

3332
02:49:21,460 --> 02:49:27,660
I really enjoy this community events like they are right now, but having that option

3333
02:49:27,660 --> 02:49:31,060
would be like really better for everyone at all.

3334
02:49:31,060 --> 02:49:32,060
Yeah.

3335
02:49:32,060 --> 02:49:35,900
So yeah, I think these are some good ideas, but at least Niantic is kind of like, they're

3336
02:49:35,900 --> 02:49:38,240
not like hell bent on sticking with their old way.

3337
02:49:38,240 --> 02:49:39,980
They are trying some new things.

3338
02:49:39,980 --> 02:49:43,620
So I'll give them some credit for that, especially when it came to the Go Festival.

3339
02:49:43,620 --> 02:49:47,500
Like my understanding is last year, everybody I talked to who went this last year in 2018

3340
02:49:47,500 --> 02:49:48,660
had a great time.

3341
02:49:48,660 --> 02:49:56,220
People who in 2017, not so much, but it sounds like they really like implemented that feedback

3342
02:49:56,220 --> 02:49:58,420
and made it a stronger, better event.

3343
02:49:58,420 --> 02:50:01,380
I just kind of wish they did more of those type of events.

3344
02:50:01,380 --> 02:50:07,720
Like surely there's got to be a way for Niantic to like, no, these are the top 500 cities

3345
02:50:07,720 --> 02:50:13,460
in the world and have a small team of people for a couple of days, go to these 500 cities

3346
02:50:13,460 --> 02:50:17,780
and look like where's the, where would be a good place to like, where's a big park that's

3347
02:50:17,780 --> 02:50:21,500
dense with stops that we could have like an event like to really kind of draw people to

3348
02:50:21,500 --> 02:50:22,500
the same place.

3349
02:50:22,500 --> 02:50:26,060
Or could they have it like, you know, even incorporate something like how they do those

3350
02:50:26,060 --> 02:50:31,300
um, EX raids or whatever, where you get an invite to go to a specific park and you go

3351
02:50:31,300 --> 02:50:36,060
check in at the, you know, the, that would be some cool features to explore.

3352
02:50:36,060 --> 02:50:40,260
But anyway, I don't want to turn this into a Pokemon Go podcast, but I think, cause there's

3353
02:50:40,260 --> 02:50:43,440
lots of great ones already out there, but, um, I think these are great ideas and great

3354
02:50:43,440 --> 02:50:46,760
examples and a lot of us are still trucking along on Pokemon Go.

3355
02:50:46,760 --> 02:50:48,580
So all right.

3356
02:50:48,580 --> 02:50:54,080
And I suggest everyone just like a final word, uh, to check it out, uh, even if you don't

3357
02:50:54,080 --> 02:51:00,000
like play like religiously, the game has like improved a lot in the last year.

3358
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:05,440
So again, I really, really suggest everyone that has played Pokemon Go and dropped it

3359
02:51:05,440 --> 02:51:06,880
or even hasn't tried it yet.

3360
02:51:06,880 --> 02:51:08,480
It's a, it's a good social game.

3361
02:51:08,480 --> 02:51:11,000
Like, uh, like I really, really recommend it.

3362
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:12,000
All right.

3363
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:13,260
That's a strong recommendation.

3364
02:51:13,300 --> 02:51:15,820
I'm going to let you go to try and squeeze in one more call here.

3365
02:51:15,820 --> 02:51:17,140
So thanks so much for the call though.

3366
02:51:17,140 --> 02:51:18,620
Hey, thanks for having me.

3367
02:51:18,620 --> 02:51:19,620
All right.

3368
02:51:19,620 --> 02:51:20,620
Anytime.

3369
02:51:20,620 --> 02:51:21,620
Take care.

3370
02:51:21,620 --> 02:51:22,620
All right.

3371
02:51:22,620 --> 02:51:23,620
Let's see if we can get to one more call here.

3372
02:51:23,620 --> 02:51:24,620
Hi.

3373
02:51:24,620 --> 02:51:25,620
You're on Orange Lawns Radio.

3374
02:51:25,620 --> 02:51:26,620
Who's this?

3375
02:51:26,620 --> 02:51:27,620
Hello.

3376
02:51:27,620 --> 02:51:28,620
You're on Orange Lawns Radio.

3377
02:51:28,620 --> 02:51:29,620
Who is it?

3378
02:51:29,620 --> 02:51:30,620
Oh, sorry.

3379
02:51:30,620 --> 02:51:33,780
I hit, I hit you on mute accidentally.

3380
02:51:33,780 --> 02:51:34,780
That's okay.

3381
02:51:34,780 --> 02:51:35,780
I know you've been waiting a little bit.

3382
02:51:35,780 --> 02:51:36,780
Who is it?

3383
02:51:36,780 --> 02:51:38,300
It's on Metal Mayhem.

3384
02:51:38,300 --> 02:51:39,300
Cool.

3385
02:51:39,300 --> 02:51:42,060
Just always, I always have to have you introduce yourself cause you never know who's listening

3386
02:51:42,060 --> 02:51:43,060
for the first time.

3387
02:51:43,060 --> 02:51:44,060
Uh, what's on your mind tonight?

3388
02:51:44,060 --> 02:51:46,260
I want to take your, uh, first topic here.

3389
02:51:46,260 --> 02:51:50,540
You mentioned in the chat because I'm a little pressed for time, but I'm curious of this

3390
02:51:50,540 --> 02:51:52,660
question behind your first topic here.

3391
02:51:52,660 --> 02:52:05,380
All right, well, has there been any game or games that you know is a total nuclear turd

3392
02:52:05,380 --> 02:52:09,420
for some strange reason you love it anyway?

3393
02:52:09,420 --> 02:52:10,940
I love this question.

3394
02:52:10,940 --> 02:52:11,940
Yes.

3395
02:52:12,060 --> 02:52:19,700
It's a game called Dance Dance Revolution and it's so good that we created a whole show

3396
02:52:19,700 --> 02:52:25,260
that's persisted for 16 years about it because let's be real, I don't think the game reviews

3397
02:52:25,260 --> 02:52:28,260
for Dance Dance Revolution were ever really that good.

3398
02:52:28,260 --> 02:52:30,440
Uh, but here we are.

3399
02:52:30,440 --> 02:52:32,500
So that's my number one answer.

3400
02:52:32,500 --> 02:52:36,900
But if we want to take a step back from that obvious answer, how about you, Loki, a guilty

3401
02:52:36,900 --> 02:52:37,900
pleasure.

3402
02:52:37,900 --> 02:52:38,900
I already know your answer.

3403
02:52:38,900 --> 02:52:39,900
God.

3404
02:52:39,900 --> 02:52:40,900
I already know it's Earth Defense Force.

3405
02:52:40,900 --> 02:52:45,220
Earth Defense Force is a guilty pleasure game where it's, you know, why or Twisted Metal.

3406
02:52:45,220 --> 02:52:48,820
Well, I guess people actually, I guess if we want to pick another obscure one, that's

3407
02:52:48,820 --> 02:52:50,700
a guilty pleasure game.

3408
02:52:50,700 --> 02:52:53,980
It would be Gals Panic, the arcade game.

3409
02:52:53,980 --> 02:52:54,980
Oh yeah.

3410
02:52:54,980 --> 02:52:55,980
Oh yeah.

3411
02:52:55,980 --> 02:52:57,820
You do like the, you sit down and play that.

3412
02:52:57,820 --> 02:52:58,820
Yes.

3413
02:52:58,820 --> 02:53:03,420
So it's the, um, I wouldn't even really call it hentai, but it's like, it's just an anime

3414
02:53:03,420 --> 02:53:10,060
puzzle game, but it's semi lewd anime puzzle game, I guess, but it's not really me.

3415
02:53:10,060 --> 02:53:11,060
It's an arcade game.

3416
02:53:11,060 --> 02:53:16,500
It wasn't like, you know, Miss Nude World or something like that, um, that one.

3417
02:53:16,500 --> 02:53:19,060
And there was the 3D one as well.

3418
02:53:19,060 --> 02:53:23,340
That was, I don't remember the name of it though, but there's a 3D one.

3419
02:53:23,340 --> 02:53:26,500
It's basically the same type of thing as well.

3420
02:53:26,500 --> 02:53:31,740
Um, and the name is just escaping me right now, but Gals Panic, yes.

3421
02:53:31,740 --> 02:53:35,500
I'm looking at my phone to see if I have any guilty pleasure phone games.

3422
02:53:35,500 --> 02:53:37,500
Oh, that Disney emoji blitz.

3423
02:53:37,500 --> 02:53:41,060
I stopped playing it finally, but I was super into that for a little bit.

3424
02:53:41,060 --> 02:53:44,700
So maybe like something like Tsum Tsum, cause it's like a match three game, but it's still

3425
02:53:44,700 --> 02:53:46,140
really adorable and fun.

3426
02:53:46,140 --> 02:53:48,180
And yeah, I like playing that in the arcades.

3427
02:53:48,180 --> 02:53:49,180
I don't know.

3428
02:53:49,180 --> 02:53:52,380
Like I'm also tempted to just be, be sassy and say Pokemon go.

3429
02:53:52,380 --> 02:53:54,340
That's the answer here.

3430
02:53:54,340 --> 02:53:58,100
You know, again, there's a lot of ways I think people would make that game better, but I

3431
02:53:58,100 --> 02:53:59,100
can't stop playing it.

3432
02:53:59,100 --> 02:54:02,060
And to some extent, Ingress would be an answer for that as well, I think.

3433
02:54:02,060 --> 02:54:06,140
Uh, but Metal Mayhem, you know, I'm going to turn the tables on you.

3434
02:54:06,140 --> 02:54:10,020
It's your guilty pleasure game that everybody says is crap, but you can't help but love

3435
02:54:10,020 --> 02:54:11,020
it anyway.

3436
02:54:11,020 --> 02:54:19,860
I'll go with the obvious one, two words, two.

3437
02:54:19,860 --> 02:54:28,700
That game is so bad, so distasteful, the game was even made, but for some strange reason,

3438
02:54:28,700 --> 02:54:30,260
I can't stop playing it.

3439
02:54:30,260 --> 02:54:32,300
Wait, one game, what game did you say?

3440
02:54:32,300 --> 02:54:36,860
I think, I think, am I crazy or did discord or maybe discord dropped out at just the wrong

3441
02:54:36,860 --> 02:54:37,860
time.

3442
02:54:37,860 --> 02:54:38,860
You said I have two words for you.

3443
02:54:38,860 --> 02:54:39,860
And then all I heard was two.

3444
02:54:39,860 --> 02:54:44,820
What, what's the game postal to, uh, to, Oh, okay.

3445
02:54:44,820 --> 02:54:48,500
So, so the word postal didn't come through, which I thought he said, I got two words for

3446
02:54:48,500 --> 02:54:49,500
you.

3447
02:54:49,500 --> 02:54:53,060
It's two, the number two, what are the words?

3448
02:54:53,060 --> 02:54:54,060
Okay.

3449
02:54:54,060 --> 02:54:55,060
Postal two.

3450
02:54:55,060 --> 02:54:56,060
Yes.

3451
02:54:56,060 --> 02:54:57,060
That game is absolute garbage.

3452
02:54:57,060 --> 02:54:58,060
And so is the movie, but I get it.

3453
02:54:58,060 --> 02:54:59,060
I get it.

3454
02:54:59,060 --> 02:55:01,380
People can't help it anyway.

3455
02:55:01,380 --> 02:55:02,380
Yeah.

3456
02:55:02,380 --> 02:55:03,380
Yeah.

3457
02:55:03,380 --> 02:55:08,140
Like I was saying, yes, that game was in bad taste.

3458
02:55:08,140 --> 02:55:14,180
It's a really shitty game, but I couldn't, could not put the game down.

3459
02:55:14,180 --> 02:55:19,300
Um, was it, was it your wife or who was it that actually liked dead or alive, extreme

3460
02:55:19,300 --> 02:55:20,300
beach volleyball?

3461
02:55:20,300 --> 02:55:21,300
No, it wasn't my wife.

3462
02:55:21,300 --> 02:55:22,300
She's never seen that game.

3463
02:55:22,300 --> 02:55:24,420
I thought there's somebody that was in melody.

3464
02:55:24,420 --> 02:55:28,900
Maybe somebody affiliated with a show that was like that was their guilty pleasure game

3465
02:55:28,900 --> 02:55:32,300
because again, those games are, they're, they're not great games.

3466
02:55:32,300 --> 02:55:34,220
We all know what those games are about.

3467
02:55:34,220 --> 02:55:38,860
Um, but, um, I, I remember there was distinctly, there was some, or goats simulator.

3468
02:55:38,860 --> 02:55:39,860
I like goats.

3469
02:55:39,860 --> 02:55:42,780
There was a girl gamer who said that that was the guilty pleasure game because it was

3470
02:55:42,780 --> 02:55:43,780
all the dress up and all this.

3471
02:55:43,780 --> 02:55:44,980
I can't remember who said that.

3472
02:55:44,980 --> 02:55:46,860
Maybe it was princess Irene years ago.

3473
02:55:46,860 --> 02:55:48,740
I think she would've said, I don't know.

3474
02:55:48,740 --> 02:55:52,580
Anyway, so I don't want to, but I don't want to attribute things to people that didn't

3475
02:55:52,580 --> 02:55:53,580
actually say them either.

3476
02:55:53,580 --> 02:55:55,260
So I will just leave it as I don't remember.

3477
02:55:55,260 --> 02:55:57,300
Um, but anyway, great question.

3478
02:55:57,300 --> 02:55:59,220
I, I'm curious for the chat as well.

3479
02:55:59,220 --> 02:56:01,660
I'll read some of the chat answers here in a minute, but a metal mayhem.

3480
02:56:01,660 --> 02:56:02,660
Thanks for the call.

3481
02:56:02,660 --> 02:56:03,660
As always.

3482
02:56:03,660 --> 02:56:04,660
I really appreciate it.

3483
02:56:04,660 --> 02:56:05,660
I have a good one.

3484
02:56:05,660 --> 02:56:06,660
You too.

3485
02:56:06,660 --> 02:56:07,660
All right.

3486
02:56:07,660 --> 02:56:08,660
Uh, that's going to do it for the discord calls tonight.

3487
02:56:08,660 --> 02:56:10,660
Um, but if you didn't get in, uh, I'm sorry.

3488
02:56:10,660 --> 02:56:15,580
You can always send an email or tweet participate at orange lounge, radio.com or of course you

3489
02:56:15,580 --> 02:56:22,340
can always tweet us at O L R. Um, K art says, wait, is postal still banned in Australia?

3490
02:56:22,340 --> 02:56:23,340
Pro?

3491
02:56:23,340 --> 02:56:25,340
I don't think games really get unbanned.

3492
02:56:25,340 --> 02:56:26,340
Do they?

3493
02:56:26,340 --> 02:56:27,340
Maybe a long time later.

3494
02:56:27,340 --> 02:56:28,340
Sometimes.

3495
02:56:28,340 --> 02:56:29,340
Yeah.

3496
02:56:29,340 --> 02:56:30,340
I don't.

3497
02:56:30,340 --> 02:56:31,900
I mean, were there any, any efforts to try to unban it?

3498
02:56:31,900 --> 02:56:34,020
It's probably one of those things where it's like, it's not, they're not exactly going

3499
02:56:34,020 --> 02:56:37,840
to haul you to jail for playing it, but they don't exactly sell it in stores.

3500
02:56:37,840 --> 02:56:44,580
So people are probably anyone sells postal to in the stores or no, not at this point

3501
02:56:44,580 --> 02:56:45,580
anymore.

3502
02:56:45,580 --> 02:56:46,580
Um, let's see.

3503
02:56:46,580 --> 02:56:49,740
Uh, Shane and chat says, I kind of want that Tsum Tsum switch game.

3504
02:56:49,740 --> 02:56:50,740
Not going to lie.

3505
02:56:50,740 --> 02:56:51,740
Me too.

3506
02:56:51,740 --> 02:56:52,740
Actually.

3507
02:56:53,140 --> 02:56:55,860
S two 100 Matt says I was on a road trip this weekend and went to a town where they use

3508
02:56:55,860 --> 02:56:58,320
Slack to communicate in the community.

3509
02:56:58,320 --> 02:56:59,320
So strange.

3510
02:56:59,320 --> 02:57:00,420
It must be a Pokemon go thing.

3511
02:57:00,420 --> 02:57:01,420
Why not?

3512
02:57:01,420 --> 02:57:04,340
Slack is hard because you have to invite to Slack.

3513
02:57:04,340 --> 02:57:10,460
We use Slack for ingress, but that's because with the whole espionage and secrecy, you

3514
02:57:10,460 --> 02:57:13,000
have to be in a secure environment for that stuff.

3515
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:14,420
Discord isn't as good for that stuff.

3516
02:57:14,420 --> 02:57:15,420
Yeah.

3517
02:57:15,420 --> 02:57:19,060
Um, although there's been talk about use because the voice integration and discord is pretty

3518
02:57:19,060 --> 02:57:20,060
great.

3519
02:57:20,380 --> 02:57:25,220
Um, yeah, I thought most Pokemon go communities use discord plus Slack is really limited.

3520
02:57:25,220 --> 02:57:26,220
I don't know.

3521
02:57:26,220 --> 02:57:27,220
Anyway.

3522
02:57:27,220 --> 02:57:28,620
Um, let's see.

3523
02:57:28,620 --> 02:57:32,740
And also, uh, fifth dream today confirming I know three or four women who love all the

3524
02:57:32,740 --> 02:57:35,140
dead or alive games, including X.

3525
02:57:35,140 --> 02:57:36,140
Why not?

3526
02:57:36,140 --> 02:57:37,140
Why not?

3527
02:57:37,140 --> 02:57:40,060
Uh, and Miltonia's game says people don't like doom three, but I have played it many

3528
02:57:40,060 --> 02:57:41,060
times.

3529
02:57:41,060 --> 02:57:42,060
Yeah.

3530
02:57:42,060 --> 02:57:43,060
That was the one.

3531
02:57:43,060 --> 02:57:44,060
It was like, it was on the X-Box original X-Box, right?

3532
02:57:44,060 --> 02:57:47,060
I actually own that cause I liked the old doom games and yeah, I just remember it being

3533
02:57:47,060 --> 02:57:49,220
like, I played that game going, it's too dark.

3534
02:57:49,380 --> 02:57:50,780
I didn't see anything in this game.

3535
02:57:50,780 --> 02:57:51,780
Yeah.

3536
02:57:51,780 --> 02:57:52,780
Anyway.

3537
02:57:52,780 --> 02:57:53,780
All right.

3538
02:57:53,780 --> 02:57:56,780
That brings us about to the close of another episode of orange lounge radio.

3539
02:57:56,780 --> 02:57:57,780
I'm checking in.

3540
02:57:57,780 --> 02:57:59,380
Did you have any last minute stories?

3541
02:57:59,380 --> 02:58:00,380
Loki?

3542
02:58:00,380 --> 02:58:01,380
Yes.

3543
02:58:01,380 --> 02:58:05,220
I did have a quick little thing and that is that there apparently there's some indie developers,

3544
02:58:05,220 --> 02:58:10,980
Billy laws and max Keller have got, um, a rough version of Android Q running on the

3545
02:58:10,980 --> 02:58:11,980
switch.

3546
02:58:11,980 --> 02:58:13,500
Thanks to home brew.

3547
02:58:13,500 --> 02:58:18,380
So, of course, home brew is going to home brew.

3548
02:58:18,540 --> 02:58:23,820
So yeah, that it, how, how useful it is.

3549
02:58:23,820 --> 02:58:24,820
I don't know.

3550
02:58:24,820 --> 02:58:27,420
I still have, I have a switch mod chip.

3551
02:58:27,420 --> 02:58:31,700
I just never planned to use it at some point.

3552
02:58:31,700 --> 02:58:36,660
I could use it for something, but yeah, probably end up losing it before I end up using it.

3553
02:58:36,660 --> 02:58:37,660
All right.

3554
02:58:37,660 --> 02:58:39,220
Any other last minute stories for us tonight?

3555
02:58:39,220 --> 02:58:40,220
That's all I got.

3556
02:58:40,220 --> 02:58:41,220
All right.

3557
02:58:41,220 --> 02:58:42,220
I guess that's time for us to wrap up then.

3558
02:58:42,220 --> 02:58:46,500
So I thank you guys again, as always for tuning into another episode of orange lounge radio,

3559
02:58:46,500 --> 02:58:51,500
whether you were here live watching us, whether you were watching us on demand on our, the

3560
02:58:51,500 --> 02:58:55,540
Twitch library over at VOG network, or you were listening on our podcast feed, however

3561
02:58:55,540 --> 02:58:58,860
you are participating with this show, we thank you so much for spending your time with us

3562
02:58:58,860 --> 02:58:59,860
this week.

3563
02:58:59,860 --> 02:59:03,500
All we ask here at orange lounge radio, um, is please help us spread the word.

3564
02:59:03,500 --> 02:59:07,060
We're the show where every gamer has a voice, but, uh, you know, that we need more voices

3565
02:59:07,060 --> 02:59:10,740
here to get more opinions and more perspectives on things.

3566
02:59:10,740 --> 02:59:14,580
So please tell a friend or two about the show, um, help us spread the word that way.

3567
02:59:15,140 --> 02:59:19,500
Um, and a nice five star review on a site like iTunes goes a long, long way.

3568
02:59:19,500 --> 02:59:21,900
And this is one I need to start putting out there more often too.

3569
02:59:21,900 --> 02:59:25,220
You hear me say the same thing at the end of every show, but this one is really important

3570
02:59:25,220 --> 02:59:26,220
too.

3571
02:59:26,220 --> 02:59:29,900
Your hosts on Twitch are so, so good.

3572
02:59:29,900 --> 02:59:35,060
So if you consider, um, hosting us and putting us on your auto host list, that would be fantastic.

3573
02:59:35,060 --> 02:59:37,620
Um, that stuff goes a real long way.

3574
02:59:37,620 --> 02:59:39,460
So that please consider it.

3575
02:59:39,460 --> 02:59:42,300
I mean, but if you don't, we're still going to keep going with the show as long as we

3576
02:59:42,300 --> 02:59:43,300
got it in us.

3577
02:59:43,300 --> 02:59:44,780
So, uh, appreciate it anyway.

3578
02:59:44,780 --> 02:59:46,980
Um, I guess that's, that's it.

3579
02:59:46,980 --> 02:59:49,940
So I guess now we go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

3580
02:59:49,940 --> 02:59:51,660
Um, I'll start tonight.

3581
02:59:51,660 --> 02:59:56,260
My final thought is even though my experiences were kind of varied, I look forward to playing

3582
02:59:56,260 --> 02:59:57,260
more apex legends.

3583
02:59:57,260 --> 03:00:01,380
I think that's going to be interesting, but I'm really looking forward to more fantasy

3584
03:00:01,380 --> 03:00:02,380
star online.

3585
03:00:02,380 --> 03:00:06,180
So stay tuned to my personal stream at Rob Roberts here on Twitch.

3586
03:00:06,180 --> 03:00:10,620
I'm going to be doing some more, uh, fantasy star online, and I'm sure my good pal Delvin

3587
03:00:10,620 --> 03:00:14,180
out there at VG realness will also be streaming as well.

3588
03:00:14,180 --> 03:00:16,740
And, you know, I like to give him promotion as well.

3589
03:00:16,740 --> 03:00:21,420
Uh, I also look forward to welcoming dark soccer back in studio full time next week.

3590
03:00:21,420 --> 03:00:22,420
Yes.

3591
03:00:22,420 --> 03:00:24,420
I was hoping to stream some this week.

3592
03:00:24,420 --> 03:00:29,140
I didn't get a chance to, um, because I was cooking like a lot this week.

3593
03:00:29,140 --> 03:00:33,580
So I, you know, get home and then I have all this time to cook and I didn't have, I only

3594
03:00:33,580 --> 03:00:35,680
have a finite amount of time to do things.

3595
03:00:35,680 --> 03:00:38,420
So, um, I don't know if I'm going to be doing it.

3596
03:00:38,460 --> 03:00:41,460
I know I have to cook at least one or two days this week.

3597
03:00:41,460 --> 03:00:44,660
Um, I do want to do some more streaming.

3598
03:00:44,660 --> 03:00:46,140
Maybe I'll do some more DDR.

3599
03:00:46,140 --> 03:00:48,740
I need to get step mania up and running at some point.

3600
03:00:48,740 --> 03:00:53,940
I have the PZ to do it and I've got, I don't have the theme done, but I may just forego

3601
03:00:53,940 --> 03:00:57,060
that and just put something together just to get it on the machine.

3602
03:00:57,060 --> 03:00:59,420
Um, it's all the mess around with that.

3603
03:00:59,420 --> 03:01:03,340
But yeah, if you guys are interested in how like my machines modded, I'm not really modded,

3604
03:01:03,340 --> 03:01:05,740
but I need to go and clean the pads again.

3605
03:01:05,780 --> 03:01:10,300
I don't know how interesting of a stream that would be, but I do need to do that at some

3606
03:01:10,300 --> 03:01:11,300
point.

3607
03:01:11,300 --> 03:01:13,540
And be sure to promote your Twitch again, cause somebody just asked.

3608
03:01:13,540 --> 03:01:17,300
Yes, uh, twitch.tv slash Loki O L R.

3609
03:01:17,300 --> 03:01:22,060
Um, unfortunately I'm not regular in my streaming stuff.

3610
03:01:22,060 --> 03:01:28,340
It's usually around six o'clock, um, six 30 to like seven or eight or whatever.

3611
03:01:28,340 --> 03:01:31,580
Um, the regular streaming thing is really hard for me too.

3612
03:01:31,620 --> 03:01:36,340
That's why I save all my streams so that actually that fantasy star one got a lot like, well

3613
03:01:36,340 --> 03:01:40,300
not like a ton of views, but like it was like probably more people watching it after the

3614
03:01:40,300 --> 03:01:41,300
fact that we're watching a lot.

3615
03:01:41,300 --> 03:01:42,300
Yeah.

3616
03:01:42,300 --> 03:01:45,700
I'm surprised on like some of my views on stuff, um, like anybody's interest.

3617
03:01:45,700 --> 03:01:49,180
I think as more and more people are getting jaded with YouTube, I think, I think a Twitch

3618
03:01:49,180 --> 03:01:51,580
is very smart to get into that video on demand stuff.

3619
03:01:51,580 --> 03:01:52,580
So good for them.

3620
03:01:52,580 --> 03:01:53,580
Yeah.

3621
03:01:53,580 --> 03:01:54,580
I don't know.

3622
03:01:54,580 --> 03:01:58,180
But yeah, you can always go and watch my old, um, stuff and I am, like I said, I did crack

3623
03:01:58,180 --> 03:01:59,180
down three the other day.

3624
03:01:59,180 --> 03:02:02,340
I can't really stream that again because I'm already done with the game and it's kind

3625
03:02:02,340 --> 03:02:07,700
of boring at that point, but, um, speed running, you didn't miss much.

3626
03:02:07,700 --> 03:02:08,700
Let's put it that way.

3627
03:02:08,700 --> 03:02:09,700
You didn't miss much.

3628
03:02:09,700 --> 03:02:10,700
It's pretty grindy.

3629
03:02:10,700 --> 03:02:11,900
We get to wrap up and get out of here.

3630
03:02:11,900 --> 03:02:16,100
We will be back with dark soccer in seven days, a new month in seven days.

3631
03:02:16,100 --> 03:02:17,100
It'll be March.

3632
03:02:17,100 --> 03:02:18,100
I can't believe it.

3633
03:02:18,100 --> 03:02:19,100
This year's flying by.

3634
03:02:19,100 --> 03:02:20,580
We'll be back to do it all again in seven days.

3635
03:02:20,580 --> 03:02:24,400
Thank you again so much for watching, uh, orange on trading and listening to orange

3636
03:02:24,400 --> 03:02:25,400
on trail.

3637
03:02:25,400 --> 03:02:27,020
Have a great week, everybody.

3638
03:02:27,020 --> 03:02:28,020
Good night.
