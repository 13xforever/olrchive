00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:21.000
This week, alongside the surprise release of Apex Legends, the Nintendo Switch sees a surprise in Keen Dreams. Billy Blaze gets a second release on a system that can be played on the go.

00:21.000 --> 00:27.000
This is just one trip down memory lane, stay tuned for all the week's gaming news starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:44.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet, welcome back, it's another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio live tonight, episode number 763 for this February the 10th of 2019.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
I am Rob Roberts, he is Techmaster Loki joining me in studio.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
I am here, and I am the butt of the joke.

00:51.000 --> 00:59.000
Oh well yes, so it doesn't go on the podcast, but the little, when we go live on Twitch we do this little like inspired by you can't do that on television thing.

00:59.000 --> 01:06.000
So like we've had a couple, like so and so is not going to be seen tonight. If you ever watch you can't do that on television back in the day, they used to do that.

01:06.000 --> 01:16.000
So we've had all sorts of like little like tongue and cheek gaming inventory things, like what was Mavis Beacon Teaches Murder was one of them, Maria Kondo Organizes My Warcraft Inventory, that was another one we did.

01:16.000 --> 01:31.000
So tonight was Broccoli Farming Simulator 19. Also, I was kind of busy this weekend so I kind of had to pick something fast, so I was like alright I'm doing the obvious joke tonight, I'm going to burn my obvious one so I can think of a better one for next time.

01:31.000 --> 01:38.000
So I was trying to rack my brain thinking of a Valentine's one, but I was busy, I didn't have time. But I'm glad you enjoyed that Loki.

01:38.000 --> 01:49.000
It's just all the reason to be here live because of course if you are listening on the podcast feed we love you, we appreciate you being here because we've been an audio podcast for years and years and years, way too long, longer than I care to admit.

01:49.000 --> 02:03.000
But we love all the guys that listen to us on the podcast feed. But if you want to join us live you can over on our Twitch network, it's twitch.tv slash vog network, where we do tape live every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

02:03.000 --> 02:16.000
And yeah, here we are live again with another episode, Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers, sadly, again not with us tonight, she is still out on a work commitment, but we will hear from her later in the show during the classic game of the week segment.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
But for now, how are you Loki, everything going well with you?

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
I'm fine, I shoved a bunch of breadsticks in my mouth so you know.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
Yes, powered by carbs.

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
That was all of the food I've eaten today so, all at one go.

02:29.000 --> 02:42.000
Some people don't realize that we've definitely had to change some things with this whole move to Twitch, because one of them was that we would just kind of casually eat during the show, and now it's like, oh shoot, we're going to be live, we don't want to be sitting here eating on camel.

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
Oh, I wouldn't mind doing that, it's just the pizza box gets in the way of the screen, so you know.

02:46.000 --> 02:53.000
Sometimes during the Bobby call, you can still catch Loki finishing up something live, yeah, it just depends on what's going on.

02:53.000 --> 03:00.000
So, I saw you were streaming this week, I know you'll probably talk a little bit about it during your gaming week, but I saw you were finally doing some non-DDR stuff.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Yes.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Which I mean, DDR is cool and all, don't get me wrong.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
I also do DDR stuff too.

03:04.000 --> 03:09.000
Okay, but I caught you doing a Skyrim stream, so the thing, you were kind of teasing it on the last show.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
Yes.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Is that you were going to do like a...

03:11.000 --> 03:16.000
My wife was out of the house for a few days, and so I was able to actually sit down and do that.

03:16.000 --> 03:25.000
I didn't get to do it the first day, because I think I had to actually set up everything, and it wasn't ready yet, and also kids needed things, and it just wasn't working out, I was exhausted.

03:25.000 --> 03:30.000
So, I ended up, though, getting a good portion of time to do it.

03:30.000 --> 03:39.000
And of course, you know, in typical fashion, I didn't test anything going into it at all, and so it started off horribly, which is great.

03:39.000 --> 03:47.000
Testing is good, yeah. I was there at the very beginning, and I was like, he could have figured out that the intro wouldn't work with some of his mods.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
It should have.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
It's fine.

03:49.000 --> 04:00.000
There was no reason that the horses didn't know where to go, it's just, I think it was the weird horse mod thing that like, you'd see like the guard's horse just jet off into the mountains, and you know, it was downhill from there.

04:00.000 --> 04:08.000
But one of the mods I saw, and I know here we are talking about Skyrim mods, like hello, it's like 2012 all over again, but some things are forever funny.

04:08.000 --> 04:16.000
Like, you had that Thomas the Tank Engine that replaced the dragon at the very beginning, so it was really funny, instead of the big roar, you'd hear this doot doot.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
It just cracked me up, I loved it.

04:18.000 --> 04:26.000
Yeah, there was a lot of weird things. There ended up being two followers I had, so Gary the Goat and Dave the Dragon.

04:26.000 --> 04:37.000
And at one point somehow, because I kept playing with this one spell that was an orbital cannon, and so I aggroed Dave at one point.

04:37.000 --> 04:43.000
And so he tried to kill me, so I had to kill him in order for him to calm down.

04:43.000 --> 04:58.000
And then later in the stream, which not a lot of people got to see, but later in the stream there was a thing that had to do with falling barrels from the sky that all screamed that ended up going over well, because it was incredibly loud.

04:58.000 --> 05:03.000
And then My Little Pony stuff, because just for the hell of it.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.000
Now, you do archive all your video, right? So people could go back and watch it.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Yes.

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
Because for whatever reason, Twitch doesn't enable that by default. You have to tell it to save your videos so you can watch it.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
Well, I'm pretty sure I do, and if I don't, I archive my stuff on my local PC.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Good, that's smart, that's smart.

05:21.000 --> 05:31.000
Yeah, and I guess I should plug here, something extra we've been doing ever since we moved over to Twitch, is that we do broadcast the video live on Sunday nights, and you can be here and watch along with it.

05:31.000 --> 05:38.000
You can't be here on Sunday night, and you still really want video, the audio podcast that we've been doing for years and years for free, it's just not enough for you.

05:38.000 --> 05:48.000
You want to see the video on demand, all you have to do is subscribe to the VOG Network Twitch channel, which many of you with Amazon Prime, you get a free sub a month anyway, so you just use that to subscribe at the lowest level.

05:48.000 --> 05:53.000
You don't have to do anything but the lowest level, and you get access to the video archive.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
And not just us, but Bobby Black Wolf, and any special things we do.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.000
And SSJ100Matt says, the Macho Man Dragon mod is still the best.

05:59.000 --> 06:13.000
And that was the tough part, it's like you can only really choose one dragon mod, like if it were up to me, I would put the Macho Man dragon mod, and the Skyrim Thomas mod, and the My Little Pony mod, and whatever other stupid dragon mods they have.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
But you can only pick one.

06:15.000 --> 06:26.000
And so, instead for the Macho Man part, which unfortunately there's two chicken mods I had, so they kind of combine together.

06:26.000 --> 06:36.000
So I had one mod that made chickens look like tiny little strong men guys with chicken heads, and they would make Macho Man Randy Savage comments.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.000
And then I made one that apparently made chickens the size of like, they're just huge.

06:41.000 --> 06:49.000
So what we got instead now in there is giant chickens that occasionally when you walk up to them will make Macho Man Randy Savage comments.

06:49.000 --> 06:54.000
So it's something. Oh, and they explode, because of course they do.

06:54.000 --> 06:59.000
Alright, we're going to get into our kickoff topic for the night, which I'll have you do, Logie.

06:59.000 --> 07:05.000
But first off, I want to read this comment, because again, we're taping live on Twitch, and we read some comments from our chat.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
Big Red Pimp says, the video stream is not enough.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
I'm not sure what else we can give you, until they invent the holodeck.

07:11.000 --> 07:15.000
I'm not sure what else we can give you, short of you actually sitting here in the studio.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Virtual reality stream.

07:16.000 --> 07:20.000
To be fair, many of our listeners have come to the studio and sat in on the show.

07:20.000 --> 07:26.000
I feel like years ago you might have done that actually, Big Red Pimp. I know your wife did. Early, early on. Way back in the day.

07:26.000 --> 07:34.000
We should do, like, we should get the VR camera set up, like they use for those VR porn videos, and then that way we can get uncomfortably close to people and tell them the news.

07:35.000 --> 07:40.000
So we'll be like, hey, hey guess what? So like there's some Nintendo stuff going on.

07:41.000 --> 07:46.000
You guys, I played Apex Legends this week, and it's really rad.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
There you go. Yeah, see like that.

07:50.000 --> 07:53.000
Just get uncomfortably, like, practically sitting in there laughing.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.000
God, every imperfection I just put on full blast on Twitch anyway.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.000
It was perfect.

07:58.000 --> 07:59.000
Eh, whatever.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
Thank God for decent lighting.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
Alright, anyway, let's get into our kickoff topic tonight. Speaking of Nintendo and stuff that Nintendo's doing.

08:06.000 --> 08:13.000
So Nintendo, they've of course, you know, been very reluctant to sunset 3DS.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.000
But apparently that might be changing.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
The 3DS market has contracted faster than we anticipated.

08:21.000 --> 08:27.000
So apparently, you know, they had thought that this was going to go on for a lot longer, but they say that continuing.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.000
Right now they are still continuing to bring out new content for the 3DS.

08:33.000 --> 08:48.000
But during the recent financial briefing, basically saying the owners, that many of the 3DS owners are buying it as their first game systems and basically the nice price point.

08:49.000 --> 08:54.000
And then there's still room to improve with the Switch market as well.

08:54.000 --> 09:00.000
Also that they are still trying to push people to buy multiple Switch units per household.

09:01.000 --> 09:06.000
Although, honestly, I don't think that's really going to happen until you get the price of the system down.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
I don't know. The house I was visiting this weekend had at least two, I think maybe three.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.000
And then I brought mine.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
So, I don't know.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.000
One percent problems, I guess.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
Shut up. I was going to say, it probably just depends on the house.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
It depends on the house.

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
I mean, to be fair, this is a house full of gamers.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
So, I mean, it makes sense.

09:28.000 --> 09:34.000
Yeah, so basically they are saying that 2018 isn't the last year that we are going to see the 3DS.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.000
It's still going to be going strong this year.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
They are going to keep bringing out new content.

09:39.000 --> 09:46.000
Try to keep it, as they put it, vibrant and going well into next year.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
And, I don't know.

09:49.000 --> 09:54.000
So, we'll kind of see maybe, I think it's probably a couple of years away from being dead.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
But, you know, it's all about what they put out on the Switch.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
And getting people to buy stuff, because I think honestly with the 3DS,

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
because I just bought my kids a 2DS, which is basically a 3DS.

10:05.000 --> 10:10.000
And, I just can't imagine buying multiple copies of Switch games.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
Like, that's expensive as it is.

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
Like, on the 3DS, let alone, you know, $60 games.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.000
No, no thank you.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.000
Well, digital distribution, too.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.000
There's a lot of people that aren't just buying the $60 games.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Maybe buying, like, Overcooked for, like, $20.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
You know, and things like that.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
But, there's not a lot of games that we're having multiple Switch systems as really a benefit.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
I get it.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.000
Again, it depends on the household.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
If you have a lot of people that are more likely to be out and on the go separately,

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
and maybe they take transit a lot or something, so they want to have something to play.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
Like, it makes more sense in those situations.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
But, you're right. It's probably...

10:46.000 --> 10:50.000
I'm talking about a situation that probably applies to far less households than the other situation.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.000
But, what I think is going on...

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
And, you know, I'm not a 3DS hater by any means.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
I love the 3DS as a system. There's been so many great games on it.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
But, you know, at some point, a couple years ago,

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
Nintendo kind of already walked away from the 3D part of it.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
And, it was just, hey, here's our...

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
Here's another new DS.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
The Pokemon games barely support 3D.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
It's an afterthought in one mode.

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
And, they really started doing this 2DS and pushing that whole thing,

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
which is fine because Nintendo really had the portable market covered.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
I mean, they killed their only competition, the Vita.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
You know, congrats Nintendo.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
I mean, they had that market cornered.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
But, by the time they brought out the Switch, I was kind of like,

11:30.000 --> 11:34.000
okay, 3DS, you can go now, bye, because we have a portable system that is capable...

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
I mean, yes, you can put it on the dock and have it on TV too.

11:37.000 --> 11:40.000
But, as we all know, the whole thing is that you can pick it up and take it portable.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
And, it's a more powerful device.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
So, I'm kind of like, all right, you can stop putting games there.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Put it on the more powerful one on the Switch.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
And, I've been saying that on the show for a long time.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
But, you know, something that you guys have been saying,

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
and sometimes you guys here in studio is that,

11:57.000 --> 12:00.000
well, Nintendo probably had the 3DS around kind of for insurance purposes.

12:00.000 --> 12:05.000
Because, the Wii U didn't do so hot, right? All things considered.

12:06.000 --> 12:10.000
So, the Switch, they didn't know if it was going to be successful, right?

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
Because, you don't know until it's out there.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
You don't know how something's going to do.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
So, maybe Nintendo in some ways kind of under...

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
Well, but it's weird, I say they under predicted the success of the Switch.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
But, I swear, didn't we have a story just last week,

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
where Nintendo then had to like shift down their projections by like 1 million or something?

12:30.000 --> 12:33.000
I almost feel like they under predicted, then they over predicted,

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
now they got to go back to this, it's like this constant need to correct something.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
I don't know, they're not forecasting very well, but whatever.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
But, anyway, my point is...

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
Maybe that explains all the shortages because they can't forecast their numbers correctly.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
Maybe. But, anyway, my point is that, you know, the Switch has been successful,

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
whether it, you know, met the even more targets that Nintendo was setting, whatever.

12:56.000 --> 12:59.000
But, the Switch has been successful enough where I think it's kind of killing the 3DS,

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
and there's a lot of people that are probably approaching it the way I'm approaching it,

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
where it's like, my bag is not big enough to take the Switch and the 3DS,

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
and that's a lot to get stolen.

13:10.000 --> 13:13.000
So, I'm just going to take the Switch and, you know, there's nothing right now in the 3DS anyway

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
that I want to play that I didn't already play 3 or 4 years ago.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
There's a lot of games though too, even on like, aside from maybe like Pokémon and stuff,

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
but there's a lot of games that have come out on...

13:23.000 --> 13:28.000
Well, when that Pokémon game comes out on Switch, I mean, take the DS out back and shoot it, it's dead.

13:28.000 --> 13:35.000
Luigi's Mansion, whoopee-doo, I know there's fans of that series, but it's not enough to keep the DS alive.

13:36.000 --> 13:40.000
I would say the last real hurrah of that system, and I'm pointing this way for those on Twitch,

13:41.000 --> 13:46.000
because my DS is in the other room over here, it's just like forever alone on the living room table,

13:47.000 --> 13:51.000
but the Metroid game they did, the reinvention of Metroid 2 is probably the last great shout.

13:52.000 --> 13:55.000
Which really, they should just port that stuff over to, you know, the Switch.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
Agreed, I'm not gonna...

13:57.000 --> 14:03.000
And maybe that will happen once they finally sunset the 3DS, and then they'll bring over all that old stuff,

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
do like a 2D Metroid collection or something like that.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.000
Well, and I wonder, and you know, later in the show we're gonna get into some more Nintendo rumors and things,

14:11.000 --> 14:14.000
but there are rumors about potentially new 2D games and other franchises as well,

14:15.000 --> 14:20.000
and I wonder, actually Loki, I wonder if they are things that maybe were being planned for the 3DS,

14:20.000 --> 14:27.000
and now Nintendo is going, maybe, even though the 3DS has a larger install base overall,

14:28.000 --> 14:31.000
maybe the reality is the software is all moving on the Switch right now,

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
so we should probably aim this game over there instead.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
Maybe.

14:37.000 --> 14:42.000
And then of course they also talk a little bit about Nintendo online, so...

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Actually, real quick, I want to get some comments, because these are some good comments.

14:45.000 --> 14:51.000
Over at VOG Network, our... VOGnetwork.com is the website, and it'll take you right to twitch.tv slash vognetwork,

14:52.000 --> 14:58.000
where Bobby Blackwolf says, they even stopped making P-Cross games for the 3DS, and now they're on the Switch.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
I really preferred that game with the stylus.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.000
Well, you know, if they really wanted to, they could still make it work with touch controls,

15:06.000 --> 15:10.000
because the Switch is a touch screen, so that is... I mean, I realize not every Switch has a stylus,

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
so you'd have to use your finger, which isn't very accurate, and you know, make sure...

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
Well, you can still get a stylus. They could make a stylus that would work with it.

15:17.000 --> 15:22.000
You can, but they are making a choice that not enough people are going to do this to make it worth the development time,

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
because I think those P-Cross games are kind of meant to be...

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
To develop a stylus that's already out on the market?

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
No, no, no. I mean, develop the control scheme in the P-Cross game.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
Oh, fine.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.000
Because you have to kind of re-approach it for the stylus or whatever.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.000
Right, because they have to have it for the TV mode, too, and so that's the problem, is you have to support both modes.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
Right. Right. And I think those games are kind of meant to be.

15:43.000 --> 15:50.000
I doubt there's a very large team making those P-Cross games. They're probably meant to be low effort, low risk, medium reward.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.000
What was the P-Cross out on the Game Boy originally?

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
Oh, yeah. The series been around forever.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.000
Couldn't we just adapt those same controls?

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
Well, that's...

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
Are we too spoiled now with our touch screens and stuff that we can't pause?

16:02.000 --> 16:03.000
What directional pad?

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
That's what they did. He's saying it's a preference to use the touch thing on the 3DS, which I admit was kind of handy,

16:08.000 --> 16:13.000
because, Loki, they're all based off of, like, think like Sudoku, right?

16:14.000 --> 16:18.000
It really boils down to like a pen and paper game. You know those, like, books you used to be able to buy at the grocery store?

16:19.000 --> 16:20.000
You probably still can.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.000
That's where those P-Cross things come from, or like those types of books, but I think Japan.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.000
So it started as like a pen and pencil type thing.

16:30.000 --> 16:36.000
So that's why it's like, oh, a stylus feels natural for these games because originally that's really literally what it was.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
It was a pen to play these things. That's what it is.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
Right.

16:40.000 --> 16:46.000
Okay. Anyway, other comments in chat at twitch.tv slash vog network. Let's see.

16:47.000 --> 16:53.000
SG100Matt says, it's a hassle to take the switch on the train to work. I have, but I get unnecessary attention because of it.

16:54.000 --> 17:00.000
That's probably a good point, too, is that you don't always want to take a very expensive little device on these public transit things,

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
because you get a lot of people that are kind of looking over going, what's that?

17:04.000 --> 17:12.000
Maybe they haven't seen one before because they just don't follow tech as closely or they're not really gamers outside of, you know,

17:13.000 --> 17:18.000
possibly like, you know, earlier systems or touch phone games.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
So those things always kind of attract attention.

17:21.000 --> 17:27.000
So then also they made a comment as well about the Switch online service, which they said, of course,

17:27.000 --> 17:40.000
you know, they've had eight million accounts signed up, but they're finding that the trends right now is that it's actually that people are picking very short enrollment periods.

17:41.000 --> 17:46.000
So they're signing up for maybe like a month at a time and then not continuing to keep up with the service,

17:47.000 --> 17:53.000
which I guess that makes sense a little bit because let's be honest that, you know, the NES games that they offer there,

17:53.000 --> 17:59.000
that's not really all that great in the online portion of it is not all that great.

18:00.000 --> 18:11.000
I think honestly, like I've used the online for that last time we played Mario Kart 8 was probably the only time I've used Nintendo online for that.

18:11.000 --> 18:19.000
And then the NES games, I mean, I don't really play them.

18:20.000 --> 18:30.000
If I'm going to play NES games, I can just fire up my modded, you know, SNES classic or something like that and playing with a nice original controller.

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
I don't know. I've been playing the NES library a little bit here and there.

18:34.000 --> 18:41.000
I am more fascinated by the downloading the Japanese versions and looking at those because that's really the first time I've looked at many of those.

18:42.000 --> 18:50.000
Like I did a live stream about a month or so ago when Metroid first came out because, you know, playing Metroid on the Japanese Nintendo online,

18:51.000 --> 18:59.000
you get the Famicom Disk System version. So you see things you haven't seen before like the save screen because Metroid has, like in the original Legend of Zelda, a save screen.

18:59.000 --> 19:03.000
So Metroid has that in the FDS version. You've just never seen it really in America. So there's that.

19:04.000 --> 19:09.000
And then the sound chip differences, very subtle, but we kind of, you know, I did a little playthrough on stream and it's not like going to change your life,

19:10.000 --> 19:14.000
but it's kind of neat to go back and play it and go, huh, that's interesting. Like these very subtle differences.

19:15.000 --> 19:20.000
And I think Zelda and Zelda 2 might have some very minor differences as well because they were originally Disk System games as well.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.000
And I'm waiting for Kid Icarus because I think that's another one that was originally a Disk System game.

19:24.000 --> 19:31.000
So yeah, there's a lot of those early NES games because they hadn't quite developed the battery thing yet.

19:32.000 --> 19:36.000
They used those password things instead to get them to work. But anyway, I'm deviating a little bit.

19:37.000 --> 19:43.000
The online system, I just watched somebody play Splatoon 2 over the weekend, so I know that's still going.

19:44.000 --> 19:50.000
And of course along with that, since they do recognize that, you know, they said a growing percentage of subscribers are going for shorter one month memberships,

19:50.000 --> 19:58.000
that they're going to, you know, try to make it more worthwhile, basically.

19:59.000 --> 20:07.000
Currently we're planning on ways to boost the appeal of the service on a yearly basis and we'll announce more details as soon as they are ready.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.000
So, yeah.

20:12.000 --> 20:16.000
Maybe the Super Nintendo always rumored Datamined in the...

20:17.000 --> 20:25.000
Is that really going to be enough? I mean, like, how... I don't know. It's just, it seems like we need more.

20:26.000 --> 20:31.000
I think they need to, like, either ditch that app or make it a lot better.

20:32.000 --> 20:36.000
They need to, like, just ditch that app because the voice chat thing is ridiculous. I don't know anybody that's using it.

20:37.000 --> 20:42.000
Or they just need to try to, like, make it better, like, maybe where you can, like, and I thought this was supposed to be a thing of it.

20:42.000 --> 20:46.000
Maybe it's even there and I just don't even realize it. But, like, schedule gaming sessions with friends.

20:47.000 --> 20:53.000
Or interact more with Facebook and Twitter to see, like, what friends are playing and instantly be able to join their games and things of that sort.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
I don't know. I feel like there's just other things they could do with that app.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
I don't know.

20:59.000 --> 21:05.000
Achievements and leaderboards. But, you know, last week we talked a little bit about Xbox Live is now kind of creeping in there a little bit.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
So it'll be interesting to see if Microsoft maybe pushes something.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
I think patching the achievements would be pretty cool.

21:12.000 --> 21:22.000
Yeah, but again, and I've said this last week, I think it's important to say, before you get carried away with this whole Xbox Live on Nintendo thing, don't expect that Nintendo to implement it in their own games.

21:23.000 --> 21:32.000
That's not what Xbox Live on Switch is going to do. It's not going to work with Mario and Zelda. I mean, that would be a monumental deal if that happens. I really don't think it's going to.

21:32.000 --> 21:41.000
It's more for the indie things. The Minecrafts of the world, obviously, and then other indie developers that want to enable that sort of thing on their indie games.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
But you're not going to see it in Mario, Zelda, Metroid. Ain't happening.

21:46.000 --> 21:51.000
Nintendo is going to try to convince you, whether it's true or not, that their system is better.

21:51.000 --> 22:02.000
And that's what they're tasked with and facing their investors with is even the investors are kind of calling them out that your online system isn't what the others are offering.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.000
Step it up. Basically what I'm hearing in this question.

22:06.000 --> 22:20.000
Yeah. All right. Going to our Twitch chat. Bobby says, well, I mean, what more do you want? Like, define more. Playing games online isn't enough and Netflix with online play isn't enough.

22:21.000 --> 22:33.000
Fair question. I think you'd have to look at what some of the competition is doing. Where has the bar been set with things like PlayStation Plus and Xbox Live Gold?

22:33.000 --> 22:40.000
Where has the bar been set that Nintendo, even though they're coming into this game later, where are they not meeting the bar?

22:41.000 --> 22:50.000
Not really doing it with discounts. I know they have their whole coins thing, but that's, is that really a part of the online? I don't think you have to pay to be in the coins.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
So that's not really a part of it. So they're not really doing discounts in that regard.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
That is nice.

22:56.000 --> 23:05.000
It's nice. Yeah, sure. The coins thing is nice. I don't know. I kind of think it's an after. It doesn't really save you that much money. I mean, it's like...

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
It's like 10% or...

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
You have to get a lot of coins for that. You don't get that much. It depends if you buy it digitally.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
No, it's 10%. Whatever you buy, you get 10% back in coins.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.000
If you buy it digitally. I don't think you get as much if you buy it.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
Oh, I don't know. I buy most things digitally.

23:19.000 --> 23:26.000
But anyway, whatever. But anyway, so, but I would say it's, it's the, it's a lot of the voice chat is what it's really coming down to.

23:27.000 --> 23:32.000
And the fact that, you know, in the PlayStation environment, you can hop on there with, you know, party and join friends.

23:33.000 --> 23:40.000
And now look at some of the other stuff that PlayStation has been offering. SharePlay, the ability to stream now streaming isn't really a plus feature, right?

23:41.000 --> 23:47.000
Streaming is inherently a thing, but the SharePlay or private streaming, that's a huge deal, I think. And that's something that you get with the plus.

23:48.000 --> 23:53.000
Being able to form the parties kind of natively in the system and have that party chat no matter what game you're in.

23:54.000 --> 23:59.000
Like having to use a secondary app for that, that's very hit and miss. I think it's, I don't think it's connecting with people.

24:00.000 --> 24:04.000
And that's one big problem I think Nintendo's having and where it's feeling like they're really playing catch up.

24:05.000 --> 24:08.000
I think that app is holding them back because the app just doesn't do enough.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
It was a dumb idea. I don't even know what the thought process.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000
Everybody's doing an app.

24:15.000 --> 24:21.000
But no, not everybody's doing an app. Sony doesn't have an app that I need to use for voice chat.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
Microsoft doesn't have an app that I need to use for voice chat.

24:25.000 --> 24:30.000
Now, ActDeft takes a little deeper dive in our chat about what's wrong with Nintendo's online saying,

24:31.000 --> 24:37.000
What I want for Nintendo online is better servers, not a peer-to-peer service. I shouldn't be paying for peer-to-peer.

24:37.000 --> 24:44.000
Now, there's a more direct shot on what Nintendo is, you know, not giving that the other ones are giving us.

24:45.000 --> 24:49.000
I know ActDeft's been having a lot of problems with Nintendo online.

24:50.000 --> 24:54.000
So, not too surprised to see him very vocal about that in our chat room.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.000
Let's see, Tiberius suggests, how about extended demos?

24:58.000 --> 25:04.000
Miltonious Games, or excuse me, Miltonious Games, I can't see if that's two eyes or not,

25:05.000 --> 25:08.000
says maybe like an EA Access-style trial for games.

25:09.000 --> 25:14.000
More types of streaming things, but I don't know what is the Switch necessarily capable of.

25:15.000 --> 25:20.000
These may be things that Nintendo is challenged to think about with Switch Plus or whatever they're going to do.

25:20.000 --> 25:30.000
Like, new Switch, Switch 2, whatever inevitable, like, not successor, but upgrade they end up selling to the Switch happens to be.

25:31.000 --> 25:35.000
I think these are things they might have to think about, is this console beefy enough to do more of this competitive online stuff?

25:36.000 --> 25:41.000
And I think that's where you're going to start to see Nintendo online kind of start to have to develop an offer more. We'll see.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
Yeah, I don't know.

25:44.000 --> 25:50.000
Anyway, alright, I think that's enough on Nintendo for now. We have some other stories later on in the show that deal with Nintendo things,

25:51.000 --> 25:55.000
so let's get into our gaming weeks and talk about the video games that we have been playing this week, Nintendo or not.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.000
Loki, how was your gaming week?

25:58.000 --> 26:06.000
Well, I didn't play a whole ton of things. I played Skyrim a little bit on stream and I played Dance Dance Revolution a little bit on stream,

26:06.000 --> 26:14.000
so I did some more of the edit doubles stuff there. I switched down to one camera because my other camera is for my Skyrim setup,

26:15.000 --> 26:22.000
so I had to move it, and I didn't feel like moving it back and forth, and we really don't need two cameras, so whatevs.

26:23.000 --> 26:33.000
And then what else? So, I did a little bit of Pokemon Go. I still haven't played any Kingdom Hearts yet because I just didn't bother to do it.

26:33.000 --> 26:38.000
I don't know, I could have played it when my wife was gone, but meh. I don't know.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
I'm looking forward to this week's Crackdown 3 finally coming out.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
Oh yeah, that's a sweet feeling.

26:44.000 --> 26:49.000
So I'll have to pick that up once I get paid, but yeah, that'll play on PC. That's going to be awesome.

26:50.000 --> 26:57.000
I watched some video of the online mode, and I could do without that. That's fine.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
Are you at least going to try it?

26:59.000 --> 27:06.000
Eh, I don't know. Maybe. It doesn't really matter to me, but the destruction part of it, like,

27:07.000 --> 27:11.000
it's fully destructive and stuff like that, and we need the cloud to drive this stuff.

27:12.000 --> 27:17.000
Dude, I gotta be honest. You see more destruction in the Battlefield games than you do in this thing.

27:18.000 --> 27:24.000
It's kind of a waste of the tech if you ask me, but we'll give it a try.

27:25.000 --> 27:30.000
I'll wait and see what it looks like, but at the very least the end of the single player game is going to be awesome, so I'm done with that.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.000
And then, yeah, I think that was it.

27:34.000 --> 27:37.000
Alright, well I played a few games this week. I had to make some notes. That's why I'm playing with my phone over here,

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
because I actually made some notes about things I played this week.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
So I played a little more Kingdom Hearts 3. I don't have a lot more to say that I didn't say last week,

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
but I'm enjoying my time with the game. I'm taking it nice and slow.

27:47.000 --> 27:52.000
I know this is the point now where a lot of the more fans and people that were really anxiously awaiting Kingdom Hearts 3,

27:52.000 --> 27:56.000
more and more people are beating it, so I'm just trying to take it at my own pace,

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
because it's going to be 13 years before there's another one.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
So, you know what, I'm going to take it at my speed.

28:03.000 --> 28:07.000
And that's because I also tend to play things like World of Warcraft quite a bit and in between.

28:08.000 --> 28:12.000
I've just been playing more WoW lately. It's kind of been my MMO. Final Fantasy XIV has been kind of on the back burner a little bit,

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
just because you're kind of getting towards the end of expansion right now in XIV,

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
and so I feel like there's not as much to do.

28:18.000 --> 28:24.000
I mean, there will be a new story patch before the next expansion officially, so I'll get excited about it again then,

28:25.000 --> 28:29.000
but for right now, I've just been kind of filling the void, because I haven't been playing World of Warcraft for years, regularly, really.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
So I got another character up to 120. I hit max level on my Shaman.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
Resto is mostly what I'm playing there, so I have a healer now.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
So that's three, that's actually three characters I have at 120.

28:40.000 --> 28:45.000
I have a Horde, Resto Druid, and an Alliance, Resto Shaman, and Alliance Goblin Warlock.

28:45.000 --> 28:48.000
So I've been playing a lot of WoW, but it's fun.

28:49.000 --> 28:53.000
I don't even really do the raiding or anything like that. I do the world quests.

28:54.000 --> 28:58.000
You can do a lot of upgrading through world quests and doing those events, and it's nice. I just take things at my own pace.

28:59.000 --> 29:05.000
Okay, I also played some more Pokemon Let's Go this week. I know that game came out a while ago,

29:06.000 --> 29:13.000
but because of the Pokemon Go event, where they're like, hey, don't you want to get Meltan more frequently out of boxes?

29:13.000 --> 29:19.000
And I'm like, I still have not gotten to the point in Pokemon Let's Go where you can start, because it's a ways into the game.

29:20.000 --> 29:26.000
You have to get past at least four gym leaders, which that's over half the gym leaders, in the game before you can do that.

29:27.000 --> 29:33.000
So finally, I had some time on Friday while I was at a friend's, and they were doing a board game thing that I wasn't in.

29:34.000 --> 29:39.000
So I had some time to play Switch, and I got caught up to that point in the game in Let's Go.

29:39.000 --> 29:46.000
So I finally gave myself a freaking Meltan box in Pokemon Go, and I got a shiny Meltan.

29:47.000 --> 29:51.000
My very last Pokemon in my first box was shiny, so I was happy about that.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
Yeah, I'll have to try that. I haven't gotten a shiny one yet.

29:55.000 --> 29:58.000
Well, Go's doing a special event just for a couple weeks, I think, where you have a chance at a shiny one.

29:58.000 --> 30:08.000
I've got the big evolved one, though, but I need one also that's for Pokemon Let's Go as well.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
I don't know.

30:11.000 --> 30:15.000
Interesting take from DJ Rama S in our chat on why people are moving fast through Kingdom Hearts.

30:16.000 --> 30:24.000
The only reason why I've seen so many people power through Kingdom Hearts 3 is because most of those people are cosplayers, and they're trying to get their cosplays done for Katsucon this weekend.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
That's a good point. Thank you, DJ Rama S. I didn't think about that.

30:29.000 --> 30:35.000
ActDeaf reminded me I need to get a couple more shinies if I want a shiny Meltan and Melmetal in Let's Go.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.000
There's a shiny Dratini on your house.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.000
You just got a shiny Dratini? No, the shinies are per person.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
If I tap it always. So you just got a shiny just now?

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
Yeah. Good for you. Look at that. Show them on the Twitch feed.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
I already have one of these, though.

30:49.000 --> 30:52.000
I know Dratini's not as exciting because they already had a community day.

30:53.000 --> 30:57.000
Well, lucky you. Get one of those little piggies. Shiny. That's supposed to be the thing going on.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
That might finally be over.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
I've gotten so many of those.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
That's still going. The Chinese New Year thing.

31:05.000 --> 31:09.000
Our chat is lighting up. ActDeaf is like, Damn, Loki. That's lucky.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
And Bobby's like, It's just a shiny. LOL.

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
I don't know. I don't really care about the shinies.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.000
Suddenly a wild Shane approaches and is like, I'll take that shiny from you.

31:20.000 --> 31:24.000
Alright. Quest buster. Loki gets a shiny. Oh, okay.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Alright. Other things I played this week.

31:29.000 --> 31:32.000
I played Overcooked 2. Have you played those games? The Overcooked games? No.

31:33.000 --> 31:38.000
So I was at a buddy's house and they have it and so we were playing like four player Overcooked.

31:39.000 --> 31:42.000
And it was a little harder for me because they all kind of knew the game and I didn't know it so well.

31:42.000 --> 31:45.000
So, I mean, the game definitely has a learning curve.

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
And we were trying to do some of the like, I guess they have like special event levels.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
So they had like Lunar New Year levels and I felt like I was getting in the way.

31:53.000 --> 31:58.000
So if you haven't played Overcooked, it's like you have to go get the ingredient to make the dish.

31:59.000 --> 32:04.000
Like somebody might order a hamburger, but they want their, or somebody wants a chicken sandwich and this person wants a hamburger.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
So you might have to do like bun, tomato, burger.

32:08.000 --> 32:11.000
And then for another you have to do bun, tomato, chicken or something like that.

32:12.000 --> 32:18.000
So you have to go like get the ingredient and sometimes you have to fry it in a pan or you have to boil rice or whatever the ingredient is.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
And then you have to put them on a plate in a certain order and then serve it.

32:22.000 --> 32:31.000
Well it gets really hysterical when there's like four people all running over each other because you can't walk on top of each other so you're all getting each other's way.

32:32.000 --> 32:39.000
And then you have certain stages where like the conveyor belts start moving or you're in a hot air balloon where you just get blown out of the balloon and stuff like that.

32:39.000 --> 32:44.000
I've seen the one with trains or whatever, like it's two moving trains or something.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
Okay, so you've seen some footage in the game.

32:48.000 --> 32:54.000
So that was a little bit that I played, but I was like, I am just getting in the way because they're very fast at it.

32:55.000 --> 32:58.000
They're just able to pick up the fish, chop the fish, boil the fish, whatever they do. They were doing it all fast.

32:59.000 --> 33:02.000
So I ended up just, I had to go to the corner and wash dishes.

33:03.000 --> 33:06.000
So when the dishes came back I'd wash it and then put it in another stack.

33:06.000 --> 33:09.000
So that was one less thing everybody else had to worry about. I was like, I found my little roll.

33:10.000 --> 33:17.000
And I guess Overcooked kind of works that way. Everybody kind of finds their different ways in the assembly line, but it always gets screwed up somehow.

33:18.000 --> 33:25.000
Because there'll be an order that you didn't account for in your assembly line or something gets screwed up or there's a fire and so it all gets screwed up.

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
Anyway, that was a little Overcooked that I played this week.

33:29.000 --> 33:34.000
And I also played some board games. I should give a shout out to board games here on the show because I don't talk enough about them.

33:34.000 --> 33:40.000
But of course I like board games. I mean, I talk a lot about video games. I don't get to play board games a lot.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
Alan and I have a few, but we don't really just play the two of us board games.

33:44.000 --> 33:54.000
And it's very rare that I get invited to board game stuff, but I went to this LGBTQ plus board game day in San Francisco and I had a good time.

33:55.000 --> 34:01.000
We played Codenames, I think was the name of the game. It was a word guessing game and I liked that a lot.

34:01.000 --> 34:06.000
And then we played one called Pandemic that I think is pretty popular. A lot of board gamers probably know that game.

34:07.000 --> 34:15.000
I never played it before, but that was a lot of fun because in, you know, there's more and more board games where like, I remember board games as I always kind of knew them were always like one person wins.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
It's like, you know, monopoly, one winner, clue, one winner, right?

34:19.000 --> 34:26.000
But now there's more and more games where it's like, it's you against the game. And that's something like Pandemic. It's all the players against the game.

34:26.000 --> 34:30.000
So it's kind of neat and the different ways you draw cards will affect what happens in the game.

34:31.000 --> 34:36.000
And I've played other like deck building games like that. It's like, there was like a DC heroes game and Sentinels, the multiverse was that.

34:37.000 --> 34:43.000
I've played one that was as on the board game thing with Cthulhu. I don't remember what it was, but there was one where it's everybody against Cthulhu.

34:44.000 --> 34:50.000
So, and Cthulhu won, you know, as, as he normally does. Yeah. So I had a board game day, so that was fun.

34:50.000 --> 34:56.000
Uh, and then the other video game I played this week was Apex Legends, because there's a lot of people going crazy about this game also.

34:57.000 --> 35:01.000
We'll get into it a little later in the show, but I mean, we talked about it last week and we're kind of like, eh, we'll see what happens.

35:02.000 --> 35:06.000
And all of a sudden, like it blows up. Right. Yeah. So I was like, all right, I got to see what all this fuss is about. Right.

35:07.000 --> 35:15.000
I tried four nights. I got to try Apex Legends. Sadly, I did not like, there is a tutorial, but that's like, it's very short and there's not a lot to it.

35:16.000 --> 35:24.000
And there's no like PvE or there's no practice or there's no, you have to jump in there and do a squad of three people and do it.

35:25.000 --> 35:34.000
So I've been a little scared to go past the tutorial. I will get past the tutorial later, but that's really all I've done is beat the tutorial way, which is more than some people playing Cuphead.

35:35.000 --> 35:40.000
All right. But obviously I didn't have a lot of tutorial in Cuphead. There is, remember there's like an infamous.

35:41.000 --> 35:50.000
So yeah, that's such a brief part of the game. Yeah. So anyway, I've, I've played that, but that's sadly about as far as I've gotten, but I do, I just had a busy weekend.

35:51.000 --> 35:59.000
I didn't get to play more and that game just came out on like what Monday or Tuesday. So Monday really taken off since then, but we'll get into that a little later in the show, but I did at least download it and check it out.

36:00.000 --> 36:05.000
It's a nice looking game. I'll give it that, but I'll expand on my thoughts, I guess a little bit later when we get into more on Apex Legends.

36:05.000 --> 36:12.000
So, all right. I guess we will get into some gaming news. I don't have a lot of housekeeping, but I will say as always, you can follow us on Twitter at twitter.com slash O L R.

36:13.000 --> 36:18.000
Uh, and of course we're also on Facebook at orange lounge radio. Uh, but the best place to follow us is right here on Twitch at VOG network.

36:19.000 --> 36:25.000
And we appreciate all the follows and appreciate the subscriptions and the biddies, uh, that people have been showing us. Well, we really appreciate all that.

36:26.000 --> 36:34.000
Thank you so much for helping this, uh, move to Twitch, uh, for VOG network be really successful so far, but we've been having a good time on Twitch and hopefully getting our show out to more people.

36:35.000 --> 36:38.000
Uh, a lot of fun. So, all right, let's get into some other gaming news. Loki.

36:39.000 --> 36:50.000
All right. So unfortunately there are rumors that there's going to be a massive layoffs at Activision Blizzard, uh, according to some rumblings from the employees of the publisher.

36:51.000 --> 37:02.000
Um, this is supposedly going to go down on Tuesday and it's supposed to take place right before the, um, quarterly earnings call that they're going to have.

37:02.000 --> 37:11.000
Um, it's expected according to reports from Bloomberg that the layoffs are going to be in numbering in the hundreds.

37:12.000 --> 37:22.000
And of course, um, they didn't, Activision hasn't really confirmed that this is going to happen or not, but I guess we'll have to wait and see.

37:22.000 --> 37:38.000
Um, the thought is that it's supposed to be for like cost cutting. Um, cause now I don't know with like some of these games like hall of duty and stuff, even though black ops four was like one of the more successful games of 2018.

37:39.000 --> 37:51.000
Um, it didn't meet, it failed to meet expectations. This is what they do all the time. So you have a game that comes out, they set the expectations way too high because you know, they're trying to beat the numbers for the previous year.

37:52.000 --> 37:55.000
So a big studio probably spent a lot of money developing it to be fair.

37:56.000 --> 38:05.000
Well, it's, they have like four or five studios developing call of duty games. So whatever paying all that overtime pay for crunch time because they didn't plan appropriately.

38:06.000 --> 38:19.000
Um, but still, so you're going to have this game come out, it's going to not meet expectations ever. And then they're going to cut, um, employees to bring down the cost of the studio.

38:19.000 --> 38:29.000
So that, you know, shareholders will be happy. And so Bobby coca tick can make his millions of dollars. Um, so yeah, so we'll have to see what happens.

38:30.000 --> 38:37.000
But unfortunately, um, you know, now also being that destiny is going to part, you know, bungees kind of parting ways with destiny.

38:37.000 --> 38:49.000
Um, I don't know. It's not, not a great sign. So, um, we may hear of, uh, quite a few layoffs in the next day or so.

38:50.000 --> 39:04.000
Well, I mean, I hope it's not true, but, um, I think unfortunately this type of news is inevitable in the industry. I think a lot of people, you know, I follow a lot of people on Twitter that are very loyal for Blizzard products because, you know, I had the Warcraft podcast a long time ago.

39:04.000 --> 39:14.000
Rest in peace, courthouse. Um, but, uh, you know, I followed a lot of people in the Blizzard community back in that state. So a lot of people were very curious how this may affect Blizzard. You know, Blizzard's had a lot of changes.

39:15.000 --> 39:27.000
Um, they, uh, scaled back on heroes, the storm, which is very controversial. We all know what happened with Diablo. We don't need to retread that ground. Um, but obviously it did not go the, the reveal and the hype did not go the way that was anticipated.

39:27.000 --> 39:42.000
Um, whether they anticipated correctly or not is not the point. It just was not what is anticipated. Um, and, um, and so on. So some people, and then, um, you know, this is Overwatch League. Somebody in chat just mentioned Overwatch League is about to start, you know, in a matter of days.

39:42.000 --> 39:57.000
So it's like, what, what might happen at Blizzard? And that's, that's kind of scary. And obviously, you know, it's a company that a lot of people love and adore because of their games, but Blizzard also makes games in a certain way that doesn't mesh well with the big culture.

39:58.000 --> 40:07.000
If you think about it, when was the last time Blizzard put out a game that was not an expansion or an update patch? When was the last time Blizzard put out a new game?

40:08.000 --> 40:25.000
Overwatch. Yeah. And when was Overwatch? A little bit ago. It was a little, a little while ago at this point. It was two years ago at this point. So I think their style of development, while it's worked for them in the past, it's not working for a company that's needing to deliver the hits a little faster.

40:25.000 --> 40:33.000
And this is where I think some of the Blizzard fans get really agitated with the Activision ownership because they miss the Blizzard from before.

40:33.000 --> 40:46.000
Well, Activision though, too, like I just think with these games, I mean, what more can you possibly do to them that this is the problem we have? Like you have Call of Duty, which is like one of the best selling games each year.

40:47.000 --> 40:55.000
You're selling that. You're selling the season pass that go along with that. You're selling all of the loot boxes and stuff that go along with that.

40:56.000 --> 41:09.000
It's just like if all of that combined is not enough to make the amount of money that you want to make, where's it going to come from? Because you only have a finite amount of people that are going to buy the game.

41:09.000 --> 41:16.000
And I can tell you this much, cutting out the single player campaign, that made at least one less person that bought that game because that was something I was looking forward to.

41:16.000 --> 41:25.000
Instead, you're jumping on a bandwagon with the battle royale stuff, which on top of that, you're even selling more loot boxes for more like cosmetics or whatever.

41:26.000 --> 41:38.000
It's just it's all a money grab. And this is the problem is it's it's less now. It seems like about making a good game. It's more of like how can we engineer this to make us the most money?

41:38.000 --> 41:48.000
And it's becoming so transparent that that's what it is, that people are kind of turned off by it. And I just think that they kind of have to step back and actually make some good games.

41:48.000 --> 42:00.000
And I'm not saying on the Blizzard side of the house, I'm talking more of the Activision side of the house where it's just like, let's just take any of these franchises and just stamp them into the ground until we can get all the money out of it.

42:00.000 --> 42:04.000
You know, Tar Hero. Hello. You know, they destroyed.

42:04.000 --> 42:13.000
Yes, but but I just just the Guitar Hero revival was probably better than the consumers gave it credit for. You know what I mean?

42:13.000 --> 42:23.000
Like it's just one of those things was like, yes, I told when they had the Guitar Hero like tour edition and all this stuff that came out like all at once in one year, it was just too much.

42:24.000 --> 42:32.000
They were milk and a cow that was already on its way out the door. But when they did that revival, it's it's unfortunate in my opinion, because it was better than it was worth.

42:32.000 --> 42:43.000
And DJ Hero, which came out in that same era where too much hero was happening at once. Also, I think an unfortunate victim of too much because that game was better than y'all gave it credit for.

42:43.000 --> 42:48.000
So many people slept on that game, in my opinion. But maybe not everybody's into the music games like we were.

42:48.000 --> 42:54.000
I hope you still want to get in on that. I can tell you right now, Goodwill has a ton of those turntables like dirt.

42:54.000 --> 43:01.000
And it's unfortunate you can't like but it's like my PlayStation three is long since like not really utilized.

43:01.000 --> 43:09.000
I think you can get all your guitar controllers or hey, you're in the market for a Wii Fit balance board because they've got stacks of those.

43:09.000 --> 43:17.000
You get that stuff so dirt cheap. It's funny trying to like see what they think that they're supposed to because, of course, the people that work there, they don't know what half that shit coming in is.

43:17.000 --> 43:22.000
And so they're like, OK, I'm going to take the turntable. I'm going to put two turntables in the crossfader in the middle.

43:22.000 --> 43:25.000
Yeah, that looks about right. We'll sell that for five dollars.

43:25.000 --> 43:31.000
All right. Well, going out to the chat, because you guys have a lot to say in our chat, lots of talk on Hearthstone actually in chat.

43:31.000 --> 43:38.000
Questbuster says Hearthstone saw player declines and killed the tournament scene and Overwatch growth was flat from their last quarterly report.

43:38.000 --> 43:43.000
Well, I mean, what what Overwatch is it?

43:43.000 --> 43:48.000
I mean, sure, they had a new character once in a while and a new map, but it's not enough to like grow the player base.

43:48.000 --> 43:55.000
What is going to make more people what is going to make new people want to check out Overwatch playing game?

43:55.000 --> 44:03.000
I don't know. I my opinion, single player mode, even though I completely understand that is completely against what Overwatch is about.

44:03.000 --> 44:11.000
And if you want to bring in new people, what that aren't already playing it, you want to bring in new people to experience it.

44:11.000 --> 44:16.000
I think that the key is to do a single player mode, because then the people they're always like, I don't want to play a team based game.

44:16.000 --> 44:22.000
I want to do this. Then they'll be, oh, well, now I'll check it out because that's a single player story, something I can check out.

44:22.000 --> 44:31.000
That's my opinion on how you get Overwatch to game, because it's I mean, I would who out there in gamer world that is interested in a team based shooter

44:31.000 --> 44:35.000
has not at least like tried Overwatch on one of those free weekends or something at this point.

44:35.000 --> 44:42.000
You know, if you haven't bought the game now that it's down to like 20 bucks, then it's very much a financial slash hardware type of decision.

44:42.000 --> 44:46.000
You know, I just I just who's left to buy Overwatch. I mean, that's just my opinion.

44:46.000 --> 44:51.000
Let's see. And there was another comment here I want to read in our chat at Twitch TV slash VOG Network.

44:51.000 --> 44:59.000
Miltonius game says my friend is a hardcore follower of Hearthstone, and even he stopped playing after they nerfed some classic cards.

44:59.000 --> 45:09.000
You know, Blizzard has been trying to milk games a long time after they're out, and not so many games get to do that nowadays.

45:09.000 --> 45:20.000
You know, Blizzard was maybe a precedent got set with World of Warcraft, where for years and years and years, they were the dominant MMO and went unchallenged.

45:20.000 --> 45:28.000
And in many ways, they still are. I think really WoW is just another one of those things where it's like it's just I think a victim of its own age.

45:28.000 --> 45:36.000
People just let it go because they move on to doing other stuff. They don't like a change or they don't like where the expansion went or something.

45:36.000 --> 45:42.000
Or you know what, the group the group that they were rating with just fell apart because sometimes people grow apart.

45:42.000 --> 45:47.000
One person got a new job that and then the whole thing fell apart. So they all canceled their WoW accounts.

45:48.000 --> 45:55.000
I wonder how far away we are from like some of these games because they're trying to find ways to get more money out of them.

45:55.000 --> 46:04.000
Where maybe not so much now with the loot boxes or they can still do loot boxes, I guess, but adding a subscription service to it instead.

46:04.000 --> 46:11.000
Like kind of go in the World of Warcraft model where like, hey, we're in charge, you know, $12 a month for Overwatch.

46:11.000 --> 46:17.000
You know what WoW needs to do, in my opinion, if Warcraft wants to, again, grow beyond what you already have.

46:17.000 --> 46:25.000
Grow beyond the people that have played. The trying to catch up in WoW can feel very overwhelming at this point because there's so much and so many expansion things.

46:25.000 --> 46:33.000
I think for one, they need to sell World of Warcraft for 20 bucks. That's just everything.

46:33.000 --> 46:38.000
Stop trying to piecemeal original game. I know they grouped some expansions together, but you know what?

46:38.000 --> 46:44.000
They need to just do the whole kit and caboodle for 20 bucks and then make their money off the monthly fees or whatever.

46:44.000 --> 46:52.000
That's what they need to do at World of Warcraft. And honestly, I think it should be free to play up far past where it is now.

46:52.000 --> 46:58.000
I think the entirety of at least vanilla WoW ought to be free to play. At least, if not Burning Crusade and Lich King.

46:58.000 --> 47:04.000
Why not top it out when Warcraft was at its peak? Let people go to Lich King for free. You know what I mean? I don't know. That's thought.

47:04.000 --> 47:13.000
Or when it comes to something like World of Warcraft, or I was going to say Final Fantasy XIV, something interesting they're doing.

47:13.000 --> 47:17.000
And this came out of their Paris Fan Fest, which we'll talk about in more detail later on in the show.

47:17.000 --> 47:25.000
But they, and you may have noticed this on Twitch, if you're a Twitch Prime person, you can get Final Fantasy XIV for free up to level 15.

47:25.000 --> 47:32.000
You get the base basically Realm Reborn for free right now. And I think it might be a free month. Correct me if I'm wrong, chatters?

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
It's 30 days.

47:33.000 --> 47:41.000
Is it 30 days for free for Twitch Prime? So that is a very smart thing for Square to do with an expansion that they're pushing in June.

47:41.000 --> 47:49.000
Let people get to that point now in the game and really get to winning that expansion and then sell them the expansion. You know what I mean?

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
I thought about it, Buzzing.

47:52.000 --> 47:57.000
It's like 30 days for free. Get them hooked, right? So I think Square is doing the type of thing right now.

47:57.000 --> 48:04.000
And I realize, you know, I know I've personally talked about that I enjoy Final Fantasy XIV a lot. It does not compete with numbers wise with WoW.

48:04.000 --> 48:07.000
I mean it does very well, but it doesn't do as good as WoW.

48:07.000 --> 48:16.000
Who knows though? Activision Blizzard hasn't released WoW numbers for a while, but I assume just based on people streaming it on Twitch, people talking about it on Twitter.

48:16.000 --> 48:23.000
There's probably just more people on WoW still than there is Final Fantasy. WoW is still going to take a long time to topple, but it's not the 10 million it once was.

48:23.000 --> 48:29.000
So, anyway. Some folks in chat, interesting. Bobby Blackwell saying,

48:29.000 --> 48:34.000
I remember back when everyone thought EverQuest was the 800 pound gorilla and would never be dethroned.

48:34.000 --> 48:36.000
I'm going to come back to that thought in a minute actually.

48:36.000 --> 48:39.000
Miltonius Games says, Battle Pass is the new kind of subscription model.

48:39.000 --> 48:44.000
S2100Matt says, sports games are going to have to go that subscription route. It kind of already is leaning towards that.

48:44.000 --> 48:53.000
You know, you're kind of paying for the yearly updates to the rosters and some new, you know, that's why everybody makes those jokes about roster update 2019 or whatever. Anyway.

48:53.000 --> 49:02.000
Miltonius just pointed out, ESO has my favorite MMO model. A lot of people like that. Buy the game once, you don't have to pay a monthly fee anymore.

49:02.000 --> 49:08.000
I know that monthly fee turns a lot of people away, but that's how Blizzard made its money for years and years and years.

49:08.000 --> 49:16.000
So it's going to be interesting. So it happens again. I hope layoffs don't occur, but it wouldn't be surprising at this point, especially on the Activision side.

49:16.000 --> 49:24.000
I don't think Blizzard is going to be as hurt by this as we think. I think Blizzard's already made those cutbacks with what we've seen happen with Heroes of the Storm and so on.

49:24.000 --> 49:30.000
But I think I would worry a little more for the Activision side and I hope we're wrong and I hope this is all just rumors. But you know what?

49:30.000 --> 49:38.000
Some of the interesting things that the big companies have had to deal with lately is that, you know, how many, how many times we've heard this story?

49:38.000 --> 49:49.000
Developers that used to work for XYZ big company have spun off and started their own indie studio and developed this indie darling for PC and Switch, PlayStation 4.

49:49.000 --> 49:57.000
You know, how often are we hearing that these days? So, you know, even for folks that may unfortunately experience a layoff with Activision,

49:57.000 --> 50:11.000
I hope folks are able to find the diamond in the rough, you know, is that maybe new studios will be birthed where they can do something on a smaller budget, you know, with a smaller risk and maybe still a great reward because a lot of those indie titles are still doing pretty well for themselves.

50:11.000 --> 50:20.000
Yeah. So we'll see. Anyway, I want to move on to another story because I think in some ways this is actually related a little bit. Bear with me.

50:20.000 --> 50:37.000
I want to talk about The Behemoth from this week. Like literally second story slot on our last episode was, oh, we're hearing rumors that EA might drop this game called Apex Legends on us this next week from the Titanfall developers.

50:37.000 --> 50:49.000
We didn't know a whole lot besides that, right? Well, it dropped on Monday and boy did it drop because they are saying that as far as Apex Legends go, it is landed hugely.

50:49.000 --> 51:01.000
What were they saying? I think it was saying 10 million people within the first like already and it's not even been out a week and 10 million people have already downloaded it and experienced it up to, I think they said a million people online at the same time.

51:01.000 --> 51:09.000
And now some blogs and some sites are questioning, could Apex Legends be a threat to Fortnite's dominance?

51:09.000 --> 51:18.000
And this kind of ties back to what Bobby was saying is that at one point we all thought EverQuest was going to be The Behemoth that can never be toppled.

51:18.000 --> 51:32.000
Now here we are looking at a game that at least this week, we'll see what the longevity holds, but at least this week has managed to really put a little, a little bruise on Fortnite.

51:32.000 --> 51:39.000
Go look at what the top streaming games are on Twitch. I don't know what they are right now, but I'm going to guess it's Apex Legends.

51:40.000 --> 51:47.000
Almost like a hero shooter battle royale type game. They kind of took a little bit from Overwatch.

51:47.000 --> 52:05.000
Yeah, they did. And, um, you know, and I'm sure one thing that many of you have been hearing about Apex Legends as well is that, uh, there's some very strong, uh, representation in the game, you know, which I know some people go a big deal, but you know, for some people, yes, it's a big deal because it's like, oh, you get to see yourself, you know, represented in the game.

52:05.000 --> 52:18.000
Okay. Like to me, like, and I was thinking about this earlier, like a lot of these announcements nowadays seem very forced. Like it's like, we're just including it just, I'm going to stop you right there because it's not the developers.

52:18.000 --> 52:30.000
It's not these people that are forcing it. What's happening. And this is the mistake so many fucking people are making. I'm sorry. I get very passionate about this because when you read the responses to things on Twitter, it's like, so what, who cares?

52:30.000 --> 52:42.000
And all this stuff. Well, for one, when I hear that there's like a gay dude in, um, Apex Legends, I go, well, I care. That's pretty awesome in a way. But here's the thing, you know, who's making a big deal out of it.

52:42.000 --> 52:57.000
They're usually, these things are in little quotes. So for example, there was a interview that they did with this website, rock paper shotgun, which I don't even, I've heard of that site, but it's not, oh, I'm going to be real shady here for a minute.

52:57.000 --> 53:07.000
It's not like the one I'm going to go to every day. Right? Right. It's not an, a little God, somebody's going to send this to them and they're going to hate us. It's not like the A-list site that everybody knows about.

53:07.000 --> 53:19.000
You know what I mean? When it comes to gaming news, right? They were asked in an interview if this, uh, is, is bloodhound non-binary and it was confirmed that fact. Okay. So it was asked in this one interview, not a big deal, right?

53:19.000 --> 53:35.000
It was asked in an interview question by this outlet that wanted to know the answer. The answer was given. Then what happened, Loki? Every other website takes it and runs with it. The developer didn't make a big deal out of it, Loki. Everybody else did.

53:35.000 --> 53:53.000
All right. I'm just thinking back to like, you know, the original Metroid one, we didn't even know the main character's gender in that game. I mean, and it, it just, it didn't matter because it's just a fucking video game. It doesn't like, it doesn't matter. Like what do I care about the sexuality of this person that's killing other people is, I mean, it's, it's just the person killing another person.

53:53.000 --> 54:04.000
There's, there was no internet at the time, Loki. So it's a little bit different because if the internet had been out, then probably, you know, that, that little spoiler probably would have been out there a lot sooner.

54:04.000 --> 54:08.000
I mean, I get it. It was, when that happened, it was a big deal, you know?

54:08.000 --> 54:32.000
Right, but why? I get it. Chicks can be heroes too. No, I get that it's important to some people, but I'm, what I'm trying to say is that like, unless the game is having me engage in sex with people, I don't see how the sexuality of the character even comes into play at all in the, as, I mean, it's cool to have that as the background of the character, but it doesn't really, it's not a part of the game, I guess.

54:32.000 --> 54:36.000
Okay. So play the game then.

54:36.000 --> 54:47.000
Exactly. I don't care about that. I'm just like, I don't, I'm just thinking like from an outsider looking, it's just like we see a lot more of these announcements that, oh yeah, this character is this person now. Oh, this character is this. And it's like,

54:47.000 --> 54:51.000
It wasn't an announcement. That's where I'm correcting you. It wasn't an announcement.

54:51.000 --> 54:54.000
But what about like on the Overwatch side of things?

54:55.000 --> 55:07.000
They also remember with Blizzard, also remember that they were under a lot of pressure because when you look at the characters in World of Warcraft, it's a lot of, you know, big titty delves and you know, there was very low stereotype there.

55:07.000 --> 55:17.000
So they were under a lot of pressure to really make, you know, make something that reflects the fucking real world. And so when they did Overwatch, they did a really good job, but it's also, Loki, it is kind of the same thing.

55:17.000 --> 55:28.000
Blizzard did not put out a press release that said she's gay. They didn't do that. What happened is that they put it in one comic book. They said, by the way, Trish got a girlfriend, you know, there's a nice story.

55:28.000 --> 55:41.000
And for those that are gay, it's like, Oh my God, like somebody, like there's somebody out there like me. It's not always like the same thing. I see something that actually represents me a little bit. And then everybody else runs with the headline.

55:42.000 --> 55:51.000
It's Kotaku and it's all these other websites. Sorry, I'm picking on one, but it's all these sites. It's rock, paper, shotgun. It's everybody that's running the headlines and saying, Tracer's gay.

55:51.000 --> 55:57.000
All right, cool. Yeah, I don't know. Neat.

55:57.000 --> 56:06.000
Um, let's see. Uh, let's see. Uh, Darted Studio says, I do kind of get where Loki's coming from though. To be fair, I'm all for representation. I mean it is, it is a little exhausting.

56:06.000 --> 56:16.000
I'm not saying there shouldn't be representation. I'm just saying like, cause there's some people that are like, Oh, there's, there's, you know, people that aren't, men are, you know, are, are straight.

56:16.000 --> 56:31.000
Well then I'm just not going to play this game. And there's stupid people out there. But like, I don't know. I just don't, I don't even know why people are asking these questions. I, whatever. I guess it's, it's cool. They can ask whatever they want.

56:31.000 --> 56:43.000
Well, I think, I think in Bloodhound's case, it's very ambiguous in the game is that, and I think there were a lot of people going, well, looking at how diverse this cast is, Bloodhound, you can't see Bloodhound's face.

56:43.000 --> 56:56.000
So, and the voice is kind of, you're not sure. So I think there were a lot of people going, is Bloodhound male? Is Bloodhound female? And so I think somebody asked the question, like, where is Bloodhound male or female? And the answer was, Bloodhound is neither.

56:56.000 --> 57:07.000
Bloodhound is a non-binary character. Oh, wait, that's a thing. People can be non-binary. Yeah. And you wouldn't have known cause the game never showed it to you before.

57:07.000 --> 57:08.000
I guess that's cool.

57:08.000 --> 57:19.000
Yeah. So that's just, but anyway, okay. Let's back up from that. Obviously that is exciting and all that other stuff. I mean, as far as, you know, Loki someday it won't be such a big deal.

57:19.000 --> 57:28.000
Someday, someday it'll just be like, oh cool. Like, you know, there's a couple, you know, black women that are a part of this squad and we see that all the time.

57:28.000 --> 57:36.000
So I'm used to seeing that now because yes, a certain population of the planet happens to be black women. And so, you know, like there will come a time. We're not at that time.

57:36.000 --> 57:42.000
And especially if you look at all the other stuff in society, I can talk to you off about this for hours and hours. I'm not going to do that.

57:42.000 --> 58:00.000
Right. Let's go back to the whole apex legends and the, um, you know, the, the impact that it's having here today gone tomorrow. I'm not saying Fortnite's going to go under or anything like that, but it is very interesting how the attitudes in gaming and how the gaming community and so forth that can shift on a dime.

58:00.000 --> 58:16.000
You know what I mean? And it's like, if I am Epic and I am the creators of Fortnite, you bet your ass I'm watching this going, oh shit, somebody's here to, you know, snatch a lot of the people that are looking at Fortnite because it is another battle royale game.

58:16.000 --> 58:22.000
But to be fair, didn't Fortnite do that to PUBG? Right?

58:22.000 --> 58:35.000
Yeah. And look, PUBG's doing fine for itself. It's still a game that a lot of people are playing. Fortnite's not going to die. I mean, you can't play apex legends on the switch or mobile phones. So Fortnite's still a thing there.

58:35.000 --> 58:43.000
So I'm not saying like, oh, there can be only one. That's not what I'm saying. But you've got it. Like the dominance, the king of the pack, the number one movie at the box office.

58:43.000 --> 58:52.000
That's going to change at some point as attitudes start changing. And so apex legends like literally came out of nowhere and has now kind of done that.

58:52.000 --> 59:04.000
And I'm sure that free price tag has gone a long way in doing that. But, you know, a lot of people I think also appreciate, yes, they do loot boxes, but they tell you the percentages right up front. Right.

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
And these other things that they're doing.

59:07.000 --> 59:16.000
And also like with that, though, it's like, I don't feel as bad with loot boxes in a game that's free to play. You know, it's not like you're trying to sell me a $60 game.

59:16.000 --> 59:29.000
And by the way, you also need to buy the season pass and you need to buy all these loot boxes because we need to make all the money and we're still not meeting our expectations. So let's fire 100 people.

59:30.000 --> 59:40.000
Questbuster says it also helps that when apex legends dropped, it wasn't a demo or a beta. It was a finished triple a battle royale that no one expected. And it's been holding up quite well, which is interesting.

59:40.000 --> 59:47.000
Now, isn't this interesting? Apex legends essentially is an EA game, right? Because respawn and it's through origin. It's an EA game.

59:48.000 --> 59:59.000
So now I'm looking at Anthem and they had kind of a trouble demo weekend, but this apex legends has had no problems.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:07.000
Now I'm not going to look every time I try to talk about why can't the servers just fucking work. I hear from the tech people on why the servers can't just fucking work.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:15.000
But let's be real. The consumers have got to be looking at this going apex. I mean, it's had some hiccups. I had like a difficult.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:19.000
I couldn't connect to the server right away, but I literally clicked retry and then it worked.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:24.000
So like just minor little hiccups. Apex legends has been kind of working, especially for a game that's free.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:32.000
You could say, though, that it could slightly undercut, you know, because that's where I'm going.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:37.000
It's free to play and it works versus paying $60 for something that it hopefully will work.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:51.000
If I were Bioware, I would be fucking livid right now. I would be livid that EA, my corporate bosses, allowed this game to drop four weeks before my big game.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Well, that's $60 to buy that had a forced online early staggered thing done by the publisher.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:05.000
So some of the early warts could be exposed. All that stuff is is it's it's going to cut into sales.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Well, to be fair, respawn and kind of hat was on the opposite end of that spectrum.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Come Battlefield or Battlefield one and Titanfall two.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:25.000
You remember they released Titanfall two and then it got butchered by, I think, Battlefield one and the Call of Duty game.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:35.000
So. Yeah, so now at least they have something that's come out that hopefully won't be will be doing all of the undercutting instead.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:42.000
But I am very disappointed that Titans aren't in the game because it is in the Titanfall universe, but there's no giant robots or wall running.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:48.000
You do call things down. Like the gal that you play in the very beginning, she's some sort of medic that you play the tutorial level.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:54.000
And like her ultimate is she calls down a big like heel thing or like a heel thing.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:59.000
It's a pod that has supplies in it, like heel supplies. And you see it come down from space and all that stuff.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:04.000
So there's there's elements from the Titanfall games that that kind of make their way in there.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
The Titans, I know. Well, I mean, this is the beginning.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.000
There's only like, what, eight characters in the game, like in six.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000
And then also like all the wall running and stuff that they had in Titanfall is pretty awesome.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Like if they had that kind of movement in this.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.000
So, I mean, wait, because a lot of that stuff may be a reality later on down the line.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:25.000
I would like to see more like things that I don't necessarily have to team up with other people to do.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
But we'll see. We'll see. I don't know.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Well, I just need to get in there and play already and then maybe I'll kind of change my mind.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Oh, it was really fun. It wasn't that bad. We'll see.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:38.000
So but I liked what little little very little I played of Apex Legends so far.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:44.000
But I really I really think this nobody I don't think was expecting it to do this well.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000
And it's going to have some very interesting ripple effects.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:52.000
I think Anthem again, I mean, I might be surprised and the anthem just runs away.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:58.000
But I think that game is being set up to fail in so many ways that, like, again, if I am Bioware,

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000
I'm just like, why are you doing this to us?

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Because it's going to fail to meet expectations.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:11.000
And then hundreds of people are going to get laid off because they have to mitigate costs or something.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:16.000
It's going to be really it's and it's the sad thing is going to be EA's fucking fault all across.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.000
This is what they do. They eat studios.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Anyway, so but there's that. But then what about like, you know, the Fortnite?

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:28.000
It's not that I'm saying like Fortnite is like just suddenly disappear, but maybe Fortnite's dominance is, you know,

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000
maybe it's going to be the number two game on Twitch now for a little bit or at least.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Or if anything, maybe like PUBG or something is going to get, you know, kind of.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Yeah, I think they both will. And I think, you know, any game that's out there, you know, that you only have so many,

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.000
so much time in the day to play so many games. So I think all the games are gonna be feeling that.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:48.000
But I think now we also see a little more about why Epic has been trying to do more besides just Fortnite.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:56.000
They have used their time at the top of the heap very wisely to launch a new store that gives away free games

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:02.000
and ties in with their publishing platform that gives a better cut.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000
They've been using their time on the top of the heat to heap to the best of their ability,

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000
because maybe in a way Epic has also foreseen we can't be on the top forever.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Yeah.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Because tons of people have been trying to come for the battle royale crown.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:18.000
Just nobody has quite succeeded at this level yet. But here we are now.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Apex Legends has really come out of the blue. We'll see if they maintain it.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000
After the next genre will come along and then, you know.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000
That will be up to respawn in EA. You're right. Then there'll be another thing.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:33.000
So, um, let's see. Frodo's wagons and chat says they're going to make a lot of money with this game though.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Perhaps we'll lead to something else one day. We'll see.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Sjoan Hunter-Matt says the shitty thing is they're going to put all this effort to get the servers working for Anthem,

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.000
only to shut them down in a few short years if the game doesn't sell well.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000
And then Frodo's wagons also says probably a good thing because Titanfall never got that big.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:55.000
And as Bobby pointed out, again, Titanfall 2 was released right next to another game that took all the attention you were kind of getting into.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Well, that's another thing, yeah. Like speaking about Anthem there, like I know you like your BioWare games and stuff like that,

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:09.000
but like, it's kind of hard for me to sell me on a game that is, given EA's track record, may be unplayable in a few years.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:16.000
I mean, that's pretty, and the same can be said about like the last Call of Duty, Call of Duty Black Ops 4.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:23.000
I mean, that game will be unplayable in a few, you know, at some point when they shut the servers down.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:29.000
I really do think, I think EA's gonna, the person EA's gonna hurt most of all with the success of this game is EA.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:38.000
But we'll see. Maybe I'll be wrong. What do I know? I'm some schmo on the internet with a podcast. What do I know? You know?

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000
So, we'll see. Maybe I'll be proven completely wrong.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.000
But for now, we'll move on to our next story, Loki.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:57.000
So, since we were talking about Epic and Fortnite, we can also talk about Nintendo because we did reference to them earlier in their online platform and how they have some creative ways to do voice chat.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Well, you may remember when Fortnite came out on the Switch, it said,

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Fuck your stupid way using the app. We just will have you plug in a microphone into the Switch and it'll just fucking work.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:19.000
And so, now they are licensing that voice chat software to other companies that want to be able to put it in their own games.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:25.000
So, the company, Vivox, they are focused on voice and text chat in online games.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:33.000
So, basically, they are going to authorize Switch developers that can integrate the Vivox SDK software kit into their games.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Which allowed Switch owners to be able to play games and be able to do voice chat using just the existing audio jack on the Switch itself.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:53.000
And not some stupid phone Switch headset splitter hybrid bullshit that you have to do.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Because it just works.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:07.000
So, they are saying that the chat tools will also allow Switch games that incorporate cross-play with PC, Xbox One, or Playstation 4 to work as well.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.000
And, yeah. It's pretty awesome.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:16.000
So, interesting that somebody besides Nintendo solved one of Nintendo's online biggest problems.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
This is so fucking dumb.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Well, maybe. And you know what? Maybe Nintendo is going to look at this own thing and just be like, well, we're just going to, you know, if they decide ultimately they want to get rid of the app.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:34.000
I think, Loki, I think the whole time the Switch could have done this perfectly well, I think Nintendo wanted that app to be a big deal.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Nintendo wanted that app on everybody's phones because at some point they wanted that app to be like a central hub for Nintendo's growth into the mobile phone thing.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:50.000
So that you could tap other buttons within the map to go right to Mario Run or the upcoming Dr. Mario or things like this.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
This was part of a bigger picture.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
But did they ever do any of that with the app?

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
No, it's part of a bigger picture that never came together.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
That's what I truly think is happening here.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
I don't think the Switch ever needed that app.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Nintendo wanted to make you get that app.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:06.000
But it's just like, it's basically like...

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Thank you. Bobby phrases this another way.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.000
They wanted that app to be a Trojan horse like how Discord did it. That's what I'm saying.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:19.000
But it sounds to me like when I was working at previous companies and they're like,

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Oh, well this company is doing this and they have an app. We should have an app because they have an app.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Do you really need an app?

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Loki, all the other podcasts have an app.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Why doesn't O.L.R. have an app?

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Shouldn't O.L.R. have an app so you can like download, I don't know, extra shows and I don't know, behind the scenes things and other stuff.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Don't we need an app?

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
They have an app. Why can't we have an app?

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
I don't know. Bobby, why don't we have an app?

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Get working on it, Bobby. We need an app.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Maybe Bobby doesn't want to do a fucking app.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Now what do we do?

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:58.000
Well, gonna have to cobble something together.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Here's the thing. The point is, and you know...

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.000
I still have my old O.L.R. PSP file somewhere.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.000
And that was the thing we did that worked for us that not a lot of people did.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
They have a PSP website. Why don't we have a PSP website?

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:15.000
And no disrespect to any podcast with apps. There's an awful lot of them, right?

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:21.000
My whole thing is just that what works for one person might not just be in another person's wheelhouse right now, you know what I mean?

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.000
It might not just be what another person's looking to do at this time.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Sometimes the measure of success is not just copying what everybody else is doing.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Even though the gaming industry tends to do that a lot.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
So, anyway, what are you smirking about?

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Bobby, where's our battle royale game?

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
What the hell?

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Let's see. As soon as Matt's like, Bobby's like, pay me.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Poor chat. You leave Bobby alone. He's trying to do his own damn show.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
So, anyway.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Okay. I guess we'll move on. I guess we ran out of steam on that topic.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:05.000
So, let's talk about Axiom Verge being the free game on the Epic Storefront right now.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:12.000
So, Epic Games Store had Axiom Verge as the free game and apparently it was broken for a hot minute.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Now, I was gone this weekend, so I didn't get to get it until today and I think it's already fixed.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:22.000
But here's the irony. The Epic Games version was broken because of something about steam.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.000
But it's not totally what you think. Here's the deal.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:31.000
So, some tweets started going out to Epic and developer Tom Happ who made Axiom Verge.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Because, you know, despite however you might feel about Axiom Verge, it's pretty fucking impressive that one person did that whole game.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:42.000
Soundtrack, design, art, like everything. So, props to Tom because that game is pretty awesome.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.000
So, anyway. Then Tom Happ put out a tweet.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:53.000
For anyone missing steam.xmb from the Epic Store, please go to AV in your library, click the gear icon, verify, then update.

01:10:53.000 --> 01:11:00.000
I was thinking, it being Epic and all, I shouldn't include Valve's DLLs and such.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.000
So, I excluded all files with steam in the name. Oops.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:11.000
And what happened is that when you would go into one room that had these steam pipes, they made a sound effect.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:18.000
And the sound file was called steam something something. Well, he deleted that file. So, guess what made the game crash?

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:26.000
So, in his effort to, oh, I gotta scrub all the references to steam. No, no, but this was actual steam.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000
I'm simplifying it greatly.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:37.000
He was just giving you, you know, a brief emulation of how some games work on steam.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Whereas they don't because they're broken and there's no quality control.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:46.000
And at the end of the day, it was free. So, you can't complain about that much.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:51.000
And it's one of those things, you know, you gotta love it or hate it. I know people have feelings on the Epic Store.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:12:01.000
It's free free. Not like sign up for a subscription and get a free game every two, no, it's just sign up for the free store account.

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Which, granted, means you're gonna get spam email, but everybody has a pocket email address.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
All their spam email goes to. Come on.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:09.000
That's all of them.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.000
And people sign up for it and get the free game.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.000
I was trying to see if I already have this game. I think I have it somewhere.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:21.000
You might have it in Steam or you might have it on, I think it was a free game on PlayStation Plus at one point.

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:22.000
Yeah.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.000
So, I think a lot of people have it on PlayStation Plus.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
I'm surprised they don't have it on Steam.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:30.000
It's a really, I mean, obviously it's heavily inspired by Super Metroid, but it's not a copy either.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:36.000
Like a lot of the, you know, like power ups and things you use to get through the game are very different.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:44.000
So, but I would, I mean, if you haven't played Axiom Verge, there's no better time than the present because you have that free one on PC.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.000
So, I would say check it out.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Frodo's Wagon says, what's the game about?

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:53.000
I actually have a hard time remembering the story. I think it's one of those you wake up and you're not sure what's going on type of thing.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
But you're obviously like you're in an alien landscape.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
And I remember there's things about hacking.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:03.000
A lot of hacking comes in because you like end up like hacking walls to make new walls and you actually like glitch things out.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
And that's an intended part of the game mechanic.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000
So, but it's all like 2D Super Metroid style.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:18.000
So, that's, that's more the way I've tried to like explain the game to other people is it's, oh, it's Super Metroid, but like different power ups, different kind of mechanic.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:21.000
But at the end of the day, you know, it's that same type of setup.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
I see you going to the Epic Store and getting it right now.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Well, it expires on the 21st. I just want to make sure I don't forget.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Might as well, right? Of course.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
All right.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.000
Metal Mayhem says Origin was giving out games left and right for a while, remember?

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:38.000
But then again, compared to Steam, Origin is the redheaded stepchild.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.000
So, well, interestingly enough, did they stop giving out?

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:44.000
I mean, they were only EA games because EA is Origin.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.000
I don't know.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Did they stop? I don't remember.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:54.000
But, well, if you think about it, though, this Apex Legends is free and it's a pretty high quality game.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:59.000
You know, it's obviously got the loot box mechanics and other types of pay mechanics in there.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:02.000
But for the most part, you get a pretty rich experience for free.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.000
So maybe that's just the direction they've decided to go in at this point.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.000
I don't know.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000
Anyway, let's move on. Loki, let's get to your story.

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.000
All right.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:16.000
So, Microsoft is basically...

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:20.000
Sorry, quickly, Pixel Pacas does say, I think Origin did stop their free game a month ago.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
They probably ran out of games to give away, honestly.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.000
Yeah.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.000
So Microsoft's making a slight rebrand of their game studio.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:32.000
So instead of Microsoft Studios now making your favorite games on the Microsoft platforms,

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:39.000
you can look forward to Xbox Game Studios as making those games on that platform.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:46.000
So they're rebranding and they have all those different studios, which we still don't know what the fuck they're making.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.000
But there's a lot of studios that are...

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Yes, we do.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
We know they're making things for the next console.

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.000
That's what they're making.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
But what things for the next console?

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Wait till June and find out. A few of them.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.000
I don't want to wait.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
Typical gamer.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
As far as the rename goes, what do you think?

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
I think this is a big deal.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
I think nobody cares.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:10.000
The average consumer does not care about what title is on their splash screen.

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:18.000
Yeah, basically their excuse is, well, Microsoft Studios stands at 13 distinct and diverse game development teams.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:24.000
And with this new rebranding, they're going to be organized under one letter.

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Okay, yay for reorganization.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:34.000
But I think at the end of the day also, I think this has a lot to do with maybe Microsoft really wanting Xbox to be synonymous with gaming,

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.000
especially when it comes to like PC and their actual boxes.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Oh yeah, because they're going to be doing the Xbox stuff from PC.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Right, exactly.

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:48.000
So I think this is more about a shift to getting you to think like when you think Xbox, you think games, which is what they want to do.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:54.000
And they want to leverage their dominance in the operating system industry to kind of do that a little bit.

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
And I think that's what this is really all about.

01:15:56.000 --> 01:16:03.000
But otherwise for them, I mean, this is and this is also like I'm really kind of like diving into the whole like brands and what does it mean?

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.000
And, you know, the whole stuff.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:08.000
But I think for the average consumer, it's like, eh, just sell me a good game.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Is Crackdown 3 going to be good or not?

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
That's that's what the average consumer cares about.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:17.000
So anyway. All right, moving on.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:24.000
Let's talk about a kind of a surprise release of a very old game on the Nintendo Switch.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:31.000
And I actually noticed this, too, going into the store because I was trying to look at some of the other games that have released recently,

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:37.000
which, by the way, shout out to the game Tangledeep, because remember, we had that guy on OLR that made that game.

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
God, it was probably about two years ago or whatever.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000
I think they were doing a Kickstarter for the publishing at the time.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.000
Yeah. I don't like to get a lot of Kickstarters on OLR anymore.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:53.000
And I think I think in general, less people are doing them because so many of the Kickstarter projects like where is Bloodstained still?

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:57.000
I mean, yes, we have the the eight bit inspired version, but I mean, we're still waiting on that.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:05.000
But anyway, my point is, I don't usually like to get Kickstarters here anymore unless it is like for the publishing costs or like you already have a game ready to go.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
You just need a little help getting it out the door.

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:11.000
But anyway, that was we had them on the show and they're out on the Switch store.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
So there they were on the store this week. So I saw that.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:21.000
But anyway, but what I also wanted to shout out was that I also noticed Commander Keen and I was like, what?

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Did they reboot Commander Keen?

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
I don't remember talking about this on OLR.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:28.000
This would have caught my eye that they're like remaking Commander Keen for the Switch.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:39.000
No, no, this this was a surprise release of Commander Keen in Keen Dreams, which I don't think was the original series.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
I think it was one of the later ones.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:47.000
If I remember, I'm trying to remember. Keen Dreams, I think, came a little later, but it was, you know, it was a little bit more platformer on PC.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:50.000
But here's the thing about it. Is it a remaster for the Switch?

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:57.000
No, it's the PC game in all of its VGA graphic glory.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:01.000
Oh, VGA. I'm sure that looks more like EGA to me.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Well, yeah, but I mean, that's that is literally it. That's what you're paying for.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
The actual original game.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:15.000
But I did think it was kind of neat. I was like, wow, this like old school 90s PC game is just all of a sudden on the Switch.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:21.000
That's kind of cool. But then I'm like, wow, if this sells well, I mean, unleash the hounds.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:24.000
We're going to have all sorts of like 90s retro things.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.000
ZZT for Switch. Hell, yeah.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:32.000
But OK, why not? Why not? The original Duke Nukem or Jill of the Jungle?

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:36.000
Yeah. Jazz Jackrabbit.

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:40.000
Oh, my gosh. Anyway, but I thought that was kind of neat.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:45.000
I don't know. That should be like the like, you know, how they have the Sonic racing game.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:49.000
They should have Jazz Jackrabbit as the character, because why not? Why not?

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Danica Patrick. Why not? They should do an Apogee racing game.

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:56.000
I kind of don't think that's going to happen anyway.

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:59.000
So I thought that was like kind of like a nice little surprise release on the switch this week.

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:03.000
So, hey, if you're into the old classic 90s games, go check it out.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:08.000
Also, an interesting little thing, because I bet a lot of people like if you're downloading and playing that game today,

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:14.000
you're probably experiencing it through like abandonware where people have made up this law that says,

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:19.000
oh, they don't sell game. If they haven't sold a game in a year, you can just pirate it for free.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
I don't know what they made up with that whole thing.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:25.000
But it's like this kind of proves that they don't necessarily want you to do that,

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:31.000
because they may still like whoever owns the rights to the game may want to put it out on a new console or what have you.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:39.000
So anyway. All right. Let's move on to let's move on to some other classic games

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:43.000
in a regular segment that we do here called the Classic Game of the Week.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:51.000
And so we venture through the portal of time and space, the portal labeled Radio Magic,

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:57.000
and visit the Classic Game of the Week, where we are joined by the one and only Dark Sakura or Jamie Summers.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
Oh, hi.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:00.000
Hi, how are you?

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
I'm OK. How are you?

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:10.000
I am good. It is nice to have you here once again, even if by phone and even if graciously while you're on a break from your work.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
But it's always good to have you here on the show.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:16.000
And I know you're going to be back full time very, very soon. So very happy to have it.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:19.000
And there may even be a surprise before that.

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:25.000
Oh, can't wait. Well, anyway, no surprise here, because we've done this segment for a very, very, very long time.

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:29.000
It's the Classic Game of the Week where you're going to jump into the gaming vault and find a game that,

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:34.000
hey, these kids should be checking out this game this week. What did you pick?

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:38.000
This literally will not fit in my vault right now, but maybe my garage.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Excuse me. It's Alpine Racer.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:48.000
It was a 3D skiing game that came out by Namco in 1994.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:52.000
I played a lot more of the sequels in this than starting at the beginning.

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:58.000
Basically, the very first game really just had three courses and two modes.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:04.000
It was you would either do downhill or gate racing and then you had the three courses for each.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:07.000
And then you had race and time attack.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:16.000
So you actually stood on a set of like skis that would move and you held on to the stability bars to play.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:21.000
And believe it or not, it actually came out in North America first.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:27.000
It came out September 11th, 1994. And then in Japan, it came out in June 1995.

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:39.000
It was on Namco's system, 22 arcade systems, which the other stuff that came out on it was, let's see, Ridge Racer.

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:47.000
The other stuff that came out on it was, let's see what else, Time Crisis,

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Air Combat 22, Dirt Dash, Rave Racer, Tokyo Wars, Prop Cycle.

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:59.000
So there were, you know, that puts things in perspective for people.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:05.000
But as far as the game itself, it did get a sequel called Alpine Racer 2 that also ran on system 22 software.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000
It had three different skiers that you could choose.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:13.000
And then you could play two players simultaneously with two cabinets linked.

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:18.000
And then, of course, there was a sequel to that, Alpine Racer 3, which came out on the PS2.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:24.000
And then they made a remake for the iPhone and iPod Touch and it was ported to whatever the Zeebo is.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
I have to see what a Zeebo is.

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:30.000
3D enabled entertainment and education system from Zeebo Inc.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
Oooh, okay, whatever that is.

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:36.000
So that's the sequel.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:40.000
It actually had another sequel to the game.

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:46.000
It came out in 2013 called Super Alpine Racer by Bondi Namco Games.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:54.000
As for its production, it was actually considered to be one of the best and most unique and realistic games of its time for its controls.

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:58.000
It gave five out of five stars to Next Generation Magazine for, quote,

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:01.000
a typical approach in its success and execution.

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:07.000
And then it won best new equipment at the 1995 New Music Operators Association Expo.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:16.000
This was, I think, one of those big games that really got racing games sort of out of the car and onto your feet.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:21.000
Yeah, I remember, didn't they have one of these at Golf Land back in the day when we were discovered DDR?

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Like, I feel like I remember there being a big, like, skiing thing.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.000
They had an Alpine Racer 2, which is like the one that they looked up.

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Gotcha. Okay, so close enough, close enough.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:36.000
And yeah, you're right about the complicated setup, meaning that probably not a ton, a ton of people.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:39.000
I mean, you know, if you had a big arcade near you, you probably saw this game.

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:44.000
But there is an extremely limited amount of footage of this game out there online,

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.000
at least things that are ripped directly from the video feed.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:51.000
I mean, there's some, like, over the shoulder video that's not as glamorous to look at,

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
just because, you know, there's a lot of background noise and stuff.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:58.000
But I'm really having to rely on the PlayStation sequel to give us some footage tonight,

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
just because the original was pretty limited.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:03.000
I think this game probably is better known for the sequels.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Well, the other thing about, though, especially with Alpine Racer 2,

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:11.000
it actually was involved in a sleep study with Tetris.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:16.000
It was used by a Harvard sleep scientist named Robert Stickle

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
to study the relationship between learning and sleep.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:23.000
He found that after playing the game for hours before going to sleep,

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:30.000
subjects suffering from interrogate amnesia, which is the inability to form new memories,

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
would dream about skiing.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Huh. I wonder if that's, well, I don't think it's the same study,

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:42.000
but it's interesting to note that, you know, the recent release Tetris Effect was that whole thing.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
The Tetris Effect was named after a study.

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
I know I'm deviating from what this game is,

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:51.000
but it is interesting how video games used in studies really kind of, you know,

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000
kind of show us a little something about ourselves.

01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:55.000
Yeah, for sure.

01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:02.000
So, I mean, basically, I think that a lot of, you know,

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:09.000
anything that we do that stimulates the brain and leads to, you know,

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:13.000
leads to something that's going to have an impact on what you've done in your day

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000
would still bring in that same sort of thing.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
I had the same thing happen with DDR.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:21.000
That's actually how I learned not to, you know, go back to the center every time,

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:24.000
is I dreamed of myself playing without going back to the center,

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
and after that, I never had any problems with DDR.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Huh, interesting.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:31.000
Interesting how dreams can impact real life like that.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.000
Well...

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:35.000
I miss SpeedCuber's dream about Rubik's Cube algorithms.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:39.000
Well, I don't know if there's much more to say about Alpine Racer,

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000
so there it is, your classic game of the week.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Alpine Racer!

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
Yay!

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Just because we didn't have a lot to say on it this week compared to some of the other previous weeks

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000
doesn't mean it's not an important game,

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000
because obviously, you know, you have the sequels,

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:54.000
but it looked great for its time, as you kind of mentioned.

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:57.000
Like, it really was kind of ahead of its time in its way.

01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:01.000
And in some ways, I don't know, it's similar.

01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:04.000
Obviously, you have, like, Ridge Racer, and you have Alpine Racers.

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:07.000
There's kind of, like, some similarities there, but there's some things even I don't know.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.000
It was all Namco.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:09.000
Yeah, yeah, exactly. Why not?

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:13.000
They probably were, had a lot of stuff in common kind of at its core,

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000
but yeah, a lot that I really enjoyed.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:16.000
They ran under the same equipment.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.000
Yeah.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:20.000
So, well, I know that was a little short,

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
but we'll get back to the show here in just a moment.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:25.000
But quickly, I thought I'd just kind of see, like, how have you been?

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:28.000
What kind of games have you been playing this week

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:31.000
while you unfortunately haven't been with us on OLR?

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Still Resident Evil 2, you know? Shoot them in the head, shoot them in the head.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:39.000
I'm so absolutely into this game for more of its graphical things now

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:43.000
and noticing, like, the Easter eggs and background detail.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:46.000
But this is going to sound completely disgusting.

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
I don't know if I've talked about it before.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:52.000
I'm really pleased with how they've rendered anatomy

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:56.000
because, um, what you do with the zombies.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.000
I think you did mention a little bit of this when you did the original Resident Evil

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
a couple weeks ago as your classic game,

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000
because you kind of talked about how this new one, you were like,

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000
wow, the kills are very real.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Well, it's not really just a matter of that.

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:12.000
It's just that, you know, they are, depending on the bullet you use,

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:15.000
you know, you have the effects on the body.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:18.000
I do miss the mags. I'm completely blown to head wide open.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
But, you know, it's still pretty fun.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:24.000
And just, like, those little details to me make the game live a little bit more.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.000
And the voice acting is tremendously amazing.

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:31.000
Okay. Well, Jamie, it's great to talk to you as always

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:34.000
and hope to see you back here real, real soon.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:37.000
Any parting thoughts or parting words for our listeners this week?

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:40.000
I've discovered that we have a jolly bee in town

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
and I've eaten there twice in the last three days.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
It's good stuff and I don't blame her.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Anyway, we are back in studio.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.000
What'd she say was in town?

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:48.000
Jolly bee.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.000
What's that?

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:53.000
It's like a fast food chain, but I think its roots are in Filipino related food.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:54.000
So, yeah.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.000
Cool.

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:56.000
So, anyway, we're back.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.000
Hi. Live in studio with our show already in progress.

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:05.000
Episode number 763 for tonight, February the 10th of 2019.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:10.000
Welcome to all those of you that are watching us live at twitch.tv slash vog network on Sunday night.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:14.000
And, of course, those that are listening along on our podcast feed as well.

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:17.000
We're going to get back into our show here with some rapid fire news.

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:21.000
Actually, real quick, though, I skipped something I was going to talk about earlier in the show.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:25.000
I accidentally did this, but I think you kind of touched on this a little bit as well.

01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.000
But the story I was going to talk about was Battlefield 5

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:31.000
and the hopes for how well that was going to sell in this whole thing.

01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000
I was supposed to talk about that when I talked about the Apex Legends and everything.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:39.000
But, apparently, Battlefield 5 did not sell as well as EA had hoped it would.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:44.000
The lowered outlook for revenue in the quarter is what EA did,

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:48.000
saying that the sales last quarter 2018 did not perform to their expectations.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:54.000
They didn't really say what it was, but that was their big flagship game was Battlefield 5.

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:58.000
And you remember this game got delayed.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:01.000
And so it was supposed to originally, I think, be in the spring.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000
And then it ended up getting pushed back a little bit.

01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:07.000
So kind of had some problems getting out there from the get-go.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Obviously, they have some good news now with everything that's going on with Apex Legends.

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:13.000
And I think some of their stock and that sort of thing is recovered a little bit.

01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000
So that's good, right?

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Yeah.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
Anyway, now let's get in. Sorry, I missed that earlier.

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
I was going to bring that up when we talked about EA

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
and how they've been coming and going.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:25.000
But let's get into some other rapid-fire news here, Loki.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:31.000
So, with Crackdown 3 right around the corner, you may want to play some Crackdown.

01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:39.000
So to be able to do that, Microsoft has made the original Crackdown free for everyone to download and play.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:43.000
So it's actually available through the Xbox One through backwards compatibility

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:45.000
because it wasn't originally in the 360 title.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:48.000
And you can go ahead and get it for free.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:55.000
I already got it for free the last time they had it available for free, which is around Crackdown 2.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.000
I don't know. It was a while ago, but I have it already.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:00.000
But it's awesome, and you should go check it out.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.000
And it's free, so you can't be free.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:09.000
And then, of course, there's the movies and everything.

01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:13.000
So I'm still waiting for my Sonic the Hedgehog trailer already.

01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:18.000
We saw a poster for it when I went to the movies yesterday to see the Lego Movie 2.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:24.000
But a movie that is still in the works is the Super Mario Bros. movie.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:28.000
And, of course, the Mario movie is going to be done by Illumination.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:33.000
Though it's not expected to be released any time soon, though.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:38.000
It's going to be released likely sometime in 2022.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
That's a little wait.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
So got a bit of a wait for that.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:47.000
We'll probably forget that there is even a Super Mario Bros. movie by then.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:51.000
But yeah, so you'll just have to wait.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:56.000
And instead you're just going to have to do what Sega is going to do when Nintendon't.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:02.000
And that's release a movie that's live action with Sonic the Hedgehog.

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:05.000
And oh god, it's going to be terrible.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:08.000
But I am totally seeing it because Jim Carrey is in it.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:11.000
Alright, let me get into some news as well.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:15.000
So the next Nintendo Switch Online titles have been revealed.

01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:20.000
So we're going to be getting Super Mario Bros. 2 and Kirby's Adventure

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:23.000
will be the games that we're going to be getting on Switch Online this month.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:26.000
So, I mean, those are both pretty huge titles.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.000
I think a lot of people knew Mario 2 especially was an inevitability.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000
It was just a matter of when.

01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:35.000
So the answer is this week, February 13th, I believe was the day those were getting added.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:38.000
So only two games for us.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:41.000
That's because Japan, again, getting the third game.

01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:44.000
So they're getting a game, and I'm sorry, guys, I forget the original title of the game,

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.000
but it's a sumo wrestling game that we never, because, you know,

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.000
sumo wrestling isn't quite as big here.

01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:53.000
But it was a Tecmo-related sumo wrestling game that they're getting as well.

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.000
So that's the third game.

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000
But what's interesting, they're getting Super Mario 2.

01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Now, a lot of people would think, oh, does that mean they're getting Doki Doki Panic?

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:04.000
No, no, no. They're getting Super Mario USA,

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:10.000
which, if you didn't already know, when Super Mario Bros. 2 was released in Japan,

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:15.000
R Mario 2 was released in Japan, they rebranded it as Super Mario USA.

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.000
Because they already had a Super Mario Bros. 2.

01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:18.000
They did.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:21.000
Which was our lost levels. Are you confused yet?

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:25.000
Well, that's how things were complicated before the internet existed.

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:29.000
Which doesn't make any sense, because they thought it was going to be too hard for, like, people to play it, I guess,

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000
was originally the thought.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:37.000
And to my recollection, we're in all games really hard back then anyways,

01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:41.000
so what would be the point if it was just a little bit harder?

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:46.000
You would just get used to it, because that's, it's just like, that's what games are, they're hard.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:50.000
It's also interesting to me that they released Super Mario USA in Japan,

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:53.000
when it was all based off Doki Doki Panic anyway.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:33:00.000
So, Japan had Doki Doki Panic, but, and here's, I think, the reason why they did not get Doki Doki Panic on their thing,

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:04.000
remember, that whole thing was an agreement with, like, Fuji Television?

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:05.000
Yeah.

01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:08.000
And so, the licenses are probably impossible to get renewed and so forth,

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:12.000
so that's, like, the closest they could do was to give Mario USA,

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:16.000
which, I don't know, maybe more people in Japan, that's what they actually played, maybe.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:22.000
I don't know what the sales of those two games were like, but I have a feeling Mario USA probably actually sold better

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:26.000
than the original Doki Doki Panic did, so, no. Anyway.

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:32.000
Metal Mayhem in our chat says, too hard? Motherfucker, have you not played an NES game ever?

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:35.000
Um, hello? Basically, like, a lot of the classic NES games.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Yeah, exactly. Like, all of the games.

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:44.000
Anyway, I am excited for Mario 2 on Switch, even though I know you're kind of over the Nintendo Online thing.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:48.000
Also, interesting to note, those are really primarily single-player games.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:52.000
I mean, I guess the sumo wrestling game is a little more head-to-head, but we're not getting that here.

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:57.000
But Mario 2 and Kirby, I mean, but Nintendo Switch Online, the whole thing is, like, sharing with other people, but...

01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:00.000
But isn't it, like, don't you take turns, though, and...

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:04.000
I don't think Mario 2 even has... Oh, maybe Kirby does, but I don't even think... Mario 2...

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
No, Mario 2 was only one player, yeah.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:12.000
I think Kirby was only really one player, too. I don't think it had a pass-the-controller type of mode on that, either, so...

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:16.000
Alright, moving on. Let's talk about Mortal Kombat 11.

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:25.000
So, still some more information trickling out about Mortal Kombat 11, including D'Vorah coming back from Mortal Kombat X, or X, into Mortal Kombat 11.

01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:29.000
That's the one where it's not the bees, not the bees, she's the bee lady.

01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000
Well, I think they're, like, actually wasps or things like that.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000
You know those wasps are gonna eat someone's face off.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:37.000
You know, I already know this thing's gonna have it, so people are excited about that.

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:40.000
Now we just need to get Nicolas Cage as a character.

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
And then it will be perfect.

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:46.000
Okay, you're starting to sound like the internet who wanted Shaggy as a character.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
Where the fuck did that even come from, and why...

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
It's a meme, but I'm down.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:56.000
Why is it on websites as, like, this is something we reported on, Shaggy is not in Mortal Kombat 11?

01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:02.000
No shit. That was never, or should I say nether, in the realm of possibility.

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:07.000
Because, first off, Shaggy's a licensed character in a kid's cartoon show.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:11.000
Just because the internet screams and whines and bakes or something doesn't mean they're gonna get it.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000
I guess once in a while they do, but they weren't gonna get this ever.

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:18.000
But Rob, they had Ninja Turtles in Infamous 2.

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
Well, also there wasn't...

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
Not Infamous 2, I'm sorry.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:25.000
Injustice 2.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:29.000
Also, there wasn't decapitations in Injustice 2, so it's a little different.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:32.000
The bees...

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:33.000
I'm fine with him.

01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:37.000
Can you imagine the horrors if the bees came out and chewed off his face?

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:38.000
Come on.

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
It would be awesome.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.000
Lord, anyway.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:46.000
So, I don't know, the internet's gonna internet, and Shaggy was a thing they internetted.

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:50.000
And NetherRealm came out and said, not gonna happen.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:56.000
Also, it was announced, though, Cabal was also announced this week, which was actually a character I really enjoyed in Mortal Kombat 3.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:04.000
Alan said, I'm waiting for you to get home because I want to make you watch the Cabal fatality that they showed during the livestream today.

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:08.000
So, I watched it, and I was just like...

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
This is my reaction.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:11.000
Why?

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
This is excessive.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.000
It's disgusting.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:15.000
Anyway.

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000
It's not excessive enough.

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:23.000
And Shad Leland's in our chat right now saying, Cabal's fatality was amazing to see when they showed it off.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:24.000
Of course, y'all are sick.

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.000
Anyway.

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:32.000
Moving on, one more story for you guys in rapid fire news.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
The Mega Man series apparently doing pretty good.

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:42.000
Capcom mentioning that the sales for Mega Man 11 and the Mega Man X Legacy Collection were both strong.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:46.000
That was according to their latest financial briefing for the nine months ending December 31st.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:53.000
So, apparently Mega Man 11 was a strong revival game, and it was probably good that they put it out on almost every system that is out there and available.

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000
But, good job for Capcom.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:59.000
And good job, yay for Mega Man, because this means Mega Man 12?

01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:00.000
Probably.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:01.000
Right?

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:02.000
I would think.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:08.000
Yeah, and it also means that, you know, other games that are Mega Man-like don't have to have sequels.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:15.000
Capcom also wanted to say Monster Hunter World was doing very well, and Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection was doing strongly.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:18.000
And the Onimusha remaster, off to a good start.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:22.000
Alright, Mega Man 12, who knows, maybe in the future.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:28.000
For now, let's travel around the world and check out what's happening this week as we check out some world release dates, starting in the U.S., Loki.

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:35.000
So we've got The Liar Princess and The Blind Prince on the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:40.000
Trials Rising on PC, Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:43.000
Of course, Crackdown 3 on PC and Xbox One.

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:48.000
Dreamworks, Dragons, Dawn of the New Riders on Nintendo Switch.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:53.000
Far Cry New Dawn on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Jump Force on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:02.000
And finally, Metro Exodus on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:07.000
But that's the one that you can only buy on PC in one place, right?

01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:11.000
Well, not, I mean, now you can only buy it.

01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:14.000
Alright, that was the whole thing we got into last week a little bit.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.000
Alright, anyway.

01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:19.000
Going over to Japan and checking out the releases over there on the PlayStation 4 this week.

01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:22.000
Catherine Full Body is out just in time for Valentine's Day.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:25.000
Also, Jump Force is out on the PlayStation 4 in Japan this week.

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:31.000
Nobunaga's Ambition, Tashi, apparently some power-up kit, regular limited edition.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:34.000
What the hell has that series become these days? I don't even know.

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:38.000
Anyway, it's still going on the PlayStation 4 and has a new one coming out this week.

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:41.000
There's also a full-body box version of Catherine.

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000
Your guess is as good as mine would that mean?

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:46.000
Some collector's edition coming out in Japan as well.

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:51.000
There's also price reduction on the game Omega Labyrinth Z.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000
They added a new Catherine to that Catherine game.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.000
Oh, really?

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
So now there's three Catharines.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
Oh, all the Catharines.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:03.000
And then quickly looking at Nintendo Switch, seeing if they have, they also have the Nobunaga Ambition game this week.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000
It's coming out in Japan.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:13.000
Kinero no Corda Octave comes out in regular, something called a Treasure Box and a Blessed Party Box.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000
Like, there's a lot of editions of this game.

01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:18.000
I'm trying to see if this is a series we have over here.

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:28.000
It looks like, it might be based off an anime or something because it looks like a group of, like, college or high school-aged kids that are all playing violin and trumpet and things like that.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:36.000
So it's, it's not exactly Eternal Sonata. Remember that game on 3C? That was an underrated RPG.

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:40.000
It's not exactly Eternal Sonata, but it's definitely rooted in music and it's...

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:41.000
It looks like a...

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000
It's got to be based off an anime. It's got to be.

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000
It looks like it's just a visual novel.

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Maybe.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:53.000
All right. Well, there it is. Some more releases for you guys and what's coming up in stores this week.

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:56.000
So now we're going to get to the mailbag.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
Nope. We're getting to the UK.

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, we've got to get to the UK releases.

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:03.000
Exactly. Let's not jump to the mailbag.

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
Sorry. Sorry, UK. You don't count.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000
No, I'm just forgetful. Sorry.

01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:16.000
So we've got Sid Meier's Civilization VI, Gathering Storm, out on PC.

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:21.000
Far Cry New Dawn on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One and PC.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:25.000
Jump Force on Xbox One and PlayStation 4.

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:29.000
Metro Exodus, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:36.000
And let's see, Legend of Heroes, Trials of Cold Steel on PlayStation 4.

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:41.000
And Crackdown 3 on Xbox One and PC.

01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:42.000
That's it.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:48.000
All right. Pixel Pacas, by the way, in our chat, clearing up a little bit on Kinetoro no Korda on this.

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
It is an Otome game.

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:53.000
A dating sim where a lady dates guys.

01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:54.000
Cool.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Representation, huh?

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:58.000
Got to have it. All right.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:01.000
Anyway, let's move on and go to the mailbag.

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:03.000
Every week you guys e-mail us.

01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:07.000
Participate at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and we read your e-mails here on the show.

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:10.000
So let's get to our first e-mail tonight from Robert M.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
who starts us off saying,

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:16.000
Interesting to hear about the Nintendo partnership with Line for Dr. Mario.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:20.000
I do know the service dropped the Skullgirls mobile app and Cookie Run,

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
which went on to other publishers.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
Disney Tsum Tsum is still with Line.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:27.000
Hopefully the game, if it's well designed and probably would be,

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:30.000
considerably outlasts Puzzle Fighter.

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:34.000
Or, I mean, honestly, Robert M., some of Nintendo's other games.

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
I mean, Miitomo didn't exactly last a long time.

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:40.000
So, yeah, hopefully Dr. Mario has the Steam to last a little while.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
So there it is. That was the e-mail from Robert M.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
So are we talking about like the new puzzle?

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
Didn't they do like a new Puzzle Fighter that was kind of crap?

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:51.000
Yeah, there was like a whole new Puzzle Fighter that came out on mobile and about as fast as it came out, it went away.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
They pulled it like really fast.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:57.000
Which, by the way, speaking of stuff they pulled, oh, my gosh, Alan, Alan, Alan,

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
are you dressed to be on the show?

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
Alan, come here, come here.

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
I'm sorry, guys, I'm making Alan make a cameo.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
Okay, hi, Alan.

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:06.000
Hello.

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
Sorry to make you pull you away from whatever else you're doing.

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:14.000
Come sit on the couch. Come sit on the edge of the couch.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
All right, here, hold this. There.

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
Perfect.

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:23.000
So let's talk about, I want to talk about like mobile games that go away too soon.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:28.000
So you've been playing this match three game. What happened?

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
Tell us what game and what's going on.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:35.000
It was a game that I actually started playing when it came out in Japan a whole year before it came out in the US.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:41.000
I had to get like a little app that lets you use the Google Play store, the Japanese one.

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
So I was very into this game.

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:46.000
Sailor Moon Drops posted on their Facebook.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
We're closing.

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:52.000
Okay, it's fun.

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:56.000
I like collecting all the weird characters like Alan, the boy from the arcade or whatever.

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:59.000
I don't understand it.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:02.000
And no reason given, just bye.

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:05.000
This isn't working out for us, so see you later.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:06.000
Yeah.

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
All right, go tend to Mr. Samos.

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
She's trying to get into something over there in the kitchen.

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:11.000
He's playing with his toy.

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:14.000
Thank you for letting us drag you on the show just like that.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:15.000
Appreciate it.

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:16.000
All right.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:20.000
Unfortunately, poor Litten took a nosedive there. That's all right.

01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:22.000
Bobby Black Wolf says, Alan just hipstered us.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
Alan's like, I played it before it was cool.

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:27.000
And DJ Rama S says, I'm still salty about that.

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:30.000
There's a petition going around to keep it alive.

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:33.000
And Pixel pockets is complimenting your t-shirt.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:34.000
Just so we're clear.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:35.000
All right.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
Anyway, moving on.

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:40.000
Let's get to our next email in the mailbag tonight.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
And again, if you want to email us some week,

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com.

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:47.000
Our last email tonight from Frodo Swagons.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Hey, OLR, Frodo Swagons here.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:56.000
If you are forced to choose only one game to play for the rest of your life,

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:59.000
life, life, life, what would that game be?

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:02.000
Could even be a game that has not come out yet.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
Yet another short and sweet email.

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:05.000
Haha, love the show as always.

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:06.000
Take care.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:07.000
Hey, we love the short emails.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
We'll read the long emails too.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
Although we may have to cut some things for time.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:12.000
But yeah, please email us.

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
Participate at OrangeLawnTrader.com.

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
Now on to the question.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
You get to play one game for the rest of your life.

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
What game is it going to be?

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:23.000
That's tough.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:27.000
I don't know.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
Maybe I would get bored with it.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:32.000
But we'll pick ZZT.

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Because you can make an infinite amount of games.

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
Make other games than the game.

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:40.000
Yes, actually I'm going to go for a similar answer.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:43.000
You might think that I would say an MMO, which is a good answer.

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:47.000
I could say WoW or Final Fantasy XIV, which I think are really good answers.

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:52.000
But yeah, I think this whole how do you trick this question and wish for more wishes

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:57.000
is to answer this with LittleBigPlanet would be the game that I would want to play.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:03.000
Because there's infinite amounts of games still out there within LittleBigPlanet to be discovered.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:09.000
Honestly, this whole Dreams thing, which I'm hearing more and more about.

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:12.000
And it sounds like people are recreating full-on other games in Dreams.

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:16.000
Did you see the Everything's Fine meme that they recreated in Dreams?

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:19.000
No, I didn't see that. No, that sounds funny.

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
But yeah, it sounds like Dreams.

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:26.000
So if you talk about I can use upcoming games, I bet that might be a good candidate

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:30.000
for an upcoming game that I would use to wish for more wishes.

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
Which is exactly what I'm doing with this answer.

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:35.000
Sorry. I mean, I can always say the Guardian Legend.

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
I mean, that's a really good pick, too.

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
But you get bored with it after a while.

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:43.000
Would I? I don't know. I don't know about that.

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:48.000
All right. Let's see. I'm looking at chat, some of the answers in our chat room.

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:51.000
OnlySonic says Roblox is kind of infinite.

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:54.000
You know, I know more and more people that are randomly playing that game.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:58.000
I should say randomly. It seems like it's really big and like a casual gaming space

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
and with younger people as well.

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:04.000
You know, like I mentioned, my son's doing that Code Ninjas program now.

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
Did that start officially?

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:11.000
Yeah, he's done his official. He's paying for it and he's going to it.

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:14.000
It's getting deducted from a bank account. You better be doing it.

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Eventually, though, he gets into, after like the second year into it,

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:24.000
they start doing Lua scripting for Roblox.

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:28.000
So they actually teach him how to make their own Roblox levels, which is pretty cool.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:33.000
But right now they're doing Scratch and then after that they're doing JavaScript.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:38.000
And the JavaScript part I thought was something to do with Minecraft, but it might not be.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:41.000
I don't really know what exactly they do with JavaScript.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:48.000
But I know that the Lua portion is with Roblox and actually creating levels for Roblox.

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
So that's something he wants to do.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:54.000
But yeah, that's all he plays is like Roblox games.

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
So, I mean, there's a lot out there.

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:59.000
I don't know how much of it's good, but there's a lot of things you can do with it.

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:03.000
I'm reading some of the other answers in chat about what game to play for the rest of your life.

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:07.000
Sia Tabiri says, could it be a compiled game like the US release of Popolo Christ,

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
which was three Japanese games?

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:14.000
That's a good idea, too. Can I play one of those like 101 games in one NES carts?

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:18.000
Although a lot of those games were shit. Let's be real.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:21.000
Super Mario All-Stars would be a good pick because that's really four games.

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:22.000
Mario Maker.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:25.000
Yes, there you go. Mario Maker is a good choice, too.

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:29.000
Alright, good enough. That's enough answers for now.

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:32.000
Let's move on and get into...

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:35.000
Now we can... I'm sorry, we did the emails.

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
So again, participate at orangelauntrader.com.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:40.000
It's the place where you can send us an email in the future and we hope you will.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:43.000
But in the meantime, let's get back into some stories.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
And Loki's going to get into the next story.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:50.000
So we talked about franchises that Activision's burned into the ground.

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
One of those being Guitar Hero.

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:58.000
And Guitar Hero Live now is actually refunding people for December.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:02.000
So Guitar Hero Live had this thing called Guitar Hero TV.

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:07.000
So instead of having like the normal DLC thing, you kind of had this subscription service that you paid for.

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:11.000
I think SingStar does something similar to that.

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:17.000
So you had this like streaming servicing to get the play along with the music and stuff that was in there.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:20.000
But apparently they announced, of course, that they're going to be seizing the service.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:25.000
But apparently not everybody has gotten the message.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:35.000
And so anybody that bought the game in December will actually be getting a refund for the game.

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:38.000
So you probably have to like send in a receipt or some other proof of purchase.

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:41.000
They'll be getting a refund for the Guitar Hero TV if you paid for that service.

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:42.000
Oh, I see. Okay.

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:46.000
So you still have this stuff that's on disc, but you have to do that.

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:51.000
So apparently. Oh, no, actually, maybe you do get a refund for the games.

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:55.000
Yes, as publishers announced the season, but the news got out.

01:48:55.000 --> 01:49:03.000
But for anybody that bought the game December this past year before Guitar Hero TV closed down on January 1st is entitled to refund for the game.

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:07.000
So it says you'll be left with the songs on the disc, but you get your money back.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:11.000
So they have a claim form that you can go to.

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:19.000
So support that Activision's article slash and us slash facts slash guitar dash hero dash live.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:22.000
I'm sure you're all right there right now.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:26.000
I'm sure you can do what Google for heaven's sakes.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:32.000
But you you have to show proof of purchase and then they will send you a gift card for your purchase price.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:36.000
As Joe and Matt says, I think this refund is just to avoid the class action lawsuit.

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:39.000
Probably. Mm hmm. Boy, they can't win on that one, huh?

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:43.000
But yeah, you guys got to think about that when it comes to games to have like a really big online presence.

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:47.000
When you pull that plug, there's going to be some people that are really ticked off about the very least.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:51.000
So with this guitar hero game, you're only losing a portion of the functionality of it.

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:54.000
There's still songs on this that you can play the same.

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:59.000
It can't be said for anthem when that goes down.

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:05.000
Or a number of Overwatch or who knows what else. All right, let's move on.

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:10.000
I want to talk about some tidbits from Final Fantasy 14 Fan Fest in Paris.

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:16.000
Some little tidbits about the game came out, including a crossover with Final Fantasy 15.

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:20.000
There is going to be a new mount that you will get in Final Fantasy 14.

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:24.000
It is the first four person mount in the game. Why?

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:29.000
Because they brought over the car. They brought over the regalia from Final Fantasy 15 as a mount in Final Fantasy 14.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:34.000
So you can actually get that as a mount. And that actually in 14, that'll be really useful in some areas.

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:41.000
I'm thinking of the area Eureka, which you can really lose XP if you run into mobs.

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:48.000
And if somebody can ferry a bunch of people over from one area to another to get XP easier, I think it'll actually work out really well.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
So anyway, yes, there is going to be a Final Fantasy 14.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:54.000
Are they going to have Ubers now in the game? People charging a little bit of gil for it?

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:59.000
Port please, cross please. Anyway, who knows? Anything's possible.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:04.000
Other stuff to come with that Final Fantasy 15 crossover, but also an interesting crossover.

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:08.000
They announced the next raid and who is designing it.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:14.000
And basically the next 24 man raid and the next expansion is a Nier influenced raid.

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:19.000
So the creators of Nier are making, just like in this latest expansion, Stormblood,

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:26.000
the creators of Final Fantasy Tactics and Ivalice and 12 influenced the raid there.

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
They have the creators of Nier.

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:32.000
So how does that work with influencing? Do they have characters that appear in Nier?

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:35.000
They may. We don't know. We don't know the details yet.

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:38.000
So, I mean, I think we got the name and I forget the exact name.

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:43.000
It had a very Nier sounding name to it. So yeah, going to be very interesting.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:51.000
There's that as well. They also officially confirmed the next class in the game.

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:54.000
I already forgot the name. Gunbreaker, I think was the name of it.

01:51:54.000 --> 01:52:00.000
It's basically, it's the gun blade thing, but it's a tank so they can do like little shield things.

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
And so, yeah, it looks really cool in motion.

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:07.000
And as Shane says in our chat room, or excuse me, Shad Leland says in our chat room,

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:12.000
Rob, talk about how excited you were when they showed off male Viera. Oh, wait, you can't.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:16.000
Yeah. So they officially announced that the Viera is going to be the next playable class

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:21.000
and only showed off female toons and female versions of the Viera.

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:25.000
There was no boy bunnies to be found, which is,

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:29.000
and don't you fucking pull that lore card on me because lore can be rewritten.

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:33.000
And remember in Final Fantasy 11, only female could be, what was it, Mithra in 11?

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:36.000
Mithra and Galkas were only male.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:41.000
Well, in the original original Final Fantasy 14 release, that was the same way.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:44.000
Only female could be Makoto, only male.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:48.000
But then when Yoshida came in and they did Realm Reborn, they said, no, that's stupid.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:53.000
And they did, they did male makote or whatever they're called in this game.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:57.000
And they did female Rogadins, which are Galka in 11, basically.

01:52:57.000 --> 01:53:02.000
So everybody's got the same gender. So why on earth they would now be like,

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:07.000
Viera is only going to be female is going to like really irritate me.

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
Because, yes, I wanted to be a bunny boy.

01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:14.000
Now, they could just be waiting for Tokyo, like honest to God, it could just not be done yet.

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:18.000
As it sounds like there's a lot of things for the next expansion that just straight up aren't done.

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
And they're doing it by the seat of their pants.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:24.000
So maybe they're going to wait and show them off in Tokyo, at least I hope that's the idea.

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:29.000
Because I have heard rumblings that they may, that the male Viera will actually be,

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:34.000
and this is rumor, that the male Viera will actually be the Ronso from Final Fantasy 10.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:37.000
Do you remember Kilmari, the Blue Panther looking guy?

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:44.000
Oh, yeah. So that instead of Viera, you'll play the male character will be only Ronso's.

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
But I seem to remember there were female Ronso's.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:51.000
So I don't know. I hope that's not true. I want a boy bunny.

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:58.000
Act F says female Viera is probably more appealing to you.

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:05.000
Just because they're boy bunnies doesn't mean they have to be scantily clad.

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:14.000
But let us not forget Final Fantasy 14 and on back to 11 is kind of infamous for its equal opportunity hoe armor.

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:21.000
Is that if you want to be a female and dress like a hoe, you have that opportunity just like you do in every other MMO.

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:22.000
But guess what?

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:23.000
Oh, is it the sublegar?

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:29.000
Yeah, if you want to be a male and dress like a hoe, just ask Shane to share screenshots of his characters because they're all hoes.

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:34.000
You can do that in Final Fantasy 14. You can absolutely do it.

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:39.000
Anyhow, did the sublegars make it over to 14 as well?

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:44.000
They have a version of it. Yeah, but they also have like they did like bathing suits at one point.

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:47.000
And they're just based like they're somehow smaller than Speedos.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:52.000
Like it's it's like you're just you're running around and like not even like tighty whities, but like a thong or something.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:55.000
It's pretty it's pretty not a lot.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
The armor, of course, they all look like Ken dolls.

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:02.000
Are the armor buffs good on that kind of stuff or is it just like.

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
Well, here's the thing, because glamour, you're off.

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:08.000
You're asking a lot of questions, Logie, because glamour is a thing.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:16.000
You can have like iron boots of plus 40 or whatever, and you glamour them into thong.

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
And that's fine. You get the stats of your iron thing.

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:19.000
Iron thong.

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:22.000
But it looks like an iron thong.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:25.000
All right. Anyway, that's a little bit on.

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
Oh, actually, there's one other thing on 14 I wanted to say.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
It's actually not specifically 14.

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:36.000
But again, a question that was asked to Naoki Yoshida at the Fan Fest that now people are kind of running with,

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:40.000
even though it's not directly about 14, because, you know, Yoshida,

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:46.000
I imagine he's a pretty popular guy within Square Enix because he did take this game that was a disaster

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:50.000
and has reinvented it into something that's very much playable in his success.

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:56.000
So there has been a lot of rumors that Yoshida may be tasked with the next Final Fantasy game.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:59.000
And that's a big maybe, and I don't know. I don't know if that's true or not.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:04.000
I would think what he's doing on Final Fantasy 14 is enough of an undertaking because he's director and producer.

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:10.000
But anyhow, he got asked about Final Fantasy 16.

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
So obviously they had to ask in a very roundabout way.

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:16.000
Well, first they asked him, is Nobui Matsu going to do the theme for Shadowbringers?

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:19.000
And he said, I don't have any info on that yet. I'm paraphrasing.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:22.000
He didn't say, I'm not trying to be, but, you know, his health.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:25.000
You remember Nobui Matsu took a break because of his health.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
We reported on that some time ago.

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:32.000
And so basically Yoshida is saying, we just don't know if he's at a point where he can do that.

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:35.000
And he's also in demand for the Final Fantasy 7 remake.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:39.000
So it's really one of those things of, if he can do it, great.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
But if not, it may not happen.

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:45.000
And please respect that his health has been an issue for some time.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:50.000
But then the other question he got asked about, for the future of online and Final Fantasy,

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:56.000
as a director, what kind of elements do you think Final Fantasy 16 and Final Fantasy 17 should offer?

01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:00.000
And Naoki Yoshida was kind of blindsided by the question and then said,

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:04.000
first, if you're asking whether the Final Fantasy series will get another MMO soon,

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:08.000
I think the chances are unlikely so long as Final Fantasy 14 is doing well.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:14.000
On that note, personally speaking, I'd like to see a Final Fantasy that is straightforward fantasy.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:18.000
One that doesn't have much machinery and with no mecha in it.

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:22.000
After all, we're having trouble with the Garlean Empire being too powerful.

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:23.000
That's a joke about 14.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
Okay, that was a bad joke and he laughed.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:28.000
But a lot of people are kind of looking at what he said and going,

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:32.000
let him make it because that's what I want too.

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:35.000
I would like to see a Final Fantasy, me personally speaking.

01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:38.000
I mean, the mech stuff that they've done has been fine.

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:45.000
I like a small mix. I like what they did with like 7 and 6.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
6 is a good example.

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:52.000
Well, aesthetic-wise, I really liked what they did with 9.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:55.000
It was the classic Final Fantasy but a little bit of that new stuff.

01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:58.000
And I've said this before on the show, I know I have, I'll say it again.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:04.000
My dream Final Fantasy 16 would just be like, take something in 15's engine.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:07.000
Honestly, so you don't have to take 20 years to make it.

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:10.000
Take 15's engine, obviously tweak it a little bit,

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:13.000
maybe make the battles a little more traditional or whatever, whatever they're going to do.

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:18.000
And just use that type of graphical power with a game in the setting that's more like 9.

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:24.000
Traditional Final Fantasy, a fantasy type setting without all the steampunk and the mech and all that stuff.

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:27.000
Which, fine, there's a time and a place for that but they've had plenty of Final Fantasy games.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:32.000
I would eat that up. Wouldn't you love to see like a Final Fantasy 15 graphical power

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
but like an old school Final Fantasy game?

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:37.000
Which, ironically, I pretty much just said what the 7 remake is.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:40.000
But the 7 remake was all the mech stuff.

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
But I like some of the mech stuff.

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:48.000
I just like a little bit less of it, you know, like 6 was fine.

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:54.000
Dr. Seeya in chat says, shouldn't they finish 7 remake first or rather Final Fantasy 7 remakes first chapter first?

01:58:54.000 --> 01:59:01.000
Yes, I guess, and as some people have said before, Final Fantasy 7 remake is Final Fantasy 16.

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:06.000
It's not going to be called that, but the effort they're putting into it,

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:09.000
the time they're developing to make it, the way they're going to sell it when it comes out,

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:14.000
is going to be on par with what a Final Fantasy 16 would get.

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:18.000
And I think once that's finally out, then we'll finally hear about Final Fantasy 16.

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
We'll see.

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:24.000
Okay, now we'll move on. Sorry, I had a lot to say about Fan Fest and Tangenty things.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:28.000
But let's move on to some updates on other Square Enix things.

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:34.000
Yes, so as you may remember, Kingdom Hearts 3 just recently came out and it's done pretty well.

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:42.000
The Kingdom Hearts Twitter account posted that over 5 million copies of Kingdom Hearts 3 have been shipped worldwide.

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:45.000
So that's a lot of copies potentially sold.

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:50.000
That's shipped, not sold. They like to fudge numbers that way, but you know, they're out there.

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
They're going to be sold eventually.

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:55.000
I mean, they sold them to retail outlets.

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:59.000
So technically they've already made their money, you know, so it's fine.

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:02.000
So yeah, doing pretty good.

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:05.000
Yeah, that's really not a bad number considering how long that's been out.

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:10.000
And considering it didn't launch during the holiday season, that game will probably continue to deliver.

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:15.000
And I bet they cut the price of that game just in time for the holidays down to like 30, 40 bucks.

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:19.000
And they'll sell a lot more entering the holiday period later this year.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:24.000
And who knows if they really do that Switch version that's always rumored or not. I don't know.

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
You haven't really gotten into Kingdom Hearts 3, huh, Loki?

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:27.000
I haven't played it yet.

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
Is it something you bought?

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
I already bought it, yeah. I just haven't played it yet.

02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:36.000
I was, um, what was I doing the other day? I was doing something on the PlayStation.

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
I was like, oh yeah, I have to play Kingdom Hearts.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:44.000
Oh, I was looking, there was, um, I saw a posting online saying that Earth Defense Force 5 was on sale.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:47.000
Um, but it was only on sale for 20% off here.

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
And I was like, that's a $60 game.

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:56.000
Like, I remember when Earth Defense Force 2017 was like a $20 or $30 game brand new.

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:59.000
And now they want 60 bucks for that shit?

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:02.000
And let's be honest, I mean, it hasn't gotten that much better.

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:08.000
It's just, it was a simple series, dude. It was like $20 games. Come on.

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
Alright, moving on to our next story.

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:15.000
And by the way, we're just a little ways away from taking calls.

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:19.000
So, if you would like to call into OLR and talk about something we have talked about,

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:23.000
or maybe something we haven't addressed yet, you're going to head on over to our VoG Network Discord channel.

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:28.000
Go to vognetwork.com slash Discord, and I think that's linked below on our Twitch page.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:32.000
And you can join our Discord server, and you're going to want to wait in the Green Room channel.

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:36.000
And tell us a little bit about, in the Orange Dance Radio channel, what you want to talk about tonight.

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
And we will get to calls in a little bit.

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
But for now, let's talk about this rumor.

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:44.000
So, Shane really wanted me to talk about this for some reason.

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
It's still a rumor, so I don't know.

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:47.000
Yeah.

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:51.000
But anyway, apparently there's a Nintendo Direct that's coming next week.

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:54.000
And it's going to have news on the Metroid Prime trilogy for Switch,

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
which we've already heard rumors about,

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:59.000
which would make a lot of sense considering Metroid Prime 4.

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:00.000
We all know what happened there.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
A couple weeks ago, they had to say,

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:05.000
we are starting over, basically, with that whole thing, right?

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:10.000
So, a Metroid Prime trilogy kind of holdover makes a lot of sense, right?

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:13.000
But then the other big thing, and I don't know where this rumor's coming from,

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
but Super Mario Maker 2 is also...

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
It's coming from Fanwink, is where it's coming from.

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:18.000
It's coming from Fan...

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:21.000
Well, it's, I guess it is reset era forums,

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
which, that's what happened to NeoGaf, right?

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
It became reset, or all the people...

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:26.000
No, NeoGaf is NeoGaf.

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:27.000
It's so complicated.

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:28.000
Y'all are dramatic.

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:32.000
Anyway, so there's a user over there, King Zell,

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
who I guess has been reliable before.

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:37.000
So it's one of those, well, he was right before, so he's probably right now.

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:40.000
So he's talking about the Metroid Prime trilogy,

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
or I should say they, because we don't know their gender,

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:45.000
a Metroid Prime trilogy on Switch.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:48.000
And then also brought out news about the Super Mario Maker 2.

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:54.000
I mean, we keep saying Mario Maker on Switch win,

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:59.000
and it would make a lot of sense that Nintendo may take an approach

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:02.000
that's worked very well for them with Smash Brothers,

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:06.000
where it's like, it's not a remaster for Switch.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:10.000
I mean, we kind of did use a lot of the stuff we had on Wii U,

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:15.000
but we did a real deep dive into this and rebalanced and redid things.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:20.000
We really went into this and made a new game out of it.

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:24.000
And to be fair, I think Splatoon 2 is in a very similar type of boat.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
I mean, we kind of took what worked with the first game

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:29.000
and kind of added more to it and made Splatoon 2.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:34.000
So, I mean, a Mario Maker 2 in that regard, it does make a lot of sense, right, Loki?

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
Would you be all about a Mario Maker 2?

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:40.000
What do you think would justify a 2 in Mario Maker 2?

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
Because I have an idea.

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:45.000
They would just have to...

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
It would just be more game types, I think.

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:53.000
So you'd have stuff from Super Mario Brothers 2 in there.

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:56.000
I don't think so. But go ahead.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:01.000
I would like to see other games, like a Nintendo Maker almost,

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:06.000
instead of just Mario Maker, like Metroid, Zelda.

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:12.000
I like that. So other types of games, not just necessarily Mario platformers.

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:16.000
Super Mario Maker, but they use that brand and that name people know,

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
but they expand it in other types of games.

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:22.000
That's a very lofty goal, but I like that idea.

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
I would think maybe one thing they'd put into it

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:27.000
is that it's going to have more of a focus on competitive.

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:31.000
That you would be able to play a level at the same time with your friend,

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:37.000
Nintendo Online, and I'm saying they've got to try to make that more appealing somehow,

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:41.000
and that you would race with friends online, and they would be like little shadows.

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:45.000
I swear there was a Game Boy version of the game that did this exact thing,

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
where you would use the link cable.

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:50.000
I think it was the remake of one. Maybe chat knows what I'm talking about.

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:54.000
But you'd use the link cable, and you'd see the shadow of the other person playing while you're playing,

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
and you didn't collide or run into each other or anything,

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:59.000
but it's like you were doing competitive speed runs.

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
And I can see that being a thing in a sequel.

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
And why limit it to two people?

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:06.000
Maybe you could have four people all playing at once,

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:11.000
and we know that part of the fun of Mario is all the different costume Marios with the amiibo,

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:14.000
so maybe everybody could be a different Mario sprite.

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:17.000
I don't know. It could be interesting.

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says,

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
Total fan wank from Loki.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
Mario Maker Battle Royale.

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:26.000
I like that.

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:27.000
Darktitsia says,

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:30.000
Yeah, Super Mario Deluxe had you race against a boo.

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:33.000
Yeah, okay. I thought that was a thing. I remember that.

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:36.000
Let's see. Also, Darktitsia says,

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:39.000
Well, Splatoon 2 did have a lot of the old maps revived.

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
And Shane is pointing out,

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:44.000
The Mario Maker 2 rumor isn't for this Direct.

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:47.000
I only wanted you to talk about it because everybody loves Directs.

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:50.000
It'll mean more when we get a confirmation on it.

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
I mean, that would be cool if it is true.

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:55.000
I guess other things that are rumored they could talk about

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:58.000
is that we had that Super Nintendo data mine file

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
in the Nintendo Online thing,

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:03.000
so this might be a great time to tell us what that means

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:06.000
and maybe outline some of the other Switch Online titles

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:09.000
for the rest of the year, if not up to the summer in E3.

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:10.000
So we'll see.

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:14.000
Do you think it's plausible

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
that there could be a Nintendo Direct this week?

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:17.000
I guess.

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:20.000
It's just as plausible as there could be one another week.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
So we'll see.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:23.000
Bobby Blackwell says,

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000
I'd rather just wait for the Direct to happen

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
before spending time talking about it.

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
Well, isn't it great that you have your own show

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
where you can pick and choose what you want to talk about?

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
But sometimes, especially at the end of the show,

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
sometimes rumors are fun to get into

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
because, and here's my perspective on it,

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:41.000
if some of these rumors gain so much traction,

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
and these Nintendo Direct ones especially,

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:47.000
because on Twitter, people will take the ball and run with it

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
with these Direct things.

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
And sometimes, I just want to say,

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
y'all, stop putting the cart before the horse.

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:56.000
Just because you read the tea leaves one way in 2017

02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000
doesn't mean you'll be able to read it the same way in 2019,

02:06:58.000 --> 02:06:59.000
and so forth.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:02.000
So sometimes I want to bring up rumors just to squash them.

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:06.000
But I mean, sure, it's been a hot minute

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
since we've had a Nintendo Direct.

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:11.000
And I think a Metroid Prime trilogy,

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
I mean, heck, we kind of already guessed

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:16.000
that that might be a bridge when this happened with 4.

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:20.000
As far as Mario Maker 2 coming out of a random Direct in February,

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:21.000
I doubt it.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
But I think maybe outlining,

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:26.000
especially since we know that Nintendo has more pressure on Switch Online,

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:29.000
I think outlining maybe what the calendar looks like a little further out,

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:30.000
that makes sense.

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
Spotlighting more indie stuff,

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
because there's a ton of it on the marketplace,

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
makes a lot of sense as well.

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
So, anyway.

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:42.000
Moving on.

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:45.000
Let's go to a couple more stories.

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:48.000
Loki, what about one of your favorite series, right?

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
Yes, Grand Theft Auto Online.

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:53.000
So, of course, one thing with Grand Theft Auto and Grand Theft Auto Online

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
is there's been a lot of cheating.

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:59.000
And so, of course, Rockstar Games has been trying to crack down on that.

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:04.000
So, apparently, there is a guy by the name of Johnny Perez,

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:09.000
who was a creator of an online cheat program called Illusive.

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:13.000
And he's been found guilty by default from the District Court.

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:14.000
Guilty by default!

02:08:14.000 --> 02:08:16.000
District Court of New York.

02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:18.000
Because, you know, that means he didn't show up the court.

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:19.000
Uh-oh.

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:24.000
So, apparently, what the program Illusive did

02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:29.000
is it allowed you to basically generate unlimited currency in the game.

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:30.000
Because everything in the game is expensive,

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:32.000
because they want you to grind for it,

02:08:32.000 --> 02:08:37.000
or buy those shark cards and spend real-world money on the game.

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
And that's how they make a ton of extra money on it.

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:45.000
So, of course, Take-Two had contacted this Johnny Perez,

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
apparently last year,

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:50.000
and ordered him to cease the sale of Illusive

02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:53.000
and the distribution of the software,

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:56.000
because he was selling it to people to actually use.

02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:00.000
And he apparently complied with the request,

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:05.000
but also, when they tried to contact him again,

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
he basically just didn't respond to them.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:11.000
So, with that, of course, they went to court,

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:14.000
and then damages were awarded to Take-Two,

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:17.000
so they've been awarded $150,000 in damages,

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:23.000
and also he is supposed to pay $70,000 in legal fees.

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:28.000
So that's a lot of money for cheating in an online game.

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:31.000
So the chatroom on Twitch is giving me shit,

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:35.000
because if you look at the storyboard, look what happened.

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:38.000
I was typing so fast.

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:43.000
It says, Grant that photo online, cheat tray.

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
And so now they're making French jokes in the chat,

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:48.000
because apparently I typed too fast,

02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:49.000
and I got my E in my arm.

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
And for those listening on the podcast,

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:52.000
the little thing says,

02:09:52.000 --> 02:09:53.000
Grant that photo is supposed to say,

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
Cheater owes money, but because I typed so fast.

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:59.000
Because you all have never made a typo in your entire life.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
I textily put cheat tray.

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
Whatever. You know what?

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:07.000
Fine. I'll scroll it off the screen, then we'll get to the next story.

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
And no, I didn't make up that.

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
That's the actual name of a game.

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:12.000
Nino Cooney.

02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:13.000
Nino Cooney.

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
Bobby Blackwell's favorite game.

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:16.000
Oh, man.

02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:18.000
That was like his game of the year, the year that came out.

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:19.000
Nino Cooney.

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:20.000
Did he even play it?

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:21.000
Because I don't think he passed the demo.

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
No, because he couldn't get past the demo.

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:24.000
And to be fair, it did have a shit demo.

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:26.000
But anyway, the game itself, I liked.

02:10:26.000 --> 02:10:30.000
So you're going to go see the movie and get past the trailer?

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000
You're not going to let me read the fucking story

02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000
before you start making jokes looking.

02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:35.000
No, I'm not.

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:40.000
But yes, Nino Cooney, they are going to be making a movie about it.

02:10:40.000 --> 02:10:43.000
Warner Brothers Japan is teaming up with Level 5,

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
who made the Nino Cooney games.

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
They're going to be doing an anime film adaptation,

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:51.000
so it's not a live action film, but it's going to be anime based.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:54.000
The character designs, of course, by Yoshiuki Momose

02:10:54.000 --> 02:10:56.000
and the score by Joe Hisahashi.

02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:59.000
It's going to be a summer 2019 release, apparently,

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:00.000
so that's going to be pretty soon.

02:11:00.000 --> 02:11:02.000
Level 5 did a press conference recently

02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:04.000
where they announced that their CEO would be working

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:08.000
as executive producer and script writer for this film.

02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:11.000
Of course, you should know this series

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:14.000
because Studio Ghibli had a huge influence on this series.

02:11:14.000 --> 02:11:15.000
It was actually a partnership with them.

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
And that's what made this game very interesting to some people.

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
And again, I liked the game.

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
I mean, it had its faults.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
And then the sequel was pretty decent, too.

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:26.000
Again, they all had their faults, but it was a good RPG

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.000
and I think people really enjoyed it.

02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:32.000
So, needless to say, I really enjoy Studio Ghibli's work.

02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:35.000
So, as far as, like, here's the ironic thing,

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:39.000
because a lot of video game movie adaptations become trash,

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:43.000
this has the formula to be a pretty good one, Bobby,

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:48.000
because Studio Ghibli kind of, like, they don't really make bad films.

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:49.000
You know what I mean?

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
I'm sure somebody is in the chat going,

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:52.000
but what about that?

02:11:52.000 --> 02:11:53.000
Okay, maybe one or two.

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
But, like, for the most part, they make really good movies.

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
So, I'd be curious. I'd be into it.

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:58.000
Why not?

02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:01.000
Of course, I wonder if we're going to get a release of it here in the US.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
Probably not, but you never know.

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:04.000
Yeah.

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:07.000
Sometimes. Some of the Miyazaki movies have come over.

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:08.000
Yeah.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:09.000
If it was possible.

02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.000
So, all right.

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:17.000
We're going to get into the part of the show where we take calls on our Discord.

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:21.000
vognetwork.com slash Discord, if you want to get into our Discord.

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
And you just got to join that Green Room channel

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:28.000
and we'll be pulling you into our room to talk about stuff on air with us.

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:30.000
If we have enough time, we'll try to get to everybody.

02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:32.000
I wanted to ask, Loki, though, last minute stories.

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
Anything else we didn't quite get around to talking about tonight?

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:35.000
Yes.

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:42.000
There is a Sony Interactive Air Team patent regarding a new motion controller for,

02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:45.000
I'm assuming, the PlayStation VR.

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:49.000
Apparently, the patent, they filed that originally in 2017,

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:53.000
but it was published just a couple of days ago.

02:12:53.000 --> 02:13:02.000
And it looks like, almost like the, I don't know, an upgraded move controller.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:04.000
Block ears.

02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:05.000
Fuck, though.

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:06.000
That's why I got to say.

02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:12.000
It looks like it has an L2R2 button that can be depressed on the back of it.

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:17.000
And they have a thumb stick there and some more face buttons.

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:18.000
Cool.

02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:19.000
Interesting.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:22.000
Anything's better than what we have now with that thing.

02:13:22.000 --> 02:13:24.000
Although, this doesn't necessarily look like the move controller

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:27.000
with the fact that it doesn't have the giant, you know, ice cream ball at the end.

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:33.000
But it's, I forget the second one that they had, not the move controller,

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:37.000
but there was the nav controller, I think it was called.

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:40.000
Well, they also probably don't need the giant, like, on the PlayStation 3,

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:43.000
it was probably one thing because the camera was one resolution.

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
But if you think about it, the PlayStation 4 camera can pick up

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
the much smaller lights on the back of your controllers.

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:50.000
And know where you're at with those lights.

02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:54.000
So, there could still be a light that's just a lot smaller.

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:55.000
Probably, yeah.

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:56.000
Who knows?

02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:57.000
I don't know.

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:58.000
It looks neat, I guess.

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:01.000
But I just need something better than what they have.

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:07.000
Alright, so we have one caller waiting to go in our green room.

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:08.000
Let's get to it.

02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:11.000
And then I'll come back and see if you have any other stories you want to talk about tonight.

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
But, hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:14.000
Who's this?

02:14:14.000 --> 02:14:15.000
Hey, it's Metal Man here.

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:16.000
How are you?

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:17.000
Good, how are you, buddy?

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000
Pretty good.

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:23.000
I was going to ask three interrelated questions,

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:29.000
but I'll narrow it down to one for time reasons.

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:30.000
That's probably best.

02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:31.000
What's on your mind?

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:38.000
Now, you know how I think I was last week,

02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:44.000
I had given the quick anecdote about going to show up at this pizza place

02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:46.000
as a kid and loving it.

02:14:46.000 --> 02:14:47.000
Yeah.

02:14:47.000 --> 02:15:00.000
As a result of that place, I will forever associate food with me, specifically pizza.

02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:10.000
Do you mean like all pizza or like shitty cardboard gross disgusting pizza,

02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:13.000
which is what they served at places like Chuck E. Cheese, if you remember.

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:14.000
But who gives a fuck?

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:15.000
It's pizza.

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:19.000
Yeah, well, I don't remember how good or bad the pizza was.

02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:22.000
The only thing I remember is they sold pizza there.

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:25.000
As a kid, there is no bad pizza.

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:28.000
You would eat those pizzas that they'd make at your school, which were disgusting.

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:29.000
Anyway, sorry.

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:31.000
I don't mean to derail you, Metal Man.

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:32.000
What's your question?

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:39.000
Yeah, well, also bear in mind, we're talking about close to 35-year-old memories.

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:42.000
But anyway, that's besides the point.

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:54.000
Now, going with that theme, do you associate any specific foods with video games and why?

02:15:54.000 --> 02:16:00.000
Our two favorite topics, yet this question has never come up, food and video games.

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:04.000
Our two very favorite topics mashed into the blender.

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:05.000
Will it blend into one question?

02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:09.000
Is there a food that you associate with a video game?

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:17.000
Well, I mean, I guess there's, I would say Parmesan.

02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:20.000
Not Parmesan, like the cheese sticks.

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
Fucker stole my answer.

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:23.000
And Dance Dance Revolution.

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:24.000
Stole my answer.

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:25.000
Sorry.

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:26.000
No, it's fine.

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
It's just funny that we're on the same wavelength like that.

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:29.000
Yeah, absolutely.

02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:35.000
Mozzarella sticks for Brookfields and Dance Dance Revolution because, well, for one, those

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:37.000
were some good mozzarella sticks.

02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:38.000
They don't pay me to endorse.

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:41.000
They're a local chain anyway, so you have to be here.

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:42.000
But, and I don't even know.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:45.000
They could have changed the recipe in the last 10 years.

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:46.000
I wouldn't know.

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:47.000
I haven't ordered those in years.

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:52.000
But remember how Orange Lawns Radio started is that we used to meet up at Golf Land and

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:57.000
we would play DDR and Alpine Racer 2, as you heard earlier in the show, Soul Calibur 2

02:16:57.000 --> 02:16:59.000
and other stuff they had at the arcade.

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:03.000
And then when we were done, we'd go to the diner that was like across the parking lot

02:17:03.000 --> 02:17:08.000
and just kind of sit at a giant table and talk about games and the games that we loved,

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:11.000
which included music games, but other types of games too.

02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:18.000
And I think we had that response because I was younger then, earlier in my twenties,

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:19.000
as were you.

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:23.000
And so it was like mozzarella sticks because we don't get fat at this age.

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:26.000
Well, also we were like playing DDR for like five hours a day.

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:32.000
So it's like, you know, that did contribute a lot to it.

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:38.000
Yeah, that and then that seemed to me like McDonald's and Call of Duty and Grand Theft Auto

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
because we used to get McDonald's.

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:41.000
Because both are basic.

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:45.000
And play on, you know, play our games during lunch and stuff.

02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:48.000
But, you know, that's about it.

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
Bobby Blackwell says, you'll love this.

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:55.000
I associate Cheesic grooves with Final Fantasy 14 because that's what I was eating a lot of times

02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:58.000
when I was playing Final Fantasy 14 with you guys.

02:17:58.000 --> 02:17:59.000
That's cute.

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:00.000
I like that answer too.

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:01.000
Yeah, like a snack food.

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:02.000
I don't know.

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:03.000
There's so many.

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:04.000
I'm trying to think.

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
I don't think there's a snack food I only ate for a limited time.

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:09.000
It's like I could sit here and go sour cream and onion pringles.

02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:14.000
I associate with literally anything because those are like really fucking good chips.

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:19.000
So that's like I eat a lot of those when I play video games.

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:21.000
Roast beef and Orion 78.

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:23.000
Oh, now you're getting into.

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:26.000
These are jokes that people are not going to understand in 2019.

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:29.000
A very, very small subset of gamers will get those jokes.

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:30.000
But yes.

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:31.000
Anyway.

02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:36.000
Well, was there anything for you, Metal Mayhem, besides the pizza?

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:39.000
No, that's pretty much it.

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:40.000
No.

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:46.000
Well, here in Buffalo, we also associate wings with pizza.

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:57.000
So by virtue of the connection, well, pizza being the intermediary, I also associate wings

02:18:57.000 --> 02:19:00.000
with video games in general.

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:01.000
So but fair enough.

02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:04.000
You know, another thing I would associate, actually, now I think about it, I would associate

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:11.000
with DDR in the arcade as I would associate Slurpees because they sold Slurpees there.

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:12.000
Or was it Icee?

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:13.000
Icee.

02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:14.000
Icee.

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:15.000
Whatever.

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:16.000
The same thing.

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:17.000
Icees are just awesome.

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:18.000
So I associate Icee's with that.

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:21.000
That hideous snack bar nacho flavor.

02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:22.000
And in the later years, remember this?

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
They put a full on Subway in there.

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:25.000
Yeah.

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:27.000
Some other sandwich.

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:28.000
Oh, it's not even Subway anymore.

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:29.000
It's not Subway anymore.

02:19:29.000 --> 02:19:30.000
It's like interesting.

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:31.000
Something else.

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:32.000
You know, this is going to sound complete.

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:33.000
Is it Port-A-Subs?

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:34.000
Because we finally got one in the sack area.

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:35.000
No, it's not Port-A-Subs.

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:36.000
It's like their own thing.

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:37.000
Did you know there's one in the sack now?

02:19:37.000 --> 02:19:38.000
What's a Port-A-Sub?

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:39.000
It's a sub.

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:40.000
I should.

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:41.000
I'm giving free advertising.

02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:42.000
It's a Subway.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:45.000
It's a sub sandwich chain that used to be here that I really liked as a kid growing

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:46.000
up.

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:47.000
And then it like went away.

02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:48.000
And it's only been in Nevada.

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:49.000
It's been up in Reno.

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:50.000
But they finally built another one here.

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
Oh, they have like now I've been seeing.

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:54.000
They replaced a Subway.

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:59.000
That's why they have like Jersey Mike's and they have a sourdough and company.

02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:01.000
The firehouse is really growing, too.

02:20:01.000 --> 02:20:03.000
That used to be the type of thing I could only get at Dragon Con.

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:04.000
And now they're everywhere.

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:05.000
Yeah.

02:20:05.000 --> 02:20:06.000
Firehouse.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:07.000
Yeah.

02:20:07.000 --> 02:20:08.000
We've got one of those nearby.

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:09.000
Well, I've brought that to the show a few times.

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:10.000
It's a little too much, though.

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:11.000
It's like too heavy.

02:20:11.000 --> 02:20:13.000
If you if you want to if you want you're trying to go on the subway diet.

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:18.000
That's a little bit more than, you know, feasible than the firehouse subs diet where you get

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:23.000
like a giant thing of like pulled pork on your sandwich or something like that.

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:24.000
All right.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:25.000
Congratulations.

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:26.000
You got a food tangent on our good job.

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:27.000
All right.

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:28.000
Thank you.

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:29.000
Metal mayhem for the call.

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:30.000
Appreciate it.

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:31.000
Take care.

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:32.000
OK.

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:33.000
All right.

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:34.000
Have a good one.

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:35.000
You too.

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:36.000
All right.

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:37.000
There's nobody else in our green room right now.

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:38.000
So if you do want to call into the show, you can over at Vogue Network dot com slash discord

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:39.000
in the green room.

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:43.000
Quest Buster is in our chat room saying Dragon's Lair and spaghetti.

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:48.000
Another arcade near us had an old cabinet of Dragon's Lair, and next door was a pasta

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:49.000
place.

02:20:49.000 --> 02:20:52.000
Well, there's a lot of like pizza and arcade games, I mean, because like we associate those

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:57.000
roundtable garlic sticks with Orange Lounge Radio because you bring them here all the

02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:58.000
time.

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:03.000
Well, like even like roundtable, like arcade games, like we used to go to arcades all the

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:04.000
time that were pizza places.

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:08.000
And so like there was Rico's Pizza with their two foot long party pizzas.

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:12.000
And that's per slice, too, by the way.

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:19.000
And then like, well, roundtable used to go to roundtable and Chuck E. Cheese, you know,

02:21:19.000 --> 02:21:21.000
all of those had pizza.

02:21:21.000 --> 02:21:27.000
So pizza and arcade games, frozen yogurt and Ms. Pac-Man, because there used to be a yogurt

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:30.000
place that my mom would take me to because it was right next door to Mervyn's, her favorite

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:31.000
store.

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:32.000
So I'm dating this whole thing.

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:36.000
But there was a little yogurt place next to Mervyn's.

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:41.000
And they were the only place that I saw that had a cocktail cabinet with Ms. Ms. Pac-Man

02:21:41.000 --> 02:21:43.000
actually was in the cocktail cabinet.

02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:46.000
So I associate Ms. Pac-Man with frozen yogurt.

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:50.000
Because that would be the time I could play the cocktail, which is cocktail cabinets are

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:51.000
awesome.

02:21:51.000 --> 02:21:54.000
Like, I don't know if you know, I think they're kind of a relic of the 80s.

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:57.000
I don't think you really see them anymore, but it used to be like basically like a stand

02:21:57.000 --> 02:22:01.000
up arcade table, but but in a table, they're really awesome.

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:02.000
So I kind of miss those.

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:05.000
So anyway.

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:06.000
All right.

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:07.000
Let's see.

02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:11.000
Oh, seeing active says, holy fuck Mervyn's.

02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:12.000
That's a name I haven't heard in a while.

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:13.000
Yeah, I know.

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:17.000
I know they went under many years ago, but that that was like the place to go shopping

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:19.000
if you were my mother growing up.

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000
So anyhow, any other last minute stories?

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:22.000
Because we really have.

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:23.000
Oh, I think somebody else just joined the green room.

02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:26.000
But I'll take one more story if you got a last minute story.

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:27.000
Let's see.

02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:29.000
I'll have to dig something up real quick here.

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:39.000
How about there was a German techno DJ who's releasing an album on Sega Mega Drive cart.

02:22:39.000 --> 02:22:40.000
I heard about this.

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:41.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.000
Remute, it looks like.

02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:46.000
So, yeah, DJ Remute from Hamburg.

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:52.000
He's releasing his techno optimistic LP on an actual cartridge that will play in actual

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:53.000
Mega Drive.

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.000
So that's pretty cool.

02:22:55.000 --> 02:23:01.000
It's a custom built flash chip with four megabytes only, and this contains a custom

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:07.000
music player programmed, they said, by some coders from the demo scene.

02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:08.000
Neat.

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:09.000
That's an inventive way to release your album.

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:10.000
That's for sure.

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:11.000
I like that.

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:12.000
That's pretty cool.

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:13.000
All right.

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:15.000
We'll take one more call here and then I'll probably be it because I don't see anybody

02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:16.000
else in the green room.

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:17.000
But hello.

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:18.000
You're on orange on radio.

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:19.000
Who's this?

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:20.000
Hey, so we're only wrong.

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
How is everybody doing tonight?

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:23.000
Fantastic.

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:24.000
It's great to hear from you.

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:25.000
What's on your mind tonight, buddy?

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:28.000
I have a bit of a gaming dilemma.

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:35.000
I haven't yet posted this to get outside suggestions, but I want to run this by you in low key and

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:37.000
see what should be the best thing I should do about this.

02:23:37.000 --> 02:23:38.000
All right.

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:39.000
Let's fire away.

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:40.000
Let's try it.

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:41.000
All right.

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:42.000
So I have a PS3 fat.

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:43.000
Great little device.

02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:44.000
Love it.

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:47.000
Main reason why I got a fat, backwards compatibility for the PS2.

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:53.000
So far, I have had it repaired twice for the same old reason, yellow light.

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:56.000
This time when I got it back, they cranked up the fans.

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
So I'm like, okay, fine.

02:23:58.000 --> 02:23:59.000
That's cool.

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:02.000
But when I play my PS3, it sounds like a jet engine.

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:06.000
So I'm like, I can't sit here and play this unless it's during the summer when the air

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:07.000
conditioner is running.

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:10.000
And my mind thinks it's the AC and not the PS3.

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:13.000
Now they clean the fans and it sounds worse.

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000
No, they probably would think it is.

02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:21.000
They took the fan control off and they just wired it straight to the 12 volt or seven

02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000
volt or whatever it's running.

02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:25.000
So it's always at max speed.

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:26.000
Got it.

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
Yeah, that's basically what it is.

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:33.000
So I thought about, you know, maybe if I get lucky, I'll come across another PS3 fat, do

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000
a data transfer and retire this one.

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:44.000
But given with what Square Enix and other companies porting some PS3 games over to Xbox

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:50.000
and we're seeing some PS4 versions of PS3 games, I have been wondering, should I just

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:58.000
figure out which PS3 games that are available on PS4 and Xbox and just get retired as fat

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:03.000
for a slim or should I just drop another 80 bucks on getting it repaired or getting lucky

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:04.000
to get another fat?

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:10.000
Okay, so I'm going to take the Mario Kondo approach and ask, does it spark joy?

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:18.000
Because I'm being serious here because, you know, a lot of times I think we kind of hold

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:23.000
on to old consoles to say, I still have this old console that plays old games, but you

02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:26.000
have to really, and this is even something I'm finding myself challenged with.

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:30.000
Like I still hanging onto a Dreamcast and I love the Dreamcast and Dreamcast has a great

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:35.000
library of games, but how often am I really playing that Dreamcast?

02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:37.000
I'm really not.

02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:41.000
It's funny you bring that up because I don't know if you've seen it, but I have like a

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:44.000
little shelf of all my gaming consoles.

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:48.000
I realize as I'm going through old cables, I find my Dreamcast controller and cables.

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
I'm like, my Dreamcast is in the storage closet.

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:53.000
I should take it out, put it on display and have it.

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:55.000
I said this about two weeks ago.

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:59.000
But to be fair, a big reason why I don't really play the Dreamcast is that a lot of the big

02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:03.000
games that I had on Dreamcast that I enjoyed, they're available on PC now, like Space Channel

02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000
5, probably the best example.

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
Uh, Red is available on other platforms.

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:12.000
Yeah, I had the Space Channel for PS2, but there was one game on Dreamcast that's only

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:13.000
available on Dreamcast.

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:14.000
That's Project Justice.

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:17.000
So I'm like, I'm not getting rid of Dreamcast for that one reason.

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:20.000
Sure, and Power Stone would be another good reason.

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:21.000
But anyway.

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:22.000
Yeah, exactly.

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:23.000
Yeah.

02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:25.000
But anyway, I mean, all that stuff aside, I think the first question you should ask

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:28.000
is how much am I really using this PS3?

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:32.000
And if the answer is you are still using it quite frequently, I would think like second

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:37.000
hand at a flea market or thrift store or something, you ought to be able to find a replacement.

02:26:37.000 --> 02:26:40.000
And that would probably be the route I would go.

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:43.000
But you said it was the kind that had PS2 backwards compatibility, right?

02:26:43.000 --> 02:26:44.000
Yeah.

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:45.000
Mm hmm.

02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:49.000
How often are you using it?

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:52.000
Not often because I've actually retired my PS2.

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:53.000
It's in the storage closet.

02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:59.000
And I'm thinking if I go through my PlayStation 3 games to see what plays where I have no

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:05.000
problems taking the PS2 out, hooking it up, getting a PS3 slim, because what got me thinking

02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:10.000
about this is when Square Enix said Final Fantasy 13 is available for Xbox One.

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:14.000
And I'm sitting there looking at Amazon, all three of those games I could buy new and used

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000
for under 15 bucks.

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:19.000
Meanwhile, I have the three games on PS3.

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:23.000
I've been sitting here like, should I just trade these and just get the Xbox ones and

02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:27.000
just install it on my, you know, I kind of feel like that might be the right route to

02:27:27.000 --> 02:27:30.000
go is to just replace the PlayStation 3 with a new one.

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:34.000
And then, you know, you can retire your PlayStation 2 and use that for your PlayStation 3.

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
And use that for your PlayStation 2 games.

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:39.000
But I mean, if you want, this is going to be a very tinfoil hat approach.

02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:43.000
But we did talk on the show last week about a heavy rumor.

02:27:43.000 --> 02:27:47.000
But, you know, you know how we all feel about rumors, but that PlayStation 5 might have

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:50.000
more backwards compatibility and that whole thing.

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:54.000
And we had a very animated discussion and discord on backwards compatibility and that

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:55.000
whole thing when it comes to Sony.

02:27:55.000 --> 02:28:00.000
And I think at the end of the day, we don't really know because Sony hasn't really established

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:01.000
a standard.

02:28:01.000 --> 02:28:03.000
It's changed from system to system.

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:06.000
So we don't know what's going to happen with PlayStation 5.

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:09.000
But you can risk it.

02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:10.000
You know what?

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:15.000
I might, but to touch on that, I'm sitting here going, to me, there's no reason why Sony

02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:17.000
can't do it because Microsoft did it.

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:20.000
I mean, they're going through the backwards compatibility.

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:24.000
Yes, I still have a 360 for a bunch of games I still play.

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:29.000
Uh oh, did we lose you?

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.000
Yep, I think we did.

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:32.000
Rama, come in, Rama.

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:35.000
Yeah, he's still connected in our discord room.

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:38.000
But let's try to finish and then maybe he'll kind of join.

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:42.000
So I think he was kind of talking about that he's still, you know, a lot of the Xbox 360

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
kind of ended up on the backwards compatibility.

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:49.000
And so he probably uses his Xbox One to play a lot of those former Xbox games and so forth.

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
So, yeah.

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:52.000
I don't know.

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:55.000
My fat's still in the garage.

02:28:55.000 --> 02:28:56.000
Oh, really?

02:28:56.000 --> 02:29:00.000
I don't know if it works yet or if it still works.

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:01.000
I have a 20, though.

02:29:01.000 --> 02:29:04.000
So that kind of sucks because it doesn't have Wi-Fi built into it.

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000
But, eh, whatever.

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:07.000
He just popped back in the green room.

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:10.000
Let me try to pull him back in and see maybe if you wanted to finish his thought.

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:11.000
Are you back, Rama?

02:29:11.000 --> 02:29:12.000
Yeah, I'm back.

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
I don't know what happened lately.

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:18.000
Um, my Wi-Fi here has been kind of odd with the router.

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000
So it's like I might have to call and get that replaced.

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:23.000
So I apologize for cutting off.

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:24.000
That's OK.

02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:27.000
But let's finish your thought and then we'll try to wrap up here because you were talking

02:29:27.000 --> 02:29:29.000
about the Xbox and you were using your Xbox.

02:29:29.000 --> 02:29:34.000
I'm just saying if we had backwards compatibility on the Xbox, the hardware is there.

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:35.000
So Microsoft can do it.

02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:40.000
We don't know what how customizable the the chip is in the PS3.

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:45.000
So that could be way Sony's like, we don't know how to properly emulate, which I get

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:46.000
that.

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:50.000
But the PS5 with the hardware that they're coming out with, which is basically off the

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:56.000
shelf parts to me from a technological hardware point, there's no reason why they can't do

02:29:57.000 --> 02:29:58.000
that.

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:02.000
Ultimately, it's going to be up to Sony because, you know, maybe they want you to buy them

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:03.000
again.

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:04.000
And it's all going to be digital and streaming only.

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:07.000
Maybe they don't want to have native backwards compatibility on it.

02:30:07.000 --> 02:30:09.000
I mean, who knows?

02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:10.000
I don't.

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
We could come up with a million different solutions.

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:17.000
But as far as you say, as far as your immediate problem goes, I would say, you know what?

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:22.000
Look at how many hours you're really spending a day playing the PlayStation 3 and the associated

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:23.000
games.

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:25.000
And if you are still playing in a significant amount, then I would say just replace it.

02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:28.000
It's not going to be that expensive to replace it secondhand.

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:29.000
And I would go that route.

02:30:29.000 --> 02:30:30.000
No.

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
I mean, there's a couple of secondhand shops I can check out.

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:38.000
But, you know, if I can just like look at my options to see what goes where, I'm good

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:44.000
because, I mean, I have the Kingdom Hearts Collector's Edition for PS3, and now I have

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000
it for PS4, so I'm blessed for that.

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:50.000
The Final Fantasy 10.10.2, I get that for PS4.

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:53.000
I'm just like, well, hey.

02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:54.000
Yeah.

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:58.000
You just have to ask yourself, how many hours am I really going to use it, and is it worth

02:30:58.000 --> 02:30:59.000
it?

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:00.000
And only really you know the answer to that.

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
That's as far as we can help you.

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:06.000
Yeah, I think I'm probably going to go that route, but I just, but it's the same way as

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
when I upgraded my PC hardware.

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:14.000
I just wanted to have somebody on the outside come in and take a look at it from another

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:15.000
point of view.

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:16.000
Sure.

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:17.000
And I appreciate that.

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:18.000
You are welcome.

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:22.000
Anime Jam Sessions, Tuesday nights, hosted here at VOG Network.

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:26.000
And if you aren't already following the Anime Jam Sessions channel here on Twitch, y'all

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:27.000
should do that right away.

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:28.000
Thank you so much, Rama.

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
Always a pleasure to have you here.

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:31.000
Love it.

02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:32.000
Take care, you guys.

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:33.000
Take care, buddy.

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:34.000
All right.

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
And I think Katsu Kahn is coming up real soon.

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:39.000
I think he said this weekend, so probably this coming weekend, President's Day weekend,

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:43.000
so I'm sure they'll have a lot to say on that over on Anime Jam Sessions.

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:44.000
Actually, Rama got me to go to that one year.

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:45.000
I had a good time.

02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:50.000
I'd love to go again if I had the travel budget for it, but you know, only so much time off

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
available and so much money and so forth.

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
But Alan starts a new job tomorrow.

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:55.000
That's really exciting.

02:31:55.000 --> 02:31:56.000
I'm very happy.

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000
Yeah, I know he is really happy about that, too.

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:02.000
And we are happy to be at the end of another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
That's going to do it for our calls tonight.

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:07.000
Sorry to anyone that didn't get through, but I didn't see anybody else in there.

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:12.000
I know we've had a lot of the same callers week after week, but it's it's open to everybody.

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:16.000
You know, we are, as I say, we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
But you got to put your voices out there if you want to be heard.

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000
So be it in our chat room.

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:21.000
Not everybody.

02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:22.000
I know some people get shy.

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:23.000
I get it.

02:32:23.000 --> 02:32:24.000
They don't want to have their voice at school.

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:28.000
But, you know, you can always lend us a thought in our chat room live.

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:32.000
Or if you aren't able to be here Sunday nights live with us because of other commitments,

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
we certainly do appreciate emails and tweets.

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:35.000
I don't always read the tweets on air.

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000
I just kind of forget, honestly.

02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:41.000
But I do reply like if you guys ask questions that like necessitate a reply.

02:32:41.000 --> 02:32:44.000
I always try to go in and reply.

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:47.000
If you just say like, thanks, love the show, I'll usually favorite it.

02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:48.000
It's like I read it.

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
Thank you type of thing.

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:51.000
And I do appreciate that stuff.

02:32:51.000 --> 02:32:53.000
So, yeah.

02:32:53.000 --> 02:32:56.000
So I guess that really brings us to the end of another show.

02:32:56.000 --> 02:33:00.000
As I always say, thank you for supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:06.000
You can continue to support the show by leaving us a nice five star review on iTunes or wherever it is that you found this podcast.

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
I really appreciate that.

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:12.000
As far as Twitch goes, you know, we really appreciate the subscriptions and the biddies.

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:13.000
I saw some biddies come in tonight.

02:33:13.000 --> 02:33:15.000
So thank you guys so much for all of that.

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:17.000
And that always goes a long way as well.

02:33:17.000 --> 02:33:19.000
And again, if you can just tell your friends to subscribe.

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:22.000
The little hosts, a lot of you guys are hosting us on Sunday nights.

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:23.000
That is awesome.

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:24.000
That really helps as well.

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:25.000
And all of that goes a long way.

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:29.000
And we are looking at more ideas on how to grow out VOG Network on Twitch,

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:32.000
not just through us here at OLR and Mr. Bobby Black Wolf,

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:37.000
but through our other content providers that have historically been a part of the voice geeks network

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:40.000
and really excited to hopefully have some more stuff in the future.

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
Anyway, for now, it's time to wrap up.

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:43.000
So final thoughts time.

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000
Loki, any final thoughts for you tonight?

02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:49.000
I'm going to try to do more streaming because I know I'm just about to fill you.

02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:53.000
I've got the followers now, but I need to get the hours day streaming

02:33:53.000 --> 02:33:58.000
and number of people chatting at one time up.

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:02.000
I've been really bad about the streaming lately, honestly.

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:07.000
I've been so focused on this that I just haven't really had the time to do other stuff.

02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:09.000
But I do really want to get back into that habit.

02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:10.000
That's the problem is I'm falling out of the habit.

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:13.000
If you don't make it a habit, then you don't do it as much.

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:17.000
Yeah, so I need to do that, and I also need to be playing DDR more.

02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000
And I do want to stream other things.

02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:25.000
I just have to figure out the setup with not disturbing the rest of my family when I do it and stuff.

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:30.000
Although I didn't think it was too crazy last time when I was streaming by myself.

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:33.000
So, well, we'll see.

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:37.000
Because I do want to do more Skyrim stuff because that was pretty fun.

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:41.000
And my final thought is I hope to do more VR gaming this week.

02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:45.000
Because I bought a new one based off a Twitter recommendation I haven't been able to touch this week.

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:49.000
And then from watching your stream, I was like, oh yeah, I still need to play Skyrim VR.

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:51.000
Yeah, I still need to play Skyrim VR.

02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:53.000
Let's do that this week.

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:56.000
So we can talk about a seven-year-old game again next week.

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:59.000
That'll be a lot of fun. But that's the way we game sometimes.

02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:02.000
Anyway, that's going to do it for another episode here of Orange Lounge Radio.

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:06.000
Thank you guys again so much for either watching live or downloading and listening on the podcast feed.

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:09.000
We appreciate you guys so much and we'll be back to do it again in seven days.

02:35:09.000 --> 02:35:11.000
On a three-day weekend nonetheless.

02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:13.000
So that'll be a lot of fun. We'll see you next time, guys.

02:35:13.000 --> 02:35:15.000
Have a good night everybody. Bye.

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000
See you next week.

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
Thanks for watching.
