0	18000	This week, stories have come out on the Game Awards and the art of keeping their biggest
18000	19000	secrets a secret.
19000	22420	How the show's biggest reveals were hidden from industry, event and other staff until
22420	23420	the night of.
23420	26540	Stay tuned for this and plenty more news starting right now on the show, where every gamer has
26540	33540	a voice.
33540	37340	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
37340	39100	where every gamer has a voice.
39100	45460	It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 803 for this December the 22nd
45460	47480	of 2019.
47480	50620	Or as my sister might say, Christmas Eve Eve Eve.
50620	56060	Or as DarkSakura might say, the first night of Hanukkah.
56060	58900	Happy Hanukkah to you too.
58900	62340	Are you willing to show that on stream for those that are watching live as we do tape
62340	67800	live at twitch.tv slash vog network for voice the geeks network every Sunday night at six
67800	71060	o'clock pacific nine o'clock eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
71060	74260	And I was asking if DarkSakura would kindly step to the other side of the camera to show
74260	78660	off her holiday sweater that she's wearing this Happy Lamaka Happy Lamaka, which I love
78660	79660	it.
79660	80660	It's cute.
80660	85100	If I don't wear my pajamas to work on Friday on Wednesday, sorry for Christmas because
85140	87500	I'm working Christmas because hello double and a half pay.
87500	88500	Yeah, right.
88500	89500	On a 10 hour shift.
89500	90500	Yeah.
90500	91500	Hello.
91500	92500	I'd work too if I could for that kind of money.
92500	93820	Um, I might either wear this or my onesie.
93820	94820	I haven't decided.
94820	95820	There you go.
95820	97460	But I'm making latkes in two minutes.
97460	98460	That's right.
98460	99460	The latke countdown is on.
99460	100460	Yeah.
100460	102200	It's a, it's a holiday food festivity too actually.
102200	105860	And I want to mention this because before the show we were chowing down one of our listeners
105860	111660	stopped by the house because she's one of my ingress buddies and dropped off some nuts.
111660	116260	So we've been enjoying some candied nuts, which we have been calling Deez Nuts.
116260	118140	So we have been enjoying praline pecans.
118140	119140	Yes they are.
119140	121140	They are a praline pecans that we've been enjoying throughout the show.
121140	122140	Oh, is that some chat?
122140	126180	So show her a little love there for sharing Deez Nuts with us here on the show.
126180	127180	Thank you.
127180	130980	That's I believe that's the only way we can get away with showing nuts on camera here
130980	135260	at the wonderful Twitch TV in the spirit of the holidays.
135260	136260	All right.
136260	140080	Uh, but of course I can't have a discussion about food and leave out the one and only
140080	141080	tech master Loki.
141080	142080	Sorry.
142080	143080	I ate all the bread.
143080	144080	Well, there's actually two breadsticks left.
144080	145080	Two breadsticks.
145080	146080	Oh, and the spirit of the holidays you're sharing.
146080	147080	I'm just kidding.
147080	148080	Yes.
148080	149080	Cause I can't eat anymore.
149080	150720	Well, I'm so full right now.
150720	154700	And there's latkes coming cause dark soccer is, you know, we're all celebrating.
154700	159080	We were celebrating all of the holiday things, um, especially when food's involved.
159080	160080	Hello.
160080	163720	So like I'll celebrate all the winter holidays, uh, by eating.
163720	166640	So that's what we're going to do tonight is enjoy some latkes.
166640	167640	I'm excited.
167640	168640	So, um, yeah.
168640	173240	It's the one time, it's the one time of year where I can say dark soccer.
173240	178480	It's time to get in the kitchen and I'm not going to get yelled at.
178480	179480	Yes.
179480	180480	Dark soccer.
180480	181480	It's time to get in the kitchen.
181480	182480	Girl.
182480	183480	All right.
183480	187180	The only time of year that I can get away with that.
187180	192960	Cause it's not look behind you in the little orange can in the orange can, right?
192960	196840	It's going to be one of those nights, uh, folks that are tuning in and, uh, listening
196840	201040	on the podcast feed, of course, uh, which you can check out for yourself, uh, wherever,
201040	207440	uh, popular podcasts can be found such as, uh, Apple, iTunes and, um, Google, uh, store.
207440	210080	Uh, what is the Android Google podcast?
210080	215160	Uh, the only place we aren't on right now, we're not on stitcher because they kind of
215160	216960	burned their bridges with us a few years ago.
216960	219760	Uh, I'll tell you more about it some other time, although I've mentioned on the show
219760	222200	in the past and we are not yet on Spotify.
222200	225800	Uh, that is something that I'm hoping will be coming in 2020.
225840	227760	So, uh, yeah, pretty cool.
227760	228760	Anyway.
228760	230000	So hello everybody in chat.
230000	231000	I see all the love.
231000	235640	I see some folks, um, uh, sharing some love for the sweater there.
235640	241640	Uh, and it looks like, um, a bunch, one of our very, very kind listeners, she Hulk, uh,
241640	245440	just somehow spammed out a bunch of emojis to folks that are watching live.
245440	246440	So everybody was saying, thank you.
246440	247440	Thank you.
247440	248440	Thank you.
248440	249440	So really appreciate that.
249440	252320	She hoax always, uh, one of our generous folks that's here listening live.
252320	253760	So anyway, let's get into it.
253760	257760	The news is a little lighter this week when it comes to video games, which makes sense.
257760	259760	I mean, with the holidays.
259760	264160	Well, if you think this week is slow, we're going to be here next Sunday.
264160	268800	That's I wouldn't expect hardly any news to come out this next week, but next week I'll
268800	269800	tease you with this.
269800	274520	Uh, we will be having our show where we can talk about the game of the year, but because
274520	276240	it's 2019, yes.
276240	280640	We also get to talk about the game of the decade and we can talk about the video game
280640	281640	news stories.
281640	282640	And, and.
282640	283640	Okay.
283640	288040	And, and I don't remember if this happens at the end of the year or the start of the
288040	291520	next year, but we have the time capsule.
291520	294720	Oh, I forgot about the time capsule.
294720	295720	Oh shit.
295720	296720	Okay.
296720	299960	Well, depending, I don't want to promise the time capsule next week, but depending on the
299960	300960	news.
300960	303880	So if we're really light on news, we may just do time capsule next week because it's close
303880	304880	enough to the end of the year.
304880	305880	Yeah.
305880	306880	I already think we did.
306880	307880	So yes, that's right.
307880	308880	We have time capsule.
308880	309880	I forgot.
309880	310880	I forgot about the fucking time caps.
310880	311880	That's the point we forget every year.
311880	317000	All right.
317000	319040	So anyway, uh, very excited about that.
319040	322240	So we'll be getting into the time capsule, uh, maybe next week or the week after, depending
322240	323880	on how things are going.
323880	328800	So anyhow, uh, let's get into our kickoff topic tonight, which has to do with the dual
328800	329800	shock force.
329800	333680	This actually is kind of a pretty big announcement for the end of the year.
333680	337840	This is the type of thing you would have thought might've been coming for the holidays or something,
337840	339840	but no, it decided to show up now.
339840	340840	I'm sorry.
340840	346320	My, when I say holidays, holiday shopping, meaning like it would have been out like black
346320	347320	Friday.
347320	348320	Yeah.
348320	349320	Now we're getting it.
349320	350320	The actual holiday a little close.
350320	351320	So I'm not sure.
351320	354120	Well, not even it's a next year.
354120	355120	Yeah.
355120	356120	We're getting the announcement now for next year.
356120	357120	Yeah.
357120	358120	So, yeah.
358120	362040	So anyway, uh, the back button attachment was announced by Sony this past week.
362040	364520	It actually has a little display on it, which is interesting.
364520	369520	So it is, it's a display for the back of your controller, but that display will actually
369520	373520	show you what you are mapping these back buttons to.
373520	377120	So, and I guess what it can actually store different control schemes as well, which is
377120	378120	interesting.
378120	382240	Uh, it also works with PlayStation VR titles, which we, you know, would be expected right.
382240	387480	And all that, uh, coming out on January 23rd and the attachment is going to be about $30.
387480	389280	So um, yeah, interesting.
389280	390280	What do you think about this?
390280	391280	Loki?
391280	393120	Oh no, it seems kind of unnecessary.
393120	398320	I, I hate to say it, but I'm kind of in a very similar sort of boat where I'm like,
398320	402860	I don't know if this is really necessary, but maybe that's because we haven't seen the
402860	407120	games that are going to incorporate this as a mapping stuff.
407120	411020	It seems like it's more of like this, like I'm going to be a competitive eat sports player
411020	412600	and interesting.
412600	418400	Um, I could see, well, uh, especially in a game like Final Fantasy 14, there's all sorts
418400	421780	of weird ass button combinations because you know, that's a game that's designed with like
421780	425520	keyboard and mouse, you know, although it works very well in controller, don't get me
425520	426520	wrong.
426520	430120	I would think that that attachment is going to lend itself very well to maybe doing some,
430120	432000	some macros and that type of thing.
432000	437680	But I mean, we don't, we, we don't think it has any separate functionality now, but it
437680	439040	might later.
439040	443320	Uh, and this kind of lends itself to something we were just talking about with our pal Bobby
443320	446560	Black Wolf, um, who was just live on his program.
446560	450840	And he was talking a little bit about how, um, his thought is that this could be an early
450840	453120	thing for the PlayStation five.
453120	457580	And part of the reason we're getting this now is because when the PlayStation five comes
457580	461120	out, these controllers, you know, if you have this attachment, they can kind of lend themselves
461120	463040	to the PlayStation five.
463040	467360	And I guess it would also make sense for games because there's going to be some games that
467360	468360	are going to be coming out.
468360	471440	So for example, the final fantasy seven remake is a prime example.
471440	476480	In my opinion, the final fantasy seven remake comes out and let's say it has functionality
476480	479200	that incorporates those back button triggers into something new.
479200	482000	I don't know what, you know, but something new.
482000	485720	Well, that almost would guarantee we're going to see this on PlayStation five, because I'm
485720	489480	telling you bank money on the fact that the final fantasy seven remake will be out on
489480	490720	PlayStation five as well.
490720	497160	It has to happen because this is only the first episode of more final fantasy seven
497160	502120	games because this, uh, fantasy seven remake only goes through the Midgar portion of the
502120	503120	game.
503120	508780	So the plan is to do the rest of it at some point, but by then most gamers will have moved
508780	510900	on to picking up a PlayStation five console.
510900	513780	So whatever happens next will have to be on the PlayStation five.
513780	518540	That's not even talking about what's going on in the Xbox world, but this controller
518540	520700	news isn't about Xbox, it's about PlayStation.
520700	522160	So we'll stick with that for now.
522160	527300	So I'm looking at our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network, fifth dream today says,
527300	532260	I'm going to use it to map the X button to the back so I can press it with my left hand
532260	539900	to advance RPG text and eat with the right hand, actually, Hey, not a bad plan.
539900	546700	You know, and I have to say, um, when I first saw this design, my mind went to accessibility
546700	551620	and you're using it in a tongue in cheek way, but certainly for other gamers out there,
551620	555380	maybe this is going to be something that makes a certain games and certain button presses
555380	559260	and things, a more accessible thing, which is a very cool thing.
559260	563980	And in my mind, I kind of went, Ooh, maybe this is some type of response to the Xbox
563980	565780	accessibility controller.
565780	569980	Now, of course it's not the same thing by any means, but maybe, okay, maybe they saw
569980	573340	that an accessibility thing was really well received in attachment.
573340	578620	So they wanted to do something similar so I could see that perspective as well.
578620	579740	So I don't know.
579740	584280	I don't think, I think if they wanted to do something like that as an accessibility thing,
584280	589260	they would make it, it would be more robust, like the accessibility stuff with Xbox.
589260	593740	This is kind of like, I think this is more of like, Hey, you know, we've seen some of
593740	597300	these third-party controllers or even like with Microsoft, with their elite controller
597300	600340	where they have these back button triggers and stuff.
600340	604100	Let's get a piece of that action way too late in the game.
604100	608580	Now of course, because this is our chat room in the spirit of Christmas, they're going,
608580	610100	they're taking it to the toilet.
610100	611100	Awesome.
611100	612100	Yes.
612100	613460	Beat me to it.
613460	618140	Because fifth dream today was saying I could have used my left hand to advance RPG text
618140	619900	and eat with the right hand.
619900	624340	And Bobby Black Wolf merely responded in quotes, eat.
624340	626700	And Bobby Black Wolf.
626700	629780	He didn't say, he did not say visual novels.
629780	630780	He said, RPG.
630780	635040	Pod culture follows that up with the PlayStation fap attachment.
635040	636140	So there we go.
636140	642420	If those types of games are coming out, if a Hunie pop is announced for PlayStation,
642420	643660	then maybe that will be a thing.
643660	644660	I don't know.
644660	646780	What are those adult games on Steam?
646780	647780	I don't know.
647780	648780	Like all of them.
648780	649780	I mean, there's like so many.
650660	651660	I don't think that was an adult game.
651660	652660	Is it?
652660	653660	I thought it was.
653660	654660	Anyway.
654660	658900	Pixelpaca says there was that one-handed RPG controller on PlayStation one.
658900	661460	I seem to remember something like that too.
661460	664900	So and dark soccer is trying to participate in the kitchen without a microphone, but she's
664900	665900	saying she used one.
665900	667340	When I had surgery on my hand.
667340	670020	Oh, when she had surgery on her hand, she used one.
670020	675640	So anyway, Pixelpaca's in chat says fun bag fantasy.
675640	677420	That is a real game name on Steam.
677460	680940	Well, of course, because if we're going to talk about the toilet, let's talk about Steam's
680940	686220	library, which I'm sure you're all consuming during the wonderful Steam sale that's going
686220	687220	on for the holidays.
687220	689420	But I think we get into more on that later on.
689420	694500	But anyway, She-Hulk in chat says the Xbox elite controller rocks.
694500	695820	Maybe the best ever made.
695820	700260	Well, good news for you, She-Hulk, is that with the next round of Xbox or the XX or the
700260	705540	Xbox Series X, if you want to be legit, the controller that is bundled in with it is a
705540	707860	lot more like an elite controller.
707860	711700	It isn't exactly an elite controller, but like the D-Pad is more like what you see with
711700	712700	the elite controller.
712700	717420	So it's taking a lot of its cues from that controller and that it is a really nice controller.
717420	720720	Let's you know, let's tell the truth here.
720720	724700	It's a great controller, but a pair of back buttons and a screen on the back of the controller
724700	725900	is not going to turn the PlayStation.
725900	729340	But is that really worth spending another $30 for?
729340	731320	As it is in my in my.
731320	734040	That's like more than half the cost of the controller.
734040	735200	Here's my opinion.
735200	741040	For me in my current position, no, it's not worth it and I'm not going to pick one up.
741040	747640	However, I think it's cool that it's out there as an option for potential accessibility issues.
747640	749360	That's great.
749360	754500	And if we see games incorporating it in the future and this whole PlayStation 5 theory
754500	759360	kind of lends itself to light, then I'd probably be more likely to pick one up.
759360	764480	However, if this is functionality that's just built into the PlayStation 5 controller,
764480	769580	then I'm more likely to just pick up a PlayStation 5 and I'll have it built into whatever controller
769580	771160	they release at that time.
771160	774400	And that's when I'll finally have the back buttons or whatever that is.
774400	780920	So anyway, She-Hulk continuing to lavish praise on the Xbox elite controller and chat saying
780920	784680	my online gaming improved instantly, felt like I'm cheating with it.
784680	789060	It is it is a nice piece of hardware, but I mean, you pay a premium for it.
789060	793420	It's almost expensive as expensive as a console, but it is really, really well done.
793420	796580	And I mean, the fact that you can use those on PCs as well, I mean, you know, it's pretty
796580	797580	cool.
797580	798580	So.
798580	799580	All right.
799580	805480	So a big no on this attachment, but yay that it exists from both of us here on camera.
805480	810080	And I think Jamie, she's finishing up the lockers, but I think she, do you approve Dark
810080	811080	Sakura of this?
811080	812080	Sure.
812080	817580	She says sure for this attachment, but I think more maybe the premonition of perhaps what's
817580	819500	to come with PlayStation five.
819500	822980	Let's let's marinate on that for a little bit.
822980	826340	Thirty dollars for more junk in the trunk for my controller.
826340	830500	Dark Sakura saying from the kitchen something that I had brought up a Bobby show that I
830500	831500	forgot about.
831500	836260	But talking about the Vita title implementation, because, you know, Vita had the back touch.
836260	842220	Now, this is not the same thing because the PlayStation back attachment are buttons and
842220	846020	the PlayStation four back was like you could swipe different directions.
846020	847380	It was a touch pad.
847380	850380	But a lot of games kind of used it like buttons.
850380	854940	In fact, if you tried to emulate PlayStation two games on your Vita, you would have, there
854940	859080	was no L2 and R2 so you had to use the back screen to kind of do that.
859080	866140	So there is an argument to be made that this is, you know, something that could be opening
866140	871340	the door to Vita support later down, down, down, down the line, but we'll, we'll see.
871340	876740	So I guess we'll see as the games start to come out in 2020, pay attention to that Final
876740	877940	Fantasy remake.
877940	881420	I think that's going to be a very big barometer with that sort of thing.
881420	882420	So, all right.
882420	884300	Anything else on the back button attachment?
884300	885300	I don't think so.
885300	888340	So let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we
888340	889820	have been playing this week.
889820	892220	I think Dark Sakura is wrapping up the first batch of latkes.
892220	894420	So I'm going to just go ahead and start with Loki while she finishes up.
894420	897340	I didn't play jack shit.
897340	898380	So I, no, I did.
898380	904420	I played a little bit of Minecraft earth and a little bit of Pokemon go, but that's about
904420	905420	it.
905420	906420	I didn't really play any console games.
906420	911900	I did pick up finally, um, only because my kids wanted me to, and I've been just holding
911900	915820	off on it, but, um, Beat Saber.
915820	921420	So I picked that up and, um, I'd recommend the green day stuff because I really, I did
921420	922420	not.
922420	923660	Um, I haven't picked up anything yet.
923660	929220	I was going to get some of the tracks that they have as part of their, um, I forget what
929220	935540	the label is, but the, there was some of the stuff from a robot.
935540	939020	Was it a think a robot machine or something like that?
939020	941060	That, uh, it was pretty cool.
941060	943820	I've been listening to some of their tracks, monster cat, monster cat.
943820	944820	Thank you.
944820	948900	So yeah, the monster cat, um, music, I was thinking about picking up that pack, but I
948900	950420	haven't done it yet.
950420	951740	Um, it's good.
951740	952740	I like the stuff.
952740	953940	They have a couple of freebies too.
953940	954940	Like the crab rave.
954940	955940	Oh, that'd be cool.
955940	956940	Yeah, that's fun.
957140	960420	What I recommend though, if like you are looking to pick stuff up on the steam sale is go check
960420	964640	Humble Bundle too, because Humble Bundle, when you do it through them, you also get like
964640	968740	a certain percentage of that back onto your account as like a credit.
968740	971140	So it actually ends up being slightly cheaper.
971140	972820	Okay.
972820	975900	So Lacas have set up the fire alarm.
975900	979040	So Loki, you're going to have to fill time for yourself while I take care of this.
979040	984620	So I mean, so basically I was just, um, you know, looking to get some games there.
984620	990820	I didn't end up purchasing, uh, Earth Defense Force, um, Iron Rain.
990820	996580	Almost purchased that, but, um, I just don't know if I'm going to get to it right away.
996580	998360	And also the reviews aren't that great for it.
998360	999360	So we'll see.
999360	1000860	Maybe it has to get a little bit cheaper than 29.99.
1000860	1006100	Uh, what I did do today though, is I did introduce the kids to Cuzar finally.
1006100	1011660	So we drove the hour away to the one place that has Cuzar nearby and went and played
1011660	1012660	there.
1012860	1018300	And unfortunately, even though it was an hour in the rain, both directions, uh, there wasn't
1018300	1022140	really anybody else there because it's a Sunday during the day.
1022140	1026700	Um, and no one really wants to play Cuzar apparently, but at least everything was in
1026700	1027700	decent condition.
1027700	1030060	Although the arena is surprisingly dark.
1030060	1034600	I do not remember it being that dark and like when I went in there, I was like, are there
1034600	1035600	lights out?
1035600	1041180	I mean, I don't remember it being this dark, but, um, the kids picked it up really quickly
1041180	1045980	and, and bless her heart, they said it's the most favorite, you know, laser tag game
1045980	1046980	that they played.
1046980	1048540	And I was like, cool.
1048540	1049540	I'm sorry.
1049540	1051180	I was dealing with the fire situation or smoke.
1051180	1052180	It's smoke.
1052180	1055860	It's just, it's not really, uh, the oil that she uses lock has makes a lot of smoke and
1055860	1057020	we didn't have a window open.
1057020	1060180	So it was building up under, there's a fire alarm just, can you even see it?
1060180	1062740	You can actually see it on camera way in the corner there.
1062740	1063860	And that's the one that was going on.
1063860	1064860	So sorry.
1064860	1067660	Um, so I'm sorry you took them to the one in Vacaville.
1067660	1068660	Yes.
1068660	1069660	Oh fun.
1069660	1070660	Yeah.
1071140	1074140	It was really worth the trip though, down there, just because the amount of time we
1074140	1077680	got to actually spend there wasn't very long and there wasn't a whole lot of people there.
1077680	1080580	Although they have a whole new arcade, like their arcade is like redone.
1080580	1081660	Oh wow.
1081660	1086500	Which not necessarily in the good sense, it's all of the giant, those huge, like kind of
1086500	1091420	attraction games that they have like the, the huge, I'm not gambling, but it's the thing
1091420	1094700	that you have to pull a lever on to spin something.
1094700	1097700	It's it's gambling, um, ticket machines.
1097740	1101980	And then they also had, um, the giant halo game that's there.
1101980	1103380	Um, that was kind of cool.
1103380	1107440	No DDR or anything or I think the last time I went there was in the groove too or something,
1107440	1108940	but none of that anymore.
1108940	1114580	Um, and of course, you know, the two kids working the counter for Qsar just didn't give
1114580	1115780	a shit about Qsar.
1115780	1121560	They, they gave him as much of a shit as the kids at the, um, local laser tag place here.
1121560	1123420	So it's fine.
1123420	1124420	You know, whatever.
1124420	1127020	Um, well, they had fun.
1127020	1130980	We played a couple of games and then drove back home because it's an hour drive in the
1130980	1132780	rain and traffic.
1132780	1135940	And so, um, yeah, it was fun.
1135940	1141100	It's worth, it was worth it to get them to see that when I do it again, probably not,
1141100	1143300	but I'll have to go down there at some point again.
1143300	1144300	Okay.
1144300	1145300	Fun.
1145300	1146700	Um, let's see my gaming week.
1146700	1148300	Um, a lot of similar stuff.
1148300	1153140	I'm still playing Final Fantasy 14 as always, uh, been going on random blue mage adventures
1153140	1156460	in that game because in one of the group chats I was in, they started talking about blue
1156460	1157620	mage randomly.
1157620	1162100	Um, and I was like, oh, I haven't really checked that out since, um, you know, it was first
1162100	1166620	added into the storm blood expansion and I was kind of very lukewarm on it, but they
1166620	1167740	added new content.
1167740	1172260	So they added content up to level 60 so you can play a blue mage up to level 60 now.
1172260	1175940	So I was like, okay, I'll go check it out and, you know, see what's different about
1175940	1176940	it.
1176940	1181180	And, uh, yeah, I, I still wish they would just let you play a blue mage in regular content
1181180	1185800	and I'm not going to rehash the old arguments, but it's been a fun little diversion.
1185800	1187320	It's something new to do in the game.
1187320	1190640	I like that there's like a million different things you can do with Final Fantasy 14 besides
1190640	1192080	just like rating.
1192080	1193220	So I'll give them that.
1193220	1197360	At least they've created a lot of fun side things to do, even if, you know, a blue mage
1197360	1199900	should be part of the main content.
1199900	1203460	I was going through my PlayStation account today because I was checking out the holiday
1203460	1205520	sale to see if there was anything I wanted to buy.
1205520	1209360	Um, and I just started randomly playing stuff on my PlayStation that I hadn't played in
1209360	1214360	a while, like DJ Max Technica, which I still want to buy some of those DLC song packs,
1214360	1217000	but they're really expensive still.
1217000	1222080	So I'm like, I don't want to pay like 15 bucks because I really like one song in this pack.
1222080	1226780	I did hear the DJ Max Technica is on the early release on PC, but I'm not, I'm not double
1226780	1228080	dipping for that much money.
1228080	1231860	They want, they want a like full price game for it and I'm not, I'm not going to double
1231860	1235160	dip for that for like two new songs or whatever it is they have on PC.
1235160	1238360	Uh, it's not enough licensed stuff to make it worth it to me.
1238360	1239360	Sorry.
1239360	1243300	Um, but I was playing that a little bit and then I was also playing, um, it's getting
1243300	1244300	smoky in here again.
1244300	1245300	I'm really worried.
1245300	1246300	It's gonna, no, it's fine.
1246300	1247300	It is.
1247300	1248300	Is that the last batch you said?
1248300	1249300	Okay.
1249300	1252740	So hopefully it doesn't go off again, but I'm eyeing it suspiciously.
1252740	1256580	This is why when I used to make super vacant that we'd have a dedicated fan to blow the
1256580	1259220	smoke away from the smoke alarm.
1259220	1260220	Yeah.
1260220	1261220	I might.
1261220	1262220	Okay.
1262220	1265340	Well we'll see if, if it goes off again, Loki, you just need to fan it with your jacket out
1265340	1270500	of there and it'll be just the calendar that we have that, that to, um, also a window.
1270500	1273060	Alan opened a window in there and then I opened the window here.
1273060	1273820	It'll be fine.
1273820	1274820	It'll draft through.
1274820	1275820	It's just going to take a minute.
1275820	1281160	So anyway, um, patient pockets and chat says I double dip for DG max respect on steam.
1281160	1282160	Was it worth it?
1282160	1283160	Pay some pockets.
1283160	1285420	I mean like truly like, do you enjoy it?
1285420	1286540	Are you happy with that?
1286540	1292020	Cause I mean, Lord knows I've doubled and triple dipped on things that maybe I shouldn't
1292020	1293820	have, but I just liked the game that much.
1293820	1294820	They did it.
1294820	1297380	For example, Mass Effect three on Wii U.
1297380	1298940	There was no point to me doing that.
1298940	1299940	There really wasn't.
1299940	1307620	Um, speaking, speaking of double dipping, um, I played Pac-Man championship edition
1307620	1312340	on PlayStation four cause I already had it, but I also had the one on switch because the
1312340	1317460	switch version came with the two player one, the CE plus or whatever it was called.
1317460	1321460	I don't remember, but I remembered, Oh yeah, I have this on PlayStation and because I've
1321460	1325140	been playing a lot on switch, I got better and I was like, what are these trophies?
1325140	1326140	I don't have a lot.
1326140	1328540	I only have to get an a on expert mode to get a gold.
1328540	1329700	I should be able to do that.
1329700	1334220	And I did, and I actually got two golds to get a gold for B and a gold for a.
1334220	1335220	So it was like, cool.
1335220	1337420	If I could get an S getting an S is really hard.
1337420	1338980	I could probably do it.
1338980	1344100	Um, cause I've done it on a beginner or whatever they call the first single train mode, but
1344100	1348060	I haven't done it on a expert mode, which is it's hard.
1348060	1349920	Expert mode is a lot of luck is involved.
1349920	1353060	I think that's why some people get really annoyed with championship edition too.
1353060	1357560	Cause there's a lot of luck involved in it, especially when the ghosts go on rails.
1357560	1363200	So anyway, um, so I was playing a little bit of that and um, I think that's really about
1363200	1364560	it for my gaming week.
1364560	1366560	I don't think there was a lot of extra stuff really.
1366560	1370000	Uh, trying to think, Oh, uh, the cell phone gaming stuff.
1370000	1373380	So, um, I was actually going to ask you, cause you mentioned Minecraft earth, but the smoke
1373380	1374560	alarm thing threw me off.
1374560	1378440	Uh, I've noticed that some updates for Minecraft earth came down to my phone.
1378440	1380960	Have they actually updated, changed anything in it?
1380960	1383660	They have an event going on right now for like the holidays.
1383660	1389940	So they have, you can get the, the jolly llama, which I did get and they've got like snow
1389940	1393220	and stuff like that, that they're adding like blocks that you can get.
1393220	1396440	I haven't really done any of the adventures recently to see if those are different, but
1396440	1398020	other than that, that's kind of it.
1398020	1399020	Oh, that's fun.
1399020	1400020	Did you hurt yourself?
1400020	1401020	I burned my knuckle.
1401020	1402020	Oh no.
1402020	1403020	Do you need anything?
1403020	1405820	No, it's just the oil popped and it's fine.
1405820	1408980	I ran it under the cool tap, but I should have run it longer.
1408980	1409980	Yeah.
1409980	1410980	It's anyway.
1410980	1413100	Well, if you feel you can do it, why don't you tell us about your gaming week?
1413540	1415540	Um, I played some, uh, did my shirt melt?
1415540	1416540	No.
1416540	1417540	Okay.
1417540	1420540	I played, um, uh, Pokemon, uh, sword and that's about it.
1420540	1425940	Um, I finally deleted, uh, idle pouring, so I'm no longer playing the Ragnarok thing.
1425940	1426940	Freedom.
1426940	1430180	Um, I started playing Orna.
1430180	1431820	Kind of bored.
1431820	1434260	That was like, that was like me, sorry, really quickly.
1434260	1439540	That was me when I uninstalled Diablo three, it was like, Oh my God, it's like this sudden
1439540	1441680	freedom I was feeling.
1441680	1444720	I'm trying Orna out and it's, it's okay.
1444720	1447720	I am not having a burden knuckle.
1447720	1451780	You need to get, you need to join his that's party cause then she just plays and it power
1451780	1453920	levels you to like 80 in a minute.
1453920	1457620	Well, I'm already like 60 so wow.
1457620	1458620	That's way further than I got.
1458620	1459620	Good for you.
1459620	1462120	I got to like a level 10, something like that.
1462120	1463120	Okay.
1463120	1466760	Um, cause I wanted, I wanted a sorceress or witch.
1466760	1467760	I got to witch.
1467760	1469920	I'm next up a sorceress, but I have to earn more Orna.
1469920	1470920	Okay.
1471160	1475400	But, um, I'm still doing Pokemon go, I'm still doing the Harry Potter game, but I am no longer
1475400	1479600	ever going to spend any money on the Harry Potter game again because I am not going to
1479600	1481320	give my money to a turf.
1481320	1483540	Um, does she get money from that?
1483540	1486200	She gets money from everything with her licenses on it.
1486200	1491100	I liked your idea of taking it back and just giving it to the fans, the fans, but still
1491100	1492560	financial support.
1492560	1494160	I don't feel right doing it.
1494160	1498800	I'm not going to contribute any money to a franchise that supports a turf.
1498800	1499800	Yeah.
1499800	1503680	It's unfortunate that she, um, opened her big mouth to say that.
1503680	1505480	And also Ricky Gervais him as well.
1505480	1508320	I already knew he was garbage, but now he's even hotter garbage.
1508320	1509320	Did you see that thing?
1509320	1511880	And again, I'm not, I don't want to sound like I'm justifying those comments at all
1511880	1515000	cause I'm not, but I thought this was an interesting perspective.
1515000	1522620	I saw an article that tried to talk about like British culture and how that might have
1522620	1526120	an impact on it and some of the things that are going on in Britain.
1526120	1534680	Yeah, but we also have Boris Johnson and the people that support that garbage.
1534680	1536720	It's the same thing that's happening over here.
1536720	1541400	So anyway, uh, pistol pockets and chat says me says nothing.
1541400	1543480	JK Rowling says some goddamn bullshit.
1543480	1544480	Yeah.
1544480	1545480	That's pretty much what it felt like.
1545480	1547400	Uh, Bobby Lockwell says, LOL.
1547400	1548760	We're still playing Orna here.
1548760	1549760	Okay.
1549760	1552840	So I mentioned this game just like quickly in passing and then like all of you picked
1552840	1555080	it up and started playing it, which is interesting to me.
1555080	1556080	What's Orna.
1556120	1557120	Orna is okay.
1557120	1559200	So I went on like a GPS game binge.
1559200	1561600	So one of our listeners lives here.
1561600	1562600	It's her nuts.
1562600	1563600	Okay.
1563600	1564600	So the nut lady.
1564600	1565600	Okay.
1565600	1573280	Um, she, uh, showed this game to me, this Orna, which it uses GPS, but, um, Oh, that's
1573280	1574280	the RPG one.
1574280	1575280	You're right.
1575280	1576280	It's like an RPG.
1576280	1579920	It uses like classic eight bit graphic looking things, but it's on like a, and I just realized
1579920	1582200	I can't really show the camera cause it might show where I live.
1582200	1583200	Oops.
1583200	1585960	It has a lovely piano soundtrack.
1585960	1590200	Um, but, uh, yeah, you can see how there's like little things.
1590200	1591200	Yeah.
1591200	1592200	That's right.
1592200	1595400	Remember you showed that it's like a, it's like a classic RPG, but the, the stores and
1595400	1598120	stuff are out in the real world.
1598120	1603120	So for example, I was complaining that there wasn't a store near my house or whatever.
1603120	1609520	So as that she came by here, she built a store out front cause I guess she could do that
1609520	1610920	at a certain level.
1610920	1613160	So now I have a store right here on my house.
1613160	1614160	Yeah.
1614160	1615160	Which is great.
1615160	1619140	So, uh, luckily there's a lot of stores, so I'm not like giving away my address or anything
1619140	1624020	and it's like, you can, I'll tell you, there's a, there's a place that you can go to where
1624020	1626440	there's like 20 stores like all of that.
1626440	1630360	And I'm like, you can just guess that an Orna player lives there.
1630360	1631360	So there you go.
1631360	1635760	Um, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, we love it because there's no ads and we can just
1635760	1637500	play it while sitting in our house.
1637500	1640080	We, we built a store in my front yard.
1640200	1644240	Uh, Bobby says I'm level 82 and my life wife is level 84.
1644240	1645240	Wow.
1645240	1647000	I may have to pick that up and try it.
1647000	1648000	Yeah.
1648000	1652140	I didn't, I got to admit, I'm not like super into it cause I just don't think the GPS stuff
1652140	1659720	is that, um, engrossing, but it is a nice little like, thank you, dark sucker.
1659720	1665880	It is a nice little like mindless, like, Oh, I'm just gonna, you know, sit on the toilet
1665880	1672280	and you know, tap kill, kill, die, die, die, and you know, all the, um, uh, slimes and
1672280	1674400	goblins and orcs and things that are on the house.
1674400	1676960	So there you go.
1676960	1679120	So that was pretty much it for my gaming week.
1679120	1682320	Um, so dark soccer, did we get everything for your gaming week?
1682320	1683800	You talked about, okay, so we're good.
1683800	1687000	So let's move on and get into some gaming news.
1687000	1689580	And I want to at least try one of these latkes here.
1689580	1691160	The dark soccer has made.
1691160	1695320	So Loki, while I jump into food here, tell us about our first story tonight.
1695320	1700640	So, uh, Borderlands three is coming or is out on Stadia.
1700640	1705520	And one of the things with Stadia, the advantage to that platform is supposed to be, Hey, you
1705520	1709440	know what, you can just get into your game and play it and you don't have to worry about
1709440	1711000	downloading updates.
1711000	1716080	It's just as updated as it could possibly be, except that it's not.
1716080	1722020	So what happened was is the Stadia version, um, that's out currently is the one that they
1722020	1727220	released the version that came out October 24th, um, which is when they had like their
1727220	1729820	Halloween themed bloody harvest event.
1729820	1735620	So apparently there's several, uh, hot fixes and patches that have been added since then,
1735620	1741100	but those aren't available right now through, uh, Stadia and they're saying they're expecting,
1741100	1744620	for example, like Moxie's heist of handsome jackpot.
1744620	1749420	Um, that's supposed to be expected on Stadia early 2020.
1749420	1755040	So it's, it's like, yeah, it, you, it will download the updates for free or add the updates,
1755040	1761420	but there's going to be a delay between the PC version or the console version and Stadia,
1761420	1768820	which I mean, it really doesn't need any more reasons not to purchase games through there.
1768820	1772380	Considering that, like, I don't even know what the cost is for this game right now through
1772380	1776140	Stadia, but all I can tell you right now is it's marked down everywhere else because of
1776140	1777780	the holidays and sales.
1777780	1784500	So like maybe I should have just purchased it elsewhere.
1784500	1791580	This is just another like yikes thing in Stadia's column to me when Google Stadia doesn't seem
1791580	1795780	to have a lot of real positive steam going its direction when we talk about a lot of
1795780	1801620	the buzz online, that's not to say the internet makes up the majority of, you know, what actually
1801620	1804240	sells out there and that sort of thing.
1804240	1808780	Because like, for example, I think Bobby was talking about on his show, he had a friend
1808780	1813560	or a coworker or something that's like all about Stadia because, you know, if it, it's
1813560	1817800	one of those things where like, if it uniquely works for your situation, then it really works
1817800	1818880	for your situation.
1818880	1819880	You know what I mean?
1819880	1820880	Yeah, I get it.
1820880	1825160	But like, I'm curious to see what their numbers are and the fact that those numbers haven't
1825160	1830420	been like thrown out there like, oh yeah, it's great, tells me it's not great.
1830420	1835940	So I will have to wait and see when the next Google conference is going to be when they'll
1835940	1841180	talk about Stadia numbers, if they talk about Stadia numbers and what's coming towards that
1841180	1843060	you know, that platform or whatever.
1843060	1847420	But they're gonna have to do a lot more to it just to get people's buy-in on that.
1847420	1855160	Because right now it's just kind of, eh, I don't know, they like, just if you can't afford
1855160	1860380	to like game on those consoles right now, I mean, we're talking about like this generation
1860380	1862460	and we're getting into a new generation of consoles.
1862460	1866340	I mean, you can always purchase the last generation of consoles and there's a lot of games out
1866340	1869460	there that are going to be marked down or much cheaper.
1869460	1875100	I mean, I don't know that you really necessarily need to, I wouldn't necessarily want to dump
1875100	1878800	money into a platform that I don't know is going to be around, especially if a digital
1878800	1883180	platform that if it goes under, then you're kind of stuck.
1883180	1890220	Whereas, you know, if my PlayStation 4, if for some reason Sony's PlayStation network
1890220	1894660	infrastructure went down, I could probably still play my games through my console, even
1894660	1896260	though they'd be offline.
1896260	1897340	So I don't know.
1897340	1900580	I think it's not very promising.
1900580	1903300	Yeah, I will.
1903300	1904300	Yeah.
1904300	1907500	If they were to put out some big numbers, I think you're right, then we'd know that
1907500	1909020	like it's doing really, really well.
1909020	1914500	But to be fair to Google, this whole thing that they were releasing was supposed to be
1914500	1916420	like an early access thing.
1916420	1921700	And yeah, you know, the console or whatever, my quotey fingers, the console is supposed
1921700	1923740	to be free, right?
1923740	1933740	So when we actually see the version of this that is playable for free, we'll see what
1933740	1934740	it looks like.
1934740	1937740	The adoption rate looks like then, like how many people are actually paying some money
1937740	1941860	to be able to play these games in their browsers and so forth that almost curious to remember
1941860	1945820	how they were saying like to get the most out of the stadia stuff as far as like this,
1945820	1949740	you know, they're talking about their controller and how it's Wi-Fi and how it, you know, that's
1949740	1952180	going to have the least amount of latency available.
1952180	1955500	I'd be curious to see like the comparison between that and other controllers, too, because
1955500	1959020	I think that's that's a bunch of hot bullshit right there.
1959020	1963300	What they're trying to say, you know, oh, by your one hundred nine dollar controller.
1963300	1966500	I don't buy that for one minute, but.
1966700	1972740	I don't know, I'm just very curious to why someone would want to purchase games through
1972740	1978340	stadia versus like actually buying a console aside from, you know, saving the two hundred
1978340	1984180	three hundred dollars on a next gen or on a console or if they're thinking, oh, well,
1984180	1989300	I'm going to avoid, you know, buying, you know, a high end PC or console next generation.
1989300	1991140	I'm just going to download games through stadia.
1991940	1993060	I don't know, like I.
1994260	1999620	I don't know if that's going to be really big advantage as far as being able to save
1999620	2004420	money, the portability I can see if I traveled more for work, I travel a little bit for work,
2004420	2008580	but not enough, but if I traveled maybe a little bit more than I do, I could see, you
2008580	2012940	know, oh, if all I need to pack is a tablet and a little controller and then I can play
2012940	2016780	Google stadia stuff like that's what makes a switch awfully convenient for traveling.
2016780	2020020	Right. The switch is, you know, it's it's got that portability to it.
2020100	2021860	You know, you can easily pack it away or whatever.
2021860	2023860	And then when I'm at home, I can play it on the big TV.
2023860	2027620	I could see an argument like that being made for stadia is that like, you know, if you
2027620	2031540	are on the road a lot and maybe you don't have a living room in the traditional sense
2031540	2036020	that you're in most of your time, then maybe a tablet and a controller would go a long
2036020	2039460	way in being able to stay current on the latest and greatest in gaming.
2039460	2045860	Yeah, but I can't imagine, though, that that subset of people that play games is that huge.
2045860	2050900	Like it's like, well, this is good if you don't if you you don't this, this, this, this,
2050900	2052420	this and this, this, this.
2052420	2059060	It's like it's such a narrow scope for stadia that I just don't see it ever doing.
2059060	2064340	Even if it was most successful with that narrow scope, I don't see it is performing as
2064340	2065860	well as like other consoles.
2065860	2069620	Like I just I'm very skeptical to see where this is going to go.
2069620	2076820	And I just feel that it's it's a nice idea, but I think it's way too early for it to be
2076820	2077460	implemented.
2077460	2082420	I don't think our Internet structure infrastructure is what it needs to be to implement this
2082420	2082900	correctly.
2082900	2087940	If it was just like no bandwidth caps whatsoever and like everything's super fast, you know,
2087940	2091780	all the time, like I could take my phone and I have no trouble whatsoever streaming content
2091780	2098180	to it like really 4K content to my phone no matter where I am, like over the air, whatever
2098180	2100020	in this perfect world that we exist.
2100020	2103540	Then, yes, that would sound pretty cool, but we don't live in that world yet.
2103540	2106100	But, you know, we're talking about stories of the decade and so forth.
2106100	2112100	You know, I would I would guarantee by 2029, we're going to have Internet as fast as cable
2112100	2116180	now over the air because that stuff is coming, you know, and I see that comment in chat from
2116180	2119700	She-Hulk 10, who in chat says Internet at most hotels is terrible.
2119700	2120340	True.
2120340	2123860	So it probably, you know, lends a little strike against that story I proposed.
2123860	2127860	But and this is another maybe thing in the column of well, maybe stadia is just a little
2127860	2132660	bit early because, again, 10 years from now or I would gather sooner than that.
2132660	2137940	But, you know, certainly in 10 years from now, 5G or maybe even whatever is after 5G
2137940	2141460	is going to be even more out there and around and so forth.
2141460	2145540	And so it's not going to matter if the Internet connection to your hotel is shit because you're
2145540	2150180	going to have a great Internet connection through the magic of the air and so forth.
2151140	2153780	I mean, yeah, I hope that's what ends up being at some point.
2153940	2158340	But I don't have my 5G now, so I can't really say.
2158340	2159220	Yeah, I know it's hard.
2159220	2163380	It's hard to see with Verizon talking about like, hey, 5G, 5G is the future.
2163380	2166500	I'm like, is it outside of the middle of Sacramento?
2167460	2168660	No, really.
2168660	2170500	Only one kind of 5G I care about.
2170500	2171940	And that's 5G is in my pocket.
2172740	2174020	And let's be real.
2174020	2177300	And I know you guys I already know the sour face that many of you are going to make when
2177300	2177700	I say it.
2177700	2179140	But it is the absolute truth.
2179700	2182900	5G doesn't matter until the Apple phone comes out that supports 5G.
2182900	2185540	Well, and also 5G doesn't matter because it doesn't work very well through walls.
2185540	2187940	And apparently it only works well if you're staying in the middle of the street.
2187940	2189700	So so there's still a lot of kinks.
2189700	2190740	There's a lot of kinks to work out.
2190740	2191220	Yeah.
2191220	2192340	So anyway.
2193140	2193380	Yeah.
2193380	2196900	Bobby Black Wolf says this sounds like what a lot of people were saying about steam in
2196900	2198020	2003.
2198020	2201700	I don't want to download DVD sized games on my 56 K modem.
2201700	2202020	Yeah.
2202020	2208180	Take this clip and put it in the time capsule and we'll play it on episode 1500 in 2029.
2208180	2214260	And we'll see how far the Internet's come.
2214260	2216020	What do you mean your show's not holographic?
2216020	2216900	What the hell is this?
2219620	2220100	All right.
2220100	2226180	Anyway, let's move on and talk about speaking of like consoles and new consoles.
2226180	2229860	There's a Nintendo Switch inspired console.
2229860	2234660	And by inspired, I mean it's kind of a rip off allegedly.
2234660	2236980	Like I'm not supposed to say it's a rip off.
2236980	2237940	It is a rip off.
2238420	2239540	The views and opinions expressed.
2240100	2244340	But let's just say it looks like a Switch and the logo looks a lot like a Switch.
2244340	2247380	It's kind of surprising that Nintendo hasn't shut this shit down.
2248340	2250820	Thanks to you guys on Discord for bringing this to my attention.
2250820	2254900	And if you want to join our Discord, just go to vognetwork.com.
2254900	2257140	VOGnetwork.com slash Discord.
2257140	2262740	And you can share stories for consideration on the show when it talks about these clone
2262740	2264420	systems that tend to come out.
2264420	2267620	Yeah, we get systems that look like things, but they aren't really things.
2267620	2270580	So now there is a Nannika Smich.
2272820	2276500	That sounds like a Simpsons parody of some sort, doesn't it?
2276500	2277620	I just need to go Nannika.
2278260	2278980	What's that?
2278980	2279780	The Nyan Cat.
2279780	2280820	That's what that means.
2280820	2281460	Oh.
2281460	2282100	Nannika?
2282100	2282580	Like what?
2284260	2285300	The Nyan Cat.
2286180	2288260	So it's what Smich?
2289460	2290180	Like what bitch?
2293140	2294340	That's what this console is.
2294340	2295380	What bitch?
2295380	2295880	What?
2298260	2302340	It and it has a blue controller on one side and a red like the other and they look like
2302340	2303300	they disconnect.
2303300	2303860	They do.
2303860	2307940	Anyway, also there's a flying Mario on the front of the box.
2308660	2313220	So this is very clearly just boldly infringing on copyright.
2313220	2318100	And apparently, if you actually hook this thing up, it's just downloaded and ripped
2318100	2319380	ROMs as well.
2319380	2319700	Right.
2319700	2322740	So they actually have a little bit more details on some of the other sites here.
2322740	2325380	So I was like, where are they finding?
2325380	2326900	Are they finding this thing at flea markets?
2327300	2328340	I don't know.
2328340	2331540	But here they have like actual gameplay video of it and stuff.
2331540	2332020	Probably wish.
2332580	2334980	So like here's the description on the actual box.
2334980	2337540	So it says, you know, easy to use.
2337540	2344180	Connect the RCA cables to TV and power cable to the power or play portable mode.
2344180	2346500	And it says 800 games installed.
2346500	2353460	Mario Brews Bomberman against Double Dragon Adventure Island and many more.
2354340	2357380	Um, it is got a five and a half inch screen.
2358100	2359460	And, uh, yeah.
2359460	2363300	So basically pixel pakas with the throwback in our chat.
2363300	2365220	They're finding it on Soulja Boy store.
2367540	2367940	Good one.
2368500	2368980	Not yet.
2368980	2370500	Probably that's coming soon.
2370500	2371060	Yeah.
2371060	2375220	Uh, but no, basically it's like one of those, uh, emulators.
2375220	2378420	It's got their have gameplay of looks like they're playing like Pac-Man.
2378420	2383540	It looks like it's one of those multi, uh, ROM carts or whatever that's inside there.
2384100	2387620	So, but I'm saying this isn't exactly the thing you're going to find on a shelf at target.
2387620	2388900	Like, no, no.
2388900	2394100	God, this is clearly, this is like one of those small kiosks that sell this shady shit.
2394100	2396180	This was probably about four years ago.
2396180	2398740	I went to the flea market, right?
2398740	2400260	The huge one out in Roseville.
2400260	2405700	And I swear, like I saw at least six different boosts there that were selling.
2405700	2409540	Like it was a Nintendo 64 controller looking thing, but it plugged into your TV.
2409540	2411860	And it was, they were just straight up playing Super Mario Brothers on it.
2413300	2416580	I bought one of those for my friends one time for Christmas.
2416580	2418740	If you want to see reviews on a lot of this though,
2418740	2421860	one of my favorite channels on YouTube right now is Retro Core.
2421860	2426500	He does the battle of the ports, um, which is sometimes where I get ideas for classic game.
2426500	2431860	But, um, he also does like the, the, um, Chinese bootleg device reviews.
2431860	2432660	Like the V?
2432660	2434580	And they send, they send him some.
2436420	2436920	Weird.
2437460	2439940	But, and he's very honest about it.
2439940	2444740	He'll like, if it's a handheld that maybe connects to a TV, like has a TV tuner on it,
2444740	2448820	he'll, um, do both versions before doing it through a capture card.
2448820	2451220	And some of them are good.
2451220	2457620	You know, I still probably wouldn't buy one, but I like actually seeing the reviews of them
2457620	2463140	to see just how far the little bootleggers have come in their emulation.
2463140	2468180	So if I'm, if I'm hearing this right, this thing actually does still have the switch
2468180	2470500	concept of you can play the ROMs on the little screen
2470500	2472660	or you can plug it in and it goes on the TV, right?
2472660	2473460	I believe so.
2473460	2475780	I think, I don't know if he necessarily can, like,
2477300	2479620	like put in a dock and it goes to the screen.
2479620	2485140	I think it's more of you can hook up like, well, you can hook up AV cables to it and it goes into
2485140	2485460	a screen.
2485460	2488660	Oh, if there's something plugged in the, because yeah, they said that there's RCA.
2489380	2489880	Okay.
2491140	2492500	Not as fancy as a dock.
2493620	2494340	I see.
2494340	2496580	I mean, maybe the controllers are wireless.
2496580	2502820	Um, I mean, assume because it says four, four triple A batteries for the controllers.
2502820	2507140	Well, they call it say controls rechargeable battery for the screen and strap and power
2507140	2508980	cable in AVC.
2508980	2511060	So it doesn't really power very well either.
2511060	2514500	Uh, darted C and chat with a zinger saying, uh, but look at it this way.
2514500	2518420	It might have more games than Nintendo switches, online service, but I'm bummed.
2519540	2520580	You can definitely play more.
2520820	2524500	Accuracy, the truth, the T, uh, orange, right?
2524500	2526820	Says judging by most of these, it's probably 20 games.
2526820	2529220	And then it's just the games repeated over and over again.
2529220	2529940	That's what happens.
2529940	2534980	A lot of these bootleg things is that it'll be like Mario, but Mario is a different color
2534980	2537620	or Mario, but the Goomba is a penis.
2537620	2539860	And somehow it snuck its way into this collection.
2540420	2545060	So it's almost worth it if they had all those shitty bootleg ROMs in there.
2545780	2549780	Did I ever tell you about the very first ROM hack I ever saw on the internet way back in
2549780	2550180	college?
2550740	2554980	So there was this Japanese only title that they never released or they never released
2554980	2556020	it here at dark soccer.
2556020	2556660	You probably know this one.
2556660	2558100	It was an NES launch title.
2558100	2559860	It was called nuts and milk.
2559860	2560340	Yeah.
2560340	2564580	Well, I'll let you imagine what they changed it to in Japan.
2564580	2568580	That game nuts and milk were two cute little characters that, yeah.
2568580	2569700	When they did the ROM hack.
2571060	2571560	Yeah.
2572260	2573460	Was it butts and milk?
2573460	2575620	No, it was nuts.
2576340	2580900	It was nuts in vag.
2581700	2584020	Anyway, let's move on.
2584020	2587940	Let's we need some Christmas cheer here and some Hanukkah spirit.
2587940	2592420	So how and some Kwanzaa, uh, I'm trying to think.
2592420	2592660	Joy.
2592660	2593700	It's joy Kwanzaa.
2593700	2593940	Okay.
2593940	2597460	Kwanzaa joy and some solstice slumber.
2597460	2598420	Cause I need a nap.
2598420	2600340	Solstice serenity.
2600340	2601300	Ah, I like that.
2601300	2601460	Okay.
2601460	2602260	So we need all of it.
2602260	2604020	The shortest day is the longest night.
2604660	2606420	We need all of it.
2606420	2608500	And by the way, review.
2608500	2610180	Oh, the lockers are fabulous.
2610180	2610580	Yeah.
2610580	2614260	This is the first year I've actually added stuff to the box mix.
2614260	2614740	Yeah.
2614740	2617140	The straights box mix is better than the Manischewitz.
2617140	2618020	I'm going to say it now.
2618820	2622340	When you said cheesy, I was like, Ooh, I don't know if I'm ready for all that cheese,
2622340	2624820	but it's not like they're good.
2624820	2627060	It's not like waffle house hash browns or cheese.
2627060	2629940	I picked cheese that wouldn't turn stringy melty.
2629940	2632980	It's a combination of Havarti and Manchego.
2632980	2634340	So they're potent cheeses.
2634340	2638180	You'll get the cheese flavor out of them without them being stringy and gooey.
2638180	2640580	And the sour cream is a cultured sour cream.
2640580	2643380	So it actually will be good for your tummy.
2643380	2644020	Well, that's good.
2644020	2647460	I'm not usually a big sour cream person, but this stuff is bomb though.
2647460	2648180	And it's thick.
2648980	2650420	Not bad for the grocery outlet.
2650420	2651380	Thick with five C's.
2655380	2658980	I was looking on AliExpress to see if they actually were selling it because that's
2658980	2663700	usually we can find this kind of crap, but no, no, no, I don't see it.
2663700	2663940	All right.
2663940	2668500	Well, meanwhile, in a festive chat, I'm going to maybe grab a couple more of these.
2668500	2671380	There's a few left and I made the whole box this time.
2671380	2674900	So, so how about something about Christmas?
2674900	2676660	God, I'm sick of Christmas music.
2676660	2680980	For the first time in three years, I have heard the Mariah apocalypse happen.
2680980	2684100	I wasn't participating in Wama Geddon because I actually fucking like that song,
2684100	2688340	but I fell prey to the, to the Mariah apocalypse three times in one day.
2688340	2692900	I heard a cover of it and that's even worse, but I actually liked the Wham song.
2692900	2696020	Anyway, there was an update to Death Stranding.
2696900	2704420	It was updated to version 1.08 for quote various performance improvements to the game,
2704420	2706100	but there's something else in there.
2706100	2710980	And this is what ties back to the mass of X is what I'm going to call it now,
2710980	2712340	because it makes it sound more sinister.
2713460	2714260	Christmas hats.
2714980	2721380	So basically, some of the members in the Bridges organization will,
2722340	2725380	will wear a Christmas hat, Santa hat.
2726660	2731860	Some of them weren't wearing them, but most of them were wearing the Santa hats.
2733140	2738580	Sam could already wear his as an unlock before this, but now it was like a weird
2738580	2744420	involved process and you had to, to rank up your connection and some other crap,
2744420	2747140	which me, I just, you know, watched the play through because
2747140	2748900	I didn't want to do the running around stuff.
2750820	2753540	But at any rate, it's a festive little update and
2756100	2758260	even the holograms are wearing Santa hats.
2758260	2759780	So good job.
2761220	2766500	I don't know why that they even bothered because it kind of ruined the game atmosphere.
2767300	2770260	And why can't we have blue ones to emulate Hanukkah Harry?
2771460	2773460	I'm just saying I remember the SNL sketch.
2774420	2774900	That's it.
2775780	2776500	All right.
2776500	2780740	I did get the patch, but I played a little bit of Death Stranding, but like,
2780740	2782660	I did like one quest in Death Stranding.
2782660	2787460	That was the most I played this week, but I did not notice a Santa upgrade
2787460	2788500	or whatever you want to call it.
2788500	2791540	So I must be talking to one of the guys that doesn't have one.
2791540	2793860	So they're not everywhere.
2793860	2795540	All right, moving on.
2795540	2797140	Is there Jeff Keighley in a Santa hat?
2797140	2798260	Is that something I don't know?
2798260	2802340	I have to run over to that checkpoint and look, because apparently the Jeff Keighley checkpoint,
2802340	2803940	it is one of the earlier ones in the game.
2803940	2806580	So you know which one annoyed the shit out of me though?
2806580	2809220	The Conan one, because you know who annoys the shit out of me?
2809220	2809860	Conan.
2809860	2811380	I haven't found him yet.
2811380	2813540	So pan, no, Otter hat.
2814180	2814660	That's it.
2814660	2815220	Otter hat.
2815220	2816100	That's all I'm gonna say.
2816100	2817940	All right, moving on.
2817940	2818440	Loki.
2819220	2824340	So there was a, this is talking about like news of the decade, but there was a prototype
2824340	2830820	of the PlayStation Super Nintendo crossover type thing that they were going to be.
2830820	2833940	Like the one that Ben Heck did the work on?
2833940	2834740	I believe so.
2834740	2838260	This is the Nintendo PlayStation, that prototype.
2838260	2845700	Well, they are now going to be auctioning it off for, I believe, charity.
2846820	2850660	So basically they said, I can't keep losing.
2850660	2852660	Oh, maybe not for charity.
2852660	2856260	So charity of paying my rent.
2857540	2862820	So the owner of the console right now, Terry Diebold, he apparently keeps losing money.
2863380	2868100	He says he put a lot of work into it by traveling with it and has made nothing on it.
2868100	2871860	Every trip that he's taken has cost money out of pocket.
2871860	2878900	He says the bills itself, he says that he's the world's largest collectibles auctioneer
2878900	2880420	or heritage, I guess is going to be.
2881380	2886500	So they're going to start selling, or start selling this, I guess, next year.
2886500	2890020	They have it already on auction, I believe, at least previewed.
2890020	2892820	And I don't know what he's looking to make for it.
2895140	2900340	But apparently the online auction will begin February 27th and will not have a reserve
2900340	2901140	price.
2901140	2907460	So dump as much money as you want into this thing that I don't believe plays anything.
2908260	2909860	And you can't play anything with it.
2909860	2917780	So really the only reason to have this is if you are one of those that has the biggest
2917780	2922900	collection of collections, or maybe a museum or something like that, or you're a tech
2922900	2925300	person that wants to take it apart and see if you can.
2925860	2927060	But again, there's no game.
2927060	2928660	There's no games like built into it or anything.
2928660	2930580	So you're just not going to get to play anything.
2930580	2934740	There was a BIOS disk and a couple of ROMs floating around.
2934740	2937540	And I watched the whole rebuild with Ben Heck.
2937540	2938900	It was actually pretty cool.
2938900	2940900	And he got things working on it.
2940900	2945140	So now they're out there public to burn off whatever game.
2945140	2946740	So I don't know.
2947460	2950340	I would not pay money for this, but I know that people would.
2952180	2956740	And active says you can only play Super Nintendo games if I recall correctly, probably.
2956740	2958660	But here's the other side of that.
2958660	2961700	Like if you buy a system like this, you shouldn't be playing anything on it.
2961700	2964660	Like you don't want to ruin it by actually using it to play games.
2964660	2965060	I know.
2965060	2966260	Doesn't that sound weird?
2966260	2970260	But the reality is, if it's the only one out there, like you don't want to do anything
2970260	2974180	that would you would you would put it in a box and just let it sit there.
2974180	2976580	You know who ought to outbid everybody and buy it?
2976580	2977220	Nintendo.
2979060	2983700	Wouldn't that be a gag if Nintendo bought it and just put it in their store in a glass
2983700	2984740	case or something?
2984740	2986180	Or why would you want to know?
2986180	2987060	Throw it away.
2987060	2988580	Put it in the incinerator.
2988580	2990660	That's that's what I would that's what I would.
2990660	2993940	What they're going to do is they're going to put it in a crate and it's going to end
2993940	2997220	up in the warehouse, just like at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark.
2997860	3001220	Bobby Bockel says this should be in a museum, not in a collector's basement.
3001220	3004820	I agree, but it's going to be up to a museum to pay that kind of money for it.
3004820	3005380	I just don't know.
3005380	3009220	Like what kind of like public museums would this fit in at?
3009220	3009620	I don't know.
3009620	3010100	It doesn't.
3010100	3017700	The official the O2 Moi, the official gaming museum or whatever the hell that there's a
3017700	3022180	call of fame, the official Hall of Fame of Games or some shit that there's another one
3022180	3022740	in New York.
3022740	3024180	The middle of fucking nowhere.
3024180	3027620	That one that inducts the five games every year into the video game Hall of Fame.
3027620	3028660	That's out in New York somewhere.
3028660	3029300	That's not New York.
3029300	3031220	I thought that was the one that was in the middle of fucking nowhere.
3032100	3034900	No, no different.
3035460	3037540	Oh, Bobby Bockel says the maid in Oakland.
3037540	3037940	That's right.
3037940	3039140	I've even been to that place.
3041700	3042340	But you know why?
3042340	3046420	When I went, there was a special event going on, so I didn't see what the place normally
3046420	3046900	looks like.
3046900	3049780	And honestly, I thought it was like a store type of thing.
3050340	3054020	But now that you say that, oh, yeah, that place is a museum usually when there's not
3054020	3055300	an event going on at it.
3055300	3058820	So and Bobby says the Computer Museum of America in Atlanta.
3059460	3063460	Yeah, Bobby brings up Frank Cifaldi's Preservation Society.
3063460	3065620	That's where my brain went too.
3065620	3070260	But they're going to need the money to compete with those basement investors.
3070260	3076420	So hopefully they've got a shadow donor willing to pony up the money to let it go there if
3076420	3077380	that's what's going to do that.
3077380	3078980	So be interesting.
3078980	3082420	So anyway, Orange Right says twist.
3082420	3083540	Sony buys it.
3083540	3085700	Pod culture suggests Jamie's vault.
3085700	3090740	Well, she would probably have to sell all of the pinball machines and then some.
3090740	3093380	And I don't know if they're willing to do that for a date.
3093380	3094500	I'll be honest.
3094500	3101860	I wouldn't be excited about having it, especially since I mean, it would be cool, but it would
3101860	3104420	be like that little pong machine that I picked up.
3104420	3105460	Yeah, older.
3105460	3108900	Well, it's not older than me, but it would just be sitting in my vault.
3108900	3110740	With no, nothing I can do with it.
3110740	3111060	Yeah.
3111060	3116260	And as much as we tease you about the vault, like you and Dan do, like you'll go in, you
3116260	3119780	know, well, the vaults kind of morphed a little bit because it was at your old house where
3119780	3121860	you actually have to break out the Saturn and play Christmas nights.
3121860	3122900	But that's the thing.
3122900	3125940	You guys will actually like go in there and be like, I want to play this.
3126500	3129860	And then it's like, you know, so you actually are like, it's like walking into your own
3129860	3132660	little used game store and pulling in what you want to play.
3132660	3134660	And I just have a bug to play this game this week.
3134660	3136020	It's not owning things to own.
3136020	3140020	Especially the reason why we have overdrives now so that we don't actually have to hunt
3140020	3145940	down where the fuck we put the cartridge or, you know, this memory card that has this thing
3145940	3151860	on it or like, well, and we can also play some of the super CD games because like for
3151860	3155940	the turbo graphics, because I don't have an arcade card and I don't have the CD unit
3155940	3157220	for my core graphics.
3157220	3159220	If I had a duo RX, then shoot.
3159220	3160180	Yeah, that'd be fine.
3160180	3163380	I don't know who out there would be willing to spend 200 bucks on me, but.
3164100	3164580	Hint, hint.
3165140	3169540	But I'm just at any rate, I mean, I've been trying to find the CD add on for the core
3169540	3175620	graphics, and I really haven't been able to because we so we just now I mean, that's why
3175620	3181140	we're looking forward to that a turbo graphics mini because we're on the preorder for it.
3181140	3181940	Oh, yeah, I forgot.
3181940	3182740	I preordered that.
3182740	3186020	And that's not even out till what, like March or something, something like that.
3186020	3187700	But yet another thing in March.
3187700	3192260	But it's going to have the the super graphics version of it.
3192260	3193860	Was it Daimakamura or Chomakamura?
3193860	3195940	No, Chomakamura was SNES.
3195940	3201300	So it's going to be Daimakamura as in ghosts and goblins.
3201300	3204500	I always get the mix around which one was first, ghouls and ghosts or ghosts and goblins.
3204500	3208180	So I just always call it by the Japanese name because it's easier for me to remember.
3209940	3214260	But you know, it's going to have some of the super graphics games on there.
3214260	3216020	But I mean, back in the long run, though.
3217540	3218580	It would be a nice thing.
3218580	3219220	I'll put it that way.
3219220	3222420	It would be nice to have that system.
3222420	3226420	It would be a little slice of unique gaming history that no one else has.
3227060	3228180	But that's all it is.
3228180	3231540	What good would something like that do in my closet?
3232820	3238100	When other people could be looking at it were, I mean, hell, I could if I had it,
3238100	3243940	I would probably have it reverse engineered and rebuilt, you know, and marketed or something,
3243940	3247460	or I mean, not really marketed, but like make them for other people.
3247460	3248260	That would be cool.
3248980	3251940	You know, have them, you know, do like the pachinko thing where you take your little
3251940	3254420	pachinko balls to the store next door and get your prize.
3254420	3255860	So I wouldn't actually be selling it.
3255860	3258100	I would just be getting prizes that I can trade for money.
3259300	3260020	I see.
3260020	3263220	If it's good enough for Japan is good enough for me.
3264740	3265240	All right.
3265940	3269060	Well, regardless, no one in this room will be picking up the Nintendo PlayStation,
3269060	3269620	that's for sure.
3269620	3272420	But it will be very interesting to see how that all plays out.
3272420	3278260	And if it does go to museum or the purchaser has chosen to keep their information private,
3278260	3279700	which sometimes happens.
3279700	3281540	So, but, you know, it's interesting, though.
3281540	3285860	Like, the reason why my mind keeps going to museums is that sometimes that rock and roll
3285860	3287300	paraphernalia gets sold.
3287300	3290340	You know who buys that stuff sometimes is Hard Rock Cafe.
3290340	3294260	And so they send them to Hard Rock hotels and cafes around.
3294260	3296020	I wouldn't want that to happen to it.
3296020	3298580	Well, at least you can kind of go see it.
3298580	3301620	Although, I told you about the Vegas story, right?
3302420	3304500	I was in Vegas when we went to go see the Gwen Stefani show.
3304500	3306180	So me and Miss Melody were in Vegas.
3306740	3310180	And we were trying to find the Jerry.
3310180	3313460	Her name is now Jerry Horner, but it was Jerry Halliwell.
3313460	3316580	We were trying to find her dress because her infamous British dress.
3316580	3321860	I saw it at that Vegas casino about during those years ago.
3321860	3324340	It was during the 25th anniversary of Rocky Horror Convention.
3324340	3325780	So I saw it there during then.
3325780	3327140	So we were looking around for it.
3327140	3329780	Well, as it turns out, it's no longer there.
3330500	3332020	They moved it out of that casino.
3332020	3332980	That's the thing that annoys me.
3332980	3337460	I was like, well, you know, if you're gonna have all this stuff, put it on display somewhere.
3337460	3341300	But we did get to see shoes that Britney Spears wore in the toxic video.
3341300	3342020	So that was cool.
3342580	3343080	Okay.
3344980	3347220	None of that type of thing.
3347220	3348900	Well, I like seeing the instruments.
3349540	3353220	Like seeing, you know, Lemmy's bass, for example.
3354260	3360180	Seeing, you know, just because especially when you look and see like finger marks and,
3360180	3362580	you know, grooves that were cut on, you know, different things.
3362580	3365060	That gives me a little bit more other than, oh, these are shoes.
3365060	3365460	Look.
3365460	3366900	Oh, my God, Britney's shoes.
3367540	3370820	Some people take a trip to the Holy Land because they want to see where
3370820	3373940	religious people in the past walked and did things.
3373940	3376740	If I want to go see Britney's shoes, that's my religion.
3376740	3377240	Okay.
3379140	3381140	That was, yeah, except yours isn't tax exempt.
3383620	3388180	Then again, you did hear about the Satanic Temple becoming federally recognized.
3388180	3389300	Oh, no, I have not.
3390100	3391700	I would have thought that already happened.
3391700	3395300	It's actually, it's like one particular aspect.
3395300	3399860	It's like they finally went for full recognition or something and got their tax exempt status.
3399860	3406100	And then now they say they voluntarily pay taxes because they're trying to,
3406740	3410980	I mean, honestly, they've been better quality humans than the Southern Baptist Convention.
3410980	3411700	And I'll leave it at that.
3412660	3414580	Do they still have that statue of Baphomet?
3414580	3415080	Yeah.
3416100	3418260	I always thought that was the most hilarious story.
3418260	3418820	I'm sorry.
3420100	3420600	Anyway.
3421060	3421460	All right.
3421460	3422100	Moving on.
3422900	3426660	Let's talk about, oh, let's talk about another type of religion for some people.
3426660	3428260	Fantasy Star Online.
3428260	3431860	Lord knows I've lost many, many hours to Fantasy Star.
3431860	3433220	Well, guess what?
3433220	3436980	You were going to have the chance soon to play Fantasy Star Online 2,
3436980	3441220	which granted, it did change some stuff from the original, but I still want to check it out.
3442180	3442680	Yes.
3443620	3445300	I could check it out.
3445300	3448740	I could, you know, do all that stuff with the patches and all that stuff.
3448740	3449620	I don't want to.
3449620	3451620	I want Sega to support it in America.
3451620	3454740	And finally, as we found out at E3, they're going to be.
3455380	3457540	And so there is a beta test coming out.
3457540	3461140	So there is right now a closed Xbox One beta test,
3461140	3463140	which is why Jamie's mad because she doesn't have an Xbox One,
3463940	3465940	that will be happening in early February.
3465940	3470580	You can sign up now through the Insider app on your Xbox One.
3470580	3474100	So if you are an Xbox Insider, which is like, I think,
3474100	3476980	I don't remember if you signed up on the website to download a special app,
3476980	3479780	or if you just have to download the app from the marketplace.
3479780	3482420	But I know it's called the Xbox Insider hub.
3482420	3483300	So look for that.
3483300	3487220	And that allows you to like, look at like, if you want to look at betas of hardware,
3487220	3490580	upgrade updates and things like that, you can get all that through the program too.
3490580	3493460	And then they have surveys and things that you can answer
3493460	3495140	and you get little points and you level up.
3495140	3495640	It's cute.
3497220	3498820	So anyway, I don't know about you guys,
3498820	3500980	but if you haven't turned on your Xbox One in a while,
3500980	3504980	you might want to do that so you can get on this stress test, if you will,
3504980	3506900	for Phantasy Star Online 2.
3506900	3509060	And again, that's going to be happening in February.
3509060	3510820	I don't know when this closes,
3512740	3514900	but I would get on that sooner rather than later.
3514900	3518340	Now, Dark Sakura, you won't be left out forever.
3518340	3521780	There will be a Windows 10 version that launches later in 2020.
3521780	3524340	Although I know you're at war with your PC right now,
3524340	3527060	but maybe later in 2020, that will resolve itself
3527060	3530420	by the time Phantasy Star Online 2 becomes available.
3530420	3532260	So excited.
3532260	3537060	I hope I get in and I hope there's not a lot of NDAs.
3537060	3538980	I hope we are able to live stream it.
3538980	3540180	But if we can't, we can't.
3540180	3544100	I just missed my mags that I had in the first PSO because I had my Oppa Oppa.
3544100	3546660	The Oppa Oppa was my favorite because I fucking love Phantasy Zone,
3546660	3548500	but I did also have a Sega Master System.
3549460	3553540	Well, you know, Mr. VG Realness, Delvin and myself,
3553540	3556100	we jumped into the wonderful world of pirate servers
3556100	3557460	from Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst
3557460	3559860	because we were streaming for a little bit and that was a lot of fun.
3559860	3562340	So I think it was called like Afinia or something like that.
3562340	3564420	I played PSO 2 for a long time though.
3564420	3567300	Just Google Phantasy Star Online private server
3567300	3568740	and it's the first result that comes up.
3568740	3574740	And there's still quite a few people that are rocking on that platform.
3574740	3576260	So it's very cool.
3576260	3577780	So, all right.
3578900	3581700	Dr. Su says that reminds me, did you all drop off of Blue Burst?
3583300	3586660	I'm not actively playing Blue Burst, but forever in my heart.
3586660	3589780	And honestly, if Delvin were to text me one day and be like,
3590340	3593060	yo, bitch, let's do a stream, I'd probably be down.
3593060	3595620	So, because I had a lot of fun doing those Blue Burst streams.
3595620	3596580	So I'd probably do it again.
3597700	3598180	All right.
3598980	3603380	Questbuster talking about PSO 2 saying the cosmetics in PSO 2 are pretty insane.
3603380	3607220	People were running around in so many tie-ins like Attack from Titan gear.
3607220	3609540	Well, PSO 2 was a free MMO.
3609540	3612260	So there are going to be a lot of commercial spots and things like that.
3612260	3614500	I don't think they're going to suddenly charge for it here.
3614500	3615380	It's really hard.
3615380	3621300	There's only essentially, I think like three premium MMOs left in the US.
3622180	3624020	That would be World of Warcraft, of course.
3624020	3627460	Final Fantasy XIV, I guess 11 as well.
3627460	3628420	I guess you could bundle into that.
3628420	3631220	But the other one that's coming to mind, isn't EverQuest still a monthly payer?
3631220	3633300	Or did they finally take EverQuest free to play?
3633300	3634500	I don't remember.
3634500	3636500	I don't know, but I have a friend who's playing EverQuest.
3636500	3639220	Like the, when they brought back the OG server.
3639220	3639860	Bobby would know.
3639860	3641460	I'm just waiting for the delay because he'll know.
3641460	3644100	Cause I know he was on the EverQuest bandwagon for a long time.
3644180	3646740	So I can't remember if they finally went for it.
3646740	3650900	I know EverQuest 2 didn't take off the way they hoped it would.
3650900	3658180	So, but yeah, having a premium like month to month pay MMO is a hard thing to do now
3658180	3659140	in this day and age.
3659140	3661780	Like they tried it with Star Wars.
3663860	3665940	I almost said, oh, sorry, Bobby.
3665940	3669700	Is EverQuest something you still pay a monthly fee for or did it finally go free to play?
3670420	3675220	Um, and what was the Star Wars MMO that I can't, I keep wanting to say The Force Awakens,
3675220	3676260	but no, that was the movie.
3676260	3678180	Um, what was the Star Wars MMO called?
3678180	3681220	The Metal Mayhem says, uh, God, I almost said ElfQuest.
3681860	3684020	EverQuest is free to play now.
3684020	3684340	Okay.
3684340	3686500	You know why I have ElfQuest on my mind?
3686500	3689540	I found my ElfQuest graphic novels from like the eighties.
3689540	3690180	Oh, that's funny.
3690180	3691140	I love ElfQuest.
3691140	3691380	Yeah.
3691940	3697540	So anyway, um, so yeah, that means like as far as premium MMOs go, there's only Final
3697620	3701860	Fantasies and World of Warcraft are still able to get away with charging a monthly fee.
3701860	3704500	That's really the older public, the older public.
3704500	3705140	Thank you.
3705140	3709460	The older public celebrated eight years this past night to the older public.
3709460	3710500	I had a friend that worked on that.
3711380	3712580	She used to call it Scrotor.
3714580	3717540	That's how I got into the, uh, uh, the Skywalker ranch.
3717540	3721460	But that was, that was a fun little Krista worked for Lucas arts.
3721460	3722180	Yeah.
3722180	3726180	But that was a fun little, uh, side adventure, you know, uh, game.
3726180	3728500	And it, you know, had a lot of the BioWare traits in it.
3728500	3733300	I love that you could play like a bad Jedi or a good Sith.
3733300	3734500	Like, I really loved that.
3734500	3736020	That was like an option that you could do.
3736020	3741300	I would just want to do full on grade Jedi or gray force user, whatever.
3742260	3746740	Uh, and Bobby is saying, okay, so it's free to play, but it has premium subs, but the
3746740	3748420	sub is daybreak all access.
3748420	3751940	So it's EverQuest, EverQuest 2, DC Universe online and Planetside 2.
3751940	3754100	So it's like all these MMOs in one basically.
3754100	3755540	So that's kind of interesting.
3755540	3758180	So, and, uh, Bobby's saying I enjoyed SWTOR.
3758180	3760740	The Jedi Knight storyline was KOTOR 3 to me.
3760740	3763060	Yeah, I've heard that feedback before too.
3763060	3763780	So anyway.
3764580	3764900	All right.
3764900	3767780	That World of MMOs, but Phantasy Star Online 2, that'll be a free one.
3767780	3768340	So that's good.
3769220	3769540	All right.
3769540	3770260	Moving on.
3770260	3775380	Uh, Dark Sakura, some more details on, uh, we have, we're having a Microsoft Knight tonight
3775380	3775780	apparently.
3775780	3778340	I guess so, but this one actually makes me really happy.
3778340	3780740	I love to see people doing things right.
3780740	3788260	So, um, Microsoft has announced a, uh, their lead character in Tell Me Why is going to
3788260	3790340	be trans, transgender.
3790340	3797540	The main character is a man named Tyler Ronan, um, who is, I guess, I mean, it doesn't say
3797540	3800100	anything about, you know, where he is on his thing.
3800100	3801860	And that would be, of course, be a personal decision.
3801860	3805700	It's not something that should matter about the character, just that he is a transgender
3805700	3806200	man.
3806920	3814840	And, um, one of the quotes from Liam, uh, who is, uh, the game director for Liam is
3814840	3817800	that, um, the goal is not to have an agenda.
3817800	3822200	We develop characters and stories because we believe in their value and in giving experience
3822200	3822760	to players.
3823640	3828120	Um, and then later on saying that Tyler is a young man with great values, good and bad
3828120	3830200	elements, and that's what makes him human.
3830840	3838520	And I really, I really like, um, that they put a lot of, uh, um, attention into the voice
3838520	3845640	actor to find someone who would sound authentic, um, and into making it just what I'm thinking
3845640	3846280	of.
3846280	3851080	I hate to phrase it this way because honestly, this is what I wish any sexual orientation,
3851080	3854760	any gender, anything like that would be is that it's just a thing.
3855400	3856440	It's a normal thing.
3856440	3862120	It doesn't need to be made special light of because it's an intrinsic part of this person.
3862120	3864680	It's special because it belongs to this character.
3864680	3867080	It's special because the person is special.
3867080	3871880	And I'm not saying ignore somebody's experiences, but at the same time, I would just like it
3871880	3875000	to be, oh, like, oh, you, you have brown hair.
3875000	3875720	Oh, you're gay.
3876280	3879880	Oh, you're, you're a trans woman, you know?
3880520	3885560	And so I hope that they take that approach in the game instead of making it.
3885560	3889640	I want to see the struggles highlighted, but at the same time, I'd also like it to be
3889640	3891320	that normal part of who that person is.
3892760	3897880	And I'm, I'm going to just say this because, you know, there's people out there that are
3897880	3900600	going to pose this question, why does it matter?
3900600	3904840	And I'm not saying I'm asking that question, but I want to just entertain that because,
3904840	3908040	you know, there's going to be people out there that are going to say, why does it matter?
3908040	3912760	Why does it matter that, why do, why, why do we have this trans agenda shoved in our
3913000	3913400	face?
3913400	3916680	Because I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but you know it, there's, it's out there on the Twitter's
3916680	3917400	ease and that stuff.
3917960	3924760	So, but in my, my kind of opinion, the fact that that would be out there is kind of exactly
3924760	3926680	why there needs to be something like this.
3926680	3929720	It's kind of like one of those, well, if that's the question you have, play the game.
3929720	3930280	Exactly.
3930280	3936760	And the way I feel about it now is, and now keep in mind this normalization, that's going
3936760	3937320	to be down the line.
3937320	3937880	That's not now.
3937880	3940520	Representation now absolutely matters.
3940520	3944680	It is something that needs to be brought attention to, but I don't want it to be treated
3944680	3949080	as in this is this only, this only reason to right to exist.
3949080	3954440	I want it to be a fully realized person who happens to be trans and that his experience
3954440	3957400	as a trans man plays into who he is as a person.
3957400	3961560	Not necessarily just I'm going through everything that all trans people in the universe are
3961560	3961880	going through.
3961880	3963640	No, his experience is going to be different.
3963640	3965560	My, my friend's experiences are different.
3965560	3968760	Everybody's experience is different and I want it to be kind of like that.
3968760	3972280	The representation though abso-fucking-lutely matters.
3973000	3979320	And I think to add to that point as well, you know, when there was a trans character
3979320	3985960	in Mass Effect Andromeda, that character took a lot of criticism because it didn't act like
3985960	3989000	a trans person or that I was the trench.
3989000	3989500	Okay.
3991080	3994920	The trans woman did not act like a trans dead named herself.
3994920	3995880	Exactly.
3995880	4000920	And that's like, no, like if you ever meet a trans person, they're not going to say,
4000920	4001480	what was the line?
4001480	4003960	I'm trying to think of the line that she said, but she said like something.
4003960	4006360	When I registered, it was, is the name blah.
4006360	4006920	Yeah, exactly.
4006920	4007400	Something like that.
4007400	4012360	And it's like, okay, no trans person would actually say that within 60 seconds of meeting
4012360	4012760	you.
4012760	4015720	That is not like no one's fucking business.
4015720	4015960	Yeah.
4015960	4021720	Most trans people would probably, at least any that I I've known, like only if I knew
4021720	4024040	them before they transition, do I know.
4025000	4025560	Yeah.
4025960	4027960	You know, those details.
4027960	4029480	Otherwise it's not my business.
4029480	4030120	You know what I mean?
4030120	4034920	Well, and it's what, what I do for myself whenever I have a friend transitions.
4034920	4040040	And actually I have a few friends now that I do not remember their names beforehand because
4040040	4045640	I give myself a year, I change their contact card on my phone and then I put a parenthesis
4045640	4051160	with the first initial of their dead name to give myself six months so that the name
4051160	4052680	is fully associated with them.
4052680	4057800	Then I remove the initial and in a lot of cases I even have to sit and think about what
4057800	4058920	was their dead name.
4058920	4062600	And I don't do that because that's disrespectful to the journey they're going through.
4062600	4065640	Yes, that name, that person is a part of who they are.
4066280	4069560	Forgetting it erases a part of who they were, their experiences.
4069560	4076040	But at the same time, no trans person out there is going to say, Oh, well, you know,
4076040	4078440	I was Julia before and now I'm Jack.
4079320	4080520	They're not going to do that.
4080520	4082280	They're just going to say, Hey, I'm Jack, what's up?
4083160	4085800	That's all it's going to be because that is who they are now.
4085800	4087400	You don't need to know who they were.
4087400	4089720	You need to appreciate the person that who they were made.
4090360	4092040	So anyway, sorry.
4092040	4093400	No, no, it's important.
4093400	4096200	And I think brings insight to the question, why does it matter?
4096200	4099400	Because, you know, you know, that's what's on social media right now.
4099400	4104200	And I know we shouldn't have to go down that road, but I had to because somebody out there
4104200	4105080	might be wondering.
4105080	4110360	Is that said that Mattel came out with trans dolls and I'm just going through my brain
4110360	4111880	trying to figure out how that works.
4113320	4119720	Like, because, I mean, I know that trans people are more than their genitals, but the
4119720	4124840	dolls have no representation like that other than maybe having boobs or, you know, being
4124840	4127000	built in a particular way.
4127560	4130840	So I don't know how that would happen unless it's just like in their back story.
4130840	4133160	Dolls don't have genitals or that sort of thing.
4133160	4137160	I mean, everybody's undressed a Barbie in a can back in the day and you found nothing.
4137160	4143240	So now this is what I'm wondering is how they would represent trans characters in a
4143240	4143740	Barbie doll.
4144760	4147400	If there's something different about the body mold or something.
4147400	4148280	I have to look that up.
4148280	4149640	That's actually very fascinating.
4149640	4150200	All right.
4150200	4152920	Well, in the meantime, we aren't a doll podcast.
4152920	4153800	We're a video game podcast.
4153800	4154440	We're gonna move on.
4154440	4154940	Thank God.
4156600	4157720	I'm at the wrong show.
4158360	4161160	Well, dolls could include Legos as like an extension.
4161160	4161960	That's not a doll.
4162760	4166840	Sia Tabiri says they may have been gender neutral with options to dress up as more
4166840	4168120	male or more female.
4168120	4168600	Okay.
4168600	4169080	With wit.
4169080	4169320	Yeah.
4169320	4169560	Okay.
4169560	4171400	I did actually, I think I did see that.
4171400	4172440	And so that makes sense to me.
4173320	4174120	Okay, cool.
4174120	4174840	All right.
4174840	4179160	Anyhow, let's move on and talk about, uh, we'll talk, we'll talk about while we talk
4179160	4180280	about cars.
4180280	4180680	Yeah.
4180680	4181640	We'll talk about cars.
4181640	4182200	Loki.
4182200	4182360	Yeah.
4182360	4183800	Let's think about the manly games.
4183800	4185000	We could play our cars.
4185000	4186280	Like, let's talk about cars.
4186280	4187480	Like Stardew Valley.
4188920	4189420	Yeah.
4190520	4191000	Manly.
4191000	4192360	On my fucking Tesla.
4193080	4194680	Romancing farming.
4197800	4203560	But yes, apparently, apparently part of the, uh, holiday software update.
4203560	4206760	Tesla owners are getting a Stardew Valley port.
4208360	4213960	Not all, not all to hashtag, not all Tesla because, uh, they certain depends on what
4213960	4217960	your, what version of software or your car basically and what it can run.
4217960	4223320	Just like, you know, we were just talking about, um, iPads and when they, they, they
4223320	4225560	no longer will play the latest and greatest stuff.
4225560	4225960	Sorry.
4225960	4227800	Your car can't play Stardew Valley.
4227800	4232360	Bobby is pointing out that, uh, not on my Tesla, LOL early adopter.
4232360	4236040	Tesla's built after 2018, we'll get Stardew Valley.
4236040	4238520	So it has to be a, uh, a newer,
4238520	4239000	Darn.
4239000	4240120	I mean, or Tesla.
4240120	4243960	So the play that if you, you know, I remember when this game came out, but like.
4245000	4247320	But will the James Bond truck played this?
4248200	4251880	Probably, you know, but we always, you know.
4251880	4252200	Okay.
4252200	4258280	So I, some, I feel like in some ways this whole like games on a Tesla becomes this joke
4258280	4263320	of like Linux on a toaster, but which has happened, of course it's happened, but there
4263320	4267000	is some, like, there is like reasons why this exists.
4267000	4272600	Well, they also have a, with the full self-driving sneak preview is coming as well.
4272600	4275000	So you're gonna have to do something while your car is driving you somewhere.
4275960	4278280	Granted, we're not quite there yet.
4278280	4281720	I think we're, we're going to have cars driving themselves.
4282360	4284440	I mean, yeah, they do have some self-driving cars.
4284440	4287560	I just wouldn't trust it with the people, especially with the people I've been driving
4287560	4288120	around today.
4288680	4290120	I would not trust it.
4290120	4292120	Um, cause people be stupid.
4292120	4295000	So another, you trust your car, you don't trust other people's cars.
4295640	4296520	I correct.
4296520	4297020	Okay.
4298440	4300440	It's just, yeah, people are dumb.
4300440	4304840	Um, and Bobby, and this is of course very clear is that, and I didn't get to make this
4304840	4308680	point yet because we went on tangent, but, um, the games don't work when you're driving.
4308680	4311800	So you don't get to play Stardew Valley while you're driving, not even your passenger.
4311800	4313080	It doesn't work that way.
4313080	4313640	Okay.
4313640	4317560	But what it's for is, and in my mind, while you're super charging, you're super charging.
4317560	4318200	Exactly.
4318200	4320920	And you might think, well, doesn't that defeat the purpose of charging to be wearing down
4320920	4322120	the battery playing a game?
4322120	4323800	It's it's charging there.
4323800	4327560	It's charging a lot faster than you're using it of the little bit of power to play a game.
4327560	4332600	So, uh, and yeah, that's, that is a real thing about, you know, Tesla ownership or any type
4332600	4336600	of all electric vehicle really is that, you know, you're going to have to, the way you
4336600	4338440	fuel up is different.
4338440	4342760	You know, if you're taking a big trip and again, you know, cheap plug for our own YouTube
4342760	4348040	channel at VoG network, I don't pimp the YouTube very much, but here's a very real application
4348040	4353480	there because Bobby has a couple of road trip videos from his own Tesla experiences where
4353480	4358280	he kind of talks about how they stopped to supercharge at certain places while he's going
4358280	4362840	on these very long road trips, such as when he went from Atlanta to Washington, DC for
4362840	4364920	magfest is one video that comes to mind.
4364920	4368440	And he, you know, showed like how that path all worked and all that stuff.
4368440	4375000	So, um, you know, for now, that's why a lot of superchargers are at malls and big travel
4375000	4376920	stops and places with things to do.
4376920	4379880	So that way it's like, can get now stretching my legs.
4379880	4384920	It's not just like 20 minutes to, you know, fuel up, get a big gulp and go, you know,
4384920	4390200	you have to charge from sometimes for about what is about 45 minutes, depends on how many
4390200	4391320	miles you're trying to go.
4391320	4392920	So that's why these things are here.
4392920	4396200	But this gives you something to do to kind of pass the time.
4396200	4399240	If maybe like you get back to the car and you find, oh, there's still seven minutes
4399240	4399560	to go.
4400120	4404280	I'll just sit here and diddle daddle on a game while I wait for my car to top off.
4404280	4405800	And then I'm going to get back on the road.
4405800	4408120	It's a little bit, a little bit of a different way of thinking.
4408120	4413480	So anyway, um, Bobby says, oh, those videos took way too much work for the little amount
4413480	4414520	of views we were getting.
4414520	4416520	Bobby, that's why I pimped them right now.
4417160	4418680	Put them out there right now.
4418680	4424040	You should, you should put them on the Twitch channel, but like put them in the archive.
4424040	4431080	Why don't we take the whole blizzard approach of this and don't you guys have phones?
4431080	4434760	I mean, isn't that what cell phones are for?
4436680	4439240	Yeah, but have you ever, have you ever ridden into Tesla?
4440280	4442440	No, those, those screens are real nice.
4442840	4446600	Like I, the, the, with the first time Bobby Blackwolf picked me up at the airport, we
4446600	4447320	were going to dragon con.
4447320	4449720	I got to ride, actually, I don't think it was an airport trip the very first time.
4449720	4453080	I can't remember, but the very first time I was in his Tesla, I was like, this thing's
4453080	4454040	like a fucking spaceship.
4454040	4454920	This is cool.
4454920	4460360	Like it's like, there's a lot of stuff in there that's not in cars normally, but instead
4460360	4465080	it's like world's largest iPad is the whole like console type of thing.
4465080	4466360	And it was just, it was cool.
4466360	4469640	It was very different, but yeah, you kind of look around and you go, I feel like there's
4469640	4471880	things missing in this car, but there are.
4472920	4474840	That thing Missy was Stardew Valley.
4475880	4477240	No, like an engine.
4478200	4482120	Like, it's just like, again, like the whole, the frunk, as he calls it, there's, there's
4482120	4484200	nothing in the front part of the car.
4484200	4486520	Cause they have all the important stuffs underneath.
4486520	4487800	So this is interesting.
4488760	4489260	Anyway.
4490760	4491560	All right.
4491560	4492920	So Stardew Valley on Tesla.
4492920	4494120	So there you go.
4495720	4500760	Next up, let's do a follow-up and talk about the game awards again.
4501640	4505320	We're going to talk a little bit about that X sex secret.
4505320	4508680	The Xbox series X, the X, the X sucks.
4508680	4512760	Well, just to take a little side note, actually, it's just supposed to be called.
4512760	4516600	Xbox is actually, well, then you shouldn't have put out series X.
4517640	4518280	Here's the thing.
4518280	4518840	No, no, no.
4518840	4521160	This is, I think people are making way too big a deal out of it.
4521160	4524920	So a business insider or somebody ran a thing where there was an interview where the next
4524920	4528360	gaming platform that Microsoft is putting out is called Xbox.
4528360	4530920	And y'all done already knew known this.
4530920	4536120	Because every time they release things on windows 10 that go back with Xbox, it's Xbox,
4536120	4541640	Xbox gaming, Xbox game pass, Xbox, this Xbox, that that is the name of the platform.
4541640	4544120	Series X is just the name of the device.
4544120	4549000	And if you think this is weird and stupid, then I'm going to use the blizzard approach.
4549000	4550200	Don't you all have phones?
4550760	4553160	Because this is the same thing that cell phones do.
4553880	4554380	Right.
4554840	4557720	Do, do does a game like Stardew Valley?
4557800	4559240	Is it Stardew Valley on cell phones?
4559240	4560280	I'm assuming it is.
4560280	4560520	Okay.
4560520	4565080	So Stardew Valley, when you play it on your cell phone, you're playing it on iOS or Android,
4565080	4565580	right?
4566360	4571480	Now you might have an Apple iPhone 11 Max, but it's iOS.
4571480	4573320	You might have an iPhone 6 iOS.
4573320	4575160	You might have an iPad iOS.
4575160	4575660	Okay.
4576120	4580360	So what Microsoft's doing is actually not that crazy because I'm seeing all these hot
4580360	4584520	takes that are like, boy, Microsoft just keeps rebooting themselves.
4584520	4585560	And now it's just the original.
4585560	4587080	Didn't they already do the original Xbox?
4588520	4589800	Stop, stop.
4589800	4590920	Be quiet, Tiffany.
4592040	4599800	What it is is that the Xbox is, and that actually it makes the name Xbox one actually all that
4599800	4606760	more interesting because if Xbox one is the first truly forward compatible console, then
4606760	4608280	it is truly Xbox one.
4608840	4615880	And now series X is going to be the 11 pro max of Xbox until the next thing comes out.
4615880	4617560	If you laugh, cause it's ridiculous, guess what?
4617560	4618760	Your phones are ridiculous too.
4619720	4623560	So that's, that's my whole thing on the whole Xbox thing.
4623560	4628120	So anyway, act Efton chat says, shut the fuck up, Karen.
4628120	4628920	You don't know shit.
4628920	4631000	That's exactly what I'm saying right now.
4631000	4631320	All right.
4631320	4631820	Anyway.
4632680	4637240	But how did they keep the secret of the Xbox series X and the fact that there is a new
4637240	4641000	Xbox console coming out and we were going to get to see it at the game awards?
4641000	4645000	Well, what happened is that Jeff Keeley did an interview with variety.
4645000	4649960	And actually mentioned that when they were doing dress rehearsals and walkthroughs,
4649960	4654120	that there was actually a fake script that Phil Spencer was using.
4654680	4660040	So everybody behind the scenes and at the dress rehearsal and on the crew, they all
4660040	4663720	thought that Phil Spencer was going to be talking about Xbox game pass.
4664440	4666600	Because that was what the script was about.
4666600	4671160	And maybe that's where some of this talk about like control coming to Xbox game pass on.
4671160	4674280	So, I mean, I know Phil Spencer had slipped up and said in a stream or something, but
4674280	4675880	maybe all that stuff was like a front.
4676440	4678280	Like, because maybe that was the lie.
4678280	4681320	They may have been coming on stage with this whole lie about such and such games are coming
4681320	4686920	to game pass and that actually, no, that wasn't, that was all, it was all a ruse because then
4686920	4691880	the actual story, as we all know, and what we saw was that it was the Xbox series X,
4691880	4695800	but I thought that was fascinating that they had a whole fake script that they used.
4695800	4698600	So everybody thought he was coming out to talk about Xbox game pass.
4699240	4700200	That's pretty cool.
4700200	4702120	I mean, yeah, but you know what?
4703080	4704600	Did, but did it leak?
4705880	4707080	No, it did not.
4707080	4708520	No one saw that one coming.
4708520	4710120	So you know what?
4710120	4710600	It worked.
4711800	4712680	All right.
4712680	4715400	Bobby Black Wolf wants to remind us, Jeff and I have something in common.
4715400	4717160	We've both been seen in variety.
4717160	4720920	Yes, that is true.
4720920	4721480	That is true.
4722280	4723080	All right.
4723080	4725400	Let's, let's go back to a classic time.
4725400	4729720	Let's go back to a time when variety was actually still a magazine.
4729720	4731000	There was actually a variety magazine.
4731240	4733960	I remember that magazine because we used to get it at work.
4733960	4734360	That's right.
4734360	4736760	It's the classic game of the week.
4736760	4740760	And, uh, every week dark soccer steps into the vault and finds a game on the shelf that she
4740760	4742680	thinks, Hmm, why?
4742680	4744760	Yes, this would be a good selection.
4744760	4745080	Yes.
4745080	4747000	And everybody should check out this game this week.
4747000	4747800	Everyone really should.
4747800	4748440	It's a good game.
4748440	4749240	It is a, it is.
4749240	4750040	It's one of those games.
4750040	4753080	I'm kind of like, I'm really surprised she hasn't done this one, but again,
4753080	4754280	I think it's a 10 year old game.
4754280	4755000	I think it's one of those.
4755000	4756360	It just turned 10, didn't it?
4756360	4756840	Yes, it did.
4756840	4762120	So dark soccer, that being said, what is the newly inducted classic game of the week?
4762120	4763160	Dragon age origins.
4763960	4769240	So of course, you know, it was the first of the dragon age games.
4769240	4772200	Um, it was published by Bioware R.I.P.
4772200	4775560	The Bioware I knew and loved, um, and published by electronic arts.
4775560	4777400	It is the first of the dragon age games.
4777400	4782440	It was released on windows, PS3 and Xbox 360 in November, 2009.
4782440	4784680	And on Mac OS December, 2009.
4784680	4791720	God, that would have been OS 10.4, 5, something like that.
4792280	4798920	Anyway, um, so it is set in the kingdom of Ferelden during, uh, a period where things
4798920	4800040	are kind of shitty.
4800040	4806360	And on top of there being political shittiness, there's, um, a, uh, a bunch of dark spawn
4806360	4811160	running around because, uh, yeah, dark spawn are absolutely crap.
4811800	4816840	And they're demons from, from, uh, the other world, from the, maybe from the Fade.
4816840	4819400	I don't, I don't remember if they ever said that the dark spawn came from the Fade, but
4819400	4825880	at any rate, um, but you play as one of three classes from three different backgrounds.
4825880	4828360	Uh, you play a warrior, a mage or rogue.
4828360	4833880	You can be elven, um, which actually I think in the elven, you either get, uh, as a mage,
4833880	4839160	I think you start off as a circle mage and the others let you choose city elf or, uh,
4839880	4844360	um, Dalish elf, which are basically like the, the wild elves.
4844360	4846920	And then you can be a human or you can be a dwarf.
4846920	4852760	Um, and you are recruited as a gray warden and you meet Alistair.
4852760	4854120	Oh, he's so great.
4854680	4858760	Um, because, uh, as, as he says, swooping is bad.
4859480	4863720	But anyway, um, it's played in a third person perspective and you can shift it, uh, shift
4863720	4869560	it to top down and you pick up other characters in the game that sometimes show up in later
4869560	4877560	games, Morgan, um, and sometimes show up only in the comics, but it's really spawned this
4877560	4881400	whole beautiful, uh, uh, right now, I guess trilogy.
4881960	4884760	And, um, we're going to be having another dragon age game come out.
4884760	4890920	So, um, but it really was well received and well reviewed, although I am glad that they
4890920	4896600	went from not having the character have a voice to in dragon age two, where you could
4896600	4899480	actually, the character had dialogue and Hawk was awesome.
4900040	4910440	But at any rate, um, the, uh, it's began development in 2002 had more than 144 voice
4910440	4917160	actors, and it had, um, I non sort of, uh, compose the game's music and, uh, the console
4917160	4920600	versions were outsourced to a group called edge of reality.
4921160	4926440	Um, the first expansion port came out in March, 2010 as awakening.
4926440	4931800	And then, uh, dragon age two came out in 2011 and dragon age inquisition came out in 2014.
4931800	4936280	I've played this shit out of dragon age inquisition, just saying this is the game that
4936280	4941160	brought Cullen into that with his beautiful voice actor who kind of sometimes goes off
4941160	4943800	the deep end and goes missing for days and then they find him.
4944600	4949080	Um, yeah, that was a bit of drama, but at any rate, um, so as you go through, you're
4949080	4954200	a great warden, which being a great warden has you do something like part of it involves
4954200	4958120	ingesting, uh, dark spawn blood and some other botanicals.
4958120	4963400	So I guess gin and, um, so you can sense the dark spawn, you get nightmares and stuff.
4964040	4968840	Um, you can, you know, you've got your spell casting, you've got your rogue, which, um,
4969800	4971800	I think in this one, I really preferred a rogue.
4972520	4976200	Um, and dragon age two, I prefer to rogue, but I played a major in dragon age three because
4976200	4977560	it was much easier.
4977560	4982280	Um, so the classes that are available to you, as I said, you can sort of mix and match.
4982280	4987400	We had dalish elf, dwarf commoner, a city elf, a major human noble or dwarf noble.
4987960	4991160	Um, and it affects how the other characters will treat you.
4991800	4996200	Um, however, they all follow pretty much the same completion of the story.
4996200	5005320	Like for an example, if you play a, an elf and you get it on with Alistair and he becomes
5005320	5010520	the king, you have to be as mistress because of the politics, the land, not permitting,
5011400	5013960	um, the king to marry an elf.
5013960	5016680	And it's actually, you know, not spoiler.
5016680	5021880	He's elf blooded, you know, meaning that his mother was an elf, which you find out all
5021880	5026520	about her in one of the books and in dragon age inquisition, because Fiona was kind of
5026520	5033320	stupid, but at any rate, um, it was very similar in gameplay to star wars nights of the old
5033320	5041320	Republic, um, where you engage, you have to engage the enemy and then attack that enemy.
5041320	5044520	Um, or you can switch back to other enemies that you're fighting.
5044520	5049000	You level up your warden with experience points, you know, like any type of RPG.
5049640	5055880	Um, and then you can, um, get those points to distribute amongst your attributes.
5056520	5060520	Um, you can interact with your party members and other NPCs.
5060520	5066600	You have dialogue trees, which will unlock based on the things that you first select.
5066600	5072680	So, um, and of course it also will sort of build again, your reputation with how you
5072680	5074280	interact with these other characters.
5075000	5080840	Um, and of course this really, I think, incorporated into later Bioware games.
5080840	5085880	Cause you know, we had the, the paragon renegade dynamic in, um, mass effect, right?
5086840	5092520	So, um, but at any rate you are in the world of Thedas, which, okay, this is going to sound
5092520	5098200	kind of funny, but one of the things I always liked about it is that their world is actually
5098200	5100120	set in a Southern hemisphere.
5101000	5105480	So the further South you go, the colder it gets in the further North you go, the warmer
5105480	5105960	it gets.
5106600	5111240	Um, and they are in the middle of a blight and the dark spawn are being shits and you
5111240	5111880	got to stop them.
5112440	5121320	Um, so of course this game brought us like some of the most, I would say memorable characters.
5121320	5124600	I mean, just because I freaking love Alistair.
5124600	5127080	Like he's one of my favorite characters ever in a game.
5127080	5133480	There's Morrigan who, uh, you know, was raised by, uh, well, I don't want to spoil too much
5133480	5138680	if you are going to go in and play the games later, but her mother is Flemeth who is voiced
5138680	5139480	by Kate Mulgrew.
5140360	5147080	So, um, you have, uh, Ogrin the Dwarf who is just like, I love him cause he's drunk
5147080	5147880	all the time.
5147880	5152440	You have Wynn who actually ended up, uh, she was, I didn't care for her in the game so
5152440	5156280	much, but I really liked her in one of the later novels.
5156280	5157880	I really liked her character in the novels.
5158440	5163480	Um, you have Zevran who is the, uh, the Elvish assassin who wants to fuck everybody.
5164440	5167320	Um, you have a dog, a Mabari.
5167320	5170200	And of course the first thing I do is put in the mod so that you can have them in your
5170200	5174840	party all the time, even if he's not actually in your party, because I love dog.
5174840	5175720	I just named him dog.
5175720	5176680	But can you pet the dog?
5178360	5179240	You can play with him.
5179240	5179740	Yeah.
5180280	5185320	Um, he also in the DLC, you get a character named Shale who has a golem who, uh, hates
5185320	5190200	birds and, um, you actually find out more about Shale later on through the game.
5190200	5196520	Shale was a dwarf who was part of like some ritual to turn her into a golem and she's
5196520	5197640	sarcastic as fuck.
5197640	5198600	That is my bitch.
5198600	5199560	I love her.
5199560	5206200	Um, you get, uh, Sten who is, uh, Qunari, um, and I mean, and Leliana.
5206200	5207480	I love Leliana.
5207480	5211240	She, um, and a lot of these characters will make appearances in Dragon Age 2, but you
5211240	5217160	get Leliana as a ongoing character in Dragon Age 3 as your spy, not 3, but Inquisition
5217160	5217960	as your spy master.
5217960	5219880	I just freaking, I love all these characters.
5219880	5223400	Like I like a series when I like all the characters and the ones that I hate, I really fucking
5223400	5223900	hate.
5224460	5232700	Um, like I hated the character Logain so much that I actually went in and let him live so
5232700	5237100	that I could feed him to the, the darkspawn in a later game.
5238060	5238540	Nice.
5238540	5248220	Um, it's just, I, I freaking, I freaking love this game and, and it is a bit more of a mature
5248220	5251100	game, you know, it's a memory game.
5252060	5257020	Um, so, but it is just really fun.
5257020	5264060	I mean, you think about this first game being a game from 2009, it doesn't look too bad
5264060	5265580	for being a 10 year old game.
5265580	5267580	I thought they did a great job with it.
5267580	5272060	And since then, people have done their own high res mods like they did from, you've seen
5272060	5277260	the high res mods for Mass Effect 3 on PC, but they've done, um, you know, there's a
5277260	5282620	massive modding community for this, like custom hairstyles and outfits and all kinds
5282620	5285260	of, you know, gorgeous stuff.
5285260	5293980	And there is even a, um, what's the word I'm trying to think, a graphic nookie mod for
5293980	5296700	getting it on sexy times with your characters so that them just standing where they're
5296700	5297200	nowhere.
5297740	5306780	Um, and it really, I mean, it's probably, I'd say one of the best games that came out.
5306860	5309820	I mean, the DLC adds a lot more to it.
5309820	5315420	Um, you also have some crossovers with, uh, BioWare's other games, like in Mass Effect
5315420	5320940	2, you can get the blood dragon armor, which comes directly from this game.
5320940	5326460	So, and, um, as far as the DLC, we had the stone prisoners that gives you shale.
5326460	5331740	We had the warden's keep that, um, adds the fortress of soldiers peak.
5331740	5337420	And you get a little bit more about the gray wardens, um, returned to Ostagar, which is
5337420	5339660	the first battlefield that you fight on.
5339660	5346780	Then awakening came out, which was basically the aftermath of origins where, uh, you have
5346780	5351100	to stop this creature called the architect, which I think the architect was the sort of
5351100	5354860	lead into the main, uh, antagonist for dragon age inquisition.
5354860	5361180	You had the dark spawn Chronicles where you basically are, uh, playing as the dark spawn
5361180	5366860	army, um, and you have Leliana's song, which is, you know, some of her experiences, the
5366860	5371820	golems of Amgarak and witch hunt, which is where you go look for Morgan after she fucks
5371820	5378860	off into, you know, Heriluvian, which is a new war that takes you into the Fade or some
5378860	5379660	intermediary place.
5379660	5382380	Not really the Fade, it's like an intermediary that kind of works like the Fade.
5383020	5385180	Um, but yeah, this game is great.
5385180	5391100	It, it's been, I mean, I don't know why people said that the graphics weren't super great,
5391100	5394700	but it was pretty, I mean, but they said that a lot of it was really eye catching, but some
5394700	5399660	people were saying, like I was saying that, you know, even ace me, the nookie scenes are
5399660	5400700	just really anticlimactic.
5401260	5406380	So, um, yeah, tons of mods, tons of mods.
5406380	5411740	And like I said, it is spawned a, uh, a franchise.
5412060	5416700	There's also a free to play game called Heroes of Dragon Age that's on iOS, which I've played
5416700	5417420	for a little bit.
5417980	5421900	Um, and there is another, uh, Dragon Age game coming out.
5421900	5424940	We've already seen some teaser information, just a little bit leaked.
5425420	5433420	Um, we know it's going to be, uh, uh, set in, um, well, actually I'll say if you, if you
5433420	5436620	haven't read the spoilers and you don't want the spoilers, then I'm not going to say anything
5436620	5437340	about it.
5437340	5440060	I personally was excited.
5440060	5440700	Fuck, I'll just say it.
5440700	5444780	It's set into Vinter, which you don't really, you hear a lot about this place, but you don't
5444780	5446700	really know a lot about it.
5446700	5449580	So I think that it's going to be just really awesome.
5449580	5453340	And I'm glad this game came out because it gave me one of my absolute favorite franchises,
5453340	5456300	but I'd have to say thank you to Mass Effect for getting me into Dragon Age.
5456860	5457740	All right.
5457740	5458780	I think the video looped.
5459900	5460860	That's all right.
5460860	5461500	So there it is.
5461500	5462460	I think I can breathe now.
5462460	5462940	That's fine.
5462940	5465980	Your classic game of the week is Dragon Age.
5466620	5467020	Good pick.
5467580	5468220	Good pick.
5468220	5471020	I have to admit, I never got into Dragon Age as much as I did Mass Effect.
5471020	5477100	And I think for some reason, like I, I, I, I clicked a little more with Inquisition and
5477100	5480140	I think just maybe some of the upgrades to the actual game part of it.
5480140	5481820	How could you let Alistair become a drunk?
5483020	5488940	Anyway, uh, many, many different ways the story can play out in, in a game like Dragon
5488940	5489180	Age.
5489180	5493580	And as Dark Sakura said, uh, Kay Mogru in the voice acting cast, you know, the only
5493580	5497980	thing cooler than that, that I can really think of, uh, is Linda Carter in, uh, Skyrim.
5498540	5502380	Um, and I mean, Lindsay Wagner in, um, Death Stranding.
5502380	5505740	Although she didn't, it's her likeness for the younger version.
5505740	5506220	Likeness.
5506220	5506780	Yeah.
5506780	5508380	But her voice for the older version.
5508380	5509100	Yes.
5509100	5509660	Yeah.
5509660	5510860	Lindsay Wagner, man.
5510860	5514060	Man, has Leslie and Warren ever been in a video game?
5514060	5514780	That's what we need.
5514780	5518860	We need all these television stars of, uh, the seventies and eighties to, uh, come back.
5518860	5520300	Leslie and Warren was awesome.
5520300	5522220	Leslie and Warren was awesome.
5522220	5526140	They did a Mission Impossible game years ago, but it was that, do you remember when ABC
5526140	5527820	did that reboot in the nineties?
5528780	5533980	Brad from Pod Culture points out that Eve Miles was in, uh, she was actually in Dragon
5533980	5537420	Age 2, um, as Meryl.
5537420	5539420	I wanted to romance her and then she pissed me off.
5540380	5542140	So, um, but yeah, she was Meryl.
5542140	5542620	All right.
5542620	5543260	So anyway.
5543260	5543580	All right.
5543580	5546620	Hashtag Leslie and Warren for epic video game, please.
5548060	5549420	We need to do the clue MMO.
5550140	5551980	You know, you know, they're doing clue MO.
5551980	5552780	They're doing that.
5552780	5553980	It's not just clue though.
5553980	5555500	Obviously she was a Mission Impossible.
5555500	5557580	She had a lot of television movies and stuff back in the day.
5557660	5560060	But, um, oh, says Linda Hamilton and Gears 5.
5560060	5562940	That's Linda Hamilton's more like a nineties.
5562940	5566860	She's the only reason I want to see that terrible Terminator movie that you actually saw it.
5566860	5570540	No, I didn't see it, but I want to see it because I forgot all about that movie.
5570540	5571580	Oh, the Terminator dark.
5571580	5572860	It was apparently terrible.
5572860	5576940	Speaking of terrible movies, uh, dark soccer and I have it going to be terrible.
5576940	5578060	We have a Christmas date.
5578060	5579100	We're going to go see cats.
5579100	5581260	We're going to go see the patched version of cats.
5581260	5581420	Okay.
5581420	5586700	So the reason they patched it actually, because not all of the visual effects had been, um,
5586780	5587740	in the release version.
5587740	5588780	They released the wrong version.
5590620	5590860	Okay.
5590860	5592300	So there's been a lot of talk on.
5592300	5594220	I now want to see the unpatched version.
5594220	5595580	That sounds even better.
5595580	5598140	It's like you could see Judi Dench's hands in one scene.
5599420	5604300	Everybody's fucking talking about how, oh, here we are 2019.
5604300	5607180	Now we're patching our movies, just like our video games.
5607180	5609420	And it's like, it's like, isn't that the tea?
5610060	5617500	Like, Oh, we, we had to in new in cats, version 1.1 fixed Judi Dench's hand in the,
5617500	5619900	you know, jealous old dance.
5619900	5622060	I want the unpassed version on Blu-ray.
5622060	5624940	Doesn't Judi Dench play, um, old Deuteronomy.
5624940	5625340	She does.
5625900	5626540	Yeah.
5626540	5631020	Actually, I'm kind of interested to see them do old Deuteronomy in a female role.
5631020	5633900	Cause old Deuteronomy on stage was always a male role.
5635020	5636620	So yeah, no, look, well, here's the thing.
5636620	5640540	So Dark Soccer and I, we have a Christmas date because Dark Soccer is Jewish.
5640540	5645260	So, you know, whatever with Christmas and our plans, uh, that we usually do kind of
5645260	5648300	fell through, but nobody has to truly be alone on Christmas.
5648300	5651900	So Dark Soccer is going to be my Christmas Eve or Christmas day.
5653340	5655660	Dan and I do, um, our presence on Christmas Eve.
5655660	5658060	And we've always done things with my dad on Christmas Eve.
5658060	5660060	So, uh, we're still doing that.
5660060	5664140	If we can also find the, uh, like an Asian food place that's open, then that has happened too.
5664140	5665900	But we're going to go see Cats.
5665900	5668540	And yes, we've heard how bad it is.
5668540	5672220	Um, I don't know about you, you Dark Soccer, but I don't give a fuck.
5672220	5674220	Like I still, I really wanted to see it.
5674220	5676140	No, I want to love it and all its badness.
5676140	5677500	I'm going to sing right along with it.
5677500	5678140	Here's the thing.
5678140	5679020	Here's the thing.
5679020	5680780	I understand that the movie is terrible.
5681500	5686140	Did you know, fun fact, the play that it's based on is also terrible.
5686140	5687100	No, it's not.
5687100	5688940	So what were you expecting?
5688940	5689900	It's not terrible.
5690860	5693900	It was my only play I've ever seen on Broadway.
5693900	5696860	I saw it at the Winter Garden Theater when I was in high school.
5696860	5700300	And you know what they did in the Winter Garden Theater after they got rid of my beloved cats?
5701020	5701740	Mamma Mia.
5701740	5702240	Rocky.
5702860	5703900	No, that wasn't in the Winter Garden.
5703900	5704460	That was Winter Garden.
5704460	5705660	It was Circle in the Square.
5705660	5708700	No, I thought that the first place that it played on was Winter Garden after Cats ended.
5708700	5709260	Did it?
5709260	5710620	That was Circle Gets the Square?
5710620	5711260	No, there's just-
5711260	5712140	I'll double check.
5712140	5713180	Square Gets the Circle.
5713180	5713660	All right.
5713660	5713980	Anyway.
5713980	5715260	Cats is not fucking horrible.
5715260	5716460	So shut the fuck up.
5716460	5718860	It's, it's bad in a good way.
5718860	5722300	It's one of those, this is, it's cheese, but Xanadu.
5722300	5723820	It's Xanadu bad.
5724380	5725100	It's not bad though.
5726220	5728540	I mean, no, it really isn't bad.
5728540	5731660	I mean, you have to look at the source material is, you know, a T.S.
5731660	5732620	Elliot book.
5732620	5737980	It was a bunch of disparate poems about cats and it's there just to have the spotlight on
5737980	5738940	each cat.
5738940	5740780	That to me is what it is.
5740780	5743180	Each cat has our own little spotlight.
5743180	5747260	It shows the playfulness of, of the animals.
5747260	5751580	It shows, you know, just a little bit of, if you would humanize them, what their lives
5751580	5752220	would be like.
5752220	5756940	I mean, I really just, well, then again, I am like, that was Xanadu where I like all
5756940	5762060	the parts of it, but I, I freaking, I don't even know where my poor CD is.
5762060	5765340	I played it so much and sang with it so much.
5765340	5766620	Cats is not bad.
5766620	5768380	You have to look at it as a sum.
5769420	5772140	So, and you know, go ahead.
5773180	5774140	No, that's fine.
5774140	5776300	I'm gonna make the stupid joke after you're done.
5776300	5780460	Because I was going to say, y'all know, if you don't know, you're going to know, I love
5780460	5782860	the movie showgirls from the mid nineties.
5782860	5785820	I was just going to say it's no showgirls, but yeah.
5785820	5786540	And here's the thing.
5786540	5787820	Here's the thing about showgirls.
5787820	5790460	Showgirls really truly is one of those movies that like, it's so bad.
5790460	5792300	It's kind of good, but it's one of those movies.
5792300	5795580	Like I could just kind of like have on in the background as I'm like going about my
5795580	5795980	day.
5795980	5797180	It's a Christmas movie.
5797180	5801100	I can be cleaning, you know, or whatever, or, or getting something organized or something.
5801100	5803100	And then like, you know, come along and I'll be quoting along with the movie.
5803100	5804140	You know, you don't know shit.
5804700	5805420	Where are you from?
5805420	5805980	Back East.
5805980	5806780	Where back East?
5806780	5807980	Different places.
5807980	5812460	You know, like it's just, you can just, it's like one of those great, like background movies.
5812460	5817580	And you know, there, there, there was a point they were trying to make somewhere in there.
5818860	5821180	There was a point to be made in there somewhere.
5822780	5824460	Didn't they make a sequel to that movie?
5825900	5826380	Showgirls.
5826380	5827020	I thought they did.
5827020	5833900	It's about the, um, the girl from the, the other dancer that the one guy is with the,
5833900	5835820	that one guy with the dreads is with.
5836380	5837740	And then it's like about her.
5838060	5840780	And it was, it was not lauded.
5842540	5843020	Yeah.
5843020	5845580	It, it, don't try to read too much into the plot.
5845580	5846380	Just, just don't.
5846380	5848860	Although it would have been awesome if they'd made the sequel.
5848860	5851740	Cause you know, the end of the movie was a teaser for the sequel.
5851740	5855100	Cause she gets back in, I mean, spoiler alert for Showgirls.
5855100	5858060	But at the end of the movie, she gets back in the car with the hitchhiker that dropped
5858060	5859820	her off in the beginning and then stole her stuff.
5859820	5863820	So she gets back in the car and they going off and you see that they're on their way
5863820	5864620	to Hollywood.
5864620	5866140	There's a sign that says Hollywood.
5866140	5870780	Well, the second movie, cause I mean, justice for Showgirls, there should be a Showgirls
5870780	5871260	too.
5871260	5872220	The second movie was good.
5872220	5875020	Well, I, and actually there was a Showgirls too, but it wasn't the same thing.
5875020	5876380	That was all about Penny.
5876380	5876880	Yeah.
5877740	5878540	I couldn't remember her name.
5879100	5882620	Rena something is the actress's name and she did it all herself.
5882620	5887020	But anyway, um, the second movie was going to be a Hollywood parody.
5887020	5892860	And instead we got, uh, Alan Smithy presents burn Hollywood burn, which I'm convinced
5892860	5895340	some of that was the concept for Showgirls too.
5895340	5896460	I haven't seen that.
5896460	5900860	It's like that movie is bad and period.
5900860	5906780	There's no, there's no, but yet, although no, it's, it's just bad with a period.
5906780	5910940	I want them to make a sequel to cats, but with all the internet meme cats, like grumpy
5910940	5915580	cat, long cat, I want to find out what happens to them when we, you know?
5916460	5917020	All right.
5917020	5918700	Anyhow, so let's move on.
5918700	5918940	Oh yes.
5918940	5920140	That was all the classic game of the week.
5920140	5920540	Sorry.
5920540	5921340	Uh, tangents.
5921340	5921900	They happen.
5921900	5925500	Let's get into some rapid fire news and talk about some other things happening around in
5925500	5928140	the game world very quickly, starting off with Loki.
5928140	5929100	So this is kind of cute.
5929100	5934780	Then if you have a Japanese region switch or you happen to have an account in the Japanese
5934780	5941580	region and you have Labo, um, or Labo VR cartridge, you can actually play a Christmas
5941580	5943420	themed Labo mini game.
5943980	5948460	Um, with that, it's basically a Santa platformer on rooftops.
5949420	5950860	So that's the neat thing.
5950860	5957100	Basically you have to have the Japanese news channel, um, so you make your free, uh, Japanese
5957100	5959580	region switch account and you can get it through there.
5960620	5961260	All right.
5961260	5966620	And then in 2020, we've got our first games with golden ounce.
5966620	5970780	So we have, uh, for Xbox one, six shards of darkness.
5971660	5976620	And then we've got Batman and telltale series, and those are both Xbox one and then your
5976620	5982220	Xbox 360 compatible games, Tekken six and Lego star Wars to the original trilogy.
5984220	5985100	That's it.
5985100	5985500	All right.
5986060	5991980	Uh, well going to the switch and Nintendo, um, Nintendo made a yule log video because
5991980	5994300	this is the time of year where companies are making you log videos.
5994300	5994460	Yeah.
5994460	5998700	Like, isn't there like the Overwatch, the Overwatch guy, Jeff, just sitting there with
5998700	5999500	a yule log or something.
5999500	6003420	There's that there's steam has one that's part of their steam sale right now.
6003500	6003980	I know.
6003980	6005340	Was it Linus Texas?
6005340	6006620	They did an eight K one.
6006620	6006940	Yeah.
6006940	6007980	I don't anyway.
6007980	6012700	Um, so, uh, there's a new sights and sounds video that was put out by Nintendo where you
6012700	6017260	can just watch somebody play their switch for half an hour in front of a fire.
6018460	6023500	Sadly, the switch has never thrown into the fire because I know you all want to know dark
6023500	6027500	souls or like, like a rage thing that happens.
6027500	6027820	Yeah.
6027820	6032220	Playing dark souls or something or like, I can't beat this fucking level of Mario Odyssey.
6032220	6033020	Fuck this thing.
6033580	6035740	The drift on these controllers is so bad.
6035740	6037740	That makes me want to throw them into the fire.
6038460	6039980	Speaking of steam.
6039980	6040300	Yes.
6040300	6043740	The winter sale just recently kicked off this past week.
6043740	6046060	It's running concurrently with the steam awards thing.
6046060	6049020	So there's lots of games on sale there through Thursday.
6049020	6050940	January 2nd is when that ends.
6050940	6054220	So I'm sure there's a lot of people that are, you know, going like supermarket sweep and
6054220	6058540	shoving their cart full of hams right now and whatever like cheap video games they're
6058540	6060700	waiting to catch up on.
6060700	6064540	Something to keep in mind, like you said earlier in the show humble bundle.
6064540	6064700	Yeah.
6064700	6071260	And I just, I just didn't do that because I was looking for a certain game for my son
6071260	6071820	on the switch.
6073180	6077660	Trials rising because he likes playing the demo for PlayStation four.
6077660	6079980	And I just, I'm not moving the PlayStation four to his room.
6080860	6083900	So I got it for him on his PC.
6083900	6087100	And so I gifted it to him in steam because I know he'll never get it before Christmas
6087100	6088940	because he never opened steam ever.
6088940	6091660	So we'll be fine there.
6091660	6092460	Be fine.
6092460	6092700	Good.
6093260	6093820	So there's that.
6093820	6096540	And then the Epic store is doing a sale as well.
6096540	6100220	They are also giving away 12 free games, one each day.
6100220	6101420	And I'm actually kind of pissed off.
6101420	6104060	I missed the first couple of days because super hot was one of the games.
6104060	6106540	Yeah, I already have it, but I didn't have that yet.
6106540	6107900	I missed it yesterday.
6107900	6109740	Towerfall Ascension was one of the games too.
6109740	6111340	That was, yeah, two days ago.
6111340	6116300	And today was I got today's little inferno, which I was today already having like all
6116300	6118380	these platforms still played it.
6118380	6121420	I feel like it's one of those things where like the last one will be a big one.
6121420	6121900	You know?
6121900	6124300	I mean, Epic store gave away, it's Fortnite.
6124300	6127340	And that's the Epic store gave away those Batman games.
6127340	6127980	Not that long ago.
6127980	6129180	Those are some great games.
6129180	6130220	Like we never played them.
6130220	6134380	So my Epic library is getting quite large because of all those free games.
6134380	6134620	Yeah.
6134620	6136700	Considering I've never spent a penny on that store.
6136700	6137660	I have a lot of games.
6138300	6139580	Well, they also have a thing right now.
6139580	6141020	And that's the Sarpin epic step.
6141020	6144780	But if you want a game for that's 14 99 or above, they'll give you 10 bucks off.
6144780	6144940	Yeah.
6144940	6146860	That's kind of, that's their sale instead of that.
6146860	6149180	Cause you know, steam makes the mini game out of it and all that stuff.
6149180	6152620	So Epic just, well, they still have stuff discounted too, but it's, well, the Epic
6152620	6153340	and, you know, okay.
6153340	6156060	So since we've been talking them up, let me knock them down a few pegs.
6156060	6158300	The Epic store still kind of sucks in a lot of ways.
6158300	6161420	Like the fact that they don't have the prepaid cards and that whole thing.
6161420	6164300	And the fact, you know, it's still kind of a bare bones thing.
6164300	6168220	So, I mean, the fact that they're doing a bare bones sale isn't too terribly
6168220	6169660	surprising at the end of that.
6169660	6172460	I can't use V bucks on, uh, the Epic store.
6172460	6174380	I mean, that is their currency for Fortnite.
6174380	6176220	So I don't think so.
6176220	6179020	Uh, the power is saying super hot was on Twitch prime earlier this year.
6179020	6179740	Did I miss it?
6180300	6180940	I must have.
6181500	6182140	I don't remember.
6182140	6185180	Like I ever played any of the games I have through Twitch prime anyways.
6185180	6186620	I know I have a library there too.
6186620	6188620	And I couldn't tell you what's on it.
6188620	6189020	I know.
6189020	6189740	Right.
6189740	6192460	So, Hey, is there, is there a gift thing on Twitch prime right now?
6192460	6193820	Maybe we need to open up the box.
6193820	6195020	We haven't done that in a few weeks.
6195580	6198060	So, and since Bobby's there and paying attention, maybe.
6198060	6199180	Um, cause it doesn't work.
6199180	6200780	So here's what the deal is.
6200780	6203580	I'm logged into my account here.
6203660	6209980	So I can't actually open the box because that is something that happens on the VOG.
6209980	6211580	I have to be on VOG account to open the box.
6211580	6212780	That's why I always yell at Bobby.
6212780	6213420	Thank you, Bobby.
6213420	6213980	Open the box.
6214540	6217580	Uh, and it's a legal, it's a league of legends mystery skin this week.
6217580	6219900	So that's something that, um, some folks might actually want.
6219900	6221740	So free grub hub.
6221740	6226060	I'm going to just throw in some, uh, stuff into there as well.
6226060	6228940	You know, they kind of stopped giving away games on Twitch.
6228940	6229020	Yeah.
6229020	6231980	It's a lot of learn more and I'm like, I don't want to learn.
6231980	6233420	I just want free things.
6235820	6239660	Oh, there's also speaking of which, um, there's a discord slash
6239660	6241340	X-Box thing going on right now.
6241340	6243900	So if you have X-Box, I think it's game pass.
6245020	6246540	Maybe it's X-Box gold.
6246540	6246940	Sorry.
6246940	6247980	I don't remember off the top of my head.
6247980	6249020	It's cause I have both.
6249020	6252060	It's one of the X-Box things you can get three months of discord nitro.
6252860	6254380	So you can like boost the box server.
6254380	6256220	No, we need a lot of boost to get to the next level.
6256220	6258860	But, uh, but, and it goes the other way around too.
6258860	6262220	If you have discord nitro, you can get free X-Box game pass for
6262220	6263500	like three months or something like that.
6263500	6265420	So, um, yeah, check that out.
6265420	6266540	It's game pass ultimate.
6266540	6266940	Thank you.
6267820	6268860	So check that out.
6268860	6271100	If you're on one or the other, the discord or X-Box thing.
6271100	6272860	Cause that is a thing that's pretty nice.
6272860	6276380	So, uh, and one month of EA access through the X-Box thing as well.
6276380	6276700	That's right.
6276700	6278060	I need to turn that on.
6278060	6280700	I'm trying to think what's on EA access that might want to play, but I'm
6280700	6282700	sure there's probably the new need for speed game actually.
6282700	6283660	I'd check that out.
6283660	6284460	So cool.
6285660	6286380	All right.
6286380	6287900	Um, let's move on.
6287900	6289980	And, uh, dark soccer, you have some rapid fire news too.
6290540	6290940	I do.
6291740	6296460	Um, so, uh, and Dan and I actually watched this and we were all kind of
6296460	6297100	giddy about it.
6297900	6300140	New stern pinball stranger things.
6300140	6301900	Did you watch the preview?
6303340	6305260	No, they had the premium version up there.
6305260	6305660	Oh my God.
6305660	6306700	The play field is great.
6306700	6309740	It has a, like a drive-in projection screen on it.
6309740	6311660	I was asked how did, do they do the upside down?
6311660	6313420	Do they do like a creature from black lagoon?
6313500	6318140	So you get like, there's, I think it's one of the modes, um, where the screen
6318140	6322620	actually breaks apart and there's like the portal behind it that you have to
6322620	6328540	shoot the, um, uh, the balls into like the, almost like the, the mouth entrance
6328540	6330300	into the upside down.
6331100	6335500	And then you have like the ball catch on the back wall is magnetic.
6336060	6337980	It is fucking sweet.
6337980	6342860	So you lock your balls on a magnetic catch on the back wall and they sit on
6342860	6344060	the side of the wall.
6344060	6345900	And then when multi ball starts, it releases them.
6345900	6350780	I think they're showing a premium on the preview, but I mean, the animation
6350780	6351740	was great.
6351740	6355740	Um, you get that ramp that's used to attack the demogorgon when it goes to
6355740	6356700	swallow the pinball.
6357340	6361580	Um, and the, uh, the projection that goes out also animates different
6361580	6364140	targets, including some pop-ups spinner.
6364700	6366860	And it's just really, really involved.
6366860	6368700	I really think stern is doing great.
6368700	6370940	I just want to see who the designer is.
6370940	6373740	Um, Bobby's actually saying in chat, my friend who I'm assuming must've
6373740	6376220	worked on this is really upset because it's actually leaked.
6376220	6379260	They were all under embargo and some ass hat posted the trailer on their
6379260	6382300	personal YouTube channel and all the other outlets ran with it.
6382300	6382620	Yeah.
6382620	6385660	It's been removed from the link I have here.
6385660	6388460	Once on the internet, always on the internet, at least the reception is
6388460	6389340	really positive.
6389340	6392220	So that's, you know, a small plus for what it's worth.
6392220	6395340	Well, and the thing about is that having that little leak actually makes
6395340	6397580	me way more excited.
6397580	6399580	I'm really looking forward to this one.
6399580	6401500	It might end up being one that we get in our house.
6402140	6406780	You know, I mean, I probably would still like a black knight sort of rage
6406780	6410220	just a little bit more because, you know, Steve worked really hard on it.
6410220	6411740	And Steve Richie is a great guy.
6412380	6414940	Um, I just want to know though, who the main designer for this was.
6414940	6416060	Cause I'm not seeing anything.
6416700	6419900	Um, Oh, Bobby says the friend works for a media site.
6419900	6424540	He had a real preview in the works for the clicks, but it, somebody under,
6424540	6425900	Oh, so it was under embargo.
6425900	6426300	I get it.
6426300	6429740	So somebody, somebody cut all the other, uh, press outlets off the
6429740	6431420	kneecaps, basically by leaking it to YouTube.
6431420	6431820	I get it.
6431820	6433020	Yeah, yikes.
6433660	6435900	But at any rate though, it looks amazing.
6435900	6440220	It really is like, this is what pinball has come to.
6440220	6441660	And I'm quite pleased with it.
6442300	6445020	You know, this is pretty cool.
6445020	6446140	This is honestly enough.
6446140	6449740	What I think pinball 2000 should have been.
6449740	6454140	I mean the video screen aspect to it was pretty cool, but I like having
6454140	6455820	these more interactive elements.
6456300	6459660	You know, for example, like dialed in, had its cell phone on there and
6459660	6465100	everything, and you had like the, the video game, like the Tron game on,
6465100	6467020	on the play field and everything.
6467020	6471580	I love this interactive, um, you know, element that changes its dynamic for
6471580	6473100	every gameplay is going to be different.
6473660	6475820	And I'm really, really super excited about it.
6475820	6477180	I think it's going to be amazing.
6477180	6477680	Cool.
6478460	6478960	All right.
6479420	6480380	And one more, right?
6480380	6480880	Yeah.
6481120	6486480	So the soundtracks for Soul Blade and Soul Calibur are, um, streamable now.
6487280	6492160	So it looks like that you can, I mean, get them on pretty much any
6492160	6498080	service, Apple Music, Spotify, YouTube, you name it, Napster's still around
6498080	6498580	shit.
6499280	6503600	But you look for Namco sounds and that's the series that it's under.
6503600	6506080	We had the Soul Blade soundtrack.
6506080	6507280	We have this little caliber soundtrack.
6507280	6507840	Come to think of it.
6507840	6512080	We had them on CD, but that was like that whole Edge of Soul long version
6512080	6513520	was so amazing.
6513520	6514240	It was so good.
6514800	6517600	But yeah, um, go get them.
6517600	6518100	They're free.
6518720	6520800	Well, free with your rental of the service.
6520800	6525200	So, um, I think like if you, if you had like Soul Calibur 2, like Brave Edge,
6525200	6528320	Braver Soul, I think is the name of it shows up in a lot of other Namco games
6528320	6531200	like music, it was a Tyco, Nutatrician song and all that good stuff.
6531200	6531700	Yeah.
6532000	6534000	And that series always had an Epic soundtrack to it.
6534000	6537520	So, uh, now you can have Epic music for when you're driving down the freeway.
6537600	6541040	Don't get me driving with Edge of Soul playing because I will speed.
6541040	6541540	All right.
6541600	6545840	Uh, last chance to, uh, if you're participating live, uh, Twitch is your
6545840	6548320	last chance to contribute to the community gift chest.
6548320	6551360	Uh, I'm going to ask Bobby to hit the button after we're done with release
6551360	6553040	dates to make it rain.
6553040	6556880	So that'll be, uh, after we, um, do this in a minute there.
6556880	6560960	So, um, all right, let's move on to release dates.
6560960	6562640	And I think this will be a quick segment here.
6562640	6567280	So, uh, Loki, you don't say, uh, so this week we only have one game coming
6567280	6572960	out and it's brain age, Nintendo switch training in the U S on in the U S.
6573920	6576400	I didn't know they ever confirmed that that was even happening in the U S.
6577600	6578480	Apparently it is.
6578480	6578800	Sorry.
6578800	6580000	I just got excited for a minute.
6580000	6581280	There was brain age games were fun.
6581280	6582400	They were silly, but they were fun.
6583120	6583600	Wow.
6583600	6584240	Okay, cool.
6584960	6586160	I didn't know what was happening here.
6586160	6586660	That's great.
6587200	6587520	All right.
6587520	6591120	Well, let's, let's travel to Japan and check out what else is coming out there.
6591120	6594560	So, um, there are a few more releases in Japan cause it's a little, little
6594560	6596400	different, uh, the way the holidays work.
6596400	6602000	So, uh, on, uh, we get the brain training in Japan as well on December 27th.
6602000	6604400	That is the thing that's happening on December 25th.
6604400	6606880	You can check out at layer dusk trilogy, deluxe packs.
6606880	6609280	Maybe it's only gonna be like digital over here or something like that.
6609280	6610240	Yeah, maybe that's the deal.
6610240	6611040	I don't know.
6611040	6614080	So anyway, but those are, those are the big releases on the switch this week.
6614080	6617120	And then if we look at the PlayStation four, uh, on the PlayStation four,
6617120	6621040	those at layer games, uh, and the trilogy pack that is also happening in Japan
6621040	6621680	this week.
6621680	6622880	So it is a slower week.
6622880	6625600	I mean, they still, they still, they have Christmas in Japan.
6625600	6629840	It's just not quite like the, the whole entire world stops.
6629840	6631920	Like it does here in Japan, right?
6631920	6633760	It's more of, it's, it's a cake celebration, right?
6633760	6634560	There's a Christmas cake.
6635280	6635520	Yeah.
6636320	6638000	Like a strawberry white cake.
6638000	6638400	Yes.
6638400	6639200	It looks delicious.
6639200	6640160	I'd love to have a Christmas cake.
6640720	6641200	Anyhow.
6641200	6643040	Um, how about the UK dark soccer?
6643040	6645280	No, like seriously?
6645280	6647200	No, nothing coming out in the UK.
6647200	6651920	No, nothing on there until January 2nd, which is brain training.
6651920	6658400	Uh, and Akuma JP is actually in chat saying, uh, yes, no holiday.
6658400	6662560	And then G GTR says it's kind of big in Japan, especially with KFC.
6662560	6664720	So I wonder if it's one of those things where like,
6664720	6667600	they're just playing into the rest of the world.
6667600	6667840	Yeah.
6667840	6669440	It's like a marketing type of thing.
6669440	6673920	Kind of like, I'm trying to think of an equivalent that we do in the Cinco de Mayo.
6676160	6676480	Right.
6676480	6678160	But KFC is a thing.
6678160	6678960	Yeah, no, I know.
6678960	6679840	And Christmas cake.
6679840	6680240	I know.
6680240	6681280	That's what we should do.
6681280	6683920	Let's have KFC Christmas.
6683920	6684560	On Christmas.
6684560	6685840	Is that even open?
6685840	6690560	We'll get, well, you know what I would prefer though to KFC would be Jollibee.
6691520	6692640	Jollibee is fucking amazing.
6692640	6693840	Isn't there a Jollibee in Elk Grove?
6693840	6694240	Yeah.
6694240	6695120	Um, South sack.
6695120	6696000	You have to see if it's open.
6696720	6700080	I used to, when I would have to go to the doctor, I would actually go pick up my lunch
6700080	6701840	from Jollibee and go to work with it.
6701840	6702080	Okay.
6702080	6707440	So I would have to say the, uh, the only equivalent I can think of that would be Cinco de Mayo.
6707440	6710960	It's not a holiday at all here, but we completely appropriate it
6711920	6712960	and fuck it up and fuck it up.
6712960	6718880	And it's just, it becomes tequila holiday and all this, you know, that's, that's
6718880	6719920	to quote the meme.
6720560	6724320	Do you ever go what the fuck white people, even though you are white people?
6724320	6724880	Oh, you know what?
6724880	6726080	Act F just mentioned this too.
6726080	6729680	It's Cinco de Mayo is like, not even that big a holiday in Mexico either.
6729680	6731920	Well, honestly, it's like Hanukkah.
6731920	6733440	Hanukkah is not a fucking big holiday.
6733440	6734960	It's not even in Torah.
6734960	6735600	No, you're right.
6735600	6735920	You're right.
6735920	6737040	That's a good example.
6737200	6746640	An apocryphal tale in the tale of the Maccabees, but it's culturally significant because it
6746640	6749280	had to do with reclaiming the temple from Rome.
6750000	6750960	So just saying.
6750960	6752720	Well, and it's also, I mean, let's be real.
6752720	6755600	It's also so that the Jewish kids don't feel left out on Christmas.
6755600	6757920	That's a big part of made a big deal because of that.
6757920	6758480	Yeah.
6758480	6758720	Yeah.
6758720	6762800	I don't know if that game's coming out in the U S now because I even looked on, it made
6762800	6763440	me curious.
6763440	6767200	I checked on Nintendo site and they only even listed as a title coming out.
6767200	6767360	Okay.
6767360	6771600	So maybe somehow because it's, it's snuck onto that list because it's coming down the
6771600	6774160	UK though on the 3rd of January.
6774160	6774560	Huh?
6774560	6775040	Interesting.
6776000	6776500	All right.
6777280	6777760	Okay.
6777760	6779680	Well, uh, that's it for release dates.
6779680	6781520	So, uh, Bobby, make it rain, please.
6781520	6784480	When you hear this message and we'll give out those gifts in the community gift chest.
6784480	6788800	So enjoy for those illegal legends players, I'm sure, uh, you guys will appreciate that.
6788800	6789200	Okay.
6789200	6791200	So let's go to the mailbag every week.
6791200	6795280	You guys send us emails, participate at orange lounge trader.com is the place to send us
6795280	6795840	emails.
6795840	6797360	And I think we have one or two tonight.
6798720	6803040	One, which I'm trying to get back to you because I'm now explaining Hanukkah to people.
6803840	6811200	Um, so, uh, we have one from Martin from Belgium, who we haven't heard from for a long time.
6811840	6815360	Um, hello, Martin from Belgium, Belgium here.
6815360	6819600	I just wanted to wish you all a happy belated 800th birthday.
6820240	6820720	Thank you.
6820720	6824320	I have to say, I really appreciate you guys always being there on the podcast to cheer
6824320	6825520	up my Monday mornings.
6825520	6829200	Listening to the podcast was like comfort food for my ears, especially when I'm having
6829200	6830240	a bad day.
6830240	6831040	Thank you so much.
6831040	6832400	And keep up the great work.
6832400	6833920	Martin from Belgium.
6833920	6835040	I like seeing his name.
6835040	6836160	That's no question.
6836160	6838640	No, no, just, just, just feel love.
6838640	6839120	Thank you.
6839920	6842160	Well, that is a, that is a holiday gift in itself.
6842160	6842800	Thank you so much.
6843440	6844320	And that's it.
6844320	6845120	No more emails.
6845120	6845520	Wow.
6845520	6846000	All right.
6847040	6848400	Are you going to have some of his that's nuts?
6848400	6850240	I was going to have some of his that's nuts.
6850240	6850480	Yeah.
6850480	6850960	They're good.
6850960	6851920	They're delicious nuts.
6851920	6852720	All right.
6852720	6858240	Anyway, uh, for those in the podcast, he's actually got the little bag of, uh, they're,
6858240	6860080	they're candy pecans in reality, right?
6860080	6860880	They're praline pecans.
6860880	6861280	Or excuse you.
6861280	6862080	Yeah, pralines.
6862080	6862720	It's the time.
6862720	6866480	It's basically, it's like a pie without the crust is really what it and the gooeyness.
6866480	6867520	Yeah, exactly.
6867520	6869840	I am still working on my latkes by the way.
6869840	6870160	Yeah.
6870160	6873120	That's how long it takes me to eat anything now is good stuff.
6873120	6875440	Anyway, I feel so fat.
6875440	6876240	All right, let's move on.
6876240	6879360	We got some more news to get to, and then we'll see if anyone wants to call in via our
6879360	6883040	discord server over at vognetwork.com slash discord.
6883040	6885280	So whoops, I've been slacking off on the sidebar there.
6885280	6886800	So we're done with release dates.
6886800	6887840	We're done with the mailbag.
6887840	6889200	Let's get to the next story.
6889200	6889680	Loki.
6890240	6890640	All right.
6891440	6896240	This is a pretty cool, like unnecessary update, but it's something that was added to No Man's
6896240	6903760	Sky and it's these little music synthesizers that you can actually put your own music in.
6904640	6910240	So basically it allows you to kind of, um, make different musical tracks.
6911600	6912560	The hell are you doing over there?
6912560	6913440	I'm hoarding the nuts.
6914400	6915520	Fondling the nuts over there.
6916480	6925200	Um, so you can actually kind of, um, actually put out your own set of, um, chords and stuff
6925200	6927200	in there to be able to make your own tracks.
6927200	6930720	And then you can link several of them together to actually make music.
6930720	6933280	So Pete, that's what people have been doing is making music with them.
6933280	6938560	And then on top of that, you can also wire them to different lights and effects to kind
6938560	6940160	of synchronize everything.
6940160	6946480	And so of course people have used it to like make all sorts of, um, you know, cool music
6946480	6946960	things.
6946960	6953520	They've also done like little like dance club type stuff in there, but it's pretty sweet
6953520	6954800	and free.
6955440	6956880	Can't complain with free.
6956880	6960560	So it'd be interesting how creative people get with this.
6960560	6962560	My how far this game has come.
6962560	6963120	Yeah.
6963120	6968720	I mean, talk about a story of the decade of sorts, you know, just the, this game coming
6968720	6971280	out and it's just the whipping boy, the entire community.
6971280	6976080	And now the place that it's at is just, you know, this big supreme creative outlet.
6976080	6977280	It's so interesting.
6977280	6979600	So I need to get back in.
6979600	6983040	I keep seeing it in my steam library, taunting me, like, come play this.
6983040	6983360	Oh yeah.
6983360	6985360	I bought that on steam too.
6985360	6986000	Get in on that.
6986000	6987280	Cause I forgot all about it.
6987280	6989680	Alan was playing it hella for a little bit too.
6989680	6992800	And, um, the two of us have our little bases on a planet somewhere.
6992800	6995760	So, um, come find us in the universe.
6995760	6996400	We're somewhere.
6997040	6997360	All right.
6998880	6999200	Oh yeah.
6999200	7000640	I forgot about that too.
7000640	7000880	Hmm.
7001600	7002160	Oh wow.
7002160	7005920	All these games that like, Hey, you bought this back here and you haven't really played
7005920	7007920	it like mosh pit simulator.
7007920	7009040	Totally forgot about that.
7009040	7010720	Oh, how steam tells you about all the games.
7010720	7011440	DuckTales or Mastered.
7011440	7013840	Don't remember buying that, but I have it.
7014640	7015760	There's no man's sky.
7016880	7017360	There you go.
7018000	7022400	Well, a game that I know you've been a little better about playing is Pokemon go.
7022400	7025840	And, uh, we have some information about things that have updated in Pokemon go.
7025840	7030560	So if you haven't played that in a little while, you might've missed a few things.
7030560	7035520	Uh, the big holiday edition that they put into the game was expanding the buddy adventure.
7036080	7039760	So now you no longer just walk your buddy for candy.
7039760	7044960	Your buddy plays a role basically with you and you can actually, uh, feed them berries.
7045200	7046080	And it'll grow.
7046080	7047280	They'll get hearts from that.
7047920	7050960	And you increase your friendship level with the buddy Pokemon.
7050960	7053760	And as you increase that level, you get certain perks.
7053760	7057920	For example, the Pokemon may try to help you catch Pokemon in the wild.
7057920	7061200	Uh, your buddy Pokemon will also increase its CP.
7061840	7065120	So, but you have to get, you have to get a really, you have to get a four star buddy
7065120	7069440	for that to actually happen for you to actually get an increased in the amount that they battle.
7069440	7070720	But you can do all sorts of things.
7070720	7073840	You can take the buddy into AR mode and you play with it by like,
7073840	7076240	by just like doing like scratching under its chin or whatever.
7076240	7078480	And it will be happy and reward you with hearts.
7078480	7080960	Uh, and it'll follow you around on the map too, which is really cool.
7080960	7084480	So it's kind of a throwback to, um, when Pikachu would follow you around.
7084480	7090000	But have a really shitty buddy right now that I was walking with just to get some more candies.
7090000	7090240	Yeah.
7090240	7094960	That's the only bummer is that now I'm not walking stuff to get candy to evolve anymore.
7094960	7098560	Now I'm like, Oh, I want to walk my a hundred percent Tyranitar.
7098560	7101760	So when I need to sub them in, he'll have that increased CP.
7102720	7104240	That's that's what I'm doing now.
7104240	7106160	So, um, yeah, that's kind of a fun thing.
7106160	7107840	But then what I think is also really cool.
7107840	7110160	And this just came out within the past couple days.
7110800	7114400	Now they have a, um, this whole thing, this AR kit.
7114400	7119360	And I haven't been able to play with this yet, but apparently now you can take pictures
7119360	7125680	of your buddy and your buddy's buddy at the same time in the same space.
7125680	7129520	So it's like AR plus where now, so I guess, you know, when you're starting to see some of this
7129520	7132880	in your Minecraft earth as you're playing it, is that the things you're doing can affect other
7132880	7133520	people too.
7133520	7136720	So now Pokemon go is doing that a little bit with the Pokemon.
7136720	7138560	So that's really cool.
7138560	7139680	So yeah.
7139680	7143520	And there's a whole little trailer and that shows off the buddy adventures.
7143520	7147920	And it honestly makes the world look like detective Pikachu where everybody has it because
7147920	7148160	right.
7148160	7151280	And detective Pikachu, like everybody has a buddy Pokemon, right?
7151280	7157200	So, um, if you could pick any Pokemon as your buddy, Pokemon IRL, who would your buddy
7157200	7157760	Pokemon be?
7158640	7159200	I don't know.
7159760	7160720	Espeon.
7160720	7161280	Espeon.
7161280	7161840	Oh, good pick.
7161840	7162080	Why?
7162800	7163760	Because it's pretty.
7164400	7168320	Although I do like Makuhita who I would just like take a nap on.
7169600	7170560	So yeah, Espeon.
7171200	7174400	Um, honestly it's hard to not say Jigglypuff.
7174400	7178640	Like I just, I, I relate with Jigglypuff on a, on a scale.
7178640	7180560	So I think Jigglypuff would be mine.
7181280	7183280	I'm looking in com, uh, chat for some comments.
7183280	7185120	VGRealness says Butterfree.
7185120	7186960	ActDeaf says Vulpix.
7186960	7191840	Akuma says Kabigon, which I don't know which one that translates to in the US.
7193040	7194960	Bonds006 says Geodude.
7196800	7199360	Bobby Blackwolf says, I'm still walking a Magikarp.
7199360	7202320	Hey Mag, I've seen people use Magikarp as their buddy.
7202320	7207680	You know, increase that friendship level and then evolve it into a, um, uh, not a super
7207680	7208320	Magikarp.
7208320	7209360	Kabigon is Snorlax.
7209360	7210080	Gyarados.
7210080	7210960	Thank you, Gyarados.
7210960	7211920	Why can't I remember?
7211920	7214560	Kabigon is, uh, Snorlax.
7214560	7216160	Snorlax is super cute too.
7216960	7220800	I have a hundred percent Snorlax and that'll probably be the one I do after, um, my Tyranitar.
7220800	7223760	Did you see that big Snorlax, uh, beanbag bed?
7223760	7224480	Yes.
7224480	7224800	Want.
7225680	7226240	So cute.
7227360	7227760	All right.
7229280	7231120	Anyhow, those are some updates in Pokemon Go.
7231840	7232640	Dark Sakura.
7233440	7236560	This, this game just keeps delivering week after week.
7236560	7236960	Literally.
7236960	7238320	It keeps on giving.
7238320	7240000	We just talked about this last week.
7240000	7240480	We did.
7240480	7243680	So that's why I wanted to bring it up again, but more.
7245600	7253600	So, um, Lance McDonald, modern extreme, has finally gotten us out of the endless hallway
7253600	7257440	of PT and took us onto the streets of Silent Hill.
7258480	7264880	So, um, which, I mean, he's the same one who brought up the stuff that you talked about
7264880	7271040	last week about Lisa following you and that you are playing as Norman Reedus as a character,
7271040	7276240	you know, but to do what he did, there were a few discoveries in there.
7276240	7278160	I've watched the video a couple of times last night.
7278160	7281440	There's some really just cool stuff going on with it.
7281440	7290000	So what happens is, um, the, the, the, the hallway and the, the town exists on two different
7290000	7295760	maps and your link is going to be from that main little room that you start off with.
7295760	7304320	So what he did was rekey that intro room, that, that basement room to, um, let you out onto
7304320	7305200	the streets.
7305200	7308640	Now the first discovery is that the floor has no collision detection.
7308640	7311040	You fall right through it, but guess what happens?
7311040	7312320	Lisa comes and eats you.
7313040	7315280	Like what happens if she catches you in the house.
7315840	7320240	So it's, I guess to prevent you from like, if you inadvertently ended up on the map by
7320240	7324800	some glitch, you know, other than doing it on purpose, then it's to prevent your game
7324800	7326160	from soft locking or whatever.
7326960	7332800	So, um, the other, so what he did is he programmed in like a float so that your character floats
7332800	7333680	above the ground.
7333680	7339920	So you go out and on the street and it's just really exploring just how highly detailed
7339920	7340640	these streets are.
7340720	7346000	Like you do get like behind a van and some of the cars are textured as well, but like
7346000	7351680	he floated up to the balcony and showed a full street scene and it was just really intense.
7351680	7356720	I mean, and it's a good, like three blocks of distance that's rendered.
7356720	7357120	Yeah.
7357120	7361360	And your final barrier is like literally a fence at the end of it.
7361360	7365120	Although it looks like you can go around the fence, but it's a full, it's a full game
7365120	7365520	barrier.
7366080	7370000	But, um, it's, it's also interesting because it points out that that trailer you essentially
7370000	7373120	see at the end of the game is being rendered in re in the game engine.
7373120	7374720	It's not like a cut scene or something.
7374720	7379040	And on top of that, you have that blood trail right at the beginning of it.
7379040	7382160	It has, um, a lot of clutter in the environment.
7382160	7383600	So it's like all these props.
7384240	7391360	It made me think that this was actually part of what was actually started to be rendered
7391360	7392560	for Silent Hills for sure.
7392560	7395760	And Bobby in chat says they were probably building that out for the full game.
7395760	7396260	Absolutely.
7397140	7403460	Uh, it's definitely worth everyone finding that, that trailer and watching it, but it
7403460	7405380	was found by Lance McDonald.
7405380	7409300	The, um, uh, handle on Twitter is man fight dragon.
7410500	7417460	And, um, one of the things is that someone asked him how many jumpscares did Lisa get
7417460	7419060	with you for the making of this video?
7419620	7422020	And his response was she does the jump scare.
7422020	7425860	Anytime you mess with the player location without applying a special fix to make the
7425860	7427460	game think you're on the ground.
7427460	7428180	It's hard to predict.
7428180	7431780	And I screamed multiple times while getting a few of the overhead camera shots for the
7431780	7432280	video.
7433220	7437300	That's interesting that they kind of built in the Lisa thing, like just in case someone
7437300	7440500	got out, but somebody kind of found a work around that.
7440500	7441540	That's really neat.
7441540	7441780	Yeah.
7441780	7444180	It's still freaking creeps me out though, man.
7444180	7446900	And everybody still wonders like, where is this game?
7446900	7449860	We never did get to see, you know, it's just, it's sad.
7449860	7451780	Well, it's on made, it's on made.
7451780	7452660	So it's sad.
7453460	7460020	What I would like to see is that instead of having, cause I think that the, um, I don't
7460020	7464580	know if people are actually able to pull legit assets for it, for the Mac and PC, you know,
7464580	7471140	simulations of PT that they did, but I would like for people to pull more of these resources
7471140	7473060	and actually like make something with it.
7473060	7473860	It would be nice.
7473860	7479620	You know, I, this is what could have been, and my hope is that whatever this horror thing
7479620	7484420	that Kojima has in mind, that it's going to be a true spiritual successor to the silent
7484420	7486180	Hill franchise called Konami will Sue.
7487380	7490100	Well, I mean, and I talked about this already on the show, so I don't want to repeat myself
7490100	7495460	too much, but I just want it to be true that Konami is just gonna realize that there's
7495460	7499300	more money to be had by just letting somebody else borrow the IP and make a good game with
7499300	7501300	it and just trying to mend the fences and make it happen.
7501300	7503620	But I'm not going to hold my breath either.
7503620	7505940	There is, there's a lot more drama.
7505940	7513780	If you go watch the theories behind representation in PT, there's a lot that correlates to Kojima's
7513780	7519700	experience there and him trying to leave clues to bypass his NDA without doing it.
7520260	7524340	And I mean, it is a little bit conspiracy theorist, you know, talk, but a lot of it
7524340	7527940	does make sense, especially with what we know now after the fact.
7527940	7533860	And the whole thing with Konami is that he was the only, I think, person on their board
7533860	7539540	that wasn't like one of the like original or in the family or something about it.
7539540	7543860	So he was always seen as an outsider amongst the powers that be at Konami.
7543860	7552100	So definitely, if I can find that thing, the little video that I found before, I will try
7552100	7554660	to post it up on my Twitter at Dark Sakura.
7554660	7555160	Cool.
7555860	7556420	All right.
7556420	7558820	Well, just a few more stories for you guys before we get to Discord.
7558820	7559320	Loki.
7560100	7560600	All right.
7561480	7567160	So we were talking about Stadia a little bit ago and how there's not really a whole ton
7567160	7568760	of things coming out on Stadia.
7569320	7571800	Well, they're hoping to change that.
7571800	7579000	So now Google is actually planning on beefing up their library by purchasing some studios.
7579000	7584760	So they've done this with Typhoon Studios and Typhoon Studios, of course, is an indie
7584760	7590760	studio that's created by some veterans from other games that you might know, including
7590760	7594120	Batman Arkham City, Far Cry 4 and the such.
7594760	7600920	They're planning on releasing their first game, Journey to the Savage Planet, and they're
7600920	7607240	going to be joining existing Stadia games and entertainment studio in Montreal.
7607800	7613400	So no word on what exactly they're going to be developing, but it is going to be some
7613400	7614040	new games.
7615560	7618840	Which is good because right now we only know one kind of exclusive game and don't really
7618840	7621560	know much about it and don't know when the hell it's coming up.
7622280	7626520	VG Realness in our chat saying my question to Google and Stadia, why did they not have
7626520	7627880	these studios planned out already?
7627880	7629080	Seems like an afterthought.
7630520	7635640	Yeah, unless Google is committing to the long game here with this, which we still don't
7635640	7636760	know if we can trust them to do that.
7636760	7640280	They were hoping for more third party support and just didn't get it.
7640280	7641560	So now they got to go buy their own?
7642200	7642700	Maybe.
7642700	7643200	Maybe.
7643560	7644440	That could be a part of it.
7645480	7649800	And yeah, I mean, you saw Microsoft making these moves a couple of years ago, and now
7649800	7652120	we're going to see that payoff next year.
7652120	7653400	Hopefully, fingers crossed.
7653400	7658040	I mean, I'm expecting big things for Microsoft for E3, so we'll see what happens with that.
7658040	7661160	So do you think they might bring Scalebound back?
7662200	7664920	That rumor always shows its face in one way or another.
7664920	7665420	All right.
7666600	7667100	All right.
7667880	7671560	One more story for you guys, and it's about yet another TV service.
7671560	7673160	Oh, this is one that I don't have.
7673160	7678120	We were trying to talk about, because Dark Soccer wanted to borrow my CBS for reasons.
7678120	7680360	And she's like, well, do you have Netflix?
7680360	7681000	Yep, I have Netflix.
7681000	7681480	Do you have Hulu?
7681480	7683960	Yep, I have Hulu, because Alan gets the Hulu.
7683960	7688200	And so I feel like nobody has CBS.
7688200	7693480	I have the CBS because I got it for Star Trek and maybe to watch Trashy Big Brother.
7693480	7697160	At least, it was really bad this last year.
7697160	7700760	I didn't watch it this last year, but it's also how I catch up on Survivor sometimes.
7700760	7707160	But anyway, Apple TV, one of the other services out there, I haven't heard a lot about except
7707160	7710520	for apparently that newsroom show that they have is apparently really good, a lot of people
7710520	7711480	talking about it.
7711480	7712680	And they're going to be having another show.
7712680	7713640	What's that have to do with video games?
7713640	7717160	Because they're going to be having another show coming out on February 7th, and it is
7717160	7718440	a video game spoof show.
7718440	7723480	It's called Mythic Quest, not Mystic Quest, but Mythic Quest Ravens Banquet.
7724200	7727880	And there's going to be nine episodes that will be released on February 7th.
7727880	7730760	And what I think is kind of interesting about it, you know, you might be kind of rolling
7730760	7732760	your eyes like, oh, God, video game parody.
7732760	7739480	But the creators of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Rob McElhenny and Charlie Day.
7739480	7740520	We've heard about this already.
7740520	7741160	I think so.
7741160	7743400	But now we're getting something that is coming out February 7th.
7743400	7744520	We know that it's coming out.
7744520	7747880	And I don't think we knew it was Apple TV before.
7747880	7748200	Maybe we did.
7748200	7748680	Yes, we did.
7748680	7749400	Did we?
7749400	7754760	OK, well, so there's that because It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia is one of those shows
7754760	7759480	that's kind of like I'm laughing so hard at this, even though it's like kind of terrible,
7759480	7761720	but like in a really funny way.
7761720	7766520	So I know I hope it's like I hope I hope it's funny like that, but we'll see.
7767480	7771080	Also, some of the people that are in this, this is what's also kind of weird about this.
7771080	7773560	Some of the people that are involved with it, I want to say, yeah.
7775480	7779960	David Hornsby is in this from from Philadelphia, the movie.
7780840	7784520	I don't remember what part that was, but also in the show, F.
7784520	7790120	Murray Abraham is in this show like every Abraham's got to be in his 70s.
7790120	7792120	He was in like Amadeus, right?
7793800	7795160	So I don't it's it's anyway.
7795160	7799080	Yeah, because this was something that was part of that Ubisoft motion pictures company thing.
7799080	7799400	Yeah.
7799400	7804520	So they talked about it during their their E3 press conference and video game actress
7804520	7809480	Ashley Birch from Horizon Zero Dawn and Life is Strange is also going to be involved with this.
7809480	7811240	So that'll be interesting.
7812120	7814120	Oh, it was an E3 announcement.
7814120	7817240	Azette is asking, is this a The Guild rip off?
7818280	7818920	I don't know.
7818920	7820520	I don't think so.
7820520	7822360	I've never watched The Guild, so I don't know.
7822360	7824200	I've seen some of The Guild. It was cute.
7824200	7827240	I saw the earlier episodes kind of like before it was everywhere.
7827240	7829720	I mean, not to sound hipster about it, but that's the reality.
7829720	7832360	I saw it when you could download the episodes on Xbox 360.
7832360	7834840	That's when I saw I was watching it on YouTube.
7835800	7836920	So back in the day.
7837800	7838600	All right.
7838600	7841240	So there it is, the news for tonight.
7841240	7845400	So if you want to give us a call, you can join our discord over at
7845400	7849880	vognetwork.com slash discord in the green room.
7851000	7852440	Or you can just ask a question.
7852440	7855880	If you have a general question you'd like to put out in chat, you can do that.
7856840	7859320	Otherwise, we'll talk amongst ourselves for a little bit.
7859320	7862600	I'm going to ask if there's any last minute stories, although I know we're looking,
7862600	7865000	but we're scraping the barrel as it is this week.
7865000	7866680	So there is that.
7866680	7868760	Oh, here's a clickbait rumor.
7868760	7869400	Oh no.
7869400	7870120	All right.
7870120	7870760	Fine.
7870760	7871320	Fine.
7871320	7873320	No calls in queue means rumors.
7873320	7874280	Let's do them.
7874280	7877560	There's a rumor that Sumo digital's working on crackdown four.
7878920	7879800	Interesting.
7879800	7884360	When crackdown three seems like it wasn't well received at the end of the day.
7884360	7889080	So you know, what's funny speaking of games that weren't well received.
7889080	7893880	I thought of you Loki today because I saw I was going through the PlayStation store
7893880	7896680	and I saw agents of mayhem for sale for $4.
7897800	7899080	And I was not even worth it for that.
7900600	7902200	I will not play that game.
7902200	7903320	It looks so terrible.
7904920	7907720	As that wants to know who's watched the Witcher on Netflix.
7907720	7908680	I not yet.
7908680	7911160	I intended to today and didn't get around to it.
7911160	7914280	So soon as that you liked it though, right?
7915400	7918840	Dark to see us as just the first episode and as that says liked it.
7918840	7921640	So apparently the critics hated it though.
7921640	7922600	Well, they don't count.
7923880	7927160	Well, the one review I was reading where they gave it an F was like,
7927160	7929240	we didn't even bother to watch every episode.
7929240	7932920	And I was kind of like, isn't that kind of fucking idiot shitty?
7932920	7935240	Like, isn't that like what you're supposed to not do?
7935240	7937080	At least they said so in the article.
7937080	7939000	So you can see that means their opinion doesn't count.
7939000	7939500	Yeah.
7940120	7944360	So, um, but then a lot of the same stuff's happening with Star Wars, right?
7944360	7948040	Like a lot of critics don't like it, but they feel like audiences are really divided.
7948040	7950920	Like I've heard people that are like, I love it.
7950920	7953720	I've heard a few that are like, I don't love it.
7954120	7957000	Um, I don't, you know what, I'm not even going to,
7957800	7962840	I'll say it next week when I don't have to be as like crazy about spoilers.
7962840	7965320	I haven't seen it, but just kind of like something I've heard about it.
7965320	7967720	And I don't want to, I don't want to even remotely go into spoilers,
7967720	7972920	but maybe in a week after all the hardcore fans have seen it, I'll do very light spoilers.
7972920	7977560	So, but I won't do that tonight because I know people are hypersensitive about spoilers and
7977560	7979720	some people might be waiting until Christmas.
7979720	7985080	So, well, I can see that we have one of our favorite spoilers waiting in the green room
7985080	7985560	right now.
7985560	7988760	So let's see if we can get them on the show right now.
7988760	7989320	Hi there.
7989320	7990360	You're on orange launch radio.
7990360	7990760	Who's this?
7991720	7995640	Hi, it's Jim Sally trying to figure out how to shut off his other thing that's talking.
7997960	7998840	Hey, Jim Sally.
7998840	7999640	It's good to hear from you.
7999640	8002200	It's a holiday miracle to have you here on the show.
8002200	8003880	Oh, isn't it, man?
8003880	8005080	Sunday nights are tough.
8005240	8006600	How would you sometimes, brother?
8007160	8008120	They're tough for you.
8009960	8014920	I get my fucking Sunday nights when I get my shit together, you know, family gets together.
8014920	8017880	We eat big meals and we fucking pass out on the couch, man.
8017880	8021640	I do pass out listening to you guys sometimes snuggling away.
8024760	8026280	How are you going to spend your holiday week?
8026280	8028280	Is there lots of snuggling planned for your holiday week?
8028840	8030760	There's lots of snuggling planned for the holiday week.
8030760	8031720	The kids are in the house.
8032040	8038760	Unfortunately, we had, my little girl had a, long story short, she got a therapy cat
8038760	8041160	to help her with some emotional issues.
8041160	8047880	And the poor thing passed away with some kidney failure at like seven weeks, seven weeks old.
8047880	8051160	Well, we only had him for seven weeks and the poor cat passed away.
8051160	8052280	It's so sad.
8052280	8053400	But we live in a small town.
8053400	8056760	So we just went on Facebook and it was like, boom, a week later, new cat, bam.
8056760	8057640	You know what I mean?
8057640	8060840	You do make a little ofrenda for the old cat, you know?
8061640	8063320	I gave her some, I got it.
8063320	8064360	Listen, don't tell her.
8065080	8067720	I told her I got her cremated, but I just took it.
8069560	8070360	Oh, okay.
8071480	8074120	Wait, but is there, I thought you were whispering because maybe
8074120	8076600	there might be a holiday miracle with a new cat?
8077800	8079160	No, she already got the new cat.
8079160	8079960	I just picked it up.
8080760	8082120	Like, so that's what we're doing this week.
8082120	8084760	We're snuggling a new little black, new little black kitten.
8085560	8085960	Got it.
8085960	8086600	Man, it's weird.
8086600	8088280	It's weird the things you do for little kids, man.
8088360	8091240	I'm telling you right now, there's no fucking way farm boy Jim Sally was
8091240	8094600	going to let a goddamn cat shit in a box inside my house.
8095960	8102680	This fucking thing shits in a box inside my house and then looks to me like I owe it a treat.
8102680	8103560	Fuck you.
8103560	8105320	The things you do for little kids.
8105320	8107640	How about the things you do for 40 year old men?
8107640	8112520	Like Alan and I have a cat and it's just off camera where his potty is.
8112520	8114600	Like it's right on the other side of the wall.
8116280	8117880	Dude, I'm telling you 40, man.
8118440	8119640	You want to hear something crazy?
8121240	8123560	Jim Sally's hitting that 40 bell next month, man.
8124200	8127960	Well, happy early birthday to you.
8127960	8129000	Hey, you know what?
8129000	8132040	Like 40 is kind of like, it's a whatever.
8132040	8136440	Like honestly, turning 40 was a big whatever for me because like for all the hype and all
8136440	8141720	the talk about like, oh my God, when you tune 30, like if you don't have XYZ accomplished
8141720	8145720	and like all these things that, you know, like our parents put that type of pressure on us,
8145720	8147560	then like you're a horrible failure.
8147560	8151880	And as it turns out, like my 30s, I didn't really have any of those things you were supposed
8151880	8152520	to have.
8152520	8156200	And like my 30s overall were actually a lot better than my 20s.
8156200	8160280	Like in my 20s, I was still like, I was like weird.
8160280	8160840	You know what?
8160840	8163240	And I feel like in my 30s, I finally got my shit together.
8163240	8167000	My mom never gave me shit because you know what I would turn around and say, how old
8167000	8167800	were you when you had me?
8170280	8172680	It's so interesting that we come from like two extremes, right?
8172680	8175720	Your mom had you at a very young age.
8175720	8182920	And my mom, yeah, my mom had me at 38, which in the 70s was a very old age to be having
8182920	8183240	children.
8183240	8186680	Like I know nowadays what Janet Jackson had to get at 50.
8186680	8188840	Uh, what's her name from Flavor Love?
8188840	8189640	Let's wait a while.
8191320	8195640	She's having a kid at 50 with shit like targeted MRI and fucking prenatal drugs and stuff,
8195640	8196120	man.
8196120	8196360	True.
8196360	8198520	Your mom is doing that shit in the 70s, man.
8198520	8199960	No, no, no.
8200280	8204200	Here's the crazy thing about that.
8204200	8210440	They were told in the, in the 60s, they were told that they couldn't have kids.
8210440	8213880	So they adopted and they, they tried and they didn't.
8213880	8216520	And so they adopted, they just went to adoption.
8216520	8218680	They, they adopted my brother and my sister.
8218680	8224360	And then good for them and they weren't even trying years later out of the blue.
8224360	8229320	Like just like they did not think we were going to have a kid or try just, it just fucking
8229320	8230040	happened.
8230040	8231080	Hi, here I am.
8231080	8233720	So, um, I was a surprise.
8234520	8235240	Surprise.
8235240	8236280	I was surprised too.
8237480	8240040	So, but we were two very different types of surprises.
8240040	8241720	I think there were drugs involved with me.
8241720	8241960	Yeah.
8242680	8246360	Well, no, I know my daddy was doing some acid.
8246360	8248360	Oh, oh.
8248360	8250280	And pixel pocket saying, I didn't know that Rob.
8250280	8251800	My mom had me at 37.
8251800	8252120	Yep.
8252120	8252600	In a row.
8253880	8259080	So now, now I'm thinking, oh my God, like I'm older than my mom was when she had me
8259160	8262280	and I still don't have kids, but I'm like, okay, I'm, I made peace with it.
8262280	8263800	Like I kind of don't want them at this point.
8263800	8265240	I have kids and guess what?
8265240	8267160	Now I can't on purpose.
8267160	8269160	Other people's kids are great.
8269160	8272360	I can appreciate Loki's children from a distance.
8273160	8274360	I hung out with Julian today.
8274360	8276040	I can appreciate him from a distance as well.
8276600	8277720	I hung out with Julian.
8279720	8281880	He's graduated from being Mr.
8281880	8283960	Boy to young sir.
8283960	8286120	Oh, he's going to be 13 next year.
8286120	8287480	Oh, well hell.
8288440	8289000	Here you go.
8289640	8290600	Sorry, Jim Sally.
8290600	8293560	We somehow derailed the Jim Sally train with a tangent train of our own.
8293560	8294440	Haha.
8294440	8294600	Yeah.
8298680	8300360	So technically it's a gaming show.
8300360	8303000	I should ask you, are there any games you've been playing lately?
8304520	8307080	I finally got to the end of Fallout 4.
8307080	8311160	Now I think it's an old game, so I can spoil the ending a little bit at this stage in the
8311160	8312920	game, have a little chitchat.
8312920	8313720	I don't think it's fine.
8313720	8316440	If you haven't beat Fallout 4 yet by now, people fuck off.
8316520	8317000	Okay.
8318280	8318520	Okay.
8319480	8323560	At the end of the, in the middle of the game, you find out that this dude who's an old man
8323560	8326120	running the Institute is actually your son from a long time ago.
8326120	8327720	And he was kind of fucking me around a little bit.
8327720	8329080	And then at the end, he's in a chair.
8329080	8332840	And I did the Jim Sally thing that I haven't done for a long time in a Fallout game.
8332840	8339080	I stabbed him in the belly as many times as I could before he had a chance to say a word.
8339080	8340520	Just to see what would happen.
8340520	8341320	And he died.
8341880	8346200	And then I beat the game and it was all like, war, shit, war, war.
8346200	8346760	Don't have a war.
8346760	8347880	You walk with your dog or whatever.
8347880	8348920	You're like, fuck that shit.
8348920	8352280	And now I finally come back to the Fallout that I love.
8352280	8358440	And I just marauder my way from town to town murdering people, murdering them.
8358440	8359800	And you know what I found out?
8359800	8362040	There's this thing called God Mode.
8362040	8363480	They put on some of the characters.
8363480	8364280	Did you know about this?
8365480	8367160	No, because I barely played any.
8367160	8368920	I don't know about this because I have mods.
8369240	8374760	Some characters you could stab in the face for days and they just take it and come back
8374760	8375560	for more.
8375560	8378760	Yeah, I imagine they're characters that are essential to completing the story and stuff.
8378760	8379560	Like, they can't die.
8380280	8381720	It's very unsatisfied.
8381720	8382840	It's very unsatisfied.
8382840	8387480	And one night I was wearing my headphones, stabbing an old man in the face repeatedly
8387480	8389240	on the ground while he just cried.
8389240	8390280	I'm just doing it.
8390280	8394200	I was there for like, I want to say, I want to say a good solid 30 seconds of face stabbing.
8394200	8397000	A good solid, you fucking make a good shit in.
8397000	8397560	You know what I mean?
8397640	8398760	Take a shit.
8398760	8400680	Oh, good shivin', right?
8400680	8401960	So I'm shivin' this guy.
8401960	8403560	I'm fucking shivin' him.
8403560	8409400	And then I realized, I realized mid-shiv that my four-year-old Daniel is right behind me
8410040	8412520	watching me shiv this fucker in the face.
8413720	8416760	And he doesn't really know what's going on because I'm wearing headphones, right?
8416760	8418760	Because I don't want to wake them up with the shivadins.
8418760	8420120	With the shivadins late at night.
8420680	8422360	So he asked, what are you doing, daddy?
8423000	8425960	The only thing I could think of was to say, I'm trying to brush his teeth.
8428120	8431160	He says, he says, what?
8431160	8432040	Why?
8432040	8432360	Why?
8432360	8435080	I said, because he didn't brush his teeth when he was a little boy, Daniel.
8435080	8436280	Now look at his mouth.
8436280	8437240	It's all gross.
8437240	8440200	I gotta fix, I gotta fix his teeth.
8440200	8444600	And I'm telling you, he fucking, that kid brushes those teeth to a mirror shine.
8444600	8449640	Now when he gets up in the morning, when he gets up in the morning, I thought, I thought
8449640	8450920	he bought an electric toothbrush.
8450920	8451560	I went upstairs.
8451560	8453320	Motherfucker had my dremel out.
8453320	8454760	Motherfucker had my dremel out.
8454760	8455800	Mirror shine.
8455800	8456840	I said, shit.
8456840	8460680	And that's why people, it's important to, you know, play video games with your kids
8460680	8463960	responsibly and wear headphones and wear headphones.
8465080	8469560	Uh, that was possibly the best holiday lesson we'll ever learn here on Orange Launch Radio.
8469560	8471080	Thank you so much for that.
8471080	8475880	I, I was, I was going to say like, who, who hasn't done like fucked up things in video
8475880	8476200	games?
8476200	8478040	Like that's what Loki lives for.
8478040	8480440	Loki lives for those games that you can do fucked up things.
8480440	8481080	Right.
8481080	8485480	And like, yeah, usually even, even I admit, like when I first played the elder scrolls
8485480	8488840	Oblivion, I'm going back to the one that was launched.
8488840	8489400	Oh yeah.
8489400	8493000	Like the minute you could stab the king, I tried it.
8493000	8496680	Like, you know, I got killed by those guards real fast, but yeah.
8497560	8498760	Fuck you, Patrick Stewart.
8500440	8503160	I just wanted to see if I could do it.
8503160	8505000	Have you ever done it as an accident?
8505000	8507160	Like you meant to hit the button to talk to them.
8507160	8512840	And instead you hit the button for Fus Ro Dah and it's, and I'm like, oops, sorry.
8512840	8513560	Didn't mean to do that.
8513560	8514600	I don't know my own strength.
8515480	8521800	No, I usually play the game with all sorts of exploits in place.
8522440	8527160	I did play with mods on as well before, but like I've played a vanilla, but just exploiting
8527160	8531320	the game through the vanilla means like, you know, finding the merchant chest hidden.
8531320	8537400	Cause there's like, you can go to, you know, in Skyrim, you can go to, I can't remember
8537400	8538120	what it's called now.
8538920	8543080	One of the towns though, and you can easily access the merchant chest and just steal all
8543080	8545240	their stuff out of there and then sell it back to them.
8546360	8550360	And then you, you kill them and then you reload and then you can do it again and again and
8550360	8552600	again and you get infinite money at their body.
8552600	8553560	Yeah, exactly.
8553560	8559960	And then you just let you, you know, do the enchantment potions and spells and you get
8559960	8565720	to the point where your armor, you can have like a carry weight of, you know, infinite
8565720	8568440	amount of items and just crashes the game.
8568440	8569240	Cause you can't sort them.
8569240	8569800	You can't do it.
8570520	8571320	Jim Sally.
8571320	8573640	Hey, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show.
8573640	8577800	But before we do, I have to ask you, do you have any new year's resolutions?
8579080	8579640	Yeah, man.
8579640	8587400	My new year resolution this year is to really try to set some time aside to, you know, start
8587400	8590040	a little archive or something.
8590040	8591320	I got to get my shit together.
8591320	8594920	I just got to find a better Sunday night at fucking midnight to get it going.
8597080	8599640	So I've always started looking for help.
8599640	8600280	Good point.
8601000	8601400	All right.
8601400	8605480	Well, I bet you have a chat room full of people here who love your phone calls.
8605480	8606760	That would be happy to help.
8606760	8609000	However, we can't end it for what it's worth.
8609000	8611640	All of these episodes of the show are archived.
8611640	8616760	So someday when your kid is 18, you can play him the clip of daddy teaching him to brush
8616760	8617260	his teeth.
8617880	8618680	Can you imagine?
8619320	8620680	The psychiatric goes alone.
8622680	8626200	I can't wait for Loki's kids to be old enough to understand this show.
8626280	8631240	I'm this old and don't understand the show.
8632760	8633640	Fair enough.
8633640	8634140	All right.
8635080	8636840	Happy holidays, bitches.
8636840	8637160	All right.
8637160	8638120	Happy holidays, Jim.
8638120	8639160	Sally, thanks for the call.
8639160	8639960	Take care.
8639960	8640680	Take care of my friend.
8641320	8642200	Later, brother.
8642200	8643480	Always, always great to hear from you.
8643480	8643980	Bye bye.
8645640	8646440	That was a treat.
8646440	8649080	That was a holiday miracle right there.
8649080	8649480	All right.
8649480	8653160	I think on that note, we will start to wrap things up here unless Loki found any other
8653160	8655240	last minute stories worth mentioning.
8655240	8659880	It wasn't really worth mentioning, but just as people figured out that Sasha Gray is also
8659880	8663480	now a YouTube gaming streamer and still like that in Twitch as well.
8663480	8663960	Who?
8663960	8665240	Sasha Gray, the porn star.
8666200	8666920	Who?
8666920	8668760	Yeah, she's done things.
8668760	8671480	I mean, she's done like non-porn things.
8671480	8672200	Would I know them?
8673560	8674440	I don't know.
8674440	8676120	She's she's pretty mainstream.
8676120	8676760	Okay.
8676760	8679400	But like everyone's like, Oh my God, what?
8679400	8684200	It's it's a girl that's naked sometimes that likes games like me, like a human being.
8684200	8684920	Oh my God.
8684920	8686360	People like human things.
8686920	8687720	Imagine that.
8687720	8688200	Fancy that.
8688200	8688600	I know.
8688600	8689880	It's just so ridiculous.
8689880	8692280	The celebrities, they're real people too.
8692280	8692840	Who knew?
8692840	8693880	It's like, who cares?
8694840	8695640	All right.
8695640	8699880	Anyhow, on that note, just see, we had Jim Sally call a pornography.
8699880	8700520	I think we're good.
8701240	8706680	So we're going to wrap up and I hope everybody has a great holiday week no matter what it
8706680	8707400	is you celebrate.
8707400	8710520	I'm sure most of you are in the Christmas camp or the Hanukkah camp just because I haven't
8710520	8714120	heard the other ones really coming up in chat, but whatever it is that you're celebrating.
8714200	8718200	I hope you have a wonderful week and, uh, you know, I hope, uh, if you're doing family
8718200	8719800	stuff, I hope family stuff is great.
8719800	8723080	If you don't have a lot of family stuff going on, I hope friends stuff is great.
8723080	8725800	Um, if you don't have a lot of either of those things going on, just cause your friends are
8725800	8728920	out of town or what have you, and you're just, you're sitting around playing video games.
8728920	8732920	I hope that is great too, because this is a great time of year to catch up on that stuff.
8732920	8737240	And if you're working through the holiday, you know, I hope you make some fucking money.
8737240	8738760	I hope you make a lot of fucking money.
8739320	8740440	So that's my goal.
8740440	8741240	Yeah, there you go.
8741240	8743640	So I hope, uh, I hope you don't have any friends at all.
8744280	8747080	Um, where are your friends here at fog network?
8747080	8748760	Unless you're a Nazi then I'll just punch you.
8748760	8749320	All right.
8749320	8751000	Anyhow, uh, we're going to wrap up.
8751000	8753080	Thank you guys so much for listening to orange on radio.
8753080	8754360	We will be back next week.
8754360	8757880	I'm anticipating it's going to be a very light news week, but we will talk about some topics
8757880	8762440	such as looking back on not only this year in gaming, but looking back on the decade in gaming.
8762440	8766040	I'm sure a lot of your favorite gaming podcasts are gonna be doing something very similar,
8766040	8769240	but, uh, we'll do it our way here at orange on radio next week.
8769240	8771560	And if there are any new stories that break, we'll talk about that.
8771560	8774920	We'll get this brain age thing figured out and talk about that next week.
8774920	8777400	Uh, and, uh, yeah, so we'll be back in seven days.
8777400	8780360	If you enjoyed what you heard here at orange on radio, please tell a friend or two about
8780360	8782760	the show because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.
8782760	8786520	But if the voices aren't here to put out on air, what else can we do?
8786520	8787080	We don't have them.
8787080	8789960	So, um, we really appreciate you guys, uh, to help us spread the word.
8789960	8792280	I do have a thing actually, and I almost forgot.
8792280	8795560	I would like for our listeners to send me recipes.
8795560	8796440	Hey, wait a minute.
8796440	8798840	What happened to the last time you asked him to send you stuff?
8799240	8800360	No one fucking did.
8800360	8800600	Yeah.
8800600	8802360	I thought I saw some tweets come through.
8802360	8802680	No.
8802680	8803720	The educational stuff.
8803720	8804520	That's different.
8804520	8806920	I'm going to do a book, an OLR cookbook.
8806920	8807400	Okay.
8807400	8812280	With listeners, favorite recipes with whatever gets made off of it,
8812280	8813640	going to directly benefit the show.
8814280	8816440	As that says, Ooh, baby, what kind of recipes?
8816440	8817880	How about the recipe to your nuts?
8817880	8822280	And if you've got pictures of them, good high resolution pictures of your nuts,
8822280	8824760	of your nuts, go ahead and send them in.
8824760	8832120	You can either DM me on, um, on, uh, the, the Twitters, um, or the Instagrams.
8832760	8837160	I'm at dark soccer, both places, or you can, I guess, send it to our mailbox.
8837160	8840600	And to be clear, because I do not want to be banned on Twitch or violate their
8840600	8841240	terms of service.
8841240	8847160	We are talking about pecans, walnuts, amens, those type of nuts.
8847160	8851560	High resolution pictures of those nuts sent to her GMs.
8851560	8854040	Recipes are what I want.
8854040	8854600	Yes.
8854600	8858200	And I want to thank Brad and Marissa for already sharing some recipes with me.
8858200	8858760	Yay.
8858760	8864440	Um, I would just like specifics, have, have it detailed and send me pictures
8864440	8867960	because then, and express permission to publish these.
8868680	8873000	And that way when the book comes out, I'll make it available for everyone.
8873000	8875800	Anyone who wants to buy a copy of it, just know that the money is going to go
8875800	8877320	back into the OLR budget.
8877320	8878040	Fun.
8878040	8880440	Or bog budget or whatever budget.
8880440	8880600	Yeah.
8880600	8884360	Well, maybe we'd be better to just donate it straight to charity.
8884360	8888200	Just because when it comes to the business things, you know, we'll talk about
8888200	8889080	it off here.
8889080	8889400	All right.
8890120	8893000	So, um, charity is a good thing though, right?
8893000	8899400	We'll donate it to, uh, to the, um, uh, uh, coding for kids stuff.
8900040	8900680	That'd be fun.
8900680	8901000	Yeah.
8901000	8902600	Or, um, extra life.
8902600	8903560	Who would that be going to?
8903560	8904360	Yeah.
8904360	8904760	All right.
8904760	8906440	Anyway, um, let's see.
8906440	8907640	So what was I going to say?
8907640	8907960	Final.
8907960	8908360	Oh yeah.
8908920	8911000	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts and really wrap it up here
8911000	8911400	tonight.
8911400	8913080	So, um, Loki, we'll start with you.
8913080	8914120	What's your final thought here?
8914120	8918840	I hate Christmas and buying things, mainly the spending of the money and the
8918840	8919480	buying things.
8919480	8921320	Not necessarily the Christmas part.
8921320	8924120	It's just, it's expensive.
8924120	8926280	Well, someone's going to get visited by three ghosts tonight.
8927640	8928760	I hope they bring money.
8930440	8933720	No, he won't be because he's not like a wealthy miser.
8935240	8936600	He's not playing his employees.
8938600	8939320	All right.
8939320	8940040	Uh, let's see.
8940040	8943960	My final thought, uh, my final thought is, um, I hope everybody
8943960	8946920	has a great holiday and I look forward to seeing cats.
8946920	8949080	I'm, I'm at the patched version of cat cats.
8949080	8952440	1.1 cats, cats that are patched.
8954520	8957720	I used to actually sing the Gumby cat song to, to share me.
8957720	8961160	Oh, but instead of Jenny, any dots, she was sure me where me pants.
8962520	8966440	Um, so my final thought, thank God for fleece leggings.
8967720	8972680	I'm cold all the fucking time and fleece leggings make me not so cold.
8973320	8973720	Love it.
8974280	8974760	All right.
8974760	8975800	That's going to do it.
8975800	8976840	Have a great one, everybody.
