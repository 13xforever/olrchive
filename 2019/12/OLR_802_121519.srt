Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This week, the ninth generation is as new as it is old because Sony keeps the streak alive and Microsoft continues down a strange path of naming continuity.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:28,000
What, you expected a different headline? Well, stay tuned for tonight's Stories of Plenty starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Live tonight with episode number 802 for this December the 15th of 2019.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
My name is Rob Roberts and together with my co-hosts DarkSakura and TechMasterLoki

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
It's me eating on stream. It's fine. The good news is on the podcast they can't see it. We're celebrating one year here on Twitch.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So we've actually been doing this video thing for one year. I mean technically it's tomorrow but close enough.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
By the time it comes out. Yeah, by the time the podcast is out it'll have been a year that we've moved over from...

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I can't remember the name. I was about to say Live 365. It's been one whole year since we moved from Live 365. Can you believe it?

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Are they still around? No, they finally closed for good. I think it was about 2013, 2014. So yeah.

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Pour one out because we can make fun of them all we want. I'd rather drink it. This show wouldn't exist if that whole era hadn't happened.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
So pour one out. Betty 365 wherever you're at. Hope you have a great job wherever you're at now.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Anyway, hello to all of you out in Twitch land and of course in podcast land.

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Twitch.tv slash VOG Network. V-O-G Network. Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show again.

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
6 Pacific, 9 Eastern every Sunday night. And you can watch us here on the video.

20
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Or if you're a subscriber over at Twitch.tv slash VOG Network you can watch the video part on demand.

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But of course our podcast free as it has been for over 17 years. Can you believe?

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's free because I still get the hiccups live on air and so that quality until I have a cure for hiccups I don't know what I'm going to do with that.

23
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I might not be able to continue being free if we're going to fulfill all these user requests like smush muppet must happen.

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
We don't have the budget for a smush muppet.

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
We do have the budget for a smush emote and that is something that is coming for the tier 2 subscribers in the near future.

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I keep forgetting to load that in the hopper but that is something I think that we were going to do to celebrate around the one year on Twitch or in 2020.

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
That will be something coming.

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I can make a smush muppet but I could but I would not.

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Why not? Muppets are fun. Muppets are hilarious.

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Time. Cosplay.

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
There's other things we have to work on.

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Working on logo.

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
We're talking about some refreshing and stuff behind the scenes like a new logo.

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Potentially that whole shirt store sales stuff and getting that going for you guys that want to buy some merchandise.

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Want to wear O.L.R. on your back without having to get a tattoo.

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
That would be awesome.

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I can wear O.L.R. on my back without a tattoo but I had that thing made like 15 years ago.

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Oh yeah that's right. Oh god I forgot about that shirt.

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Now it actually fits me.

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You made an old shirt for a DDR tournament or something.

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It was when Chris and I, one of our O.L.R. lesbians, went to...

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
We were in Los Angeles I think. We were somewhere and we decided to have O.L.R. shirts made or something.

43
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And so I still have my red and black O.L.R. shirt.

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
This is Dark Sakura Zero.

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Oh yeah yeah. Those are fun. Those are great.

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Anyway. Fifth Dream today in chat says, shit I just got the tattoo.

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Well I mean that's cool.

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm actually thinking about getting a tat- it's not going to be orange on straight I'm sorry to say.

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
But actually I'll say this because it is something...

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It will actually be a piece of this show is what I'm looking to get tattooed on myself.

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So as you guys know I...

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's going to be a poop. A pixel poop.

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
No it's not going to be a pixel poop.

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
As you guys know I lost my mom in 2017 and when that happened I knew that I wanted...

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
If I got a tattoo I wanted it to be something with my mom.

56
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Well luckily since this show has that rich 17 year old history there's clips of my mom on this show in older episodes of this show.

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Like we would call her on Mother's Day.

58
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
There was the infamous clip that everybody really loved when she was reviewing Mortal Kombat for the first time.

59
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
So what I'm actually going to be tattooing is I'm going to get a sound wave of her.

60
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So it's a sound wave of my mom basically.

61
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It needs to be Rob!

62
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I haven't decided what the quote is going to be yet.

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I have to go through what my options are from this show.

64
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But the nice thing is I mean if it wasn't for this show I wouldn't have that.

65
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So I guess maybe...

66
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We have my mom too don't we?

67
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
We do somewhere. Now I couldn't tell you what episode but I know she was on this at one point.

68
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm just going to tell my mom that we're going to call her and harass her one day.

69
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Yeah I think it was a Mother's Day at some point.

70
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I think we called my mom.

71
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We called Loki's family one year I seem to remember that was the thing.

72
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yeah so we've done it for everybody.

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yeah I didn't mean to get all deep here but since it is the one year anniversary on Twitch and we're talking about tattoos I guess that's something.

74
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Now I'm going to have to go get it soon because I keep talking about it.

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Now I need to go do it.

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
But at the same time I'm thinking about getting it in a place where I'd have to take my shirt off to show you.

77
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And I can't do that on Twitch.

78
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
What about forearm?

79
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I don't want to get it on my forearm.

80
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm probably going to get it either on my back.

81
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm actually thinking I'm considering this one.

82
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Even though I know that's very very visible.

83
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
But it's my mom so why shouldn't it be?

84
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's not appropriate to get it as a tramp stamp.

85
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
No I'm not going to get tramp stamps.

86
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's not going to be on my ass.

87
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
If there's not a lot of muscle or fatty tissue it's going to hurt a lot.

88
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And that is why I don't get tattoos.

89
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Because I'm a baby.

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Now I want my tattoo of Loki saying, I'm a baby.

91
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Anyway, I have thought about the back of the leg for that reason.

92
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Can you tattoo it on my fat?

93
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm actually thinking of having my first stone on the back of my neck.

94
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Oh yeah?

95
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'll hop up on camera.

96
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Okay.

97
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Right here.

98
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Oh yeah.

99
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I have designed my own logo back when I was doing design work regularly.

100
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And I was thinking about having my cherry blossom.

101
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Oh.

102
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Alan's thinking about getting a tattoo as well.

103
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
We should all just go get tattoos together.

104
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Wouldn't that be fun?

105
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Let's get a butt.

106
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
On a butt.

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yes that sounds incredibly terrifying.

108
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I want my tattoo to be a destination tattoo actually.

109
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Because I have friends that could do it here locally which is great.

110
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
But I want it to be something where like I went on a trip and I got this done.

111
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And so this isn't just about that.

112
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's about my memory of Insert City here where I go to get it done.

113
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Well you know Nikki, my friend.

114
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Gary's sister.

115
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
She knows places in San Francisco I might go get my little thing done.

116
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It shouldn't be a very expensive or very big one.

117
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But I became actually pretty okay with needles after I had to start injecting myself.

118
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's just B12 so I wasn't like doing heroin or anything.

119
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:20,000
But I sort of lost my fear of needles after having to do sub-q B12 injections in my leg.

120
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Which funny, it freaked Dan out one time.

121
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Because it's red. This stuff is red.

122
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And so it had shot back out of my leg when I pulled the needle out too quickly.

123
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And he's like oh my god you're bleeding.

124
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm like no.

125
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Nope.

126
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
That's a nope.

127
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Alright.

128
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You are a baby.

129
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Let me get some comments and chat.

130
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And then I want to talk about the holidays a little bit.

131
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And we will get into video games I promise. It was a busy week.

132
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Akuma JP in chat says Rob if you're considering going to hot springs here, don't get in a place that's too obvious.

133
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Are tattoos frowned on in Japanese culture?

134
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,000
There are some onsen that will have a tattoo prohibited.

135
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm not jumping in the bath with all the naked old dudes.

136
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
So for example, it's like you can't have a full on sleeve.

137
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
But you could have something discreet somewhere.

138
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's just tattoos have a little bit more of a different social connotation.

139
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And I mean I don't know if it's generic of me to say so.

140
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
But from everyone I've talked to it has to do back to Yakuza.

141
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
There's some folks in chat talking about that.

142
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
But I'm not in a hurry to jump in the bath with the old dudes.

143
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So I think I'll be alright.

144
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
In Japan there will be a lot of other things I want to do.

145
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I am planning when I eventually take my trip of going to Kyoto.

146
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Because again I want to look at pretty kimono fabric.

147
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Go to Kabuki and basically stalk Gekko and Maiko the whole time I'm there.

148
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And then I want to go up to Sapporo and go to the onsen up there and see a fighter's game.

149
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Fun.

150
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Baseball.

151
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Alright.

152
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm trying to think.

153
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I don't know.

154
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I definitely want to do more world travel.

155
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
This next year though is the cruise.

156
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Because you know I'm going with the crew from Starboard Power Coupling.

157
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Which I know they've been on a hiatus here at VOG Network.

158
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Because there has been a lot of new Trek to talk about.

159
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
But I imagine they're going to pick up very soon with Picard coming out.

160
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
But I'm going on the Star Trek cruise with them.

161
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And that's going to be international.

162
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
So who's guesting on there?

163
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Do they have any special guests?

164
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Oh from Trek?

165
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Oh absolutely.

166
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
We have photos scheduled with Kate Mulgrew.

167
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
We have Dr. Crusher, Gates McFadden.

168
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
We have...

169
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Why do I keep wanting to say Marisa Tomei?

170
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
That's not...

171
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Troy.

172
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Why am I Marisa Tomei?

173
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Ah!

174
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
We're going to get Troy.

175
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
And then let's see we also have pictures scheduled.

176
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Wilson Cruz.

177
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Awesome.

178
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I wanted to get a picture.

179
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
So we have a few of those things scheduled.

180
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And yeah it'll be fun.

181
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So I'm really looking forward to the cruise.

182
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
We're going to have a good time.

183
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Marisa Tomei should be in Star Trek actually.

184
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Marina Sirtis.

185
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Yeah I know.

186
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I don't know why.

187
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Her husband died.

188
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Yeah it's really...

189
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Trek had a really bad week a couple weeks ago.

190
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
They had a lot of passings and so forth.

191
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Let's move on to a happier note.

192
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Bobby Black Wolf says I'm jealous I'd rather be on the cruise with you and Grandpa.

193
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Aw well I mean there's a...

194
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I already know Grandpa's going to try to talk me into 2021 Star Trek cruise.

195
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
But I'm like it's a lot of money and time.

196
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And so it's kind of like I would like to get more international travel in.

197
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I don't know if I want to do the cruise back to back.

198
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I might do it like odd number or even numbered years.

199
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Having watched some of the videos online I would love to do a Disney cruise.

200
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I just wouldn't love to pay for a Disney cruise.

201
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I know why I wouldn't want to do a cruise.

202
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Children.

203
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Well that's exactly why I'd do the cruise is children.

204
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You shove them off to be watched by other people that are paid to watch them and then you go have fun.

205
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I want to go on an adult only cruise.

206
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I believe...

207
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I would like to go on an adult only cruise too.

208
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
That has nothing to do with Nookie.

209
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I believe the Star Trek cruise is 21 and up.

210
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Or 18 and up.

211
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
18 and up.

212
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
There are no...

213
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Because I remember it was a controversy thing on Facebook.

214
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Some people want to bring their kids.

215
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Don't quote me on that you guys.

216
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
But I seem to remember eating something where like kids are not going to be there.

217
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
So I did have a dream about a cruise.

218
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I dreamt that it was a cruise hosted by Gordon Ramsay.

219
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Okay.

220
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Sounds awesome.

221
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And that I won like some lottery where I had to like learn how to cook from him.

222
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You know what we need to do?

223
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I don't know when this is supposed to open.

224
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
But we need to go up to Tahoe and go to the Hell's Kitchen restaurant.

225
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
We're putting in a Hell's Kitchen restaurant up there.

226
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Do it.

227
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Yeah.

228
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
We need to do it.

229
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
When I went to the one in Vegas, you know I got the beef Wellington.

230
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Beef Wellington is among my favorite dishes.

231
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm actually planning on, once I perfect my puff paste, I am going to do a beef Wellington.

232
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
All right.

233
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Or getting the filet is going to be nuts.

234
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I've done a beef Wellington.

235
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Can we talk about video games?

236
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Sure.

237
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Sure.

238
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
But food is great.

239
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Should we talk about these presents?

240
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yeah.

241
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Okay.

242
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
The presents.

243
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Festive holiday presents from Dark Sakura.

244
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You want to open yours first, Loki?

245
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Yes.

246
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Let me move the food off of my laptop so that I don't spill it on the floor.

247
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Okay.

248
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,520
So I kind of went all out because we just paid off a shitload of bills and Dan's mad

249
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,280
at me, but I don't care.

250
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:10,000
So I didn't like go like super crazy, but I went crazy enough.

251
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Let's go crazy.

252
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
All right.

253
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
So Loki's, for the folks on podcast, Loki is opening the gift to see what's inside.

254
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Oh, my nose is on air.

255
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Looks like a fabric, maybe a t-shirt, I think is what we're looking at here.

256
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
There's a few things in there.

257
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
We're doing one at a time.

258
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And see, I'm knocking stuff on the ground.

259
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
See, already.

260
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So yes.

261
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
So this is...

262
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Is it like a cyberpunk shirt?

263
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,520
No, it's even better than that because I see laser tag on here.

264
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,520
Oh, it's a laser tag shirt.

265
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,520
Okay.

266
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,520
Awesome.

267
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,520
It's laser tag kitten two.

268
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,200
That's sweet.

269
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,060
There's a story behind me fighting this shirt, by the way, because I was trying to order

270
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,640
a shirt from Cuzar.

271
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,640
Which doesn't really exist anymore.

272
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,600
There are producers of Cuzar shirts, but they want more than the cost of the shirt to ship

273
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,600
it.

274
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,480
And the shirt was actually pretty crazy.

275
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,640
So I was like, eh, birthday presents.

276
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:14,000
Yeah, thankfully I do have a Cuzar shirt from when I did actual league games there.

277
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,640
So I have one that still fits me, which is great.

278
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,640
Awesome.

279
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,640
Let's see here.

280
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,160
So I got an Xbox gift card.

281
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,160
Wow.

282
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,960
I've got Pocky, which I honestly have never had Pocky before.

283
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,960
Really?

284
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,960
Really?

285
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,960
And that is a super good flavor of Pocky.

286
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,640
It's like one of the seasonal deluxe ones.

287
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,640
And no Rocky?

288
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,640
Pocky and Rocky.

289
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,280
And then we've got Kiki Kai Kai.

290
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,280
I've got...

291
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,280
Kiki Kai Kai.

292
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,280
Looks like Super Mario socks.

293
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,280
What is this?

294
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,280
It's...

295
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,280
I'm trying to see what...

296
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,280
It's a picture of here.

297
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,640
I can't really recognize it.

298
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,640
I love fun socks.

299
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,200
Oh, it's a Piranha Plant.

300
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,120
I only saw one half of it, so yeah.

301
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,480
So it's like a Piranha Plant.

302
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,480
That's awesome.

303
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,480
Cool.

304
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,480
And then I got a card.

305
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,480
Because it's for me.

306
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,480
And the card says it's all for your kids.

307
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,480
And it's Happy Hanukkah.

308
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,480
Awesome.

309
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,480
Thank you.

310
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,480
You're welcome.

311
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,480
Fun.

312
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:15,960
You guys are, you know, just a great part of my life and I wanted to do something kind

313
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,960
and show you...

314
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,960
I love the shirt.

315
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,960
I'm glad you like it.

316
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,440
I was like, oh, fuck yeah.

317
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,440
We have a lot of chatters that are saying...

318
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,440
I told Nellie.

319
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,720
She's like, yeah, I get it.

320
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,240
There's a lot of folks in our chat that are saying Loki needs to try the Pocky live on

321
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,240
air.

322
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,660
So what kind of flavor is it?

323
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,660
It's chocolate.

324
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,360
Because Loki's a picky ass eater.

325
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,360
It's like a fine chocolate.

326
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,000
Chocolate should be fine.

327
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Chocolate's safe.

328
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's just chocolate.

329
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,920
See, this way I pick just like a nice easy flavor.

330
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,920
Good, good, good.

331
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,920
Yeah.

332
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,480
Because, you know, Loki is a baby and he's picky.

333
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,480
He's a picky baby.

334
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,920
I'm not necessarily about food.

335
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,920
It's just...

336
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,920
Okay.

337
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,920
All right.

338
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,600
While you open that up, I'm going to open this.

339
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,200
So this is for Alan and I though, right?

340
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,200
You said?

341
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,200
Yes, it is.

342
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,520
But I'm sure he'll forgive you for opening it up on behalf of you both.

343
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,520
Fun socks.

344
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,520
Yes.

345
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,520
My favorite.

346
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,600
The tag came off of them, so I had to just fold them up.

347
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,600
Pizza socks.

348
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,600
They're pizza.

349
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,600
Pizza socks.

350
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,600
And you and Alan can fight over who gets which pair of socks.

351
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,600
Pizza time.

352
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,600
Okay.

353
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,600
Is this weird for me to talk about on air?

354
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,360
Alan and I share our entire wardrobe.

355
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,080
Our entire wardrobe because we're the same size.

356
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,080
That's fine.

357
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,080
So we share socks.

358
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,080
That's awesome.

359
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,080
I steal Dan's undershirts.

360
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,080
Yeah.

361
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,320
Although my stuff doesn't fit him.

362
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,840
Best part of being gay is double the wardrobes.

363
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,320
And what better than pizza but burger and fries to go with that?

364
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,320
Perfect.

365
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,320
Perfect.

366
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,320
I'm all about food.

367
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,320
Love it.

368
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,320
All right.

369
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,320
And let's see.

370
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,840
One of them I'll be surprised if you didn't guess I was getting it for you though.

371
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,220
Fresh food for skin.

372
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,000
My special recipes for beautiful skin.

373
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
This is an Alan thing.

374
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
That's an Alan thing for sure.

375
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,360
Alan loves these.

376
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,920
For those of you that watch Drag Race, you know that Alyssa Edwards when Alyssa Edwards

377
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,920
has samples.

378
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,920
Oh, okay.

379
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,920
Hold on.

380
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,800
The Loki is trying the Pocky for the first time.

381
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,800
Here we go.

382
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,840
Nom, nom, nom.

383
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,640
And he's evaluating.

384
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,640
It's all right.

385
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,640
It's chocolate.

386
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,040
By the way, I love he just talked into the Pocky like the Pocky was the mic.

387
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,920
I had the mic in my hand.

388
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,920
Okay.

389
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:08,920
So yes.

390
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:14,000
Anyway, if you've seen that Alyssa Edwards wearing the face mask, I've walked in on that,

391
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
but it's my husband.

392
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,640
So he loves the face mask stuff.

393
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,640
So he'll like that.

394
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,640
Yeah.

395
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,640
It's good.

396
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,640
I like it.

397
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,640
I'm excited about this funko verse.

398
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,640
Oh, it's a strategy game.

399
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,640
The golden.

400
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,800
Oh, it was that one that I was like, you better tell someone to get this for you.

401
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,280
It's the funko verse golden girls game.

402
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,840
I didn't want you to think that I got it.

403
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:35,500
So they have a game, but I knew you had, I had to gauge your reaction.

404
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,500
That's cool.

405
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,500
Yeah.

406
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,720
Now can I put the other funcos with these funcos?

407
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,660
I'm sure those are little funcos though.

408
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,660
So they're tiny.

409
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,660
Okay.

410
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,320
Oh, that's fun.

411
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,320
But yeah.

412
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,320
So, so I had to double up cause it was you and Alan.

413
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,320
And nothing for Mr. Smoosh.

414
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,320
Yeah.

415
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,320
Cat.

416
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,320
I bought you stuff when you were new.

417
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,320
Ooh.

418
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,320
Ooh.

419
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,320
K cups.

420
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,320
Cause you know, I love me some coffee.

421
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,320
Cinnabon.

422
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,320
And I want one.

423
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,320
Which Dark Sakura bought for herself.

424
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,320
That's fine.

425
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,320
No, we love those.

426
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,320
You know how it goes.

427
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,320
And oh, fuck.

428
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,320
Yeah.

429
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,800
It's a phone stand, but it features a Bad Bats Maru.

430
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,800
My favorite.

431
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,720
I couldn't find the one for Alan.

432
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,200
That's what I was telling you when I was at the store.

433
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,200
That's all right.

434
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,200
He didn't need one.

435
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,740
That's something else for Alan.

436
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,740
Is this it?

437
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,740
I'm guessing.

438
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,740
That should be it.

439
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,740
Although you'll probably use it too.

440
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,420
Oh, he'll like this.

441
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,580
It's um, Hello Kitty and Choco cat.

442
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,860
I couldn't think of Choco cat.

443
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:26,980
That's the one he really likes.

444
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:27,980
It's got caropia.

445
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,660
It's the only Choco cat thing that I could find.

446
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,660
He'll love this.

447
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,660
He'll absolutely love this.

448
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,660
So there you go.

449
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,660
So anyway.

450
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,300
And then a card as well from Dark Sakura.

451
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,300
Yeah.

452
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,300
And it's a Hanukkah card.

453
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,300
It says happy Hanukkah.

454
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,300
Well, I have to read the card.

455
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,300
Okay.

456
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,300
Well read what's in it.

457
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,300
I hope I didn't put something stupid in there.

458
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,300
Let's see.

459
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,640
It's a personal message.

460
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,640
I'm not going to read it on air.

461
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,640
You can read it.

462
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,760
I don't care.

463
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,160
I hope you enjoy these items.

464
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,640
Since I couldn't find the HK pop ring.

465
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,640
I got Alan a mug.

466
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,640
Love you both.

467
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,640
Oh, we love you too.

468
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,640
Thank you.

469
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,640
Thank you.

470
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,640
Thank you.

471
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,640
Thank you.

472
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,640
Thank you.

473
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,640
Thank you.

474
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,820
And I promised Nellie I'd be baking soon and send a big batch of cookies home with you

475
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,160
are probably after next show.

476
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,160
So okay.

477
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,160
All right.

478
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,080
Well, we don't have any Betty in the chat room screaming.

479
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,960
Why aren't you guys talking about games?

480
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,820
So I guess we're doing fine so far.

481
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,740
So, but we will get into games a little bit here.

482
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,340
Let's talk about the game awards.

483
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:22,380
That was probably the big headline from this last week is that the game awards happened.

484
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,260
And there was a lot of stuff going on at the game awards.

485
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,260
Game of the year.

486
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,840
Sequero was the game of the year.

487
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,440
So which is admittedly haven't gotten around to that game.

488
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,580
Wasn't really on my radar because it's a from software game.

489
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,960
Not that I hate from software, but those dark souls games.

490
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,960
I'm terrible at them.

491
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,960
Called it.

492
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,340
But my husband loves those games.

493
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:47,620
So I'm sure he will get around to playing Sequero at some point, but I, you did call

494
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,940
it on the last episode, dark soccer.

495
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,140
I'm actually kind of surprised.

496
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:55,060
I was assuming it would be death stranding or smash with maybe control kind of being

497
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,640
like the dark horse in that race.

498
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,980
Did not think Sequero would actually pull it out.

499
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:03,860
Why, why do you think since you, you did kind of hit your bets there, why do you think Sequero

500
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,940
pulled out the win?

501
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,160
Just because I think it was a, you know, it wasn't weird.

502
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:15,260
I think because death stranding was very unique and I kind of put people off and smash is

503
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,660
just fucking smash.

504
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,340
So whatever.

505
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:22,900
I think it was new enough and odd enough and had a great story to it and a great, you know,

506
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:27,140
theme that it really had a little bit more staying power.

507
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:31,220
And I don't know many people who would go back and do a second run through death stranding,

508
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,420
but second all has like more challenge to it.

509
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,220
So I think that that was what did it.

510
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,220
And it's pretty.

511
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,720
Steph says it is fucking smash and I don't think she means that as a negative, but it's

512
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,760
one of those things where it's like, it was a game that came out last year for one.

513
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:49,480
And you know, we have had several smash games before and this was really like a, this game

514
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:54,480
is supposed to be basically the, the hodgepodge, every, everybody is here.

515
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,480
It's the everything celebration of smash.

516
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,840
And again, these aren't bad things.

517
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,840
Like absolutely is, should be one of the best games of the year.

518
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:05,680
But I think maybe because it did feel a little bit like we've been here before.

519
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,280
Maybe when we consider the critics that were voting on it, they wanted to pick something

520
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,740
kind of newer.

521
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,140
So they went for Sekiro, even though I guess you could say, well, Sekiro was kind of, but

522
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,940
it's not really the same as Dark Souls.

523
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,340
It's a different type of thing.

524
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:21,940
So, you know, it is, it is something a little newer and I don't think a Dark Souls or a

525
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,620
Bloodborne or anything has won a game of the year before.

526
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:27,540
I think Bloodborne was nominated, but I don't think it won.

527
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:32,660
So maybe it was kind of one of those, one of those time and tastes have changed.

528
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,660
Yeah.

529
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,160
And then it also says, I'm still waiting on Sakurai getting more recognition for his

530
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,160
life work.

531
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,060
Well, it did win best fighting game all over all of the traditional fighters that were

532
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:45,040
nominated, like your mortal combats and your, uh, you know, uh, samurai showdown, I think

533
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,460
was in there and that type of stuff.

534
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:53,040
So, I mean, I do feel like all of the games that were nominated won something like death

535
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,480
stranding of the director award smash one, the fighting game control got something didn't

536
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,480
it?

537
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,200
Or did I just keep seeing it as a nominee?

538
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,720
I don't remember, but at this point to see the ongoing game went to Fortnite.

539
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,320
Yeah, that was certainly, you know, in the final community, they do a lot of, they do

540
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,840
a lot of content updates, so I guess, I mean, that makes sense, but yeah, I don't know.

541
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,840
Uh, yeah.

542
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,040
And obviously we had a big one that dropped this past weekend, which Dark Sakura, I think

543
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,800
is, has a story on that coming up later.

544
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:24,120
Um, but yeah, there's that, Oh, outer worlds was the other nominee that didn't really win

545
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,120
anything.

546
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,920
Bobby Blackwell says, I don't think outer worlds won anything.

547
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,600
I think outer worlds, I think kind of suffered from being a little too, like, you know, the

548
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:38,000
fallout game we wanted to play this year or, you know, it kind of felt like it was a good

549
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,720
title, but it did also feel like we've kind of been here before type of thing.

550
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,720
Maybe.

551
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,120
Again, I don't want to make it sound like I'm dogging these games.

552
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:48,480
I'm just trying to figure out like, you know, how did a game like Sekiro, which is probably

553
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,700
one of the least talked about in the category.

554
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,240
How did it come through above all these other ones?

555
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:59,000
Maybe it was just the desire to give the award to something you're not hearing about as much.

556
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,560
I think one of the big winners from the game awards, honestly, I think even more so than

557
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:07,440
Sekiro was, um, Disco Elysium, I think was a huge winner because of the fact that one

558
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,840
two awards, I don't think it was on a lot of people's radar before that night.

559
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,400
But um, you know, it won two big awards and people were very excited about it.

560
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,880
Uh, and they had the folks on stage and everything.

561
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,520
I thought that was a pretty big deal.

562
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,220
So I think Disco Elysium was also one of the big winners of the night.

563
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,280
What did you guys think of the game awards for those that watched it?

564
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,460
Loki, you watched it.

565
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,080
What did you think of the game awards?

566
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,520
I thought it was good.

567
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,200
I thought they did a pretty solid event.

568
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,240
There was like very little of it.

569
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,640
That was kind of cringy and you know, the commercials this time of year didn't really

570
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,040
bother me as much.

571
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:47,760
Um, although I did see like a repeated commercial for a game that's already been out.

572
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:53,600
I kind of wish that there wasn't multiple commercials for the same game, but eh, it's

573
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,600
a minor gripe.

574
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,160
Yeah, they got to pay the bills somehow.

575
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,360
So if somebody wants to buy time to advertise a game that's already out.

576
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,440
And it was an indie game too that's advertising.

577
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,000
So I mean, true.

578
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
I don't know.

579
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
It was okay.

580
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,800
Um, Act Def correcting a little bit saying Disco Elysium won three awards.

581
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,240
I guess one of them was one of the fast forwarded categories.

582
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,240
That's why I must have missed it.

583
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,040
But Act Def clarifying it won best indie, fresh indie and narrative.

584
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,120
Um, Cypher Macinations in our chats.

585
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,720
Um, sorry if I mispronounced that.

586
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,520
I'm saying machina- I was thinking like fascination, fascination street, but machination.

587
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,520
You have machinima.

588
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,520
Machinima.

589
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,520
It says a machine.

590
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,520
Okay.

591
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,520
Machining issues.

592
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,960
Uh, The Outer Worlds was an amazing game, but it felt like a game you've already played

593
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,960
before.

594
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,080
No real reinvention or groundbreaking, a rock solid game, but nothing in your face.

595
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,080
Yeah.

596
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,760
I think, I think that kind of made it like a safe bet and there's nothing wrong with

597
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,760
a safe bet.

598
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,360
There's nothing wrong going to like your, your go-to favorite old comfort food, right?

599
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:53,480
But sometimes the one that takes the risks is the thing that gets rewarded.

600
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:59,240
So yeah, I, I definitely agree with that summary there, even if I butchered your name, I apologize.

601
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:05,240
Um, but anyhow, um, yeah, I, I don't usually watch the game awards start to finish, but

602
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,720
we did that co-stream here at VOG Network earlier this week where Bobby Blackwolf and

603
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,960
I were doing a stream with it.

604
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,080
And so I was kind of forced to watch the whole thing, but I, I didn't hate it.

605
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,640
Um, in fact, I rather liked it.

606
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,760
I thought it was, I thought it was efficient.

607
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,760
Yeah.

608
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:22,320
There's a few things now that I think of it that were kind of like a little cringy.

609
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,840
Um, the whole Apex Legends thing was a little cringy.

610
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:30,040
The Birds of Prey thing was kind of cringy and I get it was for a trailer, but it was

611
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,760
just, it's kind of like, eh.

612
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,960
I think Bobby and I were talking over that part, so we didn't even really know.

613
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,880
It's like, okay, like just, just show the trailer.

614
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,520
Just, we don't need like this lead up to it.

615
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,840
Um, but I mean, it's minor stuff.

616
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,160
I mean, what they did right was pretty awesome.

617
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,600
Every award show has something cringy.

618
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,880
The Oscars always do something cringy.

619
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,480
Of course, you know, like, you know, the Muppets thing that was fantastic.

620
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,880
And see the Muppets thing could have been cringy, but it really wasn't like, it was

621
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,040
really funny.

622
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,800
And the, the, the crossover with Untitled Goose Game was brilliant.

623
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:06,500
Like, you know, the, the fact that those two teamed up, not just for the, um, the Muppet

624
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:10,980
version of the Goose, but the fact that like, they actually put together this game footage

625
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,260
that had Beaker in it.

626
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:15,660
Like, honestly, the biggest disappointment of the night is that that Beaker expansion

627
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,260
isn't a real thing.

628
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,260
That would be amazing.

629
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,460
I wish, I wish that would really happen.

630
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,420
I think a lot of people do after the game awards, that's for sure.

631
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:26,100
So, um, yeah, I think that was, that was great.

632
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,100
Yeah.

633
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:30,500
Only the, only the Apex Legends thing came off as cringy and I think it went on too long,

634
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,500
I think in some ways.

635
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,900
And the Fast and Furious thing is like the final reveal.

636
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:38,220
Like I get that Vin Diesel is a pretty big land, Michelle Rodriguez is cool too.

637
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:42,540
And that's a pretty big land for, you know, who's announcing your best game of the year.

638
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:46,860
But I think the Fast and the Furious thing being like the final unveil of the night was

639
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:52,160
kind of a like, meh, like it was kind of like, especially when you had such huge stuff earlier

640
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,160
in the night, right?

641
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,160
Yeah.

642
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:58,500
It's like, it's hard to follow the, the new Xbox system or like, you know, Hey, here's

643
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:05,140
the first game for PlayStation five and it's like, here's Fast and the Furious and it looks

644
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,140
old.

645
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:09,260
Let's get into some of those other big reveals because as Loki mentioned, one of them, which

646
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:15,180
is just huge, is the fact that we got more information on the next Xbox, which I don't

647
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,480
think anybody was expecting.

648
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,240
You know, we had a lot of rumors about the game awards, what was going to be announced.

649
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,980
Pretty much all of them turned out to be bullshit.

650
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:25,380
Uh, the new smash character being unveiled, bullshit.

651
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:28,260
In fact, Nintendo really didn't show anything at all.

652
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,100
Uh, Doug Bowser was there.

653
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,940
Um, Reggie was there, but not in a Nintendo capacity.

654
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:33,940
Actually the Reggie speech was amazing.

655
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,380
I want to point that out.

656
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,820
Reggie speech was amazing.

657
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:43,220
And um, the, uh, gaming for good and spotlighting like the refugee, the, the, the veteran that

658
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:46,140
was making a game and the 11 year old that was making a game.

659
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,140
I think I even made a comment.

660
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,940
I'm like this 11 year old made a game.

661
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,780
Loki hasn't made a game and this 11 year old has made a game.

662
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,780
But no, I don't want it.

663
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,020
The 11 year old doesn't have a daytime job.

664
00:26:56,020 --> 00:27:00,340
So, you know, I don't want to make light or make fun of the 11 year old because his story

665
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:04,300
was very heartwarming and, um, or heart wrenching, I should say.

666
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:08,020
And his, uh, the fact that he's kind of taking a lot of that emotion and putting it into

667
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,020
a game.

668
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,820
I mean, you want to say games, aren't an art form.

669
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,820
Look at that.

670
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:16,340
Like that is, you know, the, the, how he's developing that game is, is an expression.

671
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,860
Like that just, that just serves to be game as an art form.

672
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:21,220
So, I mean, those are some very powerful segments.

673
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:26,580
So even though we might've lost the, um, lifetime achievement award, I was totally fine with

674
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,740
the, the gaming for good as a like replacement, if you will.

675
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:32,420
I thought it was, those were really like powerful segments.

676
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:36,180
Um, anyway, so the, the Nintendo stuff ended up being bull.

677
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:41,180
Yes, Nintendo did have a trailer for Bravely Default 2, but that was actually a Square

678
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,500
Enix announcement, right?

679
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,020
They had like just commercials.

680
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:46,940
That was about the most that you had from Nintendo there.

681
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:47,940
Exactly.

682
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:48,940
Right.

683
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:52,620
Um, Shane is in chats, uh, talking about the No More Heroes 3 trailer.

684
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,620
It was amazing.

685
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:58,500
And I've never played a proper No More Heroes yet, but again, third party trailer, but it

686
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,500
wasn't.

687
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,500
Maybe I skimmed through that one.

688
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:04,220
Oh no, it was, it was the one that they started, it was like a goddamn superhero was the first

689
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,780
name or something like that.

690
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,500
And then it actually ended up being No More Heroes 3.

691
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,500
It was towards the beginning.

692
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,300
I think I must've missed it.

693
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,300
Go back and check it out.

694
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:14,740
It was, it was, it was a very good trailer, so that was cool.

695
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:18,060
Um, so anyway, uh, that was BS.

696
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:21,300
Uh, the next Rock Steady Batman game was rumored.

697
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,140
That didn't show up either, so.

698
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:30,220
And I know that, uh, gameplay for, uh, Fallout, or not Fallout, Half-Life, Alyx was cut at

699
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,220
last minute.

700
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:35,340
Yeah, there's a lot of talk about that too, that that didn't end up happening, so interesting.

701
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,380
But what did we get?

702
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:41,900
I think something that nobody was expecting, and that was the official name and first early

703
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:49,740
details on Project Scarlet, which is now and forever, Xbox Series X.

704
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,800
That is the name of the console.

705
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,340
Even though it has that word series in there, which really threw me for a loop at first,

706
00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:00,100
I was like, cause as it was being unveiled on the stream, I was thinking, oh, okay, well

707
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:05,460
then this lends itself to that they're going to have the, um, uh, discless one, they're

708
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:08,140
going to have the one with the disc, like there's going to be a series of consoles.

709
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,140
Nope.

710
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:13,460
There's a console called Xbox Series X, and what we're looking at on Twitch, you might

711
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,860
hear a little bit in the background, is we're looking at that reveal trailer that showed,

712
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:21,500
you know, it looks, it does look really good, like the, the detail in the environment is

713
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,780
really stunning when you're looking at this.

714
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:29,340
Um, and you know, you see some, like, assumably Forza, Halo, and, uh, Soccer kind of all rolled

715
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,340
up in one.

716
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,340
FIFA Pro.

717
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,340
Yeah.

718
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:35,100
And then we see, oh, here it is, it looks like it is a tall tower, uh, although it is

719
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,580
confirmed you can put it in either configuration sideways or up and down.

720
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:42,300
This is the tall tower and I hope it really does glow green like that cause I do like

721
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,300
that glow.

722
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:47,360
Uh, and the new controller that will go with it, that is the Xbox Series X.

723
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:52,060
That is the official name of what was formerly known as Project Scarlet.

724
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,180
So what do you guys think about that name?

725
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:54,420
Xbox Series X?

726
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,260
It's confusing, but I don't care.

727
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,260
It's fine.

728
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:00,660
It doesn't, I don't really care what it's called.

729
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,660
Right.

730
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,660
Yeah.

731
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:06,020
It's, I, I, I really didn't like it at first because I also thought it was confusing.

732
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,020
I was like, wait a minute.

733
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,820
It's a series, but it's only one.

734
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,820
Like what is that all about?

735
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:12,660
I think, I think this is what it is.

736
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:16,520
I think Xbox gaming is simply Xbox.

737
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:19,700
They just want to say, you're going to play it on Xbox, you're gonna play it on your Xbox.

738
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:23,340
You've got an Xbox game and Xbox service and all this stuff.

739
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:27,140
And I think the reason why they're going with Series X, it has to do with the fact that,

740
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:31,420
uh, Microsoft has said this before, is that now when you buy a game, it will be playable

741
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:34,260
on their entire ecosystem.

742
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,260
Right.

743
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,340
Starting with Xbox one.

744
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,660
I don't think you can play those games on Xbox 360.

745
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:44,980
So it'll have to be Xbox one or the first, and now kind of like you might have cars that

746
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,940
come out in different series or models.

747
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:53,380
This is Series X and then maybe in 2023 or whenever we get a refresher thing, we might

748
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:57,560
get Series Y or Series Platinum or Series.

749
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,560
And there'd be different ways.

750
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,900
I think it'd just be like X2, X3, X4.

751
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,080
And that may be something they do as well.

752
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:07,520
Kind of like, like, like they're thinking about like phones, you know, where you have

753
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,720
the Samsung Galaxy S4, S5.

754
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,720
I think you're right.

755
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,180
If you think about this name as like a cell phone name, it makes a lot more sense than

756
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,640
maybe what has traditionally been a console name.

757
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,400
And for that reason, I'm warming up to it a little bit.

758
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,480
I don't think it's as detrimental a name as Xbox Wii U.

759
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,480
What?

760
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,480
Xbox Wii U.

761
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,480
Wow.

762
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,040
I mean, that would be pretty detrimental too.

763
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,600
I don't know what this is.

764
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,600
Wow.

765
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,560
Is this a Nintendo product?

766
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,840
Is it a Microsoft product?

767
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,840
Let's try that again.

768
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:41,840
I don't think it's detrimental as a name as Nintendo Wii U, but I think because, you know,

769
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,120
Wii U lended itself to think, oh, it's an upgrade to the Wii and all this other stuff

770
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,320
that wasn't true.

771
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,480
But I think, you know, Xbox Series X, I think it's I don't hate it.

772
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:57,240
The only thing that's weird, I think it gets really easily confused with Xbox One X.

773
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,320
That was the thing that really threw me at first.

774
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:04,040
That might be like kind of what they're going with there, whereas the Series X is going

775
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:07,160
to be like their high end and they're going to have Series S, which is going to be their

776
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,560
low end or something.

777
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,560
Maybe.

778
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,560
Or, I don't know.

779
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,560
Yeah.

780
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:15,840
So I think Microsoft is adopting basically cell phone naming conventions.

781
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,800
And quite simply, these consoles are Xboxes.

782
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,080
It's the Xbox.

783
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,800
So we don't necessarily have to talk about games coming out for Xbox Series X.

784
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,560
The games are coming out for Xbox.

785
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,880
You can play them on your Series X.

786
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,880
You can play them on your One.

787
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,280
You can play them on your One X.

788
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,760
You can play them on, right?

789
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,440
Just like an Android game comes out for Android and you can play them on all sorts of these

790
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,560
different things.

791
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:39,240
That is where Microsoft is taking their naming conventions, in my opinion.

792
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:44,400
So now, and a lot of people in chat talking about something that I brought up on Twitter.

793
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:48,280
So a lot of people remember when the Xbox One was announced, what did we abbreviate

794
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,280
it as?

795
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,280
The Xbone.

796
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,800
XB1, the Xbone, right?

797
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,800
Well, think about that name, Xbox Series X.

798
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,280
I know I pointed this out when we were live.

799
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,280
XSX?

800
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,280
Close.

801
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,280
Xbox Series.

802
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,280
XSEX.

803
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,280
That's a stretch.

804
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,280
It's the X-Sex.

805
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,480
So it is done.

806
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,480
It is named.

807
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,480
The Box-Sex.

808
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,480
It is law.

809
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,480
Xbox Series X is the X-Sex.

810
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,480
Done.

811
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,480
It's a good name.

812
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,480
You know they have to know that that's a potential.

813
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,480
That's a bit X-X-ive.

814
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:30,160
It is a bit X-Sex-ive.

815
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,160
Alright, anyway.

816
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:40,160
Dark Soccer, you weren't watching the Game Awards, so you didn't see this all play out,

817
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,160
but I know you just got a peek there at that little trailer and so forth.

818
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,160
I will say things we have not gone over.

819
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,160
I think I was working.

820
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,160
What was that?

821
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,160
I think I was working.

822
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,160
Yeah.

823
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,160
I think you were too.

824
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:56,560
They also announced, and it should be noted, Hellblade Setsuna Part 2 is Ninja Theory's

825
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,560
game they're working on.

826
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:01,600
There was a really cool little trailer that had an actress that looked like she was like

827
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,600
a cave person kind of singing death metal.

828
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,600
Cool.

829
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,600
That's what it looked like to me.

830
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,600
I'm down.

831
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,600
Yeah, right?

832
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,600
You should look up the trailer.

833
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,600
She's from the first game too.

834
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,600
She is from the first game.

835
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:15,120
But I'm like, is that actually a live grab of somebody or is that like, okay, it looks

836
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,480
like a real fucking person.

837
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,960
The graphics are crazy.

838
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,560
But anyway, so we have that as well and all that.

839
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,920
What are your thoughts on, I know you haven't been a big Xbox household, but what do you

840
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,040
think about where Microsoft strategy is going?

841
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,720
I kind of don't care because Microsoft hasn't really done anything that I've been excited

842
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,800
about in a while.

843
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,960
So I'm just going to wait for another PlayStation.

844
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:44,120
Well, funny you should say that because not to be outdone, I suppose we also, so we got

845
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:50,920
the first Xbox series X title, or I should say new Xbox title and a hell blade, uh, too.

846
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:56,260
But then we also got the very first PlayStation five game and the footage for that.

847
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:02,240
And I didn't have time to rip, but yeah, Epic exclusive by the way, because you know, gearbox,

848
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,240
thank you.

849
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,960
But we had the first, uh, PlayStation five game footage in the form of Godfall, which

850
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,160
is a brand new IP looters slasher.

851
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,160
They're calling it.

852
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,160
Yeah.

853
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,160
It's not a Sony game.

854
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,120
The reason why we're seeing this early is because they could have been showing like

855
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,760
the PC version and saying it's a PlayStation five game as well.

856
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,760
Like it's interesting.

857
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,740
See, I don't know if necessarily Sony had anything to do with this reveal because technically

858
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,320
it was a third party reveal.

859
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,400
They could have been showing the PC version and saying, Oh, we're making it for PlayStation

860
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,400
five as well.

861
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,440
Um, it might be a time exclusive or something.

862
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:39,440
It might be, but anyway, it's a, it is a, the first PlayStation five game that we got

863
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,440
to look at.

864
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,080
And obviously the graphics looked really good.

865
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:46,560
Um, I was getting very Xenoblade kind of vibes from the art, especially in the sword

866
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,160
and all that stuff that we were seeing.

867
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,080
Um, but I'm, I'm definitely interested in more, uh, quest buster wants to point out

868
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,520
God falls by counterplay to be published by gearbox.

869
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,520
So yeah.

870
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:01,320
Um, Shane and chat saying while Microsoft hasn't made like an exclusive game I've cared

871
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:05,120
about for awhile, man, if games pass, isn't like the best thing out there.

872
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,120
Yeah.

873
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,480
I games pass is really cool.

874
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:12,040
Um, I think there will be, you know, again, they bought, they have 15 studios now.

875
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:15,320
So I think there will be something in there that's going to win people over.

876
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:19,520
Um, for me, certainly a new force of horizon is all it's going to take.

877
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,600
Uh, but even if you know, they're, they do a new fable.

878
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:24,800
If that rumor comes true, I would love that.

879
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,400
I would love a new fable game.

880
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,320
So there's, there's still a lot of stuff I think Xbox can pull out.

881
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,320
That'd be really exciting.

882
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:36,800
So, um, but yeah, who knew that at the game awards this week we would see our first Xbox

883
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,120
new Xbox game and our first new PlayStation five game.

884
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,840
That was a pretty big deal.

885
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,120
So yeah, but more to come in the next year.

886
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:48,880
So any other thoughts on the game awards from anyone and how that all went down?

887
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:57,000
Um, no, I mean, I, uh, there was some other game trailers that I was excited about.

888
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,960
So surgeon simulator two, which looks like a co-op game now.

889
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,120
So call these four player co-op, four player co-op.

890
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,120
So that's going to be insane.

891
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,120
Um, so that looked cool.

892
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,480
Uh, there was, I'm trying to think what the other one was.

893
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,120
That was pretty cool.

894
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:15,960
I know they have that like brawler game that was VR that looked kind of neat.

895
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:20,800
Um, I want the beaker on title goose game.

896
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,600
Uh, yeah, yeah.

897
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,680
I mean, that looks cool.

898
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,120
Um, I know there's that new, that nine to five looked interesting.

899
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,160
Nine to five looks all right.

900
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:32,240
Uh, that new player unknown game that they just teased being really prologue.

901
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,720
Uh, the, the sons of the forest or whatever that was with the three legged.

902
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,400
Oh yeah.

903
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,400
Sons of the forest.

904
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:37,680
Yeah.

905
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,320
The, the, the sequel to the forest.

906
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,440
Yeah, that was, yeah, that's going to be scary.

907
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,120
Yeah, that's interesting.

908
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,960
Uh, there was another one that looked like a civilization or something.

909
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,040
It was in the pre-show I think.

910
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,280
Yeah, I remember that.

911
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:50,880
All right.

912
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,120
Anyway, uh, let's see.

913
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:56,240
Yeah, the only problem is, uh, the nine to five game is not going to have Dolly

914
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,360
Parton singing the theme song.

915
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:03,440
And I think that's an issue anyway, although it should, can you imagine if it

916
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:08,760
had like a death metal version of Dolly Parton's nine to five, get the Setsuna

917
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,920
girl, uh, to sing the Dolly Parton nine to five.

918
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,480
Perfect.

919
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,200
Uh, that weird West look kind of cool.

920
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:19,560
Bobby is saying the untitled shark game that now has a title man-eater.

921
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,400
That did look hilarious.

922
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,360
Did you see that with the sharks eating the people, but you play as the shark.

923
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,800
That's a game up dark soccer's alley as well.

924
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,960
Don't you want to play a game where, but you're the shark and you kill people.

925
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:33,800
That sounds like fun.

926
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,200
Doesn't it?

927
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,880
Wasn't that like the old Jaws game that they had?

928
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,200
You could play as we don't, we don't talk about that.

929
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:39,480
Logie.

930
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,080
That one is all right.

931
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:47,240
But it was it the awkward, the awkwardness that is the Wolf Among Us two, a telltale

932
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,680
series, except that studio doesn't exist anymore.

933
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,480
Oh yeah.

934
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,720
The Wolf Among Us two that's it.

935
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,120
Because now the original Wolf Among Us is a free on Epic game store for one.

936
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,040
But yeah, very, very interesting.

937
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,840
I hope at a later time, we can really take a deep dive into that.

938
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:05,680
And, uh, what that all means with the fact that, you know, you had this studio that

939
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,520
was working on it, that effect effectively was shut down.

940
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,480
And now this other studio kind of takes it over.

941
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,040
And although there might be some people that were on the old project, they're on

942
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,840
the new project.

943
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,080
There's some people out there that have kind of moved on.

944
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,840
And so it's like, almost like you're seeing somebody else raise your kid.

945
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,080
I know that's a really extreme perspective, but that is like the sense.

946
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,760
That would be the only way I would have a kid.

947
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:33,480
So, uh, so yeah, it's, uh, is it, but I mean, if we just look at it on a pure

948
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,600
superficial level of, Oh, the game is coming and the game is happening.

949
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,720
I think a lot of people are very excited that Wolf Among Us is getting a sequel

950
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,240
after all.

951
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,720
So there is that anyway.

952
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,200
Um, let's see.

953
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,600
Um, what else I want to say about trailers?

954
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:46,880
Dang.

955
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,320
There was one other one I was going to mention.

956
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,200
Oh, well, I forget in the moment.

957
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,320
I'm sure it'll come to me later.

958
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:51,960
Anyway.

959
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,800
So I, I was a fan of the game awards.

960
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,920
Oh, I want to mention the music performances.

961
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,600
You know, usually music performances are kind of like, why?

962
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:03,040
Or it's like, we just got this band cause we could, and it was cool.

963
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,200
Yes, exactly.

964
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,240
The, the one that they did for cyberpunk.

965
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,080
Yeah.

966
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:07,760
The awesome.

967
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:11,040
So when it first started, I was like, why is Grimes performing?

968
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:11,800
What's the point?

969
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,680
And she's like, she's not even a good lip-syncer, but then it was like, Oh,

970
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,520
Grimes has a song on the cyberpunk soundtrack and the song was pretty good.

971
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:24,560
And the little preview role for the soundtrack was pretty diverse with, you

972
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,240
know, you had some rap artists, you had some electro artists, you had, you had a

973
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,920
really broad range of stuff in there.

974
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,480
So it looked interesting.

975
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,320
Yeah.

976
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,320
So there was that.

977
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,720
Um, and, uh, yes, the final fantasy seven remake trailer.

978
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:37,320
Yes, there was that.

979
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,880
It was a lot of the same stuff, but I'm still very hyped about that game.

980
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,600
Um, music performances.

981
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,760
I thought churches did great.

982
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,680
I loved the orchestra with churches.

983
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,360
I loved the orchestra.

984
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,720
They did this like they did last year.

985
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:51,920
They did a medley of the game of the year nominees, the orchestra, and it was great.

986
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,440
Um, very, it was very good this year, just like it was last year.

987
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,160
But then they had the orchestra playing with churches and that was gorgeous.

988
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,040
That was the open air for the official show is, uh, churches doing death

989
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,080
stranding with the orchestra.

990
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:02,680
I love that.

991
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,080
And then a green day.

992
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,560
And for most of the green day performance, I was like, they are just, they just got

993
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,360
green day to perform because it's green day.

994
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:14,560
But then, and again, as we're watching it live, I'm like, Bobby, do you notice that

995
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:19,520
Beat Saber is playing behind them and green day is etched into the wall in Beat Saber?

996
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,200
Oh, dream day is the next band getting Beat Saber packs.

997
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:28,120
And sure enough, that was the announcement is that now we not only have what Imagine

998
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:31,680
Dragons, I think was it Panic at the Disco had a set or was it?

999
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,000
Yeah.

1000
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:32,280
Yeah.

1001
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:37,520
And then, uh, now we have, um, uh, green day as an official Beat Saber, uh, DLC.

1002
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,920
So that's, um, yeah, it was a very busy night.

1003
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:46,120
Those good stuff, especially with no, um, official Sony event in December, you know,

1004
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,240
all those trailers and announcements have to go somewhere.

1005
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,880
And I know later in the show, we've talking about little things from Sony and Nintendo

1006
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,600
that had some trailers and some big stuff, but you know, nothing that had really the

1007
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,960
volume that we saw at the game awards, big, big stuff.

1008
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,960
All right, let's move on.

1009
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:01,960
I know it was a busy week.

1010
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,520
Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing

1011
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,040
this week.

1012
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,800
And we'll start with Dark Sakura.

1013
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,560
How was your gaming week?

1014
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,760
Pokemon sword only a little bit.

1015
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:14,680
And then I've been playing Pokemon go animal crossing pocket camp.

1016
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,360
Um, uh, idle pouring, uh, the Harry Potter thingy.

1017
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:25,280
Um, I just haven't had a super, I tried to play the Sims.

1018
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,640
I'm going to get my computer crashed.

1019
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:32,680
So that's why I also haven't picked up, um, uh, Detroit become human, even though I really

1020
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:36,040
like to play it at just not feasible for me right now.

1021
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:40,160
Not until I replace my computer or at least figure out what's making it crash.

1022
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,600
I mean, I may be ready for a new motherboard, so we'll see.

1023
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:51,200
Um, but other than that, just, you know, the usual, I haven't really had a lot of time

1024
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:57,840
for things getting ready for, excuse me, like I did some baking and I sent, uh, a gift to

1025
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,400
our friend in Canada.

1026
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,080
How many, Mr.

1027
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:02,880
The real one.

1028
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,480
Yes, yes, of course.

1029
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:11,960
And, um, I, uh, I, I, I'll, I'll, I'll let him see it when it arrives, but it's things

1030
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:15,320
that I understand are not easy to obtain in the great white north.

1031
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:15,840
Okay.

1032
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,360
So you send them some in and out.

1033
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,600
No, I sent those some of my own cookies.

1034
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,600
I also sent our friend, the seg, some cookies.

1035
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,360
Oh, great.

1036
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:28,160
So I have been baking and I have more people to bake for.

1037
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:33,400
So, um, if I walk around smelling like, you know, sugar and creme de menthe, that's probably

1038
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,880
why either that or just gave up and started drinking the creme de menthe.

1039
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,120
It happens.

1040
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:38,920
All right.

1041
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:39,840
Especially when I bake.

1042
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,480
Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

1043
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,200
Um, so I didn't really play anything.

1044
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:50,280
No, I've been mainly working on my game and stuff.

1045
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:56,120
So I, uh, got to the point where in my procedural generation stuff, I was trying

1046
00:43:56,120 --> 00:44:01,240
to make it so that I can have the players go through like the maze.

1047
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:05,120
That is a level in a way that would kind of take them towards the end with a little

1048
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:09,000
bit of meandering through, um, that was pretty hard to do.

1049
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,480
And so I decided I'm not doing that.

1050
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,240
And I'm just going to let you wonder where in the hell you want, because then it opens

1051
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,280
up the opportunity to put like secret rooms and fun stuff like that.

1052
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,520
So that also made my job a lot easier.

1053
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,840
It means I can move on to the next thing I'm going to do, which is actually, um,

1054
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,320
procedurally generating the rooms themselves.

1055
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:30,920
And then along with that, the enemies that spawn the room and that sort of thing.

1056
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:34,280
So that's where I got to this week is that, that, and I've been

1057
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,200
working a little bit on artwork.

1058
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:40,920
Um, I was doing some pixel art stuff that I was like sharing out and

1059
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:44,160
Twitter and stuff for t-shirt designs.

1060
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,600
So, all right.

1061
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:47,440
Awesome.

1062
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:47,840
Yeah.

1063
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:48,280
Good.

1064
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,240
Um, let's see my gaming week.

1065
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,320
So my weekend was dominated with mobile phone GPS games.

1066
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,440
Cause we had Pokemon go community day, Saturday and Sunday.

1067
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,040
I played the entire three hours Saturday and I played about two hours today

1068
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,440
before I finally got burned out.

1069
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:04,480
But, uh, it was nice because I was able to get some of the shinies that I

1070
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,000
completely missed out on the first time.

1071
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,040
So I've like four shiny mudkips where I had zero before.

1072
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:13,080
And I got a, I got a shiny trap inch, which I had zero of those before.

1073
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,600
So, um, I was, I was happy to catch up on that.

1074
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,240
In fact, the mudkip, I got a three-star appraisal one.

1075
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,360
So that made me very, very happy.

1076
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,440
I got a couple of shinies too, from work.

1077
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,520
Oh, well, hey.

1078
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,680
Only one of each things that I never got before.

1079
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:25,920
Say, Hey, it's something.

1080
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:26,600
Yeah.

1081
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:30,160
So are they just, do they just like bump up the level of shinies?

1082
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:31,880
What do you mean?

1083
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:37,240
On, um, they boost them specifically between 11 AM and 2 PM during the, during

1084
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:37,840
this weekend.

1085
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:42,600
Um, but the actual Pokemon that were part of the community days, they're

1086
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,440
all increased everywhere.

1087
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:47,360
So you just by nature have a better chance of finding those shinies.

1088
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,160
Cause there's more of those Pokemon out in the wild.

1089
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:53,200
Um, but I actually, I dual wielded community day on Saturday.

1090
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,560
And what I mean by that is that I was actually Bluetooth catching for Pokemon.

1091
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,760
And I was playing Harry Potter community day on my phone because, uh, Harry Potter

1092
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:05,400
Wu or Wizards Unite had their community day and I kind of hit the pedal to the

1093
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,080
metal on that.

1094
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,280
I gained two levels.

1095
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:12,120
So I'm level 29 now and, uh, you know, got, I finished all the little quests you

1096
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:13,520
had to do that day and all that stuff.

1097
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:17,480
So I got a Totodile and a Swinub.

1098
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:18,400
Fun.

1099
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,360
They're both green.

1100
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,280
Swinubs look like a little watermelon.

1101
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:21,920
They're cute.

1102
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:22,560
Yeah.

1103
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,840
Um, and let's see.

1104
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,520
Um, uh, what else?

1105
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,720
So I did Harry Potter.

1106
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:32,760
And then last night I went out with my Ingress buddies and we just, we, uh, there's

1107
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,280
like a group of us that all kind of live here locally in the neighborhood.

1108
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,560
And we were in a chat and we're like, let's go to the Olive Garden.

1109
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:42,080
So we, we decided to go, well, here's the punchline.

1110
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:45,240
So, so, and then of course, as we're driving to Olive Garden, it's like, I have

1111
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,880
this mobile full of Ingress players.

1112
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,040
So as we're driving, it's like, we're turning everything like our color and all

1113
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:51,440
that stuff.

1114
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:55,560
Um, but then the funny thing was, um, the way to Olive Garden was like an hour.

1115
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,520
So we went to the second best restaurant.

1116
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:01,880
We went to Red Lobster, which I hadn't been there.

1117
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,680
In Red Lobster far exceeds all our biscuits.

1118
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:06,120
Yes.

1119
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:06,880
Cause I got to have the business.

1120
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,920
The only bummer is though, Olive Garden has a portal.

1121
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,080
Red Lobster does not.

1122
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:15,440
So there was no hacking during dinner, but then we went out and did some more and we

1123
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,200
were going to stop.

1124
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,480
And then one of the other players started taking down what we were doing.

1125
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,400
So we were like rampage raw and went through the neighborhood.

1126
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,640
Just, just having fun and chatting and being nerds.

1127
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:27,800
So I had a very full, uh, cell phone gaming weekend, but I did play some of the

1128
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:31,360
traditional stuff too, still playing Final Fantasy 14, little bit of Pokemon.

1129
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,840
I did a stream earlier this week, just trying to fill out the decks a little

1130
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:37,400
more, doing the raid, still trying to get that goddamn Gigantamax Snorlax.

1131
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,880
I still don't have, but I pretty much told Shane, I'm going to make him trade me

1132
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,000
one if I don't catch one.

1133
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,840
And, uh, he has like 17, so it's not going to be a problem, uh, on three different

1134
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:46,520
accounts, I'm sure.

1135
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:50,800
So, um, yeah, so just making progress in those games.

1136
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,560
I think a little bit of Death Stranding, but I really, I really need to like sit

1137
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:57,680
down and play Death Stranding if I ever want to actually beat it.

1138
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,320
Cause I'm not very far into the game right now.

1139
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:04,600
And one of my friends said he finally gave up after chapter five and watched an 11

1140
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:09,160
hour movie that was all the cut scenes after chapter five.

1141
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:12,400
And I'm like, geez, I got a lot to go.

1142
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,360
So anyway, that was my gaming week.

1143
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,000
So, uh, let's get into some gaming news now.

1144
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,480
I think, uh, we're ready for that.

1145
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:24,320
Uh, as far as show schedule, uh, because usually we do housekeeping here too.

1146
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,280
Uh, we should be here.

1147
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,280
I don't think we're missing any shows for the holidays.

1148
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:32,880
The next show we'll be missing is on January 19th, which is a Martin Luther

1149
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:33,520
King weekend.

1150
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:37,760
We won't be here live that night, but we should be taped in one way or another.

1151
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,200
We may actually go live earlier in the day.

1152
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:40,720
I think we were looking at doing that potentially.

1153
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,800
So yes, my kids are very excited.

1154
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:43,600
Oh boy.

1155
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:46,080
So are they going to behave for three hours?

1156
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:46,440
Nope.

1157
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:47,240
Oh boy.

1158
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,280
I mean, I'm just saying that because nope.

1159
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,040
All right.

1160
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,360
Anyhow, let's move on.

1161
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:56,840
Let's get into, uh, other gaming news and what's going on in the gaming world.

1162
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,240
It wasn't just the game awards, right?

1163
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:58,680
The stuff, right?

1164
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,880
They had the state of play this week as well.

1165
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:05,760
So, um, basically some of the announcements we knew were coming.

1166
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:10,960
So, uh, nothing too, um, surprising with the resident evil three remake

1167
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,120
announcements coming out in PlayStation four, April 3rd.

1168
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:19,880
Uh, we've got the kingdom hearts three DLC expansion with new characters.

1169
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:25,400
Uh, that's coming out on the 23rd of January and then untitled goose game is

1170
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:30,360
going to be coming to PlayStation four on December 17th, so right around the corner

1171
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:35,920
dreams, which they recently pulled the early access beta version that you could

1172
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:41,320
purchase a thing was last week and I missed out on that, but the full game will

1173
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,160
be coming out on February 14th.

1174
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:47,680
So that's something that was announced spell break a new battle royale game.

1175
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:53,400
Um, they said combining role playing and magic combat is starting a closed beta.

1176
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:59,120
Uh, they showed off some VR stuff, a paper beast, and then there was a new

1177
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:04,880
predator game coming out, April 24th, and apparently from Square Enix and

1178
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:10,360
platinum Babylon's fall, uh, it's a new action game that mixes, uh, was it

1179
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:16,520
medieval and fancy it's sci-fi and then subliminal, which is a perspective

1180
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:20,560
bending physics game that they've got coming on the PlayStation four.

1181
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:25,400
And then last but not least, um, they showed a little bit of, uh, goes to

1182
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:29,440
shoe SEMA, which they showed a longer trailer during the game awards for that.

1183
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,080
Um, but yeah, so that's basically everything in it's announced.

1184
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:37,600
So, um, very interested to see when dreams comes out.

1185
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,760
Cause I think that's going to be a game that catches a lot of people off guard.

1186
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,360
Yeah, I definitely want to check out dreams when it's officially out.

1187
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:46,160
That's already, I think maybe a possible game of the year contender for next year.

1188
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,600
Maybe just if the early buzz is any indication.

1189
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,000
I mean, uh, it looks interesting.

1190
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:50,800
Yeah, it really does.

1191
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,040
So I'm, I'm all about that.

1192
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:55,200
The, um, what was the battle royale that was RPG kind of base?

1193
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:57,120
That's a spellbreak spellbreak.

1194
00:50:57,160 --> 00:50:57,320
Yeah.

1195
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,360
That sounds really interesting too.

1196
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,200
So, um, yeah, you battle, right?

1197
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,120
The battle royale genre is just not going away.

1198
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,000
I know we have another story coming up a little later.

1199
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:06,320
Yes.

1200
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,600
Another, yes, that, that one looked interesting.

1201
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:08,880
Yeah.

1202
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,920
So there's this, uh, no shortage of games there, although, uh, it

1203
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,280
didn't make the show world tonight.

1204
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,120
And I don't think this game was battle royale per se, but I

1205
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:19,840
know I was looking at our discord over at vognetwork.com slash discord.

1206
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:23,560
And I saw that there was, um, uh, a comment about this and I

1207
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:24,360
thought it was interesting.

1208
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:26,800
It's a game that, uh, planetside arena.

1209
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:27,320
That was it.

1210
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:32,160
It just like, it just came out in early access and like September and they've

1211
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,480
already announced it's closing in January.

1212
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:39,120
And there's a comment here, uh, a quote from the article, apparently the month

1213
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:41,720
that debuted, it had 474 players.

1214
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,320
And as of right now, when somebody was writing the article, there were

1215
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,600
three people playing the game.

1216
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:53,160
That was like the, um, what was that one that was by, um, I think I did twisted

1217
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:57,680
metal, um, I don't remember his name, but like there was, remember that one battle

1218
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,480
royale game that was like an eighties kind of throwback thing.

1219
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:04,040
And then they had like bikes and stuff in there.

1220
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:07,440
Like it was, it was something that came out around E3 and then just

1221
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,840
like died in like two months.

1222
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,760
It was like the, the sketchbook looking thing, right?

1223
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:12,760
No, no, no, no, no, not that.

1224
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:13,800
But he did that as well.

1225
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:14,720
David Jeff.

1226
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:14,880
Yeah.

1227
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:15,440
Did that.

1228
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:18,360
Um, he did that game, but then there was another one.

1229
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:18,960
No, no, no.

1230
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:19,400
I'm sorry.

1231
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,840
I'm confusing David Jeff with, um, not him.

1232
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,840
Um, God damn it.

1233
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:25,760
The guy that did gears.

1234
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:28,360
Um, Oh, cliffy cliffy V.

1235
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:28,720
Yes.

1236
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:34,920
Uh, so his game, yeah, it's not David Jaffe, but his game that was that weird,

1237
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,800
like, I don't remember the hell is called now, but it was some battle

1238
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:41,640
royale game that came out around the time that, you know, Fortnite was

1239
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:45,720
doing really well and it just didn't take off like it died within two

1240
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:48,520
months in the early access law breakers.

1241
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:49,160
Yes.

1242
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:49,600
That's it.

1243
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,320
Start to Tetsuya.

1244
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:50,760
That was it.

1245
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:51,400
No, no, no.

1246
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,680
That was another one too.

1247
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,680
But there was law breakers died too.

1248
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:59,320
That was, that was more of a hero shooter game that, um, the battle

1249
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:02,440
royale one I'm thinking though, was it wasn't law breakers.

1250
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,840
It was, um, God damn it.

1251
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:05,680
Now we have to look it up.

1252
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:09,920
Uh, but yeah, quest buster and chat says that from what I gathered planet

1253
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,840
side arena was nothing the fans asked for.

1254
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,280
They wanted planet side three.

1255
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:14,600
Yeah, there's that.

1256
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:17,960
Uh, Shane's mentioning the David Jaffe game was drawn to death.

1257
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:18,880
No, no, no.

1258
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:19,760
Not that one either.

1259
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:22,760
That was another, that's another game that was PlayStation.

1260
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,840
I don't think that lasted very long either, but that had the life

1261
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,000
of about a year and a half probably.

1262
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:27,520
It was.

1263
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,480
Yeah, it was.

1264
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:29,440
That one was all right.

1265
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,680
It, um, that had an interesting heights.

1266
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:32,200
Many people.

1267
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:32,640
Thank you.

1268
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:32,920
Yes.

1269
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:33,600
Radical heights.

1270
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:34,200
That's the one.

1271
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:34,600
Yes.

1272
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:35,320
There you go.

1273
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:35,880
All right.

1274
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:36,360
You got it.

1275
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,560
Anyway, finally got there.

1276
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:39,560
All right.

1277
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:42,680
Well, uh, yeah, so battle royale, I mean, all these developers kind of

1278
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:45,680
want to hit on that Fortnite money, but you know, some, some are doing

1279
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,320
well, but some not so well.

1280
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:48,280
So, um, yeah.

1281
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,480
Anyway, um, delayed games.

1282
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:54,200
So, you know, sometimes when we would hear about game delays,

1283
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,240
we'd be really bummed out.

1284
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:58,040
But I think as we've learned over the years, game delays are often

1285
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:00,200
good news because that means the game is not gonna be garbage.

1286
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:00,480
Yes.

1287
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,680
Because we've seen some of the games that have hurried to get out on

1288
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,000
time and they've not turned out well.

1289
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:06,960
Andromeda.

1290
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:10,840
Oh, speaking of which I was going to mention, you, you know, one of

1291
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:15,000
those games that we think about Anthem like that, I saw it down the

1292
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,520
five bucks for the collector's edition.

1293
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,760
$5.

1294
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:21,160
Not surprised.

1295
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,760
I'm pretty sure I've seen it at $5 as well.

1296
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,960
Like I think at target on their little backside of the shelf, that's

1297
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:27,560
ridiculous.

1298
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:28,480
I saw it for five bucks.

1299
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:28,760
Yeah.

1300
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:30,720
So yeah.

1301
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:31,120
Anyway.

1302
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:34,320
Uh, but what's been delays that hopefully they can sell it for more

1303
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:38,880
than $5, uh, it was a final fantasy crystal chronicles has been, uh,

1304
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:39,840
there was, yeah, right.

1305
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:40,600
That is coming.

1306
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:42,160
Uh, and there was a series of tweets.

1307
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:45,040
Um, then they said, uh, since announcing final fantasy crystal

1308
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,680
chronicles, we've received so many positive messages filled with

1309
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:50,120
encouragement, but today we're announcing the release date for the

1310
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,240
game is being moved to summer 2020.

1311
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:55,280
We made the decision to adjust the release date to allow the development

1312
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,880
team some extra time to make final adjustments to the game, to make the

1313
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:59,280
best experience possible.

1314
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:02,800
Uh, final fantasy crystal chronicles remastered is coming to PS four,

1315
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,160
Nintendo switch, iOS, and Android devices.

1316
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:07,880
You'll be able to play online with your friends and transfer your save

1317
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:12,840
file across all four platforms when the game launches in summer 2020.

1318
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:16,400
So, and they put out a new trailer, uh, just to remind you that it is still

1319
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:16,880
coming.

1320
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:18,160
Uh, I remember.

1321
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:18,440
Okay.

1322
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,880
So that was when I lived with you.

1323
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:23,920
We had the game cube with the game boy advanced adapters.

1324
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,800
Cause that was where Chris Chronicles originally was.

1325
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:28,320
I remember we played some of that and that game was fun.

1326
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:31,960
Not with me, but that may have been shame.

1327
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:33,440
Maybe, or some people would come over.

1328
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,160
We would play that.

1329
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,280
I think I was dating a guy at the time that had it too.

1330
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:37,480
And we were playing through that a little bit.

1331
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,240
So yeah, I don't think I've ever played that game.

1332
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:39,960
Really?

1333
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:43,240
No, cause there was, I remember the one, I remember selling the one that

1334
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:47,720
was on the Wii and DS that had interconnectivity that way too.

1335
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:48,280
Hmm.

1336
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:52,680
Uh, Shane's and chat saying this delay made me sad.

1337
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:55,640
I was hoping to hold the chalice and keep it from everyone else next month.

1338
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,560
But it's, this is the good news because you want it to work.

1339
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:01,720
You want to be successful and not buggy and crashy and all that stuff.

1340
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,960
Especially when they're talking, you don't want to hold the chalice and have

1341
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,560
that child's corrupt your character save.

1342
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,560
And then yes, you don't want that to happen.

1343
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:10,320
So it's probably for the best that this was delayed a little bit.

1344
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,760
So anyhow, moving on dark soccer, there was a pretty big event this weekend

1345
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,200
in a game that I don't think any of the three of us play regularly.

1346
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,760
Nope, but I thought it was cool.

1347
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,320
So, uh, Fortnite had some fun stuff happen.

1348
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:25,480
Basically, uh, JJ Abrams showed up in the millennium Falcon in game.

1349
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:30,680
And a big screen fell from the sky and showed a clip of rise of Skywalker.

1350
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,160
So that's cool.

1351
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,560
And then after that, guess what happened next?

1352
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:38,960
The world went back to being a black hole and disappeared.

1353
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:42,360
Everyone got lightsabers and then it went to being a black hole.

1354
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:47,440
And you also now have a Rey and Finn skins in the game.

1355
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:53,560
And, um, but yeah, so I want to go and see if I can just find like

1356
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:55,480
clips of the recording or whatever.

1357
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,200
Oh, it's just everywhere on YouTube.

1358
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:57,680
I'm sure.

1359
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:58,680
I just haven't bothered.

1360
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:01,160
So, um, but yeah, advertised on Twitch pretty heavily too.

1361
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:04,200
They've got like all kinds of shit all over Fortnite anyway, now

1362
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,200
like skins and themes and stuff.

1363
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,640
But yeah, so basically.

1364
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:13,720
JJ Abrams flew in in the millennium Falcon and showed some movies.

1365
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,680
Uh, Bobby Black Wolf is pointing out.

1366
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,680
This is a lot like what some VR things do.

1367
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:20,760
Altspace VR and VR chat have done this type of stuff before.

1368
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:21,240
Yeah.

1369
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:24,480
It's interesting that it's, it's in a game like Fortnite, which most of us

1370
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:28,040
think of as a shooty shooter, battle royale, Minecraft meets guns.

1371
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:28,720
Popular.

1372
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,760
And yeah, I think because of its popularity, but yeah, I mean, this

1373
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:36,280
type of thing is like the type of thing in like second life or PlayStation home.

1374
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:39,840
Remember when you could visit the virtual PlayStation booth and PlayStation

1375
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:44,000
home and they would show like PlayStation trailers and stuff like that was a thing.

1376
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,600
But I think let's be real.

1377
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:49,840
There's millions more people in Fortnite than there ever was in PlayStation home.

1378
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:52,640
They also had though, as an added bonus.

1379
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:56,880
So it's Ben, Ben Schwartz was, um, there as one of the storm

1380
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,320
troopers and goofing around.

1381
00:57:59,360 --> 00:57:59,760
Oh, really?

1382
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:04,520
So another skin in here is the Sith trooper and you get a first

1383
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:08,040
order tie fighter are some other things that are new in game.

1384
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:08,280
Oh yeah.

1385
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:08,800
The gliders.

1386
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:09,600
Yeah.

1387
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:10,480
That looked pretty cool.

1388
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:12,880
Um, I watched the clip and it was lame.

1389
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:14,360
What was the clip?

1390
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:20,040
The clip was basically it's, it was, uh, Rey Finn and I remember the other dude.

1391
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:20,480
Po.

1392
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:20,960
Po.

1393
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:21,200
Yes.

1394
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:21,520
Thank you.

1395
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,720
And they were, don't you ever forget his name.

1396
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,160
I would die for him.

1397
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:25,880
I'm sorry.

1398
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:26,800
I remember the face.

1399
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:27,560
It's not the name.

1400
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:27,880
Okay.

1401
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:28,840
It's distracting.

1402
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:34,760
So, um, so anyways, so they break into what looks to be a ship of some sort and

1403
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:37,520
they're running through, they're shooting storm troopers and then these storm

1404
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:42,800
troopers confront them and Rey does her Jedi mind trick to like tell them, Hey,

1405
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:43,840
we're supposed to be here.

1406
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,320
And they're like, yeah, they're supposed to be there.

1407
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:46,080
And that was it.

1408
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:47,280
It was a really short clip.

1409
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:51,200
It had no context into anything else other than, yeah, she did a Jedi mind

1410
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:51,440
trick.

1411
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:51,800
Cool.

1412
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:53,920
Well, they're not going to spoil the goddamn movie.

1413
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,000
I mean, you know, it was just,

1414
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:57,840
I wanted to see the clip with Darth Jar Jar.

1415
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:01,200
That was one of the options that they had them fans vote on and everyone should

1416
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,600
have voted for Darth Jar Jar.

1417
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:03,240
Damn it.

1418
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:07,480
Uh, Sia Tabiri in chat says, but do you remember Po's last name?

1419
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:08,560
Dameron.

1420
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:09,720
Don't fight me.

1421
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:11,680
Anyway.

1422
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:16,160
Uh, speaking of, um, I forgot to mention this about the game awards and I think

1423
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:20,000
this is a travesty that I would forget to mention this, but, um, Akumi Nakamura,

1424
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,240
uh, showing up to present an award.

1425
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:23,360
Love her.

1426
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:26,440
Uh, my favorite thing was the whole, like, uh, what did she say?

1427
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,200
She said, please bear with my English.

1428
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:29,960
She goes, please bear with bear.

1429
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,880
And she's just like, I, I was, I knew at that point I would take a bullet

1430
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:35,280
for her cause she's incredible.

1431
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:39,760
I, it's, and what it is y'all is the enthusiasm about video games and the

1432
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:42,160
games industry, like games should be fun.

1433
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:46,080
And when you see somebody like her on stage, she is having the time of her

1434
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:49,120
life, she's having fun and that fun is infectious.

1435
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:51,000
And that's, that's great.

1436
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,200
You know, star Wars should be fun.

1437
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,600
Fortnite should be fun.

1438
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:55,560
Games are fun.

1439
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:59,720
Anyway, I just want to make sure I, uh, got that out at some point.

1440
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:01,080
All right, let's move on.

1441
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:04,000
Uh, let's talk about battle royale fun.

1442
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:04,880
Yes, this is more fun.

1443
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:05,640
This is awesome.

1444
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:08,800
So I did get to check out, um, the video showing this.

1445
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:14,360
So Forza Horizon 4 is getting a new 72 car battle royale mode.

1446
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,880
And you might be thinking, well, how the hell is that going to work?

1447
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:20,680
So it's this new mode called the eliminator and the way it starts

1448
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:24,120
off, you're in the map and you basically have 72 final round and guts.

1449
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:27,120
Anyway, that's the agrocrag.

1450
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:28,560
Yeah, that was the eliminator.

1451
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:30,320
What kid's game show was the eliminator in?

1452
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:31,760
Or am I thinking of the Illuminati?

1453
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:33,400
Maybe the eliminator.

1454
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,960
Um, is that like the Illuminati nadir?

1455
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:37,160
What is that?

1456
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:40,840
American gladiators, American gladiators, the, the, yeah.

1457
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:43,440
You know, the American gladiators.

1458
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,400
And for some reason I got American gladiators just

1459
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,960
confused with Nickelodeon guts.

1460
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:51,640
I mean, cause guts is sort of like a spin off American gladiators without

1461
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:55,080
gladiators punching the kids because they did have American gladiator kids,

1462
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:58,280
which I was always like, they were always so gentle with them.

1463
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:01,520
But like at the same time, I'm like, dude, just take them out.

1464
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:05,960
Like you got your foam, you know, your giant Q tips of death.

1465
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:07,640
Just knock that kid on his ass.

1466
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:10,920
Imagine the show now where it's just like the American gladiators

1467
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:12,160
kick the shit out of children.

1468
01:01:13,160 --> 01:01:15,880
And for some reason, I think this is so funny.

1469
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,720
I don't know what, although it's probably not.

1470
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:19,600
And everyone's like, how dare you laugh at that?

1471
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,000
But it's, it's funny.

1472
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:22,240
Come on.

1473
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:27,600
But we, the kids are the type that like scream during movies and, uh,

1474
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:31,120
you know, are really annoying in restaurants and those types of kids.

1475
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:31,760
Yes.

1476
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:35,640
The ones that have this like complex where they think they're so indestructible

1477
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:39,200
and then you just, you put them up against Blaze and then Blaze just

1478
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:40,480
beats the shit out of them.

1479
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,520
Just knocks their fucking ass down.

1480
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:45,080
Any American gladiators to come back? I know they had a thought.

1481
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:45,680
They did.

1482
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:46,240
They did.

1483
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,520
That was almost like 10 years ago at this point,

1484
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:52,920
that revival that was like what Hulk Hogan and Leila Ali was the,

1485
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:55,520
they were the hosts, right? And they had, uh,

1486
01:01:56,160 --> 01:02:00,080
they had the guy that won the first season came back and he was like the rubber

1487
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:02,200
band. I don't remember what the fuck his name was, but he could,

1488
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:07,080
that wall thing, he just fly up that goddamn wall. So yeah, we need a new,

1489
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:08,720
like we need a new, new American laddiers.

1490
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:11,840
But here's the thing, if you're not going to be, the thing is the,

1491
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:14,640
the modern American gladiators, like kind of, they kind of,

1492
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:19,320
they try to keep it like half cheesy, but half modernize it. No, no, no, no, no,

1493
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,840
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, 100% cheesy,

1494
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:25,840
100% cheesy outfits that fucking like shine and like,

1495
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:30,800
you know, and if it's not spandex and it's not sequence, it was like sequence,

1496
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:35,280
sequence, sequence on the men and the women. Okay.

1497
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:39,280
All of it. And just, just have that, you know, was,

1498
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:41,000
I don't remember they used to call it with,

1499
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:44,560
was it the gauntlet or whatever with the giant like nerf things that they would

1500
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:48,640
like be shooting? Yes. Yes. And you know what we need, uh, you know,

1501
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:51,160
cause they always would feature, you know, it'd be the men's competition,

1502
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:52,120
the women's competition,

1503
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:57,360
but we also need the gender fucking competition that's drag queens as,

1504
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:02,560
um, competitors and uh, the gladiators because let's be real,

1505
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:06,480
American gladiators are basically drag queens without the lip syncing.

1506
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,000
They need the, they category.

1507
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,800
No, of course. But you know,

1508
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:17,480
the, the non gender binary,

1509
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:20,480
I just think right now it's like they've kind of replaced that with like this

1510
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:23,600
stupid American ninja warrior bullshit. And

1511
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,400
it's, that shit is a real challenge though.

1512
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:31,880
I understand that, but it's not as cheesy and entertaining as like, you know,

1513
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:35,960
the shit that we see. Like for example, I, I,

1514
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:40,560
I want to say it was Akuma JP. It may have not been somebody on my Twitter,

1515
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:44,440
posted a video of like a Japanese game show where they had this dude inside of a

1516
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:49,200
balloon and they were having him do different feats of strength that required

1517
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,280
him not to pop the balloon.

1518
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:53,000
And every time he failed because it's a giant balloon, like they,

1519
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:56,800
they want him to jump, you know, do the high jump or whatever.

1520
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,320
And it's just like he couldn't do it,

1521
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:01,080
but it was hilarious because it looked ridiculous.

1522
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:02,640
That's the kind of TV I want to watch.

1523
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:06,200
Absolutely. Anyway, we're, we're, we're back to Forza.

1524
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:13,480
Yes. I love that. And I loved it when they did the really bad dubs. You know,

1525
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:17,000
it's what they call the most extreme elimination challenge.

1526
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:20,320
I miss that show so much. I love that show.

1527
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:23,760
But seriously, hear me out here. American gladiators, but it's drag queens.

1528
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:28,120
Mimi, I'm first clearly pick you up and drag.

1529
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:30,480
American gladiators, American drag gladiators,

1530
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:36,520
copyright copyright, patent pending trademark, uh,

1531
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:40,960
property of orange Andreo. All right. Sorry. So, uh, the eliminator,

1532
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:45,080
so way it works is there's 72 players that are on a map. It has, you know,

1533
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:48,920
of course the, the ring of death that's out there. Um,

1534
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:52,880
so what happens is you're driving around and you start as like a level one car

1535
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:56,720
that's like a piece of shit car and you challenge other players.

1536
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:58,760
So when you get close to them, you can do a one-on-one challenge.

1537
01:04:58,760 --> 01:04:59,200
And what it is,

1538
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:02,080
it gives you a point to point race that whoever gets to the end of the race,

1539
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,120
you get to trade their car.

1540
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:07,040
You get to take their car if it's a higher level or you can upgrade your own.

1541
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:10,200
So you do that until you get to like level 10,

1542
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:15,160
once it gets all the way down to as small of an area as possible, then,

1543
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:20,680
um, you do a last point to point race and whoever gets to that point wins.

1544
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:22,080
But throughout the entire thing,

1545
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:25,640
it's just all these point to point races within the circle. Um,

1546
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:28,640
it looked really cool. It was like a flash tournament, almost like,

1547
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:32,000
just like a really fast tournament in a way. Sort of. Yeah. It's just,

1548
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,240
it's kind of, it's kind of crazy and just the way they had it.

1549
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:38,600
And the other way you can get cars too, is they have like these pickups,

1550
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:42,400
like almost like drops that you can run into and then you get a vehicle pickup.

1551
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:46,200
But, um, so that's one way to do it. But then you can also, you know,

1552
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:49,400
challenge other players for their cars or upgrade your own if they have like a

1553
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:51,960
shittier car than you. I'm into it. It sounds really fun. I'll check it.

1554
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:55,880
I have four surprise and four. Yeah. I need to play pass and the retail one.

1555
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:58,480
So I need to check it out. Yeah. So it's a free thing, right?

1556
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:02,600
It is a free upgrade. So yeah. Nice. We'll have to try that out at some point.

1557
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:04,600
I know Bobby was talking about wanting to play it too. So maybe,

1558
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:08,720
maybe that's a thing we can do on VOG at some point later in the next week or

1559
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:12,240
so. Yeah. Uh, anyway, heading over for some other announcements that came out

1560
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:14,120
this week. So Nintendo did have some announcements,

1561
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:16,600
even if they didn't make any first party announcements at the game awards,

1562
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:21,360
but, uh, they did have their own little, um, uh, indie announcement reel.

1563
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:24,520
They did an indie world, basically. So it's kind of like, think like a direct,

1564
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:26,240
but it was all about like indie stuff. Yeah. Uh,

1565
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:29,120
but we did get some pretty big titles that were dropped here. Uh, for example,

1566
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:33,040
that was dropped or that was launched on the day of the, um, uh,

1567
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:35,880
press thing or the, the video, uh,

1568
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:38,480
the talus principle deluxe edition came out for steam.

1569
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:42,760
So that was out and Dauntless came out. I'm sorry. Yes. On switch. My bad.

1570
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:46,160
The other S thing. Uh, so both of those came out on switch, uh,

1571
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:49,920
with the Nintendo indie world. Uh, so that's pretty cool. Um,

1572
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:52,920
but then there was also other things that were shown. So, um,

1573
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:56,280
axiom verge two was announced. I don't think I played the first,

1574
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:59,160
I have the first one. I haven't played it yet. It's basically,

1575
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:00,600
it's like super Metroid,

1576
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:03,400
but like kind of goes a very different direction with like the hacking and

1577
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:07,680
stuff. And like, it's all one guy. Like it's like produced by,

1578
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:11,280
directed by soundtrack by starred in. It's like the original Halloween,

1579
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:14,080
you know how like John Carpenter actually did that music and the original

1580
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:16,040
Halloween. It's like, yeah, iconic. So that's,

1581
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:17,640
that's basically what axiom verge is.

1582
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:22,560
So axiom verge two is on its way in fall of 2020. So it's still a ways out,

1583
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:26,120
but, um, yeah, I can be technically the first one. Yes, exactly. Uh,

1584
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:29,040
they also kind of give an update on streets or age four and it's coming out in

1585
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:32,040
the first half of 2020. And I know some people are very excited for that game as

1586
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:34,880
well. Um, I don't have time to talk about everything, but, uh,

1587
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:38,040
definitely check out some of those other games that were, uh, uh,

1588
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:41,680
announced as part of indie world. I know I'm looking forward to axiom verge two,

1589
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:44,240
uh, maybe sports story, something you might. Yeah.

1590
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:47,000
Golf story here is really good. It's sports story.

1591
01:07:47,040 --> 01:07:48,880
I know I'm talking about the first one. Oh, right.

1592
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:52,920
It's creators of golf story. It was the first one in that I hear it was pretty

1593
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:54,600
good. Um, sports story.

1594
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:58,120
I do want to check out as well because it sounded pretty awesome. Uh,

1595
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:02,280
skate bird was another developer that I follow on Twitter. Uh, it looks awesome.

1596
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:06,480
It's like Tony Hawk with a tiny little bird. It says super cute. And, um,

1597
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:11,240
just for the name itself, murder by numbers. Yeah.

1598
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:12,960
That sounded interesting as well. Well,

1599
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:15,960
if we're going to go for games with a great title, how about boyfriend dungeon?

1600
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:20,760
The other one is boyfriend dungeon. It's a dating SIM dungeon crawler.

1601
01:08:21,280 --> 01:08:24,880
So I don't know, dark Sakura, I know you like your crazy dating Sims,

1602
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:26,080
so maybe this will be something.

1603
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:28,640
Have you ever wanted to imprison boyfriends in the dungeon?

1604
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,920
I guess that's what this is about. I don't know. Um,

1605
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:34,080
but you basically you make precious memories with different loves and you use

1606
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:37,920
your combat styles to clear out monsters and uncover the dungeon secrets.

1607
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:41,240
I, that doesn't mean I'm lucky them in dungeons.

1608
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:44,840
You might be saving them or something. I don't know.

1609
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:47,760
Dude. So Linda trust. Sure.

1610
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:53,880
Helpless little boys. I like that. All right. So anyway, lots of, uh, indies.

1611
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:57,160
And you know, obviously the switch E-shop has tons and tons and tons of

1612
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:58,520
independent things on it.

1613
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:01,600
And that's really what's kind of bolstered that and, uh,

1614
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:05,080
put it above as far as like how many games are available on it from where even

1615
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:08,560
we, you is that. So that was, um, yeah, that's great. So, all right,

1616
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:09,080
let's move on.

1617
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:11,320
We have more stories for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week.

1618
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:12,920
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us next?

1619
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:16,520
Uh, well, some, uh, GameStop news there,

1620
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:21,120
as we sometimes call it the evil G. Um, well,

1621
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:23,760
they look like they were doing okay. And then guess what happened?

1622
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:30,640
No one's really surprised though. Their, um, uh, revenue,

1623
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:31,440
uh, sorry,

1624
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:35,440
currency adjusted revenue in the third quarter dropped 24.7%

1625
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:40,360
percent. Um, and their hardware sales,

1626
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:46,240
uh, went over 45%. Software was cut by a third and

1627
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:51,120
accessories and pre-owned were down by 13% each for the

1628
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,360
whole period. Um,

1629
01:09:55,480 --> 01:10:00,560
and as far as, you know, in general, they are really,

1630
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:03,640
really, really just going down. Um,

1631
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:08,880
they, they're, uh, suffering from some of the, uh,

1632
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:11,920
release, uh, you know, cause now most of their stuff is toys.

1633
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:14,760
They're really suffering from some releases of some, uh,

1634
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:19,600
relevant franchises is where part of this is going into. But, uh,

1635
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:23,320
the, um, the CEO, uh,

1636
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:28,320
George Sherman is saying that their more important console business

1637
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:33,120
does not look hopeful. And I'll go ahead and read his exact

1638
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:33,960
quote.

1639
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:38,360
The unprecedented decline in the new hardware sales seen across the market as

1640
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:42,120
the current generation of gaming consoles reach the end of their life cycle and

1641
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:47,120
consumers delay their spending and anticipation of new hardware releases was

1642
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:48,880
their excuse.

1643
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:53,520
So it sounds like 2020 might be very much a make or break year for GameStop

1644
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:56,520
because of the new consoles being released. You know, um,

1645
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:59,280
that's going to be some money for them as these consoles are released.

1646
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,240
They'll get their share as they sell these consoles.

1647
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:04,280
But who knows how many of those consoles are really going to be sold at a place

1648
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:05,480
like Amazon and so forth.

1649
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:09,000
They were projected to have a profit of $11 a share,

1650
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:13,240
but it actually dropped down by 40. It's not $11, sorry,

1651
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:17,800
11 cents a share. And instead they actually dropped down 49 cents a share.

1652
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:18,840
Yikes.

1653
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:20,720
That's pretty crazy. And I mean,

1654
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:23,000
and the reason why I bring this up and everyone's like, Oh,

1655
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,480
financial business, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1656
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:30,600
When you're looking at your retailers and also a mark of where trends are going

1657
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:34,920
in the distribution of gaming related

1658
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:39,680
services to have kind of like a mainstay of this falling

1659
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:43,000
behind now to either like the department ish stores, you know,

1660
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:47,000
like a target or a Walmart or a regular department store.

1661
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:50,880
And then we also have a little bit more of a rise of the independent boutique.

1662
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:53,440
Have you noticed that a little bit? Yeah,

1663
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:57,440
that's where your used market is going to,

1664
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:00,520
or those independent boutiques. And then, you know,

1665
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:03,160
cause we have like the game trader here is like supposed to be doing like

1666
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:05,520
pretty, pretty damn good. And you know,

1667
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:09,600
although we did lose our dimples because dimples are the place to really get

1668
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:13,640
games. Right. Didn't the family kind of decide to stop though? Yeah, I guess.

1669
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:16,200
Part of it was, it's not just them wanting to stop.

1670
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:19,280
I think the business side of it was great. Did you hear about Percos by the way?

1671
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:23,080
Are they closing too? Oh no, Perry Perry's. Perry's is doing, but it's,

1672
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:26,160
but it looks like they're going to reopen under new management. Oh, that's cool.

1673
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:28,840
And I've never got to go there. But anyway, back to, you know,

1674
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:32,880
I almost made the joke. Well, is it not the original Perry's anymore?

1675
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:35,520
It would be not the original Perry's,

1676
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:39,440
but if it keeps the name and runs everything the same and maybe,

1677
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:44,240
anyway, so back to GameStop, um, they, um,

1678
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:49,160
actually like even had a couple of, uh, investor, uh,

1679
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:54,200
activists were trying to get GameStop to buy back off,

1680
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:58,400
uh, their stock so that at least the investors would make back a little bit of

1681
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:02,880
money on, you know, what they've spent on it. But yeah, they're,

1682
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:06,720
they're not looking to do very good. And the investors are basically saying,

1683
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:10,320
yeah, GameStop isn't going to be able to buy its way out. It's gonna,

1684
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:13,680
it's just gonna probably crash and burn.

1685
01:13:13,680 --> 01:13:15,600
The next year is going to be the deciding factor.

1686
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:21,040
So right now GameStop stock as of today, so today's what, the 15th?

1687
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:24,640
Yeah. Um, is $5 and 45 cents.

1688
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:29,400
To do a little bit of a, of a comparison, um,

1689
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:33,200
Funko is at $15.15.

1690
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:38,440
Sony's at $67.57. Disney is at $146.38 per share.

1691
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:43,200
Microsoft's at $154.53 per share. So I'm just saying,

1692
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:44,680
but those aren't retail businesses either.

1693
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:49,720
No, but I'm saying to give it a view versus successful companies and then about

1694
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,200
where the scale is.

1695
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,520
GameStop is really heading to,

1696
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:57,480
like I think when JC Penney closed out of business,

1697
01:13:57,480 --> 01:13:59,680
their stock was going for like a dollar or something.

1698
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:02,600
Yeah. So not all JC Penney's are closed either.

1699
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:04,360
They did some type of turnaround with them.

1700
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,200
Well, and did you hear Toys R Us is coming back?

1701
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:10,440
Yeah. The retail thing is so fascinating to me because, you know,

1702
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:12,840
they say the Amazon's killing all of these businesses,

1703
01:14:12,840 --> 01:14:14,640
which I understand is the whole like, you know,

1704
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:18,040
the convenience or whatever of having these delivered to your door and going

1705
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:21,560
online and not having to worry about pressures, salespeople and all that stuff,

1706
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:24,720
you know. But then what's interesting is that where does Amazon go next?

1707
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:27,480
Now they're opening retail stores like, you know, right?

1708
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:30,440
Like their big grocery thing where you just,

1709
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:33,720
you just take it like you stole it off the shelf, right?

1710
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:35,480
There's like no checkers or anything, right?

1711
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:37,600
So it's like Amazon's pushing into the retail space.

1712
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:41,600
And I've heard things about Amazon building bookstores. Isn't that ironic?

1713
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:42,600
So it's just,

1714
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:47,280
it's interesting how that stuff is kind of like circling around and back another

1715
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:51,160
company actually that, no, nevermind. That's, that's old stock report.

1716
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:55,280
I was just going to double check like where some of the retailers are right now

1717
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:59,320
as far as their prices. Um, but, uh, like

1718
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:03,920
I, I don't know, maybe this is a, uh, okay.

1719
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:06,280
Boomer type of thing, even though I'm gen X,

1720
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:10,800
but like I don't like to buy clothes online. I mean, if it's, if it's like,

1721
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,960
like this hoodie, I bought this hoodie online,

1722
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:16,840
but that's because where am I going to find a fucking Atari hoodie with the wood

1723
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:19,640
paneling in this? I'm not going to find that in a retail store. Right.

1724
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:22,760
So like narrow things that I can really only find online, I'll do.

1725
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:25,120
But like if I'm going to buy just like jeans and stuff,

1726
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:26,680
I want to kind of like try them on and stuff.

1727
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:29,400
Like you can't really do that online cause everything's different sizing with

1728
01:15:29,400 --> 01:15:32,360
the brands. Right. So I don't know. I'm just very like, I,

1729
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:35,600
I hope closed stores don't all go away cause I like to be able to walk into a

1730
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:37,520
store and try things on, you know?

1731
01:15:38,120 --> 01:15:43,120
So I did just a quick relaunch to double check some of these best buy. Okay.

1732
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:47,320
Best buy stock right now is 84 roughly $84. Um,

1733
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:50,760
just in some of these other ones, I mean like,

1734
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:56,240
there are some out here that are like 41 cents.

1735
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:01,800
I don't know how they're getting around that way, but like just some of the,

1736
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:05,640
the electronics, you know, manufacturers right now there you've got,

1737
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:10,880
I would probably say like a good average is going to be between like I'd say

1738
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:14,960
eight and 20 although yeah, the best, the biggest one on here is best buy,

1739
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:17,720
which they got over a big slump. Right. Well, you know,

1740
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:20,800
and they say target is still doing very well in the face of all this stuff.

1741
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:23,800
The target is thriving even though it looked like they were in trouble for a

1742
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:24,200
little bit,

1743
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:27,560
but they're really doing very well because I guess they've embraced a lot of the

1744
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:30,560
whole, like, you know, bring it to your car if you order it online or whatever.

1745
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:34,480
I target is always like that place where it's like, uh,

1746
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:36,000
we just need this one small thing,

1747
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,440
but let's go to target and buy a bunch of shit we don't need.

1748
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:42,480
Like that it fulfills that even target now sell shirts. Yeah.

1749
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:47,280
Say that like I came into target for one thing and left with everything or

1750
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:50,560
something like this shirt. Yeah, exactly. Uh, let's see.

1751
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:52,680
There was a comment in chat I wanted to read here, um,

1752
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:55,000
especially cause I don't recognize the name. I like to hear from new people too.

1753
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:56,640
Uh, here it is. Uh, Phoenix,

1754
01:16:56,680 --> 01:17:01,120
77 26 and chat says there are still lots of Indies though and talking about the

1755
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:04,520
stores and in some sense that might be good for them though. I would not,

1756
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:08,440
I would not like to see a whole lot of people lose their jobs. That's true.

1757
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:10,400
As much as we might sit here and say, you know,

1758
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:14,920
GameStop sucks and all this stuff. Uh, it's still a lot of people, any,

1759
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:18,920
any bad decision that GameStop has made was not made by the hardworking people

1760
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:21,200
making way too little money, uh,

1761
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:24,560
working at the different mall stores and things of that nature. Um, you know,

1762
01:17:24,560 --> 01:17:25,080
it's, it's,

1763
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:27,880
it's executives in a boardroom somewhere that make all the bonehead decisions,

1764
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:31,120
but who's going to suffer, you know, if GameStop goes under,

1765
01:17:31,120 --> 01:17:33,840
it'll be all those people on the front line. So, you know,

1766
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:39,240
you hope that something will come in to take the place of GameStop if they do go

1767
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:41,920
under. So that way people have a place to work, right?

1768
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:46,720
Well, and actually I made a friend at a GameStop. Um,

1769
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:50,240
if Maddie's listening, hi Maddie, if not, you're probably working. Um,

1770
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:54,880
but at any rate, um, it, when I was in there,

1771
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:55,800
it was pretty dead.

1772
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,800
I do notice the attitude of a lot of games. Cause you know,

1773
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:03,080
we've all been into the GameStop when we've had that employee that's like the

1774
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:06,600
drunk with power type that like tries to gatekeep everything. Right.

1775
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:09,400
And it's like, how annoying is that? Right. But like,

1776
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:13,880
I feel like I don't see those like somehow one thing GameStop's done right is

1777
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:15,960
they've really weeded a lot of those people out. Cause yeah,

1778
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:18,120
I would say anytime I have set foot in a game,

1779
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:20,640
cause Alan still likes to be all like, let's go look at what's on sale.

1780
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:21,560
Let's go look at the used games.

1781
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:23,520
So I'll get dragged into a GameStop once in a while.

1782
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:25,840
And I got to say most of the people that are working there these days,

1783
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:27,040
pretty cool people.

1784
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:30,960
Like I don't get a lot of that attitude that I used to get maybe five years ago,

1785
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:32,520
once in a while. And it wasn't from every,

1786
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:36,080
it would just be that one that you'd remember where you're like, ugh, you know,

1787
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:37,160
so.

1788
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:38,000
Well,

1789
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:42,200
I have the notice and they've really kind of relaxed a lot of their,

1790
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:45,200
their like policy for their employees. Have you noticed?

1791
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:47,040
Like,

1792
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:50,040
Oh yeah, they don't have to upsell you everything that they used to do.

1793
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:51,240
Yeah, I think.

1794
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:54,800
Well, I think when you're hurting the way they are,

1795
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,600
it doesn't make sense to do something like that.

1796
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:58,000
Cause it's just driving people away.

1797
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:00,120
So I think they realize that that would,

1798
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:02,160
that type of thing when it's like,

1799
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:05,720
if you go into the store and then you get essentially harassed about,

1800
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:07,840
did you preorder this? Did you put $5 on this?

1801
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:10,000
Do you want the warranty package? You want all this?

1802
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:13,280
That's what was driving people to go to Amazon in the first place.

1803
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:15,880
Because on Amazon it was click done. I got it.

1804
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:17,520
And I wasn't harassed about anything else.

1805
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:20,080
And I think retailers finally wised up to that,

1806
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:22,880
that that's why they were losing a lot of business to Amazon was that,

1807
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,720
that pressure that people didn't want to deal with.

1808
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,960
Yeah. So anyway, all right. A little bit of a tangent, but a good one.

1809
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:32,360
Let's continue on and talk about not so great business decisions.

1810
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:33,560
Loki.

1811
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:38,040
Yes. This is not surprising coming from Activision,

1812
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:43,040
but unfortunately it is something that we're finding to be the case nowadays.

1813
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:46,520
So Activision with Call of Duty,

1814
01:19:46,680 --> 01:19:51,200
one of the things that players especially that are really into Call of Duty

1815
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:53,920
and kind of take it more seriously is their kill death ratio.

1816
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:55,920
And they want to know how well they're doing.

1817
01:19:56,280 --> 01:20:01,280
So previously I think what they had done is actually showed that in the,

1818
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:03,320
the final score screen,

1819
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:06,080
they kind of showed everybody's kill death ratio on there.

1820
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:12,160
But apparently they said that that led to harassing or harassment from other

1821
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:15,800
players if you didn't do so well. So you would think, okay,

1822
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:17,680
the simple thing to do would then be,

1823
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:21,280
let's just not let everybody see that kill death ratio.

1824
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:24,720
How about only you get to see that kill death ratio? Well,

1825
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:28,080
what ended up actually happening is they just took it out altogether.

1826
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:33,840
But if you're interested to actually find out what your kill death ratio is on

1827
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:39,440
the fly, you can pay for the $20 Mother Russia bundle,

1828
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:44,680
which includes 10 pieces of cosmetics and also includes this time to die watch

1829
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:48,240
that shows your kills and deaths.

1830
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:54,920
So you have to pay $20 to bring back a feature that was taken out of the game by

1831
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:56,400
Activision.

1832
01:20:56,680 --> 01:21:01,200
Or you could get a notepad and make notes yourself on, Oh, I killed that many.

1833
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:04,720
I killed that guy. I killed that. And then I got killed. So you could take notes.

1834
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:11,480
It is silly. No, it's really silly. Uh, so you know what you have to do, right?

1835
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:15,600
You have to not buy it because voting with your wallet is the most important

1836
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:17,320
thing. If you think this is stupid, then don't buy it.

1837
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:18,800
But if you think this is really stupid,

1838
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:21,120
don't buy the game that it's featured in because it is,

1839
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:22,520
it is a little bit ridiculous. Like,

1840
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:26,120
especially if the stat was there and then they removed it, you know,

1841
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:29,280
only to put it back in some type of cosmetic that does seem really silly.

1842
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:30,840
It, it is. And it's,

1843
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:34,920
it's something that's like kind of integral to the game,

1844
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:37,440
especially if you're playing, like you're trying to, you know,

1845
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:40,560
take it a little bit seriously and be more competitive with it.

1846
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:44,560
But the fact that they take it out because they want to make the game more

1847
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:47,800
approachable for other players, which is stupid, just don't make it public.

1848
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:50,240
Then you know that like, that's what you need to do.

1849
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:52,760
But instead you just wanted to sell you.

1850
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:56,320
You probably plan to do this where you sell it back because well,

1851
01:21:56,440 --> 01:22:00,960
it's coming out like two months after the game has been out. I mean,

1852
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:05,160
come on. It was intentional. They planned on doing this. It's stupid.

1853
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:06,200
It was a little silly,

1854
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:10,200
but this isn't a series that I've super gotten into anyway.

1855
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:13,520
And this doesn't exactly encourage me to start. Um,

1856
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:16,480
a series I would have gotten into had it been released would have been, uh,

1857
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:19,360
Hideo Kojima's take on silent Hills, which of course,

1858
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:22,000
as we know now was all, uh, unveiled, uh, and,

1859
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:26,560
and started with a demo called PT. Uh, and, uh, years later,

1860
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:30,920
years later, people still obsessing about PT and with good reason,

1861
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:34,720
it was great and finding new things about it. Um, and dark soccer,

1862
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:37,520
this is the type of thing that is up your alley, actually this sort of hat.

1863
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:40,480
Cause you've kind of done these things, uh, with mass effect and some other

1864
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:41,000
games,

1865
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:45,240
but basically what happened is that there was a camera mod that somebody was

1866
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:48,200
able to install into PT price. Hasn't happened earlier. Yeah.

1867
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:50,280
That was kind of the surprise for me too, is that, wow,

1868
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:53,120
they just now got the camera mod in, but it might also be the fact, you know,

1869
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:56,160
it's not PC it's console. So it takes a little longer. Uh,

1870
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:59,520
it wasn't actually retail game either, but anyway, however they did it,

1871
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:01,360
the camera modding trick finally happened.

1872
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:05,200
And what they were able to do with it is that to actually see by having like the

1873
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:08,760
character in a mirror and using the camera mod, long story short,

1874
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:13,200
PT takes place from the first person perspective and you are actually playing as

1875
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:17,600
Norman Reedus in that game. So when they use the camera trick, they found, Oh,

1876
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:22,240
the, the player character is Norman Reedus completely clean up that mirror. Yeah.

1877
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:24,880
In order to be able to do that. But that is it. Uh,

1878
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:27,480
that came from a tweet from man fight dragon,

1879
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:31,080
who I think was one of the moderate folks behind this saying just to put any

1880
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:33,320
uncertainty finally to rest after all this time. Yes.

1881
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:37,360
The guy you play as in PT is the same guy you see in the ending cinematic.

1882
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:41,320
Not that there was any real doubt, but yeah, it's Norman Reedus the whole time.

1883
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:45,600
So there you go. Um, some other things that have come out about PT recently, uh,

1884
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:50,120
the ghost woman, Lisa, always behind you. Yeah. In the game.

1885
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:53,640
That's something else that, uh, with the little camera trick found out, uh,

1886
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:56,360
some cut content from the demo in the bathtub.

1887
01:23:56,560 --> 01:24:00,240
Apparently the tub has water in it at one point, but in another point it's empty.

1888
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:02,880
But there was another scenario where the tub is full,

1889
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:07,640
but there's a decapitated body in it. Great. Lovely. Merry Christmas.

1890
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:12,080
That's my favorite. That's where I put my decapitated body.

1891
01:24:12,600 --> 01:24:16,560
It was in the tub. I filled with water and that head somewhere singing.

1892
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:19,280
I ain't got nobody. All right. Anyway,

1893
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,920
I just love that years later we're still upset and Kojima finally started and

1894
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:26,160
released a new game.

1895
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:31,120
Also starring Norman Reedus and we're still obsessed with PT,

1896
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:34,480
but I understand. I totally get it. All right. Stupid.

1897
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:38,160
Right behind you. I, I, I want,

1898
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:42,720
I've never wanted a stupid rumor to be truer in my whole life than the one

1899
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:43,720
where, uh,

1900
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:47,760
Konami and Kojima have sat down and worked out Kojima productions taking Silent

1901
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:51,320
Hill because I talked about this. Did that come up on the show? I don't know.

1902
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:53,840
I remember saying, that's what Konami should do.

1903
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:57,040
If Konami wanted to really win favor back, they're not doing anything with it.

1904
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:58,760
Fucking get a cut,

1905
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:02,440
give it to somebody who's going to do good with it and get a fucking cut of it

1906
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:03,720
because it's your IP.

1907
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:07,760
And so if that's true that they really did sit down with Kojima and hash out

1908
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:10,800
their beef. And that's why they say, that's why, um,

1909
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:15,680
that guy left because apparently he was pissed that Kojima was even talking to

1910
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:17,520
Konami again. And so he left again.

1911
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:21,680
This is all rumors and drama and probably made up because look where the rumors

1912
01:25:21,680 --> 01:25:25,760
and the game awards got us. But God damn, if it isn't fun to fantasize about that,

1913
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:27,880
I mean, what's the, what's the best we got at Konami,

1914
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:32,120
a new contour game that sucks ass. So a new metal gear game that sucks ass.

1915
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:36,600
Kojima has been talking about doing a horror game.

1916
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,560
So I don't know. I, we,

1917
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:43,360
just because we want it to be true doesn't mean it is, but man,

1918
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:46,480
it would be a holiday miracle if that ended up happening.

1919
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:50,640
I would love that so much. So anyhow, moving on.

1920
01:25:51,480 --> 01:25:54,360
I was watching the video. All right. So well,

1921
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:59,200
we're going to travel back to a simpler time before there were camera hacks and

1922
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:02,400
things like this because everything was, there was a, yeah, cameras,

1923
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:03,880
everything was a fricking Sprite.

1924
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:05,640
It's the classic game of the week.

1925
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:06,960
And every week you're on the program,

1926
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:10,400
dark soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, Hey,

1927
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:13,160
you should be checking this game out. You little brat.

1928
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,920
I went back 30 years. Sometimes, sometimes it's a, it's a good game.

1929
01:26:18,920 --> 01:26:22,000
Sometimes it's a not so good game. I'm not sure. Good game.

1930
01:26:22,120 --> 01:26:26,520
I think this was a good game as well. It had a sequel. It was, it is. I,

1931
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:28,960
and I remember playing this game, which is interesting because I didn't have this

1932
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:29,600
system,

1933
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:34,600
but I think this is also a game that got accused a lot of copying somebody

1934
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:39,080
else's. Oh yeah, it's totally a clone, but it, it did very well for itself.

1935
01:26:39,120 --> 01:26:41,680
But anyway, with that dark soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

1936
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:43,080
I picked new Topia.

1937
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:46,160
New Topia came out, um,

1938
01:26:46,360 --> 01:26:49,680
on November 17th, 1989 in Japan.

1939
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:54,920
And, uh, it had a us releases that came out in 1990.

1940
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:57,600
And so basically the game,

1941
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:02,240
it really plays a lot like the first legend of Zelda.

1942
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:07,720
Graphically a bit better. Um, but it came out for the PC engine,

1943
01:27:07,720 --> 01:27:09,600
also known as the turbo graphics 16.

1944
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:15,080
It did get a release for virtual console for Wii in 2007 and in Japan for Wii U

1945
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:17,760
on April 16th, 2014.

1946
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:22,560
And we released some PlayStation network in Japan in 2010 and North America,

1947
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:23,400
2011.

1948
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:28,480
So basically you're in a land called new Topia and this demon called dearth

1949
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:33,280
captured princess Aurora and stolen eight ancient medallions.

1950
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:37,280
They contain the wisdom to seal away the demon.

1951
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:40,040
Sound familiar? Um,

1952
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:45,160
so you have to play as a protagonist named Josetta to retrieve the medallions,

1953
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:49,200
defeat the demon and rescue the princess and save the land.

1954
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:54,680
It is basically a legend of Zelda clone in almost every possible way.

1955
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:58,880
It did of course make some improvements, but of course, you know,

1956
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:01,920
graphically it's a little bit better, you know, better.

1957
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:06,160
I would say while the tunes in Zelda are better than musical quality is a little

1958
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:10,320
bit better. It, um, did overcome overcome some of the shortcomings.

1959
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:15,320
It has long passwords unless you use the add on battery pack.

1960
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:21,080
Um, it does have some repetitive gameplay, some poor collision detection. Um,

1961
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:26,320
but overall it's considered to be one of the better games of its type and it was

1962
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:33,320
good enough to get a sequel where just that a son take takes over for him.

1963
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:38,320
Um, so basically, um,

1964
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:43,320
it is an over kind of the semi overhead action shooter. Like, you know,

1965
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:48,160
as you can probably see from whoever's watching the video right now. Um,

1966
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:53,200
so you have to go into these crypts to find the medallions and defeat each boss

1967
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:58,080
to get the medallion. And then, um, you know,

1968
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:02,680
you also have a life meter, um, your gold,

1969
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:07,240
everything is just on screen status. I mean it is really, really very,

1970
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:09,520
very Zelda. Um,

1971
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:11,880
you have a lot of enemies that are even very similar,

1972
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:16,880
like rocks and ghosts and nights that charge you and spear throwing goblins.

1973
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:24,360
Um, now a couple of other things too, um, is that, uh,

1974
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:24,880
you know,

1975
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:28,160
your life meter is going to increase when you get a medallion kind of like using

1976
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:31,840
the hearts. Um, you also can get an option,

1977
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:35,680
an item called the book of revival that lets you continue and restart from where

1978
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:39,400
you last got a password, even after the console has been shut off.

1979
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:42,120
But your password will also let you resume your game.

1980
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:46,840
And if you have the turbo graphic CD or turbo booster plus,

1981
01:29:47,240 --> 01:29:51,600
you can save your progress in the system ram via a quote file cabinet feature.

1982
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:55,080
Um, kind of like the passwords, but you know,

1983
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:59,800
it's on system memory and not something cause I mean it was a hue card. Um,

1984
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:04,360
you know, the hue cards being also wasn't as the turbo chip. Yeah. Um,

1985
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:10,160
and uh, of course this game was also published by Hudson soft. Um,

1986
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:13,480
it was considered, like I said, again,

1987
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:17,960
the Zelda of the PC engine era. But, um,

1988
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:23,240
it was again, pretty well loved and that wasn't a terrible game.

1989
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:25,760
But also though, um,

1990
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:30,360
I did point out that new Tobia came out two years before legend of Zelda linked

1991
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:32,360
to the past. Um,

1992
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:36,800
and that it was trying to basically stay with the Nintendo curve.

1993
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:41,280
A couple of other things though about this one is that people felt that the boss

1994
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:44,800
battles were boring and long. Passwords are also boring and long.

1995
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:49,720
And it had a references to Judaism,

1996
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:54,720
Islam and quotes from star Wars that kind of made people go, what?

1997
01:30:55,880 --> 01:30:59,160
Um, so at any rate, you know,

1998
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:01,800
it's a pretty simple game.

1999
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:06,440
It's fun to play through and it doesn't suck completely. It's just,

2000
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:07,920
it's not as old, it's not Zelda,

2001
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:12,240
but it's worth mentioning because there was a bit of a stink over this game when

2002
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:14,200
it came out. So there you go.

2003
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:21,120
The game is new Topia. It looks very much like Zelda. Have you ever played it?

2004
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:26,160
Nope. Well, it looks just like Zelda. It really does. I mean,

2005
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:31,120
like even like the way that stairs appear and the little sword sticking out,

2006
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:35,960
it was enemies go out and in and out of the ground. It really is a clone.

2007
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:39,080
I swear I played this game once. Um,

2008
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:42,840
but I don't know how because I never owned a turbo graphics 16 so maybe a

2009
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:45,640
friend. Yeah, I must've been a friend that I demo. Well, I mean,

2010
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:47,320
I knew it was on, we were in that stuff too,

2011
01:31:47,320 --> 01:31:50,080
but I'm pretty sure I didn't buy it on those. So I don't know.

2012
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:53,840
I also feel like maybe I played a very similar type of game. Like,

2013
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,400
like a lagoon on the super Nintendo had a lot of kind of like common stuff,

2014
01:31:57,400 --> 01:32:01,160
I think. So I don't know. Maybe I'm just confusing it with other stuff,

2015
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:04,520
which is very possible. So, uh, Dr. C and chat says, you know,

2016
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:06,960
I don't think Rob mentioned crystalis in his gaming week.

2017
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:09,480
Speaking of Zelda clones. Yeah, he's right.

2018
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:11,080
I did leave that out my gaming week on accident.

2019
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:14,720
I did a hour stream yesterday or the day before where I was playing crystalis,

2020
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:18,120
which is another kind of Zelda E type clone because they just put that out on

2021
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:21,520
the super, or excuse me, the NES switch online library.

2022
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:25,000
So it was fun to go visit that. So, but anyway, there it is,

2023
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:28,600
your classic game of the week, utopia. So what made you think of that?

2024
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:30,640
What made you pick that one this week?

2025
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:33,440
Because I found my copy of utopia. Oh, there you go.

2026
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:39,480
You should, I wish you streamed more of these classic games yourself.

2027
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:40,840
It'd be fun to watch. Well,

2028
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:44,040
as soon as they can get his computer that's not going to shut down every time

2029
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:48,000
I'm trying to do something with it. Yeah. Uh, Bobby black Wolf and chat says,

2030
01:32:48,020 --> 01:32:51,040
what did you learn about safe States this week? Rob? Yeah. Save now,

2031
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:54,840
save often, but also make sure you're actually saving and not loading.

2032
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:59,360
That was the other thing I learned this week. Oops. All right.

2033
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:03,480
Anyhow, let's move on. We got plenty more show to go. Uh, pretty soon though,

2034
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:07,640
probably in the next 30 minutes or so, we will get to, uh, the discord, uh,

2035
01:33:07,680 --> 01:33:11,840
calls if you want to call in tonight over at vog network.com slash discord.

2036
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:13,160
But in the meantime,

2037
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:16,360
we're going to get to some rapid fire news and talk about a couple other

2038
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:20,000
headlines pretty quickly here. So, uh, Loki, why don't you start us off?

2039
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:25,080
So moral combat is going to be more kind of 11 is going to be getting cross

2040
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:27,920
play with K because it's more combat and everything.

2041
01:33:27,920 --> 01:33:30,640
They have to begin with the K, um,

2042
01:33:30,660 --> 01:33:34,520
between places where an X-Box one is part of their upcoming patch.

2043
01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:38,680
And, um, that's pretty awesome. They'll have that available.

2044
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:42,800
I don't care about them anymore. Okay.

2045
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,240
You don't care about cross play or mortal combat,

2046
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:48,520
about mortal combat because of Rhonda Rousey being anti-trans. Oh, I, that was,

2047
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:52,880
that's old, but she still is. Yeah. And, um, how they ruined Sindel.

2048
01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:57,080
Oh yeah. I didn't, I don't care for what they did to Sindel, but, um, yeah,

2049
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:00,640
but, uh, cross play is a good thing. At least I forgot to mention,

2050
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:03,960
I may have played Minecraft on PS4 this week. That's kind of, kind of relevant,

2051
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:06,400
but anyway, moving on. Yeah. Uh,

2052
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:11,440
Tetris 99's dropped a new update that allows team battle mode along with the,

2053
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:18,480
um, was it the 10th Maximus cup that's going to be coming soon.

2054
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,720
So, um,

2055
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:23,600
that's pretty cool that you can now battle with up to,

2056
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:27,680
it looks like it's teams of 10 maybe or no,

2057
01:34:27,720 --> 01:34:32,120
probably like 12. I know the one screenshot I'm looking at, it's like, um,

2058
01:34:32,160 --> 01:34:36,640
well 99, I guess it seems like there's a whole lot less than 99 players on there

2059
01:34:36,660 --> 01:34:39,960
though. So maybe 25. Um,

2060
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:44,440
and then let's see what else. So that'll be coming,

2061
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:47,680
or that's already come out in the 10th, uh,

2062
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:52,240
Maximus cup is actually starting tomorrow. All right. Busy, busy.

2063
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:55,280
All right. Um, moving on to, uh,

2064
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:59,240
some kind of big news in the Bioshock universe is that a new Bioshock title was

2065
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:02,520
confirmed, but that's it. Just that we know a new Bioshock is in development,

2066
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:04,760
but of course a new Bioshock's in development.

2067
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:07,600
That franchise is pretty legendary. Well, they did tease that. Yeah,

2068
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:09,200
there's a new one coming. Yeah, but we don't,

2069
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:10,560
we literally know nothing about it,

2070
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:15,080
but here's what we do know is that 2k games founded a new studio called cloud

2071
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:19,920
chamber. It's two teams in San Francisco and Montreal as well. Uh,

2072
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:24,020
and they are working on the new Bioshock game, whatever that is.

2073
01:35:24,040 --> 01:35:26,520
They're saying it will be in development for the next several years.

2074
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:31,560
So this also means likely it's a PlayStation five new Xbox type of game.

2075
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:34,600
I'm down. All of the Bioshock games have been amazing.

2076
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:37,760
Bioshock is a really great series. Although I never did finish two.

2077
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:39,680
That's the only one that I did not finish.

2078
01:35:39,720 --> 01:35:44,160
But two was kind of the one that wasn't really by like, it was like, it wasn't,

2079
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:46,760
it was just kind of like a cash follow up to the first one.

2080
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:49,760
Did you ever play infinite? I did play it not from start to finish,

2081
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:51,600
but I did play it. It is a great,

2082
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:54,920
like you got to play it all the way to the end cause it's, it's such a good game.

2083
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:58,640
I need to go back, especially now that I think then they do remasters for all

2084
01:35:58,640 --> 01:36:01,840
those. So I need to go back and play that cause I'm pretty sure,

2085
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:03,440
I know I have one and two, uh,

2086
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:07,560
questmaster says Ken Levine is not involved with the new game though. Um,

2087
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:08,320
and, uh,

2088
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:11,560
that could be maybe a red flag when you consider he wasn't involved with the

2089
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:15,720
actual Bioshock two either. Um, you know, let's give it a chance.

2090
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:19,400
It might end up being really good, so we'll see. Uh,

2091
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:21,360
it's still very early on. Hopefully, uh,

2092
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:23,760
it'll be a really great looking game too. Uh,

2093
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:26,680
this one goes out to dark Tetsuya cause I know it's one of his faves,

2094
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:30,720
but it's definitely worth saying that La Mulana one and two remasters are

2095
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:33,120
confirmed for a Nintendo switch in March.

2096
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:36,920
There's a whole fricking like combo pack collectors edition,

2097
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:38,280
like with a fricking puzzle,

2098
01:36:38,280 --> 01:36:41,520
like an actual puzzle that you could put together, which is pretty cool. Uh,

2099
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:44,840
the remastered bundle on the 17th of March in North America,

2100
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:47,000
which does St. Patrick's day, how convenient, uh,

2101
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:50,960
20th of March in Europe and, uh, in other regions like Oceania, uh,

2102
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,840
27th of March. So March, March,

2103
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:56,640
2020 continues to be a huge week in games.

2104
01:36:56,840 --> 01:37:00,760
I worry this one's going to get lost in scary, sorry. Yes. A large month in games.

2105
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Uh, I worry this one's going to get lost in the shuffle unless you're dark

2106
01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:08,600
Tetsuya, who I'm sure already has this on pre-order. Uh, but no,

2107
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:11,560
very cool. And, uh, yeah, I know these games are like crazy hard.

2108
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:13,560
I have played a little bit of the first one and it's a,

2109
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:16,840
it's a difficult game, but they're fun. So, all right,

2110
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:19,400
moving on to a dark Sakura in your news.

2111
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:25,000
Well, what would be nice is if it wouldn't, uh, give me like a, uh,

2112
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:28,920
little pop up whenever I'm trying to read something. So, um,

2113
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:33,760
one of the actresses that I actually have still been following for a little

2114
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:38,760
while is a Kuriyama Chiaki who was in battle royale and in, uh,

2115
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:42,280
Kill Bill. She was Gogo Yubari, right? Yep.

2116
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:47,600
But I still knew her first in battle royale. Well, here at OLR,

2117
01:37:47,620 --> 01:37:50,280
we were all watching that battle royale years ago. Yeah.

2118
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:52,960
But certainly I think most people saw her in Kill Bill for sure. Yeah.

2119
01:37:53,680 --> 01:37:54,480
At any rate,

2120
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:59,040
she is going to be playing a police officer named, uh,

2121
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:04,000
Satchimura Akane in, um, the game, uh,

2122
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:09,720
Death Comes True, which I'm excited about because it's by, uh,

2123
01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:15,600
um, the Danganronpa dude, uh, uh, Kuraka Kazutaka.

2124
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:20,280
And she's going to be, uh, basically the same,

2125
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:25,000
this woman in the same hotel room that the main character woke up in shows up

2126
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:29,280
unconscious and tied up. And she's a private police investigator.

2127
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:32,920
So I am looking forward to, uh,

2128
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:38,400
to seeing her, uh, in that game. And it's, it's a full motion video game,

2129
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:43,080
by the way. So that'll be interesting. And then, um, also, uh,

2130
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:45,280
uh,

2131
01:38:45,280 --> 01:38:50,280
there is going to be a pre-order for limited physical edition print of Watam for

2132
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:54,120
PS4 and a vinyl soundtrack. Um,

2133
01:38:54,160 --> 01:38:58,720
it looks like we've already missed it. It was going live on December 12th,

2134
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:04,240
but it's got cute covers with apples and sushi and eggs and things on it.

2135
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:07,400
It's so cute. I figured this also served as a good reminder.

2136
01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:10,640
The game is coming very soon. Yeah. I'm looking forward to it.

2137
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:15,800
Don't spoil my gaming week or release announcements.

2138
01:39:16,160 --> 01:39:18,320
Oh, my bad. Sorry. Yeah.

2139
01:39:18,360 --> 01:39:22,440
All the album artwork is actually done by Takahashi. So that's pretty cool.

2140
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:26,040
Yay. All right. Well, with that,

2141
01:39:26,040 --> 01:39:28,800
let's travel around the world and check out some release dates. Loki,

2142
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:32,000
whatever could be coming out in the U S this week. She's I don't know. Rob,

2143
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:36,320
what could be coming out this week? Only want them. It's on a game.

2144
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:39,400
I really want, um, it's on PC and PlayStation four,

2145
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:42,960
but you already know that cause he spoiled it for you already. Yeah.

2146
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:45,680
Deal with it. That's it. That's all we have. That's it.

2147
01:39:45,680 --> 01:39:48,960
That's the only release this week. Yes. Okay. Wow. I mean,

2148
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:51,800
unless you count a title goose game, which is coming out digitally.

2149
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:55,000
I didn't know I was like literally ruining the whole segment. My bad. No, no,

2150
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:58,480
no. In fact, actually, um,

2151
01:39:58,760 --> 01:40:00,720
I thought I had a list of, um,

2152
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:04,360
the digital games that are coming out this week as well. Yes. So here,

2153
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:07,760
let me read over some of the digital games that normally I would skip over

2154
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:11,000
because they're not on my list. Um, so as I mentioned,

2155
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:14,480
entitled goose games coming out in PlayStation four and Xbox one,

2156
01:40:14,840 --> 01:40:19,560
we have a Zeno Raptor on PlayStation four Tamashi on

2157
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:20,680
PlayStation four.

2158
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:26,160
I don't know a lot of these games sin chess on PC.

2159
01:40:26,200 --> 01:40:31,120
I'm just going to read all the good ones. All the fun named ones sweater. Okay.

2160
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:36,480
The dialogy on PC. Uh, we have gun volt Chronicles,

2161
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:38,640
luminous adventure. Um,

2162
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:43,040
I X on Xbox one mirror. Huh?

2163
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:47,560
Did you say I X or nine? I X. That's not nine. Nothing.

2164
01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:48,960
Okay.

2165
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:52,360
It's it's a lurk isn't, they're not trying to be, um,

2166
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:56,120
doing Roman numerals there. It's lowercase I X.

2167
01:40:57,160 --> 01:41:01,680
So I'm assuming that as I X it X what it X it is.

2168
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:06,520
Oh geez. Oh no. My rabbits are gone on PC.

2169
01:41:07,720 --> 01:41:11,000
Uh, one idly and the dinner party on PC.

2170
01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:16,280
I kind of play some of these games and last but not least a game that I think

2171
01:41:16,280 --> 01:41:19,920
Jamie would like soccer pinball and PlayStation four. Oh cool.

2172
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:22,040
But it's not world cup soccer, but it's still soccer.

2173
01:41:23,560 --> 01:41:28,520
All right, well let's travel over. Wait, wait, wait. And last but not least on PC.

2174
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:33,560
I kid you not. This is an actual title is coming on PC this week. Okay.

2175
01:41:33,560 --> 01:41:34,400
Boomer.

2176
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:40,080
Somebody is cashing in on that fast. I love it.

2177
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:43,840
All right. All right. Anyway, you need a game called gen X versus the world.

2178
01:41:44,120 --> 01:41:48,040
Now may I get in a car and go to Japan? Go. All right, here we go.

2179
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:52,800
Drive across the ocean, Rob. I will. Okay. It's a Christmas miracle. Uh,

2180
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:56,080
moving on to a Japanese release dates. We're going to start with the switch.

2181
01:41:56,080 --> 01:41:57,440
We have a few games coming out,

2182
01:41:57,440 --> 01:42:01,040
including Busta fellows where the S is a dollar sign. Uh,

2183
01:42:01,080 --> 01:42:03,320
you play us like a lawyer, I think. Anyway, uh,

2184
01:42:03,320 --> 01:42:06,720
that is a game that's coming out on the switch as well as a giant five in one

2185
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:10,760
rock man and rock man X collection. So that is of course, mega man.

2186
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:12,400
It's both mega man collections,

2187
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:16,920
both mega man X collections and then rock man 11 like all in one big box set.

2188
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:20,360
It actually looks pretty sweet. Uh, if I was, you know, in Japan,

2189
01:42:20,360 --> 01:42:21,320
I might want to pick that up,

2190
01:42:21,320 --> 01:42:23,120
but it's going to cost you an arm and a leg to import it.

2191
01:42:23,120 --> 01:42:25,160
So I don't know if you really want to do that. Uh,

2192
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:27,680
some other games that are coming out on the switch on the 19th, uh,

2193
01:42:27,680 --> 01:42:32,520
we have warriors Orochi for ultimate is coming out as well as DC for

2194
01:42:33,440 --> 01:42:34,280
is out this weekend.

2195
01:42:34,280 --> 01:42:38,920
ESP rod day side in regular and limited edition from M two,

2196
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:43,240
uh, checking out the PlayStation four this week. Uh, a lot of the same stuff.

2197
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:45,480
We have that ESP rod day side. Uh,

2198
01:42:45,480 --> 01:42:49,040
DC to Capo is out and the rock man bundle edition is also out.

2199
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:53,560
That is all again on PlayStation four as well. Uh, and uh,

2200
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:58,600
the surge two is also out this week in Japan as well as ancestors legacy.

2201
01:42:58,840 --> 01:42:59,080
Uh,

2202
01:42:59,080 --> 01:43:03,280
also if you want to get a nice price reduction on earth defense force five dream

2203
01:43:03,280 --> 01:43:06,160
value set, that is something available to you in Japan this week.

2204
01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:10,040
So there you go. That's Japanese releases a little more exciting over there.

2205
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:13,760
I also wanted to mention because I did catch this at the very end there, uh,

2206
01:43:13,780 --> 01:43:17,160
that there is a game called slippery sausages coming out in PC and Mac as well.

2207
01:43:18,320 --> 01:43:18,680
Oh,

2208
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:19,640
oh girl.

2209
01:43:20,720 --> 01:43:23,480
All right. Uh, let's move on. Dark Sakura. How about the UK?

2210
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:27,640
So, um, not really much on the list. These are all on the 16th.

2211
01:43:27,960 --> 01:43:32,040
We have a never winter nights enhanced edition collectors pack and we also have

2212
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:37,320
planescape torment ice wind Dale, uh, enhanced edition collectors pack.

2213
01:43:37,960 --> 01:43:41,520
Um, both of those are for the big three. Um,

2214
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:44,840
we also have a Baldur's gate enhanced edition collectors patch also for the big

2215
01:43:44,840 --> 01:43:48,840
three, uh, pack. Sorry. And then Avicii, uh,

2216
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:54,240
in vector again for, uh, looks like PC and Xbox.

2217
01:43:54,240 --> 01:43:55,080
Okay.

2218
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:59,240
Sorry. I have an autoplay. You think your popups are bad.

2219
01:43:59,240 --> 01:44:00,800
I got autoplay and commercials over here.

2220
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:03,480
That sounds like garbage video autoplay video is garbage.

2221
01:44:03,480 --> 01:44:06,720
If your website has it, you're garbage and you should be ashamed of yourself.

2222
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:10,200
All right, well my next story is from CBS sports so that we should also be

2223
01:44:10,200 --> 01:44:12,900
ashamed of yourself. All right, well it's, it's relevant.

2224
01:44:12,900 --> 01:44:16,920
You can see on the sidebar what it is, but anyway, but that's it. All right.

2225
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:19,680
That's it for UK releases. Uh, let's go to the mailbag. Uh,

2226
01:44:19,700 --> 01:44:23,280
you guys can email us participate at orange launch trader.com is the place to

2227
01:44:23,320 --> 01:44:26,560
send us emails and a dark soccer is going to dive into the mailbag head first

2228
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:29,040
and find some emails to read here on the show for you,

2229
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:31,320
which I think we have a couple tonight. Yes. Yes. All right.

2230
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:34,800
So the first one's from Robert M. Uh, just a question for you, for you guys.

2231
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:38,440
I'm Bobby. I didn't send it to him this time. Just if he is,

2232
01:44:39,120 --> 01:44:42,560
just if he is in Twitch chat, I sometimes he is,

2233
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:45,000
but sometimes he takes care of other stuff during the show.

2234
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:46,040
So we'll see if he pops up.

2235
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:49,640
I picked up super hot on the switch and appreciate that it has the option for

2236
01:44:49,640 --> 01:44:52,200
motion camera controls. There have been over,

2237
01:44:52,440 --> 01:44:56,480
there have been several other switch titles with origins and virtual reality.

2238
01:44:56,480 --> 01:45:00,480
Yes. Super hot was not originally VR, but that's the more recent version,

2239
01:45:00,720 --> 01:45:02,480
including new super lucky's tale,

2240
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:05,640
which I'm interested in and Trover saves the universe.

2241
01:45:05,800 --> 01:45:08,880
What are the VR titles in your judgment would be a good fit for Nintendo's

2242
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:10,640
console? None of them.

2243
01:45:12,120 --> 01:45:15,200
Doesn't run very well on console, but no, um,

2244
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:16,840
anything that's not VR anymore.

2245
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:21,800
You mean that would work on the console or like if Nintendo had a VR console,

2246
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:25,640
like how they did super lucky's tale as a regular platformer instead of

2247
01:45:25,640 --> 01:45:26,480
instructional VR?

2248
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:34,720
I don't know. Um, a lot of actually the, um,

2249
01:45:35,680 --> 01:45:39,720
they had it with, with the, uh, Labo VR stuff,

2250
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:43,120
which none of that really has to be played in VR. I mean,

2251
01:45:43,120 --> 01:45:46,520
all that's pretty good for VR. If you want to do that.

2252
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:49,840
Um, I'm also going to say none of them,

2253
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:51,840
but I think for a different reason, perhaps.

2254
01:45:51,880 --> 01:45:55,880
I just think that if a game was cooked up in VR and VR was what was,

2255
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:59,240
it was designed for and made for, I think it should stay in VR.

2256
01:45:59,280 --> 01:46:02,280
I think something like beat saber would be terrible if they took, well,

2257
01:46:02,280 --> 01:46:03,440
I don't think it'd be terrible, but it wouldn't,

2258
01:46:03,640 --> 01:46:07,040
it wouldn't be the same certainly if they were to put it in the screen because

2259
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:12,040
that spatial awareness, uh, and so forth in the VR is a lot of it's part of what

2260
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:16,040
makes that game, that game. So like, I, I, I understand the question.

2261
01:46:16,040 --> 01:46:18,120
I respect the question, but just respectfully,

2262
01:46:18,120 --> 01:46:22,600
my answer is keep VR games VR. Like, I don't think we should,

2263
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:25,840
making regular games VR, um,

2264
01:46:26,640 --> 01:46:30,720
depending on what it is because sometimes it works out pretty decently, but like,

2265
01:46:30,720 --> 01:46:34,560
like resident evil seven I think was probably enhanced by VR, but I,

2266
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:38,160
I could kind of give or take it and no man's sky. I think it was pretty,

2267
01:46:38,200 --> 01:46:40,600
but I don't think it really added anything to game Skyrim.

2268
01:46:40,600 --> 01:46:41,960
It was like one of those pretty,

2269
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:46,120
but I don't think it added anything to the game. Um, and then, uh, like I,

2270
01:46:46,120 --> 01:46:49,080
I hate it when they do the eight bit games in VR.

2271
01:46:49,280 --> 01:46:51,880
Like I think it's one of the things people do it just because they can,

2272
01:46:52,120 --> 01:46:55,960
but like legend of Zelda in VR. Yuck.

2273
01:46:56,920 --> 01:46:59,440
Like, let's be real. It's not a good thing. And, and yeah,

2274
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:02,920
the VR labo stuff didn't end up being, it could be good though if they did it.

2275
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:06,800
Right. Like the legend is all the stuff like VR is good. Yeah.

2276
01:47:07,240 --> 01:47:10,880
So I think it could be fun. Respectfully. My answer is don't,

2277
01:47:11,320 --> 01:47:13,080
if you're gonna make a game for VR, keep in VR.

2278
01:47:13,080 --> 01:47:16,080
If you're gonna make game for a flat screen, keep it in a flat screen. Anyway,

2279
01:47:16,160 --> 01:47:17,000
that's my answer.

2280
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:21,320
I would say though, it's okay to have franchises across except I really,

2281
01:47:21,320 --> 01:47:23,800
really wish that if we're going to do another half life story,

2282
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:25,120
it wasn't fucking VR.

2283
01:47:25,120 --> 01:47:28,800
So that the rest of us who want more half life stuff are excluded by this.

2284
01:47:29,640 --> 01:47:31,360
It's highly exclusionary.

2285
01:47:31,360 --> 01:47:35,800
And on top of that could even go into being, um,

2286
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:37,880
ability insensitive

2287
01:47:40,360 --> 01:47:44,680
for people who have sensory issues or can't wear VR headsets for any reason.

2288
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:49,080
It actually could be quite, uh, discriminatory.

2289
01:47:49,160 --> 01:47:49,400
Well,

2290
01:47:49,400 --> 01:47:53,880
one could say that video games as a medium are discriminatory towards blind or

2291
01:47:53,880 --> 01:47:56,360
deaf, depending on what the video game is. I mean,

2292
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:58,600
some out there are working on,

2293
01:47:58,600 --> 01:48:01,360
but doing something that is specifically exclusionary like this,

2294
01:48:01,400 --> 01:48:03,560
then that's like a different story. So I'm just saying.

2295
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:05,840
All right, well let's move on.

2296
01:48:07,200 --> 01:48:10,800
Um, so the next email is, uh,

2297
01:48:12,120 --> 01:48:13,160
Frodo Swagons.

2298
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:16,080
I just wanted to shout out team NRG.

2299
01:48:16,120 --> 01:48:19,280
They finally won the rocket league grand championship.

2300
01:48:19,720 --> 01:48:23,480
The way they won was like a fairytale. E-sports is really growing on me.

2301
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:27,040
I encourage anyone to go check it out. It's on YouTube and Twitch.

2302
01:48:28,160 --> 01:48:29,000
Okay.

2303
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:34,080
Yeah. I don't follow a lot of the E-sports stuff, but I think that's, um,

2304
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:37,040
I think that's neat. And I, you know, I think it'd be one of those things.

2305
01:48:37,280 --> 01:48:41,240
It's like regular sports actually. I don't really follow a lot of basketball.

2306
01:48:41,240 --> 01:48:45,200
I don't follow a lot of baseball, but like when I go to see a basketball game,

2307
01:48:45,200 --> 01:48:49,360
especially like I used to go to WNBA games when they actually had a WNBA team

2308
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:53,520
here because they were really, they were really reasonably priced.

2309
01:48:53,560 --> 01:48:56,680
That's the reality of it because you know, they weren't the NBA,

2310
01:48:56,680 --> 01:48:59,200
they were the WNBA. They were reasonably priced,

2311
01:48:59,200 --> 01:49:01,680
but the games were a lot of fun to watch live. Um,

2312
01:49:01,680 --> 01:49:03,720
and the crowd really got into it and all that stuff. Ooh.

2313
01:49:03,720 --> 01:49:07,080
And I've had a really good time when I go to hockey games. Uh, my friends,

2314
01:49:07,120 --> 01:49:10,840
obviously I have a lot of friends that like obsess over the sharks, uh,

2315
01:49:10,840 --> 01:49:13,760
in San Jose. And so I've gotten to go to games because of that. Cause like, Oh,

2316
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:15,560
we have an extra ticket, Rob's in town, let's go.

2317
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:17,560
And I have a lot of fun when I go, but I can't,

2318
01:49:17,600 --> 01:49:20,240
I don't really follow hockey outside of it.

2319
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:24,520
So I think that might be like the missing piece in E-sports for me. And like, I,

2320
01:49:24,520 --> 01:49:27,160
I think I don't want to speak for Bobby, but, um,

2321
01:49:27,200 --> 01:49:31,920
I feel like when he went to DreamHack, was that what it was in Atlanta?

2322
01:49:31,960 --> 01:49:34,960
It was like really neat cause he was there and in the midst of those types of

2323
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:38,240
things, I feel like if I'm there, like if I go to an Overwatch league thing,

2324
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:41,800
then I'm going to probably have a really good time. But when I'm not, you know,

2325
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:45,520
I'm not really following it outside of that. So that's not me hating on it.

2326
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:46,680
It's just, Oh, I just,

2327
01:49:46,680 --> 01:49:49,320
I haven't really been following it cause I'm not there. So,

2328
01:49:49,480 --> 01:49:50,960
and Bobby Black Wolf does say, yeah,

2329
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:54,040
I watched a lot of Rocket League at DreamHack Atlanta. It was fun. Okay.

2330
01:49:54,040 --> 01:49:56,160
If you, I wouldn't want to try to speak for you,

2331
01:49:56,160 --> 01:49:59,960
but that was the impression I was getting from your comments on your radio

2332
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:03,920
program, which airs before us here at VOG Network. Anyway.

2333
01:50:04,920 --> 01:50:06,520
Um, so yeah, cool. I mean,

2334
01:50:06,760 --> 01:50:10,440
it's certainly easy to find esports stuff. It's playing all the time on Twitch.

2335
01:50:10,520 --> 01:50:11,960
Um, so yeah,

2336
01:50:12,440 --> 01:50:16,000
I think maybe you just have to find that game you really like. Like actually,

2337
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:21,360
the one I was watching that I kind of enjoyed was Heroes of the Storm,

2338
01:50:21,600 --> 01:50:25,480
but then that whole thing got a kick in the butt when Blizzard basically kind of

2339
01:50:25,480 --> 01:50:29,080
pulled the Heroes of the Dorm and all that other stuff. And it took a lot,

2340
01:50:29,080 --> 01:50:32,520
I mean, there's still esports matches for Heroes of the Storm going on out there,

2341
01:50:32,520 --> 01:50:34,920
but a lot of the air got let out of the tires. Uh,

2342
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:39,320
and that was unfortunate, I think. So anyway, any other emails or was that it?

2343
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:42,200
Just the two? Okay. Just those two. Just the two.

2344
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:44,120
So if you'd like to send an email in a future week,

2345
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:49,200
participate at orangeloungeradio.com. All right, let's move on.

2346
01:50:49,200 --> 01:50:53,480
We have some more news to get to before we get to Discord stuff. Uh, Loki,

2347
01:50:53,560 --> 01:50:54,400
I think you're up first.

2348
01:50:54,680 --> 01:50:56,080
Yes. So, uh,

2349
01:50:56,080 --> 01:51:01,080
Redbox used to offer games and I say used to because they're going to be

2350
01:51:01,400 --> 01:51:02,400
discontinuing that.

2351
01:51:02,920 --> 01:51:06,240
So apparently they announced that they're no longer going to be renting games,

2352
01:51:06,280 --> 01:51:09,720
which makes sense because I don't think it did very well for them.

2353
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:11,680
And honestly,

2354
01:51:11,680 --> 01:51:16,440
I think the rental space for video games isn't really something that's too

2355
01:51:16,440 --> 01:51:18,560
widely utilized nowadays anyway,

2356
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:22,480
especially now with like games pass and some of the PlayStation Now services and

2357
01:51:22,480 --> 01:51:26,600
everything, it's just easier to pay, you know,

2358
01:51:26,600 --> 01:51:30,400
the $10 a month or whatever to actually utilize a service where you have a ton

2359
01:51:30,440 --> 01:51:35,440
of games you can play versus just renting one of the newer titles out of a red

2360
01:51:36,840 --> 01:51:40,360
box for like, I want to say like three or $4 a day,

2361
01:51:40,920 --> 01:51:43,160
which is kind of just like an antiquated thing.

2362
01:51:43,880 --> 01:51:45,880
It's not like the day we have a blockbuster, you know,

2363
01:51:45,880 --> 01:51:48,760
back when it was like a week for five bucks.

2364
01:51:49,200 --> 01:51:49,560
Uh,

2365
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:53,680
Phoenix 7726 in chat says that means a lot of red boxes will be selling their

2366
01:51:53,680 --> 01:51:54,840
stock and it'll be cheap.

2367
01:51:55,120 --> 01:52:00,120
I got the Kingdom Hearts 1.5 and 2.5 collection for $10 on PlayStation 4.

2368
01:52:00,240 --> 01:52:02,440
So, I mean, I guess if you're looking for some sales,

2369
01:52:02,440 --> 01:52:04,920
now's a great time with the red box, but yeah, it is,

2370
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:07,600
it is kind of interesting to see that I haven't,

2371
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:12,000
I've never used a red box machine in my life or anything. Um, but I, I,

2372
01:52:12,120 --> 01:52:15,440
I know people that do use them for games. So it's, it's, you know,

2373
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:20,480
I would imagine that they probably didn't get a very good discount on the games

2374
01:52:20,760 --> 01:52:24,640
for sale because I know we, the company used to work for,

2375
01:52:24,640 --> 01:52:28,720
we actually sold games to red box, um, to rent.

2376
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:31,280
So they probably just,

2377
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:35,680
it's probably hard for them to make up their money on that stuff cause it needs

2378
01:52:35,680 --> 01:52:40,680
to turn so many times and if it's just not happening before maybe the game even

2379
01:52:41,080 --> 01:52:44,440
gets destroyed or damaged or something like that, that it's just not,

2380
01:52:45,480 --> 01:52:49,520
not really valid, you know, viable use of their time. Maybe they,

2381
01:52:49,520 --> 01:52:52,520
they find that, you know, we're making a lot more money on movies.

2382
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:55,720
It's better than just have a few more slots that we can put some more movies in

2383
01:52:55,720 --> 01:52:57,080
and call it a day.

2384
01:52:57,080 --> 01:53:00,400
I'm curious to see how red box is doing overall cause you know,

2385
01:53:00,400 --> 01:53:04,520
with Netflix and all these other streaming services, it's like, I don't know.

2386
01:53:04,680 --> 01:53:07,640
I think, yeah, that's the reason why I don't really use a lot of red boxes.

2387
01:53:07,640 --> 01:53:10,440
I still feel like there's a ton of things on the streaming services,

2388
01:53:10,440 --> 01:53:13,720
be it Netflix, be it, you know, CBS, whatever it is I have where I'm like,

2389
01:53:13,720 --> 01:53:14,960
I have plenty of stuff I need to watch.

2390
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:18,560
I don't need to go pay five bucks to get something a little bit newer because

2391
01:53:18,600 --> 01:53:21,520
that stuff will hit the streaming services at some point or I'll just watch it

2392
01:53:21,520 --> 01:53:22,200
on the plane.

2393
01:53:22,200 --> 01:53:25,320
Yeah. And a lot of things like nowadays, especially too,

2394
01:53:25,320 --> 01:53:30,120
like rentals were good because back then it was, you know,

2395
01:53:30,120 --> 01:53:33,600
you had your mag gaming magazines that you could find like a review on a game or

2396
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:34,080
something like that,

2397
01:53:34,080 --> 01:53:37,760
but rentals were good to like kind of gauge your interests if you're a like a

2398
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:40,600
game or not, and you can just drop five bucks, play it for a week,

2399
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:44,480
and you might even finish the game if it's short enough and check it out.

2400
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:45,840
Whereas nowadays it's like,

2401
01:53:46,320 --> 01:53:49,320
there's so many online resources for reviews on things.

2402
01:53:49,320 --> 01:53:52,960
You can get a really good impression of what a game is going to be like just by

2403
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:56,400
watching videos of it online or reading reviews online.

2404
01:53:56,800 --> 01:54:00,960
And you can then wait for a sale if it's something that you don't need right

2405
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:03,400
away that you can just wait for the drop in price.

2406
01:54:03,400 --> 01:54:08,040
So I can see why that maybe rentals aren't necessarily as, you know,

2407
01:54:08,080 --> 01:54:09,440
integral as they used to be.

2408
01:54:10,280 --> 01:54:13,400
I don't want to sound too tinfoil hat ish or get too off topic,

2409
01:54:13,400 --> 01:54:17,280
but doesn't it seem like something's up with the retail industry and when it

2410
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:20,480
comes to video games, but it doesn't seem like something weird is going on,

2411
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:22,520
like somehow gaming, you know,

2412
01:54:22,520 --> 01:54:25,640
maybe I don't know if you have any insight from your time working in the,

2413
01:54:25,640 --> 01:54:28,360
you know, kind of the, the middleman type of stuff for distribution,

2414
01:54:28,360 --> 01:54:33,160
but does it seem weird that like within a year we've seen best

2415
01:54:33,160 --> 01:54:36,160
buys incentive program and discount program go away.

2416
01:54:36,480 --> 01:54:40,440
Amazon prime's discount program was pretty much scaled all the way back to

2417
01:54:40,440 --> 01:54:42,720
nothing. You know, I mean, they, they'd still do something,

2418
01:54:42,720 --> 01:54:43,600
but didn't have to do with games.

2419
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:46,280
We've seen red boxes now getting rid of their games.

2420
01:54:46,520 --> 01:54:50,040
Doesn't this seem weird that this has all happened in the scope of like a year?

2421
01:54:50,600 --> 01:54:52,600
It, no, not necessarily,

2422
01:54:52,600 --> 01:54:55,200
because if they weren't necessarily getting backing,

2423
01:54:55,240 --> 01:54:59,160
cause I'm assuming with a lot of, especially with the discounts off of new games,

2424
01:54:59,240 --> 01:55:02,440
it was probably something that they were doing as a loss on their own.

2425
01:55:02,920 --> 01:55:07,640
And it could even be that the margins on those games aren't at me.

2426
01:55:07,880 --> 01:55:11,200
I don't know what the distribution industry looks like right now.

2427
01:55:11,440 --> 01:55:14,040
It could be that they're raising their prices across the board,

2428
01:55:14,040 --> 01:55:18,120
that the margins on those games are becoming slimmer because the price,

2429
01:55:18,240 --> 01:55:23,520
the wholesale price on those games are much smaller or larger now.

2430
01:55:23,560 --> 01:55:25,280
They don't want to break the $60.

2431
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:29,680
It's so they, so they may be charging more, you know, for their games, but you know,

2432
01:55:29,680 --> 01:55:33,880
still requiring or not really requiring, but like it could be requiring actually

2433
01:55:33,880 --> 01:55:36,840
if it's, it has to do with MDF, um,

2434
01:55:37,320 --> 01:55:42,320
is that they have to still market that as a $59.99 game.

2435
01:55:43,040 --> 01:55:48,080
Whereas if they're not getting any funding from publishers to

2436
01:55:48,120 --> 01:55:49,680
offer discounts on these games,

2437
01:55:49,680 --> 01:55:52,960
which I'm assuming like a program with Best Buy or even Amazon aren't,

2438
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:54,080
they were doing it as a loss.

2439
01:55:54,560 --> 01:55:57,840
Maybe they're just not getting the drive that they thought they were going to get

2440
01:55:57,840 --> 01:55:58,160
from it.

2441
01:55:58,160 --> 01:56:01,320
So they cut the program because they're not getting enough utilization.

2442
01:56:01,320 --> 01:56:03,360
It's not making them money in the end.

2443
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:06,720
I don't know if that's necessarily writing on the wall.

2444
01:56:06,720 --> 01:56:10,120
I think it's just, they need to take a different approach with that.

2445
01:56:10,360 --> 01:56:12,640
I could see that. Um, some good comments in chat as well,

2446
01:56:12,640 --> 01:56:15,600
as Joe and Hunter Matt saying to play into Rob's tinfoil hat,

2447
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:18,760
maybe they're in a holding pattern to see what the next gen consoles do with

2448
01:56:18,760 --> 01:56:20,560
discless gaming. Um,

2449
01:56:20,600 --> 01:56:23,640
certainly maybe the margins and things you're talking about when we talk about

2450
01:56:23,640 --> 01:56:25,200
next gen. Yeah, that could be a big thing too.

2451
01:56:25,200 --> 01:56:28,800
I still don't think games are going to go discless anytime soon. And granted,

2452
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:31,920
they're going to have that as an option, but right now, unfortunately,

2453
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:33,480
with the internet structure being,

2454
01:56:33,520 --> 01:56:36,080
infrastructure being what it is in the United States,

2455
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:40,040
it's just not going to happen because you know,

2456
01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:44,440
just the time it takes to download those games, the bandwidth caps that you have,

2457
01:56:44,680 --> 01:56:48,160
people do like physical copies on things. I mean, you look at, you know,

2458
01:56:48,160 --> 01:56:50,640
you have a lot of companies are even selling, you know,

2459
01:56:50,640 --> 01:56:54,320
physical copies of digital games because that's what people are looking for.

2460
01:56:54,680 --> 01:56:58,040
I don't necessarily think that that's going to go away altogether. I mean,

2461
01:56:58,040 --> 01:57:02,000
granted I've been buying a lot of things more digitally than I would have

2462
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:05,000
normally, but it doesn't mean that like, I don't buy physical stuff.

2463
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,440
It's just, it depends. Like for me,

2464
01:57:07,440 --> 01:57:10,040
like I don't buy games that often that are huge,

2465
01:57:10,240 --> 01:57:14,960
but like if all my games I'm buying like online or like a 150 gigabyte download

2466
01:57:14,960 --> 01:57:15,720
or something like that,

2467
01:57:15,720 --> 01:57:19,560
I'm definitely going to be considering when I'm buying those and you know,

2468
01:57:19,560 --> 01:57:22,520
maybe scaling back and even looking at like, Hey, you know,

2469
01:57:22,520 --> 01:57:25,080
I've got all these games that I've purchased digitally and I'm not really

2470
01:57:25,080 --> 01:57:26,000
playing them. I mean,

2471
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:29,600
maybe it would have been better if I bought them physically and then that way I

2472
01:57:29,600 --> 01:57:32,800
could sell them back if I really am not going to ever get to it.

2473
01:57:32,840 --> 01:57:35,640
Well, if the life cycle of a console is supposed to be 10 years,

2474
01:57:35,640 --> 01:57:39,200
I would bet in 10 years, we're not looking at one gigabyte caps anymore.

2475
01:57:39,440 --> 01:57:44,000
Those like the in the market is going to force those caps to rise up because you

2476
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:45,440
know, 4k, 8k,

2477
01:57:45,680 --> 01:57:49,440
all that stuff is going to be streaming more just as technology grows that I

2478
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:53,520
would like to hope is going to have, I'm hoping that, you know,

2479
01:57:53,560 --> 01:57:57,080
whenever we get our next president that hopefully they'll build the drive,

2480
01:57:57,080 --> 01:58:02,080
some sanity into, put somebody sane back in the FCC and all that. Yes.

2481
01:58:02,280 --> 01:58:04,720
So I'm hoping that once, once that happens,

2482
01:58:04,720 --> 01:58:06,160
that maybe things will get a little bit better.

2483
01:58:06,200 --> 01:58:08,640
Well, y'all have to vote to make that happen. But anyway, um,

2484
01:58:08,720 --> 01:58:10,960
another good comment from a Phoenix 77,

2485
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:14,880
26 saying I would bet that a lot of retailers are paying closer attention to

2486
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:19,280
stadia. Um, I, but now the thing where,

2487
01:58:19,440 --> 01:58:21,240
here's the thing with stadia, it's, it's,

2488
01:58:21,280 --> 01:58:25,160
it's too new for a lot of these same reasons that the bandwidth caps and

2489
01:58:25,160 --> 01:58:26,760
concerns. But again, like,

2490
01:58:26,840 --> 01:58:28,640
and I mentioned this when I was reviewing stadia,

2491
01:58:28,640 --> 01:58:33,080
thanks to the buddy pass Bobby gave me is that right now I'm only playing

2492
01:58:33,080 --> 01:58:35,000
destiny two in like, you know,

2493
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:38,200
1080p and the bandwidth is not really that bad at all.

2494
01:58:38,200 --> 01:58:41,600
It's not really that much of a concern because I'm lightly playing and I'm not

2495
01:58:41,600 --> 01:58:43,920
really like hardcore playing. Maybe if I was spending more hours on it,

2496
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:48,000
it might be a different story. But, um, I think Google stadia,

2497
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:51,800
if Google is not willing to commit 10 years to stadia,

2498
01:58:52,080 --> 01:58:54,160
and I think that's where we all sit here and go,

2499
01:58:54,160 --> 01:58:57,560
when is Google committed 10 years to anything besides maybe Gmail and Google

2500
01:58:57,560 --> 01:59:00,000
earth? Right. So I think that's why there's,

2501
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:01,720
might be a little bit of concern here.

2502
01:59:01,880 --> 01:59:03,200
Are they going to commit 10 years to stay there?

2503
01:59:03,200 --> 01:59:05,200
Because they're not committing 10 years to stadia and they shouldn't be

2504
01:59:05,200 --> 01:59:07,200
fucking doing it. Well, and then to that point,

2505
01:59:07,200 --> 01:59:10,360
like if you look at the stadia thing, so say you buy, um,

2506
01:59:10,480 --> 01:59:13,800
the stadia controller and the streaming thing or whatever,

2507
01:59:13,800 --> 01:59:17,680
that's like a hundred bucks right there or over a hundred dollars. You know,

2508
01:59:17,680 --> 01:59:20,960
the prices of the Xbox ones are coming down.

2509
01:59:20,960 --> 01:59:25,960
If you were like looking at like not really doing the 4k streaming all the time,

2510
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:29,320
or if you just wanted, you know, game 1080 or whatever,

2511
01:59:29,320 --> 01:59:34,280
you might be better off just buying an Xbox one S and doing games pass.

2512
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:38,520
And then at least you got a full library of games for the same prices where they

2513
01:59:38,520 --> 01:59:41,280
want you to buy in the each individual game, which doesn't make any sense.

2514
01:59:41,280 --> 01:59:45,480
That's fair. Microsoft is about to come for that hard in this next year.

2515
01:59:45,480 --> 01:59:48,460
Watch with this new Xbox is coming out and everything.

2516
01:59:48,460 --> 01:59:51,480
And how are you going to play these newer games on your old Xbox?

2517
01:59:51,640 --> 01:59:54,320
They're going to be using that streaming and cloud technology to make it

2518
01:59:54,320 --> 01:59:58,920
happen. Absolutely. So watch for all that come holiday 2020.

2519
01:59:59,600 --> 02:00:03,360
So, all right, anyway, moving on, speaking of things in the future,

2520
02:00:03,360 --> 02:00:06,760
let's talk about a big franchise that had a big announcement this week. Now,

2521
02:00:06,760 --> 02:00:10,200
not that we follow all the sports games in the world, but you know, we,

2522
02:00:10,200 --> 02:00:14,080
we can all recognize the MLB, the show pretty big franchise.

2523
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:17,920
It has historically been a Sony exclusive, but, uh,

2524
02:00:17,960 --> 02:00:21,940
this week a joint announcement was made between Sony MLB and the MLB players

2525
02:00:21,940 --> 02:00:23,320
association, uh,

2526
02:00:23,360 --> 02:00:27,800
that there will be a multi-year extension to the contract so that Sony gets to

2527
02:00:27,800 --> 02:00:30,840
keep making these games. But this is the part that's interesting.

2528
02:00:31,120 --> 02:00:35,960
They're going to make additional console platforms beyond PlayStation as

2529
02:00:35,960 --> 02:00:38,000
early as 2021.

2530
02:00:38,200 --> 02:00:41,920
So the next time I'll be the show may be out on the switch because I thought it

2531
02:00:41,920 --> 02:00:45,480
was a Sony developed game. It is. But the problem is,

2532
02:00:45,480 --> 02:00:47,480
is that they were about to lose that license.

2533
02:00:47,480 --> 02:00:50,520
If they were not willing to put it on other consoles. Hmm.

2534
02:00:50,800 --> 02:00:54,580
So in order to keep the license, they're going to put it on other consoles.

2535
02:00:54,580 --> 02:00:57,240
I mean, well, that's good. Cause we don't want EA to get the license.

2536
02:00:57,240 --> 02:00:59,840
So I'm, I'm fine with that.

2537
02:01:00,600 --> 02:01:04,000
So yeah, it's going to be a little weird seeing a Sony game on a Nintendo

2538
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:08,520
platform again, but this is where we're moving to with gaming in 2020 is it's not,

2539
02:01:08,520 --> 02:01:10,400
I mean, hell we already, I,

2540
02:01:10,880 --> 02:01:15,040
I didn't mention this week that I was playing Minecraft on PlayStation four,

2541
02:01:15,040 --> 02:01:20,120
but I was, and I got to say it was a trip signing into my Xbox

2542
02:01:20,120 --> 02:01:20,720
library, excuse me,

2543
02:01:20,720 --> 02:01:25,480
my Microsoft account on my PlayStation and then getting my OLR gamer

2544
02:01:25,480 --> 02:01:27,160
pick on my PlayStation.

2545
02:01:27,400 --> 02:01:30,080
That was the thing that happened this week and that was kind of a trip,

2546
02:01:30,080 --> 02:01:34,840
but in a good way in the, in a I'm playing a Sonic game on my Nintendo kind of way,

2547
02:01:34,840 --> 02:01:37,920
you know, it's, uh, it's, it's quite, quite something.

2548
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:41,000
But I think this is just where gaming is going in general is that we're going to

2549
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:42,800
see not just more cross platform,

2550
02:01:42,800 --> 02:01:46,320
but we're just going to see that folks are going to see that there's more places

2551
02:01:46,320 --> 02:01:50,640
for the money. I think so. Did you want to add to that dark soccer? I'm sorry.

2552
02:01:50,800 --> 02:01:55,080
No, I just figured that now that Alan has he's here. Oh yeah. Alan,

2553
02:01:55,080 --> 02:01:58,840
did you want to see some of the gifts that, uh, dark soccer got us? Hold on.

2554
02:01:58,840 --> 02:02:02,120
I just lost chat. So I'm like trying to get it back. So sorry. Yeah. Sorry.

2555
02:02:02,120 --> 02:02:04,800
Chat lost you. Yeah, I lost you guys for a minute here.

2556
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:07,240
So it's hard for me to multitask. That's okay. Um,

2557
02:02:07,920 --> 02:02:11,560
but maybe we should move on to our next story here while I get chat back. Sure.

2558
02:02:11,560 --> 02:02:14,160
Is it me? Yes. Okay. Well, um,

2559
02:02:14,320 --> 02:02:18,880
there are going to be, uh, some, uh, nice, uh,

2560
02:02:20,120 --> 02:02:23,000
oh my gosh, I actually completely just lost my voice for a moment,

2561
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:27,120
but there has been an announcement by, uh, uh,

2562
02:02:27,600 --> 02:02:32,080
Vanquish Games that there is going to be a, um, if I say Vanquish,

2563
02:02:32,320 --> 02:02:34,680
the game is Vanquish and Bayonetta,

2564
02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:38,440
but they're going to be getting remastered. I cannot talk.

2565
02:02:38,680 --> 02:02:42,440
They're both going to be getting remastered versions coming out soon. Um,

2566
02:02:43,160 --> 02:02:46,920
and, uh, but it's going to be, um,

2567
02:02:47,400 --> 02:02:49,800
looking like they're supposed to be pretty, uh, pretty,

2568
02:02:49,960 --> 02:02:52,520
pretty if I can make words happen,

2569
02:02:52,840 --> 02:02:55,960
but it looks like the real estate for those are going to be April 18th, 2020.

2570
02:02:56,520 --> 02:03:01,400
So there you go. I have completely muffled what I just said.

2571
02:03:01,560 --> 02:03:03,160
Are you sharing a Coke with Brittany?

2572
02:03:05,080 --> 02:03:07,880
It's Brittany's Coke, bitch. Sorry. Uh, for those on the podcast,

2573
02:03:07,880 --> 02:03:11,160
you can't see Alan came into the studio so that, uh, we could,

2574
02:03:11,160 --> 02:03:14,760
I could show him all the things. So this mug was free cause it has chocolate cat

2575
02:03:14,760 --> 02:03:18,480
on it, which yeah, I know is so thank you. Um,

2576
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:22,080
but then dark soccer, this is, this is definitely you thing. Not a me thing.

2577
02:03:22,680 --> 02:03:26,400
That is, Oh yay. And I was running, I was getting low and I've got mics.

2578
02:03:26,960 --> 02:03:31,200
Oh, sorry. You have Loki's mic. Okay, cool. So yes, so very cool. And then, uh,

2579
02:03:31,240 --> 02:03:32,600
I have a batsamaru one of these,

2580
02:03:32,600 --> 02:03:35,640
but I'm sure you'll steal it cause that's what happens when you're married. Um,

2581
02:03:35,720 --> 02:03:39,160
and then, uh, yeah, they cinnamon roll. Yay. And we always,

2582
02:03:39,160 --> 02:03:43,280
we love a print sock in this house. Yes, we do. The kookier,

2583
02:03:43,280 --> 02:03:47,360
kitschier the better. Well, you can't go any better than burger,

2584
02:03:47,680 --> 02:03:51,920
burgers and pizza. Yes. It's like what we eat,

2585
02:03:51,920 --> 02:03:55,880
represented on our feet. That's very nice of you. The other thing, the board game.

2586
02:03:56,160 --> 02:03:58,800
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I showed him that first. Yeah. The Funko verse.

2587
02:03:58,840 --> 02:04:03,160
So that's pretty cool. So this is for your holidays. Happy.

2588
02:04:04,520 --> 02:04:08,320
What's new in gaming for you since you're here? Um,

2589
02:04:08,360 --> 02:04:12,280
I started checking out, um, uh,

2590
02:04:12,440 --> 02:04:17,000
the final chapters of black Mesa. Uh, you know how,

2591
02:04:18,280 --> 02:04:21,760
they finally put out a version of the game in like 2012 and then the last

2592
02:04:21,760 --> 02:04:25,360
chapter Zen, which was not good in the original. Um,

2593
02:04:25,400 --> 02:04:28,000
they redid it from the ground up was like, Oh,

2594
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,520
Zen's going to come out next year, next year, next year. Well, it's,

2595
02:04:30,520 --> 02:04:34,400
it's finally next year. I'm eight years later and they finished it.

2596
02:04:34,480 --> 02:04:38,160
You can beat the game now for real, the whole thing. And I'm plugged. I'm,

2597
02:04:38,200 --> 02:04:41,240
it's, it's so it's, it's an extra three or four hours of content.

2598
02:04:41,240 --> 02:04:44,960
I feel like it's really long and they did an incredible job.

2599
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:49,680
And the reason why it took them so damn long is because they really had no,

2600
02:04:49,680 --> 02:04:51,840
they knew that Zen was bad, so they wanted to like,

2601
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:53,040
rebuild it from the ground up.

2602
02:04:53,040 --> 02:04:56,440
So they had to do concept art and like art direction.

2603
02:04:56,440 --> 02:04:59,240
What does this alien civilization look like? And it's all incredible.

2604
02:04:59,360 --> 02:05:03,960
And I can't say enough good things about, um, crowbar collective. All right.

2605
02:05:04,080 --> 02:05:05,400
That's great. And, uh, just,

2606
02:05:05,440 --> 02:05:09,240
just waiting for half-life Alex to not be played. Yeah, exactly.

2607
02:05:10,160 --> 02:05:14,480
You waited too long, Gabe. We don't, we don't care anymore. All right.

2608
02:05:14,960 --> 02:05:17,000
All right. Thanks for stopping it. I'm giving these to you to take with you.

2609
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:20,840
You can put that one in the kitchen and then that cup is for you as well. So go,

2610
02:05:20,840 --> 02:05:22,800
go make, I want bunk beds. You getting me a bunk bed?

2611
02:05:24,200 --> 02:05:27,960
That's a loft bed. It's not a bunk bed. My son wants a loft bed.

2612
02:05:27,960 --> 02:05:29,960
My wife does not want my son to have a loft bed,

2613
02:05:30,640 --> 02:05:33,920
but they have desks built into them and it would solve two of my problems at

2614
02:05:33,920 --> 02:05:35,640
once. There you go. She just,

2615
02:05:35,920 --> 02:05:39,200
she thinks that somehow he's going to fall out of it or like it's not.

2616
02:05:40,400 --> 02:05:42,760
That I have fallen out of a bunk bed and slept through it.

2617
02:05:43,760 --> 02:05:47,640
He won't fall out of a bunk bed or a loft bed because it has,

2618
02:05:47,720 --> 02:05:49,800
it has walls on the sides. Yeah.

2619
02:05:49,960 --> 02:05:54,840
He would have to do some serious like rolling like Katamari style to get up over

2620
02:05:54,840 --> 02:05:58,360
that edge. And I mean, and they make enhanced over thing anyway,

2621
02:05:58,360 --> 02:06:02,000
but you can just tell her that I've slept because he gets up like three or four

2622
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:05,240
times a night to use the bathroom that he might have trouble navigating the

2623
02:06:05,240 --> 02:06:06,080
ladder.

2624
02:06:08,720 --> 02:06:11,720
Okay. Yes. Almost 10 year old son.

2625
02:06:12,080 --> 02:06:13,320
How about you wear a diaper?

2626
02:06:13,320 --> 02:06:15,080
Alan is cackling from the kitchen.

2627
02:06:15,080 --> 02:06:18,600
If you get him a port-a-potty to put on the corner of the bed.

2628
02:06:19,680 --> 02:06:22,720
You know, back when he was much, uh,

2629
02:06:22,760 --> 02:06:27,320
smaller and he was still using the like toddler potty.

2630
02:06:27,680 --> 02:06:31,520
We did put the potty in his room to make it easier for him so he wouldn't have

2631
02:06:31,520 --> 02:06:34,880
to go down the hallway. Hmm. Yes.

2632
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:37,000
All the stories that you didn't really care to hear about.

2633
02:06:37,080 --> 02:06:38,760
All right, though, let's move on.

2634
02:06:38,760 --> 02:06:40,840
Four reasons I didn't have children.

2635
02:06:42,120 --> 02:06:46,000
Speaking of going to the potty, let's talk about Twitch streams. No,

2636
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:48,000
nobody's streams. Although they're talking in chat.

2637
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:52,280
Apparently some big broadcaster just got banned and mega 64 podcast because

2638
02:06:52,280 --> 02:06:54,040
someone apparently threw up on their stream.

2639
02:06:54,720 --> 02:06:56,920
I didn't know that was something you hit band for.

2640
02:06:57,160 --> 02:06:59,320
I mean, not that I wanted to do that. Huh?

2641
02:06:59,440 --> 02:07:00,280
I don't think you have it on purpose.

2642
02:07:00,280 --> 02:07:03,360
Did they throw up onto an animal? Because apparently that's been gay.

2643
02:07:03,400 --> 02:07:08,600
Oh, Bobby says it was a lot of drinking. Oh, interesting. All right. Well noted.

2644
02:07:08,600 --> 02:07:10,880
No more drunk shows here at OLR cause we're on Twitch.

2645
02:07:12,720 --> 02:07:16,720
Oh, do it beforehand, right? Wait, I've, I've, I've had a little bit of wine.

2646
02:07:16,840 --> 02:07:19,520
Have I done it on air? I don't think I've had wine since we moved to Twitch.

2647
02:07:20,160 --> 02:07:23,720
I think the last time I was having wine on the show, we were still, um,

2648
02:07:24,080 --> 02:07:26,920
on the show cast. I have a lovely sangria in my fridge.

2649
02:07:26,960 --> 02:07:29,360
You should come over and we'll do a drunk podcast.

2650
02:07:29,720 --> 02:07:34,480
Bobby Blackwell says alcohol is okay if it's tame, but excessive alcohol isn't.

2651
02:07:34,480 --> 02:07:38,200
So if I enjoy a lovely wine in a can, I can do that.

2652
02:07:38,200 --> 02:07:39,280
It's just a big success.

2653
02:07:39,800 --> 02:07:43,720
It's just when you bring in a beer bong into the situation, that's when it's done.

2654
02:07:44,240 --> 02:07:49,000
Rob, you know what we need to do? What? Froze. Mm. Good times. Yeah.

2655
02:07:49,040 --> 02:07:51,840
Yes. All right. It's showing on a mat. It says, Rob,

2656
02:07:51,840 --> 02:07:56,720
don't go full Sally O'Malley last drunk show cause I'm 50,

2657
02:07:57,400 --> 02:08:00,920
50 years old. I'm not 50. So, um, you know,

2658
02:08:00,920 --> 02:08:05,640
most of the news we hear about Twitch streamers and signing contracts end up

2659
02:08:05,680 --> 02:08:06,680
having to be with them,

2660
02:08:06,680 --> 02:08:11,440
leaving Twitch to other platforms like mixer to sign exclusive contracts. Well,

2661
02:08:11,440 --> 02:08:16,280
this time Twitch is kind of getting on that bandwagon to sign some of the top

2662
02:08:16,280 --> 02:08:18,960
streamers to exclusive multi-year deals,

2663
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:24,200
including such streamers like Dr Lupo or lyric or

2664
02:08:24,200 --> 02:08:25,560
Tim the tap man.

2665
02:08:25,680 --> 02:08:30,680
They have all been signed to multi-year deals exclusive to the Twitch platform.

2666
02:08:31,680 --> 02:08:34,080
And I'm sure that's to help with, uh,

2667
02:08:34,120 --> 02:08:39,120
some of the Exodus that you have with like Ninja shroud and courage and stuff

2668
02:08:39,160 --> 02:08:40,520
like that. In fact, I want to say,

2669
02:08:40,520 --> 02:08:45,520
I saw a story earlier this week as well talking about shroud and actually

2670
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:51,000
leaving the platform for mixer and that only 15% of his followers came with him

2671
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:55,640
to mixer. Uh, but that's still 15% more than they had before.

2672
02:08:55,640 --> 02:08:59,040
And who's to say that, you know, I mean, I don't know,

2673
02:08:59,040 --> 02:09:03,720
I don't know that more could come later. I mean, who knows?

2674
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:07,280
Stop trying to make mixer happen. I'm just kidding.

2675
02:09:08,560 --> 02:09:10,640
A little competition is actually, it's super healthy.

2676
02:09:10,680 --> 02:09:14,240
I'd rather have competing platforms, but for sure. Oh,

2677
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:16,120
an exclusive multi-year deal.

2678
02:09:16,120 --> 02:09:18,760
But it's nice to see Twitch doing what they need to do. But I don't,

2679
02:09:18,760 --> 02:09:20,960
I also feel like, and this is,

2680
02:09:20,960 --> 02:09:24,320
this is the thing about like doing streaming as a full time job.

2681
02:09:24,320 --> 02:09:27,600
And I totally get this as ironic considering what we're doing right now.

2682
02:09:27,840 --> 02:09:29,080
But I think Bobby,

2683
02:09:29,080 --> 02:09:33,440
myself and anybody else that's participated on VOG network would probably say

2684
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:36,240
that we are hobbyists. This is our hobby.

2685
02:09:36,240 --> 02:09:38,480
We're doing this for the love of the craft for fun.

2686
02:09:38,680 --> 02:09:43,440
We're not doing this to pay our rent. Um, nobody on this network is. Um,

2687
02:09:43,480 --> 02:09:46,680
and I think when you do take it on as a full time job,

2688
02:09:46,680 --> 02:09:48,960
and I'm not one of those haters, believe me, I'm not.

2689
02:09:49,200 --> 02:09:51,840
What I'm actually saying is quite the opposite is that, you know,

2690
02:09:51,840 --> 02:09:55,760
when it comes to that sort of thing, you just have to be careful because, uh,

2691
02:09:55,760 --> 02:09:58,240
what's the famous line from the Rocky or a picture show.

2692
02:09:58,400 --> 02:10:02,840
I made you and I can break you just as easily, not me specifically,

2693
02:10:02,840 --> 02:10:05,760
but I'm talking about the internet, right. And the fandom and that fickle fandom,

2694
02:10:05,960 --> 02:10:08,440
you know, they made you, but they can also break you.

2695
02:10:08,440 --> 02:10:09,920
So that's why I say like,

2696
02:10:10,120 --> 02:10:12,880
if you are going to take on this type of thing full time as your job,

2697
02:10:13,040 --> 02:10:14,840
you gotta be thinking about things, you know,

2698
02:10:14,840 --> 02:10:17,760
like are you saving money for, if this should ever go away,

2699
02:10:17,920 --> 02:10:21,480
are you trying to go to school, I guess, part-time or no, I mean, I'm,

2700
02:10:22,400 --> 02:10:24,040
I could go on a whole other tangent about this,

2701
02:10:24,040 --> 02:10:26,840
but I am very much of the mindset is that you do not have to go to college to

2702
02:10:26,840 --> 02:10:30,600
be successful, but there are plenty of other ways you can get certifications.

2703
02:10:30,600 --> 02:10:33,120
You can still go to classes, you can still, you know,

2704
02:10:33,120 --> 02:10:36,880
be up and up on your industry and join associations, things like that.

2705
02:10:37,040 --> 02:10:40,360
But are you looking at those types of things for heaven forbid, if you,

2706
02:10:40,400 --> 02:10:44,560
you know, that ever fails? Um, I think people should jump all into that.

2707
02:10:44,560 --> 02:10:46,720
And if they love streaming and they love community,

2708
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:49,080
by all means that passion is going to show through and that's,

2709
02:10:49,080 --> 02:10:51,320
what's going to make you successful. But at the same time,

2710
02:10:51,560 --> 02:10:55,800
you gotta be prepared for, you know, if it should all go away someday, you know,

2711
02:10:55,800 --> 02:11:00,680
look how quickly people get canceled, right? That's the reality of 2019.

2712
02:11:00,680 --> 02:11:04,800
So what's going to happen if you get canceled, you know,

2713
02:11:04,960 --> 02:11:09,160
if I get canceled, then we weren't making money anyway. You know, I,

2714
02:11:09,160 --> 02:11:12,080
I like to think that some of you guys would still show up. I, I,

2715
02:11:12,320 --> 02:11:15,520
I hope I wouldn't say anything really stupid because I try not to say stupid

2716
02:11:15,520 --> 02:11:17,080
things. But as I said,

2717
02:11:17,280 --> 02:11:21,040
I probably did say stupid things 17 years ago on this show because it was

2718
02:11:21,040 --> 02:11:25,960
17 years ago. Things were different. Right. So, um, my point is, is that,

2719
02:11:25,960 --> 02:11:26,400
you know,

2720
02:11:26,400 --> 02:11:29,240
if somebody is making a lot of money and they're living off this stuff,

2721
02:11:29,240 --> 02:11:31,920
they gotta be careful because that could go away someday.

2722
02:11:32,080 --> 02:11:35,240
So the nice thing about the multi-year deal is that at least they have that

2723
02:11:35,240 --> 02:11:36,720
security for some time.

2724
02:11:36,720 --> 02:11:39,520
I mean, this is not something that we normally, we talked about on the show,

2725
02:11:39,520 --> 02:11:41,280
but like, even now,

2726
02:11:41,280 --> 02:11:45,280
like Twitter is changing more of their algorithm stuff and changing some of the

2727
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:48,000
rules that they have in there, including, um,

2728
02:11:48,680 --> 02:11:52,200
stuff about like harassment of other people and stuff like that,

2729
02:11:52,200 --> 02:11:55,160
where you have like old episodes of like, for example,

2730
02:11:55,160 --> 02:11:58,440
Content Cop that are getting taken off the platform and stuff like that,

2731
02:11:58,440 --> 02:12:02,320
or like all these video old videos that people would put up there are getting

2732
02:12:02,320 --> 02:12:05,440
torn down. And it's like, you have that with the COPPA stuff.

2733
02:12:05,440 --> 02:12:09,720
So then if you have kids friendly content, well, you're fucked. Um, you've,

2734
02:12:10,440 --> 02:12:12,880
it's just like a whole bunch of like stuff that it's,

2735
02:12:13,480 --> 02:12:16,680
it's not good to put all your eggs in one basket,

2736
02:12:16,680 --> 02:12:19,240
especially with like Twitch and stuff like that too.

2737
02:12:20,280 --> 02:12:24,200
You want to have multiple revenue sources coming in, especially you wouldn't,

2738
02:12:24,240 --> 02:12:27,720
I wouldn't want to rely on those platforms specifically for my revenue.

2739
02:12:27,720 --> 02:12:29,960
I would say like a Patreon or something like that.

2740
02:12:30,160 --> 02:12:31,800
If you're going to continue doing that type of thing.

2741
02:12:32,040 --> 02:12:33,200
The one I saw this week though,

2742
02:12:33,200 --> 02:12:36,520
that was really hilarious is the way they got around the YouTube system.

2743
02:12:36,680 --> 02:12:40,520
So you know how like you'll have random like music labels,

2744
02:12:40,520 --> 02:12:42,960
copyright claiming your videos and stuff like that,

2745
02:12:42,960 --> 02:12:46,040
even though like you could be just like humming a tune or something like that.

2746
02:12:46,040 --> 02:12:49,000
Not necessarily even playing or it's incidentally in the background or

2747
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:53,640
whatever. So people have started, um, one of the, this, uh,

2748
02:12:53,760 --> 02:12:58,480
YouTuber decided that I'm going to write a really shitty

2749
02:12:58,520 --> 02:12:59,600
outro song.

2750
02:12:59,880 --> 02:13:04,520
I'm going to put it in one of those music label services,

2751
02:13:04,800 --> 02:13:07,320
and they're going to put that in the content ID system.

2752
02:13:07,520 --> 02:13:09,920
So that means that every video that I put in there,

2753
02:13:10,200 --> 02:13:12,280
I'm copyright claiming my own video.

2754
02:13:12,360 --> 02:13:14,840
So I automatically get the revenue from that.

2755
02:13:14,960 --> 02:13:18,160
And that also means that any video that they put up,

2756
02:13:18,200 --> 02:13:21,120
even if they're not eligible to receive ad revenue from that,

2757
02:13:21,240 --> 02:13:23,080
they're receiving ad revenue from that.

2758
02:13:23,520 --> 02:13:27,400
That is how messed up their system is in order to fix that system so that they

2759
02:13:27,400 --> 02:13:28,200
can't do that.

2760
02:13:28,200 --> 02:13:31,960
That means they actually have to fix the ad system that they have in the way

2761
02:13:31,960 --> 02:13:36,280
that every user wants it to be in the first place. It's brilliant.

2762
02:13:36,320 --> 02:13:37,520
It's fucking brilliant.

2763
02:13:39,280 --> 02:13:41,320
YouTube needs to be needle on a few things.

2764
02:13:41,320 --> 02:13:45,800
So I'm happy to hear about that as well. So, uh, I've been following, um,

2765
02:13:45,840 --> 02:13:47,520
some of the content producers,

2766
02:13:47,520 --> 02:13:51,560
like the ones who do doll modifications and they got put under like a bunch of

2767
02:13:51,560 --> 02:13:54,920
the child, uh, accounts.

2768
02:13:55,040 --> 02:13:58,200
Somebody mistake the doll for an actual child because they do kind of look real.

2769
02:13:58,240 --> 02:14:00,640
No, no, because they thought that it was content for children.

2770
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:05,560
So children couldn't be subjected to ad revenue or to ads.

2771
02:14:05,680 --> 02:14:06,040
Yeah.

2772
02:14:06,040 --> 02:14:10,760
So there's a big petition going on to allow people to code their own

2773
02:14:10,760 --> 02:14:11,720
channel stuff.

2774
02:14:12,480 --> 02:14:15,680
And it's just because a few of them that have been following for a while now

2775
02:14:15,680 --> 02:14:17,760
have lost their livelihood. So.

2776
02:14:19,200 --> 02:14:22,360
All right. Anyway, who that took a turn, but Hey, it's, uh,

2777
02:14:22,400 --> 02:14:25,960
this streaming culture is, is where we're at and where this show is at now.

2778
02:14:25,960 --> 02:14:29,280
And celebrating one year on a Twitch anyway.

2779
02:14:30,360 --> 02:14:31,320
Anyhow, let's move on.

2780
02:14:31,320 --> 02:14:34,800
We have one more story and then we'll get to our list around table on discord.

2781
02:14:34,840 --> 02:14:37,680
This story has to do with time magazine. You know,

2782
02:14:37,720 --> 02:14:41,640
a lot of people are talking about time magazine and the person of the year and

2783
02:14:41,640 --> 02:14:44,920
the whole Twitter thing that came of that. I ain't going to touch that right now.

2784
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:48,360
But I will say is that I think that discussion took away from, Oh,

2785
02:14:48,520 --> 02:14:52,240
time names, all this other stuff when in that same magazine. Right.

2786
02:14:52,440 --> 02:14:56,880
And so one of the things they were looking at was the top 10 gadgets of the past

2787
02:14:56,880 --> 02:15:01,000
10 years. And, uh, just to name, there's a lot of Apple stuff on there.

2788
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,560
It's not too surprising, but running down the whole list,

2789
02:15:03,560 --> 02:15:07,160
Apple iPad in 2010, the Tesla model S in 2012,

2790
02:15:07,200 --> 02:15:10,480
raspberry PI in 2012, the Chrome cast in 2013,

2791
02:15:10,680 --> 02:15:14,280
the DJI Phantom in 2013, the Amazon echo in 2014,

2792
02:15:14,280 --> 02:15:16,000
the Apple watch in 2015,

2793
02:15:16,200 --> 02:15:21,200
the Apple air pods in 2016 and the X-Box adaptive controller in 2018.

2794
02:15:21,200 --> 02:15:23,200
That's pretty awesome. Actually, I'm all for that.

2795
02:15:23,480 --> 02:15:27,600
But the one that I'm saved for last is a whole console.

2796
02:15:27,600 --> 02:15:32,320
It's the Nintendo switch in 2017 was named one of the top

2797
02:15:32,360 --> 02:15:35,880
consoles. I mean, technically the iPad's a console too in a way, but anyway,

2798
02:15:35,880 --> 02:15:37,720
we'll sit, we'll leave it at the Nintendo switch for now.

2799
02:15:37,920 --> 02:15:39,920
And in there right up on the switch, they said,

2800
02:15:39,920 --> 02:15:41,080
when it comes to gaming on the go,

2801
02:15:41,080 --> 02:15:44,920
no one can top Nintendo's track record beginning with the game boy in 1989.

2802
02:15:44,920 --> 02:15:47,320
But it's the introduction of the hybrid Nintendo switch,

2803
02:15:47,480 --> 02:15:50,080
which you can play either portably or connected to your TV might be the

2804
02:15:50,080 --> 02:15:54,000
company's most important contribution to gaming yet compared to the competition.

2805
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,840
It handily takes the crown as the most important video game console of the

2806
02:15:56,840 --> 02:16:00,960
decade with fans begging developers to bring their next title to the switch.

2807
02:16:01,080 --> 02:16:04,520
It's smartphone inspired portability paired with Nintendo's ever-growing

2808
02:16:04,520 --> 02:16:08,560
library of blockbuster independent and vintage titles makes the switch feel

2809
02:16:08,560 --> 02:16:11,880
like the culmination of Nintendo's idea of what gaming should be.

2810
02:16:12,080 --> 02:16:14,560
So that is, uh, from the time magazine right up.

2811
02:16:14,560 --> 02:16:17,720
If you want to see more details, you will have to go find that magazine. Um,

2812
02:16:17,920 --> 02:16:18,800
but, um,

2813
02:16:19,280 --> 02:16:22,680
pretty neat to see a console like the switch on there as one of the top 10

2814
02:16:22,680 --> 02:16:25,800
inventions or one top 10 gadgets, I should say of the decade.

2815
02:16:25,800 --> 02:16:26,640
What do you guys think?

2816
02:16:27,560 --> 02:16:28,400
I agree.

2817
02:16:29,240 --> 02:16:33,520
I think that it definitely belongs up there with all those illustrious other

2818
02:16:33,520 --> 02:16:34,360
items.

2819
02:16:34,920 --> 02:16:39,280
Absolutely. So pretty cool. Uh, all right. Well with that,

2820
02:16:39,320 --> 02:16:43,080
we will move on to our listener round table via discord and chat.

2821
02:16:43,080 --> 02:16:44,720
If you guys have any questions in our chat room,

2822
02:16:44,960 --> 02:16:48,680
you can go ahead and pose those there in chat while I get discord up and running

2823
02:16:48,680 --> 02:16:51,760
here, cause I'm not currently up and running, but I will get there again.

2824
02:16:51,760 --> 02:16:56,360
If you want to join our discord server, you can over at vog network.com slash

2825
02:16:56,400 --> 02:16:59,400
discord. That'll get you an invite right into our discord server.

2826
02:16:59,600 --> 02:17:01,960
Just please don't be a jerk. If you're a jerk, don't join.

2827
02:17:02,880 --> 02:17:04,440
You can't spell discord without disco.

2828
02:17:04,720 --> 02:17:06,480
That's right. You can't disco Elysium.

2829
02:17:11,880 --> 02:17:14,840
Nobody's in the green room right now. We'll give it a couple of minutes. Well,

2830
02:17:14,920 --> 02:17:16,920
you know, people are being shot. Well, metal mayhem said,

2831
02:17:16,920 --> 02:17:20,600
I'm not calling in tonight, but I do want to say, uh, what did he say about it?

2832
02:17:20,600 --> 02:17:22,320
It was about a sale, but it was one of the chat. Oh yeah.

2833
02:17:22,560 --> 02:17:25,400
Gog is having another big sale right on the heels of the black Friday sale.

2834
02:17:25,440 --> 02:17:28,000
Everybody's having, everybody's having sales right now because it's um,

2835
02:17:28,040 --> 02:17:31,000
look what month it is. Yeah. It's close to the holidays. And you know,

2836
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:34,160
people are thinking about, Oh, those last minute Christmas gifts.

2837
02:17:34,200 --> 02:17:37,480
You sounded like you're from Minnesota for a second. Really? Oh, don't you know?

2838
02:17:37,520 --> 02:17:40,920
It's cause I watched too much drop dead gorgeous. One of my favorite movies.

2839
02:17:41,200 --> 02:17:43,800
I know I've never seen it. What? Yeah.

2840
02:17:43,920 --> 02:17:46,840
I wonder if that's even on any streaming platforms. It's a great movie.

2841
02:17:46,880 --> 02:17:47,400
Keep in mind.

2842
02:17:47,400 --> 02:17:50,360
I've also never seen mean girls all the way through and I can quote that movie

2843
02:17:50,920 --> 02:17:52,880
because it's all my friend's fault.

2844
02:17:52,960 --> 02:17:56,360
I would say that there's movies from the eighties or I can like quote scenes and

2845
02:17:56,360 --> 02:17:58,600
things that happen. Like I think a good example would be planes,

2846
02:17:58,600 --> 02:18:03,080
trains and automobiles. Like everybody knows that scene with Edie McClurg, uh,

2847
02:18:03,080 --> 02:18:05,880
when she's working at the automobile rental or whatever.

2848
02:18:06,120 --> 02:18:07,480
And Steve Martin comes in and goes,

2849
02:18:07,480 --> 02:18:11,440
I want a fucking car that fucking works and I want to fucking and all this

2850
02:18:11,440 --> 02:18:15,360
stuff. And she goes, Oh, do you have a copy of rental agreement? And he's no,

2851
02:18:15,520 --> 02:18:18,400
you're fucked. Like, but I've never seen that movie,

2852
02:18:19,400 --> 02:18:20,880
but I know that scene.

2853
02:18:21,800 --> 02:18:25,040
Do you know, you know what we need to do for, for Gay Jumis?

2854
02:18:26,040 --> 02:18:29,600
Oh yeah. On the 25th, right? We need to find a place that's open.

2855
02:18:30,200 --> 02:18:33,360
That'll be the first challenge. And then we also need to watch gremlins.

2856
02:18:34,640 --> 02:18:37,600
Your favorite Christmas movie. It is my favorite Christmas movie. Everybody,

2857
02:18:37,720 --> 02:18:41,480
everybody always talks about Die Hard as a Christmas movie and like not enough

2858
02:18:41,480 --> 02:18:45,240
people are talking about gremlins. Die Hard is a great movie. Don't get me wrong.

2859
02:18:45,800 --> 02:18:47,800
But it's like, it's the hipster thing.

2860
02:18:48,720 --> 02:18:52,960
I'm sick of the Christmas argument about, about Die Hard. How about shut up?

2861
02:18:53,760 --> 02:18:56,760
You know what I'm saying? We need to talk more about gremlins.

2862
02:18:57,480 --> 02:19:01,360
Even more of a Christmas movie because it actually does have a Christmas theme to

2863
02:19:01,360 --> 02:19:04,640
it. Whereas Die Hard just happened during Christmas.

2864
02:19:05,160 --> 02:19:10,160
And I will arguably say that gremlins two may be better in one of these rare

2865
02:19:10,600 --> 02:19:11,440
circumstances.

2866
02:19:11,640 --> 02:19:15,240
I will watch gremlins, but then you have to watch my favorite Christmas movie.

2867
02:19:15,440 --> 02:19:16,000
What?

2868
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:17,040
Batman Returns.

2869
02:19:17,040 --> 02:19:20,920
Oh hell yeah. Fucking Michelle Pfeiffer. Hell yeah.

2870
02:19:21,320 --> 02:19:22,160
And actually that...

2871
02:19:22,160 --> 02:19:23,600
Batman Returns is my favorite Christmas movie.

2872
02:19:23,600 --> 02:19:28,600
That podcast that I'm fond of, Stuff Mom Never Told You with the amazing Annie

2873
02:19:29,560 --> 02:19:30,400
and Samantha.

2874
02:19:30,880 --> 02:19:35,000
They did their feminist movie Friday and talked about Batman Returns on it and

2875
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,200
it was a fantastic episode.

2876
02:19:37,320 --> 02:19:37,760
Yes.

2877
02:19:37,760 --> 02:19:40,200
I fucking love Batman Returns.

2878
02:19:40,520 --> 02:19:43,760
It's, it's a completely underrated Batman film. Like I get it.

2879
02:19:43,960 --> 02:19:45,920
The Nolan trilogy was great.

2880
02:19:46,120 --> 02:19:49,960
I understand why you all love the Dark Knight and unfortunately not enough of

2881
02:19:49,960 --> 02:19:54,960
you like Batman Begins and like the Scarecrow was amazing, but, uh,

2882
02:19:55,160 --> 02:19:58,080
not enough people talking about the Tim Burton Batman years and especially

2883
02:19:58,080 --> 02:20:01,080
Batman Returns, like completely underrated. Yes, it was camp. Yes,

2884
02:20:01,080 --> 02:20:03,720
it had problems, but it was fucking incredible.

2885
02:20:03,720 --> 02:20:07,120
I'm going to say that I do not care for Nicholson's Joker, just saying,

2886
02:20:07,520 --> 02:20:11,040
but fucking Danny DeVito as the penguin. Hello.

2887
02:20:11,080 --> 02:20:13,560
Well, and the Schumacher films were terrible. Both of them.

2888
02:20:13,600 --> 02:20:17,240
I like Schumacher films forever and Schumacher films.

2889
02:20:17,920 --> 02:20:20,680
I don't know of them. Yes, that, yes.

2890
02:20:20,720 --> 02:20:24,120
You mean that period of my life that I saw the movie for free and wanted a

2891
02:20:24,120 --> 02:20:24,880
refund?

2892
02:20:24,880 --> 02:20:27,080
Schumacher's made Phantom of the Opera and nothing else.

2893
02:20:27,080 --> 02:20:28,920
I saw the one with Batgirl for free.

2894
02:20:30,120 --> 02:20:35,120
I went up to Spanish Fort to go see it for free and I still wanted a refund.

2895
02:20:37,480 --> 02:20:39,440
The only good thing about that movie was my popcorn,

2896
02:20:40,080 --> 02:20:44,720
but when summing up a Batman Returns. All right, we have a call. Uh, wait.

2897
02:20:45,200 --> 02:20:47,480
Oh wait. Oh, I thought you had another point. We have a call.

2898
02:20:47,480 --> 02:20:50,600
I want to get to it. So, um, hello. You're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

2899
02:20:52,760 --> 02:20:55,840
You might be muted, so go ahead and unmute and you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2900
02:20:55,840 --> 02:20:57,760
Who's this? Meow.

2901
02:21:00,200 --> 02:21:04,200
Four or five still alive. Uh oh.

2902
02:21:05,200 --> 02:21:08,120
Oh, well things happen sometimes. Uh, I guess the,

2903
02:21:08,160 --> 02:21:11,440
but it shows it's still muted. So I'll see if you mean it.

2904
02:21:12,480 --> 02:21:12,800
I'll see.

2905
02:21:12,800 --> 02:21:16,080
So they announced a new character for Street Fighter five championship edition.

2906
02:21:16,120 --> 02:21:18,920
Oh really? Who? Seth. Oh, why?

2907
02:21:18,960 --> 02:21:20,960
But Seth is coming back as a female character now.

2908
02:21:21,760 --> 02:21:22,600
What?

2909
02:21:23,600 --> 02:21:26,120
It's going to be a female character and then they have an nostalgia skin,

2910
02:21:26,120 --> 02:21:27,120
which is the male character.

2911
02:21:28,320 --> 02:21:29,640
Okay. All right. Cool.

2912
02:21:30,480 --> 02:21:33,360
So then Seth is, we'll just refer to Seth as gender fluid.

2913
02:21:34,280 --> 02:21:36,920
Well, he's also made out of metal, so I guess that would work.

2914
02:21:37,520 --> 02:21:42,120
Gender and metal fluid. Non-binary. Okay. So interesting.

2915
02:21:42,640 --> 02:21:45,480
Uh, when did they announce that? Just now tonight?

2916
02:21:45,520 --> 02:21:48,920
It was, yeah, I think they had some sort of event going on right now.

2917
02:21:50,680 --> 02:21:54,640
Uh, Dartusia says as long as Seth isn't the final boss again, that wasn't fun.

2918
02:21:55,200 --> 02:21:58,720
Uh, I don't think so because they have costumes that they're selling and,

2919
02:21:59,360 --> 02:22:02,920
or they have, uh, available. They have a story costume, battle costume,

2920
02:22:02,920 --> 02:22:07,280
nostalgia costume, which is the, the old design and then a summer costume.

2921
02:22:07,880 --> 02:22:09,520
And thank you. That was the other piece I was looking for.

2922
02:22:09,520 --> 02:22:12,720
Act F says the Capcom cup finals were today. Ah, yes.

2923
02:22:12,960 --> 02:22:15,840
So that's where that actually came from. All right, we'll try this one more time.

2924
02:22:16,240 --> 02:22:17,880
Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

2925
02:22:17,960 --> 02:22:19,480
Make sure you unmute yourself so we can hear you.

2926
02:22:23,160 --> 02:22:26,560
Okay. Well, we tried, I don't think it's a troll.

2927
02:22:26,560 --> 02:22:28,320
I think it's just somebody might be newer to discord.

2928
02:22:28,320 --> 02:22:30,160
So trying to figure that out. So it was a new,

2929
02:22:30,360 --> 02:22:32,640
it was a new name I didn't recognize. So I got excited for a minute.

2930
02:22:32,680 --> 02:22:36,920
And then there's this video that I see if some guy that beat time crisis to both

2931
02:22:36,920 --> 02:22:41,520
as player one and two on one, one credit. Now that's fun.

2932
02:22:42,360 --> 02:22:45,640
Good times. I guess it would be two credits because you know, one and two.

2933
02:22:46,360 --> 02:22:49,840
All right. Well, we're going to go ahead and wrap up, I guess,

2934
02:22:49,840 --> 02:22:53,520
for the night and, uh, close up shop here at orange launch radio. Uh,

2935
02:22:53,520 --> 02:22:56,720
but we do want to thank you guys for tuning in tonight and participating with

2936
02:22:56,720 --> 02:23:01,000
our show tonight. And, uh, Hey, if you did, uh, well actually wait before I do that,

2937
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,320
last minute stories, anything else besides the set thing? I'm sorry.

2938
02:23:03,640 --> 02:23:07,200
No, that's pretty much it. Okay. All right. Well, uh,

2939
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:09,880
I do want to thank you guys for being here tonight and listening to the show,

2940
02:23:10,200 --> 02:23:11,080
uh, participating, uh,

2941
02:23:11,080 --> 02:23:14,680
whether you were here live with us over at Twitch TV or you were downloading our

2942
02:23:14,680 --> 02:23:19,120
podcast feed, we appreciate it either way. Uh, and, um, yeah,

2943
02:23:19,320 --> 02:23:21,600
I definitely appreciate you supporting the show. Uh,

2944
02:23:21,640 --> 02:23:23,480
we'll be back next week to do it all again.

2945
02:23:23,480 --> 02:23:28,160
We'll be right on the heels of Christmas and right in the middle of Hanukkah

2946
02:23:28,160 --> 02:23:29,680
starts next Sunday, right?

2947
02:23:29,840 --> 02:23:32,280
Yeah. So Christmas will be the week after. Yeah.

2948
02:23:32,360 --> 02:23:35,960
And Hanukkah will just be starting. Oh my God. You know what it means?

2949
02:23:36,480 --> 02:23:39,280
Lotka. Good times.

2950
02:23:39,440 --> 02:23:43,120
I'll bring over lots of lot comics and we'll make a lot cause, but, um,

2951
02:23:43,320 --> 02:23:47,960
I might actually make pub cheese to put on it instead of sour

2952
02:23:47,960 --> 02:23:49,200
cream or applesauce.

2953
02:23:49,280 --> 02:23:52,160
So whatever holiday it is that you celebrate, uh,

2954
02:23:52,200 --> 02:23:54,040
we hope you guys have a great one. Uh,

2955
02:23:54,040 --> 02:23:56,000
or if you don't celebrate anything at all, um,

2956
02:23:56,080 --> 02:23:59,200
I hope this opportunity with all the holiday days is a good chance for you to

2957
02:23:59,240 --> 02:24:03,080
catch up on your gaming backlog. That's a, that's a gift too as well. So, um,

2958
02:24:03,360 --> 02:24:05,240
hope everybody, um, has a great next guy.

2959
02:24:05,240 --> 02:24:07,720
Cause I know all the holiday parties are starting in the next couple of weeks.

2960
02:24:07,880 --> 02:24:12,440
So I think this is, you know, we're, we're kind of moving into the, uh, holidays.

2961
02:24:12,680 --> 02:24:16,360
Yeah. SG100 Matt in chat says, I think Rob said he has a ton of lotka mix. I do.

2962
02:24:16,360 --> 02:24:17,280
Do not buy more.

2963
02:24:18,280 --> 02:24:22,960
I did buy more that I had more. Okay. All right. All right.

2964
02:24:24,560 --> 02:24:27,840
Let's go around and everybody get everybody's final thoughts. Um,

2965
02:24:27,920 --> 02:24:29,920
Loki, I guess we'll start with you. What's your final thought tonight?

2966
02:24:30,160 --> 02:24:33,840
Uh, my final thought is I still need to finish my Christmas shopping.

2967
02:24:35,920 --> 02:24:38,240
I realized that the timing is not good for that.

2968
02:24:40,600 --> 02:24:42,720
Um, my final thought is, uh,

2969
02:24:42,760 --> 02:24:45,600
what the UPS kept the power on for the show tonight.

2970
02:24:45,600 --> 02:24:48,880
So thank you Alan for that. Uh, thank you dark soccer for the gifts.

2971
02:24:48,880 --> 02:24:50,600
They're very much appreciated and, uh,

2972
02:24:50,640 --> 02:24:54,240
we'll definitely be using like the mug and those sorts of things. So thank you.

2973
02:24:54,240 --> 02:24:57,360
Thank you. And the socks, cause I love me a print sock. Um,

2974
02:24:57,360 --> 02:25:00,400
and I want to again just thank you guys for watching and those that have

2975
02:25:00,400 --> 02:25:01,280
supported, uh,

2976
02:25:01,320 --> 02:25:04,200
the VOG network channel and some of the special things we did like earlier this

2977
02:25:04,200 --> 02:25:07,760
week, the game awards, and then my own personal channel over at Mr. Rob Roberts

2978
02:25:07,760 --> 02:25:10,040
as well. Definitely appreciate all that support. Um,

2979
02:25:10,080 --> 02:25:12,600
I don't know what else to say. I just need to play some more games this week.

2980
02:25:12,880 --> 02:25:15,640
I've had this weird itch to start final fantasy 12 again,

2981
02:25:15,640 --> 02:25:18,120
cause I never beat it like any of the five times I've played it.

2982
02:25:18,120 --> 02:25:21,640
So maybe that's going to be like a hashtag gaming goal,

2983
02:25:21,800 --> 02:25:25,520
but don't forget, don't neglect your, uh, your bridge baby. Yeah,

2984
02:25:25,520 --> 02:25:27,560
I know. Death stranding. Yeah, I know. I still need to finish that.

2985
02:25:27,800 --> 02:25:31,240
Bridge baby is cute. Uh, dark soccer, your final thought tonight.

2986
02:25:31,640 --> 02:25:34,680
Number one, I freaking love the last episode of the Mandalorian.

2987
02:25:35,360 --> 02:25:39,120
And number two, tomorrow I am going to see reject false icons,

2988
02:25:39,600 --> 02:25:44,600
which is the gorilla's documentary slash movie thing that they're doing as a

2989
02:25:44,600 --> 02:25:48,680
limited run. I got shit seats cause people kept grabbing all the good ones,

2990
02:25:48,680 --> 02:25:50,880
of course, but Dan and I are going tomorrow.

2991
02:25:50,880 --> 02:25:55,480
So I figured that given that I often say reject false icons, um,

2992
02:25:55,520 --> 02:26:00,520
I'm also going to say reject stupid people like stupid people who attack

2993
02:26:00,640 --> 02:26:05,680
autistic girls on Twitter. All right. Well, that's the best be best.

2994
02:26:06,440 --> 02:26:08,880
That's going to do it for another episode of orange launch radio.

2995
02:26:09,080 --> 02:26:11,280
Happy gaming this week. Have a great week, everybody.

2996
02:26:11,280 --> 02:26:15,040
We'll see you in seven days to all over again. Good night.
