7000	14000	With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	21000	This week, the ninth generation is as new as it is old because Sony keeps the streak alive and Microsoft continues down a strange path of naming continuity.
21000	28000	What, you expected a different headline? Well, stay tuned for tonight's Stories of Plenty starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.
28000	33000	Orange Lounge Radio
33000	40000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio.
40000	46000	Live tonight with episode number 802 for this December the 15th of 2019.
46000	53000	My name is Rob Roberts and together with my co-hosts DarkSakura and TechMasterLoki
53000	60000	It's me eating on stream. It's fine. The good news is on the podcast they can't see it. We're celebrating one year here on Twitch.
60000	65000	So we've actually been doing this video thing for one year. I mean technically it's tomorrow but close enough.
65000	73000	By the time it comes out. Yeah, by the time the podcast is out it'll have been a year that we've moved over from...
73000	81000	I can't remember the name. I was about to say Live 365. It's been one whole year since we moved from Live 365. Can you believe it?
81000	87000	Are they still around? No, they finally closed for good. I think it was about 2013, 2014. So yeah.
87000	96000	Pour one out because we can make fun of them all we want. I'd rather drink it. This show wouldn't exist if that whole era hadn't happened.
96000	101000	So pour one out. Betty 365 wherever you're at. Hope you have a great job wherever you're at now.
101000	106000	Anyway, hello to all of you out in Twitch land and of course in podcast land.
106000	110000	We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network.
110000	115000	Twitch.tv slash VOG Network. V-O-G Network. Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show again.
115000	119000	6 Pacific, 9 Eastern every Sunday night. And you can watch us here on the video.
119000	124000	Or if you're a subscriber over at Twitch.tv slash VOG Network you can watch the video part on demand.
124000	132000	But of course our podcast free as it has been for over 17 years. Can you believe?
132000	139000	It's free because I still get the hiccups live on air and so that quality until I have a cure for hiccups I don't know what I'm going to do with that.
139000	145000	I might not be able to continue being free if we're going to fulfill all these user requests like smush muppet must happen.
145000	147000	We don't have the budget for a smush muppet.
147000	154000	We do have the budget for a smush emote and that is something that is coming for the tier 2 subscribers in the near future.
154000	161000	I keep forgetting to load that in the hopper but that is something I think that we were going to do to celebrate around the one year on Twitch or in 2020.
161000	163000	That will be something coming.
163000	167000	I can make a smush muppet but I could but I would not.
167000	170000	Why not? Muppets are fun. Muppets are hilarious.
170000	172000	Time. Cosplay.
172000	174000	There's other things we have to work on.
174000	176000	Working on logo.
176000	181000	We're talking about some refreshing and stuff behind the scenes like a new logo.
181000	187000	Potentially that whole shirt store sales stuff and getting that going for you guys that want to buy some merchandise.
188000	191000	Want to wear O.L.R. on your back without having to get a tattoo.
191000	193000	That would be awesome.
193000	198000	I can wear O.L.R. on my back without a tattoo but I had that thing made like 15 years ago.
198000	200000	Oh yeah that's right. Oh god I forgot about that shirt.
200000	202000	Now it actually fits me.
202000	205000	You made an old shirt for a DDR tournament or something.
205000	212000	It was when Chris and I, one of our O.L.R. lesbians, went to...
213000	218000	We were in Los Angeles I think. We were somewhere and we decided to have O.L.R. shirts made or something.
218000	220000	And so I still have my red and black O.L.R. shirt.
220000	222000	This is Dark Sakura Zero.
222000	224000	Oh yeah yeah. Those are fun. Those are great.
224000	228000	Anyway. Fifth Dream today in chat says, shit I just got the tattoo.
228000	230000	Well I mean that's cool.
230000	233000	I'm actually thinking about getting a tat- it's not going to be orange on straight I'm sorry to say.
233000	236000	But actually I'll say this because it is something...
236000	240000	It will actually be a piece of this show is what I'm looking to get tattooed on myself.
240000	242000	So as you guys know I...
242000	244000	It's going to be a poop. A pixel poop.
244000	246000	No it's not going to be a pixel poop.
246000	250000	As you guys know I lost my mom in 2017 and when that happened I knew that I wanted...
250000	253000	If I got a tattoo I wanted it to be something with my mom.
253000	261000	Well luckily since this show has that rich 17 year old history there's clips of my mom on this show in older episodes of this show.
261000	263000	Like we would call her on Mother's Day.
263000	268000	There was the infamous clip that everybody really loved when she was reviewing Mortal Kombat for the first time.
268000	273000	So what I'm actually going to be tattooing is I'm going to get a sound wave of her.
273000	275000	So it's a sound wave of my mom basically.
275000	277000	It needs to be Rob!
277000	280000	I haven't decided what the quote is going to be yet.
280000	282000	I have to go through what my options are from this show.
282000	286000	But the nice thing is I mean if it wasn't for this show I wouldn't have that.
286000	288000	So I guess maybe...
288000	290000	We have my mom too don't we?
290000	294000	We do somewhere. Now I couldn't tell you what episode but I know she was on this at one point.
294000	297000	I'm just going to tell my mom that we're going to call her and harass her one day.
298000	300000	Yeah I think it was a Mother's Day at some point.
300000	302000	I think we called my mom.
302000	305000	We called Loki's family one year I seem to remember that was the thing.
305000	308000	Yeah so we've done it for everybody.
308000	314000	Yeah I didn't mean to get all deep here but since it is the one year anniversary on Twitch and we're talking about tattoos I guess that's something.
314000	317000	Now I'm going to have to go get it soon because I keep talking about it.
317000	319000	Now I need to go do it.
319000	325000	But at the same time I'm thinking about getting it in a place where I'd have to take my shirt off to show you.
325000	327000	And I can't do that on Twitch.
327000	329000	What about forearm?
329000	331000	I don't want to get it on my forearm.
331000	333000	I'm probably going to get it either on my back.
333000	335000	I'm actually thinking I'm considering this one.
335000	337000	Even though I know that's very very visible.
337000	341000	But it's my mom so why shouldn't it be?
341000	343000	It's not appropriate to get it as a tramp stamp.
343000	345000	No I'm not going to get tramp stamps.
345000	347000	It's not going to be on my ass.
347000	352000	If there's not a lot of muscle or fatty tissue it's going to hurt a lot.
352000	354000	And that is why I don't get tattoos.
355000	357000	Because I'm a baby.
359000	361000	Now I want my tattoo of Loki saying, I'm a baby.
363000	367000	Anyway, I have thought about the back of the leg for that reason.
367000	369000	Can you tattoo it on my fat?
369000	372000	I'm actually thinking of having my first stone on the back of my neck.
372000	373000	Oh yeah?
373000	375000	I'll hop up on camera.
375000	376000	Okay.
376000	377000	Right here.
377000	378000	Oh yeah.
378000	383000	I have designed my own logo back when I was doing design work regularly.
383000	385000	And I was thinking about having my cherry blossom.
385000	386000	Oh.
386000	388000	Alan's thinking about getting a tattoo as well.
388000	389000	We should all just go get tattoos together.
389000	390000	Wouldn't that be fun?
390000	391000	Let's get a butt.
391000	392000	On a butt.
392000	395000	Yes that sounds incredibly terrifying.
395000	398000	I want my tattoo to be a destination tattoo actually.
398000	400000	Because I have friends that could do it here locally which is great.
400000	404000	But I want it to be something where like I went on a trip and I got this done.
404000	406000	And so this isn't just about that.
406000	410000	It's about my memory of Insert City here where I go to get it done.
411000	414000	Well you know Nikki, my friend.
414000	416000	Gary's sister.
416000	420000	She knows places in San Francisco I might go get my little thing done.
420000	423000	It shouldn't be a very expensive or very big one.
423000	429000	But I became actually pretty okay with needles after I had to start injecting myself.
429000	432000	It's just B12 so I wasn't like doing heroin or anything.
432000	440000	But I sort of lost my fear of needles after having to do sub-q B12 injections in my leg.
440000	443000	Which funny, it freaked Dan out one time.
443000	445000	Because it's red. This stuff is red.
445000	448000	And so it had shot back out of my leg when I pulled the needle out too quickly.
448000	450000	And he's like oh my god you're bleeding.
450000	451000	I'm like no.
451000	452000	Nope.
452000	453000	That's a nope.
453000	454000	Alright.
454000	455000	You are a baby.
455000	457000	Let me get some comments and chat.
457000	459000	And then I want to talk about the holidays a little bit.
459000	461000	And we will get into video games I promise. It was a busy week.
461000	467000	Akuma JP in chat says Rob if you're considering going to hot springs here, don't get in a place that's too obvious.
467000	469000	Are tattoos frowned on in Japanese culture?
469000	475000	There are some onsen that will have a tattoo prohibited.
475000	478000	I'm not jumping in the bath with all the naked old dudes.
478000	483000	So for example, it's like you can't have a full on sleeve.
483000	487000	But you could have something discreet somewhere.
487000	492000	It's just tattoos have a little bit more of a different social connotation.
492000	495000	And I mean I don't know if it's generic of me to say so.
495000	498000	But from everyone I've talked to it has to do back to Yakuza.
498000	502000	There's some folks in chat talking about that.
502000	506000	But I'm not in a hurry to jump in the bath with the old dudes.
506000	508000	So I think I'll be alright.
508000	511000	In Japan there will be a lot of other things I want to do.
511000	515000	I am planning when I eventually take my trip of going to Kyoto.
515000	518000	Because again I want to look at pretty kimono fabric.
518000	524000	Go to Kabuki and basically stalk Gekko and Maiko the whole time I'm there.
524000	530000	And then I want to go up to Sapporo and go to the onsen up there and see a fighter's game.
530000	531000	Fun.
531000	532000	Baseball.
532000	533000	Alright.
533000	536000	I'm trying to think.
536000	537000	I don't know.
537000	539000	I definitely want to do more world travel.
539000	541000	This next year though is the cruise.
541000	544000	Because you know I'm going with the crew from Starboard Power Coupling.
544000	546000	Which I know they've been on a hiatus here at VOG Network.
546000	548000	Because there has been a lot of new Trek to talk about.
548000	550000	But I imagine they're going to pick up very soon with Picard coming out.
550000	553000	But I'm going on the Star Trek cruise with them.
553000	556000	And that's going to be international.
556000	558000	So who's guesting on there?
558000	560000	Do they have any special guests?
560000	561000	Oh from Trek?
561000	562000	Oh absolutely.
562000	564000	We have photos scheduled with Kate Mulgrew.
564000	568000	We have Dr. Crusher, Gates McFadden.
568000	569000	We have...
569000	572000	Why do I keep wanting to say Marisa Tomei?
572000	573000	That's not...
573000	574000	Troy.
574000	577000	Why am I Marisa Tomei?
577000	578000	Ah!
578000	580000	We're going to get Troy.
580000	582000	And then let's see we also have pictures scheduled.
582000	583000	Wilson Cruz.
583000	584000	Awesome.
584000	585000	I wanted to get a picture.
585000	586000	So we have a few of those things scheduled.
586000	587000	And yeah it'll be fun.
587000	588000	So I'm really looking forward to the cruise.
588000	590000	We're going to have a good time.
590000	592000	Marisa Tomei should be in Star Trek actually.
592000	593000	Marina Sirtis.
593000	594000	Yeah I know.
594000	595000	I don't know why.
595000	596000	Her husband died.
596000	597000	Yeah it's really...
597000	598000	Trek had a really bad week a couple weeks ago.
598000	601000	They had a lot of passings and so forth.
602000	604000	Let's move on to a happier note.
604000	608000	Bobby Black Wolf says I'm jealous I'd rather be on the cruise with you and Grandpa.
608000	609000	Aw well I mean there's a...
609000	614000	I already know Grandpa's going to try to talk me into 2021 Star Trek cruise.
614000	617000	But I'm like it's a lot of money and time.
617000	620000	And so it's kind of like I would like to get more international travel in.
620000	622000	I don't know if I want to do the cruise back to back.
622000	625000	I might do it like odd number or even numbered years.
625000	627000	Having watched some of the videos online I would love to do a Disney cruise.
627000	630000	I just wouldn't love to pay for a Disney cruise.
631000	634000	I know why I wouldn't want to do a cruise.
634000	635000	Children.
635000	638000	Well that's exactly why I'd do the cruise is children.
638000	644000	You shove them off to be watched by other people that are paid to watch them and then you go have fun.
644000	646000	I want to go on an adult only cruise.
646000	647000	I believe...
647000	649000	I would like to go on an adult only cruise too.
649000	651000	That has nothing to do with Nookie.
651000	655000	I believe the Star Trek cruise is 21 and up.
655000	656000	Or 18 and up.
656000	657000	18 and up.
657000	658000	There are no...
658000	660000	Because I remember it was a controversy thing on Facebook.
660000	663000	Some people want to bring their kids.
663000	664000	Don't quote me on that you guys.
664000	667000	But I seem to remember eating something where like kids are not going to be there.
667000	669000	So I did have a dream about a cruise.
669000	672000	I dreamt that it was a cruise hosted by Gordon Ramsay.
672000	673000	Okay.
673000	674000	Sounds awesome.
674000	679000	And that I won like some lottery where I had to like learn how to cook from him.
679000	680000	You know what we need to do?
680000	682000	I don't know when this is supposed to open.
682000	685000	But we need to go up to Tahoe and go to the Hell's Kitchen restaurant.
685000	686000	We're putting in a Hell's Kitchen restaurant up there.
686000	687000	Do it.
687000	688000	Yeah.
688000	689000	We need to do it.
689000	692000	When I went to the one in Vegas, you know I got the beef Wellington.
692000	694000	Beef Wellington is among my favorite dishes.
694000	700000	I'm actually planning on, once I perfect my puff paste, I am going to do a beef Wellington.
700000	701000	All right.
701000	704000	Or getting the filet is going to be nuts.
704000	705000	I've done a beef Wellington.
705000	706000	Can we talk about video games?
706000	707000	Sure.
707000	708000	Sure.
708000	709000	But food is great.
709000	710000	Should we talk about these presents?
710000	711000	Yeah.
711000	712000	Okay.
712000	713000	The presents.
713000	714000	Festive holiday presents from Dark Sakura.
714000	715000	You want to open yours first, Loki?
715000	716000	Yes.
716000	720000	Let me move the food off of my laptop so that I don't spill it on the floor.
720000	721000	Okay.
721000	724520	So I kind of went all out because we just paid off a shitload of bills and Dan's mad
724520	726280	at me, but I don't care.
726280	730000	So I didn't like go like super crazy, but I went crazy enough.
730000	732000	Let's go crazy.
732000	733000	All right.
733000	737000	So Loki's, for the folks on podcast, Loki is opening the gift to see what's inside.
737000	738000	Oh, my nose is on air.
738000	742000	Looks like a fabric, maybe a t-shirt, I think is what we're looking at here.
742000	743000	There's a few things in there.
743000	744000	We're doing one at a time.
744000	746000	And see, I'm knocking stuff on the ground.
746000	747000	See, already.
747000	748000	So yes.
748000	749000	So this is...
749000	750000	Is it like a cyberpunk shirt?
750000	755520	No, it's even better than that because I see laser tag on here.
755520	757520	Oh, it's a laser tag shirt.
757520	758520	Okay.
758520	759520	Awesome.
759520	761520	It's laser tag kitten two.
761520	764200	That's sweet.
764200	768060	There's a story behind me fighting this shirt, by the way, because I was trying to order
768060	770640	a shirt from Cuzar.
770640	772640	Which doesn't really exist anymore.
772640	776600	There are producers of Cuzar shirts, but they want more than the cost of the shirt to ship
776600	777600	it.
777600	779480	And the shirt was actually pretty crazy.
779480	782640	So I was like, eh, birthday presents.
782640	794000	Yeah, thankfully I do have a Cuzar shirt from when I did actual league games there.
794000	796640	So I have one that still fits me, which is great.
796640	797640	Awesome.
797640	798640	Let's see here.
798640	801160	So I got an Xbox gift card.
801160	802160	Wow.
802680	806960	I've got Pocky, which I honestly have never had Pocky before.
806960	807960	Really?
807960	808960	Really?
808960	809960	And that is a super good flavor of Pocky.
809960	811640	It's like one of the seasonal deluxe ones.
811640	812640	And no Rocky?
812640	814640	Pocky and Rocky.
814640	817280	And then we've got Kiki Kai Kai.
817280	818280	I've got...
818280	819280	Kiki Kai Kai.
819280	821280	Looks like Super Mario socks.
821280	822280	What is this?
822280	823280	It's...
823280	824280	I'm trying to see what...
824280	826280	It's a picture of here.
826280	827640	I can't really recognize it.
827640	828640	I love fun socks.
828640	830200	Oh, it's a Piranha Plant.
830240	833120	I only saw one half of it, so yeah.
833120	834480	So it's like a Piranha Plant.
834480	835480	That's awesome.
835480	836480	Cool.
836480	840480	And then I got a card.
840480	841480	Because it's for me.
841480	842480	And the card says it's all for your kids.
842480	843480	And it's Happy Hanukkah.
843480	844480	Awesome.
844480	845480	Thank you.
845480	846480	You're welcome.
846480	847480	Fun.
847480	855960	You guys are, you know, just a great part of my life and I wanted to do something kind
855960	856960	and show you...
856960	857960	I love the shirt.
857960	858960	I'm glad you like it.
858960	862440	I was like, oh, fuck yeah.
862440	864440	We have a lot of chatters that are saying...
864440	865440	I told Nellie.
865440	866720	She's like, yeah, I get it.
866720	870240	There's a lot of folks in our chat that are saying Loki needs to try the Pocky live on
870240	871240	air.
871240	873660	So what kind of flavor is it?
873660	874660	It's chocolate.
874660	876360	Because Loki's a picky ass eater.
876360	878360	It's like a fine chocolate.
878360	880000	Chocolate should be fine.
880000	881000	Chocolate's safe.
881000	882000	It's just chocolate.
882000	884920	See, this way I pick just like a nice easy flavor.
884920	885920	Good, good, good.
885920	886920	Yeah.
886920	888480	Because, you know, Loki is a baby and he's picky.
888480	889480	He's a picky baby.
889480	891920	I'm not necessarily about food.
891920	892920	It's just...
892920	893920	Okay.
893920	894920	All right.
894920	896600	While you open that up, I'm going to open this.
896600	898200	So this is for Alan and I though, right?
898200	899200	You said?
899200	900200	Yes, it is.
900200	902520	But I'm sure he'll forgive you for opening it up on behalf of you both.
902520	903520	Fun socks.
903520	904520	Yes.
904520	905520	My favorite.
905520	907600	The tag came off of them, so I had to just fold them up.
907600	908600	Pizza socks.
908600	909600	They're pizza.
909600	910600	Pizza socks.
910600	911600	And you and Alan can fight over who gets which pair of socks.
911600	912600	Pizza time.
912600	913600	Okay.
913600	914600	Is this weird for me to talk about on air?
914600	916360	Alan and I share our entire wardrobe.
916360	919080	Our entire wardrobe because we're the same size.
919080	920080	That's fine.
920080	921080	So we share socks.
921080	922080	That's awesome.
922080	923080	I steal Dan's undershirts.
923080	924080	Yeah.
924080	925320	Although my stuff doesn't fit him.
925320	927840	Best part of being gay is double the wardrobes.
927840	931320	And what better than pizza but burger and fries to go with that?
931320	932320	Perfect.
932320	933320	Perfect.
933320	934320	I'm all about food.
934320	935320	Love it.
935320	936320	All right.
936320	937320	And let's see.
937320	938840	One of them I'll be surprised if you didn't guess I was getting it for you though.
938840	940220	Fresh food for skin.
940220	942000	My special recipes for beautiful skin.
942000	943000	This is an Alan thing.
943000	944000	That's an Alan thing for sure.
944000	945360	Alan loves these.
945360	948920	For those of you that watch Drag Race, you know that Alyssa Edwards when Alyssa Edwards
948920	949920	has samples.
949920	950920	Oh, okay.
950920	951920	Hold on.
951920	953800	The Loki is trying the Pocky for the first time.
953800	954800	Here we go.
954800	956840	Nom, nom, nom.
956840	959640	And he's evaluating.
959640	960640	It's all right.
960640	961640	It's chocolate.
961640	965040	By the way, I love he just talked into the Pocky like the Pocky was the mic.
965040	966920	I had the mic in my hand.
966920	967920	Okay.
967920	968920	So yes.
968920	974000	Anyway, if you've seen that Alyssa Edwards wearing the face mask, I've walked in on that,
974000	975000	but it's my husband.
975640	976640	So he loves the face mask stuff.
976640	977640	So he'll like that.
977640	978640	Yeah.
978640	979640	It's good.
979640	980640	I like it.
980640	981640	I'm excited about this funko verse.
981640	982640	Oh, it's a strategy game.
982640	983640	The golden.
983640	986800	Oh, it was that one that I was like, you better tell someone to get this for you.
986800	989280	It's the funko verse golden girls game.
989280	990840	I didn't want you to think that I got it.
990840	995500	So they have a game, but I knew you had, I had to gauge your reaction.
995500	996500	That's cool.
996500	997500	Yeah.
997500	1000720	Now can I put the other funcos with these funcos?
1000720	1002660	I'm sure those are little funcos though.
1002660	1003660	So they're tiny.
1003660	1004660	Okay.
1005320	1006320	Oh, that's fun.
1006320	1007320	But yeah.
1007320	1008320	So, so I had to double up cause it was you and Alan.
1008320	1009320	And nothing for Mr. Smoosh.
1009320	1010320	Yeah.
1010320	1011320	Cat.
1011320	1012320	I bought you stuff when you were new.
1012320	1013320	Ooh.
1013320	1014320	Ooh.
1014320	1015320	K cups.
1015320	1016320	Cause you know, I love me some coffee.
1016320	1017320	Cinnabon.
1017320	1018320	And I want one.
1018320	1019320	Which Dark Sakura bought for herself.
1019320	1020320	That's fine.
1020320	1021320	No, we love those.
1021320	1022320	You know how it goes.
1022320	1023320	And oh, fuck.
1023320	1024320	Yeah.
1024320	1026800	It's a phone stand, but it features a Bad Bats Maru.
1026800	1027800	My favorite.
1027800	1029720	I couldn't find the one for Alan.
1029720	1032200	That's what I was telling you when I was at the store.
1032200	1033200	That's all right.
1033200	1034200	He didn't need one.
1034740	1035740	That's something else for Alan.
1035740	1036740	Is this it?
1036740	1037740	I'm guessing.
1037740	1038740	That should be it.
1038740	1039740	Although you'll probably use it too.
1039740	1041420	Oh, he'll like this.
1041420	1043580	It's um, Hello Kitty and Choco cat.
1043580	1045860	I couldn't think of Choco cat.
1045860	1046980	That's the one he really likes.
1046980	1047980	It's got caropia.
1047980	1049660	It's the only Choco cat thing that I could find.
1049660	1050660	He'll love this.
1050660	1051660	He'll absolutely love this.
1051660	1052660	So there you go.
1052660	1053660	So anyway.
1053660	1055300	And then a card as well from Dark Sakura.
1055300	1056300	Yeah.
1056300	1057300	And it's a Hanukkah card.
1057300	1058300	It says happy Hanukkah.
1058300	1059300	Well, I have to read the card.
1059300	1060300	Okay.
1060300	1061300	Well read what's in it.
1061300	1062300	I hope I didn't put something stupid in there.
1062300	1063300	Let's see.
1063640	1064640	It's a personal message.
1064640	1065640	I'm not going to read it on air.
1065640	1066640	You can read it.
1066640	1067760	I don't care.
1067760	1069160	I hope you enjoy these items.
1069160	1071640	Since I couldn't find the HK pop ring.
1071640	1072640	I got Alan a mug.
1072640	1073640	Love you both.
1073640	1074640	Oh, we love you too.
1074640	1075640	Thank you.
1075640	1076640	Thank you.
1076640	1077640	Thank you.
1077640	1078640	Thank you.
1078640	1079640	Thank you.
1079640	1080640	Thank you.
1080640	1084820	And I promised Nellie I'd be baking soon and send a big batch of cookies home with you
1084820	1086160	are probably after next show.
1086160	1087160	So okay.
1087160	1088160	All right.
1088160	1090080	Well, we don't have any Betty in the chat room screaming.
1090080	1091960	Why aren't you guys talking about games?
1091980	1093820	So I guess we're doing fine so far.
1093820	1096740	So, but we will get into games a little bit here.
1096740	1098340	Let's talk about the game awards.
1098340	1102380	That was probably the big headline from this last week is that the game awards happened.
1102380	1106260	And there was a lot of stuff going on at the game awards.
1106260	1107260	Game of the year.
1107260	1109840	Sequero was the game of the year.
1109840	1113440	So which is admittedly haven't gotten around to that game.
1113440	1115580	Wasn't really on my radar because it's a from software game.
1115580	1118960	Not that I hate from software, but those dark souls games.
1118960	1119960	I'm terrible at them.
1119960	1120960	Called it.
1120960	1123340	But my husband loves those games.
1123340	1127620	So I'm sure he will get around to playing Sequero at some point, but I, you did call
1127620	1128940	it on the last episode, dark soccer.
1128940	1130140	I'm actually kind of surprised.
1130140	1135060	I was assuming it would be death stranding or smash with maybe control kind of being
1135060	1137640	like the dark horse in that race.
1137640	1139980	Did not think Sequero would actually pull it out.
1139980	1143860	Why, why do you think since you, you did kind of hit your bets there, why do you think Sequero
1143860	1145940	pulled out the win?
1145940	1149160	Just because I think it was a, you know, it wasn't weird.
1149160	1155260	I think because death stranding was very unique and I kind of put people off and smash is
1155260	1156660	just fucking smash.
1156660	1158340	So whatever.
1158340	1162900	I think it was new enough and odd enough and had a great story to it and a great, you know,
1162900	1167140	theme that it really had a little bit more staying power.
1167140	1171220	And I don't know many people who would go back and do a second run through death stranding,
1171220	1174420	but second all has like more challenge to it.
1174420	1176220	So I think that that was what did it.
1176220	1177220	And it's pretty.
1177280	1180720	Steph says it is fucking smash and I don't think she means that as a negative, but it's
1180720	1184760	one of those things where it's like, it was a game that came out last year for one.
1184760	1189480	And you know, we have had several smash games before and this was really like a, this game
1189480	1194480	is supposed to be basically the, the hodgepodge, every, everybody is here.
1194480	1196480	It's the everything celebration of smash.
1196480	1197840	And again, these aren't bad things.
1197840	1200840	Like absolutely is, should be one of the best games of the year.
1200840	1205680	But I think maybe because it did feel a little bit like we've been here before.
1205680	1209280	Maybe when we consider the critics that were voting on it, they wanted to pick something
1209280	1210740	kind of newer.
1210740	1214140	So they went for Sekiro, even though I guess you could say, well, Sekiro was kind of, but
1214140	1215940	it's not really the same as Dark Souls.
1215940	1217340	It's a different type of thing.
1217340	1221940	So, you know, it is, it is something a little newer and I don't think a Dark Souls or a
1221940	1224620	Bloodborne or anything has won a game of the year before.
1224620	1227540	I think Bloodborne was nominated, but I don't think it won.
1227540	1232660	So maybe it was kind of one of those, one of those time and tastes have changed.
1232660	1233660	Yeah.
1233660	1236160	And then it also says, I'm still waiting on Sakurai getting more recognition for his
1236160	1237160	life work.
1237160	1241060	Well, it did win best fighting game all over all of the traditional fighters that were
1241060	1245040	nominated, like your mortal combats and your, uh, you know, uh, samurai showdown, I think
1245040	1246460	was in there and that type of stuff.
1246460	1253040	So, I mean, I do feel like all of the games that were nominated won something like death
1253040	1257480	stranding of the director award smash one, the fighting game control got something didn't
1257480	1258480	it?
1258480	1260200	Or did I just keep seeing it as a nominee?
1260200	1264720	I don't remember, but at this point to see the ongoing game went to Fortnite.
1264720	1269320	Yeah, that was certainly, you know, in the final community, they do a lot of, they do
1269320	1273840	a lot of content updates, so I guess, I mean, that makes sense, but yeah, I don't know.
1273840	1274840	Uh, yeah.
1274840	1278040	And obviously we had a big one that dropped this past weekend, which Dark Sakura, I think
1278040	1279800	is, has a story on that coming up later.
1279800	1284120	Um, but yeah, there's that, Oh, outer worlds was the other nominee that didn't really win
1284120	1285120	anything.
1285120	1286920	Bobby Blackwell says, I don't think outer worlds won anything.
1286960	1292600	I think outer worlds, I think kind of suffered from being a little too, like, you know, the
1292600	1298000	fallout game we wanted to play this year or, you know, it kind of felt like it was a good
1298000	1301720	title, but it did also feel like we've kind of been here before type of thing.
1301720	1302720	Maybe.
1302720	1304120	Again, I don't want to make it sound like I'm dogging these games.
1304120	1308480	I'm just trying to figure out like, you know, how did a game like Sekiro, which is probably
1308480	1310700	one of the least talked about in the category.
1310700	1313240	How did it come through above all these other ones?
1313480	1319000	Maybe it was just the desire to give the award to something you're not hearing about as much.
1319000	1322560	I think one of the big winners from the game awards, honestly, I think even more so than
1322560	1327440	Sekiro was, um, Disco Elysium, I think was a huge winner because of the fact that one
1327440	1331840	two awards, I don't think it was on a lot of people's radar before that night.
1331840	1336400	But um, you know, it won two big awards and people were very excited about it.
1336400	1338880	Uh, and they had the folks on stage and everything.
1338880	1341520	I thought that was a pretty big deal.
1341520	1345220	So I think Disco Elysium was also one of the big winners of the night.
1345220	1348280	What did you guys think of the game awards for those that watched it?
1348280	1349460	Loki, you watched it.
1349460	1351080	What did you think of the game awards?
1351080	1352520	I thought it was good.
1352520	1355200	I thought they did a pretty solid event.
1355200	1357240	There was like very little of it.
1357240	1361640	That was kind of cringy and you know, the commercials this time of year didn't really
1361640	1363040	bother me as much.
1363040	1367760	Um, although I did see like a repeated commercial for a game that's already been out.
1368760	1373600	I kind of wish that there wasn't multiple commercials for the same game, but eh, it's
1373600	1374600	a minor gripe.
1374600	1376160	Yeah, they got to pay the bills somehow.
1376160	1379360	So if somebody wants to buy time to advertise a game that's already out.
1379360	1381440	And it was an indie game too that's advertising.
1381440	1383000	So I mean, true.
1383000	1384000	I don't know.
1384000	1385000	It was okay.
1385000	1388800	Um, Act Def correcting a little bit saying Disco Elysium won three awards.
1388800	1391240	I guess one of them was one of the fast forwarded categories.
1391240	1392240	That's why I must have missed it.
1392240	1397040	But Act Def clarifying it won best indie, fresh indie and narrative.
1397320	1399120	Um, Cypher Macinations in our chats.
1399120	1400720	Um, sorry if I mispronounced that.
1400720	1405520	I'm saying machina- I was thinking like fascination, fascination street, but machination.
1405520	1406520	You have machinima.
1406520	1407520	Machinima.
1407520	1408520	It says a machine.
1408520	1409520	Okay.
1409520	1410520	Machining issues.
1410520	1413960	Uh, The Outer Worlds was an amazing game, but it felt like a game you've already played
1413960	1414960	before.
1414960	1419080	No real reinvention or groundbreaking, a rock solid game, but nothing in your face.
1419080	1420080	Yeah.
1420080	1422760	I think, I think that kind of made it like a safe bet and there's nothing wrong with
1422760	1423760	a safe bet.
1424200	1428360	There's nothing wrong going to like your, your go-to favorite old comfort food, right?
1428360	1433480	But sometimes the one that takes the risks is the thing that gets rewarded.
1433480	1439240	So yeah, I, I definitely agree with that summary there, even if I butchered your name, I apologize.
1439240	1445240	Um, but anyhow, um, yeah, I, I don't usually watch the game awards start to finish, but
1445240	1448720	we did that co-stream here at VOG Network earlier this week where Bobby Blackwolf and
1448720	1450960	I were doing a stream with it.
1450960	1454080	And so I was kind of forced to watch the whole thing, but I, I didn't hate it.
1454080	1455640	Um, in fact, I rather liked it.
1455640	1457760	I thought it was, I thought it was efficient.
1457760	1458760	Yeah.
1458760	1462320	There's a few things now that I think of it that were kind of like a little cringy.
1462320	1465840	Um, the whole Apex Legends thing was a little cringy.
1465840	1470040	The Birds of Prey thing was kind of cringy and I get it was for a trailer, but it was
1470040	1471760	just, it's kind of like, eh.
1471760	1474960	I think Bobby and I were talking over that part, so we didn't even really know.
1474960	1477880	It's like, okay, like just, just show the trailer.
1477880	1480520	Just, we don't need like this lead up to it.
1480520	1482840	Um, but I mean, it's minor stuff.
1482840	1485160	I mean, what they did right was pretty awesome.
1485160	1486600	Every award show has something cringy.
1486600	1487880	The Oscars always do something cringy.
1487880	1491480	Of course, you know, like, you know, the Muppets thing that was fantastic.
1491480	1495880	And see the Muppets thing could have been cringy, but it really wasn't like, it was
1495880	1497040	really funny.
1497040	1500800	And the, the, the crossover with Untitled Goose Game was brilliant.
1500800	1506500	Like, you know, the, the fact that those two teamed up, not just for the, um, the Muppet
1506500	1510980	version of the Goose, but the fact that like, they actually put together this game footage
1510980	1512260	that had Beaker in it.
1512260	1515660	Like, honestly, the biggest disappointment of the night is that that Beaker expansion
1515660	1517260	isn't a real thing.
1517260	1518260	That would be amazing.
1518260	1520460	I wish, I wish that would really happen.
1520460	1523420	I think a lot of people do after the game awards, that's for sure.
1523420	1526100	So, um, yeah, I think that was, that was great.
1526100	1527100	Yeah.
1527100	1530500	Only the, only the Apex Legends thing came off as cringy and I think it went on too long,
1530500	1531500	I think in some ways.
1531500	1533900	And the Fast and Furious thing is like the final reveal.
1534180	1538220	Like I get that Vin Diesel is a pretty big land, Michelle Rodriguez is cool too.
1538220	1542540	And that's a pretty big land for, you know, who's announcing your best game of the year.
1542540	1546860	But I think the Fast and the Furious thing being like the final unveil of the night was
1546860	1552160	kind of a like, meh, like it was kind of like, especially when you had such huge stuff earlier
1552160	1553160	in the night, right?
1553160	1554160	Yeah.
1554160	1558500	It's like, it's hard to follow the, the new Xbox system or like, you know, Hey, here's
1558500	1565140	the first game for PlayStation five and it's like, here's Fast and the Furious and it looks
1565140	1566140	old.
1566140	1569260	Let's get into some of those other big reveals because as Loki mentioned, one of them, which
1569260	1575180	is just huge, is the fact that we got more information on the next Xbox, which I don't
1575180	1576480	think anybody was expecting.
1576480	1580240	You know, we had a lot of rumors about the game awards, what was going to be announced.
1580240	1581980	Pretty much all of them turned out to be bullshit.
1581980	1585380	Uh, the new smash character being unveiled, bullshit.
1585380	1588260	In fact, Nintendo really didn't show anything at all.
1588260	1590100	Uh, Doug Bowser was there.
1590100	1592940	Um, Reggie was there, but not in a Nintendo capacity.
1592940	1593940	Actually the Reggie speech was amazing.
1593940	1595380	I want to point that out.
1595380	1596820	Reggie speech was amazing.
1596820	1603220	And um, the, uh, gaming for good and spotlighting like the refugee, the, the, the veteran that
1603220	1606140	was making a game and the 11 year old that was making a game.
1606140	1607140	I think I even made a comment.
1607140	1608940	I'm like this 11 year old made a game.
1608940	1612780	Loki hasn't made a game and this 11 year old has made a game.
1612780	1613780	But no, I don't want it.
1613820	1616020	The 11 year old doesn't have a daytime job.
1616020	1620340	So, you know, I don't want to make light or make fun of the 11 year old because his story
1620340	1624300	was very heartwarming and, um, or heart wrenching, I should say.
1624300	1628020	And his, uh, the fact that he's kind of taking a lot of that emotion and putting it into
1628020	1629020	a game.
1629020	1631820	I mean, you want to say games, aren't an art form.
1631820	1632820	Look at that.
1632820	1636340	Like that is, you know, the, the, how he's developing that game is, is an expression.
1636340	1638860	Like that just, that just serves to be game as an art form.
1638860	1641220	So, I mean, those are some very powerful segments.
1641220	1646580	So even though we might've lost the, um, lifetime achievement award, I was totally fine with
1646580	1649740	the, the gaming for good as a like replacement, if you will.
1649740	1652420	I thought it was, those were really like powerful segments.
1652420	1656180	Um, anyway, so the, the Nintendo stuff ended up being bull.
1656180	1661180	Yes, Nintendo did have a trailer for Bravely Default 2, but that was actually a Square
1661180	1662500	Enix announcement, right?
1662500	1664020	They had like just commercials.
1664020	1666940	That was about the most that you had from Nintendo there.
1666940	1667940	Exactly.
1667940	1668940	Right.
1668940	1672620	Um, Shane is in chats, uh, talking about the No More Heroes 3 trailer.
1672620	1673620	It was amazing.
1673620	1678500	And I've never played a proper No More Heroes yet, but again, third party trailer, but it
1678500	1679500	wasn't.
1679500	1680500	Maybe I skimmed through that one.
1680500	1684220	Oh no, it was, it was the one that they started, it was like a goddamn superhero was the first
1684220	1685780	name or something like that.
1685780	1687500	And then it actually ended up being No More Heroes 3.
1687500	1688500	It was towards the beginning.
1688500	1690300	I think I must've missed it.
1690300	1691300	Go back and check it out.
1691300	1694740	It was, it was, it was a very good trailer, so that was cool.
1694740	1698060	Um, so anyway, uh, that was BS.
1698060	1701300	Uh, the next Rock Steady Batman game was rumored.
1701300	1703140	That didn't show up either, so.
1703140	1710220	And I know that, uh, gameplay for, uh, Fallout, or not Fallout, Half-Life, Alyx was cut at
1710220	1711220	last minute.
1711220	1715340	Yeah, there's a lot of talk about that too, that that didn't end up happening, so interesting.
1715340	1716380	But what did we get?
1716380	1721900	I think something that nobody was expecting, and that was the official name and first early
1721900	1729740	details on Project Scarlet, which is now and forever, Xbox Series X.
1729740	1732800	That is the name of the console.
1732800	1736340	Even though it has that word series in there, which really threw me for a loop at first,
1736340	1740100	I was like, cause as it was being unveiled on the stream, I was thinking, oh, okay, well
1740100	1745460	then this lends itself to that they're going to have the, um, uh, discless one, they're
1745460	1748140	going to have the one with the disc, like there's going to be a series of consoles.
1748140	1749140	Nope.
1749140	1753460	There's a console called Xbox Series X, and what we're looking at on Twitch, you might
1753460	1756860	hear a little bit in the background, is we're looking at that reveal trailer that showed,
1756860	1761500	you know, it looks, it does look really good, like the, the detail in the environment is
1761500	1763780	really stunning when you're looking at this.
1763780	1769340	Um, and you know, you see some, like, assumably Forza, Halo, and, uh, Soccer kind of all rolled
1769340	1770340	up in one.
1770340	1771340	FIFA Pro.
1771340	1772340	Yeah.
1772340	1775100	And then we see, oh, here it is, it looks like it is a tall tower, uh, although it is
1775100	1778580	confirmed you can put it in either configuration sideways or up and down.
1778580	1782300	This is the tall tower and I hope it really does glow green like that cause I do like
1782300	1783300	that glow.
1783300	1787360	Uh, and the new controller that will go with it, that is the Xbox Series X.
1787360	1792060	That is the official name of what was formerly known as Project Scarlet.
1792060	1793180	So what do you guys think about that name?
1793180	1794420	Xbox Series X?
1794420	1796260	It's confusing, but I don't care.
1796260	1797260	It's fine.
1797260	1800660	It doesn't, I don't really care what it's called.
1800660	1801660	Right.
1801660	1802660	Yeah.
1802660	1806020	It's, I, I, I really didn't like it at first because I also thought it was confusing.
1806020	1807020	I was like, wait a minute.
1807020	1808820	It's a series, but it's only one.
1808820	1809820	Like what is that all about?
1809820	1812660	I think, I think this is what it is.
1812660	1816520	I think Xbox gaming is simply Xbox.
1816520	1819700	They just want to say, you're going to play it on Xbox, you're gonna play it on your Xbox.
1819700	1823340	You've got an Xbox game and Xbox service and all this stuff.
1823340	1827140	And I think the reason why they're going with Series X, it has to do with the fact that,
1827140	1831420	uh, Microsoft has said this before, is that now when you buy a game, it will be playable
1831420	1834260	on their entire ecosystem.
1834260	1835260	Right.
1835500	1837340	Starting with Xbox one.
1837340	1839660	I don't think you can play those games on Xbox 360.
1839660	1844980	So it'll have to be Xbox one or the first, and now kind of like you might have cars that
1844980	1846940	come out in different series or models.
1846940	1853380	This is Series X and then maybe in 2023 or whenever we get a refresher thing, we might
1853380	1857560	get Series Y or Series Platinum or Series.
1857560	1858560	And there'd be different ways.
1858560	1860900	I think it'd just be like X2, X3, X4.
1860900	1863080	And that may be something they do as well.
1863680	1867520	Kind of like, like, like they're thinking about like phones, you know, where you have
1867520	1871720	the Samsung Galaxy S4, S5.
1871720	1872720	I think you're right.
1872720	1877180	If you think about this name as like a cell phone name, it makes a lot more sense than
1877180	1879640	maybe what has traditionally been a console name.
1879640	1882400	And for that reason, I'm warming up to it a little bit.
1882400	1885480	I don't think it's as detrimental a name as Xbox Wii U.
1885480	1886480	What?
1886480	1887480	Xbox Wii U.
1887480	1888480	Wow.
1888480	1890040	I mean, that would be pretty detrimental too.
1890040	1891600	I don't know what this is.
1891600	1892600	Wow.
1893120	1894560	Is this a Nintendo product?
1894560	1895840	Is it a Microsoft product?
1895840	1896840	Let's try that again.
1896840	1901840	I don't think it's detrimental as a name as Nintendo Wii U, but I think because, you know,
1901840	1905120	Wii U lended itself to think, oh, it's an upgrade to the Wii and all this other stuff
1905120	1906320	that wasn't true.
1906320	1911480	But I think, you know, Xbox Series X, I think it's I don't hate it.
1911480	1917240	The only thing that's weird, I think it gets really easily confused with Xbox One X.
1917240	1919320	That was the thing that really threw me at first.
1919560	1924040	That might be like kind of what they're going with there, whereas the Series X is going
1924040	1927160	to be like their high end and they're going to have Series S, which is going to be their
1927160	1928560	low end or something.
1928560	1929560	Maybe.
1929560	1930560	Or, I don't know.
1930560	1931560	Yeah.
1931560	1935840	So I think Microsoft is adopting basically cell phone naming conventions.
1935840	1938800	And quite simply, these consoles are Xboxes.
1938800	1940080	It's the Xbox.
1940080	1943800	So we don't necessarily have to talk about games coming out for Xbox Series X.
1943800	1945560	The games are coming out for Xbox.
1945560	1946880	You can play them on your Series X.
1946880	1947880	You can play them on your One.
1947920	1949280	You can play them on your One X.
1949280	1950760	You can play them on, right?
1950760	1954440	Just like an Android game comes out for Android and you can play them on all sorts of these
1954440	1955560	different things.
1955560	1959240	That is where Microsoft is taking their naming conventions, in my opinion.
1959240	1964400	So now, and a lot of people in chat talking about something that I brought up on Twitter.
1964400	1968280	So a lot of people remember when the Xbox One was announced, what did we abbreviate
1968280	1969280	it as?
1969280	1970280	The Xbone.
1970280	1972800	XB1, the Xbone, right?
1972800	1975800	Well, think about that name, Xbox Series X.
1975840	1978280	I know I pointed this out when we were live.
1978280	1979280	XSX?
1979280	1980280	Close.
1980280	1982280	Xbox Series.
1982280	1985280	XSEX.
1985280	1986280	That's a stretch.
1986280	1987280	It's the X-Sex.
1989880	1991480	So it is done.
1991480	1992480	It is named.
1992480	1993480	The Box-Sex.
1993480	1994480	It is law.
1994480	1997480	Xbox Series X is the X-Sex.
1997480	1998480	Done.
1998480	2000480	It's a good name.
2000480	2002480	You know they have to know that that's a potential.
2002480	2004480	That's a bit X-X-ive.
2005160	2010160	It is a bit X-Sex-ive.
2014160	2016160	Alright, anyway.
2016160	2020160	Dark Soccer, you weren't watching the Game Awards, so you didn't see this all play out,
2020160	2023160	but I know you just got a peek there at that little trailer and so forth.
2023160	2025160	I will say things we have not gone over.
2025160	2026160	I think I was working.
2026160	2027160	What was that?
2027160	2028160	I think I was working.
2028160	2029160	Yeah.
2029160	2030160	I think you were too.
2030840	2036560	They also announced, and it should be noted, Hellblade Setsuna Part 2 is Ninja Theory's
2036560	2037560	game they're working on.
2037560	2041600	There was a really cool little trailer that had an actress that looked like she was like
2041600	2043600	a cave person kind of singing death metal.
2043600	2044600	Cool.
2044600	2045600	That's what it looked like to me.
2045600	2046600	I'm down.
2046600	2047600	Yeah, right?
2047600	2048600	You should look up the trailer.
2048600	2049600	She's from the first game too.
2049600	2050600	She is from the first game.
2050600	2055120	But I'm like, is that actually a live grab of somebody or is that like, okay, it looks
2055120	2057480	like a real fucking person.
2057480	2058960	The graphics are crazy.
2058960	2062560	But anyway, so we have that as well and all that.
2062560	2066920	What are your thoughts on, I know you haven't been a big Xbox household, but what do you
2066920	2069040	think about where Microsoft strategy is going?
2069040	2072720	I kind of don't care because Microsoft hasn't really done anything that I've been excited
2072720	2074800	about in a while.
2074800	2077960	So I'm just going to wait for another PlayStation.
2077960	2084120	Well, funny you should say that because not to be outdone, I suppose we also, so we got
2084120	2090920	the first Xbox series X title, or I should say new Xbox title and a hell blade, uh, too.
2090920	2096260	But then we also got the very first PlayStation five game and the footage for that.
2096260	2102240	And I didn't have time to rip, but yeah, Epic exclusive by the way, because you know, gearbox,
2102240	2103240	thank you.
2103240	2106960	But we had the first, uh, PlayStation five game footage in the form of Godfall, which
2106960	2110160	is a brand new IP looters slasher.
2110160	2111160	They're calling it.
2111160	2112160	Yeah.
2112160	2113160	It's not a Sony game.
2113200	2117120	The reason why we're seeing this early is because they could have been showing like
2117120	2120760	the PC version and saying it's a PlayStation five game as well.
2120760	2121760	Like it's interesting.
2121760	2125740	See, I don't know if necessarily Sony had anything to do with this reveal because technically
2125740	2127320	it was a third party reveal.
2127320	2130400	They could have been showing the PC version and saying, Oh, we're making it for PlayStation
2130400	2131400	five as well.
2131400	2134440	Um, it might be a time exclusive or something.
2134440	2139440	It might be, but anyway, it's a, it is a, the first PlayStation five game that we got
2139440	2140440	to look at.
2140440	2142080	And obviously the graphics looked really good.
2142080	2146560	Um, I was getting very Xenoblade kind of vibes from the art, especially in the sword
2146560	2148160	and all that stuff that we were seeing.
2148160	2152080	Um, but I'm, I'm definitely interested in more, uh, quest buster wants to point out
2152080	2155520	God falls by counterplay to be published by gearbox.
2155520	2156520	So yeah.
2156520	2161320	Um, Shane and chat saying while Microsoft hasn't made like an exclusive game I've cared
2161320	2165120	about for awhile, man, if games pass, isn't like the best thing out there.
2165120	2166120	Yeah.
2166120	2167480	I games pass is really cool.
2167480	2172040	Um, I think there will be, you know, again, they bought, they have 15 studios now.
2172040	2175320	So I think there will be something in there that's going to win people over.
2175320	2179520	Um, for me, certainly a new force of horizon is all it's going to take.
2179520	2182600	Uh, but even if you know, they're, they do a new fable.
2182600	2184800	If that rumor comes true, I would love that.
2184800	2186400	I would love a new fable game.
2186400	2189320	So there's, there's still a lot of stuff I think Xbox can pull out.
2189320	2190320	That'd be really exciting.
2190320	2196800	So, um, but yeah, who knew that at the game awards this week we would see our first Xbox
2196800	2200120	new Xbox game and our first new PlayStation five game.
2200120	2201840	That was a pretty big deal.
2201840	2204120	So yeah, but more to come in the next year.
2204120	2208880	So any other thoughts on the game awards from anyone and how that all went down?
2208880	2217000	Um, no, I mean, I, uh, there was some other game trailers that I was excited about.
2217000	2220960	So surgeon simulator two, which looks like a co-op game now.
2220960	2224120	So call these four player co-op, four player co-op.
2224120	2225120	So that's going to be insane.
2225120	2227120	Um, so that looked cool.
2227160	2230480	Uh, there was, I'm trying to think what the other one was.
2230480	2232120	That was pretty cool.
2232120	2235960	I know they have that like brawler game that was VR that looked kind of neat.
2235960	2240800	Um, I want the beaker on title goose game.
2240800	2242600	Uh, yeah, yeah.
2242600	2243680	I mean, that looks cool.
2243680	2247120	Um, I know there's that new, that nine to five looked interesting.
2247120	2248160	Nine to five looks all right.
2248160	2252240	Uh, that new player unknown game that they just teased being really prologue.
2252240	2255720	Uh, the, the sons of the forest or whatever that was with the three legged.
2255720	2256400	Oh yeah.
2256400	2257400	Sons of the forest.
2257400	2257680	Yeah.
2257680	2259320	The, the, the sequel to the forest.
2259320	2262440	Yeah, that was, yeah, that's going to be scary.
2262800	2264120	Yeah, that's interesting.
2264280	2266960	Uh, there was another one that looked like a civilization or something.
2266960	2268040	It was in the pre-show I think.
2268720	2270280	Yeah, I remember that.
2270640	2270880	All right.
2270880	2272120	Anyway, uh, let's see.
2272120	2276240	Yeah, the only problem is, uh, the nine to five game is not going to have Dolly
2276240	2277360	Parton singing the theme song.
2277360	2283440	And I think that's an issue anyway, although it should, can you imagine if it
2283440	2288760	had like a death metal version of Dolly Parton's nine to five, get the Setsuna
2288760	2291920	girl, uh, to sing the Dolly Parton nine to five.
2291960	2292480	Perfect.
2293120	2295200	Uh, that weird West look kind of cool.
2295240	2299560	Bobby is saying the untitled shark game that now has a title man-eater.
2300000	2301400	That did look hilarious.
2301480	2304360	Did you see that with the sharks eating the people, but you play as the shark.
2307840	2309800	That's a game up dark soccer's alley as well.
2309880	2312960	Don't you want to play a game where, but you're the shark and you kill people.
2313080	2313800	That sounds like fun.
2313800	2314200	Doesn't it?
2314280	2316880	Wasn't that like the old Jaws game that they had?
2316880	2319200	You could play as we don't, we don't talk about that.
2319200	2319480	Logie.
2320240	2321080	That one is all right.
2321800	2327240	But it was it the awkward, the awkwardness that is the Wolf Among Us two, a telltale
2327240	2329680	series, except that studio doesn't exist anymore.
2329880	2330480	Oh yeah.
2330480	2331720	The Wolf Among Us two that's it.
2331720	2335120	Because now the original Wolf Among Us is a free on Epic game store for one.
2335400	2338040	But yeah, very, very interesting.
2338040	2340840	I hope at a later time, we can really take a deep dive into that.
2341160	2345680	And, uh, what that all means with the fact that, you know, you had this studio that
2345680	2348520	was working on it, that effect effectively was shut down.
2348760	2351480	And now this other studio kind of takes it over.
2351640	2355040	And although there might be some people that were on the old project, they're on
2355040	2355840	the new project.
2356040	2358080	There's some people out there that have kind of moved on.
2358080	2360840	And so it's like, almost like you're seeing somebody else raise your kid.
2361000	2365080	I know that's a really extreme perspective, but that is like the sense.
2365080	2366760	That would be the only way I would have a kid.
2367000	2373480	So, uh, so yeah, it's, uh, is it, but I mean, if we just look at it on a pure
2373480	2376600	superficial level of, Oh, the game is coming and the game is happening.
2376760	2379720	I think a lot of people are very excited that Wolf Among Us is getting a sequel
2379720	2380240	after all.
2380240	2382720	So there is that anyway.
2383160	2384200	Um, let's see.
2384240	2386600	Um, what else I want to say about trailers?
2386600	2386880	Dang.
2386880	2388320	There was one other one I was going to mention.
2389000	2390200	Oh, well, I forget in the moment.
2390240	2391320	I'm sure it'll come to me later.
2391680	2391960	Anyway.
2391960	2393800	So I, I was a fan of the game awards.
2394040	2395920	Oh, I want to mention the music performances.
2396280	2399600	You know, usually music performances are kind of like, why?
2399960	2403040	Or it's like, we just got this band cause we could, and it was cool.
2403040	2404200	Yes, exactly.
2404200	2406240	The, the one that they did for cyberpunk.
2406840	2407080	Yeah.
2407080	2407760	The awesome.
2407960	2411040	So when it first started, I was like, why is Grimes performing?
2411040	2411800	What's the point?
2411800	2415680	And she's like, she's not even a good lip-syncer, but then it was like, Oh,
2415680	2419520	Grimes has a song on the cyberpunk soundtrack and the song was pretty good.
2419760	2424560	And the little preview role for the soundtrack was pretty diverse with, you
2424560	2428240	know, you had some rap artists, you had some electro artists, you had, you had a
2428240	2429920	really broad range of stuff in there.
2429920	2430480	So it looked interesting.
2430960	2431320	Yeah.
2431600	2432320	So there was that.
2432680	2436720	Um, and, uh, yes, the final fantasy seven remake trailer.
2436720	2437320	Yes, there was that.
2437320	2439880	It was a lot of the same stuff, but I'm still very hyped about that game.
2440360	2441600	Um, music performances.
2441600	2442760	I thought churches did great.
2442800	2444680	I loved the orchestra with churches.
2445000	2446360	I loved the orchestra.
2446360	2447720	They did this like they did last year.
2447720	2451920	They did a medley of the game of the year nominees, the orchestra, and it was great.
2452320	2455440	Um, very, it was very good this year, just like it was last year.
2455440	2458160	But then they had the orchestra playing with churches and that was gorgeous.
2458160	2461040	That was the open air for the official show is, uh, churches doing death
2461040	2462080	stranding with the orchestra.
2462080	2462680	I love that.
2462920	2464080	And then a green day.
2464480	2468560	And for most of the green day performance, I was like, they are just, they just got
2468560	2470360	green day to perform because it's green day.
2470600	2474560	But then, and again, as we're watching it live, I'm like, Bobby, do you notice that
2474560	2479520	Beat Saber is playing behind them and green day is etched into the wall in Beat Saber?
2479920	2484200	Oh, dream day is the next band getting Beat Saber packs.
2484200	2488120	And sure enough, that was the announcement is that now we not only have what Imagine
2488120	2491680	Dragons, I think was it Panic at the Disco had a set or was it?
2491680	2492000	Yeah.
2492000	2492280	Yeah.
2492440	2497520	And then, uh, now we have, um, uh, green day as an official Beat Saber, uh, DLC.
2497600	2500920	So that's, um, yeah, it was a very busy night.
2501800	2506120	Those good stuff, especially with no, um, official Sony event in December, you know,
2506120	2508240	all those trailers and announcements have to go somewhere.
2508240	2511880	And I know later in the show, we've talking about little things from Sony and Nintendo
2511880	2515600	that had some trailers and some big stuff, but you know, nothing that had really the
2515600	2518960	volume that we saw at the game awards, big, big stuff.
2519280	2520960	All right, let's move on.
2521000	2521960	I know it was a busy week.
2521960	2525520	Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing
2525520	2526040	this week.
2526040	2527800	And we'll start with Dark Sakura.
2527800	2528560	How was your gaming week?
2528680	2530760	Pokemon sword only a little bit.
2531080	2534680	And then I've been playing Pokemon go animal crossing pocket camp.
2535280	2540360	Um, uh, idle pouring, uh, the Harry Potter thingy.
2541160	2545280	Um, I just haven't had a super, I tried to play the Sims.
2545280	2546640	I'm going to get my computer crashed.
2546640	2552680	So that's why I also haven't picked up, um, uh, Detroit become human, even though I really
2552680	2556040	like to play it at just not feasible for me right now.
2556040	2560160	Not until I replace my computer or at least figure out what's making it crash.
2560760	2563600	I mean, I may be ready for a new motherboard, so we'll see.
2564680	2571200	Um, but other than that, just, you know, the usual, I haven't really had a lot of time
2571200	2577840	for things getting ready for, excuse me, like I did some baking and I sent, uh, a gift to
2577840	2579400	our friend in Canada.
2581160	2582080	How many, Mr.
2582200	2582880	The real one.
2583280	2584480	Yes, yes, of course.
2585200	2591960	And, um, I, uh, I, I, I'll, I'll, I'll let him see it when it arrives, but it's things
2591960	2595320	that I understand are not easy to obtain in the great white north.
2595440	2595840	Okay.
2596000	2597360	So you send them some in and out.
2598200	2600600	No, I sent those some of my own cookies.
2601080	2603600	I also sent our friend, the seg, some cookies.
2603880	2604360	Oh, great.
2604760	2608160	So I have been baking and I have more people to bake for.
2608160	2613400	So, um, if I walk around smelling like, you know, sugar and creme de menthe, that's probably
2613400	2615880	why either that or just gave up and started drinking the creme de menthe.
2617440	2618120	It happens.
2618560	2618920	All right.
2618920	2619840	Especially when I bake.
2620200	2621480	Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?
2622640	2626200	Um, so I didn't really play anything.
2626360	2630280	No, I've been mainly working on my game and stuff.
2630280	2636120	So I, uh, got to the point where in my procedural generation stuff, I was trying
2636120	2641240	to make it so that I can have the players go through like the maze.
2641240	2645120	That is a level in a way that would kind of take them towards the end with a little
2645120	2649000	bit of meandering through, um, that was pretty hard to do.
2649040	2651480	And so I decided I'm not doing that.
2651480	2654240	And I'm just going to let you wonder where in the hell you want, because then it opens
2654240	2657280	up the opportunity to put like secret rooms and fun stuff like that.
2657280	2659520	So that also made my job a lot easier.
2659520	2662840	It means I can move on to the next thing I'm going to do, which is actually, um,
2662880	2665320	procedurally generating the rooms themselves.
2665680	2670920	And then along with that, the enemies that spawn the room and that sort of thing.
2670920	2674280	So that's where I got to this week is that, that, and I've been
2674280	2676200	working a little bit on artwork.
2676200	2680920	Um, I was doing some pixel art stuff that I was like sharing out and
2680920	2684160	Twitter and stuff for t-shirt designs.
2684640	2686600	So, all right.
2687080	2687440	Awesome.
2687600	2687840	Yeah.
2688080	2688280	Good.
2688880	2690240	Um, let's see my gaming week.
2690240	2693320	So my weekend was dominated with mobile phone GPS games.
2693520	2696440	Cause we had Pokemon go community day, Saturday and Sunday.
2696640	2700040	I played the entire three hours Saturday and I played about two hours today
2700040	2701440	before I finally got burned out.
2701640	2704480	But, uh, it was nice because I was able to get some of the shinies that I
2704480	2706000	completely missed out on the first time.
2706000	2709040	So I've like four shiny mudkips where I had zero before.
2709320	2713080	And I got a, I got a shiny trap inch, which I had zero of those before.
2713080	2715600	So, um, I was, I was happy to catch up on that.
2715600	2718240	In fact, the mudkip, I got a three-star appraisal one.
2718240	2719360	So that made me very, very happy.
2719400	2721440	I got a couple of shinies too, from work.
2721760	2722520	Oh, well, hey.
2722600	2724680	Only one of each things that I never got before.
2724920	2725920	Say, Hey, it's something.
2726080	2726600	Yeah.
2726840	2730160	So are they just, do they just like bump up the level of shinies?
2731320	2731880	What do you mean?
2732040	2737240	On, um, they boost them specifically between 11 AM and 2 PM during the, during
2737240	2737840	this weekend.
2738240	2742600	Um, but the actual Pokemon that were part of the community days, they're
2742600	2744440	all increased everywhere.
2744440	2747360	So you just by nature have a better chance of finding those shinies.
2747360	2749160	Cause there's more of those Pokemon out in the wild.
2749640	2753200	Um, but I actually, I dual wielded community day on Saturday.
2753200	2756560	And what I mean by that is that I was actually Bluetooth catching for Pokemon.
2756800	2760760	And I was playing Harry Potter community day on my phone because, uh, Harry Potter
2760760	2765400	Wu or Wizards Unite had their community day and I kind of hit the pedal to the
2765400	2766080	metal on that.
2766080	2767280	I gained two levels.
2767280	2772120	So I'm level 29 now and, uh, you know, got, I finished all the little quests you
2772120	2773520	had to do that day and all that stuff.
2773760	2777480	So I got a Totodile and a Swinub.
2778000	2778400	Fun.
2778600	2779360	They're both green.
2779560	2781280	Swinubs look like a little watermelon.
2781480	2781920	They're cute.
2782080	2782560	Yeah.
2783200	2785840	Um, and let's see.
2785880	2787520	Um, uh, what else?
2787520	2788720	So I did Harry Potter.
2788720	2792760	And then last night I went out with my Ingress buddies and we just, we, uh, there's
2792760	2795280	like a group of us that all kind of live here locally in the neighborhood.
2795280	2798560	And we were in a chat and we're like, let's go to the Olive Garden.
2798600	2802080	So we, we decided to go, well, here's the punchline.
2802080	2805240	So, so, and then of course, as we're driving to Olive Garden, it's like, I have
2805240	2806880	this mobile full of Ingress players.
2807000	2811040	So as we're driving, it's like, we're turning everything like our color and all
2811040	2811440	that stuff.
2811720	2815560	Um, but then the funny thing was, um, the way to Olive Garden was like an hour.
2815680	2817520	So we went to the second best restaurant.
2817520	2821880	We went to Red Lobster, which I hadn't been there.
2822360	2825680	In Red Lobster far exceeds all our biscuits.
2825720	2826120	Yes.
2826120	2826880	Cause I got to have the business.
2827080	2829920	The only bummer is though, Olive Garden has a portal.
2829960	2831080	Red Lobster does not.
2831320	2835440	So there was no hacking during dinner, but then we went out and did some more and we
2835440	2836200	were going to stop.
2836240	2838480	And then one of the other players started taking down what we were doing.
2838480	2841400	So we were like rampage raw and went through the neighborhood.
2841400	2843640	Just, just having fun and chatting and being nerds.
2843680	2847800	So I had a very full, uh, cell phone gaming weekend, but I did play some of the
2847800	2851360	traditional stuff too, still playing Final Fantasy 14, little bit of Pokemon.
2851360	2853840	I did a stream earlier this week, just trying to fill out the decks a little
2853840	2857400	more, doing the raid, still trying to get that goddamn Gigantamax Snorlax.
2857400	2860880	I still don't have, but I pretty much told Shane, I'm going to make him trade me
2860880	2862000	one if I don't catch one.
2862000	2865840	And, uh, he has like 17, so it's not going to be a problem, uh, on three different
2865840	2866520	accounts, I'm sure.
2866520	2870800	So, um, yeah, so just making progress in those games.
2870960	2874560	I think a little bit of Death Stranding, but I really, I really need to like sit
2874560	2877680	down and play Death Stranding if I ever want to actually beat it.
2877680	2879320	Cause I'm not very far into the game right now.
2879320	2884600	And one of my friends said he finally gave up after chapter five and watched an 11
2884680	2889160	hour movie that was all the cut scenes after chapter five.
2889160	2892400	And I'm like, geez, I got a lot to go.
2892640	2895360	So anyway, that was my gaming week.
2895680	2899000	So, uh, let's get into some gaming news now.
2899000	2900480	I think, uh, we're ready for that.
2900760	2904320	Uh, as far as show schedule, uh, because usually we do housekeeping here too.
2904600	2906280	Uh, we should be here.
2906280	2908280	I don't think we're missing any shows for the holidays.
2908680	2912880	The next show we'll be missing is on January 19th, which is a Martin Luther
2912880	2913520	King weekend.
2913520	2917760	We won't be here live that night, but we should be taped in one way or another.
2917760	2919200	We may actually go live earlier in the day.
2919200	2920720	I think we were looking at doing that potentially.
2920720	2922800	So yes, my kids are very excited.
2923040	2923600	Oh boy.
2924120	2926080	So are they going to behave for three hours?
2926120	2926440	Nope.
2926720	2927240	Oh boy.
2927280	2929280	I mean, I'm just saying that because nope.
2930640	2931040	All right.
2931840	2933360	Anyhow, let's move on.
2933360	2936840	Let's get into, uh, other gaming news and what's going on in the gaming world.
2936840	2938240	It wasn't just the game awards, right?
2938240	2938680	The stuff, right?
2938680	2940880	They had the state of play this week as well.
2940880	2945760	So, um, basically some of the announcements we knew were coming.
2945760	2950960	So, uh, nothing too, um, surprising with the resident evil three remake
2950960	2954120	announcements coming out in PlayStation four, April 3rd.
2954640	2959880	Uh, we've got the kingdom hearts three DLC expansion with new characters.
2959960	2965400	Uh, that's coming out on the 23rd of January and then untitled goose game is
2965400	2970360	going to be coming to PlayStation four on December 17th, so right around the corner
2970720	2975920	dreams, which they recently pulled the early access beta version that you could
2975920	2981320	purchase a thing was last week and I missed out on that, but the full game will
2981320	2983160	be coming out on February 14th.
2983560	2987680	So that's something that was announced spell break a new battle royale game.
2987800	2993400	Um, they said combining role playing and magic combat is starting a closed beta.
2993800	2999120	Uh, they showed off some VR stuff, a paper beast, and then there was a new
2999120	3004880	predator game coming out, April 24th, and apparently from Square Enix and
3004880	3010360	platinum Babylon's fall, uh, it's a new action game that mixes, uh, was it
3010360	3016520	medieval and fancy it's sci-fi and then subliminal, which is a perspective
3016680	3020560	bending physics game that they've got coming on the PlayStation four.
3020880	3025400	And then last but not least, um, they showed a little bit of, uh, goes to
3025400	3029440	shoe SEMA, which they showed a longer trailer during the game awards for that.
3030000	3033080	Um, but yeah, so that's basically everything in it's announced.
3033080	3037600	So, um, very interested to see when dreams comes out.
3037600	3039760	Cause I think that's going to be a game that catches a lot of people off guard.
3039800	3042360	Yeah, I definitely want to check out dreams when it's officially out.
3042360	3046160	That's already, I think maybe a possible game of the year contender for next year.
3046400	3048600	Maybe just if the early buzz is any indication.
3048600	3050000	I mean, uh, it looks interesting.
3050040	3050800	Yeah, it really does.
3050800	3052040	So I'm, I'm all about that.
3052080	3055200	The, um, what was the battle royale that was RPG kind of base?
3055240	3057120	That's a spellbreak spellbreak.
3057160	3057320	Yeah.
3057320	3058360	That sounds really interesting too.
3058400	3062200	So, um, yeah, you battle, right?
3062200	3064120	The battle royale genre is just not going away.
3064360	3066000	I know we have another story coming up a little later.
3066000	3066320	Yes.
3066320	3068600	Another, yes, that, that one looked interesting.
3068600	3068880	Yeah.
3068880	3071920	So there's this, uh, no shortage of games there, although, uh, it
3071920	3073280	didn't make the show world tonight.
3073280	3076120	And I don't think this game was battle royale per se, but I
3076120	3079840	know I was looking at our discord over at vognetwork.com slash discord.
3079840	3083560	And I saw that there was, um, uh, a comment about this and I
3083560	3084360	thought it was interesting.
3084360	3086800	It's a game that, uh, planetside arena.
3086800	3087320	That was it.
3087600	3092160	It just like, it just came out in early access and like September and they've
3092160	3094480	already announced it's closing in January.
3094680	3099120	And there's a comment here, uh, a quote from the article, apparently the month
3099120	3101720	that debuted, it had 474 players.
3101920	3104320	And as of right now, when somebody was writing the article, there were
3104320	3105600	three people playing the game.
3105640	3113160	That was like the, um, what was that one that was by, um, I think I did twisted
3113160	3117680	metal, um, I don't remember his name, but like there was, remember that one battle
3117680	3120480	royale game that was like an eighties kind of throwback thing.
3120480	3124040	And then they had like bikes and stuff in there.
3124040	3127440	Like it was, it was something that came out around E3 and then just
3127440	3128840	like died in like two months.
3129240	3131760	It was like the, the sketchbook looking thing, right?
3131800	3132760	No, no, no, no, no, not that.
3132760	3133800	But he did that as well.
3134120	3134720	David Jeff.
3134720	3134880	Yeah.
3134880	3135440	Did that.
3135480	3138360	Um, he did that game, but then there was another one.
3138400	3138960	No, no, no.
3138960	3139400	I'm sorry.
3139400	3141840	I'm confusing David Jeff with, um, not him.
3141920	3143840	Um, God damn it.
3144760	3145760	The guy that did gears.
3145840	3148360	Um, Oh, cliffy cliffy V.
3148360	3148720	Yes.
3148760	3154920	Uh, so his game, yeah, it's not David Jaffe, but his game that was that weird,
3154920	3157800	like, I don't remember the hell is called now, but it was some battle
3157800	3161640	royale game that came out around the time that, you know, Fortnite was
3161640	3165720	doing really well and it just didn't take off like it died within two
3165720	3168520	months in the early access law breakers.
3168560	3169160	Yes.
3169160	3169600	That's it.
3169600	3170320	Start to Tetsuya.
3170320	3170760	That was it.
3170760	3171400	No, no, no.
3171400	3172680	That was another one too.
3172680	3174680	But there was law breakers died too.
3174680	3179320	That was, that was more of a hero shooter game that, um, the battle
3179320	3182440	royale one I'm thinking though, was it wasn't law breakers.
3182440	3184840	It was, um, God damn it.
3184840	3185680	Now we have to look it up.
3186840	3189920	Uh, but yeah, quest buster and chat says that from what I gathered planet
3189960	3191840	side arena was nothing the fans asked for.
3191840	3193280	They wanted planet side three.
3193320	3194600	Yeah, there's that.
3194760	3197960	Uh, Shane's mentioning the David Jaffe game was drawn to death.
3198360	3198880	No, no, no.
3198920	3199760	Not that one either.
3199840	3202760	That was another, that's another game that was PlayStation.
3202800	3205840	I don't think that lasted very long either, but that had the life
3205840	3207000	of about a year and a half probably.
3207080	3207520	It was.
3207520	3208480	Yeah, it was.
3208520	3209440	That one was all right.
3209440	3211680	It, um, that had an interesting heights.
3211680	3212200	Many people.
3212200	3212640	Thank you.
3212640	3212920	Yes.
3212920	3213600	Radical heights.
3213600	3214200	That's the one.
3214200	3214600	Yes.
3214920	3215320	There you go.
3215560	3215880	All right.
3215880	3216360	You got it.
3216800	3218560	Anyway, finally got there.
3219040	3219560	All right.
3219560	3222680	Well, uh, yeah, so battle royale, I mean, all these developers kind of
3222680	3225680	want to hit on that Fortnite money, but you know, some, some are doing
3225680	3227320	well, but some not so well.
3227320	3228280	So, um, yeah.
3228880	3231480	Anyway, um, delayed games.
3231520	3234200	So, you know, sometimes when we would hear about game delays,
3234200	3235240	we'd be really bummed out.
3235240	3238040	But I think as we've learned over the years, game delays are often
3238040	3240200	good news because that means the game is not gonna be garbage.
3240240	3240480	Yes.
3240480	3243680	Because we've seen some of the games that have hurried to get out on
3243680	3246000	time and they've not turned out well.
3246400	3246960	Andromeda.
3247480	3250840	Oh, speaking of which I was going to mention, you, you know, one of
3250840	3255000	those games that we think about Anthem like that, I saw it down the
3255000	3258520	five bucks for the collector's edition.
3258680	3260760	$5.
3260760	3261160	Not surprised.
3261160	3263760	I'm pretty sure I've seen it at $5 as well.
3263800	3266960	Like I think at target on their little backside of the shelf, that's
3266960	3267560	ridiculous.
3267560	3268480	I saw it for five bucks.
3268480	3268760	Yeah.
3268840	3270720	So yeah.
3270800	3271120	Anyway.
3271320	3274320	Uh, but what's been delays that hopefully they can sell it for more
3274320	3278880	than $5, uh, it was a final fantasy crystal chronicles has been, uh,
3278880	3279840	there was, yeah, right.
3279880	3280600	That is coming.
3280640	3282160	Uh, and there was a series of tweets.
3282200	3285040	Um, then they said, uh, since announcing final fantasy crystal
3285040	3287680	chronicles, we've received so many positive messages filled with
3287680	3290120	encouragement, but today we're announcing the release date for the
3290120	3292240	game is being moved to summer 2020.
3292440	3295280	We made the decision to adjust the release date to allow the development
3295280	3297880	team some extra time to make final adjustments to the game, to make the
3297880	3299280	best experience possible.
3299600	3302800	Uh, final fantasy crystal chronicles remastered is coming to PS four,
3302840	3305160	Nintendo switch, iOS, and Android devices.
3305360	3307880	You'll be able to play online with your friends and transfer your save
3307880	3312840	file across all four platforms when the game launches in summer 2020.
3312840	3316400	So, and they put out a new trailer, uh, just to remind you that it is still
3316400	3316880	coming.
3317120	3318160	Uh, I remember.
3318200	3318440	Okay.
3318440	3320880	So that was when I lived with you.
3321160	3323920	We had the game cube with the game boy advanced adapters.
3323920	3325800	Cause that was where Chris Chronicles originally was.
3326120	3328320	I remember we played some of that and that game was fun.
3328760	3331960	Not with me, but that may have been shame.
3331960	3333440	Maybe, or some people would come over.
3333440	3334160	We would play that.
3334200	3336280	I think I was dating a guy at the time that had it too.
3336280	3337480	And we were playing through that a little bit.
3337480	3339240	So yeah, I don't think I've ever played that game.
3339520	3339960	Really?
3340240	3343240	No, cause there was, I remember the one, I remember selling the one that
3343240	3347720	was on the Wii and DS that had interconnectivity that way too.
3347960	3348280	Hmm.
3349640	3352680	Uh, Shane's and chat saying this delay made me sad.
3352680	3355640	I was hoping to hold the chalice and keep it from everyone else next month.
3355920	3358560	But it's, this is the good news because you want it to work.
3358560	3361720	You want to be successful and not buggy and crashy and all that stuff.
3361960	3363960	Especially when they're talking, you don't want to hold the chalice and have
3363960	3365560	that child's corrupt your character save.
3365560	3367560	And then yes, you don't want that to happen.
3367560	3370320	So it's probably for the best that this was delayed a little bit.
3370400	3373760	So anyhow, moving on dark soccer, there was a pretty big event this weekend
3373760	3376200	in a game that I don't think any of the three of us play regularly.
3376400	3377760	Nope, but I thought it was cool.
3378000	3380320	So, uh, Fortnite had some fun stuff happen.
3380720	3385480	Basically, uh, JJ Abrams showed up in the millennium Falcon in game.
3386120	3390680	And a big screen fell from the sky and showed a clip of rise of Skywalker.
3391400	3393160	So that's cool.
3393440	3395560	And then after that, guess what happened next?
3396440	3398960	The world went back to being a black hole and disappeared.
3398960	3402360	Everyone got lightsabers and then it went to being a black hole.
3403440	3407440	And you also now have a Rey and Finn skins in the game.
3408000	3413560	And, um, but yeah, so I want to go and see if I can just find like
3413560	3415480	clips of the recording or whatever.
3415680	3417200	Oh, it's just everywhere on YouTube.
3417200	3417680	I'm sure.
3417680	3418680	I just haven't bothered.
3418720	3421160	So, um, but yeah, advertised on Twitch pretty heavily too.
3421160	3424200	They've got like all kinds of shit all over Fortnite anyway, now
3424200	3426200	like skins and themes and stuff.
3426760	3428640	But yeah, so basically.
3429600	3433720	JJ Abrams flew in in the millennium Falcon and showed some movies.
3434080	3435680	Uh, Bobby Black Wolf is pointing out.
3435680	3437680	This is a lot like what some VR things do.
3437680	3440760	Altspace VR and VR chat have done this type of stuff before.
3441040	3441240	Yeah.
3441240	3444480	It's interesting that it's, it's in a game like Fortnite, which most of us
3444480	3448040	think of as a shooty shooter, battle royale, Minecraft meets guns.
3448080	3448720	Popular.
3448720	3451760	And yeah, I think because of its popularity, but yeah, I mean, this
3451760	3456280	type of thing is like the type of thing in like second life or PlayStation home.
3456440	3459840	Remember when you could visit the virtual PlayStation booth and PlayStation
3459840	3464000	home and they would show like PlayStation trailers and stuff like that was a thing.
3464000	3465600	But I think let's be real.
3465640	3469840	There's millions more people in Fortnite than there ever was in PlayStation home.
3469880	3472640	They also had though, as an added bonus.
3472640	3476880	So it's Ben, Ben Schwartz was, um, there as one of the storm
3476880	3479320	troopers and goofing around.
3479360	3479760	Oh, really?
3479760	3484520	So another skin in here is the Sith trooper and you get a first
3484520	3488040	order tie fighter are some other things that are new in game.
3488040	3488280	Oh yeah.
3488280	3488800	The gliders.
3489320	3489600	Yeah.
3489600	3490480	That looked pretty cool.
3490560	3492880	Um, I watched the clip and it was lame.
3493440	3494360	What was the clip?
3494560	3500040	The clip was basically it's, it was, uh, Rey Finn and I remember the other dude.
3500080	3500480	Po.
3500640	3500960	Po.
3500960	3501200	Yes.
3501200	3501520	Thank you.
3501520	3503720	And they were, don't you ever forget his name.
3504280	3505160	I would die for him.
3505280	3505880	I'm sorry.
3505880	3506800	I remember the face.
3506800	3507560	It's not the name.
3507600	3507880	Okay.
3507920	3508840	It's distracting.
3508840	3514760	So, um, so anyways, so they break into what looks to be a ship of some sort and
3514760	3517520	they're running through, they're shooting storm troopers and then these storm
3517520	3522800	troopers confront them and Rey does her Jedi mind trick to like tell them, Hey,
3522800	3523840	we're supposed to be here.
3523840	3525320	And they're like, yeah, they're supposed to be there.
3525480	3526080	And that was it.
3526080	3527280	It was a really short clip.
3527360	3531200	It had no context into anything else other than, yeah, she did a Jedi mind
3531240	3531440	trick.
3531440	3531800	Cool.
3531880	3533920	Well, they're not going to spoil the goddamn movie.
3533920	3535000	I mean, you know, it was just,
3535320	3537840	I wanted to see the clip with Darth Jar Jar.
3537840	3541200	That was one of the options that they had them fans vote on and everyone should
3541200	3542600	have voted for Darth Jar Jar.
3542840	3543240	Damn it.
3544200	3547480	Uh, Sia Tabiri in chat says, but do you remember Po's last name?
3547800	3548560	Dameron.
3548880	3549720	Don't fight me.
3551200	3551680	Anyway.
3552200	3556160	Uh, speaking of, um, I forgot to mention this about the game awards and I think
3556160	3560000	this is a travesty that I would forget to mention this, but, um, Akumi Nakamura,
3560560	3562240	uh, showing up to present an award.
3562480	3563360	Love her.
3563480	3566440	Uh, my favorite thing was the whole, like, uh, what did she say?
3566440	3568200	She said, please bear with my English.
3568200	3569960	She goes, please bear with bear.
3570000	3573880	And she's just like, I, I was, I knew at that point I would take a bullet
3573880	3575280	for her cause she's incredible.
3575560	3579760	I, it's, and what it is y'all is the enthusiasm about video games and the
3579760	3582160	games industry, like games should be fun.
3582320	3586080	And when you see somebody like her on stage, she is having the time of her
3586080	3589120	life, she's having fun and that fun is infectious.
3589160	3591000	And that's, that's great.
3591280	3593200	You know, star Wars should be fun.
3593360	3594600	Fortnite should be fun.
3594600	3595560	Games are fun.
3595840	3599720	Anyway, I just want to make sure I, uh, got that out at some point.
3600080	3601080	All right, let's move on.
3601120	3604000	Uh, let's talk about battle royale fun.
3604000	3604880	Yes, this is more fun.
3604880	3605640	This is awesome.
3605640	3608800	So I did get to check out, um, the video showing this.
3608800	3614360	So Forza Horizon 4 is getting a new 72 car battle royale mode.
3614360	3616880	And you might be thinking, well, how the hell is that going to work?
3617120	3620680	So it's this new mode called the eliminator and the way it starts
3620680	3624120	off, you're in the map and you basically have 72 final round and guts.
3625880	3627120	Anyway, that's the agrocrag.
3627240	3628560	Yeah, that was the eliminator.
3628560	3630320	What kid's game show was the eliminator in?
3630320	3631760	Or am I thinking of the Illuminati?
3631840	3633400	Maybe the eliminator.
3633400	3635960	Um, is that like the Illuminati nadir?
3636560	3637160	What is that?
3637160	3640840	American gladiators, American gladiators, the, the, yeah.
3641120	3643440	You know, the American gladiators.
3643640	3645400	And for some reason I got American gladiators just
3645440	3646960	confused with Nickelodeon guts.
3647240	3651640	I mean, cause guts is sort of like a spin off American gladiators without
3651640	3655080	gladiators punching the kids because they did have American gladiator kids,
3655400	3658280	which I was always like, they were always so gentle with them.
3658280	3661520	But like at the same time, I'm like, dude, just take them out.
3661640	3665960	Like you got your foam, you know, your giant Q tips of death.
3665960	3667640	Just knock that kid on his ass.
3667640	3670920	Imagine the show now where it's just like the American gladiators
3670920	3672160	kick the shit out of children.
3673160	3675880	And for some reason, I think this is so funny.
3675880	3677720	I don't know what, although it's probably not.
3677720	3679600	And everyone's like, how dare you laugh at that?
3679600	3681000	But it's, it's funny.
3681880	3682240	Come on.
3682400	3687600	But we, the kids are the type that like scream during movies and, uh,
3687640	3691120	you know, are really annoying in restaurants and those types of kids.
3691400	3691760	Yes.
3691760	3695640	The ones that have this like complex where they think they're so indestructible
3695640	3699200	and then you just, you put them up against Blaze and then Blaze just
3699240	3700480	beats the shit out of them.
3700480	3702520	Just knocks their fucking ass down.
3702560	3705080	Any American gladiators to come back? I know they had a thought.
3705080	3705680	They did.
3705680	3706240	They did.
3706240	3708520	That was almost like 10 years ago at this point,
3708600	3712920	that revival that was like what Hulk Hogan and Leila Ali was the,
3713080	3715520	they were the hosts, right? And they had, uh,
3716160	3720080	they had the guy that won the first season came back and he was like the rubber
3720080	3722200	band. I don't remember what the fuck his name was, but he could,
3722400	3727080	that wall thing, he just fly up that goddamn wall. So yeah, we need a new,
3727120	3728720	like we need a new, new American laddiers.
3728840	3731840	But here's the thing, if you're not going to be, the thing is the,
3731880	3734640	the modern American gladiators, like kind of, they kind of,
3734880	3739320	they try to keep it like half cheesy, but half modernize it. No, no, no, no, no,
3739320	3740840	no, no, no, no, no, no, no, 100% cheesy,
3740840	3745840	100% cheesy outfits that fucking like shine and like,
3746360	3750800	you know, and if it's not spandex and it's not sequence, it was like sequence,
3750840	3755280	sequence, sequence on the men and the women. Okay.
3755760	3759280	All of it. And just, just have that, you know, was,
3759640	3761000	I don't remember they used to call it with,
3761120	3764560	was it the gauntlet or whatever with the giant like nerf things that they would
3764560	3768640	like be shooting? Yes. Yes. And you know what we need, uh, you know,
3768640	3771160	cause they always would feature, you know, it'd be the men's competition,
3771160	3772120	the women's competition,
3772360	3777360	but we also need the gender fucking competition that's drag queens as,
3778560	3782560	um, competitors and uh, the gladiators because let's be real,
3782680	3786480	American gladiators are basically drag queens without the lip syncing.
3788640	3790000	They need the, they category.
3791800	3793800	No, of course. But you know,
3795680	3797480	the, the non gender binary,
3797520	3800480	I just think right now it's like they've kind of replaced that with like this
3800560	3803600	stupid American ninja warrior bullshit. And
3805400	3807400	it's, that shit is a real challenge though.
3807600	3811880	I understand that, but it's not as cheesy and entertaining as like, you know,
3812480	3815960	the shit that we see. Like for example, I, I,
3815960	3820560	I want to say it was Akuma JP. It may have not been somebody on my Twitter,
3820760	3824440	posted a video of like a Japanese game show where they had this dude inside of a
3824440	3829200	balloon and they were having him do different feats of strength that required
3829200	3830280	him not to pop the balloon.
3830280	3833000	And every time he failed because it's a giant balloon, like they,
3833160	3836800	they want him to jump, you know, do the high jump or whatever.
3836800	3838320	And it's just like he couldn't do it,
3838320	3841080	but it was hilarious because it looked ridiculous.
3841120	3842640	That's the kind of TV I want to watch.
3842680	3846200	Absolutely. Anyway, we're, we're, we're back to Forza.
3849200	3853480	Yes. I love that. And I loved it when they did the really bad dubs. You know,
3853480	3857000	it's what they call the most extreme elimination challenge.
3857800	3860320	I miss that show so much. I love that show.
3860360	3863760	But seriously, hear me out here. American gladiators, but it's drag queens.
3863960	3868120	Mimi, I'm first clearly pick you up and drag.
3868520	3870480	American gladiators, American drag gladiators,
3873080	3876520	copyright copyright, patent pending trademark, uh,
3876560	3880960	property of orange Andreo. All right. Sorry. So, uh, the eliminator,
3880960	3885080	so way it works is there's 72 players that are on a map. It has, you know,
3885080	3888920	of course the, the ring of death that's out there. Um,
3888960	3892880	so what happens is you're driving around and you start as like a level one car
3893080	3896720	that's like a piece of shit car and you challenge other players.
3896760	3898760	So when you get close to them, you can do a one-on-one challenge.
3898760	3899200	And what it is,
3899200	3902080	it gives you a point to point race that whoever gets to the end of the race,
3902400	3904120	you get to trade their car.
3904160	3907040	You get to take their car if it's a higher level or you can upgrade your own.
3907320	3910200	So you do that until you get to like level 10,
3910200	3915160	once it gets all the way down to as small of an area as possible, then,
3915720	3920680	um, you do a last point to point race and whoever gets to that point wins.
3920720	3922080	But throughout the entire thing,
3922080	3925640	it's just all these point to point races within the circle. Um,
3925720	3928640	it looked really cool. It was like a flash tournament, almost like,
3928640	3932000	just like a really fast tournament in a way. Sort of. Yeah. It's just,
3932000	3935240	it's kind of, it's kind of crazy and just the way they had it.
3935560	3938600	And the other way you can get cars too, is they have like these pickups,
3938600	3942400	like almost like drops that you can run into and then you get a vehicle pickup.
3942720	3946200	But, um, so that's one way to do it. But then you can also, you know,
3946280	3949400	challenge other players for their cars or upgrade your own if they have like a
3949440	3951960	shittier car than you. I'm into it. It sounds really fun. I'll check it.
3951960	3955880	I have four surprise and four. Yeah. I need to play pass and the retail one.
3955880	3958480	So I need to check it out. Yeah. So it's a free thing, right?
3958480	3962600	It is a free upgrade. So yeah. Nice. We'll have to try that out at some point.
3962640	3964600	I know Bobby was talking about wanting to play it too. So maybe,
3964760	3968720	maybe that's a thing we can do on VOG at some point later in the next week or
3968720	3972240	so. Yeah. Uh, anyway, heading over for some other announcements that came out
3972240	3974120	this week. So Nintendo did have some announcements,
3974120	3976600	even if they didn't make any first party announcements at the game awards,
3976600	3981360	but, uh, they did have their own little, um, uh, indie announcement reel.
3981360	3984520	They did an indie world, basically. So it's kind of like, think like a direct,
3984520	3986240	but it was all about like indie stuff. Yeah. Uh,
3986240	3989120	but we did get some pretty big titles that were dropped here. Uh, for example,
3989120	3993040	that was dropped or that was launched on the day of the, um, uh,
3993840	3995880	press thing or the, the video, uh,
3995920	3998480	the talus principle deluxe edition came out for steam.
3998480	4002760	So that was out and Dauntless came out. I'm sorry. Yes. On switch. My bad.
4002760	4006160	The other S thing. Uh, so both of those came out on switch, uh,
4006200	4009920	with the Nintendo indie world. Uh, so that's pretty cool. Um,
4009920	4012920	but then there was also other things that were shown. So, um,
4012960	4016280	axiom verge two was announced. I don't think I played the first,
4016280	4019160	I have the first one. I haven't played it yet. It's basically,
4019160	4020600	it's like super Metroid,
4020600	4023400	but like kind of goes a very different direction with like the hacking and
4023400	4027680	stuff. And like, it's all one guy. Like it's like produced by,
4027680	4031280	directed by soundtrack by starred in. It's like the original Halloween,
4031920	4034080	you know how like John Carpenter actually did that music and the original
4034080	4036040	Halloween. It's like, yeah, iconic. So that's,
4036080	4037640	that's basically what axiom verge is.
4037760	4042560	So axiom verge two is on its way in fall of 2020. So it's still a ways out,
4042560	4046120	but, um, yeah, I can be technically the first one. Yes, exactly. Uh,
4046120	4049040	they also kind of give an update on streets or age four and it's coming out in
4049040	4052040	the first half of 2020. And I know some people are very excited for that game as
4052040	4054880	well. Um, I don't have time to talk about everything, but, uh,
4054920	4058040	definitely check out some of those other games that were, uh, uh,
4058240	4061680	announced as part of indie world. I know I'm looking forward to axiom verge two,
4061880	4064240	uh, maybe sports story, something you might. Yeah.
4064400	4067000	Golf story here is really good. It's sports story.
4067040	4068880	I know I'm talking about the first one. Oh, right.
4068880	4072920	It's creators of golf story. It was the first one in that I hear it was pretty
4072920	4074600	good. Um, sports story.
4074600	4078120	I do want to check out as well because it sounded pretty awesome. Uh,
4078120	4082280	skate bird was another developer that I follow on Twitter. Uh, it looks awesome.
4082280	4086480	It's like Tony Hawk with a tiny little bird. It says super cute. And, um,
4086760	4091240	just for the name itself, murder by numbers. Yeah.
4091800	4092960	That sounded interesting as well. Well,
4092960	4095960	if we're going to go for games with a great title, how about boyfriend dungeon?
4096960	4100760	The other one is boyfriend dungeon. It's a dating SIM dungeon crawler.
4101280	4104880	So I don't know, dark Sakura, I know you like your crazy dating Sims,
4104920	4106080	so maybe this will be something.
4106240	4108640	Have you ever wanted to imprison boyfriends in the dungeon?
4108640	4110920	I guess that's what this is about. I don't know. Um,
4110960	4114080	but you basically you make precious memories with different loves and you use
4114080	4117920	your combat styles to clear out monsters and uncover the dungeon secrets.
4119160	4121240	I, that doesn't mean I'm lucky them in dungeons.
4122240	4124840	You might be saving them or something. I don't know.
4125200	4127760	Dude. So Linda trust. Sure.
4129200	4133880	Helpless little boys. I like that. All right. So anyway, lots of, uh, indies.
4133880	4137160	And you know, obviously the switch E-shop has tons and tons and tons of
4137160	4138520	independent things on it.
4138520	4141600	And that's really what's kind of bolstered that and, uh,
4141640	4145080	put it above as far as like how many games are available on it from where even
4145080	4148560	we, you is that. So that was, um, yeah, that's great. So, all right,
4148560	4149080	let's move on.
4149080	4151320	We have more stories for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week.
4151320	4152920	Dark Sakura, what do you have for us next?
4153200	4156520	Uh, well, some, uh, GameStop news there,
4156520	4161120	as we sometimes call it the evil G. Um, well,
4161160	4163760	they look like they were doing okay. And then guess what happened?
4165720	4170640	No one's really surprised though. Their, um, uh, revenue,
4171040	4171440	uh, sorry,
4171440	4175440	currency adjusted revenue in the third quarter dropped 24.7%
4176440	4180360	percent. Um, and their hardware sales,
4181360	4186240	uh, went over 45%. Software was cut by a third and
4186240	4191120	accessories and pre-owned were down by 13% each for the
4191120	4193360	whole period. Um,
4195480	4200560	and as far as, you know, in general, they are really,
4200560	4203640	really, really just going down. Um,
4204640	4208880	they, they're, uh, suffering from some of the, uh,
4208920	4211920	release, uh, you know, cause now most of their stuff is toys.
4212360	4214760	They're really suffering from some releases of some, uh,
4214800	4219600	relevant franchises is where part of this is going into. But, uh,
4220640	4223320	the, um, the CEO, uh,
4223360	4228320	George Sherman is saying that their more important console business
4228320	4233120	does not look hopeful. And I'll go ahead and read his exact
4233120	4233960	quote.
4234120	4238360	The unprecedented decline in the new hardware sales seen across the market as
4238360	4242120	the current generation of gaming consoles reach the end of their life cycle and
4242120	4247120	consumers delay their spending and anticipation of new hardware releases was
4247200	4248880	their excuse.
4249840	4253520	So it sounds like 2020 might be very much a make or break year for GameStop
4253520	4256520	because of the new consoles being released. You know, um,
4256560	4259280	that's going to be some money for them as these consoles are released.
4259280	4261240	They'll get their share as they sell these consoles.
4261240	4264280	But who knows how many of those consoles are really going to be sold at a place
4264280	4265480	like Amazon and so forth.
4265480	4269000	They were projected to have a profit of $11 a share,
4269000	4273240	but it actually dropped down by 40. It's not $11, sorry,
4273280	4277800	11 cents a share. And instead they actually dropped down 49 cents a share.
4278000	4278840	Yikes.
4278840	4280720	That's pretty crazy. And I mean,
4280720	4283000	and the reason why I bring this up and everyone's like, Oh,
4283000	4285480	financial business, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
4285880	4290600	When you're looking at your retailers and also a mark of where trends are going
4290640	4294920	in the distribution of gaming related
4294920	4299680	services to have kind of like a mainstay of this falling
4299680	4303000	behind now to either like the department ish stores, you know,
4303000	4307000	like a target or a Walmart or a regular department store.
4307480	4310880	And then we also have a little bit more of a rise of the independent boutique.
4311480	4313440	Have you noticed that a little bit? Yeah,
4313640	4317440	that's where your used market is going to,
4317440	4320520	or those independent boutiques. And then, you know,
4320520	4323160	cause we have like the game trader here is like supposed to be doing like
4323200	4325520	pretty, pretty damn good. And you know,
4325560	4329600	although we did lose our dimples because dimples are the place to really get
4329600	4333640	games. Right. Didn't the family kind of decide to stop though? Yeah, I guess.
4333640	4336200	Part of it was, it's not just them wanting to stop.
4336200	4339280	I think the business side of it was great. Did you hear about Percos by the way?
4339920	4343080	Are they closing too? Oh no, Perry Perry's. Perry's is doing, but it's,
4343200	4346160	but it looks like they're going to reopen under new management. Oh, that's cool.
4346360	4348840	And I've never got to go there. But anyway, back to, you know,
4349640	4352880	I almost made the joke. Well, is it not the original Perry's anymore?
4353880	4355520	It would be not the original Perry's,
4355920	4359440	but if it keeps the name and runs everything the same and maybe,
4360080	4364240	anyway, so back to GameStop, um, they, um,
4364520	4369160	actually like even had a couple of, uh, investor, uh,
4369200	4374200	activists were trying to get GameStop to buy back off,
4374640	4378400	uh, their stock so that at least the investors would make back a little bit of
4378400	4382880	money on, you know, what they've spent on it. But yeah, they're,
4382880	4386720	they're not looking to do very good. And the investors are basically saying,
4387080	4390320	yeah, GameStop isn't going to be able to buy its way out. It's gonna,
4391320	4393680	it's just gonna probably crash and burn.
4393680	4395600	The next year is going to be the deciding factor.
4396040	4401040	So right now GameStop stock as of today, so today's what, the 15th?
4401080	4404640	Yeah. Um, is $5 and 45 cents.
4405640	4409400	To do a little bit of a, of a comparison, um,
4410040	4413200	Funko is at $15.15.
4413440	4418440	Sony's at $67.57. Disney is at $146.38 per share.
4419360	4423200	Microsoft's at $154.53 per share. So I'm just saying,
4423320	4424680	but those aren't retail businesses either.
4424720	4429720	No, but I'm saying to give it a view versus successful companies and then about
4431000	4432200	where the scale is.
4433000	4434520	GameStop is really heading to,
4434600	4437480	like I think when JC Penney closed out of business,
4437480	4439680	their stock was going for like a dollar or something.
4439840	4442600	Yeah. So not all JC Penney's are closed either.
4442600	4444360	They did some type of turnaround with them.
4444640	4446200	Well, and did you hear Toys R Us is coming back?
4446400	4450440	Yeah. The retail thing is so fascinating to me because, you know,
4450440	4452840	they say the Amazon's killing all of these businesses,
4452840	4454640	which I understand is the whole like, you know,
4454640	4458040	the convenience or whatever of having these delivered to your door and going
4458040	4461560	online and not having to worry about pressures, salespeople and all that stuff,
4461600	4464720	you know. But then what's interesting is that where does Amazon go next?
4464720	4467480	Now they're opening retail stores like, you know, right?
4467560	4470440	Like their big grocery thing where you just,
4470520	4473720	you just take it like you stole it off the shelf, right?
4474040	4475480	There's like no checkers or anything, right?
4475480	4477600	So it's like Amazon's pushing into the retail space.
4477600	4481600	And I've heard things about Amazon building bookstores. Isn't that ironic?
4481960	4482600	So it's just,
4482600	4487280	it's interesting how that stuff is kind of like circling around and back another
4487280	4491160	company actually that, no, nevermind. That's, that's old stock report.
4491600	4495280	I was just going to double check like where some of the retailers are right now
4495280	4499320	as far as their prices. Um, but, uh, like
4500880	4503920	I, I don't know, maybe this is a, uh, okay.
4503920	4506280	Boomer type of thing, even though I'm gen X,
4506280	4510800	but like I don't like to buy clothes online. I mean, if it's, if it's like,
4510840	4512960	like this hoodie, I bought this hoodie online,
4512960	4516840	but that's because where am I going to find a fucking Atari hoodie with the wood
4516840	4519640	paneling in this? I'm not going to find that in a retail store. Right.
4519640	4522760	So like narrow things that I can really only find online, I'll do.
4522760	4525120	But like if I'm going to buy just like jeans and stuff,
4525120	4526680	I want to kind of like try them on and stuff.
4526680	4529400	Like you can't really do that online cause everything's different sizing with
4529400	4532360	the brands. Right. So I don't know. I'm just very like, I,
4532440	4535600	I hope closed stores don't all go away cause I like to be able to walk into a
4535600	4537520	store and try things on, you know?
4538120	4543120	So I did just a quick relaunch to double check some of these best buy. Okay.
4543120	4547320	Best buy stock right now is 84 roughly $84. Um,
4547960	4550760	just in some of these other ones, I mean like,
4551240	4556240	there are some out here that are like 41 cents.
4557720	4561800	I don't know how they're getting around that way, but like just some of the,
4561800	4565640	the electronics, you know, manufacturers right now there you've got,
4566280	4570880	I would probably say like a good average is going to be between like I'd say
4571040	4574960	eight and 20 although yeah, the best, the biggest one on here is best buy,
4575120	4577720	which they got over a big slump. Right. Well, you know,
4577720	4580800	and they say target is still doing very well in the face of all this stuff.
4580800	4583800	The target is thriving even though it looked like they were in trouble for a
4583800	4584200	little bit,
4584200	4587560	but they're really doing very well because I guess they've embraced a lot of the
4587560	4590560	whole, like, you know, bring it to your car if you order it online or whatever.
4590840	4594480	I target is always like that place where it's like, uh,
4594480	4596000	we just need this one small thing,
4596000	4598440	but let's go to target and buy a bunch of shit we don't need.
4598440	4602480	Like that it fulfills that even target now sell shirts. Yeah.
4602640	4607280	Say that like I came into target for one thing and left with everything or
4607280	4610560	something like this shirt. Yeah, exactly. Uh, let's see.
4610560	4612680	There was a comment in chat I wanted to read here, um,
4612720	4615000	especially cause I don't recognize the name. I like to hear from new people too.
4615280	4616640	Uh, here it is. Uh, Phoenix,
4616680	4621120	77 26 and chat says there are still lots of Indies though and talking about the
4621120	4624520	stores and in some sense that might be good for them though. I would not,
4624640	4628440	I would not like to see a whole lot of people lose their jobs. That's true.
4628440	4630400	As much as we might sit here and say, you know,
4630480	4634920	GameStop sucks and all this stuff. Uh, it's still a lot of people, any,
4634920	4638920	any bad decision that GameStop has made was not made by the hardworking people
4639080	4641200	making way too little money, uh,
4641200	4644560	working at the different mall stores and things of that nature. Um, you know,
4644560	4645080	it's, it's,
4645080	4647880	it's executives in a boardroom somewhere that make all the bonehead decisions,
4648040	4651120	but who's going to suffer, you know, if GameStop goes under,
4651120	4653840	it'll be all those people on the front line. So, you know,
4654240	4659240	you hope that something will come in to take the place of GameStop if they do go
4659240	4661920	under. So that way people have a place to work, right?
4662680	4666720	Well, and actually I made a friend at a GameStop. Um,
4666960	4670240	if Maddie's listening, hi Maddie, if not, you're probably working. Um,
4670240	4674880	but at any rate, um, it, when I was in there,
4674880	4675800	it was pretty dead.
4676000	4678800	I do notice the attitude of a lot of games. Cause you know,
4679240	4683080	we've all been into the GameStop when we've had that employee that's like the
4683080	4686600	drunk with power type that like tries to gatekeep everything. Right.
4686920	4689400	And it's like, how annoying is that? Right. But like,
4689400	4693880	I feel like I don't see those like somehow one thing GameStop's done right is
4693880	4695960	they've really weeded a lot of those people out. Cause yeah,
4695960	4698120	I would say anytime I have set foot in a game,
4698120	4700640	cause Alan still likes to be all like, let's go look at what's on sale.
4700640	4701560	Let's go look at the used games.
4701720	4703520	So I'll get dragged into a GameStop once in a while.
4703520	4705840	And I got to say most of the people that are working there these days,
4705840	4707040	pretty cool people.
4707200	4710960	Like I don't get a lot of that attitude that I used to get maybe five years ago,
4711120	4712520	once in a while. And it wasn't from every,
4712520	4716080	it would just be that one that you'd remember where you're like, ugh, you know,
4716320	4717160	so.
4717160	4718000	Well,
4718360	4722200	I have the notice and they've really kind of relaxed a lot of their,
4722560	4725200	their like policy for their employees. Have you noticed?
4726400	4727040	Like,
4727040	4730040	Oh yeah, they don't have to upsell you everything that they used to do.
4730120	4731240	Yeah, I think.
4733360	4734800	Well, I think when you're hurting the way they are,
4734800	4736600	it doesn't make sense to do something like that.
4736600	4738000	Cause it's just driving people away.
4738480	4740120	So I think they realize that that would,
4740120	4742160	that type of thing when it's like,
4742160	4745720	if you go into the store and then you get essentially harassed about,
4745840	4747840	did you preorder this? Did you put $5 on this?
4747840	4750000	Do you want the warranty package? You want all this?
4750160	4753280	That's what was driving people to go to Amazon in the first place.
4753280	4755880	Because on Amazon it was click done. I got it.
4756080	4757520	And I wasn't harassed about anything else.
4757520	4760080	And I think retailers finally wised up to that,
4760080	4762880	that that's why they were losing a lot of business to Amazon was that,
4762880	4764720	that pressure that people didn't want to deal with.
4765000	4767960	Yeah. So anyway, all right. A little bit of a tangent, but a good one.
4769200	4772360	Let's continue on and talk about not so great business decisions.
4773040	4773560	Loki.
4773920	4778040	Yes. This is not surprising coming from Activision,
4778040	4783040	but unfortunately it is something that we're finding to be the case nowadays.
4783400	4786520	So Activision with Call of Duty,
4786680	4791200	one of the things that players especially that are really into Call of Duty
4791200	4793920	and kind of take it more seriously is their kill death ratio.
4793920	4795920	And they want to know how well they're doing.
4796280	4801280	So previously I think what they had done is actually showed that in the,
4801320	4803320	the final score screen,
4803560	4806080	they kind of showed everybody's kill death ratio on there.
4807360	4812160	But apparently they said that that led to harassing or harassment from other
4812160	4815800	players if you didn't do so well. So you would think, okay,
4815800	4817680	the simple thing to do would then be,
4818520	4821280	let's just not let everybody see that kill death ratio.
4821320	4824720	How about only you get to see that kill death ratio? Well,
4825080	4828080	what ended up actually happening is they just took it out altogether.
4828840	4833840	But if you're interested to actually find out what your kill death ratio is on
4835200	4839440	the fly, you can pay for the $20 Mother Russia bundle,
4839680	4844680	which includes 10 pieces of cosmetics and also includes this time to die watch
4846160	4848240	that shows your kills and deaths.
4849920	4854920	So you have to pay $20 to bring back a feature that was taken out of the game by
4855560	4856400	Activision.
4856680	4861200	Or you could get a notepad and make notes yourself on, Oh, I killed that many.
4861200	4864720	I killed that guy. I killed that. And then I got killed. So you could take notes.
4866640	4871480	It is silly. No, it's really silly. Uh, so you know what you have to do, right?
4871480	4875600	You have to not buy it because voting with your wallet is the most important
4875600	4877320	thing. If you think this is stupid, then don't buy it.
4877560	4878800	But if you think this is really stupid,
4878800	4881120	don't buy the game that it's featured in because it is,
4881160	4882520	it is a little bit ridiculous. Like,
4882520	4886120	especially if the stat was there and then they removed it, you know,
4886120	4889280	only to put it back in some type of cosmetic that does seem really silly.
4889360	4890840	It, it is. And it's,
4890920	4894920	it's something that's like kind of integral to the game,
4894920	4897440	especially if you're playing, like you're trying to, you know,
4897440	4900560	take it a little bit seriously and be more competitive with it.
4900920	4904560	But the fact that they take it out because they want to make the game more
4904560	4907800	approachable for other players, which is stupid, just don't make it public.
4907800	4910240	Then you know that like, that's what you need to do.
4910480	4912760	But instead you just wanted to sell you.
4912800	4916320	You probably plan to do this where you sell it back because well,
4916440	4920960	it's coming out like two months after the game has been out. I mean,
4920960	4925160	come on. It was intentional. They planned on doing this. It's stupid.
4925360	4926200	It was a little silly,
4926600	4930200	but this isn't a series that I've super gotten into anyway.
4930440	4933520	And this doesn't exactly encourage me to start. Um,
4933520	4936480	a series I would have gotten into had it been released would have been, uh,
4936520	4939360	Hideo Kojima's take on silent Hills, which of course,
4939360	4942000	as we know now was all, uh, unveiled, uh, and,
4942000	4946560	and started with a demo called PT. Uh, and, uh, years later,
4946560	4950920	years later, people still obsessing about PT and with good reason,
4950920	4954720	it was great and finding new things about it. Um, and dark soccer,
4954720	4957520	this is the type of thing that is up your alley, actually this sort of hat.
4957520	4960480	Cause you've kind of done these things, uh, with mass effect and some other
4960480	4961000	games,
4961000	4965240	but basically what happened is that there was a camera mod that somebody was
4965240	4968200	able to install into PT price. Hasn't happened earlier. Yeah.
4968240	4970280	That was kind of the surprise for me too, is that, wow,
4970280	4973120	they just now got the camera mod in, but it might also be the fact, you know,
4973120	4976160	it's not PC it's console. So it takes a little longer. Uh,
4976160	4979520	it wasn't actually retail game either, but anyway, however they did it,
4979520	4981360	the camera modding trick finally happened.
4981600	4985200	And what they were able to do with it is that to actually see by having like the
4985200	4988760	character in a mirror and using the camera mod, long story short,
4989240	4993200	PT takes place from the first person perspective and you are actually playing as
4993200	4997600	Norman Reedus in that game. So when they use the camera trick, they found, Oh,
4997720	5002240	the, the player character is Norman Reedus completely clean up that mirror. Yeah.
5002680	5004880	In order to be able to do that. But that is it. Uh,
5004920	5007480	that came from a tweet from man fight dragon,
5007640	5011080	who I think was one of the moderate folks behind this saying just to put any
5011080	5013320	uncertainty finally to rest after all this time. Yes.
5013320	5017360	The guy you play as in PT is the same guy you see in the ending cinematic.
5017600	5021320	Not that there was any real doubt, but yeah, it's Norman Reedus the whole time.
5021400	5025600	So there you go. Um, some other things that have come out about PT recently, uh,
5025640	5030120	the ghost woman, Lisa, always behind you. Yeah. In the game.
5030360	5033640	That's something else that, uh, with the little camera trick found out, uh,
5033640	5036360	some cut content from the demo in the bathtub.
5036560	5040240	Apparently the tub has water in it at one point, but in another point it's empty.
5040400	5042880	But there was another scenario where the tub is full,
5043000	5047640	but there's a decapitated body in it. Great. Lovely. Merry Christmas.
5048320	5052080	That's my favorite. That's where I put my decapitated body.
5052600	5056560	It was in the tub. I filled with water and that head somewhere singing.
5056560	5059280	I ain't got nobody. All right. Anyway,
5060000	5064920	I just love that years later we're still upset and Kojima finally started and
5064920	5066160	released a new game.
5068040	5071120	Also starring Norman Reedus and we're still obsessed with PT,
5071320	5074480	but I understand. I totally get it. All right. Stupid.
5075120	5078160	Right behind you. I, I, I want,
5078240	5082720	I've never wanted a stupid rumor to be truer in my whole life than the one
5082720	5083720	where, uh,
5083760	5087760	Konami and Kojima have sat down and worked out Kojima productions taking Silent
5087760	5091320	Hill because I talked about this. Did that come up on the show? I don't know.
5091320	5093840	I remember saying, that's what Konami should do.
5093960	5097040	If Konami wanted to really win favor back, they're not doing anything with it.
5097360	5098760	Fucking get a cut,
5098800	5102440	give it to somebody who's going to do good with it and get a fucking cut of it
5102640	5103720	because it's your IP.
5103880	5107760	And so if that's true that they really did sit down with Kojima and hash out
5107760	5110800	their beef. And that's why they say, that's why, um,
5110920	5115680	that guy left because apparently he was pissed that Kojima was even talking to
5115680	5117520	Konami again. And so he left again.
5117560	5121680	This is all rumors and drama and probably made up because look where the rumors
5121680	5125760	and the game awards got us. But God damn, if it isn't fun to fantasize about that,
5125960	5127880	I mean, what's the, what's the best we got at Konami,
5128080	5132120	a new contour game that sucks ass. So a new metal gear game that sucks ass.
5132160	5136600	Kojima has been talking about doing a horror game.
5137000	5139560	So I don't know. I, we,
5139760	5143360	just because we want it to be true doesn't mean it is, but man,
5143520	5146480	it would be a holiday miracle if that ended up happening.
5146480	5150640	I would love that so much. So anyhow, moving on.
5151480	5154360	I was watching the video. All right. So well,
5154720	5159200	we're going to travel back to a simpler time before there were camera hacks and
5159200	5162400	things like this because everything was, there was a, yeah, cameras,
5162400	5163880	everything was a fricking Sprite.
5164240	5165640	It's the classic game of the week.
5165640	5166960	And every week you're on the program,
5166960	5170400	dark soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, Hey,
5170920	5173160	you should be checking this game out. You little brat.
5175000	5178920	I went back 30 years. Sometimes, sometimes it's a, it's a good game.
5178920	5182000	Sometimes it's a not so good game. I'm not sure. Good game.
5182120	5186520	I think this was a good game as well. It had a sequel. It was, it is. I,
5186520	5188960	and I remember playing this game, which is interesting because I didn't have this
5188960	5189600	system,
5189600	5194600	but I think this is also a game that got accused a lot of copying somebody
5194880	5199080	else's. Oh yeah, it's totally a clone, but it, it did very well for itself.
5199120	5201680	But anyway, with that dark soccer, what is the classic game of the week?
5201920	5203080	I picked new Topia.
5203960	5206160	New Topia came out, um,
5206360	5209680	on November 17th, 1989 in Japan.
5210520	5214920	And, uh, it had a us releases that came out in 1990.
5215520	5217600	And so basically the game,
5217760	5222240	it really plays a lot like the first legend of Zelda.
5223240	5227720	Graphically a bit better. Um, but it came out for the PC engine,
5227720	5229600	also known as the turbo graphics 16.
5230080	5235080	It did get a release for virtual console for Wii in 2007 and in Japan for Wii U
5236120	5237760	on April 16th, 2014.
5237760	5242560	And we released some PlayStation network in Japan in 2010 and North America,
5242560	5243400	2011.
5243720	5248480	So basically you're in a land called new Topia and this demon called dearth
5248520	5253280	captured princess Aurora and stolen eight ancient medallions.
5253480	5257280	They contain the wisdom to seal away the demon.
5257960	5260040	Sound familiar? Um,
5260160	5265160	so you have to play as a protagonist named Josetta to retrieve the medallions,
5265360	5269200	defeat the demon and rescue the princess and save the land.
5269680	5274680	It is basically a legend of Zelda clone in almost every possible way.
5276200	5278880	It did of course make some improvements, but of course, you know,
5278880	5281920	graphically it's a little bit better, you know, better.
5282320	5286160	I would say while the tunes in Zelda are better than musical quality is a little
5286160	5290320	bit better. It, um, did overcome overcome some of the shortcomings.
5290320	5295320	It has long passwords unless you use the add on battery pack.
5296320	5301080	Um, it does have some repetitive gameplay, some poor collision detection. Um,
5301320	5306320	but overall it's considered to be one of the better games of its type and it was
5308320	5313320	good enough to get a sequel where just that a son take takes over for him.
5314320	5318320	Um, so basically, um,
5319320	5323320	it is an over kind of the semi overhead action shooter. Like, you know,
5324320	5328160	as you can probably see from whoever's watching the video right now. Um,
5328200	5333200	so you have to go into these crypts to find the medallions and defeat each boss
5334440	5338080	to get the medallion. And then, um, you know,
5338080	5342680	you also have a life meter, um, your gold,
5342680	5347240	everything is just on screen status. I mean it is really, really very,
5347360	5349520	very Zelda. Um,
5349520	5351880	you have a lot of enemies that are even very similar,
5351880	5356880	like rocks and ghosts and nights that charge you and spear throwing goblins.
5359360	5364360	Um, now a couple of other things too, um, is that, uh,
5364600	5364880	you know,
5364880	5368160	your life meter is going to increase when you get a medallion kind of like using
5368160	5371840	the hearts. Um, you also can get an option,
5371880	5375680	an item called the book of revival that lets you continue and restart from where
5375680	5379400	you last got a password, even after the console has been shut off.
5379760	5382120	But your password will also let you resume your game.
5382440	5386840	And if you have the turbo graphic CD or turbo booster plus,
5387240	5391600	you can save your progress in the system ram via a quote file cabinet feature.
5392160	5395080	Um, kind of like the passwords, but you know,
5395320	5399800	it's on system memory and not something cause I mean it was a hue card. Um,
5399840	5404360	you know, the hue cards being also wasn't as the turbo chip. Yeah. Um,
5405920	5410160	and uh, of course this game was also published by Hudson soft. Um,
5410440	5413480	it was considered, like I said, again,
5413840	5417960	the Zelda of the PC engine era. But, um,
5418680	5423240	it was again, pretty well loved and that wasn't a terrible game.
5423800	5425760	But also though, um,
5426520	5430360	I did point out that new Tobia came out two years before legend of Zelda linked
5430360	5432360	to the past. Um,
5432760	5436800	and that it was trying to basically stay with the Nintendo curve.
5437400	5441280	A couple of other things though about this one is that people felt that the boss
5441280	5444800	battles were boring and long. Passwords are also boring and long.
5445240	5449720	And it had a references to Judaism,
5449920	5454720	Islam and quotes from star Wars that kind of made people go, what?
5455880	5459160	Um, so at any rate, you know,
5460160	5461800	it's a pretty simple game.
5462360	5466440	It's fun to play through and it doesn't suck completely. It's just,
5466560	5467920	it's not as old, it's not Zelda,
5467960	5472240	but it's worth mentioning because there was a bit of a stink over this game when
5472240	5474200	it came out. So there you go.
5476600	5481120	The game is new Topia. It looks very much like Zelda. Have you ever played it?
5481520	5486160	Nope. Well, it looks just like Zelda. It really does. I mean,
5486160	5491120	like even like the way that stairs appear and the little sword sticking out,
5491120	5495960	it was enemies go out and in and out of the ground. It really is a clone.
5496040	5499080	I swear I played this game once. Um,
5499280	5502840	but I don't know how because I never owned a turbo graphics 16 so maybe a
5502840	5505640	friend. Yeah, I must've been a friend that I demo. Well, I mean,
5505640	5507320	I knew it was on, we were in that stuff too,
5507320	5510080	but I'm pretty sure I didn't buy it on those. So I don't know.
5510360	5513840	I also feel like maybe I played a very similar type of game. Like,
5514000	5517400	like a lagoon on the super Nintendo had a lot of kind of like common stuff,
5517400	5521160	I think. So I don't know. Maybe I'm just confusing it with other stuff,
5521160	5524520	which is very possible. So, uh, Dr. C and chat says, you know,
5524520	5526960	I don't think Rob mentioned crystalis in his gaming week.
5526960	5529480	Speaking of Zelda clones. Yeah, he's right.
5529480	5531080	I did leave that out my gaming week on accident.
5531120	5534720	I did a hour stream yesterday or the day before where I was playing crystalis,
5534880	5538120	which is another kind of Zelda E type clone because they just put that out on
5538120	5541520	the super, or excuse me, the NES switch online library.
5541840	5545000	So it was fun to go visit that. So, but anyway, there it is,
5545000	5548600	your classic game of the week, utopia. So what made you think of that?
5548600	5550640	What made you pick that one this week?
5550880	5553440	Because I found my copy of utopia. Oh, there you go.
5556000	5559480	You should, I wish you streamed more of these classic games yourself.
5559600	5560840	It'd be fun to watch. Well,
5560840	5564040	as soon as they can get his computer that's not going to shut down every time
5564040	5568000	I'm trying to do something with it. Yeah. Uh, Bobby black Wolf and chat says,
5568020	5571040	what did you learn about safe States this week? Rob? Yeah. Save now,
5571040	5574840	save often, but also make sure you're actually saving and not loading.
5574920	5579360	That was the other thing I learned this week. Oops. All right.
5579800	5583480	Anyhow, let's move on. We got plenty more show to go. Uh, pretty soon though,
5583480	5587640	probably in the next 30 minutes or so, we will get to, uh, the discord, uh,
5587680	5591840	calls if you want to call in tonight over at vog network.com slash discord.
5592200	5593160	But in the meantime,
5593160	5596360	we're going to get to some rapid fire news and talk about a couple other
5596360	5600000	headlines pretty quickly here. So, uh, Loki, why don't you start us off?
5600120	5605080	So moral combat is going to be more kind of 11 is going to be getting cross
5605080	5607920	play with K because it's more combat and everything.
5607920	5610640	They have to begin with the K, um,
5610660	5614520	between places where an X-Box one is part of their upcoming patch.
5614920	5618680	And, um, that's pretty awesome. They'll have that available.
5619440	5622800	I don't care about them anymore. Okay.
5623000	5624240	You don't care about cross play or mortal combat,
5624280	5628520	about mortal combat because of Rhonda Rousey being anti-trans. Oh, I, that was,
5628600	5632880	that's old, but she still is. Yeah. And, um, how they ruined Sindel.
5633560	5637080	Oh yeah. I didn't, I don't care for what they did to Sindel, but, um, yeah,
5637920	5640640	but, uh, cross play is a good thing. At least I forgot to mention,
5640640	5643960	I may have played Minecraft on PS4 this week. That's kind of, kind of relevant,
5644120	5646400	but anyway, moving on. Yeah. Uh,
5646440	5651440	Tetris 99's dropped a new update that allows team battle mode along with the,
5653400	5658480	um, was it the 10th Maximus cup that's going to be coming soon.
5659000	5660720	So, um,
5661200	5663600	that's pretty cool that you can now battle with up to,
5663640	5667680	it looks like it's teams of 10 maybe or no,
5667720	5672120	probably like 12. I know the one screenshot I'm looking at, it's like, um,
5672160	5676640	well 99, I guess it seems like there's a whole lot less than 99 players on there
5676660	5679960	though. So maybe 25. Um,
5680960	5684440	and then let's see what else. So that'll be coming,
5684560	5687680	or that's already come out in the 10th, uh,
5687720	5692240	Maximus cup is actually starting tomorrow. All right. Busy, busy.
5692880	5695280	All right. Um, moving on to, uh,
5695280	5699240	some kind of big news in the Bioshock universe is that a new Bioshock title was
5699240	5702520	confirmed, but that's it. Just that we know a new Bioshock is in development,
5702520	5704760	but of course a new Bioshock's in development.
5704760	5707600	That franchise is pretty legendary. Well, they did tease that. Yeah,
5707600	5709200	there's a new one coming. Yeah, but we don't,
5709240	5710560	we literally know nothing about it,
5710560	5715080	but here's what we do know is that 2k games founded a new studio called cloud
5715080	5719920	chamber. It's two teams in San Francisco and Montreal as well. Uh,
5719920	5724020	and they are working on the new Bioshock game, whatever that is.
5724040	5726520	They're saying it will be in development for the next several years.
5726760	5731560	So this also means likely it's a PlayStation five new Xbox type of game.
5731600	5734600	I'm down. All of the Bioshock games have been amazing.
5734640	5737760	Bioshock is a really great series. Although I never did finish two.
5737920	5739680	That's the only one that I did not finish.
5739720	5744160	But two was kind of the one that wasn't really by like, it was like, it wasn't,
5744160	5746760	it was just kind of like a cash follow up to the first one.
5746760	5749760	Did you ever play infinite? I did play it not from start to finish,
5749760	5751600	but I did play it. It is a great,
5751680	5754920	like you got to play it all the way to the end cause it's, it's such a good game.
5755000	5758640	I need to go back, especially now that I think then they do remasters for all
5758640	5761840	those. So I need to go back and play that cause I'm pretty sure,
5761840	5763440	I know I have one and two, uh,
5763440	5767560	questmaster says Ken Levine is not involved with the new game though. Um,
5767600	5768320	and, uh,
5768320	5771560	that could be maybe a red flag when you consider he wasn't involved with the
5771560	5775720	actual Bioshock two either. Um, you know, let's give it a chance.
5776000	5779400	It might end up being really good, so we'll see. Uh,
5779440	5781360	it's still very early on. Hopefully, uh,
5781400	5783760	it'll be a really great looking game too. Uh,
5783800	5786680	this one goes out to dark Tetsuya cause I know it's one of his faves,
5786680	5790720	but it's definitely worth saying that La Mulana one and two remasters are
5790720	5793120	confirmed for a Nintendo switch in March.
5793320	5796920	There's a whole fricking like combo pack collectors edition,
5796920	5798280	like with a fricking puzzle,
5798280	5801520	like an actual puzzle that you could put together, which is pretty cool. Uh,
5801520	5804840	the remastered bundle on the 17th of March in North America,
5804840	5807000	which does St. Patrick's day, how convenient, uh,
5807000	5810960	20th of March in Europe and, uh, in other regions like Oceania, uh,
5811000	5813840	27th of March. So March, March,
5813840	5816640	2020 continues to be a huge week in games.
5816840	5820760	I worry this one's going to get lost in scary, sorry. Yes. A large month in games.
5821000	5824000	Uh, I worry this one's going to get lost in the shuffle unless you're dark
5824040	5828600	Tetsuya, who I'm sure already has this on pre-order. Uh, but no,
5828600	5831560	very cool. And, uh, yeah, I know these games are like crazy hard.
5831560	5833560	I have played a little bit of the first one and it's a,
5833840	5836840	it's a difficult game, but they're fun. So, all right,
5836840	5839400	moving on to a dark Sakura in your news.
5840400	5845000	Well, what would be nice is if it wouldn't, uh, give me like a, uh,
5845040	5848920	little pop up whenever I'm trying to read something. So, um,
5848960	5853760	one of the actresses that I actually have still been following for a little
5853760	5858760	while is a Kuriyama Chiaki who was in battle royale and in, uh,
5859600	5862280	Kill Bill. She was Gogo Yubari, right? Yep.
5862800	5867600	But I still knew her first in battle royale. Well, here at OLR,
5867620	5870280	we were all watching that battle royale years ago. Yeah.
5870280	5872960	But certainly I think most people saw her in Kill Bill for sure. Yeah.
5873680	5874480	At any rate,
5874480	5879040	she is going to be playing a police officer named, uh,
5879160	5884000	Satchimura Akane in, um, the game, uh,
5885320	5889720	Death Comes True, which I'm excited about because it's by, uh,
5890600	5895600	um, the Danganronpa dude, uh, uh, Kuraka Kazutaka.
5896400	5900280	And she's going to be, uh, basically the same,
5900320	5905000	this woman in the same hotel room that the main character woke up in shows up
5905040	5909280	unconscious and tied up. And she's a private police investigator.
5909920	5912920	So I am looking forward to, uh,
5913920	5918400	to seeing her, uh, in that game. And it's, it's a full motion video game,
5918400	5923080	by the way. So that'll be interesting. And then, um, also, uh,
5925160	5925280	uh,
5925280	5930280	there is going to be a pre-order for limited physical edition print of Watam for
5930520	5934120	PS4 and a vinyl soundtrack. Um,
5934160	5938720	it looks like we've already missed it. It was going live on December 12th,
5939240	5944240	but it's got cute covers with apples and sushi and eggs and things on it.
5944880	5947400	It's so cute. I figured this also served as a good reminder.
5947400	5950640	The game is coming very soon. Yeah. I'm looking forward to it.
5950800	5955800	Don't spoil my gaming week or release announcements.
5956160	5958320	Oh, my bad. Sorry. Yeah.
5958360	5962440	All the album artwork is actually done by Takahashi. So that's pretty cool.
5963440	5966040	Yay. All right. Well, with that,
5966040	5968800	let's travel around the world and check out some release dates. Loki,
5968800	5972000	whatever could be coming out in the U S this week. She's I don't know. Rob,
5972000	5976320	what could be coming out this week? Only want them. It's on a game.
5976320	5979400	I really want, um, it's on PC and PlayStation four,
5979400	5982960	but you already know that cause he spoiled it for you already. Yeah.
5983000	5985680	Deal with it. That's it. That's all we have. That's it.
5985680	5988960	That's the only release this week. Yes. Okay. Wow. I mean,
5988960	5991800	unless you count a title goose game, which is coming out digitally.
5991800	5995000	I didn't know I was like literally ruining the whole segment. My bad. No, no,
5995000	5998480	no. In fact, actually, um,
5998760	6000720	I thought I had a list of, um,
6001040	6004360	the digital games that are coming out this week as well. Yes. So here,
6004360	6007760	let me read over some of the digital games that normally I would skip over
6007760	6011000	because they're not on my list. Um, so as I mentioned,
6011000	6014480	entitled goose games coming out in PlayStation four and Xbox one,
6014840	6019560	we have a Zeno Raptor on PlayStation four Tamashi on
6019560	6020680	PlayStation four.
6021760	6026160	I don't know a lot of these games sin chess on PC.
6026200	6031120	I'm just going to read all the good ones. All the fun named ones sweater. Okay.
6032080	6036480	The dialogy on PC. Uh, we have gun volt Chronicles,
6036480	6038640	luminous adventure. Um,
6038920	6043040	I X on Xbox one mirror. Huh?
6043440	6047560	Did you say I X or nine? I X. That's not nine. Nothing.
6048120	6048960	Okay.
6049200	6052360	It's it's a lurk isn't, they're not trying to be, um,
6052880	6056120	doing Roman numerals there. It's lowercase I X.
6057160	6061680	So I'm assuming that as I X it X what it X it is.
6062600	6066520	Oh geez. Oh no. My rabbits are gone on PC.
6067720	6071000	Uh, one idly and the dinner party on PC.
6071720	6076280	I kind of play some of these games and last but not least a game that I think
6076280	6079920	Jamie would like soccer pinball and PlayStation four. Oh cool.
6080200	6082040	But it's not world cup soccer, but it's still soccer.
6083560	6088520	All right, well let's travel over. Wait, wait, wait. And last but not least on PC.
6088560	6093560	I kid you not. This is an actual title is coming on PC this week. Okay.
6093560	6094400	Boomer.
6097600	6100080	Somebody is cashing in on that fast. I love it.
6101040	6103840	All right. All right. Anyway, you need a game called gen X versus the world.
6104120	6108040	Now may I get in a car and go to Japan? Go. All right, here we go.
6108600	6112800	Drive across the ocean, Rob. I will. Okay. It's a Christmas miracle. Uh,
6112840	6116080	moving on to a Japanese release dates. We're going to start with the switch.
6116080	6117440	We have a few games coming out,
6117440	6121040	including Busta fellows where the S is a dollar sign. Uh,
6121080	6123320	you play us like a lawyer, I think. Anyway, uh,
6123320	6126720	that is a game that's coming out on the switch as well as a giant five in one
6126800	6130760	rock man and rock man X collection. So that is of course, mega man.
6130880	6132400	It's both mega man collections,
6132400	6136920	both mega man X collections and then rock man 11 like all in one big box set.
6136920	6140360	It actually looks pretty sweet. Uh, if I was, you know, in Japan,
6140360	6141320	I might want to pick that up,
6141320	6143120	but it's going to cost you an arm and a leg to import it.
6143120	6145160	So I don't know if you really want to do that. Uh,
6145200	6147680	some other games that are coming out on the switch on the 19th, uh,
6147680	6152520	we have warriors Orochi for ultimate is coming out as well as DC for
6153440	6154280	is out this weekend.
6154280	6158920	ESP rod day side in regular and limited edition from M two,
6159280	6163240	uh, checking out the PlayStation four this week. Uh, a lot of the same stuff.
6163240	6165480	We have that ESP rod day side. Uh,
6165480	6169040	DC to Capo is out and the rock man bundle edition is also out.
6169040	6173560	That is all again on PlayStation four as well. Uh, and uh,
6173600	6178600	the surge two is also out this week in Japan as well as ancestors legacy.
6178840	6179080	Uh,
6179080	6183280	also if you want to get a nice price reduction on earth defense force five dream
6183280	6186160	value set, that is something available to you in Japan this week.
6186320	6190040	So there you go. That's Japanese releases a little more exciting over there.
6190520	6193760	I also wanted to mention because I did catch this at the very end there, uh,
6193780	6197160	that there is a game called slippery sausages coming out in PC and Mac as well.
6198320	6198680	Oh,
6198680	6199640	oh girl.
6200720	6203480	All right. Uh, let's move on. Dark Sakura. How about the UK?
6203560	6207640	So, um, not really much on the list. These are all on the 16th.
6207960	6212040	We have a never winter nights enhanced edition collectors pack and we also have
6212320	6217320	planescape torment ice wind Dale, uh, enhanced edition collectors pack.
6217960	6221520	Um, both of those are for the big three. Um,
6221520	6224840	we also have a Baldur's gate enhanced edition collectors patch also for the big
6224840	6228840	three, uh, pack. Sorry. And then Avicii, uh,
6229560	6234240	in vector again for, uh, looks like PC and Xbox.
6234240	6235080	Okay.
6236480	6239240	Sorry. I have an autoplay. You think your popups are bad.
6239240	6240800	I got autoplay and commercials over here.
6240800	6243480	That sounds like garbage video autoplay video is garbage.
6243480	6246720	If your website has it, you're garbage and you should be ashamed of yourself.
6246760	6250200	All right, well my next story is from CBS sports so that we should also be
6250200	6252900	ashamed of yourself. All right, well it's, it's relevant.
6252900	6256920	You can see on the sidebar what it is, but anyway, but that's it. All right.
6256920	6259680	That's it for UK releases. Uh, let's go to the mailbag. Uh,
6259700	6263280	you guys can email us participate at orange launch trader.com is the place to
6263320	6266560	send us emails and a dark soccer is going to dive into the mailbag head first
6266800	6269040	and find some emails to read here on the show for you,
6269040	6271320	which I think we have a couple tonight. Yes. Yes. All right.
6271320	6274800	So the first one's from Robert M. Uh, just a question for you, for you guys.
6274800	6278440	I'm Bobby. I didn't send it to him this time. Just if he is,
6279120	6282560	just if he is in Twitch chat, I sometimes he is,
6282560	6285000	but sometimes he takes care of other stuff during the show.
6285000	6286040	So we'll see if he pops up.
6286400	6289640	I picked up super hot on the switch and appreciate that it has the option for
6289640	6292200	motion camera controls. There have been over,
6292440	6296480	there have been several other switch titles with origins and virtual reality.
6296480	6300480	Yes. Super hot was not originally VR, but that's the more recent version,
6300720	6302480	including new super lucky's tale,
6302560	6305640	which I'm interested in and Trover saves the universe.
6305800	6308880	What are the VR titles in your judgment would be a good fit for Nintendo's
6308880	6310640	console? None of them.
6312120	6315200	Doesn't run very well on console, but no, um,
6315280	6316840	anything that's not VR anymore.
6317280	6321800	You mean that would work on the console or like if Nintendo had a VR console,
6321800	6325640	like how they did super lucky's tale as a regular platformer instead of
6325640	6326480	instructional VR?
6329720	6334720	I don't know. Um, a lot of actually the, um,
6335680	6339720	they had it with, with the, uh, Labo VR stuff,
6339760	6343120	which none of that really has to be played in VR. I mean,
6343120	6346520	all that's pretty good for VR. If you want to do that.
6348480	6349840	Um, I'm also going to say none of them,
6350000	6351840	but I think for a different reason, perhaps.
6351880	6355880	I just think that if a game was cooked up in VR and VR was what was,
6355920	6359240	it was designed for and made for, I think it should stay in VR.
6359280	6362280	I think something like beat saber would be terrible if they took, well,
6362280	6363440	I don't think it'd be terrible, but it wouldn't,
6363640	6367040	it wouldn't be the same certainly if they were to put it in the screen because
6367040	6372040	that spatial awareness, uh, and so forth in the VR is a lot of it's part of what
6372200	6376040	makes that game, that game. So like, I, I, I understand the question.
6376040	6378120	I respect the question, but just respectfully,
6378120	6382600	my answer is keep VR games VR. Like, I don't think we should,
6383200	6385840	making regular games VR, um,
6386640	6390720	depending on what it is because sometimes it works out pretty decently, but like,
6390720	6394560	like resident evil seven I think was probably enhanced by VR, but I,
6394560	6398160	I could kind of give or take it and no man's sky. I think it was pretty,
6398200	6400600	but I don't think it really added anything to game Skyrim.
6400600	6401960	It was like one of those pretty,
6401960	6406120	but I don't think it added anything to the game. Um, and then, uh, like I,
6406120	6409080	I hate it when they do the eight bit games in VR.
6409280	6411880	Like I think it's one of the things people do it just because they can,
6412120	6415960	but like legend of Zelda in VR. Yuck.
6416920	6419440	Like, let's be real. It's not a good thing. And, and yeah,
6419440	6422920	the VR labo stuff didn't end up being, it could be good though if they did it.
6422920	6426800	Right. Like the legend is all the stuff like VR is good. Yeah.
6427240	6430880	So I think it could be fun. Respectfully. My answer is don't,
6431320	6433080	if you're gonna make a game for VR, keep in VR.
6433080	6436080	If you're gonna make game for a flat screen, keep it in a flat screen. Anyway,
6436160	6437000	that's my answer.
6438080	6441320	I would say though, it's okay to have franchises across except I really,
6441320	6443800	really wish that if we're going to do another half life story,
6444080	6445120	it wasn't fucking VR.
6445120	6448800	So that the rest of us who want more half life stuff are excluded by this.
6449640	6451360	It's highly exclusionary.
6451360	6455800	And on top of that could even go into being, um,
6456520	6457880	ability insensitive
6460360	6464680	for people who have sensory issues or can't wear VR headsets for any reason.
6465040	6469080	It actually could be quite, uh, discriminatory.
6469160	6469400	Well,
6469400	6473880	one could say that video games as a medium are discriminatory towards blind or
6473880	6476360	deaf, depending on what the video game is. I mean,
6476480	6478600	some out there are working on,
6478600	6481360	but doing something that is specifically exclusionary like this,
6481400	6483560	then that's like a different story. So I'm just saying.
6485000	6485840	All right, well let's move on.
6487200	6490800	Um, so the next email is, uh,
6492120	6493160	Frodo Swagons.
6493720	6496080	I just wanted to shout out team NRG.
6496120	6499280	They finally won the rocket league grand championship.
6499720	6503480	The way they won was like a fairytale. E-sports is really growing on me.
6503680	6507040	I encourage anyone to go check it out. It's on YouTube and Twitch.
6508160	6509000	Okay.
6510200	6514080	Yeah. I don't follow a lot of the E-sports stuff, but I think that's, um,
6514480	6517040	I think that's neat. And I, you know, I think it'd be one of those things.
6517280	6521240	It's like regular sports actually. I don't really follow a lot of basketball.
6521240	6525200	I don't follow a lot of baseball, but like when I go to see a basketball game,
6525200	6529360	especially like I used to go to WNBA games when they actually had a WNBA team
6529360	6533520	here because they were really, they were really reasonably priced.
6533560	6536680	That's the reality of it because you know, they weren't the NBA,
6536680	6539200	they were the WNBA. They were reasonably priced,
6539200	6541680	but the games were a lot of fun to watch live. Um,
6541680	6543720	and the crowd really got into it and all that stuff. Ooh.
6543720	6547080	And I've had a really good time when I go to hockey games. Uh, my friends,
6547120	6550840	obviously I have a lot of friends that like obsess over the sharks, uh,
6550840	6553760	in San Jose. And so I've gotten to go to games because of that. Cause like, Oh,
6553760	6555560	we have an extra ticket, Rob's in town, let's go.
6555760	6557560	And I have a lot of fun when I go, but I can't,
6557600	6560240	I don't really follow hockey outside of it.
6560400	6564520	So I think that might be like the missing piece in E-sports for me. And like, I,
6564520	6567160	I think I don't want to speak for Bobby, but, um,
6567200	6571920	I feel like when he went to DreamHack, was that what it was in Atlanta?
6571960	6574960	It was like really neat cause he was there and in the midst of those types of
6574960	6578240	things, I feel like if I'm there, like if I go to an Overwatch league thing,
6578280	6581800	then I'm going to probably have a really good time. But when I'm not, you know,
6581800	6585520	I'm not really following it outside of that. So that's not me hating on it.
6585520	6586680	It's just, Oh, I just,
6586680	6589320	I haven't really been following it cause I'm not there. So,
6589480	6590960	and Bobby Black Wolf does say, yeah,
6590960	6594040	I watched a lot of Rocket League at DreamHack Atlanta. It was fun. Okay.
6594040	6596160	If you, I wouldn't want to try to speak for you,
6596160	6599960	but that was the impression I was getting from your comments on your radio
6599960	6603920	program, which airs before us here at VOG Network. Anyway.
6604920	6606520	Um, so yeah, cool. I mean,
6606760	6610440	it's certainly easy to find esports stuff. It's playing all the time on Twitch.
6610520	6611960	Um, so yeah,
6612440	6616000	I think maybe you just have to find that game you really like. Like actually,
6617000	6621360	the one I was watching that I kind of enjoyed was Heroes of the Storm,
6621600	6625480	but then that whole thing got a kick in the butt when Blizzard basically kind of
6625480	6629080	pulled the Heroes of the Dorm and all that other stuff. And it took a lot,
6629080	6632520	I mean, there's still esports matches for Heroes of the Storm going on out there,
6632520	6634920	but a lot of the air got let out of the tires. Uh,
6635000	6639320	and that was unfortunate, I think. So anyway, any other emails or was that it?
6639360	6642200	Just the two? Okay. Just those two. Just the two.
6642320	6644120	So if you'd like to send an email in a future week,
6644160	6649200	participate at orangeloungeradio.com. All right, let's move on.
6649200	6653480	We have some more news to get to before we get to Discord stuff. Uh, Loki,
6653560	6654400	I think you're up first.
6654680	6656080	Yes. So, uh,
6656080	6661080	Redbox used to offer games and I say used to because they're going to be
6661400	6662400	discontinuing that.
6662920	6666240	So apparently they announced that they're no longer going to be renting games,
6666280	6669720	which makes sense because I don't think it did very well for them.
6669760	6671680	And honestly,
6671680	6676440	I think the rental space for video games isn't really something that's too
6676440	6678560	widely utilized nowadays anyway,
6678560	6682480	especially now with like games pass and some of the PlayStation Now services and
6682480	6686600	everything, it's just easier to pay, you know,
6686600	6690400	the $10 a month or whatever to actually utilize a service where you have a ton
6690440	6695440	of games you can play versus just renting one of the newer titles out of a red
6696840	6700360	box for like, I want to say like three or $4 a day,
6700920	6703160	which is kind of just like an antiquated thing.
6703880	6705880	It's not like the day we have a blockbuster, you know,
6705880	6708760	back when it was like a week for five bucks.
6709200	6709560	Uh,
6709560	6713680	Phoenix 7726 in chat says that means a lot of red boxes will be selling their
6713680	6714840	stock and it'll be cheap.
6715120	6720120	I got the Kingdom Hearts 1.5 and 2.5 collection for $10 on PlayStation 4.
6720240	6722440	So, I mean, I guess if you're looking for some sales,
6722440	6724920	now's a great time with the red box, but yeah, it is,
6724960	6727600	it is kind of interesting to see that I haven't,
6727680	6732000	I've never used a red box machine in my life or anything. Um, but I, I,
6732120	6735440	I know people that do use them for games. So it's, it's, you know,
6735480	6740480	I would imagine that they probably didn't get a very good discount on the games
6740760	6744640	for sale because I know we, the company used to work for,
6744640	6748720	we actually sold games to red box, um, to rent.
6748840	6751280	So they probably just,
6751320	6755680	it's probably hard for them to make up their money on that stuff cause it needs
6755680	6760680	to turn so many times and if it's just not happening before maybe the game even
6761080	6764440	gets destroyed or damaged or something like that, that it's just not,
6765480	6769520	not really valid, you know, viable use of their time. Maybe they,
6769520	6772520	they find that, you know, we're making a lot more money on movies.
6772560	6775720	It's better than just have a few more slots that we can put some more movies in
6775720	6777080	and call it a day.
6777080	6780400	I'm curious to see how red box is doing overall cause you know,
6780400	6784520	with Netflix and all these other streaming services, it's like, I don't know.
6784680	6787640	I think, yeah, that's the reason why I don't really use a lot of red boxes.
6787640	6790440	I still feel like there's a ton of things on the streaming services,
6790440	6793720	be it Netflix, be it, you know, CBS, whatever it is I have where I'm like,
6793720	6794960	I have plenty of stuff I need to watch.
6794960	6798560	I don't need to go pay five bucks to get something a little bit newer because
6798600	6801520	that stuff will hit the streaming services at some point or I'll just watch it
6801520	6802200	on the plane.
6802200	6805320	Yeah. And a lot of things like nowadays, especially too,
6805320	6810120	like rentals were good because back then it was, you know,
6810120	6813600	you had your mag gaming magazines that you could find like a review on a game or
6813600	6814080	something like that,
6814080	6817760	but rentals were good to like kind of gauge your interests if you're a like a
6817760	6820600	game or not, and you can just drop five bucks, play it for a week,
6820960	6824480	and you might even finish the game if it's short enough and check it out.
6824480	6825840	Whereas nowadays it's like,
6826320	6829320	there's so many online resources for reviews on things.
6829320	6832960	You can get a really good impression of what a game is going to be like just by
6832960	6836400	watching videos of it online or reading reviews online.
6836800	6840960	And you can then wait for a sale if it's something that you don't need right
6840960	6843400	away that you can just wait for the drop in price.
6843400	6848040	So I can see why that maybe rentals aren't necessarily as, you know,
6848080	6849440	integral as they used to be.
6850280	6853400	I don't want to sound too tinfoil hat ish or get too off topic,
6853400	6857280	but doesn't it seem like something's up with the retail industry and when it
6857280	6860480	comes to video games, but it doesn't seem like something weird is going on,
6860480	6862520	like somehow gaming, you know,
6862520	6865640	maybe I don't know if you have any insight from your time working in the,
6865640	6868360	you know, kind of the, the middleman type of stuff for distribution,
6868360	6873160	but does it seem weird that like within a year we've seen best
6873160	6876160	buys incentive program and discount program go away.
6876480	6880440	Amazon prime's discount program was pretty much scaled all the way back to
6880440	6882720	nothing. You know, I mean, they, they'd still do something,
6882720	6883600	but didn't have to do with games.
6883840	6886280	We've seen red boxes now getting rid of their games.
6886520	6890040	Doesn't this seem weird that this has all happened in the scope of like a year?
6890600	6892600	It, no, not necessarily,
6892600	6895200	because if they weren't necessarily getting backing,
6895240	6899160	cause I'm assuming with a lot of, especially with the discounts off of new games,
6899240	6902440	it was probably something that they were doing as a loss on their own.
6902920	6907640	And it could even be that the margins on those games aren't at me.
6907880	6911200	I don't know what the distribution industry looks like right now.
6911440	6914040	It could be that they're raising their prices across the board,
6914040	6918120	that the margins on those games are becoming slimmer because the price,
6918240	6923520	the wholesale price on those games are much smaller or larger now.
6923560	6925280	They don't want to break the $60.
6925520	6929680	It's so they, so they may be charging more, you know, for their games, but you know,
6929680	6933880	still requiring or not really requiring, but like it could be requiring actually
6933880	6936840	if it's, it has to do with MDF, um,
6937320	6942320	is that they have to still market that as a $59.99 game.
6943040	6948080	Whereas if they're not getting any funding from publishers to
6948120	6949680	offer discounts on these games,
6949680	6952960	which I'm assuming like a program with Best Buy or even Amazon aren't,
6953000	6954080	they were doing it as a loss.
6954560	6957840	Maybe they're just not getting the drive that they thought they were going to get
6957840	6958160	from it.
6958160	6961320	So they cut the program because they're not getting enough utilization.
6961320	6963360	It's not making them money in the end.
6964560	6966720	I don't know if that's necessarily writing on the wall.
6966720	6970120	I think it's just, they need to take a different approach with that.
6970360	6972640	I could see that. Um, some good comments in chat as well,
6972640	6975600	as Joe and Hunter Matt saying to play into Rob's tinfoil hat,
6975600	6978760	maybe they're in a holding pattern to see what the next gen consoles do with
6978760	6980560	discless gaming. Um,
6980600	6983640	certainly maybe the margins and things you're talking about when we talk about
6983640	6985200	next gen. Yeah, that could be a big thing too.
6985200	6988800	I still don't think games are going to go discless anytime soon. And granted,
6988800	6991920	they're going to have that as an option, but right now, unfortunately,
6991920	6993480	with the internet structure being,
6993520	6996080	infrastructure being what it is in the United States,
6996480	7000040	it's just not going to happen because you know,
7000080	7004440	just the time it takes to download those games, the bandwidth caps that you have,
7004680	7008160	people do like physical copies on things. I mean, you look at, you know,
7008160	7010640	you have a lot of companies are even selling, you know,
7010640	7014320	physical copies of digital games because that's what people are looking for.
7014680	7018040	I don't necessarily think that that's going to go away altogether. I mean,
7018040	7022000	granted I've been buying a lot of things more digitally than I would have
7022000	7025000	normally, but it doesn't mean that like, I don't buy physical stuff.
7025000	7027440	It's just, it depends. Like for me,
7027440	7030040	like I don't buy games that often that are huge,
7030240	7034960	but like if all my games I'm buying like online or like a 150 gigabyte download
7034960	7035720	or something like that,
7035720	7039560	I'm definitely going to be considering when I'm buying those and you know,
7039560	7042520	maybe scaling back and even looking at like, Hey, you know,
7042520	7045080	I've got all these games that I've purchased digitally and I'm not really
7045080	7046000	playing them. I mean,
7046000	7049600	maybe it would have been better if I bought them physically and then that way I
7049600	7052800	could sell them back if I really am not going to ever get to it.
7052840	7055640	Well, if the life cycle of a console is supposed to be 10 years,
7055640	7059200	I would bet in 10 years, we're not looking at one gigabyte caps anymore.
7059440	7064000	Those like the in the market is going to force those caps to rise up because you
7064000	7065440	know, 4k, 8k,
7065680	7069440	all that stuff is going to be streaming more just as technology grows that I
7069440	7073520	would like to hope is going to have, I'm hoping that, you know,
7073560	7077080	whenever we get our next president that hopefully they'll build the drive,
7077080	7082080	some sanity into, put somebody sane back in the FCC and all that. Yes.
7082280	7084720	So I'm hoping that once, once that happens,
7084720	7086160	that maybe things will get a little bit better.
7086200	7088640	Well, y'all have to vote to make that happen. But anyway, um,
7088720	7090960	another good comment from a Phoenix 77,
7090960	7094880	26 saying I would bet that a lot of retailers are paying closer attention to
7094880	7099280	stadia. Um, I, but now the thing where,
7099440	7101240	here's the thing with stadia, it's, it's,
7101280	7105160	it's too new for a lot of these same reasons that the bandwidth caps and
7105160	7106760	concerns. But again, like,
7106840	7108640	and I mentioned this when I was reviewing stadia,
7108640	7113080	thanks to the buddy pass Bobby gave me is that right now I'm only playing
7113080	7115000	destiny two in like, you know,
7115000	7118200	1080p and the bandwidth is not really that bad at all.
7118200	7121600	It's not really that much of a concern because I'm lightly playing and I'm not
7121600	7123920	really like hardcore playing. Maybe if I was spending more hours on it,
7123920	7128000	it might be a different story. But, um, I think Google stadia,
7128000	7131800	if Google is not willing to commit 10 years to stadia,
7132080	7134160	and I think that's where we all sit here and go,
7134160	7137560	when is Google committed 10 years to anything besides maybe Gmail and Google
7137560	7140000	earth? Right. So I think that's why there's,
7140000	7141720	might be a little bit of concern here.
7141880	7143200	Are they going to commit 10 years to stay there?
7143200	7145200	Because they're not committing 10 years to stadia and they shouldn't be
7145200	7147200	fucking doing it. Well, and then to that point,
7147200	7150360	like if you look at the stadia thing, so say you buy, um,
7150480	7153800	the stadia controller and the streaming thing or whatever,
7153800	7157680	that's like a hundred bucks right there or over a hundred dollars. You know,
7157680	7160960	the prices of the Xbox ones are coming down.
7160960	7165960	If you were like looking at like not really doing the 4k streaming all the time,
7166720	7169320	or if you just wanted, you know, game 1080 or whatever,
7169320	7174280	you might be better off just buying an Xbox one S and doing games pass.
7174320	7178520	And then at least you got a full library of games for the same prices where they
7178520	7181280	want you to buy in the each individual game, which doesn't make any sense.
7181280	7185480	That's fair. Microsoft is about to come for that hard in this next year.
7185480	7188460	Watch with this new Xbox is coming out and everything.
7188460	7191480	And how are you going to play these newer games on your old Xbox?
7191640	7194320	They're going to be using that streaming and cloud technology to make it
7194320	7198920	happen. Absolutely. So watch for all that come holiday 2020.
7199600	7203360	So, all right, anyway, moving on, speaking of things in the future,
7203360	7206760	let's talk about a big franchise that had a big announcement this week. Now,
7206760	7210200	not that we follow all the sports games in the world, but you know, we,
7210200	7214080	we can all recognize the MLB, the show pretty big franchise.
7214080	7217920	It has historically been a Sony exclusive, but, uh,
7217960	7221940	this week a joint announcement was made between Sony MLB and the MLB players
7221940	7223320	association, uh,
7223360	7227800	that there will be a multi-year extension to the contract so that Sony gets to
7227800	7230840	keep making these games. But this is the part that's interesting.
7231120	7235960	They're going to make additional console platforms beyond PlayStation as
7235960	7238000	early as 2021.
7238200	7241920	So the next time I'll be the show may be out on the switch because I thought it
7241920	7245480	was a Sony developed game. It is. But the problem is,
7245480	7247480	is that they were about to lose that license.
7247480	7250520	If they were not willing to put it on other consoles. Hmm.
7250800	7254580	So in order to keep the license, they're going to put it on other consoles.
7254580	7257240	I mean, well, that's good. Cause we don't want EA to get the license.
7257240	7259840	So I'm, I'm fine with that.
7260600	7264000	So yeah, it's going to be a little weird seeing a Sony game on a Nintendo
7264000	7268520	platform again, but this is where we're moving to with gaming in 2020 is it's not,
7268520	7270400	I mean, hell we already, I,
7270880	7275040	I didn't mention this week that I was playing Minecraft on PlayStation four,
7275040	7280120	but I was, and I got to say it was a trip signing into my Xbox
7280120	7280720	library, excuse me,
7280720	7285480	my Microsoft account on my PlayStation and then getting my OLR gamer
7285480	7287160	pick on my PlayStation.
7287400	7290080	That was the thing that happened this week and that was kind of a trip,
7290080	7294840	but in a good way in the, in a I'm playing a Sonic game on my Nintendo kind of way,
7294840	7297920	you know, it's, uh, it's, it's quite, quite something.
7297920	7301000	But I think this is just where gaming is going in general is that we're going to
7301000	7302800	see not just more cross platform,
7302800	7306320	but we're just going to see that folks are going to see that there's more places
7306320	7310640	for the money. I think so. Did you want to add to that dark soccer? I'm sorry.
7310800	7315080	No, I just figured that now that Alan has he's here. Oh yeah. Alan,
7315080	7318840	did you want to see some of the gifts that, uh, dark soccer got us? Hold on.
7318840	7322120	I just lost chat. So I'm like trying to get it back. So sorry. Yeah. Sorry.
7322120	7324800	Chat lost you. Yeah, I lost you guys for a minute here.
7324800	7327240	So it's hard for me to multitask. That's okay. Um,
7327920	7331560	but maybe we should move on to our next story here while I get chat back. Sure.
7331560	7334160	Is it me? Yes. Okay. Well, um,
7334320	7338880	there are going to be, uh, some, uh, nice, uh,
7340120	7343000	oh my gosh, I actually completely just lost my voice for a moment,
7343360	7347120	but there has been an announcement by, uh, uh,
7347600	7352080	Vanquish Games that there is going to be a, um, if I say Vanquish,
7352320	7354680	the game is Vanquish and Bayonetta,
7354960	7358440	but they're going to be getting remastered. I cannot talk.
7358680	7362440	They're both going to be getting remastered versions coming out soon. Um,
7363160	7366920	and, uh, but it's going to be, um,
7367400	7369800	looking like they're supposed to be pretty, uh, pretty,
7369960	7372520	pretty if I can make words happen,
7372840	7375960	but it looks like the real estate for those are going to be April 18th, 2020.
7376520	7381400	So there you go. I have completely muffled what I just said.
7381560	7383160	Are you sharing a Coke with Brittany?
7385080	7387880	It's Brittany's Coke, bitch. Sorry. Uh, for those on the podcast,
7387880	7391160	you can't see Alan came into the studio so that, uh, we could,
7391160	7394760	I could show him all the things. So this mug was free cause it has chocolate cat
7394760	7398480	on it, which yeah, I know is so thank you. Um,
7398560	7402080	but then dark soccer, this is, this is definitely you thing. Not a me thing.
7402680	7406400	That is, Oh yay. And I was running, I was getting low and I've got mics.
7406960	7411200	Oh, sorry. You have Loki's mic. Okay, cool. So yes, so very cool. And then, uh,
7411240	7412600	I have a batsamaru one of these,
7412600	7415640	but I'm sure you'll steal it cause that's what happens when you're married. Um,
7415720	7419160	and then, uh, yeah, they cinnamon roll. Yay. And we always,
7419160	7423280	we love a print sock in this house. Yes, we do. The kookier,
7423280	7427360	kitschier the better. Well, you can't go any better than burger,
7427680	7431920	burgers and pizza. Yes. It's like what we eat,
7431920	7435880	represented on our feet. That's very nice of you. The other thing, the board game.
7436160	7438800	Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I showed him that first. Yeah. The Funko verse.
7438840	7443160	So that's pretty cool. So this is for your holidays. Happy.
7444520	7448320	What's new in gaming for you since you're here? Um,
7448360	7452280	I started checking out, um, uh,
7452440	7457000	the final chapters of black Mesa. Uh, you know how,
7458280	7461760	they finally put out a version of the game in like 2012 and then the last
7461760	7465360	chapter Zen, which was not good in the original. Um,
7465400	7468000	they redid it from the ground up was like, Oh,
7468000	7470520	Zen's going to come out next year, next year, next year. Well, it's,
7470520	7474400	it's finally next year. I'm eight years later and they finished it.
7474480	7478160	You can beat the game now for real, the whole thing. And I'm plugged. I'm,
7478200	7481240	it's, it's so it's, it's an extra three or four hours of content.
7481240	7484960	I feel like it's really long and they did an incredible job.
7485000	7489680	And the reason why it took them so damn long is because they really had no,
7489680	7491840	they knew that Zen was bad, so they wanted to like,
7491840	7493040	rebuild it from the ground up.
7493040	7496440	So they had to do concept art and like art direction.
7496440	7499240	What does this alien civilization look like? And it's all incredible.
7499360	7503960	And I can't say enough good things about, um, crowbar collective. All right.
7504080	7505400	That's great. And, uh, just,
7505440	7509240	just waiting for half-life Alex to not be played. Yeah, exactly.
7510160	7514480	You waited too long, Gabe. We don't, we don't care anymore. All right.
7514960	7517000	All right. Thanks for stopping it. I'm giving these to you to take with you.
7517000	7520840	You can put that one in the kitchen and then that cup is for you as well. So go,
7520840	7522800	go make, I want bunk beds. You getting me a bunk bed?
7524200	7527960	That's a loft bed. It's not a bunk bed. My son wants a loft bed.
7527960	7529960	My wife does not want my son to have a loft bed,
7530640	7533920	but they have desks built into them and it would solve two of my problems at
7533920	7535640	once. There you go. She just,
7535920	7539200	she thinks that somehow he's going to fall out of it or like it's not.
7540400	7542760	That I have fallen out of a bunk bed and slept through it.
7543760	7547640	He won't fall out of a bunk bed or a loft bed because it has,
7547720	7549800	it has walls on the sides. Yeah.
7549960	7554840	He would have to do some serious like rolling like Katamari style to get up over
7554840	7558360	that edge. And I mean, and they make enhanced over thing anyway,
7558360	7562000	but you can just tell her that I've slept because he gets up like three or four
7562000	7565240	times a night to use the bathroom that he might have trouble navigating the
7565240	7566080	ladder.
7568720	7571720	Okay. Yes. Almost 10 year old son.
7572080	7573320	How about you wear a diaper?
7573320	7575080	Alan is cackling from the kitchen.
7575080	7578600	If you get him a port-a-potty to put on the corner of the bed.
7579680	7582720	You know, back when he was much, uh,
7582760	7587320	smaller and he was still using the like toddler potty.
7587680	7591520	We did put the potty in his room to make it easier for him so he wouldn't have
7591520	7594880	to go down the hallway. Hmm. Yes.
7594960	7597000	All the stories that you didn't really care to hear about.
7597080	7598760	All right, though, let's move on.
7598760	7600840	Four reasons I didn't have children.
7602120	7606000	Speaking of going to the potty, let's talk about Twitch streams. No,
7606000	7608000	nobody's streams. Although they're talking in chat.
7608000	7612280	Apparently some big broadcaster just got banned and mega 64 podcast because
7612280	7614040	someone apparently threw up on their stream.
7614720	7616920	I didn't know that was something you hit band for.
7617160	7619320	I mean, not that I wanted to do that. Huh?
7619440	7620280	I don't think you have it on purpose.
7620280	7623360	Did they throw up onto an animal? Because apparently that's been gay.
7623400	7628600	Oh, Bobby says it was a lot of drinking. Oh, interesting. All right. Well noted.
7628600	7630880	No more drunk shows here at OLR cause we're on Twitch.
7632720	7636720	Oh, do it beforehand, right? Wait, I've, I've, I've had a little bit of wine.
7636840	7639520	Have I done it on air? I don't think I've had wine since we moved to Twitch.
7640160	7643720	I think the last time I was having wine on the show, we were still, um,
7644080	7646920	on the show cast. I have a lovely sangria in my fridge.
7646960	7649360	You should come over and we'll do a drunk podcast.
7649720	7654480	Bobby Blackwell says alcohol is okay if it's tame, but excessive alcohol isn't.
7654480	7658200	So if I enjoy a lovely wine in a can, I can do that.
7658200	7659280	It's just a big success.
7659800	7663720	It's just when you bring in a beer bong into the situation, that's when it's done.
7664240	7669000	Rob, you know what we need to do? What? Froze. Mm. Good times. Yeah.
7669040	7671840	Yes. All right. It's showing on a mat. It says, Rob,
7671840	7676720	don't go full Sally O'Malley last drunk show cause I'm 50,
7677400	7680920	50 years old. I'm not 50. So, um, you know,
7680920	7685640	most of the news we hear about Twitch streamers and signing contracts end up
7685680	7686680	having to be with them,
7686680	7691440	leaving Twitch to other platforms like mixer to sign exclusive contracts. Well,
7691440	7696280	this time Twitch is kind of getting on that bandwagon to sign some of the top
7696280	7698960	streamers to exclusive multi-year deals,
7699200	7704200	including such streamers like Dr Lupo or lyric or
7704200	7705560	Tim the tap man.
7705680	7710680	They have all been signed to multi-year deals exclusive to the Twitch platform.
7711680	7714080	And I'm sure that's to help with, uh,
7714120	7719120	some of the Exodus that you have with like Ninja shroud and courage and stuff
7719160	7720520	like that. In fact, I want to say,
7720520	7725520	I saw a story earlier this week as well talking about shroud and actually
7726000	7731000	leaving the platform for mixer and that only 15% of his followers came with him
7731000	7735640	to mixer. Uh, but that's still 15% more than they had before.
7735640	7739040	And who's to say that, you know, I mean, I don't know,
7739040	7743720	I don't know that more could come later. I mean, who knows?
7745280	7747280	Stop trying to make mixer happen. I'm just kidding.
7748560	7750640	A little competition is actually, it's super healthy.
7750680	7754240	I'd rather have competing platforms, but for sure. Oh,
7754240	7756120	an exclusive multi-year deal.
7756120	7758760	But it's nice to see Twitch doing what they need to do. But I don't,
7758760	7760960	I also feel like, and this is,
7760960	7764320	this is the thing about like doing streaming as a full time job.
7764320	7767600	And I totally get this as ironic considering what we're doing right now.
7767840	7769080	But I think Bobby,
7769080	7773440	myself and anybody else that's participated on VOG network would probably say
7773440	7776240	that we are hobbyists. This is our hobby.
7776240	7778480	We're doing this for the love of the craft for fun.
7778680	7783440	We're not doing this to pay our rent. Um, nobody on this network is. Um,
7783480	7786680	and I think when you do take it on as a full time job,
7786680	7788960	and I'm not one of those haters, believe me, I'm not.
7789200	7791840	What I'm actually saying is quite the opposite is that, you know,
7791840	7795760	when it comes to that sort of thing, you just have to be careful because, uh,
7795760	7798240	what's the famous line from the Rocky or a picture show.
7798400	7802840	I made you and I can break you just as easily, not me specifically,
7802840	7805760	but I'm talking about the internet, right. And the fandom and that fickle fandom,
7805960	7808440	you know, they made you, but they can also break you.
7808440	7809920	So that's why I say like,
7810120	7812880	if you are going to take on this type of thing full time as your job,
7813040	7814840	you gotta be thinking about things, you know,
7814840	7817760	like are you saving money for, if this should ever go away,
7817920	7821480	are you trying to go to school, I guess, part-time or no, I mean, I'm,
7822400	7824040	I could go on a whole other tangent about this,
7824040	7826840	but I am very much of the mindset is that you do not have to go to college to
7826840	7830600	be successful, but there are plenty of other ways you can get certifications.
7830600	7833120	You can still go to classes, you can still, you know,
7833120	7836880	be up and up on your industry and join associations, things like that.
7837040	7840360	But are you looking at those types of things for heaven forbid, if you,
7840400	7844560	you know, that ever fails? Um, I think people should jump all into that.
7844560	7846720	And if they love streaming and they love community,
7846880	7849080	by all means that passion is going to show through and that's,
7849080	7851320	what's going to make you successful. But at the same time,
7851560	7855800	you gotta be prepared for, you know, if it should all go away someday, you know,
7855800	7860680	look how quickly people get canceled, right? That's the reality of 2019.
7860680	7864800	So what's going to happen if you get canceled, you know,
7864960	7869160	if I get canceled, then we weren't making money anyway. You know, I,
7869160	7872080	I like to think that some of you guys would still show up. I, I,
7872320	7875520	I hope I wouldn't say anything really stupid because I try not to say stupid
7875520	7877080	things. But as I said,
7877280	7881040	I probably did say stupid things 17 years ago on this show because it was
7881040	7885960	17 years ago. Things were different. Right. So, um, my point is, is that,
7885960	7886400	you know,
7886400	7889240	if somebody is making a lot of money and they're living off this stuff,
7889240	7891920	they gotta be careful because that could go away someday.
7892080	7895240	So the nice thing about the multi-year deal is that at least they have that
7895240	7896720	security for some time.
7896720	7899520	I mean, this is not something that we normally, we talked about on the show,
7899520	7901280	but like, even now,
7901280	7905280	like Twitter is changing more of their algorithm stuff and changing some of the
7905280	7908000	rules that they have in there, including, um,
7908680	7912200	stuff about like harassment of other people and stuff like that,
7912200	7915160	where you have like old episodes of like, for example,
7915160	7918440	Content Cop that are getting taken off the platform and stuff like that,
7918440	7922320	or like all these video old videos that people would put up there are getting
7922320	7925440	torn down. And it's like, you have that with the COPPA stuff.
7925440	7929720	So then if you have kids friendly content, well, you're fucked. Um, you've,
7930440	7932880	it's just like a whole bunch of like stuff that it's,
7933480	7936680	it's not good to put all your eggs in one basket,
7936680	7939240	especially with like Twitch and stuff like that too.
7940280	7944200	You want to have multiple revenue sources coming in, especially you wouldn't,
7944240	7947720	I wouldn't want to rely on those platforms specifically for my revenue.
7947720	7949960	I would say like a Patreon or something like that.
7950160	7951800	If you're going to continue doing that type of thing.
7952040	7953200	The one I saw this week though,
7953200	7956520	that was really hilarious is the way they got around the YouTube system.
7956680	7960520	So you know how like you'll have random like music labels,
7960520	7962960	copyright claiming your videos and stuff like that,
7962960	7966040	even though like you could be just like humming a tune or something like that.
7966040	7969000	Not necessarily even playing or it's incidentally in the background or
7969000	7973640	whatever. So people have started, um, one of the, this, uh,
7973760	7978480	YouTuber decided that I'm going to write a really shitty
7978520	7979600	outro song.
7979880	7984520	I'm going to put it in one of those music label services,
7984800	7987320	and they're going to put that in the content ID system.
7987520	7989920	So that means that every video that I put in there,
7990200	7992280	I'm copyright claiming my own video.
7992360	7994840	So I automatically get the revenue from that.
7994960	7998160	And that also means that any video that they put up,
7998200	8001120	even if they're not eligible to receive ad revenue from that,
8001240	8003080	they're receiving ad revenue from that.
8003520	8007400	That is how messed up their system is in order to fix that system so that they
8007400	8008200	can't do that.
8008200	8011960	That means they actually have to fix the ad system that they have in the way
8011960	8016280	that every user wants it to be in the first place. It's brilliant.
8016320	8017520	It's fucking brilliant.
8019280	8021320	YouTube needs to be needle on a few things.
8021320	8025800	So I'm happy to hear about that as well. So, uh, I've been following, um,
8025840	8027520	some of the content producers,
8027520	8031560	like the ones who do doll modifications and they got put under like a bunch of
8031560	8034920	the child, uh, accounts.
8035040	8038200	Somebody mistake the doll for an actual child because they do kind of look real.
8038240	8040640	No, no, because they thought that it was content for children.
8040960	8045560	So children couldn't be subjected to ad revenue or to ads.
8045680	8046040	Yeah.
8046040	8050760	So there's a big petition going on to allow people to code their own
8050760	8051720	channel stuff.
8052480	8055680	And it's just because a few of them that have been following for a while now
8055680	8057760	have lost their livelihood. So.
8059200	8062360	All right. Anyway, who that took a turn, but Hey, it's, uh,
8062400	8065960	this streaming culture is, is where we're at and where this show is at now.
8065960	8069280	And celebrating one year on a Twitch anyway.
8070360	8071320	Anyhow, let's move on.
8071320	8074800	We have one more story and then we'll get to our list around table on discord.
8074840	8077680	This story has to do with time magazine. You know,
8077720	8081640	a lot of people are talking about time magazine and the person of the year and
8081640	8084920	the whole Twitter thing that came of that. I ain't going to touch that right now.
8085000	8088360	But I will say is that I think that discussion took away from, Oh,
8088520	8092240	time names, all this other stuff when in that same magazine. Right.
8092440	8096880	And so one of the things they were looking at was the top 10 gadgets of the past
8096880	8101000	10 years. And, uh, just to name, there's a lot of Apple stuff on there.
8101000	8103560	It's not too surprising, but running down the whole list,
8103560	8107160	Apple iPad in 2010, the Tesla model S in 2012,
8107200	8110480	raspberry PI in 2012, the Chrome cast in 2013,
8110680	8114280	the DJI Phantom in 2013, the Amazon echo in 2014,
8114280	8116000	the Apple watch in 2015,
8116200	8121200	the Apple air pods in 2016 and the X-Box adaptive controller in 2018.
8121200	8123200	That's pretty awesome. Actually, I'm all for that.
8123480	8127600	But the one that I'm saved for last is a whole console.
8127600	8132320	It's the Nintendo switch in 2017 was named one of the top
8132360	8135880	consoles. I mean, technically the iPad's a console too in a way, but anyway,
8135880	8137720	we'll sit, we'll leave it at the Nintendo switch for now.
8137920	8139920	And in there right up on the switch, they said,
8139920	8141080	when it comes to gaming on the go,
8141080	8144920	no one can top Nintendo's track record beginning with the game boy in 1989.
8144920	8147320	But it's the introduction of the hybrid Nintendo switch,
8147480	8150080	which you can play either portably or connected to your TV might be the
8150080	8154000	company's most important contribution to gaming yet compared to the competition.
8154000	8156840	It handily takes the crown as the most important video game console of the
8156840	8160960	decade with fans begging developers to bring their next title to the switch.
8161080	8164520	It's smartphone inspired portability paired with Nintendo's ever-growing
8164520	8168560	library of blockbuster independent and vintage titles makes the switch feel
8168560	8171880	like the culmination of Nintendo's idea of what gaming should be.
8172080	8174560	So that is, uh, from the time magazine right up.
8174560	8177720	If you want to see more details, you will have to go find that magazine. Um,
8177920	8178800	but, um,
8179280	8182680	pretty neat to see a console like the switch on there as one of the top 10
8182680	8185800	inventions or one top 10 gadgets, I should say of the decade.
8185800	8186640	What do you guys think?
8187560	8188400	I agree.
8189240	8193520	I think that it definitely belongs up there with all those illustrious other
8193520	8194360	items.
8194920	8199280	Absolutely. So pretty cool. Uh, all right. Well with that,
8199320	8203080	we will move on to our listener round table via discord and chat.
8203080	8204720	If you guys have any questions in our chat room,
8204960	8208680	you can go ahead and pose those there in chat while I get discord up and running
8208680	8211760	here, cause I'm not currently up and running, but I will get there again.

8231880	8234840	Nobody's in the green room right now. We'll give it a couple of minutes. Well,
8234920	8236920	you know, people are being shot. Well, metal mayhem said,
8236920	8240600	I'm not calling in tonight, but I do want to say, uh, what did he say about it?
8240600	8242320	It was about a sale, but it was one of the chat. Oh yeah.
8242560	8245400	Gog is having another big sale right on the heels of the black Friday sale.
8245440	8248000	Everybody's having, everybody's having sales right now because it's um,
8248040	8251000	look what month it is. Yeah. It's close to the holidays. And you know,
8251000	8254160	people are thinking about, Oh, those last minute Christmas gifts.
8254200	8257480	You sounded like you're from Minnesota for a second. Really? Oh, don't you know?
8257520	8260920	It's cause I watched too much drop dead gorgeous. One of my favorite movies.
8261200	8263800	I know I've never seen it. What? Yeah.
8263920	8266840	I wonder if that's even on any streaming platforms. It's a great movie.
8266880	8267400	Keep in mind.
8267400	8270360	I've also never seen mean girls all the way through and I can quote that movie
8270920	8272880	because it's all my friend's fault.
8272960	8276360	I would say that there's movies from the eighties or I can like quote scenes and
8276360	8278600	things that happen. Like I think a good example would be planes,
8278600	8283080	trains and automobiles. Like everybody knows that scene with Edie McClurg, uh,
8283080	8285880	when she's working at the automobile rental or whatever.
8286120	8287480	And Steve Martin comes in and goes,
8287480	8291440	I want a fucking car that fucking works and I want to fucking and all this
8291440	8295360	stuff. And she goes, Oh, do you have a copy of rental agreement? And he's no,
8295520	8298400	you're fucked. Like, but I've never seen that movie,
8299400	8300880	but I know that scene.
8301800	8305040	Do you know, you know what we need to do for, for Gay Jumis?
8306040	8309600	Oh yeah. On the 25th, right? We need to find a place that's open.
8310200	8313360	That'll be the first challenge. And then we also need to watch gremlins.
8314640	8317600	Your favorite Christmas movie. It is my favorite Christmas movie. Everybody,
8317720	8321480	everybody always talks about Die Hard as a Christmas movie and like not enough
8321480	8325240	people are talking about gremlins. Die Hard is a great movie. Don't get me wrong.
8325800	8327800	But it's like, it's the hipster thing.
8328720	8332960	I'm sick of the Christmas argument about, about Die Hard. How about shut up?
8333760	8336760	You know what I'm saying? We need to talk more about gremlins.
8337480	8341360	Even more of a Christmas movie because it actually does have a Christmas theme to
8341360	8344640	it. Whereas Die Hard just happened during Christmas.
8345160	8350160	And I will arguably say that gremlins two may be better in one of these rare
8350600	8351440	circumstances.
8351640	8355240	I will watch gremlins, but then you have to watch my favorite Christmas movie.
8355440	8356000	What?
8356000	8357040	Batman Returns.
8357040	8360920	Oh hell yeah. Fucking Michelle Pfeiffer. Hell yeah.
8361320	8362160	And actually that...
8362160	8363600	Batman Returns is my favorite Christmas movie.
8363600	8368600	That podcast that I'm fond of, Stuff Mom Never Told You with the amazing Annie
8369560	8370400	and Samantha.
8370880	8375000	They did their feminist movie Friday and talked about Batman Returns on it and
8375000	8377200	it was a fantastic episode.
8377320	8377760	Yes.
8377760	8380200	I fucking love Batman Returns.
8380520	8383760	It's, it's a completely underrated Batman film. Like I get it.
8383960	8385920	The Nolan trilogy was great.
8386120	8389960	I understand why you all love the Dark Knight and unfortunately not enough of
8389960	8394960	you like Batman Begins and like the Scarecrow was amazing, but, uh,
8395160	8398080	not enough people talking about the Tim Burton Batman years and especially
8398080	8401080	Batman Returns, like completely underrated. Yes, it was camp. Yes,
8401080	8403720	it had problems, but it was fucking incredible.
8403720	8407120	I'm going to say that I do not care for Nicholson's Joker, just saying,
8407520	8411040	but fucking Danny DeVito as the penguin. Hello.
8411080	8413560	Well, and the Schumacher films were terrible. Both of them.
8413600	8417240	I like Schumacher films forever and Schumacher films.
8417920	8420680	I don't know of them. Yes, that, yes.
8420720	8424120	You mean that period of my life that I saw the movie for free and wanted a
8424120	8424880	refund?
8424880	8427080	Schumacher's made Phantom of the Opera and nothing else.
8427080	8428920	I saw the one with Batgirl for free.
8430120	8435120	I went up to Spanish Fort to go see it for free and I still wanted a refund.
8437480	8439440	The only good thing about that movie was my popcorn,
8440080	8444720	but when summing up a Batman Returns. All right, we have a call. Uh, wait.
8445200	8447480	Oh wait. Oh, I thought you had another point. We have a call.
8447480	8450600	I want to get to it. So, um, hello. You're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
8452760	8455840	You might be muted, so go ahead and unmute and you're on Orange Launch Radio.
8455840	8457760	Who's this? Meow.
8460200	8464200	Four or five still alive. Uh oh.
8465200	8468120	Oh, well things happen sometimes. Uh, I guess the,
8468160	8471440	but it shows it's still muted. So I'll see if you mean it.
8472480	8472800	I'll see.
8472800	8476080	So they announced a new character for Street Fighter five championship edition.
8476120	8478920	Oh really? Who? Seth. Oh, why?
8478960	8480960	But Seth is coming back as a female character now.
8481760	8482600	What?
8483600	8486120	It's going to be a female character and then they have an nostalgia skin,
8486120	8487120	which is the male character.
8488320	8489640	Okay. All right. Cool.
8490480	8493360	So then Seth is, we'll just refer to Seth as gender fluid.
8494280	8496920	Well, he's also made out of metal, so I guess that would work.
8497520	8502120	Gender and metal fluid. Non-binary. Okay. So interesting.
8502640	8505480	Uh, when did they announce that? Just now tonight?
8505520	8508920	It was, yeah, I think they had some sort of event going on right now.
8510680	8514640	Uh, Dartusia says as long as Seth isn't the final boss again, that wasn't fun.
8515200	8518720	Uh, I don't think so because they have costumes that they're selling and,
8519360	8522920	or they have, uh, available. They have a story costume, battle costume,
8522920	8527280	nostalgia costume, which is the, the old design and then a summer costume.
8527880	8529520	And thank you. That was the other piece I was looking for.
8529520	8532720	Act F says the Capcom cup finals were today. Ah, yes.
8532960	8535840	So that's where that actually came from. All right, we'll try this one more time.
8536240	8537880	Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?
8537960	8539480	Make sure you unmute yourself so we can hear you.
8543160	8546560	Okay. Well, we tried, I don't think it's a troll.
8546560	8548320	I think it's just somebody might be newer to discord.
8548320	8550160	So trying to figure that out. So it was a new,
8550360	8552640	it was a new name I didn't recognize. So I got excited for a minute.
8552680	8556920	And then there's this video that I see if some guy that beat time crisis to both
8556920	8561520	as player one and two on one, one credit. Now that's fun.
8562360	8565640	Good times. I guess it would be two credits because you know, one and two.
8566360	8569840	All right. Well, we're going to go ahead and wrap up, I guess,
8569840	8573520	for the night and, uh, close up shop here at orange launch radio. Uh,
8573520	8576720	but we do want to thank you guys for tuning in tonight and participating with
8576720	8581000	our show tonight. And, uh, Hey, if you did, uh, well actually wait before I do that,
8581000	8583320	last minute stories, anything else besides the set thing? I'm sorry.
8583640	8587200	No, that's pretty much it. Okay. All right. Well, uh,
8587200	8589880	I do want to thank you guys for being here tonight and listening to the show,
8590200	8591080	uh, participating, uh,
8591080	8594680	whether you were here live with us over at Twitch TV or you were downloading our
8594680	8599120	podcast feed, we appreciate it either way. Uh, and, um, yeah,
8599320	8601600	I definitely appreciate you supporting the show. Uh,
8601640	8603480	we'll be back next week to do it all again.
8603480	8608160	We'll be right on the heels of Christmas and right in the middle of Hanukkah
8608160	8609680	starts next Sunday, right?
8609840	8612280	Yeah. So Christmas will be the week after. Yeah.
8612360	8615960	And Hanukkah will just be starting. Oh my God. You know what it means?
8616480	8619280	Lotka. Good times.
8619440	8623120	I'll bring over lots of lot comics and we'll make a lot cause, but, um,
8623320	8627960	I might actually make pub cheese to put on it instead of sour
8627960	8629200	cream or applesauce.
8629280	8632160	So whatever holiday it is that you celebrate, uh,
8632200	8634040	we hope you guys have a great one. Uh,
8634040	8636000	or if you don't celebrate anything at all, um,
8636080	8639200	I hope this opportunity with all the holiday days is a good chance for you to
8639240	8643080	catch up on your gaming backlog. That's a, that's a gift too as well. So, um,
8643360	8645240	hope everybody, um, has a great next guy.
8645240	8647720	Cause I know all the holiday parties are starting in the next couple of weeks.
8647880	8652440	So I think this is, you know, we're, we're kind of moving into the, uh, holidays.
8652680	8656360	Yeah. SG100 Matt in chat says, I think Rob said he has a ton of lotka mix. I do.
8656360	8657280	Do not buy more.
8658280	8662960	I did buy more that I had more. Okay. All right. All right.
8664560	8667840	Let's go around and everybody get everybody's final thoughts. Um,
8667920	8669920	Loki, I guess we'll start with you. What's your final thought tonight?
8670160	8673840	Uh, my final thought is I still need to finish my Christmas shopping.
8675920	8678240	I realized that the timing is not good for that.
8680600	8682720	Um, my final thought is, uh,
8682760	8685600	what the UPS kept the power on for the show tonight.
8685600	8688880	So thank you Alan for that. Uh, thank you dark soccer for the gifts.
8688880	8690600	They're very much appreciated and, uh,
8690640	8694240	we'll definitely be using like the mug and those sorts of things. So thank you.
8694240	8697360	Thank you. And the socks, cause I love me a print sock. Um,
8697360	8700400	and I want to again just thank you guys for watching and those that have
8700400	8701280	supported, uh,
8701320	8704200	the VOG network channel and some of the special things we did like earlier this
8704200	8707760	week, the game awards, and then my own personal channel over at Mr. Rob Roberts
8707760	8710040	as well. Definitely appreciate all that support. Um,
8710080	8712600	I don't know what else to say. I just need to play some more games this week.
8712880	8715640	I've had this weird itch to start final fantasy 12 again,
8715640	8718120	cause I never beat it like any of the five times I've played it.
8718120	8721640	So maybe that's going to be like a hashtag gaming goal,
8721800	8725520	but don't forget, don't neglect your, uh, your bridge baby. Yeah,
8725520	8727560	I know. Death stranding. Yeah, I know. I still need to finish that.
8727800	8731240	Bridge baby is cute. Uh, dark soccer, your final thought tonight.
8731640	8734680	Number one, I freaking love the last episode of the Mandalorian.
8735360	8739120	And number two, tomorrow I am going to see reject false icons,
8739600	8744600	which is the gorilla's documentary slash movie thing that they're doing as a
8744600	8748680	limited run. I got shit seats cause people kept grabbing all the good ones,
8748680	8750880	of course, but Dan and I are going tomorrow.
8750880	8755480	So I figured that given that I often say reject false icons, um,
8755520	8760520	I'm also going to say reject stupid people like stupid people who attack
8760640	8765680	autistic girls on Twitter. All right. Well, that's the best be best.
8766440	8768880	That's going to do it for another episode of orange launch radio.
8769080	8771280	Happy gaming this week. Have a great week, everybody.
8771280	8775040	We'll see you in seven days to all over again. Good night.
