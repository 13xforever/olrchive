00:00.000 --> 00:18.000
This week, stories have come out on the Game Awards and the art of keeping their biggest

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
secrets a secret.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.420
How the show's biggest reveals were hidden from industry, event and other staff until

00:22.420 --> 00:23.420
the night of.

00:23.420 --> 00:26.540
Stay tuned for this and plenty more news starting right now on the show, where every gamer has

00:26.540 --> 00:33.540
a voice.

00:33.540 --> 00:37.340
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

00:37.340 --> 00:39.100
where every gamer has a voice.

00:39.100 --> 00:45.460
It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 803 for this December the 22nd

00:45.460 --> 00:47.480
of 2019.

00:47.480 --> 00:50.620
Or as my sister might say, Christmas Eve Eve Eve.

00:50.620 --> 00:56.060
Or as DarkSakura might say, the first night of Hanukkah.

00:56.060 --> 00:58.900
Happy Hanukkah to you too.

00:58.900 --> 01:02.340
Are you willing to show that on stream for those that are watching live as we do tape

01:02.340 --> 01:07.800
live at twitch.tv slash vog network for voice the geeks network every Sunday night at six

01:07.800 --> 01:11.060
o'clock pacific nine o'clock eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

01:11.060 --> 01:14.260
And I was asking if DarkSakura would kindly step to the other side of the camera to show

01:14.260 --> 01:18.660
off her holiday sweater that she's wearing this Happy Lamaka Happy Lamaka, which I love

01:18.660 --> 01:19.660
it.

01:19.660 --> 01:20.660
It's cute.

01:20.660 --> 01:25.100
If I don't wear my pajamas to work on Friday on Wednesday, sorry for Christmas because

01:25.140 --> 01:27.500
I'm working Christmas because hello double and a half pay.

01:27.500 --> 01:28.500
Yeah, right.

01:28.500 --> 01:29.500
On a 10 hour shift.

01:29.500 --> 01:30.500
Yeah.

01:30.500 --> 01:31.500
Hello.

01:31.500 --> 01:32.500
I'd work too if I could for that kind of money.

01:32.500 --> 01:33.820
Um, I might either wear this or my onesie.

01:33.820 --> 01:34.820
I haven't decided.

01:34.820 --> 01:35.820
There you go.

01:35.820 --> 01:37.460
But I'm making latkes in two minutes.

01:37.460 --> 01:38.460
That's right.

01:38.460 --> 01:39.460
The latke countdown is on.

01:39.460 --> 01:40.460
Yeah.

01:40.460 --> 01:42.200
It's a, it's a holiday food festivity too actually.

01:42.200 --> 01:45.860
And I want to mention this because before the show we were chowing down one of our listeners

01:45.860 --> 01:51.660
stopped by the house because she's one of my ingress buddies and dropped off some nuts.

01:51.660 --> 01:56.260
So we've been enjoying some candied nuts, which we have been calling Deez Nuts.

01:56.260 --> 01:58.140
So we have been enjoying praline pecans.

01:58.140 --> 01:59.140
Yes they are.

01:59.140 --> 02:01.140
They are a praline pecans that we've been enjoying throughout the show.

02:01.140 --> 02:02.140
Oh, is that some chat?

02:02.140 --> 02:06.180
So show her a little love there for sharing Deez Nuts with us here on the show.

02:06.180 --> 02:07.180
Thank you.

02:07.180 --> 02:10.980
That's I believe that's the only way we can get away with showing nuts on camera here

02:10.980 --> 02:15.260
at the wonderful Twitch TV in the spirit of the holidays.

02:15.260 --> 02:16.260
All right.

02:16.260 --> 02:20.080
Uh, but of course I can't have a discussion about food and leave out the one and only

02:20.080 --> 02:21.080
tech master Loki.

02:21.080 --> 02:22.080
Sorry.

02:22.080 --> 02:23.080
I ate all the bread.

02:23.080 --> 02:24.080
Well, there's actually two breadsticks left.

02:24.080 --> 02:25.080
Two breadsticks.

02:25.080 --> 02:26.080
Oh, and the spirit of the holidays you're sharing.

02:26.080 --> 02:27.080
I'm just kidding.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.080
Yes.

02:28.080 --> 02:29.080
Cause I can't eat anymore.

02:29.080 --> 02:30.720
Well, I'm so full right now.

02:30.720 --> 02:34.700
And there's latkes coming cause dark soccer is, you know, we're all celebrating.

02:34.700 --> 02:39.080
We were celebrating all of the holiday things, um, especially when food's involved.

02:39.080 --> 02:40.080
Hello.

02:40.080 --> 02:43.720
So like I'll celebrate all the winter holidays, uh, by eating.

02:43.720 --> 02:46.640
So that's what we're going to do tonight is enjoy some latkes.

02:46.640 --> 02:47.640
I'm excited.

02:47.640 --> 02:48.640
So, um, yeah.

02:48.640 --> 02:53.240
It's the one time, it's the one time of year where I can say dark soccer.

02:53.240 --> 02:58.480
It's time to get in the kitchen and I'm not going to get yelled at.

02:58.480 --> 02:59.480
Yes.

02:59.480 --> 03:00.480
Dark soccer.

03:00.480 --> 03:01.480
It's time to get in the kitchen.

03:01.480 --> 03:02.480
Girl.

03:02.480 --> 03:03.480
All right.

03:03.480 --> 03:07.180
The only time of year that I can get away with that.

03:07.180 --> 03:12.960
Cause it's not look behind you in the little orange can in the orange can, right?

03:12.960 --> 03:16.840
It's going to be one of those nights, uh, folks that are tuning in and, uh, listening

03:16.840 --> 03:21.040
on the podcast feed, of course, uh, which you can check out for yourself, uh, wherever,

03:21.040 --> 03:27.440
uh, popular podcasts can be found such as, uh, Apple, iTunes and, um, Google, uh, store.

03:27.440 --> 03:30.080
Uh, what is the Android Google podcast?

03:30.080 --> 03:35.160
Uh, the only place we aren't on right now, we're not on stitcher because they kind of

03:35.160 --> 03:36.960
burned their bridges with us a few years ago.

03:36.960 --> 03:39.760
Uh, I'll tell you more about it some other time, although I've mentioned on the show

03:39.760 --> 03:42.200
in the past and we are not yet on Spotify.

03:42.200 --> 03:45.800
Uh, that is something that I'm hoping will be coming in 2020.

03:45.840 --> 03:47.760
So, uh, yeah, pretty cool.

03:47.760 --> 03:48.760
Anyway.

03:48.760 --> 03:50.000
So hello everybody in chat.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
I see all the love.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.640
I see some folks, um, uh, sharing some love for the sweater there.

03:55.640 --> 04:01.640
Uh, and it looks like, um, a bunch, one of our very, very kind listeners, she Hulk, uh,

04:01.640 --> 04:05.440
just somehow spammed out a bunch of emojis to folks that are watching live.

04:05.440 --> 04:06.440
So everybody was saying, thank you.

04:06.440 --> 04:07.440
Thank you.

04:07.440 --> 04:08.440
Thank you.

04:08.440 --> 04:09.440
So really appreciate that.

04:09.440 --> 04:12.320
She hoax always, uh, one of our generous folks that's here listening live.

04:12.320 --> 04:13.760
So anyway, let's get into it.

04:13.760 --> 04:17.760
The news is a little lighter this week when it comes to video games, which makes sense.

04:17.760 --> 04:19.760
I mean, with the holidays.

04:19.760 --> 04:24.160
Well, if you think this week is slow, we're going to be here next Sunday.

04:24.160 --> 04:28.800
That's I wouldn't expect hardly any news to come out this next week, but next week I'll

04:28.800 --> 04:29.800
tease you with this.

04:29.800 --> 04:34.520
Uh, we will be having our show where we can talk about the game of the year, but because

04:34.520 --> 04:36.240
it's 2019, yes.

04:36.240 --> 04:40.640
We also get to talk about the game of the decade and we can talk about the video game

04:40.640 --> 04:41.640
news stories.

04:41.640 --> 04:42.640
And, and.

04:42.640 --> 04:43.640
Okay.

04:43.640 --> 04:48.040
And, and I don't remember if this happens at the end of the year or the start of the

04:48.040 --> 04:51.520
next year, but we have the time capsule.

04:51.520 --> 04:54.720
Oh, I forgot about the time capsule.

04:54.720 --> 04:55.720
Oh shit.

04:55.720 --> 04:56.720
Okay.

04:56.720 --> 04:59.960
Well, depending, I don't want to promise the time capsule next week, but depending on the

04:59.960 --> 05:00.960
news.

05:00.960 --> 05:03.880
So if we're really light on news, we may just do time capsule next week because it's close

05:03.880 --> 05:04.880
enough to the end of the year.

05:04.880 --> 05:05.880
Yeah.

05:05.880 --> 05:06.880
I already think we did.

05:06.880 --> 05:07.880
So yes, that's right.

05:07.880 --> 05:08.880
We have time capsule.

05:08.880 --> 05:09.880
I forgot.

05:09.880 --> 05:10.880
I forgot about the fucking time caps.

05:10.880 --> 05:11.880
That's the point we forget every year.

05:11.880 --> 05:17.000
All right.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.040
So anyway, uh, very excited about that.

05:19.040 --> 05:22.240
So we'll be getting into the time capsule, uh, maybe next week or the week after, depending

05:22.240 --> 05:23.880
on how things are going.

05:23.880 --> 05:28.800
So anyhow, uh, let's get into our kickoff topic tonight, which has to do with the dual

05:28.800 --> 05:29.800
shock force.

05:29.800 --> 05:33.680
This actually is kind of a pretty big announcement for the end of the year.

05:33.680 --> 05:37.840
This is the type of thing you would have thought might've been coming for the holidays or something,

05:37.840 --> 05:39.840
but no, it decided to show up now.

05:39.840 --> 05:40.840
I'm sorry.

05:40.840 --> 05:46.320
My, when I say holidays, holiday shopping, meaning like it would have been out like black

05:46.320 --> 05:47.320
Friday.

05:47.320 --> 05:48.320
Yeah.

05:48.320 --> 05:49.320
Now we're getting it.

05:49.320 --> 05:50.320
The actual holiday a little close.

05:50.320 --> 05:51.320
So I'm not sure.

05:51.320 --> 05:54.120
Well, not even it's a next year.

05:54.120 --> 05:55.120
Yeah.

05:55.120 --> 05:56.120
We're getting the announcement now for next year.

05:56.120 --> 05:57.120
Yeah.

05:57.120 --> 05:58.120
So, yeah.

05:58.120 --> 06:02.040
So anyway, uh, the back button attachment was announced by Sony this past week.

06:02.040 --> 06:04.520
It actually has a little display on it, which is interesting.

06:04.520 --> 06:09.520
So it is, it's a display for the back of your controller, but that display will actually

06:09.520 --> 06:13.520
show you what you are mapping these back buttons to.

06:13.520 --> 06:17.120
So, and I guess what it can actually store different control schemes as well, which is

06:17.120 --> 06:18.120
interesting.

06:18.120 --> 06:22.240
Uh, it also works with PlayStation VR titles, which we, you know, would be expected right.

06:22.240 --> 06:27.480
And all that, uh, coming out on January 23rd and the attachment is going to be about $30.

06:27.480 --> 06:29.280
So um, yeah, interesting.

06:29.280 --> 06:30.280
What do you think about this?

06:30.280 --> 06:31.280
Loki?

06:31.280 --> 06:33.120
Oh no, it seems kind of unnecessary.

06:33.120 --> 06:38.320
I, I hate to say it, but I'm kind of in a very similar sort of boat where I'm like,

06:38.320 --> 06:42.860
I don't know if this is really necessary, but maybe that's because we haven't seen the

06:42.860 --> 06:47.120
games that are going to incorporate this as a mapping stuff.

06:47.120 --> 06:51.020
It seems like it's more of like this, like I'm going to be a competitive eat sports player

06:51.020 --> 06:52.600
and interesting.

06:52.600 --> 06:58.400
Um, I could see, well, uh, especially in a game like Final Fantasy 14, there's all sorts

06:58.400 --> 07:01.780
of weird ass button combinations because you know, that's a game that's designed with like

07:01.780 --> 07:05.520
keyboard and mouse, you know, although it works very well in controller, don't get me

07:05.520 --> 07:06.520
wrong.

07:06.520 --> 07:10.120
I would think that that attachment is going to lend itself very well to maybe doing some,

07:10.120 --> 07:12.000
some macros and that type of thing.

07:12.000 --> 07:17.680
But I mean, we don't, we, we don't think it has any separate functionality now, but it

07:17.680 --> 07:19.040
might later.

07:19.040 --> 07:23.320
Uh, and this kind of lends itself to something we were just talking about with our pal Bobby

07:23.320 --> 07:26.560
Black Wolf, um, who was just live on his program.

07:26.560 --> 07:30.840
And he was talking a little bit about how, um, his thought is that this could be an early

07:30.840 --> 07:33.120
thing for the PlayStation five.

07:33.120 --> 07:37.580
And part of the reason we're getting this now is because when the PlayStation five comes

07:37.580 --> 07:41.120
out, these controllers, you know, if you have this attachment, they can kind of lend themselves

07:41.120 --> 07:43.040
to the PlayStation five.

07:43.040 --> 07:47.360
And I guess it would also make sense for games because there's going to be some games that

07:47.360 --> 07:48.360
are going to be coming out.

07:48.360 --> 07:51.440
So for example, the final fantasy seven remake is a prime example.

07:51.440 --> 07:56.480
In my opinion, the final fantasy seven remake comes out and let's say it has functionality

07:56.480 --> 07:59.200
that incorporates those back button triggers into something new.

07:59.200 --> 08:02.000
I don't know what, you know, but something new.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.720
Well, that almost would guarantee we're going to see this on PlayStation five, because I'm

08:05.720 --> 08:09.480
telling you bank money on the fact that the final fantasy seven remake will be out on

08:09.480 --> 08:10.720
PlayStation five as well.

08:10.720 --> 08:17.160
It has to happen because this is only the first episode of more final fantasy seven

08:17.160 --> 08:22.120
games because this, uh, fantasy seven remake only goes through the Midgar portion of the

08:22.120 --> 08:23.120
game.

08:23.120 --> 08:28.780
So the plan is to do the rest of it at some point, but by then most gamers will have moved

08:28.780 --> 08:30.900
on to picking up a PlayStation five console.

08:30.900 --> 08:33.780
So whatever happens next will have to be on the PlayStation five.

08:33.780 --> 08:38.540
That's not even talking about what's going on in the Xbox world, but this controller

08:38.540 --> 08:40.700
news isn't about Xbox, it's about PlayStation.

08:40.700 --> 08:42.160
So we'll stick with that for now.

08:42.160 --> 08:47.300
So I'm looking at our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network, fifth dream today says,

08:47.300 --> 08:52.260
I'm going to use it to map the X button to the back so I can press it with my left hand

08:52.260 --> 08:59.900
to advance RPG text and eat with the right hand, actually, Hey, not a bad plan.

08:59.900 --> 09:06.700
You know, and I have to say, um, when I first saw this design, my mind went to accessibility

09:06.700 --> 09:11.620
and you're using it in a tongue in cheek way, but certainly for other gamers out there,

09:11.620 --> 09:15.380
maybe this is going to be something that makes a certain games and certain button presses

09:15.380 --> 09:19.260
and things, a more accessible thing, which is a very cool thing.

09:19.260 --> 09:23.980
And in my mind, I kind of went, Ooh, maybe this is some type of response to the Xbox

09:23.980 --> 09:25.780
accessibility controller.

09:25.780 --> 09:29.980
Now, of course it's not the same thing by any means, but maybe, okay, maybe they saw

09:29.980 --> 09:33.340
that an accessibility thing was really well received in attachment.

09:33.340 --> 09:38.620
So they wanted to do something similar so I could see that perspective as well.

09:38.620 --> 09:39.740
So I don't know.

09:39.740 --> 09:44.280
I don't think, I think if they wanted to do something like that as an accessibility thing,

09:44.280 --> 09:49.260
they would make it, it would be more robust, like the accessibility stuff with Xbox.

09:49.260 --> 09:53.740
This is kind of like, I think this is more of like, Hey, you know, we've seen some of

09:53.740 --> 09:57.300
these third-party controllers or even like with Microsoft, with their elite controller

09:57.300 --> 10:00.340
where they have these back button triggers and stuff.

10:00.340 --> 10:04.100
Let's get a piece of that action way too late in the game.

10:04.100 --> 10:08.580
Now of course, because this is our chat room in the spirit of Christmas, they're going,

10:08.580 --> 10:10.100
they're taking it to the toilet.

10:10.100 --> 10:11.100
Awesome.

10:11.100 --> 10:12.100
Yes.

10:12.100 --> 10:13.460
Beat me to it.

10:13.460 --> 10:18.140
Because fifth dream today was saying I could have used my left hand to advance RPG text

10:18.140 --> 10:19.900
and eat with the right hand.

10:19.900 --> 10:24.340
And Bobby Black Wolf merely responded in quotes, eat.

10:24.340 --> 10:26.700
And Bobby Black Wolf.

10:26.700 --> 10:29.780
He didn't say, he did not say visual novels.

10:29.780 --> 10:30.780
He said, RPG.

10:30.780 --> 10:35.040
Pod culture follows that up with the PlayStation fap attachment.

10:35.040 --> 10:36.140
So there we go.

10:36.140 --> 10:42.420
If those types of games are coming out, if a Hunie pop is announced for PlayStation,

10:42.420 --> 10:43.660
then maybe that will be a thing.

10:43.660 --> 10:44.660
I don't know.

10:44.660 --> 10:46.780
What are those adult games on Steam?

10:46.780 --> 10:47.780
I don't know.

10:47.780 --> 10:48.780
Like all of them.

10:48.780 --> 10:49.780
I mean, there's like so many.

10:50.660 --> 10:51.660
I don't think that was an adult game.

10:51.660 --> 10:52.660
Is it?

10:52.660 --> 10:53.660
I thought it was.

10:53.660 --> 10:54.660
Anyway.

10:54.660 --> 10:58.900
Pixelpaca says there was that one-handed RPG controller on PlayStation one.

10:58.900 --> 11:01.460
I seem to remember something like that too.

11:01.460 --> 11:04.900
So and dark soccer is trying to participate in the kitchen without a microphone, but she's

11:04.900 --> 11:05.900
saying she used one.

11:05.900 --> 11:07.340
When I had surgery on my hand.

11:07.340 --> 11:10.020
Oh, when she had surgery on her hand, she used one.

11:10.020 --> 11:15.640
So anyway, Pixelpaca's in chat says fun bag fantasy.

11:15.640 --> 11:17.420
That is a real game name on Steam.

11:17.460 --> 11:20.940
Well, of course, because if we're going to talk about the toilet, let's talk about Steam's

11:20.940 --> 11:26.220
library, which I'm sure you're all consuming during the wonderful Steam sale that's going

11:26.220 --> 11:27.220
on for the holidays.

11:27.220 --> 11:29.420
But I think we get into more on that later on.

11:29.420 --> 11:34.500
But anyway, She-Hulk in chat says the Xbox elite controller rocks.

11:34.500 --> 11:35.820
Maybe the best ever made.

11:35.820 --> 11:40.260
Well, good news for you, She-Hulk, is that with the next round of Xbox or the XX or the

11:40.260 --> 11:45.540
Xbox Series X, if you want to be legit, the controller that is bundled in with it is a

11:45.540 --> 11:47.860
lot more like an elite controller.

11:47.860 --> 11:51.700
It isn't exactly an elite controller, but like the D-Pad is more like what you see with

11:51.700 --> 11:52.700
the elite controller.

11:52.700 --> 11:57.420
So it's taking a lot of its cues from that controller and that it is a really nice controller.

11:57.420 --> 12:00.720
Let's you know, let's tell the truth here.

12:00.720 --> 12:04.700
It's a great controller, but a pair of back buttons and a screen on the back of the controller

12:04.700 --> 12:05.900
is not going to turn the PlayStation.

12:05.900 --> 12:09.340
But is that really worth spending another $30 for?

12:09.340 --> 12:11.320
As it is in my in my.

12:11.320 --> 12:14.040
That's like more than half the cost of the controller.

12:14.040 --> 12:15.200
Here's my opinion.

12:15.200 --> 12:21.040
For me in my current position, no, it's not worth it and I'm not going to pick one up.

12:21.040 --> 12:27.640
However, I think it's cool that it's out there as an option for potential accessibility issues.

12:27.640 --> 12:29.360
That's great.

12:29.360 --> 12:34.500
And if we see games incorporating it in the future and this whole PlayStation 5 theory

12:34.500 --> 12:39.360
kind of lends itself to light, then I'd probably be more likely to pick one up.

12:39.360 --> 12:44.480
However, if this is functionality that's just built into the PlayStation 5 controller,

12:44.480 --> 12:49.580
then I'm more likely to just pick up a PlayStation 5 and I'll have it built into whatever controller

12:49.580 --> 12:51.160
they release at that time.

12:51.160 --> 12:54.400
And that's when I'll finally have the back buttons or whatever that is.

12:54.400 --> 13:00.920
So anyway, She-Hulk continuing to lavish praise on the Xbox elite controller and chat saying

13:00.920 --> 13:04.680
my online gaming improved instantly, felt like I'm cheating with it.

13:04.680 --> 13:09.060
It is it is a nice piece of hardware, but I mean, you pay a premium for it.

13:09.060 --> 13:13.420
It's almost expensive as expensive as a console, but it is really, really well done.

13:13.420 --> 13:16.580
And I mean, the fact that you can use those on PCs as well, I mean, you know, it's pretty

13:16.580 --> 13:17.580
cool.

13:17.580 --> 13:18.580
So.

13:18.580 --> 13:19.580
All right.

13:19.580 --> 13:25.480
So a big no on this attachment, but yay that it exists from both of us here on camera.

13:25.480 --> 13:30.080
And I think Jamie, she's finishing up the lockers, but I think she, do you approve Dark

13:30.080 --> 13:31.080
Sakura of this?

13:31.080 --> 13:32.080
Sure.

13:32.080 --> 13:37.580
She says sure for this attachment, but I think more maybe the premonition of perhaps what's

13:37.580 --> 13:39.500
to come with PlayStation five.

13:39.500 --> 13:42.980
Let's let's marinate on that for a little bit.

13:42.980 --> 13:46.340
Thirty dollars for more junk in the trunk for my controller.

13:46.340 --> 13:50.500
Dark Sakura saying from the kitchen something that I had brought up a Bobby show that I

13:50.500 --> 13:51.500
forgot about.

13:51.500 --> 13:56.260
But talking about the Vita title implementation, because, you know, Vita had the back touch.

13:56.260 --> 14:02.220
Now, this is not the same thing because the PlayStation back attachment are buttons and

14:02.220 --> 14:06.020
the PlayStation four back was like you could swipe different directions.

14:06.020 --> 14:07.380
It was a touch pad.

14:07.380 --> 14:10.380
But a lot of games kind of used it like buttons.

14:10.380 --> 14:14.940
In fact, if you tried to emulate PlayStation two games on your Vita, you would have, there

14:14.940 --> 14:19.080
was no L2 and R2 so you had to use the back screen to kind of do that.

14:19.080 --> 14:26.140
So there is an argument to be made that this is, you know, something that could be opening

14:26.140 --> 14:31.340
the door to Vita support later down, down, down, down the line, but we'll, we'll see.

14:31.340 --> 14:36.740
So I guess we'll see as the games start to come out in 2020, pay attention to that Final

14:36.740 --> 14:37.940
Fantasy remake.

14:37.940 --> 14:41.420
I think that's going to be a very big barometer with that sort of thing.

14:41.420 --> 14:42.420
So, all right.

14:42.420 --> 14:44.300
Anything else on the back button attachment?

14:44.300 --> 14:45.300
I don't think so.

14:45.300 --> 14:48.340
So let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we

14:48.340 --> 14:49.820
have been playing this week.

14:49.820 --> 14:52.220
I think Dark Sakura is wrapping up the first batch of latkes.

14:52.220 --> 14:54.420
So I'm going to just go ahead and start with Loki while she finishes up.

14:54.420 --> 14:57.340
I didn't play jack shit.

14:57.340 --> 14:58.380
So I, no, I did.

14:58.380 --> 15:04.420
I played a little bit of Minecraft earth and a little bit of Pokemon go, but that's about

15:04.420 --> 15:05.420
it.

15:05.420 --> 15:06.420
I didn't really play any console games.

15:06.420 --> 15:11.900
I did pick up finally, um, only because my kids wanted me to, and I've been just holding

15:11.900 --> 15:15.820
off on it, but, um, Beat Saber.

15:15.820 --> 15:21.420
So I picked that up and, um, I'd recommend the green day stuff because I really, I did

15:21.420 --> 15:22.420
not.

15:22.420 --> 15:23.660
Um, I haven't picked up anything yet.

15:23.660 --> 15:29.220
I was going to get some of the tracks that they have as part of their, um, I forget what

15:29.220 --> 15:35.540
the label is, but the, there was some of the stuff from a robot.

15:35.540 --> 15:39.020
Was it a think a robot machine or something like that?

15:39.020 --> 15:41.060
That, uh, it was pretty cool.

15:41.060 --> 15:43.820
I've been listening to some of their tracks, monster cat, monster cat.

15:43.820 --> 15:44.820
Thank you.

15:44.820 --> 15:48.900
So yeah, the monster cat, um, music, I was thinking about picking up that pack, but I

15:48.900 --> 15:50.420
haven't done it yet.

15:50.420 --> 15:51.740
Um, it's good.

15:51.740 --> 15:52.740
I like the stuff.

15:52.740 --> 15:53.940
They have a couple of freebies too.

15:53.940 --> 15:54.940
Like the crab rave.

15:54.940 --> 15:55.940
Oh, that'd be cool.

15:55.940 --> 15:56.940
Yeah, that's fun.

15:57.140 --> 16:00.420
What I recommend though, if like you are looking to pick stuff up on the steam sale is go check

16:00.420 --> 16:04.640
Humble Bundle too, because Humble Bundle, when you do it through them, you also get like

16:04.640 --> 16:08.740
a certain percentage of that back onto your account as like a credit.

16:08.740 --> 16:11.140
So it actually ends up being slightly cheaper.

16:11.140 --> 16:12.820
Okay.

16:12.820 --> 16:15.900
So Lacas have set up the fire alarm.

16:15.900 --> 16:19.040
So Loki, you're going to have to fill time for yourself while I take care of this.

16:19.040 --> 16:24.620
So I mean, so basically I was just, um, you know, looking to get some games there.

16:24.620 --> 16:30.820
I didn't end up purchasing, uh, Earth Defense Force, um, Iron Rain.

16:30.820 --> 16:36.580
Almost purchased that, but, um, I just don't know if I'm going to get to it right away.

16:36.580 --> 16:38.360
And also the reviews aren't that great for it.

16:38.360 --> 16:39.360
So we'll see.

16:39.360 --> 16:40.860
Maybe it has to get a little bit cheaper than 29.99.

16:40.860 --> 16:46.100
Uh, what I did do today though, is I did introduce the kids to Cuzar finally.

16:46.100 --> 16:51.660
So we drove the hour away to the one place that has Cuzar nearby and went and played

16:51.660 --> 16:52.660
there.

16:52.860 --> 16:58.300
And unfortunately, even though it was an hour in the rain, both directions, uh, there wasn't

16:58.300 --> 17:02.140
really anybody else there because it's a Sunday during the day.

17:02.140 --> 17:06.700
Um, and no one really wants to play Cuzar apparently, but at least everything was in

17:06.700 --> 17:07.700
decent condition.

17:07.700 --> 17:10.060
Although the arena is surprisingly dark.

17:10.060 --> 17:14.600
I do not remember it being that dark and like when I went in there, I was like, are there

17:14.600 --> 17:15.600
lights out?

17:15.600 --> 17:21.180
I mean, I don't remember it being this dark, but, um, the kids picked it up really quickly

17:21.180 --> 17:25.980
and, and bless her heart, they said it's the most favorite, you know, laser tag game

17:25.980 --> 17:26.980
that they played.

17:26.980 --> 17:28.540
And I was like, cool.

17:28.540 --> 17:29.540
I'm sorry.

17:29.540 --> 17:31.180
I was dealing with the fire situation or smoke.

17:31.180 --> 17:32.180
It's smoke.

17:32.180 --> 17:35.860
It's just, it's not really, uh, the oil that she uses lock has makes a lot of smoke and

17:35.860 --> 17:37.020
we didn't have a window open.

17:37.020 --> 17:40.180
So it was building up under, there's a fire alarm just, can you even see it?

17:40.180 --> 17:42.740
You can actually see it on camera way in the corner there.

17:42.740 --> 17:43.860
And that's the one that was going on.

17:43.860 --> 17:44.860
So sorry.

17:44.860 --> 17:47.660
Um, so I'm sorry you took them to the one in Vacaville.

17:47.660 --> 17:48.660
Yes.

17:48.660 --> 17:49.660
Oh fun.

17:49.660 --> 17:50.660
Yeah.

17:51.140 --> 17:54.140
It was really worth the trip though, down there, just because the amount of time we

17:54.140 --> 17:57.680
got to actually spend there wasn't very long and there wasn't a whole lot of people there.

17:57.680 --> 18:00.580
Although they have a whole new arcade, like their arcade is like redone.

18:00.580 --> 18:01.660
Oh wow.

18:01.660 --> 18:06.500
Which not necessarily in the good sense, it's all of the giant, those huge, like kind of

18:06.500 --> 18:11.420
attraction games that they have like the, the huge, I'm not gambling, but it's the thing

18:11.420 --> 18:14.700
that you have to pull a lever on to spin something.

18:14.700 --> 18:17.700
It's it's gambling, um, ticket machines.

18:17.740 --> 18:21.980
And then they also had, um, the giant halo game that's there.

18:21.980 --> 18:23.380
Um, that was kind of cool.

18:23.380 --> 18:27.440
No DDR or anything or I think the last time I went there was in the groove too or something,

18:27.440 --> 18:28.940
but none of that anymore.

18:28.940 --> 18:34.580
Um, and of course, you know, the two kids working the counter for Qsar just didn't give

18:34.580 --> 18:35.780
a shit about Qsar.

18:35.780 --> 18:41.560
They, they gave him as much of a shit as the kids at the, um, local laser tag place here.

18:41.560 --> 18:43.420
So it's fine.

18:43.420 --> 18:44.420
You know, whatever.

18:44.420 --> 18:47.020
Um, well, they had fun.

18:47.020 --> 18:50.980
We played a couple of games and then drove back home because it's an hour drive in the

18:50.980 --> 18:52.780
rain and traffic.

18:52.780 --> 18:55.940
And so, um, yeah, it was fun.

18:55.940 --> 19:01.100
It's worth, it was worth it to get them to see that when I do it again, probably not,

19:01.100 --> 19:03.300
but I'll have to go down there at some point again.

19:03.300 --> 19:04.300
Okay.

19:04.300 --> 19:05.300
Fun.

19:05.300 --> 19:06.700
Um, let's see my gaming week.

19:06.700 --> 19:08.300
Um, a lot of similar stuff.

19:08.300 --> 19:13.140
I'm still playing Final Fantasy 14 as always, uh, been going on random blue mage adventures

19:13.140 --> 19:16.460
in that game because in one of the group chats I was in, they started talking about blue

19:16.460 --> 19:17.620
mage randomly.

19:17.620 --> 19:22.100
Um, and I was like, oh, I haven't really checked that out since, um, you know, it was first

19:22.100 --> 19:26.620
added into the storm blood expansion and I was kind of very lukewarm on it, but they

19:26.620 --> 19:27.740
added new content.

19:27.740 --> 19:32.260
So they added content up to level 60 so you can play a blue mage up to level 60 now.

19:32.260 --> 19:35.940
So I was like, okay, I'll go check it out and, you know, see what's different about

19:35.940 --> 19:36.940
it.

19:36.940 --> 19:41.180
And, uh, yeah, I, I still wish they would just let you play a blue mage in regular content

19:41.180 --> 19:45.800
and I'm not going to rehash the old arguments, but it's been a fun little diversion.

19:45.800 --> 19:47.320
It's something new to do in the game.

19:47.320 --> 19:50.640
I like that there's like a million different things you can do with Final Fantasy 14 besides

19:50.640 --> 19:52.080
just like rating.

19:52.080 --> 19:53.220
So I'll give them that.

19:53.220 --> 19:57.360
At least they've created a lot of fun side things to do, even if, you know, a blue mage

19:57.360 --> 19:59.900
should be part of the main content.

19:59.900 --> 20:03.460
I was going through my PlayStation account today because I was checking out the holiday

20:03.460 --> 20:05.520
sale to see if there was anything I wanted to buy.

20:05.520 --> 20:09.360
Um, and I just started randomly playing stuff on my PlayStation that I hadn't played in

20:09.360 --> 20:14.360
a while, like DJ Max Technica, which I still want to buy some of those DLC song packs,

20:14.360 --> 20:17.000
but they're really expensive still.

20:17.000 --> 20:22.080
So I'm like, I don't want to pay like 15 bucks because I really like one song in this pack.

20:22.080 --> 20:26.780
I did hear the DJ Max Technica is on the early release on PC, but I'm not, I'm not double

20:26.780 --> 20:28.080
dipping for that much money.

20:28.080 --> 20:31.860
They want, they want a like full price game for it and I'm not, I'm not going to double

20:31.860 --> 20:35.160
dip for that for like two new songs or whatever it is they have on PC.

20:35.160 --> 20:38.360
Uh, it's not enough licensed stuff to make it worth it to me.

20:38.360 --> 20:39.360
Sorry.

20:39.360 --> 20:43.300
Um, but I was playing that a little bit and then I was also playing, um, it's getting

20:43.300 --> 20:44.300
smoky in here again.

20:44.300 --> 20:45.300
I'm really worried.

20:45.300 --> 20:46.300
It's gonna, no, it's fine.

20:46.300 --> 20:47.300
It is.

20:47.300 --> 20:48.300
Is that the last batch you said?

20:48.300 --> 20:49.300
Okay.

20:49.300 --> 20:52.740
So hopefully it doesn't go off again, but I'm eyeing it suspiciously.

20:52.740 --> 20:56.580
This is why when I used to make super vacant that we'd have a dedicated fan to blow the

20:56.580 --> 20:59.220
smoke away from the smoke alarm.

20:59.220 --> 21:00.220
Yeah.

21:00.220 --> 21:01.220
I might.

21:01.220 --> 21:02.220
Okay.

21:02.220 --> 21:05.340
Well we'll see if, if it goes off again, Loki, you just need to fan it with your jacket out

21:05.340 --> 21:10.500
of there and it'll be just the calendar that we have that, that to, um, also a window.

21:10.500 --> 21:13.060
Alan opened a window in there and then I opened the window here.

21:13.060 --> 21:13.820
It'll be fine.

21:13.820 --> 21:14.820
It'll draft through.

21:14.820 --> 21:15.820
It's just going to take a minute.

21:15.820 --> 21:21.160
So anyway, um, patient pockets and chat says I double dip for DG max respect on steam.

21:21.160 --> 21:22.160
Was it worth it?

21:22.160 --> 21:23.160
Pay some pockets.

21:23.160 --> 21:25.420
I mean like truly like, do you enjoy it?

21:25.420 --> 21:26.540
Are you happy with that?

21:26.540 --> 21:32.020
Cause I mean, Lord knows I've doubled and triple dipped on things that maybe I shouldn't

21:32.020 --> 21:33.820
have, but I just liked the game that much.

21:33.820 --> 21:34.820
They did it.

21:34.820 --> 21:37.380
For example, Mass Effect three on Wii U.

21:37.380 --> 21:38.940
There was no point to me doing that.

21:38.940 --> 21:39.940
There really wasn't.

21:39.940 --> 21:47.620
Um, speaking, speaking of double dipping, um, I played Pac-Man championship edition

21:47.620 --> 21:52.340
on PlayStation four cause I already had it, but I also had the one on switch because the

21:52.340 --> 21:57.460
switch version came with the two player one, the CE plus or whatever it was called.

21:57.460 --> 22:01.460
I don't remember, but I remembered, Oh yeah, I have this on PlayStation and because I've

22:01.460 --> 22:05.140
been playing a lot on switch, I got better and I was like, what are these trophies?

22:05.140 --> 22:06.140
I don't have a lot.

22:06.140 --> 22:08.540
I only have to get an a on expert mode to get a gold.

22:08.540 --> 22:09.700
I should be able to do that.

22:09.700 --> 22:14.220
And I did, and I actually got two golds to get a gold for B and a gold for a.

22:14.220 --> 22:15.220
So it was like, cool.

22:15.220 --> 22:17.420
If I could get an S getting an S is really hard.

22:17.420 --> 22:18.980
I could probably do it.

22:18.980 --> 22:24.100
Um, cause I've done it on a beginner or whatever they call the first single train mode, but

22:24.100 --> 22:28.060
I haven't done it on a expert mode, which is it's hard.

22:28.060 --> 22:29.920
Expert mode is a lot of luck is involved.

22:29.920 --> 22:33.060
I think that's why some people get really annoyed with championship edition too.

22:33.060 --> 22:37.560
Cause there's a lot of luck involved in it, especially when the ghosts go on rails.

22:37.560 --> 22:43.200
So anyway, um, so I was playing a little bit of that and um, I think that's really about

22:43.200 --> 22:44.560
it for my gaming week.

22:44.560 --> 22:46.560
I don't think there was a lot of extra stuff really.

22:46.560 --> 22:50.000
Uh, trying to think, Oh, uh, the cell phone gaming stuff.

22:50.000 --> 22:53.380
So, um, I was actually going to ask you, cause you mentioned Minecraft earth, but the smoke

22:53.380 --> 22:54.560
alarm thing threw me off.

22:54.560 --> 22:58.440
Uh, I've noticed that some updates for Minecraft earth came down to my phone.

22:58.440 --> 23:00.960
Have they actually updated, changed anything in it?

23:00.960 --> 23:03.660
They have an event going on right now for like the holidays.

23:03.660 --> 23:09.940
So they have, you can get the, the jolly llama, which I did get and they've got like snow

23:09.940 --> 23:13.220
and stuff like that, that they're adding like blocks that you can get.

23:13.220 --> 23:16.440
I haven't really done any of the adventures recently to see if those are different, but

23:16.440 --> 23:18.020
other than that, that's kind of it.

23:18.020 --> 23:19.020
Oh, that's fun.

23:19.020 --> 23:20.020
Did you hurt yourself?

23:20.020 --> 23:21.020
I burned my knuckle.

23:21.020 --> 23:22.020
Oh no.

23:22.020 --> 23:23.020
Do you need anything?

23:23.020 --> 23:25.820
No, it's just the oil popped and it's fine.

23:25.820 --> 23:28.980
I ran it under the cool tap, but I should have run it longer.

23:28.980 --> 23:29.980
Yeah.

23:29.980 --> 23:30.980
It's anyway.

23:30.980 --> 23:33.100
Well, if you feel you can do it, why don't you tell us about your gaming week?

23:33.540 --> 23:35.540
Um, I played some, uh, did my shirt melt?

23:35.540 --> 23:36.540
No.

23:36.540 --> 23:37.540
Okay.

23:37.540 --> 23:40.540
I played, um, uh, Pokemon, uh, sword and that's about it.

23:40.540 --> 23:45.940
Um, I finally deleted, uh, idle pouring, so I'm no longer playing the Ragnarok thing.

23:45.940 --> 23:46.940
Freedom.

23:46.940 --> 23:50.180
Um, I started playing Orna.

23:50.180 --> 23:51.820
Kind of bored.

23:51.820 --> 23:54.260
That was like, that was like me, sorry, really quickly.

23:54.260 --> 23:59.540
That was me when I uninstalled Diablo three, it was like, Oh my God, it's like this sudden

23:59.540 --> 24:01.680
freedom I was feeling.

24:01.680 --> 24:04.720
I'm trying Orna out and it's, it's okay.

24:04.720 --> 24:07.720
I am not having a burden knuckle.

24:07.720 --> 24:11.780
You need to get, you need to join his that's party cause then she just plays and it power

24:11.780 --> 24:13.920
levels you to like 80 in a minute.

24:13.920 --> 24:17.620
Well, I'm already like 60 so wow.

24:17.620 --> 24:18.620
That's way further than I got.

24:18.620 --> 24:19.620
Good for you.

24:19.620 --> 24:22.120
I got to like a level 10, something like that.

24:22.120 --> 24:23.120
Okay.

24:23.120 --> 24:26.760
Um, cause I wanted, I wanted a sorceress or witch.

24:26.760 --> 24:27.760
I got to witch.

24:27.760 --> 24:29.920
I'm next up a sorceress, but I have to earn more Orna.

24:29.920 --> 24:30.920
Okay.

24:31.160 --> 24:35.400
But, um, I'm still doing Pokemon go, I'm still doing the Harry Potter game, but I am no longer

24:35.400 --> 24:39.600
ever going to spend any money on the Harry Potter game again because I am not going to

24:39.600 --> 24:41.320
give my money to a turf.

24:41.320 --> 24:43.540
Um, does she get money from that?

24:43.540 --> 24:46.200
She gets money from everything with her licenses on it.

24:46.200 --> 24:51.100
I liked your idea of taking it back and just giving it to the fans, the fans, but still

24:51.100 --> 24:52.560
financial support.

24:52.560 --> 24:54.160
I don't feel right doing it.

24:54.160 --> 24:58.800
I'm not going to contribute any money to a franchise that supports a turf.

24:58.800 --> 24:59.800
Yeah.

24:59.800 --> 25:03.680
It's unfortunate that she, um, opened her big mouth to say that.

25:03.680 --> 25:05.480
And also Ricky Gervais him as well.

25:05.480 --> 25:08.320
I already knew he was garbage, but now he's even hotter garbage.

25:08.320 --> 25:09.320
Did you see that thing?

25:09.320 --> 25:11.880
And again, I'm not, I don't want to sound like I'm justifying those comments at all

25:11.880 --> 25:15.000
cause I'm not, but I thought this was an interesting perspective.

25:15.000 --> 25:22.620
I saw an article that tried to talk about like British culture and how that might have

25:22.620 --> 25:26.120
an impact on it and some of the things that are going on in Britain.

25:26.120 --> 25:34.680
Yeah, but we also have Boris Johnson and the people that support that garbage.

25:34.680 --> 25:36.720
It's the same thing that's happening over here.

25:36.720 --> 25:41.400
So anyway, uh, pistol pockets and chat says me says nothing.

25:41.400 --> 25:43.480
JK Rowling says some goddamn bullshit.

25:43.480 --> 25:44.480
Yeah.

25:44.480 --> 25:45.480
That's pretty much what it felt like.

25:45.480 --> 25:47.400
Uh, Bobby Lockwell says, LOL.

25:47.400 --> 25:48.760
We're still playing Orna here.

25:48.760 --> 25:49.760
Okay.

25:49.760 --> 25:52.840
So I mentioned this game just like quickly in passing and then like all of you picked

25:52.840 --> 25:55.080
it up and started playing it, which is interesting to me.

25:55.080 --> 25:56.080
What's Orna.

25:56.120 --> 25:57.120
Orna is okay.

25:57.120 --> 25:59.200
So I went on like a GPS game binge.

25:59.200 --> 26:01.600
So one of our listeners lives here.

26:01.600 --> 26:02.600
It's her nuts.

26:02.600 --> 26:03.600
Okay.

26:03.600 --> 26:04.600
So the nut lady.

26:04.600 --> 26:05.600
Okay.

26:05.600 --> 26:13.280
Um, she, uh, showed this game to me, this Orna, which it uses GPS, but, um, Oh, that's

26:13.280 --> 26:14.280
the RPG one.

26:14.280 --> 26:15.280
You're right.

26:15.280 --> 26:16.280
It's like an RPG.

26:16.280 --> 26:19.920
It uses like classic eight bit graphic looking things, but it's on like a, and I just realized

26:19.920 --> 26:22.200
I can't really show the camera cause it might show where I live.

26:22.200 --> 26:23.200
Oops.

26:23.200 --> 26:25.960
It has a lovely piano soundtrack.

26:25.960 --> 26:30.200
Um, but, uh, yeah, you can see how there's like little things.

26:30.200 --> 26:31.200
Yeah.

26:31.200 --> 26:32.200
That's right.

26:32.200 --> 26:35.400
Remember you showed that it's like a, it's like a classic RPG, but the, the stores and

26:35.400 --> 26:38.120
stuff are out in the real world.

26:38.120 --> 26:43.120
So for example, I was complaining that there wasn't a store near my house or whatever.

26:43.120 --> 26:49.520
So as that she came by here, she built a store out front cause I guess she could do that

26:49.520 --> 26:50.920
at a certain level.

26:50.920 --> 26:53.160
So now I have a store right here on my house.

26:53.160 --> 26:54.160
Yeah.

26:54.160 --> 26:55.160
Which is great.

26:55.160 --> 26:59.140
So, uh, luckily there's a lot of stores, so I'm not like giving away my address or anything

26:59.140 --> 27:04.020
and it's like, you can, I'll tell you, there's a, there's a place that you can go to where

27:04.020 --> 27:06.440
there's like 20 stores like all of that.

27:06.440 --> 27:10.360
And I'm like, you can just guess that an Orna player lives there.

27:10.360 --> 27:11.360
So there you go.

27:11.360 --> 27:15.760
Um, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, we love it because there's no ads and we can just

27:15.760 --> 27:17.500
play it while sitting in our house.

27:17.500 --> 27:20.080
We, we built a store in my front yard.

27:20.200 --> 27:24.240
Uh, Bobby says I'm level 82 and my life wife is level 84.

27:24.240 --> 27:25.240
Wow.

27:25.240 --> 27:27.000
I may have to pick that up and try it.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.000
Yeah.

27:28.000 --> 27:32.140
I didn't, I got to admit, I'm not like super into it cause I just don't think the GPS stuff

27:32.140 --> 27:39.720
is that, um, engrossing, but it is a nice little like, thank you, dark sucker.

27:39.720 --> 27:45.880
It is a nice little like mindless, like, Oh, I'm just gonna, you know, sit on the toilet

27:45.880 --> 27:52.280
and you know, tap kill, kill, die, die, die, and you know, all the, um, uh, slimes and

27:52.280 --> 27:54.400
goblins and orcs and things that are on the house.

27:54.400 --> 27:56.960
So there you go.

27:56.960 --> 27:59.120
So that was pretty much it for my gaming week.

27:59.120 --> 28:02.320
Um, so dark soccer, did we get everything for your gaming week?

28:02.320 --> 28:03.800
You talked about, okay, so we're good.

28:03.800 --> 28:07.000
So let's move on and get into some gaming news.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.580
And I want to at least try one of these latkes here.

28:09.580 --> 28:11.160
The dark soccer has made.

28:11.160 --> 28:15.320
So Loki, while I jump into food here, tell us about our first story tonight.

28:15.320 --> 28:20.640
So, uh, Borderlands three is coming or is out on Stadia.

28:20.640 --> 28:25.520
And one of the things with Stadia, the advantage to that platform is supposed to be, Hey, you

28:25.520 --> 28:29.440
know what, you can just get into your game and play it and you don't have to worry about

28:29.440 --> 28:31.000
downloading updates.

28:31.000 --> 28:36.080
It's just as updated as it could possibly be, except that it's not.

28:36.080 --> 28:42.020
So what happened was is the Stadia version, um, that's out currently is the one that they

28:42.020 --> 28:47.220
released the version that came out October 24th, um, which is when they had like their

28:47.220 --> 28:49.820
Halloween themed bloody harvest event.

28:49.820 --> 28:55.620
So apparently there's several, uh, hot fixes and patches that have been added since then,

28:55.620 --> 29:01.100
but those aren't available right now through, uh, Stadia and they're saying they're expecting,

29:01.100 --> 29:04.620
for example, like Moxie's heist of handsome jackpot.

29:04.620 --> 29:09.420
Um, that's supposed to be expected on Stadia early 2020.

29:09.420 --> 29:15.040
So it's, it's like, yeah, it, you, it will download the updates for free or add the updates,

29:15.040 --> 29:21.420
but there's going to be a delay between the PC version or the console version and Stadia,

29:21.420 --> 29:28.820
which I mean, it really doesn't need any more reasons not to purchase games through there.

29:28.820 --> 29:32.380
Considering that, like, I don't even know what the cost is for this game right now through

29:32.380 --> 29:36.140
Stadia, but all I can tell you right now is it's marked down everywhere else because of

29:36.140 --> 29:37.780
the holidays and sales.

29:37.780 --> 29:44.500
So like maybe I should have just purchased it elsewhere.

29:44.500 --> 29:51.580
This is just another like yikes thing in Stadia's column to me when Google Stadia doesn't seem

29:51.580 --> 29:55.780
to have a lot of real positive steam going its direction when we talk about a lot of

29:55.780 --> 30:01.620
the buzz online, that's not to say the internet makes up the majority of, you know, what actually

30:01.620 --> 30:04.240
sells out there and that sort of thing.

30:04.240 --> 30:08.780
Because like, for example, I think Bobby was talking about on his show, he had a friend

30:08.780 --> 30:13.560
or a coworker or something that's like all about Stadia because, you know, if it, it's

30:13.560 --> 30:17.800
one of those things where like, if it uniquely works for your situation, then it really works

30:17.800 --> 30:18.880
for your situation.

30:18.880 --> 30:19.880
You know what I mean?

30:19.880 --> 30:20.880
Yeah, I get it.

30:20.880 --> 30:25.160
But like, I'm curious to see what their numbers are and the fact that those numbers haven't

30:25.160 --> 30:30.420
been like thrown out there like, oh yeah, it's great, tells me it's not great.

30:30.420 --> 30:35.940
So I will have to wait and see when the next Google conference is going to be when they'll

30:35.940 --> 30:41.180
talk about Stadia numbers, if they talk about Stadia numbers and what's coming towards that

30:41.180 --> 30:43.060
you know, that platform or whatever.

30:43.060 --> 30:47.420
But they're gonna have to do a lot more to it just to get people's buy-in on that.

30:47.420 --> 30:55.160
Because right now it's just kind of, eh, I don't know, they like, just if you can't afford

30:55.160 --> 31:00.380
to like game on those consoles right now, I mean, we're talking about like this generation

31:00.380 --> 31:02.460
and we're getting into a new generation of consoles.

31:02.460 --> 31:06.340
I mean, you can always purchase the last generation of consoles and there's a lot of games out

31:06.340 --> 31:09.460
there that are going to be marked down or much cheaper.

31:09.460 --> 31:15.100
I mean, I don't know that you really necessarily need to, I wouldn't necessarily want to dump

31:15.100 --> 31:18.800
money into a platform that I don't know is going to be around, especially if a digital

31:18.800 --> 31:23.180
platform that if it goes under, then you're kind of stuck.

31:23.180 --> 31:30.220
Whereas, you know, if my PlayStation 4, if for some reason Sony's PlayStation network

31:30.220 --> 31:34.660
infrastructure went down, I could probably still play my games through my console, even

31:34.660 --> 31:36.260
though they'd be offline.

31:36.260 --> 31:37.340
So I don't know.

31:37.340 --> 31:40.580
I think it's not very promising.

31:40.580 --> 31:43.300
Yeah, I will.

31:43.300 --> 31:44.300
Yeah.

31:44.300 --> 31:47.500
If they were to put out some big numbers, I think you're right, then we'd know that

31:47.500 --> 31:49.020
like it's doing really, really well.

31:49.020 --> 31:54.500
But to be fair to Google, this whole thing that they were releasing was supposed to be

31:54.500 --> 31:56.420
like an early access thing.

31:56.420 --> 32:01.700
And yeah, you know, the console or whatever, my quotey fingers, the console is supposed

32:01.700 --> 32:03.740
to be free, right?

32:03.740 --> 32:13.740
So when we actually see the version of this that is playable for free, we'll see what

32:13.740 --> 32:14.740
it looks like.

32:14.740 --> 32:17.740
The adoption rate looks like then, like how many people are actually paying some money

32:17.740 --> 32:21.860
to be able to play these games in their browsers and so forth that almost curious to remember

32:21.860 --> 32:25.820
how they were saying like to get the most out of the stadia stuff as far as like this,

32:25.820 --> 32:29.740
you know, they're talking about their controller and how it's Wi-Fi and how it, you know, that's

32:29.740 --> 32:32.180
going to have the least amount of latency available.

32:32.180 --> 32:35.500
I'd be curious to see like the comparison between that and other controllers, too, because

32:35.500 --> 32:39.020
I think that's that's a bunch of hot bullshit right there.

32:39.020 --> 32:43.300
What they're trying to say, you know, oh, by your one hundred nine dollar controller.

32:43.300 --> 32:46.500
I don't buy that for one minute, but.

32:46.700 --> 32:52.740
I don't know, I'm just very curious to why someone would want to purchase games through

32:52.740 --> 32:58.340
stadia versus like actually buying a console aside from, you know, saving the two hundred

32:58.340 --> 33:04.180
three hundred dollars on a next gen or on a console or if they're thinking, oh, well,

33:04.180 --> 33:09.300
I'm going to avoid, you know, buying, you know, a high end PC or console next generation.

33:09.300 --> 33:11.140
I'm just going to download games through stadia.

33:11.940 --> 33:13.060
I don't know, like I.

33:14.260 --> 33:19.620
I don't know if that's going to be really big advantage as far as being able to save

33:19.620 --> 33:24.420
money, the portability I can see if I traveled more for work, I travel a little bit for work,

33:24.420 --> 33:28.580
but not enough, but if I traveled maybe a little bit more than I do, I could see, you

33:28.580 --> 33:32.940
know, oh, if all I need to pack is a tablet and a little controller and then I can play

33:32.940 --> 33:36.780
Google stadia stuff like that's what makes a switch awfully convenient for traveling.

33:36.780 --> 33:40.020
Right. The switch is, you know, it's it's got that portability to it.

33:40.100 --> 33:41.860
You know, you can easily pack it away or whatever.

33:41.860 --> 33:43.860
And then when I'm at home, I can play it on the big TV.

33:43.860 --> 33:47.620
I could see an argument like that being made for stadia is that like, you know, if you

33:47.620 --> 33:51.540
are on the road a lot and maybe you don't have a living room in the traditional sense

33:51.540 --> 33:56.020
that you're in most of your time, then maybe a tablet and a controller would go a long

33:56.020 --> 33:59.460
way in being able to stay current on the latest and greatest in gaming.

33:59.460 --> 34:05.860
Yeah, but I can't imagine, though, that that subset of people that play games is that huge.

34:05.860 --> 34:10.900
Like it's like, well, this is good if you don't if you you don't this, this, this, this,

34:10.900 --> 34:12.420
this and this, this, this.

34:12.420 --> 34:19.060
It's like it's such a narrow scope for stadia that I just don't see it ever doing.

34:19.060 --> 34:24.340
Even if it was most successful with that narrow scope, I don't see it is performing as

34:24.340 --> 34:25.860
well as like other consoles.

34:25.860 --> 34:29.620
Like I just I'm very skeptical to see where this is going to go.

34:29.620 --> 34:36.820
And I just feel that it's it's a nice idea, but I think it's way too early for it to be

34:36.820 --> 34:37.460
implemented.

34:37.460 --> 34:42.420
I don't think our Internet structure infrastructure is what it needs to be to implement this

34:42.420 --> 34:42.900
correctly.

34:42.900 --> 34:47.940
If it was just like no bandwidth caps whatsoever and like everything's super fast, you know,

34:47.940 --> 34:51.780
all the time, like I could take my phone and I have no trouble whatsoever streaming content

34:51.780 --> 34:58.180
to it like really 4K content to my phone no matter where I am, like over the air, whatever

34:58.180 --> 35:00.020
in this perfect world that we exist.

35:00.020 --> 35:03.540
Then, yes, that would sound pretty cool, but we don't live in that world yet.

35:03.540 --> 35:06.100
But, you know, we're talking about stories of the decade and so forth.

35:06.100 --> 35:12.100
You know, I would I would guarantee by 2029, we're going to have Internet as fast as cable

35:12.100 --> 35:16.180
now over the air because that stuff is coming, you know, and I see that comment in chat from

35:16.180 --> 35:19.700
She-Hulk 10, who in chat says Internet at most hotels is terrible.

35:19.700 --> 35:20.340
True.

35:20.340 --> 35:23.860
So it probably, you know, lends a little strike against that story I proposed.

35:23.860 --> 35:27.860
But and this is another maybe thing in the column of well, maybe stadia is just a little

35:27.860 --> 35:32.660
bit early because, again, 10 years from now or I would gather sooner than that.

35:32.660 --> 35:37.940
But, you know, certainly in 10 years from now, 5G or maybe even whatever is after 5G

35:37.940 --> 35:41.460
is going to be even more out there and around and so forth.

35:41.460 --> 35:45.540
And so it's not going to matter if the Internet connection to your hotel is shit because you're

35:45.540 --> 35:50.180
going to have a great Internet connection through the magic of the air and so forth.

35:51.140 --> 35:53.780
I mean, yeah, I hope that's what ends up being at some point.

35:53.940 --> 35:58.340
But I don't have my 5G now, so I can't really say.

35:58.340 --> 35:59.220
Yeah, I know it's hard.

35:59.220 --> 36:03.380
It's hard to see with Verizon talking about like, hey, 5G, 5G is the future.

36:03.380 --> 36:06.500
I'm like, is it outside of the middle of Sacramento?

36:07.460 --> 36:08.660
No, really.

36:08.660 --> 36:10.500
Only one kind of 5G I care about.

36:10.500 --> 36:11.940
And that's 5G is in my pocket.

36:12.740 --> 36:14.020
And let's be real.

36:14.020 --> 36:17.300
And I know you guys I already know the sour face that many of you are going to make when

36:17.300 --> 36:17.700
I say it.

36:17.700 --> 36:19.140
But it is the absolute truth.

36:19.700 --> 36:22.900
5G doesn't matter until the Apple phone comes out that supports 5G.

36:22.900 --> 36:25.540
Well, and also 5G doesn't matter because it doesn't work very well through walls.

36:25.540 --> 36:27.940
And apparently it only works well if you're staying in the middle of the street.

36:27.940 --> 36:29.700
So so there's still a lot of kinks.

36:29.700 --> 36:30.740
There's a lot of kinks to work out.

36:30.740 --> 36:31.220
Yeah.

36:31.220 --> 36:32.340
So anyway.

36:33.140 --> 36:33.380
Yeah.

36:33.380 --> 36:36.900
Bobby Black Wolf says this sounds like what a lot of people were saying about steam in

36:36.900 --> 36:38.020
2003.

36:38.020 --> 36:41.700
I don't want to download DVD sized games on my 56 K modem.

36:41.700 --> 36:42.020
Yeah.

36:42.020 --> 36:48.180
Take this clip and put it in the time capsule and we'll play it on episode 1500 in 2029.

36:48.180 --> 36:54.260
And we'll see how far the Internet's come.

36:54.260 --> 36:56.020
What do you mean your show's not holographic?

36:56.020 --> 36:56.900
What the hell is this?

36:59.620 --> 37:00.100
All right.

37:00.100 --> 37:06.180
Anyway, let's move on and talk about speaking of like consoles and new consoles.

37:06.180 --> 37:09.860
There's a Nintendo Switch inspired console.

37:09.860 --> 37:14.660
And by inspired, I mean it's kind of a rip off allegedly.

37:14.660 --> 37:16.980
Like I'm not supposed to say it's a rip off.

37:16.980 --> 37:17.940
It is a rip off.

37:18.420 --> 37:19.540
The views and opinions expressed.

37:20.100 --> 37:24.340
But let's just say it looks like a Switch and the logo looks a lot like a Switch.

37:24.340 --> 37:27.380
It's kind of surprising that Nintendo hasn't shut this shit down.

37:28.340 --> 37:30.820
Thanks to you guys on Discord for bringing this to my attention.

37:30.820 --> 37:34.900
And if you want to join our Discord, just go to vognetwork.com.

37:34.900 --> 37:37.140
VOGnetwork.com slash Discord.

37:37.140 --> 37:42.740
And you can share stories for consideration on the show when it talks about these clone

37:42.740 --> 37:44.420
systems that tend to come out.

37:44.420 --> 37:47.620
Yeah, we get systems that look like things, but they aren't really things.

37:47.620 --> 37:50.580
So now there is a Nannika Smich.

37:52.820 --> 37:56.500
That sounds like a Simpsons parody of some sort, doesn't it?

37:56.500 --> 37:57.620
I just need to go Nannika.

37:58.260 --> 37:58.980
What's that?

37:58.980 --> 37:59.780
The Nyan Cat.

37:59.780 --> 38:00.820
That's what that means.

38:00.820 --> 38:01.460
Oh.

38:01.460 --> 38:02.100
Nannika?

38:02.100 --> 38:02.580
Like what?

38:04.260 --> 38:05.300
The Nyan Cat.

38:06.180 --> 38:08.260
So it's what Smich?

38:09.460 --> 38:10.180
Like what bitch?

38:13.140 --> 38:14.340
That's what this console is.

38:14.340 --> 38:15.380
What bitch?

38:15.380 --> 38:15.880
What?

38:18.260 --> 38:22.340
It and it has a blue controller on one side and a red like the other and they look like

38:22.340 --> 38:23.300
they disconnect.

38:23.300 --> 38:23.860
They do.

38:23.860 --> 38:27.940
Anyway, also there's a flying Mario on the front of the box.

38:28.660 --> 38:33.220
So this is very clearly just boldly infringing on copyright.

38:33.220 --> 38:38.100
And apparently, if you actually hook this thing up, it's just downloaded and ripped

38:38.100 --> 38:39.380
ROMs as well.

38:39.380 --> 38:39.700
Right.

38:39.700 --> 38:42.740
So they actually have a little bit more details on some of the other sites here.

38:42.740 --> 38:45.380
So I was like, where are they finding?

38:45.380 --> 38:46.900
Are they finding this thing at flea markets?

38:47.300 --> 38:48.340
I don't know.

38:48.340 --> 38:51.540
But here they have like actual gameplay video of it and stuff.

38:51.540 --> 38:52.020
Probably wish.

38:52.580 --> 38:54.980
So like here's the description on the actual box.

38:54.980 --> 38:57.540
So it says, you know, easy to use.

38:57.540 --> 39:04.180
Connect the RCA cables to TV and power cable to the power or play portable mode.

39:04.180 --> 39:06.500
And it says 800 games installed.

39:06.500 --> 39:13.460
Mario Brews Bomberman against Double Dragon Adventure Island and many more.

39:14.340 --> 39:17.380
Um, it is got a five and a half inch screen.

39:18.100 --> 39:19.460
And, uh, yeah.

39:19.460 --> 39:23.300
So basically pixel pakas with the throwback in our chat.

39:23.300 --> 39:25.220
They're finding it on Soulja Boy store.

39:27.540 --> 39:27.940
Good one.

39:28.500 --> 39:28.980
Not yet.

39:28.980 --> 39:30.500
Probably that's coming soon.

39:30.500 --> 39:31.060
Yeah.

39:31.060 --> 39:35.220
Uh, but no, basically it's like one of those, uh, emulators.

39:35.220 --> 39:38.420
It's got their have gameplay of looks like they're playing like Pac-Man.

39:38.420 --> 39:43.540
It looks like it's one of those multi, uh, ROM carts or whatever that's inside there.

39:44.100 --> 39:47.620
So, but I'm saying this isn't exactly the thing you're going to find on a shelf at target.

39:47.620 --> 39:48.900
Like, no, no.

39:48.900 --> 39:54.100
God, this is clearly, this is like one of those small kiosks that sell this shady shit.

39:54.100 --> 39:56.180
This was probably about four years ago.

39:56.180 --> 39:58.740
I went to the flea market, right?

39:58.740 --> 40:00.260
The huge one out in Roseville.

40:00.260 --> 40:05.700
And I swear, like I saw at least six different boosts there that were selling.

40:05.700 --> 40:09.540
Like it was a Nintendo 64 controller looking thing, but it plugged into your TV.

40:09.540 --> 40:11.860
And it was, they were just straight up playing Super Mario Brothers on it.

40:13.300 --> 40:16.580
I bought one of those for my friends one time for Christmas.

40:16.580 --> 40:18.740
If you want to see reviews on a lot of this though,

40:18.740 --> 40:21.860
one of my favorite channels on YouTube right now is Retro Core.

40:21.860 --> 40:26.500
He does the battle of the ports, um, which is sometimes where I get ideas for classic game.

40:26.500 --> 40:31.860
But, um, he also does like the, the, um, Chinese bootleg device reviews.

40:31.860 --> 40:32.660
Like the V?

40:32.660 --> 40:34.580
And they send, they send him some.

40:36.420 --> 40:36.920
Weird.

40:37.460 --> 40:39.940
But, and he's very honest about it.

40:39.940 --> 40:44.740
He'll like, if it's a handheld that maybe connects to a TV, like has a TV tuner on it,

40:44.740 --> 40:48.820
he'll, um, do both versions before doing it through a capture card.

40:48.820 --> 40:51.220
And some of them are good.

40:51.220 --> 40:57.620
You know, I still probably wouldn't buy one, but I like actually seeing the reviews of them

40:57.620 --> 41:03.140
to see just how far the little bootleggers have come in their emulation.

41:03.140 --> 41:08.180
So if I'm, if I'm hearing this right, this thing actually does still have the switch

41:08.180 --> 41:10.500
concept of you can play the ROMs on the little screen

41:10.500 --> 41:12.660
or you can plug it in and it goes on the TV, right?

41:12.660 --> 41:13.460
I believe so.

41:13.460 --> 41:15.780
I think, I don't know if he necessarily can, like,

41:17.300 --> 41:19.620
like put in a dock and it goes to the screen.

41:19.620 --> 41:25.140
I think it's more of you can hook up like, well, you can hook up AV cables to it and it goes into

41:25.140 --> 41:25.460
a screen.

41:25.460 --> 41:28.660
Oh, if there's something plugged in the, because yeah, they said that there's RCA.

41:29.380 --> 41:29.880
Okay.

41:31.140 --> 41:32.500
Not as fancy as a dock.

41:33.620 --> 41:34.340
I see.

41:34.340 --> 41:36.580
I mean, maybe the controllers are wireless.

41:36.580 --> 41:42.820
Um, I mean, assume because it says four, four triple A batteries for the controllers.

41:42.820 --> 41:47.140
Well, they call it say controls rechargeable battery for the screen and strap and power

41:47.140 --> 41:48.980
cable in AVC.

41:48.980 --> 41:51.060
So it doesn't really power very well either.

41:51.060 --> 41:54.500
Uh, darted C and chat with a zinger saying, uh, but look at it this way.

41:54.500 --> 41:58.420
It might have more games than Nintendo switches, online service, but I'm bummed.

41:59.540 --> 42:00.580
You can definitely play more.

42:00.820 --> 42:04.500
Accuracy, the truth, the T, uh, orange, right?

42:04.500 --> 42:06.820
Says judging by most of these, it's probably 20 games.

42:06.820 --> 42:09.220
And then it's just the games repeated over and over again.

42:09.220 --> 42:09.940
That's what happens.

42:09.940 --> 42:14.980
A lot of these bootleg things is that it'll be like Mario, but Mario is a different color

42:14.980 --> 42:17.620
or Mario, but the Goomba is a penis.

42:17.620 --> 42:19.860
And somehow it snuck its way into this collection.

42:20.420 --> 42:25.060
So it's almost worth it if they had all those shitty bootleg ROMs in there.

42:25.780 --> 42:29.780
Did I ever tell you about the very first ROM hack I ever saw on the internet way back in

42:29.780 --> 42:30.180
college?

42:30.740 --> 42:34.980
So there was this Japanese only title that they never released or they never released

42:34.980 --> 42:36.020
it here at dark soccer.

42:36.020 --> 42:36.660
You probably know this one.

42:36.660 --> 42:38.100
It was an NES launch title.

42:38.100 --> 42:39.860
It was called nuts and milk.

42:39.860 --> 42:40.340
Yeah.

42:40.340 --> 42:44.580
Well, I'll let you imagine what they changed it to in Japan.

42:44.580 --> 42:48.580
That game nuts and milk were two cute little characters that, yeah.

42:48.580 --> 42:49.700
When they did the ROM hack.

42:51.060 --> 42:51.560
Yeah.

42:52.260 --> 42:53.460
Was it butts and milk?

42:53.460 --> 42:55.620
No, it was nuts.

42:56.340 --> 43:00.900
It was nuts in vag.

43:01.700 --> 43:04.020
Anyway, let's move on.

43:04.020 --> 43:07.940
Let's we need some Christmas cheer here and some Hanukkah spirit.

43:07.940 --> 43:12.420
So how and some Kwanzaa, uh, I'm trying to think.

43:12.420 --> 43:12.660
Joy.

43:12.660 --> 43:13.700
It's joy Kwanzaa.

43:13.700 --> 43:13.940
Okay.

43:13.940 --> 43:17.460
Kwanzaa joy and some solstice slumber.

43:17.460 --> 43:18.420
Cause I need a nap.

43:18.420 --> 43:20.340
Solstice serenity.

43:20.340 --> 43:21.300
Ah, I like that.

43:21.300 --> 43:21.460
Okay.

43:21.460 --> 43:22.260
So we need all of it.

43:22.260 --> 43:24.020
The shortest day is the longest night.

43:24.660 --> 43:26.420
We need all of it.

43:26.420 --> 43:28.500
And by the way, review.

43:28.500 --> 43:30.180
Oh, the lockers are fabulous.

43:30.180 --> 43:30.580
Yeah.

43:30.580 --> 43:34.260
This is the first year I've actually added stuff to the box mix.

43:34.260 --> 43:34.740
Yeah.

43:34.740 --> 43:37.140
The straights box mix is better than the Manischewitz.

43:37.140 --> 43:38.020
I'm going to say it now.

43:38.820 --> 43:42.340
When you said cheesy, I was like, Ooh, I don't know if I'm ready for all that cheese,

43:42.340 --> 43:44.820
but it's not like they're good.

43:44.820 --> 43:47.060
It's not like waffle house hash browns or cheese.

43:47.060 --> 43:49.940
I picked cheese that wouldn't turn stringy melty.

43:49.940 --> 43:52.980
It's a combination of Havarti and Manchego.

43:52.980 --> 43:54.340
So they're potent cheeses.

43:54.340 --> 43:58.180
You'll get the cheese flavor out of them without them being stringy and gooey.

43:58.180 --> 44:00.580
And the sour cream is a cultured sour cream.

44:00.580 --> 44:03.380
So it actually will be good for your tummy.

44:03.380 --> 44:04.020
Well, that's good.

44:04.020 --> 44:07.460
I'm not usually a big sour cream person, but this stuff is bomb though.

44:07.460 --> 44:08.180
And it's thick.

44:08.980 --> 44:10.420
Not bad for the grocery outlet.

44:10.420 --> 44:11.380
Thick with five C's.

44:15.380 --> 44:18.980
I was looking on AliExpress to see if they actually were selling it because that's

44:18.980 --> 44:23.700
usually we can find this kind of crap, but no, no, no, I don't see it.

44:23.700 --> 44:23.940
All right.

44:23.940 --> 44:28.500
Well, meanwhile, in a festive chat, I'm going to maybe grab a couple more of these.

44:28.500 --> 44:31.380
There's a few left and I made the whole box this time.

44:31.380 --> 44:34.900
So, so how about something about Christmas?

44:34.900 --> 44:36.660
God, I'm sick of Christmas music.

44:36.660 --> 44:40.980
For the first time in three years, I have heard the Mariah apocalypse happen.

44:40.980 --> 44:44.100
I wasn't participating in Wama Geddon because I actually fucking like that song,

44:44.100 --> 44:48.340
but I fell prey to the, to the Mariah apocalypse three times in one day.

44:48.340 --> 44:52.900
I heard a cover of it and that's even worse, but I actually liked the Wham song.

44:52.900 --> 44:56.020
Anyway, there was an update to Death Stranding.

44:56.900 --> 45:04.420
It was updated to version 1.08 for quote various performance improvements to the game,

45:04.420 --> 45:06.100
but there's something else in there.

45:06.100 --> 45:10.980
And this is what ties back to the mass of X is what I'm going to call it now,

45:10.980 --> 45:12.340
because it makes it sound more sinister.

45:13.460 --> 45:14.260
Christmas hats.

45:14.980 --> 45:21.380
So basically, some of the members in the Bridges organization will,

45:22.340 --> 45:25.380
will wear a Christmas hat, Santa hat.

45:26.660 --> 45:31.860
Some of them weren't wearing them, but most of them were wearing the Santa hats.

45:33.140 --> 45:38.580
Sam could already wear his as an unlock before this, but now it was like a weird

45:38.580 --> 45:44.420
involved process and you had to, to rank up your connection and some other crap,

45:44.420 --> 45:47.140
which me, I just, you know, watched the play through because

45:47.140 --> 45:48.900
I didn't want to do the running around stuff.

45:50.820 --> 45:53.540
But at any rate, it's a festive little update and

45:56.100 --> 45:58.260
even the holograms are wearing Santa hats.

45:58.260 --> 45:59.780
So good job.

46:01.220 --> 46:06.500
I don't know why that they even bothered because it kind of ruined the game atmosphere.

46:07.300 --> 46:10.260
And why can't we have blue ones to emulate Hanukkah Harry?

46:11.460 --> 46:13.460
I'm just saying I remember the SNL sketch.

46:14.420 --> 46:14.900
That's it.

46:15.780 --> 46:16.500
All right.

46:16.500 --> 46:20.740
I did get the patch, but I played a little bit of Death Stranding, but like,

46:20.740 --> 46:22.660
I did like one quest in Death Stranding.

46:22.660 --> 46:27.460
That was the most I played this week, but I did not notice a Santa upgrade

46:27.460 --> 46:28.500
or whatever you want to call it.

46:28.500 --> 46:31.540
So I must be talking to one of the guys that doesn't have one.

46:31.540 --> 46:33.860
So they're not everywhere.

46:33.860 --> 46:35.540
All right, moving on.

46:35.540 --> 46:37.140
Is there Jeff Keighley in a Santa hat?

46:37.140 --> 46:38.260
Is that something I don't know?

46:38.260 --> 46:42.340
I have to run over to that checkpoint and look, because apparently the Jeff Keighley checkpoint,

46:42.340 --> 46:43.940
it is one of the earlier ones in the game.

46:43.940 --> 46:46.580
So you know which one annoyed the shit out of me though?

46:46.580 --> 46:49.220
The Conan one, because you know who annoys the shit out of me?

46:49.220 --> 46:49.860
Conan.

46:49.860 --> 46:51.380
I haven't found him yet.

46:51.380 --> 46:53.540
So pan, no, Otter hat.

46:54.180 --> 46:54.660
That's it.

46:54.660 --> 46:55.220
Otter hat.

46:55.220 --> 46:56.100
That's all I'm gonna say.

46:56.100 --> 46:57.940
All right, moving on.

46:57.940 --> 46:58.440
Loki.

46:59.220 --> 47:04.340
So there was a, this is talking about like news of the decade, but there was a prototype

47:04.340 --> 47:10.820
of the PlayStation Super Nintendo crossover type thing that they were going to be.

47:10.820 --> 47:13.940
Like the one that Ben Heck did the work on?

47:13.940 --> 47:14.740
I believe so.

47:14.740 --> 47:18.260
This is the Nintendo PlayStation, that prototype.

47:18.260 --> 47:25.700
Well, they are now going to be auctioning it off for, I believe, charity.

47:26.820 --> 47:30.660
So basically they said, I can't keep losing.

47:30.660 --> 47:32.660
Oh, maybe not for charity.

47:32.660 --> 47:36.260
So charity of paying my rent.

47:37.540 --> 47:42.820
So the owner of the console right now, Terry Diebold, he apparently keeps losing money.

47:43.380 --> 47:48.100
He says he put a lot of work into it by traveling with it and has made nothing on it.

47:48.100 --> 47:51.860
Every trip that he's taken has cost money out of pocket.

47:51.860 --> 47:58.900
He says the bills itself, he says that he's the world's largest collectibles auctioneer

47:58.900 --> 48:00.420
or heritage, I guess is going to be.

48:01.380 --> 48:06.500
So they're going to start selling, or start selling this, I guess, next year.

48:06.500 --> 48:10.020
They have it already on auction, I believe, at least previewed.

48:10.020 --> 48:12.820
And I don't know what he's looking to make for it.

48:15.140 --> 48:20.340
But apparently the online auction will begin February 27th and will not have a reserve

48:20.340 --> 48:21.140
price.

48:21.140 --> 48:27.460
So dump as much money as you want into this thing that I don't believe plays anything.

48:28.260 --> 48:29.860
And you can't play anything with it.

48:29.860 --> 48:37.780
So really the only reason to have this is if you are one of those that has the biggest

48:37.780 --> 48:42.900
collection of collections, or maybe a museum or something like that, or you're a tech

48:42.900 --> 48:45.300
person that wants to take it apart and see if you can.

48:45.860 --> 48:47.060
But again, there's no game.

48:47.060 --> 48:48.660
There's no games like built into it or anything.

48:48.660 --> 48:50.580
So you're just not going to get to play anything.

48:50.580 --> 48:54.740
There was a BIOS disk and a couple of ROMs floating around.

48:54.740 --> 48:57.540
And I watched the whole rebuild with Ben Heck.

48:57.540 --> 48:58.900
It was actually pretty cool.

48:58.900 --> 49:00.900
And he got things working on it.

49:00.900 --> 49:05.140
So now they're out there public to burn off whatever game.

49:05.140 --> 49:06.740
So I don't know.

49:07.460 --> 49:10.340
I would not pay money for this, but I know that people would.

49:12.180 --> 49:16.740
And active says you can only play Super Nintendo games if I recall correctly, probably.

49:16.740 --> 49:18.660
But here's the other side of that.

49:18.660 --> 49:21.700
Like if you buy a system like this, you shouldn't be playing anything on it.

49:21.700 --> 49:24.660
Like you don't want to ruin it by actually using it to play games.

49:24.660 --> 49:25.060
I know.

49:25.060 --> 49:26.260
Doesn't that sound weird?

49:26.260 --> 49:30.260
But the reality is, if it's the only one out there, like you don't want to do anything

49:30.260 --> 49:34.180
that would you would you would put it in a box and just let it sit there.

49:34.180 --> 49:36.580
You know who ought to outbid everybody and buy it?

49:36.580 --> 49:37.220
Nintendo.

49:39.060 --> 49:43.700
Wouldn't that be a gag if Nintendo bought it and just put it in their store in a glass

49:43.700 --> 49:44.740
case or something?

49:44.740 --> 49:46.180
Or why would you want to know?

49:46.180 --> 49:47.060
Throw it away.

49:47.060 --> 49:48.580
Put it in the incinerator.

49:48.580 --> 49:50.660
That's that's what I would that's what I would.

49:50.660 --> 49:53.940
What they're going to do is they're going to put it in a crate and it's going to end

49:53.940 --> 49:57.220
up in the warehouse, just like at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark.

49:57.860 --> 50:01.220
Bobby Bockel says this should be in a museum, not in a collector's basement.

50:01.220 --> 50:04.820
I agree, but it's going to be up to a museum to pay that kind of money for it.

50:04.820 --> 50:05.380
I just don't know.

50:05.380 --> 50:09.220
Like what kind of like public museums would this fit in at?

50:09.220 --> 50:09.620
I don't know.

50:09.620 --> 50:10.100
It doesn't.

50:10.100 --> 50:17.700
The official the O2 Moi, the official gaming museum or whatever the hell that there's a

50:17.700 --> 50:22.180
call of fame, the official Hall of Fame of Games or some shit that there's another one

50:22.180 --> 50:22.740
in New York.

50:22.740 --> 50:24.180
The middle of fucking nowhere.

50:24.180 --> 50:27.620
That one that inducts the five games every year into the video game Hall of Fame.

50:27.620 --> 50:28.660
That's out in New York somewhere.

50:28.660 --> 50:29.300
That's not New York.

50:29.300 --> 50:31.220
I thought that was the one that was in the middle of fucking nowhere.

50:32.100 --> 50:34.900
No, no different.

50:35.460 --> 50:37.540
Oh, Bobby Bockel says the maid in Oakland.

50:37.540 --> 50:37.940
That's right.

50:37.940 --> 50:39.140
I've even been to that place.

50:41.700 --> 50:42.340
But you know why?

50:42.340 --> 50:46.420
When I went, there was a special event going on, so I didn't see what the place normally

50:46.420 --> 50:46.900
looks like.

50:46.900 --> 50:49.780
And honestly, I thought it was like a store type of thing.

50:50.340 --> 50:54.020
But now that you say that, oh, yeah, that place is a museum usually when there's not

50:54.020 --> 50:55.300
an event going on at it.

50:55.300 --> 50:58.820
So and Bobby says the Computer Museum of America in Atlanta.

50:59.460 --> 51:03.460
Yeah, Bobby brings up Frank Cifaldi's Preservation Society.

51:03.460 --> 51:05.620
That's where my brain went too.

51:05.620 --> 51:10.260
But they're going to need the money to compete with those basement investors.

51:10.260 --> 51:16.420
So hopefully they've got a shadow donor willing to pony up the money to let it go there if

51:16.420 --> 51:17.380
that's what's going to do that.

51:17.380 --> 51:18.980
So be interesting.

51:18.980 --> 51:22.420
So anyway, Orange Right says twist.

51:22.420 --> 51:23.540
Sony buys it.

51:23.540 --> 51:25.700
Pod culture suggests Jamie's vault.

51:25.700 --> 51:30.740
Well, she would probably have to sell all of the pinball machines and then some.

51:30.740 --> 51:33.380
And I don't know if they're willing to do that for a date.

51:33.380 --> 51:34.500
I'll be honest.

51:34.500 --> 51:41.860
I wouldn't be excited about having it, especially since I mean, it would be cool, but it would

51:41.860 --> 51:44.420
be like that little pong machine that I picked up.

51:44.420 --> 51:45.460
Yeah, older.

51:45.460 --> 51:48.900
Well, it's not older than me, but it would just be sitting in my vault.

51:48.900 --> 51:50.740
With no, nothing I can do with it.

51:50.740 --> 51:51.060
Yeah.

51:51.060 --> 51:56.260
And as much as we tease you about the vault, like you and Dan do, like you'll go in, you

51:56.260 --> 51:59.780
know, well, the vaults kind of morphed a little bit because it was at your old house where

51:59.780 --> 52:01.860
you actually have to break out the Saturn and play Christmas nights.

52:01.860 --> 52:02.900
But that's the thing.

52:02.900 --> 52:05.940
You guys will actually like go in there and be like, I want to play this.

52:06.500 --> 52:09.860
And then it's like, you know, so you actually are like, it's like walking into your own

52:09.860 --> 52:12.660
little used game store and pulling in what you want to play.

52:12.660 --> 52:14.660
And I just have a bug to play this game this week.

52:14.660 --> 52:16.020
It's not owning things to own.

52:16.020 --> 52:20.020
Especially the reason why we have overdrives now so that we don't actually have to hunt

52:20.020 --> 52:25.940
down where the fuck we put the cartridge or, you know, this memory card that has this thing

52:25.940 --> 52:31.860
on it or like, well, and we can also play some of the super CD games because like for

52:31.860 --> 52:35.940
the turbo graphics, because I don't have an arcade card and I don't have the CD unit

52:35.940 --> 52:37.220
for my core graphics.

52:37.220 --> 52:39.220
If I had a duo RX, then shoot.

52:39.220 --> 52:40.180
Yeah, that'd be fine.

52:40.180 --> 52:43.380
I don't know who out there would be willing to spend 200 bucks on me, but.

52:44.100 --> 52:44.580
Hint, hint.

52:45.140 --> 52:49.540
But I'm just at any rate, I mean, I've been trying to find the CD add on for the core

52:49.540 --> 52:55.620
graphics, and I really haven't been able to because we so we just now I mean, that's why

52:55.620 --> 53:01.140
we're looking forward to that a turbo graphics mini because we're on the preorder for it.

53:01.140 --> 53:01.940
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

53:01.940 --> 53:02.740
I preordered that.

53:02.740 --> 53:06.020
And that's not even out till what, like March or something, something like that.

53:06.020 --> 53:07.700
But yet another thing in March.

53:07.700 --> 53:12.260
But it's going to have the the super graphics version of it.

53:12.260 --> 53:13.860
Was it Daimakamura or Chomakamura?

53:13.860 --> 53:15.940
No, Chomakamura was SNES.

53:15.940 --> 53:21.300
So it's going to be Daimakamura as in ghosts and goblins.

53:21.300 --> 53:24.500
I always get the mix around which one was first, ghouls and ghosts or ghosts and goblins.

53:24.500 --> 53:28.180
So I just always call it by the Japanese name because it's easier for me to remember.

53:29.940 --> 53:34.260
But you know, it's going to have some of the super graphics games on there.

53:34.260 --> 53:36.020
But I mean, back in the long run, though.

53:37.540 --> 53:38.580
It would be a nice thing.

53:38.580 --> 53:39.220
I'll put it that way.

53:39.220 --> 53:42.420
It would be nice to have that system.

53:42.420 --> 53:46.420
It would be a little slice of unique gaming history that no one else has.

53:47.060 --> 53:48.180
But that's all it is.

53:48.180 --> 53:51.540
What good would something like that do in my closet?

53:52.820 --> 53:58.100
When other people could be looking at it were, I mean, hell, I could if I had it,

53:58.100 --> 54:03.940
I would probably have it reverse engineered and rebuilt, you know, and marketed or something,

54:03.940 --> 54:07.460
or I mean, not really marketed, but like make them for other people.

54:07.460 --> 54:08.260
That would be cool.

54:08.980 --> 54:11.940
You know, have them, you know, do like the pachinko thing where you take your little

54:11.940 --> 54:14.420
pachinko balls to the store next door and get your prize.

54:14.420 --> 54:15.860
So I wouldn't actually be selling it.

54:15.860 --> 54:18.100
I would just be getting prizes that I can trade for money.

54:19.300 --> 54:20.020
I see.

54:20.020 --> 54:23.220
If it's good enough for Japan is good enough for me.

54:24.740 --> 54:25.240
All right.

54:25.940 --> 54:29.060
Well, regardless, no one in this room will be picking up the Nintendo PlayStation,

54:29.060 --> 54:29.620
that's for sure.

54:29.620 --> 54:32.420
But it will be very interesting to see how that all plays out.

54:32.420 --> 54:38.260
And if it does go to museum or the purchaser has chosen to keep their information private,

54:38.260 --> 54:39.700
which sometimes happens.

54:39.700 --> 54:41.540
So, but, you know, it's interesting, though.

54:41.540 --> 54:45.860
Like, the reason why my mind keeps going to museums is that sometimes that rock and roll

54:45.860 --> 54:47.300
paraphernalia gets sold.

54:47.300 --> 54:50.340
You know who buys that stuff sometimes is Hard Rock Cafe.

54:50.340 --> 54:54.260
And so they send them to Hard Rock hotels and cafes around.

54:54.260 --> 54:56.020
I wouldn't want that to happen to it.

54:56.020 --> 54:58.580
Well, at least you can kind of go see it.

54:58.580 --> 55:01.620
Although, I told you about the Vegas story, right?

55:02.420 --> 55:04.500
I was in Vegas when we went to go see the Gwen Stefani show.

55:04.500 --> 55:06.180
So me and Miss Melody were in Vegas.

55:06.740 --> 55:10.180
And we were trying to find the Jerry.

55:10.180 --> 55:13.460
Her name is now Jerry Horner, but it was Jerry Halliwell.

55:13.460 --> 55:16.580
We were trying to find her dress because her infamous British dress.

55:16.580 --> 55:21.860
I saw it at that Vegas casino about during those years ago.

55:21.860 --> 55:24.340
It was during the 25th anniversary of Rocky Horror Convention.

55:24.340 --> 55:25.780
So I saw it there during then.

55:25.780 --> 55:27.140
So we were looking around for it.

55:27.140 --> 55:29.780
Well, as it turns out, it's no longer there.

55:30.500 --> 55:32.020
They moved it out of that casino.

55:32.020 --> 55:32.980
That's the thing that annoys me.

55:32.980 --> 55:37.460
I was like, well, you know, if you're gonna have all this stuff, put it on display somewhere.

55:37.460 --> 55:41.300
But we did get to see shoes that Britney Spears wore in the toxic video.

55:41.300 --> 55:42.020
So that was cool.

55:42.580 --> 55:43.080
Okay.

55:44.980 --> 55:47.220
None of that type of thing.

55:47.220 --> 55:48.900
Well, I like seeing the instruments.

55:49.540 --> 55:53.220
Like seeing, you know, Lemmy's bass, for example.

55:54.260 --> 56:00.180
Seeing, you know, just because especially when you look and see like finger marks and,

56:00.180 --> 56:02.580
you know, grooves that were cut on, you know, different things.

56:02.580 --> 56:05.060
That gives me a little bit more other than, oh, these are shoes.

56:05.060 --> 56:05.460
Look.

56:05.460 --> 56:06.900
Oh, my God, Britney's shoes.

56:07.540 --> 56:10.820
Some people take a trip to the Holy Land because they want to see where

56:10.820 --> 56:13.940
religious people in the past walked and did things.

56:13.940 --> 56:16.740
If I want to go see Britney's shoes, that's my religion.

56:16.740 --> 56:17.240
Okay.

56:19.140 --> 56:21.140
That was, yeah, except yours isn't tax exempt.

56:23.620 --> 56:28.180
Then again, you did hear about the Satanic Temple becoming federally recognized.

56:28.180 --> 56:29.300
Oh, no, I have not.

56:30.100 --> 56:31.700
I would have thought that already happened.

56:31.700 --> 56:35.300
It's actually, it's like one particular aspect.

56:35.300 --> 56:39.860
It's like they finally went for full recognition or something and got their tax exempt status.

56:39.860 --> 56:46.100
And then now they say they voluntarily pay taxes because they're trying to,

56:46.740 --> 56:50.980
I mean, honestly, they've been better quality humans than the Southern Baptist Convention.

56:50.980 --> 56:51.700
And I'll leave it at that.

56:52.660 --> 56:54.580
Do they still have that statue of Baphomet?

56:54.580 --> 56:55.080
Yeah.

56:56.100 --> 56:58.260
I always thought that was the most hilarious story.

56:58.260 --> 56:58.820
I'm sorry.

57:00.100 --> 57:00.600
Anyway.

57:01.060 --> 57:01.460
All right.

57:01.460 --> 57:02.100
Moving on.

57:02.900 --> 57:06.660
Let's talk about, oh, let's talk about another type of religion for some people.

57:06.660 --> 57:08.260
Fantasy Star Online.

57:08.260 --> 57:11.860
Lord knows I've lost many, many hours to Fantasy Star.

57:11.860 --> 57:13.220
Well, guess what?

57:13.220 --> 57:16.980
You were going to have the chance soon to play Fantasy Star Online 2,

57:16.980 --> 57:21.220
which granted, it did change some stuff from the original, but I still want to check it out.

57:22.180 --> 57:22.680
Yes.

57:23.620 --> 57:25.300
I could check it out.

57:25.300 --> 57:28.740
I could, you know, do all that stuff with the patches and all that stuff.

57:28.740 --> 57:29.620
I don't want to.

57:29.620 --> 57:31.620
I want Sega to support it in America.

57:31.620 --> 57:34.740
And finally, as we found out at E3, they're going to be.

57:35.380 --> 57:37.540
And so there is a beta test coming out.

57:37.540 --> 57:41.140
So there is right now a closed Xbox One beta test,

57:41.140 --> 57:43.140
which is why Jamie's mad because she doesn't have an Xbox One,

57:43.940 --> 57:45.940
that will be happening in early February.

57:45.940 --> 57:50.580
You can sign up now through the Insider app on your Xbox One.

57:50.580 --> 57:54.100
So if you are an Xbox Insider, which is like, I think,

57:54.100 --> 57:56.980
I don't remember if you signed up on the website to download a special app,

57:56.980 --> 57:59.780
or if you just have to download the app from the marketplace.

57:59.780 --> 58:02.420
But I know it's called the Xbox Insider hub.

58:02.420 --> 58:03.300
So look for that.

58:03.300 --> 58:07.220
And that allows you to like, look at like, if you want to look at betas of hardware,

58:07.220 --> 58:10.580
upgrade updates and things like that, you can get all that through the program too.

58:10.580 --> 58:13.460
And then they have surveys and things that you can answer

58:13.460 --> 58:15.140
and you get little points and you level up.

58:15.140 --> 58:15.640
It's cute.

58:17.220 --> 58:18.820
So anyway, I don't know about you guys,

58:18.820 --> 58:20.980
but if you haven't turned on your Xbox One in a while,

58:20.980 --> 58:24.980
you might want to do that so you can get on this stress test, if you will,

58:24.980 --> 58:26.900
for Phantasy Star Online 2.

58:26.900 --> 58:29.060
And again, that's going to be happening in February.

58:29.060 --> 58:30.820
I don't know when this closes,

58:32.740 --> 58:34.900
but I would get on that sooner rather than later.

58:34.900 --> 58:38.340
Now, Dark Sakura, you won't be left out forever.

58:38.340 --> 58:41.780
There will be a Windows 10 version that launches later in 2020.

58:41.780 --> 58:44.340
Although I know you're at war with your PC right now,

58:44.340 --> 58:47.060
but maybe later in 2020, that will resolve itself

58:47.060 --> 58:50.420
by the time Phantasy Star Online 2 becomes available.

58:50.420 --> 58:52.260
So excited.

58:52.260 --> 58:57.060
I hope I get in and I hope there's not a lot of NDAs.

58:57.060 --> 58:58.980
I hope we are able to live stream it.

58:58.980 --> 59:00.180
But if we can't, we can't.

59:00.180 --> 59:04.100
I just missed my mags that I had in the first PSO because I had my Oppa Oppa.

59:04.100 --> 59:06.660
The Oppa Oppa was my favorite because I fucking love Phantasy Zone,

59:06.660 --> 59:08.500
but I did also have a Sega Master System.

59:09.460 --> 59:13.540
Well, you know, Mr. VG Realness, Delvin and myself,

59:13.540 --> 59:16.100
we jumped into the wonderful world of pirate servers

59:16.100 --> 59:17.460
from Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst

59:17.460 --> 59:19.860
because we were streaming for a little bit and that was a lot of fun.

59:19.860 --> 59:22.340
So I think it was called like Afinia or something like that.

59:22.340 --> 59:24.420
I played PSO 2 for a long time though.

59:24.420 --> 59:27.300
Just Google Phantasy Star Online private server

59:27.300 --> 59:28.740
and it's the first result that comes up.

59:28.740 --> 59:34.740
And there's still quite a few people that are rocking on that platform.

59:34.740 --> 59:36.260
So it's very cool.

59:36.260 --> 59:37.780
So, all right.

59:38.900 --> 59:41.700
Dr. Su says that reminds me, did you all drop off of Blue Burst?

59:43.300 --> 59:46.660
I'm not actively playing Blue Burst, but forever in my heart.

59:46.660 --> 59:49.780
And honestly, if Delvin were to text me one day and be like,

59:50.340 --> 59:53.060
yo, bitch, let's do a stream, I'd probably be down.

59:53.060 --> 59:55.620
So, because I had a lot of fun doing those Blue Burst streams.

59:55.620 --> 59:56.580
So I'd probably do it again.

59:57.700 --> 59:58.180
All right.

59:58.980 --> 01:00:03.380
Questbuster talking about PSO 2 saying the cosmetics in PSO 2 are pretty insane.

01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:07.220
People were running around in so many tie-ins like Attack from Titan gear.

01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:09.540
Well, PSO 2 was a free MMO.

01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:12.260
So there are going to be a lot of commercial spots and things like that.

01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:14.500
I don't think they're going to suddenly charge for it here.

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:15.380
It's really hard.

01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:21.300
There's only essentially, I think like three premium MMOs left in the US.

01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:24.020
That would be World of Warcraft, of course.

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:27.460
Final Fantasy XIV, I guess 11 as well.

01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:28.420
I guess you could bundle into that.

01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:31.220
But the other one that's coming to mind, isn't EverQuest still a monthly payer?

01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:33.300
Or did they finally take EverQuest free to play?

01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:34.500
I don't remember.

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:36.500
I don't know, but I have a friend who's playing EverQuest.

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:39.220
Like the, when they brought back the OG server.

01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:39.860
Bobby would know.

01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:41.460
I'm just waiting for the delay because he'll know.

01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:44.100
Cause I know he was on the EverQuest bandwagon for a long time.

01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:46.740
So I can't remember if they finally went for it.

01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:50.900
I know EverQuest 2 didn't take off the way they hoped it would.

01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:58.180
So, but yeah, having a premium like month to month pay MMO is a hard thing to do now

01:00:58.180 --> 01:00:59.140
in this day and age.

01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:01.780
Like they tried it with Star Wars.

01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:05.940
I almost said, oh, sorry, Bobby.

01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:09.700
Is EverQuest something you still pay a monthly fee for or did it finally go free to play?

01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:15.220
Um, and what was the Star Wars MMO that I can't, I keep wanting to say The Force Awakens,

01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:16.260
but no, that was the movie.

01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:18.180
Um, what was the Star Wars MMO called?

01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:21.220
The Metal Mayhem says, uh, God, I almost said ElfQuest.

01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:24.020
EverQuest is free to play now.

01:01:24.020 --> 01:01:24.340
Okay.

01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:26.500
You know why I have ElfQuest on my mind?

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:29.540
I found my ElfQuest graphic novels from like the eighties.

01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:30.180
Oh, that's funny.

01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:31.140
I love ElfQuest.

01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:31.380
Yeah.

01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:37.540
So anyway, um, so yeah, that means like as far as premium MMOs go, there's only Final

01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:41.860
Fantasies and World of Warcraft are still able to get away with charging a monthly fee.

01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:44.500
That's really the older public, the older public.

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:45.140
Thank you.

01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:49.460
The older public celebrated eight years this past night to the older public.

01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:50.500
I had a friend that worked on that.

01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:52.580
She used to call it Scrotor.

01:01:54.580 --> 01:01:57.540
That's how I got into the, uh, uh, the Skywalker ranch.

01:01:57.540 --> 01:02:01.460
But that was, that was a fun little Krista worked for Lucas arts.

01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:02.180
Yeah.

01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:06.180
But that was a fun little, uh, side adventure, you know, uh, game.

01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:08.500
And it, you know, had a lot of the BioWare traits in it.

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:13.300
I love that you could play like a bad Jedi or a good Sith.

01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:14.500
Like, I really loved that.

01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:16.020
That was like an option that you could do.

01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:21.300
I would just want to do full on grade Jedi or gray force user, whatever.

01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:26.740
Uh, and Bobby is saying, okay, so it's free to play, but it has premium subs, but the

01:02:26.740 --> 01:02:28.420
sub is daybreak all access.

01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:31.940
So it's EverQuest, EverQuest 2, DC Universe online and Planetside 2.

01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:34.100
So it's like all these MMOs in one basically.

01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:35.540
So that's kind of interesting.

01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:38.180
So, and, uh, Bobby's saying I enjoyed SWTOR.

01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:40.740
The Jedi Knight storyline was KOTOR 3 to me.

01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:43.060
Yeah, I've heard that feedback before too.

01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:43.780
So anyway.

01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:44.900
All right.

01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:47.780
That World of MMOs, but Phantasy Star Online 2, that'll be a free one.

01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:48.340
So that's good.

01:02:49.220 --> 01:02:49.540
All right.

01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:50.260
Moving on.

01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:55.380
Uh, Dark Sakura, some more details on, uh, we have, we're having a Microsoft Knight tonight

01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:55.780
apparently.

01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:58.340
I guess so, but this one actually makes me really happy.

01:02:58.340 --> 01:03:00.740
I love to see people doing things right.

01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:08.260
So, um, Microsoft has announced a, uh, their lead character in Tell Me Why is going to

01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:10.340
be trans, transgender.

01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:17.540
The main character is a man named Tyler Ronan, um, who is, I guess, I mean, it doesn't say

01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:20.100
anything about, you know, where he is on his thing.

01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:21.860
And that would be, of course, be a personal decision.

01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:25.700
It's not something that should matter about the character, just that he is a transgender

01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:26.200
man.

01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:34.840
And, um, one of the quotes from Liam, uh, who is, uh, the game director for Liam is

01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:37.800
that, um, the goal is not to have an agenda.

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:42.200
We develop characters and stories because we believe in their value and in giving experience

01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:42.760
to players.

01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:48.120
Um, and then later on saying that Tyler is a young man with great values, good and bad

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:50.200
elements, and that's what makes him human.

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:58.520
And I really, I really like, um, that they put a lot of, uh, um, attention into the voice

01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:05.640
actor to find someone who would sound authentic, um, and into making it just what I'm thinking

01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:06.280
of.

01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:11.080
I hate to phrase it this way because honestly, this is what I wish any sexual orientation,

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:14.760
any gender, anything like that would be is that it's just a thing.

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:16.440
It's a normal thing.

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:22.120
It doesn't need to be made special light of because it's an intrinsic part of this person.

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:24.680
It's special because it belongs to this character.

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:27.080
It's special because the person is special.

01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:31.880
And I'm not saying ignore somebody's experiences, but at the same time, I would just like it

01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:35.000
to be, oh, like, oh, you, you have brown hair.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:35.720
Oh, you're gay.

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:39.880
Oh, you're, you're a trans woman, you know?

01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:45.560
And so I hope that they take that approach in the game instead of making it.

01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:49.640
I want to see the struggles highlighted, but at the same time, I'd also like it to be

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:51.320
that normal part of who that person is.

01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:57.880
And I'm, I'm going to just say this because, you know, there's people out there that are

01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:00.600
going to pose this question, why does it matter?

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:04.840
And I'm not saying I'm asking that question, but I want to just entertain that because,

01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:08.040
you know, there's going to be people out there that are going to say, why does it matter?

01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:12.760
Why does it matter that, why do, why, why do we have this trans agenda shoved in our

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:13.400
face?

01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:16.680
Because I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but you know it, there's, it's out there on the Twitter's

01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:17.400
ease and that stuff.

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:24.760
So, but in my, my kind of opinion, the fact that that would be out there is kind of exactly

01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:26.680
why there needs to be something like this.

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:29.720
It's kind of like one of those, well, if that's the question you have, play the game.

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:30.280
Exactly.

01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:36.760
And the way I feel about it now is, and now keep in mind this normalization, that's going

01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:37.320
to be down the line.

01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:37.880
That's not now.

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:40.520
Representation now absolutely matters.

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:44.680
It is something that needs to be brought attention to, but I don't want it to be treated

01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:49.080
as in this is this only, this only reason to right to exist.

01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:54.440
I want it to be a fully realized person who happens to be trans and that his experience

01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:57.400
as a trans man plays into who he is as a person.

01:05:57.400 --> 01:06:01.560
Not necessarily just I'm going through everything that all trans people in the universe are

01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:01.880
going through.

01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:03.640
No, his experience is going to be different.

01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:05.560
My, my friend's experiences are different.

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:08.760
Everybody's experience is different and I want it to be kind of like that.

01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:12.280
The representation though abso-fucking-lutely matters.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:19.320
And I think to add to that point as well, you know, when there was a trans character

01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:25.960
in Mass Effect Andromeda, that character took a lot of criticism because it didn't act like

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:29.000
a trans person or that I was the trench.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:29.500
Okay.

01:06:31.080 --> 01:06:34.920
The trans woman did not act like a trans dead named herself.

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:35.880
Exactly.

01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:40.920
And that's like, no, like if you ever meet a trans person, they're not going to say,

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:41.480
what was the line?

01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:43.960
I'm trying to think of the line that she said, but she said like something.

01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:46.360
When I registered, it was, is the name blah.

01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:46.920
Yeah, exactly.

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:47.400
Something like that.

01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:52.360
And it's like, okay, no trans person would actually say that within 60 seconds of meeting

01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:52.760
you.

01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:55.720
That is not like no one's fucking business.

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:55.960
Yeah.

01:06:55.960 --> 01:07:01.720
Most trans people would probably, at least any that I I've known, like only if I knew

01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:04.040
them before they transition, do I know.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:05.560
Yeah.

01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:07.960
You know, those details.

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:09.480
Otherwise it's not my business.

01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:10.120
You know what I mean?

01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:14.920
Well, and it's what, what I do for myself whenever I have a friend transitions.

01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:20.040
And actually I have a few friends now that I do not remember their names beforehand because

01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:25.640
I give myself a year, I change their contact card on my phone and then I put a parenthesis

01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:31.160
with the first initial of their dead name to give myself six months so that the name

01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:32.680
is fully associated with them.

01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:37.800
Then I remove the initial and in a lot of cases I even have to sit and think about what

01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:38.920
was their dead name.

01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:42.600
And I don't do that because that's disrespectful to the journey they're going through.

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:45.640
Yes, that name, that person is a part of who they are.

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:49.560
Forgetting it erases a part of who they were, their experiences.

01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:56.040
But at the same time, no trans person out there is going to say, Oh, well, you know,

01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:58.440
I was Julia before and now I'm Jack.

01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:00.520
They're not going to do that.

01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:02.280
They're just going to say, Hey, I'm Jack, what's up?

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:05.800
That's all it's going to be because that is who they are now.

01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:07.400
You don't need to know who they were.

01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:09.720
You need to appreciate the person that who they were made.

01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:12.040
So anyway, sorry.

01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:13.400
No, no, it's important.

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:16.200
And I think brings insight to the question, why does it matter?

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:19.400
Because, you know, you know, that's what's on social media right now.

01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:24.200
And I know we shouldn't have to go down that road, but I had to because somebody out there

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:25.080
might be wondering.

01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:30.360
Is that said that Mattel came out with trans dolls and I'm just going through my brain

01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:31.880
trying to figure out how that works.

01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:39.720
Like, because, I mean, I know that trans people are more than their genitals, but the

01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:44.840
dolls have no representation like that other than maybe having boobs or, you know, being

01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:47.000
built in a particular way.

01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:50.840
So I don't know how that would happen unless it's just like in their back story.

01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:53.160
Dolls don't have genitals or that sort of thing.

01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:57.160
I mean, everybody's undressed a Barbie in a can back in the day and you found nothing.

01:08:57.160 --> 01:09:03.240
So now this is what I'm wondering is how they would represent trans characters in a

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:03.740
Barbie doll.

01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:07.400
If there's something different about the body mold or something.

01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:08.280
I have to look that up.

01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:09.640
That's actually very fascinating.

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:10.200
All right.

01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:12.920
Well, in the meantime, we aren't a doll podcast.

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:13.800
We're a video game podcast.

01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:14.440
We're gonna move on.

01:09:14.440 --> 01:09:14.940
Thank God.

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:17.720
I'm at the wrong show.

01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:21.160
Well, dolls could include Legos as like an extension.

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:21.960
That's not a doll.

01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:26.840
Sia Tabiri says they may have been gender neutral with options to dress up as more

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:28.120
male or more female.

01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:28.600
Okay.

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:29.080
With wit.

01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:29.320
Yeah.

01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:29.560
Okay.

01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:31.400
I did actually, I think I did see that.

01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:32.440
And so that makes sense to me.

01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:34.120
Okay, cool.

01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:34.840
All right.

01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:39.160
Anyhow, let's move on and talk about, uh, we'll talk, we'll talk about while we talk

01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:40.280
about cars.

01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:40.680
Yeah.

01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:41.640
We'll talk about cars.

01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:42.200
Loki.

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:42.360
Yeah.

01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:43.800
Let's think about the manly games.

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:45.000
We could play our cars.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.280
Like, let's talk about cars.

01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:47.480
Like Stardew Valley.

01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:49.420
Yeah.

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:51.000
Manly.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.360
On my fucking Tesla.

01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:54.680
Romancing farming.

01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:03.560
But yes, apparently, apparently part of the, uh, holiday software update.

01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:06.760
Tesla owners are getting a Stardew Valley port.

01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:13.960
Not all, not all to hashtag, not all Tesla because, uh, they certain depends on what

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:17.960
your, what version of software or your car basically and what it can run.

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:23.320
Just like, you know, we were just talking about, um, iPads and when they, they, they

01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:25.560
no longer will play the latest and greatest stuff.

01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:25.960
Sorry.

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:27.800
Your car can't play Stardew Valley.

01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:32.360
Bobby is pointing out that, uh, not on my Tesla, LOL early adopter.

01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:36.040
Tesla's built after 2018, we'll get Stardew Valley.

01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:38.520
So it has to be a, uh, a newer,

01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:39.000
Darn.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.120
I mean, or Tesla.

01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:43.960
So the play that if you, you know, I remember when this game came out, but like.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.320
But will the James Bond truck played this?

01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:51.880
Probably, you know, but we always, you know.

01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:52.200
Okay.

01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:58.280
So I, some, I feel like in some ways this whole like games on a Tesla becomes this joke

01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:03.320
of like Linux on a toaster, but which has happened, of course it's happened, but there

01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:07.000
is some, like, there is like reasons why this exists.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:12.600
Well, they also have a, with the full self-driving sneak preview is coming as well.

01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:15.000
So you're gonna have to do something while your car is driving you somewhere.

01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:18.280
Granted, we're not quite there yet.

01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:21.720
I think we're, we're going to have cars driving themselves.

01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:24.440
I mean, yeah, they do have some self-driving cars.

01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:27.560
I just wouldn't trust it with the people, especially with the people I've been driving

01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:28.120
around today.

01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:30.120
I would not trust it.

01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:32.120
Um, cause people be stupid.

01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:35.000
So another, you trust your car, you don't trust other people's cars.

01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:36.520
I correct.

01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:37.020
Okay.

01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:40.440
It's just, yeah, people are dumb.

01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:44.840
Um, and Bobby, and this is of course very clear is that, and I didn't get to make this

01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:48.680
point yet because we went on tangent, but, um, the games don't work when you're driving.

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:51.800
So you don't get to play Stardew Valley while you're driving, not even your passenger.

01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:53.080
It doesn't work that way.

01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:53.640
Okay.

01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:57.560
But what it's for is, and in my mind, while you're super charging, you're super charging.

01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:58.200
Exactly.

01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:00.920
And you might think, well, doesn't that defeat the purpose of charging to be wearing down

01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:02.120
the battery playing a game?

01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:03.800
It's it's charging there.

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:07.560
It's charging a lot faster than you're using it of the little bit of power to play a game.

01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:12.600
So, uh, and yeah, that's, that is a real thing about, you know, Tesla ownership or any type

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:16.600
of all electric vehicle really is that, you know, you're going to have to, the way you

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:18.440
fuel up is different.

01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:22.760
You know, if you're taking a big trip and again, you know, cheap plug for our own YouTube

01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:28.040
channel at VoG network, I don't pimp the YouTube very much, but here's a very real application

01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:33.480
there because Bobby has a couple of road trip videos from his own Tesla experiences where

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:38.280
he kind of talks about how they stopped to supercharge at certain places while he's going

01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:42.840
on these very long road trips, such as when he went from Atlanta to Washington, DC for

01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:44.920
magfest is one video that comes to mind.

01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:48.440
And he, you know, showed like how that path all worked and all that stuff.

01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:55.000
So, um, you know, for now, that's why a lot of superchargers are at malls and big travel

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.920
stops and places with things to do.

01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:59.880
So that way it's like, can get now stretching my legs.

01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:04.920
It's not just like 20 minutes to, you know, fuel up, get a big gulp and go, you know,

01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:10.200
you have to charge from sometimes for about what is about 45 minutes, depends on how many

01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:11.320
miles you're trying to go.

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:12.920
So that's why these things are here.

01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:16.200
But this gives you something to do to kind of pass the time.

01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:19.240
If maybe like you get back to the car and you find, oh, there's still seven minutes

01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:19.560
to go.

01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:24.280
I'll just sit here and diddle daddle on a game while I wait for my car to top off.

01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:25.800
And then I'm going to get back on the road.

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:28.120
It's a little bit, a little bit of a different way of thinking.

01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:33.480
So anyway, um, Bobby says, oh, those videos took way too much work for the little amount

01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:34.520
of views we were getting.

01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:36.520
Bobby, that's why I pimped them right now.

01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:38.680
Put them out there right now.

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:44.040
You should, you should put them on the Twitch channel, but like put them in the archive.

01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:51.080
Why don't we take the whole blizzard approach of this and don't you guys have phones?

01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:54.760
I mean, isn't that what cell phones are for?

01:13:56.680 --> 01:13:59.240
Yeah, but have you ever, have you ever ridden into Tesla?

01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:02.440
No, those, those screens are real nice.

01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:06.600
Like I, the, the, with the first time Bobby Blackwolf picked me up at the airport, we

01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:07.320
were going to dragon con.

01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:09.720
I got to ride, actually, I don't think it was an airport trip the very first time.

01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:13.080
I can't remember, but the very first time I was in his Tesla, I was like, this thing's

01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:14.040
like a fucking spaceship.

01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:14.920
This is cool.

01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:20.360
Like it's like, there's a lot of stuff in there that's not in cars normally, but instead

01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:25.080
it's like world's largest iPad is the whole like console type of thing.

01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:26.360
And it was just, it was cool.

01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:29.640
It was very different, but yeah, you kind of look around and you go, I feel like there's

01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:31.880
things missing in this car, but there are.

01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:34.840
That thing Missy was Stardew Valley.

01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:37.240
No, like an engine.

01:14:38.200 --> 01:14:42.120
Like, it's just like, again, like the whole, the frunk, as he calls it, there's, there's

01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:44.200
nothing in the front part of the car.

01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:46.520
Cause they have all the important stuffs underneath.

01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:47.800
So this is interesting.

01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:49.260
Anyway.

01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:51.560
All right.

01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:52.920
So Stardew Valley on Tesla.

01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:54.120
So there you go.

01:14:55.720 --> 01:15:00.760
Next up, let's do a follow-up and talk about the game awards again.

01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:05.320
We're going to talk a little bit about that X sex secret.

01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:08.680
The Xbox series X, the X, the X sucks.

01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:12.760
Well, just to take a little side note, actually, it's just supposed to be called.

01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:16.600
Xbox is actually, well, then you shouldn't have put out series X.

01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:18.280
Here's the thing.

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:18.840
No, no, no.

01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:21.160
This is, I think people are making way too big a deal out of it.

01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:24.920
So a business insider or somebody ran a thing where there was an interview where the next

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:28.360
gaming platform that Microsoft is putting out is called Xbox.

01:15:28.360 --> 01:15:30.920
And y'all done already knew known this.

01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:36.120
Because every time they release things on windows 10 that go back with Xbox, it's Xbox,

01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:41.640
Xbox gaming, Xbox game pass, Xbox, this Xbox, that that is the name of the platform.

01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:44.120
Series X is just the name of the device.

01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:49.000
And if you think this is weird and stupid, then I'm going to use the blizzard approach.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.200
Don't you all have phones?

01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:53.160
Because this is the same thing that cell phones do.

01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:54.380
Right.

01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:57.720
Do, do does a game like Stardew Valley?

01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:59.240
Is it Stardew Valley on cell phones?

01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:00.280
I'm assuming it is.

01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:00.520
Okay.

01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:05.080
So Stardew Valley, when you play it on your cell phone, you're playing it on iOS or Android,

01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:05.580
right?

01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:11.480
Now you might have an Apple iPhone 11 Max, but it's iOS.

01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:13.320
You might have an iPhone 6 iOS.

01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:15.160
You might have an iPad iOS.

01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:15.660
Okay.

01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:20.360
So what Microsoft's doing is actually not that crazy because I'm seeing all these hot

01:16:20.360 --> 01:16:24.520
takes that are like, boy, Microsoft just keeps rebooting themselves.

01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:25.560
And now it's just the original.

01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:27.080
Didn't they already do the original Xbox?

01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:29.800
Stop, stop.

01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:30.920
Be quiet, Tiffany.

01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:39.800
What it is is that the Xbox is, and that actually it makes the name Xbox one actually all that

01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:46.760
more interesting because if Xbox one is the first truly forward compatible console, then

01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:48.280
it is truly Xbox one.

01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:55.880
And now series X is going to be the 11 pro max of Xbox until the next thing comes out.

01:16:55.880 --> 01:16:57.560
If you laugh, cause it's ridiculous, guess what?

01:16:57.560 --> 01:16:58.760
Your phones are ridiculous too.

01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:03.560
So that's, that's my whole thing on the whole Xbox thing.

01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:08.120
So anyway, act Efton chat says, shut the fuck up, Karen.

01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:08.920
You don't know shit.

01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:11.000
That's exactly what I'm saying right now.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:11.320
All right.

01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:11.820
Anyway.

01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:17.240
But how did they keep the secret of the Xbox series X and the fact that there is a new

01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:21.000
Xbox console coming out and we were going to get to see it at the game awards?

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Well, what happened is that Jeff Keeley did an interview with variety.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.960
And actually mentioned that when they were doing dress rehearsals and walkthroughs,

01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:34.120
that there was actually a fake script that Phil Spencer was using.

01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:40.040
So everybody behind the scenes and at the dress rehearsal and on the crew, they all

01:17:40.040 --> 01:17:43.720
thought that Phil Spencer was going to be talking about Xbox game pass.

01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:46.600
Because that was what the script was about.

01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:51.160
And maybe that's where some of this talk about like control coming to Xbox game pass on.

01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:54.280
So, I mean, I know Phil Spencer had slipped up and said in a stream or something, but

01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:55.880
maybe all that stuff was like a front.

01:17:56.440 --> 01:17:58.280
Like, because maybe that was the lie.

01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:01.320
They may have been coming on stage with this whole lie about such and such games are coming

01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:06.920
to game pass and that actually, no, that wasn't, that was all, it was all a ruse because then

01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:11.880
the actual story, as we all know, and what we saw was that it was the Xbox series X,

01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:15.800
but I thought that was fascinating that they had a whole fake script that they used.

01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:18.600
So everybody thought he was coming out to talk about Xbox game pass.

01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:20.200
That's pretty cool.

01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:22.120
I mean, yeah, but you know what?

01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:24.600
Did, but did it leak?

01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:27.080
No, it did not.

01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:28.520
No one saw that one coming.

01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:30.120
So you know what?

01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:30.600
It worked.

01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:32.680
All right.

01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:35.400
Bobby Black Wolf wants to remind us, Jeff and I have something in common.

01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:37.160
We've both been seen in variety.

01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:40.920
Yes, that is true.

01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:41.480
That is true.

01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:43.080
All right.

01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:45.400
Let's, let's go back to a classic time.

01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:49.720
Let's go back to a time when variety was actually still a magazine.

01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:51.000
There was actually a variety magazine.

01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:53.960
I remember that magazine because we used to get it at work.

01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:54.360
That's right.

01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:56.760
It's the classic game of the week.

01:18:56.760 --> 01:19:00.760
And, uh, every week dark soccer steps into the vault and finds a game on the shelf that she

01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:02.680
thinks, Hmm, why?

01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:04.760
Yes, this would be a good selection.

01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:05.080
Yes.

01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:07.000
And everybody should check out this game this week.

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:07.800
Everyone really should.

01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:08.440
It's a good game.

01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:09.240
It is a, it is.

01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:10.040
It's one of those games.

01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:13.080
I'm kind of like, I'm really surprised she hasn't done this one, but again,

01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:14.280
I think it's a 10 year old game.

01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:15.000
I think it's one of those.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.360
It just turned 10, didn't it?

01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:16.840
Yes, it did.

01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:22.120
So dark soccer, that being said, what is the newly inducted classic game of the week?

01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:23.160
Dragon age origins.

01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:29.240
So of course, you know, it was the first of the dragon age games.

01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:32.200
Um, it was published by Bioware R.I.P.

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:35.560
The Bioware I knew and loved, um, and published by electronic arts.

01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:37.400
It is the first of the dragon age games.

01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:42.440
It was released on windows, PS3 and Xbox 360 in November, 2009.

01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:44.680
And on Mac OS December, 2009.

01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:51.720
God, that would have been OS 10.4, 5, something like that.

01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:58.920
Anyway, um, so it is set in the kingdom of Ferelden during, uh, a period where things

01:19:58.920 --> 01:20:00.040
are kind of shitty.

01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:06.360
And on top of there being political shittiness, there's, um, a, uh, a bunch of dark spawn

01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:11.160
running around because, uh, yeah, dark spawn are absolutely crap.

01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:16.840
And they're demons from, from, uh, the other world, from the, maybe from the Fade.

01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:19.400
I don't, I don't remember if they ever said that the dark spawn came from the Fade, but

01:20:19.400 --> 01:20:25.880
at any rate, um, but you play as one of three classes from three different backgrounds.

01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:28.360
Uh, you play a warrior, a mage or rogue.

01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:33.880
You can be elven, um, which actually I think in the elven, you either get, uh, as a mage,

01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:39.160
I think you start off as a circle mage and the others let you choose city elf or, uh,

01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:44.360
um, Dalish elf, which are basically like the, the wild elves.

01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:46.920
And then you can be a human or you can be a dwarf.

01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:52.760
Um, and you are recruited as a gray warden and you meet Alistair.

01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:54.120
Oh, he's so great.

01:20:54.680 --> 01:20:58.760
Um, because, uh, as, as he says, swooping is bad.

01:20:59.480 --> 01:21:03.720
But anyway, um, it's played in a third person perspective and you can shift it, uh, shift

01:21:03.720 --> 01:21:09.560
it to top down and you pick up other characters in the game that sometimes show up in later

01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:17.560
games, Morgan, um, and sometimes show up only in the comics, but it's really spawned this

01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:21.400
whole beautiful, uh, uh, right now, I guess trilogy.

01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:24.760
And, um, we're going to be having another dragon age game come out.

01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:30.920
So, um, but it really was well received and well reviewed, although I am glad that they

01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:36.600
went from not having the character have a voice to in dragon age two, where you could

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:39.480
actually, the character had dialogue and Hawk was awesome.

01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:50.440
But at any rate, um, the, uh, it's began development in 2002 had more than 144 voice

01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:57.160
actors, and it had, um, I non sort of, uh, compose the game's music and, uh, the console

01:21:57.160 --> 01:22:00.600
versions were outsourced to a group called edge of reality.

01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:06.440
Um, the first expansion port came out in March, 2010 as awakening.

01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:11.800
And then, uh, dragon age two came out in 2011 and dragon age inquisition came out in 2014.

01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:16.280
I've played this shit out of dragon age inquisition, just saying this is the game that

01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:21.160
brought Cullen into that with his beautiful voice actor who kind of sometimes goes off

01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:23.800
the deep end and goes missing for days and then they find him.

01:22:24.600 --> 01:22:29.080
Um, yeah, that was a bit of drama, but at any rate, um, so as you go through, you're

01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:34.200
a great warden, which being a great warden has you do something like part of it involves

01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:38.120
ingesting, uh, dark spawn blood and some other botanicals.

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:43.400
So I guess gin and, um, so you can sense the dark spawn, you get nightmares and stuff.

01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:48.840
Um, you can, you know, you've got your spell casting, you've got your rogue, which, um,

01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:51.800
I think in this one, I really preferred a rogue.

01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:56.200
Um, and dragon age two, I prefer to rogue, but I played a major in dragon age three because

01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:57.560
it was much easier.

01:22:57.560 --> 01:23:02.280
Um, so the classes that are available to you, as I said, you can sort of mix and match.

01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:07.400
We had dalish elf, dwarf commoner, a city elf, a major human noble or dwarf noble.

01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:11.160
Um, and it affects how the other characters will treat you.

01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:16.200
Um, however, they all follow pretty much the same completion of the story.

01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:25.320
Like for an example, if you play a, an elf and you get it on with Alistair and he becomes

01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:30.520
the king, you have to be as mistress because of the politics, the land, not permitting,

01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:33.960
um, the king to marry an elf.

01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:36.680
And it's actually, you know, not spoiler.

01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:41.880
He's elf blooded, you know, meaning that his mother was an elf, which you find out all

01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:46.520
about her in one of the books and in dragon age inquisition, because Fiona was kind of

01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:53.320
stupid, but at any rate, um, it was very similar in gameplay to star wars nights of the old

01:23:53.320 --> 01:24:01.320
Republic, um, where you engage, you have to engage the enemy and then attack that enemy.

01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:04.520
Um, or you can switch back to other enemies that you're fighting.

01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:09.000
You level up your warden with experience points, you know, like any type of RPG.

01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:15.880
Um, and then you can, um, get those points to distribute amongst your attributes.

01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:20.520
Um, you can interact with your party members and other NPCs.

01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:26.600
You have dialogue trees, which will unlock based on the things that you first select.

01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:32.680
So, um, and of course it also will sort of build again, your reputation with how you

01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:34.280
interact with these other characters.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:40.840
Um, and of course this really, I think, incorporated into later Bioware games.

01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:45.880
Cause you know, we had the, the paragon renegade dynamic in, um, mass effect, right?

01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:52.520
So, um, but at any rate you are in the world of Thedas, which, okay, this is going to sound

01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:58.200
kind of funny, but one of the things I always liked about it is that their world is actually

01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:00.120
set in a Southern hemisphere.

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:05.480
So the further South you go, the colder it gets in the further North you go, the warmer

01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:05.960
it gets.

01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:11.240
Um, and they are in the middle of a blight and the dark spawn are being shits and you

01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:11.880
got to stop them.

01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:21.320
Um, so of course this game brought us like some of the most, I would say memorable characters.

01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:24.600
I mean, just because I freaking love Alistair.

01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:27.080
Like he's one of my favorite characters ever in a game.

01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:33.480
There's Morrigan who, uh, you know, was raised by, uh, well, I don't want to spoil too much

01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:38.680
if you are going to go in and play the games later, but her mother is Flemeth who is voiced

01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:39.480
by Kate Mulgrew.

01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:47.080
So, um, you have, uh, Ogrin the Dwarf who is just like, I love him cause he's drunk

01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:47.880
all the time.

01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:52.440
You have Wynn who actually ended up, uh, she was, I didn't care for her in the game so

01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:56.280
much, but I really liked her in one of the later novels.

01:25:56.280 --> 01:25:57.880
I really liked her character in the novels.

01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:03.480
Um, you have Zevran who is the, uh, the Elvish assassin who wants to fuck everybody.

01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:07.320
Um, you have a dog, a Mabari.

01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:10.200
And of course the first thing I do is put in the mod so that you can have them in your

01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:14.840
party all the time, even if he's not actually in your party, because I love dog.

01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:15.720
I just named him dog.

01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:16.680
But can you pet the dog?

01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:19.240
You can play with him.

01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:19.740
Yeah.

01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:25.320
Um, he also in the DLC, you get a character named Shale who has a golem who, uh, hates

01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:30.200
birds and, um, you actually find out more about Shale later on through the game.

01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:36.520
Shale was a dwarf who was part of like some ritual to turn her into a golem and she's

01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:37.640
sarcastic as fuck.

01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:38.600
That is my bitch.

01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:39.560
I love her.

01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:46.200
Um, you get, uh, Sten who is, uh, Qunari, um, and I mean, and Leliana.

01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:47.480
I love Leliana.

01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:51.240
She, um, and a lot of these characters will make appearances in Dragon Age 2, but you

01:26:51.240 --> 01:26:57.160
get Leliana as a ongoing character in Dragon Age 3 as your spy, not 3, but Inquisition

01:26:57.160 --> 01:26:57.960
as your spy master.

01:26:57.960 --> 01:26:59.880
I just freaking, I love all these characters.

01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:03.400
Like I like a series when I like all the characters and the ones that I hate, I really fucking

01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:03.900
hate.

01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:12.700
Um, like I hated the character Logain so much that I actually went in and let him live so

01:27:12.700 --> 01:27:17.100
that I could feed him to the, the darkspawn in a later game.

01:27:18.060 --> 01:27:18.540
Nice.

01:27:18.540 --> 01:27:28.220
Um, it's just, I, I freaking, I freaking love this game and, and it is a bit more of a mature

01:27:28.220 --> 01:27:31.100
game, you know, it's a memory game.

01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:37.020
Um, so, but it is just really fun.

01:27:37.020 --> 01:27:44.060
I mean, you think about this first game being a game from 2009, it doesn't look too bad

01:27:44.060 --> 01:27:45.580
for being a 10 year old game.

01:27:45.580 --> 01:27:47.580
I thought they did a great job with it.

01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:52.060
And since then, people have done their own high res mods like they did from, you've seen

01:27:52.060 --> 01:27:57.260
the high res mods for Mass Effect 3 on PC, but they've done, um, you know, there's a

01:27:57.260 --> 01:28:02.620
massive modding community for this, like custom hairstyles and outfits and all kinds

01:28:02.620 --> 01:28:05.260
of, you know, gorgeous stuff.

01:28:05.260 --> 01:28:13.980
And there is even a, um, what's the word I'm trying to think, a graphic nookie mod for

01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:16.700
getting it on sexy times with your characters so that them just standing where they're

01:28:16.700 --> 01:28:17.200
nowhere.

01:28:17.740 --> 01:28:26.780
Um, and it really, I mean, it's probably, I'd say one of the best games that came out.

01:28:26.860 --> 01:28:29.820
I mean, the DLC adds a lot more to it.

01:28:29.820 --> 01:28:35.420
Um, you also have some crossovers with, uh, BioWare's other games, like in Mass Effect

01:28:35.420 --> 01:28:40.940
2, you can get the blood dragon armor, which comes directly from this game.

01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:46.460
So, and, um, as far as the DLC, we had the stone prisoners that gives you shale.

01:28:46.460 --> 01:28:51.740
We had the warden's keep that, um, adds the fortress of soldiers peak.

01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:57.420
And you get a little bit more about the gray wardens, um, returned to Ostagar, which is

01:28:57.420 --> 01:28:59.660
the first battlefield that you fight on.

01:28:59.660 --> 01:29:06.780
Then awakening came out, which was basically the aftermath of origins where, uh, you have

01:29:06.780 --> 01:29:11.100
to stop this creature called the architect, which I think the architect was the sort of

01:29:11.100 --> 01:29:14.860
lead into the main, uh, antagonist for dragon age inquisition.

01:29:14.860 --> 01:29:21.180
You had the dark spawn Chronicles where you basically are, uh, playing as the dark spawn

01:29:21.180 --> 01:29:26.860
army, um, and you have Leliana's song, which is, you know, some of her experiences, the

01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:31.820
golems of Amgarak and witch hunt, which is where you go look for Morgan after she fucks

01:29:31.820 --> 01:29:38.860
off into, you know, Heriluvian, which is a new war that takes you into the Fade or some

01:29:38.860 --> 01:29:39.660
intermediary place.

01:29:39.660 --> 01:29:42.380
Not really the Fade, it's like an intermediary that kind of works like the Fade.

01:29:43.020 --> 01:29:45.180
Um, but yeah, this game is great.

01:29:45.180 --> 01:29:51.100
It, it's been, I mean, I don't know why people said that the graphics weren't super great,

01:29:51.100 --> 01:29:54.700
but it was pretty, I mean, but they said that a lot of it was really eye catching, but some

01:29:54.700 --> 01:29:59.660
people were saying, like I was saying that, you know, even ace me, the nookie scenes are

01:29:59.660 --> 01:30:00.700
just really anticlimactic.

01:30:01.260 --> 01:30:06.380
So, um, yeah, tons of mods, tons of mods.

01:30:06.380 --> 01:30:11.740
And like I said, it is spawned a, uh, a franchise.

01:30:12.060 --> 01:30:16.700
There's also a free to play game called Heroes of Dragon Age that's on iOS, which I've played

01:30:16.700 --> 01:30:17.420
for a little bit.

01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:21.900
Um, and there is another, uh, Dragon Age game coming out.

01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:24.940
We've already seen some teaser information, just a little bit leaked.

01:30:25.420 --> 01:30:33.420
Um, we know it's going to be, uh, uh, set in, um, well, actually I'll say if you, if you

01:30:33.420 --> 01:30:36.620
haven't read the spoilers and you don't want the spoilers, then I'm not going to say anything

01:30:36.620 --> 01:30:37.340
about it.

01:30:37.340 --> 01:30:40.060
I personally was excited.

01:30:40.060 --> 01:30:40.700
Fuck, I'll just say it.

01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:44.780
It's set into Vinter, which you don't really, you hear a lot about this place, but you don't

01:30:44.780 --> 01:30:46.700
really know a lot about it.

01:30:46.700 --> 01:30:49.580
So I think that it's going to be just really awesome.

01:30:49.580 --> 01:30:53.340
And I'm glad this game came out because it gave me one of my absolute favorite franchises,

01:30:53.340 --> 01:30:56.300
but I'd have to say thank you to Mass Effect for getting me into Dragon Age.

01:30:56.860 --> 01:30:57.740
All right.

01:30:57.740 --> 01:30:58.780
I think the video looped.

01:30:59.900 --> 01:31:00.860
That's all right.

01:31:00.860 --> 01:31:01.500
So there it is.

01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:02.460
I think I can breathe now.

01:31:02.460 --> 01:31:02.940
That's fine.

01:31:02.940 --> 01:31:05.980
Your classic game of the week is Dragon Age.

01:31:06.620 --> 01:31:07.020
Good pick.

01:31:07.580 --> 01:31:08.220
Good pick.

01:31:08.220 --> 01:31:11.020
I have to admit, I never got into Dragon Age as much as I did Mass Effect.

01:31:11.020 --> 01:31:17.100
And I think for some reason, like I, I, I, I clicked a little more with Inquisition and

01:31:17.100 --> 01:31:20.140
I think just maybe some of the upgrades to the actual game part of it.

01:31:20.140 --> 01:31:21.820
How could you let Alistair become a drunk?

01:31:23.020 --> 01:31:28.940
Anyway, uh, many, many different ways the story can play out in, in a game like Dragon

01:31:28.940 --> 01:31:29.180
Age.

01:31:29.180 --> 01:31:33.580
And as Dark Sakura said, uh, Kay Mogru in the voice acting cast, you know, the only

01:31:33.580 --> 01:31:37.980
thing cooler than that, that I can really think of, uh, is Linda Carter in, uh, Skyrim.

01:31:38.540 --> 01:31:42.380
Um, and I mean, Lindsay Wagner in, um, Death Stranding.

01:31:42.380 --> 01:31:45.740
Although she didn't, it's her likeness for the younger version.

01:31:45.740 --> 01:31:46.220
Likeness.

01:31:46.220 --> 01:31:46.780
Yeah.

01:31:46.780 --> 01:31:48.380
But her voice for the older version.

01:31:48.380 --> 01:31:49.100
Yes.

01:31:49.100 --> 01:31:49.660
Yeah.

01:31:49.660 --> 01:31:50.860
Lindsay Wagner, man.

01:31:50.860 --> 01:31:54.060
Man, has Leslie and Warren ever been in a video game?

01:31:54.060 --> 01:31:54.780
That's what we need.

01:31:54.780 --> 01:31:58.860
We need all these television stars of, uh, the seventies and eighties to, uh, come back.

01:31:58.860 --> 01:32:00.300
Leslie and Warren was awesome.

01:32:00.300 --> 01:32:02.220
Leslie and Warren was awesome.

01:32:02.220 --> 01:32:06.140
They did a Mission Impossible game years ago, but it was that, do you remember when ABC

01:32:06.140 --> 01:32:07.820
did that reboot in the nineties?

01:32:08.780 --> 01:32:13.980
Brad from Pod Culture points out that Eve Miles was in, uh, she was actually in Dragon

01:32:13.980 --> 01:32:17.420
Age 2, um, as Meryl.

01:32:17.420 --> 01:32:19.420
I wanted to romance her and then she pissed me off.

01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:22.140
So, um, but yeah, she was Meryl.

01:32:22.140 --> 01:32:22.620
All right.

01:32:22.620 --> 01:32:23.260
So anyway.

01:32:23.260 --> 01:32:23.580
All right.

01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:26.620
Hashtag Leslie and Warren for epic video game, please.

01:32:28.060 --> 01:32:29.420
We need to do the clue MMO.

01:32:30.140 --> 01:32:31.980
You know, you know, they're doing clue MO.

01:32:31.980 --> 01:32:32.780
They're doing that.

01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:33.980
It's not just clue though.

01:32:33.980 --> 01:32:35.500
Obviously she was a Mission Impossible.

01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:37.580
She had a lot of television movies and stuff back in the day.

01:32:37.660 --> 01:32:40.060
But, um, oh, says Linda Hamilton and Gears 5.

01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:42.940
That's Linda Hamilton's more like a nineties.

01:32:42.940 --> 01:32:46.860
She's the only reason I want to see that terrible Terminator movie that you actually saw it.

01:32:46.860 --> 01:32:50.540
No, I didn't see it, but I want to see it because I forgot all about that movie.

01:32:50.540 --> 01:32:51.580
Oh, the Terminator dark.

01:32:51.580 --> 01:32:52.860
It was apparently terrible.

01:32:52.860 --> 01:32:56.940
Speaking of terrible movies, uh, dark soccer and I have it going to be terrible.

01:32:56.940 --> 01:32:58.060
We have a Christmas date.

01:32:58.060 --> 01:32:59.100
We're going to go see cats.

01:32:59.100 --> 01:33:01.260
We're going to go see the patched version of cats.

01:33:01.260 --> 01:33:01.420
Okay.

01:33:01.420 --> 01:33:06.700
So the reason they patched it actually, because not all of the visual effects had been, um,

01:33:06.780 --> 01:33:07.740
in the release version.

01:33:07.740 --> 01:33:08.780
They released the wrong version.

01:33:10.620 --> 01:33:10.860
Okay.

01:33:10.860 --> 01:33:12.300
So there's been a lot of talk on.

01:33:12.300 --> 01:33:14.220
I now want to see the unpatched version.

01:33:14.220 --> 01:33:15.580
That sounds even better.

01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:18.140
It's like you could see Judi Dench's hands in one scene.

01:33:19.420 --> 01:33:24.300
Everybody's fucking talking about how, oh, here we are 2019.

01:33:24.300 --> 01:33:27.180
Now we're patching our movies, just like our video games.

01:33:27.180 --> 01:33:29.420
And it's like, it's like, isn't that the tea?

01:33:30.060 --> 01:33:37.500
Like, Oh, we, we had to in new in cats, version 1.1 fixed Judi Dench's hand in the,

01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:39.900
you know, jealous old dance.

01:33:39.900 --> 01:33:42.060
I want the unpassed version on Blu-ray.

01:33:42.060 --> 01:33:44.940
Doesn't Judi Dench play, um, old Deuteronomy.

01:33:44.940 --> 01:33:45.340
She does.

01:33:45.900 --> 01:33:46.540
Yeah.

01:33:46.540 --> 01:33:51.020
Actually, I'm kind of interested to see them do old Deuteronomy in a female role.

01:33:51.020 --> 01:33:53.900
Cause old Deuteronomy on stage was always a male role.

01:33:55.020 --> 01:33:56.620
So yeah, no, look, well, here's the thing.

01:33:56.620 --> 01:34:00.540
So Dark Soccer and I, we have a Christmas date because Dark Soccer is Jewish.

01:34:00.540 --> 01:34:05.260
So, you know, whatever with Christmas and our plans, uh, that we usually do kind of

01:34:05.260 --> 01:34:08.300
fell through, but nobody has to truly be alone on Christmas.

01:34:08.300 --> 01:34:11.900
So Dark Soccer is going to be my Christmas Eve or Christmas day.

01:34:13.340 --> 01:34:15.660
Dan and I do, um, our presence on Christmas Eve.

01:34:15.660 --> 01:34:18.060
And we've always done things with my dad on Christmas Eve.

01:34:18.060 --> 01:34:20.060
So, uh, we're still doing that.

01:34:20.060 --> 01:34:24.140
If we can also find the, uh, like an Asian food place that's open, then that has happened too.

01:34:24.140 --> 01:34:25.900
But we're going to go see Cats.

01:34:25.900 --> 01:34:28.540
And yes, we've heard how bad it is.

01:34:28.540 --> 01:34:32.220
Um, I don't know about you, you Dark Soccer, but I don't give a fuck.

01:34:32.220 --> 01:34:34.220
Like I still, I really wanted to see it.

01:34:34.220 --> 01:34:36.140
No, I want to love it and all its badness.

01:34:36.140 --> 01:34:37.500
I'm going to sing right along with it.

01:34:37.500 --> 01:34:38.140
Here's the thing.

01:34:38.140 --> 01:34:39.020
Here's the thing.

01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:40.780
I understand that the movie is terrible.

01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:46.140
Did you know, fun fact, the play that it's based on is also terrible.

01:34:46.140 --> 01:34:47.100
No, it's not.

01:34:47.100 --> 01:34:48.940
So what were you expecting?

01:34:48.940 --> 01:34:49.900
It's not terrible.

01:34:50.860 --> 01:34:53.900
It was my only play I've ever seen on Broadway.

01:34:53.900 --> 01:34:56.860
I saw it at the Winter Garden Theater when I was in high school.

01:34:56.860 --> 01:35:00.300
And you know what they did in the Winter Garden Theater after they got rid of my beloved cats?

01:35:01.020 --> 01:35:01.740
Mamma Mia.

01:35:01.740 --> 01:35:02.240
Rocky.

01:35:02.860 --> 01:35:03.900
No, that wasn't in the Winter Garden.

01:35:03.900 --> 01:35:04.460
That was Winter Garden.

01:35:04.460 --> 01:35:05.660
It was Circle in the Square.

01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:08.700
No, I thought that the first place that it played on was Winter Garden after Cats ended.

01:35:08.700 --> 01:35:09.260
Did it?

01:35:09.260 --> 01:35:10.620
That was Circle Gets the Square?

01:35:10.620 --> 01:35:11.260
No, there's just-

01:35:11.260 --> 01:35:12.140
I'll double check.

01:35:12.140 --> 01:35:13.180
Square Gets the Circle.

01:35:13.180 --> 01:35:13.660
All right.

01:35:13.660 --> 01:35:13.980
Anyway.

01:35:13.980 --> 01:35:15.260
Cats is not fucking horrible.

01:35:15.260 --> 01:35:16.460
So shut the fuck up.

01:35:16.460 --> 01:35:18.860
It's, it's bad in a good way.

01:35:18.860 --> 01:35:22.300
It's one of those, this is, it's cheese, but Xanadu.

01:35:22.300 --> 01:35:23.820
It's Xanadu bad.

01:35:24.380 --> 01:35:25.100
It's not bad though.

01:35:26.220 --> 01:35:28.540
I mean, no, it really isn't bad.

01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:31.660
I mean, you have to look at the source material is, you know, a T.S.

01:35:31.660 --> 01:35:32.620
Elliot book.

01:35:32.620 --> 01:35:37.980
It was a bunch of disparate poems about cats and it's there just to have the spotlight on

01:35:37.980 --> 01:35:38.940
each cat.

01:35:38.940 --> 01:35:40.780
That to me is what it is.

01:35:40.780 --> 01:35:43.180
Each cat has our own little spotlight.

01:35:43.180 --> 01:35:47.260
It shows the playfulness of, of the animals.

01:35:47.260 --> 01:35:51.580
It shows, you know, just a little bit of, if you would humanize them, what their lives

01:35:51.580 --> 01:35:52.220
would be like.

01:35:52.220 --> 01:35:56.940
I mean, I really just, well, then again, I am like, that was Xanadu where I like all

01:35:56.940 --> 01:36:02.060
the parts of it, but I, I freaking, I don't even know where my poor CD is.

01:36:02.060 --> 01:36:05.340
I played it so much and sang with it so much.

01:36:05.340 --> 01:36:06.620
Cats is not bad.

01:36:06.620 --> 01:36:08.380
You have to look at it as a sum.

01:36:09.420 --> 01:36:12.140
So, and you know, go ahead.

01:36:13.180 --> 01:36:14.140
No, that's fine.

01:36:14.140 --> 01:36:16.300
I'm gonna make the stupid joke after you're done.

01:36:16.300 --> 01:36:20.460
Because I was going to say, y'all know, if you don't know, you're going to know, I love

01:36:20.460 --> 01:36:22.860
the movie showgirls from the mid nineties.

01:36:22.860 --> 01:36:25.820
I was just going to say it's no showgirls, but yeah.

01:36:25.820 --> 01:36:26.540
And here's the thing.

01:36:26.540 --> 01:36:27.820
Here's the thing about showgirls.

01:36:27.820 --> 01:36:30.460
Showgirls really truly is one of those movies that like, it's so bad.

01:36:30.460 --> 01:36:32.300
It's kind of good, but it's one of those movies.

01:36:32.300 --> 01:36:35.580
Like I could just kind of like have on in the background as I'm like going about my

01:36:35.580 --> 01:36:35.980
day.

01:36:35.980 --> 01:36:37.180
It's a Christmas movie.

01:36:37.180 --> 01:36:41.100
I can be cleaning, you know, or whatever, or, or getting something organized or something.

01:36:41.100 --> 01:36:43.100
And then like, you know, come along and I'll be quoting along with the movie.

01:36:43.100 --> 01:36:44.140
You know, you don't know shit.

01:36:44.700 --> 01:36:45.420
Where are you from?

01:36:45.420 --> 01:36:45.980
Back East.

01:36:45.980 --> 01:36:46.780
Where back East?

01:36:46.780 --> 01:36:47.980
Different places.

01:36:47.980 --> 01:36:52.460
You know, like it's just, you can just, it's like one of those great, like background movies.

01:36:52.460 --> 01:36:57.580
And you know, there, there, there was a point they were trying to make somewhere in there.

01:36:58.860 --> 01:37:01.180
There was a point to be made in there somewhere.

01:37:02.780 --> 01:37:04.460
Didn't they make a sequel to that movie?

01:37:05.900 --> 01:37:06.380
Showgirls.

01:37:06.380 --> 01:37:07.020
I thought they did.

01:37:07.020 --> 01:37:13.900
It's about the, um, the girl from the, the other dancer that the one guy is with the,

01:37:13.900 --> 01:37:15.820
that one guy with the dreads is with.

01:37:16.380 --> 01:37:17.740
And then it's like about her.

01:37:18.060 --> 01:37:20.780
And it was, it was not lauded.

01:37:22.540 --> 01:37:23.020
Yeah.

01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:25.580
It, it, don't try to read too much into the plot.

01:37:25.580 --> 01:37:26.380
Just, just don't.

01:37:26.380 --> 01:37:28.860
Although it would have been awesome if they'd made the sequel.

01:37:28.860 --> 01:37:31.740
Cause you know, the end of the movie was a teaser for the sequel.

01:37:31.740 --> 01:37:35.100
Cause she gets back in, I mean, spoiler alert for Showgirls.

01:37:35.100 --> 01:37:38.060
But at the end of the movie, she gets back in the car with the hitchhiker that dropped

01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:39.820
her off in the beginning and then stole her stuff.

01:37:39.820 --> 01:37:43.820
So she gets back in the car and they going off and you see that they're on their way

01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:44.620
to Hollywood.

01:37:44.620 --> 01:37:46.140
There's a sign that says Hollywood.

01:37:46.140 --> 01:37:50.780
Well, the second movie, cause I mean, justice for Showgirls, there should be a Showgirls

01:37:50.780 --> 01:37:51.260
too.

01:37:51.260 --> 01:37:52.220
The second movie was good.

01:37:52.220 --> 01:37:55.020
Well, I, and actually there was a Showgirls too, but it wasn't the same thing.

01:37:55.020 --> 01:37:56.380
That was all about Penny.

01:37:56.380 --> 01:37:56.880
Yeah.

01:37:57.740 --> 01:37:58.540
I couldn't remember her name.

01:37:59.100 --> 01:38:02.620
Rena something is the actress's name and she did it all herself.

01:38:02.620 --> 01:38:07.020
But anyway, um, the second movie was going to be a Hollywood parody.

01:38:07.020 --> 01:38:12.860
And instead we got, uh, Alan Smithy presents burn Hollywood burn, which I'm convinced

01:38:12.860 --> 01:38:15.340
some of that was the concept for Showgirls too.

01:38:15.340 --> 01:38:16.460
I haven't seen that.

01:38:16.460 --> 01:38:20.860
It's like that movie is bad and period.

01:38:20.860 --> 01:38:26.780
There's no, there's no, but yet, although no, it's, it's just bad with a period.

01:38:26.780 --> 01:38:30.940
I want them to make a sequel to cats, but with all the internet meme cats, like grumpy

01:38:30.940 --> 01:38:35.580
cat, long cat, I want to find out what happens to them when we, you know?

01:38:36.460 --> 01:38:37.020
All right.

01:38:37.020 --> 01:38:38.700
Anyhow, so let's move on.

01:38:38.700 --> 01:38:38.940
Oh yes.

01:38:38.940 --> 01:38:40.140
That was all the classic game of the week.

01:38:40.140 --> 01:38:40.540
Sorry.

01:38:40.540 --> 01:38:41.340
Uh, tangents.

01:38:41.340 --> 01:38:41.900
They happen.

01:38:41.900 --> 01:38:45.500
Let's get into some rapid fire news and talk about some other things happening around in

01:38:45.500 --> 01:38:48.140
the game world very quickly, starting off with Loki.

01:38:48.140 --> 01:38:49.100
So this is kind of cute.

01:38:49.100 --> 01:38:54.780
Then if you have a Japanese region switch or you happen to have an account in the Japanese

01:38:54.780 --> 01:39:01.580
region and you have Labo, um, or Labo VR cartridge, you can actually play a Christmas

01:39:01.580 --> 01:39:03.420
themed Labo mini game.

01:39:03.980 --> 01:39:08.460
Um, with that, it's basically a Santa platformer on rooftops.

01:39:09.420 --> 01:39:10.860
So that's the neat thing.

01:39:10.860 --> 01:39:17.100
Basically you have to have the Japanese news channel, um, so you make your free, uh, Japanese

01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:19.580
region switch account and you can get it through there.

01:39:20.620 --> 01:39:21.260
All right.

01:39:21.260 --> 01:39:26.620
And then in 2020, we've got our first games with golden ounce.

01:39:26.620 --> 01:39:30.780
So we have, uh, for Xbox one, six shards of darkness.

01:39:31.660 --> 01:39:36.620
And then we've got Batman and telltale series, and those are both Xbox one and then your

01:39:36.620 --> 01:39:42.220
Xbox 360 compatible games, Tekken six and Lego star Wars to the original trilogy.

01:39:44.220 --> 01:39:45.100
That's it.

01:39:45.100 --> 01:39:45.500
All right.

01:39:46.060 --> 01:39:51.980
Uh, well going to the switch and Nintendo, um, Nintendo made a yule log video because

01:39:51.980 --> 01:39:54.300
this is the time of year where companies are making you log videos.

01:39:54.300 --> 01:39:54.460
Yeah.

01:39:54.460 --> 01:39:58.700
Like, isn't there like the Overwatch, the Overwatch guy, Jeff, just sitting there with

01:39:58.700 --> 01:39:59.500
a yule log or something.

01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:03.420
There's that there's steam has one that's part of their steam sale right now.

01:40:03.500 --> 01:40:03.980
I know.

01:40:03.980 --> 01:40:05.340
Was it Linus Texas?

01:40:05.340 --> 01:40:06.620
They did an eight K one.

01:40:06.620 --> 01:40:06.940
Yeah.

01:40:06.940 --> 01:40:07.980
I don't anyway.

01:40:07.980 --> 01:40:12.700
Um, so, uh, there's a new sights and sounds video that was put out by Nintendo where you

01:40:12.700 --> 01:40:17.260
can just watch somebody play their switch for half an hour in front of a fire.

01:40:18.460 --> 01:40:23.500
Sadly, the switch has never thrown into the fire because I know you all want to know dark

01:40:23.500 --> 01:40:27.500
souls or like, like a rage thing that happens.

01:40:27.500 --> 01:40:27.820
Yeah.

01:40:27.820 --> 01:40:32.220
Playing dark souls or something or like, I can't beat this fucking level of Mario Odyssey.

01:40:32.220 --> 01:40:33.020
Fuck this thing.

01:40:33.580 --> 01:40:35.740
The drift on these controllers is so bad.

01:40:35.740 --> 01:40:37.740
That makes me want to throw them into the fire.

01:40:38.460 --> 01:40:39.980
Speaking of steam.

01:40:39.980 --> 01:40:40.300
Yes.

01:40:40.300 --> 01:40:43.740
The winter sale just recently kicked off this past week.

01:40:43.740 --> 01:40:46.060
It's running concurrently with the steam awards thing.

01:40:46.060 --> 01:40:49.020
So there's lots of games on sale there through Thursday.

01:40:49.020 --> 01:40:50.940
January 2nd is when that ends.

01:40:50.940 --> 01:40:54.220
So I'm sure there's a lot of people that are, you know, going like supermarket sweep and

01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:58.540
shoving their cart full of hams right now and whatever like cheap video games they're

01:40:58.540 --> 01:41:00.700
waiting to catch up on.

01:41:00.700 --> 01:41:04.540
Something to keep in mind, like you said earlier in the show humble bundle.

01:41:04.540 --> 01:41:04.700
Yeah.

01:41:04.700 --> 01:41:11.260
And I just, I just didn't do that because I was looking for a certain game for my son

01:41:11.260 --> 01:41:11.820
on the switch.

01:41:13.180 --> 01:41:17.660
Trials rising because he likes playing the demo for PlayStation four.

01:41:17.660 --> 01:41:19.980
And I just, I'm not moving the PlayStation four to his room.

01:41:20.860 --> 01:41:23.900
So I got it for him on his PC.

01:41:23.900 --> 01:41:27.100
And so I gifted it to him in steam because I know he'll never get it before Christmas

01:41:27.100 --> 01:41:28.940
because he never opened steam ever.

01:41:28.940 --> 01:41:31.660
So we'll be fine there.

01:41:31.660 --> 01:41:32.460
Be fine.

01:41:32.460 --> 01:41:32.700
Good.

01:41:33.260 --> 01:41:33.820
So there's that.

01:41:33.820 --> 01:41:36.540
And then the Epic store is doing a sale as well.

01:41:36.540 --> 01:41:40.220
They are also giving away 12 free games, one each day.

01:41:40.220 --> 01:41:41.420
And I'm actually kind of pissed off.

01:41:41.420 --> 01:41:44.060
I missed the first couple of days because super hot was one of the games.

01:41:44.060 --> 01:41:46.540
Yeah, I already have it, but I didn't have that yet.

01:41:46.540 --> 01:41:47.900
I missed it yesterday.

01:41:47.900 --> 01:41:49.740
Towerfall Ascension was one of the games too.

01:41:49.740 --> 01:41:51.340
That was, yeah, two days ago.

01:41:51.340 --> 01:41:56.300
And today was I got today's little inferno, which I was today already having like all

01:41:56.300 --> 01:41:58.380
these platforms still played it.

01:41:58.380 --> 01:42:01.420
I feel like it's one of those things where like the last one will be a big one.

01:42:01.420 --> 01:42:01.900
You know?

01:42:01.900 --> 01:42:04.300
I mean, Epic store gave away, it's Fortnite.

01:42:04.300 --> 01:42:07.340
And that's the Epic store gave away those Batman games.

01:42:07.340 --> 01:42:07.980
Not that long ago.

01:42:07.980 --> 01:42:09.180
Those are some great games.

01:42:09.180 --> 01:42:10.220
Like we never played them.

01:42:10.220 --> 01:42:14.380
So my Epic library is getting quite large because of all those free games.

01:42:14.380 --> 01:42:14.620
Yeah.

01:42:14.620 --> 01:42:16.700
Considering I've never spent a penny on that store.

01:42:16.700 --> 01:42:17.660
I have a lot of games.

01:42:18.300 --> 01:42:19.580
Well, they also have a thing right now.

01:42:19.580 --> 01:42:21.020
And that's the Sarpin epic step.

01:42:21.020 --> 01:42:24.780
But if you want a game for that's 14 99 or above, they'll give you 10 bucks off.

01:42:24.780 --> 01:42:24.940
Yeah.

01:42:24.940 --> 01:42:26.860
That's kind of, that's their sale instead of that.

01:42:26.860 --> 01:42:29.180
Cause you know, steam makes the mini game out of it and all that stuff.

01:42:29.180 --> 01:42:32.620
So Epic just, well, they still have stuff discounted too, but it's, well, the Epic

01:42:32.620 --> 01:42:33.340
and, you know, okay.

01:42:33.340 --> 01:42:36.060
So since we've been talking them up, let me knock them down a few pegs.

01:42:36.060 --> 01:42:38.300
The Epic store still kind of sucks in a lot of ways.

01:42:38.300 --> 01:42:41.420
Like the fact that they don't have the prepaid cards and that whole thing.

01:42:41.420 --> 01:42:44.300
And the fact, you know, it's still kind of a bare bones thing.

01:42:44.300 --> 01:42:48.220
So, I mean, the fact that they're doing a bare bones sale isn't too terribly

01:42:48.220 --> 01:42:49.660
surprising at the end of that.

01:42:49.660 --> 01:42:52.460
I can't use V bucks on, uh, the Epic store.

01:42:52.460 --> 01:42:54.380
I mean, that is their currency for Fortnite.

01:42:54.380 --> 01:42:56.220
So I don't think so.

01:42:56.220 --> 01:42:59.020
Uh, the power is saying super hot was on Twitch prime earlier this year.

01:42:59.020 --> 01:42:59.740
Did I miss it?

01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:00.940
I must have.

01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:02.140
I don't remember.

01:43:02.140 --> 01:43:05.180
Like I ever played any of the games I have through Twitch prime anyways.

01:43:05.180 --> 01:43:06.620
I know I have a library there too.

01:43:06.620 --> 01:43:08.620
And I couldn't tell you what's on it.

01:43:08.620 --> 01:43:09.020
I know.

01:43:09.020 --> 01:43:09.740
Right.

01:43:09.740 --> 01:43:12.460
So, Hey, is there, is there a gift thing on Twitch prime right now?

01:43:12.460 --> 01:43:13.820
Maybe we need to open up the box.

01:43:13.820 --> 01:43:15.020
We haven't done that in a few weeks.

01:43:15.580 --> 01:43:18.060
So, and since Bobby's there and paying attention, maybe.

01:43:18.060 --> 01:43:19.180
Um, cause it doesn't work.

01:43:19.180 --> 01:43:20.780
So here's what the deal is.

01:43:20.780 --> 01:43:23.580
I'm logged into my account here.

01:43:23.660 --> 01:43:29.980
So I can't actually open the box because that is something that happens on the VOG.

01:43:29.980 --> 01:43:31.580
I have to be on VOG account to open the box.

01:43:31.580 --> 01:43:32.780
That's why I always yell at Bobby.

01:43:32.780 --> 01:43:33.420
Thank you, Bobby.

01:43:33.420 --> 01:43:33.980
Open the box.

01:43:34.540 --> 01:43:37.580
Uh, and it's a legal, it's a league of legends mystery skin this week.

01:43:37.580 --> 01:43:39.900
So that's something that, um, some folks might actually want.

01:43:39.900 --> 01:43:41.740
So free grub hub.

01:43:41.740 --> 01:43:46.060
I'm going to just throw in some, uh, stuff into there as well.

01:43:46.060 --> 01:43:48.940
You know, they kind of stopped giving away games on Twitch.

01:43:48.940 --> 01:43:49.020
Yeah.

01:43:49.020 --> 01:43:51.980
It's a lot of learn more and I'm like, I don't want to learn.

01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:53.420
I just want free things.

01:43:55.820 --> 01:43:59.660
Oh, there's also speaking of which, um, there's a discord slash

01:43:59.660 --> 01:44:01.340
X-Box thing going on right now.

01:44:01.340 --> 01:44:03.900
So if you have X-Box, I think it's game pass.

01:44:05.020 --> 01:44:06.540
Maybe it's X-Box gold.

01:44:06.540 --> 01:44:06.940
Sorry.

01:44:06.940 --> 01:44:07.980
I don't remember off the top of my head.

01:44:07.980 --> 01:44:09.020
It's cause I have both.

01:44:09.020 --> 01:44:12.060
It's one of the X-Box things you can get three months of discord nitro.

01:44:12.860 --> 01:44:14.380
So you can like boost the box server.

01:44:14.380 --> 01:44:16.220
No, we need a lot of boost to get to the next level.

01:44:16.220 --> 01:44:18.860
But, uh, but, and it goes the other way around too.

01:44:18.860 --> 01:44:22.220
If you have discord nitro, you can get free X-Box game pass for

01:44:22.220 --> 01:44:23.500
like three months or something like that.

01:44:23.500 --> 01:44:25.420
So, um, yeah, check that out.

01:44:25.420 --> 01:44:26.540
It's game pass ultimate.

01:44:26.540 --> 01:44:26.940
Thank you.

01:44:27.820 --> 01:44:28.860
So check that out.

01:44:28.860 --> 01:44:31.100
If you're on one or the other, the discord or X-Box thing.

01:44:31.100 --> 01:44:32.860
Cause that is a thing that's pretty nice.

01:44:32.860 --> 01:44:36.380
So, uh, and one month of EA access through the X-Box thing as well.

01:44:36.380 --> 01:44:36.700
That's right.

01:44:36.700 --> 01:44:38.060
I need to turn that on.

01:44:38.060 --> 01:44:40.700
I'm trying to think what's on EA access that might want to play, but I'm

01:44:40.700 --> 01:44:42.700
sure there's probably the new need for speed game actually.

01:44:42.700 --> 01:44:43.660
I'd check that out.

01:44:43.660 --> 01:44:44.460
So cool.

01:44:45.660 --> 01:44:46.380
All right.

01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:47.900
Um, let's move on.

01:44:47.900 --> 01:44:49.980
And, uh, dark soccer, you have some rapid fire news too.

01:44:50.540 --> 01:44:50.940
I do.

01:44:51.740 --> 01:44:56.460
Um, so, uh, and Dan and I actually watched this and we were all kind of

01:44:56.460 --> 01:44:57.100
giddy about it.

01:44:57.900 --> 01:45:00.140
New stern pinball stranger things.

01:45:00.140 --> 01:45:01.900
Did you watch the preview?

01:45:03.340 --> 01:45:05.260
No, they had the premium version up there.

01:45:05.260 --> 01:45:05.660
Oh my God.

01:45:05.660 --> 01:45:06.700
The play field is great.

01:45:06.700 --> 01:45:09.740
It has a, like a drive-in projection screen on it.

01:45:09.740 --> 01:45:11.660
I was asked how did, do they do the upside down?

01:45:11.660 --> 01:45:13.420
Do they do like a creature from black lagoon?

01:45:13.500 --> 01:45:18.140
So you get like, there's, I think it's one of the modes, um, where the screen

01:45:18.140 --> 01:45:22.620
actually breaks apart and there's like the portal behind it that you have to

01:45:22.620 --> 01:45:28.540
shoot the, um, uh, the balls into like the, almost like the, the mouth entrance

01:45:28.540 --> 01:45:30.300
into the upside down.

01:45:31.100 --> 01:45:35.500
And then you have like the ball catch on the back wall is magnetic.

01:45:36.060 --> 01:45:37.980
It is fucking sweet.

01:45:37.980 --> 01:45:42.860
So you lock your balls on a magnetic catch on the back wall and they sit on

01:45:42.860 --> 01:45:44.060
the side of the wall.

01:45:44.060 --> 01:45:45.900
And then when multi ball starts, it releases them.

01:45:45.900 --> 01:45:50.780
I think they're showing a premium on the preview, but I mean, the animation

01:45:50.780 --> 01:45:51.740
was great.

01:45:51.740 --> 01:45:55.740
Um, you get that ramp that's used to attack the demogorgon when it goes to

01:45:55.740 --> 01:45:56.700
swallow the pinball.

01:45:57.340 --> 01:46:01.580
Um, and the, uh, the projection that goes out also animates different

01:46:01.580 --> 01:46:04.140
targets, including some pop-ups spinner.

01:46:04.700 --> 01:46:06.860
And it's just really, really involved.

01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:08.700
I really think stern is doing great.

01:46:08.700 --> 01:46:10.940
I just want to see who the designer is.

01:46:10.940 --> 01:46:13.740
Um, Bobby's actually saying in chat, my friend who I'm assuming must've

01:46:13.740 --> 01:46:16.220
worked on this is really upset because it's actually leaked.

01:46:16.220 --> 01:46:19.260
They were all under embargo and some ass hat posted the trailer on their

01:46:19.260 --> 01:46:22.300
personal YouTube channel and all the other outlets ran with it.

01:46:22.300 --> 01:46:22.620
Yeah.

01:46:22.620 --> 01:46:25.660
It's been removed from the link I have here.

01:46:25.660 --> 01:46:28.460
Once on the internet, always on the internet, at least the reception is

01:46:28.460 --> 01:46:29.340
really positive.

01:46:29.340 --> 01:46:32.220
So that's, you know, a small plus for what it's worth.

01:46:32.220 --> 01:46:35.340
Well, and the thing about is that having that little leak actually makes

01:46:35.340 --> 01:46:37.580
me way more excited.

01:46:37.580 --> 01:46:39.580
I'm really looking forward to this one.

01:46:39.580 --> 01:46:41.500
It might end up being one that we get in our house.

01:46:42.140 --> 01:46:46.780
You know, I mean, I probably would still like a black knight sort of rage

01:46:46.780 --> 01:46:50.220
just a little bit more because, you know, Steve worked really hard on it.

01:46:50.220 --> 01:46:51.740
And Steve Richie is a great guy.

01:46:52.380 --> 01:46:54.940
Um, I just want to know though, who the main designer for this was.

01:46:54.940 --> 01:46:56.060
Cause I'm not seeing anything.

01:46:56.700 --> 01:46:59.900
Um, Oh, Bobby says the friend works for a media site.

01:46:59.900 --> 01:47:04.540
He had a real preview in the works for the clicks, but it, somebody under,

01:47:04.540 --> 01:47:05.900
Oh, so it was under embargo.

01:47:05.900 --> 01:47:06.300
I get it.

01:47:06.300 --> 01:47:09.740
So somebody, somebody cut all the other, uh, press outlets off the

01:47:09.740 --> 01:47:11.420
kneecaps, basically by leaking it to YouTube.

01:47:11.420 --> 01:47:11.820
I get it.

01:47:11.820 --> 01:47:13.020
Yeah, yikes.

01:47:13.660 --> 01:47:15.900
But at any rate though, it looks amazing.

01:47:15.900 --> 01:47:20.220
It really is like, this is what pinball has come to.

01:47:20.220 --> 01:47:21.660
And I'm quite pleased with it.

01:47:22.300 --> 01:47:25.020
You know, this is pretty cool.

01:47:25.020 --> 01:47:26.140
This is honestly enough.

01:47:26.140 --> 01:47:29.740
What I think pinball 2000 should have been.

01:47:29.740 --> 01:47:34.140
I mean the video screen aspect to it was pretty cool, but I like having

01:47:34.140 --> 01:47:35.820
these more interactive elements.

01:47:36.300 --> 01:47:39.660
You know, for example, like dialed in, had its cell phone on there and

01:47:39.660 --> 01:47:45.100
everything, and you had like the, the video game, like the Tron game on,

01:47:45.100 --> 01:47:47.020
on the play field and everything.

01:47:47.020 --> 01:47:51.580
I love this interactive, um, you know, element that changes its dynamic for

01:47:51.580 --> 01:47:53.100
every gameplay is going to be different.

01:47:53.660 --> 01:47:55.820
And I'm really, really super excited about it.

01:47:55.820 --> 01:47:57.180
I think it's going to be amazing.

01:47:57.180 --> 01:47:57.680
Cool.

01:47:58.460 --> 01:47:58.960
All right.

01:47:59.420 --> 01:48:00.380
And one more, right?

01:48:00.380 --> 01:48:00.880
Yeah.

01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:06.480
So the soundtracks for Soul Blade and Soul Calibur are, um, streamable now.

01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:12.160
So it looks like that you can, I mean, get them on pretty much any

01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:18.080
service, Apple Music, Spotify, YouTube, you name it, Napster's still around

01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:18.580
shit.

01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:23.600
But you look for Namco sounds and that's the series that it's under.

01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:26.080
We had the Soul Blade soundtrack.

01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:27.280
We have this little caliber soundtrack.

01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:27.840
Come to think of it.

01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:32.080
We had them on CD, but that was like that whole Edge of Soul long version

01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:33.520
was so amazing.

01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:34.240
It was so good.

01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:37.600
But yeah, um, go get them.

01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:38.100
They're free.

01:48:38.720 --> 01:48:40.800
Well, free with your rental of the service.

01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:45.200
So, um, I think like if you, if you had like Soul Calibur 2, like Brave Edge,

01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:48.320
Braver Soul, I think is the name of it shows up in a lot of other Namco games

01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:51.200
like music, it was a Tyco, Nutatrician song and all that good stuff.

01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:51.700
Yeah.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
And that series always had an Epic soundtrack to it.

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:57.520
So, uh, now you can have Epic music for when you're driving down the freeway.

01:48:57.600 --> 01:49:01.040
Don't get me driving with Edge of Soul playing because I will speed.

01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:01.540
All right.

01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:05.840
Uh, last chance to, uh, if you're participating live, uh, Twitch is your

01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:08.320
last chance to contribute to the community gift chest.

01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:11.360
Uh, I'm going to ask Bobby to hit the button after we're done with release

01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:13.040
dates to make it rain.

01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:16.880
So that'll be, uh, after we, um, do this in a minute there.

01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:20.960
So, um, all right, let's move on to release dates.

01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:22.640
And I think this will be a quick segment here.

01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:27.280
So, uh, Loki, you don't say, uh, so this week we only have one game coming

01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:32.960
out and it's brain age, Nintendo switch training in the U S on in the U S.

01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:36.400
I didn't know they ever confirmed that that was even happening in the U S.

01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:38.480
Apparently it is.

01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:38.800
Sorry.

01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:40.000
I just got excited for a minute.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:41.280
There was brain age games were fun.

01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:42.400
They were silly, but they were fun.

01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:43.600
Wow.

01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:44.240
Okay, cool.

01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:46.160
I didn't know what was happening here.

01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:46.660
That's great.

01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:47.520
All right.

01:49:47.520 --> 01:49:51.120
Well, let's, let's travel to Japan and check out what else is coming out there.

01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:54.560
So, um, there are a few more releases in Japan cause it's a little, little

01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:56.400
different, uh, the way the holidays work.

01:49:56.400 --> 01:50:02.000
So, uh, on, uh, we get the brain training in Japan as well on December 27th.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.400
That is the thing that's happening on December 25th.

01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:06.880
You can check out at layer dusk trilogy, deluxe packs.

01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:09.280
Maybe it's only gonna be like digital over here or something like that.

01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:10.240
Yeah, maybe that's the deal.

01:50:10.240 --> 01:50:11.040
I don't know.

01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:14.080
So anyway, but those are, those are the big releases on the switch this week.

01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:17.120
And then if we look at the PlayStation four, uh, on the PlayStation four,

01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:21.040
those at layer games, uh, and the trilogy pack that is also happening in Japan

01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:21.680
this week.

01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:22.880
So it is a slower week.

01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:25.600
I mean, they still, they still, they have Christmas in Japan.

01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:29.840
It's just not quite like the, the whole entire world stops.

01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:31.920
Like it does here in Japan, right?

01:50:31.920 --> 01:50:33.760
It's more of, it's, it's a cake celebration, right?

01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:34.560
There's a Christmas cake.

01:50:35.280 --> 01:50:35.520
Yeah.

01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:38.000
Like a strawberry white cake.

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:38.400
Yes.

01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:39.200
It looks delicious.

01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:40.160
I'd love to have a Christmas cake.

01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:41.200
Anyhow.

01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:43.040
Um, how about the UK dark soccer?

01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:45.280
No, like seriously?

01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:47.200
No, nothing coming out in the UK.

01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:51.920
No, nothing on there until January 2nd, which is brain training.

01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:58.400
Uh, and Akuma JP is actually in chat saying, uh, yes, no holiday.

01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:02.560
And then G GTR says it's kind of big in Japan, especially with KFC.

01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:04.720
So I wonder if it's one of those things where like,

01:51:04.720 --> 01:51:07.600
they're just playing into the rest of the world.

01:51:07.600 --> 01:51:07.840
Yeah.

01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:09.440
It's like a marketing type of thing.

01:51:09.440 --> 01:51:13.920
Kind of like, I'm trying to think of an equivalent that we do in the Cinco de Mayo.

01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:16.480
Right.

01:51:16.480 --> 01:51:18.160
But KFC is a thing.

01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:18.960
Yeah, no, I know.

01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:19.840
And Christmas cake.

01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:20.240
I know.

01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:21.280
That's what we should do.

01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:23.920
Let's have KFC Christmas.

01:51:23.920 --> 01:51:24.560
On Christmas.

01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:25.840
Is that even open?

01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:30.560
We'll get, well, you know what I would prefer though to KFC would be Jollibee.

01:51:31.520 --> 01:51:32.640
Jollibee is fucking amazing.

01:51:32.640 --> 01:51:33.840
Isn't there a Jollibee in Elk Grove?

01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:34.240
Yeah.

01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:35.120
Um, South sack.

01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:36.000
You have to see if it's open.

01:51:36.720 --> 01:51:40.080
I used to, when I would have to go to the doctor, I would actually go pick up my lunch

01:51:40.080 --> 01:51:41.840
from Jollibee and go to work with it.

01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:42.080
Okay.

01:51:42.080 --> 01:51:47.440
So I would have to say the, uh, the only equivalent I can think of that would be Cinco de Mayo.

01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:50.960
It's not a holiday at all here, but we completely appropriate it

01:51:51.920 --> 01:51:52.960
and fuck it up and fuck it up.

01:51:52.960 --> 01:51:58.880
And it's just, it becomes tequila holiday and all this, you know, that's, that's

01:51:58.880 --> 01:51:59.920
to quote the meme.

01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:04.320
Do you ever go what the fuck white people, even though you are white people?

01:52:04.320 --> 01:52:04.880
Oh, you know what?

01:52:04.880 --> 01:52:06.080
Act F just mentioned this too.

01:52:06.080 --> 01:52:09.680
It's Cinco de Mayo is like, not even that big a holiday in Mexico either.

01:52:09.680 --> 01:52:11.920
Well, honestly, it's like Hanukkah.

01:52:11.920 --> 01:52:13.440
Hanukkah is not a fucking big holiday.

01:52:13.440 --> 01:52:14.960
It's not even in Torah.

01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:15.600
No, you're right.

01:52:15.600 --> 01:52:15.920
You're right.

01:52:15.920 --> 01:52:17.040
That's a good example.

01:52:17.200 --> 01:52:26.640
An apocryphal tale in the tale of the Maccabees, but it's culturally significant because it

01:52:26.640 --> 01:52:29.280
had to do with reclaiming the temple from Rome.

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:30.960
So just saying.

01:52:30.960 --> 01:52:32.720
Well, and it's also, I mean, let's be real.

01:52:32.720 --> 01:52:35.600
It's also so that the Jewish kids don't feel left out on Christmas.

01:52:35.600 --> 01:52:37.920
That's a big part of made a big deal because of that.

01:52:37.920 --> 01:52:38.480
Yeah.

01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:38.720
Yeah.

01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:42.800
I don't know if that game's coming out in the U S now because I even looked on, it made

01:52:42.800 --> 01:52:43.440
me curious.

01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:47.200
I checked on Nintendo site and they only even listed as a title coming out.

01:52:47.200 --> 01:52:47.360
Okay.

01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:51.600
So maybe somehow because it's, it's snuck onto that list because it's coming down the

01:52:51.600 --> 01:52:54.160
UK though on the 3rd of January.

01:52:54.160 --> 01:52:54.560
Huh?

01:52:54.560 --> 01:52:55.040
Interesting.

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:56.500
All right.

01:52:57.280 --> 01:52:57.760
Okay.

01:52:57.760 --> 01:52:59.680
Well, uh, that's it for release dates.

01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:01.520
So, uh, Bobby, make it rain, please.

01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:04.480
When you hear this message and we'll give out those gifts in the community gift chest.

01:53:04.480 --> 01:53:08.800
So enjoy for those illegal legends players, I'm sure, uh, you guys will appreciate that.

01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:09.200
Okay.

01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:11.200
So let's go to the mailbag every week.

01:53:11.200 --> 01:53:15.280
You guys send us emails, participate at orange lounge trader.com is the place to send us

01:53:15.280 --> 01:53:15.840
emails.

01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:17.360
And I think we have one or two tonight.

01:53:18.720 --> 01:53:23.040
One, which I'm trying to get back to you because I'm now explaining Hanukkah to people.

01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:31.200
Um, so, uh, we have one from Martin from Belgium, who we haven't heard from for a long time.

01:53:31.840 --> 01:53:35.360
Um, hello, Martin from Belgium, Belgium here.

01:53:35.360 --> 01:53:39.600
I just wanted to wish you all a happy belated 800th birthday.

01:53:40.240 --> 01:53:40.720
Thank you.

01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:44.320
I have to say, I really appreciate you guys always being there on the podcast to cheer

01:53:44.320 --> 01:53:45.520
up my Monday mornings.

01:53:45.520 --> 01:53:49.200
Listening to the podcast was like comfort food for my ears, especially when I'm having

01:53:49.200 --> 01:53:50.240
a bad day.

01:53:50.240 --> 01:53:51.040
Thank you so much.

01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:52.400
And keep up the great work.

01:53:52.400 --> 01:53:53.920
Martin from Belgium.

01:53:53.920 --> 01:53:55.040
I like seeing his name.

01:53:55.040 --> 01:53:56.160
That's no question.

01:53:56.160 --> 01:53:58.640
No, no, just, just, just feel love.

01:53:58.640 --> 01:53:59.120
Thank you.

01:53:59.920 --> 01:54:02.160
Well, that is a, that is a holiday gift in itself.

01:54:02.160 --> 01:54:02.800
Thank you so much.

01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:04.320
And that's it.

01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:05.120
No more emails.

01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:05.520
Wow.

01:54:05.520 --> 01:54:06.000
All right.

01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:08.400
Are you going to have some of his that's nuts?

01:54:08.400 --> 01:54:10.240
I was going to have some of his that's nuts.

01:54:10.240 --> 01:54:10.480
Yeah.

01:54:10.480 --> 01:54:10.960
They're good.

01:54:10.960 --> 01:54:11.920
They're delicious nuts.

01:54:11.920 --> 01:54:12.720
All right.

01:54:12.720 --> 01:54:18.240
Anyway, uh, for those in the podcast, he's actually got the little bag of, uh, they're,

01:54:18.240 --> 01:54:20.080
they're candy pecans in reality, right?

01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:20.880
They're praline pecans.

01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:21.280
Or excuse you.

01:54:21.280 --> 01:54:22.080
Yeah, pralines.

01:54:22.080 --> 01:54:22.720
It's the time.

01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:26.480
It's basically, it's like a pie without the crust is really what it and the gooeyness.

01:54:26.480 --> 01:54:27.520
Yeah, exactly.

01:54:27.520 --> 01:54:29.840
I am still working on my latkes by the way.

01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:30.160
Yeah.

01:54:30.160 --> 01:54:33.120
That's how long it takes me to eat anything now is good stuff.

01:54:33.120 --> 01:54:35.440
Anyway, I feel so fat.

01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:36.240
All right, let's move on.

01:54:36.240 --> 01:54:39.360
We got some more news to get to, and then we'll see if anyone wants to call in via our

01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:43.040
discord server over at vognetwork.com slash discord.

01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:45.280
So whoops, I've been slacking off on the sidebar there.

01:54:45.280 --> 01:54:46.800
So we're done with release dates.

01:54:46.800 --> 01:54:47.840
We're done with the mailbag.

01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:49.200
Let's get to the next story.

01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:49.680
Loki.

01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:50.640
All right.

01:54:51.440 --> 01:54:56.240
This is a pretty cool, like unnecessary update, but it's something that was added to No Man's

01:54:56.240 --> 01:55:03.760
Sky and it's these little music synthesizers that you can actually put your own music in.

01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:10.240
So basically it allows you to kind of, um, make different musical tracks.

01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:12.560
The hell are you doing over there?

01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:13.440
I'm hoarding the nuts.

01:55:14.400 --> 01:55:15.520
Fondling the nuts over there.

01:55:16.480 --> 01:55:25.200
Um, so you can actually kind of, um, actually put out your own set of, um, chords and stuff

01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:27.200
in there to be able to make your own tracks.

01:55:27.200 --> 01:55:30.720
And then you can link several of them together to actually make music.

01:55:30.720 --> 01:55:33.280
So Pete, that's what people have been doing is making music with them.

01:55:33.280 --> 01:55:38.560
And then on top of that, you can also wire them to different lights and effects to kind

01:55:38.560 --> 01:55:40.160
of synchronize everything.

01:55:40.160 --> 01:55:46.480
And so of course people have used it to like make all sorts of, um, you know, cool music

01:55:46.480 --> 01:55:46.960
things.

01:55:46.960 --> 01:55:53.520
They've also done like little like dance club type stuff in there, but it's pretty sweet

01:55:53.520 --> 01:55:54.800
and free.

01:55:55.440 --> 01:55:56.880
Can't complain with free.

01:55:56.880 --> 01:56:00.560
So it'd be interesting how creative people get with this.

01:56:00.560 --> 01:56:02.560
My how far this game has come.

01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:03.120
Yeah.

01:56:03.120 --> 01:56:08.720
I mean, talk about a story of the decade of sorts, you know, just the, this game coming

01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:11.280
out and it's just the whipping boy, the entire community.

01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:16.080
And now the place that it's at is just, you know, this big supreme creative outlet.

01:56:16.080 --> 01:56:17.280
It's so interesting.

01:56:17.280 --> 01:56:19.600
So I need to get back in.

01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:23.040
I keep seeing it in my steam library, taunting me, like, come play this.

01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:23.360
Oh yeah.

01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:25.360
I bought that on steam too.

01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:26.000
Get in on that.

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:27.280
Cause I forgot all about it.

01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:29.680
Alan was playing it hella for a little bit too.

01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:32.800
And, um, the two of us have our little bases on a planet somewhere.

01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:35.760
So, um, come find us in the universe.

01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:36.400
We're somewhere.

01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:37.360
All right.

01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:39.200
Oh yeah.

01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:40.640
I forgot about that too.

01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:40.880
Hmm.

01:56:41.600 --> 01:56:42.160
Oh wow.

01:56:42.160 --> 01:56:45.920
All these games that like, Hey, you bought this back here and you haven't really played

01:56:45.920 --> 01:56:47.920
it like mosh pit simulator.

01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:49.040
Totally forgot about that.

01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:50.720
Oh, how steam tells you about all the games.

01:56:50.720 --> 01:56:51.440
DuckTales or Mastered.

01:56:51.440 --> 01:56:53.840
Don't remember buying that, but I have it.

01:56:54.640 --> 01:56:55.760
There's no man's sky.

01:56:56.880 --> 01:56:57.360
There you go.

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:02.400
Well, a game that I know you've been a little better about playing is Pokemon go.

01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:05.840
And, uh, we have some information about things that have updated in Pokemon go.

01:57:05.840 --> 01:57:10.560
So if you haven't played that in a little while, you might've missed a few things.

01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:15.520
Uh, the big holiday edition that they put into the game was expanding the buddy adventure.

01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:19.760
So now you no longer just walk your buddy for candy.

01:57:19.760 --> 01:57:24.960
Your buddy plays a role basically with you and you can actually, uh, feed them berries.

01:57:25.200 --> 01:57:26.080
And it'll grow.

01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:27.280
They'll get hearts from that.

01:57:27.920 --> 01:57:30.960
And you increase your friendship level with the buddy Pokemon.

01:57:30.960 --> 01:57:33.760
And as you increase that level, you get certain perks.

01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:37.920
For example, the Pokemon may try to help you catch Pokemon in the wild.

01:57:37.920 --> 01:57:41.200
Uh, your buddy Pokemon will also increase its CP.

01:57:41.840 --> 01:57:45.120
So, but you have to get, you have to get a really, you have to get a four star buddy

01:57:45.120 --> 01:57:49.440
for that to actually happen for you to actually get an increased in the amount that they battle.

01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:50.720
But you can do all sorts of things.

01:57:50.720 --> 01:57:53.840
You can take the buddy into AR mode and you play with it by like,

01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:56.240
by just like doing like scratching under its chin or whatever.

01:57:56.240 --> 01:57:58.480
And it will be happy and reward you with hearts.

01:57:58.480 --> 01:58:00.960
Uh, and it'll follow you around on the map too, which is really cool.

01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:04.480
So it's kind of a throwback to, um, when Pikachu would follow you around.

01:58:04.480 --> 01:58:10.000
But have a really shitty buddy right now that I was walking with just to get some more candies.

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:10.240
Yeah.

01:58:10.240 --> 01:58:14.960
That's the only bummer is that now I'm not walking stuff to get candy to evolve anymore.

01:58:14.960 --> 01:58:18.560
Now I'm like, Oh, I want to walk my a hundred percent Tyranitar.

01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:21.760
So when I need to sub them in, he'll have that increased CP.

01:58:22.720 --> 01:58:24.240
That's that's what I'm doing now.

01:58:24.240 --> 01:58:26.160
So, um, yeah, that's kind of a fun thing.

01:58:26.160 --> 01:58:27.840
But then what I think is also really cool.

01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:30.160
And this just came out within the past couple days.

01:58:30.800 --> 01:58:34.400
Now they have a, um, this whole thing, this AR kit.

01:58:34.400 --> 01:58:39.360
And I haven't been able to play with this yet, but apparently now you can take pictures

01:58:39.360 --> 01:58:45.680
of your buddy and your buddy's buddy at the same time in the same space.

01:58:45.680 --> 01:58:49.520
So it's like AR plus where now, so I guess, you know, when you're starting to see some of this

01:58:49.520 --> 01:58:52.880
in your Minecraft earth as you're playing it, is that the things you're doing can affect other

01:58:52.880 --> 01:58:53.520
people too.

01:58:53.520 --> 01:58:56.720
So now Pokemon go is doing that a little bit with the Pokemon.

01:58:56.720 --> 01:58:58.560
So that's really cool.

01:58:58.560 --> 01:58:59.680
So yeah.

01:58:59.680 --> 01:59:03.520
And there's a whole little trailer and that shows off the buddy adventures.

01:59:03.520 --> 01:59:07.920
And it honestly makes the world look like detective Pikachu where everybody has it because

01:59:07.920 --> 01:59:08.160
right.

01:59:08.160 --> 01:59:11.280
And detective Pikachu, like everybody has a buddy Pokemon, right?

01:59:11.280 --> 01:59:17.200
So, um, if you could pick any Pokemon as your buddy, Pokemon IRL, who would your buddy

01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:17.760
Pokemon be?

01:59:18.640 --> 01:59:19.200
I don't know.

01:59:19.760 --> 01:59:20.720
Espeon.

01:59:20.720 --> 01:59:21.280
Espeon.

01:59:21.280 --> 01:59:21.840
Oh, good pick.

01:59:21.840 --> 01:59:22.080
Why?

01:59:22.800 --> 01:59:23.760
Because it's pretty.

01:59:24.400 --> 01:59:28.320
Although I do like Makuhita who I would just like take a nap on.

01:59:29.600 --> 01:59:30.560
So yeah, Espeon.

01:59:31.200 --> 01:59:34.400
Um, honestly it's hard to not say Jigglypuff.

01:59:34.400 --> 01:59:38.640
Like I just, I, I relate with Jigglypuff on a, on a scale.

01:59:38.640 --> 01:59:40.560
So I think Jigglypuff would be mine.

01:59:41.280 --> 01:59:43.280
I'm looking in com, uh, chat for some comments.

01:59:43.280 --> 01:59:45.120
VGRealness says Butterfree.

01:59:45.120 --> 01:59:46.960
ActDeaf says Vulpix.

01:59:46.960 --> 01:59:51.840
Akuma says Kabigon, which I don't know which one that translates to in the US.

01:59:53.040 --> 01:59:54.960
Bonds006 says Geodude.

01:59:56.800 --> 01:59:59.360
Bobby Blackwolf says, I'm still walking a Magikarp.

01:59:59.360 --> 02:00:02.320
Hey Mag, I've seen people use Magikarp as their buddy.

02:00:02.320 --> 02:00:07.680
You know, increase that friendship level and then evolve it into a, um, uh, not a super

02:00:07.680 --> 02:00:08.320
Magikarp.

02:00:08.320 --> 02:00:09.360
Kabigon is Snorlax.

02:00:09.360 --> 02:00:10.080
Gyarados.

02:00:10.080 --> 02:00:10.960
Thank you, Gyarados.

02:00:10.960 --> 02:00:11.920
Why can't I remember?

02:00:11.920 --> 02:00:14.560
Kabigon is, uh, Snorlax.

02:00:14.560 --> 02:00:16.160
Snorlax is super cute too.

02:00:16.960 --> 02:00:20.800
I have a hundred percent Snorlax and that'll probably be the one I do after, um, my Tyranitar.

02:00:20.800 --> 02:00:23.760
Did you see that big Snorlax, uh, beanbag bed?

02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:24.480
Yes.

02:00:24.480 --> 02:00:24.800
Want.

02:00:25.680 --> 02:00:26.240
So cute.

02:00:27.360 --> 02:00:27.760
All right.

02:00:29.280 --> 02:00:31.120
Anyhow, those are some updates in Pokemon Go.

02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:32.640
Dark Sakura.

02:00:33.440 --> 02:00:36.560
This, this game just keeps delivering week after week.

02:00:36.560 --> 02:00:36.960
Literally.

02:00:36.960 --> 02:00:38.320
It keeps on giving.

02:00:38.320 --> 02:00:40.000
We just talked about this last week.

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:40.480
We did.

02:00:40.480 --> 02:00:43.680
So that's why I wanted to bring it up again, but more.

02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:53.600
So, um, Lance McDonald, modern extreme, has finally gotten us out of the endless hallway

02:00:53.600 --> 02:00:57.440
of PT and took us onto the streets of Silent Hill.

02:00:58.480 --> 02:01:04.880
So, um, which, I mean, he's the same one who brought up the stuff that you talked about

02:01:04.880 --> 02:01:11.040
last week about Lisa following you and that you are playing as Norman Reedus as a character,

02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:16.240
you know, but to do what he did, there were a few discoveries in there.

02:01:16.240 --> 02:01:18.160
I've watched the video a couple of times last night.

02:01:18.160 --> 02:01:21.440
There's some really just cool stuff going on with it.

02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:30.000
So what happens is, um, the, the, the, the hallway and the, the town exists on two different

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:35.760
maps and your link is going to be from that main little room that you start off with.

02:01:35.760 --> 02:01:44.320
So what he did was rekey that intro room, that, that basement room to, um, let you out onto

02:01:44.320 --> 02:01:45.200
the streets.

02:01:45.200 --> 02:01:48.640
Now the first discovery is that the floor has no collision detection.

02:01:48.640 --> 02:01:51.040
You fall right through it, but guess what happens?

02:01:51.040 --> 02:01:52.320
Lisa comes and eats you.

02:01:53.040 --> 02:01:55.280
Like what happens if she catches you in the house.

02:01:55.840 --> 02:02:00.240
So it's, I guess to prevent you from like, if you inadvertently ended up on the map by

02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:04.800
some glitch, you know, other than doing it on purpose, then it's to prevent your game

02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:06.160
from soft locking or whatever.

02:02:06.960 --> 02:02:12.800
So, um, the other, so what he did is he programmed in like a float so that your character floats

02:02:12.800 --> 02:02:13.680
above the ground.

02:02:13.680 --> 02:02:19.920
So you go out and on the street and it's just really exploring just how highly detailed

02:02:19.920 --> 02:02:20.640
these streets are.

02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:26.000
Like you do get like behind a van and some of the cars are textured as well, but like

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:31.680
he floated up to the balcony and showed a full street scene and it was just really intense.

02:02:31.680 --> 02:02:36.720
I mean, and it's a good, like three blocks of distance that's rendered.

02:02:36.720 --> 02:02:37.120
Yeah.

02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:41.360
And your final barrier is like literally a fence at the end of it.

02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:45.120
Although it looks like you can go around the fence, but it's a full, it's a full game

02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:45.520
barrier.

02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:50.000
But, um, it's, it's also interesting because it points out that that trailer you essentially

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:53.120
see at the end of the game is being rendered in re in the game engine.

02:02:53.120 --> 02:02:54.720
It's not like a cut scene or something.

02:02:54.720 --> 02:02:59.040
And on top of that, you have that blood trail right at the beginning of it.

02:02:59.040 --> 02:03:02.160
It has, um, a lot of clutter in the environment.

02:03:02.160 --> 02:03:03.600
So it's like all these props.

02:03:04.240 --> 02:03:11.360
It made me think that this was actually part of what was actually started to be rendered

02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:12.560
for Silent Hills for sure.

02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:15.760
And Bobby in chat says they were probably building that out for the full game.

02:03:15.760 --> 02:03:16.260
Absolutely.

02:03:17.140 --> 02:03:23.460
Uh, it's definitely worth everyone finding that, that trailer and watching it, but it

02:03:23.460 --> 02:03:25.380
was found by Lance McDonald.

02:03:25.380 --> 02:03:29.300
The, um, uh, handle on Twitter is man fight dragon.

02:03:30.500 --> 02:03:37.460
And, um, one of the things is that someone asked him how many jumpscares did Lisa get

02:03:37.460 --> 02:03:39.060
with you for the making of this video?

02:03:39.620 --> 02:03:42.020
And his response was she does the jump scare.

02:03:42.020 --> 02:03:45.860
Anytime you mess with the player location without applying a special fix to make the

02:03:45.860 --> 02:03:47.460
game think you're on the ground.

02:03:47.460 --> 02:03:48.180
It's hard to predict.

02:03:48.180 --> 02:03:51.780
And I screamed multiple times while getting a few of the overhead camera shots for the

02:03:51.780 --> 02:03:52.280
video.

02:03:53.220 --> 02:03:57.300
That's interesting that they kind of built in the Lisa thing, like just in case someone

02:03:57.300 --> 02:04:00.500
got out, but somebody kind of found a work around that.

02:04:00.500 --> 02:04:01.540
That's really neat.

02:04:01.540 --> 02:04:01.780
Yeah.

02:04:01.780 --> 02:04:04.180
It's still freaking creeps me out though, man.

02:04:04.180 --> 02:04:06.900
And everybody still wonders like, where is this game?

02:04:06.900 --> 02:04:09.860
We never did get to see, you know, it's just, it's sad.

02:04:09.860 --> 02:04:11.780
Well, it's on made, it's on made.

02:04:11.780 --> 02:04:12.660
So it's sad.

02:04:13.460 --> 02:04:20.020
What I would like to see is that instead of having, cause I think that the, um, I don't

02:04:20.020 --> 02:04:24.580
know if people are actually able to pull legit assets for it, for the Mac and PC, you know,

02:04:24.580 --> 02:04:31.140
simulations of PT that they did, but I would like for people to pull more of these resources

02:04:31.140 --> 02:04:33.060
and actually like make something with it.

02:04:33.060 --> 02:04:33.860
It would be nice.

02:04:33.860 --> 02:04:39.620
You know, I, this is what could have been, and my hope is that whatever this horror thing

02:04:39.620 --> 02:04:44.420
that Kojima has in mind, that it's going to be a true spiritual successor to the silent

02:04:44.420 --> 02:04:46.180
Hill franchise called Konami will Sue.

02:04:47.380 --> 02:04:50.100
Well, I mean, and I talked about this already on the show, so I don't want to repeat myself

02:04:50.100 --> 02:04:55.460
too much, but I just want it to be true that Konami is just gonna realize that there's

02:04:55.460 --> 02:04:59.300
more money to be had by just letting somebody else borrow the IP and make a good game with

02:04:59.300 --> 02:05:01.300
it and just trying to mend the fences and make it happen.

02:05:01.300 --> 02:05:03.620
But I'm not going to hold my breath either.

02:05:03.620 --> 02:05:05.940
There is, there's a lot more drama.

02:05:05.940 --> 02:05:13.780
If you go watch the theories behind representation in PT, there's a lot that correlates to Kojima's

02:05:13.780 --> 02:05:19.700
experience there and him trying to leave clues to bypass his NDA without doing it.

02:05:20.260 --> 02:05:24.340
And I mean, it is a little bit conspiracy theorist, you know, talk, but a lot of it

02:05:24.340 --> 02:05:27.940
does make sense, especially with what we know now after the fact.

02:05:27.940 --> 02:05:33.860
And the whole thing with Konami is that he was the only, I think, person on their board

02:05:33.860 --> 02:05:39.540
that wasn't like one of the like original or in the family or something about it.

02:05:39.540 --> 02:05:43.860
So he was always seen as an outsider amongst the powers that be at Konami.

02:05:43.860 --> 02:05:52.100
So definitely, if I can find that thing, the little video that I found before, I will try

02:05:52.100 --> 02:05:54.660
to post it up on my Twitter at Dark Sakura.

02:05:54.660 --> 02:05:55.160
Cool.

02:05:55.860 --> 02:05:56.420
All right.

02:05:56.420 --> 02:05:58.820
Well, just a few more stories for you guys before we get to Discord.

02:05:58.820 --> 02:05:59.320
Loki.

02:06:00.100 --> 02:06:00.600
All right.

02:06:01.480 --> 02:06:07.160
So we were talking about Stadia a little bit ago and how there's not really a whole ton

02:06:07.160 --> 02:06:08.760
of things coming out on Stadia.

02:06:09.320 --> 02:06:11.800
Well, they're hoping to change that.

02:06:11.800 --> 02:06:19.000
So now Google is actually planning on beefing up their library by purchasing some studios.

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:24.760
So they've done this with Typhoon Studios and Typhoon Studios, of course, is an indie

02:06:24.760 --> 02:06:30.760
studio that's created by some veterans from other games that you might know, including

02:06:30.760 --> 02:06:34.120
Batman Arkham City, Far Cry 4 and the such.

02:06:34.760 --> 02:06:40.920
They're planning on releasing their first game, Journey to the Savage Planet, and they're

02:06:40.920 --> 02:06:47.240
going to be joining existing Stadia games and entertainment studio in Montreal.

02:06:47.800 --> 02:06:53.400
So no word on what exactly they're going to be developing, but it is going to be some

02:06:53.400 --> 02:06:54.040
new games.

02:06:55.560 --> 02:06:58.840
Which is good because right now we only know one kind of exclusive game and don't really

02:06:58.840 --> 02:07:01.560
know much about it and don't know when the hell it's coming up.

02:07:02.280 --> 02:07:06.520
VG Realness in our chat saying my question to Google and Stadia, why did they not have

02:07:06.520 --> 02:07:07.880
these studios planned out already?

02:07:07.880 --> 02:07:09.080
Seems like an afterthought.

02:07:10.520 --> 02:07:15.640
Yeah, unless Google is committing to the long game here with this, which we still don't

02:07:15.640 --> 02:07:16.760
know if we can trust them to do that.

02:07:16.760 --> 02:07:20.280
They were hoping for more third party support and just didn't get it.

02:07:20.280 --> 02:07:21.560
So now they got to go buy their own?

02:07:22.200 --> 02:07:22.700
Maybe.

02:07:22.700 --> 02:07:23.200
Maybe.

02:07:23.560 --> 02:07:24.440
That could be a part of it.

02:07:25.480 --> 02:07:29.800
And yeah, I mean, you saw Microsoft making these moves a couple of years ago, and now

02:07:29.800 --> 02:07:32.120
we're going to see that payoff next year.

02:07:32.120 --> 02:07:33.400
Hopefully, fingers crossed.

02:07:33.400 --> 02:07:38.040
I mean, I'm expecting big things for Microsoft for E3, so we'll see what happens with that.

02:07:38.040 --> 02:07:41.160
So do you think they might bring Scalebound back?

02:07:42.200 --> 02:07:44.920
That rumor always shows its face in one way or another.

02:07:44.920 --> 02:07:45.420
All right.

02:07:46.600 --> 02:07:47.100
All right.

02:07:47.880 --> 02:07:51.560
One more story for you guys, and it's about yet another TV service.

02:07:51.560 --> 02:07:53.160
Oh, this is one that I don't have.

02:07:53.160 --> 02:07:58.120
We were trying to talk about, because Dark Soccer wanted to borrow my CBS for reasons.

02:07:58.120 --> 02:08:00.360
And she's like, well, do you have Netflix?

02:08:00.360 --> 02:08:01.000
Yep, I have Netflix.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:01.480
Do you have Hulu?

02:08:01.480 --> 02:08:03.960
Yep, I have Hulu, because Alan gets the Hulu.

02:08:03.960 --> 02:08:08.200
And so I feel like nobody has CBS.

02:08:08.200 --> 02:08:13.480
I have the CBS because I got it for Star Trek and maybe to watch Trashy Big Brother.

02:08:13.480 --> 02:08:17.160
At least, it was really bad this last year.

02:08:17.160 --> 02:08:20.760
I didn't watch it this last year, but it's also how I catch up on Survivor sometimes.

02:08:20.760 --> 02:08:27.160
But anyway, Apple TV, one of the other services out there, I haven't heard a lot about except

02:08:27.160 --> 02:08:30.520
for apparently that newsroom show that they have is apparently really good, a lot of people

02:08:30.520 --> 02:08:31.480
talking about it.

02:08:31.480 --> 02:08:32.680
And they're going to be having another show.

02:08:32.680 --> 02:08:33.640
What's that have to do with video games?

02:08:33.640 --> 02:08:37.160
Because they're going to be having another show coming out on February 7th, and it is

02:08:37.160 --> 02:08:38.440
a video game spoof show.

02:08:38.440 --> 02:08:43.480
It's called Mythic Quest, not Mystic Quest, but Mythic Quest Ravens Banquet.

02:08:44.200 --> 02:08:47.880
And there's going to be nine episodes that will be released on February 7th.

02:08:47.880 --> 02:08:50.760
And what I think is kind of interesting about it, you know, you might be kind of rolling

02:08:50.760 --> 02:08:52.760
your eyes like, oh, God, video game parody.

02:08:52.760 --> 02:08:59.480
But the creators of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Rob McElhenny and Charlie Day.

02:08:59.480 --> 02:09:00.520
We've heard about this already.

02:09:00.520 --> 02:09:01.160
I think so.

02:09:01.160 --> 02:09:03.400
But now we're getting something that is coming out February 7th.

02:09:03.400 --> 02:09:04.520
We know that it's coming out.

02:09:04.520 --> 02:09:07.880
And I don't think we knew it was Apple TV before.

02:09:07.880 --> 02:09:08.200
Maybe we did.

02:09:08.200 --> 02:09:08.680
Yes, we did.

02:09:08.680 --> 02:09:09.400
Did we?

02:09:09.400 --> 02:09:14.760
OK, well, so there's that because It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia is one of those shows

02:09:14.760 --> 02:09:19.480
that's kind of like I'm laughing so hard at this, even though it's like kind of terrible,

02:09:19.480 --> 02:09:21.720
but like in a really funny way.

02:09:21.720 --> 02:09:26.520
So I know I hope it's like I hope I hope it's funny like that, but we'll see.

02:09:27.480 --> 02:09:31.080
Also, some of the people that are in this, this is what's also kind of weird about this.

02:09:31.080 --> 02:09:33.560
Some of the people that are involved with it, I want to say, yeah.

02:09:35.480 --> 02:09:39.960
David Hornsby is in this from from Philadelphia, the movie.

02:09:40.840 --> 02:09:44.520
I don't remember what part that was, but also in the show, F.

02:09:44.520 --> 02:09:50.120
Murray Abraham is in this show like every Abraham's got to be in his 70s.

02:09:50.120 --> 02:09:52.120
He was in like Amadeus, right?

02:09:53.800 --> 02:09:55.160
So I don't it's it's anyway.

02:09:55.160 --> 02:09:59.080
Yeah, because this was something that was part of that Ubisoft motion pictures company thing.

02:09:59.080 --> 02:09:59.400
Yeah.

02:09:59.400 --> 02:10:04.520
So they talked about it during their their E3 press conference and video game actress

02:10:04.520 --> 02:10:09.480
Ashley Birch from Horizon Zero Dawn and Life is Strange is also going to be involved with this.

02:10:09.480 --> 02:10:11.240
So that'll be interesting.

02:10:12.120 --> 02:10:14.120
Oh, it was an E3 announcement.

02:10:14.120 --> 02:10:17.240
Azette is asking, is this a The Guild rip off?

02:10:18.280 --> 02:10:18.920
I don't know.

02:10:18.920 --> 02:10:20.520
I don't think so.

02:10:20.520 --> 02:10:22.360
I've never watched The Guild, so I don't know.

02:10:22.360 --> 02:10:24.200
I've seen some of The Guild. It was cute.

02:10:24.200 --> 02:10:27.240
I saw the earlier episodes kind of like before it was everywhere.

02:10:27.240 --> 02:10:29.720
I mean, not to sound hipster about it, but that's the reality.

02:10:29.720 --> 02:10:32.360
I saw it when you could download the episodes on Xbox 360.

02:10:32.360 --> 02:10:34.840
That's when I saw I was watching it on YouTube.

02:10:35.800 --> 02:10:36.920
So back in the day.

02:10:37.800 --> 02:10:38.600
All right.

02:10:38.600 --> 02:10:41.240
So there it is, the news for tonight.

02:10:41.240 --> 02:10:45.400
So if you want to give us a call, you can join our discord over at

02:10:45.400 --> 02:10:49.880
vognetwork.com slash discord in the green room.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:52.440
Or you can just ask a question.

02:10:52.440 --> 02:10:55.880
If you have a general question you'd like to put out in chat, you can do that.

02:10:56.840 --> 02:10:59.320
Otherwise, we'll talk amongst ourselves for a little bit.

02:10:59.320 --> 02:11:02.600
I'm going to ask if there's any last minute stories, although I know we're looking,

02:11:02.600 --> 02:11:05.000
but we're scraping the barrel as it is this week.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:06.680
So there is that.

02:11:06.680 --> 02:11:08.760
Oh, here's a clickbait rumor.

02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:09.400
Oh no.

02:11:09.400 --> 02:11:10.120
All right.

02:11:10.120 --> 02:11:10.760
Fine.

02:11:10.760 --> 02:11:11.320
Fine.

02:11:11.320 --> 02:11:13.320
No calls in queue means rumors.

02:11:13.320 --> 02:11:14.280
Let's do them.

02:11:14.280 --> 02:11:17.560
There's a rumor that Sumo digital's working on crackdown four.

02:11:18.920 --> 02:11:19.800
Interesting.

02:11:19.800 --> 02:11:24.360
When crackdown three seems like it wasn't well received at the end of the day.

02:11:24.360 --> 02:11:29.080
So you know, what's funny speaking of games that weren't well received.

02:11:29.080 --> 02:11:33.880
I thought of you Loki today because I saw I was going through the PlayStation store

02:11:33.880 --> 02:11:36.680
and I saw agents of mayhem for sale for $4.

02:11:37.800 --> 02:11:39.080
And I was not even worth it for that.

02:11:40.600 --> 02:11:42.200
I will not play that game.

02:11:42.200 --> 02:11:43.320
It looks so terrible.

02:11:44.920 --> 02:11:47.720
As that wants to know who's watched the Witcher on Netflix.

02:11:47.720 --> 02:11:48.680
I not yet.

02:11:48.680 --> 02:11:51.160
I intended to today and didn't get around to it.

02:11:51.160 --> 02:11:54.280
So soon as that you liked it though, right?

02:11:55.400 --> 02:11:58.840
Dark to see us as just the first episode and as that says liked it.

02:11:58.840 --> 02:12:01.640
So apparently the critics hated it though.

02:12:01.640 --> 02:12:02.600
Well, they don't count.

02:12:03.880 --> 02:12:07.160
Well, the one review I was reading where they gave it an F was like,

02:12:07.160 --> 02:12:09.240
we didn't even bother to watch every episode.

02:12:09.240 --> 02:12:12.920
And I was kind of like, isn't that kind of fucking idiot shitty?

02:12:12.920 --> 02:12:15.240
Like, isn't that like what you're supposed to not do?

02:12:15.240 --> 02:12:17.080
At least they said so in the article.

02:12:17.080 --> 02:12:19.000
So you can see that means their opinion doesn't count.

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:19.500
Yeah.

02:12:20.120 --> 02:12:24.360
So, um, but then a lot of the same stuff's happening with Star Wars, right?

02:12:24.360 --> 02:12:28.040
Like a lot of critics don't like it, but they feel like audiences are really divided.

02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:30.920
Like I've heard people that are like, I love it.

02:12:30.920 --> 02:12:33.720
I've heard a few that are like, I don't love it.

02:12:34.120 --> 02:12:37.000
Um, I don't, you know what, I'm not even going to,

02:12:37.800 --> 02:12:42.840
I'll say it next week when I don't have to be as like crazy about spoilers.

02:12:42.840 --> 02:12:45.320
I haven't seen it, but just kind of like something I've heard about it.

02:12:45.320 --> 02:12:47.720
And I don't want to, I don't want to even remotely go into spoilers,

02:12:47.720 --> 02:12:52.920
but maybe in a week after all the hardcore fans have seen it, I'll do very light spoilers.

02:12:52.920 --> 02:12:57.560
So, but I won't do that tonight because I know people are hypersensitive about spoilers and

02:12:57.560 --> 02:12:59.720
some people might be waiting until Christmas.

02:12:59.720 --> 02:13:05.080
So, well, I can see that we have one of our favorite spoilers waiting in the green room

02:13:05.080 --> 02:13:05.560
right now.

02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:08.760
So let's see if we can get them on the show right now.

02:13:08.760 --> 02:13:09.320
Hi there.

02:13:09.320 --> 02:13:10.360
You're on orange launch radio.

02:13:10.360 --> 02:13:10.760
Who's this?

02:13:11.720 --> 02:13:15.640
Hi, it's Jim Sally trying to figure out how to shut off his other thing that's talking.

02:13:17.960 --> 02:13:18.840
Hey, Jim Sally.

02:13:18.840 --> 02:13:19.640
It's good to hear from you.

02:13:19.640 --> 02:13:22.200
It's a holiday miracle to have you here on the show.

02:13:22.200 --> 02:13:23.880
Oh, isn't it, man?

02:13:23.880 --> 02:13:25.080
Sunday nights are tough.

02:13:25.240 --> 02:13:26.600
How would you sometimes, brother?

02:13:27.160 --> 02:13:28.120
They're tough for you.

02:13:29.960 --> 02:13:34.920
I get my fucking Sunday nights when I get my shit together, you know, family gets together.

02:13:34.920 --> 02:13:37.880
We eat big meals and we fucking pass out on the couch, man.

02:13:37.880 --> 02:13:41.640
I do pass out listening to you guys sometimes snuggling away.

02:13:44.760 --> 02:13:46.280
How are you going to spend your holiday week?

02:13:46.280 --> 02:13:48.280
Is there lots of snuggling planned for your holiday week?

02:13:48.840 --> 02:13:50.760
There's lots of snuggling planned for the holiday week.

02:13:50.760 --> 02:13:51.720
The kids are in the house.

02:13:52.040 --> 02:13:58.760
Unfortunately, we had, my little girl had a, long story short, she got a therapy cat

02:13:58.760 --> 02:14:01.160
to help her with some emotional issues.

02:14:01.160 --> 02:14:07.880
And the poor thing passed away with some kidney failure at like seven weeks, seven weeks old.

02:14:07.880 --> 02:14:11.160
Well, we only had him for seven weeks and the poor cat passed away.

02:14:11.160 --> 02:14:12.280
It's so sad.

02:14:12.280 --> 02:14:13.400
But we live in a small town.

02:14:13.400 --> 02:14:16.760
So we just went on Facebook and it was like, boom, a week later, new cat, bam.

02:14:16.760 --> 02:14:17.640
You know what I mean?

02:14:17.640 --> 02:14:20.840
You do make a little ofrenda for the old cat, you know?

02:14:21.640 --> 02:14:23.320
I gave her some, I got it.

02:14:23.320 --> 02:14:24.360
Listen, don't tell her.

02:14:25.080 --> 02:14:27.720
I told her I got her cremated, but I just took it.

02:14:29.560 --> 02:14:30.360
Oh, okay.

02:14:31.480 --> 02:14:34.120
Wait, but is there, I thought you were whispering because maybe

02:14:34.120 --> 02:14:36.600
there might be a holiday miracle with a new cat?

02:14:37.800 --> 02:14:39.160
No, she already got the new cat.

02:14:39.160 --> 02:14:39.960
I just picked it up.

02:14:40.760 --> 02:14:42.120
Like, so that's what we're doing this week.

02:14:42.120 --> 02:14:44.760
We're snuggling a new little black, new little black kitten.

02:14:45.560 --> 02:14:45.960
Got it.

02:14:45.960 --> 02:14:46.600
Man, it's weird.

02:14:46.600 --> 02:14:48.280
It's weird the things you do for little kids, man.

02:14:48.360 --> 02:14:51.240
I'm telling you right now, there's no fucking way farm boy Jim Sally was

02:14:51.240 --> 02:14:54.600
going to let a goddamn cat shit in a box inside my house.

02:14:55.960 --> 02:15:02.680
This fucking thing shits in a box inside my house and then looks to me like I owe it a treat.

02:15:02.680 --> 02:15:03.560
Fuck you.

02:15:03.560 --> 02:15:05.320
The things you do for little kids.

02:15:05.320 --> 02:15:07.640
How about the things you do for 40 year old men?

02:15:07.640 --> 02:15:12.520
Like Alan and I have a cat and it's just off camera where his potty is.

02:15:12.520 --> 02:15:14.600
Like it's right on the other side of the wall.

02:15:16.280 --> 02:15:17.880
Dude, I'm telling you 40, man.

02:15:18.440 --> 02:15:19.640
You want to hear something crazy?

02:15:21.240 --> 02:15:23.560
Jim Sally's hitting that 40 bell next month, man.

02:15:24.200 --> 02:15:27.960
Well, happy early birthday to you.

02:15:27.960 --> 02:15:29.000
Hey, you know what?

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:32.040
Like 40 is kind of like, it's a whatever.

02:15:32.040 --> 02:15:36.440
Like honestly, turning 40 was a big whatever for me because like for all the hype and all

02:15:36.440 --> 02:15:41.720
the talk about like, oh my God, when you tune 30, like if you don't have XYZ accomplished

02:15:41.720 --> 02:15:45.720
and like all these things that, you know, like our parents put that type of pressure on us,

02:15:45.720 --> 02:15:47.560
then like you're a horrible failure.

02:15:47.560 --> 02:15:51.880
And as it turns out, like my 30s, I didn't really have any of those things you were supposed

02:15:51.880 --> 02:15:52.520
to have.

02:15:52.520 --> 02:15:56.200
And like my 30s overall were actually a lot better than my 20s.

02:15:56.200 --> 02:16:00.280
Like in my 20s, I was still like, I was like weird.

02:16:00.280 --> 02:16:00.840
You know what?

02:16:00.840 --> 02:16:03.240
And I feel like in my 30s, I finally got my shit together.

02:16:03.240 --> 02:16:07.000
My mom never gave me shit because you know what I would turn around and say, how old

02:16:07.000 --> 02:16:07.800
were you when you had me?

02:16:10.280 --> 02:16:12.680
It's so interesting that we come from like two extremes, right?

02:16:12.680 --> 02:16:15.720
Your mom had you at a very young age.

02:16:15.720 --> 02:16:22.920
And my mom, yeah, my mom had me at 38, which in the 70s was a very old age to be having

02:16:22.920 --> 02:16:23.240
children.

02:16:23.240 --> 02:16:26.680
Like I know nowadays what Janet Jackson had to get at 50.

02:16:26.680 --> 02:16:28.840
Uh, what's her name from Flavor Love?

02:16:28.840 --> 02:16:29.640
Let's wait a while.

02:16:31.320 --> 02:16:35.640
She's having a kid at 50 with shit like targeted MRI and fucking prenatal drugs and stuff,

02:16:35.640 --> 02:16:36.120
man.

02:16:36.120 --> 02:16:36.360
True.

02:16:36.360 --> 02:16:38.520
Your mom is doing that shit in the 70s, man.

02:16:38.520 --> 02:16:39.960
No, no, no.

02:16:40.280 --> 02:16:44.200
Here's the crazy thing about that.

02:16:44.200 --> 02:16:50.440
They were told in the, in the 60s, they were told that they couldn't have kids.

02:16:50.440 --> 02:16:53.880
So they adopted and they, they tried and they didn't.

02:16:53.880 --> 02:16:56.520
And so they adopted, they just went to adoption.

02:16:56.520 --> 02:16:58.680
They, they adopted my brother and my sister.

02:16:58.680 --> 02:17:04.360
And then good for them and they weren't even trying years later out of the blue.

02:17:04.360 --> 02:17:09.320
Like just like they did not think we were going to have a kid or try just, it just fucking

02:17:09.320 --> 02:17:10.040
happened.

02:17:10.040 --> 02:17:11.080
Hi, here I am.

02:17:11.080 --> 02:17:13.720
So, um, I was a surprise.

02:17:14.520 --> 02:17:15.240
Surprise.

02:17:15.240 --> 02:17:16.280
I was surprised too.

02:17:17.480 --> 02:17:20.040
So, but we were two very different types of surprises.

02:17:20.040 --> 02:17:21.720
I think there were drugs involved with me.

02:17:21.720 --> 02:17:21.960
Yeah.

02:17:22.680 --> 02:17:26.360
Well, no, I know my daddy was doing some acid.

02:17:26.360 --> 02:17:28.360
Oh, oh.

02:17:28.360 --> 02:17:30.280
And pixel pocket saying, I didn't know that Rob.

02:17:30.280 --> 02:17:31.800
My mom had me at 37.

02:17:31.800 --> 02:17:32.120
Yep.

02:17:32.120 --> 02:17:32.600
In a row.

02:17:33.880 --> 02:17:39.080
So now, now I'm thinking, oh my God, like I'm older than my mom was when she had me

02:17:39.160 --> 02:17:42.280
and I still don't have kids, but I'm like, okay, I'm, I made peace with it.

02:17:42.280 --> 02:17:43.800
Like I kind of don't want them at this point.

02:17:43.800 --> 02:17:45.240
I have kids and guess what?

02:17:45.240 --> 02:17:47.160
Now I can't on purpose.

02:17:47.160 --> 02:17:49.160
Other people's kids are great.

02:17:49.160 --> 02:17:52.360
I can appreciate Loki's children from a distance.

02:17:53.160 --> 02:17:54.360
I hung out with Julian today.

02:17:54.360 --> 02:17:56.040
I can appreciate him from a distance as well.

02:17:56.600 --> 02:17:57.720
I hung out with Julian.

02:17:59.720 --> 02:18:01.880
He's graduated from being Mr.

02:18:01.880 --> 02:18:03.960
Boy to young sir.

02:18:03.960 --> 02:18:06.120
Oh, he's going to be 13 next year.

02:18:06.120 --> 02:18:07.480
Oh, well hell.

02:18:08.440 --> 02:18:09.000
Here you go.

02:18:09.640 --> 02:18:10.600
Sorry, Jim Sally.

02:18:10.600 --> 02:18:13.560
We somehow derailed the Jim Sally train with a tangent train of our own.

02:18:13.560 --> 02:18:14.440
Haha.

02:18:14.440 --> 02:18:14.600
Yeah.

02:18:18.680 --> 02:18:20.360
So technically it's a gaming show.

02:18:20.360 --> 02:18:23.000
I should ask you, are there any games you've been playing lately?

02:18:24.520 --> 02:18:27.080
I finally got to the end of Fallout 4.

02:18:27.080 --> 02:18:31.160
Now I think it's an old game, so I can spoil the ending a little bit at this stage in the

02:18:31.160 --> 02:18:32.920
game, have a little chitchat.

02:18:32.920 --> 02:18:33.720
I don't think it's fine.

02:18:33.720 --> 02:18:36.440
If you haven't beat Fallout 4 yet by now, people fuck off.

02:18:36.520 --> 02:18:37.000
Okay.

02:18:38.280 --> 02:18:38.520
Okay.

02:18:39.480 --> 02:18:43.560
At the end of the, in the middle of the game, you find out that this dude who's an old man

02:18:43.560 --> 02:18:46.120
running the Institute is actually your son from a long time ago.

02:18:46.120 --> 02:18:47.720
And he was kind of fucking me around a little bit.

02:18:47.720 --> 02:18:49.080
And then at the end, he's in a chair.

02:18:49.080 --> 02:18:52.840
And I did the Jim Sally thing that I haven't done for a long time in a Fallout game.

02:18:52.840 --> 02:18:59.080
I stabbed him in the belly as many times as I could before he had a chance to say a word.

02:18:59.080 --> 02:19:00.520
Just to see what would happen.

02:19:00.520 --> 02:19:01.320
And he died.

02:19:01.880 --> 02:19:06.200
And then I beat the game and it was all like, war, shit, war, war.

02:19:06.200 --> 02:19:06.760
Don't have a war.

02:19:06.760 --> 02:19:07.880
You walk with your dog or whatever.

02:19:07.880 --> 02:19:08.920
You're like, fuck that shit.

02:19:08.920 --> 02:19:12.280
And now I finally come back to the Fallout that I love.

02:19:12.280 --> 02:19:18.440
And I just marauder my way from town to town murdering people, murdering them.

02:19:18.440 --> 02:19:19.800
And you know what I found out?

02:19:19.800 --> 02:19:22.040
There's this thing called God Mode.

02:19:22.040 --> 02:19:23.480
They put on some of the characters.

02:19:23.480 --> 02:19:24.280
Did you know about this?

02:19:25.480 --> 02:19:27.160
No, because I barely played any.

02:19:27.160 --> 02:19:28.920
I don't know about this because I have mods.

02:19:29.240 --> 02:19:34.760
Some characters you could stab in the face for days and they just take it and come back

02:19:34.760 --> 02:19:35.560
for more.

02:19:35.560 --> 02:19:38.760
Yeah, I imagine they're characters that are essential to completing the story and stuff.

02:19:38.760 --> 02:19:39.560
Like, they can't die.

02:19:40.280 --> 02:19:41.720
It's very unsatisfied.

02:19:41.720 --> 02:19:42.840
It's very unsatisfied.

02:19:42.840 --> 02:19:47.480
And one night I was wearing my headphones, stabbing an old man in the face repeatedly

02:19:47.480 --> 02:19:49.240
on the ground while he just cried.

02:19:49.240 --> 02:19:50.280
I'm just doing it.

02:19:50.280 --> 02:19:54.200
I was there for like, I want to say, I want to say a good solid 30 seconds of face stabbing.

02:19:54.200 --> 02:19:57.000
A good solid, you fucking make a good shit in.

02:19:57.000 --> 02:19:57.560
You know what I mean?

02:19:57.640 --> 02:19:58.760
Take a shit.

02:19:58.760 --> 02:20:00.680
Oh, good shivin', right?

02:20:00.680 --> 02:20:01.960
So I'm shivin' this guy.

02:20:01.960 --> 02:20:03.560
I'm fucking shivin' him.

02:20:03.560 --> 02:20:09.400
And then I realized, I realized mid-shiv that my four-year-old Daniel is right behind me

02:20:10.040 --> 02:20:12.520
watching me shiv this fucker in the face.

02:20:13.720 --> 02:20:16.760
And he doesn't really know what's going on because I'm wearing headphones, right?

02:20:16.760 --> 02:20:18.760
Because I don't want to wake them up with the shivadins.

02:20:18.760 --> 02:20:20.120
With the shivadins late at night.

02:20:20.680 --> 02:20:22.360
So he asked, what are you doing, daddy?

02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:25.960
The only thing I could think of was to say, I'm trying to brush his teeth.

02:20:28.120 --> 02:20:31.160
He says, he says, what?

02:20:31.160 --> 02:20:32.040
Why?

02:20:32.040 --> 02:20:32.360
Why?

02:20:32.360 --> 02:20:35.080
I said, because he didn't brush his teeth when he was a little boy, Daniel.

02:20:35.080 --> 02:20:36.280
Now look at his mouth.

02:20:36.280 --> 02:20:37.240
It's all gross.

02:20:37.240 --> 02:20:40.200
I gotta fix, I gotta fix his teeth.

02:20:40.200 --> 02:20:44.600
And I'm telling you, he fucking, that kid brushes those teeth to a mirror shine.

02:20:44.600 --> 02:20:49.640
Now when he gets up in the morning, when he gets up in the morning, I thought, I thought

02:20:49.640 --> 02:20:50.920
he bought an electric toothbrush.

02:20:50.920 --> 02:20:51.560
I went upstairs.

02:20:51.560 --> 02:20:53.320
Motherfucker had my dremel out.

02:20:53.320 --> 02:20:54.760
Motherfucker had my dremel out.

02:20:54.760 --> 02:20:55.800
Mirror shine.

02:20:55.800 --> 02:20:56.840
I said, shit.

02:20:56.840 --> 02:21:00.680
And that's why people, it's important to, you know, play video games with your kids

02:21:00.680 --> 02:21:03.960
responsibly and wear headphones and wear headphones.

02:21:05.080 --> 02:21:09.560
Uh, that was possibly the best holiday lesson we'll ever learn here on Orange Launch Radio.

02:21:09.560 --> 02:21:11.080
Thank you so much for that.

02:21:11.080 --> 02:21:15.880
I, I was, I was going to say like, who, who hasn't done like fucked up things in video

02:21:15.880 --> 02:21:16.200
games?

02:21:16.200 --> 02:21:18.040
Like that's what Loki lives for.

02:21:18.040 --> 02:21:20.440
Loki lives for those games that you can do fucked up things.

02:21:20.440 --> 02:21:21.080
Right.

02:21:21.080 --> 02:21:25.480
And like, yeah, usually even, even I admit, like when I first played the elder scrolls

02:21:25.480 --> 02:21:28.840
Oblivion, I'm going back to the one that was launched.

02:21:28.840 --> 02:21:29.400
Oh yeah.

02:21:29.400 --> 02:21:33.000
Like the minute you could stab the king, I tried it.

02:21:33.000 --> 02:21:36.680
Like, you know, I got killed by those guards real fast, but yeah.

02:21:37.560 --> 02:21:38.760
Fuck you, Patrick Stewart.

02:21:40.440 --> 02:21:43.160
I just wanted to see if I could do it.

02:21:43.160 --> 02:21:45.000
Have you ever done it as an accident?

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.160
Like you meant to hit the button to talk to them.

02:21:47.160 --> 02:21:52.840
And instead you hit the button for Fus Ro Dah and it's, and I'm like, oops, sorry.

02:21:52.840 --> 02:21:53.560
Didn't mean to do that.

02:21:53.560 --> 02:21:54.600
I don't know my own strength.

02:21:55.480 --> 02:22:01.800
No, I usually play the game with all sorts of exploits in place.

02:22:02.440 --> 02:22:07.160
I did play with mods on as well before, but like I've played a vanilla, but just exploiting

02:22:07.160 --> 02:22:11.320
the game through the vanilla means like, you know, finding the merchant chest hidden.

02:22:11.320 --> 02:22:17.400
Cause there's like, you can go to, you know, in Skyrim, you can go to, I can't remember

02:22:17.400 --> 02:22:18.120
what it's called now.

02:22:18.920 --> 02:22:23.080
One of the towns though, and you can easily access the merchant chest and just steal all

02:22:23.080 --> 02:22:25.240
their stuff out of there and then sell it back to them.

02:22:26.360 --> 02:22:30.360
And then you, you kill them and then you reload and then you can do it again and again and

02:22:30.360 --> 02:22:32.600
again and you get infinite money at their body.

02:22:32.600 --> 02:22:33.560
Yeah, exactly.

02:22:33.560 --> 02:22:39.960
And then you just let you, you know, do the enchantment potions and spells and you get

02:22:39.960 --> 02:22:45.720
to the point where your armor, you can have like a carry weight of, you know, infinite

02:22:45.720 --> 02:22:48.440
amount of items and just crashes the game.

02:22:48.440 --> 02:22:49.240
Cause you can't sort them.

02:22:49.240 --> 02:22:49.800
You can't do it.

02:22:50.520 --> 02:22:51.320
Jim Sally.

02:22:51.320 --> 02:22:53.640
Hey, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show.

02:22:53.640 --> 02:22:57.800
But before we do, I have to ask you, do you have any new year's resolutions?

02:22:59.080 --> 02:22:59.640
Yeah, man.

02:22:59.640 --> 02:23:07.400
My new year resolution this year is to really try to set some time aside to, you know, start

02:23:07.400 --> 02:23:10.040
a little archive or something.

02:23:10.040 --> 02:23:11.320
I got to get my shit together.

02:23:11.320 --> 02:23:14.920
I just got to find a better Sunday night at fucking midnight to get it going.

02:23:17.080 --> 02:23:19.640
So I've always started looking for help.

02:23:19.640 --> 02:23:20.280
Good point.

02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:21.400
All right.

02:23:21.400 --> 02:23:25.480
Well, I bet you have a chat room full of people here who love your phone calls.

02:23:25.480 --> 02:23:26.760
That would be happy to help.

02:23:26.760 --> 02:23:29.000
However, we can't end it for what it's worth.

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:31.640
All of these episodes of the show are archived.

02:23:31.640 --> 02:23:36.760
So someday when your kid is 18, you can play him the clip of daddy teaching him to brush

02:23:36.760 --> 02:23:37.260
his teeth.

02:23:37.880 --> 02:23:38.680
Can you imagine?

02:23:39.320 --> 02:23:40.680
The psychiatric goes alone.

02:23:42.680 --> 02:23:46.200
I can't wait for Loki's kids to be old enough to understand this show.

02:23:46.280 --> 02:23:51.240
I'm this old and don't understand the show.

02:23:52.760 --> 02:23:53.640
Fair enough.

02:23:53.640 --> 02:23:54.140
All right.

02:23:55.080 --> 02:23:56.840
Happy holidays, bitches.

02:23:56.840 --> 02:23:57.160
All right.

02:23:57.160 --> 02:23:58.120
Happy holidays, Jim.

02:23:58.120 --> 02:23:59.160
Sally, thanks for the call.

02:23:59.160 --> 02:23:59.960
Take care.

02:23:59.960 --> 02:24:00.680
Take care of my friend.

02:24:01.320 --> 02:24:02.200
Later, brother.

02:24:02.200 --> 02:24:03.480
Always, always great to hear from you.

02:24:03.480 --> 02:24:03.980
Bye bye.

02:24:05.640 --> 02:24:06.440
That was a treat.

02:24:06.440 --> 02:24:09.080
That was a holiday miracle right there.

02:24:09.080 --> 02:24:09.480
All right.

02:24:09.480 --> 02:24:13.160
I think on that note, we will start to wrap things up here unless Loki found any other

02:24:13.160 --> 02:24:15.240
last minute stories worth mentioning.

02:24:15.240 --> 02:24:19.880
It wasn't really worth mentioning, but just as people figured out that Sasha Gray is also

02:24:19.880 --> 02:24:23.480
now a YouTube gaming streamer and still like that in Twitch as well.

02:24:23.480 --> 02:24:23.960
Who?

02:24:23.960 --> 02:24:25.240
Sasha Gray, the porn star.

02:24:26.200 --> 02:24:26.920
Who?

02:24:26.920 --> 02:24:28.760
Yeah, she's done things.

02:24:28.760 --> 02:24:31.480
I mean, she's done like non-porn things.

02:24:31.480 --> 02:24:32.200
Would I know them?

02:24:33.560 --> 02:24:34.440
I don't know.

02:24:34.440 --> 02:24:36.120
She's she's pretty mainstream.

02:24:36.120 --> 02:24:36.760
Okay.

02:24:36.760 --> 02:24:39.400
But like everyone's like, Oh my God, what?

02:24:39.400 --> 02:24:44.200
It's it's a girl that's naked sometimes that likes games like me, like a human being.

02:24:44.200 --> 02:24:44.920
Oh my God.

02:24:44.920 --> 02:24:46.360
People like human things.

02:24:46.920 --> 02:24:47.720
Imagine that.

02:24:47.720 --> 02:24:48.200
Fancy that.

02:24:48.200 --> 02:24:48.600
I know.

02:24:48.600 --> 02:24:49.880
It's just so ridiculous.

02:24:49.880 --> 02:24:52.280
The celebrities, they're real people too.

02:24:52.280 --> 02:24:52.840
Who knew?

02:24:52.840 --> 02:24:53.880
It's like, who cares?

02:24:54.840 --> 02:24:55.640
All right.

02:24:55.640 --> 02:24:59.880
Anyhow, on that note, just see, we had Jim Sally call a pornography.

02:24:59.880 --> 02:25:00.520
I think we're good.

02:25:01.240 --> 02:25:06.680
So we're going to wrap up and I hope everybody has a great holiday week no matter what it

02:25:06.680 --> 02:25:07.400
is you celebrate.

02:25:07.400 --> 02:25:10.520
I'm sure most of you are in the Christmas camp or the Hanukkah camp just because I haven't

02:25:10.520 --> 02:25:14.120
heard the other ones really coming up in chat, but whatever it is that you're celebrating.

02:25:14.200 --> 02:25:18.200
I hope you have a wonderful week and, uh, you know, I hope, uh, if you're doing family

02:25:18.200 --> 02:25:19.800
stuff, I hope family stuff is great.

02:25:19.800 --> 02:25:23.080
If you don't have a lot of family stuff going on, I hope friends stuff is great.

02:25:23.080 --> 02:25:25.800
Um, if you don't have a lot of either of those things going on, just cause your friends are

02:25:25.800 --> 02:25:28.920
out of town or what have you, and you're just, you're sitting around playing video games.

02:25:28.920 --> 02:25:32.920
I hope that is great too, because this is a great time of year to catch up on that stuff.

02:25:32.920 --> 02:25:37.240
And if you're working through the holiday, you know, I hope you make some fucking money.

02:25:37.240 --> 02:25:38.760
I hope you make a lot of fucking money.

02:25:39.320 --> 02:25:40.440
So that's my goal.

02:25:40.440 --> 02:25:41.240
Yeah, there you go.

02:25:41.240 --> 02:25:43.640
So I hope, uh, I hope you don't have any friends at all.

02:25:44.280 --> 02:25:47.080
Um, where are your friends here at fog network?

02:25:47.080 --> 02:25:48.760
Unless you're a Nazi then I'll just punch you.

02:25:48.760 --> 02:25:49.320
All right.

02:25:49.320 --> 02:25:51.000
Anyhow, uh, we're going to wrap up.

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:53.080
Thank you guys so much for listening to orange on radio.

02:25:53.080 --> 02:25:54.360
We will be back next week.

02:25:54.360 --> 02:25:57.880
I'm anticipating it's going to be a very light news week, but we will talk about some topics

02:25:57.880 --> 02:26:02.440
such as looking back on not only this year in gaming, but looking back on the decade in gaming.

02:26:02.440 --> 02:26:06.040
I'm sure a lot of your favorite gaming podcasts are gonna be doing something very similar,

02:26:06.040 --> 02:26:09.240
but, uh, we'll do it our way here at orange on radio next week.

02:26:09.240 --> 02:26:11.560
And if there are any new stories that break, we'll talk about that.

02:26:11.560 --> 02:26:14.920
We'll get this brain age thing figured out and talk about that next week.

02:26:14.920 --> 02:26:17.400
Uh, and, uh, yeah, so we'll be back in seven days.

02:26:17.400 --> 02:26:20.360
If you enjoyed what you heard here at orange on radio, please tell a friend or two about

02:26:20.360 --> 02:26:22.760
the show because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:26:22.760 --> 02:26:26.520
But if the voices aren't here to put out on air, what else can we do?

02:26:26.520 --> 02:26:27.080
We don't have them.

02:26:27.080 --> 02:26:29.960
So, um, we really appreciate you guys, uh, to help us spread the word.

02:26:29.960 --> 02:26:32.280
I do have a thing actually, and I almost forgot.

02:26:32.280 --> 02:26:35.560
I would like for our listeners to send me recipes.

02:26:35.560 --> 02:26:36.440
Hey, wait a minute.

02:26:36.440 --> 02:26:38.840
What happened to the last time you asked him to send you stuff?

02:26:39.240 --> 02:26:40.360
No one fucking did.

02:26:40.360 --> 02:26:40.600
Yeah.

02:26:40.600 --> 02:26:42.360
I thought I saw some tweets come through.

02:26:42.360 --> 02:26:42.680
No.

02:26:42.680 --> 02:26:43.720
The educational stuff.

02:26:43.720 --> 02:26:44.520
That's different.

02:26:44.520 --> 02:26:46.920
I'm going to do a book, an OLR cookbook.

02:26:46.920 --> 02:26:47.400
Okay.

02:26:47.400 --> 02:26:52.280
With listeners, favorite recipes with whatever gets made off of it,

02:26:52.280 --> 02:26:53.640
going to directly benefit the show.

02:26:54.280 --> 02:26:56.440
As that says, Ooh, baby, what kind of recipes?

02:26:56.440 --> 02:26:57.880
How about the recipe to your nuts?

02:26:57.880 --> 02:27:02.280
And if you've got pictures of them, good high resolution pictures of your nuts,

02:27:02.280 --> 02:27:04.760
of your nuts, go ahead and send them in.

02:27:04.760 --> 02:27:12.120
You can either DM me on, um, on, uh, the, the Twitters, um, or the Instagrams.

02:27:12.760 --> 02:27:17.160
I'm at dark soccer, both places, or you can, I guess, send it to our mailbox.

02:27:17.160 --> 02:27:20.600
And to be clear, because I do not want to be banned on Twitch or violate their

02:27:20.600 --> 02:27:21.240
terms of service.

02:27:21.240 --> 02:27:27.160
We are talking about pecans, walnuts, amens, those type of nuts.

02:27:27.160 --> 02:27:31.560
High resolution pictures of those nuts sent to her GMs.

02:27:31.560 --> 02:27:34.040
Recipes are what I want.

02:27:34.040 --> 02:27:34.600
Yes.

02:27:34.600 --> 02:27:38.200
And I want to thank Brad and Marissa for already sharing some recipes with me.

02:27:38.200 --> 02:27:38.760
Yay.

02:27:38.760 --> 02:27:44.440
Um, I would just like specifics, have, have it detailed and send me pictures

02:27:44.440 --> 02:27:47.960
because then, and express permission to publish these.

02:27:48.680 --> 02:27:53.000
And that way when the book comes out, I'll make it available for everyone.

02:27:53.000 --> 02:27:55.800
Anyone who wants to buy a copy of it, just know that the money is going to go

02:27:55.800 --> 02:27:57.320
back into the OLR budget.

02:27:57.320 --> 02:27:58.040
Fun.

02:27:58.040 --> 02:28:00.440
Or bog budget or whatever budget.

02:28:00.440 --> 02:28:00.600
Yeah.

02:28:00.600 --> 02:28:04.360
Well, maybe we'd be better to just donate it straight to charity.

02:28:04.360 --> 02:28:08.200
Just because when it comes to the business things, you know, we'll talk about

02:28:08.200 --> 02:28:09.080
it off here.

02:28:09.080 --> 02:28:09.400
All right.

02:28:10.120 --> 02:28:13.000
So, um, charity is a good thing though, right?

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:19.400
We'll donate it to, uh, to the, um, uh, uh, coding for kids stuff.

02:28:20.040 --> 02:28:20.680
That'd be fun.

02:28:20.680 --> 02:28:21.000
Yeah.

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:22.600
Or, um, extra life.

02:28:22.600 --> 02:28:23.560
Who would that be going to?

02:28:23.560 --> 02:28:24.360
Yeah.

02:28:24.360 --> 02:28:24.760
All right.

02:28:24.760 --> 02:28:26.440
Anyway, um, let's see.

02:28:26.440 --> 02:28:27.640
So what was I going to say?

02:28:27.640 --> 02:28:27.960
Final.

02:28:27.960 --> 02:28:28.360
Oh yeah.

02:28:28.920 --> 02:28:31.000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts and really wrap it up here

02:28:31.000 --> 02:28:31.400
tonight.

02:28:31.400 --> 02:28:33.080
So, um, Loki, we'll start with you.

02:28:33.080 --> 02:28:34.120
What's your final thought here?

02:28:34.120 --> 02:28:38.840
I hate Christmas and buying things, mainly the spending of the money and the

02:28:38.840 --> 02:28:39.480
buying things.

02:28:39.480 --> 02:28:41.320
Not necessarily the Christmas part.

02:28:41.320 --> 02:28:44.120
It's just, it's expensive.

02:28:44.120 --> 02:28:46.280
Well, someone's going to get visited by three ghosts tonight.

02:28:47.640 --> 02:28:48.760
I hope they bring money.

02:28:50.440 --> 02:28:53.720
No, he won't be because he's not like a wealthy miser.

02:28:55.240 --> 02:28:56.600
He's not playing his employees.

02:28:58.600 --> 02:28:59.320
All right.

02:28:59.320 --> 02:29:00.040
Uh, let's see.

02:29:00.040 --> 02:29:03.960
My final thought, uh, my final thought is, um, I hope everybody

02:29:03.960 --> 02:29:06.920
has a great holiday and I look forward to seeing cats.

02:29:06.920 --> 02:29:09.080
I'm, I'm at the patched version of cat cats.

02:29:09.080 --> 02:29:12.440
1.1 cats, cats that are patched.

02:29:14.520 --> 02:29:17.720
I used to actually sing the Gumby cat song to, to share me.

02:29:17.720 --> 02:29:21.160
Oh, but instead of Jenny, any dots, she was sure me where me pants.

02:29:22.520 --> 02:29:26.440
Um, so my final thought, thank God for fleece leggings.

02:29:27.720 --> 02:29:32.680
I'm cold all the fucking time and fleece leggings make me not so cold.

02:29:33.320 --> 02:29:33.720
Love it.

02:29:34.280 --> 02:29:34.760
All right.

02:29:34.760 --> 02:29:35.800
That's going to do it.

02:29:35.800 --> 02:29:36.840
Have a great one, everybody.

02:29:36.840 --> 02:29:42.440
We'll see you in seven days for the last orange lounge radio of the decade.

02:29:44.120 --> 02:29:45.160

Good night, everybody.
