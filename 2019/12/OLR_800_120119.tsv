0	17740	This week No Man's Sky's first landing was more of a thud than a splash, but the waves
17740	21000	made over time have become more impressive all without any post-purchase monetization

173080	177920	were talking about I felt I fell down earlier yeah she's sick you injured yourself it's just
177920	182720	a minor injury oh it's only a flesh wound it pretty much yeah it's only a flesh okay what
182720	188080	happened we all want to know oh my kids wanted me to take them to roller skating so they went
188080	194000	roller skating and I I used to roller blade like a ton like all the time and the last time we went
194000	201700	rollerblading which was not that long ago I my one of my straps on my blades broke so I had to
201700	207040	rent a pair today and so they had like a speed skating in session which I like doing that's fun
207880	212400	so I tried to go around the corner you know I usually crisscross the kind of go faster
212400	216800	over around the corners and because they're profiling the wheels is different than what
216800	223400	I'm used to it slipped inside I hit the ground on my knee rolled to my elbow and then got back
223400	230400	up so it's it scraped it a little bit but it's like I'm like ow but I'm gonna get back up and
230400	236400	just keep going I mean it's not like I broke my leg or something congrats you're old it's not
236400	240880	all this is what I used to do like all the time I've done this I've gotten this injury so many
240880	247600	times at least it was in a rink and not on like asphalt which is typically the case true I have
247600	253360	a sun-bleached spot on the sweater do you oh well oh well well you've had it a while episode 3 was
253360	258600	out so you know episode 9 is coming out soon I was at the movies yesterday we will get into gaming's
258600	262560	but it just wouldn't be an episode of orange entre do if there weren't tangents you know no it's
262560	266160	funny though when we were in the rink sorry how a tangent to the tangent November because we had
266160	270800	talked about like we should do something like like stupid for like one of these like big like
270800	275840	numbered episodes or something and I was like suggesting like hey we could rent out the roller
275840	280400	because that's dirt cheap huh and so I thought about that again well our live on roller skates
280400	287480	yeah why here's the thing let me let me loan you some sage advice for having done this for 800
287480	294560	episodes why do we have to do it for 800 episodes why can't we celebrate 823 like every you do
294560	300720	whatever we want every episode should be celebrated every every every olr is a blessing every week we
300720	309240	don't kill each other is a success story is it not it's a toll-free episode anyway going to wait
309240	313920	what was my oh yes I went to the movies I went to see knives out which you know I want to see that
313920	319480	because it's like clue it what I hear like clue dark here's a lot of my friends really loved it
319480	324240	I liked it I didn't love it but I liked it and I don't know if it was really clue I don't know if
324240	329160	you can be clue when you reference clue in the film however it did have Jamie Lee Curtis who's
329160	333720	a gamer we all know that right and she was great there just wasn't enough of her like I think there
333720	337080	was a lot of people in it where I was like we hardly got to see him but anyway that's all I
337080	342560	don't want spoil too much anyway so anyway um I also want to say I I am looking at chat because
342600	348200	again we tape live over at twitch TV slash vog network and I you guys are really donating biddies
348200	351920	tonight and I see you guys doing I don't usually call out all the bit donations because they go
351920	357080	across the bottom but I will at the end of the show when we're not recording for the podcast but
357080	363440	I see several of you are doing 800 biddies for 800 episodes and I know that's no small amount
363440	369360	of biddies so I really want to just acknowledge that and say thank you that is very very kind and
369360	376480	you know we wanted to at the top of the show here you know even if we've done 500 episodes
376480	383240	and 200 episodes and 700 episodes and we've done 10 years and 12 years and so forth I I I didn't
383240	386400	want to toot our own horn too much but I didn't want to take this opportunity at the top of the
386400	393160	show to just say thanks I mean you guys are truly what keeps this going gives us that energy to do
393160	398160	this show every week even when maybe we're feeling a little sick or we've injured ourselves earlier
398160	402680	in the day and maybe we don't necessarily always feel like coming in showing up to doing it it's
402680	406960	like by the time we're here and you guys are here and interacting with it and bringing that
406960	415100	enthusiasm that you guys do it really means a lot and obviously if we haven't broken it big by now
415100	420520	800 episodes and 17 years in we're probably not going to but I think we all made peace with that
420520	426640	a long time ago and still even with our small audience we have a very loyal and great little
426720	433560	family here and that's okay I like small families I don't I mean like when I used to go to the
433560	438200	extended family for holidays that's what all the messes happen that's all the drama and political
438200	444600	start small family gatherings awesome so we like the small family that we have here and I still you
444600	451560	know this show has afforded us many opportunities still even with its you know smaller size than I
451560	456600	think I would have ever gotten otherwise we were just talking about on Bobby's show before we went
456600	461600	live tonight a cameo that we had in a video game like that would have never happened if it wasn't
461600	468600	for this show we got to go to e3 back when it was cool like in its most heyday years you know that
468600	473640	was something because of this show that you know we got to do and and there's been other industry
473640	482080	events I've I have been an acknowledged professional at a very large convention every
482080	487320	year for the past couple years that is an amazing feat that I'm so thankful and humble for with this
487320	491800	show so thank you guys so much for showing up every week and giving us that motivation we need
491800	497840	to keep doing this show every single week thank you thank you thank you and yeah I let swung tongue
497840	505080	gave a donation and said happy 800 that's all I got that's okay you know we the the bits are
505080	511520	an extra thank you we'd never expect them but they are very very much appreciated and help us
511520	516520	to keep vog network as a business and do business II type of things that we do want to continue to
516520	524760	expand on yeah swung tongue said you were on TV that's true we thank you for reminding me yeah
524760	530640	there was a couple times and on in the newspaper which I still have that somewhere yeah I had it
530640	535840	it's really yellow though yeah it was it was early on in the life of the show when we were in the
535840	540400	newspaper because that was right when podcasting first broke and if you search for like Sacramento
540400	546720	in iTunes you got us like there wasn't you know now there's probably shows about Sacramento in
546720	551240	there and you know there's other that Sacramento has a number one gaming podcast now that comes up
551240	559160	in the results and all this other stuff that wasn't there back when we started so yeah like
559160	564840	we were what came up so the newspaper came out to do that and then the news station came out and did
564840	570720	one story at my place about podcasting but then what was really cool is that they remembered us
570720	575600	or something because when Guitar Hero came out the first one they would I wasn't there it was just
575600	582200	you and Loki so maybe hide on my bimani stuff oh yeah oh because the Guitar Hero guy the like PR
582200	587480	guy for a red or was it red octane at the time so you went as well to like he gave you guys a
587480	593320	personal demo of the game we have all the fun with it yeah no it's cool it was very very very
593320	600040	cool appreciate that and we had that nice big TV in the living room at the house in is a few
600040	604880	houses ago for me yeah but you know that house oh no I do yeah I do nice and shiny in there
604880	608560	I'm a necessary 100 Matt and chat says it's so much fun yeah that's where that quote came from
608560	613920	it's still on YouTube there's an orange on radio YouTube channel and you can still see that old
613920	619960	story it's an old story at this point yeah well what my god how many years ago to Dave Walker
619960	628480	retire and he's the one doing the the news anchor thing introducing the story I don't know also
628480	635720	here's the other interesting thing about that story they never name our show they never cuz
635720	641600	they're assholes they know I don't know if it's because they can't endorse it or whatever but
641600	648520	they never name our show um to be fair they also say at one point in the news story governor
648520	653800	Schwarzenegger just started a podcast because again it's that old so they said governor
653800	657920	Schwarzenegger started a podcast but they never named that program either because remember they
657920	666520	had the kid on the skateboard yeah I was like podcast listener you young person do you know
666520	674240	what podcasts are why yes sir I do it's funny that it made us such a niche thing back then
674240	679800	and now it's like now podcasting is that stereotype thing where it's like you know
679800	683760	you've all heard those jokes and I why don't you have a podcast yet or I hate these jokes
683760	687960	but I hate them but we've all heard them the one you know what do you call three white dudes in
687960	693800	their 30s in the basement a podcast you know that that whole thing and I'm just like the podcast I
693800	697720	I don't like that joke because I really really want podcasting to be for everybody I heard that
697720	702880	one yeah I have it's it's it's stupid I've seen it on Twitter I've seen a lot of really dumb
702880	708480	podcast jokes on Twitter and I that's one thing that like really irks me is that podcasting is
708480	715080	like because I think those jokes reinforce that it's only for one particular audience when it
715080	719800	really isn't it's really for everybody like everybody should be able to get their voice
719800	724840	out there and be heard and it's not just podcasting because now we live in this era of YouTube as much
724840	731160	as I don't like YouTube as a business and twitch where you know you can get on and have your own
731160	736040	streams and stuff they're really it's really really easy to have your voice heard when you
736040	740040	know again back in 2006 when these news stations featured us it was a little bit more of a novelty
740040	746880	wasn't it anyway all right anyhow sorry I it was a little bit of a tangent but we wanted to say
746880	751280	something here at the top of the show for episode number 800 so again thank you all for being with
751280	755080	us let's get into some video game news because I know that's what we're really about here at
755080	762440	the show what I was watching the video of my DDR pads are in the background oh yeah oh yeah that
762440	767200	was pretty funny yeah for sure oh my gosh Matt you look so young all right anyway let's get into
767200	774000	our kickoff topic tonight which has to do with pokemons so Loki you want to start us off here
774000	778080	with this kickoff topic about what's going on with the Pokemon Pokemon company so apparently arrest
778080	784240	you they're gonna they're gonna come and find you they have a specific set of skills that they're
784240	790840	gonna use to find you and kill you or something but anyways so yes apparently the Pokemon company
790840	798440	hired some outside forensic experts who are trying to locate I guess some people that leaked
798440	805760	information about Pokemon so they had been able to identify for discord users one who was the
805760	812880	source and a few others that were helping him spread the images through 4chan and reddit and
812960	818400	with that of course they've since they found their usernames they don't know who those people are so
818400	824920	now they've gone to the district court in Seattle to try to get a hold of that information from
824920	832560	discord and 4chan to try to track down who the people are under those usernames so that's
832560	839560	interesting I don't know this has been done like but is it really a crime to leak information about
839720	845520	something I mean if you're not under an NDA and somehow you came across that information is that
845520	851200	really a crime well that's the problem is that somewhere along the line in NDA had to be broken
851200	856360	like if I just happenstance accidentally came across something then somebody still broke an
856360	860600	NDA to get the game but then that person be in trouble but like if I if I like how do you find
860600	865560	that out but say I broke an NDA but they know one person but like say I broke an NDA and gave
865560	869480	information to somebody else and then that person didn't spread the information out but now you're
869480	875440	hunting after this person that doesn't make any sense to me because it's not a crime it's an
875440	881280	inconvenience for your marketing campaign but it's not a crime it's not a crime as in you can't go to
881280	888160	jail per se but they would have a case in civil court and I think I kind of think they have a
888160	895120	right to protect themselves in that capacity because you know it's just like if the new Star
895120	900280	Wars movie leaked to the internet tomorrow you know three weeks before it's supposed to be in
900280	904720	theaters would it necessarily be the person who leaked its fault if it was something that was
904720	910280	given to them no but it's still going to financially damage the results of the film that's copyright
910280	914720	theft that's that's not say that'd be like if you leaked a copy of Pokemon Sword and Shield to the
914720	918680	internet and then people based played that and they're like oh here's all the secrets that's
918680	924040	different versus like here's some information I've heard about like say that would be the equivalent
924040	930400	of somebody leaking the script for Star Wars the new Star Wars movie or the bits of the script of
930400	938920	the new Star Wars movie I don't know I still think it's a slippery slope but I guess they got to try
938920	946680	Elliot B in our chat says detective Pikachu on the case absolutely why we are in chat says argument
946680	950520	I own this physical copy of the game I can do with it as I please counter argument you don't
950520	954840	own the software your license to use it and doing this is a violation of the license agreement I
954840	959000	don't think anybody's going to jail over this but I think Nintendo wants to figure out where is the
959000	965240	leak so we can plug it up you know and potentially go after somebody in a civil court now I I had
965240	969560	heard a story about this but you can take it with a grain of salt because I don't have the article
969560	974120	or the receipts to back it up so maybe this is full of shit and I'm fully admitting that but I
974120	982120	had heard that there were live streams of Pokemon days before it was released that were somehow
982120	987880	altered or edited or maybe pre-releases or something that made the game look worse than it
987880	993720	actually was when it came to things like loading times yeah things of that nature but that's kind
993720	999960	of bullshit like and this was this was angry Dex it you know people that just wanted to bag on game
999960	1005720	that's still though I mean you're gonna have a hard time proving damages for something like
1005720	1011480	that because you can say well this one video got out there and we suffered you know X number of
1011480	1017880	dollars in damages yeah but like if you sign an NDA that says if you spill you are it says in that
1017880	1022200	NDA you will pay one million dollars and I'm thinking in my mind today there was just some
1022200	1027400	article going around Facebook today because this was a ridiculous use of an NDA but um a comic one
1027400	1031400	of the guys from Saturday Night Live the young guy that was with Ariana Grande for a short time
1031400	1036680	what the hell's his name the kid from Davidson him okay he was doing a stand-up show in San Francisco
1036680	1043800	he was making people sign NDAs and the NDA said in it somebody posted it online like you uh would
1043800	1048840	pay one million dollars if you even like talked about the contents of the show online and people
1048840	1053960	were saying how ridiculous that was because you couldn't even criticize or critique the show I
1053960	1057960	mean it's one thing to be like you can't have your cell phones out during the show because that is
1057960	1062520	pretty bullshit when people record stand-up comic routines and put it on their own YouTube yeah that
1062520	1069160	is that's that's joke theft you know it's it's it's not that's copyright theft exactly um so
1069160	1073960	that's you know not okay but to take it to the extremes of an NDA where you can't even critique
1073960	1077880	it that's a little bit like you're not really within your realm here anyway the reason why I
1077880	1082440	bring that up is because it showed the NDA and it said you break this you pay a million dollars so
1082440	1089080	you know in Nintendo's NDA and any NDA um if you go on a reality tv show like survivor where
1089640	1094120	they know who won survivor whatever the next one is they already know because it's already been
1094120	1100040	filmed and done I mean okay technically they don't know who wins wins until they reveal the votes
1100040	1103960	but they know they know generally who gets voted out when and who's in the fight right but and it's
1103960	1109400	in their contract you break this you're paying like four million dollars they don't it's up to
1109400	1115880	that it's it could say you could fake you could face penalties of this whereas I still think
1115880	1121560	though even if there was a contract like that I still have a hard time believing that they can
1121560	1127640	prove damages on that okay but counterpoint who has the better lawyers Nintendo or 4chan kid
1129880	1135800	just saying Nintendo's gonna yeah but but to that though Pokemon company so to that though
1135800	1140840	like I don't know where 4chan is necessarily located is but it's not the site they're only
1140840	1145640	trying to get the site to reveal who it is but like if they're but if I understand that though
1145640	1149400	but if they're in a foreign country if they're look central in a foreign country they can say
1149400	1153880	fuck you and your stupid you know court order we're not gonna follow it if Nintendo doesn't
1153880	1159320	have a presence in that country but remember Nintendo has established in USA Canada Japan
1159960	1165800	many parts of uh you know overseas in Britain and surrounding countries I think they're gonna
1165800	1173960	have better luck with discord but but even still though that I don't know I think it's a it's a
1173960	1180120	slippery slope because then then what then you're gonna like start saying oh well these people they
1180120	1185240	they had bad things to say about our game let's find out who they are I mean like you could argue
1185240	1190600	that they cause damages because of their negative critique I understand that they should be
1190600	1198680	protected but but I'm Nintendo and I can fucking sue people so I don't know I go ahead just the
1198680	1204040	thing is is that with any kind of tech company be it software hardware you name it they're
1205720	1213160	part of their financial security lies in secrecy it lies in having something be locked to your
1214120	1224120	self as a proprietary secret so that when you release said item to to quote a term from another
1224120	1231800	company your customers are surprised and delighted by it to have anything sneak out about it
1231800	1241880	beforehand is going to impact that it may you know chase people off of buying the product it may
1241960	1247080	affect those upcoming sales and I think that what they're doing is not over reactionary at all
1247960	1255320	I think that it's like you said they have a leak to plug just because it happens now does not mean
1255320	1265720	this will not happen again right and so I actually I think even just by pursuing it the the simple
1265720	1270040	pursuit of it will set a precedence that companies are going to take it seriously
1270600	1275960	I think for the most part like I don't think it's a big deal that like final evolution you know I
1275960	1280280	realize for hardcore Pokemon fans it is a big deal but I do agree with Loki in a sense that like you
1280280	1285640	know certain types of information getting leaked is not a big deal oh no you saw what Grookey's
1285640	1290040	final form looked like you know like like how would like let's just assume that like nothing
1290040	1294760	got leaked how would people be taking like this Dexit stuff like because I don't think they
1294840	1300360	announced like here's the Pokemon well you're you just walked right into what my follow-up point is
1300360	1304200	is I think that's what actually makes this a little bit different and why Nintendo wants to
1304200	1309880	go after it because of that hard negativity about Dexit that was online which ultimately didn't
1309880	1316440	matter when it came to sales because it really is selling thing yeah but it still leaks showed you
1316440	1321480	who was missing and that was something Nintendo was trying to protect and I think that might be
1321480	1326680	the key difference here is that I think it's that specifically where that kind of crossed the line
1326680	1330600	for Nintendo was that they knew this was something that was negative and all the ramp up and they did
1330600	1336440	not want it out there who specifically was cut until till the final minute I just kind of think
1336440	1345000	that's what was going on now if and I'm gonna say bold if underline if if okay circled it's true
1345000	1350600	that somebody was streaming it and they were streaming a misrepresented fully copy of the game
1350600	1354200	then I think Nintendo should take that person for everything they got honestly because I think
1354200	1357320	that is fucked if they're streaming though they should be able to find them through
1357960	1362360	Twitch or YouTube or whomever so again that but that and that's if that was even true which might
1362360	1367720	not have been this is just something I was told so but I think that is way past the line of what's
1367720	1372280	acceptable and so forth and I think especially if you're you're streaming a game you're misrepresenting
1372280	1377080	what that game even is which is so weird that we live in this world where you have to talk about
1377080	1384040	that but I mean y'all have heard of in fake news and I was trying to think of another name for it
1384040	1390360	but I can't it's fake news and what you know the social media does in the spread of that type of
1390360	1396120	you know heavily partisan one way or another type of news and so forth I mean here we are where
1396120	1401320	video games are now kind of walking down the similar path we have we have fake video game news
1402200	1407960	maybe but I imagine we're not that far away from that being a reality so anyway but I think the
1407960	1412520	DeXit thing at its core is what you know Nintendo was was trying to protect now at the end of the
1412520	1416920	day you know and I've said this on a previous episode of OLR whereas I think the DeXit thing
1416920	1421080	is like oh man that would have been like that would have been the icing that would have been
1421080	1425480	like the that would have been that sweet glaze that extra thing that would have made this a
1426200	1431560	perfect fucking dessert Pokemon Sword and Shield is still a really fucking good dessert and I'll
1431560	1437480	get into more of that later on I think it's it's a great game personally so I mean is the DeXit
1437480	1443000	thing noticed yeah is it does it damn the whole game I don't think so I think there's still plenty
1443000	1449640	of variety and things to do then why hide it like I don't understand like if it's such it's if it I
1449640	1455320	it just seems disingenuous to me is the whole point it's like oh we want to hide it before
1456200	1460600	so we get all those pre-sale copies out there and then it's like oh now you can find out about it
1460600	1465240	like I don't know based on the social media and that negativity on social media there was probably
1465240	1470840	a legit concern within Nintendo that it would impact sales I mean now do you just say oh well
1470840	1477160	it didn't impact it uh sales all harm no all harm don't you want to have your in consumers be well
1477160	1480840	I guess you don't want your consumers to be well informed when purchasing your products you don't
1480840	1485800	want to know like what intricacies there are so they can make a you know educated decision in
1485800	1490840	their purchase I mean I guess that should be expected from a company that sells two copies
1490840	1497640	of their game every year so why not I don't know I just I have a hard time giving them a bit here
1497640	1504040	Loki and say you know what Rey is Princess Leia's sister enjoy episode nine now that's not a real
1504040	1507400	spoiler I don't know shit about what goes on that movie and I don't think age-wise that would work
1507400	1511960	anyway I made that up so don't worry exhale it's a fake spoiler but let's just say I did I just
1511960	1515560	blurred it out I just want you to be informed before you go see that movie here's the big
1515560	1521720	here's the big spoiler about the ending I mean isn't that kind of fucked up and like wouldn't
1521720	1526520	I mean wouldn't like you know if I'm advertising on my website you know like oh here's the big
1526520	1532200	twist at the end of episode nine it's like IGM publishes this headline no I guess in the sense
1532200	1536440	if you're trying to say that that's different than the expectations I would have for the movie
1536440	1541720	then that would be a huge um spoiler I picked something ridiculous so you all wouldn't panic
1541720	1547240	so no my my under see what I'm saying is so is it's drastically different from other pokemon
1547240	1554280	game whereas the other pokemon games they have they continue to add to you know the full um
1555240	1559800	list of pokemon they keep adding to it whereas this is the first one where they have taken
1559800	1565560	some away and then added some to that as well so that is what I'm saying about being well
1565560	1572120	informed because most people going into it having not known that might think oh hey cool I'm gonna
1572120	1575560	have all my favorite pokemon in there plus I'm gonna get some new ones and then they go there
1575560	1581000	and wait a second where are these pokemon oh they were taken out of the game I didn't know that that
1581000	1586200	kind of sucks you know and that that is what I'm talking about being you know well informed about
1586200	1590280	a games if you're taking something and you're drastically changing something to be fair they
1590280	1594680	weren't that shifty about it they announced like as far back as e3 that not all the pokemon were
1594680	1598520	going to be in it because they were asked that question very directly is every pokemon in this
1598520	1604680	game and they did say no and that was what started the whole hubbub then finally somebody got a copy
1604680	1610040	of the game and said oh I I have the answer here find out if your faves made the cut here's the list
1610040	1615560	and then here cue the reddit post once a day here is one pokemon family that has been eliminated
1615560	1623080	from pokemon it's so fucking dramatic jesus christ jigglypuff well she dead so
1624040	1625080	enjoy pokemon
1627960	1635960	anyway rest in peace jigglypuff with the you know all forever in our hearts with carnations
1635960	1641720	tombstone I mean come on loki some people are really fucking dramatic about this dexa thing
1641720	1646440	it's not again it's not that big a deal would it have made would it have made a nine and a half
1646440	1650760	game of 10 probably I mean I don't know I don't know I don't even know if I'd say that all right
1650840	1656680	technical issues aside too but you know yeah well yeah I would say the internet issues and the uh
1656680	1662040	wild area like how it fucking chokes when you're online I would say those issues are a way bigger
1662040	1668200	deal than the dexa thing but anyway all right um let's move on so we're gonna move on past
1668200	1673160	pokemons and talk about how was your gaming week which I left off the sidebar tonight isn't that
1673160	1677320	convenient all right so I guess I'll back it up how was your gaming week folks what types of
1677320	1681800	video games have you been playing this week dark soccer why don't you start us off I didn't really
1681800	1687480	play a whole lot um just because I had to bake five batches of cookies on Tuesday night after
1687480	1692760	work the holidays were this week so you know I had to yeah I had to because they were for three
1692760	1699000	different events that I had obligated myself to um and then actually I know I take that back because
1699000	1705000	we did have a lot of virtual racing going on in my house on Wednesday night like they stayed up
1705000	1708840	for hours playing fucking virtual racing I'm like it's virtual racing I don't give a shit
1708840	1715480	and play a bunch of pinball and then um actually I did get to play the jersey jack pirates of the
1715480	1722520	caribbean on Thursday because we went to a friend's place for thanksgiving and I got to play that and
1722520	1729960	I got to play um a Jurassic Park the new Jurassic Park stern pinball and I played a little bit of
1729960	1734440	Star Trek because it was there um there's also a uh an iron maiden but I don't really care for the
1734440	1737640	iron maiden table I still really need to come over and play that Elvira table while you still
1737640	1742040	have it yeah I played Elvira and Alan needs to play it too it's his table Alan's the one that
1742040	1746440	messaged me he's like I had no idea about this I'm like I told Rob he's sleeping on the couch
1747000	1751560	you know virtual racing has just about enough polygons for the Tesla Cybertruck in there so
1751560	1756520	we have a story on that later actually but um I guess I did do some gaming I just I didn't play
1756520	1763080	Pokemon which I thought I would but I also played my usual phone shit and then then I got like the
1763160	1770280	plague and so I didn't play much played a lot of solitaire all right well I play solitaire every
1770280	1776120	day at work why not solitaire so it's one of those standby good classics it's like my brain
1776120	1784200	D I'm more of a mind sweeper kid but you know I look at it as the the the frying pan of my brain
1785320	1790120	solitaire is the deglazer for the font the fond the bottom of my pan
1790120	1795240	all right let's move on Loki how was your gaming week I don't know did the holidays get in the way
1795240	1801160	of your gaming I didn't really play a lot of the games during the holidays I played Minecraft Earth
1801160	1808920	a bit and very little Pokemon go that's pretty much it I've been mainly just trying to work on
1808920	1814200	my game so I've been working on the procedural level generation portion of it and I got I got
1814200	1820520	it pretty much done I'm just dialing it in now because I want it to look a certain way
1821240	1827320	and it's just deciding between like different settings so that I get it to be just how I want
1827320	1834440	it without because you know I had I had done it in a certain way where it was just like getting
1834440	1840360	ridiculously meandering everywhere I was like no not quite what I want so it's just dialing that in
1840360	1844440	right now and then once I get that done I have to find a way to traverse the room so that I can make
1845080	1849720	the doors one way in a certain way so that I don't get trapped in a dead end because there's
1849720	1855480	no backtracking in the game so yeah that's what I've been working on most of the time that's why
1855480	1861320	I did not play very many games and didn't really buy that many games either because you know it's
1861320	1868360	all the sales and everything I looked at stuff I don't think I bought anything all right maybe I
1868360	1874760	will I wanted to get beat saver but oddly enough that is not on sale most of the sales go through
1874760	1880280	tomorrow which is you know cyber monday so well I mean a lot of the big sellers they don't really
1880280	1884840	discount because they're so it's uh death stranding you know I was hoping there'd be a black friday
1884840	1889960	sale on it nope still too new there was no black friday sale anywhere on it so um and I'll get to
1889960	1893960	that here shortly but I ended up paying the full 60 bucks in order to be able to play it so whatever
1894520	1899480	I knew that was probably going to be the case but I thought maybe there'd be a discount who knows
1899480	1903240	all right anything else you want to talk about that's it all right let me talk about my gaming
1903240	1908520	week here a little bit so um unlike my co-hosts um probably because I didn't do a lot for the
1908520	1913480	holidays it's just myself Alan and my dad and we had a great thanksgiving dinner though but we go
1913480	1917560	out to eat because you don't want to eat what I'm going to cook and like nobody wants to cook so we
1917560	1922440	go out so thank you to the folks at restaurants that that stay open on thanksgiving so that folks
1922440	1926360	who you know don't really aren't going to cook a great dinner still have a place to eat and I
1926360	1931640	will say we went to a great place we went to the brazilian steakhouse out in roseville which uh so
1931640	1936440	we had the meat on the swords and what was cute was that for their um like you know how they have
1936440	1940520	the food the salad bar right yeah and usually they'll have a selection of hot foods there like
1940520	1945960	soups and things what they did is they replaced all the hot food with turkey mashed potatoes
1945960	1949480	cranberry I thought they had like the turkey on the swords too no they didn't have the turkey
1949480	1955000	on the swords turkey was over at the salad bar oh that's lame yeah so not quite the same but um
1955000	1959640	believe me there was no shortage of amazing meat I just felt bad for my dad because he kind of
1959640	1963240	filled up on all the traditional stuff but I think that's what he wanted he wanted to have more of the
1963240	1967240	traditional stuff so he didn't get to try because he was already full by the time all those stuff
1967240	1972680	where it's like Alan and myself were like let's let's split half a piece of turkey and a scoop of
1972680	1976840	mashed potatoes and then that was like all we ate and it was like let's not fill up bring on that
1976840	1981240	bacon that's that's what my wife always says she's like don't fill up on the garbage don't
1981240	1985160	fill up on the salad fill up on the meat it's what we're here for you're paying for the meat
1985160	1989480	you eat the meat he's absolutely right all right but so that was great so thanksgiving was great
1989480	1994680	but outside of that we didn't have a whole lot going on so I played like a shitload of games
1994680	2000440	honestly um I was out playing pokemon go since you brought that up uh a friend of mine took me out
2000440	2005800	who plays the game a lot and was trying to help me along with the team rocket stuff to get Giovanni
2005800	2011640	for this month for the shadow articuno I didn't get all the way there but I did purify 15 pokemon
2011640	2015880	and like I did a lot of those team rocket fights but then like if it hadn't been raining these past
2015880	2019640	couple days I probably would have finished it but the rain starting here kind of like you know you
2019640	2025240	don't want to go outside as much so I didn't end up finishing uh that up but um you know I made a
2025240	2029400	lot of I've done a lot more of those team rocket fights than I ever have since it started I probably
2029400	2034040	did like three times as many in the past three days I have since that whole thing started so
2034040	2041560	there's that um bonds 006 says I detest those damn tr fights so much yeah they're not my favorite
2041560	2047080	thing but you know my friend made a good point about it was that it kind of gives another thing
2047080	2053400	to do in the game like another reason to craft these pokemon a certain way and have other pokemon
2053400	2057560	have the spotlight that maybe were monopolizing in the gym battles so it's like you have this
2057560	2062520	other thing to kind of work for and do besides just oh I have to catch shinies or oh I have to
2062520	2067000	catch you know perfect hundred percent the ones that you get though the purified ones or when you
2067000	2070840	do purify them they're not very strong they're they're really not they're kind of hit and miss
2070840	2075640	like those articuno's are crappy now I would think what you do is you save them for a lucky trade and
2075640	2079640	then trade them but I'm told you can't trade purified pokemon I don't know if that's true or
2079640	2086040	not but I would think that's the way to get around the low IVs but I did I fought a Bulbasaur um over
2086040	2091560	at the park not by my house but the other one I fought a Bulbasaur and after I purified it it was
2091560	2098040	15 14 14 so I evolved at once to a Venusaur and then before I evolved I'm sorry I evolved at
2098040	2103080	once to Ivysaur and then before I hit the button to do it Venusaur I heard my friend in the back
2103080	2108280	of my mind say you don't want to evolve that yet because community day is coming up and all those
2108280	2112040	moves will come back and I was like oh shit that's right so I held off and I didn't evolve it all the
2112040	2117400	way to Venusaur so wait for community day so I have that purified pokemon that's high levels
2117400	2124280	that'll be fun so anyway um I also played um so this is fun I have a little bit of b-roll of this
2124280	2129400	oh yes b-roll yay b-roll so um unfortunately it's not going to be great for those of you guys in the
2129400	2134840	podcast uh so I apologize but I will talk through this here a little bit so um earlier today I took
2134840	2141480	a some b-roll of myself playing destiny 2 on google stadia so uh this is what you guys are
2141480	2145880	going to see watch now is I'm firing up google stadia and I kind of wanted to show you guys what
2145880	2150440	it looked like so like the process and uh the green screen effect was horrible I didn't have
2150440	2156120	a chance to tune it so just uh please especially as the the monitor my main monitor gets bright and
2156120	2161960	dark the green screen screws up more and more so um sorry about that so anyway uh how did I get
2161960	2167720	google stadia did I buy it no those buddy passes came out where you can give it to a friend and a
2167720	2172520	friend can get three months so our pal Bobby Blackwolf who's on before us here Sunday nights
2172520	2177800	at vog was a buddy and gave me his buddy pass so I could check out with google state so I could do
2177800	2183160	impressions here on the show just like he did his a little bit uh except and and Jason did a fabulous
2183160	2187160	job here on this show and him and Bobby both talked about samurai showdown so I was like
2187160	2191480	well I'll play the other game I don't I don't mind I mean I know not a lot of first-person shooters
2191480	2194920	people want to play but I don't mind destiny too I think it uh the destiny series is one of the
2194920	2200760	better uh first-person shooters so why not so you'll notice for those that are watching I'm
2200760	2205960	still trying to get into the game so spoiler alert it still takes a good two minutes to launch the
2205960	2212360	game now that's because I'm counting the time of you gotta wait for the game to load up stadia then
2212360	2216840	you gotta get to the start menu and then it does all the security checks after the start menu and
2216840	2220680	then you gotta pick what you want to do and then here in this phase I'm waiting for two other
2220680	2225160	people to join my fire team so I can go down and do this random thing I don't even I haven't even
2225160	2229480	been paying attention to the stories I've been playing um but I can go I'm waiting patiently so
2229480	2234280	I can go down uh on the fire team and go to the planet and uh do what I need to do it's like
2234280	2239000	Final Fantasy 11 all over again yeah waiting for group now quest buster in chat says wow I'm behind
2239000	2245080	on light levels the game starts you at 750 I have not played the game that much on stadia's but so I
2245080	2251560	started off with like um 750 so it was pretty pretty high when I started off so anyway uh how
2251560	2255400	did I like it how was the experience of playing on google stadia well I wanted you guys that are
2255400	2258760	on twitch to be able to see some of the visuals so you could kind of see what it looks like and
2258760	2265160	honestly I think the visuals look fine it looks like you're playing a youtube basically I mean
2265720	2272840	there is a notice because I actually bought destiny 2 um on battle net way back when when
2272840	2277800	they first launched on battle net I bought it there and I've been able to play that in 2k mode
2277800	2284840	on my monitor um and it looks really sharp when I'm playing it in 2k mode um so um I don't think
2284840	2291480	it quite looks that good uh the colors get just ever so slightly washed like when you probably
2291480	2296440	watch youtube's of your favorite game um online you probably notice there's a little bit of a
2296440	2300840	wash over the screen a little bit and that kind of holds true when I'm playing in stadia and again
2300840	2305000	I'm playing on a web browser I'm not playing on my television because the buddy pass didn't exactly
2305000	2310440	give me a uh chromecast or anything like that uh and as Bobby points out in chat remember Rob is
2310440	2315720	playing the 1080p version too and yes that's the other point is that I'm used to playing in 2k but
2315720	2320280	when you are playing destiny 2 in the browser you're actually only getting it at 1080p wait a
2320280	2326840	minute I thought stadia did 4k yeah me too but I guess developers have not yet enabled the 4k
2326840	2332680	streaming or they're not officially supporting 4k streaming at this time um so I'm not actually
2332680	2338520	playing it in 4k but when it comes to how much bandwidth am I actually using to play this the
2338520	2344360	answer ends up being and not that much it's not that bad because I'm uh in 1080p and you have to
2344360	2349800	remember that is further being downsized to the 720p that you guys are seeing in a smaller than
2349800	2355080	720p window here so it actually probably looks even better uh for you guys um that are watching
2355080	2360360	it on twitch right now um me being really bad at shooters but very satisfied that I shot that
2360360	2367240	rocket and blew that guy up so um now prince bright star asks the very important question
2367240	2374440	how is the lag and I'm gonna say that is where I was most impressed with stadia I didn't notice it
2374440	2380120	like you'll notice I'm just plunking away playing my first person shooter the only thing I'm getting
2380120	2385400	frustrated at is how bad my aim is I'm not actually frustrated at oh why am I shooting
2385400	2390680	that ship I have no idea anyway it has a health bar it can be damaged it has a health bar shoot
2390680	2398760	it out of the sky anyway um but yeah honestly like the lag pretty good like it's not noticeable
2398760	2405400	like I was able to successfully you know do what I needed to do while I was playing this um
2406280	2413080	so there's that uh and yeah I mean even though I kind of tease it for taking two minutes to launch
2413080	2418120	I realize that it is an online game and you know you have to find a party and so forth
2418120	2422040	so for the most part a lot of that is understandable I'm not having to wait for
2422040	2426760	it to install patches or anything like that I was able to just kind of get up and running
2426760	2432440	so what did I think of google stadia not too shabby honestly like as far as the technology
2432440	2437720	goes especially if I wanted to just keep playing in 1080p like this here's where I think google
2437720	2444680	stadia is going to run into a problem the I'm not it's a lot of it's to do with the pricing honestly
2444680	2450120	like I'm playing this because it's free for me for three months thanks to bobby having paid for
2450120	2454840	it uh and I'll probably try out those other games that are gonna be free as well but that's only a
2454840	2462440	handful of games I'm gonna have for 9.99 a month whereas in contrast xbox game pass has a ton of
2462440	2468360	stuff on it right now yes you have to download that stuff to your computer right now how much
2468360	2473160	exact how much longer is that going to be a thing as we get closer and closer to xcloud being a
2473160	2481080	reality so I kind of think google's implemented something you know technology that's pretty nice
2481720	2488040	um but I think microsoft's about to throw them under the bus in about a year uh that games pass
2488040	2493160	man that that's gonna really do it next gen I think even this generation but like it's a really
2494040	2502920	nice offer and I mean I keep looking at xbox ones I'm just like no I'm gonna buy the next one but
2503880	2510920	I don't know it's it's uh because I know with being in this generation uh mainly playstation
2510920	2515240	you know I have a huge library of games I got with playstation plus I don't feel so bad
2515240	2521160	losing out on that being that um I'll get it all back with games pass anyways so anyway that's me
2521160	2525640	playing uh destiny 2 on stadia so just wanted to I wanted to have a little bit of the visual for
2525640	2528920	those of you guys on twitch you can see like what does it look like what does it actually look like
2528920	2532440	when you boot up how does it go into the game so I wanted you guys to be able to see a little bit of
2532440	2537960	that I have something else to talk about that's a little bit unrelated sure why not just go ahead
2537960	2542760	and sum up I was um I don't know if there's a lot else to say on it it's again it's one of those
2542760	2547720	things where I think the technology is not I mean with as much as we're complaining about bandwidth
2547720	2552840	caps and all that stuff like if I'm still just streaming things at 1080p I don't know if that's
2552840	2557400	really going to become an issue for me I mean maybe I want to try some things in 4k later maybe
2557400	2562440	that is going to be an issue later on I'm not trying to deny that that is an issue but 1080p
2562440	2569240	is good enough just like a lot of 2k gaming for me is good enough right now and I'm enjoying it um
2569240	2574840	I think I think stadia has more of a struggle on its monetary structure it's kind of the same thing
2574840	2579960	Jason said last week it's more the the structure and and how they want you to pay for games when
2579960	2583400	you look at what some of the competition is doing and especially how they're positioning the chess
2583400	2588040	pieces like we're talking about with xbox that's where I fear for stadia but if stadia can put
2588040	2592840	together something real quick that can rival game pass in a way it might be more tempting anyway
2592840	2596600	before I get to my next game Jamie you had a different thought I just wanted to go ahead and
2596600	2604520	mention that today is also uh world aids day excuse me um and so I just wanted to make sure
2604520	2609960	that I put the mention out there for everybody just have the awareness of it and keep those
2609960	2615320	that we've lost in mind so that is an important note thank you for that and I think it's very
2615320	2618920	important everybody know their status and your sexuality has nothing to do with that everybody's
2618920	2624440	know their status everybody should know yeah so so um it's very very very easy to get tested
2624440	2630840	and uh you know in fact it's not the death sentence it once was if you catch it and treat
2630840	2636680	it there's ways to um you know uh basically suppress you know I mean not that we should
2636680	2641480	overlook it by any means but you know there's also this uh saying that undetectable is
2641480	2646520	untransmittable so if you get it treated and you can get down to levels where it's undetectable
2646520	2651720	in your system you still have a lot of options I will you know kind of leave that out there but
2651720	2656280	there's many many many ways you can kind of get treatment for that that weren't there when people
2656280	2660600	were first talking about this in a lot of the media and stuff in the 80s and 90s so definitely
2660600	2665240	look into your local resources check and see if you've got like an LGBT center in your town
2665720	2671400	look for you don't even need that I mean yes it is resources sure resources and you see if you've
2671400	2676360	got sisters in town you know sisters will always help you with resources and education but
2676360	2682760	definitely just make sure that you take care of yourself and it doesn't matter if you what gender
2682760	2690200	you identify with what your body is like who you like sleeping with or not at all if you've had
2690840	2697800	contact with and I'm not just gonna say you know coitus or anything like that but even if you've
2697800	2703960	had injections recently if you have to say you know if you've had a blood transfusion I know
2703960	2709480	the doctors are very careful with it but I mean that's how Ryan White got it in the 80s for a lot
2709480	2713880	of that is tested and different now it's different now there's no excuse you should know your status
2714440	2720600	exactly so so I'm saying you know I never take it for granted yeah so and one of the quick thing
2720600	2725480	I'll say it's really easy like when I go to my doctor and my doctor is like I want to do blood
2725480	2729320	because doctors want to do blood tests all the time right I go in I'm coughing too much let's
2729320	2734040	do a blood test and I'll usually ask if it's been you know six months since last time I'm gonna ask
2734040	2738920	I'm gonna say hey since I'm going to lab anyway can you throw in this HIV test as well the worst
2738920	2742360	I've ever gotten from the doctor response is do you have a reason to be concerned I'm like no I
2742360	2746280	just want to know my status okay that's that's it they're gonna throw it in they want you they
2746280	2751000	want you to do that test too so anyway good life lesson from dark soccer mixed in here with the
2751000	2757880	gaming stuff all right um other games though I will mention uh for my gaming week pokemon shield
2757880	2764040	so here's here's the update on pokemon shield I beat it that's right I got all eight gym badges
2764600	2770600	I fought uh the championship and I became the champion and I caught the um legendary uh
2771560	2776360	that is integrated in the story so I don't know how much I should say into that not the sword and
2776360	2781400	shield legendary that is the post game so that's the one that's at the beginning of the game yeah
2781400	2787320	the very very beginning of the game that is the post game legendary um so I have not yeah I have
2787320	2792040	not done the post game content yet I'm sure I'll get around to it at some point but then I got
2792040	2797640	derailed with another game that I'll talk about in a moment um but honestly you know I know we
2797640	2800920	were just kind of talking about pokemon the controversy and everything I really enjoyed
2800920	2806440	gen 8 I really really enjoyed gen 8 and I think some of the major differences for this I've never
2806440	2810520	beaten a mainline pokemon game before I've never gotten this far in a mainline pokemon game
2810520	2815000	shane was shook he might not show it because he's shane but he was shook definitely that I beat the
2815000	2821080	game um but uh here's some things that made this generation different number one getting to be able
2821080	2825480	to play it on my television versus being forced to do it on a handheld I think there's just something
2825480	2829560	about that experience I've always enjoyed gaming on the tv more being able to kind of plop on my
2829560	2835640	couch have the big screen and the sound bar and everything um that was really cool number two I
2835640	2842200	think the wild area was a pretty good change because I don't feel this need to grind every
2842200	2848440	pokemon that I miss on a route because I kind of know like a the pokedex shows you what you're
2848440	2853240	missing from a certain route so you know you can kind of always go back and get it later um and you
2853240	2857400	don't feel the need to like oh I gotta go check this online reference I used to do in some of the
2857400	2862200	older games and most of them are available in the wild area number three which I think is the
2862200	2869880	biggest one raiding dynamax rating changed it because now I don't have to grind battles over
2869880	2874680	and over and over again to raise the experience level of my pokemon if I do enough of those
2874680	2879480	dynamax raids you get candy from those raids and you feed the candy to your pokemon and the candy
2879480	2884840	levels them up and it's a great alternative to grinding and I think that was a huge part of it
2884840	2890280	and it's funny because I hear this game get a lot of shit because people go it's not as long as the
2890280	2896840	prior games well how many of those hours in pokemon blue were you fucking grinding on a certain route
2896840	2900440	over and over again to either catch this pokemon that only showed up five percent of the time
2900440	2904440	or to over level your pokemon so that way the next gym fight would not be that big of a deal
2905000	2910360	like so I kind of think there's that I'll need to consider when you're talking about the length
2910360	2916920	of the game is how much of the game was actually interesting sorry not sorry anyway that's a good
2916920	2922680	thing for pokemon gen 8 in my opinion and yeah I mean those are some of the big things I'm trying
2922680	2926120	to think what else I said when I wrote this post on twitter because somebody like directly asked
2926120	2930840	me the question why did this gen stick when the other gens didn't but those are some of the
2930840	2935720	biggest ones right there that you know just made this a lot of fun the end game did kind
2935720	2939880	of keep going and going like I thought I was ready to beat it and it's like no you have to go here
2939880	2943880	and there but I don't think that's a bad thing at all I mean you know because this game's gotten
2943880	2952920	crap for its story too I suppose I will say I saw a critique about how the game felt like you
2952920	2958920	weren't an active participant in the story that the story was kind of happening around you for
2958920	2965080	the most part and I will say I do see truth in that critique and I can see where that bothers
2965080	2969560	some people I don't think that's to say you don't actively participate at all no certainly there's
2969560	2974360	very important things that your character does in the game but I can get the sense that there's a
2974360	2980520	lot that happens that you don't see or you're not involved with that feels a little weird so I do
2980520	2985080	think that's a valid critique there but it didn't really bother me to the level that it's may bother
2985080	2993640	some other people in that so anyway Bobby in chat says not as long as a positive for me I'm
2993640	2998520	debating on getting it especially because it's not as long as it only has a subset of all Pokemans
2999480	3003560	it's it's a good one to start with I think there's a good reason why they put it on the switch
3003560	3010120	I think all the Pokemon will come back when they do probably a remake they'll probably do a remake
3010120	3017800	of gen four I don't where did they leave off I can't remember Pokemon Uber and Pokemon ultimate
3017800	3022760	there there is a part of me that wonders if they won't just do since everybody's whining if they
3022760	3028760	won't just do like a Pokemon ultimate that has every Pokemon today in it that's just a side
3028760	3033800	Pokemon world traveler yeah maybe something that takes you through all the regions but like an
3033800	3039240	abbreviated they should have a collection collect them all no like a collection like a few games in
3039240	3044760	one you know like a few generations and then just one continuous Pokedex that you can use between
3044760	3048840	them those are all great ideas so but I hope they'll never do any of them I hope there are
3048840	3053800	conveniences from this generation and quality of life improvements that they do look at implementing
3053800	3059400	um in any remake or future generation so uh Elliot B says I don't think I've gotten past the third
3059400	3065640	gym on any Pokemon games in Sapphire same uh I just get bored around the 10 hour mark same
3065640	3071240	but this time when I got bored I just went and did dynamax ratings uh and uh can you start off
3071240	3077160	with those because I've got those little pink areas to look yeah if you can see the pink areas
3077160	3082040	I would say once you get your Y-com which is before the first gym you can raid um you don't
3082040	3086360	want to necessarily jump in all the five stars but you can you can raid well the last thing that I
3086360	3094760	did was the um uh the the mines on the way to the first gym so I might do it after the first gym
3094760	3100120	yeah so after the first gym is a good time and honestly if you get the first gym the second gym
3100120	3105320	is just a hop skip and a jump over the first three gyms are all pretty easy to knock out
3105320	3111400	and then you kind of have a wait before you get to the fourth gym but anyway um so that is uh
3111400	3116600	that is my thought on Pokemon Gen 8 I think it's great um I think a lot of people who are talking
3116600	3121800	bad about it probably haven't played it yet that's not to say none of the criticisms are valid and
3121800	3127560	it's not a perfect game but it's pretty darn good and it made a great impression on me needs better
3127560	3132440	fashion sense I mean white shorts with white leggings no girl you do get to redress him
3132440	3138280	that's one of the first things terrible yeah I so is that your gaming week uh one more one more
3138280	3145480	okay so one more game I said it was a busy week sorry guys so one more game so um I went out
3145480	3150760	on Thanksgiving and yeah I was one of those people who went to Target on Thanksgiving but I did as
3150760	3157000	well I was really nice I didn't spend any money yeah so I I went and um you know what the reality
3157000	3161640	is like Alan and I were going stir crazy we were bored like we have nothing to do on this holiday
3161640	3165800	what do we like is anything open so we're like let's just let's just go to you need to play
3165800	3174280	ingress listen no no god I'm like over that anyway so like I was like let's drive to target if the
3174280	3179720	parking lot is a shit show then we'll just drive somewhere else we'll go on a drive uh but the
3179720	3183320	parking lot at Target wasn't that bad it was just like a really bad Saturday morning pretty much and
3183320	3188760	we went in and um there was a ton of people staffing and they had a system and it was fine
3188760	3192760	and I just was very polite I was asked to go stand to one line versus another and I'm just okay I
3192760	3197240	talked to the guy about video games so I just you know tried to you know if I'm going to be a monster
3197240	3202200	and shot the Thanksgiving then at least I can be a nice one um so anyway I got a copy of Death
3202200	3206840	Stranding that's the that's the point and so I've been playing Death Stranding I'm probably about
3206840	3213960	six hours into Death Stranding um or as I called it what did I say in that text message I sent to
3213960	3221480	um Shane I said Death Cake Stranding yes or in the opening of the show tonight let's see I said
3221480	3228120	Reedus's baby fetus no there's all of that too this might be the strangest game ever I'm carrying
3228120	3233560	a dead body on my back across these scenic landscapes constantly having to use l2 and r2
3233560	3240120	to shift weight while hipster music plays in the background yep girl learn to crouch and uh dark
3240120	3246600	Tetsuya says I still like Dark Souls of walking here's the that description is completely accurate
3246600	3251720	it really is the Dark Souls what do you do in the game you walk how do you know where to walk you
3251720	3257720	press r1 and it shows you where the dangerous terrain versus the non-dangerous terrain is
3257720	3261960	so you can kind of plot plot out carefully where am I going to walk and you do you have to adjust
3261960	3266520	your weight you have to l2 and r2 to kind of like grip the ground and one of the places where
3266520	3270600	I was really struggling was that there's these kind of like again I don't want to spoil story
3270600	3274200	too much but there's like these ghosty things that'll chase you and come after you and they're
3274200	3278520	trying to like basically kill you although well I don't want to spoil but they're basically trying
3278520	3284520	to kill you so um like I was getting really frustrated because the thing would go off the
3284520	3289560	baby would cry and it would say press r1 to hold your breath and so like okay I'm holding my breath
3289560	3293320	well the fuckers would still get me like every time and so I actually went to twitter and I
3293320	3297640	made a tweet I'm like what the hell am I doing wrong and somebody replied and said are you
3297640	3303480	crouching and I'm like oh oh yeah that's a thing it taught you in like the first 20 seconds of the
3303480	3310040	game isn't it but it never to my to my credit the game reminds you to hold your breath it never
3310040	3317160	reminds you again to crouch so I remembered then thanks to twitter to crouch and I was like okay
3317240	3322120	this is a lot easier but the thing about crouching is then you move even slower
3322120	3329320	so it's like you are slowly going through these landscapes and don't leave corpses behind
3329320	3334360	oh well no and that has explained you very much in the story in the beginning well yeah but people
3334360	3339400	still do that shit but you know how like the very first mission in the game is moving a corpse
3339400	3346120	that's where I was at so um but anyway wait till you get to carry live people oh god
3347240	3350280	why do I have to carry live people they have legs they can walk on their own
3351480	3358760	no you gotta carry them just like the dead yeah so anyway um but I don't know it's it's weird like
3358760	3364440	the story is very interesting it's very cinematic it's very well done I didn't realize that Lindsay
3364440	3369400	Wagner played that part that she played and then it was like oh this by the way Lindsay Wagner
3369400	3377080	and she voiced the oh the the the I know you can't yes the the other character will just say
3377080	3380440	like that I know there's so many like spoilery things I could say but I'm trying to be good
3380440	3387400	she voiced 1.0 and not 2.0 yes yes that is and she but she provided the likeness for 2.0 yes
3387400	3395400	okay so um anyway so um where was I oh Lindsay Wagner was on this television show in the 70s
3395400	3398920	called the bionic woman and the main character in the bionic woman was Jamie Summers
3399480	3403560	it said spelled differently spelled differently that's where I took my stage name from yeah
3404120	3410040	uh quest buster says most weapons are non-lethal for a very good reason yeah I noticed that when
3410040	3415480	I would tackle people you weren't killing them and that does make sense because the story explains
3415480	3420440	why dead bodies you won't leave them around um so you had to basically tie people up and that
3420440	3424440	was it you incapacitate people just leave them on the ground squirming because you have to do that
3424440	3429560	one of the early missions which would suck if an actual BT did come by for them yeah um but then
3429560	3435960	questmaster says most weapons are non-lethal okay but the weapons there are are pee pee poo poo
3435960	3442840	that's the weapons in the game are pee pee poo poo like and I was like this game is infatuated
3442840	3448360	with pee pee poo poo because there's this whole there's this whole thing like when you're like
3448360	3453240	you are sitting in your little dorm room or whatever spoiler to say that the main character
3453240	3460760	special yes the main character is special and uh has special pee pee poo poo and it can actually
3460760	3467240	and his blood you're making a face but it's true no no I'm I know but the it was actually to me
3467240	3473160	that was an interesting concept you know then they they rationalize it completely in their
3473160	3479720	own weird way why pee pee poo poo is effective yes you learn more though about him as a character
3480520	3490920	than the reason why his bodily fluids and excrement are powerful you see this is why this
3490920	3496680	is why they warn you that drinking too many monster energy drinks is a bad thing it does
3496680	3504280	eventually kill the undead so I mean game of the year contender death stranding is infatuated with
3504680	3511720	pee pee poo poo and it actually it tries to it rationalizes everything it rations this is why
3511720	3517960	I am obsessed with pee pee poo poo here's the whole my thing like if they're collecting blood
3517960	3526280	from him every time he stops to rest how much of his blood do they have like there are so many
3526280	3532520	depending on how often you rest in the game or how many days passed it's just although the there's
3532520	3539560	one have you had the dream sequence yet with uh with uh BB yeah a couple I don't know I don't
3539560	3545960	know if there's a particular one crashing through no the head butting no okay okay first of all I
3545960	3553240	absolutely love the bridge baby I don't I don't like BB I don't like the usage of a baby in that
3553240	3557320	and especially when they start explaining how like that was just really the still mother
3557960	3562520	yeah that's just that was a bit much for me I think it's the side of me that doesn't care
3562520	3568360	for horror films I was like do they do they really have to do this but I like bridge baby as you get
3568360	3575720	to know the bitch bridge the bitch baby did you really as long as you learn more about the bridge
3575720	3581560	baby as you go along so I really like the bridge baby as a character as a conduit to all these
3581560	3587000	other things that went on in the game yeah and I'm gonna leave that again like that again they
3587240	3593160	explain why a baby like they explain it all why pee pee poo poo they explain it everything is
3593160	3598280	logically baby pee pee poo poo no there's no baby pee pee poo poo it's pee pee poo poo and baby
3598280	3604920	because baby because bridge baby is still living in in bridge baby sack but anyway anyway did you
3604920	3612200	meet mama yet no because that's what I'm planning on is one of my cosplays next year okay is mama
3612280	3620200	well I've seen mom but mama oh oh yes I've met mama yes yeah oh you meet her in like the first
3620200	3623720	opening sequence of the game right but that's like I'm good I'm planning on cosplaying mama
3623720	3629400	and I'm trying to figure out how to do her um accessory interesting so anyway yeah and then
3629400	3633320	the one more I swear only one more thing I have to say about pee pee poo poo but since it's so
3633320	3638840	central to this game when you are in the dorm room and you press the button to make Norman Reedus
3638840	3645480	poop which I think is the x button which yes is a thing you can do push button push x to poop
3645480	3649400	and you push it and he gets in he gets at the end it doesn't it's not showing you anything nasty
3649400	3653960	it's one of those like screens it's it's not the south park you know game where there's like a
3653960	3659400	little mini game the at the poop no it's there's this screen that comes up with the frosted glass
3659400	3665320	so you can't see anything advertising some show there's a fucking advertisement for a real show
3665320	3672920	in it's Norman Reedus's actual show on AMC and I was like what Rob what what on earth is this
3672920	3678520	when he's sitting downstairs his crotch repeatedly I've you know I tried did you get punched I did
3678520	3683960	not get punched but he did the thing he's done a few weird things the thing that weirded me out
3683960	3688920	was after the press x to poop and then he got the frosted glass when he gets out he sits back down
3688920	3696520	he looks over at me and winks and I'm like why are you that are you Norman Reedus are you hitting
3696520	3701960	on me that's not the time to be hitting on me number one this is the crazy thing I never
3701960	3709800	thought he was attractive until this game seriously but no it's not until you see a man defecate
3709800	3714760	you truly no attraction pixel paka says I just pooped winked yeah that's kind of what it is
3714760	3720840	I pooped it's like in the silent earth for mst 3k did you make faces in the in the mirror
3721560	3725800	yes and do the selfies and stuff yes I did find that okay but just stare at his crotch
3725800	3732120	like he does different things if you stare at his crotch a lot yeah yeah I heard so anyway um so I
3732120	3737000	don't know so so then the the 50 million dollar question in chat swung tong asks should I say the
3737000	3747720	$60 question in chat uh is it worth $60 I don't know yet I I still have more to traverse in this
3747720	3753880	game before I truly know if it's worth 60 bucks I will say this for a I I think it is an excellent
3753880	3759240	fucking troll on behalf of Hideo Kojima I don't know if this was planned or not but there's all
3759240	3764440	these people on twitter that love to bash walking simulators right it's like walking simulators
3764440	3769880	aren't games they're just they're just this there's a story that plays out while you walk
3769880	3775160	and I feel like Hideo Kojima was like hmm walking simulator I'm gonna make the ultimate walking
3775160	3781080	simulator and that's what he's done he's made the ultimate walking simulator game and yet nobody's
3781080	3788120	complaining about it I will say this though I do think the way it incorporates the online is pretty
3788120	3792920	fucking clever like uh I don't know if you guys know this but you can actually kind of edit the
3792920	3798040	terrain so like not like dig holes and stuff but like let's say there's a particularly nasty part
3798040	3803000	of the river to cross you can build a ladder or even a bridge to help you cross the river
3803000	3809400	and other players will see that in their games and they can send likes which help you in your game
3809400	3815480	so that was kind of fascinating and lends itself to this very like in your face theme to the other
3815480	3822360	big question what the fuck is Death Stranding about the fact that we have a need to be connected
3822360	3828760	that is what Death Stranding is about and at least early in the game where my head is that from what
3828760	3833480	we have a need to be connected but if you're also looking at it from the perspectives of the people
3833480	3839000	that you need it could also be involved with the dangers of being too connected that's true it's
3839000	3845160	very End of Eva for me yeah have you seen End of Evangelion no of course not well shit yeah the
3845160	3853240	whole game just strikes me as I think that Kojima like got really drunk one night and watched End of
3853240	3858760	Evangelion on repeat and then decided to make a walking simulator out of End of Evangelion without
3858760	3867160	giant robots appropriate so much in common with the Evangelion mythos but I did think you know I
3867160	3874280	will say this from for for all the pee-pee poo-poo jokes for all the weird baby things that happen in
3874280	3879720	the game for all the Guillermo del Toro appearances except it's not really Guillermo del Toro doing
3879720	3884520	the voice somebody else no it's not him it's credited in the very beginning it's um yeah
3884520	3888520	it's the it's the voice of LeFou from the original Beauty and the Beast oh okay yeah I thought that
3888520	3895480	they said that it's his likeness but it's not his voice all right well at any rate um I like his
3895480	3899400	character oh yeah he has a he's a great character when he showed up so early I was like oh I thought
3899400	3905240	this guy just had a cameo but no he's he's plays a pretty big role in it yeah I like I really this
3905240	3911800	is one of the few games like this that I've truly liked all the characters except for like one of
3911800	3920760	the bad guys yeah but um because he was just nuts anyway but I even liked one of the other
3920760	3929640	reoccurring quote bad guys and I like I even like the big quote bad as well I do not like 1.0
3929640	3936200	version but I like 2.0 version I like the um the mule was that their name the guys with the gold
3936200	3941000	skull masks and the I think that's a really rad look and I think who also has a really rad look
3941000	3947640	is that guy who has like a black plastic mask on over his face oh die hard man yeah die hard man
3947640	3954920	I think he's got a really rad look he I'm still kind of of two minds about that character
3955800	3961480	but his actor did like one of my tweets that was cool oh that's cool um I love the look like yeah
3961480	3964920	I would say there's a lot to cosplay in this there really is he's actually a handsome fellow
3964920	3971880	by himself anyway I want Loki to cosplay um Sam Bridges Porter uh carrying 200 kilograms of cargo
3971960	3981640	because it's ridiculous but kind of awesome all right but no one of my favorite characters in
3981640	3987160	the game could be considered uh an antagonist hmm right we'll leave it at that there's more like
3987160	3991800	six hours in and I feel like there's still so much more to uncover but I will say the whole like we
3991800	3996040	are connected and the way so my point I was getting at for all the peepee poo for all the
3996040	4001080	baby stuff the the fact that the theme of the game is around connection and the need to be connected
4001080	4006600	to people and so forth or maybe not the fact that then he built this online component that
4006600	4016120	allows you to be connected in the process of playing this game I was like aha that is art
4018200	4020760	and that was my review of Death Stranding
4022840	4029320	what'd you think Loki are you gonna buy the game no I don't know I like I yeah I don't
4029320	4034200	know I think some people will love it and some people will hate it um that's and isn't that the
4034200	4040040	isn't that the great part about video games I don't know anyway but I I I would still though
4040040	4044600	I think that even though that's one of my favorite characters I'm actually gonna go and say that
4044600	4052040	both Mama and Lochna are probably my favorite I could see you cosplaying Mama yeah they're my
4052040	4056360	they're really my favorite characters in the whole thing yeah I like the concept between them
4057160	4062040	all right well let's move on uh let's talk about so we've only been here talking about our gaming
4062040	4065960	weeks for like an hour sorry that was mostly my bad but I like I said I played a lot this week
4065960	4071160	what can I say so we do have some video game news we want to get into um quickly some housekeeping
4071160	4077560	uh we should be here every week through uh December because um the holidays this time are
4077560	4081720	on weird days so they shouldn't interfere with our show the next show we will be gone will be
4082440	4087000	Martin Luther King weekend January 19th I believe it is so here's the thing and you guys actually
4087000	4090920	don't know this you're finding this out for the first time uh Allen bought us an anniversary gift
4090920	4095720	today so we're going because January 19th actually happens to be our anniversary so we are going to
4095720	4101880	see um Dear Evan Hansen that night here um because um I was kind of complaining about wanting to see
4101880	4105880	it on Broadway I was like oh I want to see that so he made it happen so we're gonna go see that
4106600	4110440	that's Disneyland week for me well oh that's right you weren't gonna be here anyway right
4110440	4114280	well no I would have been because we don't leave until that Monday but all right well
4114280	4118200	but it's gonna be Disneyland week for packing for Disneyland week so all right yes exactly
4119160	4122920	all right what do you wanna say something before we get into this I'm not doing anything special
4122920	4128840	but do a stream well I might well if my computer would stop shutting down every five seconds
4128840	4132760	remember I'm still trying to get my computer or not being a shithole oh yeah there is that
4132760	4136840	because I've been needing to work on a website and do logo work every time I open my fucking
4136840	4143240	photoshop to do to piece more on our logo my computer shuts down so I think I'd need to
4143240	4149320	actually replace all the ram in my system and maybe update my bios I don't know but it's it's a
4149320	4155080	pain in the ass um but I did have just a small little thing that good that happened to me that
4155080	4159800	I just found out about yeah I told you when I got in okay so that podcast that I really like called
4159800	4163880	uh stuff mom never told you you know one of my letters got right out and we got some shout outs
4163880	4170120	for the show I got another shout out on that podcast for Muppet Babies when are you guessing
4171080	4176600	I don't know if I'd go to Atlanta and volunteer just because I think that uh you need to go to
4176600	4181000	Atlanta for Dragon Con and then do they go to Dragon Con maybe I've met them yeah Annie goes
4181000	4184520	to Dragon Con I've probably met them and I didn't even know who they were I don't think Samantha
4184520	4188680	Samantha doesn't cosplay but um because I think this Dragon Con was her first one from listening
4188680	4193960	to the show okay but um Annie does cosplay she does a Winter Soldier cosplay Bobby do I know
4193960	4201640	these people but in any Bobby does Atlanta better than I do but at any rate um I I've I would
4201640	4207080	actually I mean I don't know if they're listening they said they'd check us out but if I would love
4207080	4211720	to guest on their show and just talk about video games and women in podcasting they the one I'm
4211720	4215880	listening to right now is their episode on fan girls but they've done some great ones about
4215880	4221160	toxic fandom gatekeeping all kinds of things I totally would say check out the one the fandom
4221160	4225720	specific podcast of theirs uh Bobby says I have to see him I'm terrible with names Bobby's like me
4225720	4229160	like I'm so visual like you could tell me about a person I'm like I what do they look like what's
4229160	4234600	her face like and then I'd be like oh sure I've met this person um anyway uh it's horrible for
4234600	4240760	a podcaster I know uh I just tagged the both of them in one of my last tweets so sweet um one
4240760	4244600	thing I want to ask real quick what was the Muppet Babies thing before we get into okay so they were
4244600	4249960	they did an episode about puppetry and women in puppetry and so um Samantha was talking about
4249960	4254360	Muppet Babies and they got on a little tangent about Muppet Babies and you know are they like
4254360	4258840	there's the reboot of them and I happen to be at Target literally after listening to this podcast
4259480	4264680	and I saw Muppet Babies toys so I just snapped it and put it on Twitter said hey Samantha look
4264680	4269960	what I found and so she replied back like yeah I remember when Muppet Babies were first in the
4269960	4274680	Muppets Take Manhattan because not everyone knows that that's the origin of Muppet Babies
4274680	4281960	and so she mentioned it on the podcast I was like hey my my trivial knowledge is not as
4281960	4286920	trivial you can be hosting your own damn thing for 800 episodes and it's still fun to get mentioned
4286920	4292440	on a podcast that you like and respect you know yeah it's still fun I still remember when you were
4292440	4298360	on Greg Proops' podcast yeah a few years ago and he went off on my question yeah you were in a good
4298360	4302600	way in a good way yeah um this was and he's still doing that show right yeah I haven't
4302600	4308440	listened a while we went to the punch line here and I was absolutely just and he actually signed
4308440	4313080	the back of his show notes for me and gave it to me and it's framed somewhere in my house he just
4313080	4317480	told me to keep being awesome I was like that's pretty cool because I asked him if we were heading
4317480	4323800	for a repeat of the French Revolution or the Bolshevik Revolution because of the way our
4323800	4328760	economy and society is moving and that he just went off on that one and it was beautiful.
4329880	4335880	Swongtong in chat says I'm pretty sure I met Rob but was too scared to say hi years ago at PAX lol
4335880	4341640	I'm bummed to hear that I wish you had said hi but let me let me tell you like a secret so if
4341640	4348600	I seem like I'm really like in a zone or like off-putish or something like that when you see
4348600	4354280	me in person or whatever I seem like I'm I'm in doing something else or whatever like trust I am
4354280	4361080	just as nervous as you are like that's some tea so just you know especially at PAX it had to have
4361080	4364600	been packed I can't believe I wouldn't believe this was PAX08 in Seattle because we were all
4364600	4369480	there so it would have been one of the PAX East that they're referring to and so those shows to
4369480	4375160	me were like I was in a town I'm not that familiar with I was at a show that I didn't really have an
4375160	4381400	agenda for because especially the most recent packs they like well what the fuck ever obviously
4381400	4386120	say it I think Bobby said it on his show too they fucking invited us to do a panel then said never
4386120	4389880	mind we don't want you to do the panel because we got bigger names to do the panel essentially
4389880	4393800	that's the message that I was heard so I was kind of like in that one of those moods where I was
4393800	4397880	like I don't even know what I'm doing at this con except oh I'm having a good time being here with
4397880	4401960	Bobby and running into some of the people I do know back here but I had like no agenda or things
4401960	4406680	to do there so I was just probably like kind of like off of my own little zone or whatever so um
4407240	4415000	yeah please say hi I promise I don't bite unless um consent is given uh sg100 matt says rob's a
4415000	4421480	pretty cool and fun guy in person thank you for that I appreciate that so all right anyway uh
4421480	4425400	Bobby says they invited us to be on a panel then they took the panel off the schedule then we
4425400	4430280	applied as media and they declined us so we had to bypass this from a listener true true and true
4430280	4434680	and the only thing that I added is that that they took the panel off the schedule to replace
4434680	4441160	it with one with bigger people that's what it was anyway anyhow let's move on we have other
4441160	4448520	gaming news to talk about Loki's gonna start us off yes and so we've got apparently dev p
4448520	4455400	a playstation 5 death kits spotted in the wild so there is a photo that leaked out to the internet
4455400	4459000	of apparently two of the playstation 5 dev kits and we know these are
4459560	4466120	allegedly playstation 5 dev kits based on the filing that we saw with um you know a story on
4466120	4471560	that a few weeks ago yeah the patent office and it looked fucking weird they are like this weird
4471560	4477640	v-shaped system uh with all these vent holes and stuff on it and yep that's what it looks like
4477640	4484760	some weird v-shaped system with a bunch of vent holes in it so I don't know I mean that doesn't
4484760	4488920	necessarily mean that that's what the final system is gonna look like but at least we have
4488920	4495240	an idea of here's what the dev kit looks like and that they're out there um I hope the final system
4495240	4500760	doesn't look like that but it's an odd shape I don't really understand the the purpose behind
4500760	4506120	all the vent holes and the way it looks it's I don't know it almost looks like something you
4506120	4510520	would see like you know someone trying to kick start their own like game console or something
4510520	4514360	like the phantom system or something like that I'm trying not to read too much into it because
4514360	4520360	it is a dev kit and I highly doubt this with the actual no it's not sleek looking at all so um a
4520360	4524920	logical uh conclusion in our chat from prince bright star who says it'll help with airflow
4524920	4529000	if people try to stack things on top of it that could be like if you had these units kind of
4529000	4532520	stacked on top of each other if you're trying to test something like multiplayer but I mean
4532520	4536920	I I can't imagine that this is the final thing since I mean that thing is thick remember when
4536920	4543800	we were looking at the original xbox one and it was everyone kept comparing it to like a vcr I
4543800	4550600	mean this thing is huge it's super thick so I don't know I think it's just one of those this
4550600	4556440	is funky because it's not like a vcr looking thing or it's not a big box it's a very distinct
4556440	4562760	kind of shape u shape where the airflow is all around in that u um and it's it's just it's a
4562760	4566520	little weird and I think that image is jarring and kind of like what you said what makes this
4566520	4571960	newsworthy is that here we go we have a reddit post that basically confirms those you know what
4571960	4576680	we saw on the patent site some time ago so this appears to be the real deal now granted
4577880	4582760	we know fake news is out there we know it would be easy to fake these things because I'm almost
4582760	4587800	positive we've had fake system pictures before right and people fake them so you should take
4587800	4593480	this with a grain of salt as you should everything but on the other hand this is a dev kit and nobody
4593480	4597880	should be putting that much stock in what this thing looks like anyway yeah the playstation to
4597880	4603800	fake this is like you're playing yourself the playstation 4 dev kit anyways didn't look anything
4603800	4609640	like the playstation 4 when it finally launched anyways so it doesn't necessarily mean it's gonna
4609640	4615240	look like this it would be weird though if it is so I don't know yeah I guess we'll find out later
4615240	4619560	on yeah we will um and it'll be interesting too the repercussions how did an image like this even
4619560	4623160	get out like you know we had all those talks with ndas and I don't know if you read through the
4623160	4627480	comments but which I know you're not supposed to do but oops I did it I was doing some investigative
4627480	4631880	journalism and I went through the comments and some of the popular theories is that it was
4631880	4637480	possibly a cleaning crew that took the picture even though cleaning crews would still have to
4637480	4644120	sign ndas of their own you know I was kind of thinking well right now it's the holidays and
4644120	4650600	a lot of the usual people probably are not there so you probably have like other people in and they
4650600	4655560	may have signed ndas but maybe they're not as used to seeing this type of stuff or working with this
4656120	4663080	so I don't know my my tinfoil hat is that you had some type of holiday crew in there that was
4663080	4667960	not as familiar with the ins and outs so when they saw it they did something that they should
4667960	4672600	probably know they're not supposed to do but they haven't been tested with that before and so that's
4672600	4677160	where we're at because yeah um somebody else pointed out you can if you were to do some
4677160	4680360	photoshop fucking around you'd be able to see the reflection of the person in that tv
4680360	4685160	that's in maybe as well these have a pretty good idea what they look like
4688360	4693080	I mean you can sort of see a shadow of a person but like I don't know if there's enough light to
4693080	4698120	actually yeah do anything with that yeah uh dark to see who says you know like the lead up to the
4698120	4702760	switch reveal oh yeah there were so many fakes then well remember when the nintendo revolution
4702760	4706840	was going to project holograms on your wall like that was the legit story which I remember that
4706840	4710680	was the story we talked about on this show I still think that was actually kind of a rad
4710680	4716280	concept or the the one that nintendo on that was like supposed to go on your head or something
4716280	4721320	that is like vr um and then there was the xbox light room but I think that really was that no
4721320	4725720	that is a thing the light room is they never did it they never pushed no that that was actually
4725720	4731080	through microsoft that that that wasn't like a rumor thing that was a luma room was remembered
4731080	4737960	they were showing a luma room light room yeah that's that's an adobe product yeah well what
4737960	4742920	better to talk about more rumors might as well hey you know what y'all it was a slower week because
4742920	4748600	the holidays so rumors and this show isn't just about reporting game news it's about talk about
4748600	4753400	talking about news and sometimes these big rumors are the things that people are talking about
4755320	4759080	especially when you consider the source of this rumor the source of this rumor is on twitter
4759080	4764760	leaky pandy um because this particular leaker has been right about other nintendo directs in
4764760	4769720	the past so this is a leaker with a with a with a resume basically so the tweet says
4770920	4776680	excuse me guys sorry for all the coughing noises and stuff but things happen um leaky
4776680	4783000	pandy says nintendo is planning two new metroid titles that will release in the next two fiscal
4783000	4789800	years respectively one is a re-release of metroid prime trilogy hd the second one is a
4789800	4797640	super metroid remake that mimics samus returns in style and scope well because i love me some super
4797640	4803560	metroid that second part i mean the first part kind of strikes me as a of course that has to
4803560	4809560	happen at some point it would be weird for them to come out and announce metroid prime 4 when we
4809560	4815400	haven't had a metroid prime game to reference in quite some time and granted we haven't even had a
4815400	4823080	metroid game to reference save for that 3ds relaunch remake or whatever in quite some time
4823080	4828360	so i i kind of feel like nintendo kind of has to do something to like remind us about metroid or
4828360	4832680	or put metroid back out there and make it current again so i feel like something especially like a
4832680	4838920	metroid prime hd or whatever remake collection it's it's got to be a legit you know they're
4838920	4843320	gonna want to have something that kind of leads right into four so that makes a lot of sense
4843320	4847160	the part about super metroid that's the part where i go okay now that's a little different
4847160	4853160	though that part i wasn't expecting yeah and although i i'm not i'm like you can't touch
4853160	4859320	greatness at the same time greatness is already available to play on the switch it's in the super
4859320	4864040	nintendo library you can go in and play super metroid assuming you have nintendo switch online
4864040	4870520	which i imagine many of you do um so it would be weird of them to just like re-release super
4870520	4875720	metroid if they don't make some pretty significant changes to it so i think a super metroid with
4875720	4881800	changes in the style of you know samus returns on the 3ds i i think is going to be different
4881800	4886440	enough where i don't think i will necessarily have to have this live in the shadow of the original
4886440	4891720	i'll be curious what they do with it if it's true you know and there is that big if that goes with
4891720	4898920	it what do you guys think it'd be cool to see them do like kind of what they did with was a
4898920	4903800	zero mission or you know something like that where they had kind of the extended super metroid thing
4903800	4907880	oh yeah like with the the more extended end and really the map was a little different too they
4907880	4912680	made some very subtle changes that kind of changed everything yeah um prince bright star in chat says
4912680	4916440	i have to wonder if that second release might support randomization which has become pretty
4916440	4920360	popular in the metroid and zelda communities you know i brought this up last week or the week
4920360	4924840	before about metroid maker how i was kind of getting into those made one of those ones like
4924840	4929960	randomizer type of things um i i would think it would be a beautiful thing for nintendo to
4929960	4936680	embrace that to an extent um you know i don't know why nintendo won't be willing to put their name on
4936680	4940760	it i mean i guess they feel it has to be of a certain quality and sometimes you can get certain
4940760	4945800	seeds that aren't great quality but i i kind of think nintendo really ought to try chancing it
4945800	4951480	especially with their classic nes library of just i mean sniping a zelda randomizer essentially
4951480	4954920	i mean it's for their game anyway and making it their own where you can generate seeds play
4954920	4959080	against other people online do your own speed runs like i i'm not sure why nintendo doesn't
4959080	4964280	try to embrace this a little more i mean maybe they just are okay with it happening organically
4964280	4969400	because you'll notice as far as i know they haven't ceased and desisted any of the randomizers right
4969400	4974920	which is kind of surprising they've just i mean the randomizers don't you have to have your own
4974920	4980840	rom so like the randomizers are in an interesting legal area in that regard they're not exactly as
4980840	4985560	touchable um but i'm still surprised nintendo's like not never tried to go after them so there
4985560	4992840	must be some benefit they're seeing to it i don't know so anyway uh it would be very curious to see
4992840	4998840	if this uh all ends up being true about uh the metroid and you know if they really did reboot
4998840	5003720	metroid prime 4 earlier this year then we've still got a couple years to go before that game
5003720	5009480	is out so i think if this buys us more time and creates more of an awareness or whatever you want
5009480	5016920	to say on hold another hardware by the time that game comes out um maybe i mean because it depends
5016920	5021160	if you want to believe there's going to be a switch pro or a switch plus oh isn't that supposed to
5021160	5028040	happen next year allegedly allegedly so we'll see we got switch light so we've already had the switch
5028040	5032120	minus although some people would say they love the switch light because they do mostly handheld
5032120	5036680	gaming and it is a nice looking thing especially if you have like some of the artistic clam shells
5036680	5041320	and stuff is a pretty nice looking device so um some people would say the switch light is not
5041320	5046520	necessarily a downgrade although um you know from the pure technical perspective of the fact that it
5046520	5052200	doesn't dock it is but that's okay they're charging you less for it so all right well moving on we do
5052200	5058520	have some more news for you guys dark sakura well now i will go ahead and before i even go into this
5058600	5064040	i will preface it saying that metacritic can be a little bit questionable um you know it's been
5064040	5070520	used to to hurt games it's been used to hurt people uh who are fans of games so with that
5070520	5081480	being said um metacritic published uh the 15 highest rated games of 2019 uh with exclusion
5081480	5090360	of certain ports um as so to go from the list the top two number one is resident evil 2 with
5090360	5098840	a score of 93 second is uh second uh shadows die twice followed by final fantasy 14 shadow bringers
5098840	5105400	rob i think you'd be happy with that um monster hunter world and disco Elysium which i'll be
5105400	5111560	honest i've never fucking heard of have you heard of disco Elysium yeah i haven't i'd have
5111560	5116120	to see a screenshot again the visual thing right that is really cool about shadow bringers though
5116120	5123160	um yeah number three yeah um after that is f1 2019 then devil may cry 5 fire emblem three houses
5123720	5130200	slay the spire apex legend as regards wrath super mario maker 2 with a score of 88 baba is you
5130200	5136680	the legend of zelda links awakening and astral chain so but the top three then being resident
5136680	5143640	evil 2 sekiro and uh final fantasy 14 just with final fantasy 14 is just seeing how much that
5143640	5151320	game came back from the garbage it was before they fixed the things i'd say that's pretty impressive
5151880	5157960	yeah and honestly the recent expansion is is stunning and um you know a lot of people
5158840	5163320	are missing out i think um though square enix is an interesting predicament where they need
5163320	5168280	a better catch-up system like so that people can just jump right in to the expansion i mean you can
5168280	5172120	buy like a potion that lets you story skip and level skip and all this stuff but like i don't
5172120	5175960	know you shouldn't have to buy that at the same time um they might want to consider giving one
5175960	5181640	away like they do with world of warcraft or um i i have heard the developers say they are working
5181640	5185800	on the story problem but it probably won't anything won't be in about that until the next
5185800	5190200	expansion so we'll see yeah and prince bright star says in chat they're redoing the 2.0 story
5190200	5195480	yeah i have heard that that they're gonna kind of redo that so um we'll see but anyway all that
5195480	5201080	aside uh shadowbringers is is excellent um kind of surprised to see it so high with all the other
5201080	5205800	games that have come out this year honestly so that is kind of an interesting treat if again you
5205800	5211000	put stock in what metacritic has to say having the resident evil 2 remake though at the very top of
5211000	5215240	it just seems a little bit questionable to me i mean it's really good please don't get me wrong
5215240	5219800	i think it's very well done it definitely improves on the original and ads i think it
5219800	5226120	actually changes some of the dynamics for the characters in the game um but it is a remake and
5226120	5233080	it is a fairly quick play so Sekiro has a much higher challenge level and it's actually about to
5233880	5240040	match i think the highest of the dark souls games um for its overall revenue um
5241000	5247480	but i am pretty happy to see those as the top three not super surprised yeah interesting of
5247480	5253000	those three i don't believe resident evil 2 is a game of the year nominee but Sekiro certainly was
5253000	5257720	and i think it was very pretty one of you guys said that one hard as fuck has a real shot at
5257720	5263240	maybe winning so we'll see what happens i think Sekiro absolutely does have a shot i mean it's
5263240	5269560	it's involved it's in depth it's hard as shit the challenge is real um but it's also got a
5269640	5275880	pretty good story and quite the amazing like introductory uh bit of uh that's what i'm
5275880	5283160	thinking of bit of the game uh prologue uh yeah opening chapter opening but i think that that it
5283160	5288200	definitely deserves to be on the list all right do and let me ask let me ask this follow-up question
5288200	5293080	how much stock do you put in what metacritic has to say and we'll throw rotten tomatoes in that you
5293080	5298840	know all those uh meta review type of sites i'm asking those in the room and over in our chat room
5298840	5305880	at twitch tv slash vog network my view of it is sort of a generic litmus test of what people
5305880	5314360	are going to think but again it's been quote weaponized as far as damaging certain material
5314360	5320840	that's come out especially the uh the little incels out there like to use it to damage
5320840	5327240	games with a strong female protagonist or things that try to that might challenge their little
5327240	5332520	male-dominated view on things we've seen it happen before those are user reviews though and
5332520	5338120	i always throw those out i especially on those sites i do not pay attention really i thought
5338120	5342600	there were just critic scores maybe i'm thinking rotten tomatoes i don't know but um well some of
5342600	5349320	the other ones out there so i don't really put the stock in reviews unless it's some like if i'm
5349320	5357160	watching like say a a webcast that i like like something like um game sack i really i dude just
5357160	5363480	did a review of shanmu 3 and i thought that his review sounded pretty good it was about what i
5363480	5369320	expected of the game and i've trusted his opinion in regards to sega and you know former sega
5369320	5377400	franchises and things like that so um i trusted his opinion but it's getting a generic score when
5377400	5382840	it's going all the way across the board from people who may not necessarily be the gamer that
5382840	5390760	i am i may look at the score and then go look for reviews but for most of the case i'm gonna form my
5390760	5396760	own opinion on it the the numbers are in the end just numbers they're not going to speak to my
5396760	5402760	personal enjoyment of something granted i greatly enjoyed resident evil too it was really really
5402760	5409400	good i made dan take me in my pajamas to target to go get it and we had a great time with it
5409960	5414440	um there's other games on that list that i thought were really great like you know mario maker 2
5414440	5421800	and you know uh links awakening of course being on that list uh but overall i mean really i think
5421800	5428680	that the scores shouldn't be oh all these people thought it was great i should get it to no this
5428680	5433400	is why i miss game rentals outside of the red box i miss going to like a blockbuster or something
5433400	5439080	and renting the game and talking to the employees who might have also tried out said game and just
5439080	5446120	getting like an in-person thing i miss you know game stop is okay for that now i missed going into
5446120	5450600	some of the stores like that and having those talks with people i like to see what my friends
5450600	5454920	in the real world thinks like one of my friends crystal um you know there was a game i was super
5454920	5461160	excited about and they were all hey you know i don't this has just been getting pooped on by
5461160	5466600	this this and this and everyone says this about it and i'm like but they're not my opinion i want
5466600	5473080	to try it and see what i think yeah or people be like oh all these people think this movie is crap
5473080	5478200	and blah blah blah but i like xanadu yeah no it's kind of like it's kind of like i was joking or not
5478200	5481960	joking but talking about the walking simulators earlier and like a lot of people shit on things
5481960	5485640	like everybody's gone to the rapture because they say great there's not a game there but i'm like no
5485640	5489320	i fucking love that was one of my favorite things i played all year you know so there was a goal to
5489320	5493320	accomplish what makes that not a game yeah so there was there was something i enjoyed there
5493880	5499080	animal crossing doesn't have a game that you win there's more to do after you pay off your mortgage
5499080	5507240	right so but what's to say that that's not a game yeah you know what's to say that you know
5507240	5513720	reading a book and then playing a narrative game it's the difference between that you've read
5513720	5518920	something versus the fact that you have observed something let me quickly ask loki what do you what
5518920	5524760	is your stock in metacritic um i mean sometimes i'll kind of look at it just to get a general idea
5524760	5530200	of what a game's being reviewed as so like if i see some negative reviews in like like for death
5530200	5534040	strand or something like that where people are just hating on it i'll kind of look at general
5535000	5541000	consensus to see is everybody share that opinion does you know is only a couple of critics that
5541000	5547160	don't like it um stuff like that but usually like i have certain people that i will listen
5547160	5554520	to for their critiques on stuff because they have similar tastes than i do so um yeah i i will look
5554520	5559640	at maybe the broad stroke on metacritic like if something is reviewing particularly strongly or
5559720	5565720	particularly negatively that wasn't what i was expecting or you know wasn't on my radar i might
5565720	5570440	kind of look like oh what's what's this noise all about and maybe look a little more into that but
5570440	5574600	i think for some of those reasons the dark soccer kind of outlined that i just jumped on with that
5574600	5579960	you know what one just what a critic's perception of the game might not be my own i think for me
5579960	5584600	i put much more stock in things like twitch streams where i can kind of really watch people
5584600	5588600	play the game youtubes would be something like that as well but i like the live nature twitch
5588600	5596200	and all that so uh yep uh let's see some uh comments in our chat sg100 matt says comment
5596200	5601000	sections and game reviews is the reason i stopped reading the comments and game articles honestly
5601000	5607000	are you missing anything though no so good for you stopping uh metal mayhem says i never pay
5607000	5610840	attention to metacritic if anything i pay attention to what people on my miscellaneous
5610840	5617880	friends lists are playing good call um and bonds 006 says i don't care one damn what they have to
5617880	5623000	say in reviews if it's a review about a huge breaking feature of a game then yeah beyond that
5624120	5629640	so yep all right some good thoughts from you guys in our chat room over at twitch tv slash
5629640	5636120	vog network meanwhile let's move on to what's next on our list loki so yes unfortunately 2k
5636120	5643880	is going to be shutting um down or i should say gearbox is shutting down um battle born so they
5643880	5649000	stopped doing updates quite a while ago almost two years ago and now uh basically 2k said as
5649000	5655160	of january 2021 the battleborn servers are going to be deactivated cue the cynic in me that says
5655160	5662600	it was still open um right but you know one of the things if you do buy a game like this that is
5662600	5668280	only online it is now either your copy that you have is completely useless although to be fair
5668280	5674040	it is free to play now so that's not such a big deal but it still kind of sucks if you did end up
5674040	5678520	purchasing it at one point or another didn't one of these articles or one of the talk about it
5678520	5682840	talk about how like wow what's that steam website people use steam spy or something like that yes
5682840	5687480	and i did look at the steam spy numbers and yes all 12 of you that are playing the game right now
5687480	5692280	or you actually have it up right now so 12 p even in spite of this news that it's closing soon that's
5692280	5697080	been everywhere it has gone up so like so the average number of players is about 12.6 for the
5697080	5704280	last 30 days peak being 42 players okay okay so but that's in the world in the world at one time
5704280	5711240	yeah that's and and by contrast name and is there any literally any other recognized game that you
5711240	5716120	could give us for con context like uh versus battleborn like dota how many people are playing
5716120	5722280	dota 2 let's see i'm just trying to think uh i was gonna say totally accurate battle simulator
5722280	5728840	um not battle simulator uh totally accurate uh battle royale simulating spy won't show you
5728840	5735080	things like fortnite and um you know blizzard based games like overwatch and things like that
5735080	5743640	so you have to bring up something like dota or um uh what about oh paladins is that on steam uh
5744760	5750440	yeah i think paladins how many people are playing paladins compared to battleboard hold on i was
5750440	5754200	just gonna pick this one because this is an indie game and i know it's pretty um
5756840	5761960	no they don't have okay let's see paladins we're just trying to get a comparison here so 42 people
5761960	5767880	at its peak we're playing battleborn this month all right we don't know i i don't like this let's
5767880	5776520	yeah let's try this here we go so like if you want to go down like something that like for example
5776520	5784840	dota 2 would have uh 314 000 concurrent players yeah um okay here's a much older game terraria
5784840	5793800	has 40 000 um concurrent wow terraria wow yeah okay um okay so 42 not that impressive of a
5793800	5797720	numbers that's sad and again we're not trying to like kick kick a horse when it's already down or
5797720	5801800	whatever i mean that's unfortunate and some of you guys are hitting the nail on the head in chat
5801800	5807160	um tiger class says ever since overwatch came out games like that were like it were struggling
5807160	5811880	ironically paladins though seems to still be kicking along and you know since i named that
5811880	5816280	one and bobby says hi rez and atlanta represent yeah but i've actually played paladins it's you
5816280	5821160	know it's a similar concept although they do different things as here i'm trying to go down
5821160	5831000	the list to get down to like some of the um lower doom 2329 like which doom the doom the original
5831000	5837000	do oh the original not even the 2017 remake or whatever i well it just says doom i don't know
5837000	5844920	if this is the uh remake one or not um because it doesn't really give me anything uh uh this might
5844920	5850200	be the remake actually i can't i can't really tell all right quest buster says it doesn't help
5850760	5855480	since uh that overwatch released a few weeks after battle born no it certainly doesn't
5856440	5861000	so all of that certainly comes into play so i was trying to find something that was like
5861000	5868280	really ridiculous um to compare it to that with just kind of go hey see you know this game is
5868280	5877720	kind of garbage and i don't know all right well moving on let's uh talk about xbox scarlets and
5877720	5884680	the oh here you go this i'm sorry i'm sorry this is the perfect example uno has 1075 players
5885080	5891720	concurrently versus yeah the 12 all right we we get the point we get it all right moving on let's
5891720	5897720	talk about what the future might hold for project scarlet which is the name of xboxes or microsoft's
5897720	5904760	next system uh there was an interview with games radar where uh the uh head of xbox game studios
5904760	5910760	gentleman named matt booty uh talks about the plans for scarlet's first party support uh saying
5910760	5916040	we feel really good heading into 2020 we've got a goal of being able to deliver a game
5916040	5921960	roughly every three to four months so that's kind of an interesting and honestly is anyone
5921960	5926360	surprised after hearing how many studios yeah i was gonna say with all those studios i mean that's
5926360	5930200	like surprising again i've been saying this i've been saying this for like a year and a half ever
5930200	5938040	since that news came out microsoft has been laying the chess pieces under phil spencer's direction to
5938040	5945240	not let their next console go like how xbox one's launch did and i am really here for it because
5945240	5948840	i think this type of competition they're going to bring to the table for the next generation of
5948840	5954520	games is going to be really exciting and i hope to fuck sony's ready for it um or we're gonna
5954520	5959240	or we're gonna flip-flop again and this you know this has happened every time right when the
5959240	5963960	original xbox was out playstation 2 was still ahead of it then sony fell on their face with
5963960	5970040	the playstation 3 reveal and the 599 xbox 360 was everywhere and then it flip-flopped again
5970040	5978120	playstation 4 yeah just just like just smack the shit out of xbox one live on stage with those
5978120	5984040	really like frankly smug commercials that were hilarious uh and all that stuff i i really hope
5984040	5989640	sony does not allow themselves to get crisscrossed again because sony or excuse me microsoft is
5990200	5995880	setting the table they are setting the silverware this is going to be and now you have to add this
5995880	6001560	whole cloud stuff into it too like even if you're one of those people that's like i never buy xbox
6001560	6008280	xbox isn't really my thing and you need to wake up and take notice to what's about to happen because
6008280	6013480	everything that's going to be xbox is going to impact the pc gaming world too where maybe you
6013480	6018440	do game so microsoft's going to really come out swing in 2020 i'm adding a little bit of editorial
6018440	6025400	to the real news piece there sorry uh which is uh the uh matt booty from xbox game studio saying
6025400	6031960	a goal of being able to deliver a game roughly every three to four months so um obviously halo
6031960	6037400	infinite is going to be one of those a big launch title um kind of piggybacking on this a little bit
6037400	6042840	cyberpunk 2077 um we know that game is coming out in march but it probably will not make
6043400	6049640	scarlet or playstation 5 right around launch and that is uh according to a new earnings call from
6049640	6053880	cd project red they are developing for the new console but they're not going to be able to
6053880	6059240	release this at launch it could be a cross-gen title but they don't want to target anything as
6059240	6063720	soon as holiday 2020 and i suppose that makes sense because who knows how much time they've
6063720	6070120	actually gotten to play with these new systems or anything like that so um bonds 006 in chat says
6070120	6074920	i was saying similar to a few co-workers earlier this evening about xbox and how it will impact
6074920	6080760	pc gaming absolutely and look i realize there's many of you out there who don't follow microsoft
6080760	6085960	because you're like eh halo not my thing and they don't have a lot of first-party franchises i'm
6085960	6092760	into and i get it i've been very much the same way sometimes but you have to understand phil spencer
6093320	6100600	ever since he took over he has been laying this plan out that you're gonna notice next year and
6100600	6106200	if your problem is their first party titles well this is why they acquired all of these new studios
6106200	6111480	to try to combat that problem if you don't really want an xbox because you're kind of like i'm over
6111480	6115080	buying all these different consoles well that's why we're gonna have streaming or we're gonna
6115080	6121160	have these features for pc like if you're a gamer don't sleep on microsoft i'm not even saying that
6121160	6127800	as a fanboy like i i like all games i'm just i'm excited for this competition and what this next
6127800	6132200	generation is going to bring like 2020 i think it's just going to be an exciting fucking year
6132200	6138520	in that regard right yeah like you know you guys don't really follow microsoft but you have to admit
6138520	6142120	like there's there's something to what i'm saying right yeah it looks interesting they're gonna
6142840	6146760	be because i haven't really bought i haven't really bought in on like a lot of the playstation
6146760	6153800	exclusive stuff so like uh for example you know god of war was all right death stranding
6153800	6160840	the strand is okay but like i don't know like like horizon's pretty fun last of us just doesn't
6160840	6166680	really do anything for me and same with uncharted and i don't know i even like on the microsoft
6166680	6173000	side like not necessarily force is kind of cool but i i just don't really know like i'm looking
6173000	6177560	a lot of multi-platform games and like especially you know deep down your favorite is nintendo it
6177560	6185480	still is all these years later we know it's still your fave i mean i guess all right well
6185480	6191480	it only took 800 episodes to get that all right all joking aside let's move on uh dark sakura
6191480	6197720	you love these types of stories so i know you want to talk about this tonight yes i indeed do
6197720	6205880	okay so i i'm sure people remember the legend of rod caliber right where we beat soul caliber
6205880	6212440	on dreamcast with fishing rod so and of course we've tried to use our ddr pads to play games
6212440	6217000	and things like that well someone and this is probably one of the few times i'm going to bring
6217000	6223560	up halo stuff on purpose someone beat halo 3 on legendary with the guitar hero controller
6224280	6234760	that is impressive um so and i mean we're talking about you know roughly a 10-hour game
6235560	6245960	but someone went in and did the thing with a guitar hero controller um there is a d-pad on
6245960	6251960	that thing now that i think about it like you can do it it's just like yikes that's that's wow
6252200	6259560	wow that's so he put a video up on it there's no analog sticks the username is super lewis 64
6260520	6268760	and um yeah there's a whole video up i'm sure they have a way how he did it um and he's using this
6268760	6276680	the strumming and using the uh the standard fret buttons and he actually put in there his mapping
6277320	6283240	with the fret buttons for how he had everything you know what they were what all the buttons were
6283240	6291960	set for and that the uh the the strum bar is for moving forwards or backwards and then left and
6291960	6297560	right or action you know uses a different modifying aim left aim right we're also set on
6298360	6303400	the empty so i'll um i'll find the video and link it in chat for everybody sorry i didn't know there
6303400	6306840	was a video i would have put it up as b-roll but that's all right for our podcast they're gonna
6306840	6313640	want to find it too so right and but the but it's put up by a super lewis 64 i'll i'll go ahead and
6313640	6318920	put it in the chat i'll make sure you get a link to it that's silly but fun yeah i wonder if that's
6318920	6323160	because like accessibility things that you know you can map anything to anything sure yes the
6323160	6329480	accessibility controller can do all sorts of crazy stuff with so all right uh this isn't quite the
6329480	6334440	same i think is using the rod cap uh doing rod caliber um sj100 matt in chat says i remember
6334440	6339800	hosting a party where we played mortal combat on ddr pads back in college with enough alcohol and
6339800	6343880	drive anything can be played on a different controller oh yeah for sure i thought didn't we
6343880	6348120	play something silly on the dreamcast ddr pads at your house i seem to remember that was a thing
6348120	6353080	those dreamcast dr pads were so weird too because they had that weird like plastic layer on top of
6353080	6359880	them that was kind of funky yeah it was super funky um i mean and mine like completely separated
6359880	6366840	so it was like you know a dance dance slide revolution fall on your face and die yeah um but
6366840	6373640	uh but boom boom dollar y'all right fucking boom boom dollar and i passed i mean that's the first
6373640	6379240	place i passed paranoia was at home yeah on the dreamcast i didn't have this vivid shit when i
6379240	6388600	was playing ddr fucking kids all right let's move on low-key all right so valve has uh taken a
6388600	6396600	thousand games off of steam that have been abusing their tools mainly a lot of these games are
6396600	6405800	actually from a specific uh user on actually i think a specific developer or several developers
6405800	6411080	are actually one developer so what they're doing is it's this uh publisher called uh
6411080	6420280	degstan technology had 48 games on the platform and um apparently there's um some other ones
6420280	6427800	yet they've lost their entire library but i think a lot of these could be that they're just like
6427800	6432760	re-release they're releasing games changing they're kind of abusing the system by just
6432760	6437640	spamming games on there like for example i've seen some videos before where they're showing
6437640	6441640	some of the games that they have where they'll just kind of change what the character looks like
6441640	6446280	and just republish the game over and over and call it something different or release a game
6446280	6453000	four times on the platform they try to get you know steam card sales um stuff like that there's
6453000	6458680	a whole a lot of it's made off of the steam card trading stuff where they you know anything that's
6458680	6464040	easy card earnings people will sell it and they get a portion of that and they make their money
6464040	6471640	that way and they give out the keys for free type of thing but um yeah they said that some of the
6471640	6477880	games though that were on there weren't necessarily um just put up there for a quick buck there's a
6477880	6485560	game called electric highways that had been on steam since 2015 had 1300 positive reviews so
6485560	6493000	i don't know why that one got banned but that's kind of weird um sometimes you make a broad
6493000	6498280	stroke like this you're probably going to catch a few that maybe were more of an on the bubble
6498280	6503080	sort of thing like maybe yeah without looking at like the exact games that were banned maybe that
6503080	6507880	person like put up a legit game and maybe start spamming games i mean who knows um but there's
6507880	6513880	a lot of um they said basically they said a handful of partners are abusing some of steamworks tools
6514520	6523240	um they didn't really specify what exactly they were doing or yeah all right well moving on
6523240	6528200	let's talk about um man you know earlier we talked about like final fantasy 14 and how that game has
6528200	6532520	really um come a long way uh since the beginning and now it's on these metacritic lists and so
6532520	6536760	forth well how about no man's sky this is another one of those games that has managed to really
6536760	6541720	reinvent itself and yet again uh they've put out a pretty major update it's not a major major update
6541720	6548280	but a pretty big update uh the synthesis update uh which includes a new upgrade system that will
6548280	6553160	allow you to go to one of the starship outfitting terminals to spruce up your spacecraft so you can
6553160	6557400	upgrade one of your ships all the way up to an s class and then you can add inventory slots to
6557400	6562120	a spaceship hooray that's good uh there's also a new salvaging system that or i should say the
6562120	6566200	salvage system has kind of been reworked a little bit so you can break down ships that you no longer
6566200	6571400	want into actual materials so that's pretty cool um a lot of quality of life improvements to this
6571400	6576360	as well hello games redid the inventory systems that's kind of interesting now you can just drag
6576360	6581240	and drop things uh into your inventory so that's yeah that wasn't there before so that's pretty
6581240	6585480	cool uh and you can do different outfits within the customized menu so you can switch between
6585480	6590920	outfits because dress up is a very important part of any multiplayer game so that's pretty cool uh
6590920	6597320	the update is out this week uh so it already came out i should say 300 bugs squashed in synthesis as
6597320	6602200	well and uh you know what a turnaround story again for this game you know our voiceover guy
6602200	6605240	jason and i were texting a little bit i still haven't played it since they've done all these
6605240	6610520	updates i really need to go back and i think if i remember correctly i did also buy it on pc so i
6610520	6615160	i really need to go back and these updates are for vr as well as non-v yeah i still haven't played
6615160	6621080	in vr yet either um so uh vr will let you ride creatures and do new no man's sky photo mode
6621080	6626280	so that's pretty cool cool yeah so um lots and lots of uh little changes they say over 300 bug
6626280	6630680	fixes uh and that was all out within this past week you know and i'm sorry a voiceover guy jason
6630680	6634200	and i were talking about how does this game kind of continue to make money because he was asking
6634200	6639480	me he's like do they have a storefront or are they selling like premium currency or something nope
6639480	6645160	they don't they don't sell any of that there's no uh further cost continuing sales i guess
6645160	6649640	games service there's no continuing service besides well they they released on two more
6649640	6655400	platforms so pc and xbox sure but that's a big difference from what anthem is doing to make money
6655560	6662360	right um so uh yeah i mean i the only thing i can come up with is that when they do these big
6662360	6667240	releases they tend to not put the game on sale they're still charging full price for the game
6667240	6672040	but i think full price for no man's sky is down to like 30 bucks and you're only paying that full
6672040	6678200	price if you buy it like you know right around one of these big patches otherwise you can usually
6678200	6682040	find it during a sale for a lot cheaper and i don't know with this being i didn't really look
6682040	6686360	because i already own the game on all the platforms i won it on but um i would imagine
6686360	6693960	like is there a um i don't know is there like a a sale going on right now for black friday that
6693960	6698920	maybe you can still pick this up cheap i don't know well cyber monday yeah and that too this
6698920	6702120	whole this whole kind of weekend i think a lot of websites just kind of put something up for
6702120	6706600	the whole weekend friday to monday yeah i was actually checking epic just to see what was there
6706600	6710840	and actually rayman legends is free right now oh is that their free on and that's their freebie
6710840	6717160	right now wow uh nifty 805 in our chat says i want a baby yoda sidekick it's not yoda yeah
6717160	6720920	it's yeah so i was gonna say it's it's not supposed to be yoda right well yoda's been
6720920	6726680	dead for like by because this is after return of the jedi uh-huh and yoda died in return of the
6726680	6735160	jedi uh-huh so spoiler i'm just kidding fucking a but it said in between um return of the jedi and
6735880	6742760	whatever the the new ray movie was um but it's they never did come out and name yoda species
6742760	6750520	there was another one in uh uh the the prequels that was named yaddle rattle something like that
6751080	6755000	but they never did mention the name of the species and for all the people out there by the way
6755000	6763240	who are saying that it's biting off of gremlins first of all fuckers empire strikes back came out
6763240	6771240	in 1980 or 81 80 something like that yeah it came out in 1980 gremlins came out in 1984 i
6771240	6775480	actually don't see the gremlins resemblance at all besides the pointy ears which is you know
6775480	6780040	vulcans had pointy ears come on little damsel like look at the eyes and be like it looks like
6780600	6785560	look at infant humans how big their eyes are on their faces right look at kittens how big their
6785560	6791960	eyes are on their faces it's a thing that happens with babies and it's roughly a toddler of its
6791960	6798280	species so stop it with a stupid meme it makes you look like an idiot bobby black wolf and chat
6798280	6805160	said boomer okay you know what i'm gen x all the way so you can bite my butt nobody didn't like you
6805160	6811080	i know forget it all right it's a meme i've seen the meme that meme's clever all right bobby says
6811080	6817320	it's baby yoda and tell the creators tell me what to call him or her or it yoder nifty 805
6817320	6823720	i'm calling it kiddo i know that it's not yoda but the internet um you know it's stupid too all
6823720	6829240	right quest buster says someone is working on modding baby yoda into battlefront too well
6829240	6833640	because the internet of course they are of course they are beyond two souls is 15 bucks all right
6833640	6837400	let's you know what let's travel back to a simpler time we're gonna travel back to a simpler time in
6837400	6843720	gaming where there was no baby yoda there was simply just yoda uh it's uh once uh once a week
6843720	6848200	we like to step into the gaming vault and find a game that dark soccer thinks hey you ungrateful
6848200	6855160	brats you should be checking this game out but in a 2019 twist once a month she likes to spotlight a
6855160	6860760	soundtrack for the month and i bet you guys have no idea what it is so i didn't tell you about my
6860760	6865720	fuck up earlier do you want to know about my fuck up dark so do you know how i i capture b-roll
6865720	6871000	every week so what i did is i clicked the button to start recording and then i went off to take a
6871000	6875720	shower the only problem is i clicked the button above the one that starts recording which is the
6875720	6883880	one to start streaming girl so anyone who went to my personal channel probably knows what's coming
6884520	6888520	so sorry about that but it was an honest mistake i'm more worried about the fact that
6888520	6893560	i broadcast a game that wasn't really the game and it was somebody else's playthrough
6893560	6897640	like i was like oh shit i don't want to get in trouble no nintendo is going to be sending
6897640	6901560	lawyers out well luckily it's not an internal game it doesn't matter they're gonna do it anyways
6902200	6907880	luckily i i tried to delete it all and and make no trace it was an honest mistake i think people
6907880	6914200	understand so anyway all right so uh i i apologize if it was spoiled for you but what is the classic
6914200	6919880	classic soundtrack of the month i picked fantasy zone but i specifically picked fantasy zone
6919880	6927000	for this sega mark 3 because first of all i love i fucking love this
6927000	6931640	you mean i'll turn up the sound a little bit here just for a moment yeah let's listen for a sec
6936280	6943960	this is on the strong part right that's really good this is an eight-bit uh system so for me
6943960	6947560	to get into this i'm gonna have to get into a little bit about the sega mark 3
6947560	6953000	the sega mark 3 is roughly considered the precursor to the sega master system
6953000	6959320	but the mark 3 was also marketed as a home computer of sorts physically it looks actually
6959320	6968200	kind of not unlike the atari home computers of of its era it is um an 8-bit uh an 8-bit system
6969000	6979320	but it had the plug-in fm uh music unit so um now built in it was just a ti sn76489
6980280	6989160	chip but you could like i said go into and attach the uh an fm module to boost up that sound quality
6989160	6997000	and that's what we're listening to here um as far as that fm sound unit on its own um
6997880	7007640	it would plug in it was its own little box to it um it was sold uh it starting in 1987 for 6800 yen
7008680	7018040	and it used a ym 2413 fm chip that built above the built-in uh ti chip texas instruments chip
7018040	7024360	and so when the sega master system hit the japanese market that fm sound unit was built
7024360	7029800	into the japanese version of the sega master system and of course not all the games released
7029800	7036760	supported this one but fantasy zone sure as fuck did and fantasy zone is great so um you know and
7036760	7043480	i've done fantasy zone for the classic game of the month too it came out in 1986 um and then it had
7043480	7051320	an international uh release after the arcade game um it was the first of its series and um it just
7051320	7055400	you know really keep gaming music's happy i can listen to this music all freaking day
7058120	7065160	but at any rate um its first port was to the sega mark 3 and the master system um and then of course
7065160	7072520	it got other reports um but the uh the music on this one in particular and of course with the fm
7072520	7079480	for the uh master system is that it opened up so many more channels if you listen to
7080120	7084680	the soundtrack from say the american release that doesn't have the fm sound
7085560	7093800	it is kind of dinky sounding but you get this and it's on par like i was saying earlier with the um
7093800	7102440	with the arcade um and i know i had the the all right there's the composer on here i had that
7103160	7113240	so the composer for this is um a kaguchi hiroshi um who has worked on a lot of of games for for
7113240	7118680	sega and this is actually one of the earlier games he worked on the first one was called
7118680	7125640	girl's garden and he worked on it with yuji naka he did uh hang on space harrier alex kid the lost
7125640	7132520	stars ghost house outrun enduro racers both afterburners uh other things that people would
7132520	7138280	know about turbo outrun sort of vermilion um trying to pick some other things rent a hero
7138280	7146200	outrunners and um he did like some other games too like some he did virtual fighter uh 3 tv
7146200	7151560	he did derby derby owners club online rob that's one of ours so he did our horse whipping game
7151800	7158520	and um he actually i fucking miss derby owners club more recently going back to our music game
7158520	7165800	roots worked on my mind in fact there's some really good remixes of fantasy zone music in
7165800	7175720	my mind but yeah the this really and i feel like i really missed out not having this as my first
7176440	7184920	home version of fantasy zone my first fantasy zone was i think the the tangen one um which it
7184920	7192680	wasn't very pretty i'll go ahead and just tell you that right now but um but i can't do our last
7192680	7199720	soundtrack of the month without doing such a classic that had such a beautiful you know
7199720	7205400	bright soundtrack for a home release and also to let people know that while we were sitting here
7205400	7212600	with our dinky dinky you know four channels our friends in japan had this and it's so completely
7212600	7219880	unfair all right there it is now i need to have my own sega mark 3 just because the classic
7219880	7225000	soundtrack of the month fantasy zone but specifically on the mark 3 so that that
7225000	7229880	system can be acknowledged at some point yeah and of course then the fm uh
7230840	7237640	uh i got my brain went to no my brain was going to say fm towns but i'm at the fm uh capable uh
7237640	7242920	japanese master system oh yes it is okay so and i think that there were versions of fantasy zone
7242920	7247640	for the towns but there was fancy zone on everything like you said somehow a sega game
7247640	7251720	like fantasy zone even ended up on the nes thanks to the whole you know tangen bottle so
7252600	7259160	it's it's it's uh quality is questionable so i don't actually think it did come out on on
7259160	7265560	towns oh well then super fantasy zone with sega mega drive which if someone can find me a legit
7265560	7272360	okay people in japan or somewhere in asia if you can find me a super fantasy zone for the mega
7272360	7282760	drive i will um i'll bake for you i will ship it to to your country all right so it and it
7282760	7288760	can't be a repro it has to be legit old school uh super fantasy zone for the mega drive
7289160	7294280	all right all right there it is the classic soundtrack the final one for the year 2019
7294280	7300200	so that's it so yeah next we should probably uh take a walk down memory lane and recap for the
7300200	7306120	year what all the classic soundtracks were but um in the meantime uh what what's coming up next year
7306120	7314040	pinball oh that's right classic pinball so i am gonna do things that are i'm gonna start with the
7314120	7321320	the ones that had a dmd so you know this got the animation on it not just like
7321320	7325720	and this actually does exclude one of my favorites rob it excludes black knight 2000
7326600	7333480	but it's going to be any of the era of games pre-pinball 2000 but starting with some of the
7333480	7339640	with whatever the first ones to have the the full dmd is so um if people have suggestions
7339640	7343080	go ahead and throw them my way or else you're just gonna be getting you know world cup soccer
7343080	7349720	every month kidding um but you know these and i'm trying everyone knows that like my freaking
7349720	7355080	favorites are like world cup soccer and theater of magic and all that but i want to go to some of the
7355080	7361960	other ones that might not be as well known but on a month you're feeling uh last minute you might
7361960	7370360	see one of those well and the the thing is is that there are good games that are pre that dmd area
7371240	7375480	that i think you know like swords of fury for example go fucking listen to the soundtrack
7375480	7380760	for swords of fury that is phenomenal it's great you know black knight 2000 also good but i want
7380760	7385480	to get some of those ones that people might have had a chance that they've seen while they were
7385480	7391960	new out in the wild all right well stay tuned for 2020 in that segment now to recap 2019 and
7391960	7397880	the classic 8-bit soundtrack of the month uh in january we had the guardian legend because of
7397880	7404760	course we did in february we had journey to sillius march we had avadox april we had jackal
7405320	7413000	may we had wonder boy 3 the dragon's trap june we had r-type july we had quartet uh august we had
7413000	7420120	blaster master september we had akumajo densetsu and october we had ducktales and november we had
7420120	7426440	metal gear and closing it specifically the msx msx 2 metal gear and closing out the year
7426440	7430840	specifically the sega mark 3 because it wouldn't be a jamie segment if she didn't like no no i
7430840	7437640	want to use this to spotlight the soundtrack and the system we have fantasy zone specifically on
7437640	7443080	the sega mark 3 um i honestly think the fantasy zone is one of those games that really did just
7443080	7449720	show off um the power of the fm unit yeah so if you're a little newer to orange launch radio um
7449720	7454360	dark soccer has been uh screwing with the segment for a couple years now we had in 2018 the classic
7454360	7459240	peripheral of the month and in 2017 it was the classic console of the month that was the one
7459240	7464360	that kind of started it all so um and you can uh visit all of that if you want if you're curious
7464360	7469800	has this game ever been picked uh go visit our wiki it's like a it's an unofficial slash official
7469800	7475080	wiki unofficial because we don't touch it or edit it because i literally don't know how like i have
7475080	7480360	to ping dark tetsuya on twitter and say help like i did that today i said help this is wrong can you
7480360	7487400	fix it do the thing um but also official in the fact that we we look at it and like the reason
7487400	7491400	why that all came up is because dark soccer and i were having an offline conversation and i was
7491400	7496440	like wait the wiki's wrong so we actually look at it and i couldn't tell you what happened on
7496440	7500360	the show last week and i kind of like had a feeling i did but i didn't see it on there i was
7500360	7506600	like well shit i'll do no i've had if i have a good idea what happened well i don't care i was
7506600	7511240	gonna pick duck tails again and i was like i remember cutting this video like just like weeks
7511240	7517160	ago yeah uh but no i and then rob's like are you sure and then we looked at the wiki together like
7517160	7522040	we're missing a month what the fuck happened and then i actually thanks to the twitch archive
7522040	7526360	i looked at episode and thanks to the sidebar on the side it made it really easy to find okay
7526360	7529880	where's the classic game where aha here's where duck tails is in the missing the episode that's
7529880	7536120	missing in the wiki so yeah so but at any rate um you know and for folks if you just want to
7536200	7541160	message me on the twitters it's at dark sakura you've been using that more i have not just for
7541160	7546680	cross-posting i have been but um just because facebook is shit um i got my finally got my
7546680	7552920	invite to uh wt social i did too and i don't like it live journaling i've been trying to use like
7552920	7557560	live journal all right i'll be i'll check out yours see if i get inspiration but anyway but
7557560	7564280	anyway um so if you've got uh you know that era of pinball if there's particular games you like you
7564280	7568840	know if you really want me to do the getaway you know i don't know if i'm going to do the getaway
7568840	7573880	i don't really care for it but you know send me a message of the pins that you like and there's a
7573880	7582360	very likely chance that i might say hey that is a good one let's do it um bobby is kind of subtly
7582360	7586760	asking for his page to get updated because it's been about eight years uh saying the wiki says
7586760	7591080	something about the ferret and clicky the pen and wow that's a joke we haven't referenced in forever
7591080	7593960	well i don't know if you want to remove it but yeah you probably want to change the
7593960	7598840	tense to like it was a former joke it was an old joke it's in a box in my house but looking up
7598840	7604520	old jokes is is part of the reason why the wiki is there but i i'm i support a uh i support a
7604520	7609320	freshening up i support renovations on bobby's profile to make it current i remember that
7609320	7616120	shermy was the best foot warmer ever yes yes all right um let's see swang tong is asking is shaking
7616120	7629000	and crying dead um no i no but it may change um but i don't want to make any promises that i can't
7629000	7634040	keep all i can say is that victoria went on that trip to new york city with me when we went to go
7634040	7638920	see broadway plays which doesn't that sound exactly up the alley of what shaking and crying
7638920	7643800	is all about and so we definitely talked about like what we want to do when it comes to podcasting
7643800	7650440	but while we were there we kind of came up with a different idea that we were both really into
7650440	7653560	and then thanksgiving happened and we got completely derailed because she's been out of
7653560	7659400	town and you know i've been busy so and i still had that idea i know well and this is the one
7659400	7665720	victoria and i have is completely different it's not what you think so um we will um it'd be
7665720	7671160	exploring that in the near future that's all i can say so yes bobby knows what it is near near i have
7671160	7675720	to tell bobby because i'm like bobby i'm gonna be inviting all this traffic onto the website that
7675720	7681000	you weren't expecting is that okay and then it's like what traffic lol well you never know i i
7681000	7687960	might have the next big idea all right then you might appreciate what happened a couple weekends
7687960	7693240	ago for a sister stitch and bitch session sure quickly because we're almost to 8 30 we did break
7693240	7697400	out into show tunes part b of our show to get to we fully broke out into show tunes all right one
7697400	7701080	of these nights i'm gonna come to the bar when you all are there and do that all right what
7701080	7705880	happens yeah bobby did approve the idea it's on it's on me and victoria we haven't got up off the
7705880	7711960	ground to do it yet i i think you guys will like it if you said uh nifty says that podcast was
7711960	7717480	cute to me we need to hear you two theater queens geeking out i think you'll like the idea we have
7717480	7723640	in store it's a little more free form i i don't know how to explain it without making promises
7723960	7728840	then be expected to deliver on all right so for now let's go to rapid fire news let's uh travel
7728840	7734200	around quickly and check out some quick headlines from around gaming world loki all right so we've
7734200	7740600	got your new free games that you're gonna get with your paid subscriptions to xbox and microsoft
7741240	7748360	starting with our i'm sorry xbox and sony um playstation so we're gonna have with the

7769640	7773640	long time ago still haven't played it but here it's excellent and everybody says it's it's an
7773640	7779240	amazing campaign it is i mean if it wasn't for that we wouldn't have apex so something to think
7779240	7785880	about on the microsoft type of our side of things with uh games of gold on xbox one you're gonna get
7785880	7793960	insane robots and then jurassic world evolution and then on the xbox 360 front you've got toy
7793960	7802680	story 3 and castlevania lord of shadow mirror of fate hd all right some of the early impressions
7802680	7807320	of the witcher's netflix series are starting to leak out onto social media technically it's
7807320	7814040	embargoed until december 20th um but i guess some critics uh who have seen the first few episodes
7814040	7820120	have uh written some tweets and so forth uh one critic critic said i'm quite liking it in a tweet
7820120	7824760	i'll have more to say when the embargo drops uh one other one says i've never really been thirsty
7824760	7828920	for henry cavill uh i've seen a screener of the first episode of the witcher and i think i'm
7828920	7836520	pregnant uh the fight choreography is insane first fight is beautifully savage uh the witcher's cast
7836520	7841800	both lead and supporting are beyond exceptional amazing cast all around um so it sounds like
7841800	7847000	there's a lot of actually pretty good feedback on the witcher series which you know usually shows
7847000	7852040	that are based on a video game don't do so well but oh it's not actually based on a video game
7852040	7856040	it's based on the books that the video game were also based off of if y'all were starting to type
7856040	7860920	the correction in chat i know it and i guess to be fair i say that uh a lot of games haven't made
7860920	7865480	good shows but uh the castlevania anime has been pretty well received from what i understand yeah
7865480	7871160	the ingress anime was mixed i i could not get into that and uh what else what other games about a
7871160	7876040	show that i'm not thinking of in the moment um i feel like there was another big one i'm like
7876040	7880680	neglecting in the moment obviously 14 is supposed to get one i'm really excited about that i'm
7880680	7885320	curious how that'll go there's actually something else kind of along with the show ish thing is that
7885320	7890840	animal crossing new horizon is getting a manga oh fun yeah they've got i can talk more about
7890840	7895160	they've sort of got minecraft story mode as like an interactive okay minecraft yeah yeah yeah yeah
7895160	7900120	sort of okay anyway uh moving on uh i did not know this game was getting like an expansion but it is
7900120	7905080	the stanley parable remember that it was at e3 yeah it was a few years ago so no actually that
7905080	7910280	was this year no no no the original game all right a few years ago the expansion was this year yeah
7910280	7916040	the stanley parable ultra deluxe a remaster slash expansion that will take the original game and add
7916040	7920840	some new content and new endings uh it's been delayed till next year womp womp but at the same
7920840	7924920	time delays aren't bad news anymore so if that's what they it's not like you don't have the and
7924920	7929400	that was how they prefaced it with like they're reading fan mail and all the fans are like we
7929400	7934600	want to be perfect and we don't care if you delay it well there you go challenge accepted so they've
7934600	7939720	delayed it uh till next year and honestly my plate's been pretty full this year so
7941080	7944840	a delay to next year is not the end of the world dark soccer what do you have for rapid fire news
7944840	7950040	um capcom is going to be releasing a new game in december um according to some listings for
7950040	7957080	japanese game expo um gamatsu uh there's actually a translation from gamatsu that um says that the
7957080	7963960	capcom's jump festa 2020 exhibit um they are going to showcase four titles at the event two are known
7963960	7971960	to be mega man zero slash zx legacy collection and a monster hunter world iceborn it could also
7971960	7977480	be possible that uh the devil may cry collection could take one of those but there's one more
7977480	7984520	that's unknown so we will find out uh the fest is going to run between december 1st to 22nd
7984520	7991640	in cheeba i don't suppose it's a dino crisis hd collection no well one of the other things
7991640	7997800	though is that of course they are working on a resident evil 3 um remake to follow the
7997800	8003480	resident evil 2 remake so uh they're really wanting people to leave some feedback on that
8003480	8008520	one are we gonna get a resident evil 8 because 7 is supposed to be pretty good i feel like they're
8008520	8014040	kind of stuck in the fuck out in the remake thing uh and eight i mean seven kind of had that whole
8014040	8019960	vr and non-vr stuff going on so i don't know what they've decided to do with eight at this point
8019960	8023400	i think it'll happen but these remakes are serving them pretty well for now
8023400	8030920	rob it's up to us to take down umbrella i don't want you to end up in a jamie sandwich
8030920	8039880	right anyway um there's gonna be um a update for death stranding to tackle some common requests
8039880	8044920	including improving the font size now keep in mind when i was looking at this i was looking
8044920	8050360	really tiny font on really tiny screen and i was fine but not everyone has super jamie vision when
8050360	8054040	you take off your glasses and everything's huge yeah if you're sitting next to a monitor you can
8054040	8058760	probably see it okay but yeah it's it's like the subtitles are all right i was like oh why are
8058760	8063160	people playing but then i saw like in the quest menus and stuff i'm like okay damn that is some
8063160	8072600	tiny ass text wow um um but also um there um there's gonna be another thing that addresses
8072600	8078120	a request to be able to dispose of individual vehicles so they're looking about patching that
8078120	8086040	in for the mid-december patch um and hold on just double check to see if there's anything else i
8086040	8090120	don't even have a vehicle yet i will say where i'm at in the game and i don't think this is spoilery
8090120	8096440	vehicles were in trailers um i i have the quest to because i just got the ability to build like
8096440	8101800	a power source in my structure so i have a directive to go build one of those next to a bike
8101800	8105720	that's run out of power it's been sitting there for a while so that's so for those of you that
8105720	8109720	played death stranding that's exactly where i'm at in the game well there's they did with the
8109720	8116760	last update um had some performance improvements and uh worked on some network functionality um
8118120	8125720	but yeah there you go so that's our current quick stuff all right so let's travel around the world
8125720	8130040	and check out what is coming out this week in world release dates i imagine it's a pretty slow
8130040	8134040	week being that the holidays just occurred but you never know i do you think so and you're right
8134040	8138680	you never know what's right around the corner in fact we have several things coming out this week
8138680	8145320	so we have blair witch coming out on playstation 4 we have halo reach um on pc i believe that's
8145320	8151960	just being added to the master chief collection uh life is strange episode 5 on pc playstation
8151960	8157640	4 and xbox one never winter nights enhanced edition on nintendo switch playstation 4 and xbox
8157640	8168280	one phoenix point on pc and mac saga scarlet grace ambitions on pc nintendo switch playstation
8168280	8178520	4 android and ios uh scale boy on nintendo switch terminator resistance on pc playstation 4 and
8178520	8186360	xbox one alien isolation on nintendo switch uh we have dark siders genesis on pc and stadia
8187000	8195800	uh raging loop on pc star ocean first departure r on nintendo switch and playstation 4 and last
8195800	8203880	but not least ancestors the humankind odyssey on playstation 4 and xbox one all right so it's
8203880	8207160	pretty still a pretty busy week i thought i would have thought it would be a dead week but not
8207160	8212840	really um it's starting after this week it'll start to slow down a bit and then really die off
8213000	8217240	about the second or third week in december fair enough well japan since things are a little
8217240	8220920	different holidays are kind of a different perception over there uh it's a very different
8220920	8225320	kind of week uh we got some big names out this week in japan on the playstation 4 including yokai
8225320	8232440	watch 4 plus plus on the playstation 4 so that's you know a a disc or a non-handheld release uh for
8232440	8237000	yokai watch that's a pretty big deal i i wish that series hadn't kind of disappeared here i was into
8237000	8241080	it in the beginning so i wish they would try a playstation 4 or switch release also something
8241080	8245720	in a high tv show oh yeah that's true all right so but anyway still pretty big over there though
8245720	8249480	oh no it's still huge over there so i'm not too surprised to hear i kind of wanted to sit and
8249480	8255400	watch the anime just because i love uh the folklore of yokai um also out in japan this
8255400	8260440	week the dark pictures man of madan um gets its release in japan this week they are saying it is
8260440	8264280	an english version it hasn't been localized for japan um but that is out if they want to check
8264280	8269720	that out uh and then a game called citadel is out this week as well and what is arguably the
8269720	8273800	biggest release in japan this week no just kidding it's definitely yokai watch but you know this one
8273800	8279720	caught my eye oni chambara origin is out on the playstation 4 this week oh that's right if you
8279720	8285240	don't know oni chambara you should check it bikini samurai that's right it's all the the ladies
8285240	8292120	wearing very little clothes i really wish more of the simple 1000 games or 2000 games actually ended
8292120	8299080	up coming out um aside from just you know earth defense force and on chambara i mean like they
8299080	8305720	had ambulance versus zombies and that's really the only other one i remember but uh more simple
8305720	8311240	series games or games like that all right well looking at the nintendo switch of course yokai
8311240	8315480	watch 4 plus plus is out on that system as well but then we have another couple titles we have
8315480	8322200	a game called moto new pus osumatsu san uh which comes out from d3 it looks like it's like just
8322200	8326360	a match 3 type of game but like there's two different versions of this game and everything
8326840	8332040	so it's yeah simple controls match 3 i guess there's a story that goes with it i don't know
8332040	8337720	seems like kind of a big deal for a match 3 game um always a big deal though is a pretty princess
8337720	8341480	game that's right pretty princess magical coordinate is out this week on the switch as
8341480	8348360	well where you get to decorate over 1300 castle excuse me castle rooms with 1300 items you can
8348360	8353320	customize your character and feel like a princess you can do princess training lessons and mini
8353320	8358200	games so you can perfect your wave i'm sure as the decorating thing sounds kind of fun um and
8358200	8362280	then you can have your princess make poses and take pictures of the finished rooms how about
8362280	8365960	that it's a one to four player four player game so i guess you get to decorate together
8366680	8372040	so there it is so japan japan's still a pretty fun week right see there's lots of stuff coming out
8372040	8377960	that's right how about europe uh a decent amount so on the second we have life is strange 2 for
8377960	8383800	xbox and playstation farming simulator 20 for switch never winter nights enhanced edition for
8383800	8390840	the three um we also have red dead redemption 2 for pc off-road oh that's sorry on december 4th
8390840	8397080	more on december 4th is offered racing for the big three um on the 5th we have dead by daylight
8397080	8404200	nightmare edition um it doesn't say what's coming out on though and then also on the on the 5th oh
8404200	8408920	yeah that's right there's a bunch uh battle wake for playstation uh assassins creed the rebel
8408920	8416840	collection for switch gang beasts on um for xbox and playstation and last but not least
8416840	8422040	narco's rise of the cartels for the playstation and xbox
8425240	8431640	so that's it all right there it is release dates from around the world um still pretty pretty busy
8431640	8435000	this early december but yeah probably because we're right in that gap where it's like okay
8435000	8438920	now's your last chance to get the game out before the end of the year uh before christmas and all
8438920	8444120	that stuff so all right well let's move on uh every week we invite your emails that participate
8444120	8448520	at orange lounge radio.com and we like to read some of your emails here on the show so again if
8448520	8453080	you want to send us an email for a future week please do participate at orange lounge radio.com
8453080	8458680	and dark sakura is going to jump in the mailbag and read some stuff okay um so uh we have one
8458680	8464120	from robert m which is sort of a follow-up from the bunch of other operating system questions but
8464120	8470520	i will go ahead and read part of this too um just uh just keep going um is citing older versions of
8470520	8475560	mac and ios systems from the last time the older games lost support and catalina that is correct
8475560	8483480	catalina no longer supports 32-bit applications and games so um um and then he asked is super
8483480	8490600	multitasking plus ultra is it 64-bit yyr that would be a yyr question i don't know please let
8490600	8498200	us know if it's a 64-bit app um the discussion of half-life alex as valve's first game in a
8498200	8505000	long time reminded me of the recent forgotten uh card game artifact i assume if it's still
8505000	8510600	uh being supported it probably is not going to see as much of an uptick as magic games are as
8510600	8516760	the hearthstone alternative so how about that like magic yyr is in chat thank you so much
8516760	8523800	buddy uh saying it is 64-bit on mac 32-bit on windows so it's where it needs to be to run
8524520	8530040	so there you go all right so yeah if you're gonna play it on a mac upgrade i mean you can know you
8530040	8537240	can do it on the current os's so yeah sorry brain went around okay and then um i got a two-part
8537240	8543640	email from flaco jones oh important footnote from yyr but future mac support is up in the air will
8543640	8550760	be determined over the coming months i wonder if that has to do with um sales so mac fans get on
8550760	8555240	that super multitasking i'm making that up he didn't say why i imagine it's probably difficult
8555240	8559400	give me an app store link and i'll make it fly well i don't think it's on the app store yet
8560040	8564680	it needs to be in the app store yeah i don't know there might be there might be a problem with steam
8564680	8569400	green light in the way that was all put up i don't know i don't know that's a that's an oh and and
8569400	8572920	the leaderboards are built into the games that would be a whole undertaking for him so i can
8572920	8578280	understand why he wants to focus he wants to focus on his expansion first i'm sure anyway hey i just
8578280	8582040	wanted to pop in with a little correction on your game rewards talk so that you have the right info
8582040	8587960	on how they work this is flaco jones by the way while fans do get a vote and how these awards go
8587960	8595080	it only accounts for 10 of the vote the voting jury composed of 80 media and influencer outlets
8595080	8600680	from around the world accounts do the other 90 of the vote so unless the vote is really close i
8600680	8607960	don't think fans have much of a sway over who actually wins if they did i doubt a small game
8607960	8613800	like overcook 2 would have beaten all those much more well-known nintendo games for best family
8613800	8619000	game last year also over half of those outlets are from outside the united states which makes
8619000	8624760	them less predictable based on how those games are received from our perspective here in the us
8624760	8629640	the jury isn't entirely made up of critical publications like i mentioned earlier if it
8629640	8634840	was just based on critics control probably wouldn't have a chance as it was the lowest
8634840	8639720	metacritic score of all the game of the year nominees you definitely hit the nail on the head
8639720	8645880	about the ongoing game category though it was a big shock that overwatch wasn't nominated as it
8645880	8651560	had been for the last two years and it won the category in 2017 i think final fantasy 14 has
8651560	8658040	shot over fortnite fortnite already won last year and again fan vote doesn't really mean anything
8658040	8664600	i was a little surprised that blitzchung didn't uh get a nomination for best esports player i
8664600	8669000	thought that would have been interesting but i don't really know how he did outside of the
8669000	8674280	tournament he won where he spoke out and got suspended have a great rest of your stream
8674280	8680200	flaco jones um very good points yeah i'll let you read that in a sec um i just want to say you know
8680200	8686440	oops we got it wrong sorry last week so um thanks for correcting how that all is um judged he makes
8686440	8692120	a really great analogy in the next email but i wanted to quickly say on um control and metacritic
8692120	8696200	and all that and you mentioned that final fantasy 14 has a shot um since we just talked about
8696200	8700680	metacritic earlier in the show it does seem like the barometer may be tilting in final fantasy 14's
8700680	8704840	favor so uh the blitzchung thing though i mean there was a part of me that was like well what
8704840	8710120	was the deadline for this maybe but i i would have thought nah i'm sure this that whole incident
8710120	8716200	could have happened before the deadline so um who knows why that didn't end up happening perhaps
8716200	8721960	um they were nervous about putting that in the spotlight i don't know anyway um let's hear the
8721960	8726920	other email though because he makes a great comparison in this email second email because
8726920	8731640	i forgot to mention one point i wanted to make about the game awards personally i find them to
8731640	8736120	be more like the golden globes of the game industry since the winners are determined by a global jury
8736120	8742680	of media and not game makers themselves i put more stock in who wins at the dice awards in february
8742680	8747400	which are actually voted on by peers who work in game development and publishing a lot more like
8747400	8751880	the oscars if we're still comparing it to movie awards but since they come out later and don't
8751880	8757560	have the media outlets attached they don't usually get as much buzz okay that's it for the award
8757560	8762920	emails flaco jones i just wanted to call out what a great comparison that is when many people are
8762920	8768520	saying that the game awards should be the oscars of gaming in a way um very interesting to call
8768520	8773960	out but the way they're voted on oscars are voted on by industry peers and people that are you know
8773960	8779720	within the film industry and so forth so really it's the dice awards that are kind of the barometer
8779720	8787240	there whereas the way this is voted on by media worldwide that is how the golden globes are voted
8787240	8791880	on it so the golden globes doesn't have the fan part of it but i mean still the comparison i think
8791880	8797480	is is pretty good what you're getting at there um and golden globes was always supposed to be the
8797480	8803320	more informal one the more party atmosphere right um the golden globes used to be the laughing stock
8803320	8807000	of the film industry like people didn't even want to be seen there but they really kind of
8807000	8811560	started turning it around what was it probably like the 90s the late 80s or the 90s i think a
8811560	8816440	lot of people with the golden globes probably remember one of the first big things that
8816440	8822520	contributed to that party atmosphere of the golden globes was when christine lottie won that award
8822520	8828040	for whatever tv show she was on at the time but she was in the bathroom so robin williams jumped
8828040	8833560	on stage and just started doing this improv live and was like paging christine lottie and stuff
8833560	8837480	and it was this really funny because you know robin williams could pull comedy out of his butt
8837480	8842520	and it was hilarious right he was great in that regard um and i think that really made a lot more
8842520	8847320	people start paying attention to the golden globes being like the party one and then they then the
8847320	8851640	golden globes kind of billed itself as that and they had ricky jervais host those few years and
8851640	8857000	they they loved him for a while because he was so unpredictable and so forth that was the one that
8857000	8860920	tina fey and amy polar hosted which i don't know why they don't do it every year they prob they
8860920	8864280	probably turned it down because they have other projects they want to do but they're hilarious
8864280	8868840	and so forth so you know especially because the game awards i think are definitely the showier
8868840	8874840	show whereas the dice awards are more the you know industry thing but we just don't really see the
8874840	8881320	dice awards they don't televise that so it doesn't feel as oscary and so forth so i'm glad they don't
8881320	8887640	have celebrity hosts doing it because like i know like several years like different not necessarily
8887640	8896520	award shows but like presenters joel mchale or even uh uh conan o'brien it has to not it has to
8896520	8902200	be the right presenter like for example i consider aisha tyler a celebrity presenter but like she
8902200	8907960	knows her shit because she plays halo and shit in her downtime like she she knew her games you know
8907960	8913160	she was an authentic voice in the celebrities i think i say was because i haven't seen her
8913160	8919160	do anything in gaming in a while but you know when she would talk about gear is a war on her
8919160	8922200	show or whatever because she was on the talk for a while i don't think i don't know if she ever
8922200	8925640	brought it up there but it's like she she knew what she was talking about she was being told
8925640	8930680	let's say she knew what she was talking about yeah you know and even though conan o'brien makes it
8930680	8936520	funny i still feel like he kind of really does play games but it's it's he his job is to not
8936520	8942200	make it serious um i still don't think he's funny uh well jimmy fallon then we'll go with that
8942200	8948360	because he's brought more video game exposure to the tonight show which is always kind of like
8948360	8952680	i mean you want to talk about okay boomer the tonight show is always that show that you kind
8952680	8957560	of associate with like a much different generation jimmy fallon love him or hate him has kind of had
8957560	8963000	this responsibility to try to make this show more accessible to a wider audience because let's be
8963000	8967640	real jay leno never did that and when conan o'brien swung that pendulum too hard in the
8967640	8972680	other direction he lost his show in seven months so jimmy fallon's been in this very hard place
8972680	8976520	where he's kind of had to walk the line and make a show that's accessible to the legacy of the
8976520	8983400	tonight show but also one that is going to live on you know with newer generations and he's done that
8983400	8991320	in part by having um oh what's her name captain marvel playing uh beat saber brie larson thank
8991320	8996120	you brie larson playing beat saber was it was it her i was somebody that one of one of the marvel
8996120	9000520	girls was playing beat saber with her on uh with him and you know he was one of the first to show
9000520	9008760	the switch that that gif or gif whatever you want to say of of um um oh my god miyamoto in the
9008760	9013080	audience where he does that whole like thumbs up thing that whole gift of him out there that was
9013080	9016760	from the tonight show you know so anyway i'm sorry i don't remember where i was going with
9016760	9021080	this but i was just kind of pointing out like you know oh media and having to embrace games
9021080	9026680	and celebrities and that whole sort of thing so um swang tong says whatever happened to conan
9026680	9031880	he's been on tbs this whole time yeah um i and they he doesn't need to pull in the same type of
9031880	9036680	numbers on well nowadays like it's i don't know how well these like late shows are really doing
9036680	9043640	because most people watch consume these through clips on youtube that's how i do it i mean i
9043640	9049320	don't watch like i don't watch uh any of these guys but i'll just watch the clips i don't think
9049320	9054440	i would ever watch one of these late night live shows i used to back in the day i i remember
9054440	9059320	watching johnny carson in my bedroom okay like i'm dating myself i know that towards the end of his
9059320	9063640	run and i was probably 10 or 11. i used to watch the reruns of conan o'brien though like when they
9063640	9068040	would rerun them during the day we used to gather up in the dorm room and watch late night with conan
9068040	9074840	o'brien like yeah he was like his target audience i think i i love well i saw him live i went to his
9074840	9079960	live tour and it was fantastic the one here in sac i did san francisco yes and i loved it it
9079960	9083160	was great yeah i thought it was funny i had a great time but i have to admit i haven't been
9083160	9087160	following the tbs show as much because i just don't watch a lot of late night stuff and you're
9087160	9091640	right it's all consumed in bits and honestly you know who you know who i see more than anybody else
9091640	9095160	like the youtubes i see more than anybody else that i probably watch more than anybody else
9095160	9099720	jimmy kimmel and i would have never thought that would be the case because jimmy kimmel reminds me
9099720	9105320	of the man show which was fucking ridiculous but his late night show he's got a lot of good viral
9105320	9110120	clips i usually watch uh late night with seth meyers or uh i'll watch the clips also of um
9111960	9118840	uh steven colbert i like samantha b and john oliver yeah john oliver i'll use watch that
9120040	9126360	like good like thinky stuff um i i what i want to say about um jimmy kimmel oh i think the best
9126360	9132680	clip that i saw him do was when he manufactured that viral clip of like the girl twerking on the
9132680	9136920	door and then the door opens and it falls over and they show that went that was a legit thing
9136920	9141560	that they put on youtube it went viral and then on his show they revealed that when the door opens
9141560	9145560	it's jimmy kimmel on the other side of the door and like he kind of showed like we made this clip
9145560	9150680	go viral and this is how we did it and i just thought it was very interesting so anyway and
9150680	9155640	then they brought on the girl that was twerking it was like a stunt stunt woman or something from
9155640	9160920	motion pictures so anyway i just thought it was interesting so um and bobby does point out the
9160920	9164760	good thing about oliver and b is that they're weekly and not nightly and you do see a lot of
9164760	9171960	shows kind of going that way as a result i used to love the daily show but i don't the clips that
9171960	9175720	aren't as great as they used to be i don't know if i just don't care for the new guy as much as
9175720	9180920	you know john stewart or what it is i don't know i used to love letterman back in the day i think
9180920	9186920	when letterman first took over at cbs that was like the heyday of late night television anyway
9187560	9192440	because i always thought leno was lame i never cared for him leno is a shithole but he has a
9192440	9200680	great car collection he had and he has a die-hard fan base of sorts i don't i don't get it anyway
9200680	9206440	he's just not a good person i think i don't think he's funny at all like anyway anyway it's not about
9206440	9210520	late night i don't think he's funny in the same way i don't think that rodney dangerfield was
9210520	9219000	funny that whole well i'm an asshole what are you gonna do but yeah like but bianca del rio
9219000	9223560	does that same shtick and it's funny yeah but bianca del rio is actually smart yeah i guess
9223560	9228120	that's true all right anyway let's move on and joan rivers did a lot of that same shtick but she's
9228120	9234280	smart she was a genius right all right let's move on um and full of preservatives let's talk about
9234280	9239720	more stadia news i talked about stadia earlier in the show yes so stadia pro they have that
9239720	9245240	subscription service which they're supposed to be giving new games uh each month and you know we
9245240	9249960	talked about last month how the only game that's really free right now is stadia probe was destiny
9249960	9255560	2 well that's actually going to change because now they've added a few more games for december that
9255560	9261640	are going to be available as well so um those being tomb raider and farming simulator 19
9262200	9270280	which um are available but apparently though anybody that bought those games now will actually
9270280	9276280	be getting a discount because they okay i'm sorry they're not free i guess you get a discount on
9276280	9282440	those um no they are free so they're giving you i guess a discount of 10 on tomb raider and 50 on
9282440	9288920	farming simulator 19 which i'm assuming is just the list price for those uh but yeah so those i
9288920	9294360	guess are finally live and i guess that i i don't know they need to do a better job of actually
9294360	9300520	communicating which games are free with stadia pro each month i guess they do have it now where
9300520	9305480	they're showing you know the december and i guess oh samurai showed that was another one that was
9305480	9309960	free as well chat was correct you on that but yeah sorry they added simmer i forgot the samurai
9309960	9313720	showing out like the last minute it was in there yeah but like you know it'd be nice to know like
9313720	9320120	what um like say for example january is going to be and stuff like that just i mean i get it like
9320120	9328280	it you don't really do that necessarily with um you like the playstation plus stuff in that but
9328920	9333240	if you're paying for stadia pro i mean there's such a small library right now that you would
9333240	9338760	think that they would kind of say hey oh shit i didn't even okay so here's the fun this is why i
9338760	9343400	said oh shit so i was actually bringing up the stadia app so loki could kind of see this firsthand
9343400	9347160	what it looks like in the app that they do actually have a section that says stadia pro
9347160	9352120	games is right there so and these are the ones that are all free and why i went oh shit is
9352120	9356280	because tomb raider and farming simulator are already there they went apparently they went
9356280	9361080	free today yeah because it's december i i well yeah but you know like playstation plus games
9361080	9365400	aren't live until like the first thursday in december it's not always december 1st so i just
9365400	9370120	oh shitted because i'm like oh tomb raider and farming simulator farming simulator fuck yes
9371080	9376680	you know actually i will say that euro truck simulator and those those games are actually
9376680	9383560	like in a zen sort of way like really relaxing and fun so i'll try for free free well yeah free
9383560	9388840	because bobby gave me his buddy pass thanks bobby i can't murder me anybody in those games i'm not
9388840	9393400	really necessarily so i'm sorry i guess well you can murder him in tomb raider i was gonna say i
9393400	9399560	had to leave all my murdering to me him yes to uh tomb raider so neat neat i had no idea um that
9399560	9404760	those games were um actually out so i'm good to know i'll be checking that out a little later on
9404760	9411320	i wish i could stream it but obviously you see the problem i can't stream while i'm streaming
9411320	9416920	i guess i could but it would affect the quality of both one or the other uh but i could record it
9416920	9422680	and i've thought about doing this would you guys even care what if i recorded like a long play and
9422680	9427960	just debuted it on twitch during the day um on a random night when there's no live vog programming
9427960	9430280	what would you think would you would you care about that or would you just be like eh
9431000	9437800	kind of a question for you guys because or they may think i go where i want to go rob's gonna be
9437800	9442760	like all wolf which is fine but i'm just curious like if i were to record stadia stuff and they're
9442760	9449800	gonna be like this isn't a pinball game do i have to play pinball no because you you accidentally
9449800	9457800	broadcast your footage from the b-roll oh shut up all right moving on uh let's talk about this
9457800	9461400	i just thought this was you know it's a bit of a slower news week so i thought this was like oh
9461400	9468600	interesting um and this has to do with minecraft um and it has to do with the vatican um so we have
9468600	9474280	a news article about a priest that is going to be launching a vatican minecraft server
9474280	9483320	um and so it's fr what's fr short for for france france friends god damn it what are the france
9483320	9489160	no it's the title in the church oh not deacon not pope not what's fr
9490600	9496200	father father oh that's our friar that's way too easier than father's father probably works
9496200	9503240	well you're you're saying this to the the nun i know father robert balacer um who is a jesuit
9503240	9508280	priest who studied engineering in silicon valley is wanting to introduce the vatican's minecraft
9508280	9513560	server as a place where players can express themselves in a environment that is not as toxic
9513560	9517960	as maybe other things that you're running out to out there so like i guess if you will a safe space
9517960	9522200	um then you may find in other games oh pot culture points out he's from this week in tech i didn't
9522200	9528280	know that okay so this guy's kind of involved with tech stuff before so the project started on
9528280	9533560	twitter and he polled the followers on what game do you want to do a test server rust arc team
9533560	9538360	fortress 2 or minecraft and 64 of the votes went to minecraft yeah i don't know if russ didn't
9538360	9544840	necessarily be the uh the best choice for don't don't you hang dong in that game so like i don't
9544840	9551000	know if that's he took a vote of sorts so anyway uh father robert balacer uh says in a quote rome
9551000	9555480	reports uh it's not about the technology it's not even really about the gaming it's about getting
9555480	9560680	people together who can then maybe move those relationships to the real world at first there
9560680	9565240	were a lot of people who were very hesitant because you see this guy in a collar talking
9565240	9570520	about the latest offerings from google or how you run fiber optics across the atlantic and they
9570520	9575080	didn't understand they said wait a minute these two things don't go together but after a time they
9575080	9579400	realized okay he knows what he's talking about he just happens to be a priest and ultimately that
9579400	9584680	was the ministry i was trying to do you know despite however you might feel about the church
9584680	9589320	organized religion and that sort of thing i you have to admire what this guy's trying to do
9590040	9595320	this is smart this and it's it's funny because we were just talking about like late night and having
9595320	9600600	to bridge the generations and when i i don't know about you guys when i think about the vatican i
9600600	9605240	think about the pope i think about a lot of these fathers these people you know who i think about
9605240	9610680	fucking old people really old people well right and and i and i think what he's doing is a great
9610680	9616600	thing i'm just worried that this is going to be a beacon for like trolls it's just like hey let's
9616600	9622040	this this is a good place to focus our energy like and yeah you know i think they can accomplish it
9622040	9627240	it's just it's gonna take a whole hell a lot of moderation if he's done this work with this week
9627240	9633880	in tech and worked in silicon valley before i think he well knows about that and the way i've
9633880	9639880	kind of seen this approached before is that you know usually if trolls come in um you pray for
9639880	9644360	them you you try to reach out through prayer and that sort of thing you know again i'm not i'm not
9644360	9648520	gonna speak on behalf of the church i'm not trying to say this but i'm just kind of in my experience
9648520	9656360	of watching this you know you try to still build a bridge even if somebody is a troll um they still
9656360	9660440	took a minute to walk into your church so to speak so what are you gonna do you're gonna preach at
9660440	9665320	him right so he may still be trying to build a bridge maybe again i don't speak for this guy
9665320	9669400	but i'm thinking he may be trying to build a bridge with trolls and so forth as well
9669960	9675080	um so who knows anyway i just thought you know honestly it's funny because i was reminded of
9675080	9682360	the movie sister act and what's one of the key plot points in sister act you have the old school
9682360	9688520	versus the new school right you have maggie smith playing you know the the mother mother hand or
9688520	9693880	whatever or mother superior right of the of the um nuns and she wants to do things very old school
9693880	9698600	she wants everything to be traditional she wants everything to be very you know by the book i
9698600	9703000	became a nun so i could live this particular life and then when whoopi goldberg comes in because
9703000	9709240	she's being hidden there by the cops she has this whole different approach to it where she's she
9709240	9714280	brings her lounge club experience into it where she's like we could put some butts in these seats
9714280	9719560	if we were to actually like modernize what we're doing and at the end of the day the priest in a
9719560	9725160	way or the the deacon of the church or whatever kind of sides with whoopi's character whereas
9725160	9732200	he's still trying to um be respectful to the history and what's happening by trying to um you
9732200	9736520	know be respectful of maggie smith's character so yes i just took a gaming story and compared it to
9736520	9741640	sister act but god damn it it works because the plot of that movie was about how they were
9741640	9748600	reaching out and making more people um interested in faith and religion by making it accessible
9748600	9753800	yeah and doggone it that's what this guy's trying to do in a way so you know again say what you want
9753800	9760920	to say about organized religion and all that but i i have to admire this guy's approach this guy
9760920	9770840	gets it in i think a way that a lot of his peers in the church don't so props to you dude best of
9770840	9776040	luck i hope it works out for you i think we all want to create a space sometimes for like-minded
9776040	9783080	individuals and sometimes that might be like a lgbtq plus and so forth safe space that might be
9783080	9787720	a place to talk about religion and so forth you know and as long as you're not kicking other
9787720	9796760	people down while you do it go for it so anyway bobby blackwolf and chat now that's funny bobby
9796760	9801400	blackwolf and chat with an excellent like troll ish but genuinely funny comment that says is he
9801400	9808840	building the bridge with wood or cobblestone minecraft this is about minecraft minecraft joke
9808840	9815000	cobblestone it's much more readily available all right let's take the conversation back to satan
9815000	9822520	uh dark sakura you have a story about a scary thing right me i made might have been scary um
9822520	9830600	so there is a uh a series of tweets that were going out trying to get the uh writer and producer
9830600	9837000	alana pierce to ask just basically deliver anything about silent hills that's a quote
9837640	9844760	that we didn't already know now that it's you know never coming out and so um the post reply
9844760	9849480	was i heard that silent hills would require you to sign a waiver before playing because it would
9849480	9854760	somehow interact with your real world self like by sending you emails or text messages as characters
9854760	9863720	from the game even when you weren't actively playing that is nuts can you imagine and that's
9863720	9869880	totally doable in this you know if all you have to do is give that game facebook access
9869880	9873880	and it'll pull from your facebook it can pull your phone number and your email and this type
9873880	9877240	of stuff and there's going to be people that blindly hit the button and do that
9877240	9884760	like remember remember hadeo kachima made that game metal gear solid that did something really
9884760	9891880	like psycho twisted when it would read your memory card i see you're a fan of konami games
9891880	9898040	exactly and it would like actually it mentioned games like that hadn't come out yet so or just
9898040	9901560	you know it would read like sweet koden you have a sense of adventure or things like that like
9901560	9906840	you would read the save files that were on your ps1 card sweet koden wasn't out yet yeah something
9906840	9910680	and so if you played it after sweet koden came out and it read the save file for it and then
9910680	9913800	get your comment but yeah they had a couple games on there that hadn't been out yet yeah
9914440	9920520	so uh just i mean so the fact that hadeo kajima potentially if this is to be believed
9920520	9925880	kind of was taking that to the next level with like what else do i inadvertently have access to
9925880	9929880	in this day and age that i could really scare the shit out of someone with like can you imagine
9930440	9934120	you are done with this game like you had to turn the game off because you were too scared
9934120	9938040	and then one of the you you fucking get a text message on your phone that pretends to be one
9938040	9944600	of the characters in the game i would die like that is that is that's awesome though that is
9944600	9949640	like wow what would you think if you were suddenly being texted and harassed by characters
9949880	9960120	bitch i'm at work do not disturb that would be me or just reply stop yeah which if you get marketing
9960120	9965640	text messages you can reply stop to get removed from them just letting y'all know yeah but the
9965640	9971080	the thing is is that you know we know we know kojima is looking to do another as as he says
9971080	9977800	the scariest horror game so maybe we're gonna eventually get at least a spiritual sequel to
9977880	9985400	the silent hill franchise i think maybe it'll be called like like uh quiet mountain it's just
9985400	9990120	it's gonna take all the ideas he had for silent hills and just put them in a new universe i'm sure
9990120	9995000	and nova has norman reading it read us in it maybe and his butt if he's available in his butt
9996440	10000040	i wonder if he's got a nice butt i wonder if he'll still team up with guillermo del toro
10000040	10006120	wow i i want this and i want it to have the fish man in it yeah i just people do need to
10006120	10014040	let the silent shape of water i mean honestly if konami wanted to earn a lot of points i don't
10014040	10019800	ever see them doing this but i'm just gonna say it they could just let him have the franchise
10019800	10023720	and i realize there's been a lot of bad blood between him and konami but a few years has been
10023720	10027960	a shit to a few years have passed at this point and konami you notice has been slowly trying to
10027960	10032120	turn the wheel in a new direction and get some positive press and i would say if konami wanted
10032120	10037880	to get some real positive press then all they would need to do is just say hey look you can
10037880	10043320	make you we will license the silent hill to you for a five percent cut a ten percent cut or
10043320	10047720	whatever and you can make the game you wanted to make or whatever i think would get a lot of stock
10047720	10051560	back in konami but that's to say if kojima even wanted to do it because kojima would have a right
10051560	10056440	to say no fuck them and you know make his own thing that had many of the same ideas and that's
10056440	10061720	that's he has the right to do that there's a really good video about pt and about the things
10061720	10067720	that he was putting references to that when the nda got lifted that make a lot of sense like
10067720	10072840	certain numbers that you would see in there or like the commentary of the fetus in the in the
10072840	10079320	sink how it was talking about something it goes back to how konami was treating him and you know
10079320	10083160	getting pushed out of his positions and whatnot it was a very interesting theory interesting that
10083160	10089800	the talking baby was a common theme between those two things baby doesn't talk oh i guess
10090760	10095320	he doesn't he doesn't talk does he okay there are all kinds of ghost babies
10096680	10100600	all right well moving on just a few more stories for you guys then we'll quickly check in on
10100600	10106200	discord and see if anybody wants to call in for tonight um over at uh uh vog network dot com slash
10106200	10111400	discord in our green room so there was a rom hack for fire emblem called midnight sun that was in
10111400	10117960	development but then canceled uh back in 2017 uh but now the folks that were behind that
10118440	10125400	have a new game called path of the midnight sun and it's kind of a spiritual successor to that
10125400	10132120	it's now more of like a visual novel but it also has some tactical combat like fire emblem in there
10132120	10138440	and they even have some of the same voice actors from the fire emblem series and even pokemon
10138440	10144120	that are lending their uh talents to the game itself and if that sounds like something that
10144120	10148840	you might be interested in well they have it up on kickstarter now and it's supposed to be
10148840	10155400	out by the end of next year on pc mac and the switch so you can go check that out path of the
10155400	10165560	midnight sun and it looks interesting definitely um it reminds me a little bit of fire emblem just
10165560	10171720	based on the animation and everything but that's always fascinating when um like a mod it kind of
10171720	10176440	spins off and becomes its own game because this isn't the first time this has happened hello dota
10176440	10181800	right why is there why is there no dota 1 there's only dota 2 because dota 1 was a warcraft 3 mod
10181800	10187000	so you know mods do spin off and become games sometimes it's uh and that's that's not all uh
10187000	10191560	team fortress was originally a quake mod you know a lot of that valve stuff you know they acquired
10191560	10197080	big modders and then helped them make their own games so it's kind of neat yep yeah all right
10197080	10200120	i'll have to check that out at some point even though i'm not really super into the tactical
10200200	10207080	rpgs but i think it's kind of a neat neat thing anyway um i'm sure a lot of you guys have been
10207080	10212600	following what's going on in other news and the announcement of the cyber truck did you guys see
10212600	10218280	the uh unveiling from elon musk of the cyber truck uh with the the shatterproof windows and all that
10218280	10224200	stuff anyway uh a lot of people commented that wow the cyber truck looks like something i would
10224200	10230040	have seen like in a 90s uh virtual racing type of game like a low polygon type of game
10230040	10234840	and now guess what's happening that car is being hacked into many different video games
10234840	10240760	including it's so hard to to recreate the model of the truck golden eye 007 is one of the more
10240760	10246280	prominent ones out there where you can actually uh have a mod you know for your golden eye game
10246280	10250600	that will put the cyber truck into the game which let's be real that truck does kind of look like
10250600	10256200	something out of a james bond film so this one makes the most sense so yeah it does kind of look
10256200	10261880	like a um stunt fx or what was hard driving hard driving car from hard drive well i thought you
10261880	10268120	know when um yeah when uh jamie was talking about virtual racing i'm like yeah i can see that yeah
10268120	10274120	for sure so that's cute that that truck has been hacked into everything and that's uh that's the
10274120	10279720	type of thing that modders do for the lulz so there you go all right um we are going to make
10279720	10285800	our way to discord so we can try to grab some calls tonight so let's see if we can actually
10285800	10289720	uh get that call here because we do have somebody waiting hello you're on orange launch radio who's
10289720	10296440	this hey uh this is mel mayhem how's it going hello hello metal mayhem and happy uh black
10296440	10301880	friday shopping weekend to you i'm sure you are uh having a great time of it did you know that
10301880	10308680	that's also the name of a pinball heavy metal mayhem oh no i wasn't aware of that i thought
10308680	10312280	for a second there she was talking about black friday shopping weekend i thought i was like
10312280	10316280	there's a black friday pinball machine what i know black hole all right anyway what's that what's on
10316280	10323400	your mind tonight buddy oh since you brought it up idly enough it's more or less the topic of my
10323400	10334920	you know you know a call in a very broad sense um now um since it's um you know black parties
10334920	10340840	you know cyber monday weekend and everyone's on buying guests either from themselves or for
10340840	10347880	others or what have you i would like to ask you this um not just during this weekend but
10347880	10356600	over the course of 2019 have you bought you know defeat any of you uh but uh bought some
10356600	10364040	games for yourselves or for others you know you know during a major sale you know did you
10364040	10369560	particularly love they're getting out the game doesn't necessarily have to have to have been uh
10370360	10377640	released this year just hit had to be on make uh available during uh during a sale and sure
10377640	10382200	sure i get what you're doing with that um what do you guys think is there uh a game that you've
10382200	10390040	bought in a sale this year um that you particularly enjoyed and and thought was a good deal um i did
10390040	10393480	say i didn't get death stranding on sale i was hoping it would go on sale this weekend but it
10393480	10400040	never did i did buy a music sequencer program on steam um because i was watching some how-to videos
10400040	10406280	on youtube and it looked pretty um relatively easy to use um and i was i liked that it made chiptune
10406280	10410760	songs and things of that nature so i thought it was relatively cheap it was probably like 14 bucks
10410760	10415080	for the program and the suit and i'm sorry i forget the name in the moment um if i i haven't
10415080	10421240	made anything with it yet so if i do i will let you know what it was called um but um yeah i
10421320	10423960	thought that would be fun to toy around with because you know i've been looking for some
10423960	10429080	new musical interludes here at olr and um i know jamie has a lead as well but maybe we want to have
10429880	10433640	other musical interludes as well so it depends on how difficult it is to use
10433640	10439160	um i used to do music stuff many many many many many years ago i don't exactly have a resume i
10439160	10443880	was in marching band so i can read sheet music but that's about you know the extent of it but
10443880	10449960	um yeah i'll be curious to tinker around with it and see what i can do so um that was one thing
10449960	10454680	i picked up this weekend as far as like all year in a sale or anything like that oh i remember i
10454680	10459400	know i'll say horizon zero dawn um i picked that up a couple months ago they were having a pretty
10459400	10464520	deep sale on playstation and i got the entire collection for like 20 bucks and that was one of
10464520	10469160	those series that i wasn't sure if i'd be really into it but um it was a it was a good game i i
10469160	10474280	didn't beat it because i never seem to beat games but i sunk plenty hours into it and i enjoyed what
10474280	10479160	i played um it's kind of you know that open world action type of thing like breath of the wild tomb
10479160	10484040	raider-esque type of thing um yeah i enjoyed that so i would say that was a pleasant surprise i
10484040	10489720	picked up a really good deal i think 20 bucks for that whole package was really good anything that
10489720	10495240	comes to mind for you guys not really i didn't buy anything this sale um the last game i bought
10495240	10503080	was black future 88 and still haven't gone around to playing it yet um by the way horizon zero dawn
10503080	10507160	is now down to fifteen dollars on this black friday sale so i mean if you're looking for
10507160	10511560	something on playstation 4 uh it's a pretty good one you don't want to pass up although
10511560	10515720	imagine if you wait long enough it's going to be a playstation plus game but well i want to say i
10515720	10522360	think super beat zonic was 99 cents at one time oh it was and then i picked that up so that's a
10522360	10529480	pretty good deal still haven't played it because i don't really get access to my switch anymore but
10529480	10540440	um yeah that's really it i buy a lot of weird stuff i buy a lot of um courses in udemy i was
10540440	10546280	disappointed that some of the expansion music for dj max uh respect weren't on sale because
10546280	10550200	i didn't realize that game was still doing expansions because they recently did a crossover
10550200	10554040	with groove coaster and i was interested in picking it up but the music the music expansions
10554040	10559240	in that game are pretty pricey and also just on a random tangent i saw a news article that dj
10559240	10564200	max respect is apparently coming to pc later this year um which is exciting but at the same time i'm
10564200	10567720	like that's going to be too much money they're going to want way too much money for it so i
10567720	10572360	hope they charge the right price for it so we'll see oh yeah pixel pocket says is it really rob
10572360	10576520	yeah i saw i saw a news article on that just a few days ago they just announced it like maybe
10576520	10581000	six days ago or something that there's going to be a dj max respect on pc if you look up if you um
10582360	10587160	excuse me if you go to like news.google where you can search for news trends just look for dj max it
10587160	10590280	should be one of the top stories that comes up so you can read they haven't said a lot about it
10590280	10595320	like we don't uh it's steam it's gonna be on steam that's all we know um but there's no page on steam
10595320	10600280	for it yet or anything like that so uh we're getting some answers from our chat uh quest
10600280	10605640	buster says valkyrie chronicles 4 for the ps4 is just 20 bucks really fun strategy game so there
10605640	10610440	you go um uh dark soccer anything that comes to mind for you i don't know if there's been any
10610440	10617080	fun deals that you've jumped in on not really yeah i mean i um i've just been basically grabbing
10617560	10624280	stuff and waiting for detroit to come out oh yeah better than that like i don't have any real games
10624280	10630040	coming out that i want to play until animal crossing okay so i'm not i haven't really been
10630040	10634920	deal hunting i've more been looking on the practical side of of gifts all right uh anything
10634920	10641240	else you have for us tonight middle man no they'll be it uh i'll try to clear up the line because i
10641240	10647400	can see two other people don't want to call in yeah yeah you too thanks so much for the call
10647400	10651960	yeah i definitely want to squeeze some other calls in but thank you buddy take care all right let's
10651960	10657000	get to some more calls here i'll go to this one next hi you're on orange launch radio who's this
10658760	10667000	hi it's yyr hello my friend yyr how are you oh pretty good how you doing i am great what's on
10667000	10671080	your mind tonight i'm trying to get you in the next caller in here so we can wrap up so not to
10671480	10677880	but maybe a little what's up no i uh i won't take up too much of your time i just uh first off want
10677880	10685000	to say you know congrats on 800 etc etc appreciate that my friend if you guys still have fun doing
10685000	10692200	this in a little over two years we'll be back to say congrats on 900 but uh i digress uh i did want
10692200	10699560	to mention something uh follow up to robert m's email earlier about uh you know the mac os support
10699560	10707640	basically what's happened is uh apple is trying to raise the security of mac os uh i'm not sure
10707640	10713080	if it's just because they want to protect their users from any and all uh avenues that malware
10713080	10720840	could get in or if they're just looking at iphone and ipad and saying well we get a a 30 cut of
10720840	10729240	everything they sell on there why not mac os too but for whatever reason they have a new thing
10729240	10738600	called notarization and starting uh with this new version of mac os that came out recently in
10738600	10748120	october uh all new apps have to be notarized uh which is a process you have to do directly with
10748120	10758680	apple otherwise they will not run now the thing is they temporarily relaxed these restrictions until
10758680	10765880	this coming january and one thing we noticed is that you know developing a mac game and running
10765880	10772920	it through steam it doesn't seem to go through some of the restrictive checks that other you know
10772920	10780840	applications do like if you had just distributed it say on your website uh so for all i know in
10780840	10786040	january my two games are going to stop working if you have the latest version of the operating
10786040	10793720	system i have no idea apple isn't saying anything valve has no clue either so i uh
10793720	10799800	yes yes i know how to notarize i see dark sakura put the link in chat but here's the kicker if you
10799800	10805800	want to be able to notarize your app you have to have an active developer account with apple which
10805800	10816520	means 99 a year yeah i i can tell you right now there is no uh i i am not making 99 a year on my
10816520	10821960	mac stuff you have a you have a baby to consider in that stuff so you gotta you know all those
10821960	10829080	costs uh certainly add up um well there are a lot of mass developers who are just not happy about
10829080	10834360	this for what it's worth the show computer is running catalina so i'm happy to test for you on
10834360	10840520	january 1st what happens um for what it's worth um but what's interesting is that um i think we've
10840520	10846920	run into a similar error i'm not sure if it has to do with security but like obs has some issues
10846920	10851960	i have to launch it from terminal in order to be able to get it to work um there still is not a
10851960	10859640	workaround on obs's front so um i don't know what is going on um so thank you for some of that
10859640	10864360	insight i mean i can you know i can certainly get where you know apple has a reputation of
10864360	10869880	being a safe platform where um pcs are usually the ones that get targeted by like viruses trojans
10869880	10874360	etc and so forth so um you know apple wants to kind of protect that because i think we've been
10874360	10879080	hearing in the past year we hear of it happening a little more on the mac platform still not yeah
10879080	10883880	you know the same ratios pc we've been hearing about it more so i think apple may have kind of
10883880	10889400	really clamped down on that in an effort to stay kind of that pristine clean little platform that
10889400	10893160	it is but unfortunately some more of this independent stuff is getting a little bit
10893160	10899640	left out in the cold as a result so um fingers crossed that it'll work i'm messaging you on
10899640	10907160	facebook about something so uh okay i'll make sure to log into facebook then okay yeah yeah
10907160	10912360	that's why she's gonna tell you all right but yeah i'm uh you're gonna see probably over the
10912360	10918120	next few months a lot of independent developers drop support for mac unfortunately uh simply
10918120	10923160	because you know they don't want to have to maintain an active subscription but i could be
10923160	10927880	wrong but we'll see yeah we'll see what happens it'll be interesting to see uh what develops but
10927880	10933160	i did not realize january was as soon as that was happening so that's less than a month away so
10933160	10937880	could be interesting and i don't know if it's january 1st january 30th nobody's saying anything
10937880	10942040	so we'll just figure it out all right we'll keep an eye on it well thank you for the follow-up
10942040	10947000	yyr and appreciate again everything you've done for you you've literally made our dreams come
10947000	10951640	true over the years um so we just want you to know how much you're appreciated and you're a
10951640	10955880	big part of how we got this far so thank you so much my friend i don't know if i would have gotten
10955880	10960680	this far without you guys either so thanks for that and uh have a great week we help each other
10960680	10966120	out take care my friend bye-bye see you later all right let's try to get one more call here before
10966120	10970360	we call it a night uh hi you're on orange long training who's this hey what's going on everybody
10970360	10974360	it is ron it is good to hear from you rama but i'm going to have us keep it quick tonight what's
10974360	10982440	on your mind first off i want to say happy 800. thank you my friend um to also touch back on
10982440	10989000	reference to jimmy fallon i can say i have seen some of the tech that they talk about on the show
10989000	10997560	that's the most i can release it okay meaning you know something bringing like newer tech and gaming
10997560	11002520	and so forth let's just say i've been in areas where you know they put stuff that they had on
11002520	11009640	the show up in store i've seen some of it so yeah all right good to know you probably have
11009640	11015880	observed a lot of interesting things over the year but we'll leave it at that cool and lastly i have
11015880	11023880	a switch i'm sorry say that again mr smoosh was trying to be heard over you i have a switch oh
11023880	11027960	congratulations of course yes because i got the friend request on the switch and of course you
11027960	11033960	picked luigi as your icon thank you um so um yeah congratulations what are you playing on it
11034680	11042760	right now mario kart 8 i picked up um starlink because it was like 10 bucks and i also picked up
11042760	11047720	a collection of mon those are some really good choices because you have a little bit of old
11047720	11052120	school you have a little bit of deep discounts you have some new school in there as well and i
11052120	11057000	also i also picked up links awakening i forgot yeah uh did anything in particular finally sway
11057080	11061480	you into the switch like now was it the free game of mario kart that finally got you in or what
11061480	11068520	what swayed you from e3 seeing a collection of mana because one of the games uh secret of mana
11068520	11073160	got me through a real rough time in my teenage years which is part of the reason why i picked
11073160	11078600	up a snest classic but this along with links awakening which was one of my personal favorite
11078600	11084680	zelda games so i'm just like god damn it nintendo here's my money have you touched trials of mana
11084680	11091400	or second sense of three yet i have not be sure to get in on that i was uh very pleasantly
11091400	11095640	surprised with that i need again on my list of games i need to finish but i did it i did
11095640	11099880	a pretty good decent amount of streaming like probably good four or five hours into that game
11099880	11103800	and uh it was great i had a good time i'm looking forward to a little redo i hope they learn some
11103800	11109080	things from the secret of mana redo same here but unfortunately i can't play the game i can't
11109080	11112920	play my switch as much because when i was coming back from mako channels i accidentally left my
11112920	11118840	charger behind oh no well the good news is it's a universal like for once nintendo is using like
11118840	11124520	universal stuff so as long as you have like a usb-c cable i think it is um you can charge it
11124520	11131400	with like anything so um you should say that because i'm doing that right now and according
11131400	11136920	to my switch it's not enough power so i think i have to go out and get another adapter so we
11136920	11141240	will see damn well best of luck to you i hope uh you're able to find the magic thing that gets a
11141240	11144520	chart yeah it probably needs to put out a certain amount of voltage that maybe whatever you're using
11144520	11149640	isn't doing but then again i also picked up another tablet while i got myself the certain
11149640	11155560	8 gig surface go which has a surface charger it also charges my usb-c so i do have to pick up
11155560	11159880	another charger so well there you go so maybe maybe that'll work so just make sure it's a
11159880	11162680	yeah if you're trying to do it like through a computer or through a plate it probably won't
11162680	11167080	be enough juice to enough voltage to do it but i bet if you get a pretty decent brick
11167080	11170280	um that can really pump some voltage through it i bet it'll i bet it'll work
11171480	11175960	that's what i'm thinking so you know for the time being i'm just letting it be until mocotron
11175960	11182040	ships it to me you know so i can because i am enjoying it i i can see the difference between
11182040	11187880	playing on a small screen and a large screen which i enjoy but since i'm kind of disappointed so
11187880	11192680	oh bobby also with an excellent suggestion suggesting a bypass the dock the dock is
11192680	11198120	going to require a higher voltage than just the system itself so uh if you plug directly
11198120	11200840	into the system you might be able to get away with it on whatever you're using now
11201560	11205400	yeah but you know but i will have to use the regular charger so i can actually play it on
11205400	11209880	the tv so of course understandable all right my friend i'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up but
11209880	11213880	thank you so much for the call hey no problem y'all take care stay awesome take care my friend
11213880	11221160	bye all right so i think with that we're through everything in the uh discord channel so thank you
11221160	11225000	lots of calls tonight thank you so much for that uh we do want to start to move to wrap up here
11225000	11228520	though since this is close to 9 30. i do have to ask if there's any last minute stories just
11228520	11232520	yeah i don't want to leave anything out all right yes i have a couple things so the first one being
11232520	11241480	that um the company beat games who as the developer of beat saber i think this news broke
11241480	11246920	during the show last week i feel like but maybe maybe not i thought it was a thing that broke
11246920	11251240	during the show but go ahead they were acquired by facebook yeah so now if you want to get that
11251240	11256520	beat saber action you're gonna have to do it on through oculus i guess well well they're gonna
11256520	11260040	no because i remember talking about they're gonna continue to support all the platforms that are
11260040	11265400	out there now so they're not gonna like pull it from whatever yeah but if there's a beat saber 2
11265400	11269320	or you know who knows but you know minecraft is a microsoft product and they still
11270120	11275880	runs great on nintendo there's still a playstation 4 version yeah but microsoft versus facebook
11277880	11283800	fair i'm not the biggest facebook fan but let's let's wait until something actually happens before
11283800	11289000	we say doomsday and then in acquisition news as well we have slightly mad studios uh the
11289000	11294680	developers project car is being acquired by code masters which you know code masters has a lot of
11294680	11300280	their own uh driving franchises so like i said it kind of makes sense yeah that's it money money
11300280	11305640	money all right so that's it for last minute stories so it brings our show just about to a
11305640	11310280	close uh we're gonna go around and get everybody's final thoughts but again here on this 800th
11310280	11314440	episode of our show just want to thank you guys for being here whether it's live whether it's on
11314440	11319240	the podcast you know you guys really make up this show and keep us going um so i really can't thank
11319240	11324280	you enough thank you for your participation and uh you know it's funny because why we are set on
11324280	11328760	that call if we do this for two more years we'll be celebrating 900 and i'm thinking in the back
11328760	11334040	of my head if we do it for four more years we'll get to a thousand we should do it wouldn't that
11334040	11339400	be something we'll try Guinness we'll try yeah hey Guinness do the thing and then you know what
11339400	11344760	if we get to a thousand i'll fucking call Guinness but i'll do it before that well here's the thing
11344760	11350520	there's other shows that have hit a thousand episodes but they do more than one a week like
11350520	11355000	i can think of a couple podcasts that like during e3 week they'll release like 20 episodes we've
11355000	11361640	been around longer than everybody that is still yeah that's still going regularly weekly yes i
11361640	11368760	think there is a show that did something then stopped for a long time then came back
11369320	11374120	but i shouldn't count it yeah i'm not counting that we're the longest continuously weekly show
11374120	11383000	without a major break so all right anyhow yeah uh dark diseases 2022 is 20 years yeah that would be
11383880	11388040	that be yeah that'd be about three years i mean it doesn't line up you would think oh there's
11388040	11393240	about 50 give or take weeks in a year shouldn't you be on episode it would be what like 850 by
11393240	11397800	now but just you know shit happens like we miss two weeks here and there we go on vacation things
11397800	11403240	happen you know so we don't but most of your shows out there like you know if you're watching things
11403240	11408680	on netflix what you get like 10 episodes of stranger things a year uh and even regular series
11408680	11413400	shows you get what like 26 episodes maybe yeah i might have to wait until 2020 for the end of
11414040	11419560	um the good place damn it oh oh did they go on a break i i'm still time to catch up on season
11419560	11425960	three i'm really behind oh you're on season three oh so swung tong says vgn is just this
11425960	11431560	long-running issue but they all go on hiatus a lot no disrespect to those hard-working fellows
11431560	11437560	over there but um as you pointed out they do go on hiatus a lot so um i think they went like a year
11437560	11445000	at least uh with a break um also we did start on life 365 just before i think they got started
11445000	11451720	in 03 or 04 uh our first episode was june of 2002 again i mean no disrespect um and i think
11451720	11455960	everything that they've accomplished should be celebrated as well it is not easy to keep your
11455960	11464360	show going one year let alone 17 so anyway um bobby blackwell says they claim to be the oldest
11464360	11470280	video game podcast well unfortunately um that is i want to see the receipts show me an episode
11470280	11475720	that you did before june of 2002 that was branded that same way because i don't think it exists
11475720	11482760	sorry and again even if it did as been pointing out there's been been a lot of long breaks so
11483320	11489000	all right and also sorry again i'm gonna sound like i'm being rude and i'm really not but i do
11489000	11493960	believe at one point the name of that show has changed because they weren't about video games
11493960	11502440	for a while um so just kind of just have to say that sorry anyway um let's see did i get final
11502440	11505960	thoughts no i was i was ramping up and saying thanks for all that stuff and all that good stuff
