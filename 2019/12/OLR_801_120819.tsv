7000	14000	Here's your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	19000	This week Nintendo disappoints those who paid way too much for an SNES classic as some of its titles start coming in
19000	22000	Nintendo Switch Online's SNES Simulator, but really, are we surprised?
22000	28000	This is just one headline where everything old is new again, stay tuned for the rest starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice
28000	32000	Orange Lounge Radio
32000	37000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice
37000	44000	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 801 for this December the 8th of 2019
44000	53000	My name is Rob Roberts and joining me here in our studio as always to talk about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, and many many many tangents
53000	56000	Is DarkSakura or Jamie Summers?
56000	57000	Hi.
57000	58000	Hi, how are you?
58000	59000	Full.
59000	60000	Full, yes, thank you.
60000	65000	Oh, I had the box sitting over here, but I just threw it away, but you brought me just a little bit of panda.
65000	69000	Well, I still have more panda if you want some green bean chicken.
69000	71000	Not panda meat, but panda the restaurant.
71000	74000	I still have another egg roll left too.
74000	78000	Maybe later, maybe later. I think I've had plenty enough for now, but yeah.
78000	85000	And all of a sudden I just realized that after I went and bought the food that I'm making beef stew at home in a crock pot, like a big ass thing of it.
85000	88000	Yep, luckily this show's like three hours long, so you might be hungry again by the time you get home.
88000	98000	Well, I started it at like one, so it's by the time I get home it'll be good and ready, but like I even forgot to put wine in it drink.
98000	107000	So I actually made sangria with the rest of the wine because I don't like Merlot and it's a Merlot blend, but it's what I had because I gave away my Beaujolais.
107000	108000	Beaujolais is my favorite red.
108000	111000	So I'm assuming you have like a crock pot sitting out with all this in it?
111000	112000	Yeah.
112000	114000	It is the season for that type of cooking.
114000	118000	That's what I thought, but I've made everything from scratch down to the broth.
118000	119000	Wow.
119000	125000	I made vegetable broth with my leftover veggie scraps and then I took that broth and cooked down soup bones.
125000	126000	Oh.
126000	127000	So there you go.
127000	128000	There you go. Cooking with Dark Sakura.
128000	129000	Yep.
129000	131000	Maybe, maybe a spinoff show coming soon to vlog. We'll see.
131000	133000	I kind of been thinking about it actually.
133000	134000	Really?
134000	135000	Yeah.
135000	140000	I would love that. I will come over and help you film it to get some VODs for the Twitch channel and potentially YouTube. I think that'd be fun.
141000	143000	I'll overtake Nerdy Nummies as the...
143000	147000	I think it should be you, but I think your co-stars should be puppets.
147000	152000	And the puppets can be used by Techmaster Loki, also sitting here in studio.
152000	153000	I'm using the puppets?
153000	155000	No, like you're the puppeteer.
155000	156000	Oh, I'm doing the puppeteering?
156000	157000	You're doing the puppets, yeah.
157000	159000	I think there's people that have done it way better than I have.
159000	160000	That's true.
160000	161000	I saw one of those today.
161000	162000	Yeah?
162000	163000	Harlow.
163000	164000	Oh?
164000	167000	He's a YouTuber, but his character is a puppet.
167000	168000	Oh, okay.
168000	173000	So he was doing the panel today, and he has the puppet talking. It's cute.
173000	181000	Well, now we couldn't talk about puppeteers and not acknowledge the passing, because a lot of people were talking about this today, the passing of the great Carol Spinney from Sesame Street, which is interesting.
181000	184000	So for those that are watching on Twitch, and you always see those little...
184000	195000	And for those listening on the podcast, we always have a little parody intro that's taken from the old TV show, You Can't Do That on Television, where a show is preempted to bring you orange on its radio.
195000	197000	So it's like a throwback to that.
197000	200000	Usually these Rs are a video game theme for obvious reasons.
200000	210000	So Jason is out of town or at an event today or something, so he usually does them on Sunday, but he told me yesterday, he's like, I gotta lock it in tonight because I'm doing this other thing tomorrow, which is fine.
210000	213000	So I was like, what do I wanna do?
213000	218000	And a story about Streets of Rage 4 popped on my feed, and I was like, oh, let's do Sesame Streets of Rage.
218000	220000	Had no idea that the...
220000	222000	So that was the little intro for tonight.
222000	227000	I had no idea that that unfortunate news about Carol Spinney would come across today, and I'm like, ooh, now does that look tacky?
227000	231000	Luckily I put Grover and Elmo in it. I didn't put Big Bird in it, so...
231000	234000	Or Oscar the Grouch, or I think, what was any of his characters?
234000	241000	What's just funny is I had watched a YouTube video with him and with a few other people as to how the Muppets are operated.
241000	242000	Oh.
242000	249000	And so he was talking about how to activate, how to do Big Bird and also his understudy for Big Bird.
249000	257000	It's always fascinating when you see those behind the scenes of Sesame Street and you see just how the street is so elevated
257000	263000	because obviously a lot of the puppeteering is happening underneath in a basement type of thing. I don't know how else to describe it.
263000	264000	Like a trench.
264000	265000	Yeah, but it's fascinating.
265000	266000	Well, that's how Alf was done. Did you know that?
266000	267000	How what?
267000	268000	Alf.
268000	269000	Oh, I'm not surprised at all.
269000	275000	But it was apparently really dangerous for the cast because of all the various holes throughout the floor
275000	279000	so that they could have it modular and move around with the puppet.
279000	280000	That's why blocking is important.
280000	282000	Blocking is very important.
282000	290000	With all the 80s and 90s things that are coming back, I just read a thing today that Reno 911, I guess, is coming back to some mobile apps.
290000	291000	Yes.
291000	294000	Yeah, right? Although, I don't know. I was like, what the hell is this network?
294000	302000	And it's some new mobile app, which is like short, I guess, I think they're trying to capitalize on TikTok, but it's like professional ones.
302000	305000	Because it's like 10 minute shorts. It's like short attention span theater.
305000	309000	And I'm like, if Reno 911 is going to be 10 minute shorts, I don't know.
309000	312000	Well, then again, I don't know. The original show kind of it was like.
312000	313000	Yeah.
313000	317000	So I'll be happy for an alternative to TikTok with their recent controversy.
317000	318000	You know about that, right?
318000	322000	Oh, with the whole China owns them and oh, the LGBTQ content.
323000	332000	Not just not just LGBTQ plus, but anyone in any kind of disability spectrum.
332000	333000	Yeah.
333000	337000	What they think is people who could be prone to bullying, but what they're doing is actually silencing their voices.
337000	343000	Yeah. You know, I made a TikTok account because I wanted to support one of the local drag kings that I know that uses it.
343000	344000	And for Don.
344000	345000	For Don. Yeah.
345000	349000	And so because Don's doing a lot of content on TikTok, so I was like, OK, I'll follow.
349000	352000	Shout out to Don Davenport, one of my faves, local drag king.
352000	357000	So I wanted to follow Don's TikTok and I was like, oh, maybe I'll get into this.
357000	364000	I'll use it. And like the day after I posted my first TikTok, everybody was like, do you know that there's all these issues with this platform?
364000	366000	And I was like, oh, well, maybe not.
366000	372000	Like, I'll support Don and what Don wants to do, but maybe I'll stick to Twitch and some of the platforms that I'm using.
372000	373000	Never making an account.
374000	381000	I'm still getting used to WTSocial because it has a potential to really work, though, a lot like LiveJournal did.
381000	384000	Yeah, WTSocial, I think, is way too complicated for the common person right now.
384000	392000	And that's going to be very important if somebody is ever going to snatch Facebook's crown, is that I think you have to have a platform that's very easy to use.
392000	398000	To tie this to video games, because I don't want you to think we're like, we do talk about video games, believe it or not, live.
398000	407000	Over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network for Voice of Geeks Network, that's VOG Network, every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
407000	415000	But talking about social networking games, you know, I feel like what you see built into Xbox and Microsoft's platform,
415000	421000	as well as the PlayStation 4, is heavily influenced by like a feed, like social media.
421000	426000	Like you log on to your PlayStation, you see kind of a rolling feed of, here's what your friends are playing.
426000	428000	Hey, Rob just unlocked a trophy.
428000	433000	Dark Sakura just started playing Detroit for the first time or whatever it happens to be, right?
433000	435000	So it'll kind of show you what's going on.
435000	445000	It's kind of interesting that, you know, all that is really confined to either the Xbox app or, you know, in Sony's case, you know, the Sony stuff.
445000	453000	And it's not, they haven't tried to like push for anything bigger for like a gamer social network that, you know, ties into games.
453000	459000	And I mean, Nintendo, well, we all know they're never going to get, and they're just not, they're not going to get online.
459000	460000	Like it's just not going to happen.
460000	462000	Or not online the way people want them to be.
462000	468000	Yeah. I'm kind of surprised Microsoft hasn't really made a strong bid for the online social network space.
468000	471000	Or have they? Did they buy some company I just forgot about, that tanked?
471000	474000	I think they want it all to be in network, some of these companies.
474000	481000	They want you to have a reason to be exclusive to their system, unless you're just balling above all, and then you can do them all.
481000	488000	Well, think about it. If Microsoft were to do two key things, make Mixer more than just gaming, like Twitch has done.
488000	492000	Make it more than, which I think you can't, somebody can correct me in our chat if I'm wrong.
492000	500000	I think you can do stuff that's non-gaming on Mixer, but that end of it has really not taken off like it has on Twitch.
500000	508000	If you could kind of mix that on Mixer, hehe, with like a social network feed that Microsoft would run or whatever.
508000	514000	I would think there's a lot of power in something like that to take on Facebook Live and everything that Facebook does.
514000	519000	But it's just interesting, Microsoft kind of seems to be wanting to sit out of that space for whatever reason.
519000	523000	Okay, Bobby confirms. Thank you, Bobby, in our chat. Yes, there are IRL Mixer streamers.
523000	530000	I thought it was a thing, but you don't hear about it on that space as much as you do on the Twitch side of things.
530000	533000	I was just thinking, in general, how we talk about live streaming.
533000	540000	And do you remember how there was this big thing going on like for Xerox in the 80s where they're like, hey, don't use Xerox as a generic.
540000	542000	You're going to lose our branding. Right.
542000	550000	And how like for some reason, like a little like mostly in England when they refer to vacuuming as hoovering and Hoover's really a brand.
550000	555000	Now, live streaming, people forget there was a site called Live Stream.
555000	562000	Oh, yeah, there was. And that's where I used to stream my artwork when I was doing all my Mass Effect artwork.
562000	567000	But now this term has become a generic for things that you do on Twitch and Mixer and all these other things.
567000	571000	I was just thinking about it as like, do people actually remember the live stream site?
571000	582000	A similar type of thing happened to a podcasting because, you know, it was called that in the beginning before it was ever in iTunes or Apple embraced it
582000	590000	because the concept was downloading, you know, audio RSS, which is what it is, downloading audio RSS feed to your iPod.
590000	595000	I mean, because this was even maybe before iPhones were really everywhere, even Android or whatever you want to say in that space.
595000	601000	Smartphones were everywhere. And then, you know, Apple embraced it as podcasting as well and really put that out there.
601000	609000	And remember when Microsoft tried to get in it, they were like, it's Zune casts or other people would try to stop trying to make Zune happen.
609000	613000	OK, it didn't like that term podcast like it hasn't gone away.
613000	619000	And now it's generic. Google uses podcasts. Podcasts are now on Spotify.
619000	625000	You know, even though technically it's audio RSS, that common thing of podcast is everywhere.
625000	630000	Well, it's just funny the way the language works and branding works, really, to be perfectly honest.
630000	635000	When the branding is so strong, that's something that a company has to worry about.
635000	643000	Well, even like Nintendo has to deal with that, because, you know, how many times in, you know, the late 80s and mid 90s up to that,
643000	647000	your video game system, no matter what it was, was just called a Nintendo.
647000	651000	Or in the south, how every soft drink is a Coke.
651000	655000	And so, I mean, now we're getting actually more into the business side of things.
655000	660000	But I just thought it was funny that we talk about live streaming now, but who remembers the live stream website?
660000	662000	Right. But they weren't really the first, though.
662000	666000	No, they weren't, but they were probably the first big name in it.
666000	673000	A couple of comments from chat. Let's see. I believe it was DJ Rama S said the site is actually still around Vameo Bot live stream.
673000	682000	So technically it's still around. Some folks, excuse me, some folks talking about Ustream there.
682000	688000	And Bobby wanted to point out that podcasting, what they've done, what the culture has done to embrace the term,
688000	692000	even if, you know, you're like, I'm not touching Apple products or whatever, whatever you want to do.
692000	696000	Podcasting is for portable on demand. So pop.
696000	698000	Justify it to yourself however you want to.
698000	705000	So let's see. Pod culture says just try and find a damn Pepsi in Atlanta next to impossible.
705000	712000	Hard Rock Cafe. Bobby and I learned that one Dragon Con. Hard Rock Cafe still has Pepsi products in Atlanta.
712000	717000	I used to know where all the Pepsi products were in Mobile because I am not a Coke fan.
717000	723000	I will drink a Coke if that's what's there. But I prefer Pepsi. I'm saying this right now.
723000	727000	I would probably end up murdered by Victoria. No, I know. I understand.
727000	734000	But I I'm a Pepsi product kind of girl. I miss Josta. I prefer Josta plain Pepsi.
734000	741000	But I think the flavored Cokes like they have that blood orange Coke, the cinnamon Coke was actually pretty good.
741000	746000	They have all these different vanilla Coke, of course. I think all the flavors Pepsi existed, though, it did.
746000	751000	But I actually still preferred vanilla Coke, believe it or not. All the flavored Cokes are better.
751000	754000	There's that orange vanilla. That's OK.
754000	761000	Now, what I did like, though, was peach Coke that was out in Japan. I managed to pick it up at Nijia Market in San Francisco.
761000	765000	And I should have stocked up on that, even though it was full of sugar. It was delicious.
765000	767000	And I hate peaches, too, which is weird.
767000	775000	Akuma JP from Japan in our chat says, I thought Coke was the name of the drinks. Coca-Cola is the brand.
775000	782000	No, Coke. Coke is the name of the company. No, no. Coca-Cola. How does it work? Coca-Cola is the name of the company.
782000	785000	And their lead drink is Coke. Right.
785000	789000	Well, and actually the drink is technically Coca-Cola as well. Right.
789000	793000	But people would shorten it to Coke because, you know, like you do.
793000	798000	And so they ended up incorporating that into their branding. Right. With Coke, too.
798000	804000	Coke Zero. Coke classic. No, it's Coca-Cola classic. Oh, is it? I thought it is interesting.
804000	809000	But there was new Coke. And that was trying to be edgy. And now we have Coke Zero.
809000	814000	But I want to say that your diet is, it'll either be Diet Coke or Diet Coca-Cola.
814000	823000	And I think in some places it's actually Coca-Cola Lite. Or, I don't know, I know that Pepsi is technically Pepsi-Cola.
823000	826000	Right. By brand and by beverage. But it's their branding.
826000	830000	And this interesting metal mayhem in chat says Coke is to Coca-Cola like Rob is to Robert.
830000	834000	Yeah, I guess I guess that kind of works. I would say Cola is the generic name.
834000	838000	That's why you have things like RC Cola and Pepsi Cola is really what it is.
838000	847000	Because a cola is a type of beverage made from the certain ingredient, which is why Dr. Pepper isn't marketed as a cola.
847000	851000	Right. OK, wow. We got into brand discussion here on Orange D'Andrea.
851000	855000	What can we say? It's a slower. Are you shaking your head over there? It's a slower news week.
855000	863000	And don't forget Tiger Claw, who brings up Pepsi Zero. Don't forget in the 80s, if you remember your Back to the Future was Pepsi free.
863000	871000	RIP Crystal Pepsi, although it can stay buried in the version from the 90s, because when it came back, I was like, damn, this is really sugary.
871000	878000	You know what, though? One time after marching in Mardi Gras. So this is I was in 11th grade.
878000	885000	Last tangent and we're getting the game. They decided because this was when Crystal Pepsi was starting to go away.
885000	892000	They just gave us all cases of Crystal Pepsi to drink after it. We were so tired and worn out after all that marching.
892000	898000	We devoured all of it. It was gone. Nice. Yeah. And that's my story of Crystal Pepsi and Mardi Gras.
898000	902000	OK, perfect. It's also the same year I got beaned in the head with a Moon Pie.
902000	907000	Well, let's keep talking about brands. Why not? Let's let's stay on the brand message for a little bit here at the top.
907000	910000	See, it actually does relate a little bit to what I want to talk about here at the top of the show,
910000	915000	because a big brand in gaming is celebrating their 25th anniversary this week.
915000	921000	So this is going to make a lot of you out there go, fuck, I'm old, especially like if you're in your 30s.
921000	927000	And you might remember when you were a kid when the PlayStation first launched or you're me and you're in your 40s.
927000	931000	And you remember in high school when the PlayStation 1 first launched.
931000	936000	So the PlayStation celebrates 25 years this week.
936000	943000	And Sony has embraced the anniversary a little bit. They've labeled this on all their social media accounts,
943000	947000	of course, asking the questions, you know, what's your favorite PlayStation game or PlayStation memory?
947000	953000	And I will ask here in studio a little bit your memories of your first PlayStation console or first experience with PlayStation.
953000	958000	I'll come back to that in a minute. You can answer that in chat as well.
958000	965000	But also, they put together a nice little four minute video that was like one second of a bunch of major PlayStation games.
965000	967000	It would be an opportunity for me to me to play that here on Twitch.
967000	973000	But that video is like four minutes long. And you can go check that out on PlayStation's channel if you want.
973000	977000	The really important thing, though, that we should mention because of all of this festivities,
977000	981000	is that CEO Kaz Hirai came out and made another comment on Twitter.
981000	987000	And that was that's perfect. Oh, the other the retired comedy account. Yes. What did what did they say?
987000	994000	They congratulated all the Sony brands, of course, not mentioning the Vita because it's hilarious.
994000	999000	Yeah. And that is not interesting that Vita was left out of that video and PSP and all that stuff. Right.
999000	1004000	If I'm not mistaken, I don't know what that left. I didn't think it was anyhow.
1004000	1009000	So, yeah, they put out a neat little video and celebrating, you know, the 25 years of PlayStation.
1009000	1015000	Some interesting stories have come out about how, you know, that boot up noise on the original PlayStation
1015000	1019000	was actually a method of detecting if that was an authentic disk that was in there or not,
1019000	1029000	which you probably figured out if you ever put in a non Sony CD like a type of thing in there, like an audio CD,
1029000	1035000	you would hear that little boo doo doo, but you wouldn't hear the little whoosh and the kind of clip in reverse.
1035000	1040000	You wouldn't hear the second half of it because it would go right into the audio CD player when you would get that kind of thing.
1040000	1046000	Don't try. So don't try me because I have that as a ringtone on my phone. It was my alarm for the longest time.
1046000	1050000	Well, I'm kind of surprised that the Sony accounts or maybe I missed it,
1050000	1058000	which is fine, didn't mention that there actually is a PlayStation 4 theme that you can like make a classic.
1058000	1064000	And it actually so when you turn on your PlayStation 4, it actually makes that little boot up noise when it goes into the menu.
1064000	1074000	Perfect. Yeah, perfect. All right. But I need to now not use that anymore.
1074000	1078000	Sorry, it's loud. Probably came over really distorted on the mic, but that's all right.
1078000	1084000	I'm just going to turn it down while I for those of you that had to put your PlayStation on channel three or four, it was probably distorted, too.
1084000	1089000	Let's see. So Bobby Blackwell says, I use that PlayStation one theme on my PlayStation fours.
1089000	1096000	Yeah, I was for the longest time. I finally switched it to something themed around the game that I was really into.
1096000	1103000	And Orange Wright says, I use that PlayStation one theme for a long time. Yeah, it's a good theme.
1103000	1107000	Go find it if you don't already have it. I don't think it was a limited time theme.
1107000	1113000	I think it was released to coincide with. Do you remember about a year into the PlayStation 4's life,
1113000	1118000	they came out with a classic PlayStation kind of shell for it that was gray and it was in the colors.
1118000	1124000	It might have been honestly, it might have been like a 20th anniversary thing.
1124000	1131000	You playing on your phone over there? No, I was trying to get it back to the ringtone I had, which is the link to the past dark world music.
1131000	1138000	Vidpower in chat says, who here remembers taking out the game CD after this sound and putting in their import game right afterwards?
1138000	1142000	Who is the one who taught a certain other person in this room how to do it? Yeah.
1142000	1149000	Well, Dark Soccer, I was going to say, when it comes to game piracy, when it comes to the import games, import specifically, we were really crazy.
1149000	1156000	You were really good at that. Well, you, you, it wasn't, you didn't teach me that trick as much as you did the plug.
1156000	1162000	Because I had the, the, the, well, I know I showed you how to do the paperclip trick. Yeah, you did show me the paperclip trick.
1162000	1169000	And then I eventually got that thing because remember, Dan and I hunted up and down for the last PlayStation that had IO port on it.
1169000	1179000	And KB Toys had one and we bought it because we had to like start using our PlayStation on the side to be able to play anything.
1179000	1186000	So, um, we bought that one and there was, I think it was the GameShark, was it? Something like that was a GameShark type of thing.
1186000	1190000	That had like the, the reader and then the spring on it to where it would keep it depressed.
1190000	1196000	It wasn't, it was not a GameShark, but it was like a GameShark because the GameShark plugged into there too. Yeah.
1196000	1202000	But, um, but Dan could do like the multi disc swap one too. Yeah. So, and I want to make it clear, I don't endorse piracy.
1202000	1207000	But at that time it was very much like, okay, if you're not going to release the game in the States, I'm sorry.
1207000	1212000	I, then I'm going to just download the Japanese one and play it that way. I'll buy it if it's released.
1212000	1219000	But I didn't even buy, I didn't even download them. I purchased HK copies. Oh, wow. Okay.
1219000	1230000	So it's bootleg copies. And to this day, I will stand by my decision to always buy black DVDs because those would read better in a PlayStation.
1230000	1239000	Although you cannot use them for burning PC engine games, just saying you have to have a thick archive level disc, either that or tape pennies to your disc for it to be able to read it.
1239000	1247000	Wow. Because the discs for the PC engine games are so thick and heavy. Yeah. You have to use a disc as, as heavy. Interesting.
1247000	1256000	The weight of it does matter. Wow. Yeah. The more, you know, the more, you know, anyway, obviously adventures in piracy now that, well, now the, uh, consoles are generally region free.
1256000	1264000	Obviously that's not really an issue anymore. And now you can get the, um, the, the ever drives so much is released worldwide too.
1264000	1285000	I mean, our PC engine ever drive will play CD games. Yeah. So, and it's actually nice because although we do have a few games that I would, I would like to be able to get the CD out on for our core graphics so that we can get a Japanese arcade card because we have a few arcade card games that we can't play because arcade cards don't work with the converter.
1285000	1300000	You know, it's interesting. The Sony PlayStation was a huge part of how we in this room kind of all met. Um, and you know, I, I know it sounds like we talk a lot, a lot about this import stuff, but remember this show is really founded because of our mutual love in this room here of music based video games.
1300000	1310000	And the only way you could play dance, dance revolution at home was on a PlayStation with an import copy for a long, I mean, they did release a dance, dance revolution, USA and economics.
1310000	1322000	I mean, there were some USA versions later on, but like realistically the song lists weren't really as good. Those song lists didn't start getting good until like Xbox and PlayStation two when they started getting things like the different drum label.
1322000	1336000	I know, but that was PlayStation two, uh, when they got like, Oh no, third mix was great, but I'm saying, um, the U S releases on PS one were not good. Uh, well, I mean, they were like, technically they were fine, but the song lists weren't great, but yeah.
1336000	1345000	Oh yeah. It was all about playing third mix on an import PlayStation using your mouse dance pads. No, it was the jungle book.
1345000	1355000	That was the jungle book dance. They were small and then trying not to, you know, totally fuck up your under under apartment neighbors. Yeah. Right. That was fun. Good times.
1355000	1364000	So we all met with that because when we met, I mean, when OLR started the PlayStation two was a lot more like, you know, prevalent. More of us had them when OLR started.
1364000	1374000	But I would say when we were first hanging out meeting, cause OLR didn't start, what year did we all meet? That would have probably been early 2001 when we all met.
1374000	1393000	So like, I think PlayStation two was like just coming out, but like, we weren't like, it wasn't, we didn't all own it yet. So we were still kind of on the last wheels of the original PlayStation then playing all these, you know, beat mania, uh, guitar here, or not guitar hero, guitar freaks and all this stuff that was, you know, uh, original Bimani stuff on PlayStation.
1393000	1407000	So it was obviously a lot of big, big, uh, early memories in that regard. Um, Dartut Sia says 2000, 2001. Uh, 2001 was the year I lived at, uh, Melrose place with them who shall not be named.
1407000	1416000	Um, but I want to say that was earlier in the year, like March or whatever. So I must've met you guys. Maybe it was like late 2000 actually when I met all you guys.
1416000	1433000	So yeah, cause remember I lived at that place for like six months, but I ended up moving out in like October or November. So yeah, that was where I played like a crap ton of WonderSwan games because your roommate had the WonderSwan games that I wanted to play and beat mania for WonderSwan, which was fun.
1433000	1443000	That's a game I wouldn't mind picking up again as beat mania for WonderSwan, but I'd have to have the little scratch pad. Yeah. So anyway, uh, so yeah, we all met really thanks to the PlayStation era.
1443000	1454000	So, uh, outside of those types of memories, I want to ask you guys kind of here to celebrate 25 years of PlayStation and make you feel old. What are some of your early PlayStation memories, Loki?
1454000	1472000	Uh, well, I remember I bought the PlayStation for Final Fantasy seven, so it would have been playing that. And then, I don't know, I used to, it was one of the games or game systems I used to drag with me to, um, high school all the time.
1472000	1482000	So I actually had a carrying case for it and I'd bring in the PlayStation demo discs and then play like the Cool Borders two demo like a billion times.
1482000	1492000	And, or no, actually, I don't even know if it was the second Cool Borders, that may have been the first Cool Borders game. Um, so yeah, a lot of that.
1492000	1504000	And then I remember one birthday party because I knew you could do it. And that's why they had those stupid, uh, serial ports on there anyways. You can system link games.
1504000	1522000	Um, and so one game that supported that was, uh, Bushido Blade, I think. And it, it makes it into this weird like first person game. Like you run through like a maze and you attack each other that way.
1522000	1531000	But it's a versus mode, which is really odd, but I did it because I wanted to see what it was. And then I was horribly disappointed by it.
1531000	1540000	But for, for one birthday party, I had a friend bring over his, you know, his PlayStation. We had two TVs and we hooked up that system link cable and we're able to do that.
1540000	1546000	I'm reading some comments from chat. Uh, act def says jumping flash is probably my earliest PlayStation one memory.
1546000	1555000	My brother-in-law had a PlayStation one with that demo disc and I played it a whole lot, uh, whenever I was at his house. And then a lot of folks in chat talking about demo discs. Remember that era?
1555000	1564000	That was the time. Those are the days, man. I have a lot of place early PlayStation memories though, cause it came out when I was in college.
1564000	1573000	And although my friends like, wait, wait, I'm importing a Sega Saturn. Hell yeah. I want to play your Sega Saturn. What's this Gundam game here.
1573000	1582000	Um, but, but at any rate, um, I didn't own, I didn't own a PlayStation until I moved out here, but I owned Final Fantasy seven when it came out.
1582000	1593000	And, um, my roommate's boyfriend, um, didn't want his PlayStation at home cause he was in his like graduate classes or something.
1593000	1607000	So it was hooked up to my little 13 inch TV and we played a shit ton of Tushinden, a shit ton of jumping flash, and really just a shit ton of Tushinden. Really a lot of Tushinden.
1607000	1615000	Uh, Bobby Blackwolf says, I feel like I should stream those PlayStation underground discs. Hell yeah. Like 25th anniversary. It's a, this is the time to be doing something like that.
1616000	1626000	A swung tong, uh, post the memory of going to Walden books and all the PSMs were ripped and the demo discs were gone. Oh yes. That was the worst. That's why you have to subscribe to it.
1626000	1639000	A quest Buster saying on Loki story. I remember taking our PlayStation on vacation one time and hooked it up to the room TV. When the weather was trash, we stayed inside and played Xenogears. So nice. Love it.
1639000	1649000	Uh, let's see. So my earliest PlayStation memory, I finally bought PlayStation. I bought it because I knew final fantasy seven was going to be coming out on it. And I kind of wanted one.
1649000	1663000	Um, I, I was actually more into the stuff on PlayStation than I was Nintendo 64, uh, at the time. And I was always a very loyal, like Nintendo guy. Like I love super Nintendo and the original Nintendo, but I wasn't really feeling like I wasn't feeling the, the polygon 3d stuff.
1663000	1674000	Like it just wasn't what I was into at the time. I appreciate it later. Um, certainly, but you know, at the time I wasn't super feeling it. So, uh, which I know is ironic because the polygon stuff was huge on the CD games, but I don't know.
1674000	1684000	It was, it was really weird, uh, seeing things like Mario and that stuff like on the Nintendo 64, but obviously I was a huge final fantasy Stan at the time and I still am.
1684000	1694000	And so when they said Final Fantasy seven was going to make the jump to PlayStation, I kind of followed and I bought a PlayStation. Eventually I bought a Nintendo 64. I bought one when they came down to like 20 bucks.
1694000	1706000	There was a Pikachu one that you turned it on and the lights light lit up his little cheeks. But anyway, uh, but that that's Nintendo. Uh, as far as Sony goes, I remember saving up the money or no, I use my Christmas money, uh, to go to the warehouse.
1706000	1719000	Ah, yes. You remember that chain and bought the PlayStation along with crash bandicoot too. That was the first game I really remember playing. So that was, uh, that was, that was my early on experience with PlayStation.
1719000	1734000	And then when I went off to college, I can't tell you how much class I missed to stay behind and play final fantasy seven, uh, street, uh, super street fighter, or excuse me, puzzle fighter, whatever the hell the name of that super puzzle fighter to turbo or whatever parody name
1734000	1744000	they gave that puzzle fighter was a huge time sink in college that, um, yeah, I, I shudder to think about all the time I lost to that game, but that was a huge influential game on PlayStation.
1744000	1753000	And then obviously later on, as we talked about, um, all the music based games and DDR and beat me and stuff was, was really huge later on an influential into the show that we have now.
1753000	1765000	So big thanks to PlayStation for making that all happen. Appreciate that. So, uh, any other PlayStation memories y'all want to throw out there before we move on to our next topic?
1765000	1767000	A lot of fun to see seven.
1767000	1768000	A lot of fun to see seven. I know.
1768000	1772000	And then it was sandwich during nights of the round with quadra magic and repeat.
1772000	1782000	But not, you know what, not everything was roses when it came to PlayStation because I hated, um, legend of mana was the, that was the PlayStation mana game, right? I hated it.
1782000	1785000	I had an import of it. Uh, I didn't, I didn't care for it.
1785000	1787000	And it was a way too text heavy for me.
1787000	1792000	Yeah. So, um, not everything on play and I did not care for Chrono Cross.
1792000	1798000	And this is not some silly throwback to, uh, our fight about what the best Super Nintendo game is of all time.
1798000	1803000	Cause I do appreciate, I certainly love Chrono Trigger and appreciate that game was not into Chrono Cross when I played that.
1803000	1809000	So PlayStation had some odd sequels, especially on the Square Enix side of things, but that was, that was my opinion.
1809000	1815000	Although with Chrono Cross, it did still have a killer soundtrack. We all know Scars of Time was one of the all time greatest songs. So, you know, there is that.
1815000	1820000	So, all right. Well, moving on to things a little more recent, let's talk a little bit about our gaming weeks.
1820000	1825000	As we get into a segment called, uh, how was your gaming week and what types of video games have you been playing this week?
1825000	1829000	Although I'm noticing as we're broadcasting live on Twitch, I'm missing that from the sidebar.
1829000	1834000	So I should probably add that right now while we talk to Dark Sakura about her gaming week.
1834000	1841000	Well, um, I was playing some Pokemon Sword, which I was pretty happy about. Um, I've beat my second gym.
1841000	1847000	I'm just, I mean, I'm just taking my time with it. I'm enjoying it, leveling my Pokemans, you know, doing the stuff.
1847000	1857000	Um, I have my, my Farfetch'd now, my whatever Galarian's Ash level it's called. What are they called? The...
1857000	1858000	Sirfetch'd?
1858000	1859000	No, I don't have Sirfetch'd yet.
1859000	1860000	The Farfetch'd?
1860000	1863000	I have the Farfetch'd for that area. And it's like Galar, Galem.
1863000	1865000	Galar, Galarian, Galarian.
1865000	1868000	I've just been calling it Galarian, like speaking of old PlayStation games.
1868000	1870000	It's like Galarian's was great.
1870000	1873000	You're supposed to say like Galar region or Ga- I don't know how you really pronounce it.
1873000	1874000	Galar.
1874000	1875000	Galar region.
1875000	1876000	Yeah.
1876000	1879000	Uh, like Alola regionals is Galar regional, but whatever you say Galarian is fine.
1879000	1882000	My brain can't wrap around it, so I've been calling it Galarian's.
1882000	1889000	So, and then I think of making people's heads explode kind of like, because Galarian's to me was the head exploding game, like the movie Scanners, or was it Scanners or Transfers?
1890000	1893000	Whatever movie it was that made people's heads explode, I think it was Scanners.
1893000	1895000	But anyway, um, I've been playing that.
1895000	1900000	We have another pinball in my house that we are borrowing, which is Elvira's scared stiff.
1900000	1905000	Which I thought was being taken out of my house on Thursday, and I texted Rob in a tizzy,
1905000	1907000	You missed your chance!
1907000	1916000	And it turned out that Dan actually loaned out probably the least favorite machine in his favorite that we own, which is Creature from the Black Lagoon.
1917000	1919000	I don't like Creature, it's just annoying.
1919000	1924000	Um, but yeah, I did play a crap load of pinball because Dan did League Night, and I made a lot of cookies for that.
1924000	1926000	Um, I am...
1926000	1936000	I slacked off a lot on my mobile gaming this week, just because I've had a headache that's lasted me since I was sick from the week before.
1937000	1942000	And um, I just, staring at screens is just making my eyes hurt.
1942000	1950000	So I've been trying to avoid doing that too much, except for playing Pokemon, which is easier with the ambient lighting in the room.
1950000	1953000	And then I've been playing a lot of Chase the Cat around the house.
1953000	1958000	I don't know, but she's just like really been super playful.
1958000	1965000	And it's been nice to kind of be distracted from the digital just by playing with, you know, my furry little pain in the ass.
1966000	1969000	Midna's been super affectionate lately.
1969000	1970000	Cute.
1970000	1972000	My boo boo.
1972000	1974000	Anything else for the gaming week?
1974000	1975000	Uh uh.
1975000	1982000	One weird thing that happened, and apparently I'm not the only one this happened to, my Facebook set up in a different language this morning.
1982000	1984000	I logged in and it was in German.
1984000	1990000	Honestly, it's doing you a favor keeping you out. I would love it if mine did that too.
1990000	1993000	Well it actually, a friend of mine logged in and his was in Spanish.
1994000	1998000	So, and I know I have two factor on, so it's not like anyone can go ahead and change it for me.
1998000	2001000	I'm really hovering on the fence.
2001000	2007000	Like I kind of want to as a New Year's resolution or whatever you call it, like going into a new decade, I really want to get rid of Facebook.
2007000	2008000	I can't.
2008000	2013000	But see, I realize that the problem with it is it's twofold.
2013000	2015000	Is that it's way too good for promotional stuff.
2015000	2016000	Like that's the reality.
2016000	2022000	Like if I want to promote, hey I'm hosting Rocky Horror, or hey I'm doing this thing, or hey I'm broadcasting Orange Lawns Radio.
2022000	2028000	Like Facebook remains a strong place to do that because without it, like I can't, like my friends and family, I know they all check it.
2028000	2031000	Like it's hard. I mean yes, I can send an email, I can send a letter.
2031000	2032000	Sure, I can do all these other things.
2032000	2036000	It's not part of people's habitual routine like Facebook is.
2036000	2040000	And then the other thing that's like really kind of keeping me on there is Messenger.
2040000	2042000	Our fan pages.
2042000	2044000	Well, I don't have a fan page.
2044000	2045000	We have the Orange Lawns Radio.
2045000	2046000	Orange Lawns Radio has a fan page.
2046000	2047000	And I have a fan page.
2047000	2050000	And I do post to my fan page fairly regularly.
2051000	2054000	I also, my Instagram is linked to my Facebook.
2054000	2059000	And the only reason I've really done it is because I have friends on there that I have no other way to get in contact with them.
2059000	2061000	You know, so.
2061000	2063000	Yeah, and I'm on the fan.
2063000	2067000	One day, and to be fair, one day I'll be like, I'm deleting Facebook, I'm deleting everything.
2067000	2075000	Then the next day I'll be like, I should make a Rob Roberts fan page so I can put all of my blasts on that particular thing and not my personal feed or whatever.
2075000	2079000	And then I can sift through my friends list a little bit and cut out people that I don't know.
2079000	2082000	I also have a page as a sister for doing sister stuff.
2082000	2086000	But I'm actually legit thinking of going back to LiveJournal.
2086000	2088000	Officially back to LiveJournal.
2088000	2090000	I have a permanent account. Why the fuck not?
2090000	2094000	And honestly, people are like, oh, the Russians are going to get your information.
2094000	2096000	Not really.
2096000	2098000	They already have it.
2098000	2105000	You know, and they still have to adhere to the European standard for privacy.
2105000	2107000	Which is a lot more stringent than the American standards are.
2107000	2108000	True enough.
2108000	2113000	So I'm honestly thinking about going completely back to LiveJournal for all my stuff.
2113000	2115000	Renaissance 2020. Let's make it happen.
2115000	2117000	All right, anyway, back to video games. Sorry.
2117000	2119000	Loki, I know you had a very busy day.
2119000	2124000	I went to a local gaming expo called Sac Gamer Expo.
2124000	2128000	So we saw a lot of people and played a lot of things.
2128000	2131000	So talking with some of the stuff I saw.
2131000	2134000	So they had the Sega Pluto-01 prototype.
2134000	2137000	Which apparently was an unreleased variant of the Sega Saturn.
2137000	2140000	That you could look at. It obviously wasn't doing anything.
2140000	2142000	But it was still neat to see.
2142000	2144000	It was huge.
2144000	2146000	Had a top-loading disk drive.
2146000	2148000	And then they had a cartridge slot.
2148000	2150000	Which was like a memory card slot.
2150000	2152000	Or memory slot, I guess, like in the Saturn.
2154000	2156000	And then, what else?
2156000	2159000	Got autographs from Kenny James and Kellen Goff.
2159000	2162000	So Kenny James is the voice of Bowser.
2162000	2166000	Which, my kids are like, Bowser talks?
2166000	2169000	I'm like, well, he growls. I mean, that's sort of, you know.
2169000	2171000	So we got his...
2171000	2174000	Yeah, so he did the laugh.
2174000	2178000	And then, of course, Kellen Goff, my son was very excited about.
2178000	2187000	Because he does the voice of several of the Freddy characters in Five Nights at Freddy's.
2187000	2190000	Molten Freddy, Freddy Fazbear, and Fredbear.
2190000	2193000	Yeah, Kellen's great. I met him and I did a panel with him at Dragon Con.
2193000	2195000	When I did that Five Nights panel at Dragon Con.
2195000	2196000	Ah, yes. Awesome.
2196000	2197000	He's great, yeah.
2197000	2199000	So one of these days I'll try to get him on the show.
2199000	2200000	Just talk about all that stuff.
2200000	2204000	Yeah, so we got to meet him and got an autograph and stuff like that.
2204000	2206000	What else?
2206000	2208000	So I played quite a few games.
2208000	2210000	We went through the...
2210000	2213000	I kind of had it broken up with the exhibitors.
2213000	2220000	Which is mostly just people selling vintage gaming stuff and anime things and all that.
2220000	2224000	And they had the indie developers section.
2224000	2229000	Which wasn't as big as the event that I went to in September.
2229000	2232000	That was strictly indies in there.
2232000	2235000	So we did play some of the games that were there.
2235000	2237000	There was the zombie game from last time there.
2237000	2240000	So my kids played that for quite a bit.
2241000	2244000	They had a few other games I checked out.
2244000	2247000	There was a guy from San Jose who had a game that looked pretty cool.
2247000	2249000	It was kind of like a slime puzzle game.
2249000	2252000	But they had it set up in full-size arcade cabinets.
2252000	2253000	Which is pretty cool.
2253000	2255000	So I got to check that out.
2255000	2256000	What else?
2256000	2259000	So vintage gaming stuff we went through.
2259000	2263000	I played a little bit of Mega Race on the 3DO.
2263000	2269000	Which last time I played Mega Race was on PC on my single-speed external CD drive.
2269000	2274000	So that was kind of fun to go back and play that and have my kids play that.
2274000	2278000	I played a little bit of Mario Clash on the Virtual Boy.
2278000	2281000	Just kind of like every single thing that they had there.
2281000	2284000	A little bit of DuckTales.
2284000	2285000	What else?
2285000	2287000	They had the sewing machine there.
2287000	2288000	I don't remember which...
2288000	2290000	I'm sad I missed it.
2290000	2292000	Yeah, so they have the sewing machine there.
2292000	2293000	And Rob, of course.
2293000	2295000	And they even...
2295000	2296000	The robot's right here.
2296000	2297000	No, not me. The robot.
2297000	2298000	The robot, yes.
2298000	2300000	And they even had the same for the Super Nintendo.
2300000	2303000	It was like a full-size AR.
2303000	2305000	That was like some military training thing.
2305000	2307000	They were showing that.
2307000	2308000	Which is pretty cool.
2308000	2310000	And what else?
2310000	2312000	I almost...
2312000	2316000	Because I had already spent enough money as I was getting autographs for my kids.
2316000	2323000	But then they also had one of the artists, Mark Erickson.
2323000	2327000	Who's a freelance illustrator who did artwork on very...
2327000	2329000	A lot of box art that you might be familiar with.
2329000	2332000	For example, Mega Man 2.
2332000	2333000	The American one.
2333000	2336000	The bad box Mega Man.
2336000	2340000	But bad box Mega Man was under direction from a great...
2340000	2341000	We can't blame this guy for...
2341000	2343000	No, no, no. It wasn't his fault.
2343000	2345000	But the NES Strider.
2345000	2347000	Bad dudes.
2347000	2351000	They even had Tetris, Choplifter, and Heavy Barrel and Bulk 3.
2351000	2352000	Dang.
2352000	2354000	Jamie, cover your ears for a second.
2354000	2357000	I miss the NES Strider. I love that game.
2357000	2359000	Oh, wait. I'm not mad about the NES Strider.
2359000	2360000	The NES Strider?
2360000	2362000	Well, because it was based on the manga.
2362000	2363000	Oh, okay. That's right. Okay.
2363000	2366000	I know for you the arcade is the definitive.
2366000	2369000	But the arcade, the Strider is the Strider.
2369000	2379000	But I was this close had I had enough extra money to buy a poster-sized bad box Mega Man 2 signed by the artist for the studio.
2379000	2384000	We could use some freshening up of the OLR decorum maybe for next year.
2384000	2386000	Maybe for next year we're gonna sub out some of these posters.
2386000	2387000	Rob.
2387000	2388000	I mean, I love me some Kingdom Hearts.
2388000	2390000	But Pop'n Music 11, you guys.
2390000	2391000	Rob.
2391000	2392000	That's old.
2392000	2393000	Pop'n Music 11?
2393000	2394000	Talk about 25 years of PlayStation.
2394000	2395000	Rob.
2395000	2396000	What?
2396000	2400000	I was gonna get this for you as a holiday present and it didn't arrive until after I'd already bought the rest of your present.
2400000	2401000	Okay.
2401000	2402000	So I'm just gonna go ahead and tell you what I got you.
2402000	2403000	Uh-huh. Aww.
2403000	2405000	I got you a Commodore 64 schematic poster.
2405000	2406000	Oh, cool.
2406000	2408000	And I'm just trying to find an 11 by 14 frame.
2408000	2409000	Oh, perfect.
2409000	2410000	Perfect.
2410000	2411000	Perfect new decor.
2411000	2412000	So instead-
2412000	2413000	Oh, frames though.
2413000	2415000	Uh, lights aren't gonna take well to it.
2415000	2416000	So, uh-
2416000	2419000	Well, then I'll just give you the, the, the, or we can get like a matte thing for it.
2419000	2421000	Yeah, something that won't, you have to be mindful of the light.
2421000	2425000	But yeah, but it was what I initially had ordered and then they said, oh, it's not gonna arrive until well after.
2425000	2427000	So I got other presents and then it arrived.
2427000	2428000	Mm-hmm.
2428000	2429000	So I'm just gonna go ahead and tell you.
2429000	2432000	So it's now, uh, it's now an OLR gift.
2432000	2433000	But then the other thing-
2433000	2437000	Speaking of gifts, I need to, so I need to talk about what the husband got me because all of you.
2437000	2442000	All of you that have been listening for a little while are gonna laugh at what the husband got me for a gift.
2442000	2444000	While I talk about that, you talk about your little, uh-
2444000	2453000	So the other thing I, I, I saw that at the, uh, vendor area that I had to get is a 3D printed Untitled Goose Game Goose.
2453000	2454000	That is great.
2454000	2455000	It has a bell.
2455000	2459000	I had to get it for my desk because it's awesome.
2459000	2460000	They had several.
2460000	2462000	They had one with the bow.
2462000	2463000	They had the bell.
2463000	2465000	They had one with nothing.
2465000	2468000	But you gotta get the bell because it rings.
2468000	2472000	Did you ever watch the boundary break for the Untitled Goose Game?
2472000	2473000	Uh, yes.
2473000	2476000	His, I just want one of his wings all light.
2476000	2477000	I want foldable wings.
2477000	2481000	I brought in the box because the actual device is way too heavy.
2481000	2482000	Lord.
2482000	2484000	But it is a battery backup.
2484000	2492000	It's a UPS to actually, uh, plug things into so that if the power ever goes out, we have an opportunity to save the video and all that good stuff.
2492000	2495000	I don't have to go to Twitch Archive or any of those other workarounds.
2495000	2501000	So he was like, I think it's something that wasn't exactly on your list, but you're gonna find it really useful.
2501000	2503000	So props to Alan.
2503000	2509000	And all of you out there that like to make fun of the lack of a UPS here in OLR Studio can now officially shut the fuck up.
2509000	2510000	Thank you.
2510000	2512000	Uh, somebody fill time while I take this back.
2512000	2513000	Oh, yes.
2513000	2514000	The rest of your con.
2514000	2515000	Loki.
2515000	2516000	Uh, yes.
2516000	2525000	And, uh, the other thing we saw, we, like I said, I was trying to get my kids to, uh, be more interested in because they wanted to see YouTubers, but they don't know who these YouTubers are.
2525000	2531000	Um, but they have like Arlo there, which he's, um, everything pretty well known.
2531000	2532000	He's a Nintendo brand ambassador.
2532000	2537000	You may know him because he is actually, his character is a puppet.
2537000	2544000	And so they had the guy that voices Arlo and he's doing the puppet during the actual, um, Q&A, which I thought was really cute.
2544000	2547000	But, um, you know, it was cool.
2547000	2548000	Overall, it was nice.
2548000	2550000	The weather could have been better.
2550000	2558000	Um, also I, they had it in a marathon that was running through Sacramento and that really blocked everything off.
2558000	2564000	So you have to go way around everything to get to the actual convention, uh, which kind of sucked.
2564000	2567000	Um, oh, we also played VR.
2567000	2573000	They had Beat Saber and they also had that, um, I don't remember what it's called, but I think it's the plank.
2573000	2578000	It's the one where you go up an elevator and then you have to balance on a plank and you could fall.
2578000	2584000	And it's supposed to be scary, but cause it's actually like it's a tiny piece of wood on the ground, but it's very convincing.
2584000	2586000	I didn't do that cause it was $10.
2586000	2587000	I'm like, no.
2587000	2589000	Bobby says Richie's plank experience.
2589000	2590000	Yes.
2590000	2592000	I'm not paying money for that.
2592000	2593000	I'll play free VR.
2593000	2594000	I'm not paying for that.
2594000	2595000	Okay.
2595000	2597000	Create, unless it's maybe a fundraiser or something.
2597000	2598000	It's $10.
2598000	2600000	No, it's donated to teaching kids to code or something.
2600000	2602000	No, it's, it's nothing like that.
2602000	2604000	It was just there there to make money.
2604000	2605000	Well, that's yeah.
2605000	2609000	So I, I find it very strange to pro it was the creators of the game there.
2609000	2610000	No, no, no.
2610000	2612000	It was, it's a VR center.
2612000	2618000	They come in, they demo VR and they give out like 15 minute coupons for like VR time.
2618000	2620000	Personal interjection.
2620000	2628000	I think that's kind of shady if it ain't your game and you didn't design the VR headset, like I get they're trying to promote their center or whatever, but charging money for that.
2628000	2630000	Like I, this is America.
2630000	2631000	This is those type of thing.
2631000	2637000	And I realize a lot of like Dave and Buster's asks type of places, how that what's that place they charge for VR and stuff.
2637000	2643000	I just think it's a little, you know, like where, where's the cut that's going to the people that made that game anyway?
2643000	2648000	Well, they would argue it's the cut that they purchased the game from steam or whatever for the license.
2648000	2649000	Yeah.
2649000	2651000	And Bobby says that game is $15 on steam.
2651000	2652000	That's way too much.
2652000	2653000	Yeah.
2653000	2654000	$10 a play.
2654000	2663000	And the reason I guess they, they're justifying that is because they had the buy of a Vive, the Vive pro to run it or some stupid crap.
2663000	2666000	Donate the money to helping kids code or something useful.
2666000	2667000	Anyway.
2667000	2668000	Yeah.
2668000	2670000	Cause my kids were like, Oh yeah, we can try it.
2670000	2672000	They're like, well ask your dad if it's okay to play.
2672000	2675000	Like I thought they were saying, Oh, cause they're too little for VR.
2675000	2676000	I'm like, Oh no, that's cool.
2676000	2677000	And they're like, it's $10.
2677000	2679000	I'm like, Nope, Nope, Nope.
2679000	2680000	That's going to be a no.
2680000	2682000	We'll go, we'll go in the line and play free.
2682000	2684000	But I will spend the money on a goose.
2684000	2685000	Honk.
2685000	2689000	There's there's where your VR experience went kids.
2689000	2691000	The goose strikes again.
2691000	2692000	Honk.
2692000	2693000	Exactly.
2693000	2695000	I love it.
2695000	2696000	All right.
2696000	2698000	Um, so it sounds like you had a good time at the show.
2698000	2699000	Yeah, it was, it was all right.
2699000	2701000	The local shows are usually fun.
2701000	2703000	I don't know why I didn't go to the one today.
2703000	2705000	I just, it was okay.
2705000	2710000	It was like, you know, there was a lot of like, everything was like very expensive.
2710000	2712000	Like the tickets to get in were really cheap.
2712000	2715000	Cause it was like 10 bucks for an adult kids like under a certain age get in free.
2715000	2719000	And like, I probably could have got both of my kids in for free, but like it's everything
2719000	2721000	else on top of it.
2721000	2722000	That's super expensive.
2722000	2723000	Like they had a food truck out there.
2723000	2725000	It was like 30 bucks for lunch.
2725000	2726000	It was ridiculous.
2726000	2727000	And the food wasn't that great.
2727000	2729000	That's that's where those things really make their money though.
2729000	2733000	Like I, I don't, I don't want to say too much, but I know people that do conventions and
2733000	2737000	it's, it's, it's much more about getting people in the door for those types of things.
2737000	2741000	And then you're making money off the tables that people are renting, but you need to be
2741000	2742000	able to provide them business.
2742000	2746000	And yeah, to be fair though, they did give away some free posters and I got a really
2746000	2751000	nice, the one that I actually got signed, the, um, the Bowser poster was, it was someone
2751000	2753000	drew it in like an anime style.
2753000	2756000	And so it's like Bowser as, um, Godzilla.
2756000	2759000	So they have like a helicopter attacking him and stuff, and it's really kick ass.
2759000	2763000	And then they had an anime peach that I got, I'm going to frame them for my kids' room.
2763000	2766000	So that kind of like evened it out a little bit because those are really cool and they're
2766000	2767000	free.
2767000	2773000	Um, but yeah, I mean, I like all the games stuff there was so expensive.
2773000	2777000	Like I, I would have partaken in more stuff, but it's just, I didn't have the money.
2777000	2782000	And like autographs too, like 30 bucks a pop, you know, it, it adds up.
2782000	2783000	It does.
2783000	2784000	It does.
2784000	2785000	All right.
2785000	2786000	Um, anything else?
2786000	2788000	Uh, no, that's, that's it.
2788000	2790000	Uh, my gaming week.
2790000	2795000	Uh, so last week I played a lot of games and this week I kind of don't have as much to
2795000	2799000	talk about in that department because, uh, I kind of kept playing those same games.
2799000	2803000	For example, I was continuing on in Pokemon Shield, those Snorlax raids came out.
2803000	2804000	I did a couple of those today.
2804000	2806000	Didn't catch it, which was depressing.
2806000	2811000	Uh, it was hard to fill parties for that, which is really depressing because the NPCs
2811000	2812000	are really stupid.
2812000	2818000	Um, so again, the, the, the Nintendo's online system and the whole way that's designed with
2818000	2822000	the, and I realized this is part of the design of the Pokemon game as well, uh, is, is really
2822000	2823000	holding that whole end of it back.
2823000	2829000	Like it just, it needs to be easier to find and join raids and stuff, uh, than it is currently.
2829000	2830000	I just, it's silly.
2830000	2833000	Um, especially when you're going to be promoting these types of limited time events that are
2833000	2834000	pretty hard.
2834000	2836000	So just, just my opinion.
2836000	2839000	Otherwise I still feel Pokemon Shield's a strong title and I'm continuing to work on
2839000	2843000	my decks a little bit, but I'll save some of that for some live streaming as well.
2843000	2846000	Um, cause I was trying to be a good boy and do more Twitch streams this week.
2846000	2852000	Um, uh, I did like a Final Fantasy 14 stream a little earlier this week, so there was that.
2852000	2856000	Um, let's see, other things, uh, that I played this week.
2856000	2861000	I also, uh, played a little more Death Stranding, uh, a little more Final Fantasy 14, getting
2861000	2863000	into, uh, uh, Gathering.
2863000	2866000	Uh, Botany was trying to level that up cause one of my friends was like, oh, you're doing
2866000	2867000	it wrong.
2867000	2870000	You need to be doing scripts, do collectibles for yellow scripts and the levels will fly
2870000	2871000	by.
2871000	2872000	Uh, and that's very true.
2872000	2875000	Um, so I have been, uh, working on that a little bit.
2875000	2880000	Um, then of course some of my other old standbys, I was playing a lot of Pokemon Go this week.
2880000	2884000	I was hanging out with a friend and we walked all around downtown, caught a ton of Pokemon.
2884000	2886000	Uh, no shinies for me.
2886000	2890000	My friend caught a shiny, uh, Eevee randomly.
2890000	2894000	Uh, but, uh, even better, you know what I think is even better than shinies?
2894000	2896000	100% IV Pokemon.
2896000	2900000	So I did catch a 15, 15, 15 Ralts.
2900000	2903000	Finally a useful 100%er that I caught in the wild.
2903000	2905000	So that was very cool.
2905000	2906000	Uh, so I was very, very happy about that.
2907000	2908000	Uh, so that was a little Pokemon Go.
2908000	2912000	And then I played, um, also a little bit of Harry Potter, Wizards Unite because of the
2912000	2913000	event.
2913000	2915000	Uh, and then I was playing a little bit of Ingress.
2915000	2916000	So I'll actually talk about that.
2916000	2919000	So, you know, I've been playing Ingress for years, but there was actually an event that
2919000	2921000	happened on Saturday.
2921000	2925000	So we went over to Oakland, even though it was like pouring rain and like, what a ridiculous
2925000	2926000	thing to do.
2926000	2928000	But, uh, there was kind of a lot of stuff.
2928000	2933000	Like if, if I went, it would be my sixth hack of the traveling van that was going to be
2933000	2937000	there, uh, and that gets you a special reward or a special like in-game badge.
2937000	2940000	And then I'm like, uh, you get double AP for playing.
2940000	2947000	And, uh, what the, um, I was also just shy of 10,000 unique hacks.
2947000	2952000	So I was like, oh, if I go, I could get my 10,000th unique hack as a part of the event
2952000	2954000	because you get a little badge in game for it.
2954000	2959000	So to kind of relate that to Pokemon Go terms, that's like spinning 10,000 unique stops.
2959000	2961000	That's what I just did in Ingress this week.
2961000	2962000	10,000 unique places.
2962000	2966000	Um, so, uh, that was a private accomplishment, but what was kind of neat about it.
2966000	2970000	So the actual Ingress event, uh, the play time where you're kind of just trying to get
2970000	2975000	AP as fast as you can, uh, that was scheduled between one and 3 PM.
2975000	2978000	So it overlapped with the Pokemon raid event, right.
2978000	2979000	Which started at 11.
2979000	2980000	Right.
2980000	2984000	So in the noon hour, we were down on the pier and we were raiding, there were two, there
2984000	2987000	were two gyms, like practically on top of each other, uh, both had Charizards.
2987000	2989000	So we were raiding the Charizards.
2989000	2993000	As we're raiding the Charizard, this guy in a Niantic jacket walks by and says, Hey,
2993000	2995000	you guys doing the mission?
2995000	2996000	And we're like, no, we're raiding the Charizard.
2996000	2998000	And my friend recognizes him.
2998000	2999000	I didn't recognize him at first.
2999000	3003000	My friend recognized him as John Hanke, the CEO of Niantic.
3003000	3007000	So, um, he was at the event, um, because he's based in the Bay area.
3007000	3008000	I mean, that's so surprised.
3008000	3009000	And it was really neat.
3009000	3011000	He's like, Oh, I'm out doing the mission or whatever.
3011000	3012000	We're like, Hey, can we get a selfie?
3012000	3014000	Uh, but we're doing the Charizard raid right now.
3014000	3015000	He's like, yeah, no problem.
3015000	3017000	I'm going to go get this portal over here and then I'll come back.
3017000	3021000	So he actually, like, he's actually out there playing Ingress and he's, he's laughing that
3021000	3022000	we're doing the Charizard raid.
3022000	3025000	You know, obviously it's like, ha ha, line my pockets.
3025000	3028000	No, no, it wasn't that he's actually, he was like really chill.
3028000	3029000	It was cool.
3029000	3032000	So, and then he came by and took a picture and, you know, we just kind of said, Hey,
3032000	3035000	and just, you know, greeted him and we were talking a little bit about the event, like
3035000	3036000	good to see it.
3036000	3037000	And then no, you'd be out today.
3037000	3041000	And yeah, he was, um, just kind of out there playing like everybody else.
3041000	3043000	So I thought that was really, really cool.
3043000	3049000	I like that the Niantic staff, I hear a lot of the staffers in Los Angeles were at a,
3049000	3051000	there was another first Saturday event that happened in Los Angeles.
3051000	3053000	And I think a lot of staffers were at that one too.
3053000	3056000	So I think it's really cool that Niantic people are like getting out in the wild, going to
3056000	3057000	some of the Ingress events.
3057000	3061000	I realized Pokemon goes their moneymaker, but Ingress, you know, was kind of like their
3061000	3062000	first.
3062000	3063000	You never forget your first.
3063000	3068000	It's also nice that you can enjoy something that you made because like I can imagine,
3068000	3074000	especially with like Ingress having worked on it for so long, it might get like, I don't
3074000	3076000	want to play this anymore, you know?
3076000	3079000	So it's nice to see that they're still enjoying their work.
3079000	3080000	Yeah.
3080000	3084000	And even, and I have my own problems with Ingress and just the fact that like amongst
3084000	3089000	this forced move to Prime, um, that really let a lot of the player base was not happy
3089000	3090000	with Prime.
3090000	3093000	I'm fine with it, but I do realize there's certain, there's certain key things I miss
3093000	3096000	like force sync, like basic, basic things that aren't there.
3096000	3101000	Um, but I felt like this whole move to Prime was to be to introduce new features and new
3101000	3102000	things.
3102000	3106000	So I'm a little disappointed that still has not shown up and I'm like, I'm, I'm losing
3106000	3110000	a little bit of patience, but events are always worth coming out for.
3110000	3115000	And at the same time, um, they were testing some type of event in LA.
3115000	3120000	So they actually were doing like a, what they call the flashpoint event at the LA thing.
3120000	3124000	So they're, I guess they're trying, it's just a little slow to come by, but I imagine, you
3124000	3127000	know, again, Pokemon goes where they're making their money.
3127000	3129000	There's probably 20 people working on Pokemon Go.
3129000	3133000	There's probably four that are working on Ingress, you know, it's probably not, you
3133000	3137000	know, I understand it's more their pet project, but without it, I don't think you'd have the
3137000	3144000	quality stops that you have now, because believe me, if entrusted completely to the Pokemon
3144000	3150000	players, and I say this as a level 40 mystic, uh, the portal network and the stop and all
3150000	3154000	that, that, that would suck ass if only the Pokemon players were nominating things.
3154000	3156000	I still don't know how to submit a help.
3156000	3157000	That's the truth.
3157000	3158000	It is the fucking truth.
3158000	3162000	I still don't know how to submit a help ticket for the one I sent back in May that I can't,
3162000	3164000	it's not going anywhere.
3164000	3167000	Uh, I, I'll look it up later and message it to you.
3167000	3171000	So anyway, uh, so speaking of like GPS games, I'm going to shout out this real quick, just
3171000	3174000	because the person that introduced me to this is in chat right now.
3174000	3179000	So I have to kind of give her a little shit, but, um, I downloaded another GPS based game
3179000	3181000	called Orna is the name of this game.
3181000	3187000	And it's a very simple kind of RPG ish type of game, but it uses, by the way, is that
3187000	3193000	if I just hit level 71, we're somehow still in a party together, but you'll notice it
3193000	3194000	actually is.
3194000	3197000	Oh, I better not show exactly where I live, but you'll, I mean, it's, yeah, you can't
3197000	3198000	see anything.
3198000	3201000	It just was like three streets, but you can actually see, it looks like 2d.
3201000	3203000	It looks like a little eight bit kind of game.
3203000	3204000	Right.
3204000	3207000	And then it actually shows like the map with all the little mobs on it.
3207000	3208000	And then you can like fight them.
3208000	3212000	And it's a little like, I'm looking for this little battle Orna, but the only thing is
3212000	3217000	the only like criticism I have of the game is, um, the fact that like the map seems to
3217000	3218000	serve no real purpose.
3218000	3221000	Like there's no point to go to a park or this place.
3221000	3223000	It's just, the map is just like the world around you.
3223000	3228000	I mean, I guess there are like ends and things just put around or whatever, and you can party
3228000	3230000	with people if you meet up in real life.
3230000	3236000	And because I guess a Zed and I only live what probably three miles apart, somehow we're
3236000	3238000	still in a party a day and a half later.
3238000	3241000	She's she's basically carrying me through this game.
3241000	3243000	So there is that.
3243000	3246000	So I thought it was kind of kind of cute.
3246000	3249000	So I'm not sure the longevity of it.
3249000	3252000	But I guess we are somewhat influencer.
3252000	3254000	Some of you guys in chat are asking about that.
3254000	3255000	So how about that?
3255000	3259000	So I did want to mention since we didn't make it on our show role, but there was a story
3259000	3269000	about Niantic actually partnering with Qualcomm to make AR glasses for Pokemon Go and other
3269000	3270000	things.
3270000	3272000	So that's kind of interesting that they're working on that.
3272000	3278000	It seems like a natural progression in the state of AR gaming is, you know, imagine if
3278000	3282000	you could put on glasses and you will see Pikachu peeking out from behind the bush and
3282000	3285000	like what that trailer for the game looked like when it first came out.
3285000	3288000	Like you get one step closer to that, essentially.
3288000	3289000	So it could be very interesting.
3289000	3291000	You know, someday it'll be pretty interesting.
3291000	3292000	I don't.
3292000	3293000	Ten years.
3293000	3297000	I don't usually use the AR stuff because it eats fucking battery like no one's business.
3297000	3298000	My God.
3298000	3299000	Yes.
3299000	3300000	That'll get better.
3300000	3304000	I played Minecraft Earth a little bit this week, but like it is a battery sink.
3304000	3312000	Like I went from 80 percent to five percent in 20 minutes and it wasn't accurate because
3312000	3317000	like in the game was having trouble this weekend, too, because like I would use the camera to
3317000	3319000	do the AR stuff and it would get frozen.
3319000	3321000	It would like the camera wouldn't move anymore.
3321000	3322000	And it was really annoying.
3322000	3326000	So they reboot my phone several times, reboot the game several times and finally got to
3326000	3327000	work.
3327000	3330000	But then like it just I kept hearing this ding ding ding timer thing.
3330000	3331000	I'm like, what the hell is that?
3331000	3333000	Like, am I being timed to do something here?
3333000	3336000	And then I like logged out because we had to go somewhere.
3336000	3337000	Oh, shit.
3337000	3338000	I have like five percent battery now.
3338000	3342000	And so I charged in my in my car for like two minutes and went up to 30 percent.
3342000	3345000	So obviously that wasn't an exact figure.
3345000	3347000	It was just an estimate based on the battery usage.
3347000	3351000	But that thing eats battery like like you would not believe and overheats the phone
3351000	3354000	just so much like it's so unoptimized.
3354000	3355000	It's ridiculous.
3355000	3357000	But Pokemon Go was like that at one time, too.
3357000	3358000	It was.
3358000	3360000	And also just think about how fast the technology is going to progress.
3360000	3365000	I mean, they're investigating it now because maybe in five to 10 years, this is a reality.
3365000	3368000	You know, we just talked about twenty five years of PlayStation.
3368000	3371000	And if you think about that, think about what the PlayStation one looked like.
3371000	3374000	Think about how the PlayStation one ran on CDs.
3374000	3379000	And that was, you know, the biggest the DVDs weren't even I mean, DVDs may have been a thing,
3379000	3381000	but they weren't a common thing yet.
3381000	3383000	You know, at the time the PlayStation one came out.
3383000	3390000	So look at that versus now where we're at with PlayStation four on the cusp of PlayStation five
3390000	3395000	and how now essentially your games aren't even going to necessarily have media.
3395000	3398000	They come in magically through the air.
3398000	3400000	I think on Wi-Fi. Right.
3400000	3406000	If you're if your PlayStation five is wireless, you there is the media is an illusion.
3406000	3408000	There is no media.
3408000	3413000	You know, the quote is, is that any technology suitably advanced enough can be indistinguishable from magic.
3413000	3419000	Right. So anyway, my point is, is that, you know, the technology may drain your battery like crazy now.
3419000	3422000	But in five, 10 years, either the batteries are going to get bigger.
3422000	3426000	The technology is going to get better. You know, a combination of all those things.
3426000	3432000	And it's it's it's going to be a reality. So processors will get better and it won't be a big drain.
3432000	3440000	And they'll have, you know, better APIs to run everything or tech architecture to run everything through.
3440000	3443000	Metal mayhem and chat says DVDs were invented in 1997.
3443000	3447000	So they weren't around because we're celebrating 25 years of PlayStation. PlayStation was out in 1994.
3447000	3451000	So DVDs technically weren't around yet. But you are right with the second part of that.
3451000	3454000	They become commonplace when PlayStation two was released.
3454000	3460000	I still think personally PlayStation owes a lot of its success to the fact that that thing did play DVDs.
3460000	3465000	And I think Blu-ray became the predominant format because the PlayStation three play blue rays.
3465000	3472000	I think, you know, even though we talk about that, you know, is is a game consoles and entertainment center, is that so important?
3472000	3476000	I mean, how many had a Nintendo Wii that was the Netflix device?
3476000	3479000	And so not anymore. But, you know, and so forth.
3479000	3491000	I think gaming and entertainment kind of synergizing like that has been hugely important, which is why Xbox One tried this sports ball cable, all this stuff that kind of misfired.
3491000	3494000	You know, and we don't know what it's going to look like for PlayStation five.
3494000	3497000	Yeah, they just they marketed that really bad.
3497000	3503000	And I think the message was just kind of like lost in if it had been like it plays games, but it happens to do this, too.
3503000	3508000	And here's I think the picture in picture thing was neat and that could have been as far as they needed to go with it.
3508000	3511000	You know, yeah, that's like me. I don't know.
3511000	3515000	Like now that I think about it, it's like I don't hate it so much anymore.
3515000	3518000	Like just is the messaging was just so bad.
3518000	3521000	The original Xbox One was ahead of its time.
3521000	3529000	I think that to mistake, I didn't think mandatory connect that that's not going to convince me that that was something that was needed.
3529000	3532000	And in the messaging was was lost.
3532000	3538000	And I don't think that that was something that necessarily needed to be disclosed right there either, that it was like, I don't know.
3538000	3542000	It's but yeah, it's whatever.
3542000	3547000	All right. Anyhow, it's funny because this is spawning a little side conversation in chat.
3547000	3554000	Quest Buster saying, I remember when Netflix's stock price tanked hard when they announced they were phasing discs out before reversing that decision,
3554000	3558000	because they were going to spin it into a whole nother company that was like Quickster or something.
3558000	3561000	Yes. And then they wanted to charge you over here and charge over here.
3561000	3565000	The funny thing is Netflix ended doing doing that anyway.
3565000	3568000	They just did it a lot quieter and they did it a few years later.
3568000	3576000	Log into your Netflix account on a computer and you're going to see a little link for DVD and you can still do the Netflix DVD thing.
3576000	3580000	But it's just it's very quiet now and they didn't spin it into a different.
3580000	3583000	I think everybody hated the name Quickster or whatever it was they were calling it.
3583000	3587000	So, no. Anyway, and Bobby is, they still did it.
3587000	3593000	Just DVD dot com. So anyway, sometimes the messaging is is really what it's all about.
3593000	3595000	All right. Anyway, that's enough for our gaming weeks.
3595000	3600000	Let's get into some gaming news. I was going to do housekeeping.
3600000	3604000	I was going to announce the UPS during housekeeping, but I guess we got that.
3604000	3607000	So I don't know what else to say. There's not going to be a show January 19th.
3607000	3611000	I think I mentioned that last week, but we officially got the tickets for that show.
3611000	3616000	We may actually there's not going to be a show at the usual time on January 19th.
3616000	3620000	But I think I was going to talk to you guys about maybe because we haven't done it in a while.
3620000	3626000	If it works for schedules, we'll have it offline, but maybe doing a U.K. time zone show.
3626000	3629000	Yeah. You haven't done one of those in a while. Are you fun? So it might be my son would love to be on it.
3629000	3632000	He keeps asking when you guys are going to do when it's earlier in the day.
3632000	3638000	OK, well, depending on what day we do, we could also kidnap the Sparky the lesser.
3638000	3641000	So maybe we'll figure something out. So maybe we'll do something.
3641000	3647000	It would be like 11 a.m. or noon our time, which would allow our folks in the U.K. to check the show out at a time.
3647000	3652000	We can have both kids. They'd like to talk about. Yeah. All sorts of. So be a little different.
3652000	3656000	Oh, thank you, Bobby, for reminding me. Sometimes I forget the shows are separate.
3656000	3661000	So not everybody's going to hear this if I don't say it here. But there's going to be a co stream later this week.
3661000	3664000	So Bobby and I were just kind of like throwing ideas around.
3664000	3669000	And long story short, we're going to do a stream Thursday night. We're going to do the game awards.
3669000	3674000	We're going to do a little like, I guess, commentary or reaction stream to that.
3674000	3678000	I like to think of it more as a community stream, like come watch the game awards with our community.
3678000	3682000	We'll try to give our insight and our critique.
3682000	3686000	But I want you not to think of that as we're just going to sit there and shit talk the awards the whole time.
3686000	3690000	It's not going to be that kind of stream. There's enough negativity in the game gaming world.
3690000	3694000	But if there's constructive critique, we're not going to hold back on any of that.
3694000	3702000	But I think also reactions to whatever they happen to announce at the game awards will be very cool and things along those lines.
3702000	3708000	So Bobby and I, we did something like this for Square Enix when they did their press conference on Monday night during E3.
3708000	3710000	We did something very similar to this.
3710000	3717000	And I think it was fun because we were able to just, you know, kind of critique because that was when they announced a lot of the Avengers stuff.
3717000	3721000	And so we were kind of critiquing it, but not necessarily in a purely negative way.
3721000	3728000	I am kind of curious to see this here because other than like some of the announcements like the Resident Evil 3 probably being a thing.
3728000	3735000	I don't really know what they're going to announce. That's kind of, I like going into it not knowing anything.
3735000	3740000	There's a weird rumor going around about like leaked audio confirms that Master Chief is coming.
3740000	3742000	Oh fuck that. There's always something.
3742000	3748000	I just, I don't understand why Japan where that game was made is going to give a shit about Master Chief.
3748000	3753000	Is Akuma still watching? Is Halo like recognized in Japan?
3753000	3757000	It wouldn't be Master Chief. It would be like Steve from Minecraft.
3757000	3761000	I would bet Steve from Minecraft way before I would bet.
3761000	3763000	Because like Minecraft is like one.
3763000	3765000	I'm still going for Master Chef. I want Gordon Ramsay.
3765000	3769000	Ok, AkumaJP says yes. So maybe, maybe it could, I don't know.
3769000	3770000	I doubt it.
3770000	3774000	Wasn't there also though another Spartan in Dead or Alive?
3774000	3778000	There was. In Dead or Alive 4 there was a female Spartan.
3778000	3779000	You're right.
3779000	3785000	And she's officially canon for Halo's universe but not for Dead or Alive's universe.
3785000	3789000	I just, I don't know if I see the Master Chief thing. It just doesn't, like you're right.
3789000	3790000	Minecraft.
3790000	3795000	Steve from Minecraft, if it's going to be a Microsoft thing, makes ten times more sex than Master Chief.
3795000	3800000	You could do Alex as an alt character skin stuff. You get the male female stuff going there.
3800000	3801000	Absolutely.
3801000	3803000	But Halo is their flagship franchise.
3803000	3804000	Sure.
3804000	3808000	So I would actually put that over any other of their franchises.
3808000	3811000	I just, but I also think we also got Banjo-Kazooie already.
3811000	3816000	So I just think, honestly, you know what I really, you know what I honestly do think.
3816000	3819000	That also was Nintendo first and foremost and Rare.
3819000	3820000	I know.
3820000	3825000	You know what makes a lot more sense in my opinion, honestly, is just fucking giving the people Waluigi.
3825000	3828000	Just giving the people Waluigi just makes more sense than Master Chief.
3828000	3831000	So I would place bets on that as a Smash reveal.
3831000	3838000	But I do think them revealing a character is not a far-fetched notion at all.
3838000	3843000	This has been done before, like Nintendo has made big announcements before at the Game Awards.
3843000	3851000	I think if you really want to, you know, kind of cross your fingers and your toes, I would hope for some Breath of the Wild 2 footage.
3851000	3859000	More likely, though, is an Animal Crossing info dump because we're only about three months, what, four months out from new Animal Crossing?
3859000	3864000	So that's kind of like the, we'll probably have, set your expectations at the Animal Crossing level.
3864000	3866000	Not that that's a bad thing, but you know, that's the one that's coming out sooner.
3866000	3871000	But like, wish on a star for a Breath of the Wild 2 footage. That seems to be a little more likely.
3871000	3876000	Anyway, we will break this all down live, myself and Bobby, on Thursday.
3876000	3881000	Possibly as an officially recognized thing, because I know we applied for it, but we just haven't heard back.
3881000	3886000	So, but we're, they've said you can co-stream it no matter what, so we're going forward with that.
3886000	3893000	So join our community here over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, that's V-O-G Network.
3893000	3900000	I believe the Game Awards start at 5.30 Pacific, 8.30 Eastern, so we'll probably go live right before just to get settled in and all that good stuff.
3901000	3906000	And we'll see you there, so follow along on Twitch and all that stuff for updates.
3906000	3912000	Alright, now let's get into some gaming news, and some more things maybe we'll see more of at the Game Awards.
3912000	3914000	I don't know, Loki, why don't you start us off?
3914000	3921000	So there was a leaked, or it's delisted now, a trailer that appeared on Square Enix's YouTube page,
3921000	3931000	showing off Kingdom Hearts 3 DLC Remind, that's going to be coming on the PlayStation 4, January 23rd, 2020.
3931000	3936000	And then later it'll be released on Xbox One, February 25th, 2020.
3936000	3941000	Since then, of course, the trailer has, like I said, been delisted, it's private, you can't watch it anymore.
3941000	3942000	But the...
3942000	3945000	Ooh, maybe because it was a Game Awards thing, also.
3945000	3951000	But then you got the information, though, from that, so the official overview, which was posted with the trailer.
3951000	3952000	It says,
3975000	3987000	And apparently they had appearances by other Final Fantasy characters, Aerith, Leon, and Yuffie, so...
3987000	3988000	Interesting.
3988000	3992000	Interesting that it's still kind of relying on the older Final Fantasy characters than it is the newer ones.
3992000	3995000	Like, I would have expected, you know, Prompto or something to show up, but...
3995000	4000000	Well, but then the 7 Remake is on its way, so maybe it does make more sense, I don't know.
4000000	4002000	So, pretty neat.
4002000	4004000	Yeah, I think people are looking for...
4004000	4008000	I still need to go back and play Kingdom Hearts 3, a game I purchased and just, like, forgot about.
4008000	4011000	I played a good chunk of it, but I need to go back and beat it, I really do.
4011000	4016000	Because I held back on playing Kingdom Hearts 3 because I've never really played through Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2.
4016000	4024000	And then I tried watching, like, a summary of Kingdom Hearts, which, mind you, a summary of Kingdom Hearts is, like, three or four hours long.
4024000	4030000	And I'm like, I don't fucking know what's going on after watching all of that, like, it makes no goddamn sense to me.
4030000	4039000	So, I think I'll just have to play the game without actually understanding the depth of the story, because it makes no fucking sense.
4039000	4042000	Yep. I figured that was...
4042000	4048000	Yeah, I've tried to get the story summarized as well, and it's, like, you just have to let it go.
4048000	4057000	You just have to take it as a visually stimulating, pretty game, and Disney characters, and yelling at Donald because he can't heal.
4057000	4059000	You just have to take it for granted.
4059000	4060000	Donald, heal please.
4060000	4067000	Alright. Anyway, let's move on. Let's talk about an actual update for Switch Online Classic.
4067000	4069000	Yes, we were just complaining about this last week.
4069000	4071000	We were just complaining about this last week.
4071000	4072000	They apparently are watching.
4072000	4076000	Who knew complaining to the manager works sometimes? No, in all seriousness, we did get...
4076000	4077000	Okay, Karen.
4077000	4081000	Okay, we did get... well, you know, okay, tangent, ready?
4081000	4084000	You know how they're saying, you know how OK Boomer is a thing, right?
4084000	4090000	You know, when Billy Dee Williams says he's never heard of gender fluidity. Okay, Boomer.
4090000	4092000	You know, things like that, right?
4092000	4098000	Now, apparently, some folks, some younger folks are calling Generation X the Karen generation.
4098000	4099000	That's what I heard.
4099000	4100000	Yeah.
4100000	4101000	We are the Karen generation.
4101000	4109000	But keep in mind that half of us has stayed true to our Gen X roots of apathy and disappointment, and the other half became Karen.
4109000	4110000	True.
4110000	4112000	True. Alright, anyway, moving on from that.
4112000	4116000	You know what I remember from when I was your age, these were the games for all the rage.
4116000	4118000	Actually, I am pretty hyped for these updates for a couple reasons.
4118000	4124000	So, they're updating both the SNES and the NES library, which is interesting.
4124000	4127000	So, the SNES library is getting four updates here in the US.
4127000	4134000	Star Fox 2, which is a pretty big deal, because that was limited to that Super Nintendo Classic.
4134000	4140000	But since that was a limited time thing, if you never were able to get your hands on one, now you'll be able to play Star Fox 2.
4140000	4142000	And see that it wasn't really that great anyway.
4142000	4143000	It wasn't really that good anyway.
4143000	4145000	But you'll be able to play that.
4145000	4149000	A game that I think was a little better, Super Punch Out is also going to be there.
4149000	4153000	Kirby Super Star, which I actually didn't realize wasn't already there.
4153000	4156000	But that was the... Kirby Super Star is like the mini game collection.
4156000	4158000	The eight games in one that had like the Kirby...
4158000	4159000	I just perked up.
4159000	4161000	Wild Gunman and all that, oh yeah, I'm sure.
4161000	4163000	Kirby Super Star, fuck yes.
4163000	4165000	I had that game too, that game was fun.
4165000	4170000	I liked the one that was basically Wild Gunman, but it was Kirby characters, it was cute.
4170000	4171000	Very simple.
4171000	4174000	And then Breath of Fire 2, so that's pretty cool too.
4174000	4177000	A very big RPG making its way to the Super Nintendo library.
4177000	4179000	So, that alone is a pretty cool update.
4179000	4182000	But then, ho ho then, on the NES side.
4182000	4186000	So, a game that was brought up on the show not that long ago.
4186000	4190000	Journey to Silius is coming out on the NES side of things.
4190000	4193000	So, that's kind of fun, right? So, you can hear the music now in that game.
4193000	4195000	So, you can check that out on the NES.
4195000	4202000	But, here is the Weave Snatcher to snatch all wigs in the universe.
4202000	4203000	And this is huge on the NES.
4203000	4206000	Crystalis is coming out to the library.
4206000	4209000	Fuck yes, that game is so good.
4209000	4213000	And now you don't have to buy that SNK collection just so you can play Crystalis on the Switch.
4213000	4215000	So, that is great.
4215000	4217000	That is a Christmas gift.
4217000	4219000	That is amazing. That's so cool.
4219000	4220000	So cool.
4220000	4225000	Now, usually I like to look at, well, okay, if this is what's going on in the US,
4225000	4227000	then what's going on in Japan?
4227000	4234000	And the Japanese releases, they don't look as strong in Japan, I gotta say.
4234000	4237000	The Japanese releases are a little different.
4237000	4239000	My original link didn't work here.
4239000	4241000	Let's see.
4241000	4245000	In Japan, they're only getting four games.
4245000	4248000	Famicom is getting Famicom Wars.
4248000	4250000	So, that's kind of cool.
4250000	4254000	And that's the Wars series where Advance Wars, I think, is the game most of you know.
4254000	4257000	So, if you want to go back and play the original one on the NES,
4257000	4261000	Famicom Wars is probably the coolest little different thing that's coming out.
4261000	4265000	But they're not getting Crystalis, and they're not getting Journey to Silius.
4265000	4268000	They're getting a Sunsoft game called Route 16.
4268000	4270000	That wasn't very good, sorry.
4270000	4272000	That game is going to be coming out on the NES.
4272000	4276000	And then on the Super Nintendo side, they're only getting Star Fox 2
4276000	4280000	and the Kirby Deluxe, their version of that game.
4280000	4283000	Hoshi no Kirby Super Deluxe is their version.
4283000	4284000	They're getting that.
4284000	4287000	They are not getting Super Punch-Out! and they're not getting Breath of Fire 2.
4287000	4289000	Did they already have those, maybe?
4289000	4290000	No.
4290000	4296000	So, this is the first time in a long time, I can think, where Japan did not get as strong.
4296000	4297000	Well, unless you're a Wars fan.
4297000	4302000	If you're all about Advance Wars, then maybe it is a stronger list for you.
4302000	4304000	But for me, it's really not.
4304000	4308000	But the nice thing is, is that again, and this holds true in Japan as well,
4308000	4310000	the Switch is region-free.
4310000	4313000	So, you can always create an account in the other region for free
4313000	4317000	and download the other region's player, because that's what I did for Japan.
4317000	4322000	And then once you download it, you can log in with your local account for me,
4322000	4326000	my American account, and I can play the Famicom and all that stuff just fine.
4326000	4329000	So, if I really do want to play Famicom Wars, it is possible.
4329000	4331000	And the same would be true for those of you in Japan.
4331000	4334000	If you really, really wanted to play Super Punch-Out! or Crystallis,
4334000	4338000	which Crystallis must not have been a thing in Japan, I guess.
4338000	4339000	That's kind of surprising.
4339000	4341000	I would have thought that game, I don't know.
4341000	4344000	But there might also be weird rights things because of the SNK release.
4344000	4345000	I don't know.
4345000	4346000	There might be some weird rights issues there.
4346000	4347000	I don't know.
4347000	4348000	I don't know what the cold up is.
4348000	4350000	But that is what's coming out on the Switch online.
4350000	4352000	So, very jazzed for those updates.
4352000	4354000	Wish we were getting them a little more regularly,
4354000	4357000	but at the same time, I'll also take what I can get.
4357000	4358000	All right, moving on.
4358000	4359000	Dark Sakura.
4359000	4364000	So, sometimes these slower news weeks, as far as game releases,
4364000	4368000	we get interesting gaming studies and gaming effects, right?
4368000	4370000	That's one of my big interests is, of course,
4370000	4373000	looking at the impact of video gaming on the world
4373000	4375000	and not just the games themselves.
4375000	4379000	And there was a really good write-up in Psychology Today that,
4379000	4383000	believe it or not, I read Psychology Today fairly regularly.
4383000	4388000	This was actually one of the blog posts from December 6th.
4388000	4393000	It was written by, let me get the fellow's name again, Guy Winch.
4393000	4397000	And it's talking there about how video games can actually boost
4397000	4401000	your emotional health and reduce your sense of loneliness.
4401000	4407000	And this is, you know, phrased in, you know, the bad side of gaming culture,
4407000	4413000	being sexist, racist, homophobia, video game addiction, stuff like that.
4413000	4417000	And while there are some detrimental parts of video gaming culture
4417000	4422000	as a whole, most of the time, you know, when people are reporting on this,
4422000	4425000	they're only reporting on the bad because that's what sells.
4425000	4426000	It's what gets attention.
4426000	4429000	They're not talking about the positive sides of things.
4429000	4437000	So, there's an example of actually an EA game called Sea of Solitude.
4437000	4443000	It came out in 2013, but it was created by Cornelia Geppert after a breakup.
4443000	4446000	And the main character, Kay, has to fight with humans
4446000	4449000	who have become monsters because they became too lonely.
4449000	4453000	And she uses that to fight her own loneliness.
4453000	4455000	And it brings out those feelings of emotion
4455000	4458000	and somebody who can actually be a little cathartic for them.
4458000	4465000	Multiplayer platforms are also really good for people who are, say, homebound.
4465000	4469000	You know, people with chronic illnesses, people with a disability,
4469000	4474000	some people who maybe have social anxiety issues or, you know,
4474000	4477000	any other thing like that, it helps them connect with a greater community
4477000	4481000	that they wouldn't have access to in person because of those limitations.
4481000	4485000	Also, a lot of these, especially ones that require group effort,
4485000	4493000	teach teamwork, teach, what's the other thing, delegation, even negotiation.
4493000	4498000	So, a lot of these things with some of these other levels of social interaction,
4499000	4504000	even with a 2014 psychology review,
4504000	4507000	actually said that video games can help gamers,
4507000	4508000	and this is a quote,
4508000	4512000	flourish psychologically by generating positive emotions,
4512000	4516000	boosting individual functioning, and enhancing social connections,
4516000	4521000	all of which contribute to mental health and well-being, end quote.
4521000	4524000	Sorry, I just want to add to what you're saying,
4524000	4526000	the whole, like, you know, when you're talking about, you know,
4526000	4528000	the coordinating with others and things like that,
4528000	4531000	I think about, like, taking out, like, big raid bosses
4531000	4534000	in a game like World of Warcraft or something,
4534000	4537000	especially if you're in one of those groups that tries to be on the cutting edge of things.
4537000	4540000	Like, if you're trying to take out big raid bosses,
4540000	4543000	bitch, that's project planning at that point because you're planning out,
4543000	4546000	okay, who's going to make the craftables?
4546000	4548000	Who's going to make the, you know, drop the potion table?
4548000	4550000	Who's going to drop the food table?
4550000	4552000	Who's going to be working on gearing up?
4552000	4554000	Okay, we need a breakout group to go gear up over here,
4554000	4556000	and then we're going to, like, that is your fucking project planning.
4556000	4558000	And there's going to be the snarky bitch that calls everybody out.
4558000	4562000	Yeah, or who is leading on Discord, who is marking things.
4562000	4567000	That all plays into it. Sorry, it's fascinating because it is those type of skills.
4567000	4569000	And I'll keep in mind, I never did anything on Discord.
4569000	4572000	I always typed everything out.
4572000	4575000	But it does also improve your communication skills overall
4575000	4579000	because you learn tact and you learn your audience.
4579000	4584000	So, especially if you're, say, not a person with great typing communication skills,
4584000	4586000	but say you don't have Discord,
4586000	4590000	this will also teach you how to think quickly, type it quickly.
4590000	4595000	Honestly, I learned how to type through just trying to keep up with my roommates on AOL.
4595000	4598000	So, but it also will teach you ways of phrasing, positioning,
4598000	4600000	how to show respect to other people,
4600000	4604000	because you know the people who are being just complete chuds in, you know, chat.
4604000	4608000	They're not the ones who really end up getting paid much attention to.
4608000	4612000	It's the people who are carefully phrasing things, explaining things, the helpful people,
4612000	4615000	or as Mr. Rogers said, always look for the helpers.
4615000	4618000	But you learn that that kind of communication,
4618000	4623000	that your positioning skills are what's going to get you more attention,
4623000	4626000	more prominence in your various groups.
4626000	4629000	This comment from Questbuster in chat is so good.
4629000	4632000	Reminds me of a story I read from an old magazine from the 80s,
4632000	4636000	digitally archived, that talked about how a psychologist used wizardry,
4636000	4642000	that's a game, to help troubled youth, not the actual act of wizardry, just to be clear.
4642000	4644000	Thanks for that clarification.
4644000	4646000	Just to be clear, the game wizardry.
4646000	4650000	A psychologist used wizardry to help troubled youth to break out of their shell
4650000	4653000	when they started talking about their characters.
4653000	4656000	As they became more invested in their character's growth,
4656000	4658000	they started becoming more social.
4658000	4660000	And you know, I think back to my own childhood,
4660000	4664000	and you know, obviously I was picked on a lot for being effeminate,
4664000	4667000	and I wasn't super into sports.
4667000	4671000	I played soccer for a long time, but you don't really play soccer on recess grounds.
4671000	4674000	I didn't really want to play those same types of games and things like that.
4674000	4679000	For the record, I would now say that the word effeminate may not be appropriate.
4679000	4683000	I would say that you had a different masculinity.
4683000	4687000	Okay, that came from a perspective of me being 12 years old, to be clear.
4687000	4690000	However, all that being said,
4690000	4694000	I would say that when,
4694000	4697000	and I was picked on a lot for the sports things and all that other stuff,
4697000	4700000	but when I was the cool kid,
4700000	4703000	so it's like the bully would beat me up or whatever.
4703000	4706000	I didn't get actually physically beat up a lot,
4706000	4708000	but you know, verbally assault me or whatever.
4708000	4710000	And then when nobody else around, it was,
4710000	4714000	hey, where's level seven on the second quest in Zelda?
4714000	4717000	And you know, at that age,
4717000	4720000	I wasn't confident enough to say, you know, fuck you, you fucking fuck.
4720000	4722000	Find it yourself, you dumb fuck.
4722000	4725000	I wasn't really able to really say that.
4725000	4727000	So I would tell them, you know, because like,
4727000	4730000	oh, I have a chance to fit in suddenly and be a part of this.
4730000	4732000	And video games were kind of that for me.
4732000	4735000	So I'm sorry, but Quest Buster's comment about the 80s
4735000	4737000	and the wizardry and helping kids come out of their shell,
4737000	4740000	in a way, like games, because that's what I was into when I was younger,
4740000	4745000	that ended up being the thing that I could connect with other kids on
4745000	4749000	when some of the things that were more, you know, mainstream,
4749000	4752000	like sports and stuff, I didn't connect with.
4752000	4754000	Well, and the other thing, too, you remember those stories
4754000	4756000	that were coming out when Pokemon Go came out
4756000	4762000	about people with severe social anxiety leaving their homes to play Pokemon Go
4762000	4765000	and finding that that was their common ground for other people
4765000	4768000	that they would see outside playing it and expanding their friend groups.
4768000	4771000	You know, I've made friends, you know, that like,
4771000	4774000	even though I'm not really playing Ingress anymore,
4774000	4779000	I met, you know, some of the local people in my area playing Ingress,
4779000	4782000	just I'd see them looking at their phone or I'd have someone say,
4782000	4784000	hey, if you stand a little bit away from that portal,
4784000	4785000	you'll cast a better thing.
4785000	4789000	That's how I learned what I knew for a lot of Ingress tactics,
4789000	4794000	was meeting, like, Orville in my area.
4794000	4796000	Really just fantastic person, really nice.
4796000	4797000	He sadly doesn't play anymore.
4797000	4799000	Yeah, well, neither do I.
4799000	4801000	Yeah, I know, but, you know,
4801000	4803000	because a lot of that has moved to Pokemon Go
4803000	4805000	and now our chat is lighting up a little bit on Pokemon Go.
4805000	4809000	ActDef says, I made so many new friends by playing Pokemon Go.
4809000	4810000	Absolutely.
4810000	4813000	Or, like, Ingress, like Mr. Smoosh's cat sitters,
4813000	4816000	because even though Dark Sakura is always kind and she'll do it when she can.
4816000	4817000	Is it who I think it is?
4817000	4820000	It's a drive for her, right?
4820000	4824000	Do you know Skarina?
4824000	4825000	I'll tell you offline.
4825000	4826000	It's not Dana.
4826000	4827000	No, it's not Dana.
4827000	4828000	Okay.
4828000	4829000	No, although Dana's great.
4829000	4830000	We've been to the movies.
4830000	4836000	But the two that live really close by have been cat sitting Mr. Smoosh,
4836000	4838000	because, you know, for you, it takes 30 minutes to get out here.
4838000	4840000	I would gladly do it, but it is a schlep.
4840000	4842000	Yeah, for them, they're five minutes, you know,
4842000	4844000	and we're going on that cruise in March, right?
4844000	4846000	And so it's going to be a lot to ask of you,
4846000	4847000	but for these guys, you know.
4847000	4850000	I'm trying to convince Dan we need a Disney trip,
4850000	4852000	so I might need help with.
4852000	4853000	Oh, sure, we can.
4853000	4856000	But actually, no, because Ryan lives in my neighborhood now,
4856000	4857000	so I can have Ryan do it.
4857000	4858000	Yeah.
4858000	4860000	But yeah, the Midnaator.
4860000	4861000	I can't say.
4861000	4864000	Shermanator was so easy with Shermy, and I can't do that with Midna.
4864000	4865000	Yeah.
4865000	4866000	The brat.
4866000	4870000	But anyway, I mean, it's like, well, even back when I was playing D&D,
4870000	4874000	when I started getting into playing my boyfriend at the time, Ben,
4874000	4876000	who we called him Ben the head.
4876000	4878000	He was awesome because he had a big noggin.
4878000	4883000	He got me into playing rifts, and that expanded my friend group
4883000	4886000	just with tabletop gaming, finding people,
4886000	4889000	oh, yeah, you want to do this experimental thing that just came out?
4889000	4890000	Yeah, go for it.
4890000	4891000	Here's your graphing calculator.
4891000	4892000	Good luck.
4892000	4894000	Because rifts is crazy.
4894000	4897000	And then from there, I got into other D&D groups,
4897000	4903000	and my roommate in college, I became good friends with her.
4903000	4904000	Well, you know Gwen.
4904000	4905000	Yeah.
4905000	4906000	Yeah.
4906000	4909000	Because of our gaming group, we had the same circle of friends.
4909000	4911000	The friends group expanded.
4911000	4912000	I'm still friends with them.
4912000	4914000	I've seen their children grow up.
4914000	4917000	I know we've really taken this story and run with it,
4917000	4921000	but at the same time, as far as gamings and improving moods
4921000	4926000	and social interactions and so forth, hello, look at this.
4926000	4927000	Look at this.
4927000	4928000	This.
4928000	4929000	This.
4929000	4930000	What is this?
4930000	4934000	This gives me the same feeling that my old D&D group gave me in Alabama
4934000	4938000	because I would go through, and I was busy with classes.
4938000	4940000	I would take 18 units.
4940000	4942000	I was that person.
4942000	4947000	Or when I broke my ankle, I was just hanging in the group playing magic,
4947000	4949000	my magic group.
4949000	4951000	I made a lot of friends that way.
4951000	4954000	But going to my D&D group, whereas I'd tell Grandmom,
4954000	4958000	I'm going to sacrifice chickens now because she thought it was.
4958000	4959000	Yeah.
4959000	4961000	Like, I'm going to my weekly chicken sacrifice.
4961000	4962000	Okay.
4962000	4966000	But at any rate, coming here is the same thing.
4966000	4968000	I have that same kind of camaraderie
4968000	4973000	and that same feeling of a regular place where I know I'm going to
4973000	4976000	and I will be accepted for myself.
4976000	4978000	Or, sorry, I'm a mouthy bitch.
4978000	4979000	Deal with it.
4979000	4980000	And guess what?
4980000	4982000	You both deal with it beautifully.
4982000	4985000	It's funny, and maybe Azet can attest to this, too,
4985000	4988000	because I know Azet from Ingress and that whole community,
4988000	4991000	and we were just having a conversation.
4991000	4995000	We as a group were just having a conversation the other day about,
4995000	4999000	you know, Ingress is kind of seems like its star is fading a little bit,
4999000	5001000	as they haven't done a lot to really push the game forward
5001000	5003000	as we thought was going to happen with Prime.
5003000	5005000	And the topic came up that was like,
5005000	5007000	if this game were to go under tomorrow,
5007000	5010000	I'd still go out to Mongolian barbecue with you guys once in a while.
5010000	5011000	You know?
5011000	5012000	It was that kind of thing.
5012000	5013000	I would like to meet these people.
5013000	5014000	Oh, yeah, sure.
5014000	5016000	And go to Mongolian barbecue.
5016000	5019000	We will have a Mongolian barbecue night just for you,
5019000	5024000	but you'll have to boot your game and deploy your aid on the portal.
5024000	5025000	Okay.
5025000	5027000	I need more bursters.
5027000	5031000	Dude, I will go to some of these portals and just power up my crap.
5031000	5032000	Okay.
5032000	5033000	Well, I'll do it for you.
5033000	5037000	Don't do it tonight because they know I'm busy on Sundays.
5037000	5039000	They like to tear it through here.
5039000	5040000	Or whatever.
5040000	5042000	I'm thinking Pokémon, but I can still tap them for stuff.
5042000	5043000	Sure, of course.
5043000	5044000	Yeah.
5044000	5045000	Anyway.
5045000	5046000	I'll tap that portal.
5046000	5049000	But my point is that the game brought us together,
5049000	5051000	but the game doesn't have to keep us together.
5051000	5055000	Or, like, how often do we go out and play Para Para?
5055000	5056000	Perfect.
5056000	5061000	We all stopped playing DDR regularly many years ago,
5061000	5063000	and that's not an anti-DDR anti thing.
5063000	5066000	It's a they didn't make DDR for a long time.
5066000	5068000	It was harder to find.
5068000	5071000	We all got older and have more medical conditions.
5071000	5074000	That's why we expanded our repertoire away from music games
5074000	5076000	and went into the general.
5076000	5077000	Yes, yes, yes.
5077000	5080000	Into our beautiful little niche on the internet.
5080000	5081000	Very much that.
5081000	5082000	Very much that.
5082000	5085000	Where we are the world's best internet gaming podcast.
5085000	5087000	Subjectively.
5087000	5088000	All right.
5088000	5089000	And Humble.
5089000	5090000	Don't forget.
5090000	5091000	And Humble.
5091000	5092000	Fuck the whole Humble thing.
5092000	5093000	I'll brag all fucking day.
5093000	5095000	We've been doing this shit for a while.
5095000	5097000	No, no, no, no.
5097000	5100000	I am beyond hashtag blessed.
5100000	5101000	Fuck that shit.
5101000	5105000	We made this shit happen.
5105000	5108000	Let me put the mic down.
5108000	5109000	Hashtag blessed.
5109000	5110000	Okay.
5110000	5111000	Finish your thought.
5111000	5113000	But we made this shit happen.
5113000	5116000	You know, and I was actually even that podcast that I love,
5116000	5117000	Stuff Mom Never Told You,
5117000	5120000	they did a whole thing about the hashtag blessed and the humble brag and everything.
5120000	5122000	Fuck humble bragging.
5122000	5124000	I am going to ego brag.
5124000	5128000	We come to this shit every weekend.
5128000	5130000	We made this shit happen.
5130000	5132000	We got the equipment.
5132000	5135000	Well, you mostly got the equipment, but you know, I use my discount.
5135000	5138000	You know, we made all of this happen.
5138000	5141000	The three of us did this.
5141000	5144000	And I think we have every right to be fucking proud of ourselves.
5144000	5146000	I'm going to put that out there right now.
5146000	5150000	This is a tangent that I will build my mountain on and die on it.
5150000	5152000	We made this shit happen.
5152000	5153000	Fuck humble bragging.
5153000	5154000	I'm with that.
5154000	5156000	But I think you also have to have a sense of humility.
5156000	5158000	I think about why we had help.
5158000	5159000	Sure.
5159000	5163000	But sure, this this stays here because of the kindness of people like Jason,
5163000	5164000	of people like Bobby.
5164000	5165000	You know, you're right.
5165000	5167000	There's there's help in getting here.
5167000	5170000	And just the fact that, like, you know, we're not the most downloaded.
5170000	5172000	What most people don't know who the fuck we are.
5172000	5173000	But that's that's OK.
5173000	5175000	I can see you guys.
5175000	5176000	We can be gracious.
5176000	5177000	Yeah.
5177000	5183000	But I think that we need to put aside a little bit of humility and realize the hard work that we put into making this happen.
5183000	5184000	You can have a little bit of both.
5184000	5191000	You have a little bit of both, but it's just the whole thing like they do the humble brag thing to make it look like, oh, I'm not that important.
5191000	5192000	But look at this.
5192000	5200000	No, there's there's no putting in the humble brag is a little bit of a I am all about bragging for the things that we worked.
5200000	5203000	Our took us collective took us on to make happen.
5203000	5206000	And we we can go even further.
5206000	5208000	And but I do have a lot of gracious.
5208000	5211000	I'm not just saying, oh, no, fuck all of y'all who helped us.
5211000	5214000	I'm not saying that at all. Thank you to everyone who helped us.
5214000	5217000	Yes. At the same time, we can't discount the effort we put into it.
5217000	5220000	Sure. So I didn't mean to tangent in that respect.
5220000	5224000	No, you're fine. I feel very good about that. She-Hulk says it's not bragging if you did it.
5224000	5227000	And Nifty 805 says, yes, Sakura, slay mama. Right.
5227000	5231000	Pod Culture says, but do any of you have a Parsec Award?
5231000	5241000	No, but the Parsec Awards were mostly for like fiction and that type of stuff anyway, which is the only category we would qualify for is a very niche thing.
5241000	5244000	But my point is, we may not have that award, but we did.
5244000	5248000	We were the very first gaming award for the podcast awards.
5248000	5249000	That is correct.
5249000	5251000	Back when people kind of cared about those. So.
5251000	5256000	And you know who I got my my because I went to pick it up.
5256000	5261000	I was and I got it from Adam Curry. Yeah. With his short hair.
5261000	5267000	And I was like, I was kind of disappointed because I was like, I remember you on MTV and you had gorgeous hair.
5267000	5271000	I always forget that you actually went to that. You went to that awards thing in person and picked it up.
5271000	5276000	Yeah, it was not in San Diego, but I stayed in La Jolla with my friend.
5276000	5280000	Yeah. And yeah, no, I actually take it back.
5280000	5287000	I stayed in Coronado with my sister and then I went out to do that, hung out because Julie and Krista were there hanging out in La Jolla.
5287000	5291000	It's funny, DJ Rama says, where is that award? At my house.
5291000	5294000	And Jamie's shelf.
5294000	5295000	It's in my house.
5295000	5300000	To be fair, we did the show at her house for a long time and it was one of those things we never thought to bring over.
5300000	5302000	But yeah, that's funny.
5302000	5307000	Where is that award? Was she? Well, she went to go pick it up and then she kept it.
5307000	5313000	Well, you know, I did. I did drive all the way to San Diego.
5313000	5315000	I remember the night.
5315000	5317000	The PT Cruiser.
5317000	5327000	I remember the night the three of us went to San Bruno or wherever it was out by the airport for the live 365 awards because that was the year we were nominated for station of the year.
5327000	5329000	I won something.
5329000	5331000	Oh, I got the clip speaker.
5331000	5333000	You won like a lottery. You didn't win.
5333000	5335000	We got shut out.
5335000	5339000	I also won like a remote for like it was a.
5339000	5341000	Yeah, we all won door prizes.
5341000	5346000	But did the station win any awards? I don't think we did.
5346000	5351000	No, we didn't because remember they forgot to even not like read our nomination.
5351000	5353000	Yeah, because you were in the back going, hey.
5353000	5358000	But yeah, no, we were we were that movie that got nominated for like four Oscars that didn't go home with any.
5358000	5365000	But it was. But still, that night we kind of like we were going in there and the three of us were together and take it, taking our pictures.
5365000	5370000	And, you know, we kind of felt like not a parsec award. It was like a podcasting award.
5370000	5372000	Yeah, it was like the podcast award.
5372000	5374000	It was simply podcast awards.
5374000	5376000	Yeah, they're still around. They're just very different.
5376000	5381000	I'll take a picture of it when I know I know where it is. It's on the shelf by my computer.
5381000	5384000	Yeah, because I look I've seen it when I've gone to your house. That's how I knew it was there.
5384000	5390000	Yeah, I look at that thing with pride and honor and memories of Adam Curry's lack of hair.
5390000	5393000	He's still pretty, though. But back then, he was still pretty.
5393000	5397000	All right. Let's move on. We did a lot of tangents. That was that was good.
5397000	5402000	Sadly, we have to go from some good, great topics to not so great.
5402000	5405000	I mean, it depends how you look at it. I guess it is good news.
5405000	5409000	Well, it's not not great that there had been a lawsuit,
5409000	5418000	but it's good that the outcome is at least positive in the towards the female employees that were part of the lawsuit.
5418000	5431000	So Riot Games will now have to pay out at least 10 million dollars combined to each of the female employers or employees that they've had for the last five years.
5431000	5435000	So that's supposed to be split about a thousand ways.
5435000	5447000	And apparently this is for any workers who had worked at Riot Games between the period of November 2014 and the final settlement settlement day.
5447000	5456000	It says they'll receive each of an allocation of the fund decreed by their duration and contract status as a Riot employee.
5456000	5466000	And apparently it represents the degree of justice for women in Riot Games, many of whom previously staged protests against them.
5466000	5474000	So it's nice to see they're getting paid out. Unfortunately, they had to get that far to the point where that they lost the lawsuit to that.
5474000	5479000	Yeah. No, I mean, and then that whole subject has been really like when it comes to Riot.
5480000	5487000	But I, you know, and hopefully this can help us move on. I say us is like the industry and everything.
5487000	5498000	You know, I can't say us isn't, you know, because I'm not a woman, but I can hope that this will maybe be something that's like, OK, now we can move on and Riot as a company can be stronger.
5498000	5503000	And maybe the gaming industry can kind of learn from this and make an environment more welcoming to everybody.
5503000	5510000	So I would hope so to put that gender discrimination behind them. But yeah, we'll see.
5510000	5518000	I mean, it's a matter of like, you know, after this is done, do things change or is it just like, oh, it's the price of doing business, you know, type of thing?
5518000	5526000	I don't know. Gaming is for everyone. Put it on the wall, you know, put it in your boardrooms at these gaming companies across America.
5526000	5530000	Remember, that should be one of the primary rules of developing games. Gaming is for everyone. Don't forget it.
5530000	5538000	Like there's no reason to make people feel excluded. Why? That's a horrible thing. Nobody likes it when that's done to them.
5538000	5551000	So I just, you know, it's silly. So anyway, I hope this goes a ways in letting the industry as a whole kind of move on and remember and act better and do better next time.
5551000	5552000	Yes, definitely.
5552000	5559000	For sure. OK, anyway, let's move on and talk a little bit about some changes that have happened with Super Mario Maker 2,
5559000	5561000	which I did peek at this week a little bit.
5561000	5562000	Yeah, it's pretty cool.
5562000	5571000	Yeah, they did a big update to the game, which is nice because I feel like Mario Maker 2 kind of like came and went and they haven't been doing a lot to maintain it or it didn't seem like they were.
5571000	5580000	And then this came out of nowhere. And I think part of the reason it didn't seem like they were doing a lot was because like that whole of the amiibo question mark blocks
5580000	5585000	and the limited time little sprites you could get for 8-bit Mario mode and all that stuff that was in the original Mario Maker.
5585000	5586000	It's kind of gone.
5586000	5596000	Yeah, it kind of went away. But now we're seeing maybe a version 2.0 of that, literally, because version 2.0 of Super Mario Maker 2 came out this week on December 5th.
5596000	5602000	And one of the biggest new things in this is that now there is a Master Sword item within Super Mario Maker.
5602000	5603000	It's pretty awesome.
5603000	5608000	Yeah, and the Master Sword turns you into Link and it gives you new moves.
5608000	5616000	So now you have a sword, you can shoot arrows and drop bombs and you can do kind of like the little sword hopping kind of is like Zelda 2.
5616000	5617000	The downward thrust.
5617000	5628000	Yeah, the downward thrust and all that stuff. So it's kind of neat. So obviously these new mechanics will now lend themselves to all these new ideas when it comes to the creator mode.
5628000	5633000	The only downside is I haven't really found a way to like find these levels specifically.
5633000	5636000	Like you either have to find codes on Twitter, you kind of look through the popular stuff.
5636000	5637000	Yeah, I don't
5637000	5640000	It's a little harder to find that. I didn't find an official level.
5640000	5642000	It would be nice if they had a way to, you know,
5643000	5644000	Maybe I missed it.
5644000	5647000	Meta tag these things so that you'd have ways to search stuff.
5647000	5648000	Yeah.
5648000	5654000	But that would be too close to the internet. Nintendo doesn't go close to the internet because that's like the sun. They don't fly too close to the sun.
5654000	5660000	Dr Tetsuya in chat says, I do like the idea of this better because the Mega Man 1 stuff was just a reskin.
5660000	5663000	I'm sorry, Mario Maker 1. I don't know why when I see MM1 I go Mega Man.
5663000	5668000	Mario Maker 1 stuff was just a reskin, but this is legitimately like having Link and Super Mario Brothers.
5668000	5672000	Bobby says, I found a great level that helps you learn the Link stuff.
5672000	5680000	Yeah, but usually like in Mario Maker 1, these limited time, you know, skins would come with a demo level, which is usually how you earn the skin.
5680000	5682000	And that isn't here.
5682000	5683000	Yeah.
5683000	5686000	Which is a little weird, but I mean, again, I'd rather have it than not have it.
5686000	5692000	So what they did add, which was interesting, was speed running or a level.
5692000	5701000	So there was like an official level that will help you with speed running and they call it the Ninji because the little ninja star thing.
5701000	5702000	Ninja characters.
5702000	5703000	Yeah, they're called Ninji.
5703000	5715000	Yeah. So the Ninji levels you and what's cool is that after you beat it and why they call it Ninji is that then all the ghost ninjis that represent other speed runners show up the second time.
5715000	5718000	So you can see the bar a little better at what there is to beat.
5718000	5722000	And there is an official, it's a snowball level, right, for the holidays.
5722000	5725000	So it's not a Christmas level, but it's like a winter wonderland type of thing.
5725000	5731000	So it has, you know, the little guys, what do you call those guys that throw up the spike balls and then launch them at you?
5731000	5732000	They were in like Mario 3.
5732000	5733000	Oh, I don't remember.
5733000	5734000	You know what I'm talking about?
5734000	5737000	Those guys that would look up and they'd throw up the spike ball and then throw it at you.
5737000	5739000	Yeah, they're new to this patch.
5739000	5744000	They're now in Mario Maker, but in this Ninji level, they do snowballs.
5744000	5745000	Yes.
5745000	5748000	It's cute, right, because you can pick up the snowballs and throw them back at them.
5748000	5753000	Some of the other things that are new in this, oh, it's Spike.
5753000	5755000	The name of the character is actually Spike.
5755000	5757000	Not to be confused with Game Buoy Spike.
5757000	5758000	Happy belated birthday, by the way.
5758000	5761000	But Spike is the actual name of the character in Mario.
5761000	5766000	Also added is Dash Blocks, but that's only in Mario 3D World.
5766000	5769000	Frozen Coins, which is when they're encased in the ice.
5769000	5770000	Have you seen that before?
5770000	5771000	P-Blocks.
5771000	5772000	Cool.
5772000	5773000	That's going to be a big one.
5773000	5778000	And then Pokey, the stacked cactus thing is now available as well.
5778000	5780000	Which you can make fly and it's kind of crazy.
5780000	5784000	Which is also a snowman in that limited time level.
5784000	5787000	So kind of neat that they're adding that type of stuff.
5787000	5791000	So really cool to see this Mario Maker 2 update just when I was like, oh, I guess that kind of came and went.
5791000	5794000	No, they're kind of supporting it with some more updates.
5794000	5795000	That's really cool to see.
5795000	5796000	Happy to see it.
5796000	5797000	So yeah, the meta tags.
5797000	5800000	I like that idea for maybe with the Zelda stuff.
5800000	5803000	That's how they did it with LittleBigPlanet.
5803000	5805000	I mean, it's not a bad idea.
5805000	5810000	And it helps you find levels better instead of having to have this stupid code exchange crap.
5810000	5813000	Seriously, Nintendo, get away from the damn code exchanges.
5813000	5816000	I mean, that's, I don't know.
5816000	5820000	It's just like, yeah, we don't want to program our friend and you guys just do it.
5820000	5822000	OK, you do it.
5822000	5826000	It's such a lazy approach to it.
5826000	5827000	All right.
5827000	5829000	Well, let's let's move on, shall we?
5829000	5831000	And talk about Dark Soccer.
5831000	5833000	You have kind of an irritating.
5833000	5836000	Yeah, it's a it's a it's a little bit of a world politics type of thing.
5836000	5841000	But it also shows that gaming can be a propaganda device, right?
5841000	5847000	Well, oftentimes in some places gaming is a propaganda, especially in China.
5847000	5856000	And this game is translated to everyone hit the traitors where players can assault the pro democracy protesters in Hong Kong.
5856000	5860000	With weapons like bats and shoes just by tapping on them.
5860000	5865000	And again, this this is absolutely propaganda.
5865000	5867000	The game open and it's a free game, by the way.
5867000	5874000	But it opens up saying Hong Kong is a part of China and this can't be meddled with by outside powers.
5874000	5879000	And so basically it's just it's very anti-Western.
5879000	5889000	It's very anti-Western, it's very, you know, anti-capitalist, even though this capitalism is freaking everywhere.
5889000	5897000	But it specifically, though, is meant to hurt the efforts of the protesters in Hong Kong.
5897000	5899000	And I think it's absolutely disgusting.
5900000	5914000	It was submitted to Steam for approval, but they are apparently not to be are still waiting for release because of, quote, controversial and potentially illegal content.
5914000	5924000	And then also DC Comics related to this pulled a Batman poster after Chinese supporters said it supported anti-government protests.
5924000	5929000	So just this this whole thing that they're doing is absolutely disgusting.
5929000	5934000	And too many people are bowing to it when.
5934000	5935000	I don't know.
5935000	5941000	Well, this straight up propaganda game coming to steam as they're trying to come to steam is very fascinating.
5941000	5943000	And, you know, just goes to show being to me it.
5943000	5951000	Well, it goes to show and, you know, something to consider is that, you know, if video games are art, art typically has a message.
5951000	5953000	And sometimes that message can be a good thing.
5953000	5954000	That can be a great thing.
5954000	5956000	That message can tell a story.
5956000	5957000	That message can make you feel things.
5957000	5959000	That message can be something like gone home.
5959000	5962000	That message can be something like that dragon cancer.
5962000	5965000	That message can be, you know, really powerful.
5965000	5972000	But sometimes that message can be used for not so great things like straight up political propaganda, which is what this is.
5972000	5979000	So I think it's an interesting sign of our times and that video games is very much a part of that.
5979000	5986000	I mean, in the 1920s, this would have been a poster that used some type of pop culture thing with a very political message.
5986000	5989000	Or a little ad in Harper's.
5989000	5994000	Now in the year 20, almost 2020, now in the new 20s.
5994000	5997000	How are we going to distinguish, I guess, the 1920s versus 2020s?
5997000	5999000	Now in the new 20s, it's video games.
5999000	6002000	The more things change, the more they stay the same.
6003000	6012000	Azet in chat says these companies hitch their horse to China and now they're cow-towing to them because they hold the chips.
6012000	6019000	Yeah, I mean, that's a lot of where the frustrations with Blizzard came from a couple months ago, talking about that.
6019000	6026000	So tricky subject, but I think an important one because, you know, I think you need to be aware.
6026000	6030000	And, you know, this one is a very obvious piece of propaganda.
6030000	6033000	What about those things that are less obvious?
6033000	6036000	So, something to think about. Anyway.
6036000	6041000	Moving on, let's talk about the things that will obviously be concluding soon.
6041000	6052000	Which is good because this is my least favorite part of the Bethesda E3 press events was the discussion of Elder Scrolls Legends.
6052000	6062000	It was their card game that they had worked on and now they've announced that they have ceased working on any big updates or future expansions.
6062000	6068000	We've decided to put any new content development or releases on hold for the foreseeable future.
6070000	6072000	We've heard that song and dance before.
6074000	6080000	New expansions and other future content, however, are no longer under active development, they had said as well.
6081000	6087000	And, yeah, so it looks like that they've just kind of let it die a slow death, apparently.
6087000	6090000	Just gonna leave it in the land of the unsupported.
6090000	6093000	So, well, bummer for people that were into that game, I guess.
6093000	6103000	So, but maybe it could also be one of those things where now this is more resources that go towards Elder Scrolls VI or something else on Bethesda's end of things.
6103000	6105000	So, all right.
6105000	6106000	Yeah.
6106000	6107000	Well, let's move on.
6107000	6111000	Another game that is a card game of sorts.
6111000	6113000	Let's talk about Gwent.
6113000	6116000	So, Gwent is part of the Witcher franchise.
6116000	6122000	Gwent was a side game you could play in The Witcher 3, which I played not that long ago and actually played my first game of Gwent.
6122000	6127000	I didn't know what the hell I was doing, but I played it and I won somehow, probably because it was easy.
6127000	6131000	But Gwent ended up being a whole side game that ended up coming out.
6131000	6135000	So, Gwent came out on PC and it came out on iOS.
6135000	6139000	It also came out on various consoles like PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
6139000	6142000	However, they made a decision this week.
6142000	6147000	The folks behind CD Projekt RED, behind Gwent and The Witcher and all that said this week,
6147000	6152000	we have made a tough decision to discontinue support of console versions of the game.
6152000	6157000	So, you can no longer spend money for cards on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One.
6157000	6162000	And on December 9th, the console versions of the game will no longer support matchmaking.
6162000	6165000	Ouch, if you bought cards in the past, I suppose.
6165000	6171000	But it seems like folks are kind of playing this more on PC and iOS anyway.
6171000	6176000	So, this may be more of a sign of it's too thin across all these platforms.
6176000	6179000	So, we're going to sunset these consoles where it's not used as well.
6179000	6184000	So, also it should be pointed out, between December 9th and June 9th,
6184000	6190000	you can copy your progress from the console version of the game to a new GOG account.
6190000	6194000	So, you're not completely screwed and that's kind of the way that they're trying to ease this a little bit,
6194000	6196000	is that, hey, we're not just deleting your cards.
6196000	6199000	We're going to ease you over to the PC version of the game where there's more people.
6199000	6204000	So, you connect your console to GOG and then, because that's CD Projekt RED's thing,
6204000	6210000	and then everything with cards, deck list, account level, all that stuff will go over to the GOG system.
6210000	6211000	Well, that's good at least.
6211000	6214000	Except weird things, meteorite powder.
6214000	6216000	If you're PlayStation 4, you lose it.
6216000	6218000	It's so weird, but whatever.
6218000	6220000	I'm saying it's not possible.
6220000	6222000	It's very strange.
6222000	6224000	Anyway, yeah.
6224000	6228000	But what's also weird to me, why couldn't this have just been cross-platform in the first place?
6228000	6233000	I understand this came out in an era when it wasn't possible on Sony because they were kind of a holdout.
6233000	6235000	Maybe it's just the way they developed it. Who knows?
6235000	6240000	But why wouldn't that have been the solution to just tie them into the same matchmaking system?
6240000	6243000	It's kind of weird that they didn't do that as a response.
6243000	6245000	And we get this instead.
6245000	6247000	But whatever, I guess.
6247000	6249000	All right.
6249000	6252000	And QuestPuster says, yeah, Gwent, they killed the console version.
6252000	6254000	Yep, some hard times.
6254000	6259000	But that was cool of them to do, that they did copy things over so that way you're not totally screwed
6259000	6262000	if you are willing to switch to GOG.
6262000	6263000	All right.
6263000	6265000	Let's go back to a simpler time, shall we?
6265000	6270000	We're going to go back to a time actually not as long ago as some prior selections
6270000	6274000	because the rule here for the Classic Game of the Week, where once a week
6274000	6277000	Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,
6277000	6283000	hey, you kids should check out this game, or hey, this game has historical significance,
6283000	6288000	or I think maybe the case of tonight's pick, hey, can you believe this game qualifies now
6288000	6290000	because it's ten years old?
6290000	6294000	So Dark Sakura, what did you pick for the Classic Game of the Week?
6294000	6295000	All right.
6295000	6303000	And I dropped hints on the Twitters because of tweeting, but I picked Angry Birds.
6303000	6308000	Angry Birds is a ten-year-old game as of the 11th.
6308000	6310000	And...
6310000	6313000	Now you get to hear the noises in the background of the birds going...
6313000	6319000	It is also the first, I think, iOS game, first released as a mobile game
6319000	6321000	that I have done for Classic Games.
6321000	6328000	So we're getting into the territory of mobile gaming as a viable...
6328000	6331000	And to be fair, the video we're seeing is not from a mobile version.
6331000	6333000	I believe it's one of the console versions.
6333000	6334000	It is.
6334000	6335000	They ported this to everything.
6335000	6338000	I actually switched yours out, Dark Sakura, because I don't know if you knew,
6338000	6340000	but the one you picked was all in Russian text.
6340000	6343000	Yeah, well, I don't see why that mattered.
6343000	6344000	The game's the same.
6344000	6347000	I picked one in the localized, so whatever.
6347000	6349000	It's the same thing.
6349000	6354000	Well, at any rate, Angry Birds did come out in December 2009,
6354000	6357000	and it was first released on iOS and...
6357000	6359000	I'm going to mispronounce this.
6359000	6362000	Is it Mayemo? M-A-E-M-O.
6362000	6364000	Devices.
6364000	6373000	Since then, 12 million copies of the games have been acquired from the iOS app store.
6373000	6377000	So because of that popularity, later versions did get released.
6377000	6382000	For Android, Symbian, Windows Phone, and BlackBerry 10 devices.
6382000	6384000	And, of course, the Spa Home versions,
6384000	6389000	and a sequel that came out in 2015 for iOS and Android.
6389000	6394000	So the game is really simple, and it can be really addictive.
6394000	6398000	I mean, for the record, it was developed by Rovio Entertainment.
6398000	6401000	But anyway, you slingshot birds,
6401000	6404000	and some different birds have different abilities, as we can see.
6404000	6408000	And your goal is to destroy some pigs.
6408000	6412000	Very, very militant-looking hogs.
6412000	6417000	And they will be on stands or in special rooms or different things.
6417000	6421000	And your goal is to efficiently use your birds as ammunition
6421000	6425000	to destroy these pigs and the platforms that they're on,
6425000	6428000	and you can make the platforms topple all the pigs and whatnot.
6428000	6431000	Can I just say, in many ways, this game's engine kind of,
6431000	6433000	or I'm sorry, not the engine, but the design,
6433000	6436000	reminds me of the old Tank Wars type of games,
6436000	6438000	which then, you know, things like worms,
6438000	6440000	because essentially, what are you doing with the birds?
6440000	6442000	You're picking your angle, and you're picking your power.
6442000	6444000	That was the main mechanic behind the tank games.
6444000	6446000	Have we done Scorched Earth as a classic game of the week?
6446000	6449000	You'll have to take it up with the Office of Classic Gaming.
6449000	6451000	But anyway, let's let her finish this week.
6451000	6452000	We'll talk.
6452000	6454000	I'll let you do a classic game.
6454000	6456000	Next time she's gone, we'll do that one.
6456000	6458000	I can do one while I'm here. It's cool.
6458000	6461000	But remember, pinball next month, or next year.
6461000	6462000	Well, both.
6462000	6463000	Not every week, but yeah.
6463000	6464000	Yeah.
6464000	6467000	But at any rate, since it became so popular,
6467000	6473000	I mean, the entire franchise has had over 2 billion downloads
6473000	6476000	across all platforms as of January 2014.
6476000	6478000	That's including special editions.
6478000	6482000	And it was actually officially labeled after it's released
6482000	6485000	one of the most mainstream games out in 2010
6485000	6487000	and a runaway hit for 2010.
6487000	6492000	And the largest mobile app success the world has ever seen as of 2011.
6492000	6494000	Those are all quotes.
6494000	6498000	But at any rate, it really is just slingshot, kill pigs,
6498000	6502000	eat bacon and chicken, maybe?
6502000	6503000	Ooh.
6503000	6505000	What if they had called this game bacon rat chicken?
6505000	6507000	That would have been pretty badass.
6507000	6509000	Maybe I would have played it more.
6509000	6511000	But you've got different kinds of birds
6511000	6515000	as distinguished by their shape and their color.
6515000	6519000	You get the basic red bird, just called red.
6519000	6522000	And then you have birds that are effective against different materials
6522000	6524000	or have different abilities.
6524000	6528000	So a yellow bird named Chuck will speed up as it goes.
6528000	6532000	A blue bird will fragment into three birds, and they're just called the blues.
6532000	6534000	A black bird called Bomb explodes.
6534000	6539000	The white bird called Matilda can drop egg projectiles.
6539000	6543000	There's a pink one called Stella that can trap objects and bubbles.
6543000	6546000	A green bird named Hal that boomerangs back.
6546000	6551000	And a giant red bird named Terence, who looks like the original red bird but is bigger,
6551000	6554000	who does more damage to structures than the smaller ones.
6554000	6558000	And an orange bird called Bubbles that expands and inflates.
6558000	6560000	And then you've got the different pigs.
6560000	6562000	You have small pigs who are weaker.
6562000	6566000	You have large pigs that are able to withstand more damage.
6566000	6569000	And then you have pigs that wear armor, like the military hats I was talking about,
6569000	6572000	that are more impervious.
6572000	6575000	And of course you've got, you know, all the levels are predetermined.
6575000	6577000	They're all set up a certain way.
6577000	6585000	And basically your goal is to eliminate all of the pigs before the last bird is launched.
6585000	6590000	And then after that you complete the level, and the next level is unlocked.
6590000	6593000	But if you run out of birds first and the pigs aren't defeated,
6593000	6598000	the level is considered incomplete and must be repeated.
6598000	6602000	And then you get your points based on the damage or destruction,
6602000	6606000	and bonus points for having unused birds.
6606000	6610000	Your survivors give you points. Don't murder all the birds.
6610000	6616000	And then you can go back and repeat levels that weren't done up to three stars,
6616000	6621000	but you can get star ranking on each level to do better and improve your score.
6622000	6632000	And so the game, like I said, it was originally released on iOS
6632000	6635000	and had just a single episode called Poached Eggs.
6635000	6640000	And you had three themed chapters with 21 levels each.
6640000	6643000	And then you got three upgrades as it went along.
6643000	6647000	And I just remember how the logo has changed over the years.
6647000	6653000	That first logo was really dark and sketchy and it got a little bit different.
6653000	6659000	But the first update came out on February 11th, 2010 as an episode called Mighty Hoax.
6659000	6661000	It had two more chapters added.
6661000	6665000	And after that we even got Golden Eggs and Danger Above and blah blah blah blah blah.
6665000	6668000	But we're talking about the original.
6668000	6671000	But then after that you did get different themes.
6671000	6677000	The first themed one was Hamem High, as in Hangem High.
6677000	6683000	But it was an Old West themed and then you got new birds after that like the Mighty Eagle.
6683000	6694000	But the game really did launch a bajillion, just a franchise that has spawned so many other things.
6694000	6699000	Because you can find Angry Birds shirts and I still see them on sale.
6700000	6702000	Yeah, the movies. Two of them.
6705000	6710000	The other releases that came out were the Nokia N900 multimedia internet phone.
6710000	6713000	iPhone, like I said, iPod Touch.
6713000	6721000	Rovio then did an exclusive iPad version called Angry Birds HD that came out in 2010.
6721000	6727000	Then after that came out for the Palm Pre, it came out for Palm's WebOS.
6728000	6735000	Symbian 3 phones got a copy that included Poached Eggs and Mighty Hoax.
6735000	6740000	And then it later on started working on Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD.
6740000	6743000	And then of course it came on for multiples.
6743000	6749000	Even our console versions, we got Angry Birds for PSP, for PlayStation Portable.
6749000	6752000	It was sort of like a mini game type.
6752000	6756000	It brought out Windows versions and then we got them for Mac on the App Store.
6756000	6763000	And then for Nintendo DS, there was...
6763000	6768000	I'm sorry, for Wii I'm talking about came Angry Birds Trilogy and then there was the Nintendo DS version.
6768000	6775000	And an enhanced version was proposed for the LG Optimus 3D, but I don't know if that actually got released.
6775000	6779000	There are browser versions of this that run in WebGL or Canvas.
6779000	6782000	You can get them through the Chrome Web Store.
6783000	6785000	You have all other kinds of...
6785000	6787000	I mean, there's just so many that came out.
6787000	6791000	But like I said, you get it on many other things too.
6791000	6795000	You've got, like we're saying, movies.
6795000	6800000	We have clothing. We have school supplies.
6800000	6802000	Lego sets.
6802000	6804000	Lego sets, which would be a mess.
6804000	6807000	It's a brand. It's a character. It's everywhere.
6807000	6816000	That's right. And now, even when you're talking about physics-based games like this, people will say, what, like Angry Birds?
6816000	6822000	But I really consider this one to be notable for what it is.
6822000	6824000	Well, I think what's also interesting...
6824000	6828000	No, I know I was giving you a little shit when you picked this game on Twitter.
6828000	6831000	Because I do think, and I think this is worth talking about as well,
6831000	6836000	there was something about this game and the popularity of this game because it was so...
6836000	6841000	Like, it kind of defined cell phone gaming for a little while.
6841000	6844000	In an era probably pre-Pokemon Go.
6844000	6847000	You know, this game kind of defined what a cell phone game was.
6847000	6851000	And I think for a lot of people, it was like, oh, it's a casual game.
6851000	6856000	Yeah, it was like one of the first games that my kids would play on tablets.
6856000	6860000	Like, they would, you know, you'd see a tablet and it's like, oh, you got to put Angry Birds on there.
6860000	6864000	Because that's what all the kids are playing is Angry Birds or Fruit Ninja.
6864000	6868000	Well, and I love physics-based games, so this one really just appealed to me.
6868000	6874000	I thought, and people will call this stuff like casual games, but there is strategy involved in it.
6874000	6877000	You have to have an understanding of physics. You have to understand the game physics.
6877000	6880000	I never saw this as really being super casual.
6880000	6884000	Maybe casual in the fact that you could play a few levels and put it away.
6884000	6888000	But I could fucking do that on my Sega Saturn with Bust-A-Move. I could save my game.
6888000	6892000	I think for this, you know, and certainly anything negative I've ever said about Angry Birds
6892000	6897000	is not from a place of accessibility or getting games in the hands of more people.
6897000	6899000	I'm all for more people playing games.
6899000	6902000	But I think always my kind of mindset was, you know,
6902000	6905000	but if you're going to make a cell phone game popular, why this one?
6905000	6909000	But, you know, look, I understand.
6909000	6913000	I'm thankful that, you know, this has gotten more people into gaming.
6913000	6919000	And, you know, has helped this format, the phones, as much as, you know,
6919000	6923000	sometimes we make fun of phone games because they don't have tangible controllers.
6923000	6924000	This is a little different.
6924000	6930000	I'm thankful that this has brought more people into video gaming and, you know, and all that good stuff.
6930000	6937000	Well, yeah, this is the thing, too, is that I knew people who didn't consider themselves gamers until Angry Birds.
6937000	6941000	And these are not people who own consoles, you know.
6941000	6946000	I knew people who were just like, oh, I don't like any video games for X, Y, and Z reason,
6946000	6952000	but they'll be that one game that comes out that's suddenly like, holy crap, I like video games.
6952000	6955000	And it could be something as simple as this.
6955000	6958000	We shouldn't discount people who enjoy their, quote, casual games
6958000	6965000	because it could be the healthy, safe introduction to gaming that people need.
6965000	6968000	And, honestly, I think this game is pretty fucking funny.
6968000	6969000	All right.
6969000	6971000	Classic game of the week, Angry Birds.
6971000	6973000	Yes, it's ten years old.
6973000	6980000	And it, again, is notable as being the first mobile game only.
6980000	6983000	It started as a mobile game that I have brought out.
6983000	6985000	Is it really?
6985000	6987000	I really think that it is.
6987000	6993000	And it specifically was iOS and Nokia.
6993000	6994000	Interesting.
6994000	6998000	Akuma JP says, while the geeks in Japan are playing an addicted to puzzle dragon here,
6998000	7002000	I think that series, puzzle, and dragons, they've tried to do here,
7002000	7005000	but it hasn't really quite had that same level of success
7005000	7008000	because there was the Mario and Luigi one that they put out.
7008000	7010000	Speaking of puzzle games, you know what game?
7010000	7013000	I would love to have a release on, like, iPhones or something.
7013000	7017000	And one of my favorite SNES games is Puzzle and Dust.
7017000	7022000	I think that would be a really good thing to bring out for iOS.
7022000	7026000	I mean, I don't know if you played it that much, but I was super addicted to it
7026000	7029000	back when my only access to it was as a ROM.
7029000	7031000	I'm ready for Pokemon Puzzle League to make a comeback.
7031000	7034000	Have I done Puzzle and Dust as a classic?
7034000	7035000	I might have.
7035000	7036000	Maybe.
7036000	7037000	I'm pretty sure I did.
7037000	7038000	I'm ready for Pokemon Puzzle League to make a comeback.
7038000	7039000	Or whatever you want to call it.
7039000	7041000	Is it Tetris Attack or Panel de Pone?
7041000	7042000	Whatever.
7042000	7044000	I'm ready for that series to come back.
7044000	7045000	Playing a Puzzle League.
7045000	7048000	Yeah, I was playing a Puzzle League on the DS or 3DS.
7048000	7049000	DS.
7049000	7054000	Yes, because I remember when Shane, he downloaded that member
7054000	7056000	because they have that share thing.
7056000	7061000	The share demo thing that you could cash it to your DS or whatever.
7061000	7064000	And so he played that the entire E3 that we were there
7064000	7067000	because he wouldn't reset or turn off his.
7067000	7068000	Was it that?
7068000	7071000	Or I remember that, but it was Meteos.
7071000	7073000	Oh, Meteos something.
7073000	7076000	The year that that, because that was me and some people I knew at the time.
7076000	7078000	Because you could download demos to your DS, right?
7078000	7079000	Yes.
7079000	7080000	And so they had E3.
7080000	7082000	So we downloaded the Meteos demo and we played it all night.
7082000	7085000	We tried to keep it on our DS like as long as we possibly could
7085000	7089000	before inevitably like it shut off because of a dead battery or something.
7089000	7094000	Rob, so Puzzle and Desk, I did for episode 293.
7094000	7095000	Oh, wow.
7095000	7096000	So that was a while.
7096000	7097000	It's been a little while.
7097000	7098000	Good game.
7098000	7099000	Good game.
7099000	7100000	Over 500 episodes ago.
7100000	7101000	Kind of hard.
7101000	7103000	But I mean, I'm going to.
7103000	7105000	Is Nichibutsu still around?
7105000	7108000	Because maybe I should poke whoever owns the license for it.
7108000	7109000	All right.
7109000	7113000	Let's travel around the game world real quick and take a look at some rapid fire news.
7113000	7117000	So a quick look at some other things that are happening in the gaming world.
7117000	7118000	Loki, we'll start with you.
7118000	7120000	So they just released a trailer.
7120000	7125000	20th Century Fox released a trailer for a movie called Free Guy, which looks fantastic.
7125000	7129000	It's basically Grand Theft Auto Online, the movie.
7129000	7137000	But it's the premise is that Ryan Reynolds character is a like an NPC in this game.
7137000	7142000	He doesn't realize he's an NPC and then all of a sudden finds out he's inside of a game.
7142000	7145000	And he decides that he doesn't want to be an NPC anymore.
7145000	7149000	This sounds so ridiculous and exactly like the type of thing we would expect Ryan Reynolds to do.
7149000	7150000	It's fantastic.
7150000	7151000	It looks hilarious.
7151000	7152000	Yeah.
7152000	7153000	And I can't wait to see it.
7153000	7154000	So that's coming out in July.
7154000	7158000	So check out the trailer if you haven't seen that yet, because it looks very sweet.
7158000	7160000	A lot of good trailers, actually.
7160000	7162000	Monday, we're going to be getting a brand new.
7162000	7165000	The new Ghostbusters movies going to be having a trailer for that.
7165000	7166000	Yeah.
7166000	7167000	We got Wonder Woman 84.
7167000	7168000	Wonder Woman 84 was today.
7168000	7169000	Yeah.
7169000	7170000	Yeah.
7170000	7171000	So lots of good stuff.
7171000	7175000	You also get Golden Globe nominees tomorrow if you're into that award watching sort of thing.
7175000	7176000	Yes.
7176000	7179000	So I've got some news about Space Channel 5.
7179000	7183000	And no, it's not that I saw a cosplayer today dressed up like Ooh La La.
7183000	7187000	It is unfortunate that Space Channel 5 VR has been delayed again.
7187000	7190000	Now it will be coming out in spring 2020.
7190000	7195000	So if you had your hopes to play Space Channel 5 VR before the end of the year, sorry.
7195000	7196000	Not going to happen.
7196000	7200000	Well, again, game delays should be celebrated in some ways.
7200000	7202000	So as long as it's going to make it better.
7202000	7203000	Yeah.
7203000	7205000	Put more chew in there.
7205000	7206000	All right.
7206000	7210000	Moving on to something that was spotted in Microsoft Store.
7210000	7211000	This could be very interesting.
7211000	7216000	Some remasters in 4K of Vanquish and Bayonetta.
7216000	7219000	Vanquish was spotted first in the Microsoft Store.
7219000	7223000	It's going to have 4K visuals running in 60 frames a second on Xbox One X.
7223000	7226000	The launch date is supposed to be February 18th.
7226000	7232000	And then Bayonetta was spotted not much longer after that also on the Microsoft Store.
7232000	7237000	Potentially Game Award announcements that got leaked a little early.
7237000	7240000	I don't know if that would be that big.
7240000	7242000	Something to keep in mind.
7242000	7246000	We haven't had an update on Bayonetta 3 in quite some time.
7246000	7248000	We know that's something they're doing for the Switch.
7248000	7250000	We just kind of don't know the status.
7250000	7258000	It would seem logical that we bring Bayonetta back into consciousness with some type of remaster or rebranding of the first two games.
7258000	7261000	We did have the original Bayonetta on PC.
7261000	7263000	And I know that updressed the original.
7263000	7264000	Same with Vanquish.
7264000	7265000	Yeah.
7265000	7267000	So I don't know if maybe these are just the PC versions or whatever.
7267000	7270000	But I also don't think they went all the way up to 4K.
7270000	7276000	And maybe they actually went in and really did some different stuff with the assets and stuff.
7276000	7278000	And maybe are really making it look nice.
7279000	7282000	Until we see the actual details and not just a leak through the store.
7282000	7284000	But that does appear to be something that's coming.
7284000	7286000	So that is pretty cool.
7286000	7292000	And then I was going to look at this other story on more arcade archive releases coming.
7292000	7294000	But the damn website won't load for me over here.
7294000	7296000	So I don't know if you can help me out, Loki.
7296000	7301000	But I know that the Arcade Archives, which is basically a legit meme on your Nintendo Switch.
7301000	7305000	They have a whole series of games that are going to be coming out.
7305000	7308000	Some of them were announced before, but some were not.
7308000	7312000	Yeah. So they had a stream, I guess, that was on NicoNico.
7312000	7316000	That Hamster announced some more games that are coming to Arcade Archive.
7316000	7321000	These include Kiki, KaiKai, Tenstar.
7321000	7322000	Kiki and Rocky.
7322000	7324000	And MapMania.
7324000	7328000	Yeah, Kiki and KaiKai is not a Drag Race game, just to be clear.
7328000	7329000	No.
7329000	7331000	You know what's funny?
7331000	7334000	I remember when I bought this nest at the thrift store for 50 bucks.
7334000	7336000	Pocky and Rocky 2 was in it.
7336000	7337000	Oh, how funny.
7337000	7338000	A game that goes for 150 bucks.
7338000	7343000	So now the full lineup now that they have those plus the other titles that they had before it.
7343000	7352000	So Suzuki versus Commander, Gorilla War, Akari 3, The Rescue, P.O.W. Prisoners of War, Frogger,
7352000	7360000	Daytona, Twinbee versus Balloon Fight, Kiki KaiKai, Tenstar, MapMania, and Tecmo Bowl.
7360000	7363000	Sorry, I just giggled at the name Kiki KaiKai.
7363000	7366000	Anyway, that's cool.
7366000	7369000	Yeah, the Arcade Archive is very interesting.
7369000	7372000	I kind of think it's like they want seven bucks a game for those games.
7372000	7374000	I'm not sure they're all worth that.
7374000	7379000	But as they're starting to get more and more like modern releases mixed in there too, I think it's pretty cool.
7379000	7384000	We should see some, let's start making some actual cabinets for them.
7384000	7386000	I mean, that's the trend nowadays.
7386000	7392000	Actually, my kids played on the Pac-Man Cocktail Cab, the arcade one up one.
7392000	7395000	They had $450 for that thing.
7395000	7399000	I'm like, I'm all due, but the full size ones are like $150.
7399000	7401000	Why would I pay that?
7401000	7405000	That seems kind of a rip off at Sam's Club too, which is ridiculous.
7405000	7406000	Interesting.
7406000	7413000	But I would have thought that would have been much cheaper because it's basically the same thing running in there.
7413000	7415000	There's no additional hardware.
7415000	7421000	Anyway, I guess another set of controls, but really it's not that much more expensive.
7421000	7425000	Boy, it's so funny how this whole replica arcade thing is getting bigger and bigger.
7425000	7427000	I mean, certainly with the arcade one ups, right?
7427000	7430000	Tons of people got those Star Wars ones and so forth.
7430000	7432000	It seems like they're just making more and more.
7432000	7436000	If I had the space, I would have a whole arcade of those things.
7436000	7439000	Well, and the money, because let's be real, those things are kind of expensive.
7439000	7441000	They've dropped them after Black Friday.
7441000	7450000	Some of them are down to, I think, I want to say that the Mortal Kombat one's down to $179 or $199.
7450000	7452000	It's permanently dropped price now.
7452000	7453000	Oh, wow.
7453000	7454000	That's cool.
7454000	7455000	Yeah, they've come down.
7455000	7456000	That's great.
7456000	7457000	All right.
7457000	7458000	Fun, fun.
7458000	7459000	All right.
7459000	7462000	Well, let's move on and talk about, thank you for pinch hitting on that story.
7462000	7464000	Dark Soccer, you have a couple of rapid fire stories for us, right?
7464000	7466000	I do indeed.
7466000	7478000	One that makes me super happy is that the creator of Danganronpa, Kodaka Kazutaka, said that there's a new title.
7478000	7482000	Well, announcing a new title on the, I can't make my words happen.
7482000	7483000	Why am I so tongue tied?
7483000	7488000	Announced a title on December 9th, a teasing for it.
7488000	7490000	And this is the direct quote.
7490000	7492000	Maybe it's because it was a bad year.
7492000	7497000	I'm feeling down quite a lot this year, but I'll still be able to make this announcement at the end of it.
7497000	7498000	So it's going to be the greatest year.
7498000	7500000	He said this on Twitter.
7500000	7510000	So basically there's going to be a title that's going to be announced, although already announced for 2020 is Death March Club.
7510000	7514000	But he's also working on a number of other unannounced projects.
7514000	7518000	One that is a limit cross despair game.
7518000	7536000	I'm also working with Uchikoshi Kotaro and an anime collaboration with Studio Pero and a very dark fantasy-esque mystery quote game in collaboration with Spike Chunsoft.
7536000	7546000	And then there was another update on this that Izanagi Games actually retweeted Kodaka's tweet.
7546000	7564000	And Izanagi Games is the publisher for Death March Club, but they've also registered a trademark for Death Come True, a Japanese trademark on November 15th, and the domain name DeathComeTrue.com on November 18th.
7564000	7567000	So keep your eyes open on those.
7567000	7576000	I would like a Danganronpa that's more of an extension of the original Danganronpa and not this V3, because V3 I prefer.
7576000	7580000	I just like all my original Danganronpa characters.
7580000	7584000	But V3 wasn't bad, don't get me wrong, I just couldn't get into the universe of it.
7584000	7593000	And in other news, there's Untitled Goose Game merchandise coming out in the form of socks.
7593000	7596000	But I'm not looking at it as socks, I'm looking at it as a sock puppet.
7596000	7600000	Because it totally is a goose with a beak, and you can go...
7603000	7610000	You can do that. Basically, my hand goose just bit your head off. Sorry, Loki, you can have it back.
7610000	7615000	That's okay, he has his statue goose to protect him there.
7615000	7622000	I would have printed my own, but my printer doesn't work, and then I would need also several different colors of filament to do that.
7622000	7625000	That's the next game of with all the merchandise.
7625000	7627000	Or just really good paint.
7627000	7635000	True. And I like, see now, the way they printed this too, it's kind of funny, because you would look at it and you'd think, okay, vertically, but they actually printed it like this.
7635000	7640000	But because of that, the butt feather, or it makes it look like the butt feathers would be actually how it would be.
7640000	7645000	It's kind of just, it's not on purpose, but it's pretty cool.
7645000	7647000	Interesting. Alright.
7647000	7651000	Well, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some video games coming out very soon.
7651000	7655000	Although I imagine this time of year is slowing down a little bit, but we'll check in anyway.
7655000	7657000	Yeah, but there's still some things coming out.
7657000	7662000	So, like, really this week, it's kind of limited to just a few games.
7662000	7666000	So we've got Dragon Quest Builders 2, that's on PC.
7666000	7669000	MechWarrior 5 Mercenaries, also PC.
7669000	7676000	Vampire the Masquerade, looks like they've got an expansion there that's coming out on PC, Mac, and Linux.
7676000	7687000	And we also have this week, Detroit Become Human on PC, and Project Sakura Wars on PS4.
7687000	7690000	Yeah, I know, Dr. Sakura's been waiting for that Detroit.
7690000	7692000	You have it pre-purchased, right?
7692000	7695000	No, I don't yet, just because I didn't want to spend the money yet.
7695000	7696000	Fair.
7696000	7700000	Well, maybe cross your fingers and toes, maybe there'll be a week one discount, who knows?
7700000	7701000	Maybe.
7701000	7704000	Alright, we'll go into Japan and their release dates over there.
7704000	7708000	On the PlayStation 4, we saw some releases this week, things aren't slowing down over there.
7708000	7711000	Project Sakura Wars is also in Japan this week.
7711000	7714000	That is in a regular and limited edition, if you want those.
7714000	7718000	There's also a game called BQM, which is short for Block Quest Maker,
7718000	7722000	so if you want kind of your own quest-making game, that is available, as well as Hollow Knight.
7722000	7727000	Their version of Control, so they get that, you know, one of our Game of the Year contenders,
7727000	7731000	they're getting a localized version in Japan next week of Control on the PlayStation 4.
7731000	7734000	Also, they're getting Ghostbusters, the video game remastered,
7734000	7737000	so they took, it's been out here, the PlayStation 4 version of that,
7737000	7742000	but they took the older one from like 10 years ago and re-upped it for PlayStation 4,
7742000	7745000	and that's getting its Japanese release this week.
7745000	7750000	Mega Aquarium also coming out, and Headliner Novi News, that is all on PlayStation 4.
7750000	7755000	Looking at the Switch, Samurai Spirits, which you might know as Samurai Showdown,
7755000	7759000	getting its Switch release in Japan this week, so that is a big release there.
7759000	7766000	You can also check out Deadly Premonition, I'm sorry, that is not a Japanese release.
7766000	7775000	BQM Block Quest Maker is also out on the Switch, as well as Hollow Knight and Deadly Premonition Origins.
7775000	7779000	No, that's only US, I don't know why that's mixed in here, but it is.
7779000	7785000	So, I was trying to see if there's other Japanese, oh yeah, Mega Aquarium and Headliner Novi News also there in Japan this week.
7785000	7788000	On the Switch, how about the UK Dark Soccer?
7788000	7794000	Only a few things. On the 9th, we have Doom Slayer's Collection for PlayStation.
7794000	7798000	Also only on PlayStation is Groundhog Day, like Father, like Son.
7798000	7804000	On Switch, we have Shovel Knight Treasure Trove, and I'm going to mispronounce this,
7804000	7808000	but it's a PlayStation game, Avicii and Vector.
7808000	7814000	That is, I think, the music game with the artist who passed away.
7814000	7818000	Okay, and then on the 12th, New Super Lucky's Tale.
7818000	7825000	That's kind of cute. Yeah, everything else is the week after.
7825000	7831000	Just a bunch of collections, it looks like. But anyway, that's it for this week.
7831000	7834000	No mail tonight, well.
7834000	7837000	I just went ahead and just said, I just refreshed it.
7837000	7843000	Spoiler alert. All right. Well, every week we welcome your emails, and sometimes we have them and sometimes we don't.
7843000	7848000	Participate at Orangelaungeradoo.com is the place to send those emails.
7848000	7853000	I will kind of point out that something we're going to be retooling a little bit for 2020.
7853000	7857000	I'm not going to get rid of the mailbag. I've been threatening to do it because it's so underutilized.
7857000	7863000	We'll keep it. However, I am going to have us incorporate, and I'll talk a little bit about this later,
7863000	7868000	because it's going to be a surprise to my co-hosts, but I will be incorporating Twitter once again into the rotation
7868000	7873000	for those that want to send us tweets, because I think that is a quick way for a lot of you to give comments on the show,
7873000	7879000	as well as ensuring that we're embracing vognetwork.com as a place to leave your comments on episodes.
7879000	7885000	So we will be incorporating that kind of into a Katamari, if you will, of listener feedback.
7885000	7888000	I prefer the word gestalt. Gestalt? You don't like Katamari?
7888000	7892000	I like Katamari, but I've been watching a lot of Transformer stuff lately.
7893000	7899000	However, until we remodel this segment in the coming weeks, you may remember that if you don't send emails,
7899000	7903000	you do get penalized with talk about RuPaul's Drag Race.
7903000	7904000	Yes!
7904000	7908000	You get penalized, or I get penalized.
7908000	7911000	Basically, we should just zoom the camera in on Loki while we talk.
7911000	7915000	So anyway, I kind of do want a multi-camera setup, but anyway.
7915000	7919000	Or you can just get a camera that you can actually adjust and then have presets set.
7919000	7922000	I could do one of those, kind of like what Paladin Amber does on her stream,
7922000	7925000	is that she just basically has multi-cameras.
7925000	7928000	Well, she has multi-cameras, but there's also ways you can kind of zoom in on the same shot.
7928000	7932000	Like, I could just make another scene with this, but it's just zoomed in on your face.
7932000	7937000	We could totally do multi-cam in using Final Cut.
7937000	7940000	Well, but you don't broadcast live with Final Cut. This would support it.
7940000	7943000	But it would be for other things.
7943000	7944000	Oh yeah, for other things.
7944000	7948000	But anyway, so sadly Drag Race is off-season, so there's not a lot to say there either.
7948000	7949000	However...
7949000	7950000	I couldn't watch Drag Race UK.
7950000	7953000	I was just wondering if you were... did you see Drag Race UK and the results?
7953000	7956000	I did while I was at the bar at Depot.
7956000	7959000	I watched a little bit of it. There's a lot of Queens on there.
7959000	7961000	I just need to sit and binge the whole thing.
7961000	7964000	I just thought that their prizes were completely underwhelming for what they were doing.
7964000	7965000	Well, you know why that is, though.
7965000	7969000	Because of the BBC. You can't have... because it's basically taxpayer-funded,
7969000	7972000	you can't give away prizes on the BBC, basically.
7972000	7973000	That's stupid.
7973000	7976000	Yeah, it's a little different. The game show rules are different over there.
7976000	7979000	So they're just basically playing for props.
7979000	7981000	To become a Ru girl.
7981000	7985000	They're playing for being on television, is what it is.
7985000	7995000	Well, if it gives them... I just hope that doing this actually gives their careers a lot more than what they had before.
7995000	8001000	I'm also bracing for 2020 and the inevitable Ru burnout, because they're already casting for Season 13.
8001000	8003000	Season 12, we don't even know the premiere date for.
8003000	8005000	We know there's an All-Stars Five in the can. We're just waiting for it.
8005000	8007000	I need to know a couple of friends. Try it out.
8007000	8013000	But then Drag Race Canada is coming up. Drag Race Australia is coming up.
8013000	8017000	And then there's the German one with Heidi Klum is hosting it.
8017000	8021000	You know, she got a lot of shit for... you're not a drag queen, you're a bio.
8021000	8026000	But Heidi Klum is super... and there's a great... if you listen to Alaska and Willem's podcast,
8026000	8030000	they kind of go off and defend Heidi Klum, as she should be defended.
8031000	8036000	The show wouldn't happen if it wasn't for Heidi Klum, and she's a huge proponent of that performance.
8036000	8040000	Willem surprises me, though, with all those anti-trans things that Willem said.
8040000	8048000	Where, uh, Kourtney Act, I have to say it the right way, came in and basically did a lot of damage control.
8048000	8059000	And then to have someone who just seems like that polarized into the, I guess, a little bit more patriarchal side of drag and sexuality.
8059000	8063000	To come out and support, basically, a bio queen.
8063000	8068000	I mean, and I will use the term bio queen or fem queen, but I do not use the term faux queen.
8068000	8071000	Because a queen is a queen. It's drag.
8072000	8077000	But, you know, one thing I have to say that actually made me super happy, even though this is a little bit of old news,
8077000	8083000	is that Dragula, this last season, made me super happy. Because we had a drag king who won.
8083000	8087000	I think that's cool, but I don't like Dragula as a show. But I think that I'm happy for what it did.
8087000	8089000	I've met the Boulet brothers a couple of times, but it was all at DragCon.
8089000	8090000	That's cool.
8090000	8092000	Actually, really nice people.
8092000	8093000	They're bringing them here to Sacramento.
8093000	8096000	Oh, cool. I'd love to see the Boulet brothers. I went to the ball. That was fun.
8096000	8105000	And they had a lady queen. Crap. It's also one that I really like, but my brain just completely farted on her name.
8105000	8110000	But Land Insider, I've seen perform. I was high as a kite. It was DragCon.
8110000	8113000	Okay, it was my first time ever having edibles.
8113000	8121000	And it was also post gastric bypass, like six months after. So I eat this whole cookie that looks like a Samoa.
8121000	8124000	That's why I bought them, because it looked like fucking delicious.
8124000	8128000	And it was a delicious cookie. And it kicked in an hour later when we were at Hamburger Mary's in Los Angeles.
8128000	8132000	And I was fucked. I couldn't move.
8132000	8138000	You know, Landon's going to be here, or at least according to Landon's website, Landon's going to be here at one of the local bars in mid-December at some point.
8138000	8139000	Really?
8139000	8141000	Well, my king friends are thrilled.
8141000	8142000	Or sidetracked.
8142000	8144000	I think it might actually be Badlands.
8144000	8150000	Badlands, really? Okay. Well, no, I would totally be down to see Landon, because I've seen him perform a couple of times.
8150000	8154000	And just an absolutely astounding drag performer.
8154000	8163000	Alright, that's the end of the punishment. So, participate at orangelandrader.com is the place where you can send us emails for a future week.
8164000	8172000	And, in all seriousness, we have to get that out of our system while we can, because there won't really be punishment anymore once we incorporate tweets and VoG network feedback into that.
8172000	8175000	So, moving on.
8175000	8185000	Alright, let's get into some more gaming news, and then we're going to take your calls, if there's any, via our Discord server, which you can join our Discord server at vognetwork.com.
8185000	8189000	That's vognetwork.com slash Discord is the place to join our server.
8189000	8192000	Let's move on with some more news. Loki.
8192000	8204000	There is a rumor that Microsoft is going to release their next Xbox console with also a version of the console that will be diskless as well.
8204000	8212000	Codename Lockhart would be kind of their diskless version of the next system they have.
8212000	8221000	I mean, yeah, I guess that makes sense. I mean, since they're already doing that with the Xbox One.
8221000	8227000	This strikes me as a way, I mean, again, it's rumor, but it's one of those rumors that adds up.
8227000	8234000	And, for me, I think it would be about them trying to get the lowest dollar amount possible when they announce this thing.
8234000	8243000	Because they could come out, let's assume that the new Project Scarlett, whatever they end up calling it, let's assume it's a $599 console or something.
8243000	8246000	You know, it's pretty pricey because of the technical oomph that they put in there.
8246000	8256000	It may not be, I am completely theorizing, okay, just to make my point, but let's make believe that Project Scarlett is going to be a $599 console with all the bells and whistles.
8256000	8263000	Well, if there's going to be a scaled-down version potentially with no disk drive parts or any of that stuff, maybe that will be the $499.
8263000	8269000	And then that way they can say Project Scarlett or Xbox Two, whatever it's called, starting at $499.
8269000	8274000	And that's how they're going to keep the message low to potentially try to low-cut whatever places.
8274000	8281000	But I'm kind of curious, though, if those price points are even a problem anymore, considering that we have people buying $1200 phones.
8281000	8289000	Yes, they are. Look at what happened with PlayStation 3 and what happened with Xbox One.
8289000	8290000	A while ago, though.
8290000	8304000	Yeah, but it's also about responding to your competition. And so they have to have a way to potentially lowball, not just lowball PlayStation 5, but in case they have accidentally highballed PlayStation 5, they have to have a place where they can kind of compete with PlayStation 5.
8304000	8312000	Because remember the last time we went through this whole thing was the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One reveals. Remember that PlayStation 4 reveal at E3?
8312000	8322000	I mean, as we start in these next couple weeks to look back on the top gaming moments of the decade, that PlayStation 4 conference at E3 was one of the biggest gaming news moments of the decade.
8322000	8331000	Because it wasn't just about what they were announcing, but fucking how they did it. Like, they came out and just, like, slapped Microsoft across the face with that message.
8331000	8339000	I mean, remember that video with the whole, like, here's how you can let your friend play a PlayStation 4 game, you know, and just end the game.
8339000	8345000	Like, that was some big dick energy in a way. That was BDE before its time.
8345000	8347000	It was pretty great.
8347000	8355000	We hadn't seen that kind of thing. So I think Microsoft maybe just, you know, again, I talk a lot about positioning the chess pieces, but that's really what it is.
8355000	8364000	So I think when they're looking at a discless console, they could be positioning the chess pieces to possibly have to respond to, shit, we've priced our console more expensive than Sony's.
8364000	8368000	We can't have that happen again. So we're gonna have a high ball and a low ball. That's my thought.
8368000	8370000	Maybe, yeah. For what it is.
8370000	8379000	Given that we just came off of the Ghostbusters chat, this is what went through my head the moment that was said. It's true. This console has no disc.
8380000	8388000	So, you know, and as digital is becoming more and more the way, I don't think these consoles are bad. You know, if that's the way people want to save money, then cool.
8388000	8400000	I'll probably buy one that has a disc drive, but we'll see. I also understand the reality is, even though I can cling to my disc and everything, fucking the patches, your whole game redownloads anyway.
8400000	8410000	Like I can go get my No Man's Sky PlayStation 4 disc. Do you think that's, do you think that's a, I mean, technically it is a game. It will run if I'm not connected to the internet, I can play that.
8410000	8413000	No, I don't. Can I play it? Not on the internet?
8413000	8414000	No.
8414000	8421000	I think you can, but your information, no, you, cause I remember in the early days you were booted offline. So yes, you can play it, not on the internet. Your stuff just doesn't sink over.
8421000	8427000	But my point is like, the game is completely different now, right? They've released how many patches for No Man's Sky.
8427000	8433000	What's on that disc is not even the game at this point. So kind of interesting. I don't know.
8433000	8434000	Alright.
8434000	8435000	Shenanigans.
8435000	8445000	Now, DJ Rama S Wonders with a discless system makes you wonder if you can connect an external Blu-ray drive and run the games. Maybe. I mean, we won't know. Tell anyone else.
8445000	8447000	Kind of like having the SuperDrive with your Mac.
8447000	8453000	Yeah, but it would have to be an Xbox branded drive. They're not going to just let you buy any old third party drive and run it that way to try to save money.
8453000	8457000	They're not going to openly let you save money like that, but it would be interesting.
8457000	8466000	Alright, let's move on. Let's talk about something that may or may not be like a type of announcement for the game awards that got leaked early. We don't know.
8466000	8471000	But what we do know is that some box art for Resident Evil 3 leaked out.
8471000	8478000	So just like the Resident Evil 2 remake this past year, which was pretty darn well received. And I know Dark Soccer, you played through a bit.
8478000	8483000	I mean, you and Dan played through a bit of it and you well received it for the most part, right?
8483000	8484000	Yeah.
8484000	8489000	Yeah. Enjoyed the remake. Are you excited to hear that Resident Evil 3 appears to be happening because of this confirmed box art?
8489000	8490000	Yeah.
8490000	8491000	Yeah.
8491000	8492000	I knew it was going to be coming out.
8492000	8493000	Yeah.
8494000	8504000	Excuse me. Sorry. I didn't enjoy it as much as I liked Resident Evil 2, but I just hope that they don't make the...
8504000	8508000	What was it? Mr. X or Tyrant, whichever one he was in that game?
8508000	8510000	Nemesis is the big guy.
8510000	8512000	Not as annoying.
8512000	8513000	Yeah.
8513000	8515000	I mean, he's probably going to be as annoying as Mr. X is.
8515000	8523000	Well, some people are responding to this kind of redone art saying, yuck or yikes, you know, like Nemesis does not look good in this.
8523000	8528000	So, but it'll be interesting. I mean, if Resident Evil 3 does well, then I wonder if that means Resident Evil 4.
8528000	8535000	That could be a pretty big deal if they go. I mean, this just seems like a necessary step to get to that Resident Evil 4 redo.
8535000	8538000	That would be really, really something. So we'll see.
8538000	8543000	But it looks like this is happening. And I imagine we're probably going to get a trailer of some sort during the game awards.
8543000	8550000	That just seems like what's going to happen. We'll see. Will it maybe support VR like the most recent Resident Evil game did?
8550000	8555000	Don't know. I mean, we can make shit up all we want, but hopefully we'll get some kind of confirmation this week.
8555000	8560000	And it seems like a likely game awards thing, but we'll find out soon.
8560000	8568000	All right. Meanwhile, Dark Soccer, you have an interesting... This game is like several years old, but yet is being covered in the news this week.
8568000	8572000	Yeah, it is. And I think it's because it's getting a new release.
8573000	8580000	And see, that's why I was looking at it. Like, wasn't the story, wasn't this game already out?
8580000	8588000	But maybe it's getting some more attention just because of what's going on with, I guess, current events.
8588000	8591000	I know I picked it for a reason.
8591000	8594000	Can I quickly put an addendum on the last thing from a chat comment?
8594000	8595000	Sure.
8595000	8602000	Shane is in chat. Chad Starzik, who says, Jeff Keeley, or whatever it's spelled, said Resident Evil 3 will not be at the game awards.
8602000	8608000	It's more likely a state of play thing. I forgot. Yeah, PlayStation did announce they have a state of play this week.
8608000	8611000	And it's very possible this was actually a part of that.
8611000	8619000	So thank you for the update from apparently Jeff Keeley denying that Resident Evil 3 was planned for the game awards.
8619000	8620000	Sorry, Dark Soccer.
8620000	8622000	I honestly actually then don't know why I picked this one.
8622000	8627000	I figured it was because of the mainstream coverage and how it tied into what they were talking about in the story. I thought it was a neat story.
8627000	8637000	It is. It actually was posted by KTUU, an Anchorage, Alaska news station, NBC affiliate.
8637000	8643000	But the game never alone. It did get a release in November 2014 on the 18th.
8643000	8663000	And it was a game that was actually done in coordination with a tribal council in Alaska with their elders and, you know, the various indigenous people there.
8663000	8667000	And they did an interview with the creator.
8667000	8686000	And since it came out, it was featured over in a thousand publications, downloaded 3.5 million players and selected for over 75 best of the year game awards with multiple winners, including BAFTA, the British Academy Award.
8686000	8693000	And it's been on a number of multiple consoles and outlets.
8693000	8718000	But the big thing is that the game never alone seemed to really set a stage and a precedence for having more games like this that bring in ways of celebrating cultures that have been, you know, pretty much wiped out or I'd say highly damaged, if not completely wiped out by colonialization.
8718000	8732000	And, you know, the creator was a native Alaskan, you know, someone who grew up with that culture and seeing the damage that was done by this.
8732000	8747000	So they went in and we're just talking about how bringing this kind of universe to life and bringing that awareness to this aspect of culture has really set a stage for doing other kinds of games like this.
8747000	8753000	And this is the joy, you know, there are people who are in that culture who have played the game and found just an absolute love for it.
8753000	8758000	Yeah. You know, yeah. And I remember when this game first came out, certainly the cultural.
8758000	8764000	And it's interesting because we talked earlier about art as a message and art can be a bad thing, but art can also be a great thing.
8764000	8772000	And in this case, we've got a great thing because it was bringing some of those experiences and those stories to the video gaming format.
8772000	8775000	And when the game first came out, I thought that was neat about it.
8775000	8781000	But now with this KTU story and really showing like, no, no, we consulted with people.
8781000	8785000	We got, you know, like we showed this to some of the elders. We got that.
8785000	8788000	But I thought that really enhanced this.
8788000	8793000	And this is now the other reason why I know I brought this up is because they're working on a sequel.
8793000	8797000	So officially said they're working on the sequel for this game.
8797000	8801000	OK. But it's one that I played it. It was a great game.
8801000	8809000	And I'd say if nobody out there, you know, if you maybe haven't heard of it or haven't played it, first of all, I don't know what rock you were under.
8809000	8813000	But second of all, you really should play it and check your PlayStation or Xbox library,
8813000	8817000	because I believe it's been both on games with gold and place.
8817000	8822000	I know it's been on the PlayStation Plus. It may have been an epic game store thing.
8822000	8825000	So I know there was a second platform it showed up on as well.
8825000	8828000	I think I did that when I bought it. I got it on steam when it came out.
8828000	8839000	Yeah. But it's absolutely gorgeous game. The other thing, too, is and it really got me to thinking that with this consulting of, you know, the people whose culture it reflects and affects.
8839000	8843000	I was thinking back to what they did for Frozen 2, which I haven't seen yet.
8843000	8853000	But they worked with the indigenous peoples of the Scandinavian areas to make sure that they portrayed the indigenous people there properly.
8853000	8860000	And that we're really getting to see, you know, I would even say it's been just in the last decade we've started to see more respect for native cultures.
8860000	8868000	I mean, that is I mean, we still had the bullshit with the with the Dakota pipeline that that's some garbage.
8868000	8871000	And we've seen the fallout. They were right. Hello.
8871000	8880000	But but, you know, we've started to see more of an interest in hopefully a revitalization and preservation of these cultures.
8880000	8886000	And if video games can do this, I'm all for it and bring that awareness to other people.
8886000	8898000	You know, this is to me, this is I mean, even if the game creator was was in the culture, I think that doing something like this is what cultural appreciation is instead of appropriation.
8898000	8909000	You know, appropriation is when you are taking something from another culture with no respect to the context of how these things are and are trying to turn your own profit for it without benefiting.
8909000	8915000	When Cher dresses up like a Native American, that's, you know, the 70s were different white girls with dreads. Right.
8915000	8928000	OK. You know, so but I'm saying that, you know, you can take, you know, like, for example, say that I went out and I developed a game about Gecko in Kyoto.
8928000	8936000	Right. Which I love to do. I would, in doing so, consult.
8936000	8950000	With, you know, maybe a few proprietresses of Nokia speak to Gecko if I could and then make sure that when I'm putting out a game like that, I would have resources that link to these things.
8950000	8960000	Or if I was going to do a local native culture, I would make sure I did it in conjunction with their tribal leaders, with their historians and then give resources.
8960000	8968000	And in the case of something like that, I would give money to those groups, like a portion of my profits.
8968000	8974000	Going to this completely tangent. So I apologize. But apparently we actually have an Anchorage local listening to the show.
8975000	8989000	So Stroots 89 is in our chat going, oh, hey, that's my local station. And I was like, because I couldn't remember, I was like, is that the station where there was the on air reporter that was doing an investigation into a pot business?
8989000	8996000	And then she says, after the port is done, she's like, and I have to say, I'm the owner of the place. So fuck it, I'm out.
8996000	9001000	She says it live on air and walks off the set. You have to look for this clip on YouTube. It's great.
9001000	9007000	And apparently that was an Anchorage in that house. Because I remember I was like, I know it was an Alaska station. Was it Anchorage or was it Juneau? What was it?
9007000	9014000	So thank you to Stroots for confirming that was an Anchorage incident that happened there. Oh, it's on YouTube, Pixelboggers.
9014000	9022000	I wish I had this stuff on demand more or had the setup Bobby had where I could pull it up real fast. Maybe in the near future. I'm getting the concerns of these other ideas.
9023000	9032000	But yeah, look it up on YouTube. I wish I remembered her name. I don't remember, but maybe like Anchorage reporter quits on air or something like that.
9032000	9043000	I ought to find it. Tiger Claws or somebody's on the case now and I'll find the YouTube for you. But it's a great moment because the reaction of the anchor, she's just like, oh, okay.
9043000	9045000	She's just like, she doesn't know what the hell to do. It's great.
9045000	9049000	So I want to put out the challenge though, going back to my story.
9049000	9050000	Thank you, Matt. Yes.
9050000	9061000	I would like for people to find a game that highlights and celebrates a native culture in your area.
9061000	9067000	And then I want you to tweet me a link to that game at Dark Sakura on Twitter.
9068000	9079000	Tag me, tag O-L-R. But I want to see if you not only just go out and find, I want you to play it. Play it and tell me what you've learned.
9079000	9082000	If you've already played it, great. At me the game, tell me what you've learned.
9082000	9095000	But I'd like for people to look outside of just standard, oh, this is fun entertainment or oh, this is a pretty game entertainment and find a game that teaches you something about a culture other than your own.
9096000	9099000	Real teaching, not just a romanticized version.
9099000	9102000	Let us know if you get any tweets. I'd be super curious.
9102000	9110000	The Indians shared the food with the pilgrims and bird to bird to bird to and everybody was happy forever.
9110000	9116000	Something of that culture and not, you know, changed by another.
9116000	9123000	And even if it's, you know, the horrible impact that Western colonialism had on these cultures, I want you to learn something.
9123000	9130000	I want you to use video games and show them as an educational tool so that I can then go back to my mother and go, ha, I told you.
9130000	9133000	Kidding, kidding. No, I just want people to learn something.
9133000	9140000	Okay. Let's move on. A game that maybe, I don't know, some people think this is a giant troll.
9140000	9145000	Some people think this may be a game where you would learn something. I don't know. Let's talk about the Jesus game.
9145000	9148000	We have to talk about the Jesus game. What is this all about, Loki?
9148000	9156000	So the game is called I Am Jesus Christ and it's a game made by a developer who does a lot of these simulator games.
9156000	9158000	And you know I have B-roll.
9158000	9161000	I'm glad you do. That's fantastic.
9161000	9168000	So the developer has made like other simulator games such as Thief Simulator, House Flipper, that type of thing.
9168000	9176000	And it looks like a really weird like VR type of game where you perform miracles basically.
9176000	9190000	And it, yeah, it doesn't really look real. Like I watch, I watch this and it reminds me a lot of this YouTube channel I watch called Buttersight Down where they just, all you see is the dude's hands all the time and it does weird stuff.
9190000	9197000	But yeah, you have, you know, the performing miracles such as, you know, walking across water.
9197000	9201000	Who loves everyone white? Jesus wasn't my white man.
9201000	9208000	And then, and then this, it gets really weird where they're all like, now it's like, wow, you get to hang, hang out with your friends, literally.
9208000	9211000	And they weren't really his friends. Yeah.
9211000	9219000	And then he ascends to heaven, and then wait after the credits, after the credits. Look at that, look at that. The sequel resurrected.
9219000	9222000	Why is he white?
9222000	9227000	It's flea points out for the people who would actually care about this game, Jesus is white, lol.
9227000	9231000	So, hard facts, hard truths in our chat.
9231000	9237000	Yeah, so, so it's, it's the publisher, Playway Essay, they've done a bunch of different games.
9237000	9249000	It's weird though, because they have a lot of different, it's not like it's a new thing. They have like the car mechanic simulator stuff, cooking simulator, which is actually a pretty popular VR game that they have.
9249000	9260000	So they have some actual solid games in, in their portfolio here, but it seems like that they're kind of developed by different developers and all published under the same group.
9260000	9269000	But I mean, I don't know, the other games are kind of like VR, so maybe they decided there's money to be made in this industry.
9269000	9273000	And let's be real, there's money to be made here, so why not?
9273000	9281000	But they have, they have a whole ton of games that are on here, but a lot of these managers, simulators, but yeah.
9281000	9291000	I'm going to just say what y'all are thinking. I can't wait to see the live streams, because you know there's going to be live streams and people are going to do some really heinous things.
9291000	9298000	So let's bring on the live streams. So, I mean, like what happens if you lose? Like, how does that work?
9298000	9301000	Like that's, that's what we didn't see in there, or is that?
9301000	9303000	He just let the, let the people die.
9303000	9305000	I don't know. What happens to that old lady if you don't...
9305000	9313000	Is this, is this the Jesus version of the boys, you know, where he's like, well, I can't save you, so we'll just kill everybody.
9313000	9314000	I don't know.
9314000	9315000	Erase the evidence.
9315000	9316000	So we'll see.
9316000	9320000	Questbuster says, I guess it's more a faithful Jesus sim than the fight of the gods.
9320000	9322000	Sia Tabiri in chat suggests...
9322000	9323000	Jesus RP.
9323000	9327000	You just miracle yourself into winning. So, anyway.
9327000	9335000	Moving on. Let's talk about Star Wars and how it's going to work together with Fortnite. Yep, you heard me.
9335000	9343000	So Star Wars and Fortnite are going to be coming together because a new scene, a new exclusive scene from The Rise of Skywalker,
9343000	9350000	or Star Wars Episode 9, as I'm sure you all are aware of, will be shown in Fortnite at the Risky Reels.
9350000	9353000	It's a theater located in Fortnite. This was all revealed via...
9353000	9358000	Aren't you supposed to be playing a game and not just sitting there watching, like, video?
9358000	9360000	I mean, at least...
9360000	9365000	Fortnite has apparently taken some things from PlayStation Home and run with it.
9365000	9368000	I don't, I don't know what to think about this, but that's, that's what they're doing.
9368000	9376000	So, yeah, December 14th, six days before the film is out, a new and exclusive scene from the movie will be in Fortnite.
9376000	9385000	It's probably just going to be like BB-8 doing something cute or, you know, confirmation that not Baby Yoda is going to be in the movie.
9385000	9389000	How much is Epic paying for that kind of privilege? Or vice versa?
9389000	9394000	I don't know. It's going to be shown at two o'clock. I don't know if you have to pay. It's in Fortnite.
9394000	9400000	Well, no, I mean, like, because it's in Fortnite, like, how much do they have to pay Luke, you know, Disney here?
9400000	9404000	It's a publicity thing. I don't know. It's probably not going to be that big of a scene either.
9404000	9406000	It's not going to be, I mean, I would-
9406000	9408000	It's the end of the movie!
9408000	9414000	Nifty805 says, is Fortnite getting emo Kylo Ren? And then Questbuster says, may the Fortnite be with you.
9414000	9420000	Oh, God. All right. Anyhow, let's see.
9420000	9424000	So recently there was a Stormtrooper skin that was added into the game.
9424000	9430000	So you have that as well. If you want to go cosplay in Fortnite when you go watch the new clip.
9430000	9436000	I can't believe I just said that, but I did. Anyway, there it is. And yeah, Tigerclaw with the reality.
9436000	9440000	That clip will be online immediately. Yeah, I'm sure people are going to be, like, live streaming it.
9440000	9444000	So that's why I think the clip is not going to be that big a deal. It's going to be a short clip.
9444000	9446000	Glad you don't have to play Fortnite.
9446000	9450000	Or just, you know, not watch the clip and enjoy the movie.
9450000	9454000	Anyway, we're going to get to some calls.
9454000	9460000	So if you want to be on the show, you can join our green room over at vognetwork.com.
9460000	9466000	That's vognetwork.com slash Discord. And that will get you in the Discord server and you can call in.
9466000	9468000	And we'll be bringing some calls on air.
9468000	9470000	I don't know if we have any last minute stories.
9470000	9472000	No, I looked. There's-
9472000	9474000	Really?
9474000	9476000	It's pretty barren out there.
9476000	9482000	There was a rumor. Okay, so there was a rumor that, um...
9482000	9488000	What was it? That they're going to be porting some more PlayStation 4 games over the PC.
9488000	9494000	Um, Horizon Zero Dawn. But I don't know if that's the case.
9494000	9501000	Apparently the rumor is coming from the person that predicted Death Stranding or leaked Death Stranding or something.
9501000	9504000	Yeah, I was going to say, we know that Death Stranding is coming. Is this really interesting?
9504000	9506000	I don't know. We'll see.
9506000	9510000	We'll see. Alright, we do have somebody waiting in the green room, so let's get to a quick call.
9510000	9512000	Hi, you're on Orange Mountain Radio. Who's this?
9512000	9516000	Hey, Rob. This is Metal Mayhem. How are you?
9516000	9518000	Hey, Metal Mayhem. I'm good. What's on your mind, buddy?
9518000	9527000	Excuse me. Not too much. Since you were covering at the top of the show, I thought I'd talk about-
9527000	9530000	Hey, Metal Mayhem, we're getting a- Hey, just going to interrupt you real quick.
9530000	9535000	There's a little bit of echo when you're talking, so please try to make sure you're away from speakers or anything like that.
9535000	9538000	And go ahead and get your question out.
9538000	9545000	Yeah, sorry. I'm using my webcam because my headset's followed up. I'm trying to move around the best I can.
9545000	9557000	Since it was brought up at the top of the show, I thought I'd talk about PlayStation and its 25th anniversary.
9558000	9575000	Yeah, since the three of you have been using PlayStations in one form or another for quite some time, I wanted to ask you what initially drew you to the system?
9575000	9581000	Sorry, ask the question one more time. There was a little feedback there at the end.
9581000	9586000	Oh, I was just asking what drew you to the PlayStation.
9586000	9588000	What do you think of PlayStation?
9588000	9589000	What do we think?
9589000	9592000	What convinced you to buy your PlayStation?
9592000	9601000	What convinced you to buy PlayStation? All right, gotcha. Just because of the feedback, I'm going to drop you back in the green room, but thank you. We'll take on the question here in the studio.
9601000	9603000	Thanks, Metal Mayhem. Take care, buddy.
9603000	9604000	Final Fantasy VII.
9604000	9609000	I was going to say, I think we kind of hit on it in the opening segment, but Metal Mayhem might have joined the show a little late.
9609000	9613000	What specifically drew you to PlayStation?
9613000	9619000	Well, we did tell the stories about buying PlayStation, but maybe we didn't really get into the why.
9619000	9625000	I mean, I mentioned, sure, that Final Fantasy VII and that Nintendo 64, but was there other stuff with that?
9625000	9632000	And I think maybe the allure of the CD being a way to do that, to play games, I think was maybe part of it.
9632000	9635000	Not that I necessarily needed another CD player, but that was certainly a thing.
9635000	9643000	And I'm trying to remember if Symphony of the Night was out yet, because I remember that was a game that really sold me on PlayStation as a format.
9643000	9656000	Because I think specifically with that game, it showed that something like two-dimensional, like Castlevania or the original Castlevania IV, could still be done very well on PlayStation.
9656000	9668000	So I think really like Castlevania and Symphony of the Night was another one of those big, big releases that showed, hey, not everything has to be like 3D polygon-like craziness, but we can do some other types of stuff as well.
9668000	9670000	So there's that as well.
9670000	9679000	Darsakha, was there a little bit more like the why? Like, what was it about PlayStation that drew you to that versus Nintendo 64?
9679000	9681000	Or I guess maybe Sega Saturn?
9681000	9685000	I didn't know anyone had a Nintendo 64 and PlayStation came out before Saturn.
9685000	9689000	So that was it. It was what was there, what it had access to.
9689000	9692000	What were the early games you were playing? You were probably playing it before we were.
9692000	9702000	Toushinden, Jumping Flash, Jumping Flash 2. I'm trying to think what else I was playing.
9702000	9706000	I know another big one was Bust... Well, I still...
9706000	9707000	Pandemonium.
9707000	9711000	Out of habit, I still call it Bust-A-Groove, because that's what it was in the US.
9711000	9718000	That was after I'd already moved out here. So yeah, I had Bust-A-Move. I had Bust-A-Move 2. Lots of the Bimani.
9718000	9723000	I think I have like every Beatmania home version, like 5-key Beatmania.
9723000	9728000	And yeah, just a lot of that stuff.
9728000	9736000	Dan and I, one of his requirements for our relationship was that I beat Castlevania Symphony of the Night,
9736000	9742000	or as it was over there, Nocturne in the Moonlight. It was in the Dracula X series, which I did.
9742000	9749000	And you probably have echoes of the past of me screaming about taking forever to find another jewel ring
9749000	9754000	and trying to get my Yotsutsuna, or Yotsutsuna, whatever the blade was called.
9754000	9760000	And so Dan and I actually still quote that game, too. I'm interested in this.
9760000	9767000	And I thought it was funny they got both voice actors, the Japanese and the English one, for Bloodstained for the librarian.
9767000	9768000	Yeah.
9768000	9771000	Or for, what was his name? D?
9771000	9773000	Yeah, the equivalent of D.
9773000	9774000	Yeah.
9774000	9781000	You know another game that was huge on PlayStation and really kind of like selling on that console,
9781000	9787000	another music game that we have yet to mention, but I remember the first time, and this was from a demo disc,
9787000	9792000	I remember the first time I played Parappa the Rappa and the first stage in that game.
9792000	9798000	And it was like, holy shit, I'm playing a cartoon. Like literally that was like a moving fluid cartoon.
9798000	9804000	And it was, I know we always kind of think of video games and it was like, oh, Super Mario Brothers 2 looks like a cartoon.
9804000	9809000	And then on Super Nintendo, you know, but like it was like with PlayStation with how fluid it moved
9809000	9813000	and, you know, kind of literally coming off the page with the types of graphics.
9813000	9820000	I remember just being really thrown like for a loop in a good way by Parappa the Rappa's style.
9820000	9825000	So some different answers so that we don't repeat ourselves too much on that question there.
9825000	9830000	But yeah, I'm sure a lot of people, you know, looking back on PlayStation,
9830000	9833000	I bet there's a lot of people that didn't come into it with PlayStation 1.
9833000	9838000	You know, we all did, but I bet there's some people that didn't really discover PlayStation until PlayStation 2
9838000	9845000	or maybe PlayStation 3 because of PS2 being a DVD player or just the fact that maybe you're a little younger or what have you.
9845000	9850000	And so you haven't maybe, you know, you were still a baby when PlayStation 1 was still all the rage.
9850000	9853000	But, you know, you're a kid when PlayStation 2 happens. So anyway.
9853000	9856000	All right. Well, Metal Mayhem was the only one we had in the green room for now.
9856000	9860000	So I guess we'll go ahead and close up that portion there.
9860000	9863000	And Loki says we didn't have any last minute stories.
9863000	9867000	So that brings us towards the end and final thoughts and all that good stuff.
9867000	9870000	So I do want to thank everybody for tuning into Orange Launch Radio tonight.
9870000	9873000	And thanks for listening to us.
9873000	9881000	We really appreciate you guys checking us out, whether it was live here at Twitch TV on Sunday nights or if it was via the podcast feed or however you found Orange Launch Radio.
9881000	9886000	Thank you so much. Help us spread the word. Tell a friend or two about the show because we are at the show where every gamer has a voice.
9886000	9889000	But if the voices aren't out there, how can we air them?
9889000	9896000	So we hope to find more and more people through the coming weeks and on into 2020.
9896000	9899000	So thanks again for being here, no matter how you were here.
9899000	9903000	I guess we will now go around and get some final thoughts for the week.
9903000	9905000	Loki, we'll start with you. Your final thought tonight.
9905000	9912000	I'm hoping to work more on my game because that was something else I did this week was work more on the procedural generation portion of it.
9912000	9920000	Although I'm getting to the point now where I have to do the calculation for which doors so you can't backtrack.
9920000	9922000	But I was thinking about it the other day.
9922000	9928000	What if I just don't do that and have it where you can backtrack and then I can also incorporate like secrets and stuff that way.
9928000	9935000	I'm like, well, that'd be kind of cool. And that would save me a lot of work. But then I've already kind of started.
9935000	9941000	My final thought is I'll see you guys here Thursday at VOG Network for the Game Awards co-stream with Bobby Blackwolf.
9941000	9946000	And just a quick, cheap plug for my personal channel at Rob Roberts.
9947000	9952000	I will try to get in the habit of doing more streaming just, you know, with all the changes I've been going through this year with a new job and stuff.
9952000	9957000	It threw me off for a little bit. But I've been having some more weeknights where I'm like, oh, I should do something.
9957000	9965000	Now I'm kind of trying to decide, should I try to play more like Final Fantasy 14 and try to like build up in one certain game as streaming?
9965000	9969000	Or should I continue to play a little bit of everything? And I kind of gravitate towards playing a little bit of everything.
9969000	9974000	But Final Fantasy 14 can always be that game when it's like, I don't know what else to stream tonight. I can always play 14.
9974000	9980000	But I do want to play more Pokemon because I could, I think I only have like maybe captured like 130 or something like that.
9980000	9986000	So I have a lot more Pokemon still to catch in Shield and doing some raids and so forth.
9986000	9993000	And maybe some of you will raid with me if I live stream it so I can get a goddamn Snorlax. So that would be pretty cool.
9993000	10000000	So Shane is saying, yeah, Shane's kind of echoing that there. So I swear I said that before I read your comment there.
10000000	10004000	So that's all my thoughts. DarkSakura, last but not least, your final thought tonight.
10004000	10008000	I want to thank the people who've already replied to my Twitter post.
10008000	10017000	Again, if a video game taught you something, just reply to my tweet or just tag it video games taught me.
10017000	10028000	But yeah, just show me how video games have taught you a thing, a legit, you know, lesson, you know, be it about history or culture or language or psychology, name it.
10028000	10033000	Just link me something or tell me about something that video games have taught you.
10033000	10035000	A homework assignment from Ms. Sakura.
10035000	10038000	And tag it as video games taught me, please.
10038000	10041000	OK. Cool. All right. Good luck. Hope that takes off.
10041000	10044000	All right. That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
10044000	10049000	Thanks again, you guys, for tuning in tonight. And we will see you in seven days to do it all over again.
