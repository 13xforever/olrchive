2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
secrets a secret.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,420
How the show's biggest reveals were hidden from industry, event and other staff until

4
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,420

00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,340
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show

8
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,100

00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,620
Or as my sister might say, Christmas Eve Eve Eve.

12
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:56,060
Or as DarkSakura might say, the first night of Hanukkah.

13
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,900
Happy Hanukkah to you too.

14
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,340
Are you willing to show that on stream for those that are watching live as we do tape

o'clock pacific nine o'clock eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

17
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:14,260
And I was asking if DarkSakura would kindly step to the other side of the camera to show

18
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:18,660
off her holiday sweater that she's wearing this Happy Lamaka Happy Lamaka, which I love

19
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,660
it.

20
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:20,660
It's cute.

21
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:25,100
If I don't wear my pajamas to work on Friday on Wednesday, sorry for Christmas because

22
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,500
I'm working Christmas because hello double and a half pay.

23
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,500
Yeah, right.

24
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,500
On a 10 hour shift.

25
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,500
Yeah.

26
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,500
Hello.

27
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,500
I'd work too if I could for that kind of money.

28
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,820
Um, I might either wear this or my onesie.

29
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:34,820
I haven't decided.

30
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:35,820
There you go.

31
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,460
But I'm making latkes in two minutes.

32
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,460
That's right.

33
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,460
The latke countdown is on.

34
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,460
Yeah.

35
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,200
It's a, it's a holiday food festivity too actually.

36
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,860
And I want to mention this because before the show we were chowing down one of our listeners

37
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:51,660
stopped by the house because she's one of my ingress buddies and dropped off some nuts.

38
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:56,260
So we've been enjoying some candied nuts, which we have been calling Deez Nuts.

39
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:58,140
So we have been enjoying praline pecans.

40
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,140
Yes they are.

41
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,140
They are a praline pecans that we've been enjoying throughout the show.

42
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,140
Oh, is that some chat?

43
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:06,180
So show her a little love there for sharing Deez Nuts with us here on the show.

44
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,180
Thank you.

45
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:10,980
That's I believe that's the only way we can get away with showing nuts on camera here

46
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:15,260
at the wonderful Twitch TV in the spirit of the holidays.

47
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,260
All right.

48
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,080
Uh, but of course I can't have a discussion about food and leave out the one and only

49
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,080
tech master Loki.

50
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,080
Sorry.

51
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,080
I ate all the bread.

52
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,080
Well, there's actually two breadsticks left.

53
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,080
Two breadsticks.

54
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,080
Oh, and the spirit of the holidays you're sharing.

55
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,080
I'm just kidding.

56
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,080
Yes.

57
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,080
Cause I can't eat anymore.

58
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,720
Well, I'm so full right now.

59
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,700
And there's latkes coming cause dark soccer is, you know, we're all celebrating.

60
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:39,080
We were celebrating all of the holiday things, um, especially when food's involved.

61
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,080
Hello.

62
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,720
So like I'll celebrate all the winter holidays, uh, by eating.

63
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,640
So that's what we're going to do tonight is enjoy some latkes.

64
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,640
I'm excited.

65
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,640
So, um, yeah.

66
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,240
It's the one time, it's the one time of year where I can say dark soccer.

67
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:58,480
It's time to get in the kitchen and I'm not going to get yelled at.

68
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,480
Yes.

69
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,480
Dark soccer.

70
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,480
It's time to get in the kitchen.

71
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,480
Girl.

72
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,480
All right.

73
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,180
The only time of year that I can get away with that.

74
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:12,960
Cause it's not look behind you in the little orange can in the orange can, right?

75
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,840
It's going to be one of those nights, uh, folks that are tuning in and, uh, listening

76
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,040
on the podcast feed, of course, uh, which you can check out for yourself, uh, wherever,

77
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:27,440
uh, popular podcasts can be found such as, uh, Apple, iTunes and, um, Google, uh, store.

78
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,080
Uh, what is the Android Google podcast?

79
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,160
Uh, the only place we aren't on right now, we're not on stitcher because they kind of

80
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,960
burned their bridges with us a few years ago.

81
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,760
Uh, I'll tell you more about it some other time, although I've mentioned on the show

82
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,200
in the past and we are not yet on Spotify.

83
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,800
Uh, that is something that I'm hoping will be coming in 2020.

84
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,760
So, uh, yeah, pretty cool.

85
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,760
Anyway.

86
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,000
So hello everybody in chat.

87
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I see all the love.

88
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,640
I see some folks, um, uh, sharing some love for the sweater there.

89
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:01,640
Uh, and it looks like, um, a bunch, one of our very, very kind listeners, she Hulk, uh,

90
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,440
just somehow spammed out a bunch of emojis to folks that are watching live.

91
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,440
So everybody was saying, thank you.

92
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,440
Thank you.

93
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,440
Thank you.

94
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,440
So really appreciate that.

95
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,320
She hoax always, uh, one of our generous folks that's here listening live.

96
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,760
So anyway, let's get into it.

97
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,760
The news is a little lighter this week when it comes to video games, which makes sense.

98
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,760
I mean, with the holidays.

99
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,160
Well, if you think this week is slow, we're going to be here next Sunday.

100
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,800
That's I wouldn't expect hardly any news to come out this next week, but next week I'll

101
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
tease you with this.

102
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,520
Uh, we will be having our show where we can talk about the game of the year, but because

103
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,240
it's 2019, yes.

104
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,640
We also get to talk about the game of the decade and we can talk about the video game

105
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,640
news stories.

106
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,640
And, and.

107
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,640
Okay.

108
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:48,040
And, and I don't remember if this happens at the end of the year or the start of the

109
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,520
next year, but we have the time capsule.

110
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,720
Oh, I forgot about the time capsule.

111
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,720
Oh shit.

112
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,720
Okay.

113
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,960
Well, depending, I don't want to promise the time capsule next week, but depending on the

114
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,960
news.

115
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,880
So if we're really light on news, we may just do time capsule next week because it's close

116
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,880
enough to the end of the year.

117
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,880
Yeah.

118
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,880
I already think we did.

119
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,880
So yes, that's right.

120
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,880
We have time capsule.

121
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,880
I forgot.

122
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,880
I forgot about the fucking time caps.

123
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,880
That's the point we forget every year.

124
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:17,000
All right.

125
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,040
So anyway, uh, very excited about that.

126
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,240
So we'll be getting into the time capsule, uh, maybe next week or the week after, depending

127
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,880
on how things are going.

128
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,800
So anyhow, uh, let's get into our kickoff topic tonight, which has to do with the dual

129
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,800
shock force.

130
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,680
This actually is kind of a pretty big announcement for the end of the year.

131
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,840
This is the type of thing you would have thought might've been coming for the holidays or something,

132
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,840
but no, it decided to show up now.

133
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,840
I'm sorry.

134
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:46,320
My, when I say holidays, holiday shopping, meaning like it would have been out like black

135
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,320
Friday.

136
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,320
Yeah.

137
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,320
Now we're getting it.

138
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,320
The actual holiday a little close.

139
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,320
So I'm not sure.

140
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,120
Well, not even it's a next year.

141
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,120
Yeah.

142
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,120
We're getting the announcement now for next year.

143
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,120
Yeah.

144
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,120
So, yeah.

145
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,040
So anyway, uh, the back button attachment was announced by Sony this past week.

146
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,520
It actually has a little display on it, which is interesting.

147
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,520
So it is, it's a display for the back of your controller, but that display will actually

148
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,520
show you what you are mapping these back buttons to.

149
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,120
So, and I guess what it can actually store different control schemes as well, which is

150
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,120
interesting.

151
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,240
Uh, it also works with PlayStation VR titles, which we, you know, would be expected right.

152
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,480
And all that, uh, coming out on January 23rd and the attachment is going to be about $30.

153
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,280
So um, yeah, interesting.

154
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,280
What do you think about this?

155
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,280
Loki?

156
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,120
Oh no, it seems kind of unnecessary.

157
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,320
I, I hate to say it, but I'm kind of in a very similar sort of boat where I'm like,

158
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,860
I don't know if this is really necessary, but maybe that's because we haven't seen the

159
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:47,120
games that are going to incorporate this as a mapping stuff.

160
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,020
It seems like it's more of like this, like I'm going to be a competitive eat sports player

161
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,600
and interesting.

162
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:58,400
Um, I could see, well, uh, especially in a game like Final Fantasy 14, there's all sorts

163
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,780
of weird ass button combinations because you know, that's a game that's designed with like

164
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:05,520
keyboard and mouse, you know, although it works very well in controller, don't get me

165
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,520
wrong.

166
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,120
I would think that that attachment is going to lend itself very well to maybe doing some,

167
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,000
some macros and that type of thing.

168
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,680
But I mean, we don't, we, we don't think it has any separate functionality now, but it

169
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,040
might later.

170
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,320
Uh, and this kind of lends itself to something we were just talking about with our pal Bobby

171
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,560
Black Wolf, um, who was just live on his program.

172
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,840
And he was talking a little bit about how, um, his thought is that this could be an early

173
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,120
thing for the PlayStation five.

174
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,580
And part of the reason we're getting this now is because when the PlayStation five comes

175
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,120
out, these controllers, you know, if you have this attachment, they can kind of lend themselves

176
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,040
to the PlayStation five.

177
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,360
And I guess it would also make sense for games because there's going to be some games that

178
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,360
are going to be coming out.

179
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,440
So for example, the final fantasy seven remake is a prime example.

180
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,480
In my opinion, the final fantasy seven remake comes out and let's say it has functionality

181
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,200
that incorporates those back button triggers into something new.

182
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,000
I don't know what, you know, but something new.

183
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,720
Well, that almost would guarantee we're going to see this on PlayStation five, because I'm

184
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,480
telling you bank money on the fact that the final fantasy seven remake will be out on

185
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,720
PlayStation five as well.

186
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:17,160
It has to happen because this is only the first episode of more final fantasy seven

187
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:22,120
games because this, uh, fantasy seven remake only goes through the Midgar portion of the

188
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,120
game.

189
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,780
So the plan is to do the rest of it at some point, but by then most gamers will have moved

190
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,900
on to picking up a PlayStation five console.

191
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,780
So whatever happens next will have to be on the PlayStation five.

192
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:38,540
That's not even talking about what's going on in the Xbox world, but this controller

193
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,700
news isn't about Xbox, it's about PlayStation.

194
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,160
So we'll stick with that for now.

195
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:47,300
So I'm looking at our chat over at twitch.tv slash vog network, fifth dream today says,

196
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:52,260
I'm going to use it to map the X button to the back so I can press it with my left hand

197
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:59,900
to advance RPG text and eat with the right hand, actually, Hey, not a bad plan.

198
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:06,700
You know, and I have to say, um, when I first saw this design, my mind went to accessibility

199
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:11,620
and you're using it in a tongue in cheek way, but certainly for other gamers out there,

200
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:15,380
maybe this is going to be something that makes a certain games and certain button presses

201
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:19,260
and things, a more accessible thing, which is a very cool thing.

202
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:23,980
And in my mind, I kind of went, Ooh, maybe this is some type of response to the Xbox

203
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,780
accessibility controller.

204
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:29,980
Now, of course it's not the same thing by any means, but maybe, okay, maybe they saw

205
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:33,340
that an accessibility thing was really well received in attachment.

206
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:38,620
So they wanted to do something similar so I could see that perspective as well.

207
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,740
So I don't know.

208
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:44,280
I don't think, I think if they wanted to do something like that as an accessibility thing,

209
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:49,260
they would make it, it would be more robust, like the accessibility stuff with Xbox.

210
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,740
This is kind of like, I think this is more of like, Hey, you know, we've seen some of

211
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:57,300
these third-party controllers or even like with Microsoft, with their elite controller

212
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,340
where they have these back button triggers and stuff.

213
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:04,100
Let's get a piece of that action way too late in the game.

214
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,580
Now of course, because this is our chat room in the spirit of Christmas, they're going,

215
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,100
they're taking it to the toilet.

216
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,100
Awesome.

217
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,100
Yes.

218
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,460
Beat me to it.

219
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:18,140
Because fifth dream today was saying I could have used my left hand to advance RPG text

220
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,900
and eat with the right hand.

221
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:24,340
And Bobby Black Wolf merely responded in quotes, eat.

222
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,700
And Bobby Black Wolf.

223
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,780
He didn't say, he did not say visual novels.

224
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,780
He said, RPG.

225
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:35,040
Pod culture follows that up with the PlayStation fap attachment.

226
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,140
So there we go.

227
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:42,420
If those types of games are coming out, if a Hunie pop is announced for PlayStation,

228
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,660
then maybe that will be a thing.

229
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:44,660
I don't know.

230
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,780
What are those adult games on Steam?

231
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,780
I don't know.

232
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,780
Like all of them.

233
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,780
I mean, there's like so many.

234
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,660
I don't think that was an adult game.

235
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,660
Is it?

236
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,660
I thought it was.

237
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,660
Anyway.

238
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:58,900
Pixelpaca says there was that one-handed RPG controller on PlayStation one.

239
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,460
I seem to remember something like that too.

240
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,900
So and dark soccer is trying to participate in the kitchen without a microphone, but she's

241
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,900
saying she used one.

242
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,340
When I had surgery on my hand.

243
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:10,020
Oh, when she had surgery on her hand, she used one.

244
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:15,640
So anyway, Pixelpaca's in chat says fun bag fantasy.

245
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,420
That is a real game name on Steam.

246
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:20,940
Well, of course, because if we're going to talk about the toilet, let's talk about Steam's

247
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:26,220
library, which I'm sure you're all consuming during the wonderful Steam sale that's going

248
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,220
on for the holidays.

249
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,420
But I think we get into more on that later on.

250
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:34,500
But anyway, She-Hulk in chat says the Xbox elite controller rocks.

251
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,820
Maybe the best ever made.

252
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:40,260
Well, good news for you, She-Hulk, is that with the next round of Xbox or the XX or the

253
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:45,540
Xbox Series X, if you want to be legit, the controller that is bundled in with it is a

254
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,860
lot more like an elite controller.

255
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:51,700
It isn't exactly an elite controller, but like the D-Pad is more like what you see with

256
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,700
the elite controller.

257
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:57,420
So it's taking a lot of its cues from that controller and that it is a really nice controller.

258
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,720
Let's you know, let's tell the truth here.

259
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,700
It's a great controller, but a pair of back buttons and a screen on the back of the controller

260
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,900
is not going to turn the PlayStation.

261
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:09,340
But is that really worth spending another $30 for?

262
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,320
As it is in my in my.

263
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,040
That's like more than half the cost of the controller.

264
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,200
Here's my opinion.

265
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:21,040
For me in my current position, no, it's not worth it and I'm not going to pick one up.

266
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:27,640
However, I think it's cool that it's out there as an option for potential accessibility issues.

267
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,360
That's great.

268
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,500
And if we see games incorporating it in the future and this whole PlayStation 5 theory

269
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:39,360
kind of lends itself to light, then I'd probably be more likely to pick one up.

270
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,480
However, if this is functionality that's just built into the PlayStation 5 controller,

271
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,580
then I'm more likely to just pick up a PlayStation 5 and I'll have it built into whatever controller

272
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,160
they release at that time.

273
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,400
And that's when I'll finally have the back buttons or whatever that is.

274
00:12:54,400 --> 00:13:00,920
So anyway, She-Hulk continuing to lavish praise on the Xbox elite controller and chat saying

275
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,680
my online gaming improved instantly, felt like I'm cheating with it.

276
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:09,060
It is it is a nice piece of hardware, but I mean, you pay a premium for it.

277
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:13,420
It's almost expensive as expensive as a console, but it is really, really well done.

278
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:16,580
And I mean, the fact that you can use those on PCs as well, I mean, you know, it's pretty

279
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,580
cool.

280
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,580
So.

281
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,580
All right.

282
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:25,480
So a big no on this attachment, but yay that it exists from both of us here on camera.

283
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:30,080
And I think Jamie, she's finishing up the lockers, but I think she, do you approve Dark

284
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,080
Sakura of this?

285
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,080
Sure.

286
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:37,580
She says sure for this attachment, but I think more maybe the premonition of perhaps what's

287
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,500
to come with PlayStation five.

288
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,980
Let's let's marinate on that for a little bit.

289
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,340
Thirty dollars for more junk in the trunk for my controller.

290
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:50,500
Dark Sakura saying from the kitchen something that I had brought up a Bobby show that I

291
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,500
forgot about.

292
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:56,260
But talking about the Vita title implementation, because, you know, Vita had the back touch.

293
00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:02,220
Now, this is not the same thing because the PlayStation back attachment are buttons and

294
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:06,020
the PlayStation four back was like you could swipe different directions.

295
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,380
It was a touch pad.

296
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:10,380
But a lot of games kind of used it like buttons.

297
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:14,940
In fact, if you tried to emulate PlayStation two games on your Vita, you would have, there

298
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:19,080
was no L2 and R2 so you had to use the back screen to kind of do that.

299
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:26,140
So there is an argument to be made that this is, you know, something that could be opening

300
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:31,340
the door to Vita support later down, down, down, down the line, but we'll, we'll see.

301
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:36,740
So I guess we'll see as the games start to come out in 2020, pay attention to that Final

302
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,940
Fantasy remake.

303
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,420
I think that's going to be a very big barometer with that sort of thing.

304
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,420
So, all right.

305
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,300
Anything else on the back button attachment?

306
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,300
I don't think so.

307
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,340
So let's move on and talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we

308
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,820
have been playing this week.

309
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,220
I think Dark Sakura is wrapping up the first batch of latkes.

310
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,420
So I'm going to just go ahead and start with Loki while she finishes up.

311
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,340
I didn't play jack shit.

312
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,380
So I, no, I did.

313
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:04,420
I played a little bit of Minecraft earth and a little bit of Pokemon go, but that's about

314
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,420
it.

315
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,420
I didn't really play any console games.

316
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:11,900
I did pick up finally, um, only because my kids wanted me to, and I've been just holding

317
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,820
off on it, but, um, Beat Saber.

318
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:21,420
So I picked that up and, um, I'd recommend the green day stuff because I really, I did

319
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,420
not.

320
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,660
Um, I haven't picked up anything yet.

321
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:29,220
I was going to get some of the tracks that they have as part of their, um, I forget what

322
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:35,540
the label is, but the, there was some of the stuff from a robot.

323
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:39,020
Was it a think a robot machine or something like that?

324
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,060
That, uh, it was pretty cool.

325
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,820
I've been listening to some of their tracks, monster cat, monster cat.

326
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,820
Thank you.

327
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,900
So yeah, the monster cat, um, music, I was thinking about picking up that pack, but I

328
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,420
haven't done it yet.

329
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,740
Um, it's good.

330
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,740
I like the stuff.

331
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,940
They have a couple of freebies too.

332
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:54,940
Like the crab rave.

333
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:55,940
Oh, that'd be cool.

334
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:56,940
Yeah, that's fun.

335
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:00,420
What I recommend though, if like you are looking to pick stuff up on the steam sale is go check

336
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:04,640
Humble Bundle too, because Humble Bundle, when you do it through them, you also get like

337
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,740
a certain percentage of that back onto your account as like a credit.

338
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:11,140
So it actually ends up being slightly cheaper.

339
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,820
Okay.

340
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,900
So Lacas have set up the fire alarm.

341
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,040
So Loki, you're going to have to fill time for yourself while I take care of this.

342
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,620
So I mean, so basically I was just, um, you know, looking to get some games there.

343
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:30,820
I didn't end up purchasing, uh, Earth Defense Force, um, Iron Rain.

344
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:36,580
Almost purchased that, but, um, I just don't know if I'm going to get to it right away.

345
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,360
And also the reviews aren't that great for it.

346
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,360
So we'll see.

347
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,860
Maybe it has to get a little bit cheaper than 29.99.

348
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:46,100
Uh, what I did do today though, is I did introduce the kids to Cuzar finally.

349
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:51,660
So we drove the hour away to the one place that has Cuzar nearby and went and played

350
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,660
there.

351
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:58,300
And unfortunately, even though it was an hour in the rain, both directions, uh, there wasn't

352
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:02,140
really anybody else there because it's a Sunday during the day.

353
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:06,700
Um, and no one really wants to play Cuzar apparently, but at least everything was in

354
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,700
decent condition.

355
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,060
Although the arena is surprisingly dark.

356
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:14,600
I do not remember it being that dark and like when I went in there, I was like, are there

357
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,600
lights out?

358
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:21,180
I mean, I don't remember it being this dark, but, um, the kids picked it up really quickly

359
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:25,980
and, and bless her heart, they said it's the most favorite, you know, laser tag game

360
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,980
that they played.

361
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,540
And I was like, cool.

362
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,540
I'm sorry.

363
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:31,180
I was dealing with the fire situation or smoke.

364
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,180
It's smoke.

365
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:35,860
It's just, it's not really, uh, the oil that she uses lock has makes a lot of smoke and

366
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,020
we didn't have a window open.

367
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,180
So it was building up under, there's a fire alarm just, can you even see it?

368
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,740
You can actually see it on camera way in the corner there.

369
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,860
And that's the one that was going on.

370
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:44,860
So sorry.

371
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,660
Um, so I'm sorry you took them to the one in Vacaville.

372
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,660
Yes.

373
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,660
Oh fun.

374
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,660
Yeah.

375
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:54,140
It was really worth the trip though, down there, just because the amount of time we

376
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,680
got to actually spend there wasn't very long and there wasn't a whole lot of people there.

377
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,580
Although they have a whole new arcade, like their arcade is like redone.

378
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,660
Oh wow.

379
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:06,500
Which not necessarily in the good sense, it's all of the giant, those huge, like kind of

380
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:11,420
attraction games that they have like the, the huge, I'm not gambling, but it's the thing

381
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,700
that you have to pull a lever on to spin something.

382
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,700
It's it's gambling, um, ticket machines.

383
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:21,980
And then they also had, um, the giant halo game that's there.

384
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,380
Um, that was kind of cool.

385
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:27,440
No DDR or anything or I think the last time I went there was in the groove too or something,

386
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,940
but none of that anymore.

387
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:34,580
Um, and of course, you know, the two kids working the counter for Qsar just didn't give

388
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,780
a shit about Qsar.

389
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:41,560
They, they gave him as much of a shit as the kids at the, um, local laser tag place here.

390
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,420
So it's fine.

391
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,420
You know, whatever.

392
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:47,020
Um, well, they had fun.

393
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:50,980
We played a couple of games and then drove back home because it's an hour drive in the

394
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,780
rain and traffic.

395
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:55,940
And so, um, yeah, it was fun.

396
00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:01,100
It's worth, it was worth it to get them to see that when I do it again, probably not,

397
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,300
but I'll have to go down there at some point again.

398
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,300
Okay.

399
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,300
Fun.

400
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,700
Um, let's see my gaming week.

401
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,300
Um, a lot of similar stuff.

402
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:13,140
I'm still playing Final Fantasy 14 as always, uh, been going on random blue mage adventures

403
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:16,460
in that game because in one of the group chats I was in, they started talking about blue

404
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,620
mage randomly.

405
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:22,100
Um, and I was like, oh, I haven't really checked that out since, um, you know, it was first

406
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:26,620
added into the storm blood expansion and I was kind of very lukewarm on it, but they

407
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,740
added new content.

408
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:32,260
So they added content up to level 60 so you can play a blue mage up to level 60 now.

409
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:35,940
So I was like, okay, I'll go check it out and, you know, see what's different about

410
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,940
it.

411
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:41,180
And, uh, yeah, I, I still wish they would just let you play a blue mage in regular content

412
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:45,800
and I'm not going to rehash the old arguments, but it's been a fun little diversion.

413
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,320
It's something new to do in the game.

414
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,640
I like that there's like a million different things you can do with Final Fantasy 14 besides

415
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,080
just like rating.

416
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,220
So I'll give them that.

417
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:57,360
At least they've created a lot of fun side things to do, even if, you know, a blue mage

418
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,900
should be part of the main content.

419
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,460
I was going through my PlayStation account today because I was checking out the holiday

420
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,520
sale to see if there was anything I wanted to buy.

421
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,360
Um, and I just started randomly playing stuff on my PlayStation that I hadn't played in

422
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,360
a while, like DJ Max Technica, which I still want to buy some of those DLC song packs,

423
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:17,000
but they're really expensive still.

424
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,080
So I'm like, I don't want to pay like 15 bucks because I really like one song in this pack.

425
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,780
I did hear the DJ Max Technica is on the early release on PC, but I'm not, I'm not double

426
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,080
dipping for that much money.

427
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,860
They want, they want a like full price game for it and I'm not, I'm not going to double

428
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:35,160
dip for that for like two new songs or whatever it is they have on PC.

429
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,360
Uh, it's not enough licensed stuff to make it worth it to me.

430
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,360
Sorry.

431
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,300
Um, but I was playing that a little bit and then I was also playing, um, it's getting

432
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,300
smoky in here again.

433
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,300
I'm really worried.

434
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,300
It's gonna, no, it's fine.

435
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,300
It is.

436
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,300
Is that the last batch you said?

437
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,300
Okay.

438
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,740
So hopefully it doesn't go off again, but I'm eyeing it suspiciously.

439
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:56,580
This is why when I used to make super vacant that we'd have a dedicated fan to blow the

440
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,220
smoke away from the smoke alarm.

441
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,220
Yeah.

442
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,220
I might.

443
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,220
Okay.

444
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,340
Well we'll see if, if it goes off again, Loki, you just need to fan it with your jacket out

445
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:10,500
of there and it'll be just the calendar that we have that, that to, um, also a window.

446
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,060
Alan opened a window in there and then I opened the window here.

447
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:13,820
It'll be fine.

448
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:14,820
It'll draft through.

449
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,820
It's just going to take a minute.

450
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:21,160
So anyway, um, patient pockets and chat says I double dip for DG max respect on steam.

451
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,160
Was it worth it?

452
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,160
Pay some pockets.

453
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,420
I mean like truly like, do you enjoy it?

454
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,540
Are you happy with that?

455
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:32,020
Cause I mean, Lord knows I've doubled and triple dipped on things that maybe I shouldn't

456
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,820
have, but I just liked the game that much.

457
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,820
They did it.

458
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,380
For example, Mass Effect three on Wii U.

459
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,940
There was no point to me doing that.

460
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,940
There really wasn't.

461
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:47,620
Um, speaking, speaking of double dipping, um, I played Pac-Man championship edition

462
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:52,340
on PlayStation four cause I already had it, but I also had the one on switch because the

463
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:57,460
switch version came with the two player one, the CE plus or whatever it was called.

464
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:01,460
I don't remember, but I remembered, Oh yeah, I have this on PlayStation and because I've

465
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:05,140
been playing a lot on switch, I got better and I was like, what are these trophies?

466
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,140
I don't have a lot.

467
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,540
I only have to get an a on expert mode to get a gold.

468
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,700
I should be able to do that.

469
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:14,220
And I did, and I actually got two golds to get a gold for B and a gold for a.

470
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,220
So it was like, cool.

471
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,420
If I could get an S getting an S is really hard.

472
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,980
I could probably do it.

473
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:24,100
Um, cause I've done it on a beginner or whatever they call the first single train mode, but

474
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:28,060
I haven't done it on a expert mode, which is it's hard.

475
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,920
Expert mode is a lot of luck is involved.

476
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,060
I think that's why some people get really annoyed with championship edition too.

477
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:37,560
Cause there's a lot of luck involved in it, especially when the ghosts go on rails.

478
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:43,200
So anyway, um, so I was playing a little bit of that and um, I think that's really about

479
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,560
it for my gaming week.

480
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,560
I don't think there was a lot of extra stuff really.

481
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:50,000
Uh, trying to think, Oh, uh, the cell phone gaming stuff.

482
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,380
So, um, I was actually going to ask you, cause you mentioned Minecraft earth, but the smoke

483
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,560
alarm thing threw me off.

484
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:58,440
Uh, I've noticed that some updates for Minecraft earth came down to my phone.

485
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,960
Have they actually updated, changed anything in it?

486
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,660
They have an event going on right now for like the holidays.

487
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:09,940
So they have, you can get the, the jolly llama, which I did get and they've got like snow

488
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:13,220
and stuff like that, that they're adding like blocks that you can get.

489
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:16,440
I haven't really done any of the adventures recently to see if those are different, but

490
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,020
other than that, that's kind of it.

491
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,020
Oh, that's fun.

492
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,020
Did you hurt yourself?

493
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,020
I burned my knuckle.

494
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,020
Oh no.

495
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,020
Do you need anything?

496
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,820
No, it's just the oil popped and it's fine.

497
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,980
I ran it under the cool tap, but I should have run it longer.

498
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:29,980
Yeah.

499
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:30,980
It's anyway.

500
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,100
Well, if you feel you can do it, why don't you tell us about your gaming week?

501
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,540
Um, I played some, uh, did my shirt melt?

502
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,540
No.

503
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,540
Okay.

504
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:40,540
I played, um, uh, Pokemon, uh, sword and that's about it.

505
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:45,940
Um, I finally deleted, uh, idle pouring, so I'm no longer playing the Ragnarok thing.

506
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,940
Freedom.

507
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:50,180
Um, I started playing Orna.

508
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,820
Kind of bored.

509
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:54,260
That was like, that was like me, sorry, really quickly.

510
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:59,540
That was me when I uninstalled Diablo three, it was like, Oh my God, it's like this sudden

511
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,680
freedom I was feeling.

512
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,720
I'm trying Orna out and it's, it's okay.

513
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,720
I am not having a burden knuckle.

514
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,780
You need to get, you need to join his that's party cause then she just plays and it power

515
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,920
levels you to like 80 in a minute.

516
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,620
Well, I'm already like 60 so wow.

517
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,620
That's way further than I got.

518
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,620
Good for you.

519
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,120
I got to like a level 10, something like that.

520
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,120
Okay.

521
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,760
Um, cause I wanted, I wanted a sorceress or witch.

522
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,760
I got to witch.

523
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,920
I'm next up a sorceress, but I have to earn more Orna.

524
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,920
Okay.

525
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:35,400
But, um, I'm still doing Pokemon go, I'm still doing the Harry Potter game, but I am no longer

526
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,600
ever going to spend any money on the Harry Potter game again because I am not going to

527
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,320
give my money to a turf.

528
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,540
Um, does she get money from that?

529
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:46,200
She gets money from everything with her licenses on it.

530
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:51,100
I liked your idea of taking it back and just giving it to the fans, the fans, but still

531
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,560
financial support.

532
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,160
I don't feel right doing it.

533
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:58,800
I'm not going to contribute any money to a franchise that supports a turf.

534
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,800
Yeah.

535
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,680
It's unfortunate that she, um, opened her big mouth to say that.

536
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,480
And also Ricky Gervais him as well.

537
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,320
I already knew he was garbage, but now he's even hotter garbage.

538
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,320
Did you see that thing?

539
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,880
And again, I'm not, I don't want to sound like I'm justifying those comments at all

540
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,000
cause I'm not, but I thought this was an interesting perspective.

541
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:22,620
I saw an article that tried to talk about like British culture and how that might have

542
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:26,120
an impact on it and some of the things that are going on in Britain.

543
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:34,680
Yeah, but we also have Boris Johnson and the people that support that garbage.

544
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,720
It's the same thing that's happening over here.

545
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,400
So anyway, uh, pistol pockets and chat says me says nothing.

546
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,480
JK Rowling says some goddamn bullshit.

547
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,480
Yeah.

548
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,480
That's pretty much what it felt like.

549
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,400
Uh, Bobby Lockwell says, LOL.

550
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,760
We're still playing Orna here.

551
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,760
Okay.

552
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,840
So I mentioned this game just like quickly in passing and then like all of you picked

553
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,080
it up and started playing it, which is interesting to me.

554
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,080
What's Orna.

555
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,120
Orna is okay.

556
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,200
So I went on like a GPS game binge.

557
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,600
So one of our listeners lives here.

558
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,600
It's her nuts.

559
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,600
Okay.

560
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,600
So the nut lady.

561
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,600
Okay.

562
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:13,280
Um, she, uh, showed this game to me, this Orna, which it uses GPS, but, um, Oh, that's

563
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,280
the RPG one.

564
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,280
You're right.

565
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,280
It's like an RPG.

566
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,920
It uses like classic eight bit graphic looking things, but it's on like a, and I just realized

567
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,200
I can't really show the camera cause it might show where I live.

568
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,200
Oops.

569
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,960
It has a lovely piano soundtrack.

570
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:30,200
Um, but, uh, yeah, you can see how there's like little things.

571
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,200
Yeah.

572
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,200
That's right.

573
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,400
Remember you showed that it's like a, it's like a classic RPG, but the, the stores and

574
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,120
stuff are out in the real world.

575
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:43,120
So for example, I was complaining that there wasn't a store near my house or whatever.

576
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:49,520
So as that she came by here, she built a store out front cause I guess she could do that

577
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,920
at a certain level.

578
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,160
So now I have a store right here on my house.

579
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,160
Yeah.

580
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,160
Which is great.

581
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:59,140
So, uh, luckily there's a lot of stores, so I'm not like giving away my address or anything

582
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:04,020
and it's like, you can, I'll tell you, there's a, there's a place that you can go to where

583
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,440
there's like 20 stores like all of that.

584
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,360
And I'm like, you can just guess that an Orna player lives there.

585
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,360
So there you go.

586
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,760
Um, Bobby Black Wolf in chat says, we love it because there's no ads and we can just

587
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,500
play it while sitting in our house.

588
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,080
We, we built a store in my front yard.

589
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,240
Uh, Bobby says I'm level 82 and my life wife is level 84.

590
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,240
Wow.

591
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,000
I may have to pick that up and try it.

592
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Yeah.

593
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,140
I didn't, I got to admit, I'm not like super into it cause I just don't think the GPS stuff

594
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:39,720
is that, um, engrossing, but it is a nice little like, thank you, dark sucker.

595
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:45,880
It is a nice little like mindless, like, Oh, I'm just gonna, you know, sit on the toilet

596
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:52,280
and you know, tap kill, kill, die, die, die, and you know, all the, um, uh, slimes and

597
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,400
goblins and orcs and things that are on the house.

598
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,960
So there you go.

599
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,120
So that was pretty much it for my gaming week.

600
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,320
Um, so dark soccer, did we get everything for your gaming week?

601
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,800
You talked about, okay, so we're good.

602
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,000
So let's move on and get into some gaming news.

603
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,580
And I want to at least try one of these latkes here.

604
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,160
The dark soccer has made.

605
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:15,320
So Loki, while I jump into food here, tell us about our first story tonight.

606
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:20,640
So, uh, Borderlands three is coming or is out on Stadia.

607
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,520
And one of the things with Stadia, the advantage to that platform is supposed to be, Hey, you

608
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,440
know what, you can just get into your game and play it and you don't have to worry about

609
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,000
downloading updates.

610
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,080
It's just as updated as it could possibly be, except that it's not.

611
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:42,020
So what happened was is the Stadia version, um, that's out currently is the one that they

612
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:47,220
released the version that came out October 24th, um, which is when they had like their

613
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,820
Halloween themed bloody harvest event.

614
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:55,620
So apparently there's several, uh, hot fixes and patches that have been added since then,

615
00:28:55,620 --> 00:29:01,100
but those aren't available right now through, uh, Stadia and they're saying they're expecting,

616
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:04,620
for example, like Moxie's heist of handsome jackpot.

617
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:09,420
Um, that's supposed to be expected on Stadia early 2020.

618
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:15,040
So it's, it's like, yeah, it, you, it will download the updates for free or add the updates,

619
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:21,420
but there's going to be a delay between the PC version or the console version and Stadia,

620
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:28,820
which I mean, it really doesn't need any more reasons not to purchase games through there.

621
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:32,380
Considering that, like, I don't even know what the cost is for this game right now through

622
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:36,140
Stadia, but all I can tell you right now is it's marked down everywhere else because of

623
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,780
the holidays and sales.

624
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:44,500
So like maybe I should have just purchased it elsewhere.

625
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:51,580
This is just another like yikes thing in Stadia's column to me when Google Stadia doesn't seem

626
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:55,780
to have a lot of real positive steam going its direction when we talk about a lot of

627
00:29:55,780 --> 00:30:01,620
the buzz online, that's not to say the internet makes up the majority of, you know, what actually

628
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,240
sells out there and that sort of thing.

629
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,780
Because like, for example, I think Bobby was talking about on his show, he had a friend

630
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:13,560
or a coworker or something that's like all about Stadia because, you know, if it, it's

631
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:17,800
one of those things where like, if it uniquely works for your situation, then it really works

632
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,880
for your situation.

633
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,880
You know what I mean?

634
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,880
Yeah, I get it.

635
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,160
But like, I'm curious to see what their numbers are and the fact that those numbers haven't

636
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:30,420
been like thrown out there like, oh yeah, it's great, tells me it's not great.

637
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:35,940
So I will have to wait and see when the next Google conference is going to be when they'll

638
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:41,180
talk about Stadia numbers, if they talk about Stadia numbers and what's coming towards that

639
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,060
you know, that platform or whatever.

640
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:47,420
But they're gonna have to do a lot more to it just to get people's buy-in on that.

641
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:55,160
Because right now it's just kind of, eh, I don't know, they like, just if you can't afford

642
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:00,380
to like game on those consoles right now, I mean, we're talking about like this generation

643
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,460
and we're getting into a new generation of consoles.

644
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:06,340
I mean, you can always purchase the last generation of consoles and there's a lot of games out

645
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:09,460
there that are going to be marked down or much cheaper.

646
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:15,100
I mean, I don't know that you really necessarily need to, I wouldn't necessarily want to dump

647
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,800
money into a platform that I don't know is going to be around, especially if a digital

648
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:23,180
platform that if it goes under, then you're kind of stuck.

649
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:30,220
Whereas, you know, if my PlayStation 4, if for some reason Sony's PlayStation network

650
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:34,660
infrastructure went down, I could probably still play my games through my console, even

651
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,260
though they'd be offline.

652
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,340
So I don't know.

653
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:40,580
I think it's not very promising.

654
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:43,300
Yeah, I will.

655
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,300
Yeah.

656
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,500
If they were to put out some big numbers, I think you're right, then we'd know that

657
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,020
like it's doing really, really well.

658
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:54,500
But to be fair to Google, this whole thing that they were releasing was supposed to be

659
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,420
like an early access thing.

660
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:01,700
And yeah, you know, the console or whatever, my quotey fingers, the console is supposed

661
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,740
to be free, right?

662
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:13,740
So when we actually see the version of this that is playable for free, we'll see what

663
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,740
it looks like.

664
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:17,740
The adoption rate looks like then, like how many people are actually paying some money

665
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:21,860
to be able to play these games in their browsers and so forth that almost curious to remember

666
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:25,820
how they were saying like to get the most out of the stadia stuff as far as like this,

667
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:29,740
you know, they're talking about their controller and how it's Wi-Fi and how it, you know, that's

668
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:32,180
going to have the least amount of latency available.

669
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:35,500
I'd be curious to see like the comparison between that and other controllers, too, because

670
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:39,020
I think that's that's a bunch of hot bullshit right there.

671
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:43,300
What they're trying to say, you know, oh, by your one hundred nine dollar controller.

672
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,500
I don't buy that for one minute, but.

673
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:52,740
I don't know, I'm just very curious to why someone would want to purchase games through

674
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:58,340
stadia versus like actually buying a console aside from, you know, saving the two hundred

675
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:04,180
three hundred dollars on a next gen or on a console or if they're thinking, oh, well,

676
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:09,300
I'm going to avoid, you know, buying, you know, a high end PC or console next generation.

677
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,140
I'm just going to download games through stadia.

678
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,060
I don't know, like I.

679
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:19,620
I don't know if that's going to be really big advantage as far as being able to save

680
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:24,420
money, the portability I can see if I traveled more for work, I travel a little bit for work,

681
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:28,580
but not enough, but if I traveled maybe a little bit more than I do, I could see, you

682
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:32,940
know, oh, if all I need to pack is a tablet and a little controller and then I can play

683
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:36,780
Google stadia stuff like that's what makes a switch awfully convenient for traveling.

684
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:40,020
Right. The switch is, you know, it's it's got that portability to it.

685
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,860
You know, you can easily pack it away or whatever.

686
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,860
And then when I'm at home, I can play it on the big TV.

687
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:47,620
I could see an argument like that being made for stadia is that like, you know, if you

688
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:51,540
are on the road a lot and maybe you don't have a living room in the traditional sense

689
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:56,020
that you're in most of your time, then maybe a tablet and a controller would go a long

690
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:59,460
way in being able to stay current on the latest and greatest in gaming.

691
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:05,860
Yeah, but I can't imagine, though, that that subset of people that play games is that huge.

692
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:10,900
Like it's like, well, this is good if you don't if you you don't this, this, this, this,

693
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,420
this and this, this, this.

694
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:19,060
It's like it's such a narrow scope for stadia that I just don't see it ever doing.

695
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:24,340
Even if it was most successful with that narrow scope, I don't see it is performing as

696
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,860
well as like other consoles.

697
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:29,620
Like I just I'm very skeptical to see where this is going to go.

698
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:36,820
And I just feel that it's it's a nice idea, but I think it's way too early for it to be

699
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:37,460
implemented.

700
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:42,420
I don't think our Internet structure infrastructure is what it needs to be to implement this

701
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:42,900
correctly.

702
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:47,940
If it was just like no bandwidth caps whatsoever and like everything's super fast, you know,

703
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:51,780
all the time, like I could take my phone and I have no trouble whatsoever streaming content

704
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:58,180
to it like really 4K content to my phone no matter where I am, like over the air, whatever

705
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,020
in this perfect world that we exist.

706
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:03,540
Then, yes, that would sound pretty cool, but we don't live in that world yet.

707
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:06,100
But, you know, we're talking about stories of the decade and so forth.

708
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:12,100
You know, I would I would guarantee by 2029, we're going to have Internet as fast as cable

709
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:16,180
now over the air because that stuff is coming, you know, and I see that comment in chat from

710
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:19,700
She-Hulk 10, who in chat says Internet at most hotels is terrible.

711
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,340
True.

712
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:23,860
So it probably, you know, lends a little strike against that story I proposed.

713
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:27,860
But and this is another maybe thing in the column of well, maybe stadia is just a little

714
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:32,660
bit early because, again, 10 years from now or I would gather sooner than that.

715
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:37,940
But, you know, certainly in 10 years from now, 5G or maybe even whatever is after 5G

716
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:41,460
is going to be even more out there and around and so forth.

717
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:45,540
And so it's not going to matter if the Internet connection to your hotel is shit because you're

718
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:50,180
going to have a great Internet connection through the magic of the air and so forth.

719
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,780
I mean, yeah, I hope that's what ends up being at some point.

720
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:58,340
But I don't have my 5G now, so I can't really say.

721
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,220
Yeah, I know it's hard.

722
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:03,380
It's hard to see with Verizon talking about like, hey, 5G, 5G is the future.

723
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:06,500
I'm like, is it outside of the middle of Sacramento?

724
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,660
No, really.

725
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,500
Only one kind of 5G I care about.

726
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,940
And that's 5G is in my pocket.

727
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,020
And let's be real.

728
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:17,300
And I know you guys I already know the sour face that many of you are going to make when

729
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:17,700
I say it.

730
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,140
But it is the absolute truth.

731
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,900
5G doesn't matter until the Apple phone comes out that supports 5G.

732
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:25,540
Well, and also 5G doesn't matter because it doesn't work very well through walls.

733
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:27,940
And apparently it only works well if you're staying in the middle of the street.

734
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,700
So so there's still a lot of kinks.

735
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,740
There's a lot of kinks to work out.

736
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,220
Yeah.

737
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:32,340
So anyway.

738
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:33,380
Yeah.

739
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:36,900
Bobby Black Wolf says this sounds like what a lot of people were saying about steam in

740
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,020
2003.

741
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:41,700
I don't want to download DVD sized games on my 56 K modem.

742
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,020
Yeah.

743
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:48,180
Take this clip and put it in the time capsule and we'll play it on episode 1500 in 2029.

744
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:54,260
And we'll see how far the Internet's come.

745
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,020
What do you mean your show's not holographic?

746
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:56,900
What the hell is this?

747
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,100
All right.

748
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:06,180
Anyway, let's move on and talk about speaking of like consoles and new consoles.

749
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:09,860
There's a Nintendo Switch inspired console.

750
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:14,660
And by inspired, I mean it's kind of a rip off allegedly.

751
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,980
Like I'm not supposed to say it's a rip off.

752
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:17,940
It is a rip off.

753
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,540
The views and opinions expressed.

754
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:24,340
But let's just say it looks like a Switch and the logo looks a lot like a Switch.

755
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:27,380
It's kind of surprising that Nintendo hasn't shut this shit down.

756
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,820
Thanks to you guys on Discord for bringing this to my attention.

757
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:34,900
And if you want to join our Discord, just go to vognetwork.com.

758
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:37,140
VOGnetwork.com slash Discord.

759
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:42,740
And you can share stories for consideration on the show when it talks about these clone

760
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,420
systems that tend to come out.

761
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:47,620
Yeah, we get systems that look like things, but they aren't really things.

762
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:50,580
So now there is a Nannika Smich.

763
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:56,500
That sounds like a Simpsons parody of some sort, doesn't it?

764
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,620
I just need to go Nannika.

765
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:58,980
What's that?

766
00:37:58,980 --> 00:37:59,780
The Nyan Cat.

767
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,820
That's what that means.

768
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,460
Oh.

769
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,100
Nannika?

770
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:02,580
Like what?

771
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,300
The Nyan Cat.

772
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,260
So it's what Smich?

773
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,180
Like what bitch?

774
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,340
That's what this console is.

775
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,380
What bitch?

776
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:15,880
What?

777
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:22,340
It and it has a blue controller on one side and a red like the other and they look like

778
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,300
they disconnect.

779
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:23,860
They do.

780
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:27,940
Anyway, also there's a flying Mario on the front of the box.

781
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:33,220
So this is very clearly just boldly infringing on copyright.

782
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:38,100
And apparently, if you actually hook this thing up, it's just downloaded and ripped

783
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,380
ROMs as well.

784
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:39,700
Right.

785
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,740
So they actually have a little bit more details on some of the other sites here.

786
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:45,380
So I was like, where are they finding?

787
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,900
Are they finding this thing at flea markets?

788
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,340
I don't know.

789
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:51,540
But here they have like actual gameplay video of it and stuff.

790
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,020
Probably wish.

791
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,980
So like here's the description on the actual box.

792
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:57,540
So it says, you know, easy to use.

793
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:04,180
Connect the RCA cables to TV and power cable to the power or play portable mode.

794
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,500
And it says 800 games installed.

795
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:13,460
Mario Brews Bomberman against Double Dragon Adventure Island and many more.

796
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:17,380
Um, it is got a five and a half inch screen.

797
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,460
And, uh, yeah.

798
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:23,300
So basically pixel pakas with the throwback in our chat.

799
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,220
They're finding it on Soulja Boy store.

800
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:27,940
Good one.

801
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:28,980
Not yet.

802
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,500
Probably that's coming soon.

803
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,060
Yeah.

804
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:35,220
Uh, but no, basically it's like one of those, uh, emulators.

805
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:38,420
It's got their have gameplay of looks like they're playing like Pac-Man.

806
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:43,540
It looks like it's one of those multi, uh, ROM carts or whatever that's inside there.

807
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:47,620
So, but I'm saying this isn't exactly the thing you're going to find on a shelf at target.

808
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,900
Like, no, no.

809
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:54,100
God, this is clearly, this is like one of those small kiosks that sell this shady shit.

810
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,180
This was probably about four years ago.

811
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:58,740
I went to the flea market, right?

812
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,260
The huge one out in Roseville.

813
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:05,700
And I swear, like I saw at least six different boosts there that were selling.

814
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:09,540
Like it was a Nintendo 64 controller looking thing, but it plugged into your TV.

815
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,860
And it was, they were just straight up playing Super Mario Brothers on it.

816
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:16,580
I bought one of those for my friends one time for Christmas.

817
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,740
If you want to see reviews on a lot of this though,

818
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:21,860
one of my favorite channels on YouTube right now is Retro Core.

819
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:26,500
He does the battle of the ports, um, which is sometimes where I get ideas for classic game.

820
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:31,860
But, um, he also does like the, the, um, Chinese bootleg device reviews.

821
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:32,660
Like the V?

822
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,580
And they send, they send him some.

823
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:36,920
Weird.

824
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,940
But, and he's very honest about it.

825
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:44,740
He'll like, if it's a handheld that maybe connects to a TV, like has a TV tuner on it,

826
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:48,820
he'll, um, do both versions before doing it through a capture card.

827
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:51,220
And some of them are good.

828
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:57,620
You know, I still probably wouldn't buy one, but I like actually seeing the reviews of them

829
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:03,140
to see just how far the little bootleggers have come in their emulation.

830
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:08,180
So if I'm, if I'm hearing this right, this thing actually does still have the switch

831
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:10,500
concept of you can play the ROMs on the little screen

832
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,660
or you can plug it in and it goes on the TV, right?

833
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:13,460
I believe so.

834
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,780
I think, I don't know if he necessarily can, like,

835
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,620
like put in a dock and it goes to the screen.

836
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:25,140
I think it's more of you can hook up like, well, you can hook up AV cables to it and it goes into

837
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:25,460
a screen.

838
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:28,660
Oh, if there's something plugged in the, because yeah, they said that there's RCA.

839
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:29,880
Okay.

840
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,500
Not as fancy as a dock.

841
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:34,340
I see.

842
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:36,580
I mean, maybe the controllers are wireless.

843
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:42,820
Um, I mean, assume because it says four, four triple A batteries for the controllers.

844
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:47,140
Well, they call it say controls rechargeable battery for the screen and strap and power

845
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,980
cable in AVC.

846
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:51,060
So it doesn't really power very well either.

847
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:54,500
Uh, darted C and chat with a zinger saying, uh, but look at it this way.

848
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:58,420
It might have more games than Nintendo switches, online service, but I'm bummed.

849
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,580
You can definitely play more.

850
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:04,500
Accuracy, the truth, the T, uh, orange, right?

851
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,820
Says judging by most of these, it's probably 20 games.

852
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:09,220
And then it's just the games repeated over and over again.

853
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:09,940
That's what happens.

854
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:14,980
A lot of these bootleg things is that it'll be like Mario, but Mario is a different color

855
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:17,620
or Mario, but the Goomba is a penis.

856
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:19,860
And somehow it snuck its way into this collection.

857
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:25,060
So it's almost worth it if they had all those shitty bootleg ROMs in there.

858
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:29,780
Did I ever tell you about the very first ROM hack I ever saw on the internet way back in

859
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,180
college?

860
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:34,980
So there was this Japanese only title that they never released or they never released

861
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,020
it here at dark soccer.

862
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:36,660
You probably know this one.

863
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,100
It was an NES launch title.

864
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,860
It was called nuts and milk.

865
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:40,340
Yeah.

866
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:44,580
Well, I'll let you imagine what they changed it to in Japan.

867
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:48,580
That game nuts and milk were two cute little characters that, yeah.

868
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:49,700
When they did the ROM hack.

869
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:51,560
Yeah.

870
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,460
Was it butts and milk?

871
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:55,620
No, it was nuts.

872
00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:00,900
It was nuts in vag.

873
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:04,020
Anyway, let's move on.

874
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:07,940
Let's we need some Christmas cheer here and some Hanukkah spirit.

875
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:12,420
So how and some Kwanzaa, uh, I'm trying to think.

876
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:12,660
Joy.

877
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:13,700
It's joy Kwanzaa.

878
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:13,940
Okay.

879
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:17,460
Kwanzaa joy and some solstice slumber.

880
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:18,420
Cause I need a nap.

881
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,340
Solstice serenity.

882
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,300
Ah, I like that.

883
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:21,460
Okay.

884
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,260
So we need all of it.

885
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,020
The shortest day is the longest night.

886
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:26,420
We need all of it.

887
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:28,500
And by the way, review.

888
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,180
Oh, the lockers are fabulous.

889
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:30,580
Yeah.

890
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:34,260
This is the first year I've actually added stuff to the box mix.

891
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:34,740
Yeah.

892
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:37,140
The straights box mix is better than the Manischewitz.

893
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:38,020
I'm going to say it now.

894
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:42,340
When you said cheesy, I was like, Ooh, I don't know if I'm ready for all that cheese,

895
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:44,820
but it's not like they're good.

896
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:47,060
It's not like waffle house hash browns or cheese.

897
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:49,940
I picked cheese that wouldn't turn stringy melty.

898
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:52,980
It's a combination of Havarti and Manchego.

899
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:54,340
So they're potent cheeses.

900
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:58,180
You'll get the cheese flavor out of them without them being stringy and gooey.

901
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:00,580
And the sour cream is a cultured sour cream.

902
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:03,380
So it actually will be good for your tummy.

903
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:04,020
Well, that's good.

904
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:07,460
I'm not usually a big sour cream person, but this stuff is bomb though.

905
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:08,180
And it's thick.

906
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,420
Not bad for the grocery outlet.

907
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:11,380
Thick with five C's.

908
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:18,980
I was looking on AliExpress to see if they actually were selling it because that's

909
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:23,700
usually we can find this kind of crap, but no, no, no, I don't see it.

910
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:23,940
All right.

911
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:28,500
Well, meanwhile, in a festive chat, I'm going to maybe grab a couple more of these.

912
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,380
There's a few left and I made the whole box this time.

913
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:34,900
So, so how about something about Christmas?

914
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,660
God, I'm sick of Christmas music.

915
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:40,980
For the first time in three years, I have heard the Mariah apocalypse happen.

916
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:44,100
I wasn't participating in Wama Geddon because I actually fucking like that song,

917
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:48,340
but I fell prey to the, to the Mariah apocalypse three times in one day.

918
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:52,900
I heard a cover of it and that's even worse, but I actually liked the Wham song.

919
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:56,020
Anyway, there was an update to Death Stranding.

920
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:04,420
It was updated to version 1.08 for quote various performance improvements to the game,

921
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:06,100
but there's something else in there.

922
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:10,980
And this is what ties back to the mass of X is what I'm going to call it now,

923
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,340
because it makes it sound more sinister.

924
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,260
Christmas hats.

925
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:21,380
So basically, some of the members in the Bridges organization will,

926
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:25,380
will wear a Christmas hat, Santa hat.

927
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:31,860
Some of them weren't wearing them, but most of them were wearing the Santa hats.

928
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:38,580
Sam could already wear his as an unlock before this, but now it was like a weird

929
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:44,420
involved process and you had to, to rank up your connection and some other crap,

930
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:47,140
which me, I just, you know, watched the play through because

931
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:48,900
I didn't want to do the running around stuff.

932
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:53,540
But at any rate, it's a festive little update and

933
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,260
even the holograms are wearing Santa hats.

934
00:45:58,260 --> 00:45:59,780
So good job.

935
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:06,500
I don't know why that they even bothered because it kind of ruined the game atmosphere.

936
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:10,260
And why can't we have blue ones to emulate Hanukkah Harry?

937
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,460
I'm just saying I remember the SNL sketch.

938
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:14,900
That's it.

939
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:16,500
All right.

940
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:20,740
I did get the patch, but I played a little bit of Death Stranding, but like,

941
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:22,660
I did like one quest in Death Stranding.

942
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:27,460
That was the most I played this week, but I did not notice a Santa upgrade

943
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:28,500
or whatever you want to call it.

944
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:31,540
So I must be talking to one of the guys that doesn't have one.

945
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:33,860
So they're not everywhere.

946
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:35,540
All right, moving on.

947
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:37,140
Is there Jeff Keighley in a Santa hat?

948
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:38,260
Is that something I don't know?

949
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:42,340
I have to run over to that checkpoint and look, because apparently the Jeff Keighley checkpoint,

950
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:43,940
it is one of the earlier ones in the game.

951
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:46,580
So you know which one annoyed the shit out of me though?

952
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:49,220
The Conan one, because you know who annoys the shit out of me?

953
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:49,860
Conan.

954
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:51,380
I haven't found him yet.

955
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:53,540
So pan, no, Otter hat.

956
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:54,660
That's it.

957
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:55,220
Otter hat.

958
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:56,100
That's all I'm gonna say.

959
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,940
All right, moving on.

960
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:58,440
Loki.

961
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:04,340
So there was a, this is talking about like news of the decade, but there was a prototype

962
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:10,820
of the PlayStation Super Nintendo crossover type thing that they were going to be.

963
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:13,940
Like the one that Ben Heck did the work on?

964
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:14,740
I believe so.

965
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:18,260
This is the Nintendo PlayStation, that prototype.

966
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:25,700
Well, they are now going to be auctioning it off for, I believe, charity.

967
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:30,660
So basically they said, I can't keep losing.

968
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:32,660
Oh, maybe not for charity.

969
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:36,260
So charity of paying my rent.

970
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:42,820
So the owner of the console right now, Terry Diebold, he apparently keeps losing money.

971
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:48,100
He says he put a lot of work into it by traveling with it and has made nothing on it.

972
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:51,860
Every trip that he's taken has cost money out of pocket.

973
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:58,900
He says the bills itself, he says that he's the world's largest collectibles auctioneer

974
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:00,420
or heritage, I guess is going to be.

975
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:06,500
So they're going to start selling, or start selling this, I guess, next year.

976
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:10,020
They have it already on auction, I believe, at least previewed.

977
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,820
And I don't know what he's looking to make for it.

978
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:20,340
But apparently the online auction will begin February 27th and will not have a reserve

979
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:21,140
price.

980
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:27,460
So dump as much money as you want into this thing that I don't believe plays anything.

981
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:29,860
And you can't play anything with it.

982
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:37,780
So really the only reason to have this is if you are one of those that has the biggest

983
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:42,900
collection of collections, or maybe a museum or something like that, or you're a tech

984
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:45,300
person that wants to take it apart and see if you can.

985
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:47,060
But again, there's no game.

986
00:48:47,060 --> 00:48:48,660
There's no games like built into it or anything.

987
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,580
So you're just not going to get to play anything.

988
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:54,740
There was a BIOS disk and a couple of ROMs floating around.

989
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:57,540
And I watched the whole rebuild with Ben Heck.

990
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:58,900
It was actually pretty cool.

991
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,900
And he got things working on it.

992
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:05,140
So now they're out there public to burn off whatever game.

993
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:06,740
So I don't know.

994
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:10,340
I would not pay money for this, but I know that people would.

995
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:16,740
And active says you can only play Super Nintendo games if I recall correctly, probably.

996
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:18,660
But here's the other side of that.

997
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:21,700
Like if you buy a system like this, you shouldn't be playing anything on it.

998
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:24,660
Like you don't want to ruin it by actually using it to play games.

999
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:25,060
I know.

1000
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:26,260
Doesn't that sound weird?

1001
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:30,260
But the reality is, if it's the only one out there, like you don't want to do anything

1002
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:34,180
that would you would you would put it in a box and just let it sit there.

1003
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:36,580
You know who ought to outbid everybody and buy it?

1004
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:37,220
Nintendo.

1005
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:43,700
Wouldn't that be a gag if Nintendo bought it and just put it in their store in a glass

1006
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:44,740
case or something?

1007
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:46,180
Or why would you want to know?

1008
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:47,060
Throw it away.

1009
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:48,580
Put it in the incinerator.

1010
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:50,660
That's that's what I would that's what I would.

1011
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:53,940
What they're going to do is they're going to put it in a crate and it's going to end

1012
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:57,220
up in the warehouse, just like at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark.

1013
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:01,220
Bobby Bockel says this should be in a museum, not in a collector's basement.

1014
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:04,820
I agree, but it's going to be up to a museum to pay that kind of money for it.

1015
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:05,380
I just don't know.

1016
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:09,220
Like what kind of like public museums would this fit in at?

1017
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:09,620
I don't know.

1018
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:10,100
It doesn't.

1019
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:17,700
The official the O2 Moi, the official gaming museum or whatever the hell that there's a

1020
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:22,180
call of fame, the official Hall of Fame of Games or some shit that there's another one

1021
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:22,740
in New York.

1022
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:24,180
The middle of fucking nowhere.

1023
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:27,620
That one that inducts the five games every year into the video game Hall of Fame.

1024
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:28,660
That's out in New York somewhere.

1025
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:29,300
That's not New York.

1026
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:31,220
I thought that was the one that was in the middle of fucking nowhere.

1027
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:34,900
No, no different.

1028
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:37,540
Oh, Bobby Bockel says the maid in Oakland.

1029
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:37,940
That's right.

1030
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:39,140
I've even been to that place.

1031
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:42,340
But you know why?

1032
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:46,420
When I went, there was a special event going on, so I didn't see what the place normally

1033
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:46,900
looks like.

1034
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:49,780
And honestly, I thought it was like a store type of thing.

1035
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:54,020
But now that you say that, oh, yeah, that place is a museum usually when there's not

1036
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,300
an event going on at it.

1037
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:58,820
So and Bobby says the Computer Museum of America in Atlanta.

1038
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:03,460
Yeah, Bobby brings up Frank Cifaldi's Preservation Society.

1039
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,620
That's where my brain went too.

1040
00:51:05,620 --> 00:51:10,260
But they're going to need the money to compete with those basement investors.

1041
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:16,420
So hopefully they've got a shadow donor willing to pony up the money to let it go there if

1042
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:17,380
that's what's going to do that.

1043
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:18,980
So be interesting.

1044
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:22,420
So anyway, Orange Right says twist.

1045
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:23,540
Sony buys it.

1046
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:25,700
Pod culture suggests Jamie's vault.

1047
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:30,740
Well, she would probably have to sell all of the pinball machines and then some.

1048
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:33,380
And I don't know if they're willing to do that for a date.

1049
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:34,500
I'll be honest.

1050
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:41,860
I wouldn't be excited about having it, especially since I mean, it would be cool, but it would

1051
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:44,420
be like that little pong machine that I picked up.

1052
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:45,460
Yeah, older.

1053
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:48,900
Well, it's not older than me, but it would just be sitting in my vault.

1054
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:50,740
With no, nothing I can do with it.

1055
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:51,060
Yeah.

1056
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:56,260
And as much as we tease you about the vault, like you and Dan do, like you'll go in, you

1057
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:59,780
know, well, the vaults kind of morphed a little bit because it was at your old house where

1058
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:01,860
you actually have to break out the Saturn and play Christmas nights.

1059
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:02,900
But that's the thing.

1060
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:05,940
You guys will actually like go in there and be like, I want to play this.

1061
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:09,860
And then it's like, you know, so you actually are like, it's like walking into your own

1062
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,660
little used game store and pulling in what you want to play.

1063
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:14,660
And I just have a bug to play this game this week.

1064
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:16,020
It's not owning things to own.

1065
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:20,020
Especially the reason why we have overdrives now so that we don't actually have to hunt

1066
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:25,940
down where the fuck we put the cartridge or, you know, this memory card that has this thing

1067
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:31,860
on it or like, well, and we can also play some of the super CD games because like for

1068
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:35,940
the turbo graphics, because I don't have an arcade card and I don't have the CD unit

1069
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:37,220
for my core graphics.

1070
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:39,220
If I had a duo RX, then shoot.

1071
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:40,180
Yeah, that'd be fine.

1072
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:43,380
I don't know who out there would be willing to spend 200 bucks on me, but.

1073
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:44,580
Hint, hint.

1074
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:49,540
But I'm just at any rate, I mean, I've been trying to find the CD add on for the core

1075
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:55,620
graphics, and I really haven't been able to because we so we just now I mean, that's why

1076
00:52:55,620 --> 00:53:01,140
we're looking forward to that a turbo graphics mini because we're on the preorder for it.

1077
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:01,940
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

1078
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:02,740
I preordered that.

1079
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:06,020
And that's not even out till what, like March or something, something like that.

1080
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:07,700
But yet another thing in March.

1081
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:12,260
But it's going to have the the super graphics version of it.

1082
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:13,860
Was it Daimakamura or Chomakamura?

1083
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:15,940
No, Chomakamura was SNES.

1084
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:21,300
So it's going to be Daimakamura as in ghosts and goblins.

1085
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:24,500
I always get the mix around which one was first, ghouls and ghosts or ghosts and goblins.

1086
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:28,180
So I just always call it by the Japanese name because it's easier for me to remember.

1087
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:34,260
But you know, it's going to have some of the super graphics games on there.

1088
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:36,020
But I mean, back in the long run, though.

1089
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:38,580
It would be a nice thing.

1090
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:39,220
I'll put it that way.

1091
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:42,420
It would be nice to have that system.

1092
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:46,420
It would be a little slice of unique gaming history that no one else has.

1093
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:48,180
But that's all it is.

1094
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:51,540
What good would something like that do in my closet?

1095
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:58,100
When other people could be looking at it were, I mean, hell, I could if I had it,

1096
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:03,940
I would probably have it reverse engineered and rebuilt, you know, and marketed or something,

1097
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:07,460
or I mean, not really marketed, but like make them for other people.

1098
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:08,260
That would be cool.

1099
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:11,940
You know, have them, you know, do like the pachinko thing where you take your little

1100
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:14,420
pachinko balls to the store next door and get your prize.

1101
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:15,860
So I wouldn't actually be selling it.

1102
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:18,100
I would just be getting prizes that I can trade for money.

1103
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:20,020
I see.

1104
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:23,220
If it's good enough for Japan is good enough for me.

1105
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:25,240
All right.

1106
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:29,060
Well, regardless, no one in this room will be picking up the Nintendo PlayStation,

1107
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:29,620
that's for sure.

1108
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:32,420
But it will be very interesting to see how that all plays out.

1109
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:38,260
And if it does go to museum or the purchaser has chosen to keep their information private,

1110
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:39,700
which sometimes happens.

1111
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:41,540
So, but, you know, it's interesting, though.

1112
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:45,860
Like, the reason why my mind keeps going to museums is that sometimes that rock and roll

1113
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:47,300
paraphernalia gets sold.

1114
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:50,340
You know who buys that stuff sometimes is Hard Rock Cafe.

1115
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:54,260
And so they send them to Hard Rock hotels and cafes around.

1116
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:56,020
I wouldn't want that to happen to it.

1117
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:58,580
Well, at least you can kind of go see it.

1118
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:01,620
Although, I told you about the Vegas story, right?

1119
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:04,500
I was in Vegas when we went to go see the Gwen Stefani show.

1120
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:06,180
So me and Miss Melody were in Vegas.

1121
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:10,180
And we were trying to find the Jerry.

1122
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:13,460
Her name is now Jerry Horner, but it was Jerry Halliwell.

1123
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:16,580
We were trying to find her dress because her infamous British dress.

1124
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:21,860
I saw it at that Vegas casino about during those years ago.

1125
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,340
It was during the 25th anniversary of Rocky Horror Convention.

1126
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:25,780
So I saw it there during then.

1127
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,140
So we were looking around for it.

1128
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:29,780
Well, as it turns out, it's no longer there.

1129
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:32,020
They moved it out of that casino.

1130
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:32,980
That's the thing that annoys me.

1131
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:37,460
I was like, well, you know, if you're gonna have all this stuff, put it on display somewhere.

1132
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:41,300
But we did get to see shoes that Britney Spears wore in the toxic video.

1133
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:42,020
So that was cool.

1134
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:43,080
Okay.

1135
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:47,220
None of that type of thing.

1136
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:48,900
Well, I like seeing the instruments.

1137
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:53,220
Like seeing, you know, Lemmy's bass, for example.

1138
00:55:54,260 --> 00:56:00,180
Seeing, you know, just because especially when you look and see like finger marks and,

1139
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:02,580
you know, grooves that were cut on, you know, different things.

1140
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:05,060
That gives me a little bit more other than, oh, these are shoes.

1141
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:05,460
Look.

1142
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:06,900
Oh, my God, Britney's shoes.

1143
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:10,820
Some people take a trip to the Holy Land because they want to see where

1144
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:13,940
religious people in the past walked and did things.

1145
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:16,740
If I want to go see Britney's shoes, that's my religion.

1146
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:17,240
Okay.

1147
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:21,140
That was, yeah, except yours isn't tax exempt.

1148
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:28,180
Then again, you did hear about the Satanic Temple becoming federally recognized.

1149
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:29,300
Oh, no, I have not.

1150
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:31,700
I would have thought that already happened.

1151
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:35,300
It's actually, it's like one particular aspect.

1152
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:39,860
It's like they finally went for full recognition or something and got their tax exempt status.

1153
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:46,100
And then now they say they voluntarily pay taxes because they're trying to,

1154
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:50,980
I mean, honestly, they've been better quality humans than the Southern Baptist Convention.

1155
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:51,700
And I'll leave it at that.

1156
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:54,580
Do they still have that statue of Baphomet?

1157
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:55,080
Yeah.

1158
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:58,260
I always thought that was the most hilarious story.

1159
00:56:58,260 --> 00:56:58,820
I'm sorry.

1160
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:00,600
Anyway.

1161
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:01,460
All right.

1162
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:02,100
Moving on.

1163
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:06,660
Let's talk about, oh, let's talk about another type of religion for some people.

1164
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:08,260
Fantasy Star Online.

1165
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:11,860
Lord knows I've lost many, many hours to Fantasy Star.

1166
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:13,220
Well, guess what?

1167
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:16,980
You were going to have the chance soon to play Fantasy Star Online 2,

1168
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:21,220
which granted, it did change some stuff from the original, but I still want to check it out.

1169
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:22,680
Yes.

1170
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:25,300
I could check it out.

1171
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:28,740
I could, you know, do all that stuff with the patches and all that stuff.

1172
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:29,620
I don't want to.

1173
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:31,620
I want Sega to support it in America.

1174
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:34,740
And finally, as we found out at E3, they're going to be.

1175
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:37,540
And so there is a beta test coming out.

1176
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:41,140
So there is right now a closed Xbox One beta test,

1177
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:43,140
which is why Jamie's mad because she doesn't have an Xbox One,

1178
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:45,940
that will be happening in early February.

1179
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:50,580
You can sign up now through the Insider app on your Xbox One.

1180
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:54,100
So if you are an Xbox Insider, which is like, I think,

1181
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:56,980
I don't remember if you signed up on the website to download a special app,

1182
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:59,780
or if you just have to download the app from the marketplace.

1183
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:02,420
But I know it's called the Xbox Insider hub.

1184
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:03,300
So look for that.

1185
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:07,220
And that allows you to like, look at like, if you want to look at betas of hardware,

1186
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:10,580
upgrade updates and things like that, you can get all that through the program too.

1187
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:13,460
And then they have surveys and things that you can answer

1188
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:15,140
and you get little points and you level up.

1189
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:15,640
It's cute.

1190
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:18,820
So anyway, I don't know about you guys,

1191
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:20,980
but if you haven't turned on your Xbox One in a while,

1192
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:24,980
you might want to do that so you can get on this stress test, if you will,

1193
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:26,900
for Phantasy Star Online 2.

1194
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:29,060
And again, that's going to be happening in February.

1195
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:30,820
I don't know when this closes,

1196
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:34,900
but I would get on that sooner rather than later.

1197
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:38,340
Now, Dark Sakura, you won't be left out forever.

1198
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:41,780
There will be a Windows 10 version that launches later in 2020.

1199
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:44,340
Although I know you're at war with your PC right now,

1200
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:47,060
but maybe later in 2020, that will resolve itself

1201
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:50,420
by the time Phantasy Star Online 2 becomes available.

1202
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:52,260
So excited.

1203
00:58:52,260 --> 00:58:57,060
I hope I get in and I hope there's not a lot of NDAs.

1204
00:58:57,060 --> 00:58:58,980
I hope we are able to live stream it.

1205
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:00,180
But if we can't, we can't.

1206
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:04,100
I just missed my mags that I had in the first PSO because I had my Oppa Oppa.

1207
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:06,660
The Oppa Oppa was my favorite because I fucking love Phantasy Zone,

1208
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:08,500
but I did also have a Sega Master System.

1209
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:13,540
Well, you know, Mr. VG Realness, Delvin and myself,

1210
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:16,100
we jumped into the wonderful world of pirate servers

1211
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:17,460
from Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst

1212
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:19,860
because we were streaming for a little bit and that was a lot of fun.

1213
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:22,340
So I think it was called like Afinia or something like that.

1214
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:24,420
I played PSO 2 for a long time though.

1215
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:27,300
Just Google Phantasy Star Online private server

1216
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:28,740
and it's the first result that comes up.

1217
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:34,740
And there's still quite a few people that are rocking on that platform.

1218
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:36,260
So it's very cool.

1219
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:37,780
So, all right.

1220
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:41,700
Dr. Su says that reminds me, did you all drop off of Blue Burst?

1221
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:46,660
I'm not actively playing Blue Burst, but forever in my heart.

1222
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:49,780
And honestly, if Delvin were to text me one day and be like,

1223
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:53,060
yo, bitch, let's do a stream, I'd probably be down.

1224
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:55,620
So, because I had a lot of fun doing those Blue Burst streams.

1225
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:56,580
So I'd probably do it again.

1226
00:59:57,700 --> 00:59:58,180
All right.

1227
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:03,380
Questbuster talking about PSO 2 saying the cosmetics in PSO 2 are pretty insane.

1228
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:07,220
People were running around in so many tie-ins like Attack from Titan gear.

1229
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:09,540
Well, PSO 2 was a free MMO.

1230
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:12,260
So there are going to be a lot of commercial spots and things like that.

1231
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:14,500
I don't think they're going to suddenly charge for it here.

1232
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:15,380
It's really hard.

1233
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:21,300
There's only essentially, I think like three premium MMOs left in the US.

1234
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:24,020
That would be World of Warcraft, of course.

1235
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:27,460
Final Fantasy XIV, I guess 11 as well.

1236
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:28,420
I guess you could bundle into that.

1237
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:31,220
But the other one that's coming to mind, isn't EverQuest still a monthly payer?

1238
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:33,300
Or did they finally take EverQuest free to play?

1239
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:34,500
I don't remember.

1240
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,500
I don't know, but I have a friend who's playing EverQuest.

1241
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:39,220
Like the, when they brought back the OG server.

1242
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:39,860
Bobby would know.

1243
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:41,460
I'm just waiting for the delay because he'll know.

1244
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:44,100
Cause I know he was on the EverQuest bandwagon for a long time.

1245
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:46,740
So I can't remember if they finally went for it.

1246
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:50,900
I know EverQuest 2 didn't take off the way they hoped it would.

1247
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:58,180
So, but yeah, having a premium like month to month pay MMO is a hard thing to do now

1248
01:00:58,180 --> 01:00:59,140
in this day and age.

1249
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:01,780
Like they tried it with Star Wars.

1250
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:05,940
I almost said, oh, sorry, Bobby.

1251
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:09,700
Is EverQuest something you still pay a monthly fee for or did it finally go free to play?

1252
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:15,220
Um, and what was the Star Wars MMO that I can't, I keep wanting to say The Force Awakens,

1253
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:16,260
but no, that was the movie.

1254
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:18,180
Um, what was the Star Wars MMO called?

1255
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:21,220
The Metal Mayhem says, uh, God, I almost said ElfQuest.

1256
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:24,020
EverQuest is free to play now.

1257
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:24,340
Okay.

1258
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:26,500
You know why I have ElfQuest on my mind?

1259
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:29,540
I found my ElfQuest graphic novels from like the eighties.

1260
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:30,180
Oh, that's funny.

1261
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:31,140
I love ElfQuest.

1262
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:31,380
Yeah.

1263
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:37,540
So anyway, um, so yeah, that means like as far as premium MMOs go, there's only Final

1264
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:41,860
Fantasies and World of Warcraft are still able to get away with charging a monthly fee.

1265
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:44,500
That's really the older public, the older public.

1266
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:45,140
Thank you.

1267
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:49,460
The older public celebrated eight years this past night to the older public.

1268
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:50,500
I had a friend that worked on that.

1269
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:52,580
She used to call it Scrotor.

1270
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:57,540
That's how I got into the, uh, uh, the Skywalker ranch.

1271
01:01:57,540 --> 01:02:01,460
But that was, that was a fun little Krista worked for Lucas arts.

1272
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:02,180
Yeah.

1273
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:06,180
But that was a fun little, uh, side adventure, you know, uh, game.

1274
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:08,500
And it, you know, had a lot of the BioWare traits in it.

1275
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:13,300
I love that you could play like a bad Jedi or a good Sith.

1276
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:14,500
Like, I really loved that.

1277
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:16,020
That was like an option that you could do.

1278
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:21,300
I would just want to do full on grade Jedi or gray force user, whatever.

1279
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:26,740
Uh, and Bobby is saying, okay, so it's free to play, but it has premium subs, but the

1280
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:28,420
sub is daybreak all access.

1281
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:31,940
So it's EverQuest, EverQuest 2, DC Universe online and Planetside 2.

1282
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:34,100
So it's like all these MMOs in one basically.

1283
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:35,540
So that's kind of interesting.

1284
01:02:35,540 --> 01:02:38,180
So, and, uh, Bobby's saying I enjoyed SWTOR.

1285
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:40,740
The Jedi Knight storyline was KOTOR 3 to me.

1286
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:43,060
Yeah, I've heard that feedback before too.

1287
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:43,780
So anyway.

1288
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:44,900
All right.

1289
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:47,780
That World of MMOs, but Phantasy Star Online 2, that'll be a free one.

1290
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:48,340
So that's good.

1291
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:49,540
All right.

1292
01:02:49,540 --> 01:02:50,260
Moving on.

1293
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:55,380
Uh, Dark Sakura, some more details on, uh, we have, we're having a Microsoft Knight tonight

1294
01:02:55,380 --> 01:02:55,780
apparently.

1295
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:58,340
I guess so, but this one actually makes me really happy.

1296
01:02:58,340 --> 01:03:00,740
I love to see people doing things right.

1297
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:08,260
So, um, Microsoft has announced a, uh, their lead character in Tell Me Why is going to

1298
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:10,340
be trans, transgender.

1299
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:17,540
The main character is a man named Tyler Ronan, um, who is, I guess, I mean, it doesn't say

1300
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:20,100
anything about, you know, where he is on his thing.

1301
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:21,860
And that would be, of course, be a personal decision.

1302
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:25,700
It's not something that should matter about the character, just that he is a transgender

1303
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:26,200
man.

1304
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:34,840
And, um, one of the quotes from Liam, uh, who is, uh, the game director for Liam is

1305
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:37,800
that, um, the goal is not to have an agenda.

1306
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:42,200
We develop characters and stories because we believe in their value and in giving experience

1307
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:42,760
to players.

1308
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:48,120
Um, and then later on saying that Tyler is a young man with great values, good and bad

1309
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:50,200
elements, and that's what makes him human.

1310
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:58,520
And I really, I really like, um, that they put a lot of, uh, um, attention into the voice

1311
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:05,640
actor to find someone who would sound authentic, um, and into making it just what I'm thinking

1312
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:06,280
of.

1313
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:11,080
I hate to phrase it this way because honestly, this is what I wish any sexual orientation,

1314
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:14,760
any gender, anything like that would be is that it's just a thing.

1315
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:16,440
It's a normal thing.

1316
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:22,120
It doesn't need to be made special light of because it's an intrinsic part of this person.

1317
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:24,680
It's special because it belongs to this character.

1318
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:27,080
It's special because the person is special.

1319
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:31,880
And I'm not saying ignore somebody's experiences, but at the same time, I would just like it

1320
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:35,000
to be, oh, like, oh, you, you have brown hair.

1321
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:35,720
Oh, you're gay.

1322
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:39,880
Oh, you're, you're a trans woman, you know?

1323
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:45,560
And so I hope that they take that approach in the game instead of making it.

1324
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:49,640
I want to see the struggles highlighted, but at the same time, I'd also like it to be

1325
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:51,320
that normal part of who that person is.

1326
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:57,880
And I'm, I'm going to just say this because, you know, there's people out there that are

1327
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:00,600
going to pose this question, why does it matter?

1328
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:04,840
And I'm not saying I'm asking that question, but I want to just entertain that because,

1329
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:08,040
you know, there's going to be people out there that are going to say, why does it matter?

1330
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:12,760
Why does it matter that, why do, why, why do we have this trans agenda shoved in our

1331
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:13,400
face?

1332
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:16,680
Because I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but you know it, there's, it's out there on the Twitter's

1333
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:17,400
ease and that stuff.

1334
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:24,760
So, but in my, my kind of opinion, the fact that that would be out there is kind of exactly

1335
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:26,680
why there needs to be something like this.

1336
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:29,720
It's kind of like one of those, well, if that's the question you have, play the game.

1337
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:30,280
Exactly.

1338
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:36,760
And the way I feel about it now is, and now keep in mind this normalization, that's going

1339
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:37,320
to be down the line.

1340
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:37,880
That's not now.

1341
01:05:37,880 --> 01:05:40,520
Representation now absolutely matters.

1342
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:44,680
It is something that needs to be brought attention to, but I don't want it to be treated

1343
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:49,080
as in this is this only, this only reason to right to exist.

1344
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:54,440
I want it to be a fully realized person who happens to be trans and that his experience

1345
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:57,400
as a trans man plays into who he is as a person.

1346
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:01,560
Not necessarily just I'm going through everything that all trans people in the universe are

1347
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:01,880
going through.

1348
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:03,640
No, his experience is going to be different.

1349
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:05,560
My, my friend's experiences are different.

1350
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:08,760
Everybody's experience is different and I want it to be kind of like that.

1351
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:12,280
The representation though abso-fucking-lutely matters.

1352
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:19,320
And I think to add to that point as well, you know, when there was a trans character

1353
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:25,960
in Mass Effect Andromeda, that character took a lot of criticism because it didn't act like

1354
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:29,000
a trans person or that I was the trench.

1355
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:29,500
Okay.

1356
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:34,920
The trans woman did not act like a trans dead named herself.

1357
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:35,880
Exactly.

1358
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:40,920
And that's like, no, like if you ever meet a trans person, they're not going to say,

1359
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:41,480
what was the line?

1360
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:43,960
I'm trying to think of the line that she said, but she said like something.

1361
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:46,360
When I registered, it was, is the name blah.

1362
01:06:46,360 --> 01:06:46,920
Yeah, exactly.

1363
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:47,400
Something like that.

1364
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:52,360
And it's like, okay, no trans person would actually say that within 60 seconds of meeting

1365
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:52,760
you.

1366
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:55,720
That is not like no one's fucking business.

1367
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:55,960
Yeah.

1368
01:06:55,960 --> 01:07:01,720
Most trans people would probably, at least any that I I've known, like only if I knew

1369
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:04,040
them before they transition, do I know.

1370
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:05,560
Yeah.

1371
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:07,960
You know, those details.

1372
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:09,480
Otherwise it's not my business.

1373
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:10,120
You know what I mean?

1374
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:14,920
Well, and it's what, what I do for myself whenever I have a friend transitions.

1375
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:20,040
And actually I have a few friends now that I do not remember their names beforehand because

1376
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:25,640
I give myself a year, I change their contact card on my phone and then I put a parenthesis

1377
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:31,160
with the first initial of their dead name to give myself six months so that the name

1378
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:32,680
is fully associated with them.

1379
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:37,800
Then I remove the initial and in a lot of cases I even have to sit and think about what

1380
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:38,920
was their dead name.

1381
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:42,600
And I don't do that because that's disrespectful to the journey they're going through.

1382
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:45,640
Yes, that name, that person is a part of who they are.

1383
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:49,560
Forgetting it erases a part of who they were, their experiences.

1384
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:56,040
But at the same time, no trans person out there is going to say, Oh, well, you know,

1385
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:58,440
I was Julia before and now I'm Jack.

1386
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:00,520
They're not going to do that.

1387
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:02,280
They're just going to say, Hey, I'm Jack, what's up?

1388
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:05,800
That's all it's going to be because that is who they are now.

1389
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:07,400
You don't need to know who they were.

1390
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:09,720
You need to appreciate the person that who they were made.

1391
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:12,040
So anyway, sorry.

1392
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:13,400
No, no, it's important.

1393
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:16,200
And I think brings insight to the question, why does it matter?

1394
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:19,400
Because, you know, you know, that's what's on social media right now.

1395
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:24,200
And I know we shouldn't have to go down that road, but I had to because somebody out there

1396
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:25,080
might be wondering.

1397
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:30,360
Is that said that Mattel came out with trans dolls and I'm just going through my brain

1398
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:31,880
trying to figure out how that works.

1399
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:39,720
Like, because, I mean, I know that trans people are more than their genitals, but the

1400
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:44,840
dolls have no representation like that other than maybe having boobs or, you know, being

1401
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:47,000
built in a particular way.

1402
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:50,840
So I don't know how that would happen unless it's just like in their back story.

1403
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:53,160
Dolls don't have genitals or that sort of thing.

1404
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:57,160
I mean, everybody's undressed a Barbie in a can back in the day and you found nothing.

1405
01:08:57,160 --> 01:09:03,240
So now this is what I'm wondering is how they would represent trans characters in a

1406
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:03,740
Barbie doll.

1407
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:07,400
If there's something different about the body mold or something.

1408
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:08,280
I have to look that up.

1409
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:09,640
That's actually very fascinating.

1410
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:10,200
All right.

1411
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:12,920
Well, in the meantime, we aren't a doll podcast.

1412
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:13,800
We're a video game podcast.

1413
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:14,440
We're gonna move on.

1414
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:14,940
Thank God.

1415
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:17,720
I'm at the wrong show.

1416
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:21,160
Well, dolls could include Legos as like an extension.

1417
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:21,960
That's not a doll.

1418
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:26,840
Sia Tabiri says they may have been gender neutral with options to dress up as more

1419
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:28,120
male or more female.

1420
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:28,600
Okay.

1421
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:29,080
With wit.

1422
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:29,320
Yeah.

1423
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:29,560
Okay.

1424
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:31,400
I did actually, I think I did see that.

1425
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:32,440
And so that makes sense to me.

1426
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:34,120
Okay, cool.

1427
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:34,840
All right.

1428
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:39,160
Anyhow, let's move on and talk about, uh, we'll talk, we'll talk about while we talk

1429
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:40,280
about cars.

1430
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:40,680
Yeah.

1431
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:41,640
We'll talk about cars.

1432
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:42,200
Loki.

1433
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:42,360
Yeah.

1434
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:43,800
Let's think about the manly games.

1435
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:45,000
We could play our cars.

1436
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,280
Like, let's talk about cars.

1437
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:47,480
Like Stardew Valley.

1438
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:49,420
Yeah.

1439
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:51,000
Manly.

1440
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,360
On my fucking Tesla.

1441
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:54,680
Romancing farming.

1442
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:03,560
But yes, apparently, apparently part of the, uh, holiday software update.

1443
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:06,760
Tesla owners are getting a Stardew Valley port.

1444
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:13,960
Not all, not all to hashtag, not all Tesla because, uh, they certain depends on what

1445
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:17,960
your, what version of software or your car basically and what it can run.

1446
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:23,320
Just like, you know, we were just talking about, um, iPads and when they, they, they

1447
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:25,560
no longer will play the latest and greatest stuff.

1448
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:25,960
Sorry.

1449
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:27,800
Your car can't play Stardew Valley.

1450
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:32,360
Bobby is pointing out that, uh, not on my Tesla, LOL early adopter.

1451
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:36,040
Tesla's built after 2018, we'll get Stardew Valley.

1452
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:38,520
So it has to be a, uh, a newer,

1453
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:39,000
Darn.

1454
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,120
I mean, or Tesla.

1455
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:43,960
So the play that if you, you know, I remember when this game came out, but like.

1456
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,320
But will the James Bond truck played this?

1457
01:10:48,200 --> 01:10:51,880
Probably, you know, but we always, you know.

1458
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:52,200
Okay.

1459
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:58,280
So I, some, I feel like in some ways this whole like games on a Tesla becomes this joke

1460
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:03,320
of like Linux on a toaster, but which has happened, of course it's happened, but there

1461
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:07,000
is some, like, there is like reasons why this exists.

1462
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:12,600
Well, they also have a, with the full self-driving sneak preview is coming as well.

1463
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:15,000
So you're gonna have to do something while your car is driving you somewhere.

1464
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:18,280
Granted, we're not quite there yet.

1465
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:21,720
I think we're, we're going to have cars driving themselves.

1466
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:24,440
I mean, yeah, they do have some self-driving cars.

1467
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:27,560
I just wouldn't trust it with the people, especially with the people I've been driving

1468
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:28,120
around today.

1469
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:30,120
I would not trust it.

1470
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:32,120
Um, cause people be stupid.

1471
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:35,000
So another, you trust your car, you don't trust other people's cars.

1472
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:36,520
I correct.

1473
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:37,020
Okay.

1474
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:40,440
It's just, yeah, people are dumb.

1475
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:44,840
Um, and Bobby, and this is of course very clear is that, and I didn't get to make this

1476
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:48,680
point yet because we went on tangent, but, um, the games don't work when you're driving.

1477
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:51,800
So you don't get to play Stardew Valley while you're driving, not even your passenger.

1478
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:53,080
It doesn't work that way.

1479
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:53,640
Okay.

1480
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:57,560
But what it's for is, and in my mind, while you're super charging, you're super charging.

1481
01:11:57,560 --> 01:11:58,200
Exactly.

1482
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:00,920
And you might think, well, doesn't that defeat the purpose of charging to be wearing down

1483
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:02,120
the battery playing a game?

1484
01:12:02,120 --> 01:12:03,800
It's it's charging there.

1485
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:07,560
It's charging a lot faster than you're using it of the little bit of power to play a game.

1486
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:12,600
So, uh, and yeah, that's, that is a real thing about, you know, Tesla ownership or any type

1487
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:16,600
of all electric vehicle really is that, you know, you're going to have to, the way you

1488
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:18,440
fuel up is different.

1489
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:22,760
You know, if you're taking a big trip and again, you know, cheap plug for our own YouTube

1490
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:28,040
channel at VoG network, I don't pimp the YouTube very much, but here's a very real application

1491
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:33,480
there because Bobby has a couple of road trip videos from his own Tesla experiences where

1492
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:38,280
he kind of talks about how they stopped to supercharge at certain places while he's going

1493
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:42,840
on these very long road trips, such as when he went from Atlanta to Washington, DC for

1494
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:44,920
magfest is one video that comes to mind.

1495
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:48,440
And he, you know, showed like how that path all worked and all that stuff.

1496
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:55,000
So, um, you know, for now, that's why a lot of superchargers are at malls and big travel

1497
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,920
stops and places with things to do.

1498
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:59,880
So that way it's like, can get now stretching my legs.

1499
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:04,920
It's not just like 20 minutes to, you know, fuel up, get a big gulp and go, you know,

1500
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:10,200
you have to charge from sometimes for about what is about 45 minutes, depends on how many

1501
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:11,320
miles you're trying to go.

1502
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:12,920
So that's why these things are here.

1503
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:16,200
But this gives you something to do to kind of pass the time.

1504
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:19,240
If maybe like you get back to the car and you find, oh, there's still seven minutes

1505
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:19,560
to go.

1506
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:24,280
I'll just sit here and diddle daddle on a game while I wait for my car to top off.

1507
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:25,800
And then I'm going to get back on the road.

1508
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:28,120
It's a little bit, a little bit of a different way of thinking.

1509
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:33,480
So anyway, um, Bobby says, oh, those videos took way too much work for the little amount

1510
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:34,520
of views we were getting.

1511
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:36,520
Bobby, that's why I pimped them right now.

1512
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:38,680
Put them out there right now.

1513
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:44,040
You should, you should put them on the Twitch channel, but like put them in the archive.

1514
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:51,080
Why don't we take the whole blizzard approach of this and don't you guys have phones?

1515
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:54,760
I mean, isn't that what cell phones are for?

1516
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:59,240
Yeah, but have you ever, have you ever ridden into Tesla?

1517
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:02,440
No, those, those screens are real nice.

1518
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:06,600
Like I, the, the, with the first time Bobby Blackwolf picked me up at the airport, we

1519
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:07,320
were going to dragon con.

1520
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:09,720
I got to ride, actually, I don't think it was an airport trip the very first time.

1521
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:13,080
I can't remember, but the very first time I was in his Tesla, I was like, this thing's

1522
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:14,040
like a fucking spaceship.

1523
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:14,920
This is cool.

1524
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:20,360
Like it's like, there's a lot of stuff in there that's not in cars normally, but instead

1525
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:25,080
it's like world's largest iPad is the whole like console type of thing.

1526
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:26,360
And it was just, it was cool.

1527
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:29,640
It was very different, but yeah, you kind of look around and you go, I feel like there's

1528
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:31,880
things missing in this car, but there are.

1529
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:34,840
That thing Missy was Stardew Valley.

1530
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:37,240
No, like an engine.

1531
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:42,120
Like, it's just like, again, like the whole, the frunk, as he calls it, there's, there's

1532
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:44,200
nothing in the front part of the car.

1533
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:46,520
Cause they have all the important stuffs underneath.

1534
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:47,800
So this is interesting.

1535
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:49,260
Anyway.

1536
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:51,560
All right.

1537
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:52,920
So Stardew Valley on Tesla.

1538
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:54,120
So there you go.

1539
01:14:55,720 --> 01:15:00,760
Next up, let's do a follow-up and talk about the game awards again.

1540
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:05,320
We're going to talk a little bit about that X sex secret.

1541
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:08,680
The Xbox series X, the X, the X sucks.

1542
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:12,760
Well, just to take a little side note, actually, it's just supposed to be called.

1543
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:16,600
Xbox is actually, well, then you shouldn't have put out series X.

1544
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:18,280
Here's the thing.

1545
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:18,840
No, no, no.

1546
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:21,160
This is, I think people are making way too big a deal out of it.

1547
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:24,920
So a business insider or somebody ran a thing where there was an interview where the next

1548
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:28,360
gaming platform that Microsoft is putting out is called Xbox.

1549
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:30,920
And y'all done already knew known this.

1550
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:36,120
Because every time they release things on windows 10 that go back with Xbox, it's Xbox,

1551
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:41,640
Xbox gaming, Xbox game pass, Xbox, this Xbox, that that is the name of the platform.

1552
01:15:41,640 --> 01:15:44,120
Series X is just the name of the device.

1553
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:49,000
And if you think this is weird and stupid, then I'm going to use the blizzard approach.

1554
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,200
Don't you all have phones?

1555
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:53,160
Because this is the same thing that cell phones do.

1556
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:54,380
Right.

1557
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:57,720
Do, do does a game like Stardew Valley?

1558
01:15:57,800 --> 01:15:59,240
Is it Stardew Valley on cell phones?

1559
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:00,280
I'm assuming it is.

1560
01:16:00,280 --> 01:16:00,520
Okay.

1561
01:16:00,520 --> 01:16:05,080
So Stardew Valley, when you play it on your cell phone, you're playing it on iOS or Android,

1562
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:05,580
right?

1563
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:11,480
Now you might have an Apple iPhone 11 Max, but it's iOS.

1564
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:13,320
You might have an iPhone 6 iOS.

1565
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:15,160
You might have an iPad iOS.

1566
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:15,660
Okay.

1567
01:16:16,120 --> 01:16:20,360
So what Microsoft's doing is actually not that crazy because I'm seeing all these hot

1568
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:24,520
takes that are like, boy, Microsoft just keeps rebooting themselves.

1569
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:25,560
And now it's just the original.

1570
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:27,080
Didn't they already do the original Xbox?

1571
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:29,800
Stop, stop.

1572
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:30,920
Be quiet, Tiffany.

1573
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:39,800
What it is is that the Xbox is, and that actually it makes the name Xbox one actually all that

1574
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:46,760
more interesting because if Xbox one is the first truly forward compatible console, then

1575
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:48,280
it is truly Xbox one.

1576
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:55,880
And now series X is going to be the 11 pro max of Xbox until the next thing comes out.

1577
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:57,560
If you laugh, cause it's ridiculous, guess what?

1578
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:58,760
Your phones are ridiculous too.

1579
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:03,560
So that's, that's my whole thing on the whole Xbox thing.

1580
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:08,120
So anyway, act Efton chat says, shut the fuck up, Karen.

1581
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:08,920
You don't know shit.

1582
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:11,000
That's exactly what I'm saying right now.

1583
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:11,320
All right.

1584
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:11,820
Anyway.

1585
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:17,240
But how did they keep the secret of the Xbox series X and the fact that there is a new

1586
01:17:17,240 --> 01:17:21,000
Xbox console coming out and we were going to get to see it at the game awards?

1587
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Well, what happened is that Jeff Keeley did an interview with variety.

1588
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:29,960
And actually mentioned that when they were doing dress rehearsals and walkthroughs,

1589
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:34,120
that there was actually a fake script that Phil Spencer was using.

1590
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:40,040
So everybody behind the scenes and at the dress rehearsal and on the crew, they all

1591
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:43,720
thought that Phil Spencer was going to be talking about Xbox game pass.

1592
01:17:44,440 --> 01:17:46,600
Because that was what the script was about.

1593
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:51,160
And maybe that's where some of this talk about like control coming to Xbox game pass on.

1594
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:54,280
So, I mean, I know Phil Spencer had slipped up and said in a stream or something, but

1595
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:55,880
maybe all that stuff was like a front.

1596
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:58,280
Like, because maybe that was the lie.

1597
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:01,320
They may have been coming on stage with this whole lie about such and such games are coming

1598
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:06,920
to game pass and that actually, no, that wasn't, that was all, it was all a ruse because then

1599
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:11,880
the actual story, as we all know, and what we saw was that it was the Xbox series X,

1600
01:18:11,880 --> 01:18:15,800
but I thought that was fascinating that they had a whole fake script that they used.

1601
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:18,600
So everybody thought he was coming out to talk about Xbox game pass.

1602
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:20,200
That's pretty cool.

1603
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:22,120
I mean, yeah, but you know what?

1604
01:18:23,080 --> 01:18:24,600
Did, but did it leak?

1605
01:18:25,880 --> 01:18:27,080
No, it did not.

1606
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:28,520
No one saw that one coming.

1607
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:30,120
So you know what?

1608
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:30,600
It worked.

1609
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:32,680
All right.

1610
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:35,400
Bobby Black Wolf wants to remind us, Jeff and I have something in common.

1611
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:37,160
We've both been seen in variety.

1612
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:40,920
Yes, that is true.

1613
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:41,480
That is true.

1614
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:43,080
All right.

1615
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:45,400
Let's, let's go back to a classic time.

1616
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:49,720
Let's go back to a time when variety was actually still a magazine.

1617
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:51,000
There was actually a variety magazine.

1618
01:18:51,240 --> 01:18:53,960
I remember that magazine because we used to get it at work.

1619
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:54,360
That's right.

1620
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:56,760
It's the classic game of the week.

1621
01:18:56,760 --> 01:19:00,760
And, uh, every week dark soccer steps into the vault and finds a game on the shelf that she

1622
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:02,680
thinks, Hmm, why?

1623
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:04,760
Yes, this would be a good selection.

1624
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:05,080
Yes.

1625
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:07,000
And everybody should check out this game this week.

1626
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:07,800
Everyone really should.

1627
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:08,440
It's a good game.

1628
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:09,240
It is a, it is.

1629
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:10,040
It's one of those games.

1630
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:13,080
I'm kind of like, I'm really surprised she hasn't done this one, but again,

1631
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:14,280
I think it's a 10 year old game.

1632
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:15,000
I think it's one of those.

1633
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,360
It just turned 10, didn't it?

1634
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:16,840
Yes, it did.

1635
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:22,120
So dark soccer, that being said, what is the newly inducted classic game of the week?

1636
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:23,160
Dragon age origins.

1637
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:29,240
So of course, you know, it was the first of the dragon age games.

1638
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:32,200
Um, it was published by Bioware R.I.P.

1639
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:35,560
The Bioware I knew and loved, um, and published by electronic arts.

1640
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:37,400
It is the first of the dragon age games.

1641
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:42,440
It was released on windows, PS3 and Xbox 360 in November, 2009.

1642
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:44,680
And on Mac OS December, 2009.

1643
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:51,720
God, that would have been OS 10.4, 5, something like that.

1644
01:19:52,280 --> 01:19:58,920
Anyway, um, so it is set in the kingdom of Ferelden during, uh, a period where things

1645
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:00,040
are kind of shitty.

1646
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:06,360
And on top of there being political shittiness, there's, um, a, uh, a bunch of dark spawn

1647
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:11,160
running around because, uh, yeah, dark spawn are absolutely crap.

1648
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:16,840
And they're demons from, from, uh, the other world, from the, maybe from the Fade.

1649
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:19,400
I don't, I don't remember if they ever said that the dark spawn came from the Fade, but

1650
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:25,880
at any rate, um, but you play as one of three classes from three different backgrounds.

1651
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:28,360
Uh, you play a warrior, a mage or rogue.

1652
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:33,880
You can be elven, um, which actually I think in the elven, you either get, uh, as a mage,

1653
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:39,160
I think you start off as a circle mage and the others let you choose city elf or, uh,

1654
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:44,360
um, Dalish elf, which are basically like the, the wild elves.

1655
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:46,920
And then you can be a human or you can be a dwarf.

1656
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:52,760
Um, and you are recruited as a gray warden and you meet Alistair.

1657
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:54,120
Oh, he's so great.

1658
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:58,760
Um, because, uh, as, as he says, swooping is bad.

1659
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:03,720
But anyway, um, it's played in a third person perspective and you can shift it, uh, shift

1660
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:09,560
it to top down and you pick up other characters in the game that sometimes show up in later

1661
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:17,560
games, Morgan, um, and sometimes show up only in the comics, but it's really spawned this

1662
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:21,400
whole beautiful, uh, uh, right now, I guess trilogy.

1663
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:24,760
And, um, we're going to be having another dragon age game come out.

1664
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:30,920
So, um, but it really was well received and well reviewed, although I am glad that they

1665
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:36,600
went from not having the character have a voice to in dragon age two, where you could

1666
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:39,480
actually, the character had dialogue and Hawk was awesome.

1667
01:21:40,040 --> 01:21:50,440
But at any rate, um, the, uh, it's began development in 2002 had more than 144 voice

1668
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:57,160
actors, and it had, um, I non sort of, uh, compose the game's music and, uh, the console

1669
01:21:57,160 --> 01:22:00,600
versions were outsourced to a group called edge of reality.

1670
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:06,440
Um, the first expansion port came out in March, 2010 as awakening.

1671
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:11,800
And then, uh, dragon age two came out in 2011 and dragon age inquisition came out in 2014.

1672
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:16,280
I've played this shit out of dragon age inquisition, just saying this is the game that

1673
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:21,160
brought Cullen into that with his beautiful voice actor who kind of sometimes goes off

1674
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:23,800
the deep end and goes missing for days and then they find him.

1675
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:29,080
Um, yeah, that was a bit of drama, but at any rate, um, so as you go through, you're

1676
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:34,200
a great warden, which being a great warden has you do something like part of it involves

1677
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:38,120
ingesting, uh, dark spawn blood and some other botanicals.

1678
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:43,400
So I guess gin and, um, so you can sense the dark spawn, you get nightmares and stuff.

1679
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:48,840
Um, you can, you know, you've got your spell casting, you've got your rogue, which, um,

1680
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:51,800
I think in this one, I really preferred a rogue.

1681
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:56,200
Um, and dragon age two, I prefer to rogue, but I played a major in dragon age three because

1682
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:57,560
it was much easier.

1683
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:02,280
Um, so the classes that are available to you, as I said, you can sort of mix and match.

1684
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:07,400
We had dalish elf, dwarf commoner, a city elf, a major human noble or dwarf noble.

1685
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:11,160
Um, and it affects how the other characters will treat you.

1686
01:23:11,800 --> 01:23:16,200
Um, however, they all follow pretty much the same completion of the story.

1687
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:25,320
Like for an example, if you play a, an elf and you get it on with Alistair and he becomes

1688
01:23:25,320 --> 01:23:30,520
the king, you have to be as mistress because of the politics, the land, not permitting,

1689
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:33,960
um, the king to marry an elf.

1690
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:36,680
And it's actually, you know, not spoiler.

1691
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:41,880
He's elf blooded, you know, meaning that his mother was an elf, which you find out all

1692
01:23:41,880 --> 01:23:46,520
about her in one of the books and in dragon age inquisition, because Fiona was kind of

1693
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:53,320
stupid, but at any rate, um, it was very similar in gameplay to star wars nights of the old

1694
01:23:53,320 --> 01:24:01,320
Republic, um, where you engage, you have to engage the enemy and then attack that enemy.

1695
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:04,520
Um, or you can switch back to other enemies that you're fighting.

1696
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:09,000
You level up your warden with experience points, you know, like any type of RPG.

1697
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:15,880
Um, and then you can, um, get those points to distribute amongst your attributes.

1698
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:20,520
Um, you can interact with your party members and other NPCs.

1699
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:26,600
You have dialogue trees, which will unlock based on the things that you first select.

1700
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:32,680
So, um, and of course it also will sort of build again, your reputation with how you

1701
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:34,280
interact with these other characters.

1702
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:40,840
Um, and of course this really, I think, incorporated into later Bioware games.

1703
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:45,880
Cause you know, we had the, the paragon renegade dynamic in, um, mass effect, right?

1704
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:52,520
So, um, but at any rate you are in the world of Thedas, which, okay, this is going to sound

1705
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:58,200
kind of funny, but one of the things I always liked about it is that their world is actually

1706
01:24:58,200 --> 01:25:00,120
set in a Southern hemisphere.

1707
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:05,480
So the further South you go, the colder it gets in the further North you go, the warmer

1708
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:05,960
it gets.

1709
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:11,240
Um, and they are in the middle of a blight and the dark spawn are being shits and you

1710
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:11,880
got to stop them.

1711
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:21,320
Um, so of course this game brought us like some of the most, I would say memorable characters.

1712
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:24,600
I mean, just because I freaking love Alistair.

1713
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:27,080
Like he's one of my favorite characters ever in a game.

1714
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:33,480
There's Morrigan who, uh, you know, was raised by, uh, well, I don't want to spoil too much

1715
01:25:33,480 --> 01:25:38,680
if you are going to go in and play the games later, but her mother is Flemeth who is voiced

1716
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:39,480
by Kate Mulgrew.

1717
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:47,080
So, um, you have, uh, Ogrin the Dwarf who is just like, I love him cause he's drunk

1718
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:47,880
all the time.

1719
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:52,440
You have Wynn who actually ended up, uh, she was, I didn't care for her in the game so

1720
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:56,280
much, but I really liked her in one of the later novels.

1721
01:25:56,280 --> 01:25:57,880
I really liked her character in the novels.

1722
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:03,480
Um, you have Zevran who is the, uh, the Elvish assassin who wants to fuck everybody.

1723
01:26:04,440 --> 01:26:07,320
Um, you have a dog, a Mabari.

1724
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:10,200
And of course the first thing I do is put in the mod so that you can have them in your

1725
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:14,840
party all the time, even if he's not actually in your party, because I love dog.

1726
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:15,720
I just named him dog.

1727
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:16,680
But can you pet the dog?

1728
01:26:18,360 --> 01:26:19,240
You can play with him.

1729
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:19,740
Yeah.

1730
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:25,320
Um, he also in the DLC, you get a character named Shale who has a golem who, uh, hates

1731
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:30,200
birds and, um, you actually find out more about Shale later on through the game.

1732
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:36,520
Shale was a dwarf who was part of like some ritual to turn her into a golem and she's

1733
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:37,640
sarcastic as fuck.

1734
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:38,600
That is my bitch.

1735
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:39,560
I love her.

1736
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:46,200
Um, you get, uh, Sten who is, uh, Qunari, um, and I mean, and Leliana.

1737
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:47,480
I love Leliana.

1738
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:51,240
She, um, and a lot of these characters will make appearances in Dragon Age 2, but you

1739
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:57,160
get Leliana as a ongoing character in Dragon Age 3 as your spy, not 3, but Inquisition

1740
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:57,960
as your spy master.

1741
01:26:57,960 --> 01:26:59,880
I just freaking, I love all these characters.

1742
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:03,400
Like I like a series when I like all the characters and the ones that I hate, I really fucking

1743
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:03,900
hate.

1744
01:27:04,460 --> 01:27:12,700
Um, like I hated the character Logain so much that I actually went in and let him live so

1745
01:27:12,700 --> 01:27:17,100
that I could feed him to the, the darkspawn in a later game.

1746
01:27:18,060 --> 01:27:18,540
Nice.

1747
01:27:18,540 --> 01:27:28,220
Um, it's just, I, I freaking, I freaking love this game and, and it is a bit more of a mature

1748
01:27:28,220 --> 01:27:31,100
game, you know, it's a memory game.

1749
01:27:32,060 --> 01:27:37,020
Um, so, but it is just really fun.

1750
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:44,060
I mean, you think about this first game being a game from 2009, it doesn't look too bad

1751
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:45,580
for being a 10 year old game.

1752
01:27:45,580 --> 01:27:47,580
I thought they did a great job with it.

1753
01:27:47,580 --> 01:27:52,060
And since then, people have done their own high res mods like they did from, you've seen

1754
01:27:52,060 --> 01:27:57,260
the high res mods for Mass Effect 3 on PC, but they've done, um, you know, there's a

1755
01:27:57,260 --> 01:28:02,620
massive modding community for this, like custom hairstyles and outfits and all kinds

1756
01:28:02,620 --> 01:28:05,260
of, you know, gorgeous stuff.

1757
01:28:05,260 --> 01:28:13,980
And there is even a, um, what's the word I'm trying to think, a graphic nookie mod for

1758
01:28:13,980 --> 01:28:16,700
getting it on sexy times with your characters so that them just standing where they're

1759
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:17,200
nowhere.

1760
01:28:17,740 --> 01:28:26,780
Um, and it really, I mean, it's probably, I'd say one of the best games that came out.

1761
01:28:26,860 --> 01:28:29,820
I mean, the DLC adds a lot more to it.

1762
01:28:29,820 --> 01:28:35,420
Um, you also have some crossovers with, uh, BioWare's other games, like in Mass Effect

1763
01:28:35,420 --> 01:28:40,940
2, you can get the blood dragon armor, which comes directly from this game.

1764
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:46,460
So, and, um, as far as the DLC, we had the stone prisoners that gives you shale.

1765
01:28:46,460 --> 01:28:51,740
We had the warden's keep that, um, adds the fortress of soldiers peak.

1766
01:28:51,740 --> 01:28:57,420
And you get a little bit more about the gray wardens, um, returned to Ostagar, which is

1767
01:28:57,420 --> 01:28:59,660
the first battlefield that you fight on.

1768
01:28:59,660 --> 01:29:06,780
Then awakening came out, which was basically the aftermath of origins where, uh, you have

1769
01:29:06,780 --> 01:29:11,100
to stop this creature called the architect, which I think the architect was the sort of

1770
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:14,860
lead into the main, uh, antagonist for dragon age inquisition.

1771
01:29:14,860 --> 01:29:21,180
You had the dark spawn Chronicles where you basically are, uh, playing as the dark spawn

1772
01:29:21,180 --> 01:29:26,860
army, um, and you have Leliana's song, which is, you know, some of her experiences, the

1773
01:29:26,860 --> 01:29:31,820
golems of Amgarak and witch hunt, which is where you go look for Morgan after she fucks

1774
01:29:31,820 --> 01:29:38,860
off into, you know, Heriluvian, which is a new war that takes you into the Fade or some

1775
01:29:38,860 --> 01:29:39,660
intermediary place.

1776
01:29:39,660 --> 01:29:42,380
Not really the Fade, it's like an intermediary that kind of works like the Fade.

1777
01:29:43,020 --> 01:29:45,180
Um, but yeah, this game is great.

1778
01:29:45,180 --> 01:29:51,100
It, it's been, I mean, I don't know why people said that the graphics weren't super great,

1779
01:29:51,100 --> 01:29:54,700
but it was pretty, I mean, but they said that a lot of it was really eye catching, but some

1780
01:29:54,700 --> 01:29:59,660
people were saying, like I was saying that, you know, even ace me, the nookie scenes are

1781
01:29:59,660 --> 01:30:00,700
just really anticlimactic.

1782
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:06,380
So, um, yeah, tons of mods, tons of mods.

1783
01:30:06,380 --> 01:30:11,740
And like I said, it is spawned a, uh, a franchise.

1784
01:30:12,060 --> 01:30:16,700
There's also a free to play game called Heroes of Dragon Age that's on iOS, which I've played

1785
01:30:16,700 --> 01:30:17,420
for a little bit.

1786
01:30:17,980 --> 01:30:21,900
Um, and there is another, uh, Dragon Age game coming out.

1787
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:24,940
We've already seen some teaser information, just a little bit leaked.

1788
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:33,420
Um, we know it's going to be, uh, uh, set in, um, well, actually I'll say if you, if you

1789
01:30:33,420 --> 01:30:36,620
haven't read the spoilers and you don't want the spoilers, then I'm not going to say anything

1790
01:30:36,620 --> 01:30:37,340
about it.

1791
01:30:37,340 --> 01:30:40,060
I personally was excited.

1792
01:30:40,060 --> 01:30:40,700
Fuck, I'll just say it.

1793
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:44,780
It's set into Vinter, which you don't really, you hear a lot about this place, but you don't

1794
01:30:44,780 --> 01:30:46,700
really know a lot about it.

1795
01:30:46,700 --> 01:30:49,580
So I think that it's going to be just really awesome.

1796
01:30:49,580 --> 01:30:53,340
And I'm glad this game came out because it gave me one of my absolute favorite franchises,

1797
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:56,300
but I'd have to say thank you to Mass Effect for getting me into Dragon Age.

1798
01:30:56,860 --> 01:30:57,740
All right.

1799
01:30:57,740 --> 01:30:58,780
I think the video looped.

1800
01:30:59,900 --> 01:31:00,860
That's all right.

1801
01:31:00,860 --> 01:31:01,500
So there it is.

1802
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:02,460
I think I can breathe now.

1803
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:02,940
That's fine.

1804
01:31:02,940 --> 01:31:05,980
Your classic game of the week is Dragon Age.

1805
01:31:06,620 --> 01:31:07,020
Good pick.

1806
01:31:07,580 --> 01:31:08,220
Good pick.

1807
01:31:08,220 --> 01:31:11,020
I have to admit, I never got into Dragon Age as much as I did Mass Effect.

1808
01:31:11,020 --> 01:31:17,100
And I think for some reason, like I, I, I, I clicked a little more with Inquisition and

1809
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:20,140
I think just maybe some of the upgrades to the actual game part of it.

1810
01:31:20,140 --> 01:31:21,820
How could you let Alistair become a drunk?

1811
01:31:23,020 --> 01:31:28,940
Anyway, uh, many, many different ways the story can play out in, in a game like Dragon

1812
01:31:28,940 --> 01:31:29,180
Age.

1813
01:31:29,180 --> 01:31:33,580
And as Dark Sakura said, uh, Kay Mogru in the voice acting cast, you know, the only

1814
01:31:33,580 --> 01:31:37,980
thing cooler than that, that I can really think of, uh, is Linda Carter in, uh, Skyrim.

1815
01:31:38,540 --> 01:31:42,380
Um, and I mean, Lindsay Wagner in, um, Death Stranding.

1816
01:31:42,380 --> 01:31:45,740
Although she didn't, it's her likeness for the younger version.

1817
01:31:45,740 --> 01:31:46,220
Likeness.

1818
01:31:46,220 --> 01:31:46,780
Yeah.

1819
01:31:46,780 --> 01:31:48,380
But her voice for the older version.

1820
01:31:48,380 --> 01:31:49,100
Yes.

1821
01:31:49,100 --> 01:31:49,660
Yeah.

1822
01:31:49,660 --> 01:31:50,860
Lindsay Wagner, man.

1823
01:31:50,860 --> 01:31:54,060
Man, has Leslie and Warren ever been in a video game?

1824
01:31:54,060 --> 01:31:54,780
That's what we need.

1825
01:31:54,780 --> 01:31:58,860
We need all these television stars of, uh, the seventies and eighties to, uh, come back.

1826
01:31:58,860 --> 01:32:00,300
Leslie and Warren was awesome.

1827
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:02,220
Leslie and Warren was awesome.

1828
01:32:02,220 --> 01:32:06,140
They did a Mission Impossible game years ago, but it was that, do you remember when ABC

1829
01:32:06,140 --> 01:32:07,820
did that reboot in the nineties?

1830
01:32:08,780 --> 01:32:13,980
Brad from Pod Culture points out that Eve Miles was in, uh, she was actually in Dragon

1831
01:32:13,980 --> 01:32:17,420
Age 2, um, as Meryl.

1832
01:32:17,420 --> 01:32:19,420
I wanted to romance her and then she pissed me off.

1833
01:32:20,380 --> 01:32:22,140
So, um, but yeah, she was Meryl.

1834
01:32:22,140 --> 01:32:22,620
All right.

1835
01:32:22,620 --> 01:32:23,260
So anyway.

1836
01:32:23,260 --> 01:32:23,580
All right.

1837
01:32:23,580 --> 01:32:26,620
Hashtag Leslie and Warren for epic video game, please.

1838
01:32:28,060 --> 01:32:29,420
We need to do the clue MMO.

1839
01:32:30,140 --> 01:32:31,980
You know, you know, they're doing clue MO.

1840
01:32:31,980 --> 01:32:32,780
They're doing that.

1841
01:32:32,780 --> 01:32:33,980
It's not just clue though.

1842
01:32:33,980 --> 01:32:35,500
Obviously she was a Mission Impossible.

1843
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:37,580
She had a lot of television movies and stuff back in the day.

1844
01:32:37,660 --> 01:32:40,060
But, um, oh, says Linda Hamilton and Gears 5.

1845
01:32:40,060 --> 01:32:42,940
That's Linda Hamilton's more like a nineties.

1846
01:32:42,940 --> 01:32:46,860
She's the only reason I want to see that terrible Terminator movie that you actually saw it.

1847
01:32:46,860 --> 01:32:50,540
No, I didn't see it, but I want to see it because I forgot all about that movie.

1848
01:32:50,540 --> 01:32:51,580
Oh, the Terminator dark.

1849
01:32:51,580 --> 01:32:52,860
It was apparently terrible.

1850
01:32:52,860 --> 01:32:56,940
Speaking of terrible movies, uh, dark soccer and I have it going to be terrible.

1851
01:32:56,940 --> 01:32:58,060
We have a Christmas date.

1852
01:32:58,060 --> 01:32:59,100
We're going to go see cats.

1853
01:32:59,100 --> 01:33:01,260
We're going to go see the patched version of cats.

1854
01:33:01,260 --> 01:33:01,420
Okay.

1855
01:33:01,420 --> 01:33:06,700
So the reason they patched it actually, because not all of the visual effects had been, um,

1856
01:33:06,780 --> 01:33:07,740
in the release version.

1857
01:33:07,740 --> 01:33:08,780
They released the wrong version.

1858
01:33:10,620 --> 01:33:10,860
Okay.

1859
01:33:10,860 --> 01:33:12,300
So there's been a lot of talk on.

1860
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:14,220
I now want to see the unpatched version.

1861
01:33:14,220 --> 01:33:15,580
That sounds even better.

1862
01:33:15,580 --> 01:33:18,140
It's like you could see Judi Dench's hands in one scene.

1863
01:33:19,420 --> 01:33:24,300
Everybody's fucking talking about how, oh, here we are 2019.

1864
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:27,180
Now we're patching our movies, just like our video games.

1865
01:33:27,180 --> 01:33:29,420
And it's like, it's like, isn't that the tea?

1866
01:33:30,060 --> 01:33:37,500
Like, Oh, we, we had to in new in cats, version 1.1 fixed Judi Dench's hand in the,

1867
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:39,900
you know, jealous old dance.

1868
01:33:39,900 --> 01:33:42,060
I want the unpassed version on Blu-ray.

1869
01:33:42,060 --> 01:33:44,940
Doesn't Judi Dench play, um, old Deuteronomy.

1870
01:33:44,940 --> 01:33:45,340
She does.

1871
01:33:45,900 --> 01:33:46,540
Yeah.

1872
01:33:46,540 --> 01:33:51,020
Actually, I'm kind of interested to see them do old Deuteronomy in a female role.

1873
01:33:51,020 --> 01:33:53,900
Cause old Deuteronomy on stage was always a male role.

1874
01:33:55,020 --> 01:33:56,620
So yeah, no, look, well, here's the thing.

1875
01:33:56,620 --> 01:34:00,540
So Dark Soccer and I, we have a Christmas date because Dark Soccer is Jewish.

1876
01:34:00,540 --> 01:34:05,260
So, you know, whatever with Christmas and our plans, uh, that we usually do kind of

1877
01:34:05,260 --> 01:34:08,300
fell through, but nobody has to truly be alone on Christmas.

1878
01:34:08,300 --> 01:34:11,900
So Dark Soccer is going to be my Christmas Eve or Christmas day.

1879
01:34:13,340 --> 01:34:15,660
Dan and I do, um, our presence on Christmas Eve.

1880
01:34:15,660 --> 01:34:18,060
And we've always done things with my dad on Christmas Eve.

1881
01:34:18,060 --> 01:34:20,060
So, uh, we're still doing that.

1882
01:34:20,060 --> 01:34:24,140
If we can also find the, uh, like an Asian food place that's open, then that has happened too.

1883
01:34:24,140 --> 01:34:25,900
But we're going to go see Cats.

1884
01:34:25,900 --> 01:34:28,540
And yes, we've heard how bad it is.

1885
01:34:28,540 --> 01:34:32,220
Um, I don't know about you, you Dark Soccer, but I don't give a fuck.

1886
01:34:32,220 --> 01:34:34,220
Like I still, I really wanted to see it.

1887
01:34:34,220 --> 01:34:36,140
No, I want to love it and all its badness.

1888
01:34:36,140 --> 01:34:37,500
I'm going to sing right along with it.

1889
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:38,140
Here's the thing.

1890
01:34:38,140 --> 01:34:39,020
Here's the thing.

1891
01:34:39,020 --> 01:34:40,780
I understand that the movie is terrible.

1892
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:46,140
Did you know, fun fact, the play that it's based on is also terrible.

1893
01:34:46,140 --> 01:34:47,100
No, it's not.

1894
01:34:47,100 --> 01:34:48,940
So what were you expecting?

1895
01:34:48,940 --> 01:34:49,900
It's not terrible.

1896
01:34:50,860 --> 01:34:53,900
It was my only play I've ever seen on Broadway.

1897
01:34:53,900 --> 01:34:56,860
I saw it at the Winter Garden Theater when I was in high school.

1898
01:34:56,860 --> 01:35:00,300
And you know what they did in the Winter Garden Theater after they got rid of my beloved cats?

1899
01:35:01,020 --> 01:35:01,740
Mamma Mia.

1900
01:35:01,740 --> 01:35:02,240
Rocky.

1901
01:35:02,860 --> 01:35:03,900
No, that wasn't in the Winter Garden.

1902
01:35:03,900 --> 01:35:04,460
That was Winter Garden.

1903
01:35:04,460 --> 01:35:05,660
It was Circle in the Square.

1904
01:35:05,660 --> 01:35:08,700
No, I thought that the first place that it played on was Winter Garden after Cats ended.

1905
01:35:08,700 --> 01:35:09,260
Did it?

1906
01:35:09,260 --> 01:35:10,620
That was Circle Gets the Square?

1907
01:35:10,620 --> 01:35:11,260
No, there's just-

1908
01:35:11,260 --> 01:35:12,140
I'll double check.

1909
01:35:12,140 --> 01:35:13,180
Square Gets the Circle.

1910
01:35:13,180 --> 01:35:13,660
All right.

1911
01:35:13,660 --> 01:35:13,980
Anyway.

1912
01:35:13,980 --> 01:35:15,260
Cats is not fucking horrible.

1913
01:35:15,260 --> 01:35:16,460
So shut the fuck up.

1914
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:18,860
It's, it's bad in a good way.

1915
01:35:18,860 --> 01:35:22,300
It's one of those, this is, it's cheese, but Xanadu.

1916
01:35:22,300 --> 01:35:23,820
It's Xanadu bad.

1917
01:35:24,380 --> 01:35:25,100
It's not bad though.

1918
01:35:26,220 --> 01:35:28,540
I mean, no, it really isn't bad.

1919
01:35:28,540 --> 01:35:31,660
I mean, you have to look at the source material is, you know, a T.S.

1920
01:35:31,660 --> 01:35:32,620
Elliot book.

1921
01:35:32,620 --> 01:35:37,980
It was a bunch of disparate poems about cats and it's there just to have the spotlight on

1922
01:35:37,980 --> 01:35:38,940
each cat.

1923
01:35:38,940 --> 01:35:40,780
That to me is what it is.

1924
01:35:40,780 --> 01:35:43,180
Each cat has our own little spotlight.

1925
01:35:43,180 --> 01:35:47,260
It shows the playfulness of, of the animals.

1926
01:35:47,260 --> 01:35:51,580
It shows, you know, just a little bit of, if you would humanize them, what their lives

1927
01:35:51,580 --> 01:35:52,220
would be like.

1928
01:35:52,220 --> 01:35:56,940
I mean, I really just, well, then again, I am like, that was Xanadu where I like all

1929
01:35:56,940 --> 01:36:02,060
the parts of it, but I, I freaking, I don't even know where my poor CD is.

1930
01:36:02,060 --> 01:36:05,340
I played it so much and sang with it so much.

1931
01:36:05,340 --> 01:36:06,620
Cats is not bad.

1932
01:36:06,620 --> 01:36:08,380
You have to look at it as a sum.

1933
01:36:09,420 --> 01:36:12,140
So, and you know, go ahead.

1934
01:36:13,180 --> 01:36:14,140
No, that's fine.

1935
01:36:14,140 --> 01:36:16,300
I'm gonna make the stupid joke after you're done.

1936
01:36:16,300 --> 01:36:20,460
Because I was going to say, y'all know, if you don't know, you're going to know, I love

1937
01:36:20,460 --> 01:36:22,860
the movie showgirls from the mid nineties.

1938
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:25,820
I was just going to say it's no showgirls, but yeah.

1939
01:36:25,820 --> 01:36:26,540
And here's the thing.

1940
01:36:26,540 --> 01:36:27,820
Here's the thing about showgirls.

1941
01:36:27,820 --> 01:36:30,460
Showgirls really truly is one of those movies that like, it's so bad.

1942
01:36:30,460 --> 01:36:32,300
It's kind of good, but it's one of those movies.

1943
01:36:32,300 --> 01:36:35,580
Like I could just kind of like have on in the background as I'm like going about my

1944
01:36:35,580 --> 01:36:35,980
day.

1945
01:36:35,980 --> 01:36:37,180
It's a Christmas movie.

1946
01:36:37,180 --> 01:36:41,100
I can be cleaning, you know, or whatever, or, or getting something organized or something.

1947
01:36:41,100 --> 01:36:43,100
And then like, you know, come along and I'll be quoting along with the movie.

1948
01:36:43,100 --> 01:36:44,140
You know, you don't know shit.

1949
01:36:44,700 --> 01:36:45,420
Where are you from?

1950
01:36:45,420 --> 01:36:45,980
Back East.

1951
01:36:45,980 --> 01:36:46,780
Where back East?

1952
01:36:46,780 --> 01:36:47,980
Different places.

1953
01:36:47,980 --> 01:36:52,460
You know, like it's just, you can just, it's like one of those great, like background movies.

1954
01:36:52,460 --> 01:36:57,580
And you know, there, there, there was a point they were trying to make somewhere in there.

1955
01:36:58,860 --> 01:37:01,180
There was a point to be made in there somewhere.

1956
01:37:02,780 --> 01:37:04,460
Didn't they make a sequel to that movie?

1957
01:37:05,900 --> 01:37:06,380
Showgirls.

1958
01:37:06,380 --> 01:37:07,020
I thought they did.

1959
01:37:07,020 --> 01:37:13,900
It's about the, um, the girl from the, the other dancer that the one guy is with the,

1960
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:15,820
that one guy with the dreads is with.

1961
01:37:16,380 --> 01:37:17,740
And then it's like about her.

1962
01:37:18,060 --> 01:37:20,780
And it was, it was not lauded.

1963
01:37:22,540 --> 01:37:23,020
Yeah.

1964
01:37:23,020 --> 01:37:25,580
It, it, don't try to read too much into the plot.

1965
01:37:25,580 --> 01:37:26,380
Just, just don't.

1966
01:37:26,380 --> 01:37:28,860
Although it would have been awesome if they'd made the sequel.

1967
01:37:28,860 --> 01:37:31,740
Cause you know, the end of the movie was a teaser for the sequel.

1968
01:37:31,740 --> 01:37:35,100
Cause she gets back in, I mean, spoiler alert for Showgirls.

1969
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:38,060
But at the end of the movie, she gets back in the car with the hitchhiker that dropped

1970
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:39,820
her off in the beginning and then stole her stuff.

1971
01:37:39,820 --> 01:37:43,820
So she gets back in the car and they going off and you see that they're on their way

1972
01:37:43,820 --> 01:37:44,620
to Hollywood.

1973
01:37:44,620 --> 01:37:46,140
There's a sign that says Hollywood.

1974
01:37:46,140 --> 01:37:50,780
Well, the second movie, cause I mean, justice for Showgirls, there should be a Showgirls

1975
01:37:50,780 --> 01:37:51,260
too.

1976
01:37:51,260 --> 01:37:52,220
The second movie was good.

1977
01:37:52,220 --> 01:37:55,020
Well, I, and actually there was a Showgirls too, but it wasn't the same thing.

1978
01:37:55,020 --> 01:37:56,380
That was all about Penny.

1979
01:37:56,380 --> 01:37:56,880
Yeah.

1980
01:37:57,740 --> 01:37:58,540
I couldn't remember her name.

1981
01:37:59,100 --> 01:38:02,620
Rena something is the actress's name and she did it all herself.

1982
01:38:02,620 --> 01:38:07,020
But anyway, um, the second movie was going to be a Hollywood parody.

1983
01:38:07,020 --> 01:38:12,860
And instead we got, uh, Alan Smithy presents burn Hollywood burn, which I'm convinced

1984
01:38:12,860 --> 01:38:15,340
some of that was the concept for Showgirls too.

1985
01:38:15,340 --> 01:38:16,460
I haven't seen that.

1986
01:38:16,460 --> 01:38:20,860
It's like that movie is bad and period.

1987
01:38:20,860 --> 01:38:26,780
There's no, there's no, but yet, although no, it's, it's just bad with a period.

1988
01:38:26,780 --> 01:38:30,940
I want them to make a sequel to cats, but with all the internet meme cats, like grumpy

1989
01:38:30,940 --> 01:38:35,580
cat, long cat, I want to find out what happens to them when we, you know?

1990
01:38:36,460 --> 01:38:37,020
All right.

1991
01:38:37,020 --> 01:38:38,700
Anyhow, so let's move on.

1992
01:38:38,700 --> 01:38:38,940
Oh yes.

1993
01:38:38,940 --> 01:38:40,140
That was all the classic game of the week.

1994
01:38:40,140 --> 01:38:40,540
Sorry.

1995
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:41,340
Uh, tangents.

1996
01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:41,900
They happen.

1997
01:38:41,900 --> 01:38:45,500
Let's get into some rapid fire news and talk about some other things happening around in

1998
01:38:45,500 --> 01:38:48,140
the game world very quickly, starting off with Loki.

1999
01:38:48,140 --> 01:38:49,100
So this is kind of cute.

2000
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:54,780
Then if you have a Japanese region switch or you happen to have an account in the Japanese

2001
01:38:54,780 --> 01:39:01,580
region and you have Labo, um, or Labo VR cartridge, you can actually play a Christmas

2002
01:39:01,580 --> 01:39:03,420
themed Labo mini game.

2003
01:39:03,980 --> 01:39:08,460
Um, with that, it's basically a Santa platformer on rooftops.

2004
01:39:09,420 --> 01:39:10,860
So that's the neat thing.

2005
01:39:10,860 --> 01:39:17,100
Basically you have to have the Japanese news channel, um, so you make your free, uh, Japanese

2006
01:39:17,100 --> 01:39:19,580
region switch account and you can get it through there.

2007
01:39:20,620 --> 01:39:21,260
All right.

2008
01:39:21,260 --> 01:39:26,620
And then in 2020, we've got our first games with golden ounce.

2009
01:39:26,620 --> 01:39:30,780
So we have, uh, for Xbox one, six shards of darkness.

2010
01:39:31,660 --> 01:39:36,620
And then we've got Batman and telltale series, and those are both Xbox one and then your

2011
01:39:36,620 --> 01:39:42,220
Xbox 360 compatible games, Tekken six and Lego star Wars to the original trilogy.

2012
01:39:44,220 --> 01:39:45,100
That's it.

2013
01:39:45,100 --> 01:39:45,500
All right.

2014
01:39:46,060 --> 01:39:51,980
Uh, well going to the switch and Nintendo, um, Nintendo made a yule log video because

2015
01:39:51,980 --> 01:39:54,300
this is the time of year where companies are making you log videos.

2016
01:39:54,300 --> 01:39:54,460
Yeah.

2017
01:39:54,460 --> 01:39:58,700
Like, isn't there like the Overwatch, the Overwatch guy, Jeff, just sitting there with

2018
01:39:58,700 --> 01:39:59,500
a yule log or something.

2019
01:39:59,500 --> 01:40:03,420
There's that there's steam has one that's part of their steam sale right now.

2020
01:40:03,500 --> 01:40:03,980
I know.

2021
01:40:03,980 --> 01:40:05,340
Was it Linus Texas?

2022
01:40:05,340 --> 01:40:06,620
They did an eight K one.

2023
01:40:06,620 --> 01:40:06,940
Yeah.

2024
01:40:06,940 --> 01:40:07,980
I don't anyway.

2025
01:40:07,980 --> 01:40:12,700
Um, so, uh, there's a new sights and sounds video that was put out by Nintendo where you

2026
01:40:12,700 --> 01:40:17,260
can just watch somebody play their switch for half an hour in front of a fire.

2027
01:40:18,460 --> 01:40:23,500
Sadly, the switch has never thrown into the fire because I know you all want to know dark

2028
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:27,500
souls or like, like a rage thing that happens.

2029
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:27,820
Yeah.

2030
01:40:27,820 --> 01:40:32,220
Playing dark souls or something or like, I can't beat this fucking level of Mario Odyssey.

2031
01:40:32,220 --> 01:40:33,020
Fuck this thing.

2032
01:40:33,580 --> 01:40:35,740
The drift on these controllers is so bad.

2033
01:40:35,740 --> 01:40:37,740
That makes me want to throw them into the fire.

2034
01:40:38,460 --> 01:40:39,980
Speaking of steam.

2035
01:40:39,980 --> 01:40:40,300
Yes.

2036
01:40:40,300 --> 01:40:43,740
The winter sale just recently kicked off this past week.

2037
01:40:43,740 --> 01:40:46,060
It's running concurrently with the steam awards thing.

2038
01:40:46,060 --> 01:40:49,020
So there's lots of games on sale there through Thursday.

2039
01:40:49,020 --> 01:40:50,940
January 2nd is when that ends.

2040
01:40:50,940 --> 01:40:54,220
So I'm sure there's a lot of people that are, you know, going like supermarket sweep and

2041
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:58,540
shoving their cart full of hams right now and whatever like cheap video games they're

2042
01:40:58,540 --> 01:41:00,700
waiting to catch up on.

2043
01:41:00,700 --> 01:41:04,540
Something to keep in mind, like you said earlier in the show humble bundle.

2044
01:41:04,540 --> 01:41:04,700
Yeah.

2045
01:41:04,700 --> 01:41:11,260
And I just, I just didn't do that because I was looking for a certain game for my son

2046
01:41:11,260 --> 01:41:11,820
on the switch.

2047
01:41:13,180 --> 01:41:17,660
Trials rising because he likes playing the demo for PlayStation four.

2048
01:41:17,660 --> 01:41:19,980
And I just, I'm not moving the PlayStation four to his room.

2049
01:41:20,860 --> 01:41:23,900
So I got it for him on his PC.

2050
01:41:23,900 --> 01:41:27,100
And so I gifted it to him in steam because I know he'll never get it before Christmas

2051
01:41:27,100 --> 01:41:28,940
because he never opened steam ever.

2052
01:41:28,940 --> 01:41:31,660
So we'll be fine there.

2053
01:41:31,660 --> 01:41:32,460
Be fine.

2054
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:32,700
Good.

2055
01:41:33,260 --> 01:41:33,820
So there's that.

2056
01:41:33,820 --> 01:41:36,540
And then the Epic store is doing a sale as well.

2057
01:41:36,540 --> 01:41:40,220
They are also giving away 12 free games, one each day.

2058
01:41:40,220 --> 01:41:41,420
And I'm actually kind of pissed off.

2059
01:41:41,420 --> 01:41:44,060
I missed the first couple of days because super hot was one of the games.

2060
01:41:44,060 --> 01:41:46,540
Yeah, I already have it, but I didn't have that yet.

2061
01:41:46,540 --> 01:41:47,900
I missed it yesterday.

2062
01:41:47,900 --> 01:41:49,740
Towerfall Ascension was one of the games too.

2063
01:41:49,740 --> 01:41:51,340
That was, yeah, two days ago.

2064
01:41:51,340 --> 01:41:56,300
And today was I got today's little inferno, which I was today already having like all

2065
01:41:56,300 --> 01:41:58,380
these platforms still played it.

2066
01:41:58,380 --> 01:42:01,420
I feel like it's one of those things where like the last one will be a big one.

2067
01:42:01,420 --> 01:42:01,900
You know?

2068
01:42:01,900 --> 01:42:04,300
I mean, Epic store gave away, it's Fortnite.

2069
01:42:04,300 --> 01:42:07,340
And that's the Epic store gave away those Batman games.

2070
01:42:07,340 --> 01:42:07,980
Not that long ago.

2071
01:42:07,980 --> 01:42:09,180
Those are some great games.

2072
01:42:09,180 --> 01:42:10,220
Like we never played them.

2073
01:42:10,220 --> 01:42:14,380
So my Epic library is getting quite large because of all those free games.

2074
01:42:14,380 --> 01:42:14,620
Yeah.

2075
01:42:14,620 --> 01:42:16,700
Considering I've never spent a penny on that store.

2076
01:42:16,700 --> 01:42:17,660
I have a lot of games.

2077
01:42:18,300 --> 01:42:19,580
Well, they also have a thing right now.

2078
01:42:19,580 --> 01:42:21,020
And that's the Sarpin epic step.

2079
01:42:21,020 --> 01:42:24,780
But if you want a game for that's 14 99 or above, they'll give you 10 bucks off.

2080
01:42:24,780 --> 01:42:24,940
Yeah.

2081
01:42:24,940 --> 01:42:26,860
That's kind of, that's their sale instead of that.

2082
01:42:26,860 --> 01:42:29,180
Cause you know, steam makes the mini game out of it and all that stuff.

2083
01:42:29,180 --> 01:42:32,620
So Epic just, well, they still have stuff discounted too, but it's, well, the Epic

2084
01:42:32,620 --> 01:42:33,340
and, you know, okay.

2085
01:42:33,340 --> 01:42:36,060
So since we've been talking them up, let me knock them down a few pegs.

2086
01:42:36,060 --> 01:42:38,300
The Epic store still kind of sucks in a lot of ways.

2087
01:42:38,300 --> 01:42:41,420
Like the fact that they don't have the prepaid cards and that whole thing.

2088
01:42:41,420 --> 01:42:44,300
And the fact, you know, it's still kind of a bare bones thing.

2089
01:42:44,300 --> 01:42:48,220
So, I mean, the fact that they're doing a bare bones sale isn't too terribly

2090
01:42:48,220 --> 01:42:49,660
surprising at the end of that.

2091
01:42:49,660 --> 01:42:52,460
I can't use V bucks on, uh, the Epic store.

2092
01:42:52,460 --> 01:42:54,380
I mean, that is their currency for Fortnite.

2093
01:42:54,380 --> 01:42:56,220
So I don't think so.

2094
01:42:56,220 --> 01:42:59,020
Uh, the power is saying super hot was on Twitch prime earlier this year.

2095
01:42:59,020 --> 01:42:59,740
Did I miss it?

2096
01:43:00,300 --> 01:43:00,940
I must have.

2097
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:02,140
I don't remember.

2098
01:43:02,140 --> 01:43:05,180
Like I ever played any of the games I have through Twitch prime anyways.

2099
01:43:05,180 --> 01:43:06,620
I know I have a library there too.

2100
01:43:06,620 --> 01:43:08,620
And I couldn't tell you what's on it.

2101
01:43:08,620 --> 01:43:09,020
I know.

2102
01:43:09,020 --> 01:43:09,740
Right.

2103
01:43:09,740 --> 01:43:12,460
So, Hey, is there, is there a gift thing on Twitch prime right now?

2104
01:43:12,460 --> 01:43:13,820
Maybe we need to open up the box.

2105
01:43:13,820 --> 01:43:15,020
We haven't done that in a few weeks.

2106
01:43:15,580 --> 01:43:18,060
So, and since Bobby's there and paying attention, maybe.

2107
01:43:18,060 --> 01:43:19,180
Um, cause it doesn't work.

2108
01:43:19,180 --> 01:43:20,780
So here's what the deal is.

2109
01:43:20,780 --> 01:43:23,580
I'm logged into my account here.

2110
01:43:23,660 --> 01:43:29,980
So I can't actually open the box because that is something that happens on the VOG.

2111
01:43:29,980 --> 01:43:31,580
I have to be on VOG account to open the box.

2112
01:43:31,580 --> 01:43:32,780
That's why I always yell at Bobby.

2113
01:43:32,780 --> 01:43:33,420
Thank you, Bobby.

2114
01:43:33,420 --> 01:43:33,980
Open the box.

2115
01:43:34,540 --> 01:43:37,580
Uh, and it's a legal, it's a league of legends mystery skin this week.

2116
01:43:37,580 --> 01:43:39,900
So that's something that, um, some folks might actually want.

2117
01:43:39,900 --> 01:43:41,740
So free grub hub.

2118
01:43:41,740 --> 01:43:46,060
I'm going to just throw in some, uh, stuff into there as well.

2119
01:43:46,060 --> 01:43:48,940
You know, they kind of stopped giving away games on Twitch.

2120
01:43:48,940 --> 01:43:49,020
Yeah.

2121
01:43:49,020 --> 01:43:51,980
It's a lot of learn more and I'm like, I don't want to learn.

2122
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:53,420
I just want free things.

2123
01:43:55,820 --> 01:43:59,660
Oh, there's also speaking of which, um, there's a discord slash

2124
01:43:59,660 --> 01:44:01,340
X-Box thing going on right now.

2125
01:44:01,340 --> 01:44:03,900
So if you have X-Box, I think it's game pass.

2126
01:44:05,020 --> 01:44:06,540
Maybe it's X-Box gold.

2127
01:44:06,540 --> 01:44:06,940
Sorry.

2128
01:44:06,940 --> 01:44:07,980
I don't remember off the top of my head.

2129
01:44:07,980 --> 01:44:09,020
It's cause I have both.

2130
01:44:09,020 --> 01:44:12,060
It's one of the X-Box things you can get three months of discord nitro.

2131
01:44:12,860 --> 01:44:14,380
So you can like boost the box server.

2132
01:44:14,380 --> 01:44:16,220
No, we need a lot of boost to get to the next level.

2133
01:44:16,220 --> 01:44:18,860
But, uh, but, and it goes the other way around too.

2134
01:44:18,860 --> 01:44:22,220
If you have discord nitro, you can get free X-Box game pass for

2135
01:44:22,220 --> 01:44:23,500
like three months or something like that.

2136
01:44:23,500 --> 01:44:25,420
So, um, yeah, check that out.

2137
01:44:25,420 --> 01:44:26,540
It's game pass ultimate.

2138
01:44:26,540 --> 01:44:26,940
Thank you.

2139
01:44:27,820 --> 01:44:28,860
So check that out.

2140
01:44:28,860 --> 01:44:31,100
If you're on one or the other, the discord or X-Box thing.

2141
01:44:31,100 --> 01:44:32,860
Cause that is a thing that's pretty nice.

2142
01:44:32,860 --> 01:44:36,380
So, uh, and one month of EA access through the X-Box thing as well.

2143
01:44:36,380 --> 01:44:36,700
That's right.

2144
01:44:36,700 --> 01:44:38,060
I need to turn that on.

2145
01:44:38,060 --> 01:44:40,700
I'm trying to think what's on EA access that might want to play, but I'm

2146
01:44:40,700 --> 01:44:42,700
sure there's probably the new need for speed game actually.

2147
01:44:42,700 --> 01:44:43,660
I'd check that out.

2148
01:44:43,660 --> 01:44:44,460
So cool.

2149
01:44:45,660 --> 01:44:46,380
All right.

2150
01:44:46,380 --> 01:44:47,900
Um, let's move on.

2151
01:44:47,900 --> 01:44:49,980
And, uh, dark soccer, you have some rapid fire news too.

2152
01:44:50,540 --> 01:44:50,940
I do.

2153
01:44:51,740 --> 01:44:56,460
Um, so, uh, and Dan and I actually watched this and we were all kind of

2154
01:44:56,460 --> 01:44:57,100
giddy about it.

2155
01:44:57,900 --> 01:45:00,140
New stern pinball stranger things.

2156
01:45:00,140 --> 01:45:01,900
Did you watch the preview?

2157
01:45:03,340 --> 01:45:05,260
No, they had the premium version up there.

2158
01:45:05,260 --> 01:45:05,660
Oh my God.

2159
01:45:05,660 --> 01:45:06,700
The play field is great.

2160
01:45:06,700 --> 01:45:09,740
It has a, like a drive-in projection screen on it.

2161
01:45:09,740 --> 01:45:11,660
I was asked how did, do they do the upside down?

2162
01:45:11,660 --> 01:45:13,420
Do they do like a creature from black lagoon?

2163
01:45:13,500 --> 01:45:18,140
So you get like, there's, I think it's one of the modes, um, where the screen

2164
01:45:18,140 --> 01:45:22,620
actually breaks apart and there's like the portal behind it that you have to

2165
01:45:22,620 --> 01:45:28,540
shoot the, um, uh, the balls into like the, almost like the, the mouth entrance

2166
01:45:28,540 --> 01:45:30,300
into the upside down.

2167
01:45:31,100 --> 01:45:35,500
And then you have like the ball catch on the back wall is magnetic.

2168
01:45:36,060 --> 01:45:37,980
It is fucking sweet.

2169
01:45:37,980 --> 01:45:42,860
So you lock your balls on a magnetic catch on the back wall and they sit on

2170
01:45:42,860 --> 01:45:44,060
the side of the wall.

2171
01:45:44,060 --> 01:45:45,900
And then when multi ball starts, it releases them.

2172
01:45:45,900 --> 01:45:50,780
I think they're showing a premium on the preview, but I mean, the animation

2173
01:45:50,780 --> 01:45:51,740
was great.

2174
01:45:51,740 --> 01:45:55,740
Um, you get that ramp that's used to attack the demogorgon when it goes to

2175
01:45:55,740 --> 01:45:56,700
swallow the pinball.

2176
01:45:57,340 --> 01:46:01,580
Um, and the, uh, the projection that goes out also animates different

2177
01:46:01,580 --> 01:46:04,140
targets, including some pop-ups spinner.

2178
01:46:04,700 --> 01:46:06,860
And it's just really, really involved.

2179
01:46:06,860 --> 01:46:08,700
I really think stern is doing great.

2180
01:46:08,700 --> 01:46:10,940
I just want to see who the designer is.

2181
01:46:10,940 --> 01:46:13,740
Um, Bobby's actually saying in chat, my friend who I'm assuming must've

2182
01:46:13,740 --> 01:46:16,220
worked on this is really upset because it's actually leaked.

2183
01:46:16,220 --> 01:46:19,260
They were all under embargo and some ass hat posted the trailer on their

2184
01:46:19,260 --> 01:46:22,300
personal YouTube channel and all the other outlets ran with it.

2185
01:46:22,300 --> 01:46:22,620
Yeah.

2186
01:46:22,620 --> 01:46:25,660
It's been removed from the link I have here.

2187
01:46:25,660 --> 01:46:28,460
Once on the internet, always on the internet, at least the reception is

2188
01:46:28,460 --> 01:46:29,340
really positive.

2189
01:46:29,340 --> 01:46:32,220
So that's, you know, a small plus for what it's worth.

2190
01:46:32,220 --> 01:46:35,340
Well, and the thing about is that having that little leak actually makes

2191
01:46:35,340 --> 01:46:37,580
me way more excited.

2192
01:46:37,580 --> 01:46:39,580
I'm really looking forward to this one.

2193
01:46:39,580 --> 01:46:41,500
It might end up being one that we get in our house.

2194
01:46:42,140 --> 01:46:46,780
You know, I mean, I probably would still like a black knight sort of rage

2195
01:46:46,780 --> 01:46:50,220
just a little bit more because, you know, Steve worked really hard on it.

2196
01:46:50,220 --> 01:46:51,740
And Steve Richie is a great guy.

2197
01:46:52,380 --> 01:46:54,940
Um, I just want to know though, who the main designer for this was.

2198
01:46:54,940 --> 01:46:56,060
Cause I'm not seeing anything.

2199
01:46:56,700 --> 01:46:59,900
Um, Oh, Bobby says the friend works for a media site.

2200
01:46:59,900 --> 01:47:04,540
He had a real preview in the works for the clicks, but it, somebody under,

2201
01:47:04,540 --> 01:47:05,900
Oh, so it was under embargo.

2202
01:47:05,900 --> 01:47:06,300
I get it.

2203
01:47:06,300 --> 01:47:09,740
So somebody, somebody cut all the other, uh, press outlets off the

2204
01:47:09,740 --> 01:47:11,420
kneecaps, basically by leaking it to YouTube.

2205
01:47:11,420 --> 01:47:11,820
I get it.

2206
01:47:11,820 --> 01:47:13,020
Yeah, yikes.

2207
01:47:13,660 --> 01:47:15,900
But at any rate though, it looks amazing.

2208
01:47:15,900 --> 01:47:20,220
It really is like, this is what pinball has come to.

2209
01:47:20,220 --> 01:47:21,660
And I'm quite pleased with it.

2210
01:47:22,300 --> 01:47:25,020
You know, this is pretty cool.

2211
01:47:25,020 --> 01:47:26,140
This is honestly enough.

2212
01:47:26,140 --> 01:47:29,740
What I think pinball 2000 should have been.

2213
01:47:29,740 --> 01:47:34,140
I mean the video screen aspect to it was pretty cool, but I like having

2214
01:47:34,140 --> 01:47:35,820
these more interactive elements.

2215
01:47:36,300 --> 01:47:39,660
You know, for example, like dialed in, had its cell phone on there and

2216
01:47:39,660 --> 01:47:45,100
everything, and you had like the, the video game, like the Tron game on,

2217
01:47:45,100 --> 01:47:47,020
on the play field and everything.

2218
01:47:47,020 --> 01:47:51,580
I love this interactive, um, you know, element that changes its dynamic for

2219
01:47:51,580 --> 01:47:53,100
every gameplay is going to be different.

2220
01:47:53,660 --> 01:47:55,820
And I'm really, really super excited about it.

2221
01:47:55,820 --> 01:47:57,180
I think it's going to be amazing.

2222
01:47:57,180 --> 01:47:57,680
Cool.

2223
01:47:58,460 --> 01:47:58,960
All right.

2224
01:47:59,420 --> 01:48:00,380
And one more, right?

2225
01:48:00,380 --> 01:48:00,880
Yeah.

2226
01:48:01,120 --> 01:48:06,480
So the soundtracks for Soul Blade and Soul Calibur are, um, streamable now.

2227
01:48:07,280 --> 01:48:12,160
So it looks like that you can, I mean, get them on pretty much any

2228
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:18,080
service, Apple Music, Spotify, YouTube, you name it, Napster's still around

2229
01:48:18,080 --> 01:48:18,580
shit.

2230
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:23,600
But you look for Namco sounds and that's the series that it's under.

2231
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:26,080
We had the Soul Blade soundtrack.

2232
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:27,280
We have this little caliber soundtrack.

2233
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:27,840
Come to think of it.

2234
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:32,080
We had them on CD, but that was like that whole Edge of Soul long version

2235
01:48:32,080 --> 01:48:33,520
was so amazing.

2236
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:34,240
It was so good.

2237
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:37,600
But yeah, um, go get them.

2238
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:38,100
They're free.

2239
01:48:38,720 --> 01:48:40,800
Well, free with your rental of the service.

2240
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:45,200
So, um, I think like if you, if you had like Soul Calibur 2, like Brave Edge,

2241
01:48:45,200 --> 01:48:48,320
Braver Soul, I think is the name of it shows up in a lot of other Namco games

2242
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:51,200
like music, it was a Tyco, Nutatrician song and all that good stuff.

2243
01:48:51,200 --> 01:48:51,700
Yeah.

2244
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
And that series always had an Epic soundtrack to it.

2245
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:57,520
So, uh, now you can have Epic music for when you're driving down the freeway.

2246
01:48:57,600 --> 01:49:01,040
Don't get me driving with Edge of Soul playing because I will speed.

2247
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:01,540
All right.

2248
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:05,840
Uh, last chance to, uh, if you're participating live, uh, Twitch is your

2249
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:08,320
last chance to contribute to the community gift chest.

2250
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:11,360
Uh, I'm going to ask Bobby to hit the button after we're done with release

2251
01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:13,040
dates to make it rain.

2252
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:16,880
So that'll be, uh, after we, um, do this in a minute there.

2253
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:20,960
So, um, all right, let's move on to release dates.

2254
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:22,640
And I think this will be a quick segment here.

2255
01:49:22,640 --> 01:49:27,280
So, uh, Loki, you don't say, uh, so this week we only have one game coming

2256
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:32,960
out and it's brain age, Nintendo switch training in the U S on in the U S.

2257
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:36,400
I didn't know they ever confirmed that that was even happening in the U S.

2258
01:49:37,600 --> 01:49:38,480
Apparently it is.

2259
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:38,800
Sorry.

2260
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:40,000
I just got excited for a minute.

2261
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,280
There was brain age games were fun.

2262
01:49:41,280 --> 01:49:42,400
They were silly, but they were fun.

2263
01:49:43,120 --> 01:49:43,600
Wow.

2264
01:49:43,600 --> 01:49:44,240
Okay, cool.

2265
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:46,160
I didn't know what was happening here.

2266
01:49:46,160 --> 01:49:46,660
That's great.

2267
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:47,520
All right.

2268
01:49:47,520 --> 01:49:51,120
Well, let's, let's travel to Japan and check out what else is coming out there.

2269
01:49:51,120 --> 01:49:54,560
So, um, there are a few more releases in Japan cause it's a little, little

2270
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:56,400
different, uh, the way the holidays work.

2271
01:49:56,400 --> 01:50:02,000
So, uh, on, uh, we get the brain training in Japan as well on December 27th.

2272
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,400
That is the thing that's happening on December 25th.

2273
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:06,880
You can check out at layer dusk trilogy, deluxe packs.

2274
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:09,280
Maybe it's only gonna be like digital over here or something like that.

2275
01:50:09,280 --> 01:50:10,240
Yeah, maybe that's the deal.

2276
01:50:10,240 --> 01:50:11,040
I don't know.

2277
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:14,080
So anyway, but those are, those are the big releases on the switch this week.

2278
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:17,120
And then if we look at the PlayStation four, uh, on the PlayStation four,

2279
01:50:17,120 --> 01:50:21,040
those at layer games, uh, and the trilogy pack that is also happening in Japan

2280
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:21,680
this week.

2281
01:50:21,680 --> 01:50:22,880
So it is a slower week.

2282
01:50:22,880 --> 01:50:25,600
I mean, they still, they still, they have Christmas in Japan.

2283
01:50:25,600 --> 01:50:29,840
It's just not quite like the, the whole entire world stops.

2284
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:31,920
Like it does here in Japan, right?

2285
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:33,760
It's more of, it's, it's a cake celebration, right?

2286
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:34,560
There's a Christmas cake.

2287
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:35,520
Yeah.

2288
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:38,000
Like a strawberry white cake.

2289
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:38,400
Yes.

2290
01:50:38,400 --> 01:50:39,200
It looks delicious.

2291
01:50:39,200 --> 01:50:40,160
I'd love to have a Christmas cake.

2292
01:50:40,720 --> 01:50:41,200
Anyhow.

2293
01:50:41,200 --> 01:50:43,040
Um, how about the UK dark soccer?

2294
01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:45,280
No, like seriously?

2295
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:47,200
No, nothing coming out in the UK.

2296
01:50:47,200 --> 01:50:51,920
No, nothing on there until January 2nd, which is brain training.

2297
01:50:51,920 --> 01:50:58,400
Uh, and Akuma JP is actually in chat saying, uh, yes, no holiday.

2298
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:02,560
And then G GTR says it's kind of big in Japan, especially with KFC.

2299
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:04,720
So I wonder if it's one of those things where like,

2300
01:51:04,720 --> 01:51:07,600
they're just playing into the rest of the world.

2301
01:51:07,600 --> 01:51:07,840
Yeah.

2302
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:09,440
It's like a marketing type of thing.

2303
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:13,920
Kind of like, I'm trying to think of an equivalent that we do in the Cinco de Mayo.

2304
01:51:16,160 --> 01:51:16,480
Right.

2305
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:18,160
But KFC is a thing.

2306
01:51:18,160 --> 01:51:18,960
Yeah, no, I know.

2307
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:19,840
And Christmas cake.

2308
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:20,240
I know.

2309
01:51:20,240 --> 01:51:21,280
That's what we should do.

2310
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:23,920
Let's have KFC Christmas.

2311
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:24,560
On Christmas.

2312
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:25,840
Is that even open?

2313
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:30,560
We'll get, well, you know what I would prefer though to KFC would be Jollibee.

2314
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:32,640
Jollibee is fucking amazing.

2315
01:51:32,640 --> 01:51:33,840
Isn't there a Jollibee in Elk Grove?

2316
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:34,240
Yeah.

2317
01:51:34,240 --> 01:51:35,120
Um, South sack.

2318
01:51:35,120 --> 01:51:36,000
You have to see if it's open.

2319
01:51:36,720 --> 01:51:40,080
I used to, when I would have to go to the doctor, I would actually go pick up my lunch

2320
01:51:40,080 --> 01:51:41,840
from Jollibee and go to work with it.

2321
01:51:41,840 --> 01:51:42,080
Okay.

2322
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:47,440
So I would have to say the, uh, the only equivalent I can think of that would be Cinco de Mayo.

2323
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:50,960
It's not a holiday at all here, but we completely appropriate it

2324
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:52,960
and fuck it up and fuck it up.

2325
01:51:52,960 --> 01:51:58,880
And it's just, it becomes tequila holiday and all this, you know, that's, that's

2326
01:51:58,880 --> 01:51:59,920
to quote the meme.

2327
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:04,320
Do you ever go what the fuck white people, even though you are white people?

2328
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:04,880
Oh, you know what?

2329
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:06,080
Act F just mentioned this too.

2330
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:09,680
It's Cinco de Mayo is like, not even that big a holiday in Mexico either.

2331
01:52:09,680 --> 01:52:11,920
Well, honestly, it's like Hanukkah.

2332
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:13,440
Hanukkah is not a fucking big holiday.

2333
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:14,960
It's not even in Torah.

2334
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:15,600
No, you're right.

2335
01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:15,920
You're right.

2336
01:52:15,920 --> 01:52:17,040
That's a good example.

2337
01:52:17,200 --> 01:52:26,640
An apocryphal tale in the tale of the Maccabees, but it's culturally significant because it

2338
01:52:26,640 --> 01:52:29,280
had to do with reclaiming the temple from Rome.

2339
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:30,960
So just saying.

2340
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:32,720
Well, and it's also, I mean, let's be real.

2341
01:52:32,720 --> 01:52:35,600
It's also so that the Jewish kids don't feel left out on Christmas.

2342
01:52:35,600 --> 01:52:37,920
That's a big part of made a big deal because of that.

2343
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:38,480
Yeah.

2344
01:52:38,480 --> 01:52:38,720
Yeah.

2345
01:52:38,720 --> 01:52:42,800
I don't know if that game's coming out in the U S now because I even looked on, it made

2346
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:43,440
me curious.

2347
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:47,200
I checked on Nintendo site and they only even listed as a title coming out.

2348
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:47,360
Okay.

2349
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:51,600
So maybe somehow because it's, it's snuck onto that list because it's coming down the

2350
01:52:51,600 --> 01:52:54,160
UK though on the 3rd of January.

2351
01:52:54,160 --> 01:52:54,560
Huh?

2352
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:55,040
Interesting.

2353
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:56,500
All right.

2354
01:52:57,280 --> 01:52:57,760
Okay.

2355
01:52:57,760 --> 01:52:59,680
Well, uh, that's it for release dates.

2356
01:52:59,680 --> 01:53:01,520
So, uh, Bobby, make it rain, please.

2357
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:04,480
When you hear this message and we'll give out those gifts in the community gift chest.

2358
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:08,800
So enjoy for those illegal legends players, I'm sure, uh, you guys will appreciate that.

2359
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:09,200
Okay.

2360
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:11,200
So let's go to the mailbag every week.

2361
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:15,280
You guys send us emails, participate at orange lounge trader.com is the place to send us

And I think we have one or two tonight.

2364
01:53:18,720 --> 01:53:23,040
One, which I'm trying to get back to you because I'm now explaining Hanukkah to people.

2365
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:31,200
Um, so, uh, we have one from Martin from Belgium, who we haven't heard from for a long time.

2366
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:35,360
Um, hello, Martin from Belgium, Belgium here.

2367
01:53:35,360 --> 01:53:39,600
I just wanted to wish you all a happy belated 800th birthday.

2368
01:53:40,240 --> 01:53:40,720
Thank you.

2369
01:53:40,720 --> 01:53:44,320
I have to say, I really appreciate you guys always being there on the podcast to cheer

2370
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:45,520
up my Monday mornings.

2371
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:49,200
Listening to the podcast was like comfort food for my ears, especially when I'm having

2372
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:50,240
a bad day.

2373
01:53:50,240 --> 01:53:51,040
Thank you so much.

2374
01:53:51,040 --> 01:53:52,400
And keep up the great work.

2375
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:53,920
Martin from Belgium.

2376
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:55,040
I like seeing his name.

2377
01:53:55,040 --> 01:53:56,160
That's no question.

2378
01:53:56,160 --> 01:53:58,640
No, no, just, just, just feel love.

2379
01:53:58,640 --> 01:53:59,120
Thank you.

2380
01:53:59,920 --> 01:54:02,160
Well, that is a, that is a holiday gift in itself.

2381
01:54:02,160 --> 01:54:02,800
Thank you so much.

2382
01:54:03,440 --> 01:54:04,320
And that's it.

2383
01:54:04,320 --> 01:54:05,120
No more emails.

2384
01:54:05,120 --> 01:54:05,520
Wow.

2385
01:54:05,520 --> 01:54:06,000
All right.

2386
01:54:07,040 --> 01:54:08,400
Are you going to have some of his that's nuts?

2387
01:54:08,400 --> 01:54:10,240
I was going to have some of his that's nuts.

2388
01:54:10,240 --> 01:54:10,480
Yeah.

2389
01:54:10,480 --> 01:54:10,960
They're good.

2390
01:54:10,960 --> 01:54:11,920
They're delicious nuts.

2391
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:12,720
All right.

2392
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:18,240
Anyway, uh, for those in the podcast, he's actually got the little bag of, uh, they're,

2393
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:20,080
they're candy pecans in reality, right?

2394
01:54:20,080 --> 01:54:20,880
They're praline pecans.

2395
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:21,280
Or excuse you.

2396
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:22,080
Yeah, pralines.

2397
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:22,720
It's the time.

2398
01:54:22,720 --> 01:54:26,480
It's basically, it's like a pie without the crust is really what it and the gooeyness.

2399
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:27,520
Yeah, exactly.

2400
01:54:27,520 --> 01:54:29,840
I am still working on my latkes by the way.

2401
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:30,160
Yeah.

2402
01:54:30,160 --> 01:54:33,120
That's how long it takes me to eat anything now is good stuff.

2403
01:54:33,120 --> 01:54:35,440
Anyway, I feel so fat.

2404
01:54:35,440 --> 01:54:36,240
All right, let's move on.

2405
01:54:36,240 --> 01:54:39,360
We got some more news to get to, and then we'll see if anyone wants to call in via our

2406
01:54:39,360 --> 01:54:43,040
discord server over at vognetwork.com slash discord.

2407
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:45,280
So whoops, I've been slacking off on the sidebar there.

2408
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:46,800
So we're done with release dates.

2409
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:47,840
We're done with the mailbag.

2410
01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:49,200
Let's get to the next story.

2411
01:54:49,200 --> 01:54:49,680
Loki.

2412
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:50,640
All right.

2413
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:56,240
This is a pretty cool, like unnecessary update, but it's something that was added to No Man's

2414
01:54:56,240 --> 01:55:03,760
Sky and it's these little music synthesizers that you can actually put your own music in.

2415
01:55:04,640 --> 01:55:10,240
So basically it allows you to kind of, um, make different musical tracks.

2416
01:55:11,600 --> 01:55:12,560
The hell are you doing over there?

2417
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:13,440
I'm hoarding the nuts.

2418
01:55:14,400 --> 01:55:15,520
Fondling the nuts over there.

2419
01:55:16,480 --> 01:55:25,200
Um, so you can actually kind of, um, actually put out your own set of, um, chords and stuff

2420
01:55:25,200 --> 01:55:27,200
in there to be able to make your own tracks.

2421
01:55:27,200 --> 01:55:30,720
And then you can link several of them together to actually make music.

2422
01:55:30,720 --> 01:55:33,280
So Pete, that's what people have been doing is making music with them.

2423
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:38,560
And then on top of that, you can also wire them to different lights and effects to kind

2424
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:40,160
of synchronize everything.

2425
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:46,480
And so of course people have used it to like make all sorts of, um, you know, cool music

2426
01:55:46,480 --> 01:55:46,960
things.

2427
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:53,520
They've also done like little like dance club type stuff in there, but it's pretty sweet

2428
01:55:53,520 --> 01:55:54,800
and free.

2429
01:55:55,440 --> 01:55:56,880
Can't complain with free.

2430
01:55:56,880 --> 01:56:00,560
So it'd be interesting how creative people get with this.

2431
01:56:00,560 --> 01:56:02,560
My how far this game has come.

2432
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:03,120
Yeah.

2433
01:56:03,120 --> 01:56:08,720
I mean, talk about a story of the decade of sorts, you know, just the, this game coming

2434
01:56:08,720 --> 01:56:11,280
out and it's just the whipping boy, the entire community.

2435
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:16,080
And now the place that it's at is just, you know, this big supreme creative outlet.

2436
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:17,280
It's so interesting.

2437
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:19,600
So I need to get back in.

2438
01:56:19,600 --> 01:56:23,040
I keep seeing it in my steam library, taunting me, like, come play this.

2439
01:56:23,040 --> 01:56:23,360
Oh yeah.

2440
01:56:23,360 --> 01:56:25,360
I bought that on steam too.

2441
01:56:25,360 --> 01:56:26,000
Get in on that.

2442
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:27,280
Cause I forgot all about it.

2443
01:56:27,280 --> 01:56:29,680
Alan was playing it hella for a little bit too.

2444
01:56:29,680 --> 01:56:32,800
And, um, the two of us have our little bases on a planet somewhere.

2445
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:35,760
So, um, come find us in the universe.

2446
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:36,400
We're somewhere.

2447
01:56:37,040 --> 01:56:37,360
All right.

2448
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:39,200
Oh yeah.

2449
01:56:39,200 --> 01:56:40,640
I forgot about that too.

2450
01:56:40,640 --> 01:56:40,880
Hmm.

2451
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:42,160
Oh wow.

2452
01:56:42,160 --> 01:56:45,920
All these games that like, Hey, you bought this back here and you haven't really played

2453
01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:47,920
it like mosh pit simulator.

2454
01:56:47,920 --> 01:56:49,040
Totally forgot about that.

2455
01:56:49,040 --> 01:56:50,720
Oh, how steam tells you about all the games.

2456
01:56:50,720 --> 01:56:51,440
DuckTales or Mastered.

2457
01:56:51,440 --> 01:56:53,840
Don't remember buying that, but I have it.

2458
01:56:54,640 --> 01:56:55,760
There's no man's sky.

2459
01:56:56,880 --> 01:56:57,360
There you go.

2460
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:02,400
Well, a game that I know you've been a little better about playing is Pokemon go.

2461
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:05,840
And, uh, we have some information about things that have updated in Pokemon go.

2462
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:10,560
So if you haven't played that in a little while, you might've missed a few things.

2463
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:15,520
Uh, the big holiday edition that they put into the game was expanding the buddy adventure.

2464
01:57:16,080 --> 01:57:19,760
So now you no longer just walk your buddy for candy.

2465
01:57:19,760 --> 01:57:24,960
Your buddy plays a role basically with you and you can actually, uh, feed them berries.

2466
01:57:25,200 --> 01:57:26,080
And it'll grow.

2467
01:57:26,080 --> 01:57:27,280
They'll get hearts from that.

2468
01:57:27,920 --> 01:57:30,960
And you increase your friendship level with the buddy Pokemon.

2469
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:33,760
And as you increase that level, you get certain perks.

2470
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:37,920
For example, the Pokemon may try to help you catch Pokemon in the wild.

2471
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:41,200
Uh, your buddy Pokemon will also increase its CP.

2472
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:45,120
So, but you have to get, you have to get a really, you have to get a four star buddy

2473
01:57:45,120 --> 01:57:49,440
for that to actually happen for you to actually get an increased in the amount that they battle.

2474
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:50,720
But you can do all sorts of things.

2475
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:53,840
You can take the buddy into AR mode and you play with it by like,

2476
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:56,240
by just like doing like scratching under its chin or whatever.

2477
01:57:56,240 --> 01:57:58,480
And it will be happy and reward you with hearts.

2478
01:57:58,480 --> 01:58:00,960
Uh, and it'll follow you around on the map too, which is really cool.

2479
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:04,480
So it's kind of a throwback to, um, when Pikachu would follow you around.

2480
01:58:04,480 --> 01:58:10,000
But have a really shitty buddy right now that I was walking with just to get some more candies.

2481
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:10,240
Yeah.

2482
01:58:10,240 --> 01:58:14,960
That's the only bummer is that now I'm not walking stuff to get candy to evolve anymore.

2483
01:58:14,960 --> 01:58:18,560
Now I'm like, Oh, I want to walk my a hundred percent Tyranitar.

2484
01:58:18,560 --> 01:58:21,760
So when I need to sub them in, he'll have that increased CP.

2485
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:24,240
That's that's what I'm doing now.

2486
01:58:24,240 --> 01:58:26,160
So, um, yeah, that's kind of a fun thing.

2487
01:58:26,160 --> 01:58:27,840
But then what I think is also really cool.

2488
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:30,160
And this just came out within the past couple days.

2489
01:58:30,800 --> 01:58:34,400
Now they have a, um, this whole thing, this AR kit.

2490
01:58:34,400 --> 01:58:39,360
And I haven't been able to play with this yet, but apparently now you can take pictures

2491
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:45,680
of your buddy and your buddy's buddy at the same time in the same space.

2492
01:58:45,680 --> 01:58:49,520
So it's like AR plus where now, so I guess, you know, when you're starting to see some of this

2493
01:58:49,520 --> 01:58:52,880
in your Minecraft earth as you're playing it, is that the things you're doing can affect other

2494
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:53,520
people too.

2495
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:56,720
So now Pokemon go is doing that a little bit with the Pokemon.

2496
01:58:56,720 --> 01:58:58,560
So that's really cool.

2497
01:58:58,560 --> 01:58:59,680
So yeah.

2498
01:58:59,680 --> 01:59:03,520
And there's a whole little trailer and that shows off the buddy adventures.

2499
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:07,920
And it honestly makes the world look like detective Pikachu where everybody has it because

2500
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:08,160
right.

2501
01:59:08,160 --> 01:59:11,280
And detective Pikachu, like everybody has a buddy Pokemon, right?

2502
01:59:11,280 --> 01:59:17,200
So, um, if you could pick any Pokemon as your buddy, Pokemon IRL, who would your buddy

2503
01:59:17,200 --> 01:59:17,760
Pokemon be?

2504
01:59:18,640 --> 01:59:19,200
I don't know.

2505
01:59:19,760 --> 01:59:20,720
Espeon.

2506
01:59:20,720 --> 01:59:21,280
Espeon.

2507
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:21,840
Oh, good pick.

2508
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:22,080
Why?

2509
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:23,760
Because it's pretty.

2510
01:59:24,400 --> 01:59:28,320
Although I do like Makuhita who I would just like take a nap on.

2511
01:59:29,600 --> 01:59:30,560
So yeah, Espeon.

2512
01:59:31,200 --> 01:59:34,400
Um, honestly it's hard to not say Jigglypuff.

2513
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:38,640
Like I just, I, I relate with Jigglypuff on a, on a scale.

2514
01:59:38,640 --> 01:59:40,560
So I think Jigglypuff would be mine.

2515
01:59:41,280 --> 01:59:43,280
I'm looking in com, uh, chat for some comments.

2516
01:59:43,280 --> 01:59:45,120
VGRealness says Butterfree.

2517
01:59:45,120 --> 01:59:46,960
ActDeaf says Vulpix.

2518
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:51,840
Akuma says Kabigon, which I don't know which one that translates to in the US.

2519
01:59:53,040 --> 01:59:54,960
Bonds006 says Geodude.

2520
01:59:56,800 --> 01:59:59,360
Bobby Blackwolf says, I'm still walking a Magikarp.

2521
01:59:59,360 --> 02:00:02,320
Hey Mag, I've seen people use Magikarp as their buddy.

2522
02:00:02,320 --> 02:00:07,680
You know, increase that friendship level and then evolve it into a, um, uh, not a super

2523
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:08,320
Magikarp.

2524
02:00:08,320 --> 02:00:09,360
Kabigon is Snorlax.

2525
02:00:09,360 --> 02:00:10,080
Gyarados.

2526
02:00:10,080 --> 02:00:10,960
Thank you, Gyarados.

2527
02:00:10,960 --> 02:00:11,920
Why can't I remember?

2528
02:00:11,920 --> 02:00:14,560
Kabigon is, uh, Snorlax.

2529
02:00:14,560 --> 02:00:16,160
Snorlax is super cute too.

2530
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:20,800
I have a hundred percent Snorlax and that'll probably be the one I do after, um, my Tyranitar.

2531
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:23,760
Did you see that big Snorlax, uh, beanbag bed?

2532
02:00:23,760 --> 02:00:24,480
Yes.

2533
02:00:24,480 --> 02:00:24,800
Want.

2534
02:00:25,680 --> 02:00:26,240
So cute.

2535
02:00:27,360 --> 02:00:27,760
All right.

2536
02:00:29,280 --> 02:00:31,120
Anyhow, those are some updates in Pokemon Go.

2537
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:32,640
Dark Sakura.

2538
02:00:33,440 --> 02:00:36,560
This, this game just keeps delivering week after week.

2539
02:00:36,560 --> 02:00:36,960
Literally.

2540
02:00:36,960 --> 02:00:38,320
It keeps on giving.

2541
02:00:38,320 --> 02:00:40,000
We just talked about this last week.

2542
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:40,480
We did.

2543
02:00:40,480 --> 02:00:43,680
So that's why I wanted to bring it up again, but more.

2544
02:00:45,600 --> 02:00:53,600
So, um, Lance McDonald, modern extreme, has finally gotten us out of the endless hallway

2545
02:00:53,600 --> 02:00:57,440
of PT and took us onto the streets of Silent Hill.

2546
02:00:58,480 --> 02:01:04,880
So, um, which, I mean, he's the same one who brought up the stuff that you talked about

2547
02:01:04,880 --> 02:01:11,040
last week about Lisa following you and that you are playing as Norman Reedus as a character,

2548
02:01:11,040 --> 02:01:16,240
you know, but to do what he did, there were a few discoveries in there.

2549
02:01:16,240 --> 02:01:18,160
I've watched the video a couple of times last night.

2550
02:01:18,160 --> 02:01:21,440
There's some really just cool stuff going on with it.

2551
02:01:21,440 --> 02:01:30,000
So what happens is, um, the, the, the, the hallway and the, the town exists on two different

2552
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:35,760
maps and your link is going to be from that main little room that you start off with.

2553
02:01:35,760 --> 02:01:44,320
So what he did was rekey that intro room, that, that basement room to, um, let you out onto

2554
02:01:44,320 --> 02:01:45,200
the streets.

2555
02:01:45,200 --> 02:01:48,640
Now the first discovery is that the floor has no collision detection.

2556
02:01:48,640 --> 02:01:51,040
You fall right through it, but guess what happens?

2557
02:01:51,040 --> 02:01:52,320
Lisa comes and eats you.

2558
02:01:53,040 --> 02:01:55,280
Like what happens if she catches you in the house.

2559
02:01:55,840 --> 02:02:00,240
So it's, I guess to prevent you from like, if you inadvertently ended up on the map by

2560
02:02:00,240 --> 02:02:04,800
some glitch, you know, other than doing it on purpose, then it's to prevent your game

2561
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:06,160
from soft locking or whatever.

2562
02:02:06,960 --> 02:02:12,800
So, um, the other, so what he did is he programmed in like a float so that your character floats

2563
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:13,680
above the ground.

2564
02:02:13,680 --> 02:02:19,920
So you go out and on the street and it's just really exploring just how highly detailed

2565
02:02:19,920 --> 02:02:20,640
these streets are.

2566
02:02:20,720 --> 02:02:26,000
Like you do get like behind a van and some of the cars are textured as well, but like

2567
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:31,680
he floated up to the balcony and showed a full street scene and it was just really intense.

2568
02:02:31,680 --> 02:02:36,720
I mean, and it's a good, like three blocks of distance that's rendered.

2569
02:02:36,720 --> 02:02:37,120
Yeah.

2570
02:02:37,120 --> 02:02:41,360
And your final barrier is like literally a fence at the end of it.

2571
02:02:41,360 --> 02:02:45,120
Although it looks like you can go around the fence, but it's a full, it's a full game

2572
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:45,520
barrier.

2573
02:02:46,080 --> 02:02:50,000
But, um, it's, it's also interesting because it points out that that trailer you essentially

2574
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:53,120
see at the end of the game is being rendered in re in the game engine.

2575
02:02:53,120 --> 02:02:54,720
It's not like a cut scene or something.

2576
02:02:54,720 --> 02:02:59,040
And on top of that, you have that blood trail right at the beginning of it.

2577
02:02:59,040 --> 02:03:02,160
It has, um, a lot of clutter in the environment.

2578
02:03:02,160 --> 02:03:03,600
So it's like all these props.

2579
02:03:04,240 --> 02:03:11,360
It made me think that this was actually part of what was actually started to be rendered

2580
02:03:11,360 --> 02:03:12,560
for Silent Hills for sure.

2581
02:03:12,560 --> 02:03:15,760
And Bobby in chat says they were probably building that out for the full game.

2582
02:03:15,760 --> 02:03:16,260
Absolutely.

2583
02:03:17,140 --> 02:03:23,460
Uh, it's definitely worth everyone finding that, that trailer and watching it, but it

2584
02:03:23,460 --> 02:03:25,380
was found by Lance McDonald.

2585
02:03:25,380 --> 02:03:29,300
The, um, uh, handle on Twitter is man fight dragon.

2586
02:03:30,500 --> 02:03:37,460
And, um, one of the things is that someone asked him how many jumpscares did Lisa get

2587
02:03:37,460 --> 02:03:39,060
with you for the making of this video?

2588
02:03:39,620 --> 02:03:42,020
And his response was she does the jump scare.

2589
02:03:42,020 --> 02:03:45,860
Anytime you mess with the player location without applying a special fix to make the

2590
02:03:45,860 --> 02:03:47,460
game think you're on the ground.

2591
02:03:47,460 --> 02:03:48,180
It's hard to predict.

2592
02:03:48,180 --> 02:03:51,780
And I screamed multiple times while getting a few of the overhead camera shots for the

2593
02:03:51,780 --> 02:03:52,280
video.

2594
02:03:53,220 --> 02:03:57,300
That's interesting that they kind of built in the Lisa thing, like just in case someone

2595
02:03:57,300 --> 02:04:00,500
got out, but somebody kind of found a work around that.

2596
02:04:00,500 --> 02:04:01,540
That's really neat.

2597
02:04:01,540 --> 02:04:01,780
Yeah.

2598
02:04:01,780 --> 02:04:04,180
It's still freaking creeps me out though, man.

2599
02:04:04,180 --> 02:04:06,900
And everybody still wonders like, where is this game?

2600
02:04:06,900 --> 02:04:09,860
We never did get to see, you know, it's just, it's sad.

2601
02:04:09,860 --> 02:04:11,780
Well, it's on made, it's on made.

2602
02:04:11,780 --> 02:04:12,660
So it's sad.

2603
02:04:13,460 --> 02:04:20,020
What I would like to see is that instead of having, cause I think that the, um, I don't

2604
02:04:20,020 --> 02:04:24,580
know if people are actually able to pull legit assets for it, for the Mac and PC, you know,

2605
02:04:24,580 --> 02:04:31,140
simulations of PT that they did, but I would like for people to pull more of these resources

2606
02:04:31,140 --> 02:04:33,060
and actually like make something with it.

2607
02:04:33,060 --> 02:04:33,860
It would be nice.

2608
02:04:33,860 --> 02:04:39,620
You know, I, this is what could have been, and my hope is that whatever this horror thing

2609
02:04:39,620 --> 02:04:44,420
that Kojima has in mind, that it's going to be a true spiritual successor to the silent

2610
02:04:44,420 --> 02:04:46,180
Hill franchise called Konami will Sue.

2611
02:04:47,380 --> 02:04:50,100
Well, I mean, and I talked about this already on the show, so I don't want to repeat myself

2612
02:04:50,100 --> 02:04:55,460
too much, but I just want it to be true that Konami is just gonna realize that there's

2613
02:04:55,460 --> 02:04:59,300
more money to be had by just letting somebody else borrow the IP and make a good game with

2614
02:04:59,300 --> 02:05:01,300
it and just trying to mend the fences and make it happen.

2615
02:05:01,300 --> 02:05:03,620
But I'm not going to hold my breath either.

2616
02:05:03,620 --> 02:05:05,940
There is, there's a lot more drama.

2617
02:05:05,940 --> 02:05:13,780
If you go watch the theories behind representation in PT, there's a lot that correlates to Kojima's

2618
02:05:13,780 --> 02:05:19,700
experience there and him trying to leave clues to bypass his NDA without doing it.

2619
02:05:20,260 --> 02:05:24,340
And I mean, it is a little bit conspiracy theorist, you know, talk, but a lot of it

2620
02:05:24,340 --> 02:05:27,940
does make sense, especially with what we know now after the fact.

2621
02:05:27,940 --> 02:05:33,860
And the whole thing with Konami is that he was the only, I think, person on their board

2622
02:05:33,860 --> 02:05:39,540
that wasn't like one of the like original or in the family or something about it.

2623
02:05:39,540 --> 02:05:43,860
So he was always seen as an outsider amongst the powers that be at Konami.

2624
02:05:43,860 --> 02:05:52,100
So definitely, if I can find that thing, the little video that I found before, I will try

2625
02:05:52,100 --> 02:05:54,660
to post it up on my Twitter at Dark Sakura.

2626
02:05:54,660 --> 02:05:55,160
Cool.

2627
02:05:55,860 --> 02:05:56,420
All right.

2628
02:05:56,420 --> 02:05:58,820
Well, just a few more stories for you guys before we get to Discord.

2629
02:05:58,820 --> 02:05:59,320
Loki.

2630
02:06:00,100 --> 02:06:00,600
All right.

2631
02:06:01,480 --> 02:06:07,160
So we were talking about Stadia a little bit ago and how there's not really a whole ton

2632
02:06:07,160 --> 02:06:08,760
of things coming out on Stadia.

2633
02:06:09,320 --> 02:06:11,800
Well, they're hoping to change that.

2634
02:06:11,800 --> 02:06:19,000
So now Google is actually planning on beefing up their library by purchasing some studios.

2635
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:24,760
So they've done this with Typhoon Studios and Typhoon Studios, of course, is an indie

2636
02:06:24,760 --> 02:06:30,760
studio that's created by some veterans from other games that you might know, including

2637
02:06:30,760 --> 02:06:34,120
Batman Arkham City, Far Cry 4 and the such.

2638
02:06:34,760 --> 02:06:40,920
They're planning on releasing their first game, Journey to the Savage Planet, and they're

2639
02:06:40,920 --> 02:06:47,240
going to be joining existing Stadia games and entertainment studio in Montreal.

2640
02:06:47,800 --> 02:06:53,400
So no word on what exactly they're going to be developing, but it is going to be some

2641
02:06:53,400 --> 02:06:54,040
new games.

2642
02:06:55,560 --> 02:06:58,840
Which is good because right now we only know one kind of exclusive game and don't really

2643
02:06:58,840 --> 02:07:01,560
know much about it and don't know when the hell it's coming up.

2644
02:07:02,280 --> 02:07:06,520
VG Realness in our chat saying my question to Google and Stadia, why did they not have

2645
02:07:06,520 --> 02:07:07,880
these studios planned out already?

2646
02:07:07,880 --> 02:07:09,080
Seems like an afterthought.

2647
02:07:10,520 --> 02:07:15,640
Yeah, unless Google is committing to the long game here with this, which we still don't

2648
02:07:15,640 --> 02:07:16,760
know if we can trust them to do that.

2649
02:07:16,760 --> 02:07:20,280
They were hoping for more third party support and just didn't get it.

2650
02:07:20,280 --> 02:07:21,560
So now they got to go buy their own?

2651
02:07:22,200 --> 02:07:22,700
Maybe.

2652
02:07:22,700 --> 02:07:23,200
Maybe.

2653
02:07:23,560 --> 02:07:24,440
That could be a part of it.

2654
02:07:25,480 --> 02:07:29,800
And yeah, I mean, you saw Microsoft making these moves a couple of years ago, and now

2655
02:07:29,800 --> 02:07:32,120
we're going to see that payoff next year.

2656
02:07:32,120 --> 02:07:33,400
Hopefully, fingers crossed.

2657
02:07:33,400 --> 02:07:38,040
I mean, I'm expecting big things for Microsoft for E3, so we'll see what happens with that.

2658
02:07:38,040 --> 02:07:41,160
So do you think they might bring Scalebound back?

2659
02:07:42,200 --> 02:07:44,920
That rumor always shows its face in one way or another.

2660
02:07:44,920 --> 02:07:45,420
All right.

2661
02:07:46,600 --> 02:07:47,100
All right.

2662
02:07:47,880 --> 02:07:51,560
One more story for you guys, and it's about yet another TV service.

2663
02:07:51,560 --> 02:07:53,160
Oh, this is one that I don't have.

2664
02:07:53,160 --> 02:07:58,120
We were trying to talk about, because Dark Soccer wanted to borrow my CBS for reasons.

2665
02:07:58,120 --> 02:08:00,360
And she's like, well, do you have Netflix?

2666
02:08:00,360 --> 02:08:01,000
Yep, I have Netflix.

2667
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:01,480
Do you have Hulu?

2668
02:08:01,480 --> 02:08:03,960
Yep, I have Hulu, because Alan gets the Hulu.

2669
02:08:03,960 --> 02:08:08,200
And so I feel like nobody has CBS.

2670
02:08:08,200 --> 02:08:13,480
I have the CBS because I got it for Star Trek and maybe to watch Trashy Big Brother.

2671
02:08:13,480 --> 02:08:17,160
At least, it was really bad this last year.

2672
02:08:17,160 --> 02:08:20,760
I didn't watch it this last year, but it's also how I catch up on Survivor sometimes.

2673
02:08:20,760 --> 02:08:27,160
But anyway, Apple TV, one of the other services out there, I haven't heard a lot about except

2674
02:08:27,160 --> 02:08:30,520
for apparently that newsroom show that they have is apparently really good, a lot of people

2675
02:08:30,520 --> 02:08:31,480
talking about it.

2676
02:08:31,480 --> 02:08:32,680
And they're going to be having another show.

2677
02:08:32,680 --> 02:08:33,640
What's that have to do with video games?

2678
02:08:33,640 --> 02:08:37,160
Because they're going to be having another show coming out on February 7th, and it is

2679
02:08:37,160 --> 02:08:38,440
a video game spoof show.

2680
02:08:38,440 --> 02:08:43,480
It's called Mythic Quest, not Mystic Quest, but Mythic Quest Ravens Banquet.

2681
02:08:44,200 --> 02:08:47,880
And there's going to be nine episodes that will be released on February 7th.

2682
02:08:47,880 --> 02:08:50,760
And what I think is kind of interesting about it, you know, you might be kind of rolling

2683
02:08:50,760 --> 02:08:52,760
your eyes like, oh, God, video game parody.

2684
02:08:52,760 --> 02:08:59,480
But the creators of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Rob McElhenny and Charlie Day.

2685
02:08:59,480 --> 02:09:00,520
We've heard about this already.

2686
02:09:00,520 --> 02:09:01,160
I think so.

2687
02:09:01,160 --> 02:09:03,400
But now we're getting something that is coming out February 7th.

2688
02:09:03,400 --> 02:09:04,520
We know that it's coming out.

2689
02:09:04,520 --> 02:09:07,880
And I don't think we knew it was Apple TV before.

2690
02:09:07,880 --> 02:09:08,200
Maybe we did.

2691
02:09:08,200 --> 02:09:08,680
Yes, we did.

2692
02:09:08,680 --> 02:09:09,400
Did we?

2693
02:09:09,400 --> 02:09:14,760
OK, well, so there's that because It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia is one of those shows

2694
02:09:14,760 --> 02:09:19,480
that's kind of like I'm laughing so hard at this, even though it's like kind of terrible,

2695
02:09:19,480 --> 02:09:21,720
but like in a really funny way.

2696
02:09:21,720 --> 02:09:26,520
So I know I hope it's like I hope I hope it's funny like that, but we'll see.

2697
02:09:27,480 --> 02:09:31,080
Also, some of the people that are in this, this is what's also kind of weird about this.

2698
02:09:31,080 --> 02:09:33,560
Some of the people that are involved with it, I want to say, yeah.

2699
02:09:35,480 --> 02:09:39,960
David Hornsby is in this from from Philadelphia, the movie.

2700
02:09:40,840 --> 02:09:44,520
I don't remember what part that was, but also in the show, F.

2701
02:09:44,520 --> 02:09:50,120
Murray Abraham is in this show like every Abraham's got to be in his 70s.

2702
02:09:50,120 --> 02:09:52,120
He was in like Amadeus, right?

2703
02:09:53,800 --> 02:09:55,160
So I don't it's it's anyway.

2704
02:09:55,160 --> 02:09:59,080
Yeah, because this was something that was part of that Ubisoft motion pictures company thing.

2705
02:09:59,080 --> 02:09:59,400
Yeah.

2706
02:09:59,400 --> 02:10:04,520
So they talked about it during their their E3 press conference and video game actress

2707
02:10:04,520 --> 02:10:09,480
Ashley Birch from Horizon Zero Dawn and Life is Strange is also going to be involved with this.

2708
02:10:09,480 --> 02:10:11,240
So that'll be interesting.

2709
02:10:12,120 --> 02:10:14,120
Oh, it was an E3 announcement.

2710
02:10:14,120 --> 02:10:17,240
Azette is asking, is this a The Guild rip off?

2711
02:10:18,280 --> 02:10:18,920
I don't know.

2712
02:10:18,920 --> 02:10:20,520
I don't think so.

2713
02:10:20,520 --> 02:10:22,360
I've never watched The Guild, so I don't know.

2714
02:10:22,360 --> 02:10:24,200
I've seen some of The Guild. It was cute.

2715
02:10:24,200 --> 02:10:27,240
I saw the earlier episodes kind of like before it was everywhere.

2716
02:10:27,240 --> 02:10:29,720
I mean, not to sound hipster about it, but that's the reality.

2717
02:10:29,720 --> 02:10:32,360
I saw it when you could download the episodes on Xbox 360.

2718
02:10:32,360 --> 02:10:34,840
That's when I saw I was watching it on YouTube.

2719
02:10:35,800 --> 02:10:36,920
So back in the day.

2720
02:10:37,800 --> 02:10:38,600
All right.

2721
02:10:38,600 --> 02:10:41,240
So there it is, the news for tonight.

2722
02:10:41,240 --> 02:10:45,400
So if you want to give us a call, you can join our discord over at

2723
02:10:45,400 --> 02:10:49,880
vognetwork.com slash discord in the green room.

2724
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:52,440
Or you can just ask a question.

2725
02:10:52,440 --> 02:10:55,880
If you have a general question you'd like to put out in chat, you can do that.

2726
02:10:56,840 --> 02:10:59,320
Otherwise, we'll talk amongst ourselves for a little bit.

2727
02:10:59,320 --> 02:11:02,600
I'm going to ask if there's any last minute stories, although I know we're looking,

2728
02:11:02,600 --> 02:11:05,000
but we're scraping the barrel as it is this week.

2729
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:06,680
So there is that.

2730
02:11:06,680 --> 02:11:08,760
Oh, here's a clickbait rumor.

2731
02:11:08,760 --> 02:11:09,400
Oh no.

2732
02:11:09,400 --> 02:11:10,120
All right.

2733
02:11:10,120 --> 02:11:10,760
Fine.

2734
02:11:10,760 --> 02:11:11,320
Fine.

2735
02:11:11,320 --> 02:11:13,320
No calls in queue means rumors.

2736
02:11:13,320 --> 02:11:14,280
Let's do them.

2737
02:11:14,280 --> 02:11:17,560
There's a rumor that Sumo digital's working on crackdown four.

2738
02:11:18,920 --> 02:11:19,800
Interesting.

2739
02:11:19,800 --> 02:11:24,360
When crackdown three seems like it wasn't well received at the end of the day.

2740
02:11:24,360 --> 02:11:29,080
So you know, what's funny speaking of games that weren't well received.

2741
02:11:29,080 --> 02:11:33,880
I thought of you Loki today because I saw I was going through the PlayStation store

2742
02:11:33,880 --> 02:11:36,680
and I saw agents of mayhem for sale for $4.

2743
02:11:37,800 --> 02:11:39,080
And I was not even worth it for that.

2744
02:11:40,600 --> 02:11:42,200
I will not play that game.

2745
02:11:42,200 --> 02:11:43,320
It looks so terrible.

2746
02:11:44,920 --> 02:11:47,720
As that wants to know who's watched the Witcher on Netflix.

2747
02:11:47,720 --> 02:11:48,680
I not yet.

2748
02:11:48,680 --> 02:11:51,160
I intended to today and didn't get around to it.

2749
02:11:51,160 --> 02:11:54,280
So soon as that you liked it though, right?

2750
02:11:55,400 --> 02:11:58,840
Dark to see us as just the first episode and as that says liked it.

2751
02:11:58,840 --> 02:12:01,640
So apparently the critics hated it though.

2752
02:12:01,640 --> 02:12:02,600
Well, they don't count.

2753
02:12:03,880 --> 02:12:07,160
Well, the one review I was reading where they gave it an F was like,

2754
02:12:07,160 --> 02:12:09,240
we didn't even bother to watch every episode.

2755
02:12:09,240 --> 02:12:12,920
And I was kind of like, isn't that kind of fucking idiot shitty?

2756
02:12:12,920 --> 02:12:15,240
Like, isn't that like what you're supposed to not do?

2757
02:12:15,240 --> 02:12:17,080
At least they said so in the article.

2758
02:12:17,080 --> 02:12:19,000
So you can see that means their opinion doesn't count.

2759
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:19,500
Yeah.

2760
02:12:20,120 --> 02:12:24,360
So, um, but then a lot of the same stuff's happening with Star Wars, right?

2761
02:12:24,360 --> 02:12:28,040
Like a lot of critics don't like it, but they feel like audiences are really divided.

2762
02:12:28,040 --> 02:12:30,920
Like I've heard people that are like, I love it.

2763
02:12:30,920 --> 02:12:33,720
I've heard a few that are like, I don't love it.

2764
02:12:34,120 --> 02:12:37,000
Um, I don't, you know what, I'm not even going to,

2765
02:12:37,800 --> 02:12:42,840
I'll say it next week when I don't have to be as like crazy about spoilers.

2766
02:12:42,840 --> 02:12:45,320
I haven't seen it, but just kind of like something I've heard about it.

2767
02:12:45,320 --> 02:12:47,720
And I don't want to, I don't want to even remotely go into spoilers,

2768
02:12:47,720 --> 02:12:52,920
but maybe in a week after all the hardcore fans have seen it, I'll do very light spoilers.

2769
02:12:52,920 --> 02:12:57,560
So, but I won't do that tonight because I know people are hypersensitive about spoilers and

2770
02:12:57,560 --> 02:12:59,720
some people might be waiting until Christmas.

2771
02:12:59,720 --> 02:13:05,080
So, well, I can see that we have one of our favorite spoilers waiting in the green room

2772
02:13:05,080 --> 02:13:05,560
right now.

2773
02:13:05,560 --> 02:13:08,760
So let's see if we can get them on the show right now.

2774
02:13:08,760 --> 02:13:09,320
Hi there.

2775
02:13:09,320 --> 02:13:10,360
You're on orange launch radio.

2776
02:13:10,360 --> 02:13:10,760
Who's this?

2777
02:13:11,720 --> 02:13:15,640
Hi, it's Jim Sally trying to figure out how to shut off his other thing that's talking.

2778
02:13:17,960 --> 02:13:18,840
Hey, Jim Sally.

2779
02:13:18,840 --> 02:13:19,640
It's good to hear from you.

2780
02:13:19,640 --> 02:13:22,200
It's a holiday miracle to have you here on the show.

2781
02:13:22,200 --> 02:13:23,880
Oh, isn't it, man?

2782
02:13:23,880 --> 02:13:25,080
Sunday nights are tough.

2783
02:13:25,240 --> 02:13:26,600
How would you sometimes, brother?

2784
02:13:27,160 --> 02:13:28,120
They're tough for you.

2785
02:13:29,960 --> 02:13:34,920
I get my fucking Sunday nights when I get my shit together, you know, family gets together.

2786
02:13:34,920 --> 02:13:37,880
We eat big meals and we fucking pass out on the couch, man.

2787
02:13:37,880 --> 02:13:41,640
I do pass out listening to you guys sometimes snuggling away.

2788
02:13:44,760 --> 02:13:46,280
How are you going to spend your holiday week?

2789
02:13:46,280 --> 02:13:48,280
Is there lots of snuggling planned for your holiday week?

2790
02:13:48,840 --> 02:13:50,760
There's lots of snuggling planned for the holiday week.

2791
02:13:50,760 --> 02:13:51,720
The kids are in the house.

2792
02:13:52,040 --> 02:13:58,760
Unfortunately, we had, my little girl had a, long story short, she got a therapy cat

2793
02:13:58,760 --> 02:14:01,160
to help her with some emotional issues.

2794
02:14:01,160 --> 02:14:07,880
And the poor thing passed away with some kidney failure at like seven weeks, seven weeks old.

2795
02:14:07,880 --> 02:14:11,160
Well, we only had him for seven weeks and the poor cat passed away.

2796
02:14:11,160 --> 02:14:12,280
It's so sad.

2797
02:14:12,280 --> 02:14:13,400
But we live in a small town.

2798
02:14:13,400 --> 02:14:16,760
So we just went on Facebook and it was like, boom, a week later, new cat, bam.

2799
02:14:16,760 --> 02:14:17,640
You know what I mean?

2800
02:14:17,640 --> 02:14:20,840
You do make a little ofrenda for the old cat, you know?

2801
02:14:21,640 --> 02:14:23,320
I gave her some, I got it.

2802
02:14:23,320 --> 02:14:24,360
Listen, don't tell her.

2803
02:14:25,080 --> 02:14:27,720
I told her I got her cremated, but I just took it.

2804
02:14:29,560 --> 02:14:30,360
Oh, okay.

2805
02:14:31,480 --> 02:14:34,120
Wait, but is there, I thought you were whispering because maybe

2806
02:14:34,120 --> 02:14:36,600
there might be a holiday miracle with a new cat?

2807
02:14:37,800 --> 02:14:39,160
No, she already got the new cat.

2808
02:14:39,160 --> 02:14:39,960
I just picked it up.

2809
02:14:40,760 --> 02:14:42,120
Like, so that's what we're doing this week.

2810
02:14:42,120 --> 02:14:44,760
We're snuggling a new little black, new little black kitten.

2811
02:14:45,560 --> 02:14:45,960
Got it.

2812
02:14:45,960 --> 02:14:46,600
Man, it's weird.

2813
02:14:46,600 --> 02:14:48,280
It's weird the things you do for little kids, man.

2814
02:14:48,360 --> 02:14:51,240
I'm telling you right now, there's no fucking way farm boy Jim Sally was

2815
02:14:51,240 --> 02:14:54,600
going to let a goddamn cat shit in a box inside my house.

2816
02:14:55,960 --> 02:15:02,680
This fucking thing shits in a box inside my house and then looks to me like I owe it a treat.

2817
02:15:02,680 --> 02:15:03,560
Fuck you.

2818
02:15:03,560 --> 02:15:05,320
The things you do for little kids.

2819
02:15:05,320 --> 02:15:07,640
How about the things you do for 40 year old men?

2820
02:15:07,640 --> 02:15:12,520
Like Alan and I have a cat and it's just off camera where his potty is.

2821
02:15:12,520 --> 02:15:14,600
Like it's right on the other side of the wall.

2822
02:15:16,280 --> 02:15:17,880
Dude, I'm telling you 40, man.

2823
02:15:18,440 --> 02:15:19,640
You want to hear something crazy?

2824
02:15:21,240 --> 02:15:23,560
Jim Sally's hitting that 40 bell next month, man.

2825
02:15:24,200 --> 02:15:27,960
Well, happy early birthday to you.

2826
02:15:27,960 --> 02:15:29,000
Hey, you know what?

2827
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:32,040
Like 40 is kind of like, it's a whatever.

2828
02:15:32,040 --> 02:15:36,440
Like honestly, turning 40 was a big whatever for me because like for all the hype and all

2829
02:15:36,440 --> 02:15:41,720
the talk about like, oh my God, when you tune 30, like if you don't have XYZ accomplished

2830
02:15:41,720 --> 02:15:45,720
and like all these things that, you know, like our parents put that type of pressure on us,

2831
02:15:45,720 --> 02:15:47,560
then like you're a horrible failure.

2832
02:15:47,560 --> 02:15:51,880
And as it turns out, like my 30s, I didn't really have any of those things you were supposed

2833
02:15:51,880 --> 02:15:52,520
to have.

2834
02:15:52,520 --> 02:15:56,200
And like my 30s overall were actually a lot better than my 20s.

2835
02:15:56,200 --> 02:16:00,280
Like in my 20s, I was still like, I was like weird.

2836
02:16:00,280 --> 02:16:00,840
You know what?

2837
02:16:00,840 --> 02:16:03,240
And I feel like in my 30s, I finally got my shit together.

2838
02:16:03,240 --> 02:16:07,000
My mom never gave me shit because you know what I would turn around and say, how old

2839
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:07,800
were you when you had me?

2840
02:16:10,280 --> 02:16:12,680
It's so interesting that we come from like two extremes, right?

2841
02:16:12,680 --> 02:16:15,720
Your mom had you at a very young age.

2842
02:16:15,720 --> 02:16:22,920
And my mom, yeah, my mom had me at 38, which in the 70s was a very old age to be having

2843
02:16:22,920 --> 02:16:23,240
children.

2844
02:16:23,240 --> 02:16:26,680
Like I know nowadays what Janet Jackson had to get at 50.

2845
02:16:26,680 --> 02:16:28,840
Uh, what's her name from Flavor Love?

2846
02:16:28,840 --> 02:16:29,640
Let's wait a while.

2847
02:16:31,320 --> 02:16:35,640
She's having a kid at 50 with shit like targeted MRI and fucking prenatal drugs and stuff,

2848
02:16:35,640 --> 02:16:36,120
man.

2849
02:16:36,120 --> 02:16:36,360
True.

2850
02:16:36,360 --> 02:16:38,520
Your mom is doing that shit in the 70s, man.

2851
02:16:38,520 --> 02:16:39,960
No, no, no.

2852
02:16:40,280 --> 02:16:44,200
Here's the crazy thing about that.

2853
02:16:44,200 --> 02:16:50,440
They were told in the, in the 60s, they were told that they couldn't have kids.

2854
02:16:50,440 --> 02:16:53,880
So they adopted and they, they tried and they didn't.

2855
02:16:53,880 --> 02:16:56,520
And so they adopted, they just went to adoption.

2856
02:16:56,520 --> 02:16:58,680
They, they adopted my brother and my sister.

2857
02:16:58,680 --> 02:17:04,360
And then good for them and they weren't even trying years later out of the blue.

2858
02:17:04,360 --> 02:17:09,320
Like just like they did not think we were going to have a kid or try just, it just fucking

2859
02:17:09,320 --> 02:17:10,040
happened.

2860
02:17:10,040 --> 02:17:11,080
Hi, here I am.

2861
02:17:11,080 --> 02:17:13,720
So, um, I was a surprise.

2862
02:17:14,520 --> 02:17:15,240
Surprise.

2863
02:17:15,240 --> 02:17:16,280
I was surprised too.

2864
02:17:17,480 --> 02:17:20,040
So, but we were two very different types of surprises.

2865
02:17:20,040 --> 02:17:21,720
I think there were drugs involved with me.

2866
02:17:21,720 --> 02:17:21,960
Yeah.

2867
02:17:22,680 --> 02:17:26,360
Well, no, I know my daddy was doing some acid.

2868
02:17:26,360 --> 02:17:28,360
Oh, oh.

2869
02:17:28,360 --> 02:17:30,280
And pixel pocket saying, I didn't know that Rob.

2870
02:17:30,280 --> 02:17:31,800
My mom had me at 37.

2871
02:17:31,800 --> 02:17:32,120
Yep.

2872
02:17:32,120 --> 02:17:32,600
In a row.

2873
02:17:33,880 --> 02:17:39,080
So now, now I'm thinking, oh my God, like I'm older than my mom was when she had me

2874
02:17:39,160 --> 02:17:42,280
and I still don't have kids, but I'm like, okay, I'm, I made peace with it.

2875
02:17:42,280 --> 02:17:43,800
Like I kind of don't want them at this point.

2876
02:17:43,800 --> 02:17:45,240
I have kids and guess what?

2877
02:17:45,240 --> 02:17:47,160
Now I can't on purpose.

2878
02:17:47,160 --> 02:17:49,160
Other people's kids are great.

2879
02:17:49,160 --> 02:17:52,360
I can appreciate Loki's children from a distance.

2880
02:17:53,160 --> 02:17:54,360
I hung out with Julian today.

2881
02:17:54,360 --> 02:17:56,040
I can appreciate him from a distance as well.

2882
02:17:56,600 --> 02:17:57,720
I hung out with Julian.

2883
02:17:59,720 --> 02:18:01,880
He's graduated from being Mr.

2884
02:18:01,880 --> 02:18:03,960
Boy to young sir.

2885
02:18:03,960 --> 02:18:06,120
Oh, he's going to be 13 next year.

2886
02:18:06,120 --> 02:18:07,480
Oh, well hell.

2887
02:18:08,440 --> 02:18:09,000
Here you go.

2888
02:18:09,640 --> 02:18:10,600
Sorry, Jim Sally.

2889
02:18:10,600 --> 02:18:13,560
We somehow derailed the Jim Sally train with a tangent train of our own.

2890
02:18:13,560 --> 02:18:14,440
Haha.

2891
02:18:14,440 --> 02:18:14,600
Yeah.

2892
02:18:18,680 --> 02:18:20,360
So technically it's a gaming show.

2893
02:18:20,360 --> 02:18:23,000
I should ask you, are there any games you've been playing lately?

2894
02:18:24,520 --> 02:18:27,080
I finally got to the end of Fallout 4.

2895
02:18:27,080 --> 02:18:31,160
Now I think it's an old game, so I can spoil the ending a little bit at this stage in the

2896
02:18:31,160 --> 02:18:32,920
game, have a little chitchat.

2897
02:18:32,920 --> 02:18:33,720
I don't think it's fine.

2898
02:18:33,720 --> 02:18:36,440
If you haven't beat Fallout 4 yet by now, people fuck off.

2899
02:18:36,520 --> 02:18:37,000
Okay.

2900
02:18:38,280 --> 02:18:38,520
Okay.

2901
02:18:39,480 --> 02:18:43,560
At the end of the, in the middle of the game, you find out that this dude who's an old man

2902
02:18:43,560 --> 02:18:46,120
running the Institute is actually your son from a long time ago.

2903
02:18:46,120 --> 02:18:47,720
And he was kind of fucking me around a little bit.

2904
02:18:47,720 --> 02:18:49,080
And then at the end, he's in a chair.

2905
02:18:49,080 --> 02:18:52,840
And I did the Jim Sally thing that I haven't done for a long time in a Fallout game.

2906
02:18:52,840 --> 02:18:59,080
I stabbed him in the belly as many times as I could before he had a chance to say a word.

2907
02:18:59,080 --> 02:19:00,520
Just to see what would happen.

2908
02:19:00,520 --> 02:19:01,320
And he died.

2909
02:19:01,880 --> 02:19:06,200
And then I beat the game and it was all like, war, shit, war, war.

2910
02:19:06,200 --> 02:19:06,760
Don't have a war.

2911
02:19:06,760 --> 02:19:07,880
You walk with your dog or whatever.

2912
02:19:07,880 --> 02:19:08,920
You're like, fuck that shit.

2913
02:19:08,920 --> 02:19:12,280
And now I finally come back to the Fallout that I love.

2914
02:19:12,280 --> 02:19:18,440
And I just marauder my way from town to town murdering people, murdering them.

2915
02:19:18,440 --> 02:19:19,800
And you know what I found out?

2916
02:19:19,800 --> 02:19:22,040
There's this thing called God Mode.

2917
02:19:22,040 --> 02:19:23,480
They put on some of the characters.

2918
02:19:23,480 --> 02:19:24,280
Did you know about this?

2919
02:19:25,480 --> 02:19:27,160
No, because I barely played any.

2920
02:19:27,160 --> 02:19:28,920
I don't know about this because I have mods.

2921
02:19:29,240 --> 02:19:34,760
Some characters you could stab in the face for days and they just take it and come back

2922
02:19:34,760 --> 02:19:35,560
for more.

2923
02:19:35,560 --> 02:19:38,760
Yeah, I imagine they're characters that are essential to completing the story and stuff.

2924
02:19:38,760 --> 02:19:39,560
Like, they can't die.

2925
02:19:40,280 --> 02:19:41,720
It's very unsatisfied.

2926
02:19:41,720 --> 02:19:42,840
It's very unsatisfied.

2927
02:19:42,840 --> 02:19:47,480
And one night I was wearing my headphones, stabbing an old man in the face repeatedly

2928
02:19:47,480 --> 02:19:49,240
on the ground while he just cried.

2929
02:19:49,240 --> 02:19:50,280
I'm just doing it.

2930
02:19:50,280 --> 02:19:54,200
I was there for like, I want to say, I want to say a good solid 30 seconds of face stabbing.

2931
02:19:54,200 --> 02:19:57,000
A good solid, you fucking make a good shit in.

2932
02:19:57,000 --> 02:19:57,560
You know what I mean?

2933
02:19:57,640 --> 02:19:58,760
Take a shit.

2934
02:19:58,760 --> 02:20:00,680
Oh, good shivin', right?

2935
02:20:00,680 --> 02:20:01,960
So I'm shivin' this guy.

2936
02:20:01,960 --> 02:20:03,560
I'm fucking shivin' him.

2937
02:20:03,560 --> 02:20:09,400
And then I realized, I realized mid-shiv that my four-year-old Daniel is right behind me

2938
02:20:10,040 --> 02:20:12,520
watching me shiv this fucker in the face.

2939
02:20:13,720 --> 02:20:16,760
And he doesn't really know what's going on because I'm wearing headphones, right?

2940
02:20:16,760 --> 02:20:18,760
Because I don't want to wake them up with the shivadins.

2941
02:20:18,760 --> 02:20:20,120
With the shivadins late at night.

2942
02:20:20,680 --> 02:20:22,360
So he asked, what are you doing, daddy?

2943
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:25,960
The only thing I could think of was to say, I'm trying to brush his teeth.

2944
02:20:28,120 --> 02:20:31,160
He says, he says, what?

2945
02:20:31,160 --> 02:20:32,040
Why?

2946
02:20:32,040 --> 02:20:32,360
Why?

2947
02:20:32,360 --> 02:20:35,080
I said, because he didn't brush his teeth when he was a little boy, Daniel.

2948
02:20:35,080 --> 02:20:36,280
Now look at his mouth.

2949
02:20:36,280 --> 02:20:37,240
It's all gross.

2950
02:20:37,240 --> 02:20:40,200
I gotta fix, I gotta fix his teeth.

2951
02:20:40,200 --> 02:20:44,600
And I'm telling you, he fucking, that kid brushes those teeth to a mirror shine.

2952
02:20:44,600 --> 02:20:49,640
Now when he gets up in the morning, when he gets up in the morning, I thought, I thought

2953
02:20:49,640 --> 02:20:50,920
he bought an electric toothbrush.

2954
02:20:50,920 --> 02:20:51,560
I went upstairs.

2955
02:20:51,560 --> 02:20:53,320
Motherfucker had my dremel out.

2956
02:20:53,320 --> 02:20:54,760
Motherfucker had my dremel out.

2957
02:20:54,760 --> 02:20:55,800
Mirror shine.

2958
02:20:55,800 --> 02:20:56,840
I said, shit.

2959
02:20:56,840 --> 02:21:00,680
And that's why people, it's important to, you know, play video games with your kids

2960
02:21:00,680 --> 02:21:03,960
responsibly and wear headphones and wear headphones.

2961
02:21:05,080 --> 02:21:09,560
Uh, that was possibly the best holiday lesson we'll ever learn here on Orange Launch Radio.

2962
02:21:09,560 --> 02:21:11,080
Thank you so much for that.

2963
02:21:11,080 --> 02:21:15,880
I, I was, I was going to say like, who, who hasn't done like fucked up things in video

2964
02:21:15,880 --> 02:21:16,200
games?

2965
02:21:16,200 --> 02:21:18,040
Like that's what Loki lives for.

2966
02:21:18,040 --> 02:21:20,440
Loki lives for those games that you can do fucked up things.

2967
02:21:20,440 --> 02:21:21,080
Right.

2968
02:21:21,080 --> 02:21:25,480
And like, yeah, usually even, even I admit, like when I first played the elder scrolls

2969
02:21:25,480 --> 02:21:28,840
Oblivion, I'm going back to the one that was launched.

2970
02:21:28,840 --> 02:21:29,400
Oh yeah.

2971
02:21:29,400 --> 02:21:33,000
Like the minute you could stab the king, I tried it.

2972
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:36,680
Like, you know, I got killed by those guards real fast, but yeah.

2973
02:21:37,560 --> 02:21:38,760
Fuck you, Patrick Stewart.

2974
02:21:40,440 --> 02:21:43,160
I just wanted to see if I could do it.

2975
02:21:43,160 --> 02:21:45,000
Have you ever done it as an accident?

2976
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,160
Like you meant to hit the button to talk to them.

2977
02:21:47,160 --> 02:21:52,840
And instead you hit the button for Fus Ro Dah and it's, and I'm like, oops, sorry.

2978
02:21:52,840 --> 02:21:53,560
Didn't mean to do that.

2979
02:21:53,560 --> 02:21:54,600
I don't know my own strength.

2980
02:21:55,480 --> 02:22:01,800
No, I usually play the game with all sorts of exploits in place.

2981
02:22:02,440 --> 02:22:07,160
I did play with mods on as well before, but like I've played a vanilla, but just exploiting

2982
02:22:07,160 --> 02:22:11,320
the game through the vanilla means like, you know, finding the merchant chest hidden.

2983
02:22:11,320 --> 02:22:17,400
Cause there's like, you can go to, you know, in Skyrim, you can go to, I can't remember

2984
02:22:17,400 --> 02:22:18,120
what it's called now.

2985
02:22:18,920 --> 02:22:23,080
One of the towns though, and you can easily access the merchant chest and just steal all

2986
02:22:23,080 --> 02:22:25,240
their stuff out of there and then sell it back to them.

2987
02:22:26,360 --> 02:22:30,360
And then you, you kill them and then you reload and then you can do it again and again and

2988
02:22:30,360 --> 02:22:32,600
again and you get infinite money at their body.

2989
02:22:32,600 --> 02:22:33,560
Yeah, exactly.

2990
02:22:33,560 --> 02:22:39,960
And then you just let you, you know, do the enchantment potions and spells and you get

2991
02:22:39,960 --> 02:22:45,720
to the point where your armor, you can have like a carry weight of, you know, infinite

2992
02:22:45,720 --> 02:22:48,440
amount of items and just crashes the game.

2993
02:22:48,440 --> 02:22:49,240
Cause you can't sort them.

2994
02:22:49,240 --> 02:22:49,800
You can't do it.

2995
02:22:50,520 --> 02:22:51,320
Jim Sally.

2996
02:22:51,320 --> 02:22:53,640
Hey, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show.

2997
02:22:53,640 --> 02:22:57,800
But before we do, I have to ask you, do you have any new year's resolutions?

2998
02:22:59,080 --> 02:22:59,640
Yeah, man.

2999
02:22:59,640 --> 02:23:07,400
My new year resolution this year is to really try to set some time aside to, you know, start

3000
02:23:07,400 --> 02:23:10,040
a little archive or something.

3001
02:23:10,040 --> 02:23:11,320
I got to get my shit together.

3002
02:23:11,320 --> 02:23:14,920
I just got to find a better Sunday night at fucking midnight to get it going.

3003
02:23:17,080 --> 02:23:19,640
So I've always started looking for help.

3004
02:23:19,640 --> 02:23:20,280
Good point.

3005
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:21,400
All right.

3006
02:23:21,400 --> 02:23:25,480
Well, I bet you have a chat room full of people here who love your phone calls.

3007
02:23:25,480 --> 02:23:26,760
That would be happy to help.

3008
02:23:26,760 --> 02:23:29,000
However, we can't end it for what it's worth.

3009
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:31,640
All of these episodes of the show are archived.

3010
02:23:31,640 --> 02:23:36,760
So someday when your kid is 18, you can play him the clip of daddy teaching him to brush

3011
02:23:36,760 --> 02:23:37,260
his teeth.

3012
02:23:37,880 --> 02:23:38,680
Can you imagine?

3013
02:23:39,320 --> 02:23:40,680
The psychiatric goes alone.

3014
02:23:42,680 --> 02:23:46,200
I can't wait for Loki's kids to be old enough to understand this show.

3015
02:23:46,280 --> 02:23:51,240
I'm this old and don't understand the show.

3016
02:23:52,760 --> 02:23:53,640
Fair enough.

3017
02:23:53,640 --> 02:23:54,140
All right.

3018
02:23:55,080 --> 02:23:56,840
Happy holidays, bitches.

3019
02:23:56,840 --> 02:23:57,160
All right.

3020
02:23:57,160 --> 02:23:58,120
Happy holidays, Jim.

3021
02:23:58,120 --> 02:23:59,160
Sally, thanks for the call.

3022
02:23:59,160 --> 02:23:59,960
Take care.

3023
02:23:59,960 --> 02:24:00,680
Take care of my friend.

3024
02:24:01,320 --> 02:24:02,200
Later, brother.

3025
02:24:02,200 --> 02:24:03,480
Always, always great to hear from you.

3026
02:24:03,480 --> 02:24:03,980
Bye bye.

3027
02:24:05,640 --> 02:24:06,440
That was a treat.

3028
02:24:06,440 --> 02:24:09,080
That was a holiday miracle right there.

3029
02:24:09,080 --> 02:24:09,480
All right.

3030
02:24:09,480 --> 02:24:13,160
I think on that note, we will start to wrap things up here unless Loki found any other

3031
02:24:13,160 --> 02:24:15,240
last minute stories worth mentioning.

3032
02:24:15,240 --> 02:24:19,880
It wasn't really worth mentioning, but just as people figured out that Sasha Gray is also

3033
02:24:19,880 --> 02:24:23,480
now a YouTube gaming streamer and still like that in Twitch as well.

3034
02:24:23,480 --> 02:24:23,960
Who?

3035
02:24:23,960 --> 02:24:25,240
Sasha Gray, the porn star.

3036
02:24:26,200 --> 02:24:26,920
Who?

3037
02:24:26,920 --> 02:24:28,760
Yeah, she's done things.

3038
02:24:28,760 --> 02:24:31,480
I mean, she's done like non-porn things.

3039
02:24:31,480 --> 02:24:32,200
Would I know them?

3040
02:24:33,560 --> 02:24:34,440
I don't know.

3041
02:24:34,440 --> 02:24:36,120
She's she's pretty mainstream.

3042
02:24:36,120 --> 02:24:36,760
Okay.

3043
02:24:36,760 --> 02:24:39,400
But like everyone's like, Oh my God, what?

3044
02:24:39,400 --> 02:24:44,200
It's it's a girl that's naked sometimes that likes games like me, like a human being.

3045
02:24:44,200 --> 02:24:44,920
Oh my God.

3046
02:24:44,920 --> 02:24:46,360
People like human things.

3047
02:24:46,920 --> 02:24:47,720
Imagine that.

3048
02:24:47,720 --> 02:24:48,200
Fancy that.

3049
02:24:48,200 --> 02:24:48,600
I know.

3050
02:24:48,600 --> 02:24:49,880
It's just so ridiculous.

3051
02:24:49,880 --> 02:24:52,280
The celebrities, they're real people too.

3052
02:24:52,280 --> 02:24:52,840
Who knew?

3053
02:24:52,840 --> 02:24:53,880
It's like, who cares?

3054
02:24:54,840 --> 02:24:55,640
All right.

3055
02:24:55,640 --> 02:24:59,880
Anyhow, on that note, just see, we had Jim Sally call a pornography.

3056
02:24:59,880 --> 02:25:00,520
I think we're good.

3057
02:25:01,240 --> 02:25:06,680
So we're going to wrap up and I hope everybody has a great holiday week no matter what it

3058
02:25:06,680 --> 02:25:07,400
is you celebrate.

3059
02:25:07,400 --> 02:25:10,520
I'm sure most of you are in the Christmas camp or the Hanukkah camp just because I haven't

3060
02:25:10,520 --> 02:25:14,120
heard the other ones really coming up in chat, but whatever it is that you're celebrating.

3061
02:25:14,200 --> 02:25:18,200
I hope you have a wonderful week and, uh, you know, I hope, uh, if you're doing family

3062
02:25:18,200 --> 02:25:19,800
stuff, I hope family stuff is great.

3063
02:25:19,800 --> 02:25:23,080
If you don't have a lot of family stuff going on, I hope friends stuff is great.

3064
02:25:23,080 --> 02:25:25,800
Um, if you don't have a lot of either of those things going on, just cause your friends are

3065
02:25:25,800 --> 02:25:28,920
out of town or what have you, and you're just, you're sitting around playing video games.

3066
02:25:28,920 --> 02:25:32,920
I hope that is great too, because this is a great time of year to catch up on that stuff.

3067
02:25:32,920 --> 02:25:37,240
And if you're working through the holiday, you know, I hope you make some fucking money.

3068
02:25:37,240 --> 02:25:38,760
I hope you make a lot of fucking money.

3069
02:25:39,320 --> 02:25:40,440
So that's my goal.

3070
02:25:40,440 --> 02:25:41,240
Yeah, there you go.

3071
02:25:41,240 --> 02:25:43,640
So I hope, uh, I hope you don't have any friends at all.

3072
02:25:44,280 --> 02:25:47,080
Um, where are your friends here at fog network?

3073
02:25:47,080 --> 02:25:48,760
Unless you're a Nazi then I'll just punch you.

3074
02:25:48,760 --> 02:25:49,320
All right.

3075
02:25:49,320 --> 02:25:51,000
Anyhow, uh, we're going to wrap up.

3076
02:25:51,000 --> 02:25:53,080
Thank you guys so much for listening to orange on radio.

3077
02:25:53,080 --> 02:25:54,360
We will be back next week.

3078
02:25:54,360 --> 02:25:57,880
I'm anticipating it's going to be a very light news week, but we will talk about some topics

3079
02:25:57,880 --> 02:26:02,440
such as looking back on not only this year in gaming, but looking back on the decade in gaming.

3080
02:26:02,440 --> 02:26:06,040
I'm sure a lot of your favorite gaming podcasts are gonna be doing something very similar,

3081
02:26:06,040 --> 02:26:09,240
but, uh, we'll do it our way here at orange on radio next week.

3082
02:26:09,240 --> 02:26:11,560
And if there are any new stories that break, we'll talk about that.

3083
02:26:11,560 --> 02:26:14,920
We'll get this brain age thing figured out and talk about that next week.

3084
02:26:14,920 --> 02:26:17,400
Uh, and, uh, yeah, so we'll be back in seven days.

3085
02:26:17,400 --> 02:26:20,360
If you enjoyed what you heard here at orange on radio, please tell a friend or two about

3086
02:26:20,360 --> 02:26:22,760
the show because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

3087
02:26:22,760 --> 02:26:26,520
But if the voices aren't here to put out on air, what else can we do?

3088
02:26:26,520 --> 02:26:27,080
We don't have them.

3089
02:26:27,080 --> 02:26:29,960
So, um, we really appreciate you guys, uh, to help us spread the word.

3090
02:26:29,960 --> 02:26:32,280
I do have a thing actually, and I almost forgot.

3091
02:26:32,280 --> 02:26:35,560
I would like for our listeners to send me recipes.

3092
02:26:35,560 --> 02:26:36,440
Hey, wait a minute.

3093
02:26:36,440 --> 02:26:38,840
What happened to the last time you asked him to send you stuff?

3094
02:26:39,240 --> 02:26:40,360
No one fucking did.

3095
02:26:40,360 --> 02:26:40,600
Yeah.

3096
02:26:40,600 --> 02:26:42,360
I thought I saw some tweets come through.

3097
02:26:42,360 --> 02:26:42,680
No.

3098
02:26:42,680 --> 02:26:43,720
The educational stuff.

3099
02:26:43,720 --> 02:26:44,520
That's different.

3100
02:26:44,520 --> 02:26:46,920
I'm going to do a book, an OLR cookbook.

3101
02:26:46,920 --> 02:26:47,400
Okay.

3102
02:26:47,400 --> 02:26:52,280
With listeners, favorite recipes with whatever gets made off of it,

3103
02:26:52,280 --> 02:26:53,640
going to directly benefit the show.

3104
02:26:54,280 --> 02:26:56,440
As that says, Ooh, baby, what kind of recipes?

3105
02:26:56,440 --> 02:26:57,880
How about the recipe to your nuts?

3106
02:26:57,880 --> 02:27:02,280
And if you've got pictures of them, good high resolution pictures of your nuts,

3107
02:27:02,280 --> 02:27:04,760
of your nuts, go ahead and send them in.

3108
02:27:04,760 --> 02:27:12,120
You can either DM me on, um, on, uh, the, the Twitters, um, or the Instagrams.

3109
02:27:12,760 --> 02:27:17,160
I'm at dark soccer, both places, or you can, I guess, send it to our mailbox.

3110
02:27:17,160 --> 02:27:20,600
And to be clear, because I do not want to be banned on Twitch or violate their

3111
02:27:20,600 --> 02:27:21,240
terms of service.

3112
02:27:21,240 --> 02:27:27,160
We are talking about pecans, walnuts, amens, those type of nuts.

3113
02:27:27,160 --> 02:27:31,560
High resolution pictures of those nuts sent to her GMs.

3114
02:27:31,560 --> 02:27:34,040
Recipes are what I want.

3115
02:27:34,040 --> 02:27:34,600
Yes.

3116
02:27:34,600 --> 02:27:38,200
And I want to thank Brad and Marissa for already sharing some recipes with me.

3117
02:27:38,200 --> 02:27:38,760
Yay.

3118
02:27:38,760 --> 02:27:44,440
Um, I would just like specifics, have, have it detailed and send me pictures

3119
02:27:44,440 --> 02:27:47,960
because then, and express permission to publish these.

3120
02:27:48,680 --> 02:27:53,000
And that way when the book comes out, I'll make it available for everyone.

3121
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:55,800
Anyone who wants to buy a copy of it, just know that the money is going to go

3122
02:27:55,800 --> 02:27:57,320
back into the OLR budget.

3123
02:27:57,320 --> 02:27:58,040
Fun.

3124
02:27:58,040 --> 02:28:00,440
Or bog budget or whatever budget.

3125
02:28:00,440 --> 02:28:00,600
Yeah.

3126
02:28:00,600 --> 02:28:04,360
Well, maybe we'd be better to just donate it straight to charity.

3127
02:28:04,360 --> 02:28:08,200
Just because when it comes to the business things, you know, we'll talk about

3128
02:28:08,200 --> 02:28:09,080
it off here.

3129
02:28:09,080 --> 02:28:09,400
All right.

3130
02:28:10,120 --> 02:28:13,000
So, um, charity is a good thing though, right?

3131
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:19,400
We'll donate it to, uh, to the, um, uh, uh, coding for kids stuff.

3132
02:28:20,040 --> 02:28:20,680
That'd be fun.

3133
02:28:20,680 --> 02:28:21,000
Yeah.

3134
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:22,600
Or, um, extra life.

3135
02:28:22,600 --> 02:28:23,560
Who would that be going to?

3136
02:28:23,560 --> 02:28:24,360
Yeah.

3137
02:28:24,360 --> 02:28:24,760
All right.

3138
02:28:24,760 --> 02:28:26,440
Anyway, um, let's see.

3139
02:28:26,440 --> 02:28:27,640
So what was I going to say?

3140
02:28:27,640 --> 02:28:27,960
Final.

3141
02:28:27,960 --> 02:28:28,360
Oh yeah.

3142
02:28:28,920 --> 02:28:31,000
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts and really wrap it up here

3143
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:31,400
tonight.

3144
02:28:31,400 --> 02:28:33,080
So, um, Loki, we'll start with you.

3145
02:28:33,080 --> 02:28:34,120
What's your final thought here?

3146
02:28:34,120 --> 02:28:38,840
I hate Christmas and buying things, mainly the spending of the money and the

3147
02:28:38,840 --> 02:28:39,480
buying things.

3148
02:28:39,480 --> 02:28:41,320
Not necessarily the Christmas part.

3149
02:28:41,320 --> 02:28:44,120
It's just, it's expensive.

3150
02:28:44,120 --> 02:28:46,280
Well, someone's going to get visited by three ghosts tonight.

3151
02:28:47,640 --> 02:28:48,760
I hope they bring money.

3152
02:28:50,440 --> 02:28:53,720
No, he won't be because he's not like a wealthy miser.

3153
02:28:55,240 --> 02:28:56,600
He's not playing his employees.

3154
02:28:58,600 --> 02:28:59,320
All right.

3155
02:28:59,320 --> 02:29:00,040
Uh, let's see.

3156
02:29:00,040 --> 02:29:03,960
My final thought, uh, my final thought is, um, I hope everybody

3157
02:29:03,960 --> 02:29:06,920
has a great holiday and I look forward to seeing cats.

3158
02:29:06,920 --> 02:29:09,080
I'm, I'm at the patched version of cat cats.

3159
02:29:09,080 --> 02:29:12,440
1.1 cats, cats that are patched.

3160
02:29:14,520 --> 02:29:17,720
I used to actually sing the Gumby cat song to, to share me.

3161
02:29:17,720 --> 02:29:21,160
Oh, but instead of Jenny, any dots, she was sure me where me pants.

3162
02:29:22,520 --> 02:29:26,440
Um, so my final thought, thank God for fleece leggings.

3163
02:29:27,720 --> 02:29:32,680
I'm cold all the fucking time and fleece leggings make me not so cold.

3164
02:29:33,320 --> 02:29:33,720
Love it.

3165
02:29:34,280 --> 02:29:34,760
All right.

3166
02:29:34,760 --> 02:29:35,800
That's going to do it.

3167
02:29:35,800 --> 02:29:36,840
Have a great one, everybody.

3168
02:29:36,840 --> 02:29:42,440
