out and it's an episode 3 hoodie yeah and I'm never getting rid of it even though it's

01:25.540 --> 01:31.140
like five sizes too big for me now because number one it's warm and number two I bought

01:31.140 --> 01:35.140
it at the fucking Skywalker Ranch well and being bigger is not always necessarily like

01:35.140 --> 01:39.460

02:53.080 --> 02:57.920
were talking about I felt I fell down earlier yeah she's sick you injured yourself it's just

02:57.920 --> 03:02.720
a minor injury oh it's only a flesh wound it pretty much yeah it's only a flesh okay what

03:02.720 --> 03:08.080
happened we all want to know oh my kids wanted me to take them to roller skating so they went

03:08.080 --> 03:14.000
roller skating and I I used to roller blade like a ton like all the time and the last time we went

03:14.000 --> 03:21.700
rollerblading which was not that long ago I my one of my straps on my blades broke so I had to

03:21.700 --> 03:27.040
rent a pair today and so they had like a speed skating in session which I like doing that's fun

03:27.880 --> 03:32.400
so I tried to go around the corner you know I usually crisscross the kind of go faster

03:32.400 --> 03:36.800
over around the corners and because they're profiling the wheels is different than what

03:36.800 --> 03:43.400
I'm used to it slipped inside I hit the ground on my knee rolled to my elbow and then got back

03:43.400 --> 03:50.400
up so it's it scraped it a little bit but it's like I'm like ow but I'm gonna get back up and

03:50.400 --> 03:56.400
just keep going I mean it's not like I broke my leg or something congrats you're old it's not

03:56.400 --> 04:00.880
all this is what I used to do like all the time I've done this I've gotten this injury so many

04:00.880 --> 04:07.600
times at least it was in a rink and not on like asphalt which is typically the case true I have

04:07.600 --> 04:13.360
a sun-bleached spot on the sweater do you oh well oh well well you've had it a while episode 3 was

04:13.360 --> 04:18.600
out so you know episode 9 is coming out soon I was at the movies yesterday we will get into gaming's

04:18.600 --> 04:22.560
but it just wouldn't be an episode of orange entre do if there weren't tangents you know no it's

04:22.560 --> 04:26.160
funny though when we were in the rink sorry how a tangent to the tangent November because we had

04:26.160 --> 04:30.800
talked about like we should do something like like stupid for like one of these like big like

04:30.800 --> 04:35.840
numbered episodes or something and I was like suggesting like hey we could rent out the roller

04:35.840 --> 04:40.400
because that's dirt cheap huh and so I thought about that again well our live on roller skates

04:40.400 --> 04:47.480
yeah why here's the thing let me let me loan you some sage advice for having done this for 800

04:47.480 --> 04:54.560
episodes why do we have to do it for 800 episodes why can't we celebrate 823 like every you do

04:54.560 --> 05:00.720
whatever we want every episode should be celebrated every every every olr is a blessing every week we

05:00.720 --> 05:09.240
don't kill each other is a success story is it not it's a toll-free episode anyway going to wait

05:09.240 --> 05:13.920
what was my oh yes I went to the movies I went to see knives out which you know I want to see that

05:13.920 --> 05:19.480
because it's like clue it what I hear like clue dark here's a lot of my friends really loved it

05:19.480 --> 05:24.240
I liked it I didn't love it but I liked it and I don't know if it was really clue I don't know if

05:24.240 --> 05:29.160
you can be clue when you reference clue in the film however it did have Jamie Lee Curtis who's

05:29.160 --> 05:33.720
a gamer we all know that right and she was great there just wasn't enough of her like I think there

05:33.720 --> 05:37.080
was a lot of people in it where I was like we hardly got to see him but anyway that's all I

05:37.080 --> 05:42.560
don't want spoil too much anyway so anyway um I also want to say I I am looking at chat because

05:42.600 --> 05:48.200
again we tape live over at twitch TV slash vog network and I you guys are really donating biddies

05:48.200 --> 05:51.920
tonight and I see you guys doing I don't usually call out all the bit donations because they go

05:51.920 --> 05:57.080
across the bottom but I will at the end of the show when we're not recording for the podcast but

05:57.080 --> 06:03.440
I see several of you are doing 800 biddies for 800 episodes and I know that's no small amount

06:03.440 --> 06:09.360
of biddies so I really want to just acknowledge that and say thank you that is very very kind and

06:09.360 --> 06:16.480
you know we wanted to at the top of the show here you know even if we've done 500 episodes

06:16.480 --> 06:23.240
and 200 episodes and 700 episodes and we've done 10 years and 12 years and so forth I I I didn't

06:23.240 --> 06:26.400
want to toot our own horn too much but I didn't want to take this opportunity at the top of the

06:26.400 --> 06:33.160
show to just say thanks I mean you guys are truly what keeps this going gives us that energy to do

06:33.160 --> 06:38.160
this show every week even when maybe we're feeling a little sick or we've injured ourselves earlier

06:38.160 --> 06:42.680
in the day and maybe we don't necessarily always feel like coming in showing up to doing it it's

06:42.680 --> 06:46.960
like by the time we're here and you guys are here and interacting with it and bringing that

06:46.960 --> 06:55.100
enthusiasm that you guys do it really means a lot and obviously if we haven't broken it big by now

06:55.100 --> 07:00.520
800 episodes and 17 years in we're probably not going to but I think we all made peace with that

07:00.520 --> 07:06.640
a long time ago and still even with our small audience we have a very loyal and great little

07:06.720 --> 07:13.560
family here and that's okay I like small families I don't I mean like when I used to go to the

07:13.560 --> 07:18.200
extended family for holidays that's what all the messes happen that's all the drama and political

07:18.200 --> 07:24.600
start small family gatherings awesome so we like the small family that we have here and I still you

07:24.600 --> 07:31.560
know this show has afforded us many opportunities still even with its you know smaller size than I

07:31.560 --> 07:36.600
think I would have ever gotten otherwise we were just talking about on Bobby's show before we went

07:36.600 --> 07:41.600
live tonight a cameo that we had in a video game like that would have never happened if it wasn't

07:41.600 --> 07:48.600
for this show we got to go to e3 back when it was cool like in its most heyday years you know that

07:48.600 --> 07:53.640
was something because of this show that you know we got to do and and there's been other industry

07:53.640 --> 08:02.080
events I've I have been an acknowledged professional at a very large convention every

08:02.080 --> 08:07.320
year for the past couple years that is an amazing feat that I'm so thankful and humble for with this

08:07.320 --> 08:11.800
show so thank you guys so much for showing up every week and giving us that motivation we need

08:11.800 --> 08:17.840
to keep doing this show every single week thank you thank you thank you and yeah I let swung tongue

08:17.840 --> 08:25.080
gave a donation and said happy 800 that's all I got that's okay you know we the the bits are

08:25.080 --> 08:31.520
an extra thank you we'd never expect them but they are very very much appreciated and help us

08:31.520 --> 08:36.520
to keep vog network as a business and do business II type of things that we do want to continue to

08:36.520 --> 08:44.760
expand on yeah swung tongue said you were on TV that's true we thank you for reminding me yeah

08:44.760 --> 08:50.640
there was a couple times and on in the newspaper which I still have that somewhere yeah I had it

08:50.640 --> 08:55.840
it's really yellow though yeah it was it was early on in the life of the show when we were in the

08:55.840 --> 09:00.400
newspaper because that was right when podcasting first broke and if you search for like Sacramento

09:00.400 --> 09:06.720
in iTunes you got us like there wasn't you know now there's probably shows about Sacramento in

09:06.720 --> 09:11.240
there and you know there's other that Sacramento has a number one gaming podcast now that comes up

09:11.240 --> 09:19.160
in the results and all this other stuff that wasn't there back when we started so yeah like

09:19.160 --> 09:24.840
we were what came up so the newspaper came out to do that and then the news station came out and did

09:24.840 --> 09:30.720
one story at my place about podcasting but then what was really cool is that they remembered us

09:30.720 --> 09:35.600
or something because when Guitar Hero came out the first one they would I wasn't there it was just

09:35.600 --> 09:42.200
you and Loki so maybe hide on my bimani stuff oh yeah oh because the Guitar Hero guy the like PR

09:42.200 --> 09:47.480
guy for a red or was it red octane at the time so you went as well to like he gave you guys a

09:47.480 --> 09:53.320
personal demo of the game we have all the fun with it yeah no it's cool it was very very very

09:53.320 --> 10:00.040
cool appreciate that and we had that nice big TV in the living room at the house in is a few

10:00.040 --> 10:04.880
houses ago for me yeah but you know that house oh no I do yeah I do nice and shiny in there

10:04.880 --> 10:08.560
I'm a necessary 100 Matt and chat says it's so much fun yeah that's where that quote came from

10:08.560 --> 10:13.920
it's still on YouTube there's an orange on radio YouTube channel and you can still see that old

10:13.920 --> 10:19.960
story it's an old story at this point yeah well what my god how many years ago to Dave Walker

10:19.960 --> 10:28.480
retire and he's the one doing the the news anchor thing introducing the story I don't know also

10:28.480 --> 10:35.720
here's the other interesting thing about that story they never name our show they never cuz

10:35.720 --> 10:41.600
they're assholes they know I don't know if it's because they can't endorse it or whatever but

10:41.600 --> 10:48.520
they never name our show um to be fair they also say at one point in the news story governor

10:48.520 --> 10:53.800
Schwarzenegger just started a podcast because again it's that old so they said governor

10:53.800 --> 10:57.920
Schwarzenegger started a podcast but they never named that program either because remember they

10:57.920 --> 11:06.520
had the kid on the skateboard yeah I was like podcast listener you young person do you know

11:06.520 --> 11:14.240
what podcasts are why yes sir I do it's funny that it made us such a niche thing back then

11:14.240 --> 11:19.800
and now it's like now podcasting is that stereotype thing where it's like you know

11:19.800 --> 11:23.760
you've all heard those jokes and I why don't you have a podcast yet or I hate these jokes

11:23.760 --> 11:27.960
but I hate them but we've all heard them the one you know what do you call three white dudes in

11:27.960 --> 11:33.800
their 30s in the basement a podcast you know that that whole thing and I'm just like the podcast I

11:33.800 --> 11:37.720
I don't like that joke because I really really want podcasting to be for everybody I heard that

11:37.720 --> 11:42.880
one yeah I have it's it's it's stupid I've seen it on Twitter I've seen a lot of really dumb

11:42.880 --> 11:48.480
podcast jokes on Twitter and I that's one thing that like really irks me is that podcasting is

11:48.480 --> 11:55.080
like because I think those jokes reinforce that it's only for one particular audience when it

11:55.080 --> 11:59.800
really isn't it's really for everybody like everybody should be able to get their voice

11:59.800 --> 12:04.840
out there and be heard and it's not just podcasting because now we live in this era of YouTube as much

12:04.840 --> 12:11.160
as I don't like YouTube as a business and twitch where you know you can get on and have your own

12:11.160 --> 12:16.040
streams and stuff they're really it's really really easy to have your voice heard when you

12:16.040 --> 12:20.040
know again back in 2006 when these news stations featured us it was a little bit more of a novelty

12:20.040 --> 12:26.880
wasn't it anyway all right anyhow sorry I it was a little bit of a tangent but we wanted to say

12:26.880 --> 12:31.280
something here at the top of the show for episode number 800 so again thank you all for being with

12:31.280 --> 12:35.080
us let's get into some video game news because I know that's what we're really about here at

12:35.080 --> 12:42.440
the show what I was watching the video of my DDR pads are in the background oh yeah oh yeah that

12:42.440 --> 12:47.200
was pretty funny yeah for sure oh my gosh Matt you look so young all right anyway let's get into

12:47.200 --> 12:54.000
our kickoff topic tonight which has to do with pokemons so Loki you want to start us off here

12:54.000 --> 12:58.080
with this kickoff topic about what's going on with the Pokemon Pokemon company so apparently arrest

12:58.080 --> 13:04.240
you they're gonna they're gonna come and find you they have a specific set of skills that they're

13:04.240 --> 13:10.840
gonna use to find you and kill you or something but anyways so yes apparently the Pokemon company

13:10.840 --> 13:18.440
hired some outside forensic experts who are trying to locate I guess some people that leaked

13:18.440 --> 13:25.760
information about Pokemon so they had been able to identify for discord users one who was the

13:25.760 --> 13:32.880
source and a few others that were helping him spread the images through 4chan and reddit and

13:32.960 --> 13:38.400
with that of course they've since they found their usernames they don't know who those people are so

13:38.400 --> 13:44.920
now they've gone to the district court in Seattle to try to get a hold of that information from

13:44.920 --> 13:52.560
discord and 4chan to try to track down who the people are under those usernames so that's

13:52.560 --> 13:59.560
interesting I don't know this has been done like but is it really a crime to leak information about

13:59.720 --> 14:05.520
something I mean if you're not under an NDA and somehow you came across that information is that

14:05.520 --> 14:11.200
really a crime well that's the problem is that somewhere along the line in NDA had to be broken

14:11.200 --> 14:16.360
like if I just happenstance accidentally came across something then somebody still broke an

14:16.360 --> 14:20.600
NDA to get the game but then that person be in trouble but like if I if I like how do you find

14:20.600 --> 14:25.560
that out but say I broke an NDA but they know one person but like say I broke an NDA and gave

14:25.560 --> 14:29.480
information to somebody else and then that person didn't spread the information out but now you're

14:29.480 --> 14:35.440
hunting after this person that doesn't make any sense to me because it's not a crime it's an

14:35.440 --> 14:41.280
inconvenience for your marketing campaign but it's not a crime it's not a crime as in you can't go to

14:41.280 --> 14:48.160
jail per se but they would have a case in civil court and I think I kind of think they have a

14:48.160 --> 14:55.120
right to protect themselves in that capacity because you know it's just like if the new Star

14:55.120 --> 15:00.280
Wars movie leaked to the internet tomorrow you know three weeks before it's supposed to be in

15:00.280 --> 15:04.720
theaters would it necessarily be the person who leaked its fault if it was something that was

15:04.720 --> 15:10.280
given to them no but it's still going to financially damage the results of the film that's copyright

15:10.280 --> 15:14.720
theft that's that's not say that'd be like if you leaked a copy of Pokemon Sword and Shield to the

15:14.720 --> 15:18.680
internet and then people based played that and they're like oh here's all the secrets that's

15:18.680 --> 15:24.040
different versus like here's some information I've heard about like say that would be the equivalent

15:24.040 --> 15:30.400
of somebody leaking the script for Star Wars the new Star Wars movie or the bits of the script of

15:30.400 --> 15:38.920
the new Star Wars movie I don't know I still think it's a slippery slope but I guess they got to try

15:38.920 --> 15:46.680
Elliot B in our chat says detective Pikachu on the case absolutely why we are in chat says argument

15:46.680 --> 15:50.520
I own this physical copy of the game I can do with it as I please counter argument you don't

15:50.520 --> 15:54.840
own the software your license to use it and doing this is a violation of the license agreement I

15:54.840 --> 15:59.000
don't think anybody's going to jail over this but I think Nintendo wants to figure out where is the

15:59.000 --> 16:05.240
leak so we can plug it up you know and potentially go after somebody in a civil court now I I had

16:05.240 --> 16:09.560
heard a story about this but you can take it with a grain of salt because I don't have the article

16:09.560 --> 16:14.120
or the receipts to back it up so maybe this is full of shit and I'm fully admitting that but I

16:14.120 --> 16:22.120
had heard that there were live streams of Pokemon days before it was released that were somehow

16:22.120 --> 16:27.880
altered or edited or maybe pre-releases or something that made the game look worse than it

16:27.880 --> 16:33.720
actually was when it came to things like loading times yeah things of that nature but that's kind

16:33.720 --> 16:39.960
of bullshit like and this was this was angry Dex it you know people that just wanted to bag on game

16:39.960 --> 16:45.720
that's still though I mean you're gonna have a hard time proving damages for something like

16:45.720 --> 16:51.480
that because you can say well this one video got out there and we suffered you know X number of

16:51.480 --> 16:57.880
dollars in damages yeah but like if you sign an NDA that says if you spill you are it says in that

16:57.880 --> 17:02.200
NDA you will pay one million dollars and I'm thinking in my mind today there was just some

17:02.200 --> 17:07.400
article going around Facebook today because this was a ridiculous use of an NDA but um a comic one

17:07.400 --> 17:11.400
of the guys from Saturday Night Live the young guy that was with Ariana Grande for a short time

17:11.400 --> 17:16.680
what the hell's his name the kid from Davidson him okay he was doing a stand-up show in San Francisco

17:16.680 --> 17:23.800
he was making people sign NDAs and the NDA said in it somebody posted it online like you uh would

17:23.800 --> 17:28.840
pay one million dollars if you even like talked about the contents of the show online and people

17:28.840 --> 17:33.960
were saying how ridiculous that was because you couldn't even criticize or critique the show I

17:33.960 --> 17:37.960
mean it's one thing to be like you can't have your cell phones out during the show because that is

17:37.960 --> 17:42.520
pretty bullshit when people record stand-up comic routines and put it on their own YouTube yeah that

17:42.520 --> 17:49.160
is that's that's joke theft you know it's it's it's not that's copyright theft exactly um so

17:49.160 --> 17:53.960
that's you know not okay but to take it to the extremes of an NDA where you can't even critique

17:53.960 --> 17:57.880
it that's a little bit like you're not really within your realm here anyway the reason why I

17:57.880 --> 18:02.440
bring that up is because it showed the NDA and it said you break this you pay a million dollars so

18:02.440 --> 18:09.080
you know in Nintendo's NDA and any NDA um if you go on a reality tv show like survivor where

18:09.640 --> 18:14.120
they know who won survivor whatever the next one is they already know because it's already been

18:14.120 --> 18:20.040
filmed and done I mean okay technically they don't know who wins wins until they reveal the votes

18:20.040 --> 18:23.960
but they know they know generally who gets voted out when and who's in the fight right but and it's

18:23.960 --> 18:29.400
in their contract you break this you're paying like four million dollars they don't it's up to

18:29.400 --> 18:35.880
that it's it could say you could fake you could face penalties of this whereas I still think

18:35.880 --> 18:41.560
though even if there was a contract like that I still have a hard time believing that they can

18:41.560 --> 18:47.640
prove damages on that okay but counterpoint who has the better lawyers Nintendo or 4chan kid

18:49.880 --> 18:55.800
just saying Nintendo's gonna yeah but but to that though Pokemon company so to that though

18:55.800 --> 19:00.840
like I don't know where 4chan is necessarily located is but it's not the site they're only

19:00.840 --> 19:05.640
trying to get the site to reveal who it is but like if they're but if I understand that though

19:05.640 --> 19:09.400
but if they're in a foreign country if they're look central in a foreign country they can say

19:09.400 --> 19:13.880
fuck you and your stupid you know court order we're not gonna follow it if Nintendo doesn't

19:13.880 --> 19:19.320
have a presence in that country but remember Nintendo has established in USA Canada Japan

19:19.960 --> 19:25.800
many parts of uh you know overseas in Britain and surrounding countries I think they're gonna

19:25.800 --> 19:33.960
have better luck with discord but but even still though that I don't know I think it's a it's a

19:33.960 --> 19:40.120
slippery slope because then then what then you're gonna like start saying oh well these people they

19:40.120 --> 19:45.240
they had bad things to say about our game let's find out who they are I mean like you could argue

19:45.240 --> 19:50.600
that they cause damages because of their negative critique I understand that they should be

19:50.600 --> 19:58.680
protected but but I'm Nintendo and I can fucking sue people so I don't know I go ahead just the

19:58.680 --> 20:04.040
thing is is that with any kind of tech company be it software hardware you name it they're

20:05.720 --> 20:13.160
part of their financial security lies in secrecy it lies in having something be locked to your

20:14.120 --> 20:24.120
self as a proprietary secret so that when you release said item to to quote a term from another

20:24.120 --> 20:31.800
company your customers are surprised and delighted by it to have anything sneak out about it

20:31.800 --> 20:41.880
beforehand is going to impact that it may you know chase people off of buying the product it may

20:41.960 --> 20:47.080
affect those upcoming sales and I think that what they're doing is not over reactionary at all

20:47.960 --> 20:55.320
I think that it's like you said they have a leak to plug just because it happens now does not mean

20:55.320 --> 21:05.720
this will not happen again right and so I actually I think even just by pursuing it the the simple

21:05.720 --> 21:10.040
pursuit of it will set a precedence that companies are going to take it seriously

21:10.600 --> 21:15.960
I think for the most part like I don't think it's a big deal that like final evolution you know I

21:15.960 --> 21:20.280
realize for hardcore Pokemon fans it is a big deal but I do agree with Loki in a sense that like you

21:20.280 --> 21:25.640
know certain types of information getting leaked is not a big deal oh no you saw what Grookey's

21:25.640 --> 21:30.040
final form looked like you know like like how would like let's just assume that like nothing

21:30.040 --> 21:34.760
got leaked how would people be taking like this Dexit stuff like because I don't think they

21:34.840 --> 21:40.360
announced like here's the Pokemon well you're you just walked right into what my follow-up point is

21:40.360 --> 21:44.200
is I think that's what actually makes this a little bit different and why Nintendo wants to

21:44.200 --> 21:49.880
go after it because of that hard negativity about Dexit that was online which ultimately didn't

21:49.880 --> 21:56.440
matter when it came to sales because it really is selling thing yeah but it still leaks showed you

21:56.440 --> 22:01.480
who was missing and that was something Nintendo was trying to protect and I think that might be

22:01.480 --> 22:06.680
the key difference here is that I think it's that specifically where that kind of crossed the line

22:06.680 --> 22:10.600
for Nintendo was that they knew this was something that was negative and all the ramp up and they did

22:10.600 --> 22:16.440
not want it out there who specifically was cut until till the final minute I just kind of think

22:16.440 --> 22:25.000
that's what was going on now if and I'm gonna say bold if underline if if okay circled it's true

22:25.000 --> 22:30.600
that somebody was streaming it and they were streaming a misrepresented fully copy of the game

22:30.600 --> 22:34.200
then I think Nintendo should take that person for everything they got honestly because I think

22:34.200 --> 22:37.320
that is fucked if they're streaming though they should be able to find them through

22:37.960 --> 22:42.360
Twitch or YouTube or whomever so again that but that and that's if that was even true which might

22:42.360 --> 22:47.720
not have been this is just something I was told so but I think that is way past the line of what's

22:47.720 --> 22:52.280
acceptable and so forth and I think especially if you're you're streaming a game you're misrepresenting

22:52.280 --> 22:57.080
what that game even is which is so weird that we live in this world where you have to talk about

22:57.080 --> 23:04.040
that but I mean y'all have heard of in fake news and I was trying to think of another name for it

23:04.040 --> 23:10.360
but I can't it's fake news and what you know the social media does in the spread of that type of

23:10.360 --> 23:16.120
you know heavily partisan one way or another type of news and so forth I mean here we are where

23:16.120 --> 23:21.320
video games are now kind of walking down the similar path we have we have fake video game news

23:22.200 --> 23:27.960
maybe but I imagine we're not that far away from that being a reality so anyway but I think the

23:27.960 --> 23:32.520
DeXit thing at its core is what you know Nintendo was was trying to protect now at the end of the

23:32.520 --> 23:36.920
day you know and I've said this on a previous episode of OLR whereas I think the DeXit thing

23:36.920 --> 23:41.080
is like oh man that would have been like that would have been the icing that would have been

23:41.080 --> 23:45.480
like the that would have been that sweet glaze that extra thing that would have made this a

23:46.200 --> 23:51.560
perfect fucking dessert Pokemon Sword and Shield is still a really fucking good dessert and I'll

23:51.560 --> 23:57.480
get into more of that later on I think it's it's a great game personally so I mean is the DeXit

23:57.480 --> 24:03.000
thing noticed yeah is it does it damn the whole game I don't think so I think there's still plenty

24:03.000 --> 24:09.640
of variety and things to do then why hide it like I don't understand like if it's such it's if it I

24:09.640 --> 24:15.320
it just seems disingenuous to me is the whole point it's like oh we want to hide it before

24:16.200 --> 24:20.600
so we get all those pre-sale copies out there and then it's like oh now you can find out about it

24:20.600 --> 24:25.240
like I don't know based on the social media and that negativity on social media there was probably

24:25.240 --> 24:30.840
a legit concern within Nintendo that it would impact sales I mean now do you just say oh well

24:30.840 --> 24:37.160
it didn't impact it uh sales all harm no all harm don't you want to have your in consumers be well

24:37.160 --> 24:40.840
I guess you don't want your consumers to be well informed when purchasing your products you don't

24:40.840 --> 24:45.800
want to know like what intricacies there are so they can make a you know educated decision in

24:45.800 --> 24:50.840
their purchase I mean I guess that should be expected from a company that sells two copies

24:50.840 --> 24:57.640
of their game every year so why not I don't know I just I have a hard time giving them a bit here

24:57.640 --> 25:04.040
Loki and say you know what Rey is Princess Leia's sister enjoy episode nine now that's not a real

25:04.040 --> 25:07.400
spoiler I don't know shit about what goes on that movie and I don't think age-wise that would work

25:07.400 --> 25:11.960
anyway I made that up so don't worry exhale it's a fake spoiler but let's just say I did I just

25:11.960 --> 25:15.560
blurred it out I just want you to be informed before you go see that movie here's the big

25:15.560 --> 25:21.720
here's the big spoiler about the ending I mean isn't that kind of fucked up and like wouldn't

25:21.720 --> 25:26.520
I mean wouldn't like you know if I'm advertising on my website you know like oh here's the big

25:26.520 --> 25:32.200
twist at the end of episode nine it's like IGM publishes this headline no I guess in the sense

25:32.200 --> 25:36.440
if you're trying to say that that's different than the expectations I would have for the movie

25:36.440 --> 25:41.720
then that would be a huge um spoiler I picked something ridiculous so you all wouldn't panic

25:41.720 --> 25:47.240
so no my my under see what I'm saying is so is it's drastically different from other pokemon

25:47.240 --> 25:54.280
game whereas the other pokemon games they have they continue to add to you know the full um

25:55.240 --> 25:59.800
list of pokemon they keep adding to it whereas this is the first one where they have taken

25:59.800 --> 26:05.560
some away and then added some to that as well so that is what I'm saying about being well

26:05.560 --> 26:12.120
informed because most people going into it having not known that might think oh hey cool I'm gonna

26:12.120 --> 26:15.560
have all my favorite pokemon in there plus I'm gonna get some new ones and then they go there

26:15.560 --> 26:21.000
and wait a second where are these pokemon oh they were taken out of the game I didn't know that that

26:21.000 --> 26:26.200
kind of sucks you know and that that is what I'm talking about being you know well informed about

26:26.200 --> 26:30.280
a games if you're taking something and you're drastically changing something to be fair they

26:30.280 --> 26:34.680
weren't that shifty about it they announced like as far back as e3 that not all the pokemon were

26:34.680 --> 26:38.520
going to be in it because they were asked that question very directly is every pokemon in this

26:38.520 --> 26:44.680
game and they did say no and that was what started the whole hubbub then finally somebody got a copy

26:44.680 --> 26:50.040
of the game and said oh I I have the answer here find out if your faves made the cut here's the list

26:50.040 --> 26:55.560
and then here cue the reddit post once a day here is one pokemon family that has been eliminated

26:55.560 --> 27:03.080
from pokemon it's so fucking dramatic jesus christ jigglypuff well she dead so

27:04.040 --> 27:05.080
enjoy pokemon

27:07.960 --> 27:15.960
anyway rest in peace jigglypuff with the you know all forever in our hearts with carnations

27:15.960 --> 27:21.720
tombstone I mean come on loki some people are really fucking dramatic about this dexa thing

27:21.720 --> 27:26.440
it's not again it's not that big a deal would it have made would it have made a nine and a half

27:26.440 --> 27:30.760
game of 10 probably I mean I don't know I don't know I don't even know if I'd say that all right

27:30.840 --> 27:36.680
technical issues aside too but you know yeah well yeah I would say the internet issues and the uh

27:36.680 --> 27:42.040
wild area like how it fucking chokes when you're online I would say those issues are a way bigger

27:42.040 --> 27:48.200
deal than the dexa thing but anyway all right um let's move on so we're gonna move on past

27:48.200 --> 27:53.160
pokemons and talk about how was your gaming week which I left off the sidebar tonight isn't that

27:53.160 --> 27:57.320
convenient all right so I guess I'll back it up how was your gaming week folks what types of

27:57.320 --> 28:01.800
video games have you been playing this week dark soccer why don't you start us off I didn't really

28:01.800 --> 28:07.480
play a whole lot um just because I had to bake five batches of cookies on Tuesday night after

28:07.480 --> 28:12.760
work the holidays were this week so you know I had to yeah I had to because they were for three

28:12.760 --> 28:19.000
different events that I had obligated myself to um and then actually I know I take that back because

28:19.000 --> 28:25.000
we did have a lot of virtual racing going on in my house on Wednesday night like they stayed up

28:25.000 --> 28:28.840
for hours playing fucking virtual racing I'm like it's virtual racing I don't give a shit

28:28.840 --> 28:35.480
and play a bunch of pinball and then um actually I did get to play the jersey jack pirates of the

28:35.480 --> 28:42.520
caribbean on Thursday because we went to a friend's place for thanksgiving and I got to play that and

28:42.520 --> 28:49.960
I got to play um a Jurassic Park the new Jurassic Park stern pinball and I played a little bit of

28:49.960 --> 28:54.440
Star Trek because it was there um there's also a uh an iron maiden but I don't really care for the

28:54.440 --> 28:57.640
iron maiden table I still really need to come over and play that Elvira table while you still

28:57.640 --> 29:02.040
have it yeah I played Elvira and Alan needs to play it too it's his table Alan's the one that

29:02.040 --> 29:06.440
messaged me he's like I had no idea about this I'm like I told Rob he's sleeping on the couch

29:07.000 --> 29:11.560
you know virtual racing has just about enough polygons for the Tesla Cybertruck in there so

29:11.560 --> 29:16.520
we have a story on that later actually but um I guess I did do some gaming I just I didn't play

29:16.520 --> 29:23.080
Pokemon which I thought I would but I also played my usual phone shit and then then I got like the

29:23.160 --> 29:30.280
plague and so I didn't play much played a lot of solitaire all right well I play solitaire every

29:30.280 --> 29:36.120
day at work why not solitaire so it's one of those standby good classics it's like my brain

29:36.120 --> 29:44.200
D I'm more of a mind sweeper kid but you know I look at it as the the the frying pan of my brain

29:45.320 --> 29:50.120
solitaire is the deglazer for the font the fond the bottom of my pan

29:50.120 --> 29:55.240
all right let's move on Loki how was your gaming week I don't know did the holidays get in the way

29:55.240 --> 30:01.160
of your gaming I didn't really play a lot of the games during the holidays I played Minecraft Earth

30:01.160 --> 30:08.920
a bit and very little Pokemon go that's pretty much it I've been mainly just trying to work on

30:08.920 --> 30:14.200
my game so I've been working on the procedural level generation portion of it and I got I got

30:14.200 --> 30:20.520
it pretty much done I'm just dialing it in now because I want it to look a certain way

30:21.240 --> 30:27.320
and it's just deciding between like different settings so that I get it to be just how I want

30:27.320 --> 30:34.440
it without because you know I had I had done it in a certain way where it was just like getting

30:34.440 --> 30:40.360
ridiculously meandering everywhere I was like no not quite what I want so it's just dialing that in

30:40.360 --> 30:44.440
right now and then once I get that done I have to find a way to traverse the room so that I can make

30:45.080 --> 30:49.720
the doors one way in a certain way so that I don't get trapped in a dead end because there's

30:49.720 --> 30:55.480
no backtracking in the game so yeah that's what I've been working on most of the time that's why

30:55.480 --> 31:01.320
I did not play very many games and didn't really buy that many games either because you know it's

31:01.320 --> 31:08.360
all the sales and everything I looked at stuff I don't think I bought anything all right maybe I

31:08.360 --> 31:14.760
will I wanted to get beat saver but oddly enough that is not on sale most of the sales go through

31:14.760 --> 31:20.280
tomorrow which is you know cyber monday so well I mean a lot of the big sellers they don't really

31:20.280 --> 31:24.840
discount because they're so it's uh death stranding you know I was hoping there'd be a black friday

31:24.840 --> 31:29.960
sale on it nope still too new there was no black friday sale anywhere on it so um and I'll get to

31:29.960 --> 31:33.960
that here shortly but I ended up paying the full 60 bucks in order to be able to play it so whatever

31:34.520 --> 31:39.480
I knew that was probably going to be the case but I thought maybe there'd be a discount who knows

31:39.480 --> 31:43.240
all right anything else you want to talk about that's it all right let me talk about my gaming

31:43.240 --> 31:48.520
week here a little bit so um unlike my co-hosts um probably because I didn't do a lot for the

31:48.520 --> 31:53.480
holidays it's just myself Alan and my dad and we had a great thanksgiving dinner though but we go

31:53.480 --> 31:57.560
out to eat because you don't want to eat what I'm going to cook and like nobody wants to cook so we

31:57.560 --> 32:02.440
go out so thank you to the folks at restaurants that that stay open on thanksgiving so that folks

32:02.440 --> 32:06.360
who you know don't really aren't going to cook a great dinner still have a place to eat and I

32:06.360 --> 32:11.640
will say we went to a great place we went to the brazilian steakhouse out in roseville which uh so

32:11.640 --> 32:16.440
we had the meat on the swords and what was cute was that for their um like you know how they have

32:16.440 --> 32:20.520
the food the salad bar right yeah and usually they'll have a selection of hot foods there like

32:20.520 --> 32:25.960
soups and things what they did is they replaced all the hot food with turkey mashed potatoes

32:25.960 --> 32:29.480
cranberry I thought they had like the turkey on the swords too no they didn't have the turkey

32:29.480 --> 32:35.000
on the swords turkey was over at the salad bar oh that's lame yeah so not quite the same but um

32:35.000 --> 32:39.640
believe me there was no shortage of amazing meat I just felt bad for my dad because he kind of

32:39.640 --> 32:43.240
filled up on all the traditional stuff but I think that's what he wanted he wanted to have more of the

32:43.240 --> 32:47.240
traditional stuff so he didn't get to try because he was already full by the time all those stuff

32:47.240 --> 32:52.680
where it's like Alan and myself were like let's let's split half a piece of turkey and a scoop of

32:52.680 --> 32:56.840
mashed potatoes and then that was like all we ate and it was like let's not fill up bring on that

32:56.840 --> 33:01.240
bacon that's that's what my wife always says she's like don't fill up on the garbage don't

33:01.240 --> 33:05.160
fill up on the salad fill up on the meat it's what we're here for you're paying for the meat

33:05.160 --> 33:09.480
you eat the meat he's absolutely right all right but so that was great so thanksgiving was great

33:09.480 --> 33:14.680
but outside of that we didn't have a whole lot going on so I played like a shitload of games

33:14.680 --> 33:20.440
honestly um I was out playing pokemon go since you brought that up uh a friend of mine took me out

33:20.440 --> 33:25.800
who plays the game a lot and was trying to help me along with the team rocket stuff to get Giovanni

33:25.800 --> 33:31.640
for this month for the shadow articuno I didn't get all the way there but I did purify 15 pokemon

33:31.640 --> 33:35.880
and like I did a lot of those team rocket fights but then like if it hadn't been raining these past

33:35.880 --> 33:39.640
couple days I probably would have finished it but the rain starting here kind of like you know you

33:39.640 --> 33:45.240
don't want to go outside as much so I didn't end up finishing uh that up but um you know I made a

33:45.240 --> 33:49.400
lot of I've done a lot more of those team rocket fights than I ever have since it started I probably

33:49.400 --> 33:54.040
did like three times as many in the past three days I have since that whole thing started so

33:54.040 --> 34:01.560
there's that um bonds 006 says I detest those damn tr fights so much yeah they're not my favorite

34:01.560 --> 34:07.080
thing but you know my friend made a good point about it was that it kind of gives another thing

34:07.080 --> 34:13.400
to do in the game like another reason to craft these pokemon a certain way and have other pokemon

34:13.400 --> 34:17.560
have the spotlight that maybe were monopolizing in the gym battles so it's like you have this

34:17.560 --> 34:22.520
other thing to kind of work for and do besides just oh I have to catch shinies or oh I have to

34:22.520 --> 34:27.000
catch you know perfect hundred percent the ones that you get though the purified ones or when you

34:27.000 --> 34:30.840
do purify them they're not very strong they're they're really not they're kind of hit and miss

34:30.840 --> 34:35.640
like those articuno's are crappy now I would think what you do is you save them for a lucky trade and

34:35.640 --> 34:39.640
then trade them but I'm told you can't trade purified pokemon I don't know if that's true or

34:39.640 --> 34:46.040
not but I would think that's the way to get around the low IVs but I did I fought a Bulbasaur um over

34:46.040 --> 34:51.560
at the park not by my house but the other one I fought a Bulbasaur and after I purified it it was

34:51.560 --> 34:58.040
15 14 14 so I evolved at once to a Venusaur and then before I evolved I'm sorry I evolved at

34:58.040 --> 35:03.080
once to Ivysaur and then before I hit the button to do it Venusaur I heard my friend in the back

35:03.080 --> 35:08.280
of my mind say you don't want to evolve that yet because community day is coming up and all those

35:08.280 --> 35:12.040
moves will come back and I was like oh shit that's right so I held off and I didn't evolve it all the

35:12.040 --> 35:17.400
way to Venusaur so wait for community day so I have that purified pokemon that's high levels

35:17.400 --> 35:24.280
that'll be fun so anyway um I also played um so this is fun I have a little bit of b-roll of this

35:24.280 --> 35:29.400
oh yes b-roll yay b-roll so um unfortunately it's not going to be great for those of you guys in the

35:29.400 --> 35:34.840
podcast uh so I apologize but I will talk through this here a little bit so um earlier today I took

35:34.840 --> 35:41.480
a some b-roll of myself playing destiny 2 on google stadia so uh this is what you guys are

35:41.480 --> 35:45.880
going to see watch now is I'm firing up google stadia and I kind of wanted to show you guys what

35:45.880 --> 35:50.440
it looked like so like the process and uh the green screen effect was horrible I didn't have

35:50.440 --> 35:56.120
a chance to tune it so just uh please especially as the the monitor my main monitor gets bright and

35:56.120 --> 36:01.960
dark the green screen screws up more and more so um sorry about that so anyway uh how did I get

36:01.960 --> 36:07.720
google stadia did I buy it no those buddy passes came out where you can give it to a friend and a

36:07.720 --> 36:12.520
friend can get three months so our pal Bobby Blackwolf who's on before us here Sunday nights

36:12.520 --> 36:17.800
at vog was a buddy and gave me his buddy pass so I could check out with google state so I could do

36:17.800 --> 36:23.160
impressions here on the show just like he did his a little bit uh except and and Jason did a fabulous

36:23.160 --> 36:27.160
job here on this show and him and Bobby both talked about samurai showdown so I was like

36:27.160 --> 36:31.480
well I'll play the other game I don't I don't mind I mean I know not a lot of first-person shooters

36:31.480 --> 36:34.920
people want to play but I don't mind destiny too I think it uh the destiny series is one of the

36:34.920 --> 36:40.760
better uh first-person shooters so why not so you'll notice for those that are watching I'm

36:40.760 --> 36:45.960
still trying to get into the game so spoiler alert it still takes a good two minutes to launch the

36:45.960 --> 36:52.360
game now that's because I'm counting the time of you gotta wait for the game to load up stadia then

36:52.360 --> 36:56.840
you gotta get to the start menu and then it does all the security checks after the start menu and

36:56.840 --> 37:00.680
then you gotta pick what you want to do and then here in this phase I'm waiting for two other

37:00.680 --> 37:05.160
people to join my fire team so I can go down and do this random thing I don't even I haven't even

37:05.160 --> 37:09.480
been paying attention to the stories I've been playing um but I can go I'm waiting patiently so

37:09.480 --> 37:14.280
I can go down uh on the fire team and go to the planet and uh do what I need to do it's like

37:14.280 --> 37:19.000
Final Fantasy 11 all over again yeah waiting for group now quest buster in chat says wow I'm behind

37:19.000 --> 37:25.080
on light levels the game starts you at 750 I have not played the game that much on stadia's but so I

37:25.080 --> 37:31.560
started off with like um 750 so it was pretty pretty high when I started off so anyway uh how

37:31.560 --> 37:35.400
did I like it how was the experience of playing on google stadia well I wanted you guys that are

37:35.400 --> 37:38.760
on twitch to be able to see some of the visuals so you could kind of see what it looks like and

37:38.760 --> 37:45.160
honestly I think the visuals look fine it looks like you're playing a youtube basically I mean

37:45.720 --> 37:52.840
there is a notice because I actually bought destiny 2 um on battle net way back when when

37:52.840 --> 37:57.800
they first launched on battle net I bought it there and I've been able to play that in 2k mode

37:57.800 --> 38:04.840
on my monitor um and it looks really sharp when I'm playing it in 2k mode um so um I don't think

38:04.840 --> 38:11.480
it quite looks that good uh the colors get just ever so slightly washed like when you probably

38:11.480 --> 38:16.440
watch youtube's of your favorite game um online you probably notice there's a little bit of a

38:16.440 --> 38:20.840
wash over the screen a little bit and that kind of holds true when I'm playing in stadia and again

38:20.840 --> 38:25.000
I'm playing on a web browser I'm not playing on my television because the buddy pass didn't exactly

38:25.000 --> 38:30.440
give me a uh chromecast or anything like that uh and as Bobby points out in chat remember Rob is

38:30.440 --> 38:35.720
playing the 1080p version too and yes that's the other point is that I'm used to playing in 2k but

38:35.720 --> 38:40.280
when you are playing destiny 2 in the browser you're actually only getting it at 1080p wait a

38:40.280 --> 38:46.840
minute I thought stadia did 4k yeah me too but I guess developers have not yet enabled the 4k

38:46.840 --> 38:52.680
streaming or they're not officially supporting 4k streaming at this time um so I'm not actually

38:52.680 --> 38:58.520
playing it in 4k but when it comes to how much bandwidth am I actually using to play this the

38:58.520 --> 39:04.360
answer ends up being and not that much it's not that bad because I'm uh in 1080p and you have to

39:04.360 --> 39:09.800
remember that is further being downsized to the 720p that you guys are seeing in a smaller than

39:09.800 --> 39:15.080
720p window here so it actually probably looks even better uh for you guys um that are watching

39:15.080 --> 39:20.360
it on twitch right now um me being really bad at shooters but very satisfied that I shot that

39:20.360 --> 39:27.240
rocket and blew that guy up so um now prince bright star asks the very important question

39:27.240 --> 39:34.440
how is the lag and I'm gonna say that is where I was most impressed with stadia I didn't notice it

39:34.440 --> 39:40.120
like you'll notice I'm just plunking away playing my first person shooter the only thing I'm getting

39:40.120 --> 39:45.400
frustrated at is how bad my aim is I'm not actually frustrated at oh why am I shooting

39:45.400 --> 39:50.680
that ship I have no idea anyway it has a health bar it can be damaged it has a health bar shoot

39:50.680 --> 39:58.760
it out of the sky anyway um but yeah honestly like the lag pretty good like it's not noticeable

39:58.760 --> 40:05.400
like I was able to successfully you know do what I needed to do while I was playing this um

40:06.280 --> 40:13.080
so there's that uh and yeah I mean even though I kind of tease it for taking two minutes to launch

40:13.080 --> 40:18.120
I realize that it is an online game and you know you have to find a party and so forth

40:18.120 --> 40:22.040
so for the most part a lot of that is understandable I'm not having to wait for

40:22.040 --> 40:26.760
it to install patches or anything like that I was able to just kind of get up and running

40:26.760 --> 40:32.440
so what did I think of google stadia not too shabby honestly like as far as the technology

40:32.440 --> 40:37.720
goes especially if I wanted to just keep playing in 1080p like this here's where I think google

40:37.720 --> 40:44.680
stadia is going to run into a problem the I'm not it's a lot of it's to do with the pricing honestly

40:44.680 --> 40:50.120
like I'm playing this because it's free for me for three months thanks to bobby having paid for

40:50.120 --> 40:54.840
it uh and I'll probably try out those other games that are gonna be free as well but that's only a

40:54.840 --> 41:02.440
handful of games I'm gonna have for 9.99 a month whereas in contrast xbox game pass has a ton of

41:02.440 --> 41:08.360
stuff on it right now yes you have to download that stuff to your computer right now how much

41:08.360 --> 41:13.160
exact how much longer is that going to be a thing as we get closer and closer to xcloud being a

41:13.160 --> 41:21.080
reality so I kind of think google's implemented something you know technology that's pretty nice

41:21.720 --> 41:28.040
um but I think microsoft's about to throw them under the bus in about a year uh that games pass

41:28.040 --> 41:33.160
man that that's gonna really do it next gen I think even this generation but like it's a really

41:34.040 --> 41:42.920
nice offer and I mean I keep looking at xbox ones I'm just like no I'm gonna buy the next one but

41:43.880 --> 41:50.920
I don't know it's it's uh because I know with being in this generation uh mainly playstation

41:50.920 --> 41:55.240
you know I have a huge library of games I got with playstation plus I don't feel so bad

41:55.240 --> 42:01.160
losing out on that being that um I'll get it all back with games pass anyways so anyway that's me

42:01.160 --> 42:05.640
playing uh destiny 2 on stadia so just wanted to I wanted to have a little bit of the visual for

42:05.640 --> 42:08.920
those of you guys on twitch you can see like what does it look like what does it actually look like

42:08.920 --> 42:12.440
when you boot up how does it go into the game so I wanted you guys to be able to see a little bit of

42:12.440 --> 42:17.960
that I have something else to talk about that's a little bit unrelated sure why not just go ahead

42:17.960 --> 42:22.760
and sum up I was um I don't know if there's a lot else to say on it it's again it's one of those

42:22.760 --> 42:27.720
things where I think the technology is not I mean with as much as we're complaining about bandwidth

42:27.720 --> 42:32.840
caps and all that stuff like if I'm still just streaming things at 1080p I don't know if that's

42:32.840 --> 42:37.400
really going to become an issue for me I mean maybe I want to try some things in 4k later maybe

42:37.400 --> 42:42.440
that is going to be an issue later on I'm not trying to deny that that is an issue but 1080p

42:42.440 --> 42:49.240
is good enough just like a lot of 2k gaming for me is good enough right now and I'm enjoying it um

42:49.240 --> 42:54.840
I think I think stadia has more of a struggle on its monetary structure it's kind of the same thing

42:54.840 --> 42:59.960
Jason said last week it's more the the structure and and how they want you to pay for games when

42:59.960 --> 43:03.400
you look at what some of the competition is doing and especially how they're positioning the chess

43:03.400 --> 43:08.040
pieces like we're talking about with xbox that's where I fear for stadia but if stadia can put

43:08.040 --> 43:12.840
together something real quick that can rival game pass in a way it might be more tempting anyway

43:12.840 --> 43:16.600
before I get to my next game Jamie you had a different thought I just wanted to go ahead and

43:16.600 --> 43:24.520
mention that today is also uh world aids day excuse me um and so I just wanted to make sure

43:24.520 --> 43:29.960
that I put the mention out there for everybody just have the awareness of it and keep those

43:29.960 --> 43:35.320
that we've lost in mind so that is an important note thank you for that and I think it's very

43:35.320 --> 43:38.920
important everybody know their status and your sexuality has nothing to do with that everybody's

43:38.920 --> 43:44.440
know their status everybody should know yeah so so um it's very very very easy to get tested

43:44.440 --> 43:50.840
and uh you know in fact it's not the death sentence it once was if you catch it and treat

43:50.840 --> 43:56.680
it there's ways to um you know uh basically suppress you know I mean not that we should

43:56.680 --> 44:01.480
overlook it by any means but you know there's also this uh saying that undetectable is

44:01.480 --> 44:06.520
untransmittable so if you get it treated and you can get down to levels where it's undetectable

44:06.520 --> 44:11.720
in your system you still have a lot of options I will you know kind of leave that out there but

44:11.720 --> 44:16.280
there's many many many ways you can kind of get treatment for that that weren't there when people

44:16.280 --> 44:20.600
were first talking about this in a lot of the media and stuff in the 80s and 90s so definitely

44:20.600 --> 44:25.240
look into your local resources check and see if you've got like an LGBT center in your town

44:25.720 --> 44:31.400
look for you don't even need that I mean yes it is resources sure resources and you see if you've

44:31.400 --> 44:36.360
got sisters in town you know sisters will always help you with resources and education but

44:36.360 --> 44:42.760
definitely just make sure that you take care of yourself and it doesn't matter if you what gender

44:42.760 --> 44:50.200
you identify with what your body is like who you like sleeping with or not at all if you've had

44:50.840 --> 44:57.800
contact with and I'm not just gonna say you know coitus or anything like that but even if you've

44:57.800 --> 45:03.960
had injections recently if you have to say you know if you've had a blood transfusion I know

45:03.960 --> 45:09.480
the doctors are very careful with it but I mean that's how Ryan White got it in the 80s for a lot

45:09.480 --> 45:13.880
of that is tested and different now it's different now there's no excuse you should know your status

45:14.440 --> 45:20.600
exactly so so I'm saying you know I never take it for granted yeah so and one of the quick thing

45:20.600 --> 45:25.480
I'll say it's really easy like when I go to my doctor and my doctor is like I want to do blood

45:25.480 --> 45:29.320
because doctors want to do blood tests all the time right I go in I'm coughing too much let's

45:29.320 --> 45:34.040
do a blood test and I'll usually ask if it's been you know six months since last time I'm gonna ask

45:34.040 --> 45:38.920
I'm gonna say hey since I'm going to lab anyway can you throw in this HIV test as well the worst

45:38.920 --> 45:42.360
I've ever gotten from the doctor response is do you have a reason to be concerned I'm like no I

45:42.360 --> 45:46.280
just want to know my status okay that's that's it they're gonna throw it in they want you they

45:46.280 --> 45:51.000
want you to do that test too so anyway good life lesson from dark soccer mixed in here with the

45:51.000 --> 45:57.880
gaming stuff all right um other games though I will mention uh for my gaming week pokemon shield

45:57.880 --> 46:04.040
so here's here's the update on pokemon shield I beat it that's right I got all eight gym badges

46:04.600 --> 46:10.600
I fought uh the championship and I became the champion and I caught the um legendary uh

46:11.560 --> 46:16.360
that is integrated in the story so I don't know how much I should say into that not the sword and

46:16.360 --> 46:21.400
shield legendary that is the post game so that's the one that's at the beginning of the game yeah

46:21.400 --> 46:27.320
the very very beginning of the game that is the post game legendary um so I have not yeah I have

46:27.320 --> 46:32.040
not done the post game content yet I'm sure I'll get around to it at some point but then I got

46:32.040 --> 46:37.640
derailed with another game that I'll talk about in a moment um but honestly you know I know we

46:37.640 --> 46:40.920
were just kind of talking about pokemon the controversy and everything I really enjoyed

46:40.920 --> 46:46.440
gen 8 I really really enjoyed gen 8 and I think some of the major differences for this I've never

46:46.440 --> 46:50.520
beaten a mainline pokemon game before I've never gotten this far in a mainline pokemon game

46:50.520 --> 46:55.000
shane was shook he might not show it because he's shane but he was shook definitely that I beat the

46:55.000 --> 47:01.080
game um but uh here's some things that made this generation different number one getting to be able

47:01.080 --> 47:05.480
to play it on my television versus being forced to do it on a handheld I think there's just something

47:05.480 --> 47:09.560
about that experience I've always enjoyed gaming on the tv more being able to kind of plop on my

47:09.560 --> 47:15.640
couch have the big screen and the sound bar and everything um that was really cool number two I

47:15.640 --> 47:22.200
think the wild area was a pretty good change because I don't feel this need to grind every

47:22.200 --> 47:28.440
pokemon that I miss on a route because I kind of know like a the pokedex shows you what you're

47:28.440 --> 47:33.240
missing from a certain route so you know you can kind of always go back and get it later um and you

47:33.240 --> 47:37.400
don't feel the need to like oh I gotta go check this online reference I used to do in some of the

47:37.400 --> 47:42.200
older games and most of them are available in the wild area number three which I think is the

47:42.200 --> 47:49.880
biggest one raiding dynamax rating changed it because now I don't have to grind battles over

47:49.880 --> 47:54.680
and over and over again to raise the experience level of my pokemon if I do enough of those

47:54.680 --> 47:59.480
dynamax raids you get candy from those raids and you feed the candy to your pokemon and the candy

47:59.480 --> 48:04.840
levels them up and it's a great alternative to grinding and I think that was a huge part of it

48:04.840 --> 48:10.280
and it's funny because I hear this game get a lot of shit because people go it's not as long as the

48:10.280 --> 48:16.840
prior games well how many of those hours in pokemon blue were you fucking grinding on a certain route

48:16.840 --> 48:20.440
over and over again to either catch this pokemon that only showed up five percent of the time

48:20.440 --> 48:24.440
or to over level your pokemon so that way the next gym fight would not be that big of a deal

48:25.000 --> 48:30.360
like so I kind of think there's that I'll need to consider when you're talking about the length

48:30.360 --> 48:36.920
of the game is how much of the game was actually interesting sorry not sorry anyway that's a good

48:36.920 --> 48:42.680
thing for pokemon gen 8 in my opinion and yeah I mean those are some of the big things I'm trying

48:42.680 --> 48:46.120
to think what else I said when I wrote this post on twitter because somebody like directly asked

48:46.120 --> 48:50.840
me the question why did this gen stick when the other gens didn't but those are some of the

48:50.840 --> 48:55.720
biggest ones right there that you know just made this a lot of fun the end game did kind

48:55.720 --> 48:59.880
of keep going and going like I thought I was ready to beat it and it's like no you have to go here

48:59.880 --> 49:03.880
and there but I don't think that's a bad thing at all I mean you know because this game's gotten

49:03.880 --> 49:12.920
crap for its story too I suppose I will say I saw a critique about how the game felt like you

49:12.920 --> 49:18.920
weren't an active participant in the story that the story was kind of happening around you for

49:18.920 --> 49:25.080
the most part and I will say I do see truth in that critique and I can see where that bothers

49:25.080 --> 49:29.560
some people I don't think that's to say you don't actively participate at all no certainly there's

49:29.560 --> 49:34.360
very important things that your character does in the game but I can get the sense that there's a

49:34.360 --> 49:40.520
lot that happens that you don't see or you're not involved with that feels a little weird so I do

49:40.520 --> 49:45.080
think that's a valid critique there but it didn't really bother me to the level that it's may bother

49:45.080 --> 49:53.640
some other people in that so anyway Bobby in chat says not as long as a positive for me I'm

49:53.640 --> 49:58.520
debating on getting it especially because it's not as long as it only has a subset of all Pokemans

49:59.480 --> 50:03.560
it's it's a good one to start with I think there's a good reason why they put it on the switch

50:03.560 --> 50:10.120
I think all the Pokemon will come back when they do probably a remake they'll probably do a remake

50:10.120 --> 50:17.800
of gen four I don't where did they leave off I can't remember Pokemon Uber and Pokemon ultimate

50:17.800 --> 50:22.760
there there is a part of me that wonders if they won't just do since everybody's whining if they

50:22.760 --> 50:28.760
won't just do like a Pokemon ultimate that has every Pokemon today in it that's just a side

50:28.760 --> 50:33.800
Pokemon world traveler yeah maybe something that takes you through all the regions but like an

50:33.800 --> 50:39.240
abbreviated they should have a collection collect them all no like a collection like a few games in

50:39.240 --> 50:44.760
one you know like a few generations and then just one continuous Pokedex that you can use between

50:44.760 --> 50:48.840
them those are all great ideas so but I hope they'll never do any of them I hope there are

50:48.840 --> 50:53.800
conveniences from this generation and quality of life improvements that they do look at implementing

50:53.800 --> 50:59.400
um in any remake or future generation so uh Elliot B says I don't think I've gotten past the third

50:59.400 --> 51:05.640
gym on any Pokemon games in Sapphire same uh I just get bored around the 10 hour mark same

51:05.640 --> 51:11.240
but this time when I got bored I just went and did dynamax ratings uh and uh can you start off

51:11.240 --> 51:17.160
with those because I've got those little pink areas to look yeah if you can see the pink areas

51:17.160 --> 51:22.040
I would say once you get your Y-com which is before the first gym you can raid um you don't

51:22.040 --> 51:26.360
want to necessarily jump in all the five stars but you can you can raid well the last thing that I

51:26.360 --> 51:34.760
did was the um uh the the mines on the way to the first gym so I might do it after the first gym

51:34.760 --> 51:40.120
yeah so after the first gym is a good time and honestly if you get the first gym the second gym

51:40.120 --> 51:45.320
is just a hop skip and a jump over the first three gyms are all pretty easy to knock out

51:45.320 --> 51:51.400
and then you kind of have a wait before you get to the fourth gym but anyway um so that is uh

51:51.400 --> 51:56.600
that is my thought on Pokemon Gen 8 I think it's great um I think a lot of people who are talking

51:56.600 --> 52:01.800
bad about it probably haven't played it yet that's not to say none of the criticisms are valid and

52:01.800 --> 52:07.560
it's not a perfect game but it's pretty darn good and it made a great impression on me needs better

52:07.560 --> 52:12.440
fashion sense I mean white shorts with white leggings no girl you do get to redress him

52:12.440 --> 52:18.280
that's one of the first things terrible yeah I so is that your gaming week uh one more one more

52:18.280 --> 52:25.480
okay so one more game I said it was a busy week sorry guys so one more game so um I went out

52:25.480 --> 52:30.760
on Thanksgiving and yeah I was one of those people who went to Target on Thanksgiving but I did as

52:30.760 --> 52:37.000
well I was really nice I didn't spend any money yeah so I I went and um you know what the reality

52:37.000 --> 52:41.640
is like Alan and I were going stir crazy we were bored like we have nothing to do on this holiday

52:41.640 --> 52:45.800
what do we like is anything open so we're like let's just let's just go to you need to play

52:45.800 --> 52:54.280
ingress listen no no god I'm like over that anyway so like I was like let's drive to target if the

52:54.280 --> 52:59.720
parking lot is a shit show then we'll just drive somewhere else we'll go on a drive uh but the

52:59.720 --> 53:03.320
parking lot at Target wasn't that bad it was just like a really bad Saturday morning pretty much and

53:03.320 --> 53:08.760
we went in and um there was a ton of people staffing and they had a system and it was fine

53:08.760 --> 53:12.760
and I just was very polite I was asked to go stand to one line versus another and I'm just okay I

53:12.760 --> 53:17.240
talked to the guy about video games so I just you know tried to you know if I'm going to be a monster

53:17.240 --> 53:22.200
and shot the Thanksgiving then at least I can be a nice one um so anyway I got a copy of Death

53:22.200 --> 53:26.840
Stranding that's the that's the point and so I've been playing Death Stranding I'm probably about

53:26.840 --> 53:33.960
six hours into Death Stranding um or as I called it what did I say in that text message I sent to

53:33.960 --> 53:41.480
um Shane I said Death Cake Stranding yes or in the opening of the show tonight let's see I said

53:41.480 --> 53:48.120
Reedus's baby fetus no there's all of that too this might be the strangest game ever I'm carrying

53:48.120 --> 53:53.560
a dead body on my back across these scenic landscapes constantly having to use l2 and r2

53:53.560 --> 54:00.120
to shift weight while hipster music plays in the background yep girl learn to crouch and uh dark

54:00.120 --> 54:06.600
Tetsuya says I still like Dark Souls of walking here's the that description is completely accurate

54:06.600 --> 54:11.720
it really is the Dark Souls what do you do in the game you walk how do you know where to walk you

54:11.720 --> 54:17.720
press r1 and it shows you where the dangerous terrain versus the non-dangerous terrain is

54:17.720 --> 54:21.960
so you can kind of plot plot out carefully where am I going to walk and you do you have to adjust

54:21.960 --> 54:26.520
your weight you have to l2 and r2 to kind of like grip the ground and one of the places where

54:26.520 --> 54:30.600
I was really struggling was that there's these kind of like again I don't want to spoil story

54:30.600 --> 54:34.200
too much but there's like these ghosty things that'll chase you and come after you and they're

54:34.200 --> 54:38.520
trying to like basically kill you although well I don't want to spoil but they're basically trying

54:38.520 --> 54:44.520
to kill you so um like I was getting really frustrated because the thing would go off the

54:44.520 --> 54:49.560
baby would cry and it would say press r1 to hold your breath and so like okay I'm holding my breath

54:49.560 --> 54:53.320
well the fuckers would still get me like every time and so I actually went to twitter and I

54:53.320 --> 54:57.640
made a tweet I'm like what the hell am I doing wrong and somebody replied and said are you

54:57.640 --> 55:03.480
crouching and I'm like oh oh yeah that's a thing it taught you in like the first 20 seconds of the

55:03.480 --> 55:10.040
game isn't it but it never to my to my credit the game reminds you to hold your breath it never

55:10.040 --> 55:17.160
reminds you again to crouch so I remembered then thanks to twitter to crouch and I was like okay

55:17.240 --> 55:22.120
this is a lot easier but the thing about crouching is then you move even slower

55:22.120 --> 55:29.320
so it's like you are slowly going through these landscapes and don't leave corpses behind

55:29.320 --> 55:34.360
oh well no and that has explained you very much in the story in the beginning well yeah but people

55:34.360 --> 55:39.400
still do that shit but you know how like the very first mission in the game is moving a corpse

55:39.400 --> 55:46.120
that's where I was at so um but anyway wait till you get to carry live people oh god

55:47.240 --> 55:50.280
why do I have to carry live people they have legs they can walk on their own

55:51.480 --> 55:58.760
no you gotta carry them just like the dead yeah so anyway um but I don't know it's it's weird like

55:58.760 --> 56:04.440
the story is very interesting it's very cinematic it's very well done I didn't realize that Lindsay

56:04.440 --> 56:09.400
Wagner played that part that she played and then it was like oh this by the way Lindsay Wagner

56:09.400 --> 56:17.080
and she voiced the oh the the the I know you can't yes the the other character will just say

56:17.080 --> 56:20.440
like that I know there's so many like spoilery things I could say but I'm trying to be good

56:20.440 --> 56:27.400
she voiced 1.0 and not 2.0 yes yes that is and she but she provided the likeness for 2.0 yes

56:27.400 --> 56:35.400
okay so um anyway so um where was I oh Lindsay Wagner was on this television show in the 70s

56:35.400 --> 56:38.920
called the bionic woman and the main character in the bionic woman was Jamie Summers

56:39.480 --> 56:43.560
it said spelled differently spelled differently that's where I took my stage name from yeah

56:44.120 --> 56:50.040
uh quest buster says most weapons are non-lethal for a very good reason yeah I noticed that when

56:50.040 --> 56:55.480
I would tackle people you weren't killing them and that does make sense because the story explains

56:55.480 --> 57:00.440
why dead bodies you won't leave them around um so you had to basically tie people up and that

57:00.440 --> 57:04.440
was it you incapacitate people just leave them on the ground squirming because you have to do that

57:04.440 --> 57:09.560
one of the early missions which would suck if an actual BT did come by for them yeah um but then

57:09.560 --> 57:15.960
questmaster says most weapons are non-lethal okay but the weapons there are are pee pee poo poo

57:15.960 --> 57:22.840
that's the weapons in the game are pee pee poo poo like and I was like this game is infatuated

57:22.840 --> 57:28.360
with pee pee poo poo because there's this whole there's this whole thing like when you're like

57:28.360 --> 57:33.240
you are sitting in your little dorm room or whatever spoiler to say that the main character

57:33.240 --> 57:40.760
special yes the main character is special and uh has special pee pee poo poo and it can actually

57:40.760 --> 57:47.240
and his blood you're making a face but it's true no no I'm I know but the it was actually to me

57:47.240 --> 57:53.160
that was an interesting concept you know then they they rationalize it completely in their

57:53.160 --> 57:59.720
own weird way why pee pee poo poo is effective yes you learn more though about him as a character

58:00.520 --> 58:10.920
than the reason why his bodily fluids and excrement are powerful you see this is why this

58:10.920 --> 58:16.680
is why they warn you that drinking too many monster energy drinks is a bad thing it does

58:16.680 --> 58:24.280
eventually kill the undead so I mean game of the year contender death stranding is infatuated with

58:24.680 --> 58:31.720
pee pee poo poo and it actually it tries to it rationalizes everything it rations this is why

58:31.720 --> 58:37.960
I am obsessed with pee pee poo poo here's the whole my thing like if they're collecting blood

58:37.960 --> 58:46.280
from him every time he stops to rest how much of his blood do they have like there are so many

58:46.280 --> 58:52.520
depending on how often you rest in the game or how many days passed it's just although the there's

58:52.520 --> 58:59.560
one have you had the dream sequence yet with uh with uh BB yeah a couple I don't know I don't

58:59.560 --> 59:05.960
know if there's a particular one crashing through no the head butting no okay okay first of all I

59:05.960 --> 59:13.240
absolutely love the bridge baby I don't I don't like BB I don't like the usage of a baby in that

59:13.240 --> 59:17.320
and especially when they start explaining how like that was just really the still mother

59:17.960 --> 59:22.520
yeah that's just that was a bit much for me I think it's the side of me that doesn't care

59:22.520 --> 59:28.360
for horror films I was like do they do they really have to do this but I like bridge baby as you get

59:28.360 --> 59:35.720
to know the bitch bridge the bitch baby did you really as long as you learn more about the bridge

59:35.720 --> 59:41.560
baby as you go along so I really like the bridge baby as a character as a conduit to all these

59:41.560 --> 59:47.000
other things that went on in the game yeah and I'm gonna leave that again like that again they

59:47.240 --> 59:53.160
explain why a baby like they explain it all why pee pee poo poo they explain it everything is

59:53.160 --> 59:58.280
logically baby pee pee poo poo no there's no baby pee pee poo poo it's pee pee poo poo and baby

59:58.280 --> 01:00:04.920
because baby because bridge baby is still living in in bridge baby sack but anyway anyway did you

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:12.200
meet mama yet no because that's what I'm planning on is one of my cosplays next year okay is mama

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:20.200
well I've seen mom but mama oh oh yes I've met mama yes yeah oh you meet her in like the first

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:23.720
opening sequence of the game right but that's like I'm good I'm planning on cosplaying mama

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:29.400
and I'm trying to figure out how to do her um accessory interesting so anyway yeah and then

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:33.320
the one more I swear only one more thing I have to say about pee pee poo poo but since it's so

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:38.840
central to this game when you are in the dorm room and you press the button to make Norman Reedus

01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:45.480
poop which I think is the x button which yes is a thing you can do push button push x to poop

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:49.400
and you push it and he gets in he gets at the end it doesn't it's not showing you anything nasty

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:53.960
it's one of those like screens it's it's not the south park you know game where there's like a

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:59.400
little mini game the at the poop no it's there's this screen that comes up with the frosted glass

01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:05.320
so you can't see anything advertising some show there's a fucking advertisement for a real show

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:12.920
in it's Norman Reedus's actual show on AMC and I was like what Rob what what on earth is this

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:18.520
when he's sitting downstairs his crotch repeatedly I've you know I tried did you get punched I did

01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:23.960
not get punched but he did the thing he's done a few weird things the thing that weirded me out

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:28.920
was after the press x to poop and then he got the frosted glass when he gets out he sits back down

01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:36.520
he looks over at me and winks and I'm like why are you that are you Norman Reedus are you hitting

01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:41.960
on me that's not the time to be hitting on me number one this is the crazy thing I never

01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:49.800
thought he was attractive until this game seriously but no it's not until you see a man defecate

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:54.760
you truly no attraction pixel paka says I just pooped winked yeah that's kind of what it is

01:01:54.760 --> 01:02:00.840
I pooped it's like in the silent earth for mst 3k did you make faces in the in the mirror

01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:05.800
yes and do the selfies and stuff yes I did find that okay but just stare at his crotch

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:12.120
like he does different things if you stare at his crotch a lot yeah yeah I heard so anyway um so I

01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:17.000
don't know so so then the the 50 million dollar question in chat swung tong asks should I say the

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:27.720
$60 question in chat uh is it worth $60 I don't know yet I I still have more to traverse in this

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:33.880
game before I truly know if it's worth 60 bucks I will say this for a I I think it is an excellent

01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:39.240
fucking troll on behalf of Hideo Kojima I don't know if this was planned or not but there's all

01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:44.440
these people on twitter that love to bash walking simulators right it's like walking simulators

01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:49.880
aren't games they're just they're just this there's a story that plays out while you walk

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:55.160
and I feel like Hideo Kojima was like hmm walking simulator I'm gonna make the ultimate walking

01:02:55.160 --> 01:03:01.080
simulator and that's what he's done he's made the ultimate walking simulator game and yet nobody's

01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:08.120
complaining about it I will say this though I do think the way it incorporates the online is pretty

01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:12.920
fucking clever like uh I don't know if you guys know this but you can actually kind of edit the

01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:18.040
terrain so like not like dig holes and stuff but like let's say there's a particularly nasty part

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:23.000
of the river to cross you can build a ladder or even a bridge to help you cross the river

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:29.400
and other players will see that in their games and they can send likes which help you in your game

01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:35.480
so that was kind of fascinating and lends itself to this very like in your face theme to the other

01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:42.360
big question what the fuck is Death Stranding about the fact that we have a need to be connected

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:48.760
that is what Death Stranding is about and at least early in the game where my head is that from what

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:53.480
we have a need to be connected but if you're also looking at it from the perspectives of the people

01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:59.000
that you need it could also be involved with the dangers of being too connected that's true it's

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:05.160
very End of Eva for me yeah have you seen End of Evangelion no of course not well shit yeah the

01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:13.240
whole game just strikes me as I think that Kojima like got really drunk one night and watched End of

01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:18.760
Evangelion on repeat and then decided to make a walking simulator out of End of Evangelion without

01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:27.160
giant robots appropriate so much in common with the Evangelion mythos but I did think you know I

01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:34.280
will say this from for for all the pee-pee poo-poo jokes for all the weird baby things that happen in

01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:39.720
the game for all the Guillermo del Toro appearances except it's not really Guillermo del Toro doing

01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:44.520
the voice somebody else no it's not him it's credited in the very beginning it's um yeah

01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:48.520
it's the it's the voice of LeFou from the original Beauty and the Beast oh okay yeah I thought that

01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:55.480
they said that it's his likeness but it's not his voice all right well at any rate um I like his

01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:59.400
character oh yeah he has a he's a great character when he showed up so early I was like oh I thought

01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:05.240
this guy just had a cameo but no he's he's plays a pretty big role in it yeah I like I really this

01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:11.800
is one of the few games like this that I've truly liked all the characters except for like one of

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:20.760
the bad guys yeah but um because he was just nuts anyway but I even liked one of the other

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:29.640
reoccurring quote bad guys and I like I even like the big quote bad as well I do not like 1.0

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:36.200
version but I like 2.0 version I like the um the mule was that their name the guys with the gold

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:41.000
skull masks and the I think that's a really rad look and I think who also has a really rad look

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:47.640
is that guy who has like a black plastic mask on over his face oh die hard man yeah die hard man

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:54.920
I think he's got a really rad look he I'm still kind of of two minds about that character

01:05:55.800 --> 01:06:01.480
but his actor did like one of my tweets that was cool oh that's cool um I love the look like yeah

01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:04.920
I would say there's a lot to cosplay in this there really is he's actually a handsome fellow

01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:11.880
by himself anyway I want Loki to cosplay um Sam Bridges Porter uh carrying 200 kilograms of cargo

01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:21.640
because it's ridiculous but kind of awesome all right but no one of my favorite characters in

01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:27.160
the game could be considered uh an antagonist hmm right we'll leave it at that there's more like

01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:31.800
six hours in and I feel like there's still so much more to uncover but I will say the whole like we

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:36.040
are connected and the way so my point I was getting at for all the peepee poo for all the

01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:41.080
baby stuff the the fact that the theme of the game is around connection and the need to be connected

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:46.600
to people and so forth or maybe not the fact that then he built this online component that

01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:56.120
allows you to be connected in the process of playing this game I was like aha that is art

01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:00.760
and that was my review of Death Stranding

01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:09.320
what'd you think Loki are you gonna buy the game no I don't know I like I yeah I don't

01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:14.200
know I think some people will love it and some people will hate it um that's and isn't that the

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:20.040
isn't that the great part about video games I don't know anyway but I I I would still though

01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:24.600
I think that even though that's one of my favorite characters I'm actually gonna go and say that

01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:32.040
both Mama and Lochna are probably my favorite I could see you cosplaying Mama yeah they're my

01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:36.360
they're really my favorite characters in the whole thing yeah I like the concept between them

01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:42.040
all right well let's move on uh let's talk about so we've only been here talking about our gaming

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:45.960
weeks for like an hour sorry that was mostly my bad but I like I said I played a lot this week

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:51.160
what can I say so we do have some video game news we want to get into um quickly some housekeeping

01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:57.560
uh we should be here every week through uh December because um the holidays this time are

01:07:57.560 --> 01:08:01.720
on weird days so they shouldn't interfere with our show the next show we will be gone will be

01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:07.000
Martin Luther King weekend January 19th I believe it is so here's the thing and you guys actually

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.920
don't know this you're finding this out for the first time uh Allen bought us an anniversary gift

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:15.720
today so we're going because January 19th actually happens to be our anniversary so we are going to

01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:21.880
see um Dear Evan Hansen that night here um because um I was kind of complaining about wanting to see

01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:25.880
it on Broadway I was like oh I want to see that so he made it happen so we're gonna go see that

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:30.440
that's Disneyland week for me well oh that's right you weren't gonna be here anyway right

01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:34.280
well no I would have been because we don't leave until that Monday but all right well

01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:38.200
but it's gonna be Disneyland week for packing for Disneyland week so all right yes exactly

01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:42.920
all right what do you wanna say something before we get into this I'm not doing anything special

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:48.840
but do a stream well I might well if my computer would stop shutting down every five seconds

01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:52.760
remember I'm still trying to get my computer or not being a shithole oh yeah there is that

01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:56.840
because I've been needing to work on a website and do logo work every time I open my fucking

01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:03.240
photoshop to do to piece more on our logo my computer shuts down so I think I'd need to

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:09.320
actually replace all the ram in my system and maybe update my bios I don't know but it's it's a

01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:15.080
pain in the ass um but I did have just a small little thing that good that happened to me that

01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:19.800
I just found out about yeah I told you when I got in okay so that podcast that I really like called

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:23.880
uh stuff mom never told you you know one of my letters got right out and we got some shout outs

01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:30.120
for the show I got another shout out on that podcast for Muppet Babies when are you guessing

01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:36.600
I don't know if I'd go to Atlanta and volunteer just because I think that uh you need to go to

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:41.000
Atlanta for Dragon Con and then do they go to Dragon Con maybe I've met them yeah Annie goes

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.520
to Dragon Con I've probably met them and I didn't even know who they were I don't think Samantha

01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:48.680
Samantha doesn't cosplay but um because I think this Dragon Con was her first one from listening

01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:53.960
to the show okay but um Annie does cosplay she does a Winter Soldier cosplay Bobby do I know

01:09:53.960 --> 01:10:01.640
these people but in any Bobby does Atlanta better than I do but at any rate um I I've I would

01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:07.080
actually I mean I don't know if they're listening they said they'd check us out but if I would love

01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:11.720
to guest on their show and just talk about video games and women in podcasting they the one I'm

01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:15.880
listening to right now is their episode on fan girls but they've done some great ones about

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:21.160
toxic fandom gatekeeping all kinds of things I totally would say check out the one the fandom

01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:25.720
specific podcast of theirs uh Bobby says I have to see him I'm terrible with names Bobby's like me

01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:29.160
like I'm so visual like you could tell me about a person I'm like I what do they look like what's

01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:34.600
her face like and then I'd be like oh sure I've met this person um anyway uh it's horrible for

01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:40.760
a podcaster I know uh I just tagged the both of them in one of my last tweets so sweet um one

01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:44.600
thing I want to ask real quick what was the Muppet Babies thing before we get into okay so they were

01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:49.960
they did an episode about puppetry and women in puppetry and so um Samantha was talking about

01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:54.360
Muppet Babies and they got on a little tangent about Muppet Babies and you know are they like

01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:58.840
there's the reboot of them and I happen to be at Target literally after listening to this podcast

01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:04.680
and I saw Muppet Babies toys so I just snapped it and put it on Twitter said hey Samantha look

01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:09.960
what I found and so she replied back like yeah I remember when Muppet Babies were first in the

01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:14.680
Muppets Take Manhattan because not everyone knows that that's the origin of Muppet Babies

01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:21.960
and so she mentioned it on the podcast I was like hey my my trivial knowledge is not as

01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:26.920
trivial you can be hosting your own damn thing for 800 episodes and it's still fun to get mentioned

01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:32.440
on a podcast that you like and respect you know yeah it's still fun I still remember when you were

01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:38.360
on Greg Proops' podcast yeah a few years ago and he went off on my question yeah you were in a good

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:42.600
way in a good way yeah um this was and he's still doing that show right yeah I haven't

01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:48.440
listened a while we went to the punch line here and I was absolutely just and he actually signed

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:53.080
the back of his show notes for me and gave it to me and it's framed somewhere in my house he just

01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:57.480
told me to keep being awesome I was like that's pretty cool because I asked him if we were heading

01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:03.800
for a repeat of the French Revolution or the Bolshevik Revolution because of the way our

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:08.760
economy and society is moving and that he just went off on that one and it was beautiful.

01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:15.880
Swongtong in chat says I'm pretty sure I met Rob but was too scared to say hi years ago at PAX lol

01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:21.640
I'm bummed to hear that I wish you had said hi but let me let me tell you like a secret so if

01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:28.600
I seem like I'm really like in a zone or like off-putish or something like that when you see

01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:34.280
me in person or whatever I seem like I'm I'm in doing something else or whatever like trust I am

01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:41.080
just as nervous as you are like that's some tea so just you know especially at PAX it had to have

01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:44.600
been packed I can't believe I wouldn't believe this was PAX08 in Seattle because we were all

01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:49.480
there so it would have been one of the PAX East that they're referring to and so those shows to

01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:55.160
me were like I was in a town I'm not that familiar with I was at a show that I didn't really have an

01:12:55.160 --> 01:13:01.400
agenda for because especially the most recent packs they like well what the fuck ever obviously

01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:06.120
say it I think Bobby said it on his show too they fucking invited us to do a panel then said never

01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:09.880
mind we don't want you to do the panel because we got bigger names to do the panel essentially

01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:13.800
that's the message that I was heard so I was kind of like in that one of those moods where I was

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:17.880
like I don't even know what I'm doing at this con except oh I'm having a good time being here with

01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:21.960
Bobby and running into some of the people I do know back here but I had like no agenda or things

01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:26.680
to do there so I was just probably like kind of like off of my own little zone or whatever so um

01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:35.000
yeah please say hi I promise I don't bite unless um consent is given uh sg100 matt says rob's a

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:41.480
pretty cool and fun guy in person thank you for that I appreciate that so all right anyway uh

01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:45.400
Bobby says they invited us to be on a panel then they took the panel off the schedule then we

01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:50.280
applied as media and they declined us so we had to bypass this from a listener true true and true

01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:54.680
and the only thing that I added is that that they took the panel off the schedule to replace

01:13:54.680 --> 01:14:01.160
it with one with bigger people that's what it was anyway anyhow let's move on we have other

01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:08.520
gaming news to talk about Loki's gonna start us off yes and so we've got apparently dev p

01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:15.400
a playstation 5 death kits spotted in the wild so there is a photo that leaked out to the internet

01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:19.000
of apparently two of the playstation 5 dev kits and we know these are

01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:26.120
allegedly playstation 5 dev kits based on the filing that we saw with um you know a story on

01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:31.560
that a few weeks ago yeah the patent office and it looked fucking weird they are like this weird

01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:37.640
v-shaped system uh with all these vent holes and stuff on it and yep that's what it looks like

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:44.760
some weird v-shaped system with a bunch of vent holes in it so I don't know I mean that doesn't

01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:48.920
necessarily mean that that's what the final system is gonna look like but at least we have

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:55.240
an idea of here's what the dev kit looks like and that they're out there um I hope the final system

01:14:55.240 --> 01:15:00.760
doesn't look like that but it's an odd shape I don't really understand the the purpose behind

01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:06.120
all the vent holes and the way it looks it's I don't know it almost looks like something you

01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:10.520
would see like you know someone trying to kick start their own like game console or something

01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:14.360
like the phantom system or something like that I'm trying not to read too much into it because

01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:20.360
it is a dev kit and I highly doubt this with the actual no it's not sleek looking at all so um a

01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:24.920
logical uh conclusion in our chat from prince bright star who says it'll help with airflow

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:29.000
if people try to stack things on top of it that could be like if you had these units kind of

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:32.520
stacked on top of each other if you're trying to test something like multiplayer but I mean

01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:36.920
I I can't imagine that this is the final thing since I mean that thing is thick remember when

01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:43.800
we were looking at the original xbox one and it was everyone kept comparing it to like a vcr I

01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:50.600
mean this thing is huge it's super thick so I don't know I think it's just one of those this

01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:56.440
is funky because it's not like a vcr looking thing or it's not a big box it's a very distinct

01:15:56.440 --> 01:16:02.760
kind of shape u shape where the airflow is all around in that u um and it's it's just it's a

01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:06.520
little weird and I think that image is jarring and kind of like what you said what makes this

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:11.960
newsworthy is that here we go we have a reddit post that basically confirms those you know what

01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:16.680
we saw on the patent site some time ago so this appears to be the real deal now granted

01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:22.760
we know fake news is out there we know it would be easy to fake these things because I'm almost

01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:27.800
positive we've had fake system pictures before right and people fake them so you should take

01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:33.480
this with a grain of salt as you should everything but on the other hand this is a dev kit and nobody

01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:37.880
should be putting that much stock in what this thing looks like anyway yeah the playstation to

01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:43.800
fake this is like you're playing yourself the playstation 4 dev kit anyways didn't look anything

01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:49.640
like the playstation 4 when it finally launched anyways so it doesn't necessarily mean it's gonna

01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:55.240
look like this it would be weird though if it is so I don't know yeah I guess we'll find out later

01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:59.560
on yeah we will um and it'll be interesting too the repercussions how did an image like this even

01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:03.160
get out like you know we had all those talks with ndas and I don't know if you read through the

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:07.480
comments but which I know you're not supposed to do but oops I did it I was doing some investigative

01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:11.880
journalism and I went through the comments and some of the popular theories is that it was

01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:17.480
possibly a cleaning crew that took the picture even though cleaning crews would still have to

01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:24.120
sign ndas of their own you know I was kind of thinking well right now it's the holidays and

01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:30.600
a lot of the usual people probably are not there so you probably have like other people in and they

01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:35.560
may have signed ndas but maybe they're not as used to seeing this type of stuff or working with this

01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:43.080
so I don't know my my tinfoil hat is that you had some type of holiday crew in there that was

01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:47.960
not as familiar with the ins and outs so when they saw it they did something that they should

01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:52.600
probably know they're not supposed to do but they haven't been tested with that before and so that's

01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:57.160
where we're at because yeah um somebody else pointed out you can if you were to do some

01:17:57.160 --> 01:18:00.360
photoshop fucking around you'd be able to see the reflection of the person in that tv

01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:05.160
that's in maybe as well these have a pretty good idea what they look like

01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:13.080
I mean you can sort of see a shadow of a person but like I don't know if there's enough light to

01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:18.120
actually yeah do anything with that yeah uh dark to see who says you know like the lead up to the

01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:22.760
switch reveal oh yeah there were so many fakes then well remember when the nintendo revolution

01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:26.840
was going to project holograms on your wall like that was the legit story which I remember that

01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:30.680
was the story we talked about on this show I still think that was actually kind of a rad

01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:36.280
concept or the the one that nintendo on that was like supposed to go on your head or something

01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:41.320
that is like vr um and then there was the xbox light room but I think that really was that no

01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:45.720
that is a thing the light room is they never did it they never pushed no that that was actually

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:51.080
through microsoft that that that wasn't like a rumor thing that was a luma room was remembered

01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:57.960
they were showing a luma room light room yeah that's that's an adobe product yeah well what

01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:02.920
better to talk about more rumors might as well hey you know what y'all it was a slower week because

01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:08.600
the holidays so rumors and this show isn't just about reporting game news it's about talk about

01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:13.400
talking about news and sometimes these big rumors are the things that people are talking about

01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:19.080
especially when you consider the source of this rumor the source of this rumor is on twitter

01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:24.760
leaky pandy um because this particular leaker has been right about other nintendo directs in

01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:29.720
the past so this is a leaker with a with a with a resume basically so the tweet says

01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:36.680
excuse me guys sorry for all the coughing noises and stuff but things happen um leaky

01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:43.000
pandy says nintendo is planning two new metroid titles that will release in the next two fiscal

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:49.800
years respectively one is a re-release of metroid prime trilogy hd the second one is a

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:57.640
super metroid remake that mimics samus returns in style and scope well because i love me some super

01:19:57.640 --> 01:20:03.560
metroid that second part i mean the first part kind of strikes me as a of course that has to

01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:09.560
happen at some point it would be weird for them to come out and announce metroid prime 4 when we

01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:15.400
haven't had a metroid prime game to reference in quite some time and granted we haven't even had a

01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:23.080
metroid game to reference save for that 3ds relaunch remake or whatever in quite some time

01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:28.360
so i i kind of feel like nintendo kind of has to do something to like remind us about metroid or

01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:32.680
or put metroid back out there and make it current again so i feel like something especially like a

01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:38.920
metroid prime hd or whatever remake collection it's it's got to be a legit you know they're

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:43.320
gonna want to have something that kind of leads right into four so that makes a lot of sense

01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:47.160
the part about super metroid that's the part where i go okay now that's a little different

01:20:47.160 --> 01:20:53.160
though that part i wasn't expecting yeah and although i i'm not i'm like you can't touch

01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:59.320
greatness at the same time greatness is already available to play on the switch it's in the super

01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:04.040
nintendo library you can go in and play super metroid assuming you have nintendo switch online

01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:10.520
which i imagine many of you do um so it would be weird of them to just like re-release super

01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:15.720
metroid if they don't make some pretty significant changes to it so i think a super metroid with

01:21:15.720 --> 01:21:21.800
changes in the style of you know samus returns on the 3ds i i think is going to be different

01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:26.440
enough where i don't think i will necessarily have to have this live in the shadow of the original

01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:31.720
i'll be curious what they do with it if it's true you know and there is that big if that goes with

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:38.920
it what do you guys think it'd be cool to see them do like kind of what they did with was a

01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:43.800
zero mission or you know something like that where they had kind of the extended super metroid thing

01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:47.880
oh yeah like with the the more extended end and really the map was a little different too they

01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:52.680
made some very subtle changes that kind of changed everything yeah um prince bright star in chat says

01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:56.440
i have to wonder if that second release might support randomization which has become pretty

01:21:56.440 --> 01:22:00.360
popular in the metroid and zelda communities you know i brought this up last week or the week

01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:04.840
before about metroid maker how i was kind of getting into those made one of those ones like

01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:09.960
randomizer type of things um i i would think it would be a beautiful thing for nintendo to

01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:16.680
embrace that to an extent um you know i don't know why nintendo won't be willing to put their name on

01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:20.760
it i mean i guess they feel it has to be of a certain quality and sometimes you can get certain

01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:25.800
seeds that aren't great quality but i i kind of think nintendo really ought to try chancing it

01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:31.480
especially with their classic nes library of just i mean sniping a zelda randomizer essentially

01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:34.920
i mean it's for their game anyway and making it their own where you can generate seeds play

01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:39.080
against other people online do your own speed runs like i i'm not sure why nintendo doesn't

01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:44.280
try to embrace this a little more i mean maybe they just are okay with it happening organically

01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:49.400
because you'll notice as far as i know they haven't ceased and desisted any of the randomizers right

01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:54.920
which is kind of surprising they've just i mean the randomizers don't you have to have your own

01:22:54.920 --> 01:23:00.840
rom so like the randomizers are in an interesting legal area in that regard they're not exactly as

01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:05.560
touchable um but i'm still surprised nintendo's like not never tried to go after them so there

01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:12.840
must be some benefit they're seeing to it i don't know so anyway uh it would be very curious to see

01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:18.840
if this uh all ends up being true about uh the metroid and you know if they really did reboot

01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:23.720
metroid prime 4 earlier this year then we've still got a couple years to go before that game

01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:29.480
is out so i think if this buys us more time and creates more of an awareness or whatever you want

01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:36.920
to say on hold another hardware by the time that game comes out um maybe i mean because it depends

01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:41.160
if you want to believe there's going to be a switch pro or a switch plus oh isn't that supposed to

01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:48.040
happen next year allegedly allegedly so we'll see we got switch light so we've already had the switch

01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:52.120
minus although some people would say they love the switch light because they do mostly handheld

01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:56.680
gaming and it is a nice looking thing especially if you have like some of the artistic clam shells

01:23:56.680 --> 01:24:01.320
and stuff is a pretty nice looking device so um some people would say the switch light is not

01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:06.520
necessarily a downgrade although um you know from the pure technical perspective of the fact that it

01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:12.200
doesn't dock it is but that's okay they're charging you less for it so all right well moving on we do

01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:18.520
have some more news for you guys dark sakura well now i will go ahead and before i even go into this

01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:24.040
i will preface it saying that metacritic can be a little bit questionable um you know it's been

01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:30.520
used to to hurt games it's been used to hurt people uh who are fans of games so with that

01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:41.480
being said um metacritic published uh the 15 highest rated games of 2019 uh with exclusion

01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:50.360
of certain ports um as so to go from the list the top two number one is resident evil 2 with

01:24:50.360 --> 01:24:58.840
a score of 93 second is uh second uh shadows die twice followed by final fantasy 14 shadow bringers

01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:05.400
rob i think you'd be happy with that um monster hunter world and disco Elysium which i'll be

01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:11.560
honest i've never fucking heard of have you heard of disco Elysium yeah i haven't i'd have

01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:16.120
to see a screenshot again the visual thing right that is really cool about shadow bringers though

01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:23.160
um yeah number three yeah um after that is f1 2019 then devil may cry 5 fire emblem three houses

01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:30.200
slay the spire apex legend as regards wrath super mario maker 2 with a score of 88 baba is you

01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:36.680
the legend of zelda links awakening and astral chain so but the top three then being resident

01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:43.640
evil 2 sekiro and uh final fantasy 14 just with final fantasy 14 is just seeing how much that

01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:51.320
game came back from the garbage it was before they fixed the things i'd say that's pretty impressive

01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:57.960
yeah and honestly the recent expansion is is stunning and um you know a lot of people

01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:03.320
are missing out i think um though square enix is an interesting predicament where they need

01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:08.280
a better catch-up system like so that people can just jump right in to the expansion i mean you can

01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:12.120
buy like a potion that lets you story skip and level skip and all this stuff but like i don't

01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:15.960
know you shouldn't have to buy that at the same time um they might want to consider giving one

01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:21.640
away like they do with world of warcraft or um i i have heard the developers say they are working

01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:25.800
on the story problem but it probably won't anything won't be in about that until the next

01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:30.200
expansion so we'll see yeah and prince bright star says in chat they're redoing the 2.0 story

01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:35.480
yeah i have heard that that they're gonna kind of redo that so um we'll see but anyway all that

01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:41.080
aside uh shadowbringers is is excellent um kind of surprised to see it so high with all the other

01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:45.800
games that have come out this year honestly so that is kind of an interesting treat if again you

01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:51.000
put stock in what metacritic has to say having the resident evil 2 remake though at the very top of

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:55.240
it just seems a little bit questionable to me i mean it's really good please don't get me wrong

01:26:55.240 --> 01:26:59.800
i think it's very well done it definitely improves on the original and ads i think it

01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:06.120
actually changes some of the dynamics for the characters in the game um but it is a remake and

01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:13.080
it is a fairly quick play so Sekiro has a much higher challenge level and it's actually about to

01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:20.040
match i think the highest of the dark souls games um for its overall revenue um

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:27.480
but i am pretty happy to see those as the top three not super surprised yeah interesting of

01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:33.000
those three i don't believe resident evil 2 is a game of the year nominee but Sekiro certainly was

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:37.720
and i think it was very pretty one of you guys said that one hard as fuck has a real shot at

01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:43.240
maybe winning so we'll see what happens i think Sekiro absolutely does have a shot i mean it's

01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:49.560
it's involved it's in depth it's hard as shit the challenge is real um but it's also got a

01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:55.880
pretty good story and quite the amazing like introductory uh bit of uh that's what i'm

01:27:55.880 --> 01:28:03.160
thinking of bit of the game uh prologue uh yeah opening chapter opening but i think that that it

01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:08.200
definitely deserves to be on the list all right do and let me ask let me ask this follow-up question

01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:13.080
how much stock do you put in what metacritic has to say and we'll throw rotten tomatoes in that you

01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:18.840
know all those uh meta review type of sites i'm asking those in the room and over in our chat room

01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:25.880
at twitch tv slash vog network my view of it is sort of a generic litmus test of what people

01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:34.360
are going to think but again it's been quote weaponized as far as damaging certain material

01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:40.840
that's come out especially the uh the little incels out there like to use it to damage

01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:47.240
games with a strong female protagonist or things that try to that might challenge their little

01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:52.520
male-dominated view on things we've seen it happen before those are user reviews though and

01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:58.120
i always throw those out i especially on those sites i do not pay attention really i thought

01:28:58.120 --> 01:29:02.600
there were just critic scores maybe i'm thinking rotten tomatoes i don't know but um well some of

01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:09.320
the other ones out there so i don't really put the stock in reviews unless it's some like if i'm

01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:17.160
watching like say a a webcast that i like like something like um game sack i really i dude just

01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:23.480
did a review of shanmu 3 and i thought that his review sounded pretty good it was about what i

01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:29.320
expected of the game and i've trusted his opinion in regards to sega and you know former sega

01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:37.400
franchises and things like that so um i trusted his opinion but it's getting a generic score when

01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:42.840
it's going all the way across the board from people who may not necessarily be the gamer that

01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:50.760
i am i may look at the score and then go look for reviews but for most of the case i'm gonna form my

01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:56.760
own opinion on it the the numbers are in the end just numbers they're not going to speak to my

01:29:56.760 --> 01:30:02.760
personal enjoyment of something granted i greatly enjoyed resident evil too it was really really

01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:09.400
good i made dan take me in my pajamas to target to go get it and we had a great time with it

01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:14.440
um there's other games on that list that i thought were really great like you know mario maker 2

01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:21.800
and you know uh links awakening of course being on that list uh but overall i mean really i think

01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:28.680
that the scores shouldn't be oh all these people thought it was great i should get it to no this

01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:33.400
is why i miss game rentals outside of the red box i miss going to like a blockbuster or something

01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:39.080
and renting the game and talking to the employees who might have also tried out said game and just

01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:46.120
getting like an in-person thing i miss you know game stop is okay for that now i missed going into

01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:50.600
some of the stores like that and having those talks with people i like to see what my friends

01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:54.920
in the real world thinks like one of my friends crystal um you know there was a game i was super

01:30:54.920 --> 01:31:01.160
excited about and they were all hey you know i don't this has just been getting pooped on by

01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:06.600
this this and this and everyone says this about it and i'm like but they're not my opinion i want

01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:13.080
to try it and see what i think yeah or people be like oh all these people think this movie is crap

01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:18.200
and blah blah blah but i like xanadu yeah no it's kind of like it's kind of like i was joking or not

01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:21.960
joking but talking about the walking simulators earlier and like a lot of people shit on things

01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:25.640
like everybody's gone to the rapture because they say great there's not a game there but i'm like no

01:31:25.640 --> 01:31:29.320
i fucking love that was one of my favorite things i played all year you know so there was a goal to

01:31:29.320 --> 01:31:33.320
accomplish what makes that not a game yeah so there was there was something i enjoyed there

01:31:33.880 --> 01:31:39.080
animal crossing doesn't have a game that you win there's more to do after you pay off your mortgage

01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:47.240
right so but what's to say that that's not a game yeah you know what's to say that you know

01:31:47.240 --> 01:31:53.720
reading a book and then playing a narrative game it's the difference between that you've read

01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:58.920
something versus the fact that you have observed something let me quickly ask loki what do you what

01:31:58.920 --> 01:32:04.760
is your stock in metacritic um i mean sometimes i'll kind of look at it just to get a general idea

01:32:04.760 --> 01:32:10.200
of what a game's being reviewed as so like if i see some negative reviews in like like for death

01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:14.040
strand or something like that where people are just hating on it i'll kind of look at general

01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:21.000
consensus to see is everybody share that opinion does you know is only a couple of critics that

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:27.160
don't like it um stuff like that but usually like i have certain people that i will listen

01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:34.520
to for their critiques on stuff because they have similar tastes than i do so um yeah i i will look

01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:39.640
at maybe the broad stroke on metacritic like if something is reviewing particularly strongly or

01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:45.720
particularly negatively that wasn't what i was expecting or you know wasn't on my radar i might

01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:50.440
kind of look like oh what's what's this noise all about and maybe look a little more into that but

01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:54.600
i think for some of those reasons the dark soccer kind of outlined that i just jumped on with that

01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:59.960
you know what one just what a critic's perception of the game might not be my own i think for me

01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:04.600
i put much more stock in things like twitch streams where i can kind of really watch people

01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:08.600
play the game youtubes would be something like that as well but i like the live nature twitch

01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:16.200
and all that so uh yep uh let's see some uh comments in our chat sg100 matt says comment

01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:21.000
sections and game reviews is the reason i stopped reading the comments and game articles honestly

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:27.000
are you missing anything though no so good for you stopping uh metal mayhem says i never pay

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:30.840
attention to metacritic if anything i pay attention to what people on my miscellaneous

01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:37.880
friends lists are playing good call um and bonds 006 says i don't care one damn what they have to

01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:43.000
say in reviews if it's a review about a huge breaking feature of a game then yeah beyond that

01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:49.640
so yep all right some good thoughts from you guys in our chat room over at twitch tv slash

01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:56.120
vog network meanwhile let's move on to what's next on our list loki so yes unfortunately 2k

01:33:56.120 --> 01:34:03.880
is going to be shutting um down or i should say gearbox is shutting down um battle born so they

01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:09.000
stopped doing updates quite a while ago almost two years ago and now uh basically 2k said as

01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:15.160
of january 2021 the battleborn servers are going to be deactivated cue the cynic in me that says

01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:22.600
it was still open um right but you know one of the things if you do buy a game like this that is

01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:28.280
only online it is now either your copy that you have is completely useless although to be fair

01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:34.040
it is free to play now so that's not such a big deal but it still kind of sucks if you did end up

01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:38.520
purchasing it at one point or another didn't one of these articles or one of the talk about it

01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:42.840
talk about how like wow what's that steam website people use steam spy or something like that yes

01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:47.480
and i did look at the steam spy numbers and yes all 12 of you that are playing the game right now

01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:52.280
or you actually have it up right now so 12 p even in spite of this news that it's closing soon that's

01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:57.080
been everywhere it has gone up so like so the average number of players is about 12.6 for the

01:34:57.080 --> 01:35:04.280
last 30 days peak being 42 players okay okay so but that's in the world in the world at one time

01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:11.240
yeah that's and and by contrast name and is there any literally any other recognized game that you

01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:16.120
could give us for con context like uh versus battleborn like dota how many people are playing

01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:22.280
dota 2 let's see i'm just trying to think uh i was gonna say totally accurate battle simulator

01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:28.840
um not battle simulator uh totally accurate uh battle royale simulating spy won't show you

01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:35.080
things like fortnite and um you know blizzard based games like overwatch and things like that

01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:43.640
so you have to bring up something like dota or um uh what about oh paladins is that on steam uh

01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:50.440
yeah i think paladins how many people are playing paladins compared to battleboard hold on i was

01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:54.200
just gonna pick this one because this is an indie game and i know it's pretty um

01:35:56.840 --> 01:36:01.960
no they don't have okay let's see paladins we're just trying to get a comparison here so 42 people

01:36:01.960 --> 01:36:07.880
at its peak we're playing battleborn this month all right we don't know i i don't like this let's

01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:16.520
yeah let's try this here we go so like if you want to go down like something that like for example

01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:24.840
dota 2 would have uh 314 000 concurrent players yeah um okay here's a much older game terraria

01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:33.800
has 40 000 um concurrent wow terraria wow yeah okay um okay so 42 not that impressive of a

01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:37.720
numbers that's sad and again we're not trying to like kick kick a horse when it's already down or

01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:41.800
whatever i mean that's unfortunate and some of you guys are hitting the nail on the head in chat

01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:47.160
um tiger class says ever since overwatch came out games like that were like it were struggling

01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:51.880
ironically paladins though seems to still be kicking along and you know since i named that

01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:56.280
one and bobby says hi rez and atlanta represent yeah but i've actually played paladins it's you

01:36:56.280 --> 01:37:01.160
know it's a similar concept although they do different things as here i'm trying to go down

01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:11.000
the list to get down to like some of the um lower doom 2329 like which doom the doom the original

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:17.000
do oh the original not even the 2017 remake or whatever i well it just says doom i don't know

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:24.920
if this is the uh remake one or not um because it doesn't really give me anything uh uh this might

01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:30.200
be the remake actually i can't i can't really tell all right quest buster says it doesn't help

01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:35.480
since uh that overwatch released a few weeks after battle born no it certainly doesn't

01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:41.000
so all of that certainly comes into play so i was trying to find something that was like

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:48.280
really ridiculous um to compare it to that with just kind of go hey see you know this game is

01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:57.720
kind of garbage and i don't know all right well moving on let's uh talk about xbox scarlets and

01:37:57.720 --> 01:38:04.680
the oh here you go this i'm sorry i'm sorry this is the perfect example uno has 1075 players

01:38:05.080 --> 01:38:11.720
concurrently versus yeah the 12 all right we we get the point we get it all right moving on let's

01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:17.720
talk about what the future might hold for project scarlet which is the name of xboxes or microsoft's

01:38:17.720 --> 01:38:24.760
next system uh there was an interview with games radar where uh the uh head of xbox game studios

01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:30.760
gentleman named matt booty uh talks about the plans for scarlet's first party support uh saying

01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:36.040
we feel really good heading into 2020 we've got a goal of being able to deliver a game

01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:41.960
roughly every three to four months so that's kind of an interesting and honestly is anyone

01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:46.360
surprised after hearing how many studios yeah i was gonna say with all those studios i mean that's

01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:50.200
like surprising again i've been saying this i've been saying this for like a year and a half ever

01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:58.040
since that news came out microsoft has been laying the chess pieces under phil spencer's direction to

01:38:58.040 --> 01:39:05.240
not let their next console go like how xbox one's launch did and i am really here for it because

01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:08.840
i think this type of competition they're going to bring to the table for the next generation of

01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:14.520
games is going to be really exciting and i hope to fuck sony's ready for it um or we're gonna

01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:19.240
or we're gonna flip-flop again and this you know this has happened every time right when the

01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:23.960
original xbox was out playstation 2 was still ahead of it then sony fell on their face with

01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:30.040
the playstation 3 reveal and the 599 xbox 360 was everywhere and then it flip-flopped again

01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:38.120
playstation 4 yeah just just like just smack the shit out of xbox one live on stage with those

01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:44.040
really like frankly smug commercials that were hilarious uh and all that stuff i i really hope

01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:49.640
sony does not allow themselves to get crisscrossed again because sony or excuse me microsoft is

01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:55.880
setting the table they are setting the silverware this is going to be and now you have to add this

01:39:55.880 --> 01:40:01.560
whole cloud stuff into it too like even if you're one of those people that's like i never buy xbox

01:40:01.560 --> 01:40:08.280
xbox isn't really my thing and you need to wake up and take notice to what's about to happen because

01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:13.480
everything that's going to be xbox is going to impact the pc gaming world too where maybe you

01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:18.440
do game so microsoft's going to really come out swing in 2020 i'm adding a little bit of editorial

01:40:18.440 --> 01:40:25.400
to the real news piece there sorry uh which is uh the uh matt booty from xbox game studio saying

01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:31.960
a goal of being able to deliver a game roughly every three to four months so um obviously halo

01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:37.400
infinite is going to be one of those a big launch title um kind of piggybacking on this a little bit

01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:42.840
cyberpunk 2077 um we know that game is coming out in march but it probably will not make

01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:49.640
scarlet or playstation 5 right around launch and that is uh according to a new earnings call from

01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:53.880
cd project red they are developing for the new console but they're not going to be able to

01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:59.240
release this at launch it could be a cross-gen title but they don't want to target anything as

01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:03.720
soon as holiday 2020 and i suppose that makes sense because who knows how much time they've

01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:10.120
actually gotten to play with these new systems or anything like that so um bonds 006 in chat says

01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:14.920
i was saying similar to a few co-workers earlier this evening about xbox and how it will impact

01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:20.760
pc gaming absolutely and look i realize there's many of you out there who don't follow microsoft

01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:25.960
because you're like eh halo not my thing and they don't have a lot of first-party franchises i'm

01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:32.760
into and i get it i've been very much the same way sometimes but you have to understand phil spencer

01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:40.600
ever since he took over he has been laying this plan out that you're gonna notice next year and

01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:46.200
if your problem is their first party titles well this is why they acquired all of these new studios

01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:51.480
to try to combat that problem if you don't really want an xbox because you're kind of like i'm over

01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:55.080
buying all these different consoles well that's why we're gonna have streaming or we're gonna

01:41:55.080 --> 01:42:01.160
have these features for pc like if you're a gamer don't sleep on microsoft i'm not even saying that

01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:07.800
as a fanboy like i i like all games i'm just i'm excited for this competition and what this next

01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:12.200
generation is going to bring like 2020 i think it's just going to be an exciting fucking year

01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:18.520
in that regard right yeah like you know you guys don't really follow microsoft but you have to admit

01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:22.120
like there's there's something to what i'm saying right yeah it looks interesting they're gonna

01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:26.760
be because i haven't really bought i haven't really bought in on like a lot of the playstation

01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:33.800
exclusive stuff so like uh for example you know god of war was all right death stranding

01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:40.840
the strand is okay but like i don't know like like horizon's pretty fun last of us just doesn't

01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:46.680
really do anything for me and same with uncharted and i don't know i even like on the microsoft

01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:53.000
side like not necessarily force is kind of cool but i i just don't really know like i'm looking

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:57.560
a lot of multi-platform games and like especially you know deep down your favorite is nintendo it

01:42:57.560 --> 01:43:05.480
still is all these years later we know it's still your fave i mean i guess all right well

01:43:05.480 --> 01:43:11.480
it only took 800 episodes to get that all right all joking aside let's move on uh dark sakura

01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:17.720
you love these types of stories so i know you want to talk about this tonight yes i indeed do

01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:25.880
okay so i i'm sure people remember the legend of rod caliber right where we beat soul caliber

01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:32.440
on dreamcast with fishing rod so and of course we've tried to use our ddr pads to play games

01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:37.000
and things like that well someone and this is probably one of the few times i'm going to bring

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:43.560
up halo stuff on purpose someone beat halo 3 on legendary with the guitar hero controller

01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:54.760
that is impressive um so and i mean we're talking about you know roughly a 10-hour game

01:43:55.560 --> 01:44:05.960
but someone went in and did the thing with a guitar hero controller um there is a d-pad on

01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:11.960
that thing now that i think about it like you can do it it's just like yikes that's that's wow

01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:19.560
wow that's so he put a video up on it there's no analog sticks the username is super lewis 64

01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:28.760
and um yeah there's a whole video up i'm sure they have a way how he did it um and he's using this

01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:36.680
the strumming and using the uh the standard fret buttons and he actually put in there his mapping

01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:43.240
with the fret buttons for how he had everything you know what they were what all the buttons were

01:44:43.240 --> 01:44:51.960
set for and that the uh the the strum bar is for moving forwards or backwards and then left and

01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:57.560
right or action you know uses a different modifying aim left aim right we're also set on

01:44:58.360 --> 01:45:03.400
the empty so i'll um i'll find the video and link it in chat for everybody sorry i didn't know there

01:45:03.400 --> 01:45:06.840
was a video i would have put it up as b-roll but that's all right for our podcast they're gonna

01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:13.640
want to find it too so right and but the but it's put up by a super lewis 64 i'll i'll go ahead and

01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:18.920
put it in the chat i'll make sure you get a link to it that's silly but fun yeah i wonder if that's

01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:23.160
because like accessibility things that you know you can map anything to anything sure yes the

01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:29.480
accessibility controller can do all sorts of crazy stuff with so all right uh this isn't quite the

01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:34.440
same i think is using the rod cap uh doing rod caliber um sj100 matt in chat says i remember

01:45:34.440 --> 01:45:39.800
hosting a party where we played mortal combat on ddr pads back in college with enough alcohol and

01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:43.880
drive anything can be played on a different controller oh yeah for sure i thought didn't we

01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:48.120
play something silly on the dreamcast ddr pads at your house i seem to remember that was a thing

01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:53.080
those dreamcast dr pads were so weird too because they had that weird like plastic layer on top of

01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:59.880
them that was kind of funky yeah it was super funky um i mean and mine like completely separated

01:45:59.880 --> 01:46:06.840
so it was like you know a dance dance slide revolution fall on your face and die yeah um but

01:46:06.840 --> 01:46:13.640
uh but boom boom dollar y'all right fucking boom boom dollar and i passed i mean that's the first

01:46:13.640 --> 01:46:19.240
place i passed paranoia was at home yeah on the dreamcast i didn't have this vivid shit when i

01:46:19.240 --> 01:46:28.600
was playing ddr fucking kids all right let's move on low-key all right so valve has uh taken a

01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:36.600
thousand games off of steam that have been abusing their tools mainly a lot of these games are

01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:45.800
actually from a specific uh user on actually i think a specific developer or several developers

01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:51.080
are actually one developer so what they're doing is it's this uh publisher called uh

01:46:51.080 --> 01:47:00.280
degstan technology had 48 games on the platform and um apparently there's um some other ones

01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:07.800
yet they've lost their entire library but i think a lot of these could be that they're just like

01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:12.760
re-release they're releasing games changing they're kind of abusing the system by just

01:47:12.760 --> 01:47:17.640
spamming games on there like for example i've seen some videos before where they're showing

01:47:17.640 --> 01:47:21.640
some of the games that they have where they'll just kind of change what the character looks like

01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:26.280
and just republish the game over and over and call it something different or release a game

01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:33.000
four times on the platform they try to get you know steam card sales um stuff like that there's

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:38.680
a whole a lot of it's made off of the steam card trading stuff where they you know anything that's

01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:44.040
easy card earnings people will sell it and they get a portion of that and they make their money

01:47:44.040 --> 01:47:51.640
that way and they give out the keys for free type of thing but um yeah they said that some of the

01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:57.880
games though that were on there weren't necessarily um just put up there for a quick buck there's a

01:47:57.880 --> 01:48:05.560
game called electric highways that had been on steam since 2015 had 1300 positive reviews so

01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:13.000
i don't know why that one got banned but that's kind of weird um sometimes you make a broad

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:18.280
stroke like this you're probably going to catch a few that maybe were more of an on the bubble

01:48:18.280 --> 01:48:23.080
sort of thing like maybe yeah without looking at like the exact games that were banned maybe that

01:48:23.080 --> 01:48:27.880
person like put up a legit game and maybe start spamming games i mean who knows um but there's

01:48:27.880 --> 01:48:33.880
a lot of um they said basically they said a handful of partners are abusing some of steamworks tools

01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:43.240
um they didn't really specify what exactly they were doing or yeah all right well moving on

01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:48.200
let's talk about um man you know earlier we talked about like final fantasy 14 and how that game has

01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:52.520
really um come a long way uh since the beginning and now it's on these metacritic lists and so

01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:56.760
forth well how about no man's sky this is another one of those games that has managed to really

01:48:56.760 --> 01:49:01.720
reinvent itself and yet again uh they've put out a pretty major update it's not a major major update

01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:08.280
but a pretty big update uh the synthesis update uh which includes a new upgrade system that will

01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:13.160
allow you to go to one of the starship outfitting terminals to spruce up your spacecraft so you can

01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:17.400
upgrade one of your ships all the way up to an s class and then you can add inventory slots to

01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:22.120
a spaceship hooray that's good uh there's also a new salvaging system that or i should say the

01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:26.200
salvage system has kind of been reworked a little bit so you can break down ships that you no longer

01:49:26.200 --> 01:49:31.400
want into actual materials so that's pretty cool um a lot of quality of life improvements to this

01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:36.360
as well hello games redid the inventory systems that's kind of interesting now you can just drag

01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:41.240
and drop things uh into your inventory so that's yeah that wasn't there before so that's pretty

01:49:41.240 --> 01:49:45.480
cool uh and you can do different outfits within the customized menu so you can switch between

01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:50.920
outfits because dress up is a very important part of any multiplayer game so that's pretty cool uh

01:49:50.920 --> 01:49:57.320
the update is out this week uh so it already came out i should say 300 bugs squashed in synthesis as

01:49:57.320 --> 01:50:02.200
well and uh you know what a turnaround story again for this game you know our voiceover guy

01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:05.240
jason and i were texting a little bit i still haven't played it since they've done all these

01:50:05.240 --> 01:50:10.520
updates i really need to go back and i think if i remember correctly i did also buy it on pc so i

01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:15.160
i really need to go back and these updates are for vr as well as non-v yeah i still haven't played

01:50:15.160 --> 01:50:21.080
in vr yet either um so uh vr will let you ride creatures and do new no man's sky photo mode

01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:26.280
so that's pretty cool cool yeah so um lots and lots of uh little changes they say over 300 bug

01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:30.680
fixes uh and that was all out within this past week you know and i'm sorry a voiceover guy jason

01:50:30.680 --> 01:50:34.200
and i were talking about how does this game kind of continue to make money because he was asking

01:50:34.200 --> 01:50:39.480
me he's like do they have a storefront or are they selling like premium currency or something nope

01:50:39.480 --> 01:50:45.160
they don't they don't sell any of that there's no uh further cost continuing sales i guess

01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:49.640
games service there's no continuing service besides well they they released on two more

01:50:49.640 --> 01:50:55.400
platforms so pc and xbox sure but that's a big difference from what anthem is doing to make money

01:50:55.560 --> 01:51:02.360
right um so uh yeah i mean i the only thing i can come up with is that when they do these big

01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:07.240
releases they tend to not put the game on sale they're still charging full price for the game

01:51:07.240 --> 01:51:12.040
but i think full price for no man's sky is down to like 30 bucks and you're only paying that full

01:51:12.040 --> 01:51:18.200
price if you buy it like you know right around one of these big patches otherwise you can usually

01:51:18.200 --> 01:51:22.040
find it during a sale for a lot cheaper and i don't know with this being i didn't really look

01:51:22.040 --> 01:51:26.360
because i already own the game on all the platforms i won it on but um i would imagine

01:51:26.360 --> 01:51:33.960
like is there a um i don't know is there like a a sale going on right now for black friday that

01:51:33.960 --> 01:51:38.920
maybe you can still pick this up cheap i don't know well cyber monday yeah and that too this

01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:42.120
whole this whole kind of weekend i think a lot of websites just kind of put something up for

01:51:42.120 --> 01:51:46.600
the whole weekend friday to monday yeah i was actually checking epic just to see what was there

01:51:46.600 --> 01:51:50.840
and actually rayman legends is free right now oh is that their free on and that's their freebie

01:51:50.840 --> 01:51:57.160
right now wow uh nifty 805 in our chat says i want a baby yoda sidekick it's not yoda yeah

01:51:57.160 --> 01:52:00.920
it's yeah so i was gonna say it's it's not supposed to be yoda right well yoda's been

01:52:00.920 --> 01:52:06.680
dead for like by because this is after return of the jedi uh-huh and yoda died in return of the

01:52:06.680 --> 01:52:15.160
jedi uh-huh so spoiler i'm just kidding fucking a but it said in between um return of the jedi and

01:52:15.880 --> 01:52:22.760
whatever the the new ray movie was um but it's they never did come out and name yoda species

01:52:22.760 --> 01:52:30.520
there was another one in uh uh the the prequels that was named yaddle rattle something like that

01:52:31.080 --> 01:52:35.000
but they never did mention the name of the species and for all the people out there by the way

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:43.240
who are saying that it's biting off of gremlins first of all fuckers empire strikes back came out

01:52:43.240 --> 01:52:51.240
in 1980 or 81 80 something like that yeah it came out in 1980 gremlins came out in 1984 i

01:52:51.240 --> 01:52:55.480
actually don't see the gremlins resemblance at all besides the pointy ears which is you know

01:52:55.480 --> 01:53:00.040
vulcans had pointy ears come on little damsel like look at the eyes and be like it looks like

01:53:00.600 --> 01:53:05.560
look at infant humans how big their eyes are on their faces right look at kittens how big their

01:53:05.560 --> 01:53:11.960
eyes are on their faces it's a thing that happens with babies and it's roughly a toddler of its

01:53:11.960 --> 01:53:18.280
species so stop it with a stupid meme it makes you look like an idiot bobby black wolf and chat

01:53:18.280 --> 01:53:25.160
said boomer okay you know what i'm gen x all the way so you can bite my butt nobody didn't like you

01:53:25.160 --> 01:53:31.080
i know forget it all right it's a meme i've seen the meme that meme's clever all right bobby says

01:53:31.080 --> 01:53:37.320
it's baby yoda and tell the creators tell me what to call him or her or it yoder nifty 805

01:53:37.320 --> 01:53:43.720
i'm calling it kiddo i know that it's not yoda but the internet um you know it's stupid too all

01:53:43.720 --> 01:53:49.240
right quest buster says someone is working on modding baby yoda into battlefront too well

01:53:49.240 --> 01:53:53.640
because the internet of course they are of course they are beyond two souls is 15 bucks all right

01:53:53.640 --> 01:53:57.400
let's you know what let's travel back to a simpler time we're gonna travel back to a simpler time in

01:53:57.400 --> 01:54:03.720
gaming where there was no baby yoda there was simply just yoda uh it's uh once uh once a week

01:54:03.720 --> 01:54:08.200
we like to step into the gaming vault and find a game that dark soccer thinks hey you ungrateful

01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:15.160
brats you should be checking this game out but in a 2019 twist once a month she likes to spotlight a

01:54:15.160 --> 01:54:20.760
soundtrack for the month and i bet you guys have no idea what it is so i didn't tell you about my

01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:25.720
fuck up earlier do you want to know about my fuck up dark so do you know how i i capture b-roll

01:54:25.720 --> 01:54:31.000
every week so what i did is i clicked the button to start recording and then i went off to take a

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:35.720
shower the only problem is i clicked the button above the one that starts recording which is the

01:54:35.720 --> 01:54:43.880
one to start streaming girl so anyone who went to my personal channel probably knows what's coming

01:54:44.520 --> 01:54:48.520
so sorry about that but it was an honest mistake i'm more worried about the fact that

01:54:48.520 --> 01:54:53.560
i broadcast a game that wasn't really the game and it was somebody else's playthrough

01:54:53.560 --> 01:54:57.640
like i was like oh shit i don't want to get in trouble no nintendo is going to be sending

01:54:57.640 --> 01:55:01.560
lawyers out well luckily it's not an internal game it doesn't matter they're gonna do it anyways

01:55:02.200 --> 01:55:07.880
luckily i i tried to delete it all and and make no trace it was an honest mistake i think people

01:55:07.880 --> 01:55:14.200
understand so anyway all right so uh i i apologize if it was spoiled for you but what is the classic

01:55:14.200 --> 01:55:19.880
classic soundtrack of the month i picked fantasy zone but i specifically picked fantasy zone

01:55:19.880 --> 01:55:27.000
for this sega mark 3 because first of all i love i fucking love this

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:31.640
you mean i'll turn up the sound a little bit here just for a moment yeah let's listen for a sec

01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:43.960
this is on the strong part right that's really good this is an eight-bit uh system so for me

01:55:43.960 --> 01:55:47.560
to get into this i'm gonna have to get into a little bit about the sega mark 3

01:55:47.560 --> 01:55:53.000
the sega mark 3 is roughly considered the precursor to the sega master system

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:59.320
but the mark 3 was also marketed as a home computer of sorts physically it looks actually

01:55:59.320 --> 01:56:08.200
kind of not unlike the atari home computers of of its era it is um an 8-bit uh an 8-bit system

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:19.320
but it had the plug-in fm uh music unit so um now built in it was just a ti sn76489

01:56:20.280 --> 01:56:29.160
chip but you could like i said go into and attach the uh an fm module to boost up that sound quality

01:56:29.160 --> 01:56:37.000
and that's what we're listening to here um as far as that fm sound unit on its own um

01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:47.640
it would plug in it was its own little box to it um it was sold uh it starting in 1987 for 6800 yen

01:56:48.680 --> 01:56:58.040
and it used a ym 2413 fm chip that built above the built-in uh ti chip texas instruments chip

01:56:58.040 --> 01:57:04.360
and so when the sega master system hit the japanese market that fm sound unit was built

01:57:04.360 --> 01:57:09.800
into the japanese version of the sega master system and of course not all the games released

01:57:09.800 --> 01:57:16.760
supported this one but fantasy zone sure as fuck did and fantasy zone is great so um you know and

01:57:16.760 --> 01:57:23.480
i've done fantasy zone for the classic game of the month too it came out in 1986 um and then it had

01:57:23.480 --> 01:57:31.320
an international uh release after the arcade game um it was the first of its series and um it just

01:57:31.320 --> 01:57:35.400
you know really keep gaming music's happy i can listen to this music all freaking day

01:57:38.120 --> 01:57:45.160
but at any rate um its first port was to the sega mark 3 and the master system um and then of course

01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:52.520
it got other reports um but the uh the music on this one in particular and of course with the fm

01:57:52.520 --> 01:57:59.480
for the uh master system is that it opened up so many more channels if you listen to

01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:04.680
the soundtrack from say the american release that doesn't have the fm sound

01:58:05.560 --> 01:58:13.800
it is kind of dinky sounding but you get this and it's on par like i was saying earlier with the um

01:58:13.800 --> 01:58:22.440
with the arcade um and i know i had the the all right there's the composer on here i had that

01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:33.240
so the composer for this is um a kaguchi hiroshi um who has worked on a lot of of games for for

01:58:33.240 --> 01:58:38.680
sega and this is actually one of the earlier games he worked on the first one was called

01:58:38.680 --> 01:58:45.640
girl's garden and he worked on it with yuji naka he did uh hang on space harrier alex kid the lost

01:58:45.640 --> 01:58:52.520
stars ghost house outrun enduro racers both afterburners uh other things that people would

01:58:52.520 --> 01:58:58.280
know about turbo outrun sort of vermilion um trying to pick some other things rent a hero

01:58:58.280 --> 01:59:06.200
outrunners and um he did like some other games too like some he did virtual fighter uh 3 tv

01:59:06.200 --> 01:59:11.560
he did derby derby owners club online rob that's one of ours so he did our horse whipping game

01:59:11.800 --> 01:59:18.520
and um he actually i fucking miss derby owners club more recently going back to our music game

01:59:18.520 --> 01:59:25.800
roots worked on my mind in fact there's some really good remixes of fantasy zone music in

01:59:25.800 --> 01:59:35.720
my mind but yeah the this really and i feel like i really missed out not having this as my first

01:59:36.440 --> 01:59:44.920
home version of fantasy zone my first fantasy zone was i think the the tangen one um which it

01:59:44.920 --> 01:59:52.680
wasn't very pretty i'll go ahead and just tell you that right now but um but i can't do our last

01:59:52.680 --> 01:59:59.720
soundtrack of the month without doing such a classic that had such a beautiful you know

01:59:59.720 --> 02:00:05.400
bright soundtrack for a home release and also to let people know that while we were sitting here

02:00:05.400 --> 02:00:12.600
with our dinky dinky you know four channels our friends in japan had this and it's so completely

02:00:12.600 --> 02:00:19.880
unfair all right there it is now i need to have my own sega mark 3 just because the classic

02:00:19.880 --> 02:00:25.000
soundtrack of the month fantasy zone but specifically on the mark 3 so that that

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:29.880
system can be acknowledged at some point yeah and of course then the fm uh

02:00:30.840 --> 02:00:37.640
uh i got my brain went to no my brain was going to say fm towns but i'm at the fm uh capable uh

02:00:37.640 --> 02:00:42.920
japanese master system oh yes it is okay so and i think that there were versions of fantasy zone

02:00:42.920 --> 02:00:47.640
for the towns but there was fancy zone on everything like you said somehow a sega game

02:00:47.640 --> 02:00:51.720
like fantasy zone even ended up on the nes thanks to the whole you know tangen bottle so

02:00:52.600 --> 02:00:59.160
it's it's it's uh quality is questionable so i don't actually think it did come out on on

02:00:59.160 --> 02:01:05.560
towns oh well then super fantasy zone with sega mega drive which if someone can find me a legit

02:01:05.560 --> 02:01:12.360
okay people in japan or somewhere in asia if you can find me a super fantasy zone for the mega

02:01:12.360 --> 02:01:22.760
drive i will um i'll bake for you i will ship it to to your country all right so it and it

02:01:22.760 --> 02:01:28.760
can't be a repro it has to be legit old school uh super fantasy zone for the mega drive

02:01:29.160 --> 02:01:34.280
all right all right there it is the classic soundtrack the final one for the year 2019

02:01:34.280 --> 02:01:40.200
so that's it so yeah next we should probably uh take a walk down memory lane and recap for the

02:01:40.200 --> 02:01:46.120
year what all the classic soundtracks were but um in the meantime uh what what's coming up next year

02:01:46.120 --> 02:01:54.040
pinball oh that's right classic pinball so i am gonna do things that are i'm gonna start with the

02:01:54.120 --> 02:02:01.320
the ones that had a dmd so you know this got the animation on it not just like

02:02:01.320 --> 02:02:05.720
and this actually does exclude one of my favorites rob it excludes black knight 2000

02:02:06.600 --> 02:02:13.480
but it's going to be any of the era of games pre-pinball 2000 but starting with some of the

02:02:13.480 --> 02:02:19.640
with whatever the first ones to have the the full dmd is so um if people have suggestions

02:02:19.640 --> 02:02:23.080
go ahead and throw them my way or else you're just gonna be getting you know world cup soccer

02:02:23.080 --> 02:02:29.720
every month kidding um but you know these and i'm trying everyone knows that like my freaking

02:02:29.720 --> 02:02:35.080
favorites are like world cup soccer and theater of magic and all that but i want to go to some of the

02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:41.960
other ones that might not be as well known but on a month you're feeling uh last minute you might

02:02:41.960 --> 02:02:50.360
see one of those well and the the thing is is that there are good games that are pre that dmd area

02:02:51.240 --> 02:02:55.480
that i think you know like swords of fury for example go fucking listen to the soundtrack

02:02:55.480 --> 02:03:00.760
for swords of fury that is phenomenal it's great you know black knight 2000 also good but i want

02:03:00.760 --> 02:03:05.480
to get some of those ones that people might have had a chance that they've seen while they were

02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:11.960
new out in the wild all right well stay tuned for 2020 in that segment now to recap 2019 and

02:03:11.960 --> 02:03:17.880
the classic 8-bit soundtrack of the month uh in january we had the guardian legend because of

02:03:17.880 --> 02:03:24.760
course we did in february we had journey to sillius march we had avadox april we had jackal

02:03:25.320 --> 02:03:33.000
may we had wonder boy 3 the dragon's trap june we had r-type july we had quartet uh august we had

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:40.120
blaster master september we had akumajo densetsu and october we had ducktales and november we had

02:03:40.120 --> 02:03:46.440
metal gear and closing it specifically the msx msx 2 metal gear and closing out the year

02:03:46.440 --> 02:03:50.840
specifically the sega mark 3 because it wouldn't be a jamie segment if she didn't like no no i

02:03:50.840 --> 02:03:57.640
want to use this to spotlight the soundtrack and the system we have fantasy zone specifically on

02:03:57.640 --> 02:04:03.080
the sega mark 3 um i honestly think the fantasy zone is one of those games that really did just

02:04:03.080 --> 02:04:09.720
show off um the power of the fm unit yeah so if you're a little newer to orange launch radio um

02:04:09.720 --> 02:04:14.360
dark soccer has been uh screwing with the segment for a couple years now we had in 2018 the classic

02:04:14.360 --> 02:04:19.240
peripheral of the month and in 2017 it was the classic console of the month that was the one

02:04:19.240 --> 02:04:24.360
that kind of started it all so um and you can uh visit all of that if you want if you're curious

02:04:24.360 --> 02:04:29.800
has this game ever been picked uh go visit our wiki it's like a it's an unofficial slash official

02:04:29.800 --> 02:04:35.080
wiki unofficial because we don't touch it or edit it because i literally don't know how like i have

02:04:35.080 --> 02:04:40.360
to ping dark tetsuya on twitter and say help like i did that today i said help this is wrong can you

02:04:40.360 --> 02:04:47.400
fix it do the thing um but also official in the fact that we we look at it and like the reason

02:04:47.400 --> 02:04:51.400
why that all came up is because dark soccer and i were having an offline conversation and i was

02:04:51.400 --> 02:04:56.440
like wait the wiki's wrong so we actually look at it and i couldn't tell you what happened on

02:04:56.440 --> 02:05:00.360
the show last week and i kind of like had a feeling i did but i didn't see it on there i was

02:05:00.360 --> 02:05:06.600
like well shit i'll do no i've had if i have a good idea what happened well i don't care i was

02:05:06.600 --> 02:05:11.240
gonna pick duck tails again and i was like i remember cutting this video like just like weeks

02:05:11.240 --> 02:05:17.160
ago yeah uh but no i and then rob's like are you sure and then we looked at the wiki together like

02:05:17.160 --> 02:05:22.040
we're missing a month what the fuck happened and then i actually thanks to the twitch archive

02:05:22.040 --> 02:05:26.360
i looked at episode and thanks to the sidebar on the side it made it really easy to find okay

02:05:26.360 --> 02:05:29.880
where's the classic game where aha here's where duck tails is in the missing the episode that's

02:05:29.880 --> 02:05:36.120
missing in the wiki so yeah so but at any rate um you know and for folks if you just want to

02:05:36.200 --> 02:05:41.160
message me on the twitters it's at dark sakura you've been using that more i have not just for

02:05:41.160 --> 02:05:46.680
cross-posting i have been but um just because facebook is shit um i got my finally got my

02:05:46.680 --> 02:05:52.920
invite to uh wt social i did too and i don't like it live journaling i've been trying to use like

02:05:52.920 --> 02:05:57.560
live journal all right i'll be i'll check out yours see if i get inspiration but anyway but

02:05:57.560 --> 02:06:04.280
anyway um so if you've got uh you know that era of pinball if there's particular games you like you

02:06:04.280 --> 02:06:08.840
know if you really want me to do the getaway you know i don't know if i'm going to do the getaway

02:06:08.840 --> 02:06:13.880
i don't really care for it but you know send me a message of the pins that you like and there's a

02:06:13.880 --> 02:06:22.360
very likely chance that i might say hey that is a good one let's do it um bobby is kind of subtly

02:06:22.360 --> 02:06:26.760
asking for his page to get updated because it's been about eight years uh saying the wiki says

02:06:26.760 --> 02:06:31.080
something about the ferret and clicky the pen and wow that's a joke we haven't referenced in forever

02:06:31.080 --> 02:06:33.960
well i don't know if you want to remove it but yeah you probably want to change the

02:06:33.960 --> 02:06:38.840
tense to like it was a former joke it was an old joke it's in a box in my house but looking up

02:06:38.840 --> 02:06:44.520
old jokes is is part of the reason why the wiki is there but i i'm i support a uh i support a

02:06:44.520 --> 02:06:49.320
freshening up i support renovations on bobby's profile to make it current i remember that

02:06:49.320 --> 02:06:56.120
shermy was the best foot warmer ever yes yes all right um let's see swang tong is asking is shaking

02:06:56.120 --> 02:07:09.000
and crying dead um no i no but it may change um but i don't want to make any promises that i can't

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:14.040
keep all i can say is that victoria went on that trip to new york city with me when we went to go

02:07:14.040 --> 02:07:18.920
see broadway plays which doesn't that sound exactly up the alley of what shaking and crying

02:07:18.920 --> 02:07:23.800
is all about and so we definitely talked about like what we want to do when it comes to podcasting

02:07:23.800 --> 02:07:30.440
but while we were there we kind of came up with a different idea that we were both really into

02:07:30.440 --> 02:07:33.560
and then thanksgiving happened and we got completely derailed because she's been out of

02:07:33.560 --> 02:07:39.400
town and you know i've been busy so and i still had that idea i know well and this is the one

02:07:39.400 --> 02:07:45.720
victoria and i have is completely different it's not what you think so um we will um it'd be

02:07:45.720 --> 02:07:51.160
exploring that in the near future that's all i can say so yes bobby knows what it is near near i have

02:07:51.160 --> 02:07:55.720
to tell bobby because i'm like bobby i'm gonna be inviting all this traffic onto the website that

02:07:55.720 --> 02:08:01.000
you weren't expecting is that okay and then it's like what traffic lol well you never know i i

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:07.960
might have the next big idea all right then you might appreciate what happened a couple weekends

02:08:07.960 --> 02:08:13.240
ago for a sister stitch and bitch session sure quickly because we're almost to 8 30 we did break

02:08:13.240 --> 02:08:17.400
out into show tunes part b of our show to get to we fully broke out into show tunes all right one

02:08:17.400 --> 02:08:21.080
of these nights i'm gonna come to the bar when you all are there and do that all right what

02:08:21.080 --> 02:08:25.880
happens yeah bobby did approve the idea it's on it's on me and victoria we haven't got up off the

02:08:25.880 --> 02:08:31.960
ground to do it yet i i think you guys will like it if you said uh nifty says that podcast was

02:08:31.960 --> 02:08:37.480
cute to me we need to hear you two theater queens geeking out i think you'll like the idea we have

02:08:37.480 --> 02:08:43.640
in store it's a little more free form i i don't know how to explain it without making promises

02:08:43.960 --> 02:08:48.840
then be expected to deliver on all right so for now let's go to rapid fire news let's uh travel

02:08:48.840 --> 02:08:54.200

not very subtle wasn't enough and titanfall 2 is an excellent game so go play that i did buy it a

02:09:29.640 --> 02:09:33.640
long time ago still haven't played it but here it's excellent and everybody says it's it's an

02:09:33.640 --> 02:09:39.240
amazing campaign it is i mean if it wasn't for that we wouldn't have apex so something to think

02:09:39.240 --> 02:09:45.880
about on the microsoft type of our side of things with uh games of gold on xbox one you're gonna get

02:09:45.880 --> 02:09:53.960
insane robots and then jurassic world evolution and then on the xbox 360 front you've got toy

02:09:53.960 --> 02:10:02.680
story 3 and castlevania lord of shadow mirror of fate hd all right some of the early impressions

02:10:02.680 --> 02:10:07.320
of the witcher's netflix series are starting to leak out onto social media technically it's

02:10:07.320 --> 02:10:14.040
embargoed until december 20th um but i guess some critics uh who have seen the first few episodes

02:10:14.040 --> 02:10:20.120
have uh written some tweets and so forth uh one critic critic said i'm quite liking it in a tweet

02:10:20.120 --> 02:10:24.760
i'll have more to say when the embargo drops uh one other one says i've never really been thirsty

02:10:24.760 --> 02:10:28.920
for henry cavill uh i've seen a screener of the first episode of the witcher and i think i'm

02:10:28.920 --> 02:10:36.520
pregnant uh the fight choreography is insane first fight is beautifully savage uh the witcher's cast

02:10:36.520 --> 02:10:41.800
both lead and supporting are beyond exceptional amazing cast all around um so it sounds like

02:10:41.800 --> 02:10:47.000
there's a lot of actually pretty good feedback on the witcher series which you know usually shows

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:52.040
that are based on a video game don't do so well but oh it's not actually based on a video game

02:10:52.040 --> 02:10:56.040
it's based on the books that the video game were also based off of if y'all were starting to type

02:10:56.040 --> 02:11:00.920
the correction in chat i know it and i guess to be fair i say that uh a lot of games haven't made

02:11:00.920 --> 02:11:05.480
good shows but uh the castlevania anime has been pretty well received from what i understand yeah

02:11:05.480 --> 02:11:11.160
the ingress anime was mixed i i could not get into that and uh what else what other games about a

02:11:11.160 --> 02:11:16.040
show that i'm not thinking of in the moment um i feel like there was another big one i'm like

02:11:16.040 --> 02:11:20.680
neglecting in the moment obviously 14 is supposed to get one i'm really excited about that i'm

02:11:20.680 --> 02:11:25.320
curious how that'll go there's actually something else kind of along with the show ish thing is that

02:11:25.320 --> 02:11:30.840
animal crossing new horizon is getting a manga oh fun yeah they've got i can talk more about

02:11:30.840 --> 02:11:35.160
they've sort of got minecraft story mode as like an interactive okay minecraft yeah yeah yeah yeah

02:11:35.160 --> 02:11:40.120
sort of okay anyway uh moving on uh i did not know this game was getting like an expansion but it is

02:11:40.120 --> 02:11:45.080
the stanley parable remember that it was at e3 yeah it was a few years ago so no actually that

02:11:45.080 --> 02:11:50.280
was this year no no no the original game all right a few years ago the expansion was this year yeah

02:11:50.280 --> 02:11:56.040
the stanley parable ultra deluxe a remaster slash expansion that will take the original game and add

02:11:56.040 --> 02:12:00.840
some new content and new endings uh it's been delayed till next year womp womp but at the same

02:12:00.840 --> 02:12:04.920
time delays aren't bad news anymore so if that's what they it's not like you don't have the and

02:12:04.920 --> 02:12:09.400
that was how they prefaced it with like they're reading fan mail and all the fans are like we

02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:14.600
want to be perfect and we don't care if you delay it well there you go challenge accepted so they've

02:12:14.600 --> 02:12:19.720
delayed it uh till next year and honestly my plate's been pretty full this year so

02:12:21.080 --> 02:12:24.840
a delay to next year is not the end of the world dark soccer what do you have for rapid fire news

02:12:24.840 --> 02:12:30.040
um capcom is going to be releasing a new game in december um according to some listings for

02:12:30.040 --> 02:12:37.080
japanese game expo um gamatsu uh there's actually a translation from gamatsu that um says that the

02:12:37.080 --> 02:12:43.960
capcom's jump festa 2020 exhibit um they are going to showcase four titles at the event two are known

02:12:43.960 --> 02:12:51.960
to be mega man zero slash zx legacy collection and a monster hunter world iceborn it could also

02:12:51.960 --> 02:12:57.480
be possible that uh the devil may cry collection could take one of those but there's one more

02:12:57.480 --> 02:13:04.520
that's unknown so we will find out uh the fest is going to run between december 1st to 22nd

02:13:04.520 --> 02:13:11.640
in cheeba i don't suppose it's a dino crisis hd collection no well one of the other things

02:13:11.640 --> 02:13:17.800
though is that of course they are working on a resident evil 3 um remake to follow the

02:13:17.800 --> 02:13:23.480
resident evil 2 remake so uh they're really wanting people to leave some feedback on that

02:13:23.480 --> 02:13:28.520
one are we gonna get a resident evil 8 because 7 is supposed to be pretty good i feel like they're

02:13:28.520 --> 02:13:34.040
kind of stuck in the fuck out in the remake thing uh and eight i mean seven kind of had that whole

02:13:34.040 --> 02:13:39.960
vr and non-vr stuff going on so i don't know what they've decided to do with eight at this point

02:13:39.960 --> 02:13:43.400
i think it'll happen but these remakes are serving them pretty well for now

02:13:43.400 --> 02:13:50.920
rob it's up to us to take down umbrella i don't want you to end up in a jamie sandwich

02:13:50.920 --> 02:13:59.880
right anyway um there's gonna be um a update for death stranding to tackle some common requests

02:13:59.880 --> 02:14:04.920
including improving the font size now keep in mind when i was looking at this i was looking

02:14:04.920 --> 02:14:10.360
really tiny font on really tiny screen and i was fine but not everyone has super jamie vision when

02:14:10.360 --> 02:14:14.040
you take off your glasses and everything's huge yeah if you're sitting next to a monitor you can

02:14:14.040 --> 02:14:18.760
probably see it okay but yeah it's it's like the subtitles are all right i was like oh why are

02:14:18.760 --> 02:14:23.160
people playing but then i saw like in the quest menus and stuff i'm like okay damn that is some

02:14:23.160 --> 02:14:32.600
tiny ass text wow um um but also um there um there's gonna be another thing that addresses

02:14:32.600 --> 02:14:38.120
a request to be able to dispose of individual vehicles so they're looking about patching that

02:14:38.120 --> 02:14:46.040
in for the mid-december patch um and hold on just double check to see if there's anything else i

02:14:46.040 --> 02:14:50.120
don't even have a vehicle yet i will say where i'm at in the game and i don't think this is spoilery

02:14:50.120 --> 02:14:56.440
vehicles were in trailers um i i have the quest to because i just got the ability to build like

02:14:56.440 --> 02:15:01.800
a power source in my structure so i have a directive to go build one of those next to a bike

02:15:01.800 --> 02:15:05.720
that's run out of power it's been sitting there for a while so that's so for those of you that

02:15:05.720 --> 02:15:09.720
played death stranding that's exactly where i'm at in the game well there's they did with the

02:15:09.720 --> 02:15:16.760
last update um had some performance improvements and uh worked on some network functionality um

02:15:18.120 --> 02:15:25.720
but yeah there you go so that's our current quick stuff all right so let's travel around the world

02:15:25.720 --> 02:15:30.040
and check out what is coming out this week in world release dates i imagine it's a pretty slow

02:15:30.040 --> 02:15:34.040
week being that the holidays just occurred but you never know i do you think so and you're right

02:15:34.040 --> 02:15:38.680
you never know what's right around the corner in fact we have several things coming out this week

02:15:38.680 --> 02:15:45.320
so we have blair witch coming out on playstation 4 we have halo reach um on pc i believe that's

02:15:45.320 --> 02:15:51.960
just being added to the master chief collection uh life is strange episode 5 on pc playstation

02:15:51.960 --> 02:15:57.640
4 and xbox one never winter nights enhanced edition on nintendo switch playstation 4 and xbox

02:15:57.640 --> 02:16:08.280
one phoenix point on pc and mac saga scarlet grace ambitions on pc nintendo switch playstation

02:16:08.280 --> 02:16:18.520

02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:35.800
uh raging loop on pc star ocean first departure r on nintendo switch and playstation 4 and last

02:16:35.800 --> 02:16:43.880
but not least ancestors the humankind odyssey on playstation 4 and xbox one all right so it's

02:16:43.880 --> 02:16:47.160
pretty still a pretty busy week i thought i would have thought it would be a dead week but not

02:16:47.160 --> 02:16:52.840
really um it's starting after this week it'll start to slow down a bit and then really die off

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:57.240
about the second or third week in december fair enough well japan since things are a little

02:16:57.240 --> 02:17:00.920
different holidays are kind of a different perception over there uh it's a very different

02:17:00.920 --> 02:17:05.320
kind of week uh we got some big names out this week in japan on the playstation 4 including yokai

02:17:05.320 --> 02:17:12.440
watch 4 plus plus on the playstation 4 so that's you know a a disc or a non-handheld release uh for

02:17:12.440 --> 02:17:17.000
yokai watch that's a pretty big deal i i wish that series hadn't kind of disappeared here i was into

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:21.080
it in the beginning so i wish they would try a playstation 4 or switch release also something

02:17:21.080 --> 02:17:25.720
in a high tv show oh yeah that's true all right so but anyway still pretty big over there though

02:17:25.720 --> 02:17:29.480
oh no it's still huge over there so i'm not too surprised to hear i kind of wanted to sit and

02:17:29.480 --> 02:17:35.400
watch the anime just because i love uh the folklore of yokai um also out in japan this

02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:40.440
week the dark pictures man of madan um gets its release in japan this week they are saying it is

02:17:40.440 --> 02:17:44.280
an english version it hasn't been localized for japan um but that is out if they want to check

02:17:44.280 --> 02:17:49.720
that out uh and then a game called citadel is out this week as well and what is arguably the

02:17:49.720 --> 02:17:53.800
biggest release in japan this week no just kidding it's definitely yokai watch but you know this one

02:17:53.800 --> 02:17:59.720
caught my eye oni chambara origin is out on the playstation 4 this week oh that's right if you

02:17:59.720 --> 02:18:05.240
don't know oni chambara you should check it bikini samurai that's right it's all the the ladies

02:18:05.240 --> 02:18:12.120
wearing very little clothes i really wish more of the simple 1000 games or 2000 games actually ended

02:18:12.120 --> 02:18:19.080
up coming out um aside from just you know earth defense force and on chambara i mean like they

02:18:19.080 --> 02:18:25.720
had ambulance versus zombies and that's really the only other one i remember but uh more simple

02:18:25.720 --> 02:18:31.240
series games or games like that all right well looking at the nintendo switch of course yokai

02:18:31.240 --> 02:18:35.480
watch 4 plus plus is out on that system as well but then we have another couple titles we have

02:18:35.480 --> 02:18:42.200
a game called moto new pus osumatsu san uh which comes out from d3 it looks like it's like just

02:18:42.200 --> 02:18:46.360
a match 3 type of game but like there's two different versions of this game and everything

02:18:46.840 --> 02:18:52.040
so it's yeah simple controls match 3 i guess there's a story that goes with it i don't know

02:18:52.040 --> 02:18:57.720
seems like kind of a big deal for a match 3 game um always a big deal though is a pretty princess

02:18:57.720 --> 02:19:01.480
game that's right pretty princess magical coordinate is out this week on the switch as

02:19:01.480 --> 02:19:08.360
well where you get to decorate over 1300 castle excuse me castle rooms with 1300 items you can

02:19:08.360 --> 02:19:13.320
customize your character and feel like a princess you can do princess training lessons and mini

02:19:13.320 --> 02:19:18.200
games so you can perfect your wave i'm sure as the decorating thing sounds kind of fun um and

02:19:18.200 --> 02:19:22.280
then you can have your princess make poses and take pictures of the finished rooms how about

02:19:22.280 --> 02:19:25.960
that it's a one to four player four player game so i guess you get to decorate together

so that's it all right there it is release dates from around the world um still pretty pretty busy

02:20:31.640 --> 02:20:35.000
this early december but yeah probably because we're right in that gap where it's like okay

02:20:35.000 --> 02:20:38.920
now's your last chance to get the game out before the end of the year uh before christmas and all

02:20:48.520 --> 02:20:53.080
you want to send us an email for a future week please do participate at orange lounge radio.com

02:20:53.080 --> 02:20:58.680
and dark sakura is going to jump in the mailbag and read some stuff okay um so uh we have one

02:20:58.680 --> 02:21:04.120
from robert m which is sort of a follow-up from the bunch of other operating system questions but

02:21:04.120 --> 02:21:10.520
i will go ahead and read part of this too um just uh just keep going um is citing older versions of

02:21:10.520 --> 02:21:15.560
mac and ios systems from the last time the older games lost support and catalina that is correct

02:21:15.560 --> 02:21:23.480
catalina no longer supports 32-bit applications and games so um um and then he asked is super

02:21:23.480 --> 02:21:30.600
multitasking plus ultra is it 64-bit yyr that would be a yyr question i don't know please let

02:21:30.600 --> 02:21:38.200
us know if it's a 64-bit app um the discussion of half-life alex as valve's first game in a

02:21:38.200 --> 02:21:45.000
long time reminded me of the recent forgotten uh card game artifact i assume if it's still

02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:50.600
uh being supported it probably is not going to see as much of an uptick as magic games are as

02:21:50.600 --> 02:21:56.760
the hearthstone alternative so how about that like magic yyr is in chat thank you so much

02:21:56.760 --> 02:22:03.800
buddy uh saying it is 64-bit on mac 32-bit on windows so it's where it needs to be to run

02:22:04.520 --> 02:22:10.040
so there you go all right so yeah if you're gonna play it on a mac upgrade i mean you can know you

02:22:10.040 --> 02:22:17.240
can do it on the current os's so yeah sorry brain went around okay and then um i got a two-part

02:22:17.240 --> 02:22:23.640
email from flaco jones oh important footnote from yyr but future mac support is up in the air will

02:22:23.640 --> 02:22:30.760
be determined over the coming months i wonder if that has to do with um sales so mac fans get on

02:22:30.760 --> 02:22:35.240
that super multitasking i'm making that up he didn't say why i imagine it's probably difficult

02:22:35.240 --> 02:22:39.400
give me an app store link and i'll make it fly well i don't think it's on the app store yet

02:22:40.040 --> 02:22:44.680
it needs to be in the app store yeah i don't know there might be there might be a problem with steam

02:22:44.680 --> 02:22:49.400
green light in the way that was all put up i don't know i don't know that's a that's an oh and and

02:22:49.400 --> 02:22:52.920
the leaderboards are built into the games that would be a whole undertaking for him so i can

02:22:52.920 --> 02:22:58.280
understand why he wants to focus he wants to focus on his expansion first i'm sure anyway hey i just

02:22:58.280 --> 02:23:02.040
wanted to pop in with a little correction on your game rewards talk so that you have the right info

02:23:02.040 --> 02:23:07.960
on how they work this is flaco jones by the way while fans do get a vote and how these awards go

02:23:07.960 --> 02:23:15.080
it only accounts for 10 of the vote the voting jury composed of 80 media and influencer outlets

02:23:15.080 --> 02:23:20.680
from around the world accounts do the other 90 of the vote so unless the vote is really close i

02:23:20.680 --> 02:23:27.960
don't think fans have much of a sway over who actually wins if they did i doubt a small game

02:23:27.960 --> 02:23:33.800
like overcook 2 would have beaten all those much more well-known nintendo games for best family

02:23:33.800 --> 02:23:39.000
game last year also over half of those outlets are from outside the united states which makes

02:23:39.000 --> 02:23:44.760
them less predictable based on how those games are received from our perspective here in the us

02:23:44.760 --> 02:23:49.640
the jury isn't entirely made up of critical publications like i mentioned earlier if it

02:23:49.640 --> 02:23:54.840
was just based on critics control probably wouldn't have a chance as it was the lowest

02:23:54.840 --> 02:23:59.720
metacritic score of all the game of the year nominees you definitely hit the nail on the head

02:23:59.720 --> 02:24:05.880
about the ongoing game category though it was a big shock that overwatch wasn't nominated as it

02:24:05.880 --> 02:24:11.560
had been for the last two years and it won the category in 2017 i think final fantasy 14 has

02:24:11.560 --> 02:24:18.040
shot over fortnite fortnite already won last year and again fan vote doesn't really mean anything

02:24:18.040 --> 02:24:24.600
i was a little surprised that blitzchung didn't uh get a nomination for best esports player i

02:24:24.600 --> 02:24:29.000
thought that would have been interesting but i don't really know how he did outside of the

02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:34.280
tournament he won where he spoke out and got suspended have a great rest of your stream

02:24:34.280 --> 02:24:40.200
flaco jones um very good points yeah i'll let you read that in a sec um i just want to say you know

02:24:40.200 --> 02:24:46.440
oops we got it wrong sorry last week so um thanks for correcting how that all is um judged he makes

02:24:46.440 --> 02:24:52.120
a really great analogy in the next email but i wanted to quickly say on um control and metacritic

02:24:52.120 --> 02:24:56.200
and all that and you mentioned that final fantasy 14 has a shot um since we just talked about

02:24:56.200 --> 02:25:00.680
metacritic earlier in the show it does seem like the barometer may be tilting in final fantasy 14's

02:25:00.680 --> 02:25:04.840
favor so uh the blitzchung thing though i mean there was a part of me that was like well what

02:25:04.840 --> 02:25:10.120
was the deadline for this maybe but i i would have thought nah i'm sure this that whole incident

02:25:10.120 --> 02:25:16.200
could have happened before the deadline so um who knows why that didn't end up happening perhaps

02:25:16.200 --> 02:25:21.960
um they were nervous about putting that in the spotlight i don't know anyway um let's hear the

02:25:21.960 --> 02:25:26.920
other email though because he makes a great comparison in this email second email because

02:25:26.920 --> 02:25:31.640
i forgot to mention one point i wanted to make about the game awards personally i find them to

02:25:31.640 --> 02:25:36.120
be more like the golden globes of the game industry since the winners are determined by a global jury

02:25:36.120 --> 02:25:42.680
of media and not game makers themselves i put more stock in who wins at the dice awards in february

02:25:42.680 --> 02:25:47.400
which are actually voted on by peers who work in game development and publishing a lot more like

02:25:47.400 --> 02:25:51.880
the oscars if we're still comparing it to movie awards but since they come out later and don't

02:25:51.880 --> 02:25:57.560
have the media outlets attached they don't usually get as much buzz okay that's it for the award

02:25:57.560 --> 02:26:02.920
emails flaco jones i just wanted to call out what a great comparison that is when many people are

02:26:02.920 --> 02:26:08.520
saying that the game awards should be the oscars of gaming in a way um very interesting to call

02:26:08.520 --> 02:26:13.960
out but the way they're voted on oscars are voted on by industry peers and people that are you know

02:26:13.960 --> 02:26:19.720
within the film industry and so forth so really it's the dice awards that are kind of the barometer

02:26:19.720 --> 02:26:27.240
there whereas the way this is voted on by media worldwide that is how the golden globes are voted

02:26:27.240 --> 02:26:31.880
on it so the golden globes doesn't have the fan part of it but i mean still the comparison i think

02:26:31.880 --> 02:26:37.480
is is pretty good what you're getting at there um and golden globes was always supposed to be the

02:26:37.480 --> 02:26:43.320
more informal one the more party atmosphere right um the golden globes used to be the laughing stock

02:26:43.320 --> 02:26:47.000
of the film industry like people didn't even want to be seen there but they really kind of

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:51.560
started turning it around what was it probably like the 90s the late 80s or the 90s i think a

02:26:51.560 --> 02:26:56.440
lot of people with the golden globes probably remember one of the first big things that

02:26:56.440 --> 02:27:02.520
contributed to that party atmosphere of the golden globes was when christine lottie won that award

02:27:02.520 --> 02:27:08.040
for whatever tv show she was on at the time but she was in the bathroom so robin williams jumped

02:27:08.040 --> 02:27:13.560
on stage and just started doing this improv live and was like paging christine lottie and stuff

02:27:13.560 --> 02:27:17.480
and it was this really funny because you know robin williams could pull comedy out of his butt

02:27:17.480 --> 02:27:22.520
and it was hilarious right he was great in that regard um and i think that really made a lot more

02:27:22.520 --> 02:27:27.320
people start paying attention to the golden globes being like the party one and then they then the

02:27:27.320 --> 02:27:31.640
golden globes kind of billed itself as that and they had ricky jervais host those few years and

02:27:31.640 --> 02:27:37.000
they they loved him for a while because he was so unpredictable and so forth that was the one that

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:40.920
tina fey and amy polar hosted which i don't know why they don't do it every year they prob they

02:27:40.920 --> 02:27:44.280
probably turned it down because they have other projects they want to do but they're hilarious

02:27:44.280 --> 02:27:48.840
and so forth so you know especially because the game awards i think are definitely the showier

02:27:48.840 --> 02:27:54.840
show whereas the dice awards are more the you know industry thing but we just don't really see the

02:27:54.840 --> 02:28:01.320
dice awards they don't televise that so it doesn't feel as oscary and so forth so i'm glad they don't

02:28:01.320 --> 02:28:07.640
have celebrity hosts doing it because like i know like several years like different not necessarily

02:28:07.640 --> 02:28:16.520
award shows but like presenters joel mchale or even uh uh conan o'brien it has to not it has to

02:28:16.520 --> 02:28:22.200
be the right presenter like for example i consider aisha tyler a celebrity presenter but like she

02:28:22.200 --> 02:28:27.960
knows her shit because she plays halo and shit in her downtime like she she knew her games you know

02:28:27.960 --> 02:28:33.160
she was an authentic voice in the celebrities i think i say was because i haven't seen her

02:28:33.160 --> 02:28:39.160
do anything in gaming in a while but you know when she would talk about gear is a war on her

02:28:39.160 --> 02:28:42.200
show or whatever because she was on the talk for a while i don't think i don't know if she ever

02:28:42.200 --> 02:28:45.640
brought it up there but it's like she she knew what she was talking about she was being told

02:28:45.640 --> 02:28:50.680
let's say she knew what she was talking about yeah you know and even though conan o'brien makes it

02:28:50.680 --> 02:28:56.520
funny i still feel like he kind of really does play games but it's it's he his job is to not

02:28:56.520 --> 02:29:02.200
make it serious um i still don't think he's funny uh well jimmy fallon then we'll go with that

02:29:02.200 --> 02:29:08.360
because he's brought more video game exposure to the tonight show which is always kind of like

02:29:08.360 --> 02:29:12.680
i mean you want to talk about okay boomer the tonight show is always that show that you kind

02:29:12.680 --> 02:29:17.560
of associate with like a much different generation jimmy fallon love him or hate him has kind of had

02:29:17.560 --> 02:29:23.000
this responsibility to try to make this show more accessible to a wider audience because let's be

02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:27.640
real jay leno never did that and when conan o'brien swung that pendulum too hard in the

02:29:27.640 --> 02:29:32.680
other direction he lost his show in seven months so jimmy fallon's been in this very hard place

02:29:32.680 --> 02:29:36.520
where he's kind of had to walk the line and make a show that's accessible to the legacy of the

02:29:36.520 --> 02:29:43.400
tonight show but also one that is going to live on you know with newer generations and he's done that

02:29:43.400 --> 02:29:51.320
in part by having um oh what's her name captain marvel playing uh beat saber brie larson thank

02:29:51.320 --> 02:29:56.120
you brie larson playing beat saber was it was it her i was somebody that one of one of the marvel

02:29:56.120 --> 02:30:00.520
girls was playing beat saber with her on uh with him and you know he was one of the first to show

02:30:00.520 --> 02:30:08.760
the switch that that gif or gif whatever you want to say of of um um oh my god miyamoto in the

02:30:08.760 --> 02:30:13.080
audience where he does that whole like thumbs up thing that whole gift of him out there that was

02:30:13.080 --> 02:30:16.760
from the tonight show you know so anyway i'm sorry i don't remember where i was going with

02:30:16.760 --> 02:30:21.080
this but i was just kind of pointing out like you know oh media and having to embrace games

02:30:21.080 --> 02:30:26.680
and celebrities and that whole sort of thing so um swang tong says whatever happened to conan

02:30:26.680 --> 02:30:31.880
he's been on tbs this whole time yeah um i and they he doesn't need to pull in the same type of

02:30:31.880 --> 02:30:36.680
numbers on well nowadays like it's i don't know how well these like late shows are really doing

02:30:36.680 --> 02:30:43.640
because most people watch consume these through clips on youtube that's how i do it i mean i

02:30:43.640 --> 02:30:49.320
don't watch like i don't watch uh any of these guys but i'll just watch the clips i don't think

02:30:49.320 --> 02:30:54.440
i would ever watch one of these late night live shows i used to back in the day i i remember

02:30:54.440 --> 02:30:59.320
watching johnny carson in my bedroom okay like i'm dating myself i know that towards the end of his

02:30:59.320 --> 02:31:03.640
run and i was probably 10 or 11. i used to watch the reruns of conan o'brien though like when they

02:31:03.640 --> 02:31:08.040
would rerun them during the day we used to gather up in the dorm room and watch late night with conan

02:31:08.040 --> 02:31:14.840
o'brien like yeah he was like his target audience i think i i love well i saw him live i went to his

02:31:14.840 --> 02:31:19.960
live tour and it was fantastic the one here in sac i did san francisco yes and i loved it it

02:31:19.960 --> 02:31:23.160
was great yeah i thought it was funny i had a great time but i have to admit i haven't been

02:31:23.160 --> 02:31:27.160
following the tbs show as much because i just don't watch a lot of late night stuff and you're

02:31:27.160 --> 02:31:31.640
right it's all consumed in bits and honestly you know who you know who i see more than anybody else

02:31:31.640 --> 02:31:35.160
like the youtubes i see more than anybody else that i probably watch more than anybody else

02:31:35.160 --> 02:31:39.720
jimmy kimmel and i would have never thought that would be the case because jimmy kimmel reminds me

02:31:39.720 --> 02:31:45.320
of the man show which was fucking ridiculous but his late night show he's got a lot of good viral

02:31:45.320 --> 02:31:50.120
clips i usually watch uh late night with seth meyers or uh i'll watch the clips also of um

02:31:51.960 --> 02:31:58.840
uh steven colbert i like samantha b and john oliver yeah john oliver i'll use watch that

02:32:00.040 --> 02:32:06.360
like good like thinky stuff um i i what i want to say about um jimmy kimmel oh i think the best

02:32:06.360 --> 02:32:12.680
clip that i saw him do was when he manufactured that viral clip of like the girl twerking on the

02:32:12.680 --> 02:32:16.920
door and then the door opens and it falls over and they show that went that was a legit thing

02:32:16.920 --> 02:32:21.560
that they put on youtube it went viral and then on his show they revealed that when the door opens

02:32:21.560 --> 02:32:25.560
it's jimmy kimmel on the other side of the door and like he kind of showed like we made this clip

02:32:25.560 --> 02:32:30.680
go viral and this is how we did it and i just thought it was very interesting so anyway and

02:32:30.680 --> 02:32:35.640
then they brought on the girl that was twerking it was like a stunt stunt woman or something from

02:32:35.640 --> 02:32:40.920
motion pictures so anyway i just thought it was interesting so um and bobby does point out the

02:32:40.920 --> 02:32:44.760
good thing about oliver and b is that they're weekly and not nightly and you do see a lot of

02:32:44.760 --> 02:32:51.960
shows kind of going that way as a result i used to love the daily show but i don't the clips that

02:32:51.960 --> 02:32:55.720
aren't as great as they used to be i don't know if i just don't care for the new guy as much as

02:32:55.720 --> 02:33:00.920
you know john stewart or what it is i don't know i used to love letterman back in the day i think

02:33:00.920 --> 02:33:06.920
when letterman first took over at cbs that was like the heyday of late night television anyway

02:33:07.560 --> 02:33:12.440
because i always thought leno was lame i never cared for him leno is a shithole but he has a

02:33:12.440 --> 02:33:20.680
great car collection he had and he has a die-hard fan base of sorts i don't i don't get it anyway

02:33:20.680 --> 02:33:26.440
he's just not a good person i think i don't think he's funny at all like anyway anyway it's not about

02:33:26.440 --> 02:33:30.520
late night i don't think he's funny in the same way i don't think that rodney dangerfield was

02:33:30.520 --> 02:33:39.000
funny that whole well i'm an asshole what are you gonna do but yeah like but bianca del rio

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:43.560
does that same shtick and it's funny yeah but bianca del rio is actually smart yeah i guess

02:33:43.560 --> 02:33:48.120
that's true all right anyway let's move on and joan rivers did a lot of that same shtick but she's

02:33:48.120 --> 02:33:54.280
smart she was a genius right all right let's move on um and full of preservatives let's talk about

02:33:54.280 --> 02:33:59.720
more stadia news i talked about stadia earlier in the show yes so stadia pro they have that

02:33:59.720 --> 02:34:05.240
subscription service which they're supposed to be giving new games uh each month and you know we

02:34:05.240 --> 02:34:09.960
talked about last month how the only game that's really free right now is stadia probe was destiny

02:34:09.960 --> 02:34:15.560
2 well that's actually going to change because now they've added a few more games for december that

02:34:15.560 --> 02:34:21.640
are going to be available as well so um those being tomb raider and farming simulator 19

02:34:22.200 --> 02:34:30.280
which um are available but apparently though anybody that bought those games now will actually

02:34:30.280 --> 02:34:36.280
be getting a discount because they okay i'm sorry they're not free i guess you get a discount on

02:34:36.280 --> 02:34:42.440
those um no they are free so they're giving you i guess a discount of 10 on tomb raider and 50 on

02:34:42.440 --> 02:34:48.920
farming simulator 19 which i'm assuming is just the list price for those uh but yeah so those i

02:34:48.920 --> 02:34:54.360
guess are finally live and i guess that i i don't know they need to do a better job of actually

02:34:54.360 --> 02:35:00.520
communicating which games are free with stadia pro each month i guess they do have it now where

02:35:00.520 --> 02:35:05.480
they're showing you know the december and i guess oh samurai showed that was another one that was

02:35:05.480 --> 02:35:09.960
free as well chat was correct you on that but yeah sorry they added simmer i forgot the samurai

02:35:09.960 --> 02:35:13.720
showing out like the last minute it was in there yeah but like you know it'd be nice to know like

02:35:13.720 --> 02:35:20.120
what um like say for example january is going to be and stuff like that just i mean i get it like

02:35:20.120 --> 02:35:28.280
it you don't really do that necessarily with um you like the playstation plus stuff in that but

02:35:28.920 --> 02:35:33.240
if you're paying for stadia pro i mean there's such a small library right now that you would

02:35:33.240 --> 02:35:38.760
think that they would kind of say hey oh shit i didn't even okay so here's the fun this is why i

02:35:38.760 --> 02:35:43.400
said oh shit so i was actually bringing up the stadia app so loki could kind of see this firsthand

02:35:43.400 --> 02:35:47.160
what it looks like in the app that they do actually have a section that says stadia pro

02:35:47.160 --> 02:35:52.120
games is right there so and these are the ones that are all free and why i went oh shit is

02:35:52.120 --> 02:35:56.280
because tomb raider and farming simulator are already there they went apparently they went

02:35:56.280 --> 02:36:01.080
free today yeah because it's december i i well yeah but you know like playstation plus games

02:36:01.080 --> 02:36:05.400
aren't live until like the first thursday in december it's not always december 1st so i just

02:36:05.400 --> 02:36:10.120
oh shitted because i'm like oh tomb raider and farming simulator farming simulator fuck yes

02:36:11.080 --> 02:36:16.680
you know actually i will say that euro truck simulator and those those games are actually

02:36:16.680 --> 02:36:23.560
like in a zen sort of way like really relaxing and fun so i'll try for free free well yeah free

02:36:23.560 --> 02:36:28.840
because bobby gave me his buddy pass thanks bobby i can't murder me anybody in those games i'm not

02:36:28.840 --> 02:36:33.400
really necessarily so i'm sorry i guess well you can murder him in tomb raider i was gonna say i

02:36:33.400 --> 02:36:39.560
had to leave all my murdering to me him yes to uh tomb raider so neat neat i had no idea um that

02:36:39.560 --> 02:36:44.760
those games were um actually out so i'm good to know i'll be checking that out a little later on

02:36:44.760 --> 02:36:51.320
i wish i could stream it but obviously you see the problem i can't stream while i'm streaming

02:36:51.320 --> 02:36:56.920
i guess i could but it would affect the quality of both one or the other uh but i could record it

02:36:56.920 --> 02:37:02.680
and i've thought about doing this would you guys even care what if i recorded like a long play and

02:37:02.680 --> 02:37:07.960
just debuted it on twitch during the day um on a random night when there's no live vog programming

02:37:07.960 --> 02:37:10.280
what would you think would you would you care about that or would you just be like eh

02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:17.800
kind of a question for you guys because or they may think i go where i want to go rob's gonna be

02:37:17.800 --> 02:37:22.760
like all wolf which is fine but i'm just curious like if i were to record stadia stuff and they're

02:37:22.760 --> 02:37:29.800
gonna be like this isn't a pinball game do i have to play pinball no because you you accidentally

02:37:29.800 --> 02:37:37.800
broadcast your footage from the b-roll oh shut up all right moving on uh let's talk about this

02:37:37.800 --> 02:37:41.400
i just thought this was you know it's a bit of a slower news week so i thought this was like oh

02:37:41.400 --> 02:37:48.600
interesting um and this has to do with minecraft um and it has to do with the vatican um so we have

02:37:48.600 --> 02:37:54.280
a news article about a priest that is going to be launching a vatican minecraft server

02:37:54.280 --> 02:38:03.320
um and so it's fr what's fr short for for france france friends god damn it what are the france

02:38:03.320 --> 02:38:09.160
no it's the title in the church oh not deacon not pope not what's fr

02:38:10.600 --> 02:38:16.200
father father oh that's our friar that's way too easier than father's father probably works

02:38:16.200 --> 02:38:23.240
well you're you're saying this to the the nun i know father robert balacer um who is a jesuit

02:38:23.240 --> 02:38:28.280
priest who studied engineering in silicon valley is wanting to introduce the vatican's minecraft

02:38:28.280 --> 02:38:33.560
server as a place where players can express themselves in a environment that is not as toxic

02:38:33.560 --> 02:38:37.960
as maybe other things that you're running out to out there so like i guess if you will a safe space

02:38:37.960 --> 02:38:42.200
um then you may find in other games oh pot culture points out he's from this week in tech i didn't

02:38:42.200 --> 02:38:48.280
know that okay so this guy's kind of involved with tech stuff before so the project started on

02:38:48.280 --> 02:38:53.560
twitter and he polled the followers on what game do you want to do a test server rust arc team

02:38:53.560 --> 02:38:58.360
fortress 2 or minecraft and 64 of the votes went to minecraft yeah i don't know if russ didn't

02:38:58.360 --> 02:39:04.840
necessarily be the uh the best choice for don't don't you hang dong in that game so like i don't

02:39:04.840 --> 02:39:11.000
know if that's he took a vote of sorts so anyway uh father robert balacer uh says in a quote rome

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:15.480
reports uh it's not about the technology it's not even really about the gaming it's about getting

02:39:15.480 --> 02:39:20.680
people together who can then maybe move those relationships to the real world at first there

02:39:20.680 --> 02:39:25.240
were a lot of people who were very hesitant because you see this guy in a collar talking

02:39:25.240 --> 02:39:30.520
about the latest offerings from google or how you run fiber optics across the atlantic and they

02:39:30.520 --> 02:39:35.080
didn't understand they said wait a minute these two things don't go together but after a time they

02:39:35.080 --> 02:39:39.400
realized okay he knows what he's talking about he just happens to be a priest and ultimately that

02:39:39.400 --> 02:39:44.680
was the ministry i was trying to do you know despite however you might feel about the church

02:39:44.680 --> 02:39:49.320
organized religion and that sort of thing i you have to admire what this guy's trying to do

02:39:50.040 --> 02:39:55.320
this is smart this and it's it's funny because we were just talking about like late night and having

02:39:55.320 --> 02:40:00.600
to bridge the generations and when i i don't know about you guys when i think about the vatican i

02:40:00.600 --> 02:40:05.240
think about the pope i think about a lot of these fathers these people you know who i think about

02:40:05.240 --> 02:40:10.680
fucking old people really old people well right and and i and i think what he's doing is a great

02:40:10.680 --> 02:40:16.600
thing i'm just worried that this is going to be a beacon for like trolls it's just like hey let's

02:40:16.600 --> 02:40:22.040
this this is a good place to focus our energy like and yeah you know i think they can accomplish it

02:40:22.040 --> 02:40:27.240
it's just it's gonna take a whole hell a lot of moderation if he's done this work with this week

02:40:27.240 --> 02:40:33.880
in tech and worked in silicon valley before i think he well knows about that and the way i've

02:40:33.880 --> 02:40:39.880
kind of seen this approached before is that you know usually if trolls come in um you pray for

02:40:39.880 --> 02:40:44.360
them you you try to reach out through prayer and that sort of thing you know again i'm not i'm not

02:40:44.360 --> 02:40:48.520
gonna speak on behalf of the church i'm not trying to say this but i'm just kind of in my experience

02:40:48.520 --> 02:40:56.360
of watching this you know you try to still build a bridge even if somebody is a troll um they still

02:40:56.360 --> 02:41:00.440
took a minute to walk into your church so to speak so what are you gonna do you're gonna preach at

02:41:00.440 --> 02:41:05.320
him right so he may still be trying to build a bridge maybe again i don't speak for this guy

02:41:05.320 --> 02:41:09.400
but i'm thinking he may be trying to build a bridge with trolls and so forth as well

02:41:09.960 --> 02:41:15.080
um so who knows anyway i just thought you know honestly it's funny because i was reminded of

02:41:15.080 --> 02:41:22.360
the movie sister act and what's one of the key plot points in sister act you have the old school

02:41:22.360 --> 02:41:28.520
versus the new school right you have maggie smith playing you know the the mother mother hand or

02:41:28.520 --> 02:41:33.880
whatever or mother superior right of the of the um nuns and she wants to do things very old school

02:41:33.880 --> 02:41:38.600
she wants everything to be traditional she wants everything to be very you know by the book i

02:41:38.600 --> 02:41:43.000
became a nun so i could live this particular life and then when whoopi goldberg comes in because

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:49.240
she's being hidden there by the cops she has this whole different approach to it where she's she

02:41:49.240 --> 02:41:54.280
brings her lounge club experience into it where she's like we could put some butts in these seats

02:41:54.280 --> 02:41:59.560
if we were to actually like modernize what we're doing and at the end of the day the priest in a

02:41:59.560 --> 02:42:05.160
way or the the deacon of the church or whatever kind of sides with whoopi's character whereas

02:42:05.160 --> 02:42:12.200
he's still trying to um be respectful to the history and what's happening by trying to um you

02:42:12.200 --> 02:42:16.520
know be respectful of maggie smith's character so yes i just took a gaming story and compared it to

02:42:16.520 --> 02:42:21.640
sister act but god damn it it works because the plot of that movie was about how they were

02:42:21.640 --> 02:42:28.600
reaching out and making more people um interested in faith and religion by making it accessible

02:42:28.600 --> 02:42:33.800
yeah and doggone it that's what this guy's trying to do in a way so you know again say what you want

02:42:33.800 --> 02:42:40.920
to say about organized religion and all that but i i have to admire this guy's approach this guy

02:42:40.920 --> 02:42:50.840
gets it in i think a way that a lot of his peers in the church don't so props to you dude best of

02:42:50.840 --> 02:42:56.040
luck i hope it works out for you i think we all want to create a space sometimes for like-minded

02:42:56.040 --> 02:43:03.080
individuals and sometimes that might be like a lgbtq plus and so forth safe space that might be

02:43:03.080 --> 02:43:07.720
a place to talk about religion and so forth you know and as long as you're not kicking other

02:43:07.720 --> 02:43:16.760
people down while you do it go for it so anyway bobby blackwolf and chat now that's funny bobby

02:43:16.760 --> 02:43:21.400
blackwolf and chat with an excellent like troll ish but genuinely funny comment that says is he

02:43:21.400 --> 02:43:28.840
building the bridge with wood or cobblestone minecraft this is about minecraft minecraft joke

02:43:28.840 --> 02:43:35.000
cobblestone it's much more readily available all right let's take the conversation back to satan

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:42.520
uh dark sakura you have a story about a scary thing right me i made might have been scary um

02:43:42.520 --> 02:43:50.600
so there is a uh a series of tweets that were going out trying to get the uh writer and producer

02:43:50.600 --> 02:43:57.000
alana pierce to ask just basically deliver anything about silent hills that's a quote

02:43:57.640 --> 02:44:04.760
that we didn't already know now that it's you know never coming out and so um the post reply

02:44:04.760 --> 02:44:09.480
was i heard that silent hills would require you to sign a waiver before playing because it would

02:44:09.480 --> 02:44:14.760
somehow interact with your real world self like by sending you emails or text messages as characters

02:44:14.760 --> 02:44:23.720
from the game even when you weren't actively playing that is nuts can you imagine and that's

02:44:23.720 --> 02:44:29.880
totally doable in this you know if all you have to do is give that game facebook access

02:44:29.880 --> 02:44:33.880
and it'll pull from your facebook it can pull your phone number and your email and this type

02:44:33.880 --> 02:44:37.240
of stuff and there's going to be people that blindly hit the button and do that

02:44:37.240 --> 02:44:44.760
like remember remember hadeo kachima made that game metal gear solid that did something really

02:44:44.760 --> 02:44:51.880
like psycho twisted when it would read your memory card i see you're a fan of konami games

02:44:51.880 --> 02:44:58.040
exactly and it would like actually it mentioned games like that hadn't come out yet so or just

02:44:58.040 --> 02:45:01.560
you know it would read like sweet koden you have a sense of adventure or things like that like

02:45:01.560 --> 02:45:06.840
you would read the save files that were on your ps1 card sweet koden wasn't out yet yeah something

02:45:06.840 --> 02:45:10.680
and so if you played it after sweet koden came out and it read the save file for it and then

02:45:10.680 --> 02:45:13.800
get your comment but yeah they had a couple games on there that hadn't been out yet yeah

02:45:14.440 --> 02:45:20.520
so uh just i mean so the fact that hadeo kajima potentially if this is to be believed

02:45:20.520 --> 02:45:25.880
kind of was taking that to the next level with like what else do i inadvertently have access to

02:45:25.880 --> 02:45:29.880
in this day and age that i could really scare the shit out of someone with like can you imagine

02:45:30.440 --> 02:45:34.120
you are done with this game like you had to turn the game off because you were too scared

02:45:34.120 --> 02:45:38.040
and then one of the you you fucking get a text message on your phone that pretends to be one

02:45:38.040 --> 02:45:44.600
of the characters in the game i would die like that is that is that's awesome though that is

02:45:44.600 --> 02:45:49.640
like wow what would you think if you were suddenly being texted and harassed by characters

02:45:49.880 --> 02:46:00.120
bitch i'm at work do not disturb that would be me or just reply stop yeah which if you get marketing

02:46:00.120 --> 02:46:05.640
text messages you can reply stop to get removed from them just letting y'all know yeah but the

02:46:05.640 --> 02:46:11.080
the thing is is that you know we know we know kojima is looking to do another as as he says

02:46:11.080 --> 02:46:17.800
the scariest horror game so maybe we're gonna eventually get at least a spiritual sequel to

02:46:17.880 --> 02:46:25.400
the silent hill franchise i think maybe it'll be called like like uh quiet mountain it's just

02:46:25.400 --> 02:46:30.120
it's gonna take all the ideas he had for silent hills and just put them in a new universe i'm sure

02:46:30.120 --> 02:46:35.000
and nova has norman reading it read us in it maybe and his butt if he's available in his butt

02:46:36.440 --> 02:46:40.040
i wonder if he's got a nice butt i wonder if he'll still team up with guillermo del toro

02:46:40.040 --> 02:46:46.120
wow i i want this and i want it to have the fish man in it yeah i just people do need to

02:46:46.120 --> 02:46:54.040
let the silent shape of water i mean honestly if konami wanted to earn a lot of points i don't

02:46:54.040 --> 02:46:59.800
ever see them doing this but i'm just gonna say it they could just let him have the franchise

02:46:59.800 --> 02:47:03.720
and i realize there's been a lot of bad blood between him and konami but a few years has been

02:47:03.720 --> 02:47:07.960
a shit to a few years have passed at this point and konami you notice has been slowly trying to

02:47:07.960 --> 02:47:12.120
turn the wheel in a new direction and get some positive press and i would say if konami wanted

02:47:12.120 --> 02:47:17.880
to get some real positive press then all they would need to do is just say hey look you can

02:47:17.880 --> 02:47:23.320
make you we will license the silent hill to you for a five percent cut a ten percent cut or

02:47:23.320 --> 02:47:27.720
whatever and you can make the game you wanted to make or whatever i think would get a lot of stock

02:47:27.720 --> 02:47:31.560
back in konami but that's to say if kojima even wanted to do it because kojima would have a right

02:47:31.560 --> 02:47:36.440
to say no fuck them and you know make his own thing that had many of the same ideas and that's

02:47:36.440 --> 02:47:41.720
that's he has the right to do that there's a really good video about pt and about the things

02:47:41.720 --> 02:47:47.720
that he was putting references to that when the nda got lifted that make a lot of sense like

02:47:47.720 --> 02:47:52.840
certain numbers that you would see in there or like the commentary of the fetus in the in the

02:47:52.840 --> 02:47:59.320
sink how it was talking about something it goes back to how konami was treating him and you know

02:47:59.320 --> 02:48:03.160
getting pushed out of his positions and whatnot it was a very interesting theory interesting that

02:48:03.160 --> 02:48:09.800
the talking baby was a common theme between those two things baby doesn't talk oh i guess

02:48:10.760 --> 02:48:15.320
he doesn't he doesn't talk does he okay there are all kinds of ghost babies

02:48:16.680 --> 02:48:20.600
all right well moving on just a few more stories for you guys then we'll quickly check in on

02:48:20.600 --> 02:48:26.200
discord and see if anybody wants to call in for tonight um over at uh uh vog network dot com slash

02:48:26.200 --> 02:48:31.400
discord in our green room so there was a rom hack for fire emblem called midnight sun that was in

02:48:31.400 --> 02:48:37.960
development but then canceled uh back in 2017 uh but now the folks that were behind that

02:48:38.440 --> 02:48:45.400
have a new game called path of the midnight sun and it's kind of a spiritual successor to that

02:48:45.400 --> 02:48:52.120
it's now more of like a visual novel but it also has some tactical combat like fire emblem in there

02:48:52.120 --> 02:48:58.440
and they even have some of the same voice actors from the fire emblem series and even pokemon

02:48:58.440 --> 02:49:04.120
that are lending their uh talents to the game itself and if that sounds like something that

02:49:04.120 --> 02:49:08.840
you might be interested in well they have it up on kickstarter now and it's supposed to be

02:49:08.840 --> 02:49:15.400
out by the end of next year on pc mac and the switch so you can go check that out path of the

02:49:15.400 --> 02:49:25.560
midnight sun and it looks interesting definitely um it reminds me a little bit of fire emblem just

02:49:25.560 --> 02:49:31.720
based on the animation and everything but that's always fascinating when um like a mod it kind of

02:49:31.720 --> 02:49:36.440
spins off and becomes its own game because this isn't the first time this has happened hello dota

02:49:36.440 --> 02:49:41.800
right why is there why is there no dota 1 there's only dota 2 because dota 1 was a warcraft 3 mod

02:49:41.800 --> 02:49:47.000
so you know mods do spin off and become games sometimes it's uh and that's that's not all uh

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:51.560
team fortress was originally a quake mod you know a lot of that valve stuff you know they acquired

02:49:51.560 --> 02:49:57.080
big modders and then helped them make their own games so it's kind of neat yep yeah all right

02:49:57.080 --> 02:50:00.120
i'll have to check that out at some point even though i'm not really super into the tactical

02:50:00.200 --> 02:50:07.080
rpgs but i think it's kind of a neat neat thing anyway um i'm sure a lot of you guys have been

02:50:07.080 --> 02:50:12.600
following what's going on in other news and the announcement of the cyber truck did you guys see

02:50:12.600 --> 02:50:18.280
the uh unveiling from elon musk of the cyber truck uh with the the shatterproof windows and all that

02:50:18.280 --> 02:50:24.200
stuff anyway uh a lot of people commented that wow the cyber truck looks like something i would

02:50:24.200 --> 02:50:30.040
have seen like in a 90s uh virtual racing type of game like a low polygon type of game

02:50:30.040 --> 02:50:34.840
and now guess what's happening that car is being hacked into many different video games

02:50:34.840 --> 02:50:40.760
including it's so hard to to recreate the model of the truck golden eye 007 is one of the more

02:50:40.760 --> 02:50:46.280
prominent ones out there where you can actually uh have a mod you know for your golden eye game

02:50:46.280 --> 02:50:50.600
that will put the cyber truck into the game which let's be real that truck does kind of look like

02:50:50.600 --> 02:50:56.200
something out of a james bond film so this one makes the most sense so yeah it does kind of look

02:50:56.200 --> 02:51:01.880
like a um stunt fx or what was hard driving hard driving car from hard drive well i thought you

02:51:01.880 --> 02:51:08.120
know when um yeah when uh jamie was talking about virtual racing i'm like yeah i can see that yeah

02:51:08.120 --> 02:51:14.120
for sure so that's cute that that truck has been hacked into everything and that's uh that's the

02:51:14.120 --> 02:51:19.720
type of thing that modders do for the lulz so there you go all right um we are going to make

02:51:19.720 --> 02:51:25.800
our way to discord so we can try to grab some calls tonight so let's see if we can actually

02:51:25.800 --> 02:51:29.720
uh get that call here because we do have somebody waiting hello you're on orange launch radio who's

02:51:29.720 --> 02:51:36.440
this hey uh this is mel mayhem how's it going hello hello metal mayhem and happy uh black

02:51:36.440 --> 02:51:41.880
friday shopping weekend to you i'm sure you are uh having a great time of it did you know that

02:51:41.880 --> 02:51:48.680
that's also the name of a pinball heavy metal mayhem oh no i wasn't aware of that i thought

02:51:48.680 --> 02:51:52.280
for a second there she was talking about black friday shopping weekend i thought i was like

02:51:52.280 --> 02:51:56.280
there's a black friday pinball machine what i know black hole all right anyway what's that what's on

02:51:56.280 --> 02:52:03.400
your mind tonight buddy oh since you brought it up idly enough it's more or less the topic of my

02:52:03.400 --> 02:52:14.920
you know you know a call in a very broad sense um now um since it's um you know black parties

02:52:14.920 --> 02:52:20.840
you know cyber monday weekend and everyone's on buying guests either from themselves or for

02:52:20.840 --> 02:52:27.880
others or what have you i would like to ask you this um not just during this weekend but

02:52:27.880 --> 02:52:36.600
over the course of 2019 have you bought you know defeat any of you uh but uh bought some

02:52:36.600 --> 02:52:44.040
games for yourselves or for others you know you know during a major sale you know did you

02:52:44.040 --> 02:52:49.560
particularly love they're getting out the game doesn't necessarily have to have to have been uh

02:52:50.360 --> 02:52:57.640
released this year just hit had to be on make uh available during uh during a sale and sure

02:52:57.640 --> 02:53:02.200
sure i get what you're doing with that um what do you guys think is there uh a game that you've

02:53:02.200 --> 02:53:10.040
bought in a sale this year um that you particularly enjoyed and and thought was a good deal um i did

02:53:10.040 --> 02:53:13.480
say i didn't get death stranding on sale i was hoping it would go on sale this weekend but it

02:53:13.480 --> 02:53:20.040
never did i did buy a music sequencer program on steam um because i was watching some how-to videos

02:53:20.040 --> 02:53:26.280
on youtube and it looked pretty um relatively easy to use um and i was i liked that it made chiptune

02:53:26.280 --> 02:53:30.760
songs and things of that nature so i thought it was relatively cheap it was probably like 14 bucks

02:53:30.760 --> 02:53:35.080
for the program and the suit and i'm sorry i forget the name in the moment um if i i haven't

02:53:35.080 --> 02:53:41.240
made anything with it yet so if i do i will let you know what it was called um but um yeah i

02:53:41.320 --> 02:53:43.960
thought that would be fun to toy around with because you know i've been looking for some

02:53:43.960 --> 02:53:49.080
new musical interludes here at olr and um i know jamie has a lead as well but maybe we want to have

02:53:49.880 --> 02:53:53.640
other musical interludes as well so it depends on how difficult it is to use

02:53:53.640 --> 02:53:59.160
um i used to do music stuff many many many many many years ago i don't exactly have a resume i

02:53:59.160 --> 02:54:03.880
was in marching band so i can read sheet music but that's about you know the extent of it but

02:54:03.880 --> 02:54:09.960
um yeah i'll be curious to tinker around with it and see what i can do so um that was one thing

02:54:09.960 --> 02:54:14.680
i picked up this weekend as far as like all year in a sale or anything like that oh i remember i

02:54:14.680 --> 02:54:19.400
know i'll say horizon zero dawn um i picked that up a couple months ago they were having a pretty

02:54:19.400 --> 02:54:24.520
deep sale on playstation and i got the entire collection for like 20 bucks and that was one of

02:54:24.520 --> 02:54:29.160
those series that i wasn't sure if i'd be really into it but um it was a it was a good game i i

02:54:29.160 --> 02:54:34.280
didn't beat it because i never seem to beat games but i sunk plenty hours into it and i enjoyed what

02:54:34.280 --> 02:54:39.160
i played um it's kind of you know that open world action type of thing like breath of the wild tomb

02:54:39.160 --> 02:54:44.040
raider-esque type of thing um yeah i enjoyed that so i would say that was a pleasant surprise i

02:54:44.040 --> 02:54:49.720
picked up a really good deal i think 20 bucks for that whole package was really good anything that

02:54:49.720 --> 02:54:55.240
comes to mind for you guys not really i didn't buy anything this sale um the last game i bought

02:54:55.240 --> 02:55:03.080
was black future 88 and still haven't gone around to playing it yet um by the way horizon zero dawn

02:55:03.080 --> 02:55:07.160
is now down to fifteen dollars on this black friday sale so i mean if you're looking for

02:55:07.160 --> 02:55:11.560
something on playstation 4 uh it's a pretty good one you don't want to pass up although

02:55:11.560 --> 02:55:15.720
imagine if you wait long enough it's going to be a playstation plus game but well i want to say i

02:55:15.720 --> 02:55:22.360
think super beat zonic was 99 cents at one time oh it was and then i picked that up so that's a

02:55:22.360 --> 02:55:29.480
pretty good deal still haven't played it because i don't really get access to my switch anymore but

02:55:29.480 --> 02:55:40.440
um yeah that's really it i buy a lot of weird stuff i buy a lot of um courses in udemy i was

02:55:40.440 --> 02:55:46.280
disappointed that some of the expansion music for dj max uh respect weren't on sale because

02:55:46.280 --> 02:55:50.200
i didn't realize that game was still doing expansions because they recently did a crossover

02:55:50.200 --> 02:55:54.040
with groove coaster and i was interested in picking it up but the music the music expansions

02:55:54.040 --> 02:55:59.240
in that game are pretty pricey and also just on a random tangent i saw a news article that dj

02:55:59.240 --> 02:56:04.200
max respect is apparently coming to pc later this year um which is exciting but at the same time i'm

02:56:04.200 --> 02:56:07.720
like that's going to be too much money they're going to want way too much money for it so i

02:56:07.720 --> 02:56:12.360
hope they charge the right price for it so we'll see oh yeah pixel pocket says is it really rob

02:56:12.360 --> 02:56:16.520
yeah i saw i saw a news article on that just a few days ago they just announced it like maybe

02:56:16.520 --> 02:56:21.000
six days ago or something that there's going to be a dj max respect on pc if you look up if you um

02:56:22.360 --> 02:56:27.160
excuse me if you go to like news.google where you can search for news trends just look for dj max it

02:56:27.160 --> 02:56:30.280
should be one of the top stories that comes up so you can read they haven't said a lot about it

02:56:30.280 --> 02:56:35.320
like we don't uh it's steam it's gonna be on steam that's all we know um but there's no page on steam

02:56:35.320 --> 02:56:40.280
for it yet or anything like that so uh we're getting some answers from our chat uh quest

02:56:40.280 --> 02:56:45.640
buster says valkyrie chronicles 4 for the ps4 is just 20 bucks really fun strategy game so there

02:56:45.640 --> 02:56:50.440
you go um uh dark soccer anything that comes to mind for you i don't know if there's been any

02:56:50.440 --> 02:56:57.080
fun deals that you've jumped in on not really yeah i mean i um i've just been basically grabbing

02:56:57.560 --> 02:57:04.280
stuff and waiting for detroit to come out oh yeah better than that like i don't have any real games

02:57:04.280 --> 02:57:10.040
coming out that i want to play until animal crossing okay so i'm not i haven't really been

02:57:10.040 --> 02:57:14.920
deal hunting i've more been looking on the practical side of of gifts all right uh anything

02:57:14.920 --> 02:57:21.240
else you have for us tonight middle man no they'll be it uh i'll try to clear up the line because i

02:57:21.240 --> 02:57:27.400
can see two other people don't want to call in yeah yeah you too thanks so much for the call

02:57:27.400 --> 02:57:31.960
yeah i definitely want to squeeze some other calls in but thank you buddy take care all right let's

02:57:31.960 --> 02:57:37.000
get to some more calls here i'll go to this one next hi you're on orange launch radio who's this

02:57:38.760 --> 02:57:47.000
hi it's yyr hello my friend yyr how are you oh pretty good how you doing i am great what's on

02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:51.080
your mind tonight i'm trying to get you in the next caller in here so we can wrap up so not to

02:57:51.480 --> 02:57:57.880
but maybe a little what's up no i uh i won't take up too much of your time i just uh first off want

02:57:57.880 --> 02:58:05.000
to say you know congrats on 800 etc etc appreciate that my friend if you guys still have fun doing

02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:12.200
this in a little over two years we'll be back to say congrats on 900 but uh i digress uh i did want

02:58:12.200 --> 02:58:19.560
to mention something uh follow up to robert m's email earlier about uh you know the mac os support

02:58:19.560 --> 02:58:27.640
basically what's happened is uh apple is trying to raise the security of mac os uh i'm not sure

02:58:27.640 --> 02:58:33.080
if it's just because they want to protect their users from any and all uh avenues that malware

02:58:33.080 --> 02:58:40.840
could get in or if they're just looking at iphone and ipad and saying well we get a a 30 cut of

02:58:40.840 --> 02:58:49.240
everything they sell on there why not mac os too but for whatever reason they have a new thing

02:58:49.240 --> 02:58:58.600
called notarization and starting uh with this new version of mac os that came out recently in

02:58:58.600 --> 02:59:08.120
october uh all new apps have to be notarized uh which is a process you have to do directly with

02:59:08.120 --> 02:59:18.680
apple otherwise they will not run now the thing is they temporarily relaxed these restrictions until

02:59:18.680 --> 02:59:25.880
this coming january and one thing we noticed is that you know developing a mac game and running

02:59:25.880 --> 02:59:32.920
it through steam it doesn't seem to go through some of the restrictive checks that other you know

02:59:32.920 --> 02:59:40.840
applications do like if you had just distributed it say on your website uh so for all i know in

02:59:40.840 --> 02:59:46.040
january my two games are going to stop working if you have the latest version of the operating

02:59:46.040 --> 02:59:53.720
system i have no idea apple isn't saying anything valve has no clue either so i uh

02:59:53.720 --> 02:59:59.800
yes yes i know how to notarize i see dark sakura put the link in chat but here's the kicker if you

02:59:59.800 --> 03:00:05.800
want to be able to notarize your app you have to have an active developer account with apple which

03:00:05.800 --> 03:00:16.520
means 99 a year yeah i i can tell you right now there is no uh i i am not making 99 a year on my

03:00:16.520 --> 03:00:21.960
mac stuff you have a you have a baby to consider in that stuff so you gotta you know all those

03:00:21.960 --> 03:00:29.080
costs uh certainly add up um well there are a lot of mass developers who are just not happy about

03:00:29.080 --> 03:00:34.360
this for what it's worth the show computer is running catalina so i'm happy to test for you on

03:00:34.360 --> 03:00:40.520
january 1st what happens um for what it's worth um but what's interesting is that um i think we've

03:00:40.520 --> 03:00:46.920
run into a similar error i'm not sure if it has to do with security but like obs has some issues

03:00:46.920 --> 03:00:51.960
i have to launch it from terminal in order to be able to get it to work um there still is not a

03:00:51.960 --> 03:00:59.640
workaround on obs's front so um i don't know what is going on um so thank you for some of that

03:00:59.640 --> 03:01:04.360
insight i mean i can you know i can certainly get where you know apple has a reputation of

03:01:04.360 --> 03:01:09.880
being a safe platform where um pcs are usually the ones that get targeted by like viruses trojans

03:01:09.880 --> 03:01:14.360
etc and so forth so um you know apple wants to kind of protect that because i think we've been

03:01:14.360 --> 03:01:19.080
hearing in the past year we hear of it happening a little more on the mac platform still not yeah

03:01:19.080 --> 03:01:23.880
you know the same ratios pc we've been hearing about it more so i think apple may have kind of

03:01:23.880 --> 03:01:29.400
really clamped down on that in an effort to stay kind of that pristine clean little platform that

03:01:29.400 --> 03:01:33.160
it is but unfortunately some more of this independent stuff is getting a little bit

03:01:33.160 --> 03:01:39.640
left out in the cold as a result so um fingers crossed that it'll work i'm messaging you on

03:01:39.640 --> 03:01:47.160
facebook about something so uh okay i'll make sure to log into facebook then okay yeah yeah

03:01:47.160 --> 03:01:52.360
that's why she's gonna tell you all right but yeah i'm uh you're gonna see probably over the

03:01:52.360 --> 03:01:58.120
next few months a lot of independent developers drop support for mac unfortunately uh simply

03:01:58.120 --> 03:02:03.160
because you know they don't want to have to maintain an active subscription but i could be

03:02:03.160 --> 03:02:07.880
wrong but we'll see yeah we'll see what happens it'll be interesting to see uh what develops but

03:02:07.880 --> 03:02:13.160
i did not realize january was as soon as that was happening so that's less than a month away so

03:02:13.160 --> 03:02:17.880
could be interesting and i don't know if it's january 1st january 30th nobody's saying anything

03:02:17.880 --> 03:02:22.040
so we'll just figure it out all right we'll keep an eye on it well thank you for the follow-up

03:02:22.040 --> 03:02:27.000
yyr and appreciate again everything you've done for you you've literally made our dreams come

03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:31.640
true over the years um so we just want you to know how much you're appreciated and you're a

03:02:31.640 --> 03:02:35.880
big part of how we got this far so thank you so much my friend i don't know if i would have gotten

03:02:35.880 --> 03:02:40.680
this far without you guys either so thanks for that and uh have a great week we help each other

03:02:40.680 --> 03:02:46.120
out take care my friend bye-bye see you later all right let's try to get one more call here before

03:02:46.120 --> 03:02:50.360
we call it a night uh hi you're on orange long training who's this hey what's going on everybody

03:02:50.360 --> 03:02:54.360
it is ron it is good to hear from you rama but i'm going to have us keep it quick tonight what's

03:02:54.360 --> 03:03:02.440
on your mind first off i want to say happy 800. thank you my friend um to also touch back on

03:03:02.440 --> 03:03:09.000
reference to jimmy fallon i can say i have seen some of the tech that they talk about on the show

03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:17.560
that's the most i can release it okay meaning you know something bringing like newer tech and gaming

03:03:17.560 --> 03:03:22.520
and so forth let's just say i've been in areas where you know they put stuff that they had on

03:03:22.520 --> 03:03:29.640
the show up in store i've seen some of it so yeah all right good to know you probably have

03:03:29.640 --> 03:03:35.880
observed a lot of interesting things over the year but we'll leave it at that cool and lastly i have

03:03:35.880 --> 03:03:43.880
a switch i'm sorry say that again mr smoosh was trying to be heard over you i have a switch oh

03:03:43.880 --> 03:03:47.960
congratulations of course yes because i got the friend request on the switch and of course you

03:03:47.960 --> 03:03:53.960
picked luigi as your icon thank you um so um yeah congratulations what are you playing on it

03:03:54.680 --> 03:04:02.760
right now mario kart 8 i picked up um starlink because it was like 10 bucks and i also picked up

03:04:02.760 --> 03:04:07.720
a collection of mon those are some really good choices because you have a little bit of old

03:04:07.720 --> 03:04:12.120
school you have a little bit of deep discounts you have some new school in there as well and i

03:04:12.120 --> 03:04:17.000
also i also picked up links awakening i forgot yeah uh did anything in particular finally sway

03:04:17.080 --> 03:04:21.480
you into the switch like now was it the free game of mario kart that finally got you in or what

03:04:21.480 --> 03:04:28.520
what swayed you from e3 seeing a collection of mana because one of the games uh secret of mana

03:04:28.520 --> 03:04:33.160
got me through a real rough time in my teenage years which is part of the reason why i picked

03:04:33.160 --> 03:04:38.600
up a snest classic but this along with links awakening which was one of my personal favorite

03:04:38.600 --> 03:04:44.680
zelda games so i'm just like god damn it nintendo here's my money have you touched trials of mana

03:04:44.680 --> 03:04:51.400
or second sense of three yet i have not be sure to get in on that i was uh very pleasantly

03:04:51.400 --> 03:04:55.640
surprised with that i need again on my list of games i need to finish but i did it i did

03:04:55.640 --> 03:04:59.880
a pretty good decent amount of streaming like probably good four or five hours into that game

03:04:59.880 --> 03:05:03.800
and uh it was great i had a good time i'm looking forward to a little redo i hope they learn some

03:05:03.800 --> 03:05:09.080
things from the secret of mana redo same here but unfortunately i can't play the game i can't

03:05:09.080 --> 03:05:12.920
play my switch as much because when i was coming back from mako channels i accidentally left my

03:05:12.920 --> 03:05:18.840
charger behind oh no well the good news is it's a universal like for once nintendo is using like

03:05:18.840 --> 03:05:24.520
universal stuff so as long as you have like a usb-c cable i think it is um you can charge it

03:05:24.520 --> 03:05:31.400
with like anything so um you should say that because i'm doing that right now and according

03:05:31.400 --> 03:05:36.920
to my switch it's not enough power so i think i have to go out and get another adapter so we

03:05:36.920 --> 03:05:41.240
will see damn well best of luck to you i hope uh you're able to find the magic thing that gets a

03:05:41.240 --> 03:05:44.520
chart yeah it probably needs to put out a certain amount of voltage that maybe whatever you're using

03:05:44.520 --> 03:05:49.640
isn't doing but then again i also picked up another tablet while i got myself the certain

03:05:49.640 --> 03:05:55.560
8 gig surface go which has a surface charger it also charges my usb-c so i do have to pick up

03:05:55.560 --> 03:05:59.880
another charger so well there you go so maybe maybe that'll work so just make sure it's a

03:05:59.880 --> 03:06:02.680
yeah if you're trying to do it like through a computer or through a plate it probably won't

03:06:02.680 --> 03:06:07.080
be enough juice to enough voltage to do it but i bet if you get a pretty decent brick

03:06:07.080 --> 03:06:10.280
um that can really pump some voltage through it i bet it'll i bet it'll work

03:06:11.480 --> 03:06:15.960
that's what i'm thinking so you know for the time being i'm just letting it be until mocotron

03:06:15.960 --> 03:06:22.040
ships it to me you know so i can because i am enjoying it i i can see the difference between

03:06:22.040 --> 03:06:27.880
playing on a small screen and a large screen which i enjoy but since i'm kind of disappointed so

03:06:27.880 --> 03:06:32.680
oh bobby also with an excellent suggestion suggesting a bypass the dock the dock is

03:06:32.680 --> 03:06:38.120
going to require a higher voltage than just the system itself so uh if you plug directly

03:06:38.120 --> 03:06:40.840
into the system you might be able to get away with it on whatever you're using now

03:06:41.560 --> 03:06:45.400
yeah but you know but i will have to use the regular charger so i can actually play it on

03:06:45.400 --> 03:06:49.880
the tv so of course understandable all right my friend i'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up but

03:06:49.880 --> 03:06:53.880
thank you so much for the call hey no problem y'all take care stay awesome take care my friend

03:06:53.880 --> 03:07:01.160
bye all right so i think with that we're through everything in the uh discord channel so thank you

03:07:01.160 --> 03:07:05.000
lots of calls tonight thank you so much for that uh we do want to start to move to wrap up here

03:07:05.000 --> 03:07:08.520
though since this is close to 9 30. i do have to ask if there's any last minute stories just

03:07:08.520 --> 03:07:12.520
yeah i don't want to leave anything out all right yes i have a couple things so the first one being

03:07:12.520 --> 03:07:21.480
that um the company beat games who as the developer of beat saber i think this news broke

03:07:21.480 --> 03:07:26.920
during the show last week i feel like but maybe maybe not i thought it was a thing that broke

03:07:26.920 --> 03:07:31.240
during the show but go ahead they were acquired by facebook yeah so now if you want to get that

03:07:31.240 --> 03:07:36.520
beat saber action you're gonna have to do it on through oculus i guess well well they're gonna

03:07:36.520 --> 03:07:40.040
no because i remember talking about they're gonna continue to support all the platforms that are

03:07:40.040 --> 03:07:45.400
out there now so they're not gonna like pull it from whatever yeah but if there's a beat saber 2

03:07:45.400 --> 03:07:49.320
or you know who knows but you know minecraft is a microsoft product and they still

03:07:50.120 --> 03:07:55.880
runs great on nintendo there's still a playstation 4 version yeah but microsoft versus facebook

03:07:57.880 --> 03:08:03.800
fair i'm not the biggest facebook fan but let's let's wait until something actually happens before

03:08:03.800 --> 03:08:09.000
we say doomsday and then in acquisition news as well we have slightly mad studios uh the

03:08:09.000 --> 03:08:14.680
developers project car is being acquired by code masters which you know code masters has a lot of

03:08:14.680 --> 03:08:20.280
their own uh driving franchises so like i said it kind of makes sense yeah that's it money money

03:08:20.280 --> 03:08:25.640
money all right so that's it for last minute stories so it brings our show just about to a

03:08:25.640 --> 03:08:30.280
close uh we're gonna go around and get everybody's final thoughts but again here on this 800th

03:08:30.280 --> 03:08:34.440
episode of our show just want to thank you guys for being here whether it's live whether it's on

03:08:34.440 --> 03:08:39.240
the podcast you know you guys really make up this show and keep us going um so i really can't thank

03:08:39.240 --> 03:08:44.280
you enough thank you for your participation and uh you know it's funny because why we are set on

03:08:44.280 --> 03:08:48.760
that call if we do this for two more years we'll be celebrating 900 and i'm thinking in the back

03:08:48.760 --> 03:08:54.040
of my head if we do it for four more years we'll get to a thousand we should do it wouldn't that

03:08:54.040 --> 03:08:59.400
be something we'll try Guinness we'll try yeah hey Guinness do the thing and then you know what

03:08:59.400 --> 03:09:04.760
if we get to a thousand i'll fucking call Guinness but i'll do it before that well here's the thing

03:09:04.760 --> 03:09:10.520
there's other shows that have hit a thousand episodes but they do more than one a week like

03:09:10.520 --> 03:09:15.000
i can think of a couple podcasts that like during e3 week they'll release like 20 episodes we've

03:09:15.000 --> 03:09:21.640
been around longer than everybody that is still yeah that's still going regularly weekly yes i

03:09:21.640 --> 03:09:28.760
think there is a show that did something then stopped for a long time then came back

03:09:29.320 --> 03:09:34.120
but i shouldn't count it yeah i'm not counting that we're the longest continuously weekly show

03:09:34.120 --> 03:09:43.000
without a major break so all right anyhow yeah uh dark diseases 2022 is 20 years yeah that would be

03:09:43.880 --> 03:09:48.040
that be yeah that'd be about three years i mean it doesn't line up you would think oh there's

03:09:48.040 --> 03:09:53.240
about 50 give or take weeks in a year shouldn't you be on episode it would be what like 850 by

03:09:53.240 --> 03:09:57.800
now but just you know shit happens like we miss two weeks here and there we go on vacation things

03:09:57.800 --> 03:10:03.240
happen you know so we don't but most of your shows out there like you know if you're watching things

03:10:03.240 --> 03:10:08.680
on netflix what you get like 10 episodes of stranger things a year uh and even regular series

03:10:08.680 --> 03:10:13.400
shows you get what like 26 episodes maybe yeah i might have to wait until 2020 for the end of

03:10:14.040 --> 03:10:19.560
um the good place damn it oh oh did they go on a break i i'm still time to catch up on season

03:10:19.560 --> 03:10:25.960
three i'm really behind oh you're on season three oh so swung tong says vgn is just this

03:10:25.960 --> 03:10:31.560
long-running issue but they all go on hiatus a lot no disrespect to those hard-working fellows

03:10:31.560 --> 03:10:37.560
over there but um as you pointed out they do go on hiatus a lot so um i think they went like a year

03:10:37.560 --> 03:10:45.000
at least uh with a break um also we did start on life 365 just before i think they got started

03:10:45.000 --> 03:10:51.720
in 03 or 04 uh our first episode was june of 2002 again i mean no disrespect um and i think

03:10:51.720 --> 03:10:55.960
everything that they've accomplished should be celebrated as well it is not easy to keep your

03:10:55.960 --> 03:11:04.360
show going one year let alone 17 so anyway um bobby blackwell says they claim to be the oldest

03:11:04.360 --> 03:11:10.280
video game podcast well unfortunately um that is i want to see the receipts show me an episode

03:11:10.280 --> 03:11:15.720
that you did before june of 2002 that was branded that same way because i don't think it exists

03:11:15.720 --> 03:11:22.760
sorry and again even if it did as been pointing out there's been been a lot of long breaks so

03:11:23.320 --> 03:11:29.000
all right and also sorry again i'm gonna sound like i'm being rude and i'm really not but i do

03:11:29.000 --> 03:11:33.960
believe at one point the name of that show has changed because they weren't about video games

03:11:33.960 --> 03:11:42.440
for a while um so just kind of just have to say that sorry anyway um let's see did i get final

03:11:42.440 --> 03:11:45.960
thoughts no i was i was ramping up and saying thanks for all that stuff and all that good stuff

03:11:45.960 --> 03:11:50.680
so let's go around and get everybody's final thought um dark soccer we'll start with you i

03:11:50.680 --> 03:11:54.360
know you've been under the weather and and not feeling it as the show's been going on so thanks

03:11:54.360 --> 03:11:59.720

03:12:11.560 --> 03:12:16.280
fall into a coma and do nothing but sleep and eat soup i hope they're still open they're up until

03:12:16.280 --> 03:12:20.920
