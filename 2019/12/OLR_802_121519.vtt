00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:21.000
This week, the ninth generation is as new as it is old because Sony keeps the streak alive and Microsoft continues down a strange path of naming continuity.

00:21.000 --> 00:28.000
What, you expected a different headline? Well, stay tuned for tonight's Stories of Plenty starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice.

00:28.000 --> 00:33.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:33.000 --> 00:40.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.000
Live tonight with episode number 802 for this December the 15th of 2019.

00:46.000 --> 00:53.000
My name is Rob Roberts and together with my co-hosts DarkSakura and TechMasterLoki

00:53.000 --> 01:00.000
It's me eating on stream. It's fine. The good news is on the podcast they can't see it. We're celebrating one year here on Twitch.

01:00.000 --> 01:05.000
So we've actually been doing this video thing for one year. I mean technically it's tomorrow but close enough.

01:05.000 --> 01:13.000
By the time it comes out. Yeah, by the time the podcast is out it'll have been a year that we've moved over from...

01:13.000 --> 01:21.000
I can't remember the name. I was about to say Live 365. It's been one whole year since we moved from Live 365. Can you believe it?

01:21.000 --> 01:27.000
Are they still around? No, they finally closed for good. I think it was about 2013, 2014. So yeah.

01:27.000 --> 01:36.000
Pour one out because we can make fun of them all we want. I'd rather drink it. This show wouldn't exist if that whole era hadn't happened.

01:36.000 --> 01:41.000
So pour one out. Betty 365 wherever you're at. Hope you have a great job wherever you're at now.

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000
Anyway, hello to all of you out in Twitch land and of course in podcast land.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern at the Voice of Geeks Network.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
Twitch.tv slash VOG Network. V-O-G Network. Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show again.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
6 Pacific, 9 Eastern every Sunday night. And you can watch us here on the video.

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
Or if you're a subscriber over at Twitch.tv slash VOG Network you can watch the video part on demand.

02:04.000 --> 02:12.000
But of course our podcast free as it has been for over 17 years. Can you believe?

02:12.000 --> 02:19.000
It's free because I still get the hiccups live on air and so that quality until I have a cure for hiccups I don't know what I'm going to do with that.

02:19.000 --> 02:25.000
I might not be able to continue being free if we're going to fulfill all these user requests like smush muppet must happen.

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
We don't have the budget for a smush muppet.

02:27.000 --> 02:34.000
We do have the budget for a smush emote and that is something that is coming for the tier 2 subscribers in the near future.

02:34.000 --> 02:41.000
I keep forgetting to load that in the hopper but that is something I think that we were going to do to celebrate around the one year on Twitch or in 2020.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
That will be something coming.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.000
I can make a smush muppet but I could but I would not.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
Why not? Muppets are fun. Muppets are hilarious.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Time. Cosplay.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
There's other things we have to work on.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Working on logo.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
We're talking about some refreshing and stuff behind the scenes like a new logo.

03:01.000 --> 03:07.000
Potentially that whole shirt store sales stuff and getting that going for you guys that want to buy some merchandise.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
Want to wear O.L.R. on your back without having to get a tattoo.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
That would be awesome.

03:13.000 --> 03:18.000
I can wear O.L.R. on my back without a tattoo but I had that thing made like 15 years ago.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
Oh yeah that's right. Oh god I forgot about that shirt.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
Now it actually fits me.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.000
You made an old shirt for a DDR tournament or something.

03:25.000 --> 03:32.000
It was when Chris and I, one of our O.L.R. lesbians, went to...

03:33.000 --> 03:38.000
We were in Los Angeles I think. We were somewhere and we decided to have O.L.R. shirts made or something.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
And so I still have my red and black O.L.R. shirt.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
This is Dark Sakura Zero.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
Oh yeah yeah. Those are fun. Those are great.

03:44.000 --> 03:48.000
Anyway. Fifth Dream today in chat says, shit I just got the tattoo.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
Well I mean that's cool.

03:50.000 --> 03:53.000
I'm actually thinking about getting a tat- it's not going to be orange on straight I'm sorry to say.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
But actually I'll say this because it is something...

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
It will actually be a piece of this show is what I'm looking to get tattooed on myself.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
So as you guys know I...

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
It's going to be a poop. A pixel poop.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.000
No it's not going to be a pixel poop.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
As you guys know I lost my mom in 2017 and when that happened I knew that I wanted...

04:10.000 --> 04:13.000
If I got a tattoo I wanted it to be something with my mom.

04:13.000 --> 04:21.000
Well luckily since this show has that rich 17 year old history there's clips of my mom on this show in older episodes of this show.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Like we would call her on Mother's Day.

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
There was the infamous clip that everybody really loved when she was reviewing Mortal Kombat for the first time.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.000
So what I'm actually going to be tattooing is I'm going to get a sound wave of her.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
So it's a sound wave of my mom basically.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
It needs to be Rob!

04:37.000 --> 04:40.000
I haven't decided what the quote is going to be yet.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
I have to go through what my options are from this show.

04:42.000 --> 04:46.000
But the nice thing is I mean if it wasn't for this show I wouldn't have that.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
So I guess maybe...

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
We have my mom too don't we?

04:50.000 --> 04:54.000
We do somewhere. Now I couldn't tell you what episode but I know she was on this at one point.

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
I'm just going to tell my mom that we're going to call her and harass her one day.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Yeah I think it was a Mother's Day at some point.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
I think we called my mom.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
We called Loki's family one year I seem to remember that was the thing.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
Yeah so we've done it for everybody.

05:08.000 --> 05:14.000
Yeah I didn't mean to get all deep here but since it is the one year anniversary on Twitch and we're talking about tattoos I guess that's something.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
Now I'm going to have to go get it soon because I keep talking about it.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Now I need to go do it.

05:19.000 --> 05:25.000
But at the same time I'm thinking about getting it in a place where I'd have to take my shirt off to show you.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
And I can't do that on Twitch.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
What about forearm?

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
I don't want to get it on my forearm.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
I'm probably going to get it either on my back.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
I'm actually thinking I'm considering this one.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
Even though I know that's very very visible.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
But it's my mom so why shouldn't it be?

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
It's not appropriate to get it as a tramp stamp.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
No I'm not going to get tramp stamps.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
It's not going to be on my ass.

05:47.000 --> 05:52.000
If there's not a lot of muscle or fatty tissue it's going to hurt a lot.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
And that is why I don't get tattoos.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Because I'm a baby.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
Now I want my tattoo of Loki saying, I'm a baby.

06:03.000 --> 06:07.000
Anyway, I have thought about the back of the leg for that reason.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Can you tattoo it on my fat?

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
I'm actually thinking of having my first stone on the back of my neck.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
Oh yeah?

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
I'll hop up on camera.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Okay.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Right here.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
Oh yeah.

06:18.000 --> 06:23.000
I have designed my own logo back when I was doing design work regularly.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
And I was thinking about having my cherry blossom.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Oh.

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
Alan's thinking about getting a tattoo as well.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
We should all just go get tattoos together.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
Wouldn't that be fun?

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Let's get a butt.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
On a butt.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
Yes that sounds incredibly terrifying.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
I want my tattoo to be a destination tattoo actually.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
Because I have friends that could do it here locally which is great.

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
But I want it to be something where like I went on a trip and I got this done.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
And so this isn't just about that.

06:46.000 --> 06:50.000
It's about my memory of Insert City here where I go to get it done.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.000
Well you know Nikki, my friend.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Gary's sister.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
She knows places in San Francisco I might go get my little thing done.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.000
It shouldn't be a very expensive or very big one.

07:03.000 --> 07:09.000
But I became actually pretty okay with needles after I had to start injecting myself.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.000
It's just B12 so I wasn't like doing heroin or anything.

07:12.000 --> 07:20.000
But I sort of lost my fear of needles after having to do sub-q B12 injections in my leg.

07:20.000 --> 07:23.000
Which funny, it freaked Dan out one time.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
Because it's red. This stuff is red.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.000
And so it had shot back out of my leg when I pulled the needle out too quickly.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
And he's like oh my god you're bleeding.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
I'm like no.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
Nope.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
That's a nope.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Alright.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
You are a baby.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Let me get some comments and chat.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
And then I want to talk about the holidays a little bit.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
And we will get into video games I promise. It was a busy week.

07:41.000 --> 07:47.000
Akuma JP in chat says Rob if you're considering going to hot springs here, don't get in a place that's too obvious.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
Are tattoos frowned on in Japanese culture?

07:49.000 --> 07:55.000
There are some onsen that will have a tattoo prohibited.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
I'm not jumping in the bath with all the naked old dudes.

07:58.000 --> 08:03.000
So for example, it's like you can't have a full on sleeve.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.000
But you could have something discreet somewhere.

08:07.000 --> 08:12.000
It's just tattoos have a little bit more of a different social connotation.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
And I mean I don't know if it's generic of me to say so.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.000
But from everyone I've talked to it has to do back to Yakuza.

08:18.000 --> 08:22.000
There's some folks in chat talking about that.

08:22.000 --> 08:26.000
But I'm not in a hurry to jump in the bath with the old dudes.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
So I think I'll be alright.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
In Japan there will be a lot of other things I want to do.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
I am planning when I eventually take my trip of going to Kyoto.

08:35.000 --> 08:38.000
Because again I want to look at pretty kimono fabric.

08:38.000 --> 08:44.000
Go to Kabuki and basically stalk Gekko and Maiko the whole time I'm there.

08:44.000 --> 08:50.000
And then I want to go up to Sapporo and go to the onsen up there and see a fighter's game.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Fun.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Baseball.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Alright.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
I'm trying to think.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.000
I don't know.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.000
I definitely want to do more world travel.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
This next year though is the cruise.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.000
Because you know I'm going with the crew from Starboard Power Coupling.

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
Which I know they've been on a hiatus here at VOG Network.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.000
Because there has been a lot of new Trek to talk about.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
But I imagine they're going to pick up very soon with Picard coming out.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
But I'm going on the Star Trek cruise with them.

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
And that's going to be international.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
So who's guesting on there?

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
Do they have any special guests?

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Oh from Trek?

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
Oh absolutely.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
We have photos scheduled with Kate Mulgrew.

09:24.000 --> 09:28.000
We have Dr. Crusher, Gates McFadden.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.000
We have...

09:29.000 --> 09:32.000
Why do I keep wanting to say Marisa Tomei?

09:32.000 --> 09:33.000
That's not...

09:33.000 --> 09:34.000
Troy.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.000
Why am I Marisa Tomei?

09:37.000 --> 09:38.000
Ah!

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
We're going to get Troy.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.000
And then let's see we also have pictures scheduled.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.000
Wilson Cruz.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.000
Awesome.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
I wanted to get a picture.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.000
So we have a few of those things scheduled.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
And yeah it'll be fun.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
So I'm really looking forward to the cruise.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
We're going to have a good time.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
Marisa Tomei should be in Star Trek actually.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Marina Sirtis.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
Yeah I know.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
I don't know why.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.000
Her husband died.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Yeah it's really...

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
Trek had a really bad week a couple weeks ago.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.000
They had a lot of passings and so forth.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
Let's move on to a happier note.

10:04.000 --> 10:08.000
Bobby Black Wolf says I'm jealous I'd rather be on the cruise with you and Grandpa.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
Aw well I mean there's a...

10:09.000 --> 10:14.000
I already know Grandpa's going to try to talk me into 2021 Star Trek cruise.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.000
But I'm like it's a lot of money and time.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.000
And so it's kind of like I would like to get more international travel in.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
I don't know if I want to do the cruise back to back.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
I might do it like odd number or even numbered years.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Having watched some of the videos online I would love to do a Disney cruise.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
I just wouldn't love to pay for a Disney cruise.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
I know why I wouldn't want to do a cruise.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Children.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.000
Well that's exactly why I'd do the cruise is children.

10:38.000 --> 10:44.000
You shove them off to be watched by other people that are paid to watch them and then you go have fun.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
I want to go on an adult only cruise.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
I believe...

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
I would like to go on an adult only cruise too.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
That has nothing to do with Nookie.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.000
I believe the Star Trek cruise is 21 and up.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Or 18 and up.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
18 and up.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
There are no...

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
Because I remember it was a controversy thing on Facebook.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
Some people want to bring their kids.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.000
Don't quote me on that you guys.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
But I seem to remember eating something where like kids are not going to be there.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
So I did have a dream about a cruise.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
I dreamt that it was a cruise hosted by Gordon Ramsay.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
Okay.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Sounds awesome.

11:14.000 --> 11:19.000
And that I won like some lottery where I had to like learn how to cook from him.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.000
You know what we need to do?

11:20.000 --> 11:22.000
I don't know when this is supposed to open.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
But we need to go up to Tahoe and go to the Hell's Kitchen restaurant.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
We're putting in a Hell's Kitchen restaurant up there.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Do it.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.000
Yeah.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
We need to do it.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.000
When I went to the one in Vegas, you know I got the beef Wellington.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Beef Wellington is among my favorite dishes.

11:34.000 --> 11:40.000
I'm actually planning on, once I perfect my puff paste, I am going to do a beef Wellington.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
All right.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
Or getting the filet is going to be nuts.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
I've done a beef Wellington.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
Can we talk about video games?

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Sure.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Sure.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
But food is great.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.000
Should we talk about these presents?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Yeah.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
Okay.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
The presents.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
Festive holiday presents from Dark Sakura.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
You want to open yours first, Loki?

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Yes.

11:56.000 --> 12:00.000
Let me move the food off of my laptop so that I don't spill it on the floor.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
Okay.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.520
So I kind of went all out because we just paid off a shitload of bills and Dan's mad

12:04.520 --> 12:06.280
at me, but I don't care.

12:06.280 --> 12:10.000
So I didn't like go like super crazy, but I went crazy enough.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Let's go crazy.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.000
All right.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.000
So Loki's, for the folks on podcast, Loki is opening the gift to see what's inside.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Oh, my nose is on air.

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
Looks like a fabric, maybe a t-shirt, I think is what we're looking at here.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
There's a few things in there.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
We're doing one at a time.

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
And see, I'm knocking stuff on the ground.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
See, already.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
So yes.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
So this is...

12:29.000 --> 12:30.000
Is it like a cyberpunk shirt?

12:30.000 --> 12:35.520
No, it's even better than that because I see laser tag on here.

12:35.520 --> 12:37.520
Oh, it's a laser tag shirt.

12:37.520 --> 12:38.520
Okay.

12:38.520 --> 12:39.520
Awesome.

12:39.520 --> 12:41.520
It's laser tag kitten two.

12:41.520 --> 12:44.200
That's sweet.

12:44.200 --> 12:48.060
There's a story behind me fighting this shirt, by the way, because I was trying to order

12:48.060 --> 12:50.640
a shirt from Cuzar.

12:50.640 --> 12:52.640
Which doesn't really exist anymore.

12:52.640 --> 12:56.600
There are producers of Cuzar shirts, but they want more than the cost of the shirt to ship

12:56.600 --> 12:57.600
it.

12:57.600 --> 12:59.480
And the shirt was actually pretty crazy.

12:59.480 --> 13:02.640
So I was like, eh, birthday presents.

13:02.640 --> 13:14.000
Yeah, thankfully I do have a Cuzar shirt from when I did actual league games there.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.640
So I have one that still fits me, which is great.

13:16.640 --> 13:17.640
Awesome.

13:17.640 --> 13:18.640
Let's see here.

13:18.640 --> 13:21.160
So I got an Xbox gift card.

13:21.160 --> 13:22.160
Wow.

13:22.680 --> 13:26.960
I've got Pocky, which I honestly have never had Pocky before.

13:26.960 --> 13:27.960
Really?

13:27.960 --> 13:28.960
Really?

13:28.960 --> 13:29.960
And that is a super good flavor of Pocky.

13:29.960 --> 13:31.640
It's like one of the seasonal deluxe ones.

13:31.640 --> 13:32.640
And no Rocky?

13:32.640 --> 13:34.640
Pocky and Rocky.

13:34.640 --> 13:37.280
And then we've got Kiki Kai Kai.

13:37.280 --> 13:38.280
I've got...

13:38.280 --> 13:39.280
Kiki Kai Kai.

13:39.280 --> 13:41.280
Looks like Super Mario socks.

13:41.280 --> 13:42.280
What is this?

13:42.280 --> 13:43.280
It's...

13:43.280 --> 13:44.280
I'm trying to see what...

13:44.280 --> 13:46.280
It's a picture of here.

13:46.280 --> 13:47.640
I can't really recognize it.

13:47.640 --> 13:48.640
I love fun socks.

13:48.640 --> 13:50.200
Oh, it's a Piranha Plant.

13:50.240 --> 13:53.120
I only saw one half of it, so yeah.

13:53.120 --> 13:54.480
So it's like a Piranha Plant.

13:54.480 --> 13:55.480
That's awesome.

13:55.480 --> 13:56.480
Cool.

13:56.480 --> 14:00.480
And then I got a card.

14:00.480 --> 14:01.480
Because it's for me.

14:01.480 --> 14:02.480
And the card says it's all for your kids.

14:02.480 --> 14:03.480
And it's Happy Hanukkah.

14:03.480 --> 14:04.480
Awesome.

14:04.480 --> 14:05.480
Thank you.

14:05.480 --> 14:06.480
You're welcome.

14:06.480 --> 14:07.480
Fun.

14:07.480 --> 14:15.960
You guys are, you know, just a great part of my life and I wanted to do something kind

14:15.960 --> 14:16.960
and show you...

14:16.960 --> 14:17.960
I love the shirt.

14:17.960 --> 14:18.960
I'm glad you like it.

14:18.960 --> 14:22.440
I was like, oh, fuck yeah.

14:22.440 --> 14:24.440
We have a lot of chatters that are saying...

14:24.440 --> 14:25.440
I told Nellie.

14:25.440 --> 14:26.720
She's like, yeah, I get it.

14:26.720 --> 14:30.240
There's a lot of folks in our chat that are saying Loki needs to try the Pocky live on

14:30.240 --> 14:31.240
air.

14:31.240 --> 14:33.660
So what kind of flavor is it?

14:33.660 --> 14:34.660
It's chocolate.

14:34.660 --> 14:36.360
Because Loki's a picky ass eater.

14:36.360 --> 14:38.360
It's like a fine chocolate.

14:38.360 --> 14:40.000
Chocolate should be fine.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
Chocolate's safe.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
It's just chocolate.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.920
See, this way I pick just like a nice easy flavor.

14:44.920 --> 14:45.920
Good, good, good.

14:45.920 --> 14:46.920
Yeah.

14:46.920 --> 14:48.480
Because, you know, Loki is a baby and he's picky.

14:48.480 --> 14:49.480
He's a picky baby.

14:49.480 --> 14:51.920
I'm not necessarily about food.

14:51.920 --> 14:52.920
It's just...

14:52.920 --> 14:53.920
Okay.

14:53.920 --> 14:54.920
All right.

14:54.920 --> 14:56.600
While you open that up, I'm going to open this.

14:56.600 --> 14:58.200
So this is for Alan and I though, right?

14:58.200 --> 14:59.200
You said?

14:59.200 --> 15:00.200
Yes, it is.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.520
But I'm sure he'll forgive you for opening it up on behalf of you both.

15:02.520 --> 15:03.520
Fun socks.

15:03.520 --> 15:04.520
Yes.

15:04.520 --> 15:05.520
My favorite.

15:05.520 --> 15:07.600
The tag came off of them, so I had to just fold them up.

15:07.600 --> 15:08.600
Pizza socks.

15:08.600 --> 15:09.600
They're pizza.

15:09.600 --> 15:10.600
Pizza socks.

15:10.600 --> 15:11.600
And you and Alan can fight over who gets which pair of socks.

15:11.600 --> 15:12.600
Pizza time.

15:12.600 --> 15:13.600
Okay.

15:13.600 --> 15:14.600
Is this weird for me to talk about on air?

15:14.600 --> 15:16.360
Alan and I share our entire wardrobe.

15:16.360 --> 15:19.080
Our entire wardrobe because we're the same size.

15:19.080 --> 15:20.080
That's fine.

15:20.080 --> 15:21.080
So we share socks.

15:21.080 --> 15:22.080
That's awesome.

15:22.080 --> 15:23.080
I steal Dan's undershirts.

15:23.080 --> 15:24.080
Yeah.

15:24.080 --> 15:25.320
Although my stuff doesn't fit him.

15:25.320 --> 15:27.840
Best part of being gay is double the wardrobes.

15:27.840 --> 15:31.320
And what better than pizza but burger and fries to go with that?

15:31.320 --> 15:32.320
Perfect.

15:32.320 --> 15:33.320
Perfect.

15:33.320 --> 15:34.320
I'm all about food.

15:34.320 --> 15:35.320
Love it.

15:35.320 --> 15:36.320
All right.

15:36.320 --> 15:37.320
And let's see.

15:37.320 --> 15:38.840
One of them I'll be surprised if you didn't guess I was getting it for you though.

15:38.840 --> 15:40.220
Fresh food for skin.

15:40.220 --> 15:42.000
My special recipes for beautiful skin.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.000
This is an Alan thing.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
That's an Alan thing for sure.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.360
Alan loves these.

15:45.360 --> 15:48.920
For those of you that watch Drag Race, you know that Alyssa Edwards when Alyssa Edwards

15:48.920 --> 15:49.920
has samples.

15:49.920 --> 15:50.920
Oh, okay.

15:50.920 --> 15:51.920
Hold on.

15:51.920 --> 15:53.800
The Loki is trying the Pocky for the first time.

15:53.800 --> 15:54.800
Here we go.

15:54.800 --> 15:56.840
Nom, nom, nom.

15:56.840 --> 15:59.640
And he's evaluating.

15:59.640 --> 16:00.640
It's all right.

16:00.640 --> 16:01.640
It's chocolate.

16:01.640 --> 16:05.040
By the way, I love he just talked into the Pocky like the Pocky was the mic.

16:05.040 --> 16:06.920
I had the mic in my hand.

16:06.920 --> 16:07.920
Okay.

16:07.920 --> 16:08.920
So yes.

16:08.920 --> 16:14.000
Anyway, if you've seen that Alyssa Edwards wearing the face mask, I've walked in on that,

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
but it's my husband.

16:15.640 --> 16:16.640
So he loves the face mask stuff.

16:16.640 --> 16:17.640
So he'll like that.

16:17.640 --> 16:18.640
Yeah.

16:18.640 --> 16:19.640
It's good.

16:19.640 --> 16:20.640
I like it.

16:20.640 --> 16:21.640
I'm excited about this funko verse.

16:21.640 --> 16:22.640
Oh, it's a strategy game.

16:22.640 --> 16:23.640
The golden.

16:23.640 --> 16:26.800
Oh, it was that one that I was like, you better tell someone to get this for you.

16:26.800 --> 16:29.280
It's the funko verse golden girls game.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.840
I didn't want you to think that I got it.

16:30.840 --> 16:35.500
So they have a game, but I knew you had, I had to gauge your reaction.

16:35.500 --> 16:36.500
That's cool.

16:36.500 --> 16:37.500
Yeah.

16:37.500 --> 16:40.720
Now can I put the other funcos with these funcos?

16:40.720 --> 16:42.660
I'm sure those are little funcos though.

16:42.660 --> 16:43.660
So they're tiny.

16:43.660 --> 16:44.660
Okay.

16:45.320 --> 16:46.320
Oh, that's fun.

16:46.320 --> 16:47.320
But yeah.

16:47.320 --> 16:48.320
So, so I had to double up cause it was you and Alan.

16:48.320 --> 16:49.320
And nothing for Mr. Smoosh.

16:49.320 --> 16:50.320
Yeah.

16:50.320 --> 16:51.320
Cat.

16:51.320 --> 16:52.320
I bought you stuff when you were new.

16:52.320 --> 16:53.320
Ooh.

16:53.320 --> 16:54.320
Ooh.

16:54.320 --> 16:55.320
K cups.

16:55.320 --> 16:56.320
Cause you know, I love me some coffee.

16:56.320 --> 16:57.320
Cinnabon.

16:57.320 --> 16:58.320
And I want one.

16:58.320 --> 16:59.320
Which Dark Sakura bought for herself.

16:59.320 --> 17:00.320
That's fine.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.320
No, we love those.

17:01.320 --> 17:02.320
You know how it goes.

17:02.320 --> 17:03.320
And oh, fuck.

17:03.320 --> 17:04.320
Yeah.

17:04.320 --> 17:06.800
It's a phone stand, but it features a Bad Bats Maru.

17:06.800 --> 17:07.800
My favorite.

17:07.800 --> 17:09.720
I couldn't find the one for Alan.

17:09.720 --> 17:12.200
That's what I was telling you when I was at the store.

17:12.200 --> 17:13.200
That's all right.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.200
He didn't need one.

17:14.740 --> 17:15.740
That's something else for Alan.

17:15.740 --> 17:16.740
Is this it?

17:16.740 --> 17:17.740
I'm guessing.

17:17.740 --> 17:18.740
That should be it.

17:18.740 --> 17:19.740
Although you'll probably use it too.

17:19.740 --> 17:21.420
Oh, he'll like this.

17:21.420 --> 17:23.580
It's um, Hello Kitty and Choco cat.

17:23.580 --> 17:25.860
I couldn't think of Choco cat.

17:25.860 --> 17:26.980
That's the one he really likes.

17:26.980 --> 17:27.980
It's got caropia.

17:27.980 --> 17:29.660
It's the only Choco cat thing that I could find.

17:29.660 --> 17:30.660
He'll love this.

17:30.660 --> 17:31.660
He'll absolutely love this.

17:31.660 --> 17:32.660
So there you go.

17:32.660 --> 17:33.660
So anyway.

17:33.660 --> 17:35.300
And then a card as well from Dark Sakura.

17:35.300 --> 17:36.300
Yeah.

17:36.300 --> 17:37.300
And it's a Hanukkah card.

17:37.300 --> 17:38.300
It says happy Hanukkah.

17:38.300 --> 17:39.300
Well, I have to read the card.

17:39.300 --> 17:40.300
Okay.

17:40.300 --> 17:41.300
Well read what's in it.

17:41.300 --> 17:42.300
I hope I didn't put something stupid in there.

17:42.300 --> 17:43.300
Let's see.

17:43.640 --> 17:44.640
It's a personal message.

17:44.640 --> 17:45.640
I'm not going to read it on air.

17:45.640 --> 17:46.640
You can read it.

17:46.640 --> 17:47.760
I don't care.

17:47.760 --> 17:49.160
I hope you enjoy these items.

17:49.160 --> 17:51.640
Since I couldn't find the HK pop ring.

17:51.640 --> 17:52.640
I got Alan a mug.

17:52.640 --> 17:53.640
Love you both.

17:53.640 --> 17:54.640
Oh, we love you too.

17:54.640 --> 17:55.640
Thank you.

17:55.640 --> 17:56.640
Thank you.

17:56.640 --> 17:57.640
Thank you.

17:57.640 --> 17:58.640
Thank you.

17:58.640 --> 17:59.640
Thank you.

17:59.640 --> 18:00.640
Thank you.

18:00.640 --> 18:04.820
And I promised Nellie I'd be baking soon and send a big batch of cookies home with you

18:04.820 --> 18:06.160
are probably after next show.

18:06.160 --> 18:07.160
So okay.

18:07.160 --> 18:08.160
All right.

18:08.160 --> 18:10.080
Well, we don't have any Betty in the chat room screaming.

18:10.080 --> 18:11.960
Why aren't you guys talking about games?

18:11.980 --> 18:13.820
So I guess we're doing fine so far.

18:13.820 --> 18:16.740
So, but we will get into games a little bit here.

18:16.740 --> 18:18.340
Let's talk about the game awards.

18:18.340 --> 18:22.380
That was probably the big headline from this last week is that the game awards happened.

18:22.380 --> 18:26.260
And there was a lot of stuff going on at the game awards.

18:26.260 --> 18:27.260
Game of the year.

18:27.260 --> 18:29.840
Sequero was the game of the year.

18:29.840 --> 18:33.440
So which is admittedly haven't gotten around to that game.

18:33.440 --> 18:35.580
Wasn't really on my radar because it's a from software game.

18:35.580 --> 18:38.960
Not that I hate from software, but those dark souls games.

18:38.960 --> 18:39.960
I'm terrible at them.

18:39.960 --> 18:40.960
Called it.

18:40.960 --> 18:43.340
But my husband loves those games.

18:43.340 --> 18:47.620
So I'm sure he will get around to playing Sequero at some point, but I, you did call

18:47.620 --> 18:48.940
it on the last episode, dark soccer.

18:48.940 --> 18:50.140
I'm actually kind of surprised.

18:50.140 --> 18:55.060
I was assuming it would be death stranding or smash with maybe control kind of being

18:55.060 --> 18:57.640
like the dark horse in that race.

18:57.640 --> 18:59.980
Did not think Sequero would actually pull it out.

18:59.980 --> 19:03.860
Why, why do you think since you, you did kind of hit your bets there, why do you think Sequero

19:03.860 --> 19:05.940
pulled out the win?

19:05.940 --> 19:09.160
Just because I think it was a, you know, it wasn't weird.

19:09.160 --> 19:15.260
I think because death stranding was very unique and I kind of put people off and smash is

19:15.260 --> 19:16.660
just fucking smash.

19:16.660 --> 19:18.340
So whatever.

19:18.340 --> 19:22.900
I think it was new enough and odd enough and had a great story to it and a great, you know,

19:22.900 --> 19:27.140
theme that it really had a little bit more staying power.

19:27.140 --> 19:31.220
And I don't know many people who would go back and do a second run through death stranding,

19:31.220 --> 19:34.420
but second all has like more challenge to it.

19:34.420 --> 19:36.220
So I think that that was what did it.

19:36.220 --> 19:37.220
And it's pretty.

19:37.280 --> 19:40.720
Steph says it is fucking smash and I don't think she means that as a negative, but it's

19:40.720 --> 19:44.760
one of those things where it's like, it was a game that came out last year for one.

19:44.760 --> 19:49.480
And you know, we have had several smash games before and this was really like a, this game

19:49.480 --> 19:54.480
is supposed to be basically the, the hodgepodge, every, everybody is here.

19:54.480 --> 19:56.480
It's the everything celebration of smash.

19:56.480 --> 19:57.840
And again, these aren't bad things.

19:57.840 --> 20:00.840
Like absolutely is, should be one of the best games of the year.

20:00.840 --> 20:05.680
But I think maybe because it did feel a little bit like we've been here before.

20:05.680 --> 20:09.280
Maybe when we consider the critics that were voting on it, they wanted to pick something

20:09.280 --> 20:10.740
kind of newer.

20:10.740 --> 20:14.140
So they went for Sekiro, even though I guess you could say, well, Sekiro was kind of, but

20:14.140 --> 20:15.940
it's not really the same as Dark Souls.

20:15.940 --> 20:17.340
It's a different type of thing.

20:17.340 --> 20:21.940
So, you know, it is, it is something a little newer and I don't think a Dark Souls or a

20:21.940 --> 20:24.620
Bloodborne or anything has won a game of the year before.

20:24.620 --> 20:27.540
I think Bloodborne was nominated, but I don't think it won.

20:27.540 --> 20:32.660
So maybe it was kind of one of those, one of those time and tastes have changed.

20:32.660 --> 20:33.660
Yeah.

20:33.660 --> 20:36.160
And then it also says, I'm still waiting on Sakurai getting more recognition for his

20:36.160 --> 20:37.160
life work.

20:37.160 --> 20:41.060
Well, it did win best fighting game all over all of the traditional fighters that were

20:41.060 --> 20:45.040
nominated, like your mortal combats and your, uh, you know, uh, samurai showdown, I think

20:45.040 --> 20:46.460
was in there and that type of stuff.

20:46.460 --> 20:53.040
So, I mean, I do feel like all of the games that were nominated won something like death

20:53.040 --> 20:57.480
stranding of the director award smash one, the fighting game control got something didn't

20:57.480 --> 20:58.480
it?

20:58.480 --> 21:00.200
Or did I just keep seeing it as a nominee?

21:00.200 --> 21:04.720
I don't remember, but at this point to see the ongoing game went to Fortnite.

21:04.720 --> 21:09.320
Yeah, that was certainly, you know, in the final community, they do a lot of, they do

21:09.320 --> 21:13.840
a lot of content updates, so I guess, I mean, that makes sense, but yeah, I don't know.

21:13.840 --> 21:14.840
Uh, yeah.

21:14.840 --> 21:18.040
And obviously we had a big one that dropped this past weekend, which Dark Sakura, I think

21:18.040 --> 21:19.800
is, has a story on that coming up later.

21:19.800 --> 21:24.120
Um, but yeah, there's that, Oh, outer worlds was the other nominee that didn't really win

21:24.120 --> 21:25.120
anything.

21:25.120 --> 21:26.920
Bobby Blackwell says, I don't think outer worlds won anything.

21:26.960 --> 21:32.600
I think outer worlds, I think kind of suffered from being a little too, like, you know, the

21:32.600 --> 21:38.000
fallout game we wanted to play this year or, you know, it kind of felt like it was a good

21:38.000 --> 21:41.720
title, but it did also feel like we've kind of been here before type of thing.

21:41.720 --> 21:42.720
Maybe.

21:42.720 --> 21:44.120
Again, I don't want to make it sound like I'm dogging these games.

21:44.120 --> 21:48.480
I'm just trying to figure out like, you know, how did a game like Sekiro, which is probably

21:48.480 --> 21:50.700
one of the least talked about in the category.

21:50.700 --> 21:53.240
How did it come through above all these other ones?

21:53.480 --> 21:59.000
Maybe it was just the desire to give the award to something you're not hearing about as much.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.560
I think one of the big winners from the game awards, honestly, I think even more so than

22:02.560 --> 22:07.440
Sekiro was, um, Disco Elysium, I think was a huge winner because of the fact that one

22:07.440 --> 22:11.840
two awards, I don't think it was on a lot of people's radar before that night.

22:11.840 --> 22:16.400
But um, you know, it won two big awards and people were very excited about it.

22:16.400 --> 22:18.880
Uh, and they had the folks on stage and everything.

22:18.880 --> 22:21.520
I thought that was a pretty big deal.

22:21.520 --> 22:25.220
So I think Disco Elysium was also one of the big winners of the night.

22:25.220 --> 22:28.280
What did you guys think of the game awards for those that watched it?

22:28.280 --> 22:29.460
Loki, you watched it.

22:29.460 --> 22:31.080
What did you think of the game awards?

22:31.080 --> 22:32.520
I thought it was good.

22:32.520 --> 22:35.200
I thought they did a pretty solid event.

22:35.200 --> 22:37.240
There was like very little of it.

22:37.240 --> 22:41.640
That was kind of cringy and you know, the commercials this time of year didn't really

22:41.640 --> 22:43.040
bother me as much.

22:43.040 --> 22:47.760
Um, although I did see like a repeated commercial for a game that's already been out.

22:48.760 --> 22:53.600
I kind of wish that there wasn't multiple commercials for the same game, but eh, it's

22:53.600 --> 22:54.600
a minor gripe.

22:54.600 --> 22:56.160
Yeah, they got to pay the bills somehow.

22:56.160 --> 22:59.360
So if somebody wants to buy time to advertise a game that's already out.

22:59.360 --> 23:01.440
And it was an indie game too that's advertising.

23:01.440 --> 23:03.000
So I mean, true.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
I don't know.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
It was okay.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.800
Um, Act Def correcting a little bit saying Disco Elysium won three awards.

23:08.800 --> 23:11.240
I guess one of them was one of the fast forwarded categories.

23:11.240 --> 23:12.240
That's why I must have missed it.

23:12.240 --> 23:17.040
But Act Def clarifying it won best indie, fresh indie and narrative.

23:17.320 --> 23:19.120
Um, Cypher Macinations in our chats.

23:19.120 --> 23:20.720
Um, sorry if I mispronounced that.

23:20.720 --> 23:25.520
I'm saying machina- I was thinking like fascination, fascination street, but machination.

23:25.520 --> 23:26.520
You have machinima.

23:26.520 --> 23:27.520
Machinima.

23:27.520 --> 23:28.520
It says a machine.

23:28.520 --> 23:29.520
Okay.

23:29.520 --> 23:30.520
Machining issues.

23:30.520 --> 23:33.960
Uh, The Outer Worlds was an amazing game, but it felt like a game you've already played

23:33.960 --> 23:34.960
before.

23:34.960 --> 23:39.080
No real reinvention or groundbreaking, a rock solid game, but nothing in your face.

23:39.080 --> 23:40.080
Yeah.

23:40.080 --> 23:42.760
I think, I think that kind of made it like a safe bet and there's nothing wrong with

23:42.760 --> 23:43.760
a safe bet.

23:44.200 --> 23:48.360
There's nothing wrong going to like your, your go-to favorite old comfort food, right?

23:48.360 --> 23:53.480
But sometimes the one that takes the risks is the thing that gets rewarded.

23:53.480 --> 23:59.240
So yeah, I, I definitely agree with that summary there, even if I butchered your name, I apologize.

23:59.240 --> 24:05.240
Um, but anyhow, um, yeah, I, I don't usually watch the game awards start to finish, but

24:05.240 --> 24:08.720
we did that co-stream here at VOG Network earlier this week where Bobby Blackwolf and

24:08.720 --> 24:10.960
I were doing a stream with it.

24:10.960 --> 24:14.080
And so I was kind of forced to watch the whole thing, but I, I didn't hate it.

24:14.080 --> 24:15.640
Um, in fact, I rather liked it.

24:15.640 --> 24:17.760
I thought it was, I thought it was efficient.

24:17.760 --> 24:18.760
Yeah.

24:18.760 --> 24:22.320
There's a few things now that I think of it that were kind of like a little cringy.

24:22.320 --> 24:25.840
Um, the whole Apex Legends thing was a little cringy.

24:25.840 --> 24:30.040
The Birds of Prey thing was kind of cringy and I get it was for a trailer, but it was

24:30.040 --> 24:31.760
just, it's kind of like, eh.

24:31.760 --> 24:34.960
I think Bobby and I were talking over that part, so we didn't even really know.

24:34.960 --> 24:37.880
It's like, okay, like just, just show the trailer.

24:37.880 --> 24:40.520
Just, we don't need like this lead up to it.

24:40.520 --> 24:42.840
Um, but I mean, it's minor stuff.

24:42.840 --> 24:45.160
I mean, what they did right was pretty awesome.

24:45.160 --> 24:46.600
Every award show has something cringy.

24:46.600 --> 24:47.880
The Oscars always do something cringy.

24:47.880 --> 24:51.480
Of course, you know, like, you know, the Muppets thing that was fantastic.

24:51.480 --> 24:55.880
And see the Muppets thing could have been cringy, but it really wasn't like, it was

24:55.880 --> 24:57.040
really funny.

24:57.040 --> 25:00.800
And the, the, the crossover with Untitled Goose Game was brilliant.

25:00.800 --> 25:06.500
Like, you know, the, the fact that those two teamed up, not just for the, um, the Muppet

25:06.500 --> 25:10.980
version of the Goose, but the fact that like, they actually put together this game footage

25:10.980 --> 25:12.260
that had Beaker in it.

25:12.260 --> 25:15.660
Like, honestly, the biggest disappointment of the night is that that Beaker expansion

25:15.660 --> 25:17.260
isn't a real thing.

25:17.260 --> 25:18.260
That would be amazing.

25:18.260 --> 25:20.460
I wish, I wish that would really happen.

25:20.460 --> 25:23.420
I think a lot of people do after the game awards, that's for sure.

25:23.420 --> 25:26.100
So, um, yeah, I think that was, that was great.

25:26.100 --> 25:27.100
Yeah.

25:27.100 --> 25:30.500
Only the, only the Apex Legends thing came off as cringy and I think it went on too long,

25:30.500 --> 25:31.500
I think in some ways.

25:31.500 --> 25:33.900
And the Fast and Furious thing is like the final reveal.

25:34.180 --> 25:38.220
Like I get that Vin Diesel is a pretty big land, Michelle Rodriguez is cool too.

25:38.220 --> 25:42.540
And that's a pretty big land for, you know, who's announcing your best game of the year.

25:42.540 --> 25:46.860
But I think the Fast and the Furious thing being like the final unveil of the night was

25:46.860 --> 25:52.160
kind of a like, meh, like it was kind of like, especially when you had such huge stuff earlier

25:52.160 --> 25:53.160
in the night, right?

25:53.160 --> 25:54.160
Yeah.

25:54.160 --> 25:58.500
It's like, it's hard to follow the, the new Xbox system or like, you know, Hey, here's

25:58.500 --> 26:05.140
the first game for PlayStation five and it's like, here's Fast and the Furious and it looks

26:05.140 --> 26:06.140
old.

26:06.140 --> 26:09.260
Let's get into some of those other big reveals because as Loki mentioned, one of them, which

26:09.260 --> 26:15.180
is just huge, is the fact that we got more information on the next Xbox, which I don't

26:15.180 --> 26:16.480
think anybody was expecting.

26:16.480 --> 26:20.240
You know, we had a lot of rumors about the game awards, what was going to be announced.

26:20.240 --> 26:21.980
Pretty much all of them turned out to be bullshit.

26:21.980 --> 26:25.380
Uh, the new smash character being unveiled, bullshit.

26:25.380 --> 26:28.260
In fact, Nintendo really didn't show anything at all.

26:28.260 --> 26:30.100
Uh, Doug Bowser was there.

26:30.100 --> 26:32.940
Um, Reggie was there, but not in a Nintendo capacity.

26:32.940 --> 26:33.940
Actually the Reggie speech was amazing.

26:33.940 --> 26:35.380
I want to point that out.

26:35.380 --> 26:36.820
Reggie speech was amazing.

26:36.820 --> 26:43.220
And um, the, uh, gaming for good and spotlighting like the refugee, the, the, the veteran that

26:43.220 --> 26:46.140
was making a game and the 11 year old that was making a game.

26:46.140 --> 26:47.140
I think I even made a comment.

26:47.140 --> 26:48.940
I'm like this 11 year old made a game.

26:48.940 --> 26:52.780
Loki hasn't made a game and this 11 year old has made a game.

26:52.780 --> 26:53.780
But no, I don't want it.

26:53.820 --> 26:56.020
The 11 year old doesn't have a daytime job.

26:56.020 --> 27:00.340
So, you know, I don't want to make light or make fun of the 11 year old because his story

27:00.340 --> 27:04.300
was very heartwarming and, um, or heart wrenching, I should say.

27:04.300 --> 27:08.020
And his, uh, the fact that he's kind of taking a lot of that emotion and putting it into

27:08.020 --> 27:09.020
a game.

27:09.020 --> 27:11.820
I mean, you want to say games, aren't an art form.

27:11.820 --> 27:12.820
Look at that.

27:12.820 --> 27:16.340
Like that is, you know, the, the, how he's developing that game is, is an expression.

27:16.340 --> 27:18.860
Like that just, that just serves to be game as an art form.

27:18.860 --> 27:21.220
So, I mean, those are some very powerful segments.

27:21.220 --> 27:26.580
So even though we might've lost the, um, lifetime achievement award, I was totally fine with

27:26.580 --> 27:29.740
the, the gaming for good as a like replacement, if you will.

27:29.740 --> 27:32.420
I thought it was, those were really like powerful segments.

27:32.420 --> 27:36.180
Um, anyway, so the, the Nintendo stuff ended up being bull.

27:36.180 --> 27:41.180
Yes, Nintendo did have a trailer for Bravely Default 2, but that was actually a Square

27:41.180 --> 27:42.500
Enix announcement, right?

27:42.500 --> 27:44.020
They had like just commercials.

27:44.020 --> 27:46.940
That was about the most that you had from Nintendo there.

27:46.940 --> 27:47.940
Exactly.

27:47.940 --> 27:48.940
Right.

27:48.940 --> 27:52.620
Um, Shane is in chats, uh, talking about the No More Heroes 3 trailer.

27:52.620 --> 27:53.620
It was amazing.

27:53.620 --> 27:58.500
And I've never played a proper No More Heroes yet, but again, third party trailer, but it

27:58.500 --> 27:59.500
wasn't.

27:59.500 --> 28:00.500
Maybe I skimmed through that one.

28:00.500 --> 28:04.220
Oh no, it was, it was the one that they started, it was like a goddamn superhero was the first

28:04.220 --> 28:05.780
name or something like that.

28:05.780 --> 28:07.500
And then it actually ended up being No More Heroes 3.

28:07.500 --> 28:08.500
It was towards the beginning.

28:08.500 --> 28:10.300
I think I must've missed it.

28:10.300 --> 28:11.300
Go back and check it out.

28:11.300 --> 28:14.740
It was, it was, it was a very good trailer, so that was cool.

28:14.740 --> 28:18.060
Um, so anyway, uh, that was BS.

28:18.060 --> 28:21.300
Uh, the next Rock Steady Batman game was rumored.

28:21.300 --> 28:23.140
That didn't show up either, so.

28:23.140 --> 28:30.220
And I know that, uh, gameplay for, uh, Fallout, or not Fallout, Half-Life, Alyx was cut at

28:30.220 --> 28:31.220
last minute.

28:31.220 --> 28:35.340
Yeah, there's a lot of talk about that too, that that didn't end up happening, so interesting.

28:35.340 --> 28:36.380
But what did we get?

28:36.380 --> 28:41.900
I think something that nobody was expecting, and that was the official name and first early

28:41.900 --> 28:49.740
details on Project Scarlet, which is now and forever, Xbox Series X.

28:49.740 --> 28:52.800
That is the name of the console.

28:52.800 --> 28:56.340
Even though it has that word series in there, which really threw me for a loop at first,

28:56.340 --> 29:00.100
I was like, cause as it was being unveiled on the stream, I was thinking, oh, okay, well

29:00.100 --> 29:05.460
then this lends itself to that they're going to have the, um, uh, discless one, they're

29:05.460 --> 29:08.140
going to have the one with the disc, like there's going to be a series of consoles.

29:08.140 --> 29:09.140
Nope.

29:09.140 --> 29:13.460
There's a console called Xbox Series X, and what we're looking at on Twitch, you might

29:13.460 --> 29:16.860
hear a little bit in the background, is we're looking at that reveal trailer that showed,

29:16.860 --> 29:21.500
you know, it looks, it does look really good, like the, the detail in the environment is

29:21.500 --> 29:23.780
really stunning when you're looking at this.

29:23.780 --> 29:29.340
Um, and you know, you see some, like, assumably Forza, Halo, and, uh, Soccer kind of all rolled

29:29.340 --> 29:30.340
up in one.

29:30.340 --> 29:31.340
FIFA Pro.

29:31.340 --> 29:32.340
Yeah.

29:32.340 --> 29:35.100
And then we see, oh, here it is, it looks like it is a tall tower, uh, although it is

29:35.100 --> 29:38.580
confirmed you can put it in either configuration sideways or up and down.

29:38.580 --> 29:42.300
This is the tall tower and I hope it really does glow green like that cause I do like

29:42.300 --> 29:43.300
that glow.

29:43.300 --> 29:47.360
Uh, and the new controller that will go with it, that is the Xbox Series X.

29:47.360 --> 29:52.060
That is the official name of what was formerly known as Project Scarlet.

29:52.060 --> 29:53.180
So what do you guys think about that name?

29:53.180 --> 29:54.420
Xbox Series X?

29:54.420 --> 29:56.260
It's confusing, but I don't care.

29:56.260 --> 29:57.260
It's fine.

29:57.260 --> 30:00.660
It doesn't, I don't really care what it's called.

30:00.660 --> 30:01.660
Right.

30:01.660 --> 30:02.660
Yeah.

30:02.660 --> 30:06.020
It's, I, I, I really didn't like it at first because I also thought it was confusing.

30:06.020 --> 30:07.020
I was like, wait a minute.

30:07.020 --> 30:08.820
It's a series, but it's only one.

30:08.820 --> 30:09.820
Like what is that all about?

30:09.820 --> 30:12.660
I think, I think this is what it is.

30:12.660 --> 30:16.520
I think Xbox gaming is simply Xbox.

30:16.520 --> 30:19.700
They just want to say, you're going to play it on Xbox, you're gonna play it on your Xbox.

30:19.700 --> 30:23.340
You've got an Xbox game and Xbox service and all this stuff.

30:23.340 --> 30:27.140
And I think the reason why they're going with Series X, it has to do with the fact that,

30:27.140 --> 30:31.420
uh, Microsoft has said this before, is that now when you buy a game, it will be playable

30:31.420 --> 30:34.260
on their entire ecosystem.

30:34.260 --> 30:35.260
Right.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.340
Starting with Xbox one.

30:37.340 --> 30:39.660
I don't think you can play those games on Xbox 360.

30:39.660 --> 30:44.980
So it'll have to be Xbox one or the first, and now kind of like you might have cars that

30:44.980 --> 30:46.940
come out in different series or models.

30:46.940 --> 30:53.380
This is Series X and then maybe in 2023 or whenever we get a refresher thing, we might

30:53.380 --> 30:57.560
get Series Y or Series Platinum or Series.

30:57.560 --> 30:58.560
And there'd be different ways.

30:58.560 --> 31:00.900
I think it'd just be like X2, X3, X4.

31:00.900 --> 31:03.080
And that may be something they do as well.

31:03.680 --> 31:07.520
Kind of like, like, like they're thinking about like phones, you know, where you have

31:07.520 --> 31:11.720
the Samsung Galaxy S4, S5.

31:11.720 --> 31:12.720
I think you're right.

31:12.720 --> 31:17.180
If you think about this name as like a cell phone name, it makes a lot more sense than

31:17.180 --> 31:19.640
maybe what has traditionally been a console name.

31:19.640 --> 31:22.400
And for that reason, I'm warming up to it a little bit.

31:22.400 --> 31:25.480
I don't think it's as detrimental a name as Xbox Wii U.

31:25.480 --> 31:26.480
What?

31:26.480 --> 31:27.480
Xbox Wii U.

31:27.480 --> 31:28.480
Wow.

31:28.480 --> 31:30.040
I mean, that would be pretty detrimental too.

31:30.040 --> 31:31.600
I don't know what this is.

31:31.600 --> 31:32.600
Wow.

31:33.120 --> 31:34.560
Is this a Nintendo product?

31:34.560 --> 31:35.840
Is it a Microsoft product?

31:35.840 --> 31:36.840
Let's try that again.

31:36.840 --> 31:41.840
I don't think it's detrimental as a name as Nintendo Wii U, but I think because, you know,

31:41.840 --> 31:45.120
Wii U lended itself to think, oh, it's an upgrade to the Wii and all this other stuff

31:45.120 --> 31:46.320
that wasn't true.

31:46.320 --> 31:51.480
But I think, you know, Xbox Series X, I think it's I don't hate it.

31:51.480 --> 31:57.240
The only thing that's weird, I think it gets really easily confused with Xbox One X.

31:57.240 --> 31:59.320
That was the thing that really threw me at first.

31:59.560 --> 32:04.040
That might be like kind of what they're going with there, whereas the Series X is going

32:04.040 --> 32:07.160
to be like their high end and they're going to have Series S, which is going to be their

32:07.160 --> 32:08.560
low end or something.

32:08.560 --> 32:09.560
Maybe.

32:09.560 --> 32:10.560
Or, I don't know.

32:10.560 --> 32:11.560
Yeah.

32:11.560 --> 32:15.840
So I think Microsoft is adopting basically cell phone naming conventions.

32:15.840 --> 32:18.800
And quite simply, these consoles are Xboxes.

32:18.800 --> 32:20.080
It's the Xbox.

32:20.080 --> 32:23.800
So we don't necessarily have to talk about games coming out for Xbox Series X.

32:23.800 --> 32:25.560
The games are coming out for Xbox.

32:25.560 --> 32:26.880
You can play them on your Series X.

32:26.880 --> 32:27.880
You can play them on your One.

32:27.920 --> 32:29.280
You can play them on your One X.

32:29.280 --> 32:30.760
You can play them on, right?

32:30.760 --> 32:34.440
Just like an Android game comes out for Android and you can play them on all sorts of these

32:34.440 --> 32:35.560
different things.

32:35.560 --> 32:39.240
That is where Microsoft is taking their naming conventions, in my opinion.

32:39.240 --> 32:44.400
So now, and a lot of people in chat talking about something that I brought up on Twitter.

32:44.400 --> 32:48.280
So a lot of people remember when the Xbox One was announced, what did we abbreviate

32:48.280 --> 32:49.280
it as?

32:49.280 --> 32:50.280
The Xbone.

32:50.280 --> 32:52.800
XB1, the Xbone, right?

32:52.800 --> 32:55.800
Well, think about that name, Xbox Series X.

32:55.840 --> 32:58.280
I know I pointed this out when we were live.

32:58.280 --> 32:59.280
XSX?

32:59.280 --> 33:00.280
Close.

33:00.280 --> 33:02.280
Xbox Series.

33:02.280 --> 33:05.280
XSEX.

33:05.280 --> 33:06.280
That's a stretch.

33:06.280 --> 33:07.280
It's the X-Sex.

33:09.880 --> 33:11.480
So it is done.

33:11.480 --> 33:12.480
It is named.

33:12.480 --> 33:13.480
The Box-Sex.

33:13.480 --> 33:14.480
It is law.

33:14.480 --> 33:17.480
Xbox Series X is the X-Sex.

33:17.480 --> 33:18.480
Done.

33:18.480 --> 33:20.480
It's a good name.

33:20.480 --> 33:22.480
You know they have to know that that's a potential.

33:22.480 --> 33:24.480
That's a bit X-X-ive.

33:25.160 --> 33:30.160
It is a bit X-Sex-ive.

33:34.160 --> 33:36.160
Alright, anyway.

33:36.160 --> 33:40.160
Dark Soccer, you weren't watching the Game Awards, so you didn't see this all play out,

33:40.160 --> 33:43.160
but I know you just got a peek there at that little trailer and so forth.

33:43.160 --> 33:45.160
I will say things we have not gone over.

33:45.160 --> 33:46.160
I think I was working.

33:46.160 --> 33:47.160
What was that?

33:47.160 --> 33:48.160
I think I was working.

33:48.160 --> 33:49.160
Yeah.

33:49.160 --> 33:50.160
I think you were too.

33:50.840 --> 33:56.560
They also announced, and it should be noted, Hellblade Setsuna Part 2 is Ninja Theory's

33:56.560 --> 33:57.560
game they're working on.

33:57.560 --> 34:01.600
There was a really cool little trailer that had an actress that looked like she was like

34:01.600 --> 34:03.600
a cave person kind of singing death metal.

34:03.600 --> 34:04.600
Cool.

34:04.600 --> 34:05.600
That's what it looked like to me.

34:05.600 --> 34:06.600
I'm down.

34:06.600 --> 34:07.600
Yeah, right?

34:07.600 --> 34:08.600
You should look up the trailer.

34:08.600 --> 34:09.600
She's from the first game too.

34:09.600 --> 34:10.600
She is from the first game.

34:10.600 --> 34:15.120
But I'm like, is that actually a live grab of somebody or is that like, okay, it looks

34:15.120 --> 34:17.480
like a real fucking person.

34:17.480 --> 34:18.960
The graphics are crazy.

34:18.960 --> 34:22.560
But anyway, so we have that as well and all that.

34:22.560 --> 34:26.920
What are your thoughts on, I know you haven't been a big Xbox household, but what do you

34:26.920 --> 34:29.040
think about where Microsoft strategy is going?

34:29.040 --> 34:32.720
I kind of don't care because Microsoft hasn't really done anything that I've been excited

34:32.720 --> 34:34.800
about in a while.

34:34.800 --> 34:37.960
So I'm just going to wait for another PlayStation.

34:37.960 --> 34:44.120
Well, funny you should say that because not to be outdone, I suppose we also, so we got

34:44.120 --> 34:50.920
the first Xbox series X title, or I should say new Xbox title and a hell blade, uh, too.

34:50.920 --> 34:56.260
But then we also got the very first PlayStation five game and the footage for that.

34:56.260 --> 35:02.240
And I didn't have time to rip, but yeah, Epic exclusive by the way, because you know, gearbox,

35:02.240 --> 35:03.240
thank you.

35:03.240 --> 35:06.960
But we had the first, uh, PlayStation five game footage in the form of Godfall, which

35:06.960 --> 35:10.160
is a brand new IP looters slasher.

35:10.160 --> 35:11.160
They're calling it.

35:11.160 --> 35:12.160
Yeah.

35:12.160 --> 35:13.160
It's not a Sony game.

35:13.200 --> 35:17.120
The reason why we're seeing this early is because they could have been showing like

35:17.120 --> 35:20.760
the PC version and saying it's a PlayStation five game as well.

35:20.760 --> 35:21.760
Like it's interesting.

35:21.760 --> 35:25.740
See, I don't know if necessarily Sony had anything to do with this reveal because technically

35:25.740 --> 35:27.320
it was a third party reveal.

35:27.320 --> 35:30.400
They could have been showing the PC version and saying, Oh, we're making it for PlayStation

35:30.400 --> 35:31.400
five as well.

35:31.400 --> 35:34.440
Um, it might be a time exclusive or something.

35:34.440 --> 35:39.440
It might be, but anyway, it's a, it is a, the first PlayStation five game that we got

35:39.440 --> 35:40.440
to look at.

35:40.440 --> 35:42.080
And obviously the graphics looked really good.

35:42.080 --> 35:46.560
Um, I was getting very Xenoblade kind of vibes from the art, especially in the sword

35:46.560 --> 35:48.160
and all that stuff that we were seeing.

35:48.160 --> 35:52.080
Um, but I'm, I'm definitely interested in more, uh, quest buster wants to point out

35:52.080 --> 35:55.520
God falls by counterplay to be published by gearbox.

35:55.520 --> 35:56.520
So yeah.

35:56.520 --> 36:01.320
Um, Shane and chat saying while Microsoft hasn't made like an exclusive game I've cared

36:01.320 --> 36:05.120
about for awhile, man, if games pass, isn't like the best thing out there.

36:05.120 --> 36:06.120
Yeah.

36:06.120 --> 36:07.480
I games pass is really cool.

36:07.480 --> 36:12.040
Um, I think there will be, you know, again, they bought, they have 15 studios now.

36:12.040 --> 36:15.320
So I think there will be something in there that's going to win people over.

36:15.320 --> 36:19.520
Um, for me, certainly a new force of horizon is all it's going to take.

36:19.520 --> 36:22.600
Uh, but even if you know, they're, they do a new fable.

36:22.600 --> 36:24.800
If that rumor comes true, I would love that.

36:24.800 --> 36:26.400
I would love a new fable game.

36:26.400 --> 36:29.320
So there's, there's still a lot of stuff I think Xbox can pull out.

36:29.320 --> 36:30.320
That'd be really exciting.

36:30.320 --> 36:36.800
So, um, but yeah, who knew that at the game awards this week we would see our first Xbox

36:36.800 --> 36:40.120
new Xbox game and our first new PlayStation five game.

36:40.120 --> 36:41.840
That was a pretty big deal.

36:41.840 --> 36:44.120
So yeah, but more to come in the next year.

36:44.120 --> 36:48.880
So any other thoughts on the game awards from anyone and how that all went down?

36:48.880 --> 36:57.000
Um, no, I mean, I, uh, there was some other game trailers that I was excited about.

36:57.000 --> 37:00.960
So surgeon simulator two, which looks like a co-op game now.

37:00.960 --> 37:04.120
So call these four player co-op, four player co-op.

37:04.120 --> 37:05.120
So that's going to be insane.

37:05.120 --> 37:07.120
Um, so that looked cool.

37:07.160 --> 37:10.480
Uh, there was, I'm trying to think what the other one was.

37:10.480 --> 37:12.120
That was pretty cool.

37:12.120 --> 37:15.960
I know they have that like brawler game that was VR that looked kind of neat.

37:15.960 --> 37:20.800
Um, I want the beaker on title goose game.

37:20.800 --> 37:22.600
Uh, yeah, yeah.

37:22.600 --> 37:23.680
I mean, that looks cool.

37:23.680 --> 37:27.120
Um, I know there's that new, that nine to five looked interesting.

37:27.120 --> 37:28.160
Nine to five looks all right.

37:28.160 --> 37:32.240
Uh, that new player unknown game that they just teased being really prologue.

37:32.240 --> 37:35.720
Uh, the, the sons of the forest or whatever that was with the three legged.

37:35.720 --> 37:36.400
Oh yeah.

37:36.400 --> 37:37.400
Sons of the forest.

37:37.400 --> 37:37.680
Yeah.

37:37.680 --> 37:39.320
The, the, the sequel to the forest.

37:39.320 --> 37:42.440
Yeah, that was, yeah, that's going to be scary.

37:42.800 --> 37:44.120
Yeah, that's interesting.

37:44.280 --> 37:46.960
Uh, there was another one that looked like a civilization or something.

37:46.960 --> 37:48.040
It was in the pre-show I think.

37:48.720 --> 37:50.280
Yeah, I remember that.

37:50.640 --> 37:50.880
All right.

37:50.880 --> 37:52.120
Anyway, uh, let's see.

37:52.120 --> 37:56.240
Yeah, the only problem is, uh, the nine to five game is not going to have Dolly

37:56.240 --> 37:57.360
Parton singing the theme song.

37:57.360 --> 38:03.440
And I think that's an issue anyway, although it should, can you imagine if it

38:03.440 --> 38:08.760
had like a death metal version of Dolly Parton's nine to five, get the Setsuna

38:08.760 --> 38:11.920
girl, uh, to sing the Dolly Parton nine to five.

38:11.960 --> 38:12.480
Perfect.

38:13.120 --> 38:15.200
Uh, that weird West look kind of cool.

38:15.240 --> 38:19.560
Bobby is saying the untitled shark game that now has a title man-eater.

38:20.000 --> 38:21.400
That did look hilarious.

38:21.480 --> 38:24.360
Did you see that with the sharks eating the people, but you play as the shark.

38:27.840 --> 38:29.800
That's a game up dark soccer's alley as well.

38:29.880 --> 38:32.960
Don't you want to play a game where, but you're the shark and you kill people.

38:33.080 --> 38:33.800
That sounds like fun.

38:33.800 --> 38:34.200
Doesn't it?

38:34.280 --> 38:36.880
Wasn't that like the old Jaws game that they had?

38:36.880 --> 38:39.200
You could play as we don't, we don't talk about that.

38:39.200 --> 38:39.480
Logie.

38:40.240 --> 38:41.080
That one is all right.

38:41.800 --> 38:47.240
But it was it the awkward, the awkwardness that is the Wolf Among Us two, a telltale

38:47.240 --> 38:49.680
series, except that studio doesn't exist anymore.

38:49.880 --> 38:50.480
Oh yeah.

38:50.480 --> 38:51.720
The Wolf Among Us two that's it.

38:51.720 --> 38:55.120
Because now the original Wolf Among Us is a free on Epic game store for one.

38:55.400 --> 38:58.040
But yeah, very, very interesting.

38:58.040 --> 39:00.840
I hope at a later time, we can really take a deep dive into that.

39:01.160 --> 39:05.680
And, uh, what that all means with the fact that, you know, you had this studio that

39:05.680 --> 39:08.520
was working on it, that effect effectively was shut down.

39:08.760 --> 39:11.480
And now this other studio kind of takes it over.

39:11.640 --> 39:15.040
And although there might be some people that were on the old project, they're on

39:15.040 --> 39:15.840
the new project.

39:16.040 --> 39:18.080
There's some people out there that have kind of moved on.

39:18.080 --> 39:20.840
And so it's like, almost like you're seeing somebody else raise your kid.

39:21.000 --> 39:25.080
I know that's a really extreme perspective, but that is like the sense.

39:25.080 --> 39:26.760
That would be the only way I would have a kid.

39:27.000 --> 39:33.480
So, uh, so yeah, it's, uh, is it, but I mean, if we just look at it on a pure

39:33.480 --> 39:36.600
superficial level of, Oh, the game is coming and the game is happening.

39:36.760 --> 39:39.720
I think a lot of people are very excited that Wolf Among Us is getting a sequel

39:39.720 --> 39:40.240
after all.

39:40.240 --> 39:42.720
So there is that anyway.

39:43.160 --> 39:44.200
Um, let's see.

39:44.240 --> 39:46.600
Um, what else I want to say about trailers?

39:46.600 --> 39:46.880
Dang.

39:46.880 --> 39:48.320
There was one other one I was going to mention.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.200
Oh, well, I forget in the moment.

39:50.240 --> 39:51.320
I'm sure it'll come to me later.

39:51.680 --> 39:51.960
Anyway.

39:51.960 --> 39:53.800
So I, I was a fan of the game awards.

39:54.040 --> 39:55.920
Oh, I want to mention the music performances.

39:56.280 --> 39:59.600
You know, usually music performances are kind of like, why?

39:59.960 --> 40:03.040
Or it's like, we just got this band cause we could, and it was cool.

40:03.040 --> 40:04.200
Yes, exactly.

40:04.200 --> 40:06.240
The, the one that they did for cyberpunk.

40:06.840 --> 40:07.080
Yeah.

40:07.080 --> 40:07.760
The awesome.

40:07.960 --> 40:11.040
So when it first started, I was like, why is Grimes performing?

40:11.040 --> 40:11.800
What's the point?

40:11.800 --> 40:15.680
And she's like, she's not even a good lip-syncer, but then it was like, Oh,

40:15.680 --> 40:19.520
Grimes has a song on the cyberpunk soundtrack and the song was pretty good.

40:19.760 --> 40:24.560
And the little preview role for the soundtrack was pretty diverse with, you

40:24.560 --> 40:28.240
know, you had some rap artists, you had some electro artists, you had, you had a

40:28.240 --> 40:29.920
really broad range of stuff in there.

40:29.920 --> 40:30.480
So it looked interesting.

40:30.960 --> 40:31.320
Yeah.

40:31.600 --> 40:32.320
So there was that.

40:32.680 --> 40:36.720
Um, and, uh, yes, the final fantasy seven remake trailer.

40:36.720 --> 40:37.320
Yes, there was that.

40:37.320 --> 40:39.880
It was a lot of the same stuff, but I'm still very hyped about that game.

40:40.360 --> 40:41.600
Um, music performances.

40:41.600 --> 40:42.760
I thought churches did great.

40:42.800 --> 40:44.680
I loved the orchestra with churches.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.360
I loved the orchestra.

40:46.360 --> 40:47.720
They did this like they did last year.

40:47.720 --> 40:51.920
They did a medley of the game of the year nominees, the orchestra, and it was great.

40:52.320 --> 40:55.440
Um, very, it was very good this year, just like it was last year.

40:55.440 --> 40:58.160
But then they had the orchestra playing with churches and that was gorgeous.

40:58.160 --> 41:01.040
That was the open air for the official show is, uh, churches doing death

41:01.040 --> 41:02.080
stranding with the orchestra.

41:02.080 --> 41:02.680
I love that.

41:02.920 --> 41:04.080
And then a green day.

41:04.480 --> 41:08.560
And for most of the green day performance, I was like, they are just, they just got

41:08.560 --> 41:10.360
green day to perform because it's green day.

41:10.600 --> 41:14.560
But then, and again, as we're watching it live, I'm like, Bobby, do you notice that

41:14.560 --> 41:19.520
Beat Saber is playing behind them and green day is etched into the wall in Beat Saber?

41:19.920 --> 41:24.200
Oh, dream day is the next band getting Beat Saber packs.

41:24.200 --> 41:28.120
And sure enough, that was the announcement is that now we not only have what Imagine

41:28.120 --> 41:31.680
Dragons, I think was it Panic at the Disco had a set or was it?

41:31.680 --> 41:32.000
Yeah.

41:32.000 --> 41:32.280
Yeah.

41:32.440 --> 41:37.520
And then, uh, now we have, um, uh, green day as an official Beat Saber, uh, DLC.

41:37.600 --> 41:40.920
So that's, um, yeah, it was a very busy night.

41:41.800 --> 41:46.120
Those good stuff, especially with no, um, official Sony event in December, you know,

41:46.120 --> 41:48.240
all those trailers and announcements have to go somewhere.

41:48.240 --> 41:51.880
And I know later in the show, we've talking about little things from Sony and Nintendo

41:51.880 --> 41:55.600
that had some trailers and some big stuff, but you know, nothing that had really the

41:55.600 --> 41:58.960
volume that we saw at the game awards, big, big stuff.

41:59.280 --> 42:00.960
All right, let's move on.

42:01.000 --> 42:01.960
I know it was a busy week.

42:01.960 --> 42:05.520
Let's talk about our gaming weeks and the types of video games that we have been playing

42:05.520 --> 42:06.040
this week.

42:06.040 --> 42:07.800
And we'll start with Dark Sakura.

42:07.800 --> 42:08.560
How was your gaming week?

42:08.680 --> 42:10.760
Pokemon sword only a little bit.

42:11.080 --> 42:14.680
And then I've been playing Pokemon go animal crossing pocket camp.

42:15.280 --> 42:20.360
Um, uh, idle pouring, uh, the Harry Potter thingy.

42:21.160 --> 42:25.280
Um, I just haven't had a super, I tried to play the Sims.

42:25.280 --> 42:26.640
I'm going to get my computer crashed.

42:26.640 --> 42:32.680
So that's why I also haven't picked up, um, uh, Detroit become human, even though I really

42:32.680 --> 42:36.040
like to play it at just not feasible for me right now.

42:36.040 --> 42:40.160
Not until I replace my computer or at least figure out what's making it crash.

42:40.760 --> 42:43.600
I mean, I may be ready for a new motherboard, so we'll see.

42:44.680 --> 42:51.200
Um, but other than that, just, you know, the usual, I haven't really had a lot of time

42:51.200 --> 42:57.840
for things getting ready for, excuse me, like I did some baking and I sent, uh, a gift to

42:57.840 --> 42:59.400
our friend in Canada.

43:01.160 --> 43:02.080
How many, Mr.

43:02.200 --> 43:02.880
The real one.

43:03.280 --> 43:04.480
Yes, yes, of course.

43:05.200 --> 43:11.960
And, um, I, uh, I, I, I'll, I'll, I'll let him see it when it arrives, but it's things

43:11.960 --> 43:15.320
that I understand are not easy to obtain in the great white north.

43:15.440 --> 43:15.840
Okay.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.360
So you send them some in and out.

43:18.200 --> 43:20.600
No, I sent those some of my own cookies.

43:21.080 --> 43:23.600
I also sent our friend, the seg, some cookies.

43:23.880 --> 43:24.360
Oh, great.

43:24.760 --> 43:28.160
So I have been baking and I have more people to bake for.

43:28.160 --> 43:33.400
So, um, if I walk around smelling like, you know, sugar and creme de menthe, that's probably

43:33.400 --> 43:35.880
why either that or just gave up and started drinking the creme de menthe.

43:37.440 --> 43:38.120
It happens.

43:38.560 --> 43:38.920
All right.

43:38.920 --> 43:39.840
Especially when I bake.

43:40.200 --> 43:41.480
Uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

43:42.640 --> 43:46.200
Um, so I didn't really play anything.

43:46.360 --> 43:50.280
No, I've been mainly working on my game and stuff.

43:50.280 --> 43:56.120
So I, uh, got to the point where in my procedural generation stuff, I was trying

43:56.120 --> 44:01.240
to make it so that I can have the players go through like the maze.

44:01.240 --> 44:05.120
That is a level in a way that would kind of take them towards the end with a little

44:05.120 --> 44:09.000
bit of meandering through, um, that was pretty hard to do.

44:09.040 --> 44:11.480
And so I decided I'm not doing that.

44:11.480 --> 44:14.240
And I'm just going to let you wonder where in the hell you want, because then it opens

44:14.240 --> 44:17.280
up the opportunity to put like secret rooms and fun stuff like that.

44:17.280 --> 44:19.520
So that also made my job a lot easier.

44:19.520 --> 44:22.840
It means I can move on to the next thing I'm going to do, which is actually, um,

44:22.880 --> 44:25.320
procedurally generating the rooms themselves.

44:25.680 --> 44:30.920
And then along with that, the enemies that spawn the room and that sort of thing.

44:30.920 --> 44:34.280
So that's where I got to this week is that, that, and I've been

44:34.280 --> 44:36.200
working a little bit on artwork.

44:36.200 --> 44:40.920
Um, I was doing some pixel art stuff that I was like sharing out and

44:40.920 --> 44:44.160
Twitter and stuff for t-shirt designs.

44:44.640 --> 44:46.600
So, all right.

44:47.080 --> 44:47.440
Awesome.

44:47.600 --> 44:47.840
Yeah.

44:48.080 --> 44:48.280
Good.

44:48.880 --> 44:50.240
Um, let's see my gaming week.

44:50.240 --> 44:53.320
So my weekend was dominated with mobile phone GPS games.

44:53.520 --> 44:56.440
Cause we had Pokemon go community day, Saturday and Sunday.

44:56.640 --> 45:00.040
I played the entire three hours Saturday and I played about two hours today

45:00.040 --> 45:01.440
before I finally got burned out.

45:01.640 --> 45:04.480
But, uh, it was nice because I was able to get some of the shinies that I

45:04.480 --> 45:06.000
completely missed out on the first time.

45:06.000 --> 45:09.040
So I've like four shiny mudkips where I had zero before.

45:09.320 --> 45:13.080
And I got a, I got a shiny trap inch, which I had zero of those before.

45:13.080 --> 45:15.600
So, um, I was, I was happy to catch up on that.

45:15.600 --> 45:18.240
In fact, the mudkip, I got a three-star appraisal one.

45:18.240 --> 45:19.360
So that made me very, very happy.

45:19.400 --> 45:21.440
I got a couple of shinies too, from work.

45:21.760 --> 45:22.520
Oh, well, hey.

45:22.600 --> 45:24.680
Only one of each things that I never got before.

45:24.920 --> 45:25.920
Say, Hey, it's something.

45:26.080 --> 45:26.600
Yeah.

45:26.840 --> 45:30.160
So are they just, do they just like bump up the level of shinies?

45:31.320 --> 45:31.880
What do you mean?

45:32.040 --> 45:37.240
On, um, they boost them specifically between 11 AM and 2 PM during the, during

45:37.240 --> 45:37.840
this weekend.

45:38.240 --> 45:42.600
Um, but the actual Pokemon that were part of the community days, they're

45:42.600 --> 45:44.440
all increased everywhere.

45:44.440 --> 45:47.360
So you just by nature have a better chance of finding those shinies.

45:47.360 --> 45:49.160
Cause there's more of those Pokemon out in the wild.

45:49.640 --> 45:53.200
Um, but I actually, I dual wielded community day on Saturday.

45:53.200 --> 45:56.560
And what I mean by that is that I was actually Bluetooth catching for Pokemon.

45:56.800 --> 46:00.760
And I was playing Harry Potter community day on my phone because, uh, Harry Potter

46:00.760 --> 46:05.400
Wu or Wizards Unite had their community day and I kind of hit the pedal to the

46:05.400 --> 46:06.080
metal on that.

46:06.080 --> 46:07.280
I gained two levels.

46:07.280 --> 46:12.120
So I'm level 29 now and, uh, you know, got, I finished all the little quests you

46:12.120 --> 46:13.520
had to do that day and all that stuff.

46:13.760 --> 46:17.480
So I got a Totodile and a Swinub.

46:18.000 --> 46:18.400
Fun.

46:18.600 --> 46:19.360
They're both green.

46:19.560 --> 46:21.280
Swinubs look like a little watermelon.

46:21.480 --> 46:21.920
They're cute.

46:22.080 --> 46:22.560
Yeah.

46:23.200 --> 46:25.840
Um, and let's see.

46:25.880 --> 46:27.520
Um, uh, what else?

46:27.520 --> 46:28.720
So I did Harry Potter.

46:28.720 --> 46:32.760
And then last night I went out with my Ingress buddies and we just, we, uh, there's

46:32.760 --> 46:35.280
like a group of us that all kind of live here locally in the neighborhood.

46:35.280 --> 46:38.560
And we were in a chat and we're like, let's go to the Olive Garden.

46:38.600 --> 46:42.080
So we, we decided to go, well, here's the punchline.

46:42.080 --> 46:45.240
So, so, and then of course, as we're driving to Olive Garden, it's like, I have

46:45.240 --> 46:46.880
this mobile full of Ingress players.

46:47.000 --> 46:51.040
So as we're driving, it's like, we're turning everything like our color and all

46:51.040 --> 46:51.440
that stuff.

46:51.720 --> 46:55.560
Um, but then the funny thing was, um, the way to Olive Garden was like an hour.

46:55.680 --> 46:57.520
So we went to the second best restaurant.

46:57.520 --> 47:01.880
We went to Red Lobster, which I hadn't been there.

47:02.360 --> 47:05.680
In Red Lobster far exceeds all our biscuits.

47:05.720 --> 47:06.120
Yes.

47:06.120 --> 47:06.880
Cause I got to have the business.

47:07.080 --> 47:09.920
The only bummer is though, Olive Garden has a portal.

47:09.960 --> 47:11.080
Red Lobster does not.

47:11.320 --> 47:15.440
So there was no hacking during dinner, but then we went out and did some more and we

47:15.440 --> 47:16.200
were going to stop.

47:16.240 --> 47:18.480
And then one of the other players started taking down what we were doing.

47:18.480 --> 47:21.400
So we were like rampage raw and went through the neighborhood.

47:21.400 --> 47:23.640
Just, just having fun and chatting and being nerds.

47:23.680 --> 47:27.800
So I had a very full, uh, cell phone gaming weekend, but I did play some of the

47:27.800 --> 47:31.360
traditional stuff too, still playing Final Fantasy 14, little bit of Pokemon.

47:31.360 --> 47:33.840
I did a stream earlier this week, just trying to fill out the decks a little

47:33.840 --> 47:37.400
more, doing the raid, still trying to get that goddamn Gigantamax Snorlax.

47:37.400 --> 47:40.880
I still don't have, but I pretty much told Shane, I'm going to make him trade me

47:40.880 --> 47:42.000
one if I don't catch one.

47:42.000 --> 47:45.840
And, uh, he has like 17, so it's not going to be a problem, uh, on three different

47:45.840 --> 47:46.520
accounts, I'm sure.

47:46.520 --> 47:50.800
So, um, yeah, so just making progress in those games.

47:50.960 --> 47:54.560
I think a little bit of Death Stranding, but I really, I really need to like sit

47:54.560 --> 47:57.680
down and play Death Stranding if I ever want to actually beat it.

47:57.680 --> 47:59.320
Cause I'm not very far into the game right now.

47:59.320 --> 48:04.600
And one of my friends said he finally gave up after chapter five and watched an 11

48:04.680 --> 48:09.160
hour movie that was all the cut scenes after chapter five.

48:09.160 --> 48:12.400
And I'm like, geez, I got a lot to go.

48:12.640 --> 48:15.360
So anyway, that was my gaming week.

48:15.680 --> 48:19.000
So, uh, let's get into some gaming news now.

48:19.000 --> 48:20.480
I think, uh, we're ready for that.

48:20.760 --> 48:24.320
Uh, as far as show schedule, uh, because usually we do housekeeping here too.

48:24.600 --> 48:26.280
Uh, we should be here.

48:26.280 --> 48:28.280
I don't think we're missing any shows for the holidays.

48:28.680 --> 48:32.880
The next show we'll be missing is on January 19th, which is a Martin Luther

48:32.880 --> 48:33.520
King weekend.

48:33.520 --> 48:37.760
We won't be here live that night, but we should be taped in one way or another.

48:37.760 --> 48:39.200
We may actually go live earlier in the day.

48:39.200 --> 48:40.720
I think we were looking at doing that potentially.

48:40.720 --> 48:42.800
So yes, my kids are very excited.

48:43.040 --> 48:43.600
Oh boy.

48:44.120 --> 48:46.080
So are they going to behave for three hours?

48:46.120 --> 48:46.440
Nope.

48:46.720 --> 48:47.240
Oh boy.

48:47.280 --> 48:49.280
I mean, I'm just saying that because nope.

48:50.640 --> 48:51.040
All right.

48:51.840 --> 48:53.360
Anyhow, let's move on.

48:53.360 --> 48:56.840
Let's get into, uh, other gaming news and what's going on in the gaming world.

48:56.840 --> 48:58.240
It wasn't just the game awards, right?

48:58.240 --> 48:58.680
The stuff, right?

48:58.680 --> 49:00.880
They had the state of play this week as well.

49:00.880 --> 49:05.760
So, um, basically some of the announcements we knew were coming.

49:05.760 --> 49:10.960
So, uh, nothing too, um, surprising with the resident evil three remake

49:10.960 --> 49:14.120
announcements coming out in PlayStation four, April 3rd.

49:14.640 --> 49:19.880
Uh, we've got the kingdom hearts three DLC expansion with new characters.

49:19.960 --> 49:25.400
Uh, that's coming out on the 23rd of January and then untitled goose game is

49:25.400 --> 49:30.360
going to be coming to PlayStation four on December 17th, so right around the corner

49:30.720 --> 49:35.920
dreams, which they recently pulled the early access beta version that you could

49:35.920 --> 49:41.320
purchase a thing was last week and I missed out on that, but the full game will

49:41.320 --> 49:43.160
be coming out on February 14th.

49:43.560 --> 49:47.680
So that's something that was announced spell break a new battle royale game.

49:47.800 --> 49:53.400
Um, they said combining role playing and magic combat is starting a closed beta.

49:53.800 --> 49:59.120
Uh, they showed off some VR stuff, a paper beast, and then there was a new

49:59.120 --> 50:04.880
predator game coming out, April 24th, and apparently from Square Enix and

50:04.880 --> 50:10.360
platinum Babylon's fall, uh, it's a new action game that mixes, uh, was it

50:10.360 --> 50:16.520
medieval and fancy it's sci-fi and then subliminal, which is a perspective

50:16.680 --> 50:20.560
bending physics game that they've got coming on the PlayStation four.

50:20.880 --> 50:25.400
And then last but not least, um, they showed a little bit of, uh, goes to

50:25.400 --> 50:29.440
shoe SEMA, which they showed a longer trailer during the game awards for that.

50:30.000 --> 50:33.080
Um, but yeah, so that's basically everything in it's announced.

50:33.080 --> 50:37.600
So, um, very interested to see when dreams comes out.

50:37.600 --> 50:39.760
Cause I think that's going to be a game that catches a lot of people off guard.

50:39.800 --> 50:42.360
Yeah, I definitely want to check out dreams when it's officially out.

50:42.360 --> 50:46.160
That's already, I think maybe a possible game of the year contender for next year.

50:46.400 --> 50:48.600
Maybe just if the early buzz is any indication.

50:48.600 --> 50:50.000
I mean, uh, it looks interesting.

50:50.040 --> 50:50.800
Yeah, it really does.

50:50.800 --> 50:52.040
So I'm, I'm all about that.

50:52.080 --> 50:55.200
The, um, what was the battle royale that was RPG kind of base?

50:55.240 --> 50:57.120
That's a spellbreak spellbreak.

50:57.160 --> 50:57.320
Yeah.

50:57.320 --> 50:58.360
That sounds really interesting too.

50:58.400 --> 51:02.200
So, um, yeah, you battle, right?

51:02.200 --> 51:04.120
The battle royale genre is just not going away.

51:04.360 --> 51:06.000
I know we have another story coming up a little later.

51:06.000 --> 51:06.320
Yes.

51:06.320 --> 51:08.600
Another, yes, that, that one looked interesting.

51:08.600 --> 51:08.880
Yeah.

51:08.880 --> 51:11.920
So there's this, uh, no shortage of games there, although, uh, it

51:11.920 --> 51:13.280
didn't make the show world tonight.

51:13.280 --> 51:16.120
And I don't think this game was battle royale per se, but I

51:16.120 --> 51:19.840
know I was looking at our discord over at vognetwork.com slash discord.

51:19.840 --> 51:23.560
And I saw that there was, um, uh, a comment about this and I

51:23.560 --> 51:24.360
thought it was interesting.

51:24.360 --> 51:26.800
It's a game that, uh, planetside arena.

51:26.800 --> 51:27.320
That was it.

51:27.600 --> 51:32.160
It just like, it just came out in early access and like September and they've

51:32.160 --> 51:34.480
already announced it's closing in January.

51:34.680 --> 51:39.120
And there's a comment here, uh, a quote from the article, apparently the month

51:39.120 --> 51:41.720
that debuted, it had 474 players.

51:41.920 --> 51:44.320
And as of right now, when somebody was writing the article, there were

51:44.320 --> 51:45.600
three people playing the game.

51:45.640 --> 51:53.160
That was like the, um, what was that one that was by, um, I think I did twisted

51:53.160 --> 51:57.680
metal, um, I don't remember his name, but like there was, remember that one battle

51:57.680 --> 52:00.480
royale game that was like an eighties kind of throwback thing.

52:00.480 --> 52:04.040
And then they had like bikes and stuff in there.

52:04.040 --> 52:07.440
Like it was, it was something that came out around E3 and then just

52:07.440 --> 52:08.840
like died in like two months.

52:09.240 --> 52:11.760
It was like the, the sketchbook looking thing, right?

52:11.800 --> 52:12.760
No, no, no, no, no, not that.

52:12.760 --> 52:13.800
But he did that as well.

52:14.120 --> 52:14.720
David Jeff.

52:14.720 --> 52:14.880
Yeah.

52:14.880 --> 52:15.440
Did that.

52:15.480 --> 52:18.360
Um, he did that game, but then there was another one.

52:18.400 --> 52:18.960
No, no, no.

52:18.960 --> 52:19.400
I'm sorry.

52:19.400 --> 52:21.840
I'm confusing David Jeff with, um, not him.

52:21.920 --> 52:23.840
Um, God damn it.

52:24.760 --> 52:25.760
The guy that did gears.

52:25.840 --> 52:28.360
Um, Oh, cliffy cliffy V.

52:28.360 --> 52:28.720
Yes.

52:28.760 --> 52:34.920
Uh, so his game, yeah, it's not David Jaffe, but his game that was that weird,

52:34.920 --> 52:37.800
like, I don't remember the hell is called now, but it was some battle

52:37.800 --> 52:41.640
royale game that came out around the time that, you know, Fortnite was

52:41.640 --> 52:45.720
doing really well and it just didn't take off like it died within two

52:45.720 --> 52:48.520
months in the early access law breakers.

52:48.560 --> 52:49.160
Yes.

52:49.160 --> 52:49.600
That's it.

52:49.600 --> 52:50.320
Start to Tetsuya.

52:50.320 --> 52:50.760
That was it.

52:50.760 --> 52:51.400
No, no, no.

52:51.400 --> 52:52.680
That was another one too.

52:52.680 --> 52:54.680
But there was law breakers died too.

52:54.680 --> 52:59.320
That was, that was more of a hero shooter game that, um, the battle

52:59.320 --> 53:02.440
royale one I'm thinking though, was it wasn't law breakers.

53:02.440 --> 53:04.840
It was, um, God damn it.

53:04.840 --> 53:05.680
Now we have to look it up.

53:06.840 --> 53:09.920
Uh, but yeah, quest buster and chat says that from what I gathered planet

53:09.960 --> 53:11.840
side arena was nothing the fans asked for.

53:11.840 --> 53:13.280
They wanted planet side three.

53:13.320 --> 53:14.600
Yeah, there's that.

53:14.760 --> 53:17.960
Uh, Shane's mentioning the David Jaffe game was drawn to death.

53:18.360 --> 53:18.880
No, no, no.

53:18.920 --> 53:19.760
Not that one either.

53:19.840 --> 53:22.760
That was another, that's another game that was PlayStation.

53:22.800 --> 53:25.840
I don't think that lasted very long either, but that had the life

53:25.840 --> 53:27.000
of about a year and a half probably.

53:27.080 --> 53:27.520
It was.

53:27.520 --> 53:28.480
Yeah, it was.

53:28.520 --> 53:29.440
That one was all right.

53:29.440 --> 53:31.680
It, um, that had an interesting heights.

53:31.680 --> 53:32.200
Many people.

53:32.200 --> 53:32.640
Thank you.

53:32.640 --> 53:32.920
Yes.

53:32.920 --> 53:33.600
Radical heights.

53:33.600 --> 53:34.200
That's the one.

53:34.200 --> 53:34.600
Yes.

53:34.920 --> 53:35.320
There you go.

53:35.560 --> 53:35.880
All right.

53:35.880 --> 53:36.360
You got it.

53:36.800 --> 53:38.560
Anyway, finally got there.

53:39.040 --> 53:39.560
All right.

53:39.560 --> 53:42.680
Well, uh, yeah, so battle royale, I mean, all these developers kind of

53:42.680 --> 53:45.680
want to hit on that Fortnite money, but you know, some, some are doing

53:45.680 --> 53:47.320
well, but some not so well.

53:47.320 --> 53:48.280
So, um, yeah.

53:48.880 --> 53:51.480
Anyway, um, delayed games.

53:51.520 --> 53:54.200
So, you know, sometimes when we would hear about game delays,

53:54.200 --> 53:55.240
we'd be really bummed out.

53:55.240 --> 53:58.040
But I think as we've learned over the years, game delays are often

53:58.040 --> 54:00.200
good news because that means the game is not gonna be garbage.

54:00.240 --> 54:00.480
Yes.

54:00.480 --> 54:03.680
Because we've seen some of the games that have hurried to get out on

54:03.680 --> 54:06.000
time and they've not turned out well.

54:06.400 --> 54:06.960
Andromeda.

54:07.480 --> 54:10.840
Oh, speaking of which I was going to mention, you, you know, one of

54:10.840 --> 54:15.000
those games that we think about Anthem like that, I saw it down the

54:15.000 --> 54:18.520
five bucks for the collector's edition.

54:18.680 --> 54:20.760
$5.

54:20.760 --> 54:21.160
Not surprised.

54:21.160 --> 54:23.760
I'm pretty sure I've seen it at $5 as well.

54:23.800 --> 54:26.960
Like I think at target on their little backside of the shelf, that's

54:26.960 --> 54:27.560
ridiculous.

54:27.560 --> 54:28.480
I saw it for five bucks.

54:28.480 --> 54:28.760
Yeah.

54:28.840 --> 54:30.720
So yeah.

54:30.800 --> 54:31.120
Anyway.

54:31.320 --> 54:34.320
Uh, but what's been delays that hopefully they can sell it for more

54:34.320 --> 54:38.880
than $5, uh, it was a final fantasy crystal chronicles has been, uh,

54:38.880 --> 54:39.840
there was, yeah, right.

54:39.880 --> 54:40.600
That is coming.

54:40.640 --> 54:42.160
Uh, and there was a series of tweets.

54:42.200 --> 54:45.040
Um, then they said, uh, since announcing final fantasy crystal

54:45.040 --> 54:47.680
chronicles, we've received so many positive messages filled with

54:47.680 --> 54:50.120
encouragement, but today we're announcing the release date for the

54:50.120 --> 54:52.240
game is being moved to summer 2020.

54:52.440 --> 54:55.280
We made the decision to adjust the release date to allow the development

54:55.280 --> 54:57.880
team some extra time to make final adjustments to the game, to make the

54:57.880 --> 54:59.280
best experience possible.

54:59.600 --> 55:02.800
Uh, final fantasy crystal chronicles remastered is coming to PS four,

55:02.840 --> 55:05.160
Nintendo switch, iOS, and Android devices.

55:05.360 --> 55:07.880
You'll be able to play online with your friends and transfer your save

55:07.880 --> 55:12.840
file across all four platforms when the game launches in summer 2020.

55:12.840 --> 55:16.400
So, and they put out a new trailer, uh, just to remind you that it is still

55:16.400 --> 55:16.880
coming.

55:17.120 --> 55:18.160
Uh, I remember.

55:18.200 --> 55:18.440
Okay.

55:18.440 --> 55:20.880
So that was when I lived with you.

55:21.160 --> 55:23.920
We had the game cube with the game boy advanced adapters.

55:23.920 --> 55:25.800
Cause that was where Chris Chronicles originally was.

55:26.120 --> 55:28.320
I remember we played some of that and that game was fun.

55:28.760 --> 55:31.960
Not with me, but that may have been shame.

55:31.960 --> 55:33.440
Maybe, or some people would come over.

55:33.440 --> 55:34.160
We would play that.

55:34.200 --> 55:36.280
I think I was dating a guy at the time that had it too.

55:36.280 --> 55:37.480
And we were playing through that a little bit.

55:37.480 --> 55:39.240
So yeah, I don't think I've ever played that game.

55:39.520 --> 55:39.960
Really?

55:40.240 --> 55:43.240
No, cause there was, I remember the one, I remember selling the one that

55:43.240 --> 55:47.720
was on the Wii and DS that had interconnectivity that way too.

55:47.960 --> 55:48.280
Hmm.

55:49.640 --> 55:52.680
Uh, Shane's and chat saying this delay made me sad.

55:52.680 --> 55:55.640
I was hoping to hold the chalice and keep it from everyone else next month.

55:55.920 --> 55:58.560
But it's, this is the good news because you want it to work.

55:58.560 --> 56:01.720
You want to be successful and not buggy and crashy and all that stuff.

56:01.960 --> 56:03.960
Especially when they're talking, you don't want to hold the chalice and have

56:03.960 --> 56:05.560
that child's corrupt your character save.

56:05.560 --> 56:07.560
And then yes, you don't want that to happen.

56:07.560 --> 56:10.320
So it's probably for the best that this was delayed a little bit.

56:10.400 --> 56:13.760
So anyhow, moving on dark soccer, there was a pretty big event this weekend

56:13.760 --> 56:16.200
in a game that I don't think any of the three of us play regularly.

56:16.400 --> 56:17.760
Nope, but I thought it was cool.

56:18.000 --> 56:20.320
So, uh, Fortnite had some fun stuff happen.

56:20.720 --> 56:25.480
Basically, uh, JJ Abrams showed up in the millennium Falcon in game.

56:26.120 --> 56:30.680
And a big screen fell from the sky and showed a clip of rise of Skywalker.

56:31.400 --> 56:33.160
So that's cool.

56:33.440 --> 56:35.560
And then after that, guess what happened next?

56:36.440 --> 56:38.960
The world went back to being a black hole and disappeared.

56:38.960 --> 56:42.360
Everyone got lightsabers and then it went to being a black hole.

56:43.440 --> 56:47.440
And you also now have a Rey and Finn skins in the game.

56:48.000 --> 56:53.560
And, um, but yeah, so I want to go and see if I can just find like

56:53.560 --> 56:55.480
clips of the recording or whatever.

56:55.680 --> 56:57.200
Oh, it's just everywhere on YouTube.

56:57.200 --> 56:57.680
I'm sure.

56:57.680 --> 56:58.680
I just haven't bothered.

56:58.720 --> 57:01.160
So, um, but yeah, advertised on Twitch pretty heavily too.

57:01.160 --> 57:04.200
They've got like all kinds of shit all over Fortnite anyway, now

57:04.200 --> 57:06.200
like skins and themes and stuff.

57:06.760 --> 57:08.640
But yeah, so basically.

57:09.600 --> 57:13.720
JJ Abrams flew in in the millennium Falcon and showed some movies.

57:14.080 --> 57:15.680
Uh, Bobby Black Wolf is pointing out.

57:15.680 --> 57:17.680
This is a lot like what some VR things do.

57:17.680 --> 57:20.760
Altspace VR and VR chat have done this type of stuff before.

57:21.040 --> 57:21.240
Yeah.

57:21.240 --> 57:24.480
It's interesting that it's, it's in a game like Fortnite, which most of us

57:24.480 --> 57:28.040
think of as a shooty shooter, battle royale, Minecraft meets guns.

57:28.080 --> 57:28.720
Popular.

57:28.720 --> 57:31.760
And yeah, I think because of its popularity, but yeah, I mean, this

57:31.760 --> 57:36.280
type of thing is like the type of thing in like second life or PlayStation home.

57:36.440 --> 57:39.840
Remember when you could visit the virtual PlayStation booth and PlayStation

57:39.840 --> 57:44.000
home and they would show like PlayStation trailers and stuff like that was a thing.

57:44.000 --> 57:45.600
But I think let's be real.

57:45.640 --> 57:49.840
There's millions more people in Fortnite than there ever was in PlayStation home.

57:49.880 --> 57:52.640
They also had though, as an added bonus.

57:52.640 --> 57:56.880
So it's Ben, Ben Schwartz was, um, there as one of the storm

57:56.880 --> 57:59.320
troopers and goofing around.

57:59.360 --> 57:59.760
Oh, really?

57:59.760 --> 58:04.520
So another skin in here is the Sith trooper and you get a first

58:04.520 --> 58:08.040
order tie fighter are some other things that are new in game.

58:08.040 --> 58:08.280
Oh yeah.

58:08.280 --> 58:08.800
The gliders.

58:09.320 --> 58:09.600
Yeah.

58:09.600 --> 58:10.480
That looked pretty cool.

58:10.560 --> 58:12.880
Um, I watched the clip and it was lame.

58:13.440 --> 58:14.360
What was the clip?

58:14.560 --> 58:20.040
The clip was basically it's, it was, uh, Rey Finn and I remember the other dude.

58:20.080 --> 58:20.480
Po.

58:20.640 --> 58:20.960
Po.

58:20.960 --> 58:21.200
Yes.

58:21.200 --> 58:21.520
Thank you.

58:21.520 --> 58:23.720
And they were, don't you ever forget his name.

58:24.280 --> 58:25.160
I would die for him.

58:25.280 --> 58:25.880
I'm sorry.

58:25.880 --> 58:26.800
I remember the face.

58:26.800 --> 58:27.560
It's not the name.

58:27.600 --> 58:27.880
Okay.

58:27.920 --> 58:28.840
It's distracting.

58:28.840 --> 58:34.760
So, um, so anyways, so they break into what looks to be a ship of some sort and

58:34.760 --> 58:37.520
they're running through, they're shooting storm troopers and then these storm

58:37.520 --> 58:42.800
troopers confront them and Rey does her Jedi mind trick to like tell them, Hey,

58:42.800 --> 58:43.840
we're supposed to be here.

58:43.840 --> 58:45.320
And they're like, yeah, they're supposed to be there.

58:45.480 --> 58:46.080
And that was it.

58:46.080 --> 58:47.280
It was a really short clip.

58:47.360 --> 58:51.200
It had no context into anything else other than, yeah, she did a Jedi mind

58:51.240 --> 58:51.440
trick.

58:51.440 --> 58:51.800
Cool.

58:51.880 --> 58:53.920
Well, they're not going to spoil the goddamn movie.

58:53.920 --> 58:55.000
I mean, you know, it was just,

58:55.320 --> 58:57.840
I wanted to see the clip with Darth Jar Jar.

58:57.840 --> 59:01.200
That was one of the options that they had them fans vote on and everyone should

59:01.200 --> 59:02.600
have voted for Darth Jar Jar.

59:02.840 --> 59:03.240
Damn it.

59:04.200 --> 59:07.480
Uh, Sia Tabiri in chat says, but do you remember Po's last name?

59:07.800 --> 59:08.560
Dameron.

59:08.880 --> 59:09.720
Don't fight me.

59:11.200 --> 59:11.680
Anyway.

59:12.200 --> 59:16.160
Uh, speaking of, um, I forgot to mention this about the game awards and I think

59:16.160 --> 59:20.000
this is a travesty that I would forget to mention this, but, um, Akumi Nakamura,

59:20.560 --> 59:22.240
uh, showing up to present an award.

59:22.480 --> 59:23.360
Love her.

59:23.480 --> 59:26.440
Uh, my favorite thing was the whole, like, uh, what did she say?

59:26.440 --> 59:28.200
She said, please bear with my English.

59:28.200 --> 59:29.960
She goes, please bear with bear.

59:30.000 --> 59:33.880
And she's just like, I, I was, I knew at that point I would take a bullet

59:33.880 --> 59:35.280
for her cause she's incredible.

59:35.560 --> 59:39.760
I, it's, and what it is y'all is the enthusiasm about video games and the

59:39.760 --> 59:42.160
games industry, like games should be fun.

59:42.320 --> 59:46.080
And when you see somebody like her on stage, she is having the time of her

59:46.080 --> 59:49.120
life, she's having fun and that fun is infectious.

59:49.160 --> 59:51.000
And that's, that's great.

59:51.280 --> 59:53.200
You know, star Wars should be fun.

59:53.360 --> 59:54.600
Fortnite should be fun.

59:54.600 --> 59:55.560
Games are fun.

59:55.840 --> 59:59.720
Anyway, I just want to make sure I, uh, got that out at some point.

01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:01.080
All right, let's move on.

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:04.000
Uh, let's talk about battle royale fun.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:04.880
Yes, this is more fun.

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:05.640
This is awesome.

01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:08.800
So I did get to check out, um, the video showing this.

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:14.360
So Forza Horizon 4 is getting a new 72 car battle royale mode.

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:16.880
And you might be thinking, well, how the hell is that going to work?

01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:20.680
So it's this new mode called the eliminator and the way it starts

01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:24.120
off, you're in the map and you basically have 72 final round and guts.

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:27.120
Anyway, that's the agrocrag.

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:28.560
Yeah, that was the eliminator.

01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:30.320
What kid's game show was the eliminator in?

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:31.760
Or am I thinking of the Illuminati?

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:33.400
Maybe the eliminator.

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:35.960
Um, is that like the Illuminati nadir?

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:37.160
What is that?

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:40.840
American gladiators, American gladiators, the, the, yeah.

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:43.440
You know, the American gladiators.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.400
And for some reason I got American gladiators just

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:46.960
confused with Nickelodeon guts.

01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:51.640
I mean, cause guts is sort of like a spin off American gladiators without

01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:55.080
gladiators punching the kids because they did have American gladiator kids,

01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:58.280
which I was always like, they were always so gentle with them.

01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:01.520
But like at the same time, I'm like, dude, just take them out.

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:05.960
Like you got your foam, you know, your giant Q tips of death.

01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:07.640
Just knock that kid on his ass.

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:10.920
Imagine the show now where it's just like the American gladiators

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:12.160
kick the shit out of children.

01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:15.880
And for some reason, I think this is so funny.

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:17.720
I don't know what, although it's probably not.

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:19.600
And everyone's like, how dare you laugh at that?

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:21.000
But it's, it's funny.

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:22.240
Come on.

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:27.600
But we, the kids are the type that like scream during movies and, uh,

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:31.120
you know, are really annoying in restaurants and those types of kids.

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:31.760
Yes.

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:35.640
The ones that have this like complex where they think they're so indestructible

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:39.200
and then you just, you put them up against Blaze and then Blaze just

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:40.480
beats the shit out of them.

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:42.520
Just knocks their fucking ass down.

01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:45.080
Any American gladiators to come back? I know they had a thought.

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:45.680
They did.

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:46.240
They did.

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:48.520
That was almost like 10 years ago at this point,

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:52.920
that revival that was like what Hulk Hogan and Leila Ali was the,

01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:55.520
they were the hosts, right? And they had, uh,

01:01:56.160 --> 01:02:00.080
they had the guy that won the first season came back and he was like the rubber

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:02.200
band. I don't remember what the fuck his name was, but he could,

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:07.080
that wall thing, he just fly up that goddamn wall. So yeah, we need a new,

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:08.720
like we need a new, new American laddiers.

01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:11.840
But here's the thing, if you're not going to be, the thing is the,

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:14.640
the modern American gladiators, like kind of, they kind of,

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:19.320
they try to keep it like half cheesy, but half modernize it. No, no, no, no, no,

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:20.840
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, 100% cheesy,

01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:25.840
100% cheesy outfits that fucking like shine and like,

01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:30.800
you know, and if it's not spandex and it's not sequence, it was like sequence,

01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:35.280
sequence, sequence on the men and the women. Okay.

01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:39.280
All of it. And just, just have that, you know, was,

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:41.000
I don't remember they used to call it with,

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:44.560
was it the gauntlet or whatever with the giant like nerf things that they would

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:48.640
like be shooting? Yes. Yes. And you know what we need, uh, you know,

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:51.160
cause they always would feature, you know, it'd be the men's competition,

01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:52.120
the women's competition,

01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:57.360
but we also need the gender fucking competition that's drag queens as,

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:02.560
um, competitors and uh, the gladiators because let's be real,

01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:06.480
American gladiators are basically drag queens without the lip syncing.

01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:10.000
They need the, they category.

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:13.800
No, of course. But you know,

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:17.480
the, the non gender binary,

01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:20.480
I just think right now it's like they've kind of replaced that with like this

01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:23.600
stupid American ninja warrior bullshit. And

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:27.400
it's, that shit is a real challenge though.

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:31.880
I understand that, but it's not as cheesy and entertaining as like, you know,

01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:35.960
the shit that we see. Like for example, I, I,

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:40.560
I want to say it was Akuma JP. It may have not been somebody on my Twitter,

01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:44.440
posted a video of like a Japanese game show where they had this dude inside of a

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:49.200
balloon and they were having him do different feats of strength that required

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:50.280
him not to pop the balloon.

01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:53.000
And every time he failed because it's a giant balloon, like they,

01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:56.800
they want him to jump, you know, do the high jump or whatever.

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:58.320
And it's just like he couldn't do it,

01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:01.080
but it was hilarious because it looked ridiculous.

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:02.640
That's the kind of TV I want to watch.

01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:06.200
Absolutely. Anyway, we're, we're, we're back to Forza.

01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:13.480
Yes. I love that. And I loved it when they did the really bad dubs. You know,

01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:17.000
it's what they call the most extreme elimination challenge.

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:20.320
I miss that show so much. I love that show.

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:23.760
But seriously, hear me out here. American gladiators, but it's drag queens.

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:28.120
Mimi, I'm first clearly pick you up and drag.

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:30.480
American gladiators, American drag gladiators,

01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:36.520
copyright copyright, patent pending trademark, uh,

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:40.960
property of orange Andreo. All right. Sorry. So, uh, the eliminator,

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:45.080
so way it works is there's 72 players that are on a map. It has, you know,

01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:48.920
of course the, the ring of death that's out there. Um,

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:52.880
so what happens is you're driving around and you start as like a level one car

01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:56.720
that's like a piece of shit car and you challenge other players.

01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:58.760
So when you get close to them, you can do a one-on-one challenge.

01:04:58.760 --> 01:04:59.200
And what it is,

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:02.080
it gives you a point to point race that whoever gets to the end of the race,

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:04.120
you get to trade their car.

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:07.040
You get to take their car if it's a higher level or you can upgrade your own.

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:10.200
So you do that until you get to like level 10,

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:15.160
once it gets all the way down to as small of an area as possible, then,

01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:20.680
um, you do a last point to point race and whoever gets to that point wins.

01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:22.080
But throughout the entire thing,

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:25.640
it's just all these point to point races within the circle. Um,

01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:28.640
it looked really cool. It was like a flash tournament, almost like,

01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:32.000
just like a really fast tournament in a way. Sort of. Yeah. It's just,

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.240
it's kind of, it's kind of crazy and just the way they had it.

01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:38.600
And the other way you can get cars too, is they have like these pickups,

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:42.400
like almost like drops that you can run into and then you get a vehicle pickup.

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:46.200
But, um, so that's one way to do it. But then you can also, you know,

01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:49.400
challenge other players for their cars or upgrade your own if they have like a

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:51.960
shittier car than you. I'm into it. It sounds really fun. I'll check it.

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:55.880
I have four surprise and four. Yeah. I need to play pass and the retail one.

01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:58.480
So I need to check it out. Yeah. So it's a free thing, right?

01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:02.600
It is a free upgrade. So yeah. Nice. We'll have to try that out at some point.

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:04.600
I know Bobby was talking about wanting to play it too. So maybe,

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:08.720
maybe that's a thing we can do on VOG at some point later in the next week or

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:12.240
so. Yeah. Uh, anyway, heading over for some other announcements that came out

01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:14.120
this week. So Nintendo did have some announcements,

01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:16.600
even if they didn't make any first party announcements at the game awards,

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:21.360
but, uh, they did have their own little, um, uh, indie announcement reel.

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:24.520
They did an indie world, basically. So it's kind of like, think like a direct,

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:26.240
but it was all about like indie stuff. Yeah. Uh,

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:29.120
but we did get some pretty big titles that were dropped here. Uh, for example,

01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:33.040
that was dropped or that was launched on the day of the, um, uh,

01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:35.880
press thing or the, the video, uh,

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:38.480
the talus principle deluxe edition came out for steam.

01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:42.760
So that was out and Dauntless came out. I'm sorry. Yes. On switch. My bad.

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:46.160
The other S thing. Uh, so both of those came out on switch, uh,

01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:49.920
with the Nintendo indie world. Uh, so that's pretty cool. Um,

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:52.920
but then there was also other things that were shown. So, um,

01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:56.280
axiom verge two was announced. I don't think I played the first,

01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:59.160
I have the first one. I haven't played it yet. It's basically,

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:00.600
it's like super Metroid,

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:03.400
but like kind of goes a very different direction with like the hacking and

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:07.680
stuff. And like, it's all one guy. Like it's like produced by,

01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:11.280
directed by soundtrack by starred in. It's like the original Halloween,

01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:14.080
you know how like John Carpenter actually did that music and the original

01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:16.040
Halloween. It's like, yeah, iconic. So that's,

01:07:16.080 --> 01:07:17.640
that's basically what axiom verge is.

01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:22.560
So axiom verge two is on its way in fall of 2020. So it's still a ways out,

01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:26.120
but, um, yeah, I can be technically the first one. Yes, exactly. Uh,

01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:29.040
they also kind of give an update on streets or age four and it's coming out in

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:32.040
the first half of 2020. And I know some people are very excited for that game as

01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:34.880
well. Um, I don't have time to talk about everything, but, uh,

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:38.040
definitely check out some of those other games that were, uh, uh,

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:41.680
announced as part of indie world. I know I'm looking forward to axiom verge two,

01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:44.240
uh, maybe sports story, something you might. Yeah.

01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:47.000
Golf story here is really good. It's sports story.

01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:48.880
I know I'm talking about the first one. Oh, right.

01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:52.920
It's creators of golf story. It was the first one in that I hear it was pretty

01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:54.600
good. Um, sports story.

01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:58.120
I do want to check out as well because it sounded pretty awesome. Uh,

01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:02.280
skate bird was another developer that I follow on Twitter. Uh, it looks awesome.

01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:06.480
It's like Tony Hawk with a tiny little bird. It says super cute. And, um,

01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:11.240
just for the name itself, murder by numbers. Yeah.

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:12.960
That sounded interesting as well. Well,

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:15.960
if we're going to go for games with a great title, how about boyfriend dungeon?

01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:20.760
The other one is boyfriend dungeon. It's a dating SIM dungeon crawler.

01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:24.880
So I don't know, dark Sakura, I know you like your crazy dating Sims,

01:08:24.920 --> 01:08:26.080
so maybe this will be something.

01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:28.640
Have you ever wanted to imprison boyfriends in the dungeon?

01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:30.920
I guess that's what this is about. I don't know. Um,

01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:34.080
but you basically you make precious memories with different loves and you use

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:37.920
your combat styles to clear out monsters and uncover the dungeon secrets.

01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:41.240
I, that doesn't mean I'm lucky them in dungeons.

01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:44.840
You might be saving them or something. I don't know.

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:47.760
Dude. So Linda trust. Sure.

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:53.880
Helpless little boys. I like that. All right. So anyway, lots of, uh, indies.

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:57.160
And you know, obviously the switch E-shop has tons and tons and tons of

01:08:57.160 --> 01:08:58.520
independent things on it.

01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:01.600
And that's really what's kind of bolstered that and, uh,

01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:05.080
put it above as far as like how many games are available on it from where even

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:08.560
we, you is that. So that was, um, yeah, that's great. So, all right,

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:09.080
let's move on.

01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:11.320
We have more stories for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week.

01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:12.920
Dark Sakura, what do you have for us next?

01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:16.520
Uh, well, some, uh, GameStop news there,

01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:21.120
as we sometimes call it the evil G. Um, well,

01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:23.760
they look like they were doing okay. And then guess what happened?

01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:30.640
No one's really surprised though. Their, um, uh, revenue,

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:31.440
uh, sorry,

01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:35.440
currency adjusted revenue in the third quarter dropped 24.7%

01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:40.360
percent. Um, and their hardware sales,

01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:46.240
uh, went over 45%. Software was cut by a third and

01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:51.120
accessories and pre-owned were down by 13% each for the

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:53.360
whole period. Um,

01:09:55.480 --> 01:10:00.560
and as far as, you know, in general, they are really,

01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:03.640
really, really just going down. Um,

01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:08.880
they, they're, uh, suffering from some of the, uh,

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:11.920
release, uh, you know, cause now most of their stuff is toys.

01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:14.760
They're really suffering from some releases of some, uh,

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:19.600
relevant franchises is where part of this is going into. But, uh,

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:23.320
the, um, the CEO, uh,

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:28.320
George Sherman is saying that their more important console business

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:33.120
does not look hopeful. And I'll go ahead and read his exact

01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:33.960
quote.

01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:38.360
The unprecedented decline in the new hardware sales seen across the market as

01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:42.120
the current generation of gaming consoles reach the end of their life cycle and

01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:47.120
consumers delay their spending and anticipation of new hardware releases was

01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:48.880
their excuse.

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:53.520
So it sounds like 2020 might be very much a make or break year for GameStop

01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:56.520
because of the new consoles being released. You know, um,

01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:59.280
that's going to be some money for them as these consoles are released.

01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:01.240
They'll get their share as they sell these consoles.

01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:04.280
But who knows how many of those consoles are really going to be sold at a place

01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:05.480
like Amazon and so forth.

01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:09.000
They were projected to have a profit of $11 a share,

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:13.240
but it actually dropped down by 40. It's not $11, sorry,

01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:17.800
11 cents a share. And instead they actually dropped down 49 cents a share.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:18.840
Yikes.

01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:20.720
That's pretty crazy. And I mean,

01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:23.000
and the reason why I bring this up and everyone's like, Oh,

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.480
financial business, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:30.600
When you're looking at your retailers and also a mark of where trends are going

01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:34.920
in the distribution of gaming related

01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:39.680
services to have kind of like a mainstay of this falling

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:43.000
behind now to either like the department ish stores, you know,

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:47.000
like a target or a Walmart or a regular department store.

01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:50.880
And then we also have a little bit more of a rise of the independent boutique.

01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:53.440
Have you noticed that a little bit? Yeah,

01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:57.440
that's where your used market is going to,

01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:00.520
or those independent boutiques. And then, you know,

01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:03.160
cause we have like the game trader here is like supposed to be doing like

01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:05.520
pretty, pretty damn good. And you know,

01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:09.600
although we did lose our dimples because dimples are the place to really get

01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:13.640
games. Right. Didn't the family kind of decide to stop though? Yeah, I guess.

01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:16.200
Part of it was, it's not just them wanting to stop.

01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:19.280
I think the business side of it was great. Did you hear about Percos by the way?

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:23.080
Are they closing too? Oh no, Perry Perry's. Perry's is doing, but it's,

01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:26.160
but it looks like they're going to reopen under new management. Oh, that's cool.

01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:28.840
And I've never got to go there. But anyway, back to, you know,

01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:32.880
I almost made the joke. Well, is it not the original Perry's anymore?

01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:35.520
It would be not the original Perry's,

01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:39.440
but if it keeps the name and runs everything the same and maybe,

01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:44.240
anyway, so back to GameStop, um, they, um,

01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:49.160
actually like even had a couple of, uh, investor, uh,

01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:54.200
activists were trying to get GameStop to buy back off,

01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:58.400
uh, their stock so that at least the investors would make back a little bit of

01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:02.880
money on, you know, what they've spent on it. But yeah, they're,

01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:06.720
they're not looking to do very good. And the investors are basically saying,

01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:10.320
yeah, GameStop isn't going to be able to buy its way out. It's gonna,

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:13.680
it's just gonna probably crash and burn.

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:15.600
The next year is going to be the deciding factor.

01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:21.040
So right now GameStop stock as of today, so today's what, the 15th?

01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:24.640
Yeah. Um, is $5 and 45 cents.

01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:29.400
To do a little bit of a, of a comparison, um,

01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:33.200
Funko is at $15.15.

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:38.440
Sony's at $67.57. Disney is at $146.38 per share.

01:13:39.360 --> 01:13:43.200
Microsoft's at $154.53 per share. So I'm just saying,

01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:44.680
but those aren't retail businesses either.

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:49.720
No, but I'm saying to give it a view versus successful companies and then about

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.200
where the scale is.

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:54.520
GameStop is really heading to,

01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:57.480
like I think when JC Penney closed out of business,

01:13:57.480 --> 01:13:59.680
their stock was going for like a dollar or something.

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:02.600
Yeah. So not all JC Penney's are closed either.

01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:04.360
They did some type of turnaround with them.

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:06.200
Well, and did you hear Toys R Us is coming back?

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:10.440
Yeah. The retail thing is so fascinating to me because, you know,

01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:12.840
they say the Amazon's killing all of these businesses,

01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:14.640
which I understand is the whole like, you know,

01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:18.040
the convenience or whatever of having these delivered to your door and going

01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:21.560
online and not having to worry about pressures, salespeople and all that stuff,

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:24.720
you know. But then what's interesting is that where does Amazon go next?

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:27.480
Now they're opening retail stores like, you know, right?

01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:30.440
Like their big grocery thing where you just,

01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:33.720
you just take it like you stole it off the shelf, right?

01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:35.480
There's like no checkers or anything, right?

01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:37.600
So it's like Amazon's pushing into the retail space.

01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:41.600
And I've heard things about Amazon building bookstores. Isn't that ironic?

01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:42.600
So it's just,

01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:47.280
it's interesting how that stuff is kind of like circling around and back another

01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:51.160
company actually that, no, nevermind. That's, that's old stock report.

01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:55.280
I was just going to double check like where some of the retailers are right now

01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:59.320
as far as their prices. Um, but, uh, like

01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:03.920
I, I don't know, maybe this is a, uh, okay.

01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:06.280
Boomer type of thing, even though I'm gen X,

01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:10.800
but like I don't like to buy clothes online. I mean, if it's, if it's like,

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:12.960
like this hoodie, I bought this hoodie online,

01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:16.840
but that's because where am I going to find a fucking Atari hoodie with the wood

01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:19.640
paneling in this? I'm not going to find that in a retail store. Right.

01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:22.760
So like narrow things that I can really only find online, I'll do.

01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:25.120
But like if I'm going to buy just like jeans and stuff,

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:26.680
I want to kind of like try them on and stuff.

01:15:26.680 --> 01:15:29.400
Like you can't really do that online cause everything's different sizing with

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:32.360
the brands. Right. So I don't know. I'm just very like, I,

01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:35.600
I hope closed stores don't all go away cause I like to be able to walk into a

01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:37.520
store and try things on, you know?

01:15:38.120 --> 01:15:43.120
So I did just a quick relaunch to double check some of these best buy. Okay.

01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:47.320
Best buy stock right now is 84 roughly $84. Um,

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:50.760
just in some of these other ones, I mean like,

01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:56.240
there are some out here that are like 41 cents.

01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:01.800
I don't know how they're getting around that way, but like just some of the,

01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:05.640
the electronics, you know, manufacturers right now there you've got,

01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:10.880
I would probably say like a good average is going to be between like I'd say

01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:14.960
eight and 20 although yeah, the best, the biggest one on here is best buy,

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:17.720
which they got over a big slump. Right. Well, you know,

01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:20.800
and they say target is still doing very well in the face of all this stuff.

01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:23.800
The target is thriving even though it looked like they were in trouble for a

01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:24.200
little bit,

01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:27.560
but they're really doing very well because I guess they've embraced a lot of the

01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:30.560
whole, like, you know, bring it to your car if you order it online or whatever.

01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:34.480
I target is always like that place where it's like, uh,

01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:36.000
we just need this one small thing,

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.440
but let's go to target and buy a bunch of shit we don't need.

01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:42.480
Like that it fulfills that even target now sell shirts. Yeah.

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:47.280
Say that like I came into target for one thing and left with everything or

01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:50.560
something like this shirt. Yeah, exactly. Uh, let's see.

01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:52.680
There was a comment in chat I wanted to read here, um,

01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:55.000
especially cause I don't recognize the name. I like to hear from new people too.

01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:56.640
Uh, here it is. Uh, Phoenix,

01:16:56.680 --> 01:17:01.120
77 26 and chat says there are still lots of Indies though and talking about the

01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:04.520
stores and in some sense that might be good for them though. I would not,

01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:08.440
I would not like to see a whole lot of people lose their jobs. That's true.

01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:10.400
As much as we might sit here and say, you know,

01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:14.920
GameStop sucks and all this stuff. Uh, it's still a lot of people, any,

01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:18.920
any bad decision that GameStop has made was not made by the hardworking people

01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:21.200
making way too little money, uh,

01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:24.560
working at the different mall stores and things of that nature. Um, you know,

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:25.080
it's, it's,

01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:27.880
it's executives in a boardroom somewhere that make all the bonehead decisions,

01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:31.120
but who's going to suffer, you know, if GameStop goes under,

01:17:31.120 --> 01:17:33.840
it'll be all those people on the front line. So, you know,

01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:39.240
you hope that something will come in to take the place of GameStop if they do go

01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:41.920
under. So that way people have a place to work, right?

01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:46.720
Well, and actually I made a friend at a GameStop. Um,

01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:50.240
if Maddie's listening, hi Maddie, if not, you're probably working. Um,

01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:54.880
but at any rate, um, it, when I was in there,

01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:55.800
it was pretty dead.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.800
I do notice the attitude of a lot of games. Cause you know,

01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:03.080
we've all been into the GameStop when we've had that employee that's like the

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:06.600
drunk with power type that like tries to gatekeep everything. Right.

01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:09.400
And it's like, how annoying is that? Right. But like,

01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:13.880
I feel like I don't see those like somehow one thing GameStop's done right is

01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:15.960
they've really weeded a lot of those people out. Cause yeah,

01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:18.120
I would say anytime I have set foot in a game,

01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:20.640
cause Alan still likes to be all like, let's go look at what's on sale.

01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:21.560
Let's go look at the used games.

01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:23.520
So I'll get dragged into a GameStop once in a while.

01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:25.840
And I got to say most of the people that are working there these days,

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:27.040
pretty cool people.

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:30.960
Like I don't get a lot of that attitude that I used to get maybe five years ago,

01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:32.520
once in a while. And it wasn't from every,

01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:36.080
it would just be that one that you'd remember where you're like, ugh, you know,

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:37.160
so.

01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:38.000
Well,

01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:42.200
I have the notice and they've really kind of relaxed a lot of their,

01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:45.200
their like policy for their employees. Have you noticed?

01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:47.040
Like,

01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:50.040
Oh yeah, they don't have to upsell you everything that they used to do.

01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:51.240
Yeah, I think.

01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:54.800
Well, I think when you're hurting the way they are,

01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:56.600
it doesn't make sense to do something like that.

01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:58.000
Cause it's just driving people away.

01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:00.120
So I think they realize that that would,

01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:02.160
that type of thing when it's like,

01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:05.720
if you go into the store and then you get essentially harassed about,

01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:07.840
did you preorder this? Did you put $5 on this?

01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:10.000
Do you want the warranty package? You want all this?

01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:13.280
That's what was driving people to go to Amazon in the first place.

01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:15.880
Because on Amazon it was click done. I got it.

01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:17.520
And I wasn't harassed about anything else.

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:20.080
And I think retailers finally wised up to that,

01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:22.880
that that's why they were losing a lot of business to Amazon was that,

01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:24.720
that pressure that people didn't want to deal with.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.960
Yeah. So anyway, all right. A little bit of a tangent, but a good one.

01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:32.360
Let's continue on and talk about not so great business decisions.

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:33.560
Loki.

01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:38.040
Yes. This is not surprising coming from Activision,

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:43.040
but unfortunately it is something that we're finding to be the case nowadays.

01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:46.520
So Activision with Call of Duty,

01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:51.200
one of the things that players especially that are really into Call of Duty

01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:53.920
and kind of take it more seriously is their kill death ratio.

01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:55.920
And they want to know how well they're doing.

01:19:56.280 --> 01:20:01.280
So previously I think what they had done is actually showed that in the,

01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:03.320
the final score screen,

01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:06.080
they kind of showed everybody's kill death ratio on there.

01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:12.160
But apparently they said that that led to harassing or harassment from other

01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:15.800
players if you didn't do so well. So you would think, okay,

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:17.680
the simple thing to do would then be,

01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:21.280
let's just not let everybody see that kill death ratio.

01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:24.720
How about only you get to see that kill death ratio? Well,

01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:28.080
what ended up actually happening is they just took it out altogether.

01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:33.840
But if you're interested to actually find out what your kill death ratio is on

01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:39.440
the fly, you can pay for the $20 Mother Russia bundle,

01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:44.680
which includes 10 pieces of cosmetics and also includes this time to die watch

01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:48.240
that shows your kills and deaths.

01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:54.920
So you have to pay $20 to bring back a feature that was taken out of the game by

01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:56.400
Activision.

01:20:56.680 --> 01:21:01.200
Or you could get a notepad and make notes yourself on, Oh, I killed that many.

01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:04.720
I killed that guy. I killed that. And then I got killed. So you could take notes.

01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:11.480
It is silly. No, it's really silly. Uh, so you know what you have to do, right?

01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:15.600
You have to not buy it because voting with your wallet is the most important

01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:17.320
thing. If you think this is stupid, then don't buy it.

01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:18.800
But if you think this is really stupid,

01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:21.120
don't buy the game that it's featured in because it is,

01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:22.520
it is a little bit ridiculous. Like,

01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:26.120
especially if the stat was there and then they removed it, you know,

01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:29.280
only to put it back in some type of cosmetic that does seem really silly.

01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:30.840
It, it is. And it's,

01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:34.920
it's something that's like kind of integral to the game,

01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:37.440
especially if you're playing, like you're trying to, you know,

01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:40.560
take it a little bit seriously and be more competitive with it.

01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:44.560
But the fact that they take it out because they want to make the game more

01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:47.800
approachable for other players, which is stupid, just don't make it public.

01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:50.240
Then you know that like, that's what you need to do.

01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:52.760
But instead you just wanted to sell you.

01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:56.320
You probably plan to do this where you sell it back because well,

01:21:56.440 --> 01:22:00.960
it's coming out like two months after the game has been out. I mean,

01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:05.160
come on. It was intentional. They planned on doing this. It's stupid.

01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:06.200
It was a little silly,

01:22:06.600 --> 01:22:10.200
but this isn't a series that I've super gotten into anyway.

01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:13.520
And this doesn't exactly encourage me to start. Um,

01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:16.480
a series I would have gotten into had it been released would have been, uh,

01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:19.360
Hideo Kojima's take on silent Hills, which of course,

01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:22.000
as we know now was all, uh, unveiled, uh, and,

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:26.560
and started with a demo called PT. Uh, and, uh, years later,

01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:30.920
years later, people still obsessing about PT and with good reason,

01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:34.720
it was great and finding new things about it. Um, and dark soccer,

01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:37.520
this is the type of thing that is up your alley, actually this sort of hat.

01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:40.480
Cause you've kind of done these things, uh, with mass effect and some other

01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:41.000
games,

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:45.240
but basically what happened is that there was a camera mod that somebody was

01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:48.200
able to install into PT price. Hasn't happened earlier. Yeah.

01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:50.280
That was kind of the surprise for me too, is that, wow,

01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:53.120
they just now got the camera mod in, but it might also be the fact, you know,

01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:56.160
it's not PC it's console. So it takes a little longer. Uh,

01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:59.520
it wasn't actually retail game either, but anyway, however they did it,

01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:01.360
the camera modding trick finally happened.

01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:05.200
And what they were able to do with it is that to actually see by having like the

01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:08.760
character in a mirror and using the camera mod, long story short,

01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:13.200
PT takes place from the first person perspective and you are actually playing as

01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:17.600
Norman Reedus in that game. So when they use the camera trick, they found, Oh,

01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:22.240
the, the player character is Norman Reedus completely clean up that mirror. Yeah.

01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:24.880
In order to be able to do that. But that is it. Uh,

01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:27.480
that came from a tweet from man fight dragon,

01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:31.080
who I think was one of the moderate folks behind this saying just to put any

01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:33.320
uncertainty finally to rest after all this time. Yes.

01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:37.360
The guy you play as in PT is the same guy you see in the ending cinematic.

01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:41.320
Not that there was any real doubt, but yeah, it's Norman Reedus the whole time.

01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:45.600
So there you go. Um, some other things that have come out about PT recently, uh,

01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:50.120
the ghost woman, Lisa, always behind you. Yeah. In the game.

01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:53.640
That's something else that, uh, with the little camera trick found out, uh,

01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:56.360
some cut content from the demo in the bathtub.

01:23:56.560 --> 01:24:00.240
Apparently the tub has water in it at one point, but in another point it's empty.

01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:02.880
But there was another scenario where the tub is full,

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:07.640
but there's a decapitated body in it. Great. Lovely. Merry Christmas.

01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:12.080
That's my favorite. That's where I put my decapitated body.

01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:16.560
It was in the tub. I filled with water and that head somewhere singing.

01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:19.280
I ain't got nobody. All right. Anyway,

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:24.920
I just love that years later we're still upset and Kojima finally started and

01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:26.160
released a new game.

01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:31.120
Also starring Norman Reedus and we're still obsessed with PT,

01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:34.480
but I understand. I totally get it. All right. Stupid.

01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:38.160
Right behind you. I, I, I want,

01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:42.720
I've never wanted a stupid rumor to be truer in my whole life than the one

01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:43.720
where, uh,

01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:47.760
Konami and Kojima have sat down and worked out Kojima productions taking Silent

01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:51.320
Hill because I talked about this. Did that come up on the show? I don't know.

01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:53.840
I remember saying, that's what Konami should do.

01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:57.040
If Konami wanted to really win favor back, they're not doing anything with it.

01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:58.760
Fucking get a cut,

01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:02.440
give it to somebody who's going to do good with it and get a fucking cut of it

01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:03.720
because it's your IP.

01:25:03.880 --> 01:25:07.760
And so if that's true that they really did sit down with Kojima and hash out

01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:10.800
their beef. And that's why they say, that's why, um,

01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:15.680
that guy left because apparently he was pissed that Kojima was even talking to

01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:17.520
Konami again. And so he left again.

01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:21.680
This is all rumors and drama and probably made up because look where the rumors

01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:25.760
and the game awards got us. But God damn, if it isn't fun to fantasize about that,

01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:27.880
I mean, what's the, what's the best we got at Konami,

01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:32.120
a new contour game that sucks ass. So a new metal gear game that sucks ass.

01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:36.600
Kojima has been talking about doing a horror game.

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.560
So I don't know. I, we,

01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:43.360
just because we want it to be true doesn't mean it is, but man,

01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:46.480
it would be a holiday miracle if that ended up happening.

01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:50.640
I would love that so much. So anyhow, moving on.

01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:54.360
I was watching the video. All right. So well,

01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:59.200
we're going to travel back to a simpler time before there were camera hacks and

01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:02.400
things like this because everything was, there was a, yeah, cameras,

01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:03.880
everything was a fricking Sprite.

01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:05.640
It's the classic game of the week.

01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:06.960
And every week you're on the program,

01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:10.400
dark soccer steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks, Hey,

01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:13.160
you should be checking this game out. You little brat.

01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:18.920
I went back 30 years. Sometimes, sometimes it's a, it's a good game.

01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:22.000
Sometimes it's a not so good game. I'm not sure. Good game.

01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:26.520
I think this was a good game as well. It had a sequel. It was, it is. I,

01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:28.960
and I remember playing this game, which is interesting because I didn't have this

01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:29.600
system,

01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:34.600
but I think this is also a game that got accused a lot of copying somebody

01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:39.080
else's. Oh yeah, it's totally a clone, but it, it did very well for itself.

01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:41.680
But anyway, with that dark soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:43.080
I picked new Topia.

01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:46.160
New Topia came out, um,

01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:49.680
on November 17th, 1989 in Japan.

01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:54.920
And, uh, it had a us releases that came out in 1990.

01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:57.600
And so basically the game,

01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:02.240
it really plays a lot like the first legend of Zelda.

01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:07.720
Graphically a bit better. Um, but it came out for the PC engine,

01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:09.600
also known as the turbo graphics 16.

01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:15.080
It did get a release for virtual console for Wii in 2007 and in Japan for Wii U

01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:17.760
on April 16th, 2014.

01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:22.560
And we released some PlayStation network in Japan in 2010 and North America,

01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:23.400
2011.

01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:28.480
So basically you're in a land called new Topia and this demon called dearth

01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:33.280
captured princess Aurora and stolen eight ancient medallions.

01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:37.280
They contain the wisdom to seal away the demon.

01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:40.040
Sound familiar? Um,

01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:45.160
so you have to play as a protagonist named Josetta to retrieve the medallions,

01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:49.200
defeat the demon and rescue the princess and save the land.

01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:54.680
It is basically a legend of Zelda clone in almost every possible way.

01:27:56.200 --> 01:27:58.880
It did of course make some improvements, but of course, you know,

01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:01.920
graphically it's a little bit better, you know, better.

01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:06.160
I would say while the tunes in Zelda are better than musical quality is a little

01:28:06.160 --> 01:28:10.320
bit better. It, um, did overcome overcome some of the shortcomings.

01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:15.320
It has long passwords unless you use the add on battery pack.

01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:21.080
Um, it does have some repetitive gameplay, some poor collision detection. Um,

01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:26.320
but overall it's considered to be one of the better games of its type and it was

01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:33.320
good enough to get a sequel where just that a son take takes over for him.

01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:38.320
Um, so basically, um,

01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:43.320
it is an over kind of the semi overhead action shooter. Like, you know,

01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:48.160
as you can probably see from whoever's watching the video right now. Um,

01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:53.200
so you have to go into these crypts to find the medallions and defeat each boss

01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:58.080
to get the medallion. And then, um, you know,

01:28:58.080 --> 01:29:02.680
you also have a life meter, um, your gold,

01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:07.240
everything is just on screen status. I mean it is really, really very,

01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:09.520
very Zelda. Um,

01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:11.880
you have a lot of enemies that are even very similar,

01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:16.880
like rocks and ghosts and nights that charge you and spear throwing goblins.

01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:24.360
Um, now a couple of other things too, um, is that, uh,

01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:24.880
you know,

01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:28.160
your life meter is going to increase when you get a medallion kind of like using

01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:31.840
the hearts. Um, you also can get an option,

01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:35.680
an item called the book of revival that lets you continue and restart from where

01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:39.400
you last got a password, even after the console has been shut off.

01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:42.120
But your password will also let you resume your game.

01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:46.840
And if you have the turbo graphic CD or turbo booster plus,

01:29:47.240 --> 01:29:51.600
you can save your progress in the system ram via a quote file cabinet feature.

01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:55.080
Um, kind of like the passwords, but you know,

01:29:55.320 --> 01:29:59.800
it's on system memory and not something cause I mean it was a hue card. Um,

01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:04.360
you know, the hue cards being also wasn't as the turbo chip. Yeah. Um,

01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:10.160
and uh, of course this game was also published by Hudson soft. Um,

01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:13.480
it was considered, like I said, again,

01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:17.960
the Zelda of the PC engine era. But, um,

01:30:18.680 --> 01:30:23.240
it was again, pretty well loved and that wasn't a terrible game.

01:30:23.800 --> 01:30:25.760
But also though, um,

01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:30.360
I did point out that new Tobia came out two years before legend of Zelda linked

01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:32.360
to the past. Um,

01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:36.800
and that it was trying to basically stay with the Nintendo curve.

01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:41.280
A couple of other things though about this one is that people felt that the boss

01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:44.800
battles were boring and long. Passwords are also boring and long.

01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:49.720
And it had a references to Judaism,

01:30:49.920 --> 01:30:54.720
Islam and quotes from star Wars that kind of made people go, what?

01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:59.160
Um, so at any rate, you know,

01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:01.800
it's a pretty simple game.

01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:06.440
It's fun to play through and it doesn't suck completely. It's just,

01:31:06.560 --> 01:31:07.920
it's not as old, it's not Zelda,

01:31:07.960 --> 01:31:12.240
but it's worth mentioning because there was a bit of a stink over this game when

01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:14.200
it came out. So there you go.

01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:21.120
The game is new Topia. It looks very much like Zelda. Have you ever played it?

01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:26.160
Nope. Well, it looks just like Zelda. It really does. I mean,

01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:31.120
like even like the way that stairs appear and the little sword sticking out,

01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:35.960
it was enemies go out and in and out of the ground. It really is a clone.

01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:39.080
I swear I played this game once. Um,

01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:42.840
but I don't know how because I never owned a turbo graphics 16 so maybe a

01:31:42.840 --> 01:31:45.640
friend. Yeah, I must've been a friend that I demo. Well, I mean,

01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:47.320
I knew it was on, we were in that stuff too,

01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:50.080
but I'm pretty sure I didn't buy it on those. So I don't know.

01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:53.840
I also feel like maybe I played a very similar type of game. Like,

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:57.400
like a lagoon on the super Nintendo had a lot of kind of like common stuff,

01:31:57.400 --> 01:32:01.160
I think. So I don't know. Maybe I'm just confusing it with other stuff,

01:32:01.160 --> 01:32:04.520
which is very possible. So, uh, Dr. C and chat says, you know,

01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:06.960
I don't think Rob mentioned crystalis in his gaming week.

01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:09.480
Speaking of Zelda clones. Yeah, he's right.

01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:11.080
I did leave that out my gaming week on accident.

01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:14.720
I did a hour stream yesterday or the day before where I was playing crystalis,

01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:18.120
which is another kind of Zelda E type clone because they just put that out on

01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:21.520
the super, or excuse me, the NES switch online library.

01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:25.000
So it was fun to go visit that. So, but anyway, there it is,

01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:28.600
your classic game of the week, utopia. So what made you think of that?

01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:30.640
What made you pick that one this week?

01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:33.440
Because I found my copy of utopia. Oh, there you go.

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:39.480
You should, I wish you streamed more of these classic games yourself.

01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:40.840
It'd be fun to watch. Well,

01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:44.040
as soon as they can get his computer that's not going to shut down every time

01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:48.000
I'm trying to do something with it. Yeah. Uh, Bobby black Wolf and chat says,

01:32:48.020 --> 01:32:51.040
what did you learn about safe States this week? Rob? Yeah. Save now,

01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:54.840
save often, but also make sure you're actually saving and not loading.

01:32:54.920 --> 01:32:59.360
That was the other thing I learned this week. Oops. All right.

01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:03.480
Anyhow, let's move on. We got plenty more show to go. Uh, pretty soon though,

01:33:03.480 --> 01:33:07.640
probably in the next 30 minutes or so, we will get to, uh, the discord, uh,

01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:11.840
calls if you want to call in tonight over at vog network.com slash discord.

01:33:12.200 --> 01:33:13.160
But in the meantime,

01:33:13.160 --> 01:33:16.360
we're going to get to some rapid fire news and talk about a couple other

01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:20.000
headlines pretty quickly here. So, uh, Loki, why don't you start us off?

01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:25.080
So moral combat is going to be more kind of 11 is going to be getting cross

01:33:25.080 --> 01:33:27.920
play with K because it's more combat and everything.

01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:30.640
They have to begin with the K, um,

01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:34.520
between places where an X-Box one is part of their upcoming patch.

01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:38.680
And, um, that's pretty awesome. They'll have that available.

01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:42.800
I don't care about them anymore. Okay.

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:44.240
You don't care about cross play or mortal combat,

01:33:44.280 --> 01:33:48.520
about mortal combat because of Rhonda Rousey being anti-trans. Oh, I, that was,

01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:52.880
that's old, but she still is. Yeah. And, um, how they ruined Sindel.

01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:57.080
Oh yeah. I didn't, I don't care for what they did to Sindel, but, um, yeah,

01:33:57.920 --> 01:34:00.640
but, uh, cross play is a good thing. At least I forgot to mention,

01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:03.960
I may have played Minecraft on PS4 this week. That's kind of, kind of relevant,

01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:06.400
but anyway, moving on. Yeah. Uh,

01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:11.440
Tetris 99's dropped a new update that allows team battle mode along with the,

01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:18.480
um, was it the 10th Maximus cup that's going to be coming soon.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:20.720
So, um,

01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:23.600
that's pretty cool that you can now battle with up to,

01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:27.680
it looks like it's teams of 10 maybe or no,

01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:32.120
probably like 12. I know the one screenshot I'm looking at, it's like, um,

01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:36.640
well 99, I guess it seems like there's a whole lot less than 99 players on there

01:34:36.660 --> 01:34:39.960
though. So maybe 25. Um,

01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:44.440
and then let's see what else. So that'll be coming,

01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:47.680
or that's already come out in the 10th, uh,

01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:52.240
Maximus cup is actually starting tomorrow. All right. Busy, busy.

01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:55.280
All right. Um, moving on to, uh,

01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:59.240
some kind of big news in the Bioshock universe is that a new Bioshock title was

01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:02.520
confirmed, but that's it. Just that we know a new Bioshock is in development,

01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:04.760
but of course a new Bioshock's in development.

01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:07.600
That franchise is pretty legendary. Well, they did tease that. Yeah,

01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:09.200
there's a new one coming. Yeah, but we don't,

01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:10.560
we literally know nothing about it,

01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:15.080
but here's what we do know is that 2k games founded a new studio called cloud

01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:19.920
chamber. It's two teams in San Francisco and Montreal as well. Uh,

01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:24.020
and they are working on the new Bioshock game, whatever that is.

01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:26.520
They're saying it will be in development for the next several years.

01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:31.560
So this also means likely it's a PlayStation five new Xbox type of game.

01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:34.600
I'm down. All of the Bioshock games have been amazing.

01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:37.760
Bioshock is a really great series. Although I never did finish two.

01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:39.680
That's the only one that I did not finish.

01:35:39.720 --> 01:35:44.160
But two was kind of the one that wasn't really by like, it was like, it wasn't,

01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:46.760
it was just kind of like a cash follow up to the first one.

01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:49.760
Did you ever play infinite? I did play it not from start to finish,

01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:51.600
but I did play it. It is a great,

01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:54.920
like you got to play it all the way to the end cause it's, it's such a good game.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:58.640
I need to go back, especially now that I think then they do remasters for all

01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:01.840
those. So I need to go back and play that cause I'm pretty sure,

01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:03.440
I know I have one and two, uh,

01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:07.560
questmaster says Ken Levine is not involved with the new game though. Um,

01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:08.320
and, uh,

01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:11.560
that could be maybe a red flag when you consider he wasn't involved with the

01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:15.720
actual Bioshock two either. Um, you know, let's give it a chance.

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:19.400
It might end up being really good, so we'll see. Uh,

01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:21.360
it's still very early on. Hopefully, uh,

01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:23.760
it'll be a really great looking game too. Uh,

01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:26.680
this one goes out to dark Tetsuya cause I know it's one of his faves,

01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:30.720
but it's definitely worth saying that La Mulana one and two remasters are

01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:33.120
confirmed for a Nintendo switch in March.

01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:36.920
There's a whole fricking like combo pack collectors edition,

01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:38.280
like with a fricking puzzle,

01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:41.520
like an actual puzzle that you could put together, which is pretty cool. Uh,

01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:44.840
the remastered bundle on the 17th of March in North America,

01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:47.000
which does St. Patrick's day, how convenient, uh,

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:50.960
20th of March in Europe and, uh, in other regions like Oceania, uh,

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.840
27th of March. So March, March,

01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:56.640
2020 continues to be a huge week in games.

01:36:56.840 --> 01:37:00.760
I worry this one's going to get lost in scary, sorry. Yes. A large month in games.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Uh, I worry this one's going to get lost in the shuffle unless you're dark

01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:08.600
Tetsuya, who I'm sure already has this on pre-order. Uh, but no,

01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:11.560
very cool. And, uh, yeah, I know these games are like crazy hard.

01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:13.560
I have played a little bit of the first one and it's a,

01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:16.840
it's a difficult game, but they're fun. So, all right,

01:37:16.840 --> 01:37:19.400
moving on to a dark Sakura in your news.

01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:25.000
Well, what would be nice is if it wouldn't, uh, give me like a, uh,

01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:28.920
little pop up whenever I'm trying to read something. So, um,

01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:33.760
one of the actresses that I actually have still been following for a little

01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:38.760
while is a Kuriyama Chiaki who was in battle royale and in, uh,

01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:42.280
Kill Bill. She was Gogo Yubari, right? Yep.

01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:47.600
But I still knew her first in battle royale. Well, here at OLR,

01:37:47.620 --> 01:37:50.280
we were all watching that battle royale years ago. Yeah.

01:37:50.280 --> 01:37:52.960
But certainly I think most people saw her in Kill Bill for sure. Yeah.

01:37:53.680 --> 01:37:54.480
At any rate,

01:37:54.480 --> 01:37:59.040
she is going to be playing a police officer named, uh,

01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:04.000
Satchimura Akane in, um, the game, uh,

01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:09.720
Death Comes True, which I'm excited about because it's by, uh,

01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:15.600
um, the Danganronpa dude, uh, uh, Kuraka Kazutaka.

01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:20.280
And she's going to be, uh, basically the same,

01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:25.000
this woman in the same hotel room that the main character woke up in shows up

01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:29.280
unconscious and tied up. And she's a private police investigator.

01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:32.920
So I am looking forward to, uh,

01:38:33.920 --> 01:38:38.400
to seeing her, uh, in that game. And it's, it's a full motion video game,

01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:43.080
by the way. So that'll be interesting. And then, um, also, uh,

01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:45.280
uh,

01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:50.280
there is going to be a pre-order for limited physical edition print of Watam for

01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:54.120
PS4 and a vinyl soundtrack. Um,

01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:58.720
it looks like we've already missed it. It was going live on December 12th,

01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:04.240
but it's got cute covers with apples and sushi and eggs and things on it.

01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:07.400
It's so cute. I figured this also served as a good reminder.

01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:10.640
The game is coming very soon. Yeah. I'm looking forward to it.

01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:15.800
Don't spoil my gaming week or release announcements.

01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:18.320
Oh, my bad. Sorry. Yeah.

01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:22.440
All the album artwork is actually done by Takahashi. So that's pretty cool.

01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:26.040
Yay. All right. Well, with that,

01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:28.800
let's travel around the world and check out some release dates. Loki,

01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:32.000
whatever could be coming out in the U S this week. She's I don't know. Rob,

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:36.320
what could be coming out this week? Only want them. It's on a game.

01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:39.400
I really want, um, it's on PC and PlayStation four,

01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:42.960
but you already know that cause he spoiled it for you already. Yeah.

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.680
Deal with it. That's it. That's all we have. That's it.

01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:48.960
That's the only release this week. Yes. Okay. Wow. I mean,

01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:51.800
unless you count a title goose game, which is coming out digitally.

01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:55.000
I didn't know I was like literally ruining the whole segment. My bad. No, no,

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:58.480
no. In fact, actually, um,

01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:00.720
I thought I had a list of, um,

01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:04.360
the digital games that are coming out this week as well. Yes. So here,

01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:07.760
let me read over some of the digital games that normally I would skip over

01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:11.000
because they're not on my list. Um, so as I mentioned,

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:14.480
entitled goose games coming out in PlayStation four and Xbox one,

01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:19.560
we have a Zeno Raptor on PlayStation four Tamashi on

01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:20.680
PlayStation four.

01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:26.160
I don't know a lot of these games sin chess on PC.

01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:31.120
I'm just going to read all the good ones. All the fun named ones sweater. Okay.

01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:36.480
The dialogy on PC. Uh, we have gun volt Chronicles,

01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:38.640
luminous adventure. Um,

01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:43.040
I X on Xbox one mirror. Huh?

01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:47.560
Did you say I X or nine? I X. That's not nine. Nothing.

01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:48.960
Okay.

01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:52.360
It's it's a lurk isn't, they're not trying to be, um,

01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:56.120
doing Roman numerals there. It's lowercase I X.

01:40:57.160 --> 01:41:01.680
So I'm assuming that as I X it X what it X it is.

01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:06.520
Oh geez. Oh no. My rabbits are gone on PC.

01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:11.000
Uh, one idly and the dinner party on PC.

01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:16.280
I kind of play some of these games and last but not least a game that I think

01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:19.920
Jamie would like soccer pinball and PlayStation four. Oh cool.

01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:22.040
But it's not world cup soccer, but it's still soccer.

01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:28.520
All right, well let's travel over. Wait, wait, wait. And last but not least on PC.

01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:33.560
I kid you not. This is an actual title is coming on PC this week. Okay.

01:41:33.560 --> 01:41:34.400
Boomer.

01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:40.080
Somebody is cashing in on that fast. I love it.

01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:43.840
All right. All right. Anyway, you need a game called gen X versus the world.

01:41:44.120 --> 01:41:48.040
Now may I get in a car and go to Japan? Go. All right, here we go.

01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:52.800
Drive across the ocean, Rob. I will. Okay. It's a Christmas miracle. Uh,

01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:56.080
moving on to a Japanese release dates. We're going to start with the switch.

01:41:56.080 --> 01:41:57.440
We have a few games coming out,

01:41:57.440 --> 01:42:01.040
including Busta fellows where the S is a dollar sign. Uh,

01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:03.320
you play us like a lawyer, I think. Anyway, uh,

01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:06.720
that is a game that's coming out on the switch as well as a giant five in one

01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:10.760
rock man and rock man X collection. So that is of course, mega man.

01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:12.400
It's both mega man collections,

01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:16.920
both mega man X collections and then rock man 11 like all in one big box set.

01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:20.360
It actually looks pretty sweet. Uh, if I was, you know, in Japan,

01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:21.320
I might want to pick that up,

01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:23.120
but it's going to cost you an arm and a leg to import it.

01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:25.160
So I don't know if you really want to do that. Uh,

01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:27.680
some other games that are coming out on the switch on the 19th, uh,

01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:32.520
we have warriors Orochi for ultimate is coming out as well as DC for

01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:34.280
is out this weekend.

01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:38.920
ESP rod day side in regular and limited edition from M two,

01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:43.240
uh, checking out the PlayStation four this week. Uh, a lot of the same stuff.

01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:45.480
We have that ESP rod day side. Uh,

01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:49.040
DC to Capo is out and the rock man bundle edition is also out.

01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:53.560
That is all again on PlayStation four as well. Uh, and uh,

01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:58.600
the surge two is also out this week in Japan as well as ancestors legacy.

01:42:58.840 --> 01:42:59.080
Uh,

01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:03.280
also if you want to get a nice price reduction on earth defense force five dream

01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:06.160
value set, that is something available to you in Japan this week.

01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:10.040
So there you go. That's Japanese releases a little more exciting over there.

01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:13.760
I also wanted to mention because I did catch this at the very end there, uh,

01:43:13.780 --> 01:43:17.160
that there is a game called slippery sausages coming out in PC and Mac as well.

01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:18.680
Oh,

01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:19.640
oh girl.

01:43:20.720 --> 01:43:23.480
All right. Uh, let's move on. Dark Sakura. How about the UK?

01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:27.640
So, um, not really much on the list. These are all on the 16th.

01:43:27.960 --> 01:43:32.040
We have a never winter nights enhanced edition collectors pack and we also have

01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:37.320
planescape torment ice wind Dale, uh, enhanced edition collectors pack.

01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:41.520
Um, both of those are for the big three. Um,

01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:44.840
we also have a Baldur's gate enhanced edition collectors patch also for the big

01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:48.840
three, uh, pack. Sorry. And then Avicii, uh,

01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:54.240
in vector again for, uh, looks like PC and Xbox.

01:43:54.240 --> 01:43:55.080
Okay.

01:43:56.480 --> 01:43:59.240
Sorry. I have an autoplay. You think your popups are bad.

01:43:59.240 --> 01:44:00.800
I got autoplay and commercials over here.

01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:03.480
That sounds like garbage video autoplay video is garbage.

01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:06.720
If your website has it, you're garbage and you should be ashamed of yourself.

01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:10.200
All right, well my next story is from CBS sports so that we should also be

01:44:10.200 --> 01:44:12.900
ashamed of yourself. All right, well it's, it's relevant.

01:44:12.900 --> 01:44:16.920
You can see on the sidebar what it is, but anyway, but that's it. All right.

01:44:16.920 --> 01:44:19.680
That's it for UK releases. Uh, let's go to the mailbag. Uh,

01:44:19.700 --> 01:44:23.280
you guys can email us participate at orange launch trader.com is the place to

01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:26.560
send us emails and a dark soccer is going to dive into the mailbag head first

01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:29.040
and find some emails to read here on the show for you,

01:44:29.040 --> 01:44:31.320
which I think we have a couple tonight. Yes. Yes. All right.

01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:34.800
So the first one's from Robert M. Uh, just a question for you, for you guys.

01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:38.440
I'm Bobby. I didn't send it to him this time. Just if he is,

01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:42.560
just if he is in Twitch chat, I sometimes he is,

01:44:42.560 --> 01:44:45.000
but sometimes he takes care of other stuff during the show.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:46.040
So we'll see if he pops up.

01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:49.640
I picked up super hot on the switch and appreciate that it has the option for

01:44:49.640 --> 01:44:52.200
motion camera controls. There have been over,

01:44:52.440 --> 01:44:56.480
there have been several other switch titles with origins and virtual reality.

01:44:56.480 --> 01:45:00.480
Yes. Super hot was not originally VR, but that's the more recent version,

01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:02.480
including new super lucky's tale,

01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:05.640
which I'm interested in and Trover saves the universe.

01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:08.880
What are the VR titles in your judgment would be a good fit for Nintendo's

01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:10.640
console? None of them.

01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:15.200
Doesn't run very well on console, but no, um,

01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:16.840
anything that's not VR anymore.

01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:21.800
You mean that would work on the console or like if Nintendo had a VR console,

01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:25.640
like how they did super lucky's tale as a regular platformer instead of

01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:26.480
instructional VR?

01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:34.720
I don't know. Um, a lot of actually the, um,

01:45:35.680 --> 01:45:39.720
they had it with, with the, uh, Labo VR stuff,

01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:43.120
which none of that really has to be played in VR. I mean,

01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:46.520
all that's pretty good for VR. If you want to do that.

01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:49.840
Um, I'm also going to say none of them,

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:51.840
but I think for a different reason, perhaps.

01:45:51.880 --> 01:45:55.880
I just think that if a game was cooked up in VR and VR was what was,

01:45:55.920 --> 01:45:59.240
it was designed for and made for, I think it should stay in VR.

01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:02.280
I think something like beat saber would be terrible if they took, well,

01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:03.440
I don't think it'd be terrible, but it wouldn't,

01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:07.040
it wouldn't be the same certainly if they were to put it in the screen because

01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:12.040
that spatial awareness, uh, and so forth in the VR is a lot of it's part of what

01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:16.040
makes that game, that game. So like, I, I, I understand the question.

01:46:16.040 --> 01:46:18.120
I respect the question, but just respectfully,

01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:22.600
my answer is keep VR games VR. Like, I don't think we should,

01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:25.840
making regular games VR, um,

01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:30.720
depending on what it is because sometimes it works out pretty decently, but like,

01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:34.560
like resident evil seven I think was probably enhanced by VR, but I,

01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:38.160
I could kind of give or take it and no man's sky. I think it was pretty,

01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:40.600
but I don't think it really added anything to game Skyrim.

01:46:40.600 --> 01:46:41.960
It was like one of those pretty,

01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:46.120
but I don't think it added anything to the game. Um, and then, uh, like I,

01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:49.080
I hate it when they do the eight bit games in VR.

01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:51.880
Like I think it's one of the things people do it just because they can,

01:46:52.120 --> 01:46:55.960
but like legend of Zelda in VR. Yuck.

01:46:56.920 --> 01:46:59.440
Like, let's be real. It's not a good thing. And, and yeah,

01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:02.920
the VR labo stuff didn't end up being, it could be good though if they did it.

01:47:02.920 --> 01:47:06.800
Right. Like the legend is all the stuff like VR is good. Yeah.

01:47:07.240 --> 01:47:10.880
So I think it could be fun. Respectfully. My answer is don't,

01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:13.080
if you're gonna make a game for VR, keep in VR.

01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:16.080
If you're gonna make game for a flat screen, keep it in a flat screen. Anyway,

01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:17.000
that's my answer.

01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:21.320
I would say though, it's okay to have franchises across except I really,

01:47:21.320 --> 01:47:23.800
really wish that if we're going to do another half life story,

01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:25.120
it wasn't fucking VR.

01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:28.800
So that the rest of us who want more half life stuff are excluded by this.

01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:31.360
It's highly exclusionary.

01:47:31.360 --> 01:47:35.800
And on top of that could even go into being, um,

01:47:36.520 --> 01:47:37.880
ability insensitive

01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:44.680
for people who have sensory issues or can't wear VR headsets for any reason.

01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:49.080
It actually could be quite, uh, discriminatory.

01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:49.400
Well,

01:47:49.400 --> 01:47:53.880
one could say that video games as a medium are discriminatory towards blind or

01:47:53.880 --> 01:47:56.360
deaf, depending on what the video game is. I mean,

01:47:56.480 --> 01:47:58.600
some out there are working on,

01:47:58.600 --> 01:48:01.360
but doing something that is specifically exclusionary like this,

01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:03.560
then that's like a different story. So I'm just saying.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:05.840
All right, well let's move on.

01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:10.800
Um, so the next email is, uh,

01:48:12.120 --> 01:48:13.160
Frodo Swagons.

01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:16.080
I just wanted to shout out team NRG.

01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:19.280
They finally won the rocket league grand championship.

01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:23.480
The way they won was like a fairytale. E-sports is really growing on me.

01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:27.040
I encourage anyone to go check it out. It's on YouTube and Twitch.

01:48:28.160 --> 01:48:29.000
Okay.

01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:34.080
Yeah. I don't follow a lot of the E-sports stuff, but I think that's, um,

01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:37.040
I think that's neat. And I, you know, I think it'd be one of those things.

01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:41.240
It's like regular sports actually. I don't really follow a lot of basketball.

01:48:41.240 --> 01:48:45.200
I don't follow a lot of baseball, but like when I go to see a basketball game,

01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:49.360
especially like I used to go to WNBA games when they actually had a WNBA team

01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:53.520
here because they were really, they were really reasonably priced.

01:48:53.560 --> 01:48:56.680
That's the reality of it because you know, they weren't the NBA,

01:48:56.680 --> 01:48:59.200
they were the WNBA. They were reasonably priced,

01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:01.680
but the games were a lot of fun to watch live. Um,

01:49:01.680 --> 01:49:03.720
and the crowd really got into it and all that stuff. Ooh.

01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:07.080
And I've had a really good time when I go to hockey games. Uh, my friends,

01:49:07.120 --> 01:49:10.840
obviously I have a lot of friends that like obsess over the sharks, uh,

01:49:10.840 --> 01:49:13.760
in San Jose. And so I've gotten to go to games because of that. Cause like, Oh,

01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:15.560
we have an extra ticket, Rob's in town, let's go.

01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:17.560
And I have a lot of fun when I go, but I can't,

01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:20.240
I don't really follow hockey outside of it.

01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:24.520
So I think that might be like the missing piece in E-sports for me. And like, I,

01:49:24.520 --> 01:49:27.160
I think I don't want to speak for Bobby, but, um,

01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:31.920
I feel like when he went to DreamHack, was that what it was in Atlanta?

01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:34.960
It was like really neat cause he was there and in the midst of those types of

01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:38.240
things, I feel like if I'm there, like if I go to an Overwatch league thing,

01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:41.800
then I'm going to probably have a really good time. But when I'm not, you know,

01:49:41.800 --> 01:49:45.520
I'm not really following it outside of that. So that's not me hating on it.

01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:46.680
It's just, Oh, I just,

01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:49.320
I haven't really been following it cause I'm not there. So,

01:49:49.480 --> 01:49:50.960
and Bobby Black Wolf does say, yeah,

01:49:50.960 --> 01:49:54.040
I watched a lot of Rocket League at DreamHack Atlanta. It was fun. Okay.

01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:56.160
If you, I wouldn't want to try to speak for you,

01:49:56.160 --> 01:49:59.960
but that was the impression I was getting from your comments on your radio

01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:03.920
program, which airs before us here at VOG Network. Anyway.

01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:06.520
Um, so yeah, cool. I mean,

01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:10.440
it's certainly easy to find esports stuff. It's playing all the time on Twitch.

01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:11.960
Um, so yeah,

01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:16.000
I think maybe you just have to find that game you really like. Like actually,

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:21.360
the one I was watching that I kind of enjoyed was Heroes of the Storm,

01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:25.480
but then that whole thing got a kick in the butt when Blizzard basically kind of

01:50:25.480 --> 01:50:29.080
pulled the Heroes of the Dorm and all that other stuff. And it took a lot,

01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:32.520
I mean, there's still esports matches for Heroes of the Storm going on out there,

01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:34.920
but a lot of the air got let out of the tires. Uh,

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:39.320
and that was unfortunate, I think. So anyway, any other emails or was that it?

01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:42.200
Just the two? Okay. Just those two. Just the two.

01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:44.120
So if you'd like to send an email in a future week,

01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:49.200
participate at orangeloungeradio.com. All right, let's move on.

01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:53.480
We have some more news to get to before we get to Discord stuff. Uh, Loki,

01:50:53.560 --> 01:50:54.400
I think you're up first.

01:50:54.680 --> 01:50:56.080
Yes. So, uh,

01:50:56.080 --> 01:51:01.080
Redbox used to offer games and I say used to because they're going to be

01:51:01.400 --> 01:51:02.400
discontinuing that.

01:51:02.920 --> 01:51:06.240
So apparently they announced that they're no longer going to be renting games,

01:51:06.280 --> 01:51:09.720
which makes sense because I don't think it did very well for them.

01:51:09.760 --> 01:51:11.680
And honestly,

01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:16.440
I think the rental space for video games isn't really something that's too

01:51:16.440 --> 01:51:18.560
widely utilized nowadays anyway,

01:51:18.560 --> 01:51:22.480
especially now with like games pass and some of the PlayStation Now services and

01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:26.600
everything, it's just easier to pay, you know,

01:51:26.600 --> 01:51:30.400
the $10 a month or whatever to actually utilize a service where you have a ton

01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:35.440
of games you can play versus just renting one of the newer titles out of a red

01:51:36.840 --> 01:51:40.360
box for like, I want to say like three or $4 a day,

01:51:40.920 --> 01:51:43.160
which is kind of just like an antiquated thing.

01:51:43.880 --> 01:51:45.880
It's not like the day we have a blockbuster, you know,

01:51:45.880 --> 01:51:48.760
back when it was like a week for five bucks.

01:51:49.200 --> 01:51:49.560
Uh,

01:51:49.560 --> 01:51:53.680
Phoenix 7726 in chat says that means a lot of red boxes will be selling their

01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:54.840
stock and it'll be cheap.

01:51:55.120 --> 01:52:00.120
I got the Kingdom Hearts 1.5 and 2.5 collection for $10 on PlayStation 4.

01:52:00.240 --> 01:52:02.440
So, I mean, I guess if you're looking for some sales,

01:52:02.440 --> 01:52:04.920
now's a great time with the red box, but yeah, it is,

01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:07.600
it is kind of interesting to see that I haven't,

01:52:07.680 --> 01:52:12.000
I've never used a red box machine in my life or anything. Um, but I, I,

01:52:12.120 --> 01:52:15.440
I know people that do use them for games. So it's, it's, you know,

01:52:15.480 --> 01:52:20.480
I would imagine that they probably didn't get a very good discount on the games

01:52:20.760 --> 01:52:24.640
for sale because I know we, the company used to work for,

01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:28.720
we actually sold games to red box, um, to rent.

01:52:28.840 --> 01:52:31.280
So they probably just,

01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:35.680
it's probably hard for them to make up their money on that stuff cause it needs

01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:40.680
to turn so many times and if it's just not happening before maybe the game even

01:52:41.080 --> 01:52:44.440
gets destroyed or damaged or something like that, that it's just not,

01:52:45.480 --> 01:52:49.520
not really valid, you know, viable use of their time. Maybe they,

01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:52.520
they find that, you know, we're making a lot more money on movies.

01:52:52.560 --> 01:52:55.720
It's better than just have a few more slots that we can put some more movies in

01:52:55.720 --> 01:52:57.080
and call it a day.

01:52:57.080 --> 01:53:00.400
I'm curious to see how red box is doing overall cause you know,

01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:04.520
with Netflix and all these other streaming services, it's like, I don't know.

01:53:04.680 --> 01:53:07.640
I think, yeah, that's the reason why I don't really use a lot of red boxes.

01:53:07.640 --> 01:53:10.440
I still feel like there's a ton of things on the streaming services,

01:53:10.440 --> 01:53:13.720
be it Netflix, be it, you know, CBS, whatever it is I have where I'm like,

01:53:13.720 --> 01:53:14.960
I have plenty of stuff I need to watch.

01:53:14.960 --> 01:53:18.560
I don't need to go pay five bucks to get something a little bit newer because

01:53:18.600 --> 01:53:21.520
that stuff will hit the streaming services at some point or I'll just watch it

01:53:21.520 --> 01:53:22.200
on the plane.

01:53:22.200 --> 01:53:25.320
Yeah. And a lot of things like nowadays, especially too,

01:53:25.320 --> 01:53:30.120
like rentals were good because back then it was, you know,

01:53:30.120 --> 01:53:33.600
you had your mag gaming magazines that you could find like a review on a game or

01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:34.080
something like that,

01:53:34.080 --> 01:53:37.760
but rentals were good to like kind of gauge your interests if you're a like a

01:53:37.760 --> 01:53:40.600
game or not, and you can just drop five bucks, play it for a week,

01:53:40.960 --> 01:53:44.480
and you might even finish the game if it's short enough and check it out.

01:53:44.480 --> 01:53:45.840
Whereas nowadays it's like,

01:53:46.320 --> 01:53:49.320
there's so many online resources for reviews on things.

01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:52.960
You can get a really good impression of what a game is going to be like just by

01:53:52.960 --> 01:53:56.400
watching videos of it online or reading reviews online.

01:53:56.800 --> 01:54:00.960
And you can then wait for a sale if it's something that you don't need right

01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:03.400
away that you can just wait for the drop in price.

01:54:03.400 --> 01:54:08.040
So I can see why that maybe rentals aren't necessarily as, you know,

01:54:08.080 --> 01:54:09.440
integral as they used to be.

01:54:10.280 --> 01:54:13.400
I don't want to sound too tinfoil hat ish or get too off topic,

01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:17.280
but doesn't it seem like something's up with the retail industry and when it

01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:20.480
comes to video games, but it doesn't seem like something weird is going on,

01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:22.520
like somehow gaming, you know,

01:54:22.520 --> 01:54:25.640
maybe I don't know if you have any insight from your time working in the,

01:54:25.640 --> 01:54:28.360
you know, kind of the, the middleman type of stuff for distribution,

01:54:28.360 --> 01:54:33.160
but does it seem weird that like within a year we've seen best

01:54:33.160 --> 01:54:36.160
buys incentive program and discount program go away.

01:54:36.480 --> 01:54:40.440
Amazon prime's discount program was pretty much scaled all the way back to

01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:42.720
nothing. You know, I mean, they, they'd still do something,

01:54:42.720 --> 01:54:43.600
but didn't have to do with games.

01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:46.280
We've seen red boxes now getting rid of their games.

01:54:46.520 --> 01:54:50.040
Doesn't this seem weird that this has all happened in the scope of like a year?

01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:52.600
It, no, not necessarily,

01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:55.200
because if they weren't necessarily getting backing,

01:54:55.240 --> 01:54:59.160
cause I'm assuming with a lot of, especially with the discounts off of new games,

01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:02.440
it was probably something that they were doing as a loss on their own.

01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:07.640
And it could even be that the margins on those games aren't at me.

01:55:07.880 --> 01:55:11.200
I don't know what the distribution industry looks like right now.

01:55:11.440 --> 01:55:14.040
It could be that they're raising their prices across the board,

01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:18.120
that the margins on those games are becoming slimmer because the price,

01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:23.520
the wholesale price on those games are much smaller or larger now.

01:55:23.560 --> 01:55:25.280
They don't want to break the $60.

01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:29.680
It's so they, so they may be charging more, you know, for their games, but you know,

01:55:29.680 --> 01:55:33.880
still requiring or not really requiring, but like it could be requiring actually

01:55:33.880 --> 01:55:36.840
if it's, it has to do with MDF, um,

01:55:37.320 --> 01:55:42.320
is that they have to still market that as a $59.99 game.

01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:48.080
Whereas if they're not getting any funding from publishers to

01:55:48.120 --> 01:55:49.680
offer discounts on these games,

01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:52.960
which I'm assuming like a program with Best Buy or even Amazon aren't,

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:54.080
they were doing it as a loss.

01:55:54.560 --> 01:55:57.840
Maybe they're just not getting the drive that they thought they were going to get

01:55:57.840 --> 01:55:58.160
from it.

01:55:58.160 --> 01:56:01.320
So they cut the program because they're not getting enough utilization.

01:56:01.320 --> 01:56:03.360
It's not making them money in the end.

01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:06.720
I don't know if that's necessarily writing on the wall.

01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:10.120
I think it's just, they need to take a different approach with that.

01:56:10.360 --> 01:56:12.640
I could see that. Um, some good comments in chat as well,

01:56:12.640 --> 01:56:15.600
as Joe and Hunter Matt saying to play into Rob's tinfoil hat,

01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:18.760
maybe they're in a holding pattern to see what the next gen consoles do with

01:56:18.760 --> 01:56:20.560
discless gaming. Um,

01:56:20.600 --> 01:56:23.640
certainly maybe the margins and things you're talking about when we talk about

01:56:23.640 --> 01:56:25.200
next gen. Yeah, that could be a big thing too.

01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:28.800
I still don't think games are going to go discless anytime soon. And granted,

01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:31.920
they're going to have that as an option, but right now, unfortunately,

01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:33.480
with the internet structure being,

01:56:33.520 --> 01:56:36.080
infrastructure being what it is in the United States,

01:56:36.480 --> 01:56:40.040
it's just not going to happen because you know,

01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:44.440
just the time it takes to download those games, the bandwidth caps that you have,

01:56:44.680 --> 01:56:48.160
people do like physical copies on things. I mean, you look at, you know,

01:56:48.160 --> 01:56:50.640
you have a lot of companies are even selling, you know,

01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:54.320
physical copies of digital games because that's what people are looking for.

01:56:54.680 --> 01:56:58.040
I don't necessarily think that that's going to go away altogether. I mean,

01:56:58.040 --> 01:57:02.000
granted I've been buying a lot of things more digitally than I would have

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:05.000
normally, but it doesn't mean that like, I don't buy physical stuff.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.440
It's just, it depends. Like for me,

01:57:07.440 --> 01:57:10.040
like I don't buy games that often that are huge,

01:57:10.240 --> 01:57:14.960
but like if all my games I'm buying like online or like a 150 gigabyte download

01:57:14.960 --> 01:57:15.720
or something like that,

01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:19.560
I'm definitely going to be considering when I'm buying those and you know,

01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:22.520
maybe scaling back and even looking at like, Hey, you know,

01:57:22.520 --> 01:57:25.080
I've got all these games that I've purchased digitally and I'm not really

01:57:25.080 --> 01:57:26.000
playing them. I mean,

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:29.600
maybe it would have been better if I bought them physically and then that way I

01:57:29.600 --> 01:57:32.800
could sell them back if I really am not going to ever get to it.

01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:35.640
Well, if the life cycle of a console is supposed to be 10 years,

01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:39.200
I would bet in 10 years, we're not looking at one gigabyte caps anymore.

01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:44.000
Those like the in the market is going to force those caps to rise up because you

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:45.440
know, 4k, 8k,

01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:49.440
all that stuff is going to be streaming more just as technology grows that I

01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:53.520
would like to hope is going to have, I'm hoping that, you know,

01:57:53.560 --> 01:57:57.080
whenever we get our next president that hopefully they'll build the drive,

01:57:57.080 --> 01:58:02.080
some sanity into, put somebody sane back in the FCC and all that. Yes.

01:58:02.280 --> 01:58:04.720
So I'm hoping that once, once that happens,

01:58:04.720 --> 01:58:06.160
that maybe things will get a little bit better.

01:58:06.200 --> 01:58:08.640
Well, y'all have to vote to make that happen. But anyway, um,

01:58:08.720 --> 01:58:10.960
another good comment from a Phoenix 77,

01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:14.880
26 saying I would bet that a lot of retailers are paying closer attention to

01:58:14.880 --> 01:58:19.280
stadia. Um, I, but now the thing where,

01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:21.240
here's the thing with stadia, it's, it's,

01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:25.160
it's too new for a lot of these same reasons that the bandwidth caps and

01:58:25.160 --> 01:58:26.760
concerns. But again, like,

01:58:26.840 --> 01:58:28.640
and I mentioned this when I was reviewing stadia,

01:58:28.640 --> 01:58:33.080
thanks to the buddy pass Bobby gave me is that right now I'm only playing

01:58:33.080 --> 01:58:35.000
destiny two in like, you know,

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:38.200
1080p and the bandwidth is not really that bad at all.

01:58:38.200 --> 01:58:41.600
It's not really that much of a concern because I'm lightly playing and I'm not

01:58:41.600 --> 01:58:43.920
really like hardcore playing. Maybe if I was spending more hours on it,

01:58:43.920 --> 01:58:48.000
it might be a different story. But, um, I think Google stadia,

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:51.800
if Google is not willing to commit 10 years to stadia,

01:58:52.080 --> 01:58:54.160
and I think that's where we all sit here and go,

01:58:54.160 --> 01:58:57.560
when is Google committed 10 years to anything besides maybe Gmail and Google

01:58:57.560 --> 01:59:00.000
earth? Right. So I think that's why there's,

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:01.720
might be a little bit of concern here.

01:59:01.880 --> 01:59:03.200
Are they going to commit 10 years to stay there?

01:59:03.200 --> 01:59:05.200
Because they're not committing 10 years to stadia and they shouldn't be

01:59:05.200 --> 01:59:07.200
fucking doing it. Well, and then to that point,

01:59:07.200 --> 01:59:10.360
like if you look at the stadia thing, so say you buy, um,

01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:13.800
the stadia controller and the streaming thing or whatever,

01:59:13.800 --> 01:59:17.680
that's like a hundred bucks right there or over a hundred dollars. You know,

01:59:17.680 --> 01:59:20.960
the prices of the Xbox ones are coming down.

01:59:20.960 --> 01:59:25.960
If you were like looking at like not really doing the 4k streaming all the time,

01:59:26.720 --> 01:59:29.320
or if you just wanted, you know, game 1080 or whatever,

01:59:29.320 --> 01:59:34.280
you might be better off just buying an Xbox one S and doing games pass.

01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:38.520
And then at least you got a full library of games for the same prices where they

01:59:38.520 --> 01:59:41.280
want you to buy in the each individual game, which doesn't make any sense.

01:59:41.280 --> 01:59:45.480
That's fair. Microsoft is about to come for that hard in this next year.

01:59:45.480 --> 01:59:48.460
Watch with this new Xbox is coming out and everything.

01:59:48.460 --> 01:59:51.480
And how are you going to play these newer games on your old Xbox?

01:59:51.640 --> 01:59:54.320
They're going to be using that streaming and cloud technology to make it

01:59:54.320 --> 01:59:58.920
happen. Absolutely. So watch for all that come holiday 2020.

01:59:59.600 --> 02:00:03.360
So, all right, anyway, moving on, speaking of things in the future,

02:00:03.360 --> 02:00:06.760
let's talk about a big franchise that had a big announcement this week. Now,

02:00:06.760 --> 02:00:10.200
not that we follow all the sports games in the world, but you know, we,

02:00:10.200 --> 02:00:14.080
we can all recognize the MLB, the show pretty big franchise.

02:00:14.080 --> 02:00:17.920
It has historically been a Sony exclusive, but, uh,

02:00:17.960 --> 02:00:21.940
this week a joint announcement was made between Sony MLB and the MLB players

02:00:21.940 --> 02:00:23.320
association, uh,

02:00:23.360 --> 02:00:27.800
that there will be a multi-year extension to the contract so that Sony gets to

02:00:27.800 --> 02:00:30.840
keep making these games. But this is the part that's interesting.

02:00:31.120 --> 02:00:35.960
They're going to make additional console platforms beyond PlayStation as

02:00:35.960 --> 02:00:38.000
early as 2021.

02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:41.920
So the next time I'll be the show may be out on the switch because I thought it

02:00:41.920 --> 02:00:45.480
was a Sony developed game. It is. But the problem is,

02:00:45.480 --> 02:00:47.480
is that they were about to lose that license.

02:00:47.480 --> 02:00:50.520
If they were not willing to put it on other consoles. Hmm.

02:00:50.800 --> 02:00:54.580
So in order to keep the license, they're going to put it on other consoles.

02:00:54.580 --> 02:00:57.240
I mean, well, that's good. Cause we don't want EA to get the license.

02:00:57.240 --> 02:00:59.840
So I'm, I'm fine with that.

02:01:00.600 --> 02:01:04.000
So yeah, it's going to be a little weird seeing a Sony game on a Nintendo

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:08.520
platform again, but this is where we're moving to with gaming in 2020 is it's not,

02:01:08.520 --> 02:01:10.400
I mean, hell we already, I,

02:01:10.880 --> 02:01:15.040
I didn't mention this week that I was playing Minecraft on PlayStation four,

02:01:15.040 --> 02:01:20.120
but I was, and I got to say it was a trip signing into my Xbox

02:01:20.120 --> 02:01:20.720
library, excuse me,

02:01:20.720 --> 02:01:25.480
my Microsoft account on my PlayStation and then getting my OLR gamer

02:01:25.480 --> 02:01:27.160
pick on my PlayStation.

02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:30.080
That was the thing that happened this week and that was kind of a trip,

02:01:30.080 --> 02:01:34.840
but in a good way in the, in a I'm playing a Sonic game on my Nintendo kind of way,

02:01:34.840 --> 02:01:37.920
you know, it's, uh, it's, it's quite, quite something.

02:01:37.920 --> 02:01:41.000
But I think this is just where gaming is going in general is that we're going to

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:42.800
see not just more cross platform,

02:01:42.800 --> 02:01:46.320
but we're just going to see that folks are going to see that there's more places

02:01:46.320 --> 02:01:50.640
for the money. I think so. Did you want to add to that dark soccer? I'm sorry.

02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:55.080
No, I just figured that now that Alan has he's here. Oh yeah. Alan,

02:01:55.080 --> 02:01:58.840
did you want to see some of the gifts that, uh, dark soccer got us? Hold on.

02:01:58.840 --> 02:02:02.120
I just lost chat. So I'm like trying to get it back. So sorry. Yeah. Sorry.

02:02:02.120 --> 02:02:04.800
Chat lost you. Yeah, I lost you guys for a minute here.

02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:07.240
So it's hard for me to multitask. That's okay. Um,

02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:11.560
but maybe we should move on to our next story here while I get chat back. Sure.

02:02:11.560 --> 02:02:14.160
Is it me? Yes. Okay. Well, um,

02:02:14.320 --> 02:02:18.880
there are going to be, uh, some, uh, nice, uh,

02:02:20.120 --> 02:02:23.000
oh my gosh, I actually completely just lost my voice for a moment,

02:02:23.360 --> 02:02:27.120
but there has been an announcement by, uh, uh,

02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:32.080
Vanquish Games that there is going to be a, um, if I say Vanquish,

02:02:32.320 --> 02:02:34.680
the game is Vanquish and Bayonetta,

02:02:34.960 --> 02:02:38.440
but they're going to be getting remastered. I cannot talk.

02:02:38.680 --> 02:02:42.440
They're both going to be getting remastered versions coming out soon. Um,

02:02:43.160 --> 02:02:46.920
and, uh, but it's going to be, um,

02:02:47.400 --> 02:02:49.800
looking like they're supposed to be pretty, uh, pretty,

02:02:49.960 --> 02:02:52.520
pretty if I can make words happen,

02:02:52.840 --> 02:02:55.960
but it looks like the real estate for those are going to be April 18th, 2020.

02:02:56.520 --> 02:03:01.400
So there you go. I have completely muffled what I just said.

02:03:01.560 --> 02:03:03.160
Are you sharing a Coke with Brittany?

02:03:05.080 --> 02:03:07.880
It's Brittany's Coke, bitch. Sorry. Uh, for those on the podcast,

02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:11.160
you can't see Alan came into the studio so that, uh, we could,

02:03:11.160 --> 02:03:14.760
I could show him all the things. So this mug was free cause it has chocolate cat

02:03:14.760 --> 02:03:18.480
on it, which yeah, I know is so thank you. Um,

02:03:18.560 --> 02:03:22.080
but then dark soccer, this is, this is definitely you thing. Not a me thing.

02:03:22.680 --> 02:03:26.400
That is, Oh yay. And I was running, I was getting low and I've got mics.

02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:31.200
Oh, sorry. You have Loki's mic. Okay, cool. So yes, so very cool. And then, uh,

02:03:31.240 --> 02:03:32.600
I have a batsamaru one of these,

02:03:32.600 --> 02:03:35.640
but I'm sure you'll steal it cause that's what happens when you're married. Um,

02:03:35.720 --> 02:03:39.160
and then, uh, yeah, they cinnamon roll. Yay. And we always,

02:03:39.160 --> 02:03:43.280
we love a print sock in this house. Yes, we do. The kookier,

02:03:43.280 --> 02:03:47.360
kitschier the better. Well, you can't go any better than burger,

02:03:47.680 --> 02:03:51.920
burgers and pizza. Yes. It's like what we eat,

02:03:51.920 --> 02:03:55.880
represented on our feet. That's very nice of you. The other thing, the board game.

02:03:56.160 --> 02:03:58.800
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I showed him that first. Yeah. The Funko verse.

02:03:58.840 --> 02:04:03.160
So that's pretty cool. So this is for your holidays. Happy.

02:04:04.520 --> 02:04:08.320
What's new in gaming for you since you're here? Um,

02:04:08.360 --> 02:04:12.280
I started checking out, um, uh,

02:04:12.440 --> 02:04:17.000
the final chapters of black Mesa. Uh, you know how,

02:04:18.280 --> 02:04:21.760
they finally put out a version of the game in like 2012 and then the last

02:04:21.760 --> 02:04:25.360
chapter Zen, which was not good in the original. Um,

02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:28.000
they redid it from the ground up was like, Oh,

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.520
Zen's going to come out next year, next year, next year. Well, it's,

02:04:30.520 --> 02:04:34.400
it's finally next year. I'm eight years later and they finished it.

02:04:34.480 --> 02:04:38.160
You can beat the game now for real, the whole thing. And I'm plugged. I'm,

02:04:38.200 --> 02:04:41.240
it's, it's so it's, it's an extra three or four hours of content.

02:04:41.240 --> 02:04:44.960
I feel like it's really long and they did an incredible job.

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:49.680
And the reason why it took them so damn long is because they really had no,

02:04:49.680 --> 02:04:51.840
they knew that Zen was bad, so they wanted to like,

02:04:51.840 --> 02:04:53.040
rebuild it from the ground up.

02:04:53.040 --> 02:04:56.440
So they had to do concept art and like art direction.

02:04:56.440 --> 02:04:59.240
What does this alien civilization look like? And it's all incredible.

02:04:59.360 --> 02:05:03.960
And I can't say enough good things about, um, crowbar collective. All right.

02:05:04.080 --> 02:05:05.400
That's great. And, uh, just,

02:05:05.440 --> 02:05:09.240
just waiting for half-life Alex to not be played. Yeah, exactly.

02:05:10.160 --> 02:05:14.480
You waited too long, Gabe. We don't, we don't care anymore. All right.

02:05:14.960 --> 02:05:17.000
All right. Thanks for stopping it. I'm giving these to you to take with you.

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:20.840
You can put that one in the kitchen and then that cup is for you as well. So go,

02:05:20.840 --> 02:05:22.800
go make, I want bunk beds. You getting me a bunk bed?

02:05:24.200 --> 02:05:27.960
That's a loft bed. It's not a bunk bed. My son wants a loft bed.

02:05:27.960 --> 02:05:29.960
My wife does not want my son to have a loft bed,

02:05:30.640 --> 02:05:33.920
but they have desks built into them and it would solve two of my problems at

02:05:33.920 --> 02:05:35.640
once. There you go. She just,

02:05:35.920 --> 02:05:39.200
she thinks that somehow he's going to fall out of it or like it's not.

02:05:40.400 --> 02:05:42.760
That I have fallen out of a bunk bed and slept through it.

02:05:43.760 --> 02:05:47.640
He won't fall out of a bunk bed or a loft bed because it has,

02:05:47.720 --> 02:05:49.800
it has walls on the sides. Yeah.

02:05:49.960 --> 02:05:54.840
He would have to do some serious like rolling like Katamari style to get up over

02:05:54.840 --> 02:05:58.360
that edge. And I mean, and they make enhanced over thing anyway,

02:05:58.360 --> 02:06:02.000
but you can just tell her that I've slept because he gets up like three or four

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:05.240
times a night to use the bathroom that he might have trouble navigating the

02:06:05.240 --> 02:06:06.080
ladder.

02:06:08.720 --> 02:06:11.720
Okay. Yes. Almost 10 year old son.

02:06:12.080 --> 02:06:13.320
How about you wear a diaper?

02:06:13.320 --> 02:06:15.080
Alan is cackling from the kitchen.

02:06:15.080 --> 02:06:18.600
If you get him a port-a-potty to put on the corner of the bed.

02:06:19.680 --> 02:06:22.720
You know, back when he was much, uh,

02:06:22.760 --> 02:06:27.320
smaller and he was still using the like toddler potty.

02:06:27.680 --> 02:06:31.520
We did put the potty in his room to make it easier for him so he wouldn't have

02:06:31.520 --> 02:06:34.880
to go down the hallway. Hmm. Yes.

02:06:34.960 --> 02:06:37.000
All the stories that you didn't really care to hear about.

02:06:37.080 --> 02:06:38.760
All right, though, let's move on.

02:06:38.760 --> 02:06:40.840
Four reasons I didn't have children.

02:06:42.120 --> 02:06:46.000
Speaking of going to the potty, let's talk about Twitch streams. No,

02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000
nobody's streams. Although they're talking in chat.

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:52.280
Apparently some big broadcaster just got banned and mega 64 podcast because

02:06:52.280 --> 02:06:54.040
someone apparently threw up on their stream.

02:06:54.720 --> 02:06:56.920
I didn't know that was something you hit band for.

02:06:57.160 --> 02:06:59.320
I mean, not that I wanted to do that. Huh?

02:06:59.440 --> 02:07:00.280
I don't think you have it on purpose.

02:07:00.280 --> 02:07:03.360
Did they throw up onto an animal? Because apparently that's been gay.

02:07:03.400 --> 02:07:08.600
Oh, Bobby says it was a lot of drinking. Oh, interesting. All right. Well noted.

02:07:08.600 --> 02:07:10.880
No more drunk shows here at OLR cause we're on Twitch.

02:07:12.720 --> 02:07:16.720
Oh, do it beforehand, right? Wait, I've, I've, I've had a little bit of wine.

02:07:16.840 --> 02:07:19.520
Have I done it on air? I don't think I've had wine since we moved to Twitch.

02:07:20.160 --> 02:07:23.720
I think the last time I was having wine on the show, we were still, um,

02:07:24.080 --> 02:07:26.920
on the show cast. I have a lovely sangria in my fridge.

02:07:26.960 --> 02:07:29.360
You should come over and we'll do a drunk podcast.

02:07:29.720 --> 02:07:34.480
Bobby Blackwell says alcohol is okay if it's tame, but excessive alcohol isn't.

02:07:34.480 --> 02:07:38.200
So if I enjoy a lovely wine in a can, I can do that.

02:07:38.200 --> 02:07:39.280
It's just a big success.

02:07:39.800 --> 02:07:43.720
It's just when you bring in a beer bong into the situation, that's when it's done.

02:07:44.240 --> 02:07:49.000
Rob, you know what we need to do? What? Froze. Mm. Good times. Yeah.

02:07:49.040 --> 02:07:51.840
Yes. All right. It's showing on a mat. It says, Rob,

02:07:51.840 --> 02:07:56.720
don't go full Sally O'Malley last drunk show cause I'm 50,

02:07:57.400 --> 02:08:00.920
50 years old. I'm not 50. So, um, you know,

02:08:00.920 --> 02:08:05.640
most of the news we hear about Twitch streamers and signing contracts end up

02:08:05.680 --> 02:08:06.680
having to be with them,

02:08:06.680 --> 02:08:11.440
leaving Twitch to other platforms like mixer to sign exclusive contracts. Well,

02:08:11.440 --> 02:08:16.280
this time Twitch is kind of getting on that bandwagon to sign some of the top

02:08:16.280 --> 02:08:18.960
streamers to exclusive multi-year deals,

02:08:19.200 --> 02:08:24.200
including such streamers like Dr Lupo or lyric or

02:08:24.200 --> 02:08:25.560
Tim the tap man.

02:08:25.680 --> 02:08:30.680
They have all been signed to multi-year deals exclusive to the Twitch platform.

02:08:31.680 --> 02:08:34.080
And I'm sure that's to help with, uh,

02:08:34.120 --> 02:08:39.120
some of the Exodus that you have with like Ninja shroud and courage and stuff

02:08:39.160 --> 02:08:40.520
like that. In fact, I want to say,

02:08:40.520 --> 02:08:45.520
I saw a story earlier this week as well talking about shroud and actually

02:08:46.000 --> 02:08:51.000
leaving the platform for mixer and that only 15% of his followers came with him

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:55.640
to mixer. Uh, but that's still 15% more than they had before.

02:08:55.640 --> 02:08:59.040
And who's to say that, you know, I mean, I don't know,

02:08:59.040 --> 02:09:03.720
I don't know that more could come later. I mean, who knows?

02:09:05.280 --> 02:09:07.280
Stop trying to make mixer happen. I'm just kidding.

02:09:08.560 --> 02:09:10.640
A little competition is actually, it's super healthy.

02:09:10.680 --> 02:09:14.240
I'd rather have competing platforms, but for sure. Oh,

02:09:14.240 --> 02:09:16.120
an exclusive multi-year deal.

02:09:16.120 --> 02:09:18.760
But it's nice to see Twitch doing what they need to do. But I don't,

02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:20.960
I also feel like, and this is,

02:09:20.960 --> 02:09:24.320
this is the thing about like doing streaming as a full time job.

02:09:24.320 --> 02:09:27.600
And I totally get this as ironic considering what we're doing right now.

02:09:27.840 --> 02:09:29.080
But I think Bobby,

02:09:29.080 --> 02:09:33.440
myself and anybody else that's participated on VOG network would probably say

02:09:33.440 --> 02:09:36.240
that we are hobbyists. This is our hobby.

02:09:36.240 --> 02:09:38.480
We're doing this for the love of the craft for fun.

02:09:38.680 --> 02:09:43.440
We're not doing this to pay our rent. Um, nobody on this network is. Um,

02:09:43.480 --> 02:09:46.680
and I think when you do take it on as a full time job,

02:09:46.680 --> 02:09:48.960
and I'm not one of those haters, believe me, I'm not.

02:09:49.200 --> 02:09:51.840
What I'm actually saying is quite the opposite is that, you know,

02:09:51.840 --> 02:09:55.760
when it comes to that sort of thing, you just have to be careful because, uh,

02:09:55.760 --> 02:09:58.240
what's the famous line from the Rocky or a picture show.

02:09:58.400 --> 02:10:02.840
I made you and I can break you just as easily, not me specifically,

02:10:02.840 --> 02:10:05.760
but I'm talking about the internet, right. And the fandom and that fickle fandom,

02:10:05.960 --> 02:10:08.440
you know, they made you, but they can also break you.

02:10:08.440 --> 02:10:09.920
So that's why I say like,

02:10:10.120 --> 02:10:12.880
if you are going to take on this type of thing full time as your job,

02:10:13.040 --> 02:10:14.840
you gotta be thinking about things, you know,

02:10:14.840 --> 02:10:17.760
like are you saving money for, if this should ever go away,

02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:21.480
are you trying to go to school, I guess, part-time or no, I mean, I'm,

02:10:22.400 --> 02:10:24.040
I could go on a whole other tangent about this,

02:10:24.040 --> 02:10:26.840
but I am very much of the mindset is that you do not have to go to college to

02:10:26.840 --> 02:10:30.600
be successful, but there are plenty of other ways you can get certifications.

02:10:30.600 --> 02:10:33.120
You can still go to classes, you can still, you know,

02:10:33.120 --> 02:10:36.880
be up and up on your industry and join associations, things like that.

02:10:37.040 --> 02:10:40.360
But are you looking at those types of things for heaven forbid, if you,

02:10:40.400 --> 02:10:44.560
you know, that ever fails? Um, I think people should jump all into that.

02:10:44.560 --> 02:10:46.720
And if they love streaming and they love community,

02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:49.080
by all means that passion is going to show through and that's,

02:10:49.080 --> 02:10:51.320
what's going to make you successful. But at the same time,

02:10:51.560 --> 02:10:55.800
you gotta be prepared for, you know, if it should all go away someday, you know,

02:10:55.800 --> 02:11:00.680
look how quickly people get canceled, right? That's the reality of 2019.

02:11:00.680 --> 02:11:04.800
So what's going to happen if you get canceled, you know,

02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:09.160
if I get canceled, then we weren't making money anyway. You know, I,

02:11:09.160 --> 02:11:12.080
I like to think that some of you guys would still show up. I, I,

02:11:12.320 --> 02:11:15.520
I hope I wouldn't say anything really stupid because I try not to say stupid

02:11:15.520 --> 02:11:17.080
things. But as I said,

02:11:17.280 --> 02:11:21.040
I probably did say stupid things 17 years ago on this show because it was

02:11:21.040 --> 02:11:25.960
17 years ago. Things were different. Right. So, um, my point is, is that,

02:11:25.960 --> 02:11:26.400
you know,

02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:29.240
if somebody is making a lot of money and they're living off this stuff,

02:11:29.240 --> 02:11:31.920
they gotta be careful because that could go away someday.

02:11:32.080 --> 02:11:35.240
So the nice thing about the multi-year deal is that at least they have that

02:11:35.240 --> 02:11:36.720
security for some time.

02:11:36.720 --> 02:11:39.520
I mean, this is not something that we normally, we talked about on the show,

02:11:39.520 --> 02:11:41.280
but like, even now,

02:11:41.280 --> 02:11:45.280
like Twitter is changing more of their algorithm stuff and changing some of the

02:11:45.280 --> 02:11:48.000
rules that they have in there, including, um,

02:11:48.680 --> 02:11:52.200
stuff about like harassment of other people and stuff like that,

02:11:52.200 --> 02:11:55.160
where you have like old episodes of like, for example,

02:11:55.160 --> 02:11:58.440
Content Cop that are getting taken off the platform and stuff like that,

02:11:58.440 --> 02:12:02.320
or like all these video old videos that people would put up there are getting

02:12:02.320 --> 02:12:05.440
torn down. And it's like, you have that with the COPPA stuff.

02:12:05.440 --> 02:12:09.720
So then if you have kids friendly content, well, you're fucked. Um, you've,

02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:12.880
it's just like a whole bunch of like stuff that it's,

02:12:13.480 --> 02:12:16.680
it's not good to put all your eggs in one basket,

02:12:16.680 --> 02:12:19.240
especially with like Twitch and stuff like that too.

02:12:20.280 --> 02:12:24.200
You want to have multiple revenue sources coming in, especially you wouldn't,

02:12:24.240 --> 02:12:27.720
I wouldn't want to rely on those platforms specifically for my revenue.

02:12:27.720 --> 02:12:29.960
I would say like a Patreon or something like that.

02:12:30.160 --> 02:12:31.800
If you're going to continue doing that type of thing.

02:12:32.040 --> 02:12:33.200
The one I saw this week though,

02:12:33.200 --> 02:12:36.520
that was really hilarious is the way they got around the YouTube system.

02:12:36.680 --> 02:12:40.520
So you know how like you'll have random like music labels,

02:12:40.520 --> 02:12:42.960
copyright claiming your videos and stuff like that,

02:12:42.960 --> 02:12:46.040
even though like you could be just like humming a tune or something like that.

02:12:46.040 --> 02:12:49.000
Not necessarily even playing or it's incidentally in the background or

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:53.640
whatever. So people have started, um, one of the, this, uh,

02:12:53.760 --> 02:12:58.480
YouTuber decided that I'm going to write a really shitty

02:12:58.520 --> 02:12:59.600
outro song.

02:12:59.880 --> 02:13:04.520
I'm going to put it in one of those music label services,

02:13:04.800 --> 02:13:07.320
and they're going to put that in the content ID system.

02:13:07.520 --> 02:13:09.920
So that means that every video that I put in there,

02:13:10.200 --> 02:13:12.280
I'm copyright claiming my own video.

02:13:12.360 --> 02:13:14.840
So I automatically get the revenue from that.

02:13:14.960 --> 02:13:18.160
And that also means that any video that they put up,

02:13:18.200 --> 02:13:21.120
even if they're not eligible to receive ad revenue from that,

02:13:21.240 --> 02:13:23.080
they're receiving ad revenue from that.

02:13:23.520 --> 02:13:27.400
That is how messed up their system is in order to fix that system so that they

02:13:27.400 --> 02:13:28.200
can't do that.

02:13:28.200 --> 02:13:31.960
That means they actually have to fix the ad system that they have in the way

02:13:31.960 --> 02:13:36.280
that every user wants it to be in the first place. It's brilliant.

02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:37.520
It's fucking brilliant.

02:13:39.280 --> 02:13:41.320
YouTube needs to be needle on a few things.

02:13:41.320 --> 02:13:45.800
So I'm happy to hear about that as well. So, uh, I've been following, um,

02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:47.520
some of the content producers,

02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:51.560
like the ones who do doll modifications and they got put under like a bunch of

02:13:51.560 --> 02:13:54.920
the child, uh, accounts.

02:13:55.040 --> 02:13:58.200
Somebody mistake the doll for an actual child because they do kind of look real.

02:13:58.240 --> 02:14:00.640
No, no, because they thought that it was content for children.

02:14:00.960 --> 02:14:05.560
So children couldn't be subjected to ad revenue or to ads.

02:14:05.680 --> 02:14:06.040
Yeah.

02:14:06.040 --> 02:14:10.760
So there's a big petition going on to allow people to code their own

02:14:10.760 --> 02:14:11.720
channel stuff.

02:14:12.480 --> 02:14:15.680
And it's just because a few of them that have been following for a while now

02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:17.760
have lost their livelihood. So.

02:14:19.200 --> 02:14:22.360
All right. Anyway, who that took a turn, but Hey, it's, uh,

02:14:22.400 --> 02:14:25.960
this streaming culture is, is where we're at and where this show is at now.

02:14:25.960 --> 02:14:29.280
And celebrating one year on a Twitch anyway.

02:14:30.360 --> 02:14:31.320
Anyhow, let's move on.

02:14:31.320 --> 02:14:34.800
We have one more story and then we'll get to our list around table on discord.

02:14:34.840 --> 02:14:37.680
This story has to do with time magazine. You know,

02:14:37.720 --> 02:14:41.640
a lot of people are talking about time magazine and the person of the year and

02:14:41.640 --> 02:14:44.920
the whole Twitter thing that came of that. I ain't going to touch that right now.

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:48.360
But I will say is that I think that discussion took away from, Oh,

02:14:48.520 --> 02:14:52.240
time names, all this other stuff when in that same magazine. Right.

02:14:52.440 --> 02:14:56.880
And so one of the things they were looking at was the top 10 gadgets of the past

02:14:56.880 --> 02:15:01.000
10 years. And, uh, just to name, there's a lot of Apple stuff on there.

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.560
It's not too surprising, but running down the whole list,

02:15:03.560 --> 02:15:07.160
Apple iPad in 2010, the Tesla model S in 2012,

02:15:07.200 --> 02:15:10.480
raspberry PI in 2012, the Chrome cast in 2013,

02:15:10.680 --> 02:15:14.280
the DJI Phantom in 2013, the Amazon echo in 2014,

02:15:14.280 --> 02:15:16.000
the Apple watch in 2015,

02:15:16.200 --> 02:15:21.200
the Apple air pods in 2016 and the X-Box adaptive controller in 2018.

02:15:21.200 --> 02:15:23.200
That's pretty awesome. Actually, I'm all for that.

02:15:23.480 --> 02:15:27.600
But the one that I'm saved for last is a whole console.

02:15:27.600 --> 02:15:32.320
It's the Nintendo switch in 2017 was named one of the top

02:15:32.360 --> 02:15:35.880
consoles. I mean, technically the iPad's a console too in a way, but anyway,

02:15:35.880 --> 02:15:37.720
we'll sit, we'll leave it at the Nintendo switch for now.

02:15:37.920 --> 02:15:39.920
And in there right up on the switch, they said,

02:15:39.920 --> 02:15:41.080
when it comes to gaming on the go,

02:15:41.080 --> 02:15:44.920
no one can top Nintendo's track record beginning with the game boy in 1989.

02:15:44.920 --> 02:15:47.320
But it's the introduction of the hybrid Nintendo switch,

02:15:47.480 --> 02:15:50.080
which you can play either portably or connected to your TV might be the

02:15:50.080 --> 02:15:54.000
company's most important contribution to gaming yet compared to the competition.

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.840
It handily takes the crown as the most important video game console of the

02:15:56.840 --> 02:16:00.960
decade with fans begging developers to bring their next title to the switch.

02:16:01.080 --> 02:16:04.520
It's smartphone inspired portability paired with Nintendo's ever-growing

02:16:04.520 --> 02:16:08.560
library of blockbuster independent and vintage titles makes the switch feel

02:16:08.560 --> 02:16:11.880
like the culmination of Nintendo's idea of what gaming should be.

02:16:12.080 --> 02:16:14.560
So that is, uh, from the time magazine right up.

02:16:14.560 --> 02:16:17.720
If you want to see more details, you will have to go find that magazine. Um,

02:16:17.920 --> 02:16:18.800
but, um,

02:16:19.280 --> 02:16:22.680
pretty neat to see a console like the switch on there as one of the top 10

02:16:22.680 --> 02:16:25.800
inventions or one top 10 gadgets, I should say of the decade.

02:16:25.800 --> 02:16:26.640
What do you guys think?

02:16:27.560 --> 02:16:28.400
I agree.

02:16:29.240 --> 02:16:33.520
I think that it definitely belongs up there with all those illustrious other

02:16:33.520 --> 02:16:34.360
items.

02:16:34.920 --> 02:16:39.280
Absolutely. So pretty cool. Uh, all right. Well with that,

02:16:39.320 --> 02:16:43.080
we will move on to our listener round table via discord and chat.

02:16:43.080 --> 02:16:44.720
If you guys have any questions in our chat room,

02:16:44.960 --> 02:16:48.680
you can go ahead and pose those there in chat while I get discord up and running

02:16:48.680 --> 02:16:51.760
here, cause I'm not currently up and running, but I will get there again.

02:16:51.760 --> 02:16:56.360
If you want to join our discord server, you can over at vog network.com slash

02:16:56.400 --> 02:16:59.400
discord. That'll get you an invite right into our discord server.

02:16:59.600 --> 02:17:01.960
Just please don't be a jerk. If you're a jerk, don't join.

02:17:02.880 --> 02:17:04.440
You can't spell discord without disco.

02:17:04.720 --> 02:17:06.480
That's right. You can't disco Elysium.

02:17:11.880 --> 02:17:14.840
Nobody's in the green room right now. We'll give it a couple of minutes. Well,

02:17:14.920 --> 02:17:16.920
you know, people are being shot. Well, metal mayhem said,

02:17:16.920 --> 02:17:20.600
I'm not calling in tonight, but I do want to say, uh, what did he say about it?

02:17:20.600 --> 02:17:22.320
It was about a sale, but it was one of the chat. Oh yeah.

02:17:22.560 --> 02:17:25.400
Gog is having another big sale right on the heels of the black Friday sale.

02:17:25.440 --> 02:17:28.000
Everybody's having, everybody's having sales right now because it's um,

02:17:28.040 --> 02:17:31.000
look what month it is. Yeah. It's close to the holidays. And you know,

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:34.160
people are thinking about, Oh, those last minute Christmas gifts.

02:17:34.200 --> 02:17:37.480
You sounded like you're from Minnesota for a second. Really? Oh, don't you know?

02:17:37.520 --> 02:17:40.920
It's cause I watched too much drop dead gorgeous. One of my favorite movies.

02:17:41.200 --> 02:17:43.800
I know I've never seen it. What? Yeah.

02:17:43.920 --> 02:17:46.840
I wonder if that's even on any streaming platforms. It's a great movie.

02:17:46.880 --> 02:17:47.400
Keep in mind.

02:17:47.400 --> 02:17:50.360
I've also never seen mean girls all the way through and I can quote that movie

02:17:50.920 --> 02:17:52.880
because it's all my friend's fault.

02:17:52.960 --> 02:17:56.360
I would say that there's movies from the eighties or I can like quote scenes and

02:17:56.360 --> 02:17:58.600
things that happen. Like I think a good example would be planes,

02:17:58.600 --> 02:18:03.080
trains and automobiles. Like everybody knows that scene with Edie McClurg, uh,

02:18:03.080 --> 02:18:05.880
when she's working at the automobile rental or whatever.

02:18:06.120 --> 02:18:07.480
And Steve Martin comes in and goes,

02:18:07.480 --> 02:18:11.440
I want a fucking car that fucking works and I want to fucking and all this

02:18:11.440 --> 02:18:15.360
stuff. And she goes, Oh, do you have a copy of rental agreement? And he's no,

02:18:15.520 --> 02:18:18.400
you're fucked. Like, but I've never seen that movie,

02:18:19.400 --> 02:18:20.880
but I know that scene.

02:18:21.800 --> 02:18:25.040
Do you know, you know what we need to do for, for Gay Jumis?

02:18:26.040 --> 02:18:29.600
Oh yeah. On the 25th, right? We need to find a place that's open.

02:18:30.200 --> 02:18:33.360
That'll be the first challenge. And then we also need to watch gremlins.

02:18:34.640 --> 02:18:37.600
Your favorite Christmas movie. It is my favorite Christmas movie. Everybody,

02:18:37.720 --> 02:18:41.480
everybody always talks about Die Hard as a Christmas movie and like not enough

02:18:41.480 --> 02:18:45.240
people are talking about gremlins. Die Hard is a great movie. Don't get me wrong.

02:18:45.800 --> 02:18:47.800
But it's like, it's the hipster thing.

02:18:48.720 --> 02:18:52.960
I'm sick of the Christmas argument about, about Die Hard. How about shut up?

02:18:53.760 --> 02:18:56.760
You know what I'm saying? We need to talk more about gremlins.

02:18:57.480 --> 02:19:01.360
Even more of a Christmas movie because it actually does have a Christmas theme to

02:19:01.360 --> 02:19:04.640
it. Whereas Die Hard just happened during Christmas.

02:19:05.160 --> 02:19:10.160
And I will arguably say that gremlins two may be better in one of these rare

02:19:10.600 --> 02:19:11.440
circumstances.

02:19:11.640 --> 02:19:15.240
I will watch gremlins, but then you have to watch my favorite Christmas movie.

02:19:15.440 --> 02:19:16.000
What?

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:17.040
Batman Returns.

02:19:17.040 --> 02:19:20.920
Oh hell yeah. Fucking Michelle Pfeiffer. Hell yeah.

02:19:21.320 --> 02:19:22.160
And actually that...

02:19:22.160 --> 02:19:23.600
Batman Returns is my favorite Christmas movie.

02:19:23.600 --> 02:19:28.600
That podcast that I'm fond of, Stuff Mom Never Told You with the amazing Annie

02:19:29.560 --> 02:19:30.400
and Samantha.

02:19:30.880 --> 02:19:35.000
They did their feminist movie Friday and talked about Batman Returns on it and

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:37.200
it was a fantastic episode.

02:19:37.320 --> 02:19:37.760
Yes.

02:19:37.760 --> 02:19:40.200
I fucking love Batman Returns.

02:19:40.520 --> 02:19:43.760
It's, it's a completely underrated Batman film. Like I get it.

02:19:43.960 --> 02:19:45.920
The Nolan trilogy was great.

02:19:46.120 --> 02:19:49.960
I understand why you all love the Dark Knight and unfortunately not enough of

02:19:49.960 --> 02:19:54.960
you like Batman Begins and like the Scarecrow was amazing, but, uh,

02:19:55.160 --> 02:19:58.080
not enough people talking about the Tim Burton Batman years and especially

02:19:58.080 --> 02:20:01.080
Batman Returns, like completely underrated. Yes, it was camp. Yes,

02:20:01.080 --> 02:20:03.720
it had problems, but it was fucking incredible.

02:20:03.720 --> 02:20:07.120
I'm going to say that I do not care for Nicholson's Joker, just saying,

02:20:07.520 --> 02:20:11.040
but fucking Danny DeVito as the penguin. Hello.

02:20:11.080 --> 02:20:13.560
Well, and the Schumacher films were terrible. Both of them.

02:20:13.600 --> 02:20:17.240
I like Schumacher films forever and Schumacher films.

02:20:17.920 --> 02:20:20.680
I don't know of them. Yes, that, yes.

02:20:20.720 --> 02:20:24.120
You mean that period of my life that I saw the movie for free and wanted a

02:20:24.120 --> 02:20:24.880
refund?

02:20:24.880 --> 02:20:27.080
Schumacher's made Phantom of the Opera and nothing else.

02:20:27.080 --> 02:20:28.920
I saw the one with Batgirl for free.

02:20:30.120 --> 02:20:35.120
I went up to Spanish Fort to go see it for free and I still wanted a refund.

02:20:37.480 --> 02:20:39.440
The only good thing about that movie was my popcorn,

02:20:40.080 --> 02:20:44.720
but when summing up a Batman Returns. All right, we have a call. Uh, wait.

02:20:45.200 --> 02:20:47.480
Oh wait. Oh, I thought you had another point. We have a call.

02:20:47.480 --> 02:20:50.600
I want to get to it. So, um, hello. You're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

02:20:52.760 --> 02:20:55.840
You might be muted, so go ahead and unmute and you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:20:55.840 --> 02:20:57.760
Who's this? Meow.

02:21:00.200 --> 02:21:04.200
Four or five still alive. Uh oh.

02:21:05.200 --> 02:21:08.120
Oh, well things happen sometimes. Uh, I guess the,

02:21:08.160 --> 02:21:11.440
but it shows it's still muted. So I'll see if you mean it.

02:21:12.480 --> 02:21:12.800
I'll see.

02:21:12.800 --> 02:21:16.080
So they announced a new character for Street Fighter five championship edition.

02:21:16.120 --> 02:21:18.920
Oh really? Who? Seth. Oh, why?

02:21:18.960 --> 02:21:20.960
But Seth is coming back as a female character now.

02:21:21.760 --> 02:21:22.600
What?

02:21:23.600 --> 02:21:26.120
It's going to be a female character and then they have an nostalgia skin,

02:21:26.120 --> 02:21:27.120
which is the male character.

02:21:28.320 --> 02:21:29.640
Okay. All right. Cool.

02:21:30.480 --> 02:21:33.360
So then Seth is, we'll just refer to Seth as gender fluid.

02:21:34.280 --> 02:21:36.920
Well, he's also made out of metal, so I guess that would work.

02:21:37.520 --> 02:21:42.120
Gender and metal fluid. Non-binary. Okay. So interesting.

02:21:42.640 --> 02:21:45.480
Uh, when did they announce that? Just now tonight?

02:21:45.520 --> 02:21:48.920
It was, yeah, I think they had some sort of event going on right now.

02:21:50.680 --> 02:21:54.640
Uh, Dartusia says as long as Seth isn't the final boss again, that wasn't fun.

02:21:55.200 --> 02:21:58.720
Uh, I don't think so because they have costumes that they're selling and,

02:21:59.360 --> 02:22:02.920
or they have, uh, available. They have a story costume, battle costume,

02:22:02.920 --> 02:22:07.280
nostalgia costume, which is the, the old design and then a summer costume.

02:22:07.880 --> 02:22:09.520
And thank you. That was the other piece I was looking for.

02:22:09.520 --> 02:22:12.720
Act F says the Capcom cup finals were today. Ah, yes.

02:22:12.960 --> 02:22:15.840
So that's where that actually came from. All right, we'll try this one more time.

02:22:16.240 --> 02:22:17.880
Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?

02:22:17.960 --> 02:22:19.480
Make sure you unmute yourself so we can hear you.

02:22:23.160 --> 02:22:26.560
Okay. Well, we tried, I don't think it's a troll.

02:22:26.560 --> 02:22:28.320
I think it's just somebody might be newer to discord.

02:22:28.320 --> 02:22:30.160
So trying to figure that out. So it was a new,

02:22:30.360 --> 02:22:32.640
it was a new name I didn't recognize. So I got excited for a minute.

02:22:32.680 --> 02:22:36.920
And then there's this video that I see if some guy that beat time crisis to both

02:22:36.920 --> 02:22:41.520
as player one and two on one, one credit. Now that's fun.

02:22:42.360 --> 02:22:45.640
Good times. I guess it would be two credits because you know, one and two.

02:22:46.360 --> 02:22:49.840
All right. Well, we're going to go ahead and wrap up, I guess,

02:22:49.840 --> 02:22:53.520
for the night and, uh, close up shop here at orange launch radio. Uh,

02:22:53.520 --> 02:22:56.720
but we do want to thank you guys for tuning in tonight and participating with

02:22:56.720 --> 02:23:01.000
our show tonight. And, uh, Hey, if you did, uh, well actually wait before I do that,

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:03.320
last minute stories, anything else besides the set thing? I'm sorry.

02:23:03.640 --> 02:23:07.200
No, that's pretty much it. Okay. All right. Well, uh,

02:23:07.200 --> 02:23:09.880
I do want to thank you guys for being here tonight and listening to the show,

02:23:10.200 --> 02:23:11.080
uh, participating, uh,

02:23:11.080 --> 02:23:14.680
whether you were here live with us over at Twitch TV or you were downloading our

02:23:14.680 --> 02:23:19.120
podcast feed, we appreciate it either way. Uh, and, um, yeah,

02:23:19.320 --> 02:23:21.600
I definitely appreciate you supporting the show. Uh,

02:23:21.640 --> 02:23:23.480
we'll be back next week to do it all again.

02:23:23.480 --> 02:23:28.160
We'll be right on the heels of Christmas and right in the middle of Hanukkah

02:23:28.160 --> 02:23:29.680
starts next Sunday, right?

02:23:29.840 --> 02:23:32.280
Yeah. So Christmas will be the week after. Yeah.

02:23:32.360 --> 02:23:35.960
And Hanukkah will just be starting. Oh my God. You know what it means?

02:23:36.480 --> 02:23:39.280
Lotka. Good times.

02:23:39.440 --> 02:23:43.120
I'll bring over lots of lot comics and we'll make a lot cause, but, um,

02:23:43.320 --> 02:23:47.960
I might actually make pub cheese to put on it instead of sour

02:23:47.960 --> 02:23:49.200
cream or applesauce.

02:23:49.280 --> 02:23:52.160
So whatever holiday it is that you celebrate, uh,

02:23:52.200 --> 02:23:54.040
we hope you guys have a great one. Uh,

02:23:54.040 --> 02:23:56.000
or if you don't celebrate anything at all, um,

02:23:56.080 --> 02:23:59.200
I hope this opportunity with all the holiday days is a good chance for you to

02:23:59.240 --> 02:24:03.080
catch up on your gaming backlog. That's a, that's a gift too as well. So, um,

02:24:03.360 --> 02:24:05.240
hope everybody, um, has a great next guy.

02:24:05.240 --> 02:24:07.720
Cause I know all the holiday parties are starting in the next couple of weeks.

02:24:07.880 --> 02:24:12.440
So I think this is, you know, we're, we're kind of moving into the, uh, holidays.

02:24:12.680 --> 02:24:16.360
Yeah. SG100 Matt in chat says, I think Rob said he has a ton of lotka mix. I do.

02:24:16.360 --> 02:24:17.280
Do not buy more.

02:24:18.280 --> 02:24:22.960
I did buy more that I had more. Okay. All right. All right.

02:24:24.560 --> 02:24:27.840
Let's go around and everybody get everybody's final thoughts. Um,

02:24:27.920 --> 02:24:29.920
Loki, I guess we'll start with you. What's your final thought tonight?

02:24:30.160 --> 02:24:33.840
Uh, my final thought is I still need to finish my Christmas shopping.

02:24:35.920 --> 02:24:38.240
I realized that the timing is not good for that.

02:24:40.600 --> 02:24:42.720
Um, my final thought is, uh,

02:24:42.760 --> 02:24:45.600
what the UPS kept the power on for the show tonight.

02:24:45.600 --> 02:24:48.880
So thank you Alan for that. Uh, thank you dark soccer for the gifts.

02:24:48.880 --> 02:24:50.600
They're very much appreciated and, uh,

02:24:50.640 --> 02:24:54.240
we'll definitely be using like the mug and those sorts of things. So thank you.

02:24:54.240 --> 02:24:57.360
Thank you. And the socks, cause I love me a print sock. Um,

02:24:57.360 --> 02:25:00.400
and I want to again just thank you guys for watching and those that have

02:25:00.400 --> 02:25:01.280
supported, uh,

02:25:01.320 --> 02:25:04.200
the VOG network channel and some of the special things we did like earlier this

02:25:04.200 --> 02:25:07.760
week, the game awards, and then my own personal channel over at Mr. Rob Roberts

02:25:07.760 --> 02:25:10.040
as well. Definitely appreciate all that support. Um,

02:25:10.080 --> 02:25:12.600
I don't know what else to say. I just need to play some more games this week.

02:25:12.880 --> 02:25:15.640
I've had this weird itch to start final fantasy 12 again,

02:25:15.640 --> 02:25:18.120
cause I never beat it like any of the five times I've played it.

02:25:18.120 --> 02:25:21.640
So maybe that's going to be like a hashtag gaming goal,

02:25:21.800 --> 02:25:25.520
but don't forget, don't neglect your, uh, your bridge baby. Yeah,

02:25:25.520 --> 02:25:27.560
I know. Death stranding. Yeah, I know. I still need to finish that.

02:25:27.800 --> 02:25:31.240
Bridge baby is cute. Uh, dark soccer, your final thought tonight.

02:25:31.640 --> 02:25:34.680
Number one, I freaking love the last episode of the Mandalorian.

02:25:35.360 --> 02:25:39.120
And number two, tomorrow I am going to see reject false icons,

02:25:39.600 --> 02:25:44.600
which is the gorilla's documentary slash movie thing that they're doing as a

02:25:44.600 --> 02:25:48.680
limited run. I got shit seats cause people kept grabbing all the good ones,

02:25:48.680 --> 02:25:50.880
of course, but Dan and I are going tomorrow.

02:25:50.880 --> 02:25:55.480
So I figured that given that I often say reject false icons, um,

02:25:55.520 --> 02:26:00.520
I'm also going to say reject stupid people like stupid people who attack

02:26:00.640 --> 02:26:05.680
autistic girls on Twitter. All right. Well, that's the best be best.

02:26:06.440 --> 02:26:08.880
That's going to do it for another episode of orange launch radio.

02:26:09.080 --> 02:26:11.280
Happy gaming this week. Have a great week, everybody.

02:26:11.280 --> 02:26:15.040
We'll see you in seven days to all over again. Good night.

02:26:15.680 --> 02:26:18.360
