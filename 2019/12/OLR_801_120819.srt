00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Here's your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This week Nintendo disappoints those who paid way too much for an SNES classic as some of its titles start coming in

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Nintendo Switch Online's SNES Simulator, but really, are we surprised?

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This is just one headline where everything old is new again, stay tuned for the rest starting right now on the show, where every gamer has a voice

Orange Lounge Radio

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live tonight with episode number 801 for this December the 8th of 2019

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,000
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me here in our studio as always to talk about video games, gaming culture, the gamer lifestyle, and many many many tangents

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Is DarkSakura or Jamie Summers?

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Hi.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Hi, how are you?

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Full.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Full, yes, thank you.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Oh, I had the box sitting over here, but I just threw it away, but you brought me just a little bit of panda.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Well, I still have more panda if you want some green bean chicken.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Not panda meat, but panda the restaurant.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I still have another egg roll left too.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Maybe later, maybe later. I think I've had plenty enough for now, but yeah.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
And all of a sudden I just realized that after I went and bought the food that I'm making beef stew at home in a crock pot, like a big ass thing of it.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yep, luckily this show's like three hours long, so you might be hungry again by the time you get home.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Well, I started it at like one, so it's by the time I get home it'll be good and ready, but like I even forgot to put wine in it drink.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So I actually made sangria with the rest of the wine because I don't like Merlot and it's a Merlot blend, but it's what I had because I gave away my Beaujolais.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Beaujolais is my favorite red.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
So I'm assuming you have like a crock pot sitting out with all this in it?

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yeah.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It is the season for that type of cooking.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
That's what I thought, but I've made everything from scratch down to the broth.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Wow.

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I made vegetable broth with my leftover veggie scraps and then I took that broth and cooked down soup bones.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Oh.

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So there you go.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
There you go. Cooking with Dark Sakura.

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yep.

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Maybe, maybe a spinoff show coming soon to vlog. We'll see.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I kind of been thinking about it actually.

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Really?

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yeah.

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I would love that. I will come over and help you film it to get some VODs for the Twitch channel and potentially YouTube. I think that'd be fun.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'll overtake Nerdy Nummies as the...

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I think it should be you, but I think your co-stars should be puppets.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And the puppets can be used by Techmaster Loki, also sitting here in studio.

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm using the puppets?

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
No, like you're the puppeteer.

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Oh, I'm doing the puppeteering?

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You're doing the puppets, yeah.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I think there's people that have done it way better than I have.

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
That's true.

49
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I saw one of those today.

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Yeah?

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Harlow.

52
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Oh?

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
He's a YouTuber, but his character is a puppet.

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Oh, okay.

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So he was doing the panel today, and he has the puppet talking. It's cute.

56
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Well, now we couldn't talk about puppeteers and not acknowledge the passing, because a lot of people were talking about this today, the passing of the great Carol Spinney from Sesame Street, which is interesting.

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So for those that are watching on Twitch, and you always see those little...

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And for those listening on the podcast, we always have a little parody intro that's taken from the old TV show, You Can't Do That on Television, where a show is preempted to bring you orange on its radio.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So it's like a throwback to that.

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Usually these Rs are a video game theme for obvious reasons.

61
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:30,000
So Jason is out of town or at an event today or something, so he usually does them on Sunday, but he told me yesterday, he's like, I gotta lock it in tonight because I'm doing this other thing tomorrow, which is fine.

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So I was like, what do I wanna do?

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,000
And a story about Streets of Rage 4 popped on my feed, and I was like, oh, let's do Sesame Streets of Rage.

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Had no idea that the...

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So that was the little intro for tonight.

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I had no idea that that unfortunate news about Carol Spinney would come across today, and I'm like, ooh, now does that look tacky?

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Luckily I put Grover and Elmo in it. I didn't put Big Bird in it, so...

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Or Oscar the Grouch, or I think, what was any of his characters?

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,000
What's just funny is I had watched a YouTube video with him and with a few other people as to how the Muppets are operated.

70
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Oh.

71
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And so he was talking about how to activate, how to do Big Bird and also his understudy for Big Bird.

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's always fascinating when you see those behind the scenes of Sesame Street and you see just how the street is so elevated

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
because obviously a lot of the puppeteering is happening underneath in a basement type of thing. I don't know how else to describe it.

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Like a trench.

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yeah, but it's fascinating.

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Well, that's how Alf was done. Did you know that?

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
How what?

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Alf.

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Oh, I'm not surprised at all.

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,000
But it was apparently really dangerous for the cast because of all the various holes throughout the floor

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
so that they could have it modular and move around with the puppet.

82
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That's why blocking is important.

83
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Blocking is very important.

84
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:50,000
With all the 80s and 90s things that are coming back, I just read a thing today that Reno 911, I guess, is coming back to some mobile apps.

85
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yes.

86
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yeah, right? Although, I don't know. I was like, what the hell is this network?

87
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And it's some new mobile app, which is like short, I guess, I think they're trying to capitalize on TikTok, but it's like professional ones.

88
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Because it's like 10 minute shorts. It's like short attention span theater.

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And I'm like, if Reno 911 is going to be 10 minute shorts, I don't know.

90
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Well, then again, I don't know. The original show kind of it was like.

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yeah.

92
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
So I'll be happy for an alternative to TikTok with their recent controversy.

93
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You know about that, right?

94
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Oh, with the whole China owns them and oh, the LGBTQ content.

95
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Not just not just LGBTQ plus, but anyone in any kind of disability spectrum.

96
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Yeah.

97
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
What they think is people who could be prone to bullying, but what they're doing is actually silencing their voices.

98
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Yeah. You know, I made a TikTok account because I wanted to support one of the local drag kings that I know that uses it.

99
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And for Don.

100
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
For Don. Yeah.

101
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
And so because Don's doing a lot of content on TikTok, so I was like, OK, I'll follow.

102
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Shout out to Don Davenport, one of my faves, local drag king.

103
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
So I wanted to follow Don's TikTok and I was like, oh, maybe I'll get into this.

104
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'll use it. And like the day after I posted my first TikTok, everybody was like, do you know that there's all these issues with this platform?

105
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And I was like, oh, well, maybe not.

106
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Like, I'll support Don and what Don wants to do, but maybe I'll stick to Twitch and some of the platforms that I'm using.

107
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Never making an account.

108
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm still getting used to WTSocial because it has a potential to really work, though, a lot like LiveJournal did.

109
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Yeah, WTSocial, I think, is way too complicated for the common person right now.

110
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:32,000
And that's going to be very important if somebody is ever going to snatch Facebook's crown, is that I think you have to have a platform that's very easy to use.

111
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
To tie this to video games, because I don't want you to think we're like, we do talk about video games, believe it or not, live.

112
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network for Voice of Geeks Network, that's VOG Network, every Sunday night at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

113
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But talking about social networking games, you know, I feel like what you see built into Xbox and Microsoft's platform,

114
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
as well as the PlayStation 4, is heavily influenced by like a feed, like social media.

115
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Like you log on to your PlayStation, you see kind of a rolling feed of, here's what your friends are playing.

116
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Hey, Rob just unlocked a trophy.

117
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Dark Sakura just started playing Detroit for the first time or whatever it happens to be, right?

118
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So it'll kind of show you what's going on.

119
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's kind of interesting that, you know, all that is really confined to either the Xbox app or, you know, in Sony's case, you know, the Sony stuff.

120
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And it's not, they haven't tried to like push for anything bigger for like a gamer social network that, you know, ties into games.

121
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And I mean, Nintendo, well, we all know they're never going to get, and they're just not, they're not going to get online.

122
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Like it's just not going to happen.

123
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Or not online the way people want them to be.

124
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Yeah. I'm kind of surprised Microsoft hasn't really made a strong bid for the online social network space.

125
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Or have they? Did they buy some company I just forgot about, that tanked?

126
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I think they want it all to be in network, some of these companies.

127
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:01,000
They want you to have a reason to be exclusive to their system, unless you're just balling above all, and then you can do them all.

128
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Well, think about it. If Microsoft were to do two key things, make Mixer more than just gaming, like Twitch has done.

129
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Make it more than, which I think you can't, somebody can correct me in our chat if I'm wrong.

130
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I think you can do stuff that's non-gaming on Mixer, but that end of it has really not taken off like it has on Twitch.

131
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:28,000
If you could kind of mix that on Mixer, hehe, with like a social network feed that Microsoft would run or whatever.

132
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I would think there's a lot of power in something like that to take on Facebook Live and everything that Facebook does.

133
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But it's just interesting, Microsoft kind of seems to be wanting to sit out of that space for whatever reason.

134
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Okay, Bobby confirms. Thank you, Bobby, in our chat. Yes, there are IRL Mixer streamers.

135
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I thought it was a thing, but you don't hear about it on that space as much as you do on the Twitch side of things.

136
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I was just thinking, in general, how we talk about live streaming.

137
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:00,000
And do you remember how there was this big thing going on like for Xerox in the 80s where they're like, hey, don't use Xerox as a generic.

138
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You're going to lose our branding. Right.

139
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And how like for some reason, like a little like mostly in England when they refer to vacuuming as hoovering and Hoover's really a brand.

140
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Now, live streaming, people forget there was a site called Live Stream.

141
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Oh, yeah, there was. And that's where I used to stream my artwork when I was doing all my Mass Effect artwork.

142
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
But now this term has become a generic for things that you do on Twitch and Mixer and all these other things.

143
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I was just thinking about it as like, do people actually remember the live stream site?

144
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:42,000
A similar type of thing happened to a podcasting because, you know, it was called that in the beginning before it was ever in iTunes or Apple embraced it

145
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:50,000
because the concept was downloading, you know, audio RSS, which is what it is, downloading audio RSS feed to your iPod.

146
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I mean, because this was even maybe before iPhones were really everywhere, even Android or whatever you want to say in that space.

147
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Smartphones were everywhere. And then, you know, Apple embraced it as podcasting as well and really put that out there.

148
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:09,000
And remember when Microsoft tried to get in it, they were like, it's Zune casts or other people would try to stop trying to make Zune happen.

149
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
OK, it didn't like that term podcast like it hasn't gone away.

150
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And now it's generic. Google uses podcasts. Podcasts are now on Spotify.

151
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You know, even though technically it's audio RSS, that common thing of podcast is everywhere.

152
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Well, it's just funny the way the language works and branding works, really, to be perfectly honest.

153
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
When the branding is so strong, that's something that a company has to worry about.

154
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Well, even like Nintendo has to deal with that, because, you know, how many times in, you know, the late 80s and mid 90s up to that,

155
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
your video game system, no matter what it was, was just called a Nintendo.

156
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Or in the south, how every soft drink is a Coke.

157
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And so, I mean, now we're getting actually more into the business side of things.

158
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
But I just thought it was funny that we talk about live streaming now, but who remembers the live stream website?

159
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Right. But they weren't really the first, though.

160
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
No, they weren't, but they were probably the first big name in it.

161
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:13,000
A couple of comments from chat. Let's see. I believe it was DJ Rama S said the site is actually still around Vameo Bot live stream.

162
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So technically it's still around. Some folks, excuse me, some folks talking about Ustream there.

163
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And Bobby wanted to point out that podcasting, what they've done, what the culture has done to embrace the term,

164
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
even if, you know, you're like, I'm not touching Apple products or whatever, whatever you want to do.

165
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Podcasting is for portable on demand. So pop.

166
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Justify it to yourself however you want to.

167
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:45,000
So let's see. Pod culture says just try and find a damn Pepsi in Atlanta next to impossible.

168
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Hard Rock Cafe. Bobby and I learned that one Dragon Con. Hard Rock Cafe still has Pepsi products in Atlanta.

169
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I used to know where all the Pepsi products were in Mobile because I am not a Coke fan.

170
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I will drink a Coke if that's what's there. But I prefer Pepsi. I'm saying this right now.

171
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I would probably end up murdered by Victoria. No, I know. I understand.

172
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:14,000
But I I'm a Pepsi product kind of girl. I miss Josta. I prefer Josta plain Pepsi.

173
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:21,000
But I think the flavored Cokes like they have that blood orange Coke, the cinnamon Coke was actually pretty good.

174
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
They have all these different vanilla Coke, of course. I think all the flavors Pepsi existed, though, it did.

175
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
But I actually still preferred vanilla Coke, believe it or not. All the flavored Cokes are better.

176
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
There's that orange vanilla. That's OK.

177
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Now, what I did like, though, was peach Coke that was out in Japan. I managed to pick it up at Nijia Market in San Francisco.

178
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And I should have stocked up on that, even though it was full of sugar. It was delicious.

179
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And I hate peaches, too, which is weird.

180
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Akuma JP from Japan in our chat says, I thought Coke was the name of the drinks. Coca-Cola is the brand.

181
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:02,000
No, Coke. Coke is the name of the company. No, no. Coca-Cola. How does it work? Coca-Cola is the name of the company.

182
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And their lead drink is Coke. Right.

183
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Well, and actually the drink is technically Coca-Cola as well. Right.

184
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
But people would shorten it to Coke because, you know, like you do.

185
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And so they ended up incorporating that into their branding. Right. With Coke, too.

186
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Coke Zero. Coke classic. No, it's Coca-Cola classic. Oh, is it? I thought it is interesting.

187
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
But there was new Coke. And that was trying to be edgy. And now we have Coke Zero.

188
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
But I want to say that your diet is, it'll either be Diet Coke or Diet Coca-Cola.

189
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And I think in some places it's actually Coca-Cola Lite. Or, I don't know, I know that Pepsi is technically Pepsi-Cola.

190
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Right. By brand and by beverage. But it's their branding.

191
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
And this interesting metal mayhem in chat says Coke is to Coca-Cola like Rob is to Robert.

192
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Yeah, I guess I guess that kind of works. I would say Cola is the generic name.

193
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
That's why you have things like RC Cola and Pepsi Cola is really what it is.

194
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Because a cola is a type of beverage made from the certain ingredient, which is why Dr. Pepper isn't marketed as a cola.

195
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Right. OK, wow. We got into brand discussion here on Orange D'Andrea.

196
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
What can we say? It's a slower. Are you shaking your head over there? It's a slower news week.

197
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And don't forget Tiger Claw, who brings up Pepsi Zero. Don't forget in the 80s, if you remember your Back to the Future was Pepsi free.

198
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:31,000
RIP Crystal Pepsi, although it can stay buried in the version from the 90s, because when it came back, I was like, damn, this is really sugary.

199
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You know what, though? One time after marching in Mardi Gras. So this is I was in 11th grade.

200
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Last tangent and we're getting the game. They decided because this was when Crystal Pepsi was starting to go away.

201
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:52,000
They just gave us all cases of Crystal Pepsi to drink after it. We were so tired and worn out after all that marching.

202
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
We devoured all of it. It was gone. Nice. Yeah. And that's my story of Crystal Pepsi and Mardi Gras.

203
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
OK, perfect. It's also the same year I got beaned in the head with a Moon Pie.

204
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Well, let's keep talking about brands. Why not? Let's let's stay on the brand message for a little bit here at the top.

205
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
See, it actually does relate a little bit to what I want to talk about here at the top of the show,

206
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
because a big brand in gaming is celebrating their 25th anniversary this week.

207
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:21,000
So this is going to make a lot of you out there go, fuck, I'm old, especially like if you're in your 30s.

208
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And you might remember when you were a kid when the PlayStation first launched or you're me and you're in your 40s.

209
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
And you remember in high school when the PlayStation 1 first launched.

210
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
So the PlayStation celebrates 25 years this week.

211
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And Sony has embraced the anniversary a little bit. They've labeled this on all their social media accounts,

212
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
of course, asking the questions, you know, what's your favorite PlayStation game or PlayStation memory?

213
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,000
And I will ask here in studio a little bit your memories of your first PlayStation console or first experience with PlayStation.

214
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I'll come back to that in a minute. You can answer that in chat as well.

215
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,000
But also, they put together a nice little four minute video that was like one second of a bunch of major PlayStation games.

216
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It would be an opportunity for me to me to play that here on Twitch.

217
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,000
But that video is like four minutes long. And you can go check that out on PlayStation's channel if you want.

218
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
The really important thing, though, that we should mention because of all of this festivities,

219
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
is that CEO Kaz Hirai came out and made another comment on Twitter.

220
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
And that was that's perfect. Oh, the other the retired comedy account. Yes. What did what did they say?

221
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:34,000
They congratulated all the Sony brands, of course, not mentioning the Vita because it's hilarious.

222
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Yeah. And that is not interesting that Vita was left out of that video and PSP and all that stuff. Right.

223
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
If I'm not mistaken, I don't know what that left. I didn't think it was anyhow.

224
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
So, yeah, they put out a neat little video and celebrating, you know, the 25 years of PlayStation.

225
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Some interesting stories have come out about how, you know, that boot up noise on the original PlayStation

226
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
was actually a method of detecting if that was an authentic disk that was in there or not,

227
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:09,000
which you probably figured out if you ever put in a non Sony CD like a type of thing in there, like an audio CD,

228
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
you would hear that little boo doo doo, but you wouldn't hear the little whoosh and the kind of clip in reverse.

229
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
You wouldn't hear the second half of it because it would go right into the audio CD player when you would get that kind of thing.

230
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Don't try. So don't try me because I have that as a ringtone on my phone. It was my alarm for the longest time.

231
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Well, I'm kind of surprised that the Sony accounts or maybe I missed it,

232
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:38,000
which is fine, didn't mention that there actually is a PlayStation 4 theme that you can like make a classic.

233
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And it actually so when you turn on your PlayStation 4, it actually makes that little boot up noise when it goes into the menu.

234
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Perfect. Yeah, perfect. All right. But I need to now not use that anymore.

235
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Sorry, it's loud. Probably came over really distorted on the mic, but that's all right.

236
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm just going to turn it down while I for those of you that had to put your PlayStation on channel three or four, it was probably distorted, too.

237
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Let's see. So Bobby Blackwell says, I use that PlayStation one theme on my PlayStation fours.

238
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Yeah, I was for the longest time. I finally switched it to something themed around the game that I was really into.

239
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And Orange Wright says, I use that PlayStation one theme for a long time. Yeah, it's a good theme.

240
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Go find it if you don't already have it. I don't think it was a limited time theme.

241
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I think it was released to coincide with. Do you remember about a year into the PlayStation 4's life,

242
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
they came out with a classic PlayStation kind of shell for it that was gray and it was in the colors.

243
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It might have been honestly, it might have been like a 20th anniversary thing.

244
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You playing on your phone over there? No, I was trying to get it back to the ringtone I had, which is the link to the past dark world music.

245
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Vidpower in chat says, who here remembers taking out the game CD after this sound and putting in their import game right afterwards?

246
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Who is the one who taught a certain other person in this room how to do it? Yeah.

247
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Well, Dark Soccer, I was going to say, when it comes to game piracy, when it comes to the import games, import specifically, we were really crazy.

248
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:16,000
You were really good at that. Well, you, you, it wasn't, you didn't teach me that trick as much as you did the plug.

249
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Because I had the, the, the, well, I know I showed you how to do the paperclip trick. Yeah, you did show me the paperclip trick.

250
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And then I eventually got that thing because remember, Dan and I hunted up and down for the last PlayStation that had IO port on it.

251
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And KB Toys had one and we bought it because we had to like start using our PlayStation on the side to be able to play anything.

252
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:46,000
So, um, we bought that one and there was, I think it was the GameShark, was it? Something like that was a GameShark type of thing.

253
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
That had like the, the reader and then the spring on it to where it would keep it depressed.

254
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It wasn't, it was not a GameShark, but it was like a GameShark because the GameShark plugged into there too. Yeah.

255
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,000
But, um, but Dan could do like the multi disc swap one too. Yeah. So, and I want to make it clear, I don't endorse piracy.

256
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
But at that time it was very much like, okay, if you're not going to release the game in the States, I'm sorry.

257
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I, then I'm going to just download the Japanese one and play it that way. I'll buy it if it's released.

258
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:19,000
But I didn't even buy, I didn't even download them. I purchased HK copies. Oh, wow. Okay.

259
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:30,000
So it's bootleg copies. And to this day, I will stand by my decision to always buy black DVDs because those would read better in a PlayStation.

260
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Although you cannot use them for burning PC engine games, just saying you have to have a thick archive level disc, either that or tape pennies to your disc for it to be able to read it.

261
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Wow. Because the discs for the PC engine games are so thick and heavy. Yeah. You have to use a disc as, as heavy. Interesting.

262
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:56,000
The weight of it does matter. Wow. Yeah. The more, you know, the more, you know, anyway, obviously adventures in piracy now that, well, now the, uh, consoles are generally region free.

263
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Obviously that's not really an issue anymore. And now you can get the, um, the, the ever drives so much is released worldwide too.

264
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I mean, our PC engine ever drive will play CD games. Yeah. So, and it's actually nice because although we do have a few games that I would, I would like to be able to get the CD out on for our core graphics so that we can get a Japanese arcade card because we have a few arcade card games that we can't play because arcade cards don't work with the converter.

265
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You know, it's interesting. The Sony PlayStation was a huge part of how we in this room kind of all met. Um, and you know, I, I know it sounds like we talk a lot, a lot about this import stuff, but remember this show is really founded because of our mutual love in this room here of music based video games.

266
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:50,000
And the only way you could play dance, dance revolution at home was on a PlayStation with an import copy for a long, I mean, they did release a dance, dance revolution, USA and economics.

267
00:21:50,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I mean, there were some USA versions later on, but like realistically the song lists weren't really as good. Those song lists didn't start getting good until like Xbox and PlayStation two when they started getting things like the different drum label.

268
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I know, but that was PlayStation two, uh, when they got like, Oh no, third mix was great, but I'm saying, um, the U S releases on PS one were not good. Uh, well, I mean, they were like, technically they were fine, but the song lists weren't great, but yeah.

269
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Oh yeah. It was all about playing third mix on an import PlayStation using your mouse dance pads. No, it was the jungle book.

270
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:35,000
That was the jungle book dance. They were small and then trying not to, you know, totally fuck up your under under apartment neighbors. Yeah. Right. That was fun. Good times.

271
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:44,000
So we all met with that because when we met, I mean, when OLR started the PlayStation two was a lot more like, you know, prevalent. More of us had them when OLR started.

272
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:54,000
But I would say when we were first hanging out meeting, cause OLR didn't start, what year did we all meet? That would have probably been early 2001 when we all met.

273
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:13,000
So like, I think PlayStation two was like just coming out, but like, we weren't like, it wasn't, we didn't all own it yet. So we were still kind of on the last wheels of the original PlayStation then playing all these, you know, beat mania, uh, guitar here, or not guitar hero, guitar freaks and all this stuff that was, you know, uh, original Bimani stuff on PlayStation.

274
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:27,000
So it was obviously a lot of big, big, uh, early memories in that regard. Um, Dartut Sia says 2000, 2001. Uh, 2001 was the year I lived at, uh, Melrose place with them who shall not be named.

275
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Um, but I want to say that was earlier in the year, like March or whatever. So I must've met you guys. Maybe it was like late 2000 actually when I met all you guys.

276
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:53,000
So yeah, cause remember I lived at that place for like six months, but I ended up moving out in like October or November. So yeah, that was where I played like a crap ton of WonderSwan games because your roommate had the WonderSwan games that I wanted to play and beat mania for WonderSwan, which was fun.

277
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:03,000
That's a game I wouldn't mind picking up again as beat mania for WonderSwan, but I'd have to have the little scratch pad. Yeah. So anyway, uh, so yeah, we all met really thanks to the PlayStation era.

278
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:14,000
So, uh, outside of those types of memories, I want to ask you guys kind of here to celebrate 25 years of PlayStation and make you feel old. What are some of your early PlayStation memories, Loki?

279
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Uh, well, I remember I bought the PlayStation for Final Fantasy seven, so it would have been playing that. And then, I don't know, I used to, it was one of the games or game systems I used to drag with me to, um, high school all the time.

280
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:42,000
So I actually had a carrying case for it and I'd bring in the PlayStation demo discs and then play like the Cool Borders two demo like a billion times.

281
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:52,000
And, or no, actually, I don't even know if it was the second Cool Borders, that may have been the first Cool Borders game. Um, so yeah, a lot of that.

282
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:04,000
And then I remember one birthday party because I knew you could do it. And that's why they had those stupid, uh, serial ports on there anyways. You can system link games.

283
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Um, and so one game that supported that was, uh, Bushido Blade, I think. And it, it makes it into this weird like first person game. Like you run through like a maze and you attack each other that way.

284
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:31,000
But it's a versus mode, which is really odd, but I did it because I wanted to see what it was. And then I was horribly disappointed by it.

285
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:40,000
But for, for one birthday party, I had a friend bring over his, you know, his PlayStation. We had two TVs and we hooked up that system link cable and we're able to do that.

286
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I'm reading some comments from chat. Uh, act def says jumping flash is probably my earliest PlayStation one memory.

287
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:55,000
My brother-in-law had a PlayStation one with that demo disc and I played it a whole lot, uh, whenever I was at his house. And then a lot of folks in chat talking about demo discs. Remember that era?

288
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:04,000
That was the time. Those are the days, man. I have a lot of place early PlayStation memories though, cause it came out when I was in college.

289
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:13,000
And although my friends like, wait, wait, I'm importing a Sega Saturn. Hell yeah. I want to play your Sega Saturn. What's this Gundam game here.

290
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Um, but, but at any rate, um, I didn't own, I didn't own a PlayStation until I moved out here, but I owned Final Fantasy seven when it came out.

291
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:33,000
And, um, my roommate's boyfriend, um, didn't want his PlayStation at home cause he was in his like graduate classes or something.

292
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:47,000
So it was hooked up to my little 13 inch TV and we played a shit ton of Tushinden, a shit ton of jumping flash, and really just a shit ton of Tushinden. Really a lot of Tushinden.

293
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Uh, Bobby Blackwolf says, I feel like I should stream those PlayStation underground discs. Hell yeah. Like 25th anniversary. It's a, this is the time to be doing something like that.

294
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:06,000
A swung tong, uh, post the memory of going to Walden books and all the PSMs were ripped and the demo discs were gone. Oh yes. That was the worst. That's why you have to subscribe to it.

295
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:19,000
A quest Buster saying on Loki story. I remember taking our PlayStation on vacation one time and hooked it up to the room TV. When the weather was trash, we stayed inside and played Xenogears. So nice. Love it.

296
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Uh, let's see. So my earliest PlayStation memory, I finally bought PlayStation. I bought it because I knew final fantasy seven was going to be coming out on it. And I kind of wanted one.

297
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Um, I, I was actually more into the stuff on PlayStation than I was Nintendo 64, uh, at the time. And I was always a very loyal, like Nintendo guy. Like I love super Nintendo and the original Nintendo, but I wasn't really feeling like I wasn't feeling the, the polygon 3d stuff.

298
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Like it just wasn't what I was into at the time. I appreciate it later. Um, certainly, but you know, at the time I wasn't super feeling it. So, uh, which I know is ironic because the polygon stuff was huge on the CD games, but I don't know.

299
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:04,000
It was, it was really weird, uh, seeing things like Mario and that stuff like on the Nintendo 64, but obviously I was a huge final fantasy Stan at the time and I still am.

300
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:14,000
And so when they said Final Fantasy seven was going to make the jump to PlayStation, I kind of followed and I bought a PlayStation. Eventually I bought a Nintendo 64. I bought one when they came down to like 20 bucks.

301
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:26,000
There was a Pikachu one that you turned it on and the lights light lit up his little cheeks. But anyway, uh, but that that's Nintendo. Uh, as far as Sony goes, I remember saving up the money or no, I use my Christmas money, uh, to go to the warehouse.

302
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Ah, yes. You remember that chain and bought the PlayStation along with crash bandicoot too. That was the first game I really remember playing. So that was, uh, that was, that was my early on experience with PlayStation.

303
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:54,000
And then when I went off to college, I can't tell you how much class I missed to stay behind and play final fantasy seven, uh, street, uh, super street fighter, or excuse me, puzzle fighter, whatever the hell the name of that super puzzle fighter to turbo or whatever parody name

304
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:04,000
they gave that puzzle fighter was a huge time sink in college that, um, yeah, I, I shudder to think about all the time I lost to that game, but that was a huge influential game on PlayStation.

305
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:13,000
And then obviously later on, as we talked about, um, all the music based games and DDR and beat me and stuff was, was really huge later on an influential into the show that we have now.

306
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:25,000
So big thanks to PlayStation for making that all happen. Appreciate that. So, uh, any other PlayStation memories y'all want to throw out there before we move on to our next topic?

307
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
A lot of fun to see seven.

308
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
A lot of fun to see seven. I know.

309
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
And then it was sandwich during nights of the round with quadra magic and repeat.

310
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:42,000
But not, you know what, not everything was roses when it came to PlayStation because I hated, um, legend of mana was the, that was the PlayStation mana game, right? I hated it.

311
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I had an import of it. Uh, I didn't, I didn't care for it.

312
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
And it was a way too text heavy for me.

313
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Yeah. So, um, not everything on play and I did not care for Chrono Cross.

314
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,000
And this is not some silly throwback to, uh, our fight about what the best Super Nintendo game is of all time.

315
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Cause I do appreciate, I certainly love Chrono Trigger and appreciate that game was not into Chrono Cross when I played that.

316
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,000
So PlayStation had some odd sequels, especially on the Square Enix side of things, but that was, that was my opinion.

317
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Although with Chrono Cross, it did still have a killer soundtrack. We all know Scars of Time was one of the all time greatest songs. So, you know, there is that.

318
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
So, all right. Well, moving on to things a little more recent, let's talk a little bit about our gaming weeks.

319
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
As we get into a segment called, uh, how was your gaming week and what types of video games have you been playing this week?

320
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Although I'm noticing as we're broadcasting live on Twitch, I'm missing that from the sidebar.

321
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
So I should probably add that right now while we talk to Dark Sakura about her gaming week.

322
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Well, um, I was playing some Pokemon Sword, which I was pretty happy about. Um, I've beat my second gym.

323
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I'm just, I mean, I'm just taking my time with it. I'm enjoying it, leveling my Pokemans, you know, doing the stuff.

324
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Um, I have my, my Farfetch'd now, my whatever Galarian's Ash level it's called. What are they called? The...

325
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Sirfetch'd?

326
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
No, I don't have Sirfetch'd yet.

327
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
The Farfetch'd?

328
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I have the Farfetch'd for that area. And it's like Galar, Galem.

329
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Galar, Galarian, Galarian.

330
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I've just been calling it Galarian, like speaking of old PlayStation games.

331
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
It's like Galarian's was great.

332
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
You're supposed to say like Galar region or Ga- I don't know how you really pronounce it.

333
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Galar.

334
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Galar region.

335
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Yeah.

336
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Uh, like Alola regionals is Galar regional, but whatever you say Galarian is fine.

337
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,000
My brain can't wrap around it, so I've been calling it Galarian's.

338
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:29,000
So, and then I think of making people's heads explode kind of like, because Galarian's to me was the head exploding game, like the movie Scanners, or was it Scanners or Transfers?

339
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Whatever movie it was that made people's heads explode, I think it was Scanners.

340
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
But anyway, um, I've been playing that.

341
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
We have another pinball in my house that we are borrowing, which is Elvira's scared stiff.

342
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Which I thought was being taken out of my house on Thursday, and I texted Rob in a tizzy,

343
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
You missed your chance!

344
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:56,000
And it turned out that Dan actually loaned out probably the least favorite machine in his favorite that we own, which is Creature from the Black Lagoon.

345
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I don't like Creature, it's just annoying.

346
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Um, but yeah, I did play a crap load of pinball because Dan did League Night, and I made a lot of cookies for that.

347
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Um, I am...

348
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I slacked off a lot on my mobile gaming this week, just because I've had a headache that's lasted me since I was sick from the week before.

349
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,000
And um, I just, staring at screens is just making my eyes hurt.

350
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:30,000
So I've been trying to avoid doing that too much, except for playing Pokemon, which is easier with the ambient lighting in the room.

351
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
And then I've been playing a lot of Chase the Cat around the house.

352
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I don't know, but she's just like really been super playful.

353
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:45,000
And it's been nice to kind of be distracted from the digital just by playing with, you know, my furry little pain in the ass.

354
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
Midna's been super affectionate lately.

355
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Cute.

356
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
My boo boo.

357
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Anything else for the gaming week?

358
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Uh uh.

359
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:02,000
One weird thing that happened, and apparently I'm not the only one this happened to, my Facebook set up in a different language this morning.

360
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I logged in and it was in German.

361
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Honestly, it's doing you a favor keeping you out. I would love it if mine did that too.

362
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Well it actually, a friend of mine logged in and his was in Spanish.

363
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,000
So, and I know I have two factor on, so it's not like anyone can go ahead and change it for me.

364
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I'm really hovering on the fence.

365
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Like I kind of want to as a New Year's resolution or whatever you call it, like going into a new decade, I really want to get rid of Facebook.

366
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I can't.

367
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,000
But see, I realize that the problem with it is it's twofold.

368
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Is that it's way too good for promotional stuff.

369
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Like that's the reality.

370
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,000
Like if I want to promote, hey I'm hosting Rocky Horror, or hey I'm doing this thing, or hey I'm broadcasting Orange Lawns Radio.

371
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Like Facebook remains a strong place to do that because without it, like I can't, like my friends and family, I know they all check it.

372
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Like it's hard. I mean yes, I can send an email, I can send a letter.

373
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Sure, I can do all these other things.

374
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,000
It's not part of people's habitual routine like Facebook is.

375
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,000
And then the other thing that's like really kind of keeping me on there is Messenger.

376
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Our fan pages.

377
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Well, I don't have a fan page.

378
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
We have the Orange Lawns Radio.

379
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Orange Lawns Radio has a fan page.

380
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
And I have a fan page.

381
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
And I do post to my fan page fairly regularly.

382
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I also, my Instagram is linked to my Facebook.

383
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,000
And the only reason I've really done it is because I have friends on there that I have no other way to get in contact with them.

384
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
You know, so.

385
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Yeah, and I'm on the fan.

386
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
One day, and to be fair, one day I'll be like, I'm deleting Facebook, I'm deleting everything.

387
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Then the next day I'll be like, I should make a Rob Roberts fan page so I can put all of my blasts on that particular thing and not my personal feed or whatever.

388
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
And then I can sift through my friends list a little bit and cut out people that I don't know.

389
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I also have a page as a sister for doing sister stuff.

390
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
But I'm actually legit thinking of going back to LiveJournal.

391
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Officially back to LiveJournal.

392
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I have a permanent account. Why the fuck not?

393
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
And honestly, people are like, oh, the Russians are going to get your information.

394
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Not really.

395
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
They already have it.

396
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:05,000
You know, and they still have to adhere to the European standard for privacy.

397
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Which is a lot more stringent than the American standards are.

398
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
True enough.

399
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,000
So I'm honestly thinking about going completely back to LiveJournal for all my stuff.

400
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Renaissance 2020. Let's make it happen.

401
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
All right, anyway, back to video games. Sorry.

402
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Loki, I know you had a very busy day.

403
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I went to a local gaming expo called Sac Gamer Expo.

404
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
So we saw a lot of people and played a lot of things.

405
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
So talking with some of the stuff I saw.

406
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
So they had the Sega Pluto-01 prototype.

407
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Which apparently was an unreleased variant of the Sega Saturn.

408
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
That you could look at. It obviously wasn't doing anything.

409
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
But it was still neat to see.

410
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
It was huge.

411
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
Had a top-loading disk drive.

412
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
And then they had a cartridge slot.

413
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Which was like a memory card slot.

414
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Or memory slot, I guess, like in the Saturn.

415
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
And then, what else?

416
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Got autographs from Kenny James and Kellen Goff.

417
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
So Kenny James is the voice of Bowser.

418
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Which, my kids are like, Bowser talks?

419
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I'm like, well, he growls. I mean, that's sort of, you know.

420
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
So we got his...

421
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Yeah, so he did the laugh.

422
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
And then, of course, Kellen Goff, my son was very excited about.

423
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Because he does the voice of several of the Freddy characters in Five Nights at Freddy's.

424
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Molten Freddy, Freddy Fazbear, and Fredbear.

425
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Yeah, Kellen's great. I met him and I did a panel with him at Dragon Con.

426
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
When I did that Five Nights panel at Dragon Con.

427
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Ah, yes. Awesome.

428
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
He's great, yeah.

429
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
So one of these days I'll try to get him on the show.

430
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,000
Just talk about all that stuff.

431
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Yeah, so we got to meet him and got an autograph and stuff like that.

432
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
What else?

433
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
So I played quite a few games.

434
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
We went through the...

435
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I kind of had it broken up with the exhibitors.

436
00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Which is mostly just people selling vintage gaming stuff and anime things and all that.

437
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
And they had the indie developers section.

438
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Which wasn't as big as the event that I went to in September.

439
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
That was strictly indies in there.

440
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
So we did play some of the games that were there.

441
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
There was the zombie game from last time there.

442
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
So my kids played that for quite a bit.

443
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
They had a few other games I checked out.

444
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
There was a guy from San Jose who had a game that looked pretty cool.

445
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
It was kind of like a slime puzzle game.

446
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
But they had it set up in full-size arcade cabinets.

447
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Which is pretty cool.

448
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
So I got to check that out.

449
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
What else?

450
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
So vintage gaming stuff we went through.

451
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I played a little bit of Mega Race on the 3DO.

452
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Which last time I played Mega Race was on PC on my single-speed external CD drive.

453
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,000
So that was kind of fun to go back and play that and have my kids play that.

454
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
I played a little bit of Mario Clash on the Virtual Boy.

455
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Just kind of like every single thing that they had there.

456
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
A little bit of DuckTales.

457
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
What else?

458
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
They had the sewing machine there.

459
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I don't remember which...

460
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I'm sad I missed it.

461
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Yeah, so they have the sewing machine there.

462
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
And Rob, of course.

463
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
And they even...

464
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
The robot's right here.

465
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
No, not me. The robot.

466
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
The robot, yes.

467
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
And they even had the same for the Super Nintendo.

468
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,000
It was like a full-size AR.

469
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
That was like some military training thing.

470
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
They were showing that.

471
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Which is pretty cool.

472
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
And what else?

473
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
I almost...

474
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Because I had already spent enough money as I was getting autographs for my kids.

475
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:43,000
But then they also had one of the artists, Mark Erickson.

476
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Who's a freelance illustrator who did artwork on very...

477
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
A lot of box art that you might be familiar with.

478
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
For example, Mega Man 2.

479
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
The American one.

480
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
The bad box Mega Man.

481
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
But bad box Mega Man was under direction from a great...

482
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
We can't blame this guy for...

483
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
No, no, no. It wasn't his fault.

484
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
But the NES Strider.

485
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Bad dudes.

486
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
They even had Tetris, Choplifter, and Heavy Barrel and Bulk 3.

487
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Dang.

488
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Jamie, cover your ears for a second.

489
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
I miss the NES Strider. I love that game.

490
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Oh, wait. I'm not mad about the NES Strider.

491
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
The NES Strider?

492
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
Well, because it was based on the manga.

493
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Oh, okay. That's right. Okay.

494
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I know for you the arcade is the definitive.

495
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,000
But the arcade, the Strider is the Strider.

496
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:39,000
But I was this close had I had enough extra money to buy a poster-sized bad box Mega Man 2 signed by the artist for the studio.

497
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,000
We could use some freshening up of the OLR decorum maybe for next year.

498
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Maybe for next year we're gonna sub out some of these posters.

499
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Rob.

500
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I mean, I love me some Kingdom Hearts.

501
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
But Pop'n Music 11, you guys.

502
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Rob.

503
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
That's old.

504
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Pop'n Music 11?

505
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Talk about 25 years of PlayStation.

506
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Rob.

507
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
What?

508
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I was gonna get this for you as a holiday present and it didn't arrive until after I'd already bought the rest of your present.

509
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Okay.

510
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
So I'm just gonna go ahead and tell you what I got you.

511
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Uh-huh. Aww.

512
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I got you a Commodore 64 schematic poster.

513
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Oh, cool.

514
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
And I'm just trying to find an 11 by 14 frame.

515
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Oh, perfect.

516
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Perfect.

517
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Perfect new decor.

518
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,000
So instead-

519
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Oh, frames though.

520
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Uh, lights aren't gonna take well to it.

521
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
So, uh-

522
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Well, then I'll just give you the, the, the, or we can get like a matte thing for it.

523
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Yeah, something that won't, you have to be mindful of the light.

524
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
But yeah, but it was what I initially had ordered and then they said, oh, it's not gonna arrive until well after.

525
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
So I got other presents and then it arrived.

526
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Mm-hmm.

527
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,000
So I'm just gonna go ahead and tell you.

528
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
So it's now, uh, it's now an OLR gift.

529
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
But then the other thing-

530
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Speaking of gifts, I need to, so I need to talk about what the husband got me because all of you.

531
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,000
All of you that have been listening for a little while are gonna laugh at what the husband got me for a gift.

532
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
While I talk about that, you talk about your little, uh-

533
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:53,000
So the other thing I, I, I saw that at the, uh, vendor area that I had to get is a 3D printed Untitled Goose Game Goose.

534
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
That is great.

535
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
It has a bell.

536
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I had to get it for my desk because it's awesome.

537
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
They had several.

538
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
They had one with the bow.

539
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
They had the bell.

540
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
They had one with nothing.

541
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
But you gotta get the bell because it rings.

542
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Did you ever watch the boundary break for the Untitled Goose Game?

543
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Uh, yes.

544
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
His, I just want one of his wings all light.

545
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
I want foldable wings.

546
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I brought in the box because the actual device is way too heavy.

547
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Lord.

548
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,000
But it is a battery backup.

549
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:32,000
It's a UPS to actually, uh, plug things into so that if the power ever goes out, we have an opportunity to save the video and all that good stuff.

550
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
I don't have to go to Twitch Archive or any of those other workarounds.

551
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:41,000
So he was like, I think it's something that wasn't exactly on your list, but you're gonna find it really useful.

552
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
So props to Alan.

553
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:49,000
And all of you out there that like to make fun of the lack of a UPS here in OLR Studio can now officially shut the fuck up.

554
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Thank you.

555
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Uh, somebody fill time while I take this back.

556
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Oh, yes.

557
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
The rest of your con.

558
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Loki.

559
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Uh, yes.

560
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:05,000
And, uh, the other thing we saw, we, like I said, I was trying to get my kids to, uh, be more interested in because they wanted to see YouTubers, but they don't know who these YouTubers are.

561
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Um, but they have like Arlo there, which he's, um, everything pretty well known.

562
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
He's a Nintendo brand ambassador.

563
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,000
You may know him because he is actually, his character is a puppet.

564
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:24,000
And so they had the guy that voices Arlo and he's doing the puppet during the actual, um, Q&A, which I thought was really cute.

565
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,000
But, um, you know, it was cool.

566
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Overall, it was nice.

567
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
The weather could have been better.

568
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Um, also I, they had it in a marathon that was running through Sacramento and that really blocked everything off.

569
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:44,000
So you have to go way around everything to get to the actual convention, uh, which kind of sucked.

570
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Um, oh, we also played VR.

571
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:53,000
They had Beat Saber and they also had that, um, I don't remember what it's called, but I think it's the plank.

572
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:58,000
It's the one where you go up an elevator and then you have to balance on a plank and you could fall.

573
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:04,000
And it's supposed to be scary, but cause it's actually like it's a tiny piece of wood on the ground, but it's very convincing.

574
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
I didn't do that cause it was $10.

575
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
I'm like, no.

576
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Bobby says Richie's plank experience.

577
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Yes.

578
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
I'm not paying money for that.

579
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
I'll play free VR.

580
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I'm not paying for that.

581
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Okay.

582
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Create, unless it's maybe a fundraiser or something.

583
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,000
It's $10.

584
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
No, it's donated to teaching kids to code or something.

585
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
No, it's, it's nothing like that.

586
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
It was just there there to make money.

587
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Well, that's yeah.

588
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
So I, I find it very strange to pro it was the creators of the game there.

589
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
No, no, no.

590
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
It was, it's a VR center.

591
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:38,000
They come in, they demo VR and they give out like 15 minute coupons for like VR time.

592
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Personal interjection.

593
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:48,000
I think that's kind of shady if it ain't your game and you didn't design the VR headset, like I get they're trying to promote their center or whatever, but charging money for that.

594
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Like I, this is America.

595
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
This is those type of thing.

596
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:57,000
And I realize a lot of like Dave and Buster's asks type of places, how that what's that place they charge for VR and stuff.

597
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:03,000
I just think it's a little, you know, like where, where's the cut that's going to the people that made that game anyway?

598
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Well, they would argue it's the cut that they purchased the game from steam or whatever for the license.

599
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Yeah.

600
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
And Bobby says that game is $15 on steam.

601
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,000
That's way too much.

602
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Yeah.

603
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,000
$10 a play.

604
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:23,000
And the reason I guess they, they're justifying that is because they had the buy of a Vive, the Vive pro to run it or some stupid crap.

605
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Donate the money to helping kids code or something useful.

606
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Anyway.

607
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Yeah.

608
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Cause my kids were like, Oh yeah, we can try it.

609
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
They're like, well ask your dad if it's okay to play.

610
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Like I thought they were saying, Oh, cause they're too little for VR.

611
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
I'm like, Oh no, that's cool.

612
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,000
And they're like, it's $10.

613
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I'm like, Nope, Nope, Nope.

614
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
That's going to be a no.

615
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
We'll go, we'll go in the line and play free.

616
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
But I will spend the money on a goose.

617
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Honk.

618
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
There's there's where your VR experience went kids.

619
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
The goose strikes again.

620
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Honk.

621
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Exactly.

622
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I love it.

623
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,000
All right.

624
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Um, so it sounds like you had a good time at the show.

625
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Yeah, it was, it was all right.

626
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
The local shows are usually fun.

627
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I don't know why I didn't go to the one today.

628
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I just, it was okay.

629
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:10,000
It was like, you know, there was a lot of like, everything was like very expensive.

630
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Like the tickets to get in were really cheap.

631
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Cause it was like 10 bucks for an adult kids like under a certain age get in free.

632
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
And like, I probably could have got both of my kids in for free, but like it's everything

633
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
else on top of it.

634
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
That's super expensive.

635
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Like they had a food truck out there.

636
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
It was like 30 bucks for lunch.

637
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
It was ridiculous.

638
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
And the food wasn't that great.

639
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
That's that's where those things really make their money though.

640
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Like I, I don't, I don't want to say too much, but I know people that do conventions and

641
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,000
it's, it's, it's much more about getting people in the door for those types of things.

642
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
And then you're making money off the tables that people are renting, but you need to be

643
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
able to provide them business.

644
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,000
And yeah, to be fair though, they did give away some free posters and I got a really

645
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,000
nice, the one that I actually got signed, the, um, the Bowser poster was, it was someone

646
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
drew it in like an anime style.

647
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
And so it's like Bowser as, um, Godzilla.

648
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
So they have like a helicopter attacking him and stuff, and it's really kick ass.

649
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:03,000
And then they had an anime peach that I got, I'm going to frame them for my kids' room.

650
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
So that kind of like evened it out a little bit because those are really cool and they're

651
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,000
free.

652
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Um, but yeah, I mean, I like all the games stuff there was so expensive.

653
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Like I, I would have partaken in more stuff, but it's just, I didn't have the money.

654
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:22,000
And like autographs too, like 30 bucks a pop, you know, it, it adds up.

655
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
It does.

656
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
It does.

657
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
All right.

658
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Um, anything else?

659
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Uh, no, that's, that's it.

660
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Uh, my gaming week.

661
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Uh, so last week I played a lot of games and this week I kind of don't have as much to

662
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
talk about in that department because, uh, I kind of kept playing those same games.

663
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,000
For example, I was continuing on in Pokemon Shield, those Snorlax raids came out.

664
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
I did a couple of those today.

665
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Didn't catch it, which was depressing.

666
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Uh, it was hard to fill parties for that, which is really depressing because the NPCs

667
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
are really stupid.

668
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Um, so again, the, the, the Nintendo's online system and the whole way that's designed with

669
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
the, and I realized this is part of the design of the Pokemon game as well, uh, is, is really

670
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
holding that whole end of it back.

671
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Like it just, it needs to be easier to find and join raids and stuff, uh, than it is currently.

672
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I just, it's silly.

673
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Um, especially when you're going to be promoting these types of limited time events that are

674
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
pretty hard.

675
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
So just, just my opinion.

676
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Otherwise I still feel Pokemon Shield's a strong title and I'm continuing to work on

677
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,000
my decks a little bit, but I'll save some of that for some live streaming as well.

678
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Um, cause I was trying to be a good boy and do more Twitch streams this week.

679
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Um, uh, I did like a Final Fantasy 14 stream a little earlier this week, so there was that.

680
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Um, let's see, other things, uh, that I played this week.

681
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I also, uh, played a little more Death Stranding, uh, a little more Final Fantasy 14, getting

682
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
into, uh, uh, Gathering.

683
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Uh, Botany was trying to level that up cause one of my friends was like, oh, you're doing

684
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,000
it wrong.

685
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
You need to be doing scripts, do collectibles for yellow scripts and the levels will fly

686
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
by.

687
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Uh, and that's very true.

688
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Um, so I have been, uh, working on that a little bit.

689
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Um, then of course some of my other old standbys, I was playing a lot of Pokemon Go this week.

690
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
I was hanging out with a friend and we walked all around downtown, caught a ton of Pokemon.

691
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Uh, no shinies for me.

692
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
My friend caught a shiny, uh, Eevee randomly.

693
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Uh, but, uh, even better, you know what I think is even better than shinies?

694
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
100% IV Pokemon.

695
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
So I did catch a 15, 15, 15 Ralts.

696
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Finally a useful 100%er that I caught in the wild.

697
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
So that was very cool.

698
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Uh, so I was very, very happy about that.

699
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Uh, so that was a little Pokemon Go.

700
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,000
And then I played, um, also a little bit of Harry Potter, Wizards Unite because of the

701
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,000
event.

702
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Uh, and then I was playing a little bit of Ingress.

703
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
So I'll actually talk about that.

704
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
So, you know, I've been playing Ingress for years, but there was actually an event that

705
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
happened on Saturday.

706
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,000
So we went over to Oakland, even though it was like pouring rain and like, what a ridiculous

707
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
thing to do.

708
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
But, uh, there was kind of a lot of stuff.

709
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Like if, if I went, it would be my sixth hack of the traveling van that was going to be

710
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,000
there, uh, and that gets you a special reward or a special like in-game badge.

711
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,000
And then I'm like, uh, you get double AP for playing.

712
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:07,000
And, uh, what the, um, I was also just shy of 10,000 unique hacks.

713
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:12,000
So I was like, oh, if I go, I could get my 10,000th unique hack as a part of the event

714
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
because you get a little badge in game for it.

715
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,000
So to kind of relate that to Pokemon Go terms, that's like spinning 10,000 unique stops.

716
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
That's what I just did in Ingress this week.

717
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,000
10,000 unique places.

718
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Um, so, uh, that was a private accomplishment, but what was kind of neat about it.

719
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,000
So the actual Ingress event, uh, the play time where you're kind of just trying to get

720
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,000
AP as fast as you can, uh, that was scheduled between one and 3 PM.

721
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,000
So it overlapped with the Pokemon raid event, right.

722
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Which started at 11.

723
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Right.

724
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
So in the noon hour, we were down on the pier and we were raiding, there were two, there

725
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,000
were two gyms, like practically on top of each other, uh, both had Charizards.

726
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
So we were raiding the Charizards.

727
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,000
As we're raiding the Charizard, this guy in a Niantic jacket walks by and says, Hey,

728
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
you guys doing the mission?

729
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
And we're like, no, we're raiding the Charizard.

730
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
And my friend recognizes him.

731
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,000
I didn't recognize him at first.

732
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
My friend recognized him as John Hanke, the CEO of Niantic.

733
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,000
So, um, he was at the event, um, because he's based in the Bay area.

734
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
I mean, that's so surprised.

735
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
And it was really neat.

736
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
He's like, Oh, I'm out doing the mission or whatever.

737
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
We're like, Hey, can we get a selfie?

738
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Uh, but we're doing the Charizard raid right now.

739
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,000
He's like, yeah, no problem.

740
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
I'm going to go get this portal over here and then I'll come back.

741
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,000
So he actually, like, he's actually out there playing Ingress and he's, he's laughing that

742
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:22,000
we're doing the Charizard raid.

743
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
You know, obviously it's like, ha ha, line my pockets.

744
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
No, no, it wasn't that he's actually, he was like really chill.

745
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,000
It was cool.

746
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,000
So, and then he came by and took a picture and, you know, we just kind of said, Hey,

747
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
and just, you know, greeted him and we were talking a little bit about the event, like

748
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,000
good to see it.

749
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,000
And then no, you'd be out today.

750
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
And yeah, he was, um, just kind of out there playing like everybody else.

751
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
So I thought that was really, really cool.

752
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:49,000
I like that the Niantic staff, I hear a lot of the staffers in Los Angeles were at a,

753
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
there was another first Saturday event that happened in Los Angeles.

754
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
And I think a lot of staffers were at that one too.

755
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,000
So I think it's really cool that Niantic people are like getting out in the wild, going to

756
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
some of the Ingress events.

757
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I realized Pokemon goes their moneymaker, but Ingress, you know, was kind of like their

758
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
first.

759
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
You never forget your first.

760
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:08,000
It's also nice that you can enjoy something that you made because like I can imagine,

761
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:14,000
especially with like Ingress having worked on it for so long, it might get like, I don't

762
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,000
want to play this anymore, you know?

763
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
So it's nice to see that they're still enjoying their work.

764
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:20,000
Yeah.

765
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
And even, and I have my own problems with Ingress and just the fact that like amongst

766
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:29,000
this forced move to Prime, um, that really let a lot of the player base was not happy

767
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
with Prime.

768
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
I'm fine with it, but I do realize there's certain, there's certain key things I miss

769
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:36,000
like force sync, like basic, basic things that aren't there.

770
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Um, but I felt like this whole move to Prime was to be to introduce new features and new

771
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
things.

772
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,000
So I'm a little disappointed that still has not shown up and I'm like, I'm, I'm losing

773
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,000
a little bit of patience, but events are always worth coming out for.

774
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,000
And at the same time, um, they were testing some type of event in LA.

775
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:00,000
So they actually were doing like a, what they call the flashpoint event at the LA thing.

776
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
So they're, I guess they're trying, it's just a little slow to come by, but I imagine, you

777
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,000
know, again, Pokemon goes where they're making their money.

778
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
There's probably 20 people working on Pokemon Go.

779
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,000
There's probably four that are working on Ingress, you know, it's probably not, you

780
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,000
know, I understand it's more their pet project, but without it, I don't think you'd have the

781
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:24,000
quality stops that you have now, because believe me, if entrusted completely to the Pokemon

782
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:30,000
players, and I say this as a level 40 mystic, uh, the portal network and the stop and all

783
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,000
that, that, that would suck ass if only the Pokemon players were nominating things.

784
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
I still don't know how to submit a help.

785
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,000
That's the truth.

786
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
It is the fucking truth.

787
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,000
I still don't know how to submit a help ticket for the one I sent back in May that I can't,

788
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
it's not going anywhere.

789
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Uh, I, I'll look it up later and message it to you.

790
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,000
So anyway, uh, so speaking of like GPS games, I'm going to shout out this real quick, just

791
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
because the person that introduced me to this is in chat right now.

792
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:59,000
So I have to kind of give her a little shit, but, um, I downloaded another GPS based game

793
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
called Orna is the name of this game.

794
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:07,000
And it's a very simple kind of RPG ish type of game, but it uses, by the way, is that

795
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:13,000
if I just hit level 71, we're somehow still in a party together, but you'll notice it

796
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
actually is.

797
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Oh, I better not show exactly where I live, but you'll, I mean, it's, yeah, you can't

798
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
see anything.

799
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,000
It just was like three streets, but you can actually see, it looks like 2d.

800
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
It looks like a little eight bit kind of game.

801
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Right.

802
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
And then it actually shows like the map with all the little mobs on it.

803
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
And then you can like fight them.

804
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,000
And it's a little like, I'm looking for this little battle Orna, but the only thing is

805
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:37,000
the only like criticism I have of the game is, um, the fact that like the map seems to

806
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
serve no real purpose.

807
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Like there's no point to go to a park or this place.

808
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
It's just, the map is just like the world around you.

809
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:48,000
I mean, I guess there are like ends and things just put around or whatever, and you can party

810
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
with people if you meet up in real life.

811
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:56,000
And because I guess a Zed and I only live what probably three miles apart, somehow we're

812
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
still in a party a day and a half later.

813
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
She's she's basically carrying me through this game.

814
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
So there is that.

815
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,000
So I thought it was kind of kind of cute.

816
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,000
So I'm not sure the longevity of it.

817
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
But I guess we are somewhat influencer.

818
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Some of you guys in chat are asking about that.

819
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
So how about that?

820
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,000
So I did want to mention since we didn't make it on our show role, but there was a story

821
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:29,000
about Niantic actually partnering with Qualcomm to make AR glasses for Pokemon Go and other

822
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
things.

823
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
So that's kind of interesting that they're working on that.

824
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:38,000
It seems like a natural progression in the state of AR gaming is, you know, imagine if

825
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
you could put on glasses and you will see Pikachu peeking out from behind the bush and

826
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
like what that trailer for the game looked like when it first came out.

827
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:48,000
Like you get one step closer to that, essentially.

828
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
So it could be very interesting.

829
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
You know, someday it'll be pretty interesting.

830
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
I don't.

831
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Ten years.

832
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I don't usually use the AR stuff because it eats fucking battery like no one's business.

833
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
My God.

834
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Yes.

835
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,000
That'll get better.

836
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,000
I played Minecraft Earth a little bit this week, but like it is a battery sink.

837
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Like I went from 80 percent to five percent in 20 minutes and it wasn't accurate because

838
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,000
like in the game was having trouble this weekend, too, because like I would use the camera to

839
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
do the AR stuff and it would get frozen.

840
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
It would like the camera wouldn't move anymore.

841
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,000
And it was really annoying.

842
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,000
So they reboot my phone several times, reboot the game several times and finally got to

843
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
work.

844
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,000
But then like it just I kept hearing this ding ding ding timer thing.

845
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,000
I'm like, what the hell is that?

846
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Like, am I being timed to do something here?

847
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
And then I like logged out because we had to go somewhere.

848
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Oh, shit.

849
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
I have like five percent battery now.

850
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,000
And so I charged in my in my car for like two minutes and went up to 30 percent.

851
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
So obviously that wasn't an exact figure.

852
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
It was just an estimate based on the battery usage.

853
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
But that thing eats battery like like you would not believe and overheats the phone

854
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
just so much like it's so unoptimized.

855
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
It's ridiculous.

856
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
But Pokemon Go was like that at one time, too.

857
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
It was.

858
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
And also just think about how fast the technology is going to progress.

859
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,000
I mean, they're investigating it now because maybe in five to 10 years, this is a reality.

860
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
You know, we just talked about twenty five years of PlayStation.

861
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
And if you think about that, think about what the PlayStation one looked like.

862
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Think about how the PlayStation one ran on CDs.

863
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:19,000
And that was, you know, the biggest the DVDs weren't even I mean, DVDs may have been a thing,

864
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
but they weren't a common thing yet.

865
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,000
You know, at the time the PlayStation one came out.

866
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:30,000
So look at that versus now where we're at with PlayStation four on the cusp of PlayStation five

867
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:35,000
and how now essentially your games aren't even going to necessarily have media.

868
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
They come in magically through the air.

869
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
I think on Wi-Fi. Right.

870
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:46,000
If you're if your PlayStation five is wireless, you there is the media is an illusion.

871
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
There is no media.

872
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:53,000
You know, the quote is, is that any technology suitably advanced enough can be indistinguishable from magic.

873
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Right. So anyway, my point is, is that, you know, the technology may drain your battery like crazy now.

874
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:02,000
But in five, 10 years, either the batteries are going to get bigger.

875
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,000
The technology is going to get better. You know, a combination of all those things.

876
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:12,000
And it's it's it's going to be a reality. So processors will get better and it won't be a big drain.

877
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:20,000
And they'll have, you know, better APIs to run everything or tech architecture to run everything through.

878
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Metal mayhem and chat says DVDs were invented in 1997.

879
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,000
So they weren't around because we're celebrating 25 years of PlayStation. PlayStation was out in 1994.

880
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,000
So DVDs technically weren't around yet. But you are right with the second part of that.

881
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
They become commonplace when PlayStation two was released.

882
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:40,000
I still think personally PlayStation owes a lot of its success to the fact that that thing did play DVDs.

883
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,000
And I think Blu-ray became the predominant format because the PlayStation three play blue rays.

884
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:52,000
I think, you know, even though we talk about that, you know, is is a game consoles and entertainment center, is that so important?

885
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,000
I mean, how many had a Nintendo Wii that was the Netflix device?

886
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
And so not anymore. But, you know, and so forth.

887
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:11,000
I think gaming and entertainment kind of synergizing like that has been hugely important, which is why Xbox One tried this sports ball cable, all this stuff that kind of misfired.

888
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,000
You know, and we don't know what it's going to look like for PlayStation five.

889
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Yeah, they just they marketed that really bad.

890
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:23,000
And I think the message was just kind of like lost in if it had been like it plays games, but it happens to do this, too.

891
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:28,000
And here's I think the picture in picture thing was neat and that could have been as far as they needed to go with it.

892
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,000
You know, yeah, that's like me. I don't know.

893
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Like now that I think about it, it's like I don't hate it so much anymore.

894
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Like just is the messaging was just so bad.

895
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
The original Xbox One was ahead of its time.

896
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:49,000
I think that to mistake, I didn't think mandatory connect that that's not going to convince me that that was something that was needed.

897
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:52,000
And in the messaging was was lost.

898
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:58,000
And I don't think that that was something that necessarily needed to be disclosed right there either, that it was like, I don't know.

899
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,000
It's but yeah, it's whatever.

900
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:07,000
All right. Anyhow, it's funny because this is spawning a little side conversation in chat.

901
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Quest Buster saying, I remember when Netflix's stock price tanked hard when they announced they were phasing discs out before reversing that decision,

902
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,000
because they were going to spin it into a whole nother company that was like Quickster or something.

903
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Yes. And then they wanted to charge you over here and charge over here.

904
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,000
The funny thing is Netflix ended doing doing that anyway.

905
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
They just did it a lot quieter and they did it a few years later.

906
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:36,000
Log into your Netflix account on a computer and you're going to see a little link for DVD and you can still do the Netflix DVD thing.

907
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,000
But it's just it's very quiet now and they didn't spin it into a different.

908
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
I think everybody hated the name Quickster or whatever it was they were calling it.

909
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:47,000
So, no. Anyway, and Bobby is, they still did it.

910
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Just DVD dot com. So anyway, sometimes the messaging is is really what it's all about.

911
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
All right. Anyway, that's enough for our gaming weeks.

912
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Let's get into some gaming news. I was going to do housekeeping.

913
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
I was going to announce the UPS during housekeeping, but I guess we got that.

914
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,000
So I don't know what else to say. There's not going to be a show January 19th.

915
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,000
I think I mentioned that last week, but we officially got the tickets for that show.

916
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:16,000
We may actually there's not going to be a show at the usual time on January 19th.

917
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,000
But I think I was going to talk to you guys about maybe because we haven't done it in a while.

918
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:26,000
If it works for schedules, we'll have it offline, but maybe doing a U.K. time zone show.

919
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,000
Yeah. You haven't done one of those in a while. Are you fun? So it might be my son would love to be on it.

920
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
He keeps asking when you guys are going to do when it's earlier in the day.

921
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:38,000
OK, well, depending on what day we do, we could also kidnap the Sparky the lesser.

922
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,000
So maybe we'll figure something out. So maybe we'll do something.

923
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:47,000
It would be like 11 a.m. or noon our time, which would allow our folks in the U.K. to check the show out at a time.

924
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:52,000
We can have both kids. They'd like to talk about. Yeah. All sorts of. So be a little different.

925
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Oh, thank you, Bobby, for reminding me. Sometimes I forget the shows are separate.

926
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:01,000
So not everybody's going to hear this if I don't say it here. But there's going to be a co stream later this week.

927
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,000
So Bobby and I were just kind of like throwing ideas around.

928
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:09,000
And long story short, we're going to do a stream Thursday night. We're going to do the game awards.

929
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:14,000
We're going to do a little like, I guess, commentary or reaction stream to that.

930
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,000
I like to think of it more as a community stream, like come watch the game awards with our community.

931
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,000
We'll try to give our insight and our critique.

932
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,000
But I want you not to think of that as we're just going to sit there and shit talk the awards the whole time.

933
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,000
It's not going to be that kind of stream. There's enough negativity in the game gaming world.

934
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,000
But if there's constructive critique, we're not going to hold back on any of that.

935
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:42,000
But I think also reactions to whatever they happen to announce at the game awards will be very cool and things along those lines.

936
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:48,000
So Bobby and I, we did something like this for Square Enix when they did their press conference on Monday night during E3.

937
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
We did something very similar to this.

938
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:57,000
And I think it was fun because we were able to just, you know, kind of critique because that was when they announced a lot of the Avengers stuff.

939
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:01,000
And so we were kind of critiquing it, but not necessarily in a purely negative way.

940
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:08,000
I am kind of curious to see this here because other than like some of the announcements like the Resident Evil 3 probably being a thing.

941
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:15,000
I don't really know what they're going to announce. That's kind of, I like going into it not knowing anything.

942
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:20,000
There's a weird rumor going around about like leaked audio confirms that Master Chief is coming.

943
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Oh fuck that. There's always something.

944
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:28,000
I just, I don't understand why Japan where that game was made is going to give a shit about Master Chief.

945
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Is Akuma still watching? Is Halo like recognized in Japan?

946
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:37,000
It wouldn't be Master Chief. It would be like Steve from Minecraft.

947
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,000
I would bet Steve from Minecraft way before I would bet.

948
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Because like Minecraft is like one.

949
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
I'm still going for Master Chef. I want Gordon Ramsay.

950
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Ok, AkumaJP says yes. So maybe, maybe it could, I don't know.

951
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,000
I doubt it.

952
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Wasn't there also though another Spartan in Dead or Alive?

953
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,000
There was. In Dead or Alive 4 there was a female Spartan.

954
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
You're right.

955
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:05,000
And she's officially canon for Halo's universe but not for Dead or Alive's universe.

956
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:09,000
I just, I don't know if I see the Master Chief thing. It just doesn't, like you're right.

957
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Minecraft.

958
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Steve from Minecraft, if it's going to be a Microsoft thing, makes ten times more sex than Master Chief.

959
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:20,000
You could do Alex as an alt character skin stuff. You get the male female stuff going there.

960
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Absolutely.

961
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
But Halo is their flagship franchise.

962
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Sure.

963
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,000
So I would actually put that over any other of their franchises.

964
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
I just, but I also think we also got Banjo-Kazooie already.

965
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:36,000
So I just think, honestly, you know what I really, you know what I honestly do think.

966
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,000
That also was Nintendo first and foremost and Rare.

967
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
I know.

968
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:45,000
You know what makes a lot more sense in my opinion, honestly, is just fucking giving the people Waluigi.

969
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Just giving the people Waluigi just makes more sense than Master Chief.

970
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,000
So I would place bets on that as a Smash reveal.

971
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:58,000
But I do think them revealing a character is not a far-fetched notion at all.

972
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:03,000
This has been done before, like Nintendo has made big announcements before at the Game Awards.

973
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:11,000
I think if you really want to, you know, kind of cross your fingers and your toes, I would hope for some Breath of the Wild 2 footage.

974
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:19,000
More likely, though, is an Animal Crossing info dump because we're only about three months, what, four months out from new Animal Crossing?

975
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:24,000
So that's kind of like the, we'll probably have, set your expectations at the Animal Crossing level.

976
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Not that that's a bad thing, but you know, that's the one that's coming out sooner.

977
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:31,000
But like, wish on a star for a Breath of the Wild 2 footage. That seems to be a little more likely.

978
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Anyway, we will break this all down live, myself and Bobby, on Thursday.

979
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Possibly as an officially recognized thing, because I know we applied for it, but we just haven't heard back.

980
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:46,000
So, but we're, they've said you can co-stream it no matter what, so we're going forward with that.

981
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:53,000
So join our community here over at twitch.tv slash VOG Network, that's V-O-G Network.

982
01:04:53,000 --> 01:05:00,000
I believe the Game Awards start at 5.30 Pacific, 8.30 Eastern, so we'll probably go live right before just to get settled in and all that good stuff.

983
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:06,000
And we'll see you there, so follow along on Twitch and all that stuff for updates.

984
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Alright, now let's get into some gaming news, and some more things maybe we'll see more of at the Game Awards.

985
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
I don't know, Loki, why don't you start us off?

986
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:21,000
So there was a leaked, or it's delisted now, a trailer that appeared on Square Enix's YouTube page,

987
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:31,000
showing off Kingdom Hearts 3 DLC Remind, that's going to be coming on the PlayStation 4, January 23rd, 2020.

988
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:36,000
And then later it'll be released on Xbox One, February 25th, 2020.

989
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Since then, of course, the trailer has, like I said, been delisted, it's private, you can't watch it anymore.

990
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
But the...

991
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Ooh, maybe because it was a Game Awards thing, also.

992
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:51,000
But then you got the information, though, from that, so the official overview, which was posted with the trailer.

993
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
It says,

994
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:27,000
And apparently they had appearances by other Final Fantasy characters, Aerith, Leon, and Yuffie, so...

995
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Interesting.

996
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Interesting that it's still kind of relying on the older Final Fantasy characters than it is the newer ones.

997
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Like, I would have expected, you know, Prompto or something to show up, but...

998
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Well, but then the 7 Remake is on its way, so maybe it does make more sense, I don't know.

999
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
So, pretty neat.

1000
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Yeah, I think people are looking for...

1001
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,000
I still need to go back and play Kingdom Hearts 3, a game I purchased and just, like, forgot about.

1002
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
I played a good chunk of it, but I need to go back and beat it, I really do.

1003
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Because I held back on playing Kingdom Hearts 3 because I've never really played through Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2.

1004
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:04,000
And then I tried watching, like, a summary of Kingdom Hearts, which, mind you, a summary of Kingdom Hearts is, like, three or four hours long.

1005
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:10,000
And I'm like, I don't fucking know what's going on after watching all of that, like, it makes no goddamn sense to me.

1006
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:19,000
So, I think I'll just have to play the game without actually understanding the depth of the story, because it makes no fucking sense.

1007
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Yep. I figured that was...

1008
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Yeah, I've tried to get the story summarized as well, and it's, like, you just have to let it go.

1009
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:37,000
You just have to take it as a visually stimulating, pretty game, and Disney characters, and yelling at Donald because he can't heal.

1010
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
You just have to take it for granted.

1011
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Donald, heal please.

1012
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Alright. Anyway, let's move on. Let's talk about an actual update for Switch Online Classic.

1013
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,000
Yes, we were just complaining about this last week.

1014
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,000
We were just complaining about this last week.

1015
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
They apparently are watching.

1016
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Who knew complaining to the manager works sometimes? No, in all seriousness, we did get...

1017
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
Okay, Karen.

1018
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Okay, we did get... well, you know, okay, tangent, ready?

1019
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,000
You know how they're saying, you know how OK Boomer is a thing, right?

1020
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:10,000
You know, when Billy Dee Williams says he's never heard of gender fluidity. Okay, Boomer.

1021
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
You know, things like that, right?

1022
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Now, apparently, some folks, some younger folks are calling Generation X the Karen generation.

1023
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
That's what I heard.

1024
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Yeah.

1025
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
We are the Karen generation.

1026
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:29,000
But keep in mind that half of us has stayed true to our Gen X roots of apathy and disappointment, and the other half became Karen.

1027
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,000
True.

1028
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
True. Alright, anyway, moving on from that.

1029
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,000
You know what I remember from when I was your age, these were the games for all the rage.

1030
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Actually, I am pretty hyped for these updates for a couple reasons.

1031
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:44,000
So, they're updating both the SNES and the NES library, which is interesting.

1032
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:47,000
So, the SNES library is getting four updates here in the US.

1033
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Star Fox 2, which is a pretty big deal, because that was limited to that Super Nintendo Classic.

1034
01:08:54,000 --> 01:09:00,000
But since that was a limited time thing, if you never were able to get your hands on one, now you'll be able to play Star Fox 2.

1035
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
And see that it wasn't really that great anyway.

1036
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
It wasn't really that good anyway.

1037
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,000
But you'll be able to play that.

1038
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:09,000
A game that I think was a little better, Super Punch Out is also going to be there.

1039
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Kirby Super Star, which I actually didn't realize wasn't already there.

1040
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,000
But that was the... Kirby Super Star is like the mini game collection.

1041
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
The eight games in one that had like the Kirby...

1042
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
I just perked up.

1043
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Wild Gunman and all that, oh yeah, I'm sure.

1044
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Kirby Super Star, fuck yes.

1045
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
I had that game too, that game was fun.

1046
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:30,000
I liked the one that was basically Wild Gunman, but it was Kirby characters, it was cute.

1047
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
Very simple.

1048
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,000
And then Breath of Fire 2, so that's pretty cool too.

1049
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,000
A very big RPG making its way to the Super Nintendo library.

1050
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
So, that alone is a pretty cool update.

1051
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,000
But then, ho ho then, on the NES side.

1052
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:46,000
So, a game that was brought up on the show not that long ago.

1053
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Journey to Silius is coming out on the NES side of things.

1054
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,000
So, that's kind of fun, right? So, you can hear the music now in that game.

1055
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
So, you can check that out on the NES.

1056
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:02,000
But, here is the Weave Snatcher to snatch all wigs in the universe.

1057
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,000
And this is huge on the NES.

1058
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Crystalis is coming out to the library.

1059
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Fuck yes, that game is so good.

1060
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:13,000
And now you don't have to buy that SNK collection just so you can play Crystalis on the Switch.

1061
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
So, that is great.

1062
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
That is a Christmas gift.

1063
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
That is amazing. That's so cool.

1064
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
So cool.

1065
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:25,000
Now, usually I like to look at, well, okay, if this is what's going on in the US,

1066
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
then what's going on in Japan?

1067
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:34,000
And the Japanese releases, they don't look as strong in Japan, I gotta say.

1068
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,000
The Japanese releases are a little different.

1069
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
My original link didn't work here.

1070
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Let's see.

1071
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:45,000
In Japan, they're only getting four games.

1072
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Famicom is getting Famicom Wars.

1073
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
So, that's kind of cool.

1074
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,000
And that's the Wars series where Advance Wars, I think, is the game most of you know.

1075
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,000
So, if you want to go back and play the original one on the NES,

1076
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Famicom Wars is probably the coolest little different thing that's coming out.

1077
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:05,000
But they're not getting Crystalis, and they're not getting Journey to Silius.

1078
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:08,000
They're getting a Sunsoft game called Route 16.

1079
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
That wasn't very good, sorry.

1080
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
That game is going to be coming out on the NES.

1081
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:16,000
And then on the Super Nintendo side, they're only getting Star Fox 2

1082
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:20,000
and the Kirby Deluxe, their version of that game.

1083
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,000
Hoshi no Kirby Super Deluxe is their version.

1084
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
They're getting that.

1085
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,000
They are not getting Super Punch-Out! and they're not getting Breath of Fire 2.

1086
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Did they already have those, maybe?

1087
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
No.

1088
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:36,000
So, this is the first time in a long time, I can think, where Japan did not get as strong.

1089
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Well, unless you're a Wars fan.

1090
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:42,000
If you're all about Advance Wars, then maybe it is a stronger list for you.

1091
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
But for me, it's really not.

1092
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:48,000
But the nice thing is, is that again, and this holds true in Japan as well,

1093
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
the Switch is region-free.

1094
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,000
So, you can always create an account in the other region for free

1095
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:57,000
and download the other region's player, because that's what I did for Japan.

1096
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:02,000
And then once you download it, you can log in with your local account for me,

1097
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:06,000
my American account, and I can play the Famicom and all that stuff just fine.

1098
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,000
So, if I really do want to play Famicom Wars, it is possible.

1099
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
And the same would be true for those of you in Japan.

1100
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,000
If you really, really wanted to play Super Punch-Out! or Crystallis,

1101
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:18,000
which Crystallis must not have been a thing in Japan, I guess.

1102
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
That's kind of surprising.

1103
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
I would have thought that game, I don't know.

1104
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,000
But there might also be weird rights things because of the SNK release.

1105
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
I don't know.

1106
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
There might be some weird rights issues there.

1107
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
I don't know.

1108
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,000
I don't know what the cold up is.

1109
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
But that is what's coming out on the Switch online.

1110
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
So, very jazzed for those updates.

1111
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Wish we were getting them a little more regularly,

1112
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,000
but at the same time, I'll also take what I can get.

1113
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
All right, moving on.

1114
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Dark Sakura.

1115
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:44,000
So, sometimes these slower news weeks, as far as game releases,

1116
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:48,000
we get interesting gaming studies and gaming effects, right?

1117
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
That's one of my big interests is, of course,

1118
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,000
looking at the impact of video gaming on the world

1119
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
and not just the games themselves.

1120
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:59,000
And there was a really good write-up in Psychology Today that,

1121
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:03,000
believe it or not, I read Psychology Today fairly regularly.

1122
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:08,000
This was actually one of the blog posts from December 6th.

1123
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:13,000
It was written by, let me get the fellow's name again, Guy Winch.

1124
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:17,000
And it's talking there about how video games can actually boost

1125
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:21,000
your emotional health and reduce your sense of loneliness.

1126
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:27,000
And this is, you know, phrased in, you know, the bad side of gaming culture,

1127
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:33,000
being sexist, racist, homophobia, video game addiction, stuff like that.

1128
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:37,000
And while there are some detrimental parts of video gaming culture

1129
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:42,000
as a whole, most of the time, you know, when people are reporting on this,

1130
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,000
they're only reporting on the bad because that's what sells.

1131
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
It's what gets attention.

1132
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,000
They're not talking about the positive sides of things.

1133
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:57,000
So, there's an example of actually an EA game called Sea of Solitude.

1134
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:03,000
It came out in 2013, but it was created by Cornelia Geppert after a breakup.

1135
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,000
And the main character, Kay, has to fight with humans

1136
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,000
who have become monsters because they became too lonely.

1137
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:13,000
And she uses that to fight her own loneliness.

1138
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
And it brings out those feelings of emotion

1139
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,000
and somebody who can actually be a little cathartic for them.

1140
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Multiplayer platforms are also really good for people who are, say, homebound.

1141
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:29,000
You know, people with chronic illnesses, people with a disability,

1142
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:34,000
some people who maybe have social anxiety issues or, you know,

1143
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,000
any other thing like that, it helps them connect with a greater community

1144
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:41,000
that they wouldn't have access to in person because of those limitations.

1145
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Also, a lot of these, especially ones that require group effort,

1146
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:53,000
teach teamwork, teach, what's the other thing, delegation, even negotiation.

1147
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:58,000
So, a lot of these things with some of these other levels of social interaction,

1148
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:04,000
even with a 2014 psychology review,

1149
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,000
actually said that video games can help gamers,

1150
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,000
and this is a quote,

1151
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:12,000
flourish psychologically by generating positive emotions,

1152
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,000
boosting individual functioning, and enhancing social connections,

1153
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:21,000
all of which contribute to mental health and well-being, end quote.

1154
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Sorry, I just want to add to what you're saying,

1155
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
the whole, like, you know, when you're talking about, you know,

1156
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
the coordinating with others and things like that,

1157
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,000
I think about, like, taking out, like, big raid bosses

1158
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,000
in a game like World of Warcraft or something,

1159
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,000
especially if you're in one of those groups that tries to be on the cutting edge of things.

1160
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Like, if you're trying to take out big raid bosses,

1161
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,000
bitch, that's project planning at that point because you're planning out,

1162
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,000
okay, who's going to make the craftables?

1163
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Who's going to make the, you know, drop the potion table?

1164
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Who's going to drop the food table?

1165
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Who's going to be working on gearing up?

1166
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Okay, we need a breakout group to go gear up over here,

1167
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
and then we're going to, like, that is your fucking project planning.

1168
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
And there's going to be the snarky bitch that calls everybody out.

1169
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Yeah, or who is leading on Discord, who is marking things.

1170
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:07,000
That all plays into it. Sorry, it's fascinating because it is those type of skills.

1171
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
And I'll keep in mind, I never did anything on Discord.

1172
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,000
I always typed everything out.

1173
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,000
But it does also improve your communication skills overall

1174
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:19,000
because you learn tact and you learn your audience.

1175
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:24,000
So, especially if you're, say, not a person with great typing communication skills,

1176
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
but say you don't have Discord,

1177
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:30,000
this will also teach you how to think quickly, type it quickly.

1178
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Honestly, I learned how to type through just trying to keep up with my roommates on AOL.

1179
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,000
So, but it also will teach you ways of phrasing, positioning,

1180
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
how to show respect to other people,

1181
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,000
because you know the people who are being just complete chuds in, you know, chat.

1182
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:48,000
They're not the ones who really end up getting paid much attention to.

1183
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:52,000
It's the people who are carefully phrasing things, explaining things, the helpful people,

1184
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,000
or as Mr. Rogers said, always look for the helpers.

1185
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,000
But you learn that that kind of communication,

1186
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:03,000
that your positioning skills are what's going to get you more attention,

1187
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,000
more prominence in your various groups.

1188
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,000
This comment from Questbuster in chat is so good.

1189
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Reminds me of a story I read from an old magazine from the 80s,

1190
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,000
digitally archived, that talked about how a psychologist used wizardry,

1191
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:22,000
that's a game, to help troubled youth, not the actual act of wizardry, just to be clear.

1192
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Thanks for that clarification.

1193
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Just to be clear, the game wizardry.

1194
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,000
A psychologist used wizardry to help troubled youth to break out of their shell

1195
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,000
when they started talking about their characters.

1196
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,000
As they became more invested in their character's growth,

1197
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
they started becoming more social.

1198
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
And you know, I think back to my own childhood,

1199
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,000
and you know, obviously I was picked on a lot for being effeminate,

1200
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,000
and I wasn't super into sports.

1201
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:51,000
I played soccer for a long time, but you don't really play soccer on recess grounds.

1202
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,000
I didn't really want to play those same types of games and things like that.

1203
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:59,000
For the record, I would now say that the word effeminate may not be appropriate.

1204
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:03,000
I would say that you had a different masculinity.

1205
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Okay, that came from a perspective of me being 12 years old, to be clear.

1206
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,000
However, all that being said,

1207
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:14,000
I would say that when,

1208
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,000
and I was picked on a lot for the sports things and all that other stuff,

1209
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:20,000
but when I was the cool kid,

1210
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,000
so it's like the bully would beat me up or whatever.

1211
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,000
I didn't get actually physically beat up a lot,

1212
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
but you know, verbally assault me or whatever.

1213
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
And then when nobody else around, it was,

1214
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,000
hey, where's level seven on the second quest in Zelda?

1215
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,000
And you know, at that age,

1216
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,000
I wasn't confident enough to say, you know, fuck you, you fucking fuck.

1217
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Find it yourself, you dumb fuck.

1218
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,000
I wasn't really able to really say that.

1219
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
So I would tell them, you know, because like,

1220
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:50,000
oh, I have a chance to fit in suddenly and be a part of this.

1221
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
And video games were kind of that for me.

1222
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:55,000
So I'm sorry, but Quest Buster's comment about the 80s

1223
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
and the wizardry and helping kids come out of their shell,

1224
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,000
in a way, like games, because that's what I was into when I was younger,

1225
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:05,000
that ended up being the thing that I could connect with other kids on

1226
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:09,000
when some of the things that were more, you know, mainstream,

1227
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,000
like sports and stuff, I didn't connect with.

1228
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Well, and the other thing, too, you remember those stories

1229
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
that were coming out when Pokemon Go came out

1230
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:22,000
about people with severe social anxiety leaving their homes to play Pokemon Go

1231
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,000
and finding that that was their common ground for other people

1232
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:28,000
that they would see outside playing it and expanding their friend groups.

1233
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,000
You know, I've made friends, you know, that like,

1234
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,000
even though I'm not really playing Ingress anymore,

1235
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:39,000
I met, you know, some of the local people in my area playing Ingress,

1236
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:42,000
just I'd see them looking at their phone or I'd have someone say,

1237
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
hey, if you stand a little bit away from that portal,

1238
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,000
you'll cast a better thing.

1239
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:49,000
That's how I learned what I knew for a lot of Ingress tactics,

1240
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:54,000
was meeting, like, Orville in my area.

1241
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Really just fantastic person, really nice.

1242
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
He sadly doesn't play anymore.

1243
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Yeah, well, neither do I.

1244
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Yeah, I know, but, you know,

1245
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
because a lot of that has moved to Pokemon Go

1246
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
and now our chat is lighting up a little bit on Pokemon Go.

1247
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:09,000
ActDef says, I made so many new friends by playing Pokemon Go.

1248
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Absolutely.

1249
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Or, like, Ingress, like Mr. Smoosh's cat sitters,

1250
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:16,000
because even though Dark Sakura is always kind and she'll do it when she can.

1251
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Is it who I think it is?

1252
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:20,000
It's a drive for her, right?

1253
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Do you know Skarina?

1254
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
I'll tell you offline.

1255
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,000
It's not Dana.

1256
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
No, it's not Dana.

1257
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Okay.

1258
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,000
No, although Dana's great.

1259
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
We've been to the movies.

1260
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:36,000
But the two that live really close by have been cat sitting Mr. Smoosh,

1261
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
because, you know, for you, it takes 30 minutes to get out here.

1262
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
I would gladly do it, but it is a schlep.

1263
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Yeah, for them, they're five minutes, you know,

1264
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
and we're going on that cruise in March, right?

1265
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
And so it's going to be a lot to ask of you,

1266
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000
but for these guys, you know.

1267
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,000
I'm trying to convince Dan we need a Disney trip,

1268
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
so I might need help with.

1269
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Oh, sure, we can.

1270
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:56,000
But actually, no, because Ryan lives in my neighborhood now,

1271
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,000
so I can have Ryan do it.

1272
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Yeah.

1273
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
But yeah, the Midnaator.

1274
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,000
I can't say.

1275
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:04,000
Shermanator was so easy with Shermy, and I can't do that with Midna.

1276
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Yeah.

1277
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,000
The brat.

1278
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:10,000
But anyway, I mean, it's like, well, even back when I was playing D&D,

1279
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:14,000
when I started getting into playing my boyfriend at the time, Ben,

1280
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
who we called him Ben the head.

1281
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
He was awesome because he had a big noggin.

1282
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:23,000
He got me into playing rifts, and that expanded my friend group

1283
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,000
just with tabletop gaming, finding people,

1284
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,000
oh, yeah, you want to do this experimental thing that just came out?

1285
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Yeah, go for it.

1286
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Here's your graphing calculator.

1287
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Good luck.

1288
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Because rifts is crazy.

1289
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,000
And then from there, I got into other D&D groups,

1290
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:43,000
and my roommate in college, I became good friends with her.

1291
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Well, you know Gwen.

1292
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Yeah.

1293
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Yeah.

1294
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Because of our gaming group, we had the same circle of friends.

1295
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
The friends group expanded.

1296
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,000
I'm still friends with them.

1297
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
I've seen their children grow up.

1298
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,000
I know we've really taken this story and run with it,

1299
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:01,000
but at the same time, as far as gamings and improving moods

1300
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:06,000
and social interactions and so forth, hello, look at this.

1301
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Look at this.

1302
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,000
This.

1303
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,000
This.

1304
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,000
What is this?

1305
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:14,000
This gives me the same feeling that my old D&D group gave me in Alabama

1306
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:18,000
because I would go through, and I was busy with classes.

1307
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
I would take 18 units.

1308
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
I was that person.

1309
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Or when I broke my ankle, I was just hanging in the group playing magic,

1310
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
my magic group.

1311
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:31,000
I made a lot of friends that way.

1312
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:34,000
But going to my D&D group, whereas I'd tell Grandmom,

1313
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:38,000
I'm going to sacrifice chickens now because she thought it was.

1314
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Yeah.

1315
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Like, I'm going to my weekly chicken sacrifice.

1316
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Okay.

1317
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:46,000
But at any rate, coming here is the same thing.

1318
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
I have that same kind of camaraderie

1319
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:53,000
and that same feeling of a regular place where I know I'm going to

1320
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:56,000
and I will be accepted for myself.

1321
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Or, sorry, I'm a mouthy bitch.

1322
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Deal with it.

1323
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:00,000
And guess what?

1324
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
You both deal with it beautifully.

1325
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,000
It's funny, and maybe Azet can attest to this, too,

1326
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:08,000
because I know Azet from Ingress and that whole community,

1327
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,000
and we were just having a conversation.

1328
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:15,000
We as a group were just having a conversation the other day about,

1329
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:19,000
you know, Ingress is kind of seems like its star is fading a little bit,

1330
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
as they haven't done a lot to really push the game forward

1331
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
as we thought was going to happen with Prime.

1332
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
And the topic came up that was like,

1333
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
if this game were to go under tomorrow,

1334
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:30,000
I'd still go out to Mongolian barbecue with you guys once in a while.

1335
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:31,000
You know?

1336
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,000
It was that kind of thing.

1337
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,000
I would like to meet these people.

1338
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Oh, yeah, sure.

1339
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
And go to Mongolian barbecue.

1340
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:39,000
We will have a Mongolian barbecue night just for you,

1341
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:44,000
but you'll have to boot your game and deploy your aid on the portal.

1342
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Okay.

1343
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
I need more bursters.

1344
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Dude, I will go to some of these portals and just power up my crap.

1345
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Okay.

1346
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Well, I'll do it for you.

1347
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Don't do it tonight because they know I'm busy on Sundays.

1348
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,000
They like to tear it through here.

1349
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Or whatever.

1350
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
I'm thinking Pokémon, but I can still tap them for stuff.

1351
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Sure, of course.

1352
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Yeah.

1353
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Anyway.

1354
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,000
I'll tap that portal.

1355
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,000
But my point is that the game brought us together,

1356
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
but the game doesn't have to keep us together.

1357
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:15,000
Or, like, how often do we go out and play Para Para?

1358
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Perfect.

1359
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:21,000
We all stopped playing DDR regularly many years ago,

1360
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
and that's not an anti-DDR anti thing.

1361
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:26,000
It's a they didn't make DDR for a long time.

1362
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
It was harder to find.

1363
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,000
We all got older and have more medical conditions.

1364
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,000
That's why we expanded our repertoire away from music games

1365
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
and went into the general.

1366
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Yes, yes, yes.

1367
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Into our beautiful little niche on the internet.

1368
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,000
Very much that.

1369
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Very much that.

1370
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Where we are the world's best internet gaming podcast.

1371
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Subjectively.

1372
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
All right.

1373
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,000
And Humble.

1374
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Don't forget.

1375
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,000
And Humble.

1376
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Fuck the whole Humble thing.

1377
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,000
I'll brag all fucking day.

1378
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,000
We've been doing this shit for a while.

1379
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,000
No, no, no, no.

1380
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:00,000
I am beyond hashtag blessed.

1381
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Fuck that shit.

1382
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:05,000
We made this shit happen.

1383
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Let me put the mic down.

1384
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,000
Hashtag blessed.

1385
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Okay.

1386
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Finish your thought.

1387
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,000
But we made this shit happen.

1388
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:16,000
You know, and I was actually even that podcast that I love,

1389
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Stuff Mom Never Told You,

1390
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:20,000
they did a whole thing about the hashtag blessed and the humble brag and everything.

1391
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Fuck humble bragging.

1392
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
I am going to ego brag.

1393
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:28,000
We come to this shit every weekend.

1394
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
We made this shit happen.

1395
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
We got the equipment.

1396
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Well, you mostly got the equipment, but you know, I use my discount.

1397
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:38,000
You know, we made all of this happen.

1398
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,000
The three of us did this.

1399
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:44,000
And I think we have every right to be fucking proud of ourselves.

1400
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
I'm going to put that out there right now.

1401
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:50,000
This is a tangent that I will build my mountain on and die on it.

1402
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
We made this shit happen.

1403
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,000
Fuck humble bragging.

1404
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:54,000
I'm with that.

1405
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
But I think you also have to have a sense of humility.

1406
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
I think about why we had help.

1407
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,000
Sure.

1408
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:03,000
But sure, this this stays here because of the kindness of people like Jason,

1409
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,000
of people like Bobby.

1410
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,000
You know, you're right.

1411
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,000
There's there's help in getting here.

1412
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:10,000
And just the fact that, like, you know, we're not the most downloaded.

1413
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
What most people don't know who the fuck we are.

1414
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,000
But that's that's OK.

1415
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
I can see you guys.

1416
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,000
We can be gracious.

1417
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Yeah.

1418
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:23,000
But I think that we need to put aside a little bit of humility and realize the hard work that we put into making this happen.

1419
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,000
You can have a little bit of both.

1420
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:31,000
You have a little bit of both, but it's just the whole thing like they do the humble brag thing to make it look like, oh, I'm not that important.

1421
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,000
But look at this.

1422
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:40,000
No, there's there's no putting in the humble brag is a little bit of a I am all about bragging for the things that we worked.

1423
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:43,000
Our took us collective took us on to make happen.

1424
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:46,000
And we we can go even further.

1425
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
And but I do have a lot of gracious.

1426
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,000
I'm not just saying, oh, no, fuck all of y'all who helped us.

1427
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:54,000
I'm not saying that at all. Thank you to everyone who helped us.

1428
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Yes. At the same time, we can't discount the effort we put into it.

1429
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Sure. So I didn't mean to tangent in that respect.

1430
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:04,000
No, you're fine. I feel very good about that. She-Hulk says it's not bragging if you did it.

1431
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,000
And Nifty 805 says, yes, Sakura, slay mama. Right.

1432
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Pod Culture says, but do any of you have a Parsec Award?

1433
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:21,000
No, but the Parsec Awards were mostly for like fiction and that type of stuff anyway, which is the only category we would qualify for is a very niche thing.

1434
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,000
But my point is, we may not have that award, but we did.

1435
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:28,000
We were the very first gaming award for the podcast awards.

1436
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,000
That is correct.

1437
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Back when people kind of cared about those. So.

1438
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:36,000
And you know who I got my my because I went to pick it up.

1439
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:41,000
I was and I got it from Adam Curry. Yeah. With his short hair.

1440
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:47,000
And I was like, I was kind of disappointed because I was like, I remember you on MTV and you had gorgeous hair.

1441
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:51,000
I always forget that you actually went to that. You went to that awards thing in person and picked it up.

1442
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Yeah, it was not in San Diego, but I stayed in La Jolla with my friend.

1443
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Yeah. And yeah, no, I actually take it back.

1444
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:07,000
I stayed in Coronado with my sister and then I went out to do that, hung out because Julie and Krista were there hanging out in La Jolla.

1445
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:11,000
It's funny, DJ Rama says, where is that award? At my house.

1446
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:14,000
And Jamie's shelf.

1447
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,000
It's in my house.

1448
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:20,000
To be fair, we did the show at her house for a long time and it was one of those things we never thought to bring over.

1449
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
But yeah, that's funny.

1450
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:27,000
Where is that award? Was she? Well, she went to go pick it up and then she kept it.

1451
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Well, you know, I did. I did drive all the way to San Diego.

1452
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
I remember the night.

1453
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
The PT Cruiser.

1454
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:47,000
I remember the night the three of us went to San Bruno or wherever it was out by the airport for the live 365 awards because that was the year we were nominated for station of the year.

1455
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
I won something.

1456
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Oh, I got the clip speaker.

1457
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,000
You won like a lottery. You didn't win.

1458
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
We got shut out.

1459
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:59,000
I also won like a remote for like it was a.

1460
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Yeah, we all won door prizes.

1461
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:06,000
But did the station win any awards? I don't think we did.

1462
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:11,000
No, we didn't because remember they forgot to even not like read our nomination.

1463
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
Yeah, because you were in the back going, hey.

1464
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:18,000
But yeah, no, we were we were that movie that got nominated for like four Oscars that didn't go home with any.

1465
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:25,000
But it was. But still, that night we kind of like we were going in there and the three of us were together and take it, taking our pictures.

1466
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:30,000
And, you know, we kind of felt like not a parsec award. It was like a podcasting award.

1467
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Yeah, it was like the podcast award.

1468
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
It was simply podcast awards.

1469
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
Yeah, they're still around. They're just very different.

1470
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:41,000
I'll take a picture of it when I know I know where it is. It's on the shelf by my computer.

1471
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Yeah, because I look I've seen it when I've gone to your house. That's how I knew it was there.

1472
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Yeah, I look at that thing with pride and honor and memories of Adam Curry's lack of hair.

1473
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,000
He's still pretty, though. But back then, he was still pretty.

1474
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:57,000
All right. Let's move on. We did a lot of tangents. That was that was good.

1475
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Sadly, we have to go from some good, great topics to not so great.

1476
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:05,000
I mean, it depends how you look at it. I guess it is good news.

1477
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Well, it's not not great that there had been a lawsuit,

1478
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:18,000
but it's good that the outcome is at least positive in the towards the female employees that were part of the lawsuit.

1479
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:31,000
So Riot Games will now have to pay out at least 10 million dollars combined to each of the female employers or employees that they've had for the last five years.

1480
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:35,000
So that's supposed to be split about a thousand ways.

1481
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:47,000
And apparently this is for any workers who had worked at Riot Games between the period of November 2014 and the final settlement settlement day.

1482
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:56,000
It says they'll receive each of an allocation of the fund decreed by their duration and contract status as a Riot employee.

1483
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:06,000
And apparently it represents the degree of justice for women in Riot Games, many of whom previously staged protests against them.

1484
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:14,000
So it's nice to see they're getting paid out. Unfortunately, they had to get that far to the point where that they lost the lawsuit to that.

1485
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:19,000
Yeah. No, I mean, and then that whole subject has been really like when it comes to Riot.

1486
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:27,000
But I, you know, and hopefully this can help us move on. I say us is like the industry and everything.

1487
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:38,000
You know, I can't say us isn't, you know, because I'm not a woman, but I can hope that this will maybe be something that's like, OK, now we can move on and Riot as a company can be stronger.

1488
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:43,000
And maybe the gaming industry can kind of learn from this and make an environment more welcoming to everybody.

1489
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:50,000
So I would hope so to put that gender discrimination behind them. But yeah, we'll see.

1490
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:58,000
I mean, it's a matter of like, you know, after this is done, do things change or is it just like, oh, it's the price of doing business, you know, type of thing?

1491
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:06,000
I don't know. Gaming is for everyone. Put it on the wall, you know, put it in your boardrooms at these gaming companies across America.

1492
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Remember, that should be one of the primary rules of developing games. Gaming is for everyone. Don't forget it.

1493
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Like there's no reason to make people feel excluded. Why? That's a horrible thing. Nobody likes it when that's done to them.

1494
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:31,000
So I just, you know, it's silly. So anyway, I hope this goes a ways in letting the industry as a whole kind of move on and remember and act better and do better next time.

1495
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,000
Yes, definitely.

1496
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:39,000
For sure. OK, anyway, let's move on and talk a little bit about some changes that have happened with Super Mario Maker 2,

1497
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
which I did peek at this week a little bit.

1498
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

1499
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:51,000
Yeah, they did a big update to the game, which is nice because I feel like Mario Maker 2 kind of like came and went and they haven't been doing a lot to maintain it or it didn't seem like they were.

1500
01:32:51,000 --> 01:33:00,000
And then this came out of nowhere. And I think part of the reason it didn't seem like they were doing a lot was because like that whole of the amiibo question mark blocks

1501
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:05,000
and the limited time little sprites you could get for 8-bit Mario mode and all that stuff that was in the original Mario Maker.

1502
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,000
It's kind of gone.

1503
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Yeah, it kind of went away. But now we're seeing maybe a version 2.0 of that, literally, because version 2.0 of Super Mario Maker 2 came out this week on December 5th.

1504
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:22,000
And one of the biggest new things in this is that now there is a Master Sword item within Super Mario Maker.

1505
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,000
It's pretty awesome.

1506
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:28,000
Yeah, and the Master Sword turns you into Link and it gives you new moves.

1507
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:36,000
So now you have a sword, you can shoot arrows and drop bombs and you can do kind of like the little sword hopping kind of is like Zelda 2.

1508
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,000
The downward thrust.

1509
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Yeah, the downward thrust and all that stuff. So it's kind of neat. So obviously these new mechanics will now lend themselves to all these new ideas when it comes to the creator mode.

1510
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:53,000
The only downside is I haven't really found a way to like find these levels specifically.

1511
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Like you either have to find codes on Twitter, you kind of look through the popular stuff.

1512
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Yeah, I don't

1513
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:00,000
It's a little harder to find that. I didn't find an official level.

1514
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
It would be nice if they had a way to, you know,

1515
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Maybe I missed it.

1516
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:07,000
Meta tag these things so that you'd have ways to search stuff.

1517
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:08,000
Yeah.

1518
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:14,000
But that would be too close to the internet. Nintendo doesn't go close to the internet because that's like the sun. They don't fly too close to the sun.

1519
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Dr Tetsuya in chat says, I do like the idea of this better because the Mega Man 1 stuff was just a reskin.

1520
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:23,000
I'm sorry, Mario Maker 1. I don't know why when I see MM1 I go Mega Man.

1521
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Mario Maker 1 stuff was just a reskin, but this is legitimately like having Link and Super Mario Brothers.

1522
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Bobby says, I found a great level that helps you learn the Link stuff.

1523
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Yeah, but usually like in Mario Maker 1, these limited time, you know, skins would come with a demo level, which is usually how you earn the skin.

1524
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
And that isn't here.

1525
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Yeah.

1526
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Which is a little weird, but I mean, again, I'd rather have it than not have it.

1527
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:52,000
So what they did add, which was interesting, was speed running or a level.

1528
01:34:52,000 --> 01:35:01,000
So there was like an official level that will help you with speed running and they call it the Ninji because the little ninja star thing.

1529
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Ninja characters.

1530
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Yeah, they're called Ninji.

1531
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Yeah. So the Ninji levels you and what's cool is that after you beat it and why they call it Ninji is that then all the ghost ninjis that represent other speed runners show up the second time.

1532
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:18,000
So you can see the bar a little better at what there is to beat.

1533
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:22,000
And there is an official, it's a snowball level, right, for the holidays.

1534
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:25,000
So it's not a Christmas level, but it's like a winter wonderland type of thing.

1535
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:31,000
So it has, you know, the little guys, what do you call those guys that throw up the spike balls and then launch them at you?

1536
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:32,000
They were in like Mario 3.

1537
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:33,000
Oh, I don't remember.

1538
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,000
You know what I'm talking about?

1539
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,000
Those guys that would look up and they'd throw up the spike ball and then throw it at you.

1540
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
Yeah, they're new to this patch.

1541
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:44,000
They're now in Mario Maker, but in this Ninji level, they do snowballs.

1542
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Yes.

1543
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:48,000
It's cute, right, because you can pick up the snowballs and throw them back at them.

1544
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Some of the other things that are new in this, oh, it's Spike.

1545
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
The name of the character is actually Spike.

1546
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:57,000
Not to be confused with Game Buoy Spike.

1547
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Happy belated birthday, by the way.

1548
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:01,000
But Spike is the actual name of the character in Mario.

1549
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:06,000
Also added is Dash Blocks, but that's only in Mario 3D World.

1550
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Frozen Coins, which is when they're encased in the ice.

1551
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Have you seen that before?

1552
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,000
P-Blocks.

1553
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Cool.

1554
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,000
That's going to be a big one.

1555
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:18,000
And then Pokey, the stacked cactus thing is now available as well.

1556
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
Which you can make fly and it's kind of crazy.

1557
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:24,000
Which is also a snowman in that limited time level.

1558
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:27,000
So kind of neat that they're adding that type of stuff.

1559
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:31,000
So really cool to see this Mario Maker 2 update just when I was like, oh, I guess that kind of came and went.

1560
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:34,000
No, they're kind of supporting it with some more updates.

1561
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,000
That's really cool to see.

1562
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Happy to see it.

1563
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,000
So yeah, the meta tags.

1564
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:40,000
I like that idea for maybe with the Zelda stuff.

1565
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:43,000
That's how they did it with LittleBigPlanet.

1566
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,000
I mean, it's not a bad idea.

1567
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:50,000
And it helps you find levels better instead of having to have this stupid code exchange crap.

1568
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Seriously, Nintendo, get away from the damn code exchanges.

1569
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:56,000
I mean, that's, I don't know.

1570
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:00,000
It's just like, yeah, we don't want to program our friend and you guys just do it.

1571
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
OK, you do it.

1572
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:06,000
It's such a lazy approach to it.

1573
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,000
All right.

1574
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Well, let's let's move on, shall we?

1575
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
And talk about Dark Soccer.

1576
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
You have kind of an irritating.

1577
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Yeah, it's a it's a it's a little bit of a world politics type of thing.

1578
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:21,000
But it also shows that gaming can be a propaganda device, right?

1579
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Well, oftentimes in some places gaming is a propaganda, especially in China.

1580
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:36,000
And this game is translated to everyone hit the traitors where players can assault the pro democracy protesters in Hong Kong.

1581
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:40,000
With weapons like bats and shoes just by tapping on them.

1582
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:45,000
And again, this this is absolutely propaganda.

1583
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:47,000
The game open and it's a free game, by the way.

1584
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:54,000
But it opens up saying Hong Kong is a part of China and this can't be meddled with by outside powers.

1585
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:59,000
And so basically it's just it's very anti-Western.

1586
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:09,000
It's very anti-Western, it's very, you know, anti-capitalist, even though this capitalism is freaking everywhere.

1587
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:17,000
But it specifically, though, is meant to hurt the efforts of the protesters in Hong Kong.

1588
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
And I think it's absolutely disgusting.

1589
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:34,000
It was submitted to Steam for approval, but they are apparently not to be are still waiting for release because of, quote, controversial and potentially illegal content.

1590
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:44,000
And then also DC Comics related to this pulled a Batman poster after Chinese supporters said it supported anti-government protests.

1591
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:49,000
So just this this whole thing that they're doing is absolutely disgusting.

1592
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:54,000
And too many people are bowing to it when.

1593
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,000
I don't know.

1594
01:38:55,000 --> 01:39:01,000
Well, this straight up propaganda game coming to steam as they're trying to come to steam is very fascinating.

1595
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
And, you know, just goes to show being to me it.

1596
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Well, it goes to show and, you know, something to consider is that, you know, if video games are art, art typically has a message.

1597
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,000
And sometimes that message can be a good thing.

1598
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:14,000
That can be a great thing.

1599
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
That message can tell a story.

1600
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,000
That message can make you feel things.

1601
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:19,000
That message can be something like gone home.

1602
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:22,000
That message can be something like that dragon cancer.

1603
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:25,000
That message can be, you know, really powerful.

1604
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:32,000
But sometimes that message can be used for not so great things like straight up political propaganda, which is what this is.

1605
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:39,000
So I think it's an interesting sign of our times and that video games is very much a part of that.

1606
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:46,000
I mean, in the 1920s, this would have been a poster that used some type of pop culture thing with a very political message.

1607
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Or a little ad in Harper's.

1608
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Now in the year 20, almost 2020, now in the new 20s.

1609
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:57,000
How are we going to distinguish, I guess, the 1920s versus 2020s?

1610
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
Now in the new 20s, it's video games.

1611
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:02,000
The more things change, the more they stay the same.

1612
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Azet in chat says these companies hitch their horse to China and now they're cow-towing to them because they hold the chips.

1613
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:19,000
Yeah, I mean, that's a lot of where the frustrations with Blizzard came from a couple months ago, talking about that.

1614
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:26,000
So tricky subject, but I think an important one because, you know, I think you need to be aware.

1615
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:30,000
And, you know, this one is a very obvious piece of propaganda.

1616
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:33,000
What about those things that are less obvious?

1617
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:36,000
So, something to think about. Anyway.

1618
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:41,000
Moving on, let's talk about the things that will obviously be concluding soon.

1619
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Which is good because this is my least favorite part of the Bethesda E3 press events was the discussion of Elder Scrolls Legends.

1620
01:40:52,000 --> 01:41:02,000
It was their card game that they had worked on and now they've announced that they have ceased working on any big updates or future expansions.

1621
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:08,000
We've decided to put any new content development or releases on hold for the foreseeable future.

1622
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
We've heard that song and dance before.

1623
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:20,000
New expansions and other future content, however, are no longer under active development, they had said as well.

1624
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:27,000
And, yeah, so it looks like that they've just kind of let it die a slow death, apparently.

1625
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Just gonna leave it in the land of the unsupported.

1626
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:33,000
So, well, bummer for people that were into that game, I guess.

1627
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:43,000
So, but maybe it could also be one of those things where now this is more resources that go towards Elder Scrolls VI or something else on Bethesda's end of things.

1628
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
So, all right.

1629
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Yeah.

1630
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Well, let's move on.

1631
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Another game that is a card game of sorts.

1632
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
Let's talk about Gwent.

1633
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:56,000
So, Gwent is part of the Witcher franchise.

1634
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Gwent was a side game you could play in The Witcher 3, which I played not that long ago and actually played my first game of Gwent.

1635
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:07,000
I didn't know what the hell I was doing, but I played it and I won somehow, probably because it was easy.

1636
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:11,000
But Gwent ended up being a whole side game that ended up coming out.

1637
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:15,000
So, Gwent came out on PC and it came out on iOS.

1638
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:19,000
It also came out on various consoles like PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1639
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:22,000
However, they made a decision this week.

1640
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:27,000
The folks behind CD Projekt RED, behind Gwent and The Witcher and all that said this week,

1641
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:32,000
we have made a tough decision to discontinue support of console versions of the game.

1642
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:37,000
So, you can no longer spend money for cards on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One.

1643
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:42,000
And on December 9th, the console versions of the game will no longer support matchmaking.

1644
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:45,000
Ouch, if you bought cards in the past, I suppose.

1645
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:51,000
But it seems like folks are kind of playing this more on PC and iOS anyway.

1646
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:56,000
So, this may be more of a sign of it's too thin across all these platforms.

1647
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:59,000
So, we're going to sunset these consoles where it's not used as well.

1648
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:04,000
So, also it should be pointed out, between December 9th and June 9th,

1649
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:10,000
you can copy your progress from the console version of the game to a new GOG account.

1650
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:14,000
So, you're not completely screwed and that's kind of the way that they're trying to ease this a little bit,

1651
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
is that, hey, we're not just deleting your cards.

1652
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:19,000
We're going to ease you over to the PC version of the game where there's more people.

1653
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:24,000
So, you connect your console to GOG and then, because that's CD Projekt RED's thing,

1654
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:30,000
and then everything with cards, deck list, account level, all that stuff will go over to the GOG system.

1655
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,000
Well, that's good at least.

1656
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:34,000
Except weird things, meteorite powder.

1657
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
If you're PlayStation 4, you lose it.

1658
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
It's so weird, but whatever.

1659
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
I'm saying it's not possible.

1660
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
It's very strange.

1661
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
Anyway, yeah.

1662
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:48,000
But what's also weird to me, why couldn't this have just been cross-platform in the first place?

1663
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:53,000
I understand this came out in an era when it wasn't possible on Sony because they were kind of a holdout.

1664
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Maybe it's just the way they developed it. Who knows?

1665
01:43:55,000 --> 01:44:00,000
But why wouldn't that have been the solution to just tie them into the same matchmaking system?

1666
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:03,000
It's kind of weird that they didn't do that as a response.

1667
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
And we get this instead.

1668
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
But whatever, I guess.

1669
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
All right.

1670
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:12,000
And QuestPuster says, yeah, Gwent, they killed the console version.

1671
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Yep, some hard times.

1672
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:19,000
But that was cool of them to do, that they did copy things over so that way you're not totally screwed

1673
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:22,000
if you are willing to switch to GOG.

1674
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:23,000
All right.

1675
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Let's go back to a simpler time, shall we?

1676
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:30,000
We're going to go back to a time actually not as long ago as some prior selections

1677
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:34,000
because the rule here for the Classic Game of the Week, where once a week

1678
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Dark Sakura steps into the gaming vault and finds a game that she thinks,

1679
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:43,000
hey, you kids should check out this game, or hey, this game has historical significance,

1680
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:48,000
or I think maybe the case of tonight's pick, hey, can you believe this game qualifies now

1681
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
because it's ten years old?

1682
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:54,000
So Dark Sakura, what did you pick for the Classic Game of the Week?

1683
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,000
All right.

1684
01:44:55,000 --> 01:45:03,000
And I dropped hints on the Twitters because of tweeting, but I picked Angry Birds.

1685
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Angry Birds is a ten-year-old game as of the 11th.

1686
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
And...

1687
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:13,000
Now you get to hear the noises in the background of the birds going...

1688
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:19,000
It is also the first, I think, iOS game, first released as a mobile game

1689
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
that I have done for Classic Games.

1690
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:28,000
So we're getting into the territory of mobile gaming as a viable...

1691
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:31,000
And to be fair, the video we're seeing is not from a mobile version.

1692
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
I believe it's one of the console versions.

1693
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:34,000
It is.

1694
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:35,000
They ported this to everything.

1695
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:38,000
I actually switched yours out, Dark Sakura, because I don't know if you knew,

1696
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
but the one you picked was all in Russian text.

1697
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:43,000
Yeah, well, I don't see why that mattered.

1698
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:44,000
The game's the same.

1699
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:47,000
I picked one in the localized, so whatever.

1700
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
It's the same thing.

1701
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:54,000
Well, at any rate, Angry Birds did come out in December 2009,

1702
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:57,000
and it was first released on iOS and...

1703
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
I'm going to mispronounce this.

1704
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Is it Mayemo? M-A-E-M-O.

1705
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Devices.

1706
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Since then, 12 million copies of the games have been acquired from the iOS app store.

1707
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:17,000
So because of that popularity, later versions did get released.

1708
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:22,000
For Android, Symbian, Windows Phone, and BlackBerry 10 devices.

1709
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
And, of course, the Spa Home versions,

1710
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:29,000
and a sequel that came out in 2015 for iOS and Android.

1711
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:34,000
So the game is really simple, and it can be really addictive.

1712
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:38,000
I mean, for the record, it was developed by Rovio Entertainment.

1713
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:41,000
But anyway, you slingshot birds,

1714
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:44,000
and some different birds have different abilities, as we can see.

1715
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:48,000
And your goal is to destroy some pigs.

1716
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:52,000
Very, very militant-looking hogs.

1717
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:57,000
And they will be on stands or in special rooms or different things.

1718
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:01,000
And your goal is to efficiently use your birds as ammunition

1719
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:05,000
to destroy these pigs and the platforms that they're on,

1720
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:08,000
and you can make the platforms topple all the pigs and whatnot.

1721
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:11,000
Can I just say, in many ways, this game's engine kind of,

1722
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
or I'm sorry, not the engine, but the design,

1723
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:16,000
reminds me of the old Tank Wars type of games,

1724
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
which then, you know, things like worms,

1725
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
because essentially, what are you doing with the birds?

1726
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
You're picking your angle, and you're picking your power.

1727
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
That was the main mechanic behind the tank games.

1728
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Have we done Scorched Earth as a classic game of the week?

1729
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:29,000
You'll have to take it up with the Office of Classic Gaming.

1730
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
But anyway, let's let her finish this week.

1731
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:32,000
We'll talk.

1732
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
I'll let you do a classic game.

1733
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
Next time she's gone, we'll do that one.

1734
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
I can do one while I'm here. It's cool.

1735
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:41,000
But remember, pinball next month, or next year.

1736
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:42,000
Well, both.

1737
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Not every week, but yeah.

1738
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Yeah.

1739
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:47,000
But at any rate, since it became so popular,

1740
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:53,000
I mean, the entire franchise has had over 2 billion downloads

1741
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:56,000
across all platforms as of January 2014.

1742
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
That's including special editions.

1743
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:02,000
And it was actually officially labeled after it's released

1744
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:05,000
one of the most mainstream games out in 2010

1745
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
and a runaway hit for 2010.

1746
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:12,000
And the largest mobile app success the world has ever seen as of 2011.

1747
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
Those are all quotes.

1748
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:18,000
But at any rate, it really is just slingshot, kill pigs,

1749
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:22,000
eat bacon and chicken, maybe?

1750
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:23,000
Ooh.

1751
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
What if they had called this game bacon rat chicken?

1752
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
That would have been pretty badass.

1753
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Maybe I would have played it more.

1754
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
But you've got different kinds of birds

1755
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:35,000
as distinguished by their shape and their color.

1756
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:39,000
You get the basic red bird, just called red.

1757
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:42,000
And then you have birds that are effective against different materials

1758
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
or have different abilities.

1759
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:48,000
So a yellow bird named Chuck will speed up as it goes.

1760
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:52,000
A blue bird will fragment into three birds, and they're just called the blues.

1761
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
A black bird called Bomb explodes.

1762
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:59,000
The white bird called Matilda can drop egg projectiles.

1763
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:03,000
There's a pink one called Stella that can trap objects and bubbles.

1764
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:06,000
A green bird named Hal that boomerangs back.

1765
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:11,000
And a giant red bird named Terence, who looks like the original red bird but is bigger,

1766
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:14,000
who does more damage to structures than the smaller ones.

1767
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:18,000
And an orange bird called Bubbles that expands and inflates.

1768
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
And then you've got the different pigs.

1769
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
You have small pigs who are weaker.

1770
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:26,000
You have large pigs that are able to withstand more damage.

1771
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:29,000
And then you have pigs that wear armor, like the military hats I was talking about,

1772
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:32,000
that are more impervious.

1773
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:35,000
And of course you've got, you know, all the levels are predetermined.

1774
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
They're all set up a certain way.

1775
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:45,000
And basically your goal is to eliminate all of the pigs before the last bird is launched.

1776
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:50,000
And then after that you complete the level, and the next level is unlocked.

1777
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:53,000
But if you run out of birds first and the pigs aren't defeated,

1778
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:58,000
the level is considered incomplete and must be repeated.

1779
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:02,000
And then you get your points based on the damage or destruction,

1780
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:06,000
and bonus points for having unused birds.

1781
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:10,000
Your survivors give you points. Don't murder all the birds.

1782
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:16,000
And then you can go back and repeat levels that weren't done up to three stars,

1783
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:21,000
but you can get star ranking on each level to do better and improve your score.

1784
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:32,000
And so the game, like I said, it was originally released on iOS

1785
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:35,000
and had just a single episode called Poached Eggs.

1786
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:40,000
And you had three themed chapters with 21 levels each.

1787
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:43,000
And then you got three upgrades as it went along.

1788
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:47,000
And I just remember how the logo has changed over the years.

1789
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:53,000
That first logo was really dark and sketchy and it got a little bit different.

1790
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:59,000
But the first update came out on February 11th, 2010 as an episode called Mighty Hoax.

1791
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
It had two more chapters added.

1792
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:05,000
And after that we even got Golden Eggs and Danger Above and blah blah blah blah blah.

1793
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:08,000
But we're talking about the original.

1794
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:11,000
But then after that you did get different themes.

1795
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:17,000
The first themed one was Hamem High, as in Hangem High.

1796
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:23,000
But it was an Old West themed and then you got new birds after that like the Mighty Eagle.

1797
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:34,000
But the game really did launch a bajillion, just a franchise that has spawned so many other things.

1798
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:39,000
Because you can find Angry Birds shirts and I still see them on sale.

1799
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
Yeah, the movies. Two of them.

1800
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:50,000
The other releases that came out were the Nokia N900 multimedia internet phone.

1801
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:53,000
iPhone, like I said, iPod Touch.

1802
01:51:53,000 --> 01:52:01,000
Rovio then did an exclusive iPad version called Angry Birds HD that came out in 2010.

1803
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:07,000
Then after that came out for the Palm Pre, it came out for Palm's WebOS.

1804
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:15,000
Symbian 3 phones got a copy that included Poached Eggs and Mighty Hoax.

1805
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:20,000
And then it later on started working on Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HD.

1806
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:23,000
And then of course it came on for multiples.

1807
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:29,000
Even our console versions, we got Angry Birds for PSP, for PlayStation Portable.

1808
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:32,000
It was sort of like a mini game type.

1809
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:36,000
It brought out Windows versions and then we got them for Mac on the App Store.

1810
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:43,000
And then for Nintendo DS, there was...

1811
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:48,000
I'm sorry, for Wii I'm talking about came Angry Birds Trilogy and then there was the Nintendo DS version.

1812
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:55,000
And an enhanced version was proposed for the LG Optimus 3D, but I don't know if that actually got released.

1813
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:59,000
There are browser versions of this that run in WebGL or Canvas.

1814
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:02,000
You can get them through the Chrome Web Store.

1815
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
You have all other kinds of...

1816
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
I mean, there's just so many that came out.

1817
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:11,000
But like I said, you get it on many other things too.

1818
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:15,000
You've got, like we're saying, movies.

1819
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:20,000
We have clothing. We have school supplies.

1820
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
Lego sets.

1821
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Lego sets, which would be a mess.

1822
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:27,000
It's a brand. It's a character. It's everywhere.

1823
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:36,000
That's right. And now, even when you're talking about physics-based games like this, people will say, what, like Angry Birds?

1824
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:42,000
But I really consider this one to be notable for what it is.

1825
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
Well, I think what's also interesting...

1826
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:48,000
No, I know I was giving you a little shit when you picked this game on Twitter.

1827
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:51,000
Because I do think, and I think this is worth talking about as well,

1828
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:56,000
there was something about this game and the popularity of this game because it was so...

1829
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:01,000
Like, it kind of defined cell phone gaming for a little while.

1830
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:04,000
In an era probably pre-Pokemon Go.

1831
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:07,000
You know, this game kind of defined what a cell phone game was.

1832
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:11,000
And I think for a lot of people, it was like, oh, it's a casual game.

1833
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:16,000
Yeah, it was like one of the first games that my kids would play on tablets.

1834
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:20,000
Like, they would, you know, you'd see a tablet and it's like, oh, you got to put Angry Birds on there.

1835
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Because that's what all the kids are playing is Angry Birds or Fruit Ninja.

1836
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:28,000
Well, and I love physics-based games, so this one really just appealed to me.

1837
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:34,000
I thought, and people will call this stuff like casual games, but there is strategy involved in it.

1838
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:37,000
You have to have an understanding of physics. You have to understand the game physics.

1839
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:40,000
I never saw this as really being super casual.

1840
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:44,000
Maybe casual in the fact that you could play a few levels and put it away.

1841
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:48,000
But I could fucking do that on my Sega Saturn with Bust-A-Move. I could save my game.

1842
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:52,000
I think for this, you know, and certainly anything negative I've ever said about Angry Birds

1843
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:57,000
is not from a place of accessibility or getting games in the hands of more people.

1844
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
I'm all for more people playing games.

1845
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:02,000
But I think always my kind of mindset was, you know,

1846
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:05,000
but if you're going to make a cell phone game popular, why this one?

1847
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:09,000
But, you know, look, I understand.

1848
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:13,000
I'm thankful that, you know, this has gotten more people into gaming.

1849
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:19,000
And, you know, has helped this format, the phones, as much as, you know,

1850
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:23,000
sometimes we make fun of phone games because they don't have tangible controllers.

1851
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:24,000
This is a little different.

1852
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:30,000
I'm thankful that this has brought more people into video gaming and, you know, and all that good stuff.

1853
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:37,000
Well, yeah, this is the thing, too, is that I knew people who didn't consider themselves gamers until Angry Birds.

1854
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:41,000
And these are not people who own consoles, you know.

1855
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:46,000
I knew people who were just like, oh, I don't like any video games for X, Y, and Z reason,

1856
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:52,000
but they'll be that one game that comes out that's suddenly like, holy crap, I like video games.

1857
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:55,000
And it could be something as simple as this.

1858
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:58,000
We shouldn't discount people who enjoy their, quote, casual games

1859
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:05,000
because it could be the healthy, safe introduction to gaming that people need.

1860
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:08,000
And, honestly, I think this game is pretty fucking funny.

1861
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:09,000
All right.

1862
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Classic game of the week, Angry Birds.

1863
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
Yes, it's ten years old.

1864
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:20,000
And it, again, is notable as being the first mobile game only.

1865
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:23,000
It started as a mobile game that I have brought out.

1866
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
Is it really?

1867
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
I really think that it is.

1868
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:33,000
And it specifically was iOS and Nokia.

1869
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:34,000
Interesting.

1870
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:38,000
Akuma JP says, while the geeks in Japan are playing an addicted to puzzle dragon here,

1871
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:42,000
I think that series, puzzle, and dragons, they've tried to do here,

1872
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:45,000
but it hasn't really quite had that same level of success

1873
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:48,000
because there was the Mario and Luigi one that they put out.

1874
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
Speaking of puzzle games, you know what game?

1875
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:53,000
I would love to have a release on, like, iPhones or something.

1876
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:57,000
And one of my favorite SNES games is Puzzle and Dust.

1877
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:02,000
I think that would be a really good thing to bring out for iOS.

1878
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:06,000
I mean, I don't know if you played it that much, but I was super addicted to it

1879
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:09,000
back when my only access to it was as a ROM.

1880
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
I'm ready for Pokemon Puzzle League to make a comeback.

1881
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:14,000
Have I done Puzzle and Dust as a classic?

1882
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:15,000
I might have.

1883
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:16,000
Maybe.

1884
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:17,000
I'm pretty sure I did.

1885
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:18,000
I'm ready for Pokemon Puzzle League to make a comeback.

1886
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:19,000
Or whatever you want to call it.

1887
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
Is it Tetris Attack or Panel de Pone?

1888
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:22,000
Whatever.

1889
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
I'm ready for that series to come back.

1890
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:25,000
Playing a Puzzle League.

1891
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:28,000
Yeah, I was playing a Puzzle League on the DS or 3DS.

1892
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:29,000
DS.

1893
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Yes, because I remember when Shane, he downloaded that member

1894
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
because they have that share thing.

1895
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:41,000
The share demo thing that you could cash it to your DS or whatever.

1896
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:44,000
And so he played that the entire E3 that we were there

1897
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:47,000
because he wouldn't reset or turn off his.

1898
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:48,000
Was it that?

1899
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:51,000
Or I remember that, but it was Meteos.

1900
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Oh, Meteos something.

1901
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:56,000
The year that that, because that was me and some people I knew at the time.

1902
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
Because you could download demos to your DS, right?

1903
01:57:58,000 --> 01:57:59,000
Yes.

1904
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:00,000
And so they had E3.

1905
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
So we downloaded the Meteos demo and we played it all night.

1906
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:05,000
We tried to keep it on our DS like as long as we possibly could

1907
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:09,000
before inevitably like it shut off because of a dead battery or something.

1908
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:14,000
Rob, so Puzzle and Desk, I did for episode 293.

1909
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:15,000
Oh, wow.

1910
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:16,000
So that was a while.

1911
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:17,000
It's been a little while.

1912
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Good game.

1913
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:19,000
Good game.

1914
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:20,000
Over 500 episodes ago.

1915
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:21,000
Kind of hard.

1916
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
But I mean, I'm going to.

1917
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
Is Nichibutsu still around?

1918
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:28,000
Because maybe I should poke whoever owns the license for it.

1919
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:29,000
All right.

1920
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:33,000
Let's travel around the game world real quick and take a look at some rapid fire news.

1921
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:37,000
So a quick look at some other things that are happening in the gaming world.

1922
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:38,000
Loki, we'll start with you.

1923
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
So they just released a trailer.

1924
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:45,000
20th Century Fox released a trailer for a movie called Free Guy, which looks fantastic.

1925
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:49,000
It's basically Grand Theft Auto Online, the movie.

1926
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:57,000
But it's the premise is that Ryan Reynolds character is a like an NPC in this game.

1927
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:02,000
He doesn't realize he's an NPC and then all of a sudden finds out he's inside of a game.

1928
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:05,000
And he decides that he doesn't want to be an NPC anymore.

1929
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:09,000
This sounds so ridiculous and exactly like the type of thing we would expect Ryan Reynolds to do.

1930
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:10,000
It's fantastic.

1931
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:11,000
It looks hilarious.

1932
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:12,000
Yeah.

1933
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:13,000
And I can't wait to see it.

1934
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:14,000
So that's coming out in July.

1935
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:18,000
So check out the trailer if you haven't seen that yet, because it looks very sweet.

1936
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
A lot of good trailers, actually.

1937
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
Monday, we're going to be getting a brand new.

1938
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:25,000
The new Ghostbusters movies going to be having a trailer for that.

1939
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:26,000
Yeah.

1940
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:27,000
We got Wonder Woman 84.

1941
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:28,000
Wonder Woman 84 was today.

1942
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:29,000
Yeah.

1943
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:30,000
Yeah.

1944
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:31,000
So lots of good stuff.

1945
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:35,000
You also get Golden Globe nominees tomorrow if you're into that award watching sort of thing.

1946
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:36,000
Yes.

1947
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:39,000
So I've got some news about Space Channel 5.

1948
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:43,000
And no, it's not that I saw a cosplayer today dressed up like Ooh La La.

1949
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:47,000
It is unfortunate that Space Channel 5 VR has been delayed again.

1950
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:50,000
Now it will be coming out in spring 2020.

1951
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:55,000
So if you had your hopes to play Space Channel 5 VR before the end of the year, sorry.

1952
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:56,000
Not going to happen.

1953
01:59:56,000 --> 02:00:00,000
Well, again, game delays should be celebrated in some ways.

1954
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
So as long as it's going to make it better.

1955
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:03,000
Yeah.

1956
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
Put more chew in there.

1957
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:06,000
All right.

1958
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:10,000
Moving on to something that was spotted in Microsoft Store.

1959
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:11,000
This could be very interesting.

1960
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:16,000
Some remasters in 4K of Vanquish and Bayonetta.

1961
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:19,000
Vanquish was spotted first in the Microsoft Store.

1962
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:23,000
It's going to have 4K visuals running in 60 frames a second on Xbox One X.

1963
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:26,000
The launch date is supposed to be February 18th.

1964
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:32,000
And then Bayonetta was spotted not much longer after that also on the Microsoft Store.

1965
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:37,000
Potentially Game Award announcements that got leaked a little early.

1966
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:40,000
I don't know if that would be that big.

1967
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
Something to keep in mind.

1968
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:46,000
We haven't had an update on Bayonetta 3 in quite some time.

1969
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
We know that's something they're doing for the Switch.

1970
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
We just kind of don't know the status.

1971
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:58,000
It would seem logical that we bring Bayonetta back into consciousness with some type of remaster or rebranding of the first two games.

1972
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:01,000
We did have the original Bayonetta on PC.

1973
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
And I know that updressed the original.

1974
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:04,000
Same with Vanquish.

1975
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:05,000
Yeah.

1976
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
So I don't know if maybe these are just the PC versions or whatever.

1977
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:10,000
But I also don't think they went all the way up to 4K.

1978
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:16,000
And maybe they actually went in and really did some different stuff with the assets and stuff.

1979
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
And maybe are really making it look nice.

1980
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:22,000
Until we see the actual details and not just a leak through the store.

1981
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
But that does appear to be something that's coming.

1982
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
So that is pretty cool.

1983
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:32,000
And then I was going to look at this other story on more arcade archive releases coming.

1984
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
But the damn website won't load for me over here.

1985
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
So I don't know if you can help me out, Loki.

1986
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:41,000
But I know that the Arcade Archives, which is basically a legit meme on your Nintendo Switch.

1987
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:45,000
They have a whole series of games that are going to be coming out.

1988
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Some of them were announced before, but some were not.

1989
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:52,000
Yeah. So they had a stream, I guess, that was on NicoNico.

1990
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:56,000
That Hamster announced some more games that are coming to Arcade Archive.

1991
02:01:56,000 --> 02:02:01,000
These include Kiki, KaiKai, Tenstar.

1992
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Kiki and Rocky.

1993
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
And MapMania.

1994
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:08,000
Yeah, Kiki and KaiKai is not a Drag Race game, just to be clear.

1995
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:09,000
No.

1996
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
You know what's funny?

1997
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:14,000
I remember when I bought this nest at the thrift store for 50 bucks.

1998
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
Pocky and Rocky 2 was in it.

1999
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:17,000
Oh, how funny.

2000
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:18,000
A game that goes for 150 bucks.

2001
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:23,000
So now the full lineup now that they have those plus the other titles that they had before it.

2002
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:32,000
So Suzuki versus Commander, Gorilla War, Akari 3, The Rescue, P.O.W. Prisoners of War, Frogger,

2003
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:40,000
Daytona, Twinbee versus Balloon Fight, Kiki KaiKai, Tenstar, MapMania, and Tecmo Bowl.

2004
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:43,000
Sorry, I just giggled at the name Kiki KaiKai.

2005
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:46,000
Anyway, that's cool.

2006
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:49,000
Yeah, the Arcade Archive is very interesting.

2007
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:52,000
I kind of think it's like they want seven bucks a game for those games.

2008
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
I'm not sure they're all worth that.

2009
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:59,000
But as they're starting to get more and more like modern releases mixed in there too, I think it's pretty cool.

2010
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:04,000
We should see some, let's start making some actual cabinets for them.

2011
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
I mean, that's the trend nowadays.

2012
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:12,000
Actually, my kids played on the Pac-Man Cocktail Cab, the arcade one up one.

2013
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:15,000
They had $450 for that thing.

2014
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:19,000
I'm like, I'm all due, but the full size ones are like $150.

2015
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
Why would I pay that?

2016
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:25,000
That seems kind of a rip off at Sam's Club too, which is ridiculous.

2017
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:26,000
Interesting.

2018
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:33,000
But I would have thought that would have been much cheaper because it's basically the same thing running in there.

2019
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
There's no additional hardware.

2020
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:41,000
Anyway, I guess another set of controls, but really it's not that much more expensive.

2021
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Boy, it's so funny how this whole replica arcade thing is getting bigger and bigger.

2022
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
I mean, certainly with the arcade one ups, right?

2023
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:50,000
Tons of people got those Star Wars ones and so forth.

2024
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
It seems like they're just making more and more.

2025
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:56,000
If I had the space, I would have a whole arcade of those things.

2026
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:59,000
Well, and the money, because let's be real, those things are kind of expensive.

2027
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
They've dropped them after Black Friday.

2028
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:10,000
Some of them are down to, I think, I want to say that the Mortal Kombat one's down to $179 or $199.

2029
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
It's permanently dropped price now.

2030
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:13,000
Oh, wow.

2031
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:14,000
That's cool.

2032
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:15,000
Yeah, they've come down.

2033
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:16,000
That's great.

2034
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:17,000
All right.

2035
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:18,000
Fun, fun.

2036
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:19,000
All right.

2037
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:22,000
Well, let's move on and talk about, thank you for pinch hitting on that story.

2038
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
Dark Soccer, you have a couple of rapid fire stories for us, right?

2039
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
I do indeed.

2040
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:38,000
One that makes me super happy is that the creator of Danganronpa, Kodaka Kazutaka, said that there's a new title.

2041
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:42,000
Well, announcing a new title on the, I can't make my words happen.

2042
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:43,000
Why am I so tongue tied?

2043
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:48,000
Announced a title on December 9th, a teasing for it.

2044
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
And this is the direct quote.

2045
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
Maybe it's because it was a bad year.

2046
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:57,000
I'm feeling down quite a lot this year, but I'll still be able to make this announcement at the end of it.

2047
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:58,000
So it's going to be the greatest year.

2048
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
He said this on Twitter.

2049
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:10,000
So basically there's going to be a title that's going to be announced, although already announced for 2020 is Death March Club.

2050
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:14,000
But he's also working on a number of other unannounced projects.

2051
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:18,000
One that is a limit cross despair game.

2052
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:36,000
I'm also working with Uchikoshi Kotaro and an anime collaboration with Studio Pero and a very dark fantasy-esque mystery quote game in collaboration with Spike Chunsoft.

2053
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:46,000
And then there was another update on this that Izanagi Games actually retweeted Kodaka's tweet.

2054
02:05:46,000 --> 02:06:04,000
And Izanagi Games is the publisher for Death March Club, but they've also registered a trademark for Death Come True, a Japanese trademark on November 15th, and the domain name DeathComeTrue.com on November 18th.

2055
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:07,000
So keep your eyes open on those.

2056
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:16,000
I would like a Danganronpa that's more of an extension of the original Danganronpa and not this V3, because V3 I prefer.

2057
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:20,000
I just like all my original Danganronpa characters.

2058
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:24,000
But V3 wasn't bad, don't get me wrong, I just couldn't get into the universe of it.

2059
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:33,000
And in other news, there's Untitled Goose Game merchandise coming out in the form of socks.

2060
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:36,000
But I'm not looking at it as socks, I'm looking at it as a sock puppet.

2061
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:40,000
Because it totally is a goose with a beak, and you can go...

2062
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:50,000
You can do that. Basically, my hand goose just bit your head off. Sorry, Loki, you can have it back.

2063
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:55,000
That's okay, he has his statue goose to protect him there.

2064
02:06:55,000 --> 02:07:02,000
I would have printed my own, but my printer doesn't work, and then I would need also several different colors of filament to do that.

2065
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:05,000
That's the next game of with all the merchandise.

2066
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
Or just really good paint.

2067
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:15,000
True. And I like, see now, the way they printed this too, it's kind of funny, because you would look at it and you'd think, okay, vertically, but they actually printed it like this.

2068
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:20,000
But because of that, the butt feather, or it makes it look like the butt feathers would be actually how it would be.

2069
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:25,000
It's kind of just, it's not on purpose, but it's pretty cool.

2070
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
Interesting. Alright.

2071
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:31,000
Well, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some video games coming out very soon.

2072
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:35,000
Although I imagine this time of year is slowing down a little bit, but we'll check in anyway.

2073
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
Yeah, but there's still some things coming out.

2074
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:42,000
So, like, really this week, it's kind of limited to just a few games.

2075
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:46,000
So we've got Dragon Quest Builders 2, that's on PC.

2076
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:49,000
MechWarrior 5 Mercenaries, also PC.

2077
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:56,000
Vampire the Masquerade, looks like they've got an expansion there that's coming out on PC, Mac, and Linux.

2078
02:07:56,000 --> 02:08:07,000
And we also have this week, Detroit Become Human on PC, and Project Sakura Wars on PS4.

2079
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:10,000
Yeah, I know, Dr. Sakura's been waiting for that Detroit.

2080
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
You have it pre-purchased, right?

2081
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:15,000
No, I don't yet, just because I didn't want to spend the money yet.

2082
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:16,000
Fair.

2083
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:20,000
Well, maybe cross your fingers and toes, maybe there'll be a week one discount, who knows?

2084
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:21,000
Maybe.

2085
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:24,000
Alright, we'll go into Japan and their release dates over there.

2086
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:28,000
On the PlayStation 4, we saw some releases this week, things aren't slowing down over there.

2087
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:31,000
Project Sakura Wars is also in Japan this week.

2088
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:34,000
That is in a regular and limited edition, if you want those.

2089
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:38,000
There's also a game called BQM, which is short for Block Quest Maker,

2090
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:42,000
so if you want kind of your own quest-making game, that is available, as well as Hollow Knight.

2091
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:47,000
Their version of Control, so they get that, you know, one of our Game of the Year contenders,

2092
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:51,000
they're getting a localized version in Japan next week of Control on the PlayStation 4.

2093
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:54,000
Also, they're getting Ghostbusters, the video game remastered,

2094
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:57,000
so they took, it's been out here, the PlayStation 4 version of that,

2095
02:08:57,000 --> 02:09:02,000
but they took the older one from like 10 years ago and re-upped it for PlayStation 4,

2096
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:05,000
and that's getting its Japanese release this week.

2097
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:10,000
Mega Aquarium also coming out, and Headliner Novi News, that is all on PlayStation 4.

2098
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:15,000
Looking at the Switch, Samurai Spirits, which you might know as Samurai Showdown,

2099
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:19,000
getting its Switch release in Japan this week, so that is a big release there.

2100
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:26,000
You can also check out Deadly Premonition, I'm sorry, that is not a Japanese release.

2101
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:35,000
BQM Block Quest Maker is also out on the Switch, as well as Hollow Knight and Deadly Premonition Origins.

2102
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:39,000
No, that's only US, I don't know why that's mixed in here, but it is.

2103
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:45,000
So, I was trying to see if there's other Japanese, oh yeah, Mega Aquarium and Headliner Novi News also there in Japan this week.

2104
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:48,000
On the Switch, how about the UK Dark Soccer?

2105
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:54,000
Only a few things. On the 9th, we have Doom Slayer's Collection for PlayStation.

2106
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:58,000
Also only on PlayStation is Groundhog Day, like Father, like Son.

2107
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:04,000
On Switch, we have Shovel Knight Treasure Trove, and I'm going to mispronounce this,

2108
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:08,000
but it's a PlayStation game, Avicii and Vector.

2109
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:14,000
That is, I think, the music game with the artist who passed away.

2110
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:18,000
Okay, and then on the 12th, New Super Lucky's Tale.

2111
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:25,000
That's kind of cute. Yeah, everything else is the week after.

2112
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:31,000
Just a bunch of collections, it looks like. But anyway, that's it for this week.

2113
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:34,000
No mail tonight, well.

2114
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:37,000
I just went ahead and just said, I just refreshed it.

2115
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:43,000
Spoiler alert. All right. Well, every week we welcome your emails, and sometimes we have them and sometimes we don't.

2116
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:48,000
Participate at Orangelaungeradoo.com is the place to send those emails.

2117
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:53,000
I will kind of point out that something we're going to be retooling a little bit for 2020.

2118
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:57,000
I'm not going to get rid of the mailbag. I've been threatening to do it because it's so underutilized.

2119
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:03,000
We'll keep it. However, I am going to have us incorporate, and I'll talk a little bit about this later,

2120
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:08,000
because it's going to be a surprise to my co-hosts, but I will be incorporating Twitter once again into the rotation

2121
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:13,000
for those that want to send us tweets, because I think that is a quick way for a lot of you to give comments on the show,

2122
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:19,000
as well as ensuring that we're embracing vognetwork.com as a place to leave your comments on episodes.

2123
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:25,000
So we will be incorporating that kind of into a Katamari, if you will, of listener feedback.

2124
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:28,000
I prefer the word gestalt. Gestalt? You don't like Katamari?

2125
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:32,000
I like Katamari, but I've been watching a lot of Transformer stuff lately.

2126
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:39,000
However, until we remodel this segment in the coming weeks, you may remember that if you don't send emails,

2127
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:43,000
you do get penalized with talk about RuPaul's Drag Race.

2128
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:44,000
Yes!

2129
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:48,000
You get penalized, or I get penalized.

2130
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:51,000
Basically, we should just zoom the camera in on Loki while we talk.

2131
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:55,000
So anyway, I kind of do want a multi-camera setup, but anyway.

2132
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:59,000
Or you can just get a camera that you can actually adjust and then have presets set.

2133
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:02,000
I could do one of those, kind of like what Paladin Amber does on her stream,

2134
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:05,000
is that she just basically has multi-cameras.

2135
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:08,000
Well, she has multi-cameras, but there's also ways you can kind of zoom in on the same shot.

2136
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:12,000
Like, I could just make another scene with this, but it's just zoomed in on your face.

2137
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:17,000
We could totally do multi-cam in using Final Cut.

2138
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:20,000
Well, but you don't broadcast live with Final Cut. This would support it.

2139
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:23,000
But it would be for other things.

2140
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:24,000
Oh yeah, for other things.

2141
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:28,000
But anyway, so sadly Drag Race is off-season, so there's not a lot to say there either.

2142
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:29,000
However...

2143
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:30,000
I couldn't watch Drag Race UK.

2144
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:33,000
I was just wondering if you were... did you see Drag Race UK and the results?

2145
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:36,000
I did while I was at the bar at Depot.

2146
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:39,000
I watched a little bit of it. There's a lot of Queens on there.

2147
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
I just need to sit and binge the whole thing.

2148
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:44,000
I just thought that their prizes were completely underwhelming for what they were doing.

2149
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:45,000
Well, you know why that is, though.

2150
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:49,000
Because of the BBC. You can't have... because it's basically taxpayer-funded,

2151
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:52,000
you can't give away prizes on the BBC, basically.

2152
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:53,000
That's stupid.

2153
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:56,000
Yeah, it's a little different. The game show rules are different over there.

2154
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:59,000
So they're just basically playing for props.

2155
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
To become a Ru girl.

2156
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:05,000
They're playing for being on television, is what it is.

2157
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:15,000
Well, if it gives them... I just hope that doing this actually gives their careers a lot more than what they had before.

2158
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:21,000
I'm also bracing for 2020 and the inevitable Ru burnout, because they're already casting for Season 13.

2159
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
Season 12, we don't even know the premiere date for.

2160
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
We know there's an All-Stars Five in the can. We're just waiting for it.

2161
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
I need to know a couple of friends. Try it out.

2162
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:33,000
But then Drag Race Canada is coming up. Drag Race Australia is coming up.

2163
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:37,000
And then there's the German one with Heidi Klum is hosting it.

2164
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:41,000
You know, she got a lot of shit for... you're not a drag queen, you're a bio.

2165
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:46,000
But Heidi Klum is super... and there's a great... if you listen to Alaska and Willem's podcast,

2166
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:50,000
they kind of go off and defend Heidi Klum, as she should be defended.

2167
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:56,000
The show wouldn't happen if it wasn't for Heidi Klum, and she's a huge proponent of that performance.

2168
02:13:56,000 --> 02:14:00,000
Willem surprises me, though, with all those anti-trans things that Willem said.

2169
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:08,000
Where, uh, Kourtney Act, I have to say it the right way, came in and basically did a lot of damage control.

2170
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:19,000
And then to have someone who just seems like that polarized into the, I guess, a little bit more patriarchal side of drag and sexuality.

2171
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:23,000
To come out and support, basically, a bio queen.

2172
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:28,000
I mean, and I will use the term bio queen or fem queen, but I do not use the term faux queen.

2173
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:31,000
Because a queen is a queen. It's drag.

2174
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:37,000
But, you know, one thing I have to say that actually made me super happy, even though this is a little bit of old news,

2175
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:43,000
is that Dragula, this last season, made me super happy. Because we had a drag king who won.

2176
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:47,000
I think that's cool, but I don't like Dragula as a show. But I think that I'm happy for what it did.

2177
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
I've met the Boulet brothers a couple of times, but it was all at DragCon.

2178
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:50,000
That's cool.

2179
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,000
Actually, really nice people.

2180
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:53,000
They're bringing them here to Sacramento.

2181
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:56,000
Oh, cool. I'd love to see the Boulet brothers. I went to the ball. That was fun.

2182
02:14:56,000 --> 02:15:05,000
And they had a lady queen. Crap. It's also one that I really like, but my brain just completely farted on her name.

2183
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:10,000
But Land Insider, I've seen perform. I was high as a kite. It was DragCon.

2184
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:13,000
Okay, it was my first time ever having edibles.

2185
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:21,000
And it was also post gastric bypass, like six months after. So I eat this whole cookie that looks like a Samoa.

2186
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:24,000
That's why I bought them, because it looked like fucking delicious.

2187
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:28,000
And it was a delicious cookie. And it kicked in an hour later when we were at Hamburger Mary's in Los Angeles.

2188
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:32,000
And I was fucked. I couldn't move.

2189
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:38,000
You know, Landon's going to be here, or at least according to Landon's website, Landon's going to be here at one of the local bars in mid-December at some point.

2190
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:39,000
Really?

2191
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:41,000
Well, my king friends are thrilled.

2192
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:42,000
Or sidetracked.

2193
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
I think it might actually be Badlands.

2194
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:50,000
Badlands, really? Okay. Well, no, I would totally be down to see Landon, because I've seen him perform a couple of times.

2195
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:54,000
And just an absolutely astounding drag performer.

2196
02:15:54,000 --> 02:16:03,000
Alright, that's the end of the punishment. So, participate at orangelandrader.com is the place where you can send us emails for a future week.

2197
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:12,000
And, in all seriousness, we have to get that out of our system while we can, because there won't really be punishment anymore once we incorporate tweets and VoG network feedback into that.

2198
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:15,000
So, moving on.

2199
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:25,000
Alright, let's get into some more gaming news, and then we're going to take your calls, if there's any, via our Discord server, which you can join our Discord server at vognetwork.com.

2200
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:29,000
That's vognetwork.com slash Discord is the place to join our server.

2201
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:32,000
Let's move on with some more news. Loki.

2202
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:44,000
There is a rumor that Microsoft is going to release their next Xbox console with also a version of the console that will be diskless as well.

2203
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:52,000
Codename Lockhart would be kind of their diskless version of the next system they have.

2204
02:16:52,000 --> 02:17:01,000
I mean, yeah, I guess that makes sense. I mean, since they're already doing that with the Xbox One.

2205
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:07,000
This strikes me as a way, I mean, again, it's rumor, but it's one of those rumors that adds up.

2206
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:14,000
And, for me, I think it would be about them trying to get the lowest dollar amount possible when they announce this thing.

2207
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:23,000
Because they could come out, let's assume that the new Project Scarlett, whatever they end up calling it, let's assume it's a $599 console or something.

2208
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:26,000
You know, it's pretty pricey because of the technical oomph that they put in there.

2209
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:36,000
It may not be, I am completely theorizing, okay, just to make my point, but let's make believe that Project Scarlett is going to be a $599 console with all the bells and whistles.

2210
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:43,000
Well, if there's going to be a scaled-down version potentially with no disk drive parts or any of that stuff, maybe that will be the $499.

2211
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:49,000
And then that way they can say Project Scarlett or Xbox Two, whatever it's called, starting at $499.

2212
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:54,000
And that's how they're going to keep the message low to potentially try to low-cut whatever places.

2213
02:17:54,000 --> 02:18:01,000
But I'm kind of curious, though, if those price points are even a problem anymore, considering that we have people buying $1200 phones.

2214
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:09,000
Yes, they are. Look at what happened with PlayStation 3 and what happened with Xbox One.

2215
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:10,000
A while ago, though.

2216
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:24,000
Yeah, but it's also about responding to your competition. And so they have to have a way to potentially lowball, not just lowball PlayStation 5, but in case they have accidentally highballed PlayStation 5, they have to have a place where they can kind of compete with PlayStation 5.

2217
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:32,000
Because remember the last time we went through this whole thing was the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One reveals. Remember that PlayStation 4 reveal at E3?

2218
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:42,000
I mean, as we start in these next couple weeks to look back on the top gaming moments of the decade, that PlayStation 4 conference at E3 was one of the biggest gaming news moments of the decade.

2219
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:51,000
Because it wasn't just about what they were announcing, but fucking how they did it. Like, they came out and just, like, slapped Microsoft across the face with that message.

2220
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:59,000
I mean, remember that video with the whole, like, here's how you can let your friend play a PlayStation 4 game, you know, and just end the game.

2221
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:05,000
Like, that was some big dick energy in a way. That was BDE before its time.

2222
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,000
It was pretty great.

2223
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:15,000
We hadn't seen that kind of thing. So I think Microsoft maybe just, you know, again, I talk a lot about positioning the chess pieces, but that's really what it is.

2224
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:24,000
So I think when they're looking at a discless console, they could be positioning the chess pieces to possibly have to respond to, shit, we've priced our console more expensive than Sony's.

2225
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:28,000
We can't have that happen again. So we're gonna have a high ball and a low ball. That's my thought.

2226
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
Maybe, yeah. For what it is.

2227
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:39,000
Given that we just came off of the Ghostbusters chat, this is what went through my head the moment that was said. It's true. This console has no disc.

2228
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:48,000
So, you know, and as digital is becoming more and more the way, I don't think these consoles are bad. You know, if that's the way people want to save money, then cool.

2229
02:19:48,000 --> 02:20:00,000
I'll probably buy one that has a disc drive, but we'll see. I also understand the reality is, even though I can cling to my disc and everything, fucking the patches, your whole game redownloads anyway.

2230
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:10,000
Like I can go get my No Man's Sky PlayStation 4 disc. Do you think that's, do you think that's a, I mean, technically it is a game. It will run if I'm not connected to the internet, I can play that.

2231
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:13,000
No, I don't. Can I play it? Not on the internet?

2232
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:14,000
No.

2233
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:21,000
I think you can, but your information, no, you, cause I remember in the early days you were booted offline. So yes, you can play it, not on the internet. Your stuff just doesn't sink over.

2234
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:27,000
But my point is like, the game is completely different now, right? They've released how many patches for No Man's Sky.

2235
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:33,000
What's on that disc is not even the game at this point. So kind of interesting. I don't know.

2236
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:34,000
Alright.

2237
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:35,000
Shenanigans.

2238
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:45,000
Now, DJ Rama S Wonders with a discless system makes you wonder if you can connect an external Blu-ray drive and run the games. Maybe. I mean, we won't know. Tell anyone else.

2239
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:47,000
Kind of like having the SuperDrive with your Mac.

2240
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:53,000
Yeah, but it would have to be an Xbox branded drive. They're not going to just let you buy any old third party drive and run it that way to try to save money.

2241
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:57,000
They're not going to openly let you save money like that, but it would be interesting.

2242
02:20:57,000 --> 02:21:06,000
Alright, let's move on. Let's talk about something that may or may not be like a type of announcement for the game awards that got leaked early. We don't know.

2243
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:11,000
But what we do know is that some box art for Resident Evil 3 leaked out.

2244
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:18,000
So just like the Resident Evil 2 remake this past year, which was pretty darn well received. And I know Dark Soccer, you played through a bit.

2245
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:23,000
I mean, you and Dan played through a bit of it and you well received it for the most part, right?

2246
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:24,000
Yeah.

2247
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:29,000
Yeah. Enjoyed the remake. Are you excited to hear that Resident Evil 3 appears to be happening because of this confirmed box art?

2248
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:30,000
Yeah.

2249
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:31,000
Yeah.

2250
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:32,000
I knew it was going to be coming out.

2251
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:33,000
Yeah.

2252
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:44,000
Excuse me. Sorry. I didn't enjoy it as much as I liked Resident Evil 2, but I just hope that they don't make the...

2253
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:48,000
What was it? Mr. X or Tyrant, whichever one he was in that game?

2254
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
Nemesis is the big guy.

2255
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
Not as annoying.

2256
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:53,000
Yeah.

2257
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:55,000
I mean, he's probably going to be as annoying as Mr. X is.

2258
02:21:55,000 --> 02:22:03,000
Well, some people are responding to this kind of redone art saying, yuck or yikes, you know, like Nemesis does not look good in this.

2259
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:08,000
So, but it'll be interesting. I mean, if Resident Evil 3 does well, then I wonder if that means Resident Evil 4.

2260
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:15,000
That could be a pretty big deal if they go. I mean, this just seems like a necessary step to get to that Resident Evil 4 redo.

2261
02:22:15,000 --> 02:22:18,000
That would be really, really something. So we'll see.

2262
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:23,000
But it looks like this is happening. And I imagine we're probably going to get a trailer of some sort during the game awards.

2263
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:30,000
That just seems like what's going to happen. We'll see. Will it maybe support VR like the most recent Resident Evil game did?

2264
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:35,000
Don't know. I mean, we can make shit up all we want, but hopefully we'll get some kind of confirmation this week.

2265
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:40,000
And it seems like a likely game awards thing, but we'll find out soon.

2266
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:48,000
All right. Meanwhile, Dark Soccer, you have an interesting... This game is like several years old, but yet is being covered in the news this week.

2267
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:52,000
Yeah, it is. And I think it's because it's getting a new release.

2268
02:22:53,000 --> 02:23:00,000
And see, that's why I was looking at it. Like, wasn't the story, wasn't this game already out?

2269
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:08,000
But maybe it's getting some more attention just because of what's going on with, I guess, current events.

2270
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:11,000
I know I picked it for a reason.

2271
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:14,000
Can I quickly put an addendum on the last thing from a chat comment?

2272
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:15,000
Sure.

2273
02:23:15,000 --> 02:23:22,000
Shane is in chat. Chad Starzik, who says, Jeff Keeley, or whatever it's spelled, said Resident Evil 3 will not be at the game awards.

2274
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:28,000
It's more likely a state of play thing. I forgot. Yeah, PlayStation did announce they have a state of play this week.

2275
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:31,000
And it's very possible this was actually a part of that.

2276
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:39,000
So thank you for the update from apparently Jeff Keeley denying that Resident Evil 3 was planned for the game awards.

2277
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:40,000
Sorry, Dark Soccer.

2278
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
I honestly actually then don't know why I picked this one.

2279
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:47,000
I figured it was because of the mainstream coverage and how it tied into what they were talking about in the story. I thought it was a neat story.

2280
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:57,000
It is. It actually was posted by KTUU, an Anchorage, Alaska news station, NBC affiliate.

2281
02:23:57,000 --> 02:24:03,000
But the game never alone. It did get a release in November 2014 on the 18th.

2282
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:23,000
And it was a game that was actually done in coordination with a tribal council in Alaska with their elders and, you know, the various indigenous people there.

2283
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:27,000
And they did an interview with the creator.

2284
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:46,000
And since it came out, it was featured over in a thousand publications, downloaded 3.5 million players and selected for over 75 best of the year game awards with multiple winners, including BAFTA, the British Academy Award.

2285
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:53,000
And it's been on a number of multiple consoles and outlets.

2286
02:24:53,000 --> 02:25:18,000
But the big thing is that the game never alone seemed to really set a stage and a precedence for having more games like this that bring in ways of celebrating cultures that have been, you know, pretty much wiped out or I'd say highly damaged, if not completely wiped out by colonialization.

2287
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:32,000
And, you know, the creator was a native Alaskan, you know, someone who grew up with that culture and seeing the damage that was done by this.

2288
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:47,000
So they went in and we're just talking about how bringing this kind of universe to life and bringing that awareness to this aspect of culture has really set a stage for doing other kinds of games like this.

2289
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:53,000
And this is the joy, you know, there are people who are in that culture who have played the game and found just an absolute love for it.

2290
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:58,000
Yeah. You know, yeah. And I remember when this game first came out, certainly the cultural.

2291
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:04,000
And it's interesting because we talked earlier about art as a message and art can be a bad thing, but art can also be a great thing.

2292
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:12,000
And in this case, we've got a great thing because it was bringing some of those experiences and those stories to the video gaming format.

2293
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:15,000
And when the game first came out, I thought that was neat about it.

2294
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:21,000
But now with this KTU story and really showing like, no, no, we consulted with people.

2295
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:25,000
We got, you know, like we showed this to some of the elders. We got that.

2296
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:28,000
But I thought that really enhanced this.

2297
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:33,000
And this is now the other reason why I know I brought this up is because they're working on a sequel.

2298
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:37,000
So officially said they're working on the sequel for this game.

2299
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:41,000
OK. But it's one that I played it. It was a great game.

2300
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:49,000
And I'd say if nobody out there, you know, if you maybe haven't heard of it or haven't played it, first of all, I don't know what rock you were under.

2301
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:53,000
But second of all, you really should play it and check your PlayStation or Xbox library,

2302
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:57,000
because I believe it's been both on games with gold and place.

2303
02:26:57,000 --> 02:27:02,000
I know it's been on the PlayStation Plus. It may have been an epic game store thing.

2304
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:05,000
So I know there was a second platform it showed up on as well.

2305
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:08,000
I think I did that when I bought it. I got it on steam when it came out.

2306
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:19,000
Yeah. But it's absolutely gorgeous game. The other thing, too, is and it really got me to thinking that with this consulting of, you know, the people whose culture it reflects and affects.

2307
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:23,000
I was thinking back to what they did for Frozen 2, which I haven't seen yet.

2308
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:33,000
But they worked with the indigenous peoples of the Scandinavian areas to make sure that they portrayed the indigenous people there properly.

2309
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:40,000
And that we're really getting to see, you know, I would even say it's been just in the last decade we've started to see more respect for native cultures.

2310
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:48,000
I mean, that is I mean, we still had the bullshit with the with the Dakota pipeline that that's some garbage.

2311
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:51,000
And we've seen the fallout. They were right. Hello.

2312
02:27:51,000 --> 02:28:00,000
But but, you know, we've started to see more of an interest in hopefully a revitalization and preservation of these cultures.

2313
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:06,000
And if video games can do this, I'm all for it and bring that awareness to other people.

2314
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:18,000
You know, this is to me, this is I mean, even if the game creator was was in the culture, I think that doing something like this is what cultural appreciation is instead of appropriation.

2315
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:29,000
You know, appropriation is when you are taking something from another culture with no respect to the context of how these things are and are trying to turn your own profit for it without benefiting.

2316
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:35,000
When Cher dresses up like a Native American, that's, you know, the 70s were different white girls with dreads. Right.

2317
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:48,000
OK. You know, so but I'm saying that, you know, you can take, you know, like, for example, say that I went out and I developed a game about Gecko in Kyoto.

2318
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:56,000
Right. Which I love to do. I would, in doing so, consult.

2319
02:28:56,000 --> 02:29:10,000
With, you know, maybe a few proprietresses of Nokia speak to Gecko if I could and then make sure that when I'm putting out a game like that, I would have resources that link to these things.

2320
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:20,000
Or if I was going to do a local native culture, I would make sure I did it in conjunction with their tribal leaders, with their historians and then give resources.

2321
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:28,000
And in the case of something like that, I would give money to those groups, like a portion of my profits.

2322
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:34,000
Going to this completely tangent. So I apologize. But apparently we actually have an Anchorage local listening to the show.

2323
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:49,000
So Stroots 89 is in our chat going, oh, hey, that's my local station. And I was like, because I couldn't remember, I was like, is that the station where there was the on air reporter that was doing an investigation into a pot business?

2324
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:56,000
And then she says, after the port is done, she's like, and I have to say, I'm the owner of the place. So fuck it, I'm out.

2325
02:29:56,000 --> 02:30:01,000
She says it live on air and walks off the set. You have to look for this clip on YouTube. It's great.

2326
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:07,000
And apparently that was an Anchorage in that house. Because I remember I was like, I know it was an Alaska station. Was it Anchorage or was it Juneau? What was it?

2327
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:14,000
So thank you to Stroots for confirming that was an Anchorage incident that happened there. Oh, it's on YouTube, Pixelboggers.

2328
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:22,000
I wish I had this stuff on demand more or had the setup Bobby had where I could pull it up real fast. Maybe in the near future. I'm getting the concerns of these other ideas.

2329
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:32,000
But yeah, look it up on YouTube. I wish I remembered her name. I don't remember, but maybe like Anchorage reporter quits on air or something like that.

2330
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:43,000
I ought to find it. Tiger Claws or somebody's on the case now and I'll find the YouTube for you. But it's a great moment because the reaction of the anchor, she's just like, oh, okay.

2331
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:45,000
She's just like, she doesn't know what the hell to do. It's great.

2332
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:49,000
So I want to put out the challenge though, going back to my story.

2333
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:50,000
Thank you, Matt. Yes.

2334
02:30:50,000 --> 02:31:01,000
I would like for people to find a game that highlights and celebrates a native culture in your area.

2335
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:07,000
And then I want you to tweet me a link to that game at Dark Sakura on Twitter.

2336
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:19,000
Tag me, tag O-L-R. But I want to see if you not only just go out and find, I want you to play it. Play it and tell me what you've learned.

2337
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:22,000
If you've already played it, great. At me the game, tell me what you've learned.

2338
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:35,000
But I'd like for people to look outside of just standard, oh, this is fun entertainment or oh, this is a pretty game entertainment and find a game that teaches you something about a culture other than your own.

2339
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:39,000
Real teaching, not just a romanticized version.

2340
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:42,000
Let us know if you get any tweets. I'd be super curious.

2341
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:50,000
The Indians shared the food with the pilgrims and bird to bird to bird to and everybody was happy forever.

2342
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:56,000
Something of that culture and not, you know, changed by another.

2343
02:31:56,000 --> 02:32:03,000
And even if it's, you know, the horrible impact that Western colonialism had on these cultures, I want you to learn something.

2344
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:10,000
I want you to use video games and show them as an educational tool so that I can then go back to my mother and go, ha, I told you.

2345
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:13,000
Kidding, kidding. No, I just want people to learn something.

2346
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:20,000
Okay. Let's move on. A game that maybe, I don't know, some people think this is a giant troll.

2347
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:25,000
Some people think this may be a game where you would learn something. I don't know. Let's talk about the Jesus game.

2348
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:28,000
We have to talk about the Jesus game. What is this all about, Loki?

2349
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:36,000
So the game is called I Am Jesus Christ and it's a game made by a developer who does a lot of these simulator games.

2350
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
And you know I have B-roll.

2351
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:41,000
I'm glad you do. That's fantastic.

2352
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:48,000
So the developer has made like other simulator games such as Thief Simulator, House Flipper, that type of thing.

2353
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:56,000
And it looks like a really weird like VR type of game where you perform miracles basically.

2354
02:32:56,000 --> 02:33:10,000
And it, yeah, it doesn't really look real. Like I watch, I watch this and it reminds me a lot of this YouTube channel I watch called Buttersight Down where they just, all you see is the dude's hands all the time and it does weird stuff.

2355
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:17,000
But yeah, you have, you know, the performing miracles such as, you know, walking across water.

2356
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:21,000
Who loves everyone white? Jesus wasn't my white man.

2357
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:28,000
And then, and then this, it gets really weird where they're all like, now it's like, wow, you get to hang, hang out with your friends, literally.

2358
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:31,000
And they weren't really his friends. Yeah.

2359
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:39,000
And then he ascends to heaven, and then wait after the credits, after the credits. Look at that, look at that. The sequel resurrected.

2360
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:42,000
Why is he white?

2361
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:47,000
It's flea points out for the people who would actually care about this game, Jesus is white, lol.

2362
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:51,000
So, hard facts, hard truths in our chat.

2363
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:57,000
Yeah, so, so it's, it's the publisher, Playway Essay, they've done a bunch of different games.

2364
02:33:57,000 --> 02:34:09,000
It's weird though, because they have a lot of different, it's not like it's a new thing. They have like the car mechanic simulator stuff, cooking simulator, which is actually a pretty popular VR game that they have.

2365
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:20,000
So they have some actual solid games in, in their portfolio here, but it seems like that they're kind of developed by different developers and all published under the same group.

2366
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:29,000
But I mean, I don't know, the other games are kind of like VR, so maybe they decided there's money to be made in this industry.

2367
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:33,000
And let's be real, there's money to be made here, so why not?

2368
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:41,000
But they have, they have a whole ton of games that are on here, but a lot of these managers, simulators, but yeah.

2369
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:51,000
I'm going to just say what y'all are thinking. I can't wait to see the live streams, because you know there's going to be live streams and people are going to do some really heinous things.

2370
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:58,000
So let's bring on the live streams. So, I mean, like what happens if you lose? Like, how does that work?

2371
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:01,000
Like that's, that's what we didn't see in there, or is that?

2372
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:03,000
He just let the, let the people die.

2373
02:35:03,000 --> 02:35:05,000
I don't know. What happens to that old lady if you don't...

2374
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:13,000
Is this, is this the Jesus version of the boys, you know, where he's like, well, I can't save you, so we'll just kill everybody.

2375
02:35:13,000 --> 02:35:14,000
I don't know.

2376
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:15,000
Erase the evidence.

2377
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:16,000
So we'll see.

2378
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:20,000
Questbuster says, I guess it's more a faithful Jesus sim than the fight of the gods.

2379
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
Sia Tabiri in chat suggests...

2380
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:23,000
Jesus RP.

2381
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:27,000
You just miracle yourself into winning. So, anyway.

2382
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:35,000
Moving on. Let's talk about Star Wars and how it's going to work together with Fortnite. Yep, you heard me.

2383
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:43,000
So Star Wars and Fortnite are going to be coming together because a new scene, a new exclusive scene from The Rise of Skywalker,

2384
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:50,000
or Star Wars Episode 9, as I'm sure you all are aware of, will be shown in Fortnite at the Risky Reels.

2385
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:53,000
It's a theater located in Fortnite. This was all revealed via...

2386
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:58,000
Aren't you supposed to be playing a game and not just sitting there watching, like, video?

2387
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
I mean, at least...

2388
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:05,000
Fortnite has apparently taken some things from PlayStation Home and run with it.

2389
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:08,000
I don't, I don't know what to think about this, but that's, that's what they're doing.

2390
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:16,000
So, yeah, December 14th, six days before the film is out, a new and exclusive scene from the movie will be in Fortnite.

2391
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:25,000
It's probably just going to be like BB-8 doing something cute or, you know, confirmation that not Baby Yoda is going to be in the movie.

2392
02:36:25,000 --> 02:36:29,000
How much is Epic paying for that kind of privilege? Or vice versa?

2393
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:34,000
I don't know. It's going to be shown at two o'clock. I don't know if you have to pay. It's in Fortnite.

2394
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:40,000
Well, no, I mean, like, because it's in Fortnite, like, how much do they have to pay Luke, you know, Disney here?

2395
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:44,000
It's a publicity thing. I don't know. It's probably not going to be that big of a scene either.

2396
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
It's not going to be, I mean, I would-

2397
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
It's the end of the movie!

2398
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:54,000
Nifty805 says, is Fortnite getting emo Kylo Ren? And then Questbuster says, may the Fortnite be with you.

2399
02:36:54,000 --> 02:37:00,000
Oh, God. All right. Anyhow, let's see.

2400
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:04,000
So recently there was a Stormtrooper skin that was added into the game.

2401
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:10,000
So you have that as well. If you want to go cosplay in Fortnite when you go watch the new clip.

2402
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:16,000
I can't believe I just said that, but I did. Anyway, there it is. And yeah, Tigerclaw with the reality.

2403
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:20,000
That clip will be online immediately. Yeah, I'm sure people are going to be, like, live streaming it.

2404
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:24,000
So that's why I think the clip is not going to be that big a deal. It's going to be a short clip.

2405
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
Glad you don't have to play Fortnite.

2406
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:30,000
Or just, you know, not watch the clip and enjoy the movie.

2407
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:34,000
Anyway, we're going to get to some calls.

2408
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:40,000
So if you want to be on the show, you can join our green room over at vognetwork.com.

2409
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:46,000
That's vognetwork.com slash Discord. And that will get you in the Discord server and you can call in.

2410
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
And we'll be bringing some calls on air.

2411
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
I don't know if we have any last minute stories.

2412
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,000
No, I looked. There's-

2413
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
Really?

2414
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,000
It's pretty barren out there.

2415
02:37:56,000 --> 02:38:02,000
There was a rumor. Okay, so there was a rumor that, um...

2416
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:08,000
What was it? That they're going to be porting some more PlayStation 4 games over the PC.

2417
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:14,000
Um, Horizon Zero Dawn. But I don't know if that's the case.

2418
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:21,000
Apparently the rumor is coming from the person that predicted Death Stranding or leaked Death Stranding or something.

2419
02:38:21,000 --> 02:38:24,000
Yeah, I was going to say, we know that Death Stranding is coming. Is this really interesting?

2420
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
I don't know. We'll see.

2421
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:30,000
We'll see. Alright, we do have somebody waiting in the green room, so let's get to a quick call.

2422
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
Hi, you're on Orange Mountain Radio. Who's this?

2423
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:36,000
Hey, Rob. This is Metal Mayhem. How are you?

2424
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000
Hey, Metal Mayhem. I'm good. What's on your mind, buddy?

2425
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:47,000
Excuse me. Not too much. Since you were covering at the top of the show, I thought I'd talk about-

2426
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:50,000
Hey, Metal Mayhem, we're getting a- Hey, just going to interrupt you real quick.

2427
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:55,000
There's a little bit of echo when you're talking, so please try to make sure you're away from speakers or anything like that.

2428
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:58,000
And go ahead and get your question out.

2429
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:05,000
Yeah, sorry. I'm using my webcam because my headset's followed up. I'm trying to move around the best I can.

2430
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:17,000
Since it was brought up at the top of the show, I thought I'd talk about PlayStation and its 25th anniversary.

2431
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:35,000
Yeah, since the three of you have been using PlayStations in one form or another for quite some time, I wanted to ask you what initially drew you to the system?

2432
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:41,000
Sorry, ask the question one more time. There was a little feedback there at the end.

2433
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:46,000
Oh, I was just asking what drew you to the PlayStation.

2434
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:48,000
What do you think of PlayStation?

2435
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:49,000
What do we think?

2436
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:52,000
What convinced you to buy your PlayStation?

2437
02:39:52,000 --> 02:40:01,000
What convinced you to buy PlayStation? All right, gotcha. Just because of the feedback, I'm going to drop you back in the green room, but thank you. We'll take on the question here in the studio.

2438
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:03,000
Thanks, Metal Mayhem. Take care, buddy.

2439
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:04,000
Final Fantasy VII.

2440
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:09,000
I was going to say, I think we kind of hit on it in the opening segment, but Metal Mayhem might have joined the show a little late.

2441
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:13,000
What specifically drew you to PlayStation?

2442
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:19,000
Well, we did tell the stories about buying PlayStation, but maybe we didn't really get into the why.

2443
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:25,000
I mean, I mentioned, sure, that Final Fantasy VII and that Nintendo 64, but was there other stuff with that?

2444
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:32,000
And I think maybe the allure of the CD being a way to do that, to play games, I think was maybe part of it.

2445
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:35,000
Not that I necessarily needed another CD player, but that was certainly a thing.

2446
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:43,000
And I'm trying to remember if Symphony of the Night was out yet, because I remember that was a game that really sold me on PlayStation as a format.

2447
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:56,000
Because I think specifically with that game, it showed that something like two-dimensional, like Castlevania or the original Castlevania IV, could still be done very well on PlayStation.

2448
02:40:56,000 --> 02:41:08,000
So I think really like Castlevania and Symphony of the Night was another one of those big, big releases that showed, hey, not everything has to be like 3D polygon-like craziness, but we can do some other types of stuff as well.

2449
02:41:08,000 --> 02:41:10,000
So there's that as well.

2450
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:19,000
Darsakha, was there a little bit more like the why? Like, what was it about PlayStation that drew you to that versus Nintendo 64?

2451
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,000
Or I guess maybe Sega Saturn?

2452
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:25,000
I didn't know anyone had a Nintendo 64 and PlayStation came out before Saturn.

2453
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:29,000
So that was it. It was what was there, what it had access to.

2454
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:32,000
What were the early games you were playing? You were probably playing it before we were.

2455
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:42,000
Toushinden, Jumping Flash, Jumping Flash 2. I'm trying to think what else I was playing.

2456
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:46,000
I know another big one was Bust... Well, I still...

2457
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:47,000
Pandemonium.

2458
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:51,000
Out of habit, I still call it Bust-A-Groove, because that's what it was in the US.

2459
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:58,000
That was after I'd already moved out here. So yeah, I had Bust-A-Move. I had Bust-A-Move 2. Lots of the Bimani.

2460
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:03,000
I think I have like every Beatmania home version, like 5-key Beatmania.

2461
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:08,000
And yeah, just a lot of that stuff.

2462
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:16,000
Dan and I, one of his requirements for our relationship was that I beat Castlevania Symphony of the Night,

2463
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:22,000
or as it was over there, Nocturne in the Moonlight. It was in the Dracula X series, which I did.

2464
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:29,000
And you probably have echoes of the past of me screaming about taking forever to find another jewel ring

2465
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:34,000
and trying to get my Yotsutsuna, or Yotsutsuna, whatever the blade was called.

2466
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:40,000
And so Dan and I actually still quote that game, too. I'm interested in this.

2467
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:47,000
And I thought it was funny they got both voice actors, the Japanese and the English one, for Bloodstained for the librarian.

2468
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:48,000
Yeah.

2469
02:42:48,000 --> 02:42:51,000
Or for, what was his name? D?

2470
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:53,000
Yeah, the equivalent of D.

2471
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:54,000
Yeah.

2472
02:42:54,000 --> 02:43:01,000
You know another game that was huge on PlayStation and really kind of like selling on that console,

2473
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:07,000
another music game that we have yet to mention, but I remember the first time, and this was from a demo disc,

2474
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:12,000
I remember the first time I played Parappa the Rappa and the first stage in that game.

2475
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:18,000
And it was like, holy shit, I'm playing a cartoon. Like literally that was like a moving fluid cartoon.

2476
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:24,000
And it was, I know we always kind of think of video games and it was like, oh, Super Mario Brothers 2 looks like a cartoon.

2477
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:29,000
And then on Super Nintendo, you know, but like it was like with PlayStation with how fluid it moved

2478
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:33,000
and, you know, kind of literally coming off the page with the types of graphics.

2479
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:40,000
I remember just being really thrown like for a loop in a good way by Parappa the Rappa's style.

2480
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:45,000
So some different answers so that we don't repeat ourselves too much on that question there.

2481
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:50,000
But yeah, I'm sure a lot of people, you know, looking back on PlayStation,

2482
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:53,000
I bet there's a lot of people that didn't come into it with PlayStation 1.

2483
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:58,000
You know, we all did, but I bet there's some people that didn't really discover PlayStation until PlayStation 2

2484
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:05,000
or maybe PlayStation 3 because of PS2 being a DVD player or just the fact that maybe you're a little younger or what have you.

2485
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:10,000
And so you haven't maybe, you know, you were still a baby when PlayStation 1 was still all the rage.

2486
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:13,000
But, you know, you're a kid when PlayStation 2 happens. So anyway.

2487
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:16,000
All right. Well, Metal Mayhem was the only one we had in the green room for now.

2488
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:20,000
So I guess we'll go ahead and close up that portion there.

2489
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:23,000
And Loki says we didn't have any last minute stories.

2490
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:27,000
So that brings us towards the end and final thoughts and all that good stuff.

2491
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:30,000
So I do want to thank everybody for tuning into Orange Launch Radio tonight.

2492
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:33,000
And thanks for listening to us.

2493
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:41,000
We really appreciate you guys checking us out, whether it was live here at Twitch TV on Sunday nights or if it was via the podcast feed or however you found Orange Launch Radio.

2494
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:46,000
Thank you so much. Help us spread the word. Tell a friend or two about the show because we are at the show where every gamer has a voice.

2495
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:49,000
But if the voices aren't out there, how can we air them?

2496
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:56,000
So we hope to find more and more people through the coming weeks and on into 2020.

2497
02:44:56,000 --> 02:44:59,000
So thanks again for being here, no matter how you were here.

2498
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:03,000
I guess we will now go around and get some final thoughts for the week.

2499
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,000
Loki, we'll start with you. Your final thought tonight.

2500
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:12,000
I'm hoping to work more on my game because that was something else I did this week was work more on the procedural generation portion of it.

2501
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:20,000
Although I'm getting to the point now where I have to do the calculation for which doors so you can't backtrack.

2502
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:22,000
But I was thinking about it the other day.

2503
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:28,000
What if I just don't do that and have it where you can backtrack and then I can also incorporate like secrets and stuff that way.

2504
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:35,000
I'm like, well, that'd be kind of cool. And that would save me a lot of work. But then I've already kind of started.

2505
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:41,000
My final thought is I'll see you guys here Thursday at VOG Network for the Game Awards co-stream with Bobby Blackwolf.

2506
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:46,000
And just a quick, cheap plug for my personal channel at Rob Roberts.

2507
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:52,000
I will try to get in the habit of doing more streaming just, you know, with all the changes I've been going through this year with a new job and stuff.

2508
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:57,000
It threw me off for a little bit. But I've been having some more weeknights where I'm like, oh, I should do something.

2509
02:45:57,000 --> 02:46:05,000
Now I'm kind of trying to decide, should I try to play more like Final Fantasy 14 and try to like build up in one certain game as streaming?

2510
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:09,000
Or should I continue to play a little bit of everything? And I kind of gravitate towards playing a little bit of everything.

2511
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:14,000
But Final Fantasy 14 can always be that game when it's like, I don't know what else to stream tonight. I can always play 14.

2512
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:20,000
But I do want to play more Pokemon because I could, I think I only have like maybe captured like 130 or something like that.

2513
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:26,000
So I have a lot more Pokemon still to catch in Shield and doing some raids and so forth.

2514
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:33,000
And maybe some of you will raid with me if I live stream it so I can get a goddamn Snorlax. So that would be pretty cool.

2515
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:40,000
So Shane is saying, yeah, Shane's kind of echoing that there. So I swear I said that before I read your comment there.

2516
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:44,000
So that's all my thoughts. DarkSakura, last but not least, your final thought tonight.

2517
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:48,000
I want to thank the people who've already replied to my Twitter post.

2518
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:57,000
Again, if a video game taught you something, just reply to my tweet or just tag it video games taught me.

2519
02:46:57,000 --> 02:47:08,000
But yeah, just show me how video games have taught you a thing, a legit, you know, lesson, you know, be it about history or culture or language or psychology, name it.

2520
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:13,000
Just link me something or tell me about something that video games have taught you.

2521
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:15,000
A homework assignment from Ms. Sakura.

2522
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:18,000
And tag it as video games taught me, please.

2523
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:21,000
OK. Cool. All right. Good luck. Hope that takes off.

2524
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:24,000
All right. That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2525
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:29,000
Thanks again, you guys, for tuning in tonight. And we will see you in seven days to do it all over again.

2526
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:32,000
Have a great week, everybody. And good night.

2527
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:35,000
