00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,360
In this decade we've seen a lot happen, way more than I can reasonably summarize in 13

2
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,600
and a half seconds. Join us for the next couple of hours while we touch on the holiday trickle

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,120
of gaming news and do a deep dive into the memory vault. All this starts right now in

4
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:34,720
the show wherever gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio. Hello my friends out there on the internet

5
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:41,500
and welcome back to the very last Orange Lounge Radio of the year. My name is Rob Roberts and it

6
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:48,380
is episode number 804 for this December the 29th of 2019. Joining me here in studio DarkSakura or

7
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:52,360
Jamie Summers. Hi. Hi. I'm gonna come on camera for five seconds even though I'm not like wearing

8
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,920
makeup or anything. Alright that's fine because we do tape live at the Voice of the East Network

9
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,880
twitch.tv slash a VOG Network where you can see DarkSakura is wearing a onesie tonight because

10
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,320
tonight is all about cute and comfortable. I'm wearing sweatpants. I'm wearing my cozy kigurumi.

11
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:12,040
It's a red panda. And tech master Loki, hello, who also always joins us here every week is wearing his

12
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:19,360
is that does that say ho-man? It does say ho-man. It's like he-man. I follow a lot of those on Twitter

13
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:27,400
but I well Santa's got his shirt off Loki that's it's a little thotty there. No he doesn't. He does

14
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,360
not have his shirt off. It looks like it from this angle. Oh no okay from the angle with the light it

15
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:37,880
looked like this was like his chest. No it's just a Santa elf and he has a candy cane. It was the

16
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:44,000
angle or I'm thirsty you be the judge. But the angle of the light bouncing off it kind of made

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,080
it look funny. All right anyway that's hilarious. Hey ha hi we're here and yeah we're taping live

18
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,880
during this holiday week. Hope you guys have been having a good holiday whatever it is you're

19
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,960
celebrating. I know DarkSakura mentioned off-air that it's the last night of Hanukkah and I know

20
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,800
she you lit the last candle for you headed over here right? I did and it's on my Instagram which

21
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,800
is at DarkSakura if you want to see I use an oil menorah because candle wax everywhere is shitty.

22
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:15,840
They make this stuff though called wax off and I laugh because it's him whacking off but it smells

23
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,640
like really bad. Well I'll plug my Instagram too at Mr. Rob Roberts that's MR Rob Roberts just like

24
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,400
my Twitter account and because I didn't post anything quite so important but I have been

25
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,360
posting like you know that memes been going around that you you film yourself and it's like what

26
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,720
Pokemon are you and it flashes around. I got horsey for what Pokemon. Yeah everybody says it's just

27
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,040
Russia trying to steal our identities but I mean what's. Well I'm gonna go back to live journal.

28
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:49,200
Let them have it. There's nothing worth taking here. Well actually speaking of Russia getting

29
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,080
all of your information and being online I actually am reviving my own blog to cross post

30
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,240
over to vog fun at DarkSakura.com. All right. You can see what it looks like right now because

31
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:06,280
right now I'm like this font sucks and I'm on Helvetica right now. And I also want to briefly

32
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:13,800
mention that on Christmas Day you and I had dinner we had a movie or no I'm sorry it was well day

33
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:19,320
after it was technically but it was our Christmas celebration it was dangerous we saw a movie I

34
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,040
know you were really happy scene day celebration it was our Boxing Day celebration we always get

35
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,680
when we get a chance to do it we always get some kind of Asian food so this year we got Vietnamese

36
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:35,200
yes so none of us got fall even though we're at a fall place now speaking of Boxing Day I have a

37
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:41,640
special surprise but I need to go get it okay so I'm filled time I you liked cats I did whereas

38
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:48,040
everybody is not wrong you can tell us a little bit cats thing and I'll be actually gonna be I'm

39
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,840
not gonna go super into detail but I'm gonna be relating some very personal stuff about myself

40
00:03:52,840 --> 00:04:01,440
when I was in middle school I was having a really terrible time I had a really hard life I will say

41
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:09,400
and someone some relative gave me a CD for cats and the music made me very very happy and then I

42
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:15,520
was having again a hard time in high school and it came out that my high school band was gonna get

43
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:23,280
to play at Carnegie Hall and we were gonna go get our choice of a play one of them was Tommy the

44
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,480
other one was phantom and no I think phantom was sold out no one of them was phantom and one of

45
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:35,800
them was cats and so of course I picked cats and I had such a beautiful memory of not to pun the

46
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:44,800
song but for me it was actually one event in my life that turned me off of doing something very

47
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:51,520
drastic and every time I hear the music from it it's like this momentary forgetfulness of everything

48
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,200
that is terrible in my life not everything is terrible now I'm a lot better than I was back

49
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:04,320
then but going to see the movie for me was it sort of brought back all of that happy moment I

50
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:11,200
had that day in the Winter Garden theater and I could I could forget the the body and the fake

51
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:16,480
fur and the naked thing cuz for me I really felt like I was transported back to that night at the

52
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:22,200
Winter Garden theater and when I got home that night I actually kind of bawled my eyes out

53
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:27,800
because that emotion was so overwhelming for me and so I'm really looking forward to seeing it

54
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:33,800
again I had I got the soundtrack for the movie I like the new song that's in it I miss the the

55
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:39,960
awful battle of the peaks and the follicles I did go and do a very in-depth analysis will moderately

56
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,800
in-depth analysis of what was missing would have been changed and I like the I like some of the

57
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:51,140
changes in it for me it's a different universe of the same story I I liked what's his name as

58
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:56,900
McCavity Idris Elba mm-hmm he was perfect for McCavity I liked everybody in it I love they

59
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:04,380
got a ballerina for Victoria and Judi Dench was I honestly say that she was probably my favorite

60
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:08,060
change because I really liked her as a little Deuteronomy so for me all the people out there

61
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:14,060
making fun of it ninety percent of the people I have found have never seen the stage play never

62
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:19,180
so they don't know and the people who've really liked it have been people like me who have seen

63
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:26,980
the stage play so go fig but I'm planning on seeing it again Thursday cool yeah well now I

64
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:32,660
feel like Ellen but here's a present okay so um but actually not not my to in all this is actually

65
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:39,440
came to us from Canada from our pal Delvin at BG realness I have no idea what's Rob gave me a

66
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,500
night no I gave her a knife but I have no idea what's in this but you might have some type of

67
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:50,300
idea right all I know is that we did an exchange of things we cannot get in each other's countries

68
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:54,540
plus I said homemade cookies so there's gonna be Canadian things in here I'm gonna be mad if

69
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,740
there's not any Swiss chalet gravy okay that is not the spirit of the holiday I'm kidding all

70
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:04,300
right I will say quickly I I realized dark soccer has a much more emotional connection to cats than

71
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:10,560
I do I there were some parts of it that were kind of like silly to me but I didn't think it was as

72
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,840
bad as everybody saying it is I kind of feel like most of the people that are talking bad didn't

73
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,360
bother to see it I will say though the CGI was a choice they should have just done the Broadway

74
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,840
they should just have the Broadway makeup and costumes it would have been fine I would have

75
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:28,440
liked for them to have had a bit more merger of the styles you know the CG bodies were great I

76
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:34,880
remember I don't know if it was Tiara or Victoria who said it about you know Jenny any dots taking

77
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:41,240
off her coat yeah but that's what happened on the stage production and actually it's one cat

78
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:47,080
playing her in the dressy outfit and with and honestly I liked the costume change better with

79
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:52,880
her that little purple number instead of just this whole fringe bodysuit I freaking love drum

80
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,080
tum tucker I just wish that they would have had more of like the fuzzy elements they had in the

81
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:02,120
play you can't say cats is the worst movie of the year when this is the same year that x-men

82
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,520
Dark Phoenix came out I'm sorry Oh dark sorry just lit up I don't even know what's in it what's

83
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:12,280
in it for God's sake all dressed okay I am a big fan of all dress chips heck yeah I've never had

84
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:20,200
them they're great they're they're very vinegary though we also okay you can have I will try one

85
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:26,680

108
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,160
obviously this week was a little bit slower in gaming news but as Loki was saying with the tongue

109
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:29,440
in cheek this is kind of a chance for us to reflect on the decade yeah now before cuz some

110
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,760
people are gonna play pull this card and that is that the next decade doesn't really start for

111
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:41,480
another year because a decade runs from it would be 2011 through 2020 would be the decade but you

112
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:46,400
know what that's not here's the thing I think a lot of numerology is big for a lot of people right

113
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:51,240
so I think a lot of people are like we're we're in the tens or the teens at this point and now

114
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:57,840
we're gonna start the Roaring Twenties start so it's more looking back on the last decade a decade

honorable mentions it's fine so um you know these are gonna be like our top three biggest like news

132
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,360
and just to kind of give you an idea to look back on how long a decade was we were listening

133
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,560
to Bobby Blackwell here in studio who's on before us a vog network every week and he was kind of

145
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:07,000
was the blaster master on the Wii not the pretty good reboot they did later overdrive and then

146
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,240
Sonic 4 wasn't very good either but then they did Sonic Mania and that was much better so anyway

the stuff that was the president and then a dark Sakura I know this is gonna be a little bit of a

149
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:28,440
sad memory but in in in all honestness this is one of my favorite olr moments that ever happened so

150
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,840
back in the beginning of the decade in 2010 we were still doing this show at your house so on

151
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:39,240
the show February 28 2010 stories included news from Nintendo's World Summit and Shermy's review

152
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:44,560
of Sony video game related show the tester oh is that the one where she threw up no she shit on

153
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,560
the she shit on the floor that was it while we were talking about Sony's the death Shermy Shermy

154
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:54,240
died in the last decade she did but you want to know what the last thing she did before she died

155
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:01,560
she took a shit on Dan shoe no this is what happened Dan was playing Borderlands huh and I

156
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:07,120
think Borderlands 2 and sure me we just got back from Disneyland I was keeping a wrapped in a in a

157
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,640
hot towel from the dryer so she went back into her little bedroom which was the dryer room and

158
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,640
she patted me on the foot and I went to go get ready for the bed after I gave her scritches next

159
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:21,360
thing I know she's killed over in the living room dead still warm and there was a big shit on Dan

160
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:28,200
shoe and so he's cleaning cleaning the body up for me gonna go get her cremated for me and next

161
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:34,720
thing here is god damn it cat and I'm like what don't talk like that about the cast like she

162
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:43,760
shat in my shoe god damn it cat and so anyway yeah we lost we've lost many many good pet memories

163
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:49,760
I mean Maruko and Sanrio from our family you know and I sent you video not long ago that found of

164
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,520
Sanrio that I took yeah that's the other interesting thing about this last decade is that we've

165
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:59,000
documented so much of it on our phones obviously iPhones and androids existed in the last decade

166
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,360
but I think they've really become prolific in this decade and she with the video inside my iPhone

167
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:10,000
that's right what was great is the very next episode episode 358 in the most legendary episode

168
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,560
yet olr takes a stand against cuss free week the only way possible with the fuck show stories

169
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:20,680
include portal to being announced that was a big game of the decade we'll have to see if that comes

170
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:26,800
up in any games of the decade list a little later but anyway so yeah it was a bit yeah remember all

171
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:32,980
the hype going into the fuck show which was like this olr in joke for years and I think it had to

172
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:38,400
do with a story like this shows you how old the show is okay like a story about counting the

173
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,920
number of times the word fuck was said in Pulp Fiction and about like how is it even possible

174
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,760
to say fuck that many times and we kept saying we'll I'll do it one day one day we're gonna

175
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,840
outdo it we're just gonna have a fuck show and so finally it happened at the beginning of the

176
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:55,200
decade we had a show and because there was a story about national cuss free week or something

177
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:01,920
who said this is the week so we did the fuck show and it was it was kind of a letdown I think the

178
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:06,560
joke got old after about three never lived up to the hype it's no it didn't live up to the hype

179
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:12,280
yeah fuck a lot we did that was great it was liberating it was it was very livery all right

180
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:18,480
free the fuck top three so looking back the whole decade you know those are some of the

181
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,080
headlines from early on but looking back on the whole decade what do you think were the three

182
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,480
biggest headlines I want to know you guys in chat to some of your big headlines although hold off

183
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,360
because they'll scroll off the screen before I can see them but be thinking about it more than

184
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:35,200
three I'll leave a space for honorable mentions before number one okay so we're gonna do three

185
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,120
to honorable mentions one sound good okay all right then dark soccer I want it you're ready

186
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,520
to go so number three what is your number three I'm actually combining one then okay it's the

187
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:50,560
advent of certain kinds of games the indie game for one thing super meat boy vvvvvv came out in

188
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:56,880
2010 undertale off do you remember off we played as the baseball batter that one had a big internet

189
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,920
following yeah and then there were a lot of them just popping up on steam steam really took off

190
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:08,960
with the indie games and now we had it have these developers that you know the big names are working

191
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:15,240
with these independent developers love you why why are two who gave us our favorite game sure and

192
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:21,800
pixel shits no I love that and so if we were writing it down would we say they're prolific

193
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:26,200
ness of the indie game yeah cuz the indie game isn't necessarily new to this decade the advent

194
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:31,840
of the popularity and just the the the ease of getting it got to be so much what Nintendo is

195
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,960
finally embracing it that shows you how far it's come and with that that also brings about the

196
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,160
advent of the narrative genre because a lot of those games were made by maybe not the biggest

197
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:48,680
development houses but we had the Edith Finch we had everybody's gone to the rapture we had to the

198
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:55,760
moon which was done in 16-bit style one of my favorites what was that other one that I can't

199
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:02,320
think of the name of that wasn't Edith Finch or everyone's gone to the rapture but at any rate

200
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,640
it's just it's it's really an exploration of different genre and different development

201
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:14,320
styles and going outside of the norm for what you're looking for I think I really really think

202
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:20,840
that that was a big thing is that people really looking outside of the box we have a big surge in

203
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:27,120
creativity and new concepts and new talent and people starting to realize a game isn't something

204
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:33,000
that you have to win it is just something that you enjoy that you get something out of it your

205
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,560
games can experience it's an experience exactly whether or not it's screaming because you died

206
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:43,280
in five seconds hello kaizo mario because that was also you know the big thing but I think that

207
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:48,840
it's that advent of people really finally embracing the other when it comes to their

208
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:53,000
games now some great comments in chat here pixel pockets bringing up gone home it's another great

209
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,400
example of you know but Bobby I think really kind of is putting his finger on a little bit

210
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,900
like why why this decade what made it prolific in this decade I think it's a great comment from

211
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,720
Bobby Black Wolf I think a different way of looking at it is the ease of developing games

212
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,600
that really happened in this decade making games was really hard before unity and unreal engine

213
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:17,040
took the hardest parts and extra plated them for you same thing with XNA that's why indie games

214
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:21,360
blew up people even using Swift yeah people didn't need to know linear algebra to make a 3d engine to

215
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,160
be able to make a game they just need to make the game and you look at some of the biggest hits of

216
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:29,560
the decade things like Five Nights at Freddy's that was done in what click team fusion or whatever

217
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:37,720
that is undertale was done in another one of those I think yeah but I mean but really it's the fact

218
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:44,080
I agree that the development has become so accessible that and you know back in the day

219
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,800
we used the only thing that we really had to do something like this was maybe the occasional

220
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:56,160
visual novel maker and RPG maker I mean really that was it to my knowledge or you know doing

221
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:04,080
like a mud or you know something like that but or you know text games because those were fairly

222
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:11,640
easy but now we have like legit fun entertaining games that we can play on our home consoles or

223
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:19,320
our computers that are as immersive as any big title you know release and more of these people

224
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:25,320
are now are finding that they have not just a way to make a living of making a game but they also

225
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:30,240
have a way of using their voice of getting a message out there that they want to of course

226
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:37,880
some people are also using that ability for for I would even just flat-out say evil like the school

227
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:47,800
shooter game and the series of anti-democracy games coming out of China you know but at the

228
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:54,640
same time a lot of people are really using it as a force for good okay that's a really good really

229
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:00,520
good take on one of the biggest things the decade kind of the the rise and the portability and the

230
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:05,280
the new stories that have opened up in the indie gaming world good Loki I'll let you go next what's

231
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:10,240
your number three my number three is probably gonna be because I've been kind of going back

232
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:19,640
and forth with my rankings here so I'll say because it did get a lot of like coverage in

233
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:27,080
then it just kind of went up and then down though yeah somebody in chat just mentioned oh yeah yeah

234
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:33,360
because oh yeah was like this big it was kind of one of the things that got Kickstarter some notice

235
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:39,160
because that was kind of launched but well the you know game funding through

236
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:44,040
kickstart was really kind of like being brought to attention of everybody who threw you know

237
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,560
that we yeah and how much money it raised everything and they're like oh yeah we're

238
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:51,480
gonna take on the consoles and everything and they came out and it was kind of flopped and then

239
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:59,040
I don't know but I mean you can kind of say that it sort of led the way with other you know maybe

240
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:04,760
not directly led the way but you know you have other indie consoles now or other smaller consoles

241
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:11,120
coming out like you know with the officially you know the Nintendo Super Nintendo Genesis and then

242
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:18,160
like not so well it's sort of it's still official but like you know eventually the Intellivision

243
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:24,120
and then Atari's doing their own thing so it kind of you know maybe a little bit too early

244
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:32,200
before it's time to to pie in the sky but it's just the implementation which is not very good

245
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:38,240
okay yeah and kind of also what that represented for Kickstarter I don't know if Kickstarter is

246
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,240
gonna come up again on anybody's top three but I think certainly the OUYA is a good kind of

247
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:48,240
benchmark for showing like the Kickstarter and kind of like the pluses and the minuses yeah I

248
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:53,680
mean lots of things like oculus rift you know was a big one there's also all the other games

249
00:24:54,680 --> 00:25:00,160
make it man clone I can't even remember the name of it now my name and I didn't thank you

250
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:08,080
beat you by nine seconds but yeah what but and I say it kind of kind of mixed here pod culture

251
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:13,400
says that would be me I actually liked the OUYA some people liked it and you know considering I

252
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,840
think a lot of people kind of pre-ordered those or kick-started those things I should say to be

253
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,560
able to play retro stuff on them and you know they were gonna be open-ended it was very easy to put

254
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:26,000
emulators on them I think for people that were just looking to do that that we have probably

255
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,800
delivered very well I'm not saying pocos just one of those people but I think there are many people

256
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:34,920
that got what they wanted out of OUYA it's just OUYA for whatever reason I'm not sure we can to

257
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:40,880
this day kind of figure out where did OUYA stumble why couldn't OUYA keep it going it just wasn't a

258
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,400
lot of people developing stuff for it and they were like putting out first off like their

259
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:50,960
controller was crap it was good though that you could use your own controller with it which is

260
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,360
nice but the software offerings weren't very good you had to have demos for all your games

261
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,920
that were on there so I don't know if that was what was holding it back but I did play some of

262
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:03,960
the games on there definitely a lot of the demos and side loading stuff you could do that it just

263
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:12,240
didn't have like really it would have taken off if it had like OUYA like as a platform and then

264
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:19,320
you know oh you can have like a Apple TV type service or not Apple TV Apple arcade type service

265
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,800
you know with it where there's a bunch of indie games you can play on it and stuff would be kind

266
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:28,760
of cool but even when I think they took the OUYA part out of it and just the software and brought

267
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:34,200
that to want to say it was one of the Razer consoles or it might even been the Nvidia shield

268
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,600
one of those has that now I don't even know if it's really doing anything there either right now

269
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,080
because I think now it's like well if I want to play Android games on my TV I can just get an

270
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:50,920
Android TV or I can or not play it on my TV and play it on my phone and do it that way I don't

271
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:54,800
know but maybe at the time that we came out to it I mean let's be real that thing couldn't process

272
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,800
much more than a mobile phone could and I think there just wasn't a lot of demand for those types

273
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:04,280
of games on a big TV at that point I mean maybe OUYA was too soon who knows but yeah I mean look

274
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:09,960
at it like now because you have a lot of people do so with Raspberry Pis and I want it I don't

275
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:14,720
remember the timeline whether you know where the Raspberry Pi was when OUYA was out but like the

276
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:21,040
OUYA is like a $75 it's an expensive console whereas the Pi is like 30 bucks and you can

277
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,760
probably do a lot of the stuff that you can do on the OUYA at least with emulation stuff because

278
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:31,040
that's what a lot of people are interested in on that but I just think that it was just too early

279
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:36,400
like I think now the technology is a lot smaller and you know more powerful that you could probably

280
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:40,640
pull off something like that but it's kind of too late so I don't know they have it who knows

281
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:46,240
someone may try again later but yeah not the OUYA all right so Loki's number three the rise and

282
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,920
quick fall of the OUYA all right my number three my number three moment of gaming news of the

283
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:56,400
decade I'm gonna say when Reggie Fils-Aime debuted the Nintendo switch on the Tonight

284
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:02,680
Show would be my number three top gaming story of the decade I think obviously I'm kind of

285
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:06,760
encompassed I'm using this as an excuse to just talk about the Nintendo switches impact on the

286
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:13,320
industry with this but I think specifically that moment of Reggie Fils-Aime going to debut the

287
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:18,520
switch on the Tonight Show they were able to sell that concept in a way that didn't really work for

288
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:23,200
the Wii U and you know you can contrast that moment of what happened on the Tonight Show with

289
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,920
what had happened previously with the Wii U and that confusion of oh is this an expansion for the

290
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,960
Wii no it's an all-new console remember how that was kind of like a problem yeah whereas when we

291
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,960
saw the Nintendo switch and its demonstration being unveiled and executed on the Tonight Show

292
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:41,560
it made it very clear this is something you play on the TV then you pick it up oh it's ready to go

293
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:46,800
they had a powerhouse game in Breath of the Wild ready to go it kind of didn't matter that that was

294
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,400
a game that really was coming out for the Wii U and had been kind of developed for the Wii U in

295
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:55,200
many ways like it didn't it that part just didn't end up mattering because the way that they sold

296
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,120
the message on the switch was so strong it's almost like all the problems in the Wii U's

297
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:05,520
messaging were being fixed in the way that they were rolling out the switch and this just goes

298
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:11,160
as well to the big gif moment of Miyamoto doing the thumbs down and the thumbs that whole thing

299
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:16,480
and that okay yeah that's silly but yeah silly but it's you know it was also meaningful I think

300
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:21,800
it's cemented Reggie Fils-Aime I think many of us in the gaming industry already knew he was like

301
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:26,680
he was dead you know he's he was like he's that cool guy that showed up on holidays and told you

302
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,520
what you're gonna get that year you know like Reggie Fils-Aime was already kind of like the

303
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:34,480
gaming industry is kind of in that way kind of like you know the cool dad or maybe the cool

304
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,080
uncle would be a better way to put it because then he'd voice a dad maybe like Miyamoto is

305
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:43,920
really the you know but but Reggie Fils-Aime is definitely like the cool uncle that shows up right

306
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:48,960
and certainly you know when he ends up retiring everybody was like oh that sucks to kind of see

307
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,080
him go but at the same time he's earned it and you know hope he has an awesome pension and all that

308
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:58,040
stuff but anyway I digress a little bit but I think what I'm trying to get out with Reggie

309
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:02,360
Fils-Aime in that moment too is that he wasn't just the voice for us but he was able to be

310
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:07,360
comfortable going on The Tonight Show representing gaming representing all of that and kind of

311
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:13,720
putting that out there in the the more the general population in general people and I think it is a

312
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:19,760
big part of the reason why the switch did as well as it did is the message got out there that time

313
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,120
and it's not just The Tonight Show I just think that was kind of like the moment but it was you

314
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:28,800
know just the messaging of the switch and and yes you pick it up you take it out and it's on the go

315
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:35,120
and it was it was huge. SSG100Matt in chat pointing out all we got was a video beforehand The

316
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:40,640
Tonight Show spot was the first time we actually saw it live and in person yep Bobby Blackwell says

317
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,800
everyone thought The Tonight Show demo was faked because everyone was convinced that Nintendo

318
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:50,000
couldn't actually pull it off absolutely and as we're reflecting on that moment all of that was

319
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,320
absolutely true we were probably even skeptical here on this show I think I remember something

320
00:30:54,320 --> 00:31:00,280
about a delay between the the screen and then pulling it out and I think there was wonder

321
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:05,200
about is that show it's fake that's everything and no no that's just how it works or it well

322
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,760
it's just how it works or B it was the prototype as well it probably didn't quite run as snappy at

323
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,560
that point yet there were actually five prototypes for the switch before though I'm sure early well

324
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:18,840
one of them the sides were supposed to be magnetic mm-hmm and then they had another one was supposed

325
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,440
to have like the circular clip on it and it was pretty interesting well I remember the the whole

326
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:27,260
concept behind putting other types of controllers in the in the in the joy con spots although we

327
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:31,160
have seen that with the NES classic controllers I think that's what you can do they do have one

328
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:35,520
though I want to say that you can get one that does have a different d-pad or something on it

329
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:42,120
or has a d-pad instead of the four buttons or you know the the doesn't the switch light I want to

330
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:51,040
say have different d-pad instead of the four buttons yeah yeah I think so so but anyway yeah

331
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,200
and I think so my number three again is Reggie fees and may going on the tonight show to debut

332
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,680
the Nintendo switch and I I think this kind of just all encompasses the switch and Nintendo

333
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:06,160
kind of starting the decade a little bit rough we you didn't go so well for them although I you

334
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,800
know I still think the Wii U had a lot of great moments in it right we had things like Mario maker

335
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,960
you know there were there were great titles with the Wii U but the messaging just it didn't connect

336
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:19,480
and I what we were supposed to first get Breath of the Wild on yeah I will say it to this day

337
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:24,960
though if they hadn't if they'd called it something different it would have done better I fully believe

338
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,760
that but I mean there's no way to know I guess in retrospect but anyway um the Nintendo switch its

339
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:35,440
debut the success that it's found putting Nintendo back out there marching to the beat

340
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:40,720
of their own drum as much as much as it frustrates the hell out of us sometimes I think all of that

341
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:48,040
kind of goes into my number three just representing the Nintendo switch so let's move on to number two

342
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:54,720
but not you know number two but you know yeah mine's like no particular order kind of thing

343
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:03,600
so I'm gonna say the advent of Nintendo directs because the first one I think it was 2010 2011

344
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:11,880
2011 I believe was the first one yeah and it was also it ties into another thing about e3 losing

345
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:19,000
its relevancy Nintendo might have been the first big one to do it but a lot of companies started

346
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:24,880
abandoning e3 is their primary way of releasing information Nintendo I think really paved that

347
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:29,920
path and of course we had the the closure of Kensha Hall a lot of Indies couldn't really do

348
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:38,240
too much at e3 anymore and so we have now so many people they may have a presence at e3 but that is

349
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:43,200
not their delivery method not anymore and Nintendo was the first one I really think to make that a

350
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,760
thing I think you're absolutely right and as much as like people might go you know oh that's an

351
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:52,360
interesting selection I think I think you've nailed it is that even though Nintendo Nintendo

352
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:56,240
marches to the beat of their own drum we know that and we get frustrated as hell by it sometimes when

353
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,640
it comes to things like online and the way they roll out their retro library and things like that

354
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:04,680
but at the same time like Nintendo direct they got it right and they were ahead of the curve on that

355
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:09,960
absolutely doing it Sony skipped out on e3 Microsoft does it to an extent too yeah I mean

356
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:14,080
Microsoft may still attend e3 and see some of the value in that but Microsoft certainly does their

357
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:18,480
own conferencing and things of that nature so I think he needs to go to kitty jail mr. smoosh is

358
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:29,840
over there he has his own top three where's my debut anyway so he's he's on his way to kitty

359
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:35,920
jail don't work he's he's a nice big comfy bed in there in a small supply of food and water so he

360
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:40,000
doesn't go crazy in kitty jail but he's not out here screaming alright anyway some comments from

361
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,960
chat SGO and her Matt says the Nintendo direct scheme really changed how press conferences are

362
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:47,920
done dark to see you says I'm sure that's why Sony adopted that strategy in the last couple

363
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:53,360
of years because Nintendo had a really great idea there so and dark to see you say Microsoft does

364
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:58,720
their X 0 1 9 or whatever shows just like we had one a few weeks ago so Microsoft still may kind of

365
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,440
dip in the traditional things but they do they do a good hybrid you know they do a little bit

366
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:07,040
of Microsoft directs if you want to call them that and and traditional press things as well

367
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:15,000
yeah but I also begs the question how long is that trade show gonna last mm-hmm really it's

368
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:22,360
haven't they lost money now there's a lot of statements eulogizing e3 and I I don't know I

369
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:28,840
think it's a complicated question I'm not sure what e3 can do I think e3 kind of has to show the

370
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:36,320
value in making Los Angeles like that destination place to be for gaming that week I don't know if

371
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,040
opening up to the fans has really done that because I think they were trying to inject

372
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:44,800
fans into what is a trade show a professional show you know if you're gonna bring fans make

373
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:50,960
it a fan show you know go all-in on it you know yeah wasn't that the e4 all thing whatever happened

374
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:56,400
event the problem with e4 all is that everybody knew it was just a poor like it was the the scraps

375
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,920
left over from e3 you know no offense to anyone cuz you know I know the network we used to

376
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:05,720
participate on had participated in e4 all it was a great opportunity and all that stuff I'm not like

377
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:09,520
I don't I understand why people wanted to go and participate in it but let's be real it was the

378
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:15,080
scraps from e3 e3 was still the mega event and it was like well we'll do we'll do this little dog

379
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:22,400
and pony show too you know but now there's just gonna be the one maybe we all laugh at e4 all

380
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:30,120
which is last decade but maybe there's some things to be said in there so anyway alright so there you

381
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:36,040
go Nintendo directs and what it's kind of done to e3 let's go around to more number two is Loki

382
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:43,040
so I always think this is pretty interesting because you know we kind of grew up in arcades

383
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:48,960
and stuff and so now you see all the arcades kind of going to these giant ticket games and

384
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:56,280
it's kind of like all the classic arcade stuff is gone except now it's not because we have arcade

385
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:02,600
one up that's putting out arcade machines that people bring into their houses which is great

386
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:08,560
with like classic games and that wasn't a thing that I ever thought would happen that cheaply

387
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:15,240
let's put it that way and now it's just like all these big games you know from my childhood now

388
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:21,560
coming back where you know if I wanted to I could fill my house full of these arcade games which is

389
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:26,920
great I don't even know how to say that succinctly but you are you're you're very spot-on with that

390
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:34,400
observation that it's like arcade came home in the form of like console games and that caused

391
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,840
the arcades to kind of die off a little bit you know I'm now granted you know there was always

392
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:44,880
gonna be these big it's just nostalgia yeah but now it's like now a lot of that arcade stuff is

393
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:50,400
literally in your house now and it's very easy to come by yeah it's inexpensive like you can get

394
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:56,160
like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles machine for like two or two to four hundred dollars versus

395
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:02,680
like probably close to a thousand two thousand dollars when it originally came out I mean I

396
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,440
don't know what those machines would have cost but I can't imagine it was that price maybe it's the

397
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:11,440
same way to put it would be the growth and authenticity of collectibles yeah I think would

398
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,560
be a way to put it is that you know it's like it's like you have the real thing right it's all

399
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:20,680
this like you know classic gaming coming back because it's nostalgia a lot of people are very

400
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:26,160
nostalgic about that stuff and they want to kind of experience you know share that with their kids

401
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:32,360
and so that because you can't go there aren't any traditional or not many left traditional arcade

402
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:38,680
game arcades out there you can't just go to the mall and go to a tilter you know Aladdin's castle

403
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:44,600
or whatever it's just that's a great perspective because you know I don't have kids star soccer

404
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:49,960
doesn't have kids a lot of people listen to this show don't have kids some do you have kids and so

405
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:55,080
you're talking about how do I introduce the places I went to to my kids I can't they don't exist

406
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:59,880
anymore or they're not like they were but I can still have these cabinets and these things that

407
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:04,400
kind of show these types of games yeah because it's just not the same I mean granted like I

408
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:08,720
remember we're going to an arcade and it's quarters and it or you go to nickel city or

409
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,880
something like that you pay like five bucks to get in you pay with nickels you can like spend

410
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:18,440
like a long time there on like 20 bucks granted yes I know inflation and shit like that but

411
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:23,240
nowadays it's like every game I play and I remember like starting off with DDR it's like

412
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:28,760
it was a bucket game that was expensive you know as always the big games now it's like I want to

413
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:38,040
play a round of you know crossy roads a game that's on my cell phone or my tablet I'm playing

414
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:45,240
crossy roads on a giant screen for like literally less than a couple minutes for a buck a time a

415
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:53,440
buck a game that is ridiculous just because it spits out tickets on a related note you have to

416
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,040
see what Bobby's writing in chat right now right dark soccer cuz this is right up your alley yeah

417
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:02,400
stealing one of my thoughts oh is oh so maybe I better wait and all right all right well I was

418
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:09,640
gonna say because um well we're talking about collectibles kind of going into the home we see

419
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:18,560
pinball is kind of coming back in bars and kind of pinball arcade and the comment about get these

420
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,320
pinball machines out of my basement and they set them up in an arcade somewhere so it's almost like

421
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:28,840
pinball has had this weird rise in this decade well thanks Stern for that pretty much and the

422
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:34,880
good and I'm gonna go into this but I mean thanks to Stern we have the big old names in Bally and

423
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:42,040
Midway and even Gottlieb coming back and doing these massive tables you know I mean Steve Richie

424
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:49,920
he's done like what some of the last five really popular Stern pinballs he and then he got to do

425
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:55,160
his dream game which was Black Knight Sword of Rage so a quick follow-up something we talked

426
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:59,600
about a previous week on the stranger things pinball table is really out there now they've

427
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,840
shown like the official commercial all the official previews are out there it looks so

428
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:08,880
good that machine looks amazing so all right anyway okay so great there you go you're number

429
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:14,760
two um so my second pick I'm gonna piggyback off dark soccer a little bit because mine is

430
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:21,040
e3 related I was gonna kind of call it the rise and fall of e3 a little bit but I think the the

431
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:26,560
pinpoint note that would be definitely like the last moment when I felt we really had a moment

432
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:32,440
in e3 that was so important and so relevant and the kind of thing that e3 needs to pray comes back

433
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:38,480
would be the PlayStation press conference where they unveiled the PlayStation 4 specifically would

434
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:45,320
be that I think second biggest moment of the decade because just the way they curb stomped

435
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:53,200
my hey hey Microsoft sit and spin it was it was it was something and like I you know it was it

436
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:59,720
was a level of like competition and shade and that type of stuff that like we just hadn't seen

437
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:07,640
in a long time like it was almost petty but it wasn't like it was very much tastefully it was

438
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:14,000
tastefully petty it was Lori petty it was it was because like literally like a month or so

439
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:22,560
beforehand the most ridiculous press conference was unveiled like just such a flop it was true

440
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:29,440
shade it was shade we all know is true absolutely but you're leading into the the Microsoft thing

441
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:34,920
yeah right yeah and yeah the Microsoft event Don Mattrick kind of fell on his face so that

442
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:39,120
whole thing a little bit you know Microsoft had to kind of eat it a little bit when it came to

443
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:44,120
their message of the sport yeah yeah right the sports the TV and the mandatory Kinect and look

444
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:49,120
I understand that Microsoft has its defenders at that time and still does and I also understand

445
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:55,800
that in many ways Microsoft may have seen like a lot of things they were pitching at the time

446
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:00,200
would make a lot more sense now a lot of things they talk about with digital and that sort of

447
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:04,440
thing and maybe the concept that like you don't really own your discs anymore because everything's

448
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:09,840
digital like some of those things make a little more sense in 2019 but it just goes to show how

449
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:15,840
the gaming industry is a really unique play I don't know if this exists in the movie industry

450
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:20,320
maybe it does a little bit but the gaming industry is a very unique position of you've got to not

451
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:25,360
only make your game and make your console you got to do it at the right time and the announcement

452
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:30,320
and how you do it and the messaging is all an art form it in and of itself it really is I think

453
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:37,080
their fail was announcing it at all if you're gonna do that make it subtle make it an organic

454
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:42,280
change you know something that's gonna make sense like like I mean kind of how Nintendo's doing it

455
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:48,400
where you can get both versions of a digital and then you start seeing a phase out just saying oh

456
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,920
it's not gonna be like that anymore fuck you everybody well I also think ever since Mattrick

457
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:57,640
went out and Phil Spencer got in I think you've seen Microsoft's messaging and what they're

458
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:02,200
looking for and what I think it's changed significantly we just haven't had a new console

459
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:07,840
yet but that's gonna be a huge thing I think as we like to get into the next decade you know this

460
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:15,040
whole is cloud gaming going to really happen is what did Google maybe misfire a little bit by

461
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:19,800
launching stadia too early who but or maybe it's gonna be a huge success maybe we're gonna look

462
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:24,640
back in ten years if heaven forbid the show still going in ten years and we look back and we go oh

463
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:29,520
my god stadia was like the biggest fucking thing in gaming this whole decade they were right we

464
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:35,680
just we don't know we won't know really but as of now it seems like who maybe the stadia has launched

465
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:40,000
a little bit early but anyway I'm digressing a little bit I think we kind of already hit on the

466
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,240
rest of what I was gonna say as far as like the rise in the fall when you talked about Nintendo

467
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:48,080
Direct so I think certainly when it comes to e3 specifically I think we've seen that like it was

468
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:55,320
the must have it was the you're gonna gather in a movie theater to watch this and that that was

469
00:44:55,320 --> 00:45:00,120
that year I mean I know Sony's done it a couple of years but that was the year you wanted to be

470
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:07,280
in a movie theater and watch them publicly bully Microsoft is honestly what happened that year and

471
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:13,760
it was it was something else to I don't look at it as like a bullying more or less like a scientific

472
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:20,720
refutation it really did seem very clinical didn't it well I think the worry was that this

473
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:25,880
was kind of a calculated effort across the industry that this is the way it's gonna go

474
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:32,440
and tough luck this is you're in or you're out and the thought was okay we saw Microsoft now

475
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:37,080
it's okay digital only or you know we're not going to be sharing this or something like that

476
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:42,520
all this DRM and then the worry was okay so when you're gonna do the same thing because then that

477
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:49,440
means that like this is kind of what's this mean and it was just kind of that collective relief of

478
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:55,480
like okay thank God there's some sanity in this industry you know because of all the announcements

479
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:59,760
is that on top of the fact that the initial announcement from Microsoft is ridiculous and

480
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:08,880
so you know that just compared to the rational yeah it's just like it is normally it was such

481
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:14,080
a big announcement even though it really wasn't so to kind of summarize this and move on to the

482
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:19,880
next point I would say that this moment the PlayStation and our PlayStation 4 reveal and

483
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:25,440
what it did to Microsoft was literally the last must-see TV event out of e3 and maybe that's what

484
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,360
e3 kind of needs to get back to a little bit is a little more of those live they let you know I

485
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:34,000
realize live is a scary thing because the internet can be a harsh critics a lot of the time more than

486
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,760
it needs to be but those live moments are what really make the whole thing happen you know too

487
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:45,720
much of e3 now felt very scripted like you know the moment when I realized like this e3 is is not

488
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:50,720
what it used to be like that the moment for me was when we were standing in line to see a new

489
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:56,000
Assassin's Creed thing in a theater and we'd like had to justify to these people who we are and that

490
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,040
we had an audience and that you know you have literally empty seats in that theater and you

491
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:05,240
should let us let us go sit in them so we had to like fight to do that and then I go back to the

492
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:09,160
hotel later that night and the entire thing we saw in the theater was up on YouTube and I was

493
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:16,240
like fuck this like what are we doing like you know so that was yeah but that was all canned

494
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:22,520
that was a canned message it was up on YouTube as well and everything so anyway um now I would say

495
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:26,720
also um because Bobby is mentioning in chat one of the other things interesting things about that

496
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,960
PlayStation event is that they also announced at that event that they were gonna start charging

497
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,760
for online play but nobody cared that's a very good point they announced all this good news good

498
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,680
news good news then they snuck in there oh and PlayStation Plus is now how you're gonna be able

499
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:43,760
to play your games online nobody cared nobody cared because everybody kind of saw it coming

500
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,920
so to have all this good news and then that everybody just kind of overlooked it so it was

501
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:52,960
very very interesting I think in a way all right anyway let's move on I think some honorable

502
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:57,120
mentions before we get to the big number once so and please realize somebody else's honorable

503
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:01,160
mention might be your number one so we won't elaborate on these too much but let's talk about

504
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:07,520
some honorable mentions dark soccer the thing is my honorable mention in my quote number one

505
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:12,800
honestly I'll switch him out because I have one the one I mentioned was the one I was gonna do

506
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:17,480
as my number one so I'm just gonna go ahead and fucking say it because it's kind of equal for me

507
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:24,840
but the whole retro revival you know barcades being a thing having pinball come back again

508
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:32,720
thanks to companies like like Stern and Jersey Jack and the one I can't think of off the top of

509
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:38,520
my head that's doing pinballs again but we you know like I said that's been a big thing and also

510
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:44,080
that goes in with the classic consoles being revived as well like the mini versions we've

511
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:50,120
had an NES SNES there's gonna be Nintendo 64 there's gonna be turbo graphics slash PC engine

512
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:58,800
the Genesis classic Sony did one I mean fuck if Sega did a Saturn I'd just go dance around for

513
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:05,240
a while please take a little dreamcast please but I mean all of that that whole revival of

514
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:10,240
it's going into you know there's indie games again where we're seeing our retro style like

515
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:17,400
I mean shovel knight is a full 3d game that plays like a pixelated 2d old-school really good game

516
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:22,880
you know we're seeing a lot of this revival I mean they've tried to update these and they just

517
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:28,000
realized that doing it the old-school way is the best so I really tie all that in together we're

518
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:33,880
having a nostalgia that has manifested itself you know what's interesting and I'm kind of grinning

519
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:38,160
over here because as you're talking about it I'm reminded of another artistic industry where like

520
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:44,160
retro revivals are very important and crucial to the industry fashion fashion exactly right

521
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:51,080
this retro revival is a huge fashion thing right but gaming gaming I just like that I can shop at

522
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:55,440
the thrift store again yeah gaming hasn't really been around long enough quote-unquote to have had

523
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,800
a retro revival I think in the way that we've seen it happen in this past decade you know especially

524
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:03,920
with the NES classics selling out like that and you know the Super Nintendo classics and you know

525
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:09,920
sure we had retro stuff we had Atari collections on PlayStation in the last decade things like that

526
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,540
but I don't think we saw it at the level that we've really seen it in this past decade you know

527
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:17,320
they've got those home sets now that looks like what that Commodore 64 one that looks like the

528
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:21,480
big keyboard it really isn't a working keyboard by the way did you notice that we have the new

529
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:26,560
decoration up yes yeah if you it's if it's hard to see on camera and I can see that it probably

530
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:30,280
would be a little bit hard to see on the camera it is an actual like copy of the patent for the

531
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:36,080
Commodore 64 which y'all know is near and dear to my heart so um the moment I saw that I knew I

532
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:42,640
had to get it but I mean but we were seeing a lot more of that you know and it's not just oh get off

533
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:51,760
my lawn you know all of us people not to say we're old or anything but I'm seeing especially and I'm

534
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:57,080
even gonna tie in speed running to this because we got a lot of really young people speed running

535
00:50:57,080 --> 00:51:02,760
classic games and that I think is also tying into the whole retro revival too because they're

536
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:08,400
finding you I like how you work that in there to play old things and my number one is gonna be

537
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:12,400
tying back to that so oh god I thought that was your number one okay it was supposed to be my

538
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:16,480
number one okay well I was gonna tie this together but I'm gonna go ahead and separate them okay

539
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:21,240
because it got mentioned already so I just figured I'd say it no I like that um as that

540
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:25,960
wants to point out not just fashion when it comes to retro to revival interior design yeah

541
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:29,760
textile that's a good people are really going actually back to that mid-century but I've seen

542
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:38,400
a and not to be stereotypical I've mostly seen it amongst my older gay male friends their houses

543
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:44,840
are decorated like the 1960s and I'm living for it and I love it and on top of that just for

544
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:52,560
me can I can we get one of them to decorate our place like a dorm room but oh but the other thing

545
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:59,520
too is that I've also been seeing amongst like straight white girls going for like a semi

546
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:06,400
Victorian slash 40s era aesthetic and it's been just kind of this interesting thing how we are

547
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:11,280
getting the retro aesthetic but it's in certain demographics you know what I mean so I'm only

548
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:15,240
laughing because this recent chat comment here and I'm like if you just want to sum up the last

549
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:20,340
decade of olr here it is in this chat comment from slag kick shout out to game buoy and stream

550
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:26,100
parks Allah who says yay I tuned in just to hear dark soccer talk about old gay men's kitschy

551
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:32,460
houses there put it put that quote on the back of the box and you know I'm right you know I'm

552
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:37,820
right all right but also the retro fashion thing like I was saying I can actually go and buy

553
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:42,460
flannels and jean skirts at the thrift store and dress like I did in high school okay and it's

554
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:48,500
fashionable honorable mentions before we get to number ones the fall of print gaming magazines

555
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:53,940
Nintendo power game Pro I think there was an official PlayStation magazine or something

556
00:52:53,940 --> 00:53:02,020
that all ended in this decade early this decade um honorable mention for me would be probably the

557
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:08,980
accessibility of game creators on social media for better or for worse now I know this isn't unique to

558
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:15,060
2010 and this decade because Twitter technically was around what 2006 2007 but I think we've seen

559
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:21,140
especially when it comes to fans making demands for better and for worse unfortunately this wasn't

560
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:25,980
always a good thing and I think that's why I didn't want to put it in my top three but I think the

561
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:32,300
accessibility of gaming creators on social media has been a huge part of this decade I think it's

562
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:40,500
you know I think it's caused some people to listen to some things for good things sometimes and but

563
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:44,980
not always so I'll just kind of leave it at that and let you draw your own conclusions so all right

564
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:51,020
that in with me making friends with voice actors and motion-capped actors online because we there's

565
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:56,140
good news too there's good I'm basically Facebook friends now with like with the well who we've had

566
00:53:56,140 --> 00:54:03,700
on the show Greg Berger he's such a nice guy oh sure and having chats on Twitter with Lady Bunny

567
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:12,020
I mean mostly with Lady Bunny lately but you know um a lot of the people are like have their own you

568
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:16,460
know instagrams and everything which leaves me then to my number one let's do it so here we go

569
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:21,020
you'll in your opinion and you are neither right nor wrong no you're right because it's your opinion

570
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:28,340
but you're not wrong you what you believe was the biggest gaming news of the decade number one truly

571
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:36,180
lead out with the the whole online gaming and streaming becoming gaming celebrities people who

572
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:42,980
would have been absolutely reviled when we were in middle school now doing this as their livelihood

573
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:51,060
and not just that I'm getting motion capture and voice actors doing streamings of the games that

574
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:57,180
they were in one of the ones I've been following is Brian Deschart who played one of the main

575
00:54:57,180 --> 00:55:04,780
characters in Detroit become human and his wife who played one of the Tracy androids in the game

576
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:11,820
I've been watching them stream games sometimes in costume you know having our our video game

577
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:17,460
actors cosplaying like the group did for Mass Effect right you know I think that that's

578
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:23,500
absolutely fun and then you get to also you know sometimes you'll have them show up while other

579
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:28,100
people are streaming things and you get all the tie-ins and are and it goes back to what you're

580
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:35,540
saying our games are becoming and the people in them are becoming accessible it's not just oh you

581
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:39,740
see some names flashing on the screen in the credits you meet these people these are real

582
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:45,340
people and it becomes real to you and you see the work that they put into these games and then you

583
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:51,260
see people making it their livelihood it's just like our our gaming world has become highly

584
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:56,940
interactive and contrast that with the 80s when game makers were struggling to get credited

585
00:55:56,940 --> 00:56:02,380
remember that's how Activision sneak him in that's how Activision became a thing was because

586
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:09,420
Activision was willing to release David Crane's pitfall whereas Atari never credited Howard Scott

587
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:14,300
Warshaw for creating NARS revenge or et for that matter I just need to get into the we all know

588
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:19,260
that wasn't as an easter egg on the credits yeah and as the credits but in the game code so you're

589
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:25,740
it's come a long way it is very different now that's yeah I like that so okay so how do we

590
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:34,460
succinctly put that number one is just the ability to access game creators who are playing their

591
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:40,500
games and streaming their games I'd say the interactivity of gaming culture okay it's gonna

592
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:44,380
be very yeah we're gonna we're gonna hear something very similar in a minute let's hear what

593
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:51,540
Loki is for number one we'll do eSports because eSports is just blown up since the early I mean

594
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:58,020
obviously eSports were around prior to 2010 but it's really blown up in the last 10 years so that's

595
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:05,700
definitely gonna be you know my pick I definitely given to the rise of such games like fortnight's

596
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:15,900
overwatch illegal legends dota counter-strike I mean there's just a lot of games that even

597
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:22,500
accessibility wise you know with modern PC is a lot of them don't need a really powerful PC to

598
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:28,860
run on and so you just have a lot of people getting into it and starting to recognize a lot

599
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:34,580
of these teams that are being formed there's official leagues now for games and with their

600
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:43,080
own you know setups in actual sports arenas and so it's very much becoming like you know the

601
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:49,440
physical sports genres the fact that you can plop down in front of the television and watch a League

602
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:54,560
of Legends match watch an overwatch match you might not necessarily do it on traditional TV

603
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:59,920
although certainly you can we do know traditional TV well nowadays you can because you're well I

604
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:06,080
mean it's not necessarily tuning in but smart TVs oh yeah twitch or mixer or what have you yeah yeah

605
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:11,720
so interesting all right now I love it eSports number one the rise of eSports I think we'll be

606
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:15,400
looking back at the end of the next decade and going you know what Overwatch League was kind of

607
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:20,360
the start of something huge I really do so and that may not necessarily just be overwatch but

608
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:24,560
it may be you know that was the first like big sports teams you know all that stuff it'll be

609
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:27,960
interesting to look back on that in ten years time yeah well I think you're gonna find that

610
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:32,960
all three of our number ones have a big common theme in common so I think we're on to something

611
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:38,720
here because my number one biggest gaming news of the decade would be the share button that's my

612
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:45,680
number one not specifically the PlayStation 4 share button although if you want to icon eyes

613
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:51,480
it was something I suppose that would work but I think that just would be the ease of being able

614
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:57,760
to share your gameplay with other people and the share these big professional whether it be these

615
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:02,920
big professional eSports matches whether it be celebrities and game makers reaching out to their

616
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:07,680
fans and celebrating the things that they've created or you know what a bunch of schmoes

617
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:15,560
in their spare room talking about video games for people willing to tune up but I know we've been

618
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:23,480
doing this show a long time right we've been doing this show for over 17 years and so I think we've

619
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:32,040
kind of is that for repo no no I thought you're saying it was a Cinderella song okay from the

620
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:40,920
80s but I think just the fact that it's so easy to what we were we were doing this early on

621
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:44,960
especially we start a podcast we were very much about trying to get the message you should apply

622
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:49,120
everybody should podcast we should get more voices out there we don't remember how especially the

623
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:53,440
early days of it was winger thanks Bobby okay remember the early days of podcasting we were

624
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:58,240
like we don't compete with other podcasts like because there were some podcasters out there that

625
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:03,960
want to make it a competition and sometimes there's a few still but for the most part it's

626
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:07,760
it's not a competition it really shouldn't be a competition it should be about trying to get

627
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:14,440
everybody's voices out there and getting everybody heard and people having the ability to say their

628
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:20,920
opinion because gaming is for everyone and so the fact that everybody can share and you can go join

629
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:26,640
whoever's couch you want and watch them play a game or watch them talk about a game or about

630
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:31,200
gaming culture what have you designing costumes and influenced by games what have you I think

631
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:36,320
has been the biggest thing about this decade and if you go back to last decade I would have said

632
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:40,760
my number one gaming story from the last decade was the advent of Xbox Live bringing gamers

633
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:46,240
together over the internet and now we go to this decade and it's about I think now kind of taking

634
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:53,280
that one step further bringing strangers together over the internet into communities and like

635
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:57,760
everybody's got their own community whether it be you know small tighten it and that's cool or or

636
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:03,760
gigantic you know ninja type of you know communities it's all of that so what would you

637
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:10,760
say then your disappointment is of the decade oh my biggest disappointment of the decade well I

638
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:17,040
wasn't ready to talk about that you're going off script let's see my biggest gaming disappointment

639
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:27,280
of the decade I have a couple I know it's easy I think um I think Kickstarter yeah I think I

640
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:31,440
honestly that's the thing that goes to now not everything on Kickstarter has been a disaster

641
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:35,640
you know I've kick-started some things such as like ant stream and so forth that have I think

642
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:41,400
used Kickstarter very well but I think we've seen too many things use Kickstarter poorly I think we

643
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:47,480
saw like just this rush of stuff going to Kickstarter really fast that and then people

644
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:52,200
that didn't turn around the things that they were promising money for and I think people had in their

645
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:57,200
mind something different so I'm not saying the news was always bad with Kickstarter but unfortunately

646
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:03,600
I think we found that there's more sad face stories than good face stories so Bobby did make

647
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:07,360
an honorable mention for my disappointment of the year and that's having to do Halo is a classic

648
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:13,320
game but you did it for charity it was I did it for my mother and charity all of you especially

649
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:21,400
someone donated 200 bucks thank you for keeping my mother fed and housed and now she has a job

650
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:29,120
she can afford to live and I my mom cried on the phone thanks to you guys so that's another way

651
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:35,360
that our our culture has become interactive is the fact that I did GoFundMe for that you were

652
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:38,680
mentioning Kickstarter which Kickstarter also is super disappointed me because they're anti

653
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:46,640
unionizing but I mean y'all y'all really came through to help out my mom and I appreciate it

654
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:53,760
least I could do was do but I have a couple of disappointments one of them is that we're still

655
01:02:53,760 --> 01:03:00,960
talking about violence video games like it's thing oh like the way the mass media or mainstream media

656
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:06,200
I don't know what it's called a blamed video games after Sandy Hook yep yep they blame everything

657
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:12,240
except the fucking problem you're looking for a scapegoat instead of looking at the companies

658
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:18,480
that are lining your fucking pockets the NRA is a terrorist organization leave it at that that's a

659
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:24,560
the that whole scapegoating of video games is a great call-out for disappointments of the decade

660
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:34,120
absolutely my other ones Bioware where Bioware is now Loki well a tie-in with where Bioware is

661
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:42,000
now I would say the monetization of modern video games by somebody was gonna say this because if

662
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,720
you want to talk about how companies are ruining the industries you can just look at all the loot

663
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:53,040
boxes and the constant double dipping monetization you know taking stuff out of games that was just

664
01:03:53,040 --> 01:03:57,560
commonplace like cheat codes and stuff like that and selling them back to you or taking content

665
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:02,360
out of games that you know in the previous version it was included with it now it's part of a season

666
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:07,560
pass just all the different things that you know they're they're like well we're not raising the

667
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:11,160
price of games but at the same time they're selling you a $50 season pass they're selling

668
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:20,160
you costumes that got like for example my son wanted a he wanted V bucks for fortnight $25

669
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:26,840
where the V bucks you know what he bought with V bucks he bought one costume one costume was like

670
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:32,200
20 bucks in the game granted I know it's a free-to-play game but still you have like

671
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:38,960
Activision stuff selling skins and stuff like that and Call of Duty for near the same price

672
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:43,880
in a $60 game that you just bought a season pass for that you're also paying for the special

673
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:49,680
edition and all this other shit and then they come back out with the neck you know next year

674
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:55,360
it's oh hey look at this it's a new version gotta buy all that shit again because we have to sell

675
01:04:55,360 --> 01:05:02,160
you that red dot scope for you another $10 or whatever at least fortnight just constantly you

676
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:08,200
know everything goes with you on top of that you have this I mean really it goes not to beat a

677
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:13,600
political socio-economic dead horse but it all goes back to capitalism and the fact that not

678
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:20,000
only are they basically draining society for all of this money that's also now while we have the

679
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,320
gaming addiction pop in and people are spending their money on this like they're gambling but we

680
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:28,040
also do have the way that these companies are treating their employees at the expense of their

681
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:34,040
user base and their employees mental and physical health and they're also dodging taxes and their

682
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:39,880
CEOs are getting paid millions of million dollars they're laying off thousands of people I mean it's

683
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:46,920
just it's like any other big company nowadays but and the moment they try to unionize the companies

684
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:55,480
are are stabbing down we've needed a video game lobby and Union for a long time the tech industry

685
01:05:55,480 --> 01:06:00,680
needs unions but we just had that issue with Google where they were firing people for creating a way

686
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:06,720
for their employees to unionize I'm getting way off topic with this but I eat like this all sparked

687
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:10,440
in my head this whole discussion because I was literally having a conversation with Bobby earlier

688
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:17,360
today about a B's a b5 here in California which is the whole it's very it's a very controversial law

689
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:20,600
and I think it was kind of targeting the uber and lyft thing but it's kind of having these

690
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:25,440
ramifications because I actually had to go to Bobby and ask are we it just is a b5 gonna screw

691
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:31,840
us because olr produces more than 35 episodes in a year in California does that make us employees

692
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:36,680
because if so we're done because this we don't make money doing that you guys know that I mean

693
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:40,200
you guys are very kind with your biddies but you guys know that that basically pays the cost of

694
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,960
running a business and things behind the scene we don't we don't make money so we can't pay for

695
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:48,920
things like workers comp and you know the things that I think isn't it for businesses over certain

696
01:06:48,920 --> 01:06:56,160
it are for contractors no it has to meet an ABC test so for vog specifically I think it we fail

697
01:06:56,160 --> 01:07:01,840
criteria a because vog does not mean I'm getting a little under the hood here but vog does not

698
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:06,760
mandate the content that's created you all have the right to not show up for work and nothing

699
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:11,600
happens you all have because it's not work exactly so and we can talk we have the freedom to talk

700
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:17,800
about whatever we want so if I think for that reason it's not a registered business it is it

701
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:24,400
isn't in Georgia yeah so but we're not a Californian business so but we if you have California

702
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:29,920
contractors which exactly I would say we're none of those things yeah we don't have a contract

703
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:35,720
sign so I don't think that really yeah so anyway but the reason why I bring that up I'm not trying

704
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:41,720
to make it about us I'm trying to make it about these contractors that make games and work for

705
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:45,880
things like Google and stuff this is gonna be an interest this law is gonna have an interesting

706
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:52,080
kind of but I know a lot of my artist friends are freaking out because it's gonna cause jobs to go

707
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:57,320
outside California because people don't want to hire like musicians that make you know little

708
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:03,120
compositions here and there can't can't do more than 35 of them for a single company and that could

709
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:07,680
be damning so I think the laws I think gonna get tweaked a little bit before we really see its

710
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:14,520
final form but it's interesting so anyway sorry I completely derailed a little bit but it was it

711
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:22,160
was the whole loot box conversation but yeah you know as season passes you know whatever you want

712
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:28,120
to say there it's just other ways that they're trying to monetize games because they're saying

713
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:32,960
they're not making enough money because like you look at it this way so say you have you know

714
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:38,520
everybody that buys Call of Duty one year you know it's gonna buy the game the next year and say they

715
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:44,760
they keep okay so if everybody buys Call of Duty one year and then buys it the next year they're

716
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:48,720
making the same out profit their profits aren't going up they need to find more ways to make more

717
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:54,840
money well the problem is like that it's gonna keep going up and eventually people only have

718
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:59,520
finite amount of money they're not gonna be able to spend you know as much as you want them to

719
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:06,960
spend so it's just it's not sustainable all right I'm psychic and chat saying I think my biggest I

720
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:12,260
I'll get to you oh is he you want to read this yeah both of us because Bobby actually makes a

721
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:16,280
better another point that ties into it so you go first I'll go first with psychic I think my

722
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:20,640
biggest gaming disappointment of the decade is toxic gamer behavior not that it's new to this

723
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:25,680
decade but we've really seen a boil over this decade and Bobby brings it out the the gamer

724
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:30,360
that the behavior was always there we just didn't see it to social media and that also ties back

725
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:36,880
into having that interactivity with gamer culture you also get the the CD underbelly as well well I

726
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:41,000
think going back to the whole concept of the share button and again I don't literally mean PlayStation

727
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:45,160
4 share button but you know you guys know what I mean the the ease of sharing your your gameplay

728
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:51,720
it's caught it's it's made the ability to make an echo chamber really really easy people don't

729
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:56,120
want to learn yeah people want that confirmation bias so I mean that's why we now have a major

730
01:09:56,120 --> 01:10:01,840
problem with in cells with their you know rise of hate groups again because they have this little

731
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:07,400
pocket in the current administration honestly enough makes it easy for them all right let's

732
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:12,000
move on I want to talk about now we've talked about gaming news of the decade I want to talk

733
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,240
about games of the decade this is here I thought we'd have a short show tonight but the single

734
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:19,920
topic is taking up a good chunk of it that's good because the news we have to get through is quick

735
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:27,080
so let's talk about the top three games of the decade and I know we're gonna have overlap here

736
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:31,520
I'm gonna I'm trying to think I'm gonna like start with least I want to almost I almost want

737
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:35,840
to like write down listen three I think dark soccer is gonna pick in the three I think Loki's

738
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:40,560
gonna pick but let's see let's see if I'm right I'll be honest and let you know if I I would guess

739
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:45,000
that or not we'll do three two one just like we did before so let's go around our soccer your

740
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:58,480
number three game of the decade now I've got a tie here I'm gonna say portal to I would have

741
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:01,680
guessed that would show up I'm only gonna pick games that I personally have played a significant

742
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:07,240
amount of yes and and to be clear these are our personal games of the decade we're not wrong

743
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:11,680
because there are personal games of the decade the thing is I have four I cannot pick it's hard

744
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:15,040
another one well we'll give you a spot for no we're doing two three two one you don't need to

745
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:23,000
pick another one one can be an honorable mention okay so portal two is number three and why oh just

746
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:28,640
because it was really fun I mean the whole portal series honestly was really great but portal two

747
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:34,040
took all the fun in portal and then really just like oh we know we know what jokes you like we're

748
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:38,400
gonna make it even better and you have the interactivity you have a lot more history behind

749
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:44,640
you know Aperture Science and you've got the old style labs and the propulsion gel it was so much

750
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:50,640
fun and the dialogue was so hilarious plus I also like to to go behind the scenes and break things

751
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:55,760
in it so I just found it to be super fun it was one of the ones I was the most excited for and

752
01:11:55,760 --> 01:12:02,840
one of the ones I have played on repeat many times so okay there it is number three portal

753
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:11,880
to Loki I'm gonna go to you what was your number three best game of the decade um well this would

754
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:17,120
these are all based on like the amount of fun that I had with them so let's see I'm gonna start with

755
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:31,440
I guess it would yes it's a toss-up between I would have to say ingress just because I you

756
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:36,880
know kind of that got me into the whole AR gaming stuff and so good flying because that isn't even

757
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:42,000
on my list and you know how much I play that game yes so like I I would think because you know it

758
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:48,880
not now so much but like before we're looking at the decade yeah so ingress paved the way

759
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:55,160
for more yeah so like I did play that pretty heavily for a while and you know it was a lot

760
01:12:55,160 --> 01:13:01,320
of fun met a lot of people doing that and you know kind of snowball off into like you know

761
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:08,080
Pokemon go and stuff like that but yeah so I'd say it was definitely a unique game for its time

762
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:16,560
and yeah so that's okay um I mean it's a if I were to look at like games I played the most

763
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:20,400
that would definitely be up there especially yesterday I know we haven't gotten into our

764
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:23,960
gaming weeks yet but I played a lot of English so I played so much ingress yesterday that I

765
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:28,760
actually said and I said to my chat group I said I am I am off the clock today for anger I'm not

766
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:32,920
playing ingress today so if they field over the neighborhood somebody else needs to handle it

767
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:39,000
because I am burned out after yesterday but I mean games are fun right yeah but I agree with

768
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:46,280
you there's been so many like social elements of it that have bettered my life so you know yeah

769
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:52,000
but I'm also trying to when I pick my top three I'm trying to be like half selfish half like

770
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:58,560
judging the impact and artistic vision so for that reason ingress prime is kind of yeah so I

771
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:02,080
there's some things where I'm like I didn't put on my top three for that reason but I get it I

772
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:08,200
get what you're saying so what did I put on my top three I put as my number three game and I

773
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:12,560
know there's gonna be over half a lap here so I apologize in advance I just know it like I I would

774
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:20,960
like just I I'm gonna quit the show if there's not overlapping but Jamie's laughing she knows

775
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:26,800
what I'm about to say my number three pick would be Mass Effect 3 for one of my games of the day

776
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:33,800
is there a little overlap there yeah although we'll get to it we'll get to it we'll hold on

777
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:38,120
that one so my number three pick is Mass Effect 3 and the reason why I'm saying Mass Effect 3 I'm

778
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:44,800
not saying Mass Effect 2 I did decide to pick 3 specifically because I made a lot of memories

779
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:50,800
with the multiplayer mode in that game for me that was what got me to play multiplayer for sure I

780
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:55,160
mean I think that multiplayer was really like underestimated by a lot of the gaming public

781
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:59,920
because we had that whole hubba blue about the ending and everything that was going on with that

782
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:04,960
which is is actually is another reason I kind of put it on my games of the decade list I think

783
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:10,640
Mass Effect 3 and that fan reaction for better for worse I I still think to this day it was a

784
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:17,480
much bigger to do than it needed to be but I'm glad they did a free DLC that just expanded on

785
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:23,480
it I mean I even if I don't necessarily like the how we got there I'm more than satisfied with the

786
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:29,800
end product it was the game that had me running a blog for five years with 10,000 followers yeah

787
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:38,280
mass effecting tumblr.com and yeah I mean is that in chat says Citadel DLC total fan service

788
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:44,800
absolutely like I love the Citadel's DLC us like that one more one more for the road did you notice

789
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:51,240
that the the apartment complex was called Tiberius towers no I never noticed that that's funny well

790
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:59,200
you know with a reference there James Tiberius Kirk yeah so yeah so I would say yeah Mass Effect

791
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:05,000
3 just um the story was so important and the multiplayer especially in three just I think put

792
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:12,040
it I realize why people prefer to sometimes but I think just that yeah I just love the multiplayer

793
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:16,200
kind of puts three above two for me so there you go that's my number three game of the decade so

794
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:21,960
Dark Soccer what's your number two to game of the decade Dragon Age Inquisition I played a shitload

795
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:28,280
of Dragon Age Inquisition and I really love Dragon Age 2 and I really love the first Dragon Age but

796
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:36,360
Inquisition it I will Mass Effect got me into modding but Inquisition was where I went nuts

797
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:45,800
like even like doing a little bit of like personal modding to it myself the story was great it it

798
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:50,400
took characters that I wanted to see more of and really brought them into the light it played a lot

799
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:56,480
more on what I had expected about the whole you know the Dalish don't have the whole story because

800
01:16:56,480 --> 01:17:05,520
it's a lot like religion today people don't know they weren't there it really I liked it too because

801
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:11,680
it seemed to me almost like the start I was seeing some historical corollaries to it like the

802
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:19,400
beginning of the Reformation for example and how they're the the mages were rebelling against their

803
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:24,480
circles and things like it was a lot more to that I really liked the commentary in it I really loved

804
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:29,880
the characters I just was completely enamored with the whole game and it almost was my number

805
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:37,200
one it almost truly was my number one and I every so often I get there to go back and play it if my

806
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:44,920
computer would ever fucking not shut down on me you need to fix my RAM all right I'm not not

807
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:49,800
totally surprised by that pick in my head it wasn't on the top three I'd written for you but

808
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:53,240
now that you said it I'm like oh yeah of course she's gonna put Dragon Age in my vision up there

809
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:58,240
of course so all right I know a lot of people a lot of people love the Dragon Age so I'm not

810
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:03,040
surprised to hear that Loki you're number two my number two pick is gonna be the Elder Scrolls

811
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:10,400
5 Skyrim yeah that would have been on my top three for you because of mods because I have played that

812
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:16,200
game so much so many times I've I don't even know how many hours I spent in that game and I would

813
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:23,680
still go back and play that game again because it's a great game and I really like I'm hoping

814
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:31,720
that the next game is just as good I mean really it was it's it was such a great game and yeah I

815
01:18:31,880 --> 01:18:40,800
mean it I don't know I bought it so many times who knows that game in many ways has lasted longer

816
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:46,040
than almost any other game this decade you know like they just put that out on the switch like

817
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:49,960
what was that like two years ago like if that yeah like maybe maybe it was just last year actually

818
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:55,000
they put that on the switch I mean that game had an that game had the life cycle of what a console

819
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:59,560
would have usually pretty much yeah I mean and yeah they're obviously the rain joke is that they

820
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:04,480
put it on everything but like it's a great game and so I I don't have a problem with them doing

821
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:12,040
that actually but yeah so that that's definitely gonna be my pick all right so my number two pick

822
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:17,920
for game of the decade I think is going to be both surprising and not surprising at all because I

823
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:23,280
think when we look back on the games that really defined and made this decade you are not gonna

824
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:26,680
find a list that doesn't have Pokemon go on it and that's my number two game of the decade is

825
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:35,960
Pokemon go there was nothing like that first month that Pokemon go was out it was transformative in

826
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:42,760
culture it the fact that people were swarming places like old town which was struggling to

827
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:52,800
get business and Pokemon go was helping the local economy that's how big this fucking game was now

828
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:58,960
I realize it's not what it was then but the fact that it's still going pretty darn strongly and

829
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:04,440
making as much money as it is three years after the fact I think still does leave lead something

830
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:14,120
to be said but I just I think Pokemon go finally made mobile gaming really cool it really brought

831
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:20,120
an experience and yes I know in believe me I know Ingress laid the groundwork for all of this but

832
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:26,040
Pokemon put that Mickey Mouse-esque face on it which obviously is Pikachu is what I really mean

833
01:20:26,040 --> 01:20:31,280
here but it put that real mascot and it put that you know made more people kind of want to jump in

834
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:37,680
and experience it for themselves and you know it was I would see these tweets that would be like I

835
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:44,960
got to say for the first time ever mom I'm leaving the house and I'm going to catch Pokemon I am

836
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:50,440
living my childhood dream right now do that with Dan hey I'm going out to do pokey Manning exactly

837
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:58,040
and Harry Potter Pokemon go made that a reality and that's something that we had never experienced

838
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:05,520
in games but now that door is kind of open and that AR gaming space has been blown open even

839
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:11,680
more so and so forth and I just I just think in many many ways like no game has been as

840
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:17,120
transformative I know it's interesting I'm not saying this as my number one paper it'll make

841
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:23,400
sense when I tell you my number one that I don't think any game is is gonna have that kind of impact

842
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:31,080
in some ways I think permanently on gaming culture as Pokemon go is had honestly so yeah that's that's

843
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:37,120
it that's my pick I'm sticking to it Pokemon go my number two game of the decade um so honorable

844
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:40,840
mansions before number one if you want to say all right now I'm gonna tell people why I'm not picking

845
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:45,560
Breath of the Wild because I actually did not play it Dan played it I was his navigator and I'm only

846
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:51,440
picking stuff that I played so as much as I love Breath of the Wild and trust me I love it I didn't

847
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:58,480
play it so I'm not picking it there's oh go ahead that's I'm saying why I'm not mentioning it as my

848
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:02,240
honorable mention but you had a comment oh no I thought you're oh I thought that was your honorable

849
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:09,640
mention okay sorry my my own rule but odd that the danganronpa fucking love danganronpa it's

850
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:17,360
just a mindfuck of a game I love danganronpa too don't get me wrong I was really into the anime

851
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:25,160
though I was so hooked on just what began with the first game and it's aesthetic it was just I

852
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:30,160
mean it was a really great game really engaging I really got into the characters I really cared

853
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:36,440
about what happened to them except for the otaku guy who was voiced by Rama's voice actor I can't

854
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:41,440
always forget his name like he's a manga artist in the game anyway but I really like that it also

855
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:46,880
played up on all these stereotypes and everything in various Japanese genre you know and but

856
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:53,120
otherwise it was just it was great storytelling it really brought I think spike Chunsoft a lot

857
01:22:53,120 --> 01:23:00,720
more into the eye of Western audiences and really I can't say good enough about it I love danganronpa

858
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:10,160
there you go great any honorable mentions from you lucky yeah I had a few so like I was I'd had

859
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:14,760
to say probably like call of duty my warfare 3 because I had a lot of fun that my co-workers

860
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:23,920
Super Mario Odyssey was another one that I you know thought was pretty good Grand Theft Auto 5

861
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:30,040
almost was my number one just because I I I would have bet that was your number one you know why

862
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:36,480
here's why cuz like I love Grand Theft Auto but I had so much more fun with Grand Theft Auto 4 than

863
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:42,360
5 because I I would still be playing for if it had in the mod if I could get my mods to be working

864
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:48,800
I could play my coworkers I'd still be playing for but 5 I just got lost interest with it cuz

865
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:53,600
they didn't add any expansions to it or then they have online but I just didn't really care for

866
01:23:53,800 --> 01:24:02,600
online too much so that's why 5 that was not really my number one it might be tied and I

867
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:12,120
don't know it's pretty good but and then of course I you know I think Saints Row third or and I would

868
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:17,600
say maybe like Saints Row 4 in there somewhere but God I'm so curious what number one is so

869
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:25,600
yeah so that's it all right well maybe I'll knock some surprising ones out for you here so my

870
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:30,200
honorable mentions would include Final Fantasy 14 around reborn would definitely be an honorable

871
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:36,320
mention up there really hard not to put that on my top three but just I think the three games I

872
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:40,080
picked kind of represent all something very different but you can't like we're gonna look

873
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:43,960
back on this decade and look at things and I think collectively with Final Fantasy 14 realm

874
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:50,320
I'm gonna include with that Diablo 3 No Man's Sky and these games that have really reinvented

875
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:54,840
themselves after a launch that didn't maybe necessarily go the way that was planned which

876
01:24:54,840 --> 01:25:00,240
maybe is why I didn't totally feel like I should put it in my top three but I obviously I love what

877
01:25:00,240 --> 01:25:04,760
Final Fantasy 14 has become and so obviously it's very worthy of an honorable mention other games I

878
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:13,400
would put in there Zelda Breath of the Wild Super Mario maker absolutely I feel like dreams will

879
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:17,840
join this list but it's too soon I don't know what decade we're gonna get to put that in next

880
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:22,600
so I guess maybe well it's coming out next in February what year was little big planet

881
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:28,800
released that was is nine thousand something because I saw a little bit bent plan to talk

882
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:34,360
in okay then I would say a little bit planet three well you know horrible mention you know

883
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:38,960
I haven't some played it how about how about the force or how about Forza Horizon 3 it's not

884
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:46,520
absolutely and yeah I think those are those are some of my games and I forgot to mention

885
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:56,360
also to until dawn rush of blood because that's one of my favorite VR games I would say also I

886
01:25:56,360 --> 01:26:00,600
think I need to say an honorable mention Beat Saber I think you get an honorable mention as

887
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:06,280
well I think and for what it's doing for VR gaming even if you know maybe VR gaming still

888
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:10,920
hasn't kind of got that big inertia to go like really forward I think Beat Saber is definitely

889
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:16,720
like like it's starting to you know it's it's getting noticed you know what I mean it's causing

890
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:21,680
to be our thing to get noticed another honorable mention what's that Bayonetta was painted at this

891
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:27,320
time was it I thought they had a two definitely was yeah why am I not thinking that Bayonetta

892
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:31,760
was this decade I know sometimes it's hard to remember exactly what your things are released

893
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:41,400
in so yeah I was in Japan October 2009 and North American Europe January 2010 so technically make

894
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:50,440
Wow okay all right so it counts because we didn't get it until yeah that's fair yeah okay let's do

895
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:55,520
number ones I'm so he'd like a lot well I I'm pretty sure I know Dark Soccer's but I'm super

896
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:59,360
curious but I want to hear her talk about it because I know she loves loves this more than

897
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:05,360
anything so Dark Soccer your number one pick for game of the decade Mass Effect 3 and the big

898
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:17,160
reason is that not only did I you know I thought it was a great game I thought that I really it's

899
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:24,560
really hard for me to put into it cuz it really got me into like the the kind of what's the word

900
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:30,160
I'm thinking of like the the playing a game for the characters for the romance element for the

901
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:35,160
story behind it not necessarily I mean it even had a story mode in it where you could skip the

902
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:39,320
combat and just do the story stuff but don't play it that way no you do miss some stuff that happens

903
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:42,920
during the combat that you want to see and you do also miss like really good items just saying

904
01:27:42,920 --> 01:27:51,160
you know um and also on a personal note it really got me I guess my a little bit more internet

905
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:57,040
notoriety because I had Mass Effect and I still get messages from people asking me to bring it

906
01:27:57,040 --> 01:28:04,600
back and I'm like dude I have no content I have literally recycled the same comments over okay

907
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:13,560
my blog has its own alternate universe in it now where Shepard can't drive shit and she has comments

908
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:20,160
about Garris being a smartass Turian all the time and like just different things that are like not

909
01:28:20,200 --> 01:28:26,640
even it's more like headcanon verse it's just so crazy you know you ask somebody and I even like I

910
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:30,880
don't even know how he got started on Mass Effect yeah yeah there was this blog I used to follow

911
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:38,240
that kind of has an update I'm like is it Mass Effecting yeah that was mine what and but I

912
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:43,640
really just kind of connected with people and Mass Effect 3 is what got me into trying to draw again

913
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:52,360
because you remember I had like the 24 femshep art challenge yeah yeah yeah after I had had surgery

914
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:58,600
on my wrist and I'd already had two other surgeries on my hand so drawing was hard for me and it really

915
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:03,240
encouraged me to take a more realistic style and I tried to do like a little bit more realistic

916
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:10,040
coloring with the characters and and just do all kinds of different stuff and it really broke me

917
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:14,800
out of an art rut of course you know going back in and trying to draw my my hand still but I was

918
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:20,720
live-streaming my drawings that goes back to the interactivity with community but it really brought

919
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:26,640
out a lot of creativity in me it brought out I wrote fanfiction of course I also wrote this big

920
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:31,400
long ass Dragon Age fanfic a bunch of them and before I even knew what the official ending of

921
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:37,000
the series was going to be but people like it I still I got a favorite a thing on AO3 yesterday

922
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:43,760
a kudo for a fanfic I wrote six years ago or five years ago however long it was my Mass Effect

923
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:49,160
fanfiction still gets likes on it I'm like dude I haven't written anything since two years after

924
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:54,360
Mass Effect 3 came out I think it's safe to say like Mass Effect kind of like you became your

925
01:29:54,360 --> 01:30:00,360
fandom in this decade it really really it was and I say this from my perspective too and I think you

926
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:04,800
you are in the same page you and I both never never expected especially after like seeing the

927
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:08,440
first game and playing a little bit of it like never thought this was gonna be a series we'd

928
01:30:08,440 --> 01:30:17,600
fall into as hard as we did. Thanks Shane. That's a thanks Shane game. Yes. And on top of that you

929
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:23,240
know I think that at any point in the future we could say you know I really want to play Mass

930
01:30:23,240 --> 01:30:28,600
Effect all of Mass Effect again and you sit down and you marathon the shit out of it. Please please

931
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:35,640
please if there is a deity in this in the sky or wherever this deity is we need a Mass Effect

932
01:30:35,640 --> 01:30:42,680
trilogy remaster for the next for PS5 X sex. Screw that I've already modded mine high res mod there's

933
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:47,840
a great series of high res mods. That and Final Fantasy 13 please and thank you. The the other

934
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:53,640
thing too though is that I mean it did bring about this big surge in game modding I mean I

935
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:57,960
don't know if maybe Skyrim might have had the level of modding it did if not for what we had

936
01:30:57,960 --> 01:31:04,560
in the the Bioware games. I think modding PC games has been a thing for a very long time but sure.

937
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:11,040
Well I just think that it was those Bioware games that really did it but that also kind of broke my

938
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:19,280
heart over Mass Effect Andromeda I played through it don't get me wrong I it fuck you Bioware just

939
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:24,160
fuck you okay screw your anthem bullshit you can take it and shove it up your ass cuz you fucked

940
01:31:24,160 --> 01:31:33,400
over a great series for a failure really for a failure. I I still that that rests on a board

941
01:31:33,400 --> 01:31:39,680
room at EA for me not so much. But Bioware was at their mercy I mean essentially now Bioware is

942
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:49,840
just a subset of EA yeah and also fuck them for not giving me my Quarian DLC and I'm putting it

943
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:54,080
out as a book. I mean I'm glad to get it one way or another but you're still screwing us over.

944
01:31:54,080 --> 01:32:00,440
We'll try to look back on the Fonder memories of Mass Effect 3 yes. Is a failure and they're a

945
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:07,280
failure for making that failure. All right let's get to number ones I am dying to know this one

946
01:32:07,280 --> 01:32:16,600
Loki. My number one pick is gonna be of course Minecraft because it's Minecraft game it came

947
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:23,280
out in 2011 officially oh yeah it's official releases into that okay yeah I see what you're

948
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:30,320
doing if I can get Bayonetta all right fine it's hey it's his list yeah so minecraft because I

949
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:36,680
think it was just such a phenomenal game it still is a phenomenal game and it's they just continually

950
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:42,680
update it so we'll have to wait until we get a minecraft 2 but yeah hey I saw the vog minecraft

951
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:47,160
account tweet the other day yeah yeah you thinking about getting back into it I yeah exactly cuz

952
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:52,200
apparently hosting bedrock servers is a thing now so if anybody's interested I'm thinking about

953
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:56,440
actually hosting a bedrock server because one I don't have to maintain it because that was a

954
01:32:56,440 --> 01:33:00,600
pain in the ass with the mod stuff but and bedrock stuffs a little bit more accessible for a lot of

955
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:04,600
these folks because you don't have to have the Java client to run it you can do it with any of

956
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:10,680
the console versions any of the mobile versions to all login we can all play together no matter

957
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:19,080
what console you play on so that might be a thought because I was you know my I well and

958
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:24,360
I'll get into it in gaming week or whatever but like my son was wanted to stream yesterday and so

959
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:28,520
he did that for a little bit on minecraft but then I noticed it I'm like it's like connect the servers

960
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:34,040
I'm like the realms are these realms that you want me to connect to and I was like wait a second no

961
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:37,240
these are actual servers and they have like game modes and stuff like that and so I did some

962
01:33:37,240 --> 01:33:44,360
research like oh we can actually host my bedrock servers now and now that like playstation switch

963
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:48,440
xbox are all in the same universe you might get better adoption than you had the first time where

964
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:52,040
it was like you kind of had to be on pc yeah because now you can just be on anything so you

965
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:56,200
might get better yeah sure that's excluding everybody that has the pc version non-windows

966
01:33:56,200 --> 01:34:02,600
10 version you know from it but you can't please everybody yeah you can't please everybody so all

967
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:09,960
right um okay my number one pick any guesses I already know what it is do you I do okay

968
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:15,320
I'm still surprised you didn't mention any gta though he did I did my honorable mentions yeah

969
01:34:15,320 --> 01:34:19,400
I've been I must have been busy eating all right I already know I already know what it is okay all

970
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:24,600
right we'll see we'll see if you're right or not all right uh so when we look at the games the

971
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:32,360
decade in my my opinion there's one game that really just transcended I think everything else

972
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:40,120
there was one game that made people question can games really be art because this guy this game

973
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:45,320
and I already put that as normal mention this game let me let me do my monologue now y'all cut off

974
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:51,640
we're all cut off from that and then there's one game that really made people go um our games art

975
01:34:52,280 --> 01:34:57,880
there's one game that took uh the concept of online gaming and put a whole new spin on it

976
01:34:57,880 --> 01:35:04,600
that had never been seen before there's one game that was like a painting that was moving and I

977
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:10,840
think playing it I just I get I get chills just thinking about this game and the art that it is

978
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:15,640
and what it brought us and I think it unlocked all these just new doors in gaming it really did and

979
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:21,000
that's why my my game of the decade is journey on uh playstation 3 and playstation 4 is that

980
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:27,320
what you would have guessed yes yeah no it's absolutely uh absolutely journey is the game

981
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:31,400
of the decade and I think uh you know again it's the game that that has a lot of people going

982
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:36,760
it wasn't that the game was was Roger Ebert still alive when that came out because I feel like that

983
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:39,960
was the game that was brought to him because remember he'd written that whole piece about

984
01:35:39,960 --> 01:35:44,520
video games can't be art and remember how people were like okay boomer I mean they weren't saying

985
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:50,920
that but it was the the 2014 equivalent of that so um and and somebody had actually brought him

986
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:55,240
journey and he kind of he didn't really go back on what he said but he kind of like put out this

987
01:35:55,240 --> 01:36:00,520
thing that was like I see where the passion is and I see what that is all about oh shadow of

988
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:05,880
the colossus thank you act f so sorry I thought for some reason it was it was um journey um

989
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:12,360
and some folks uh commenting in chat uh questmaster saying for me journey feels like a very zen

990
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:19,000
experience it is it's it's kind of a short game but I think that's what I mean we bobby blackwolf

991
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:23,000
and I and some other folks from vogue uh and other friends of mine went to magfest a couple

992
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:27,960
years ago where they did a live playthrough with a live orchestra doing the game from start to

993
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:32,920
finish and you know it was only about an hour and a half or what have you but it was it was beautiful

994
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:40,040
like I just I was I was moved by a fucking video game but that's the beautiful thing about this

995
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:45,160
past decade video games have cemented themselves as art and I think journey is the exemplary

996
01:36:45,160 --> 01:36:48,440
example of that there is something that actually a little surprised you and I didn't mention

997
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:52,520
although I did make a mention of it earlier was everybody's gone to the rapture I you know what I

998
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:56,120
left out of my honorable mentions I was actually going to say everybody's gone to the rapture

999
01:36:56,120 --> 01:37:01,000
specifically to represent the um narrative gaming but you did bring it up earlier in the show at

1000
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:07,160
least so we haven't ignored them completely but yeah for sure but that was that because I didn't

1001
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:11,480
play journey I didn't have the system at the time all right I think I did but dam was monopolizing

1002
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:14,920
it or something and quickly while we finish this side call I want to see you guys in chat I've

1003
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:18,280
seen you guys been saying some things but you guys in chat what's your game of the decade I want to

1004
01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:21,080
read some of these real quick here in a minute what's your game of the decade and why in a

1005
01:37:21,080 --> 01:37:27,720
sentence um what oh it's you hadn't played journey yet I think is it out on pc now I can't remember

1006
01:37:27,720 --> 01:37:35,320
um I can't play I know that they put out a few games on epic game store I think it is yeah but

1007
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:40,120
they also want to throw up we have a lot more mac gaming now yeah I'm pretty sure it is because I

1008
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:51,880
want to say yeah that came out uh um yeah see it ported to windows um 2019 of june the other the

1009
01:37:51,880 --> 01:37:55,880
other part about journey I didn't dive into as much but the whole fact that you weren't alone

1010
01:37:55,880 --> 01:37:59,400
in that game remember that was the twist and I think all these years later I can finally say the

1011
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:06,280
twist in the game is that you have somebody there with you hopefully that person may have run off on

1012
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:10,760
their own but you may end up having somebody with you and you don't realize it like when you don't

1013
01:38:10,760 --> 01:38:15,160
realize that the first time you're playing it is that you think is this an npc what is this and all

1014
01:38:15,160 --> 01:38:18,920
you can do you can't talk you can't use voice all you have is a little chirp you can do like a

1015
01:38:18,920 --> 01:38:24,280
little chirp button and do stuff but the way you would work together with that other person some

1016
01:38:24,280 --> 01:38:28,840
or you might not that person might run off and do their own thing who knows but when it works it

1017
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:33,640
works so well that you and this other person are kind of in this experience together helping each

1018
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:38,360
other out using your limited methods of communication I mean that is it's beautiful

1019
01:38:38,360 --> 01:38:44,200
like and it's there's nothing like it in gaming yeah and I think that moment that moment really

1020
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:51,160
like when I realized this is another person this isn't just an npc this is another person at their

1021
01:38:51,160 --> 01:38:57,640
playstation right now I have no idea who it is you find out at the end of the game but you know it's

1022
01:38:57,640 --> 01:39:04,440
just all you know is a gamer tag I did though liken it to um the translated uh canned phrases

1023
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:09,080
though from final fantasy 11 because that was always something that I enjoyed was the fact that

1024
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:13,880
you could play with an international audience you just had to know the quirks like don't examine

1025
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:19,800
somebody because it means you're staring at them you know different things like that um but you uh

1026
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:23,720
loki weren't you talking about being able to play with people at like two in the morning yes because

1027
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:28,920
no one wanted to have a bard in their damn party but still I like that's another thing for the

1028
01:39:28,920 --> 01:39:33,880
Japanese really more that we're seeing more more unique ways of communicating with people outside

1029
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:39,640
of our own culture yeah anyway um I want to go you're right and something like journey you did

1030
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:44,360
language didn't matter the game had its own language it's just god I love that game all

1031
01:39:44,360 --> 01:39:49,720
right anyway um so um other comments from chat about games of the decade act f says pokemon go

bobby blackwell says rock band three the peak of the plastic instrument rhythm game

1045
01:40:56,680 --> 01:41:00,280
see I wouldn't have even thought that was this decade unfortunately it's been so long now

1046
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:04,760
I would have thought four was this decade but I would have thought three was the last decade

1047
01:41:04,760 --> 01:41:09,880
I guess was it 2012 I guess it would have been about 2012 huh wow no good pick good pick or even

1048
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:14,440
like you know like kind of along with rock band you know one of the things I thought was kind of

1049
01:41:14,440 --> 01:41:19,240
impactful was rock band beatles remember when they had like the trailer for them and stuff

1050
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:23,720
uh october 26 2010 for rock band three uh she hoax has heavy rain

absolutely so great picks you guys all right wow uh so our kickoff topic only went for uh two hours

1052
01:41:31,560 --> 01:41:37,480
give or take so finally we can get to our gaming weeks now if you want to talk about game of the

1053
01:41:37,480 --> 01:41:41,960
year I'm actually now I'm really glad I didn't schedule those tonight because I was like well

1054
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:45,960
next week's probably going to be a slow news week too so we're going to give one more week for

1055
01:41:45,960 --> 01:41:50,120
everybody to assess their game of the year this year specifically which I don't think I heard

1056
01:41:50,120 --> 01:41:56,200
any 2019 games on the decade list so that'll still be a surprise so uh games of the year

1057
01:41:56,200 --> 01:42:02,360
we'll talk about next week uh and the time capsule next week so uh because I anticipate next week's

1064
01:42:26,920 --> 01:42:32,680
cool um so uh what I've been playing I've been playing pokemon sword I've been playing what the

1065
01:42:32,680 --> 01:42:38,760
golf game's fucking weird but I love it yes it's like it reminds me of katamari though with its

1066
01:42:38,760 --> 01:42:45,560
weirdness yes it makes me think of a keita takahashi game did you play wadam yet no not yet

1067
01:42:45,560 --> 01:42:53,960
oh get on that because I can't um I've been playing uh pokemon go I like I said the other

1068
01:42:53,960 --> 01:43:02,040
week I uninstalled uh idle pouring um I'm playing uh pocket camp playing the harry potter game I

1069
01:43:02,040 --> 01:43:08,520
have not spent any more money on it nor will I um until rallying is dead or goes back on her turf

1070
01:43:08,520 --> 01:43:16,520
ways um I I really that's been about it for for the gaming oh yeah I've gone back to playing

1071
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:23,320
patterned um because I realized that because it's on apple arcade I can play it on my mac

1072
01:43:23,960 --> 01:43:28,520
and so I'm revisiting some of the levels that I really enjoyed in it plus they have they've

1073
01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:33,640
released some new ones since I last completely finished the game so I'm pretty happy with it

1074
01:43:33,640 --> 01:43:40,360
so patterned is so relaxing everybody if you just want to chill play it all right uh loki

1075
01:43:40,360 --> 01:43:47,560
your gaming week I didn't play much of anything because it was a few things one I was the holidays

1076
01:43:47,560 --> 01:43:52,120
there's the holidays I thought I would get more time to play games during the hall please it's

1077
01:43:52,120 --> 01:43:58,680
more of like being a slave to the children so I didn't I did uh well we'll talk about what they

1078
01:43:58,680 --> 01:44:04,280
played then because it was more I played pokemon go a little bit this week that's it uh but I got

1079
01:44:04,280 --> 01:44:10,040
my youngest son wanted to get set up with playing fortnite on the switch so he can play with his

1080
01:44:10,040 --> 01:44:17,640
brother on pc and so I set him up with that so he's now playing fortnite um on the switch and

1081
01:44:17,640 --> 01:44:24,200
then of course he did some streaming yesterday on my channel he did some twitch streaming which

1082
01:44:24,840 --> 01:44:31,160
I told him it's pretty hard to be entertaining but like he did okay he he that way I got the

1083
01:44:31,160 --> 01:44:35,720
notice that your channel went live I wasn't at home yeah so so he streamed for about like

1084
01:44:35,720 --> 01:44:41,080
45 minutes on minecraft and so you archive your stuff yeah it should be okay I'll go back and

1085
01:44:41,080 --> 01:44:45,560
watch it I think it's at this I think it's archived um otherwise I have a copy he's somebody

1086
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:51,240
in chat will say so in about five minutes why less than that watch yeah so um I did that and

1087
01:44:51,240 --> 01:44:59,160
then um what else yeah so then um I didn't really get to play much because I I was working on my

1088
01:44:59,160 --> 01:45:03,800
my game still which I didn't get a whole ton done with that it's more of just in the playing stage

1089
01:45:03,800 --> 01:45:10,600
of trying to figure out how to um randomly generate rooms but I needed to figure out

1090
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:15,400
formatting how I want to actually set that up so that I don't just start coding and have to redo

1091
01:45:15,400 --> 01:45:20,280
a bunch of stuff so like yesterday which is usually I have like two hours of programming

1092
01:45:20,280 --> 01:45:26,120
time I just kind of is mainly staring at a text document and trying to like brainstorm ideas for

1093
01:45:26,120 --> 01:45:31,560
that um I know what I want to do I just haven't implemented it yet uh but my son he's finally

1094
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:36,200
graduated from his yellow belt to orange belt in coding so he's doing slightly more advanced

1095
01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:42,920
um javascript stuff now which is kind of cool and yeah there's tiger claw with the link

1096
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:50,760
thank you yes so so yeah there's that and um that's yeah like he wanted me he's like so well

1097
01:45:50,760 --> 01:45:55,640
well we need to have like an intro form for me like like a youtube like a professional youtube

1098
01:45:55,640 --> 01:46:00,680
intro I'm like I don't even have a professional youtube intro like I I don't want to like I

1099
01:46:00,680 --> 01:46:08,840
I can't whip that together just like in a couple minutes like geez so yeah that that's he has very

1100
01:46:09,160 --> 01:46:15,800
high expectations but um yeah that's pretty much my game week okay awesome um my gaming week uh a

1101
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:19,400
variety of stuff I already mentioned I played way too much ingress yesterday uh I've been playing

1102
01:46:19,400 --> 01:46:25,160
all the other gps games too I've been playing them all uh orna has been surprisingly like taking

1103
01:46:25,160 --> 01:46:30,680
taken off amongst the olr yes I saw that like what no no offense I love you guys I took a chill for

1104
01:46:30,680 --> 01:46:34,840
a little bit of all the games I've recommended over the years I haven't downloaded it yet one

1105
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:40,600
that everybody I guess I will now since you know I don't want to I don't want to have any fomo with

1106
01:46:40,600 --> 01:46:46,280
it so it's it's interesting I like it now I'm starting to read more about the intricacies of

1107
01:46:46,280 --> 01:46:51,000
it and how like maybe being in a party and being power leveled was not a good idea because you kind

1108
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:54,760
of miss out on equipment but I'm doing okay for myself I'm still having fun that's the important

1109
01:46:54,760 --> 01:46:58,920
part so um yeah like every time I go to a new place now I bring up orna and I'm like has the

1110
01:46:58,920 --> 01:47:04,120
neighborhood been captured what level's the boss can I get it so uh yeah it's like really funny so

1111
01:47:04,120 --> 01:47:10,840
um yeah it's kind of fun um let's see other games so uh on playstation I just randomly was like

1112
01:47:10,840 --> 01:47:15,560
I'm gonna play pac-man championship edition again this or pac-man championship edition 2

1113
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:21,400
because I actually like the sequel um and I once had like a top 100 score on that game it's since

1114
01:47:21,400 --> 01:47:27,000
fallen to like top 1000 but I uh I unlocked some trophies I didn't have already because I was like

1115
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:31,400
oh I'm better at this game because I played it a lot on the switch so I can actually get a good

1116
01:47:31,400 --> 01:47:35,640
score in expert mode now so I unlocked like a gold trophy for getting an a an expert I still

1117
01:47:35,640 --> 01:47:41,240
can't get an s an expert some of it is just luck with how the ghosts fall on the rails um but uh

1118
01:47:41,240 --> 01:47:49,400
yeah I'll keep trying on that uh I I fell victim to the playstation sale uh so uh metal mayhem if

1119
01:47:49,400 --> 01:47:54,040
you're out there listening you want to know what games we get on sale I I bought the kingdom hearts

1120
01:47:54,040 --> 01:48:00,040
one and two remix hd because it was down to 25 bucks I had the playstation or excuse me the

1121
01:48:00,040 --> 01:48:05,800
kingdom hearts one remix on ps3 but I never had it on ps4 and I never did buy the second one

1122
01:48:05,800 --> 01:48:09,720
because I said oh it's a matter of time before they put it on uh playstation 4 so I bought that

1123
01:48:09,720 --> 01:48:14,920
um combo package it was down to 25 bucks I was like well that's a pretty darn good deal so

1124
01:48:14,920 --> 01:48:18,760
I played a little bit of kingdom hearts one I got through I'm I'm in the middle of wonderland right

1125
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:25,960
now just finished the trial part of it and doing the second half so um yeah so um been playing that

1126
01:48:25,960 --> 01:48:30,360
and that's pretty much I think that's enough for my gaming week so uh let's move on we do have some

1127
01:48:30,360 --> 01:48:34,200
new stories to get into we're only going to do about half the stories we do on a normal show so

1128
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:38,680
don't worry uh some I thought tonight was just going to be a short show but now it's about the

1129
01:48:38,680 --> 01:48:42,440
average probably going to be that average but we're not going to have as many stories as we

1130
01:48:42,440 --> 01:48:45,720
usually do uh we're going to go to about the classic game of the week and then the classic

1131
01:48:45,720 --> 01:48:49,480
game of the week is actually going to be like our pretty much last segment tonight if there's no

1132
01:48:49,480 --> 01:48:54,760
discord calls tonight so um let's get to it and we're going to get to some stories because

1133
01:48:54,760 --> 01:49:00,360
obviously with christmas hanukkah all the winter stuff being this week game game companies just

1134
01:49:00,360 --> 01:49:05,000
really aren't working new a lot of straight up some journalist sites are like we're taking the

1135
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:10,520
week off like vg 24 7 hasn't published just a new story in a few days so you know everybody's taking

1136
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:14,280
time off for the holidays and it's deserved but there's a few things there's a few little things

1137
01:49:14,280 --> 01:49:18,920
that we can bring up so loki we'll start with you yeah so there's a story about this guy rook

1138
01:49:18,920 --> 01:49:25,080
brooster who is a programmer he developed the program paint.net which is like a microsoft paint

1139
01:49:25,080 --> 01:49:35,080
type thing and um he had developed a game um at the age of 12 called the golden flute for

1140
01:49:35,080 --> 01:49:41,960
the flute of immortality and it was a dos uh role-playing game inspired by a text adventure

1141
01:49:41,960 --> 01:49:48,360
from uh they said 1984 instruction book on how to write adventure games so that's kind of cool um

1142
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:56,840
so he says he wrote the golden flute for on a tandy 1000 tl2 um tl2 which was an ibm clone

1143
01:49:56,840 --> 01:50:03,160
computer um but the thing is though he's healing made one installable copy on a three and a half

1144
01:50:03,160 --> 01:50:11,080
um 720k disc that he ended up packaging up and he sent to his cousin and that was it and then

1145
01:50:11,080 --> 01:50:17,160
apparently he thought that that caught that copy was lost and there was no playable copy available

1146
01:50:17,160 --> 01:50:23,720
well fast forward to today when um apparently there was somebody that got a hold of a version

1147
01:50:23,720 --> 01:50:30,520
of the game uh the streamer by the name macaw who he streams these old dos games and so he

1148
01:50:30,520 --> 01:50:39,640
played apparently the golden flute for on december 23rd and so uh he of course the developer reached

1149
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:46,760
out to to the guys see you know how he got a copy apparently it was apparently part of this uh

1150
01:50:47,880 --> 01:50:54,280
cream of the crop cult shareware compilation that was put together in 1994 and then apparently

1151
01:50:54,280 --> 01:51:02,520
they said a copy of it also was on phyto net so not sure how that ended up on part of that

1152
01:51:02,520 --> 01:51:08,840
shareware compilation but that's how they found it and so you know i don't know if he's able to

1153
01:51:08,840 --> 01:51:14,680
get the original copy of the disc but yeah uh dart to see it says i thought this was amusing

1154
01:51:15,080 --> 01:51:18,840
because i've seen the streamer before and this is totally the sort of thing he plays old pc games

1155
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:23,080
from all over the world oh yeah i can imagine you know and they used to sell those collections were

1156
01:51:23,080 --> 01:51:27,080
a dime a dozen back in the oh god yes yeah you could just and so this person probably just had

1157
01:51:27,080 --> 01:51:31,240
like a truckload of floppies yeah they used to have like a walmart like a thousand game collections

1158
01:51:31,240 --> 01:51:35,560
and stuff like that back before it was just all clone games it was like just like scraping the

1159
01:51:35,560 --> 01:51:39,560
internet of like all these freeware games and stuff or all these shareware games man i remember

1160
01:51:39,560 --> 01:51:44,840
used to go into like my local video rental store and they had a a wall of shareware stuff and just

1161
01:51:44,840 --> 01:51:49,560
go through like each one's like a buck you know and you get of course with shareware stuff it was

1162
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:55,320
like you know oh cool i get the share a copy of wolfenstein 3d it's still a full game it's just

1163
01:51:55,320 --> 01:52:00,040
you know it's a quarter of the uh one fourth of a full game and then the closest thing they have to

1164
01:52:00,040 --> 01:52:04,840
now would be like the the telltale model or like the first yeah so it is free or like life is

1165
01:52:04,840 --> 01:52:09,160
strange i think they give the yeah something like that i guess but like it still felt like a full

1166
01:52:09,160 --> 01:52:13,880
experience even with like the shareware stuff um and a lot of that you know they were encouraging

1167
01:52:13,880 --> 01:52:19,560
you that they wanted you to share it and you know if you wanted to buy the full registered copy then

1168
01:52:19,560 --> 01:52:25,560
you could do that um but i got my hands on like a lot of like software and stuff that way and go to

1169
01:52:25,560 --> 01:52:31,240
these like computer show and sales and stuff they have you know pirated stuff but you know you you

1170
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:36,360
could also get like a lot of these shareware discs and collections that's cool yeah yeah i remember

1171
01:52:36,360 --> 01:52:41,320
a lot of that i would just log on to all the bbs's and download all that too yes all right anyway

1172
01:52:41,320 --> 01:52:45,560
uh that's really cool though for that author that uh suddenly this game you wrote all these years

1173
01:52:45,560 --> 01:52:49,880
ago is uh suddenly being played on stream and uh earlier on the bobby blackwolf show on little

1174
01:52:49,880 --> 01:52:54,200
tossover call we found out that bobby blackwolf once wrote a bbs door game and now we've made it

1175
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:59,880
our mission to find it because we want to play it so come to find out there have been several

1176
01:52:59,880 --> 01:53:05,720
wrestling uh bbs store games he's already on the hunt so we'll see we'll see what we come up with

1177
01:53:05,720 --> 01:53:11,880
all right anyway uh let's go on move on talk about splatoon 2 i now here i thought splatoon

1178
01:53:11,880 --> 01:53:15,400
2 was kind of done with because they they were done with us i thought they were done with updates

1179
01:53:15,400 --> 01:53:19,240
and everything i thought they were totally done because the splatfest were done and so it was

1180
01:53:19,240 --> 01:53:25,640
kind of like the end of the cycle maybe we'd be lucky and hear about a um splatoon 3 but uh

1181
01:53:25,640 --> 01:53:29,800
apparently no more updates are coming on the japanese splatoon twitter account they mentioned

1182
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:35,240
that there is a new balance tweak and uh bug fixes happening actually they didn't say what it is but

1183
01:53:35,240 --> 01:53:40,200
people are just assuming it's those things but there is a patch coming uh on january 5th through

1184
01:53:40,200 --> 01:53:43,400
6 somewhere in that time frame just depending on where you are in the world and there will be

1185
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:49,400
another update in april so splatoon 2 and it's the lights have not dimmed over there yet i'm sure

1186
01:53:49,400 --> 01:53:53,720
there are people still playing that game it is a lot of fun the concept of paint as a shooter is

1187
01:53:54,280 --> 01:53:58,280
an awful lot of fun i do hope they end up putting out another game in that uh series

1188
01:53:58,280 --> 01:54:03,800
um but it's nice to see that the second one is still being supported nintendo has been very good

1189
01:54:03,800 --> 01:54:08,760
about supporting their games way after the release uh because you know mario maker got that huge

1190
01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:13,320
update with the zelda stuff not that long yeah i mean i i'm curious to see what more they're

1191
01:54:13,320 --> 01:54:18,040
going to release it i'm so surprised with mario maker too that they didn't do the amiibo support

1192
01:54:18,040 --> 01:54:23,960
like i feel it's just like very like strange yeah we never even you know what we got on the

1193
01:54:23,960 --> 01:54:27,960
tangent we never even got to address the whole like physical dlc when you were talking about

1194
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:33,880
that stuff we never got to talk about amiibos games the toys to life stuff or toys or what

1195
01:54:33,880 --> 01:54:40,680
they call the ed toys life yeah that was a trend well yeah but yeah i actually like the figures

1196
01:54:40,680 --> 01:54:45,000
but it's kind of gone away though aside from amiibos it's like amiibos are still there but

1197
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:50,040
not nearly like what they were i still see that like um star link stuff being sold at like

1198
01:54:50,040 --> 01:54:55,240
i thought like a collector's edition game something i'm not buying that i hear it's pretty

1199
01:54:55,240 --> 01:55:01,160
good i don't know all right anyway uh moving on dark sakura well i like to to focus on the human

1200
01:55:01,160 --> 01:55:06,840
element when i can um there is a 12 year old boy named rome i'm gonna steal one of these candies

1201
01:55:06,840 --> 01:55:15,400
okay well we still got a thank you see who's taking home yeah um but uh a boy in florida

1202
01:55:15,400 --> 01:55:19,880
decided to make a video game it's called please listen it's a video game for blind

1203
01:55:19,880 --> 01:55:25,880
and visually impaired children and um although i kind of laugh at his quote he says i learned

1204
01:55:25,880 --> 01:55:29,880
that it's actually harder to make a game than you think it took me about one to two weeks

1205
01:55:30,120 --> 01:55:39,880
blank blank wow um he said i was closing my eyes going through the levels seeing if they work or

1206
01:55:39,880 --> 01:55:48,040
not so basically um he also had severe hearing loss as a as a child still wears hearing aids

1207
01:55:48,040 --> 01:55:55,080
and he didn't learn how to speak until he was three so um he actually verbalized in in the

1208
01:55:55,080 --> 01:56:01,400
game used his voice as the guiding element in the game and apparently it was a really big uh

1209
01:56:02,040 --> 01:56:06,680
just step out of his comfort zone for him to do this for people and it was really good um but

1210
01:56:06,680 --> 01:56:12,280
yeah the game is called please listen if you can find it please share it with everybody and again

1211
01:56:12,280 --> 01:56:17,160
the things i the things i did when i was 12 and look at what this kid is doing it's amazing i

1212
01:56:17,160 --> 01:56:22,520
played i beat the guardian legend when i was 12 was that was that around the year of the year

1213
01:56:22,520 --> 01:56:27,800
final fantasy 2 in america which we all know was actually four was that that year i think it was

1214
01:56:28,680 --> 01:56:34,600
do you think i was 11 or 12 when i beat the guardian legend yeah because i'm i'm old er

1215
01:56:35,320 --> 01:56:43,080
it's all good all right let's move on uh loki all right so we we've talked about how there

1216
01:56:43,080 --> 01:56:49,640
were some issues with fallout 76 and being able to spawn objects into the world from link fallout 4

1217
01:56:49,640 --> 01:56:56,520
so uh kind of along the lines of that the same um set of uh kind of hackers that were behind that

1218
01:56:56,520 --> 01:57:06,680
sort of exploit now um had also found a way to basically loot other players in game so you could

1219
01:57:06,680 --> 01:57:11,400
actually at a distance loot somebody and steal all their inventory including their pip boy because

1220
01:57:11,400 --> 01:57:17,400
technically that's an object and so that was a problem that was going on for a while and then

1221
01:57:17,400 --> 01:57:22,840
of course now bethesda's allegedly patched that out but you know the fact that you had people

1222
01:57:22,840 --> 01:57:28,600
afraid to play on multiplayer through fallout 76 because you could just have your inventory taken

1223
01:57:28,600 --> 01:57:35,880
by somebody that you don't even see uh at any given notice um was kind of surprising so of

1224
01:57:35,880 --> 01:57:41,240
course they said you know we want to apologize for those who were impacted by this exploit uh we want

1225
01:57:41,240 --> 01:57:45,400
to make this right and we are currently looking in the ways that we may be able to compensate you

1226
01:57:45,400 --> 01:57:47,400
meaning that you're not getting your inventory back

1227
01:57:49,880 --> 01:57:53,480
i don't want to sound like one of those gamers and and i might add

1228
01:57:53,480 --> 01:58:00,360
so this is going to be great to to add to the uh fuel to the fire the items that they also

1229
01:58:00,360 --> 01:58:07,160
were able to take included items that you purchased from the atomic shop premium currency

1230
01:58:07,160 --> 01:58:13,400
items that might not even be tradable okay sorry all right no no you're fine i'll just say i don't

1231
01:58:13,400 --> 01:58:16,760
want to sound like one of those gamers but i'm a little bit surprised that um

1232
01:58:18,600 --> 01:58:23,640
that fallout 76 is like still going yeah i know that sounds really bad because it hasn't been out

1233
01:58:23,640 --> 01:58:29,160
that long but just well they still have their dog major update coming out for with the mps and

1234
01:58:29,160 --> 01:58:34,520
everything and i'm just waiting for that to crash and burn because oh boy every patch that they seem

1235
01:58:34,520 --> 01:58:41,320
to put out there it breaks more stuff all right well let's talk a little bit about uh something

1236
01:58:41,320 --> 01:58:44,360
that i think would have been really cool and some people would really like to see but it's

1237
01:58:44,360 --> 01:58:49,320
not happening uh unless maybe you make a ruckus now i don't know but uh apparently at one point

1238
01:58:49,320 --> 01:58:56,200
there was a xeno saga uh hd remaster that was being a planned uh so katsuhiro harada uh who

1239
01:58:56,200 --> 01:59:01,560
is general manager at bandai namco has uh talked about on twitter uh answering a question saying

1240
01:59:01,560 --> 01:59:07,320
this actually progressed to the remaster's plan but failed in a profitable market analysis

1241
01:59:07,320 --> 01:59:14,440
sorry guys this plan will be difficult to resurface so um but i mean at least he's reading

1242
01:59:14,440 --> 01:59:20,040
twitter so be nice don't be mean but maybe xenosaga fans if you really want that hd remaster

1243
01:59:20,040 --> 01:59:23,160
you got to speak up because they just don't think the sales are there they think they might put all

1244
01:59:23,160 --> 01:59:26,680
this energy into it and then they're not going to see the sales you know these things are cheap

1245
01:59:26,680 --> 01:59:31,560
they're not free so um you know maybe there's a compromise to be made here maybe they can't

1246
01:59:31,560 --> 01:59:35,320
upscale the whole thing in hd but maybe they could do some type of re-release of the classic games

1247
01:59:35,320 --> 01:59:41,000
that you know are just you know uh have some a little bit of work done on them maybe not a lot

1248
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:46,600
of work so i don't know but so it'll be nice to see um what do you hope we see you know i know

1249
01:59:46,600 --> 01:59:52,200
earlier in the show we kind of talked about some um hd remaster wishes i feel weird calling hd

1250
01:59:52,200 --> 01:59:57,000
remasters because some of these games we're talking about are hd games but some um some

1251
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:01,480
upgrades some new polish on old games you'd like to see in the next generation of gaming for

1252
02:00:01,480 --> 02:00:07,560
playstation 5 and x x series x uh wave what would you like to see so i mentioned a little bit about

1253
02:00:07,560 --> 02:00:14,520
um i talked about the uh mass effect trilogy i'd like to see for sure uh and um

1254
02:00:16,600 --> 02:00:20,360
the hell did i just say oh fantasy 13 and that whole trilogy i'd really love to see as well

1255
02:00:20,920 --> 02:00:27,000
come back um as far as a remaster or remake i would like to see saints row one and two

1256
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:33,320
uh being remastered uh would be kind of nice especially one because uh one a lot of people

1257
02:00:33,320 --> 02:00:40,760
didn't get to play that because it was only on xbox 360 um i would like i'd still like to see like a

1258
02:00:42,040 --> 02:00:48,280
like an enhanced version of oblivion 2 would be kind of cool i thought that they were going to do

1259
02:00:48,280 --> 02:00:56,440
that um but apparently not um some comments in chat um swang tong says uh metal gear solid one

1260
02:00:56,440 --> 02:01:00,920
uh dj rama s to just rival schools yes quest buster says it would have been nice to have a

1261
02:01:00,920 --> 02:01:05,080
xena saga remaster but i can understand that they might not go for it it's pretty neat series that

1262
02:01:05,080 --> 02:01:09,880
had to recover after xena saga 2 yeah uh bobby says whatever we all know you just open the

1263
02:01:09,880 --> 02:01:15,400
project in unity go to compile set the new target to xbox one or ps4 and ship it i mean and just

1264
02:01:15,400 --> 02:01:19,160
be sure to turn up the graphics on level three while you're there with that big dial that says

1265
02:01:19,160 --> 02:01:25,480
graphics on it i mean yeah absolutely yes but you put it in that new um i forgot their new high-end

1266
02:01:25,480 --> 02:01:31,480
shaders called preheat the oven to 350 put it in for 30 minutes and you're good all right anyway

1267
02:01:31,480 --> 02:01:38,680
let's move on dar soccer what do you have next for us well speaking of more of uh i would say

1268
02:01:38,680 --> 02:01:43,560
another benefit for video games and i'm not going into like the educational things although this is

1269
02:01:43,560 --> 02:01:52,520
a kind of education um this is a game that teaches mindfulness and mindfulness has i think been a big

1270
02:01:52,520 --> 02:01:58,840
trend in the last decade or so but people don't really understand enough about it it's really

1271
02:01:58,840 --> 02:02:04,840
centering yourself bringing your attention to your breath um cutting you know it's it's like a guided

1272
02:02:04,840 --> 02:02:12,600
meditation of sorts um and people who practice mindfulness have generally been uh they they learn

1273
02:02:12,600 --> 02:02:18,200
better they are calmer they have less stress in their lives you know which and also affects of

1274
02:02:18,200 --> 02:02:23,400
course the body because body and mind are connected um so it's a a research team at the

1275
02:02:23,400 --> 02:02:28,760
center for healthy minds at the university of wisconsin madison and at uc irvine university

1276
02:02:28,760 --> 02:02:35,240
of california irvine have developed this game and it's called tenacity and it was designed for middle

1277
02:02:35,240 --> 02:02:41,480
schoolers and all they have to do it's it's a tablet game um the one i'm seeing i think they're

1278
02:02:41,480 --> 02:02:48,280
doing it on ios um but what they do is that they go through breathing exercises with relaxing

1279
02:02:48,280 --> 02:02:54,840
backgrounds you know like greek ruins or space or something and so they tap their breath on the

1280
02:02:54,840 --> 02:03:03,160
screen and every fifth breath they double tap and so it's meant to have them pay attention to their

1281
02:03:03,160 --> 02:03:08,840
breath and to how they feel to progress through the levels and instead of teaching a particular

1282
02:03:08,840 --> 02:03:16,120
concept as it's teaching mindfulness they've actually shown that um these uh that the game

1283
02:03:16,120 --> 02:03:23,800
is improving their ability to learn their ability to pay attention um and with that mindfulness

1284
02:03:23,800 --> 02:03:32,840
they're able to to train their brain to um to uh connect more with the world around them and one

1285
02:03:32,840 --> 02:03:37,800
thing about this that they learned in their research is that and i'm going to go a little

1286
02:03:37,800 --> 02:03:45,240
bit into the the physiological on this one but it improves the connection between their left

1287
02:03:45,240 --> 02:03:50,440
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the left inferior parietal cortex of the brain which

1288
02:03:50,440 --> 02:03:57,720
are the areas that control your attention so um by changing the those aspects of the brain

1289
02:03:58,440 --> 02:04:06,040
they are able to focus more on the attention at hand um they had a another group as sort of like

1290
02:04:06,040 --> 02:04:11,720
their control that was playing fruit ninja they had none of those none of those developments

1291
02:04:11,720 --> 02:04:21,640
so training their attention in such a relaxing way has been well first of all it's been great

1292
02:04:21,640 --> 02:04:31,080
for the kids it also shows that if we don't take that time to pay attention to our breath to the

1293
02:04:31,080 --> 02:04:37,960
world with even to the people around us then we're damaging ourselves in the long run um am

1294
02:04:37,960 --> 02:04:42,360
i oversimplifying by saying this game sounds a lot like it's like the watch app that encourages you

1295
02:04:42,360 --> 02:04:46,520
to breathe you know it's very similar it sounds like a gamified version of that in a way yeah

1296
02:04:46,520 --> 02:04:50,840
you know it's very similar yeah like even for like adults they say you know you should take

1297
02:04:50,840 --> 02:04:55,160
a minute to really pay attention to your breathing you know because that can you know help you

1298
02:04:55,320 --> 02:05:01,160
stress relax you know anxiety you know flare-ups and things just stopping to breathe is so

1299
02:05:01,160 --> 02:05:06,200
important well and i will tell you something um at work we had a mindfulness challenge which i

1300
02:05:06,200 --> 02:05:11,880
want a blanket yay um but you had to use the breathe app 10 times a day for at least 25 days

1301
02:05:11,880 --> 02:05:16,680
in the month right and i that was to get the gold level which i got because i'm an overachiever when

1302
02:05:16,680 --> 02:05:23,560
it comes to breathing um and i have to say that it was having those moments to myself

1303
02:05:24,200 --> 02:05:31,160
and tuning out things around me really made me a lot more present in my life and i think i was

1304
02:05:31,160 --> 02:05:37,640
under a bit less stress since it's been i did it in october and i got out of the habit of doing it

1305
02:05:37,640 --> 02:05:43,320
and i've been getting myself back into the habit of it and i find this is gonna sound like maybe

1306
02:05:43,320 --> 02:05:47,560
a little bit of craziness because i've had some attention span problems before because i'll get

1307
02:05:47,560 --> 02:05:52,840
overwhelmed by certain things um but i have actually found my ability to tolerate crowds

1308
02:05:52,840 --> 02:05:58,760
has been a little bit better while i maintain mindfulness um and this is gonna sound like a

1309
02:05:58,760 --> 02:06:03,960
completely dumb thing but i don't want to look at my phone as much does that make sense oh

1310
02:06:03,960 --> 02:06:10,200
absolutely when i'm out with people i think now unless i have to check on something specifically

1311
02:06:10,200 --> 02:06:15,800
or get like a message from dan or something i don't have my phone out um i notice as i've been

1312
02:06:15,800 --> 02:06:19,640
getting older and maybe it's because i don't do those activities like some of those things have

1313
02:06:19,640 --> 02:06:23,560
been getting worse for me like claustrophobia issues do you remember at the very first gamer

1314
02:06:23,560 --> 02:06:29,320
x when i had that full-on panic attack yeah that has never happened to me ever but and what

1315
02:06:29,320 --> 02:06:35,160
happened guys is that i wasn't there that one but i knew about it okay yeah what happened is it was

1316
02:06:35,160 --> 02:06:39,080
nothing to do with the con itself it was fine but what happened was that it was just very very

1317
02:06:39,080 --> 02:06:43,160
crowded and we were in that kabuki hotel which is kind of got it's got like a low ceiling because

1318
02:06:43,160 --> 02:06:47,640
you know san francisco architecture big city architecture things you know old school like all

1319
02:06:47,640 --> 02:06:51,880
these panels kind of all let out at the same time and it was really like packed in like there's just

1320
02:06:51,880 --> 02:06:58,280
people everywhere and just all my brain for whatever reason just decided to go hey what are

1321
02:06:58,280 --> 02:07:03,480
you gonna do if a fire happens right now and i just started freaking out and they thank gosh

1322
02:07:03,480 --> 02:07:08,920
luckily staff knew what they pulled me back into the panel room that i had just left and i had a

1323
02:07:08,920 --> 02:07:12,760
moment to be able to kind of like okay i'm away from people i'm away from people and like stop for

1324
02:07:12,760 --> 02:07:17,320
a minute but it was like i'd never experienced anything like that in my life that i i will tell

1325
02:07:17,320 --> 02:07:22,920
you this right now welcome to how autism feels except it's more of the sense of overwhelming

1326
02:07:22,920 --> 02:07:29,240
it's not like panic like that but it's very similar um for me i get tunnel vision um i have

1327
02:07:29,240 --> 02:07:34,040
found that my ability to deal with the things that overwhelm me like people talking at the same time

1328
02:07:34,040 --> 02:07:39,160
because then i'll stop hearing words and i'll hear like the trombone parents from the peanuts

1329
02:07:39,160 --> 02:07:46,360
cartoons you know but i would actually challenge everybody um to spend a little bit more time

1330
02:07:47,080 --> 02:07:52,200
being mindful doing your breathe app just take you know a few minutes and listen to yourself

1331
02:07:52,200 --> 02:07:58,920
breathe count your breaths but then i'd like for you to go after that and do a task that you do

1332
02:07:58,920 --> 02:08:04,760
every day like try playing a puzzle game play something complicated um incorporate your

1333
02:08:04,760 --> 02:08:10,760
mindfulness into a daily walk but see how much better you do at the things you love

1334
02:08:10,760 --> 02:08:14,680
and i'm glad that they're doing this for these kids i wish that this was a widespread program

1335
02:08:15,320 --> 02:08:19,480
because i think that if they'd had something like this when i was in school that wasn't fucking nap

1336
02:08:19,480 --> 02:08:26,520
time i think i might have i mean i was bored i'll just admit it i was bored in school but i think i

1337
02:08:26,520 --> 02:08:30,440
might have found the things i was doing more interesting if i could pay attention to them

1338
02:08:30,440 --> 02:08:35,240
some interesting comments in chat marissa our friend of the show here uh says tenacity

1339
02:08:35,240 --> 02:08:40,520
apparently isn't available to the public yet but i dig my muse headband for mindfulness and my add

1340
02:08:40,520 --> 02:08:45,880
adult brain so um you know even though this game isn't widely available uh certainly other folks

1341
02:08:45,880 --> 02:08:49,880
kind of have their own techniques or um you know we mentioned this is kind of based on a watch

1342
02:08:49,880 --> 02:08:54,280
thing so if you're a smart watch i mean i know apple watch is what i have and there's one built

1343
02:08:54,280 --> 02:08:58,440
into it i'm sure android has to have something similar like they've all got to have some type

1344
02:08:58,440 --> 02:09:03,160
breathing uh but i know i know smart watches are a luxury so if you don't have that you know i'm

1345
02:09:03,160 --> 02:09:08,520
sure there's computer programs that will kind of help you with you know taking a moment to stop and

1346
02:09:08,520 --> 02:09:13,880
breathe and all that good stuff marissa does point out our i love i love marisela so glad you're in

1347
02:09:13,880 --> 02:09:19,480
there mindfulness is a big aspect of many newer therapies or spin-offs of cognitive behavioral

1348
02:09:19,480 --> 02:09:24,440
therapy which again for me as an autistic person i've had to go through a bit of cognitive

1349
02:09:24,440 --> 02:09:29,720
behavioral therapy myself um after i lost both of my grandmother's back to back i went into

1350
02:09:29,720 --> 02:09:35,720
hardcore therapy because i was having not just my um my meltdowns for autism i was having panic

1351
02:09:35,720 --> 02:09:40,600
attacks on top of it they do feel completely different um and yeah marissa also points out

1352
02:09:40,600 --> 02:09:48,200
10 happier i've used that too and um it's i don't prefer a guided meditation i'll be perfectly honest

1353
02:09:48,200 --> 02:09:53,320
i would rather do something that's from my own mind but i will tell you this bringing it back

1354
02:09:53,320 --> 02:09:58,680
to video games is why i say try this i was getting really frustrated i don't even remember

1355
02:09:58,680 --> 02:10:02,840
what game i was playing at one time but i was getting super frustrated with not being able to

1356
02:10:02,840 --> 02:10:08,760
do like one little task in it and i had gone off and did like a bit of mindfulness just because i

1357
02:10:08,760 --> 02:10:14,120
was so pissed off i just needed to calm down and went back and did it right after that no problem

1358
02:10:14,120 --> 02:10:20,040
no stress it's amazing what a little bit of mindfulness will do uh sj100 matt says my

1359
02:10:20,040 --> 02:10:24,120
girlfriend teaches mindfulness with the fifth graders uh it helps a lot of her students calm

1360
02:10:24,120 --> 02:10:30,120
down in stressful situations so uh and sj100 matt continues that i sleep with a white noise machine

1361
02:10:30,120 --> 02:10:33,800
and focus on my breathing if i have a hard time sleeping well you're probably doing it the better

1362
02:10:33,800 --> 02:10:41,480
way because i'll just take a melatonin so yeah i actually sleep with uh an air filter on um because

1363
02:10:41,800 --> 02:10:50,680
and earplugs because dan snores but um i i i have done other levels of biofeedback marissa brings

1364
02:10:50,680 --> 02:10:57,480
up doing biofeedback um but i mean it's just amazing i mean well even so our technology just

1365
02:10:57,480 --> 02:11:04,440
is again in the past 10 years that we've had these therapies incorporating with technology and gaming

1366
02:11:04,440 --> 02:11:08,920
to make these breakthroughs for people i think it's pretty amazing what a world we live in

1367
02:11:08,920 --> 02:11:13,640
all right well let's go ahead and move on we have just a couple more stories for you guys before we

1368
02:11:13,640 --> 02:11:17,320
get to the classic game of the week i think we're going to do one quick email tonight as well and

1369
02:11:17,320 --> 02:11:22,120
then i'll try to squeeze in a call or two although alan wants to start dinner about 8 45 so we're

1370
02:11:22,120 --> 02:11:26,200
running running out of time um but that's we'll get through these last few stories here real quick

1371
02:11:26,200 --> 02:11:32,760
so loki so really quick mega man x dive um which was a co-op multiplayer game that was coming to

1372
02:11:33,400 --> 02:11:41,960
mobile devices has been delayed now to 2020 and it they basically said it was supposed to be slated

1373
02:11:41,960 --> 02:11:49,240
for late 2019 but the game is now uh slated for the first quarter of 2020 due to the process

1374
02:11:49,880 --> 02:11:51,080
of optimization

1375
02:11:53,400 --> 02:11:57,240
well i'm all for games getting delayed but i still don't know how i feel about this on mobile but

1376
02:11:57,240 --> 02:12:02,200
we'll see it looks kind of me was reserved judgment until we can play it so get it as

1377
02:12:02,200 --> 02:12:07,400
good as it can be right sure sure all right um hey speaking of getting to try something

1378
02:12:07,400 --> 02:12:11,560
before it's out maybe uh there's apparently a leak out there showing that a final fantasy 7

1379
02:12:11,560 --> 02:12:16,280
remake demo is coming uh this is there was a tracking website that kind of checks like

1380
02:12:16,280 --> 02:12:22,680
what's going on on the stores uh like playstation store and stuff uh and this website game stat

1381
02:12:22,680 --> 02:12:27,320
which is the same place that found the resident evil 3 remake stuff um it actually found that

1382
02:12:27,400 --> 02:12:32,680
there is a final fantasy 7 demo that was lurking there on the playstation store which would be

1383
02:12:32,680 --> 02:12:36,840
interesting because i think a lot of us discovered final fantasy 7 the first time through those demo

1384
02:12:36,840 --> 02:12:41,800
disks and things of that nature so it would be an interesting throwback yeah see some of that

1385
02:12:41,800 --> 02:12:47,320
like pop up in a demo uh that would be available on the store that would be pretty cool so um

1386
02:12:47,320 --> 02:12:51,240
we'll see uh if it's going to be confirmed i imagine it'll be in the next couple weeks

1387
02:12:51,240 --> 02:12:56,600
because the game is out in march believe it or not here we go it's like it's like the little

1388
02:12:56,600 --> 02:13:00,680
joke bumper at the beginning said march 2020 is coming all these big the animal crossing

1389
02:13:00,680 --> 02:13:06,040
final fantasy doom all these big 2020 is going to hit the ground running you guys so here we go

1390
02:13:07,160 --> 02:13:12,680
all right let's move on uh to one more story before our classic game of the week dar sakura

1391
02:13:13,640 --> 02:13:17,400
well um and this has been making the rounds i'm sure people know about it by now

1392
02:13:17,400 --> 02:13:22,200
but there was a prototype of a canceled akira game um that was supposed to be out on the

1393
02:13:22,200 --> 02:13:28,040
sega megadrive known as the genesis in the us um and it was recently discovered um

1394
02:13:28,600 --> 02:13:36,040
it was it's been dumped online um the thing you can go download it um but it was uh made by a

1395
02:13:36,040 --> 02:13:43,000
company called black pearl software that was going to be working on one for the uh game boy the snes

1396
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:49,000
uh sega game gear sega genesis and sega cd the games were not finished there were screenshots

1397
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:58,360
back in the day um but the publisher thq uh basically said nah they didn't do it um but

1398
02:13:58,360 --> 02:14:03,880
it's been uploaded now to uh the hidden palace it is incomplete it cannot be played start to finish

1399
02:14:03,880 --> 02:14:09,000
but you can play individual stages it does have a stage select it looks actually pretty good it was

1400
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:14,200
supposed to have different genre like a motorcycle racing level like road rash um and then a first

1401
02:14:14,200 --> 02:14:19,960
person while tetsu was escaping it's kind of like doom um there was going to be a shooter

1402
02:14:19,960 --> 02:14:26,120
platformer stage kind of like flashback in the sewers a hoverbike stage um an isometric shooter

1403
02:14:26,120 --> 02:14:31,160
stage where uh tetsuo has to fight off the soldiers with his psychic power and a final

1404
02:14:31,160 --> 02:14:38,920
stage that isn't complete that has uh kaneda fighting tetsuo so um it it looks really cool

1405
02:14:38,920 --> 02:14:46,360
i've i've seen some of it in motion i don't know why but i mean we are supposed to be getting

1406
02:14:46,360 --> 02:14:53,720
a live action akira movie and uh an anime series which hopefully follows the manga closely um so

1407
02:14:54,440 --> 02:15:01,480
shrug emoji that's a good way to sum up considering that was our official like last

1408
02:15:01,480 --> 02:15:05,720
story of the year and last story of the decade i think this is a great way to just sum it all up

1409
02:15:05,720 --> 02:15:12,760
shrug emoji that's how i feel right well on that note let's go back to a simpler time when there

1410
02:15:12,760 --> 02:15:17,400
there were there were no emojis believe it or not well maybe i don't know or there was only

1411
02:15:17,400 --> 02:15:23,640
wing dings there was no emojis only wing dings it's the classic game of the week dark soccer is

1412
02:15:23,640 --> 02:15:27,880
going to walk into the gaming vault email first oh you want to do the email first yeah why not

1413
02:15:27,880 --> 02:15:31,320
yeah sure i'll do the classic game we're already here yeah we're already here we'll do uh email

1414
02:15:31,320 --> 02:15:35,160
during listen round table so classic of the week let's do it uh dark soccer is going to jump into

1415
02:15:35,160 --> 02:15:40,440
the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks hey you should play this game moldy oldie this is

1416
02:15:40,440 --> 02:15:47,960
this is a very interesting that has lived longer than you realize i picked minesweeper and i'll

1417
02:15:47,960 --> 02:15:51,960
tell you why i picked minesweeper because a co-worker and i we have a video of somebody

1418
02:15:51,960 --> 02:15:56,280
playing minesweeper and it's like sped up but it's like the world's biggest minesweeper board

1419
02:15:57,000 --> 02:16:01,480
and the music on this one is a piano version of flight of the bumblebee i i know i stripped it

1420
02:16:01,560 --> 02:16:05,960
but i'm just saying i thought it was funny yeah it is um but anyway it's a single-player puzzle

1421
02:16:05,960 --> 02:16:11,480
computer game you are meant to clear out a rectangular board that has hidden minds without

1422
02:16:11,480 --> 02:16:17,480
activating them but you have to mark which one's which the game actually originates in the 1960s

1423
02:16:18,440 --> 02:16:24,680
which was built for old mainframes pretty cool huh i would have thought it came from like penny

1424
02:16:24,680 --> 02:16:28,920
press magazine type of stuff i would have thought maybe this was like a pen and paper game at one

1425
02:16:28,920 --> 02:16:34,920
point interesting this was a this was a mainframe game and of course since then it's been on every

1426
02:16:34,920 --> 02:16:39,560
version of windows forever yeah there is one in windows 10 that has like achievements and stuff

1427
02:16:40,440 --> 02:16:44,840
i haven't played it um but the reason we got on the subject is because um at my job we work on

1428
02:16:44,840 --> 02:16:51,320
max and um someone's like how are you playing minesweeper on your eyes like i got it in the

1429
02:16:51,320 --> 02:16:57,720
app store there's minesweeper in the app yeah it's not just owned by microsoft blah blah blah

1430
02:16:58,440 --> 02:17:04,520
you know um but at any rate it was one of the earliest mainframe games in the 1960s and 70s

1431
02:17:04,520 --> 02:17:10,040
the earliest ancestor of modern minesweeper was a game called cube not to be confused with a really

1432
02:17:10,040 --> 02:17:16,280
weird movie series um and it's basically really became one of the most popular puzzle games out

1433
02:17:16,280 --> 02:17:22,200
there there's other versions called mind out by quicksilver in 1983 yomp by version interactive

1434
02:17:22,200 --> 02:17:27,720
in 1983 and then cube cube was succeeded by relentless logic or r logic by conway

1435
02:17:28,360 --> 02:17:34,120
conway hung and smith and it was for ms das as early as 1985 where you took the role of a private

1436
02:17:34,120 --> 02:17:41,480
and u.s marine core uh core to deliver uh messages and you had to basically sweep for mines you had

1437
02:17:41,480 --> 02:17:44,440
different ways to navigate through it and you had to go in a particular direction

1438
02:17:45,480 --> 02:17:50,280
it wasn't necessary to clean out the non-mine squares so it was a little bit different it

1439
02:17:50,280 --> 02:17:58,440
kind of played on the the uh minesweeper type there also were other mechanics of minesweeper

1440
02:17:58,440 --> 02:18:03,080
that were included in other games for example there was vine sweeper that was incorporated

1441
02:18:03,080 --> 02:18:09,880
into runescape who remembers fucking runescape um and it was just a little you know mini game that

1442
02:18:09,880 --> 02:18:15,000
was included in there and then mole control that came out on pc it was developed by remode

1443
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:19,640
um you had a minesweeper mechanic that was integrated into the puzzle game

1444
02:18:20,360 --> 02:18:25,800
in a village called molar creek that had moles everywhere so basically you were mole sweeping

1445
02:18:25,800 --> 02:18:32,040
i guess so as far as other versions um it's been bundled on operating systems for ages

1446
02:18:32,040 --> 02:18:40,040
um there was minesweeper for os2 um there was minesweeper for windows k mines uh in kde which is

1447
02:18:40,040 --> 02:18:49,640
uh a unix os um gnome mines and gnome uh mine hunt in palm os so there who remembers palm os

1448
02:18:50,440 --> 02:18:57,320
um the hp 48g graphing calculator had one called mine hunt um where you had to navigate from one

1449
02:18:57,320 --> 02:19:02,280
area of the play field to the other by navigating the mines voltorb flip mini game is in the non

1450
02:19:02,280 --> 02:19:08,600
japanese releases of pokemon heart gold and soul silver as a variation of mines minesweeper and

1451
02:19:08,600 --> 02:19:15,000
p cross you have a logic puzzle version of minesweeper that you play on paper that has

1452
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:19,160
some squares already revealed but you can't reveal any more squares you have to mark the ones you

1453
02:19:19,160 --> 02:19:22,440
think is it's an interesting so that's what i'm thinking of that's where i figured it would have

1454
02:19:22,440 --> 02:19:30,280
started um but these um were uh i'm trying to see uh the puzzles appeared under the name

1455
02:19:30,920 --> 02:19:36,600
uh tentai zoo which also means star map in southwest southwest airlines magazine spirit

1456
02:19:36,600 --> 02:19:46,040
2008 2009 um uh in minecraft uh for the 2015 april fool's update the love and hugs update

1457
02:19:46,040 --> 02:19:50,920
added minesweeper which is a near exact copy of minesweeper except instead of avoiding the mines

1458
02:19:50,920 --> 02:19:59,640
you have to avoid creepers um it uh now as far as its computational complexity in 2000 richard k

1459
02:19:59,640 --> 02:20:07,240
published a proof proof meaning like a theoretical mathematical problem i guess

1460
02:20:07,240 --> 02:20:11,800
it's hard to describe that it is an mp complete to determine whether or not a given grid of

1461
02:20:12,520 --> 02:20:17,240
uncovered correctly flagged and unknown squares the labels the foremost also given have an

1462
02:20:17,240 --> 02:20:22,200
arrangement of mines which is possible within the rules of the game so basically he's mines mine uh

1463
02:20:22,840 --> 02:20:29,320
minesweeper as his proof also he proved that infinite minesweeper is Turing complete

1464
02:20:30,440 --> 02:20:37,800
so um but at any rate uh this video is about to end sadly so anyway the game is minesweeper

1465
02:20:37,800 --> 02:20:41,560
it's been around since the 60s so there's there's some people in chat saying i don't understand this

1466
02:20:41,560 --> 02:20:46,920
game i don't know how to play this game so the numbers are showing you how many mines are

1467
02:20:46,920 --> 02:20:52,520
touching that square exactly and so you have to use logic powers to deduce where is the mine by

1468
02:20:52,520 --> 02:20:57,720
looking at the surrounding numbers and sometimes it's just luck and sometimes it's just dumb luck

1469
02:20:57,800 --> 02:21:04,440
but that's the ones that are like if you get like a five usually what i do is i count the spaces

1470
02:21:05,080 --> 02:21:13,320
so if i say that i have one that's got a one all around it yeah or or maybe like a one like so

1471
02:21:13,320 --> 02:21:18,840
you've got a corner piece and you have a one above it and a one to the to the left of it then that i

1472
02:21:18,840 --> 02:21:24,120
that means then the the that one is attached to the one in between those so the one that is

1473
02:21:24,120 --> 02:21:29,800
directly the left diagonal that's an example yeah so and in that video which i guess i can

1474
02:21:29,800 --> 02:21:33,960
bring up again here real quick i'll restart it from the beginning when you see these big areas

1475
02:21:33,960 --> 02:21:39,400
get uh uh explored at once that's because it's zero so zero will automatically because if it's

1476
02:21:39,400 --> 02:21:44,120
zero it automatically clicks everything around it because zero is going to be safe so the empty

1477
02:21:44,120 --> 02:21:49,240
squares are zeros basically they just don't say zero uh and then he's putting in flags as he goes

1478
02:21:49,240 --> 02:21:54,360
to mark where the where it could be yeah uh and you can do a question mark where you think one

1479
02:21:54,360 --> 02:21:58,200
might be so you can go back and explore it later um and as that said the number tells you how many

1480
02:21:58,200 --> 02:22:02,680
lines yeah but was that said oh i wanted it to end when they hit a bomb spoiler alert he ends up

1481
02:22:02,680 --> 02:22:07,240
beating the puzzle he gets the whole way this is like a world record attempt yeah uh he wouldn't

1482
02:22:07,240 --> 02:22:12,920
have put it on youtube if he didn't um but the big prize you get for winning the windows 3.1 version

1483
02:22:12,920 --> 02:22:18,040
that little smiley icon way at the top wears shades that's it that's what you get for winning

1484
02:22:19,800 --> 02:22:26,520
shade emoji this ain't solitaire with the fancy you know card with the bouncing card and all that

1485
02:22:26,520 --> 02:22:31,720
stuff but at any rate this is i mean yeah it can really piss me off sometimes but it's another one

1486
02:22:31,720 --> 02:22:37,240
of those games that i play to focus on something else because it's i do this with actually i do

1487
02:22:37,240 --> 02:22:43,480
it with patterned and i do it with solitaire that it's i can devote one part of my brain to this so

1488
02:22:43,480 --> 02:22:49,640
that the rest of my mind can focus on what i'm hearing i do it when i when i was in class

1489
02:22:49,640 --> 02:22:55,720
that's why i do a doodle or play another game while i was in class so there you go we had to

1490
02:22:55,720 --> 02:22:59,640
mention minesweeper at one point or the other it's a good pick to end the decade on i mean even

1491
02:22:59,640 --> 02:23:04,280
though it's not from this decade it's still one of those like oh yeah hell lots of people play

1492
02:23:04,280 --> 02:23:09,160
minesweeper at some point so even if you didn't understand it it was in your windows 3.1 or

1493
02:23:09,160 --> 02:23:15,560
windows 95 computer so you probably booted it up at some point what's this i suck at this but uh

1494
02:23:15,560 --> 02:23:24,120
maybe one day i'll do a emacs tetris oh a minesweeper stream that'll be fun no you know

1495
02:23:24,120 --> 02:23:30,680
what i'm i'm sad about now is it the last os release emacs tetris is no longer available

1496
02:23:30,680 --> 02:23:35,880
did you ever know about that sorry i'm distracted so i'm actually watching alan use his brand new

1497
02:23:35,880 --> 02:23:39,800
instapot that he got for the holidays for the first time i know it played little songs when

1498
02:23:39,800 --> 02:23:46,120
you take the lid off and on yes my washer my dishwasher does that it plays shoe bear

1499
02:23:46,120 --> 02:23:53,960
when it's done i have one of the uh uh samsung dishwashers ask alan there's one microwave at

1500
02:23:53,960 --> 02:23:59,800
work that plays a little song when it finishes is it a samsung i don't know but it's there's

1501
02:23:59,800 --> 02:24:05,160
like five microwaves up there i will only use the one that plays the song check and see if it's a

1502
02:24:05,160 --> 02:24:10,600
samsung because apparently samsung appliances including their washing machine and dryers all

1503
02:24:10,600 --> 02:24:15,800
play this one shoe bear piece interesting when they're done huh okay all right anyway anyway

1504
02:24:15,800 --> 02:24:19,000
let's move on we're gonna get to the listener round table i'll see if we have anybody in

1505
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:23,320
discord here but first i think we have an email that we want to do actually we do and it's our

1506
02:24:23,320 --> 02:24:30,840
last email of the last email of the year last email of the decade all right hello lr we know

1507
02:24:30,840 --> 02:24:36,120
who this is i've decided to take a few minutes breaks from spinning like a top trying to get

1508
02:24:36,120 --> 02:24:40,680
ready for magfest so here i am in text form it's yyr by the way if you haven't already guessed

1509
02:24:40,680 --> 02:24:47,400
first i wanted to extend a little offer to me to jamie to me i always love hearing about food on

1510
02:24:47,400 --> 02:24:52,360
the show and i love me some potato latkes but i was disappointed to hear that used a box mix

1511
02:24:52,360 --> 02:24:56,440
making them from scratch takes more time but it's super easy the final product tastes way better

1512
02:24:56,440 --> 02:25:00,520
all you have all you need is a blender and i have a peeler and some potatoes a big onion some flour

1513
02:25:01,080 --> 02:25:04,920
eggs oil and salt if you're interested i'll send you my mom's recipe i promise that you won't regret

1514
02:25:04,920 --> 02:25:09,960
it i do know how to make latkes from scratch i've made latkes from scratch it's much easier to bring

1515
02:25:09,960 --> 02:25:15,240
the box mix over here when you're making latkes in somebody else's kitchen yeah to be fair she's

1516
02:25:15,240 --> 02:25:19,560
making them in my kitchen during the show so i think that's why she cuts corners and it's okay

1517
02:25:19,560 --> 02:25:27,320
i will say they were still good to me your counter space hey alan did a great job this week to make

1518
02:25:27,320 --> 02:25:31,640
room for the new pot so there is that but i'm just saying i know not much space to prepare

1519
02:25:32,760 --> 02:25:37,640
um but i will take the recipe because i love recipes um i actually want to do latkes in a

1520
02:25:37,640 --> 02:25:44,520
waffle iron i think that'd be cool be fun lastly i wanted to extend an offer to all of the listeners

1521
02:25:44,520 --> 02:25:50,360
as initially promised i'll be at super magfest 2020 indie showcase come on by and i'll try the

1522
02:25:50,360 --> 02:25:55,400
latest versions of super multitasking and sharpshooter plus i'll be selling them in a

1523
02:25:55,400 --> 02:26:00,600
bundle along with falling plus all for just five dollars but if you mention olr it's yours

1524
02:26:00,600 --> 02:26:05,800
from easily two bucks i hope you'll enjoy playing the games saying hello and saving a few dollars too

1525
02:26:06,600 --> 02:26:11,000
thanks as always for putting on the show have a great week hopefully with less craziness than mine

1526
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:18,200
now back to testing equipment and loading the car hugs erin yyr we love you yyr um and since i just

1527
02:26:18,200 --> 02:26:25,080
saw yyr last month here's the thing if you go find him at magfest and ask nicely for a hug and

1528
02:26:25,080 --> 02:26:30,280
you give yyr a big hug you will kind of be hugging me because i just hugged yyr last

1529
02:26:30,280 --> 02:26:35,880
girl so has paper stuck to its butt i mean technically the back of its leg allen can you

1530
02:26:35,880 --> 02:26:42,120
what what did mr smoosh's stupid ass do now all right oh my god the way allen just picked him up

1531
02:26:42,120 --> 02:26:51,720

1578
02:31:12,440 --> 02:31:17,000
role which is really where i'm still working to this day so it's just kind of funny how things

1641
02:36:38,440 --> 02:36:41,480

1645
02:36:55,080 --> 02:37:01,800
appreciate you guys giving us the motivation to keep doing this actually i would like to say sure

1646
02:37:01,800 --> 02:37:06,120
you can follow up three no name three things that you've accomplished this decade that you're proud

1647
02:37:06,120 --> 02:37:11,720
of three things that i've accomplished this decade that i'm proud of uh while i have the

1648
02:37:11,720 --> 02:37:15,880
show on the mind i would definitely say the opportunities that have presented themselves

1649
02:37:15,880 --> 02:37:22,600
at dragon con with getting to um host panels about podcasting and be accepted as a um professional

1650
02:37:22,600 --> 02:37:27,720
i think is a huge thing so that would be one this is very adjacent but it's still super important

1651
02:37:27,720 --> 02:37:33,480
to me um i would say would be when i got to do the panel with um barry bostwick uh patricia quinn

1652
02:37:33,480 --> 02:37:38,040
and little now because obviously i grew up on the rocky or picture show and to get that opportunity

1653
02:37:38,040 --> 02:37:46,040
to let be in the same room with them let alone sit at the same table as these people was was

1654
02:37:46,040 --> 02:37:54,200
huge for me and i'm just so thankful for that opportunity um i would say maybe three would be

1655
02:37:54,200 --> 02:37:58,600
some of the things that i've done in my career that i don't talk about here on the show uh as

1656
02:37:58,600 --> 02:38:03,160
much but um i think i've had a lot of growth uh from where i was at the beginning of the decade

1657
02:38:03,160 --> 02:38:07,960
to where i am now uh i've had a lot of professional growth in 10 years and that's just looking to keep

1658
02:38:07,960 --> 02:38:14,680
on getting better so um it's very exciting stuff loki what are your three my three for this year

1659
02:38:14,680 --> 02:38:20,600
for the decade for the decade oh i don't know i had kids okay that's an accomplishment that
