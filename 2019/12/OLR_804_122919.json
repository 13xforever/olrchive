{"text": " In this decade we've seen a lot happen, way more than I can reasonably summarize in 13 and a half seconds. Join us for the next couple of hours while we touch on the holiday trickle of gaming news and do a deep dive into the memory vault. All this starts right now in the show wherever gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio. Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to the very last Orange Lounge Radio of the year. My name is Rob Roberts and it is episode number 804 for this December the 29th of 2019. Joining me here in studio DarkSakura or Jamie Summers. Hi. Hi. I'm gonna come on camera for five seconds even though I'm not like wearing makeup or anything. Alright that's fine because we do tape live at the Voice of the East Network twitch.tv slash a VOG Network where you can see DarkSakura is wearing a onesie tonight because tonight is all about cute and comfortable. I'm wearing sweatpants. I'm wearing my cozy kigurumi. It's a red panda. And tech master Loki, hello, who also always joins us here every week is wearing his is that does that say ho-man? It does say ho-man. It's like he-man. I follow a lot of those on Twitter but I well Santa's got his shirt off Loki that's it's a little thotty there. No he doesn't. He does not have his shirt off. It looks like it from this angle. Oh no okay from the angle with the light it looked like this was like his chest. No it's just a Santa elf and he has a candy cane. It was the angle or I'm thirsty you be the judge. But the angle of the light bouncing off it kind of made it look funny. All right anyway that's hilarious. Hey ha hi we're here and yeah we're taping live during this holiday week. Hope you guys have been having a good holiday whatever it is you're celebrating. I know DarkSakura mentioned off-air that it's the last night of Hanukkah and I know she you lit the last candle for you headed over here right? I did and it's on my Instagram which is at DarkSakura if you want to see I use an oil menorah because candle wax everywhere is shitty. They make this stuff though called wax off and I laugh because it's him whacking off but it smells like really bad. Well I'll plug my Instagram too at Mr. Rob Roberts that's MR Rob Roberts just like my Twitter account and because I didn't post anything quite so important but I have been posting like you know that memes been going around that you you film yourself and it's like what Pokemon are you and it flashes around. I got horsey for what Pokemon. Yeah everybody says it's just Russia trying to steal our identities but I mean what's. Well I'm gonna go back to live journal. Let them have it. There's nothing worth taking here. Well actually speaking of Russia getting all of your information and being online I actually am reviving my own blog to cross post over to vog fun at DarkSakura.com. All right. You can see what it looks like right now because right now I'm like this font sucks and I'm on Helvetica right now. And I also want to briefly mention that on Christmas Day you and I had dinner we had a movie or no I'm sorry it was well day after it was technically but it was our Christmas celebration it was dangerous we saw a movie I know you were really happy scene day celebration it was our Boxing Day celebration we always get when we get a chance to do it we always get some kind of Asian food so this year we got Vietnamese yes so none of us got fall even though we're at a fall place now speaking of Boxing Day I have a special surprise but I need to go get it okay so I'm filled time I you liked cats I did whereas everybody is not wrong you can tell us a little bit cats thing and I'll be actually gonna be I'm not gonna go super into detail but I'm gonna be relating some very personal stuff about myself when I was in middle school I was having a really terrible time I had a really hard life I will say and someone some relative gave me a CD for cats and the music made me very very happy and then I was having again a hard time in high school and it came out that my high school band was gonna get to play at Carnegie Hall and we were gonna go get our choice of a play one of them was Tommy the other one was phantom and no I think phantom was sold out no one of them was phantom and one of them was cats and so of course I picked cats and I had such a beautiful memory of not to pun the song but for me it was actually one event in my life that turned me off of doing something very drastic and every time I hear the music from it it's like this momentary forgetfulness of everything that is terrible in my life not everything is terrible now I'm a lot better than I was back then but going to see the movie for me was it sort of brought back all of that happy moment I had that day in the Winter Garden theater and I could I could forget the the body and the fake fur and the naked thing cuz for me I really felt like I was transported back to that night at the Winter Garden theater and when I got home that night I actually kind of bawled my eyes out because that emotion was so overwhelming for me and so I'm really looking forward to seeing it again I had I got the soundtrack for the movie I like the new song that's in it I miss the the awful battle of the peaks and the follicles I did go and do a very in-depth analysis will moderately in-depth analysis of what was missing would have been changed and I like the I like some of the changes in it for me it's a different universe of the same story I I liked what's his name as McCavity Idris Elba mm-hmm he was perfect for McCavity I liked everybody in it I love they got a ballerina for Victoria and Judi Dench was I honestly say that she was probably my favorite change because I really liked her as a little Deuteronomy so for me all the people out there making fun of it ninety percent of the people I have found have never seen the stage play never so they don't know and the people who've really liked it have been people like me who have seen the stage play so go fig but I'm planning on seeing it again Thursday cool yeah well now I feel like Ellen but here's a present okay so um but actually not not my to in all this is actually came to us from Canada from our pal Delvin at BG realness I have no idea what's Rob gave me a night no I gave her a knife but I have no idea what's in this but you might have some type of idea right all I know is that we did an exchange of things we cannot get in each other's countries plus I said homemade cookies so there's gonna be Canadian things in here I'm gonna be mad if there's not any Swiss chalet gravy okay that is not the spirit of the holiday I'm kidding all right I will say quickly I I realized dark soccer has a much more emotional connection to cats than I do I there were some parts of it that were kind of like silly to me but I didn't think it was as bad as everybody saying it is I kind of feel like most of the people that are talking bad didn't bother to see it I will say though the CGI was a choice they should have just done the Broadway they should just have the Broadway makeup and costumes it would have been fine I would have liked for them to have had a bit more merger of the styles you know the CG bodies were great I remember I don't know if it was Tiara or Victoria who said it about you know Jenny any dots taking off her coat yeah but that's what happened on the stage production and actually it's one cat playing her in the dressy outfit and with and honestly I liked the costume change better with her that little purple number instead of just this whole fringe bodysuit I freaking love drum tum tucker I just wish that they would have had more of like the fuzzy elements they had in the play you can't say cats is the worst movie of the year when this is the same year that x-men Dark Phoenix came out I'm sorry Oh dark sorry just lit up I don't even know what's in it what's in it for God's sake all dressed okay I am a big fan of all dress chips heck yeah I've never had them they're great they're they're very vinegary though we also okay you can have I will try one but I don't like ketchup those ketchup tips I don't like cash Browns I love them ooh I'm looking forward to this hickory sticks I haven't had in years I've had hickory sticks before I am excited all these big bags of chips oh he sent like more than one of the things chips crispy crunch hell yeah and ooh Wunderbar Wunderbar oh hell yeah what is that KitKat oh cool cuz Canadian KitKats are fucking good cuz they use the different chocolate right well believe it or not it's a video game podcast but we get to rail but plus what what honestly what were the headlines this week tell you tell me what's your top game of the decade times everyone okay well let's let's let's do the thing that Jesus Christ how much candy did eat that boy says Marty's in it too okay well that means we all get to have a Delvin I love you can I be your you're like fake wife just send me chocolate until you love me all right no I'll tell you what I sent Delvin uh-huh is I sent I sent a thing of like flaming Doritos mm-hmm and I sent jello why you can't people get that other places it's so weird to me jello is everywhere and I sent three different kinds of Oreos I sent the latte thins I sent red velvet because it was also you know nod to you and I also sent crap it was another flavor she realness says the Oreos are gone lol well I forgot the other flavor that I I sent you I'm sorry I will say I am aiming for a Toronto trip this summer so I've already talked to Delvin about this so he knows cake I'm trying to make Toronto Pride work this year at the end of June so that's kind of the plan whether it happens or not we'll kind of see but if I go to when I go to Canada cuz I'll make it this year at some point I want to I'll bring back some more stuff then let me have you all also meet up with my friend's sister visa decline who I think is gonna be working or not working but participating in Toronto Pride cool I was gonna try to go but Dan and I are going to New Orleans for anniversary oh how fun and I'm going to derpy con so busy 2020 yeah it was carrot cake was the other flavor okay and I think I also sent Godiva pudding all right well believe it or not it is a video game podcast but obviously this week was a little bit slower in gaming news but as Loki was saying with the tongue in cheek this is kind of a chance for us to reflect on the decade yeah now before cuz some people are gonna play pull this card and that is that the next decade doesn't really start for another year because a decade runs from it would be 2011 through 2020 would be the decade but you know what that's not here's the thing I think a lot of numerology is big for a lot of people right so I think a lot of people are like we're we're in the tens or the teens at this point and now we're gonna start the Roaring Twenties start so it's more looking back on the last decade a decade being a measure of ten years I am however participate participating in a meme tomorrow night a meme yeah what's a mean there Ramones meme at midnight the day before New Year's Eve uh-huh it's 20 20 24 hours to go and are you gonna be sedated you can take a sleeping pill be sedated a little bit I don't know I've got champagne we're gonna probably toast with mimosas and I have whiskey that I'm the bottle of whiskey that Becky bought me I have a bottle of Nika coffee green whiskey I've been dying to try it for a while and Becky got it for me because Becky is a quality human being who knows I love whiskey Oh Jim Sally and chat says mr. Rob if you come to Toronto pride I'll be your official Canadian boyfriend for the week best week ever and then VG realness says I'm excuse me I'm already here man man please let's just be Polly all right let's just there's enough there's enough love to go around I'm claiming VG realness though as my my ace boyfriend so sugar daddy everyone yeah my literal ace Canadian boyfriend sugar daddy love it literal sugar daddy all right anyway let's get into looking back on the biggest gaming news of the decade so we kind of want to know like what were your three biggest stories if you were to look back on the decade what were the three biggest things in your mind and you know there's no right or wrong answer for this I think everybody has three right I didn't yeah date three I think everybody came up with this I did more because you know that's fine you have some honorable mentions it's fine so um you know these are gonna be like our top three biggest like news and just to kind of give you an idea to look back on how long a decade was we were listening to Bobby Blackwell here in studio who's on before us a vog network every week and he was kind of going through some of his old like show roles and and titles of shows and things to kind of go back on what was happening and then I remember that we have the orange lounge radio wiki so thanks to all the kind people that contribute to our wiki over at orange lounge radio dot wiki.com we have some headlines from the past decade so some of the things that happened at the beginning of the decade January 10th 2010 episode number 352 Microsoft announced Xbox live game room pain is still real so real too soon yeah they announced that a consumer electronics show which is that early January thing so yeah it was a big big thing that happened in January 2010 and is NBA Jam making a comeback spoiler alert yes but it wasn't a short it wasn't come back just wasn't the original hey we saw an NBA Jam at the movie we didn't sound NBA Jam machine to the movie old skewell and then let's see just a couple others here episode 354 February 7th 2010 stories include Sonic 4 and blaster master overdrive announced spoiler alert neither were really that good this was the blaster master on the Wii not the pretty good reboot they did later overdrive and then Sonic 4 wasn't very good either but then they did Sonic Mania and that was much better so anyway and then Microsoft pulled the plug on Halo 2 and Xbox one games on Xbox live you can you can open the stuff that was the president and then a dark Sakura I know this is gonna be a little bit of a sad memory but in in in all honestness this is one of my favorite olr moments that ever happened so back in the beginning of the decade in 2010 we were still doing this show at your house so on the show February 28 2010 stories included news from Nintendo's World Summit and Shermy's review of Sony video game related show the tester oh is that the one where she threw up no she shit on the she shit on the floor that was it while we were talking about Sony's the death Shermy Shermy died in the last decade she did but you want to know what the last thing she did before she died she took a shit on Dan shoe no this is what happened Dan was playing Borderlands huh and I think Borderlands 2 and sure me we just got back from Disneyland I was keeping a wrapped in a in a hot towel from the dryer so she went back into her little bedroom which was the dryer room and she patted me on the foot and I went to go get ready for the bed after I gave her scritches next thing I know she's killed over in the living room dead still warm and there was a big shit on Dan shoe and so he's cleaning cleaning the body up for me gonna go get her cremated for me and next thing here is god damn it cat and I'm like what don't talk like that about the cast like she shat in my shoe god damn it cat and so anyway yeah we lost we've lost many many good pet memories I mean Maruko and Sanrio from our family you know and I sent you video not long ago that found of Sanrio that I took yeah that's the other interesting thing about this last decade is that we've documented so much of it on our phones obviously iPhones and androids existed in the last decade but I think they've really become prolific in this decade and she with the video inside my iPhone that's right what was great is the very next episode episode 358 in the most legendary episode yet olr takes a stand against cuss free week the only way possible with the fuck show stories include portal to being announced that was a big game of the decade we'll have to see if that comes up in any games of the decade list a little later but anyway so yeah it was a bit yeah remember all the hype going into the fuck show which was like this olr in joke for years and I think it had to do with a story like this shows you how old the show is okay like a story about counting the number of times the word fuck was said in Pulp Fiction and about like how is it even possible to say fuck that many times and we kept saying we'll I'll do it one day one day we're gonna outdo it we're just gonna have a fuck show and so finally it happened at the beginning of the decade we had a show and because there was a story about national cuss free week or something who said this is the week so we did the fuck show and it was it was kind of a letdown I think the joke got old after about three never lived up to the hype it's no it didn't live up to the hype yeah fuck a lot we did that was great it was liberating it was it was very livery all right free the fuck top three so looking back the whole decade you know those are some of the headlines from early on but looking back on the whole decade what do you think were the three biggest headlines I want to know you guys in chat to some of your big headlines although hold off because they'll scroll off the screen before I can see them but be thinking about it more than three I'll leave a space for honorable mentions before number one okay so we're gonna do three to honorable mentions one sound good okay all right then dark soccer I want it you're ready to go so number three what is your number three I'm actually combining one then okay it's the advent of certain kinds of games the indie game for one thing super meat boy vvvvvv came out in 2010 undertale off do you remember off we played as the baseball batter that one had a big internet following yeah and then there were a lot of them just popping up on steam steam really took off with the indie games and now we had it have these developers that you know the big names are working with these independent developers love you why why are two who gave us our favorite game sure and pixel shits no I love that and so if we were writing it down would we say they're prolific ness of the indie game yeah cuz the indie game isn't necessarily new to this decade the advent of the popularity and just the the the ease of getting it got to be so much what Nintendo is finally embracing it that shows you how far it's come and with that that also brings about the advent of the narrative genre because a lot of those games were made by maybe not the biggest development houses but we had the Edith Finch we had everybody's gone to the rapture we had to the moon which was done in 16-bit style one of my favorites what was that other one that I can't think of the name of that wasn't Edith Finch or everyone's gone to the rapture but at any rate it's just it's it's really an exploration of different genre and different development styles and going outside of the norm for what you're looking for I think I really really think that that was a big thing is that people really looking outside of the box we have a big surge in creativity and new concepts and new talent and people starting to realize a game isn't something that you have to win it is just something that you enjoy that you get something out of it your games can experience it's an experience exactly whether or not it's screaming because you died in five seconds hello kaizo mario because that was also you know the big thing but I think that it's that advent of people really finally embracing the other when it comes to their games now some great comments in chat here pixel pockets bringing up gone home it's another great example of you know but Bobby I think really kind of is putting his finger on a little bit like why why this decade what made it prolific in this decade I think it's a great comment from Bobby Black Wolf I think a different way of looking at it is the ease of developing games that really happened in this decade making games was really hard before unity and unreal engine took the hardest parts and extra plated them for you same thing with XNA that's why indie games blew up people even using Swift yeah people didn't need to know linear algebra to make a 3d engine to be able to make a game they just need to make the game and you look at some of the biggest hits of the decade things like Five Nights at Freddy's that was done in what click team fusion or whatever that is undertale was done in another one of those I think yeah but I mean but really it's the fact I agree that the development has become so accessible that and you know back in the day we used the only thing that we really had to do something like this was maybe the occasional visual novel maker and RPG maker I mean really that was it to my knowledge or you know doing like a mud or you know something like that but or you know text games because those were fairly easy but now we have like legit fun entertaining games that we can play on our home consoles or our computers that are as immersive as any big title you know release and more of these people are now are finding that they have not just a way to make a living of making a game but they also have a way of using their voice of getting a message out there that they want to of course some people are also using that ability for for I would even just flat-out say evil like the school shooter game and the series of anti-democracy games coming out of China you know but at the same time a lot of people are really using it as a force for good okay that's a really good really good take on one of the biggest things the decade kind of the the rise and the portability and the the new stories that have opened up in the indie gaming world good Loki I'll let you go next what's your number three my number three is probably gonna be because I've been kind of going back and forth with my rankings here so I'll say because it did get a lot of like coverage in then it just kind of went up and then down though yeah somebody in chat just mentioned oh yeah yeah because oh yeah was like this big it was kind of one of the things that got Kickstarter some notice because that was kind of launched but well the you know game funding through kickstart was really kind of like being brought to attention of everybody who threw you know that we yeah and how much money it raised everything and they're like oh yeah we're gonna take on the consoles and everything and they came out and it was kind of flopped and then I don't know but I mean you can kind of say that it sort of led the way with other you know maybe not directly led the way but you know you have other indie consoles now or other smaller consoles coming out like you know with the officially you know the Nintendo Super Nintendo Genesis and then like not so well it's sort of it's still official but like you know eventually the Intellivision and then Atari's doing their own thing so it kind of you know maybe a little bit too early before it's time to to pie in the sky but it's just the implementation which is not very good okay yeah and kind of also what that represented for Kickstarter I don't know if Kickstarter is gonna come up again on anybody's top three but I think certainly the OUYA is a good kind of benchmark for showing like the Kickstarter and kind of like the pluses and the minuses yeah I mean lots of things like oculus rift you know was a big one there's also all the other games make it man clone I can't even remember the name of it now my name and I didn't thank you beat you by nine seconds but yeah what but and I say it kind of kind of mixed here pod culture says that would be me I actually liked the OUYA some people liked it and you know considering I think a lot of people kind of pre-ordered those or kick-started those things I should say to be able to play retro stuff on them and you know they were gonna be open-ended it was very easy to put emulators on them I think for people that were just looking to do that that we have probably delivered very well I'm not saying pocos just one of those people but I think there are many people that got what they wanted out of OUYA it's just OUYA for whatever reason I'm not sure we can to this day kind of figure out where did OUYA stumble why couldn't OUYA keep it going it just wasn't a lot of people developing stuff for it and they were like putting out first off like their controller was crap it was good though that you could use your own controller with it which is nice but the software offerings weren't very good you had to have demos for all your games that were on there so I don't know if that was what was holding it back but I did play some of the games on there definitely a lot of the demos and side loading stuff you could do that it just didn't have like really it would have taken off if it had like OUYA like as a platform and then you know oh you can have like a Apple TV type service or not Apple TV Apple arcade type service you know with it where there's a bunch of indie games you can play on it and stuff would be kind of cool but even when I think they took the OUYA part out of it and just the software and brought that to want to say it was one of the Razer consoles or it might even been the Nvidia shield one of those has that now I don't even know if it's really doing anything there either right now because I think now it's like well if I want to play Android games on my TV I can just get an Android TV or I can or not play it on my TV and play it on my phone and do it that way I don't know but maybe at the time that we came out to it I mean let's be real that thing couldn't process much more than a mobile phone could and I think there just wasn't a lot of demand for those types of games on a big TV at that point I mean maybe OUYA was too soon who knows but yeah I mean look at it like now because you have a lot of people do so with Raspberry Pis and I want it I don't remember the timeline whether you know where the Raspberry Pi was when OUYA was out but like the OUYA is like a $75 it's an expensive console whereas the Pi is like 30 bucks and you can probably do a lot of the stuff that you can do on the OUYA at least with emulation stuff because that's what a lot of people are interested in on that but I just think that it was just too early like I think now the technology is a lot smaller and you know more powerful that you could probably pull off something like that but it's kind of too late so I don't know they have it who knows someone may try again later but yeah not the OUYA all right so Loki's number three the rise and quick fall of the OUYA all right my number three my number three moment of gaming news of the decade I'm gonna say when Reggie Fils-Aime debuted the Nintendo switch on the Tonight Show would be my number three top gaming story of the decade I think obviously I'm kind of encompassed I'm using this as an excuse to just talk about the Nintendo switches impact on the industry with this but I think specifically that moment of Reggie Fils-Aime going to debut the switch on the Tonight Show they were able to sell that concept in a way that didn't really work for the Wii U and you know you can contrast that moment of what happened on the Tonight Show with what had happened previously with the Wii U and that confusion of oh is this an expansion for the Wii no it's an all-new console remember how that was kind of like a problem yeah whereas when we saw the Nintendo switch and its demonstration being unveiled and executed on the Tonight Show it made it very clear this is something you play on the TV then you pick it up oh it's ready to go they had a powerhouse game in Breath of the Wild ready to go it kind of didn't matter that that was a game that really was coming out for the Wii U and had been kind of developed for the Wii U in many ways like it didn't it that part just didn't end up mattering because the way that they sold the message on the switch was so strong it's almost like all the problems in the Wii U's messaging were being fixed in the way that they were rolling out the switch and this just goes as well to the big gif moment of Miyamoto doing the thumbs down and the thumbs that whole thing and that okay yeah that's silly but yeah silly but it's you know it was also meaningful I think it's cemented Reggie Fils-Aime I think many of us in the gaming industry already knew he was like he was dead you know he's he was like he's that cool guy that showed up on holidays and told you what you're gonna get that year you know like Reggie Fils-Aime was already kind of like the gaming industry is kind of in that way kind of like you know the cool dad or maybe the cool uncle would be a better way to put it because then he'd voice a dad maybe like Miyamoto is really the you know but but Reggie Fils-Aime is definitely like the cool uncle that shows up right and certainly you know when he ends up retiring everybody was like oh that sucks to kind of see him go but at the same time he's earned it and you know hope he has an awesome pension and all that stuff but anyway I digress a little bit but I think what I'm trying to get out with Reggie Fils-Aime in that moment too is that he wasn't just the voice for us but he was able to be comfortable going on The Tonight Show representing gaming representing all of that and kind of putting that out there in the the more the general population in general people and I think it is a big part of the reason why the switch did as well as it did is the message got out there that time and it's not just The Tonight Show I just think that was kind of like the moment but it was you know just the messaging of the switch and and yes you pick it up you take it out and it's on the go and it was it was huge. SSG100Matt in chat pointing out all we got was a video beforehand The Tonight Show spot was the first time we actually saw it live and in person yep Bobby Blackwell says everyone thought The Tonight Show demo was faked because everyone was convinced that Nintendo couldn't actually pull it off absolutely and as we're reflecting on that moment all of that was absolutely true we were probably even skeptical here on this show I think I remember something about a delay between the the screen and then pulling it out and I think there was wonder about is that show it's fake that's everything and no no that's just how it works or it well it's just how it works or B it was the prototype as well it probably didn't quite run as snappy at that point yet there were actually five prototypes for the switch before though I'm sure early well one of them the sides were supposed to be magnetic mm-hmm and then they had another one was supposed to have like the circular clip on it and it was pretty interesting well I remember the the whole concept behind putting other types of controllers in the in the in the joy con spots although we have seen that with the NES classic controllers I think that's what you can do they do have one though I want to say that you can get one that does have a different d-pad or something on it or has a d-pad instead of the four buttons or you know the the doesn't the switch light I want to say have different d-pad instead of the four buttons yeah yeah I think so so but anyway yeah and I think so my number three again is Reggie fees and may going on the tonight show to debut the Nintendo switch and I I think this kind of just all encompasses the switch and Nintendo kind of starting the decade a little bit rough we you didn't go so well for them although I you know I still think the Wii U had a lot of great moments in it right we had things like Mario maker you know there were there were great titles with the Wii U but the messaging just it didn't connect and I what we were supposed to first get Breath of the Wild on yeah I will say it to this day though if they hadn't if they'd called it something different it would have done better I fully believe that but I mean there's no way to know I guess in retrospect but anyway um the Nintendo switch its debut the success that it's found putting Nintendo back out there marching to the beat of their own drum as much as much as it frustrates the hell out of us sometimes I think all of that kind of goes into my number three just representing the Nintendo switch so let's move on to number two but not you know number two but you know yeah mine's like no particular order kind of thing so I'm gonna say the advent of Nintendo directs because the first one I think it was 2010 2011 2011 I believe was the first one yeah and it was also it ties into another thing about e3 losing its relevancy Nintendo might have been the first big one to do it but a lot of companies started abandoning e3 is their primary way of releasing information Nintendo I think really paved that path and of course we had the the closure of Kensha Hall a lot of Indies couldn't really do too much at e3 anymore and so we have now so many people they may have a presence at e3 but that is not their delivery method not anymore and Nintendo was the first one I really think to make that a thing I think you're absolutely right and as much as like people might go you know oh that's an interesting selection I think I think you've nailed it is that even though Nintendo Nintendo marches to the beat of their own drum we know that and we get frustrated as hell by it sometimes when it comes to things like online and the way they roll out their retro library and things like that but at the same time like Nintendo direct they got it right and they were ahead of the curve on that absolutely doing it Sony skipped out on e3 Microsoft does it to an extent too yeah I mean Microsoft may still attend e3 and see some of the value in that but Microsoft certainly does their own conferencing and things of that nature so I think he needs to go to kitty jail mr. smoosh is over there he has his own top three where's my debut anyway so he's he's on his way to kitty jail don't work he's he's a nice big comfy bed in there in a small supply of food and water so he doesn't go crazy in kitty jail but he's not out here screaming alright anyway some comments from chat SGO and her Matt says the Nintendo direct scheme really changed how press conferences are done dark to see you says I'm sure that's why Sony adopted that strategy in the last couple of years because Nintendo had a really great idea there so and dark to see you say Microsoft does their X 0 1 9 or whatever shows just like we had one a few weeks ago so Microsoft still may kind of dip in the traditional things but they do they do a good hybrid you know they do a little bit of Microsoft directs if you want to call them that and and traditional press things as well yeah but I also begs the question how long is that trade show gonna last mm-hmm really it's haven't they lost money now there's a lot of statements eulogizing e3 and I I don't know I think it's a complicated question I'm not sure what e3 can do I think e3 kind of has to show the value in making Los Angeles like that destination place to be for gaming that week I don't know if opening up to the fans has really done that because I think they were trying to inject fans into what is a trade show a professional show you know if you're gonna bring fans make it a fan show you know go all-in on it you know yeah wasn't that the e4 all thing whatever happened event the problem with e4 all is that everybody knew it was just a poor like it was the the scraps left over from e3 you know no offense to anyone cuz you know I know the network we used to participate on had participated in e4 all it was a great opportunity and all that stuff I'm not like I don't I understand why people wanted to go and participate in it but let's be real it was the scraps from e3 e3 was still the mega event and it was like well we'll do we'll do this little dog and pony show too you know but now there's just gonna be the one maybe we all laugh at e4 all which is last decade but maybe there's some things to be said in there so anyway alright so there you go Nintendo directs and what it's kind of done to e3 let's go around to more number two is Loki so I always think this is pretty interesting because you know we kind of grew up in arcades and stuff and so now you see all the arcades kind of going to these giant ticket games and it's kind of like all the classic arcade stuff is gone except now it's not because we have arcade one up that's putting out arcade machines that people bring into their houses which is great with like classic games and that wasn't a thing that I ever thought would happen that cheaply let's put it that way and now it's just like all these big games you know from my childhood now coming back where you know if I wanted to I could fill my house full of these arcade games which is great I don't even know how to say that succinctly but you are you're you're very spot-on with that observation that it's like arcade came home in the form of like console games and that caused the arcades to kind of die off a little bit you know I'm now granted you know there was always gonna be these big it's just nostalgia yeah but now it's like now a lot of that arcade stuff is literally in your house now and it's very easy to come by yeah it's inexpensive like you can get like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles machine for like two or two to four hundred dollars versus like probably close to a thousand two thousand dollars when it originally came out I mean I don't know what those machines would have cost but I can't imagine it was that price maybe it's the same way to put it would be the growth and authenticity of collectibles yeah I think would be a way to put it is that you know it's like it's like you have the real thing right it's all this like you know classic gaming coming back because it's nostalgia a lot of people are very nostalgic about that stuff and they want to kind of experience you know share that with their kids and so that because you can't go there aren't any traditional or not many left traditional arcade game arcades out there you can't just go to the mall and go to a tilter you know Aladdin's castle or whatever it's just that's a great perspective because you know I don't have kids star soccer doesn't have kids a lot of people listen to this show don't have kids some do you have kids and so you're talking about how do I introduce the places I went to to my kids I can't they don't exist anymore or they're not like they were but I can still have these cabinets and these things that kind of show these types of games yeah because it's just not the same I mean granted like I remember we're going to an arcade and it's quarters and it or you go to nickel city or something like that you pay like five bucks to get in you pay with nickels you can like spend like a long time there on like 20 bucks granted yes I know inflation and shit like that but nowadays it's like every game I play and I remember like starting off with DDR it's like it was a bucket game that was expensive you know as always the big games now it's like I want to play a round of you know crossy roads a game that's on my cell phone or my tablet I'm playing crossy roads on a giant screen for like literally less than a couple minutes for a buck a time a buck a game that is ridiculous just because it spits out tickets on a related note you have to see what Bobby's writing in chat right now right dark soccer cuz this is right up your alley yeah stealing one of my thoughts oh is oh so maybe I better wait and all right all right well I was gonna say because um well we're talking about collectibles kind of going into the home we see pinball is kind of coming back in bars and kind of pinball arcade and the comment about get these pinball machines out of my basement and they set them up in an arcade somewhere so it's almost like pinball has had this weird rise in this decade well thanks Stern for that pretty much and the good and I'm gonna go into this but I mean thanks to Stern we have the big old names in Bally and Midway and even Gottlieb coming back and doing these massive tables you know I mean Steve Richie he's done like what some of the last five really popular Stern pinballs he and then he got to do his dream game which was Black Knight Sword of Rage so a quick follow-up something we talked about a previous week on the stranger things pinball table is really out there now they've shown like the official commercial all the official previews are out there it looks so good that machine looks amazing so all right anyway okay so great there you go you're number two um so my second pick I'm gonna piggyback off dark soccer a little bit because mine is e3 related I was gonna kind of call it the rise and fall of e3 a little bit but I think the the pinpoint note that would be definitely like the last moment when I felt we really had a moment in e3 that was so important and so relevant and the kind of thing that e3 needs to pray comes back would be the PlayStation press conference where they unveiled the PlayStation 4 specifically would be that I think second biggest moment of the decade because just the way they curb stomped my hey hey Microsoft sit and spin it was it was it was something and like I you know it was it was a level of like competition and shade and that type of stuff that like we just hadn't seen in a long time like it was almost petty but it wasn't like it was very much tastefully it was tastefully petty it was Lori petty it was it was because like literally like a month or so beforehand the most ridiculous press conference was unveiled like just such a flop it was true shade it was shade we all know is true absolutely but you're leading into the the Microsoft thing yeah right yeah and yeah the Microsoft event Don Mattrick kind of fell on his face so that whole thing a little bit you know Microsoft had to kind of eat it a little bit when it came to their message of the sport yeah yeah right the sports the TV and the mandatory Kinect and look I understand that Microsoft has its defenders at that time and still does and I also understand that in many ways Microsoft may have seen like a lot of things they were pitching at the time would make a lot more sense now a lot of things they talk about with digital and that sort of thing and maybe the concept that like you don't really own your discs anymore because everything's digital like some of those things make a little more sense in 2019 but it just goes to show how the gaming industry is a really unique play I don't know if this exists in the movie industry maybe it does a little bit but the gaming industry is a very unique position of you've got to not only make your game and make your console you got to do it at the right time and the announcement and how you do it and the messaging is all an art form it in and of itself it really is I think their fail was announcing it at all if you're gonna do that make it subtle make it an organic change you know something that's gonna make sense like like I mean kind of how Nintendo's doing it where you can get both versions of a digital and then you start seeing a phase out just saying oh it's not gonna be like that anymore fuck you everybody well I also think ever since Mattrick went out and Phil Spencer got in I think you've seen Microsoft's messaging and what they're looking for and what I think it's changed significantly we just haven't had a new console yet but that's gonna be a huge thing I think as we like to get into the next decade you know this whole is cloud gaming going to really happen is what did Google maybe misfire a little bit by launching stadia too early who but or maybe it's gonna be a huge success maybe we're gonna look back in ten years if heaven forbid the show still going in ten years and we look back and we go oh my god stadia was like the biggest fucking thing in gaming this whole decade they were right we just we don't know we won't know really but as of now it seems like who maybe the stadia has launched a little bit early but anyway I'm digressing a little bit I think we kind of already hit on the rest of what I was gonna say as far as like the rise in the fall when you talked about Nintendo Direct so I think certainly when it comes to e3 specifically I think we've seen that like it was the must have it was the you're gonna gather in a movie theater to watch this and that that was that year I mean I know Sony's done it a couple of years but that was the year you wanted to be in a movie theater and watch them publicly bully Microsoft is honestly what happened that year and it was it was something else to I don't look at it as like a bullying more or less like a scientific refutation it really did seem very clinical didn't it well I think the worry was that this was kind of a calculated effort across the industry that this is the way it's gonna go and tough luck this is you're in or you're out and the thought was okay we saw Microsoft now it's okay digital only or you know we're not going to be sharing this or something like that all this DRM and then the worry was okay so when you're gonna do the same thing because then that means that like this is kind of what's this mean and it was just kind of that collective relief of like okay thank God there's some sanity in this industry you know because of all the announcements is that on top of the fact that the initial announcement from Microsoft is ridiculous and so you know that just compared to the rational yeah it's just like it is normally it was such a big announcement even though it really wasn't so to kind of summarize this and move on to the next point I would say that this moment the PlayStation and our PlayStation 4 reveal and what it did to Microsoft was literally the last must-see TV event out of e3 and maybe that's what e3 kind of needs to get back to a little bit is a little more of those live they let you know I realize live is a scary thing because the internet can be a harsh critics a lot of the time more than it needs to be but those live moments are what really make the whole thing happen you know too much of e3 now felt very scripted like you know the moment when I realized like this e3 is is not what it used to be like that the moment for me was when we were standing in line to see a new Assassin's Creed thing in a theater and we'd like had to justify to these people who we are and that we had an audience and that you know you have literally empty seats in that theater and you should let us let us go sit in them so we had to like fight to do that and then I go back to the hotel later that night and the entire thing we saw in the theater was up on YouTube and I was like fuck this like what are we doing like you know so that was yeah but that was all canned that was a canned message it was up on YouTube as well and everything so anyway um now I would say also um because Bobby is mentioning in chat one of the other things interesting things about that PlayStation event is that they also announced at that event that they were gonna start charging for online play but nobody cared that's a very good point they announced all this good news good news good news then they snuck in there oh and PlayStation Plus is now how you're gonna be able to play your games online nobody cared nobody cared because everybody kind of saw it coming so to have all this good news and then that everybody just kind of overlooked it so it was very very interesting I think in a way all right anyway let's move on I think some honorable mentions before we get to the big number once so and please realize somebody else's honorable mention might be your number one so we won't elaborate on these too much but let's talk about some honorable mentions dark soccer the thing is my honorable mention in my quote number one honestly I'll switch him out because I have one the one I mentioned was the one I was gonna do as my number one so I'm just gonna go ahead and fucking say it because it's kind of equal for me but the whole retro revival you know barcades being a thing having pinball come back again thanks to companies like like Stern and Jersey Jack and the one I can't think of off the top of my head that's doing pinballs again but we you know like I said that's been a big thing and also that goes in with the classic consoles being revived as well like the mini versions we've had an NES SNES there's gonna be Nintendo 64 there's gonna be turbo graphics slash PC engine the Genesis classic Sony did one I mean fuck if Sega did a Saturn I'd just go dance around for a while please take a little dreamcast please but I mean all of that that whole revival of it's going into you know there's indie games again where we're seeing our retro style like I mean shovel knight is a full 3d game that plays like a pixelated 2d old-school really good game you know we're seeing a lot of this revival I mean they've tried to update these and they just realized that doing it the old-school way is the best so I really tie all that in together we're having a nostalgia that has manifested itself you know what's interesting and I'm kind of grinning over here because as you're talking about it I'm reminded of another artistic industry where like retro revivals are very important and crucial to the industry fashion fashion exactly right this retro revival is a huge fashion thing right but gaming gaming I just like that I can shop at the thrift store again yeah gaming hasn't really been around long enough quote-unquote to have had a retro revival I think in the way that we've seen it happen in this past decade you know especially with the NES classics selling out like that and you know the Super Nintendo classics and you know sure we had retro stuff we had Atari collections on PlayStation in the last decade things like that but I don't think we saw it at the level that we've really seen it in this past decade you know they've got those home sets now that looks like what that Commodore 64 one that looks like the big keyboard it really isn't a working keyboard by the way did you notice that we have the new decoration up yes yeah if you it's if it's hard to see on camera and I can see that it probably would be a little bit hard to see on the camera it is an actual like copy of the patent for the Commodore 64 which y'all know is near and dear to my heart so um the moment I saw that I knew I had to get it but I mean but we were seeing a lot more of that you know and it's not just oh get off my lawn you know all of us people not to say we're old or anything but I'm seeing especially and I'm even gonna tie in speed running to this because we got a lot of really young people speed running classic games and that I think is also tying into the whole retro revival too because they're finding you I like how you work that in there to play old things and my number one is gonna be tying back to that so oh god I thought that was your number one okay it was supposed to be my number one okay well I was gonna tie this together but I'm gonna go ahead and separate them okay because it got mentioned already so I just figured I'd say it no I like that um as that wants to point out not just fashion when it comes to retro to revival interior design yeah textile that's a good people are really going actually back to that mid-century but I've seen a and not to be stereotypical I've mostly seen it amongst my older gay male friends their houses are decorated like the 1960s and I'm living for it and I love it and on top of that just for me can I can we get one of them to decorate our place like a dorm room but oh but the other thing too is that I've also been seeing amongst like straight white girls going for like a semi Victorian slash 40s era aesthetic and it's been just kind of this interesting thing how we are getting the retro aesthetic but it's in certain demographics you know what I mean so I'm only laughing because this recent chat comment here and I'm like if you just want to sum up the last decade of olr here it is in this chat comment from slag kick shout out to game buoy and stream parks Allah who says yay I tuned in just to hear dark soccer talk about old gay men's kitschy houses there put it put that quote on the back of the box and you know I'm right you know I'm right all right but also the retro fashion thing like I was saying I can actually go and buy flannels and jean skirts at the thrift store and dress like I did in high school okay and it's fashionable honorable mentions before we get to number ones the fall of print gaming magazines Nintendo power game Pro I think there was an official PlayStation magazine or something that all ended in this decade early this decade um honorable mention for me would be probably the accessibility of game creators on social media for better or for worse now I know this isn't unique to 2010 and this decade because Twitter technically was around what 2006 2007 but I think we've seen especially when it comes to fans making demands for better and for worse unfortunately this wasn't always a good thing and I think that's why I didn't want to put it in my top three but I think the accessibility of gaming creators on social media has been a huge part of this decade I think it's you know I think it's caused some people to listen to some things for good things sometimes and but not always so I'll just kind of leave it at that and let you draw your own conclusions so all right that in with me making friends with voice actors and motion-capped actors online because we there's good news too there's good I'm basically Facebook friends now with like with the well who we've had on the show Greg Berger he's such a nice guy oh sure and having chats on Twitter with Lady Bunny I mean mostly with Lady Bunny lately but you know um a lot of the people are like have their own you know instagrams and everything which leaves me then to my number one let's do it so here we go you'll in your opinion and you are neither right nor wrong no you're right because it's your opinion but you're not wrong you what you believe was the biggest gaming news of the decade number one truly lead out with the the whole online gaming and streaming becoming gaming celebrities people who would have been absolutely reviled when we were in middle school now doing this as their livelihood and not just that I'm getting motion capture and voice actors doing streamings of the games that they were in one of the ones I've been following is Brian Deschart who played one of the main characters in Detroit become human and his wife who played one of the Tracy androids in the game I've been watching them stream games sometimes in costume you know having our our video game actors cosplaying like the group did for Mass Effect right you know I think that that's absolutely fun and then you get to also you know sometimes you'll have them show up while other people are streaming things and you get all the tie-ins and are and it goes back to what you're saying our games are becoming and the people in them are becoming accessible it's not just oh you see some names flashing on the screen in the credits you meet these people these are real people and it becomes real to you and you see the work that they put into these games and then you see people making it their livelihood it's just like our our gaming world has become highly interactive and contrast that with the 80s when game makers were struggling to get credited remember that's how Activision sneak him in that's how Activision became a thing was because Activision was willing to release David Crane's pitfall whereas Atari never credited Howard Scott Warshaw for creating NARS revenge or et for that matter I just need to get into the we all know that wasn't as an easter egg on the credits yeah and as the credits but in the game code so you're it's come a long way it is very different now that's yeah I like that so okay so how do we succinctly put that number one is just the ability to access game creators who are playing their games and streaming their games I'd say the interactivity of gaming culture okay it's gonna be very yeah we're gonna we're gonna hear something very similar in a minute let's hear what Loki is for number one we'll do eSports because eSports is just blown up since the early I mean obviously eSports were around prior to 2010 but it's really blown up in the last 10 years so that's definitely gonna be you know my pick I definitely given to the rise of such games like fortnight's overwatch illegal legends dota counter-strike I mean there's just a lot of games that even accessibility wise you know with modern PC is a lot of them don't need a really powerful PC to run on and so you just have a lot of people getting into it and starting to recognize a lot of these teams that are being formed there's official leagues now for games and with their own you know setups in actual sports arenas and so it's very much becoming like you know the physical sports genres the fact that you can plop down in front of the television and watch a League of Legends match watch an overwatch match you might not necessarily do it on traditional TV although certainly you can we do know traditional TV well nowadays you can because you're well I mean it's not necessarily tuning in but smart TVs oh yeah twitch or mixer or what have you yeah yeah so interesting all right now I love it eSports number one the rise of eSports I think we'll be looking back at the end of the next decade and going you know what Overwatch League was kind of the start of something huge I really do so and that may not necessarily just be overwatch but it may be you know that was the first like big sports teams you know all that stuff it'll be interesting to look back on that in ten years time yeah well I think you're gonna find that all three of our number ones have a big common theme in common so I think we're on to something here because my number one biggest gaming news of the decade would be the share button that's my number one not specifically the PlayStation 4 share button although if you want to icon eyes it was something I suppose that would work but I think that just would be the ease of being able to share your gameplay with other people and the share these big professional whether it be these big professional eSports matches whether it be celebrities and game makers reaching out to their fans and celebrating the things that they've created or you know what a bunch of schmoes in their spare room talking about video games for people willing to tune up but I know we've been doing this show a long time right we've been doing this show for over 17 years and so I think we've kind of is that for repo no no I thought you're saying it was a Cinderella song okay from the 80s but I think just the fact that it's so easy to what we were we were doing this early on especially we start a podcast we were very much about trying to get the message you should apply everybody should podcast we should get more voices out there we don't remember how especially the early days of it was winger thanks Bobby okay remember the early days of podcasting we were like we don't compete with other podcasts like because there were some podcasters out there that want to make it a competition and sometimes there's a few still but for the most part it's it's not a competition it really shouldn't be a competition it should be about trying to get everybody's voices out there and getting everybody heard and people having the ability to say their opinion because gaming is for everyone and so the fact that everybody can share and you can go join whoever's couch you want and watch them play a game or watch them talk about a game or about gaming culture what have you designing costumes and influenced by games what have you I think has been the biggest thing about this decade and if you go back to last decade I would have said my number one gaming story from the last decade was the advent of Xbox Live bringing gamers together over the internet and now we go to this decade and it's about I think now kind of taking that one step further bringing strangers together over the internet into communities and like everybody's got their own community whether it be you know small tighten it and that's cool or or gigantic you know ninja type of you know communities it's all of that so what would you say then your disappointment is of the decade oh my biggest disappointment of the decade well I wasn't ready to talk about that you're going off script let's see my biggest gaming disappointment of the decade I have a couple I know it's easy I think um I think Kickstarter yeah I think I honestly that's the thing that goes to now not everything on Kickstarter has been a disaster you know I've kick-started some things such as like ant stream and so forth that have I think used Kickstarter very well but I think we've seen too many things use Kickstarter poorly I think we saw like just this rush of stuff going to Kickstarter really fast that and then people that didn't turn around the things that they were promising money for and I think people had in their mind something different so I'm not saying the news was always bad with Kickstarter but unfortunately I think we found that there's more sad face stories than good face stories so Bobby did make an honorable mention for my disappointment of the year and that's having to do Halo is a classic game but you did it for charity it was I did it for my mother and charity all of you especially someone donated 200 bucks thank you for keeping my mother fed and housed and now she has a job she can afford to live and I my mom cried on the phone thanks to you guys so that's another way that our our culture has become interactive is the fact that I did GoFundMe for that you were mentioning Kickstarter which Kickstarter also is super disappointed me because they're anti unionizing but I mean y'all y'all really came through to help out my mom and I appreciate it least I could do was do but I have a couple of disappointments one of them is that we're still talking about violence video games like it's thing oh like the way the mass media or mainstream media I don't know what it's called a blamed video games after Sandy Hook yep yep they blame everything except the fucking problem you're looking for a scapegoat instead of looking at the companies that are lining your fucking pockets the NRA is a terrorist organization leave it at that that's a the that whole scapegoating of video games is a great call-out for disappointments of the decade absolutely my other ones Bioware where Bioware is now Loki well a tie-in with where Bioware is now I would say the monetization of modern video games by somebody was gonna say this because if you want to talk about how companies are ruining the industries you can just look at all the loot boxes and the constant double dipping monetization you know taking stuff out of games that was just commonplace like cheat codes and stuff like that and selling them back to you or taking content out of games that you know in the previous version it was included with it now it's part of a season pass just all the different things that you know they're they're like well we're not raising the price of games but at the same time they're selling you a $50 season pass they're selling you costumes that got like for example my son wanted a he wanted V bucks for fortnight $25 where the V bucks you know what he bought with V bucks he bought one costume one costume was like 20 bucks in the game granted I know it's a free-to-play game but still you have like Activision stuff selling skins and stuff like that and Call of Duty for near the same price in a $60 game that you just bought a season pass for that you're also paying for the special edition and all this other shit and then they come back out with the neck you know next year it's oh hey look at this it's a new version gotta buy all that shit again because we have to sell you that red dot scope for you another $10 or whatever at least fortnight just constantly you know everything goes with you on top of that you have this I mean really it goes not to beat a political socio-economic dead horse but it all goes back to capitalism and the fact that not only are they basically draining society for all of this money that's also now while we have the gaming addiction pop in and people are spending their money on this like they're gambling but we also do have the way that these companies are treating their employees at the expense of their user base and their employees mental and physical health and they're also dodging taxes and their CEOs are getting paid millions of million dollars they're laying off thousands of people I mean it's just it's like any other big company nowadays but and the moment they try to unionize the companies are are stabbing down we've needed a video game lobby and Union for a long time the tech industry needs unions but we just had that issue with Google where they were firing people for creating a way for their employees to unionize I'm getting way off topic with this but I eat like this all sparked in my head this whole discussion because I was literally having a conversation with Bobby earlier today about a B's a b5 here in California which is the whole it's very it's a very controversial law and I think it was kind of targeting the uber and lyft thing but it's kind of having these ramifications because I actually had to go to Bobby and ask are we it just is a b5 gonna screw us because olr produces more than 35 episodes in a year in California does that make us employees because if so we're done because this we don't make money doing that you guys know that I mean you guys are very kind with your biddies but you guys know that that basically pays the cost of running a business and things behind the scene we don't we don't make money so we can't pay for things like workers comp and you know the things that I think isn't it for businesses over certain it are for contractors no it has to meet an ABC test so for vog specifically I think it we fail criteria a because vog does not mean I'm getting a little under the hood here but vog does not mandate the content that's created you all have the right to not show up for work and nothing happens you all have because it's not work exactly so and we can talk we have the freedom to talk about whatever we want so if I think for that reason it's not a registered business it is it isn't in Georgia yeah so but we're not a Californian business so but we if you have California contractors which exactly I would say we're none of those things yeah we don't have a contract sign so I don't think that really yeah so anyway but the reason why I bring that up I'm not trying to make it about us I'm trying to make it about these contractors that make games and work for things like Google and stuff this is gonna be an interest this law is gonna have an interesting kind of but I know a lot of my artist friends are freaking out because it's gonna cause jobs to go outside California because people don't want to hire like musicians that make you know little compositions here and there can't can't do more than 35 of them for a single company and that could be damning so I think the laws I think gonna get tweaked a little bit before we really see its final form but it's interesting so anyway sorry I completely derailed a little bit but it was it was the whole loot box conversation but yeah you know as season passes you know whatever you want to say there it's just other ways that they're trying to monetize games because they're saying they're not making enough money because like you look at it this way so say you have you know everybody that buys Call of Duty one year you know it's gonna buy the game the next year and say they they keep okay so if everybody buys Call of Duty one year and then buys it the next year they're making the same out profit their profits aren't going up they need to find more ways to make more money well the problem is like that it's gonna keep going up and eventually people only have finite amount of money they're not gonna be able to spend you know as much as you want them to spend so it's just it's not sustainable all right I'm psychic and chat saying I think my biggest I I'll get to you oh is he you want to read this yeah both of us because Bobby actually makes a better another point that ties into it so you go first I'll go first with psychic I think my biggest gaming disappointment of the decade is toxic gamer behavior not that it's new to this decade but we've really seen a boil over this decade and Bobby brings it out the the gamer that the behavior was always there we just didn't see it to social media and that also ties back into having that interactivity with gamer culture you also get the the CD underbelly as well well I think going back to the whole concept of the share button and again I don't literally mean PlayStation 4 share button but you know you guys know what I mean the the ease of sharing your your gameplay it's caught it's it's made the ability to make an echo chamber really really easy people don't want to learn yeah people want that confirmation bias so I mean that's why we now have a major problem with in cells with their you know rise of hate groups again because they have this little pocket in the current administration honestly enough makes it easy for them all right let's move on I want to talk about now we've talked about gaming news of the decade I want to talk about games of the decade this is here I thought we'd have a short show tonight but the single topic is taking up a good chunk of it that's good because the news we have to get through is quick so let's talk about the top three games of the decade and I know we're gonna have overlap here I'm gonna I'm trying to think I'm gonna like start with least I want to almost I almost want to like write down listen three I think dark soccer is gonna pick in the three I think Loki's gonna pick but let's see let's see if I'm right I'll be honest and let you know if I I would guess that or not we'll do three two one just like we did before so let's go around our soccer your number three game of the decade now I've got a tie here I'm gonna say portal to I would have guessed that would show up I'm only gonna pick games that I personally have played a significant amount of yes and and to be clear these are our personal games of the decade we're not wrong because there are personal games of the decade the thing is I have four I cannot pick it's hard another one well we'll give you a spot for no we're doing two three two one you don't need to pick another one one can be an honorable mention okay so portal two is number three and why oh just because it was really fun I mean the whole portal series honestly was really great but portal two took all the fun in portal and then really just like oh we know we know what jokes you like we're gonna make it even better and you have the interactivity you have a lot more history behind you know Aperture Science and you've got the old style labs and the propulsion gel it was so much fun and the dialogue was so hilarious plus I also like to to go behind the scenes and break things in it so I just found it to be super fun it was one of the ones I was the most excited for and one of the ones I have played on repeat many times so okay there it is number three portal to Loki I'm gonna go to you what was your number three best game of the decade um well this would these are all based on like the amount of fun that I had with them so let's see I'm gonna start with I guess it would yes it's a toss-up between I would have to say ingress just because I you know kind of that got me into the whole AR gaming stuff and so good flying because that isn't even on my list and you know how much I play that game yes so like I I would think because you know it not now so much but like before we're looking at the decade yeah so ingress paved the way for more yeah so like I did play that pretty heavily for a while and you know it was a lot of fun met a lot of people doing that and you know kind of snowball off into like you know Pokemon go and stuff like that but yeah so I'd say it was definitely a unique game for its time and yeah so that's okay um I mean it's a if I were to look at like games I played the most that would definitely be up there especially yesterday I know we haven't gotten into our gaming weeks yet but I played a lot of English so I played so much ingress yesterday that I actually said and I said to my chat group I said I am I am off the clock today for anger I'm not playing ingress today so if they field over the neighborhood somebody else needs to handle it because I am burned out after yesterday but I mean games are fun right yeah but I agree with you there's been so many like social elements of it that have bettered my life so you know yeah but I'm also trying to when I pick my top three I'm trying to be like half selfish half like judging the impact and artistic vision so for that reason ingress prime is kind of yeah so I there's some things where I'm like I didn't put on my top three for that reason but I get it I get what you're saying so what did I put on my top three I put as my number three game and I know there's gonna be over half a lap here so I apologize in advance I just know it like I I would like just I I'm gonna quit the show if there's not overlapping but Jamie's laughing she knows what I'm about to say my number three pick would be Mass Effect 3 for one of my games of the day is there a little overlap there yeah although we'll get to it we'll get to it we'll hold on that one so my number three pick is Mass Effect 3 and the reason why I'm saying Mass Effect 3 I'm not saying Mass Effect 2 I did decide to pick 3 specifically because I made a lot of memories with the multiplayer mode in that game for me that was what got me to play multiplayer for sure I mean I think that multiplayer was really like underestimated by a lot of the gaming public because we had that whole hubba blue about the ending and everything that was going on with that which is is actually is another reason I kind of put it on my games of the decade list I think Mass Effect 3 and that fan reaction for better for worse I I still think to this day it was a much bigger to do than it needed to be but I'm glad they did a free DLC that just expanded on it I mean I even if I don't necessarily like the how we got there I'm more than satisfied with the end product it was the game that had me running a blog for five years with 10,000 followers yeah mass effecting tumblr.com and yeah I mean is that in chat says Citadel DLC total fan service absolutely like I love the Citadel's DLC us like that one more one more for the road did you notice that the the apartment complex was called Tiberius towers no I never noticed that that's funny well you know with a reference there James Tiberius Kirk yeah so yeah so I would say yeah Mass Effect 3 just um the story was so important and the multiplayer especially in three just I think put it I realize why people prefer to sometimes but I think just that yeah I just love the multiplayer kind of puts three above two for me so there you go that's my number three game of the decade so Dark Soccer what's your number two to game of the decade Dragon Age Inquisition I played a shitload of Dragon Age Inquisition and I really love Dragon Age 2 and I really love the first Dragon Age but Inquisition it I will Mass Effect got me into modding but Inquisition was where I went nuts like even like doing a little bit of like personal modding to it myself the story was great it it took characters that I wanted to see more of and really brought them into the light it played a lot more on what I had expected about the whole you know the Dalish don't have the whole story because it's a lot like religion today people don't know they weren't there it really I liked it too because it seemed to me almost like the start I was seeing some historical corollaries to it like the beginning of the Reformation for example and how they're the the mages were rebelling against their circles and things like it was a lot more to that I really liked the commentary in it I really loved the characters I just was completely enamored with the whole game and it almost was my number one it almost truly was my number one and I every so often I get there to go back and play it if my computer would ever fucking not shut down on me you need to fix my RAM all right I'm not not totally surprised by that pick in my head it wasn't on the top three I'd written for you but now that you said it I'm like oh yeah of course she's gonna put Dragon Age in my vision up there of course so all right I know a lot of people a lot of people love the Dragon Age so I'm not surprised to hear that Loki you're number two my number two pick is gonna be the Elder Scrolls 5 Skyrim yeah that would have been on my top three for you because of mods because I have played that game so much so many times I've I don't even know how many hours I spent in that game and I would still go back and play that game again because it's a great game and I really like I'm hoping that the next game is just as good I mean really it was it's it was such a great game and yeah I mean it I don't know I bought it so many times who knows that game in many ways has lasted longer than almost any other game this decade you know like they just put that out on the switch like what was that like two years ago like if that yeah like maybe maybe it was just last year actually they put that on the switch I mean that game had an that game had the life cycle of what a console would have usually pretty much yeah I mean and yeah they're obviously the rain joke is that they put it on everything but like it's a great game and so I I don't have a problem with them doing that actually but yeah so that that's definitely gonna be my pick all right so my number two pick for game of the decade I think is going to be both surprising and not surprising at all because I think when we look back on the games that really defined and made this decade you are not gonna find a list that doesn't have Pokemon go on it and that's my number two game of the decade is Pokemon go there was nothing like that first month that Pokemon go was out it was transformative in culture it the fact that people were swarming places like old town which was struggling to get business and Pokemon go was helping the local economy that's how big this fucking game was now I realize it's not what it was then but the fact that it's still going pretty darn strongly and making as much money as it is three years after the fact I think still does leave lead something to be said but I just I think Pokemon go finally made mobile gaming really cool it really brought an experience and yes I know in believe me I know Ingress laid the groundwork for all of this but Pokemon put that Mickey Mouse-esque face on it which obviously is Pikachu is what I really mean here but it put that real mascot and it put that you know made more people kind of want to jump in and experience it for themselves and you know it was I would see these tweets that would be like I got to say for the first time ever mom I'm leaving the house and I'm going to catch Pokemon I am living my childhood dream right now do that with Dan hey I'm going out to do pokey Manning exactly and Harry Potter Pokemon go made that a reality and that's something that we had never experienced in games but now that door is kind of open and that AR gaming space has been blown open even more so and so forth and I just I just think in many many ways like no game has been as transformative I know it's interesting I'm not saying this as my number one paper it'll make sense when I tell you my number one that I don't think any game is is gonna have that kind of impact in some ways I think permanently on gaming culture as Pokemon go is had honestly so yeah that's that's it that's my pick I'm sticking to it Pokemon go my number two game of the decade um so honorable mansions before number one if you want to say all right now I'm gonna tell people why I'm not picking Breath of the Wild because I actually did not play it Dan played it I was his navigator and I'm only picking stuff that I played so as much as I love Breath of the Wild and trust me I love it I didn't play it so I'm not picking it there's oh go ahead that's I'm saying why I'm not mentioning it as my honorable mention but you had a comment oh no I thought you're oh I thought that was your honorable mention okay sorry my my own rule but odd that the danganronpa fucking love danganronpa it's just a mindfuck of a game I love danganronpa too don't get me wrong I was really into the anime though I was so hooked on just what began with the first game and it's aesthetic it was just I mean it was a really great game really engaging I really got into the characters I really cared about what happened to them except for the otaku guy who was voiced by Rama's voice actor I can't always forget his name like he's a manga artist in the game anyway but I really like that it also played up on all these stereotypes and everything in various Japanese genre you know and but otherwise it was just it was great storytelling it really brought I think spike Chunsoft a lot more into the eye of Western audiences and really I can't say good enough about it I love danganronpa there you go great any honorable mentions from you lucky yeah I had a few so like I was I'd had to say probably like call of duty my warfare 3 because I had a lot of fun that my co-workers Super Mario Odyssey was another one that I you know thought was pretty good Grand Theft Auto 5 almost was my number one just because I I I would have bet that was your number one you know why here's why cuz like I love Grand Theft Auto but I had so much more fun with Grand Theft Auto 4 than 5 because I I would still be playing for if it had in the mod if I could get my mods to be working I could play my coworkers I'd still be playing for but 5 I just got lost interest with it cuz they didn't add any expansions to it or then they have online but I just didn't really care for online too much so that's why 5 that was not really my number one it might be tied and I don't know it's pretty good but and then of course I you know I think Saints Row third or and I would say maybe like Saints Row 4 in there somewhere but God I'm so curious what number one is so yeah so that's it all right well maybe I'll knock some surprising ones out for you here so my honorable mentions would include Final Fantasy 14 around reborn would definitely be an honorable mention up there really hard not to put that on my top three but just I think the three games I picked kind of represent all something very different but you can't like we're gonna look back on this decade and look at things and I think collectively with Final Fantasy 14 realm I'm gonna include with that Diablo 3 No Man's Sky and these games that have really reinvented themselves after a launch that didn't maybe necessarily go the way that was planned which maybe is why I didn't totally feel like I should put it in my top three but I obviously I love what Final Fantasy 14 has become and so obviously it's very worthy of an honorable mention other games I would put in there Zelda Breath of the Wild Super Mario maker absolutely I feel like dreams will join this list but it's too soon I don't know what decade we're gonna get to put that in next so I guess maybe well it's coming out next in February what year was little big planet released that was is nine thousand something because I saw a little bit bent plan to talk in okay then I would say a little bit planet three well you know horrible mention you know I haven't some played it how about how about the force or how about Forza Horizon 3 it's not absolutely and yeah I think those are those are some of my games and I forgot to mention also to until dawn rush of blood because that's one of my favorite VR games I would say also I think I need to say an honorable mention Beat Saber I think you get an honorable mention as well I think and for what it's doing for VR gaming even if you know maybe VR gaming still hasn't kind of got that big inertia to go like really forward I think Beat Saber is definitely like like it's starting to you know it's it's getting noticed you know what I mean it's causing to be our thing to get noticed another honorable mention what's that Bayonetta was painted at this time was it I thought they had a two definitely was yeah why am I not thinking that Bayonetta was this decade I know sometimes it's hard to remember exactly what your things are released in so yeah I was in Japan October 2009 and North American Europe January 2010 so technically make Wow okay all right so it counts because we didn't get it until yeah that's fair yeah okay let's do number ones I'm so he'd like a lot well I I'm pretty sure I know Dark Soccer's but I'm super curious but I want to hear her talk about it because I know she loves loves this more than anything so Dark Soccer your number one pick for game of the decade Mass Effect 3 and the big reason is that not only did I you know I thought it was a great game I thought that I really it's really hard for me to put into it cuz it really got me into like the the kind of what's the word I'm thinking of like the the playing a game for the characters for the romance element for the story behind it not necessarily I mean it even had a story mode in it where you could skip the combat and just do the story stuff but don't play it that way no you do miss some stuff that happens during the combat that you want to see and you do also miss like really good items just saying you know um and also on a personal note it really got me I guess my a little bit more internet notoriety because I had Mass Effect and I still get messages from people asking me to bring it back and I'm like dude I have no content I have literally recycled the same comments over okay my blog has its own alternate universe in it now where Shepard can't drive shit and she has comments about Garris being a smartass Turian all the time and like just different things that are like not even it's more like headcanon verse it's just so crazy you know you ask somebody and I even like I don't even know how he got started on Mass Effect yeah yeah there was this blog I used to follow that kind of has an update I'm like is it Mass Effecting yeah that was mine what and but I really just kind of connected with people and Mass Effect 3 is what got me into trying to draw again because you remember I had like the 24 femshep art challenge yeah yeah yeah after I had had surgery on my wrist and I'd already had two other surgeries on my hand so drawing was hard for me and it really encouraged me to take a more realistic style and I tried to do like a little bit more realistic coloring with the characters and and just do all kinds of different stuff and it really broke me out of an art rut of course you know going back in and trying to draw my my hand still but I was live-streaming my drawings that goes back to the interactivity with community but it really brought out a lot of creativity in me it brought out I wrote fanfiction of course I also wrote this big long ass Dragon Age fanfic a bunch of them and before I even knew what the official ending of the series was going to be but people like it I still I got a favorite a thing on AO3 yesterday a kudo for a fanfic I wrote six years ago or five years ago however long it was my Mass Effect fanfiction still gets likes on it I'm like dude I haven't written anything since two years after Mass Effect 3 came out I think it's safe to say like Mass Effect kind of like you became your fandom in this decade it really really it was and I say this from my perspective too and I think you you are in the same page you and I both never never expected especially after like seeing the first game and playing a little bit of it like never thought this was gonna be a series we'd fall into as hard as we did. Thanks Shane. That's a thanks Shane game. Yes. And on top of that you know I think that at any point in the future we could say you know I really want to play Mass Effect all of Mass Effect again and you sit down and you marathon the shit out of it. Please please please if there is a deity in this in the sky or wherever this deity is we need a Mass Effect trilogy remaster for the next for PS5 X sex. Screw that I've already modded mine high res mod there's a great series of high res mods. That and Final Fantasy 13 please and thank you. The the other thing too though is that I mean it did bring about this big surge in game modding I mean I don't know if maybe Skyrim might have had the level of modding it did if not for what we had in the the Bioware games. I think modding PC games has been a thing for a very long time but sure. Well I just think that it was those Bioware games that really did it but that also kind of broke my heart over Mass Effect Andromeda I played through it don't get me wrong I it fuck you Bioware just fuck you okay screw your anthem bullshit you can take it and shove it up your ass cuz you fucked over a great series for a failure really for a failure. I I still that that rests on a board room at EA for me not so much. But Bioware was at their mercy I mean essentially now Bioware is just a subset of EA yeah and also fuck them for not giving me my Quarian DLC and I'm putting it out as a book. I mean I'm glad to get it one way or another but you're still screwing us over. We'll try to look back on the Fonder memories of Mass Effect 3 yes. Is a failure and they're a failure for making that failure. All right let's get to number ones I am dying to know this one Loki. My number one pick is gonna be of course Minecraft because it's Minecraft game it came out in 2011 officially oh yeah it's official releases into that okay yeah I see what you're doing if I can get Bayonetta all right fine it's hey it's his list yeah so minecraft because I think it was just such a phenomenal game it still is a phenomenal game and it's they just continually update it so we'll have to wait until we get a minecraft 2 but yeah hey I saw the vog minecraft account tweet the other day yeah yeah you thinking about getting back into it I yeah exactly cuz apparently hosting bedrock servers is a thing now so if anybody's interested I'm thinking about actually hosting a bedrock server because one I don't have to maintain it because that was a pain in the ass with the mod stuff but and bedrock stuffs a little bit more accessible for a lot of these folks because you don't have to have the Java client to run it you can do it with any of the console versions any of the mobile versions to all login we can all play together no matter what console you play on so that might be a thought because I was you know my I well and I'll get into it in gaming week or whatever but like my son was wanted to stream yesterday and so he did that for a little bit on minecraft but then I noticed it I'm like it's like connect the servers I'm like the realms are these realms that you want me to connect to and I was like wait a second no these are actual servers and they have like game modes and stuff like that and so I did some research like oh we can actually host my bedrock servers now and now that like playstation switch xbox are all in the same universe you might get better adoption than you had the first time where it was like you kind of had to be on pc yeah because now you can just be on anything so you might get better yeah sure that's excluding everybody that has the pc version non-windows 10 version you know from it but you can't please everybody yeah you can't please everybody so all right um okay my number one pick any guesses I already know what it is do you I do okay I'm still surprised you didn't mention any gta though he did I did my honorable mentions yeah I've been I must have been busy eating all right I already know I already know what it is okay all right we'll see we'll see if you're right or not all right uh so when we look at the games the decade in my my opinion there's one game that really just transcended I think everything else there was one game that made people question can games really be art because this guy this game and I already put that as normal mention this game let me let me do my monologue now y'all cut off we're all cut off from that and then there's one game that really made people go um our games art there's one game that took uh the concept of online gaming and put a whole new spin on it that had never been seen before there's one game that was like a painting that was moving and I think playing it I just I get I get chills just thinking about this game and the art that it is and what it brought us and I think it unlocked all these just new doors in gaming it really did and that's why my my game of the decade is journey on uh playstation 3 and playstation 4 is that what you would have guessed yes yeah no it's absolutely uh absolutely journey is the game of the decade and I think uh you know again it's the game that that has a lot of people going it wasn't that the game was was Roger Ebert still alive when that came out because I feel like that was the game that was brought to him because remember he'd written that whole piece about video games can't be art and remember how people were like okay boomer I mean they weren't saying that but it was the the 2014 equivalent of that so um and and somebody had actually brought him journey and he kind of he didn't really go back on what he said but he kind of like put out this thing that was like I see where the passion is and I see what that is all about oh shadow of the colossus thank you act f so sorry I thought for some reason it was it was um journey um and some folks uh commenting in chat uh questmaster saying for me journey feels like a very zen experience it is it's it's kind of a short game but I think that's what I mean we bobby blackwolf and I and some other folks from vogue uh and other friends of mine went to magfest a couple years ago where they did a live playthrough with a live orchestra doing the game from start to finish and you know it was only about an hour and a half or what have you but it was it was beautiful like I just I was I was moved by a fucking video game but that's the beautiful thing about this past decade video games have cemented themselves as art and I think journey is the exemplary example of that there is something that actually a little surprised you and I didn't mention although I did make a mention of it earlier was everybody's gone to the rapture I you know what I left out of my honorable mentions I was actually going to say everybody's gone to the rapture specifically to represent the um narrative gaming but you did bring it up earlier in the show at least so we haven't ignored them completely but yeah for sure but that was that because I didn't play journey I didn't have the system at the time all right I think I did but dam was monopolizing it or something and quickly while we finish this side call I want to see you guys in chat I've seen you guys been saying some things but you guys in chat what's your game of the decade I want to read some of these real quick here in a minute what's your game of the decade and why in a sentence um what oh it's you hadn't played journey yet I think is it out on pc now I can't remember um I can't play I know that they put out a few games on epic game store I think it is yeah but they also want to throw up we have a lot more mac gaming now yeah I'm pretty sure it is because I want to say yeah that came out uh um yeah see it ported to windows um 2019 of june the other the other part about journey I didn't dive into as much but the whole fact that you weren't alone in that game remember that was the twist and I think all these years later I can finally say the twist in the game is that you have somebody there with you hopefully that person may have run off on their own but you may end up having somebody with you and you don't realize it like when you don't realize that the first time you're playing it is that you think is this an npc what is this and all you can do you can't talk you can't use voice all you have is a little chirp you can do like a little chirp button and do stuff but the way you would work together with that other person some or you might not that person might run off and do their own thing who knows but when it works it works so well that you and this other person are kind of in this experience together helping each other out using your limited methods of communication I mean that is it's beautiful like and it's there's nothing like it in gaming yeah and I think that moment that moment really like when I realized this is another person this isn't just an npc this is another person at their playstation right now I have no idea who it is you find out at the end of the game but you know it's just all you know is a gamer tag I did though liken it to um the translated uh canned phrases though from final fantasy 11 because that was always something that I enjoyed was the fact that you could play with an international audience you just had to know the quirks like don't examine somebody because it means you're staring at them you know different things like that um but you uh loki weren't you talking about being able to play with people at like two in the morning yes because no one wanted to have a bard in their damn party but still I like that's another thing for the Japanese really more that we're seeing more more unique ways of communicating with people outside of our own culture yeah anyway um I want to go you're right and something like journey you did language didn't matter the game had its own language it's just god I love that game all right anyway um so um other comments from chat about games of the decade act f says pokemon go it's been a total experience throughout the years fifth dream today says file has he 14 it absorbed me and I spent so much money on earth uh johnny woofay says my game of the decade is going to kill her instinct the uh microsoft reboot I am I still play it to this day yeah that's a great fighter uh zet says last of us the storyline and the fresh take on zombies the intro had me in tears um dark tissue says breath of the wild um which I'm sure uh see it to bury oh I like this pick the jackbox party pack yes yes I that's a great pick I just I didn't even talk about it my gaming week but um because we haven't done gaming weeks yet tonight but um uh uh last weekend really I finally played party pack six for the first time in trivia murder party two so that was a lot of fun anyway but those are those are great like just instant party just play that game uh yyr says uh dance dance revolution ace and ace 20 is the game of the decade shout out to pixel poops by the way honorable mention for game of the decade anything that um had an olr stamp of approval is gonna uh be on the list there um so yeah I giggled every time I played it bobby blackwell says rock band three the peak of the plastic instrument rhythm game see I wouldn't have even thought that was this decade unfortunately it's been so long now I would have thought four was this decade but I would have thought three was the last decade I guess was it 2012 I guess it would have been about 2012 huh wow no good pick good pick or even like you know like kind of along with rock band you know one of the things I thought was kind of impactful was rock band beatles remember when they had like the trailer for them and stuff uh october 26 2010 for rock band three uh she hoax has heavy rain absolutely so great picks you guys all right wow uh so our kickoff topic only went for uh two hours give or take so finally we can get to our gaming weeks now if you want to talk about game of the year I'm actually now I'm really glad I didn't schedule those tonight because I was like well next week's probably going to be a slow news week too so we're going to give one more week for everybody to assess their game of the year this year specifically which I don't think I heard any 2019 games on the decade list so that'll still be a surprise so uh games of the year we'll talk about next week uh and the time capsule next week so uh because I anticipate next week's show with new year's eve and new year's day uh being holidays will also be a short show so we will get to those um next week well and I am going to have a weekend where I won't be her after I'm going to the women's march in san francisco you're not going to be here next weekend no I'll be here next weekend it's the weekend after oh okay I forgot to mention I'll just say it now okay no worries well find me in san francisco we're off on the 19th because that's it and I are having our anniversary so that's the same night then okay that works oh cool um so uh what I've been playing I've been playing pokemon sword I've been playing what the golf game's fucking weird but I love it yes it's like it reminds me of katamari though with its weirdness yes it makes me think of a keita takahashi game did you play wadam yet no not yet oh get on that because I can't um I've been playing uh pokemon go I like I said the other week I uninstalled uh idle pouring um I'm playing uh pocket camp playing the harry potter game I have not spent any more money on it nor will I um until rallying is dead or goes back on her turf ways um I I really that's been about it for for the gaming oh yeah I've gone back to playing patterned um because I realized that because it's on apple arcade I can play it on my mac and so I'm revisiting some of the levels that I really enjoyed in it plus they have they've released some new ones since I last completely finished the game so I'm pretty happy with it so patterned is so relaxing everybody if you just want to chill play it all right uh loki your gaming week I didn't play much of anything because it was a few things one I was the holidays there's the holidays I thought I would get more time to play games during the hall please it's more of like being a slave to the children so I didn't I did uh well we'll talk about what they played then because it was more I played pokemon go a little bit this week that's it uh but I got my youngest son wanted to get set up with playing fortnite on the switch so he can play with his brother on pc and so I set him up with that so he's now playing fortnite um on the switch and then of course he did some streaming yesterday on my channel he did some twitch streaming which I told him it's pretty hard to be entertaining but like he did okay he he that way I got the notice that your channel went live I wasn't at home yeah so so he streamed for about like 45 minutes on minecraft and so you archive your stuff yeah it should be okay I'll go back and watch it I think it's at this I think it's archived um otherwise I have a copy he's somebody in chat will say so in about five minutes why less than that watch yeah so um I did that and then um what else yeah so then um I didn't really get to play much because I I was working on my my game still which I didn't get a whole ton done with that it's more of just in the playing stage of trying to figure out how to um randomly generate rooms but I needed to figure out formatting how I want to actually set that up so that I don't just start coding and have to redo a bunch of stuff so like yesterday which is usually I have like two hours of programming time I just kind of is mainly staring at a text document and trying to like brainstorm ideas for that um I know what I want to do I just haven't implemented it yet uh but my son he's finally graduated from his yellow belt to orange belt in coding so he's doing slightly more advanced um javascript stuff now which is kind of cool and yeah there's tiger claw with the link thank you yes so so yeah there's that and um that's yeah like he wanted me he's like so well well we need to have like an intro form for me like like a youtube like a professional youtube intro I'm like I don't even have a professional youtube intro like I I don't want to like I I can't whip that together just like in a couple minutes like geez so yeah that that's he has very high expectations but um yeah that's pretty much my game week okay awesome um my gaming week uh a variety of stuff I already mentioned I played way too much ingress yesterday uh I've been playing all the other gps games too I've been playing them all uh orna has been surprisingly like taking taken off amongst the olr yes I saw that like what no no offense I love you guys I took a chill for a little bit of all the games I've recommended over the years I haven't downloaded it yet one that everybody I guess I will now since you know I don't want to I don't want to have any fomo with it so it's it's interesting I like it now I'm starting to read more about the intricacies of it and how like maybe being in a party and being power leveled was not a good idea because you kind of miss out on equipment but I'm doing okay for myself I'm still having fun that's the important part so um yeah like every time I go to a new place now I bring up orna and I'm like has the neighborhood been captured what level's the boss can I get it so uh yeah it's like really funny so um yeah it's kind of fun um let's see other games so uh on playstation I just randomly was like I'm gonna play pac-man championship edition again this or pac-man championship edition 2 because I actually like the sequel um and I once had like a top 100 score on that game it's since fallen to like top 1000 but I uh I unlocked some trophies I didn't have already because I was like oh I'm better at this game because I played it a lot on the switch so I can actually get a good score in expert mode now so I unlocked like a gold trophy for getting an a an expert I still can't get an s an expert some of it is just luck with how the ghosts fall on the rails um but uh yeah I'll keep trying on that uh I I fell victim to the playstation sale uh so uh metal mayhem if you're out there listening you want to know what games we get on sale I I bought the kingdom hearts one and two remix hd because it was down to 25 bucks I had the playstation or excuse me the kingdom hearts one remix on ps3 but I never had it on ps4 and I never did buy the second one because I said oh it's a matter of time before they put it on uh playstation 4 so I bought that um combo package it was down to 25 bucks I was like well that's a pretty darn good deal so I played a little bit of kingdom hearts one I got through I'm I'm in the middle of wonderland right now just finished the trial part of it and doing the second half so um yeah so um been playing that and that's pretty much I think that's enough for my gaming week so uh let's move on we do have some new stories to get into we're only going to do about half the stories we do on a normal show so don't worry uh some I thought tonight was just going to be a short show but now it's about the average probably going to be that average but we're not going to have as many stories as we usually do uh we're going to go to about the classic game of the week and then the classic game of the week is actually going to be like our pretty much last segment tonight if there's no discord calls tonight so um let's get to it and we're going to get to some stories because obviously with christmas hanukkah all the winter stuff being this week game game companies just really aren't working new a lot of straight up some journalist sites are like we're taking the week off like vg 24 7 hasn't published just a new story in a few days so you know everybody's taking time off for the holidays and it's deserved but there's a few things there's a few little things that we can bring up so loki we'll start with you yeah so there's a story about this guy rook brooster who is a programmer he developed the program paint.net which is like a microsoft paint type thing and um he had developed a game um at the age of 12 called the golden flute for the flute of immortality and it was a dos uh role-playing game inspired by a text adventure from uh they said 1984 instruction book on how to write adventure games so that's kind of cool um so he says he wrote the golden flute for on a tandy 1000 tl2 um tl2 which was an ibm clone computer um but the thing is though he's healing made one installable copy on a three and a half um 720k disc that he ended up packaging up and he sent to his cousin and that was it and then apparently he thought that that caught that copy was lost and there was no playable copy available well fast forward to today when um apparently there was somebody that got a hold of a version of the game uh the streamer by the name macaw who he streams these old dos games and so he played apparently the golden flute for on december 23rd and so uh he of course the developer reached out to to the guys see you know how he got a copy apparently it was apparently part of this uh cream of the crop cult shareware compilation that was put together in 1994 and then apparently they said a copy of it also was on phyto net so not sure how that ended up on part of that shareware compilation but that's how they found it and so you know i don't know if he's able to get the original copy of the disc but yeah uh dart to see it says i thought this was amusing because i've seen the streamer before and this is totally the sort of thing he plays old pc games from all over the world oh yeah i can imagine you know and they used to sell those collections were a dime a dozen back in the oh god yes yeah you could just and so this person probably just had like a truckload of floppies yeah they used to have like a walmart like a thousand game collections and stuff like that back before it was just all clone games it was like just like scraping the internet of like all these freeware games and stuff or all these shareware games man i remember used to go into like my local video rental store and they had a a wall of shareware stuff and just go through like each one's like a buck you know and you get of course with shareware stuff it was like you know oh cool i get the share a copy of wolfenstein 3d it's still a full game it's just you know it's a quarter of the uh one fourth of a full game and then the closest thing they have to now would be like the the telltale model or like the first yeah so it is free or like life is strange i think they give the yeah something like that i guess but like it still felt like a full experience even with like the shareware stuff um and a lot of that you know they were encouraging you that they wanted you to share it and you know if you wanted to buy the full registered copy then you could do that um but i got my hands on like a lot of like software and stuff that way and go to these like computer show and sales and stuff they have you know pirated stuff but you know you you could also get like a lot of these shareware discs and collections that's cool yeah yeah i remember a lot of that i would just log on to all the bbs's and download all that too yes all right anyway uh that's really cool though for that author that uh suddenly this game you wrote all these years ago is uh suddenly being played on stream and uh earlier on the bobby blackwolf show on little tossover call we found out that bobby blackwolf once wrote a bbs door game and now we've made it our mission to find it because we want to play it so come to find out there have been several wrestling uh bbs store games he's already on the hunt so we'll see we'll see what we come up with all right anyway uh let's go on move on talk about splatoon 2 i now here i thought splatoon 2 was kind of done with because they they were done with us i thought they were done with updates and everything i thought they were totally done because the splatfest were done and so it was kind of like the end of the cycle maybe we'd be lucky and hear about a um splatoon 3 but uh apparently no more updates are coming on the japanese splatoon twitter account they mentioned that there is a new balance tweak and uh bug fixes happening actually they didn't say what it is but people are just assuming it's those things but there is a patch coming uh on january 5th through 6 somewhere in that time frame just depending on where you are in the world and there will be another update in april so splatoon 2 and it's the lights have not dimmed over there yet i'm sure there are people still playing that game it is a lot of fun the concept of paint as a shooter is an awful lot of fun i do hope they end up putting out another game in that uh series um but it's nice to see that the second one is still being supported nintendo has been very good about supporting their games way after the release uh because you know mario maker got that huge update with the zelda stuff not that long yeah i mean i i'm curious to see what more they're going to release it i'm so surprised with mario maker too that they didn't do the amiibo support like i feel it's just like very like strange yeah we never even you know what we got on the tangent we never even got to address the whole like physical dlc when you were talking about that stuff we never got to talk about amiibos games the toys to life stuff or toys or what they call the ed toys life yeah that was a trend well yeah but yeah i actually like the figures but it's kind of gone away though aside from amiibos it's like amiibos are still there but not nearly like what they were i still see that like um star link stuff being sold at like i thought like a collector's edition game something i'm not buying that i hear it's pretty good i don't know all right anyway uh moving on dark sakura well i like to to focus on the human element when i can um there is a 12 year old boy named rome i'm gonna steal one of these candies okay well we still got a thank you see who's taking home yeah um but uh a boy in florida decided to make a video game it's called please listen it's a video game for blind and visually impaired children and um although i kind of laugh at his quote he says i learned that it's actually harder to make a game than you think it took me about one to two weeks blank blank wow um he said i was closing my eyes going through the levels seeing if they work or not so basically um he also had severe hearing loss as a as a child still wears hearing aids and he didn't learn how to speak until he was three so um he actually verbalized in in the game used his voice as the guiding element in the game and apparently it was a really big uh just step out of his comfort zone for him to do this for people and it was really good um but yeah the game is called please listen if you can find it please share it with everybody and again the things i the things i did when i was 12 and look at what this kid is doing it's amazing i played i beat the guardian legend when i was 12 was that was that around the year of the year final fantasy 2 in america which we all know was actually four was that that year i think it was do you think i was 11 or 12 when i beat the guardian legend yeah because i'm i'm old er it's all good all right let's move on uh loki all right so we we've talked about how there were some issues with fallout 76 and being able to spawn objects into the world from link fallout 4 so uh kind of along the lines of that the same um set of uh kind of hackers that were behind that sort of exploit now um had also found a way to basically loot other players in game so you could actually at a distance loot somebody and steal all their inventory including their pip boy because technically that's an object and so that was a problem that was going on for a while and then of course now bethesda's allegedly patched that out but you know the fact that you had people afraid to play on multiplayer through fallout 76 because you could just have your inventory taken by somebody that you don't even see uh at any given notice um was kind of surprising so of course they said you know we want to apologize for those who were impacted by this exploit uh we want to make this right and we are currently looking in the ways that we may be able to compensate you meaning that you're not getting your inventory back i don't want to sound like one of those gamers and and i might add so this is going to be great to to add to the uh fuel to the fire the items that they also were able to take included items that you purchased from the atomic shop premium currency items that might not even be tradable okay sorry all right no no you're fine i'll just say i don't want to sound like one of those gamers but i'm a little bit surprised that um that fallout 76 is like still going yeah i know that sounds really bad because it hasn't been out that long but just well they still have their dog major update coming out for with the mps and everything and i'm just waiting for that to crash and burn because oh boy every patch that they seem to put out there it breaks more stuff all right well let's talk a little bit about uh something that i think would have been really cool and some people would really like to see but it's not happening uh unless maybe you make a ruckus now i don't know but uh apparently at one point there was a xeno saga uh hd remaster that was being a planned uh so katsuhiro harada uh who is general manager at bandai namco has uh talked about on twitter uh answering a question saying this actually progressed to the remaster's plan but failed in a profitable market analysis sorry guys this plan will be difficult to resurface so um but i mean at least he's reading twitter so be nice don't be mean but maybe xenosaga fans if you really want that hd remaster you got to speak up because they just don't think the sales are there they think they might put all this energy into it and then they're not going to see the sales you know these things are cheap they're not free so um you know maybe there's a compromise to be made here maybe they can't upscale the whole thing in hd but maybe they could do some type of re-release of the classic games that you know are just you know uh have some a little bit of work done on them maybe not a lot of work so i don't know but so it'll be nice to see um what do you hope we see you know i know earlier in the show we kind of talked about some um hd remaster wishes i feel weird calling hd remasters because some of these games we're talking about are hd games but some um some upgrades some new polish on old games you'd like to see in the next generation of gaming for playstation 5 and x x series x uh wave what would you like to see so i mentioned a little bit about um i talked about the uh mass effect trilogy i'd like to see for sure uh and um the hell did i just say oh fantasy 13 and that whole trilogy i'd really love to see as well come back um as far as a remaster or remake i would like to see saints row one and two uh being remastered uh would be kind of nice especially one because uh one a lot of people didn't get to play that because it was only on xbox 360 um i would like i'd still like to see like a like an enhanced version of oblivion 2 would be kind of cool i thought that they were going to do that um but apparently not um some comments in chat um swang tong says uh metal gear solid one uh dj rama s to just rival schools yes quest buster says it would have been nice to have a xena saga remaster but i can understand that they might not go for it it's pretty neat series that had to recover after xena saga 2 yeah uh bobby says whatever we all know you just open the project in unity go to compile set the new target to xbox one or ps4 and ship it i mean and just be sure to turn up the graphics on level three while you're there with that big dial that says graphics on it i mean yeah absolutely yes but you put it in that new um i forgot their new high-end shaders called preheat the oven to 350 put it in for 30 minutes and you're good all right anyway let's move on dar soccer what do you have next for us well speaking of more of uh i would say another benefit for video games and i'm not going into like the educational things although this is a kind of education um this is a game that teaches mindfulness and mindfulness has i think been a big trend in the last decade or so but people don't really understand enough about it it's really centering yourself bringing your attention to your breath um cutting you know it's it's like a guided meditation of sorts um and people who practice mindfulness have generally been uh they they learn better they are calmer they have less stress in their lives you know which and also affects of course the body because body and mind are connected um so it's a a research team at the center for healthy minds at the university of wisconsin madison and at uc irvine university of california irvine have developed this game and it's called tenacity and it was designed for middle schoolers and all they have to do it's it's a tablet game um the one i'm seeing i think they're doing it on ios um but what they do is that they go through breathing exercises with relaxing backgrounds you know like greek ruins or space or something and so they tap their breath on the screen and every fifth breath they double tap and so it's meant to have them pay attention to their breath and to how they feel to progress through the levels and instead of teaching a particular concept as it's teaching mindfulness they've actually shown that um these uh that the game is improving their ability to learn their ability to pay attention um and with that mindfulness they're able to to train their brain to um to uh connect more with the world around them and one thing about this that they learned in their research is that and i'm going to go a little bit into the the physiological on this one but it improves the connection between their left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the left inferior parietal cortex of the brain which are the areas that control your attention so um by changing the those aspects of the brain they are able to focus more on the attention at hand um they had a another group as sort of like their control that was playing fruit ninja they had none of those none of those developments so training their attention in such a relaxing way has been well first of all it's been great for the kids it also shows that if we don't take that time to pay attention to our breath to the world with even to the people around us then we're damaging ourselves in the long run um am i oversimplifying by saying this game sounds a lot like it's like the watch app that encourages you to breathe you know it's very similar it sounds like a gamified version of that in a way yeah you know it's very similar yeah like even for like adults they say you know you should take a minute to really pay attention to your breathing you know because that can you know help you stress relax you know anxiety you know flare-ups and things just stopping to breathe is so important well and i will tell you something um at work we had a mindfulness challenge which i want a blanket yay um but you had to use the breathe app 10 times a day for at least 25 days in the month right and i that was to get the gold level which i got because i'm an overachiever when it comes to breathing um and i have to say that it was having those moments to myself and tuning out things around me really made me a lot more present in my life and i think i was under a bit less stress since it's been i did it in october and i got out of the habit of doing it and i've been getting myself back into the habit of it and i find this is gonna sound like maybe a little bit of craziness because i've had some attention span problems before because i'll get overwhelmed by certain things um but i have actually found my ability to tolerate crowds has been a little bit better while i maintain mindfulness um and this is gonna sound like a completely dumb thing but i don't want to look at my phone as much does that make sense oh absolutely when i'm out with people i think now unless i have to check on something specifically or get like a message from dan or something i don't have my phone out um i notice as i've been getting older and maybe it's because i don't do those activities like some of those things have been getting worse for me like claustrophobia issues do you remember at the very first gamer x when i had that full-on panic attack yeah that has never happened to me ever but and what happened guys is that i wasn't there that one but i knew about it okay yeah what happened is it was nothing to do with the con itself it was fine but what happened was that it was just very very crowded and we were in that kabuki hotel which is kind of got it's got like a low ceiling because you know san francisco architecture big city architecture things you know old school like all these panels kind of all let out at the same time and it was really like packed in like there's just people everywhere and just all my brain for whatever reason just decided to go hey what are you gonna do if a fire happens right now and i just started freaking out and they thank gosh luckily staff knew what they pulled me back into the panel room that i had just left and i had a moment to be able to kind of like okay i'm away from people i'm away from people and like stop for a minute but it was like i'd never experienced anything like that in my life that i i will tell you this right now welcome to how autism feels except it's more of the sense of overwhelming it's not like panic like that but it's very similar um for me i get tunnel vision um i have found that my ability to deal with the things that overwhelm me like people talking at the same time because then i'll stop hearing words and i'll hear like the trombone parents from the peanuts cartoons you know but i would actually challenge everybody um to spend a little bit more time being mindful doing your breathe app just take you know a few minutes and listen to yourself breathe count your breaths but then i'd like for you to go after that and do a task that you do every day like try playing a puzzle game play something complicated um incorporate your mindfulness into a daily walk but see how much better you do at the things you love and i'm glad that they're doing this for these kids i wish that this was a widespread program because i think that if they'd had something like this when i was in school that wasn't fucking nap time i think i might have i mean i was bored i'll just admit it i was bored in school but i think i might have found the things i was doing more interesting if i could pay attention to them some interesting comments in chat marissa our friend of the show here uh says tenacity apparently isn't available to the public yet but i dig my muse headband for mindfulness and my add adult brain so um you know even though this game isn't widely available uh certainly other folks kind of have their own techniques or um you know we mentioned this is kind of based on a watch thing so if you're a smart watch i mean i know apple watch is what i have and there's one built into it i'm sure android has to have something similar like they've all got to have some type breathing uh but i know i know smart watches are a luxury so if you don't have that you know i'm sure there's computer programs that will kind of help you with you know taking a moment to stop and breathe and all that good stuff marissa does point out our i love i love marisela so glad you're in there mindfulness is a big aspect of many newer therapies or spin-offs of cognitive behavioral therapy which again for me as an autistic person i've had to go through a bit of cognitive behavioral therapy myself um after i lost both of my grandmother's back to back i went into hardcore therapy because i was having not just my um my meltdowns for autism i was having panic attacks on top of it they do feel completely different um and yeah marissa also points out 10 happier i've used that too and um it's i don't prefer a guided meditation i'll be perfectly honest i would rather do something that's from my own mind but i will tell you this bringing it back to video games is why i say try this i was getting really frustrated i don't even remember what game i was playing at one time but i was getting super frustrated with not being able to do like one little task in it and i had gone off and did like a bit of mindfulness just because i was so pissed off i just needed to calm down and went back and did it right after that no problem no stress it's amazing what a little bit of mindfulness will do uh sj100 matt says my girlfriend teaches mindfulness with the fifth graders uh it helps a lot of her students calm down in stressful situations so uh and sj100 matt continues that i sleep with a white noise machine and focus on my breathing if i have a hard time sleeping well you're probably doing it the better way because i'll just take a melatonin so yeah i actually sleep with uh an air filter on um because and earplugs because dan snores but um i i i have done other levels of biofeedback marissa brings up doing biofeedback um but i mean it's just amazing i mean well even so our technology just is again in the past 10 years that we've had these therapies incorporating with technology and gaming to make these breakthroughs for people i think it's pretty amazing what a world we live in all right well let's go ahead and move on we have just a couple more stories for you guys before we get to the classic game of the week i think we're going to do one quick email tonight as well and then i'll try to squeeze in a call or two although alan wants to start dinner about 8 45 so we're running running out of time um but that's we'll get through these last few stories here real quick so loki so really quick mega man x dive um which was a co-op multiplayer game that was coming to mobile devices has been delayed now to 2020 and it they basically said it was supposed to be slated for late 2019 but the game is now uh slated for the first quarter of 2020 due to the process of optimization well i'm all for games getting delayed but i still don't know how i feel about this on mobile but we'll see it looks kind of me was reserved judgment until we can play it so get it as good as it can be right sure sure all right um hey speaking of getting to try something before it's out maybe uh there's apparently a leak out there showing that a final fantasy 7 remake demo is coming uh this is there was a tracking website that kind of checks like what's going on on the stores uh like playstation store and stuff uh and this website game stat which is the same place that found the resident evil 3 remake stuff um it actually found that there is a final fantasy 7 demo that was lurking there on the playstation store which would be interesting because i think a lot of us discovered final fantasy 7 the first time through those demo disks and things of that nature so it would be an interesting throwback yeah see some of that like pop up in a demo uh that would be available on the store that would be pretty cool so um we'll see uh if it's going to be confirmed i imagine it'll be in the next couple weeks because the game is out in march believe it or not here we go it's like it's like the little joke bumper at the beginning said march 2020 is coming all these big the animal crossing final fantasy doom all these big 2020 is going to hit the ground running you guys so here we go all right let's move on uh to one more story before our classic game of the week dar sakura well um and this has been making the rounds i'm sure people know about it by now but there was a prototype of a canceled akira game um that was supposed to be out on the sega megadrive known as the genesis in the us um and it was recently discovered um it was it's been dumped online um the thing you can go download it um but it was uh made by a company called black pearl software that was going to be working on one for the uh game boy the snes uh sega game gear sega genesis and sega cd the games were not finished there were screenshots back in the day um but the publisher thq uh basically said nah they didn't do it um but it's been uploaded now to uh the hidden palace it is incomplete it cannot be played start to finish but you can play individual stages it does have a stage select it looks actually pretty good it was supposed to have different genre like a motorcycle racing level like road rash um and then a first person while tetsu was escaping it's kind of like doom um there was going to be a shooter platformer stage kind of like flashback in the sewers a hoverbike stage um an isometric shooter stage where uh tetsuo has to fight off the soldiers with his psychic power and a final stage that isn't complete that has uh kaneda fighting tetsuo so um it it looks really cool i've i've seen some of it in motion i don't know why but i mean we are supposed to be getting a live action akira movie and uh an anime series which hopefully follows the manga closely um so shrug emoji that's a good way to sum up considering that was our official like last story of the year and last story of the decade i think this is a great way to just sum it all up shrug emoji that's how i feel right well on that note let's go back to a simpler time when there there were there were no emojis believe it or not well maybe i don't know or there was only wing dings there was no emojis only wing dings it's the classic game of the week dark soccer is going to walk into the gaming vault email first oh you want to do the email first yeah why not yeah sure i'll do the classic game we're already here yeah we're already here we'll do uh email during listen round table so classic of the week let's do it uh dark soccer is going to jump into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks hey you should play this game moldy oldie this is this is a very interesting that has lived longer than you realize i picked minesweeper and i'll tell you why i picked minesweeper because a co-worker and i we have a video of somebody playing minesweeper and it's like sped up but it's like the world's biggest minesweeper board and the music on this one is a piano version of flight of the bumblebee i i know i stripped it but i'm just saying i thought it was funny yeah it is um but anyway it's a single-player puzzle computer game you are meant to clear out a rectangular board that has hidden minds without activating them but you have to mark which one's which the game actually originates in the 1960s which was built for old mainframes pretty cool huh i would have thought it came from like penny press magazine type of stuff i would have thought maybe this was like a pen and paper game at one point interesting this was a this was a mainframe game and of course since then it's been on every version of windows forever yeah there is one in windows 10 that has like achievements and stuff i haven't played it um but the reason we got on the subject is because um at my job we work on max and um someone's like how are you playing minesweeper on your eyes like i got it in the app store there's minesweeper in the app yeah it's not just owned by microsoft blah blah blah you know um but at any rate it was one of the earliest mainframe games in the 1960s and 70s the earliest ancestor of modern minesweeper was a game called cube not to be confused with a really weird movie series um and it's basically really became one of the most popular puzzle games out there there's other versions called mind out by quicksilver in 1983 yomp by version interactive in 1983 and then cube cube was succeeded by relentless logic or r logic by conway conway hung and smith and it was for ms das as early as 1985 where you took the role of a private and u.s marine core uh core to deliver uh messages and you had to basically sweep for mines you had different ways to navigate through it and you had to go in a particular direction it wasn't necessary to clean out the non-mine squares so it was a little bit different it kind of played on the the uh minesweeper type there also were other mechanics of minesweeper that were included in other games for example there was vine sweeper that was incorporated into runescape who remembers fucking runescape um and it was just a little you know mini game that was included in there and then mole control that came out on pc it was developed by remode um you had a minesweeper mechanic that was integrated into the puzzle game in a village called molar creek that had moles everywhere so basically you were mole sweeping i guess so as far as other versions um it's been bundled on operating systems for ages um there was minesweeper for os2 um there was minesweeper for windows k mines uh in kde which is uh a unix os um gnome mines and gnome uh mine hunt in palm os so there who remembers palm os um the hp 48g graphing calculator had one called mine hunt um where you had to navigate from one area of the play field to the other by navigating the mines voltorb flip mini game is in the non japanese releases of pokemon heart gold and soul silver as a variation of mines minesweeper and p cross you have a logic puzzle version of minesweeper that you play on paper that has some squares already revealed but you can't reveal any more squares you have to mark the ones you think is it's an interesting so that's what i'm thinking of that's where i figured it would have started um but these um were uh i'm trying to see uh the puzzles appeared under the name uh tentai zoo which also means star map in southwest southwest airlines magazine spirit 2008 2009 um uh in minecraft uh for the 2015 april fool's update the love and hugs update added minesweeper which is a near exact copy of minesweeper except instead of avoiding the mines you have to avoid creepers um it uh now as far as its computational complexity in 2000 richard k published a proof proof meaning like a theoretical mathematical problem i guess it's hard to describe that it is an mp complete to determine whether or not a given grid of uncovered correctly flagged and unknown squares the labels the foremost also given have an arrangement of mines which is possible within the rules of the game so basically he's mines mine uh minesweeper as his proof also he proved that infinite minesweeper is Turing complete so um but at any rate uh this video is about to end sadly so anyway the game is minesweeper it's been around since the 60s so there's there's some people in chat saying i don't understand this game i don't know how to play this game so the numbers are showing you how many mines are touching that square exactly and so you have to use logic powers to deduce where is the mine by looking at the surrounding numbers and sometimes it's just luck and sometimes it's just dumb luck but that's the ones that are like if you get like a five usually what i do is i count the spaces so if i say that i have one that's got a one all around it yeah or or maybe like a one like so you've got a corner piece and you have a one above it and a one to the to the left of it then that i that means then the the that one is attached to the one in between those so the one that is directly the left diagonal that's an example yeah so and in that video which i guess i can bring up again here real quick i'll restart it from the beginning when you see these big areas get uh uh explored at once that's because it's zero so zero will automatically because if it's zero it automatically clicks everything around it because zero is going to be safe so the empty squares are zeros basically they just don't say zero uh and then he's putting in flags as he goes to mark where the where it could be yeah uh and you can do a question mark where you think one might be so you can go back and explore it later um and as that said the number tells you how many lines yeah but was that said oh i wanted it to end when they hit a bomb spoiler alert he ends up beating the puzzle he gets the whole way this is like a world record attempt yeah uh he wouldn't have put it on youtube if he didn't um but the big prize you get for winning the windows 3.1 version that little smiley icon way at the top wears shades that's it that's what you get for winning shade emoji this ain't solitaire with the fancy you know card with the bouncing card and all that stuff but at any rate this is i mean yeah it can really piss me off sometimes but it's another one of those games that i play to focus on something else because it's i do this with actually i do it with patterned and i do it with solitaire that it's i can devote one part of my brain to this so that the rest of my mind can focus on what i'm hearing i do it when i when i was in class that's why i do a doodle or play another game while i was in class so there you go we had to mention minesweeper at one point or the other it's a good pick to end the decade on i mean even though it's not from this decade it's still one of those like oh yeah hell lots of people play minesweeper at some point so even if you didn't understand it it was in your windows 3.1 or windows 95 computer so you probably booted it up at some point what's this i suck at this but uh maybe one day i'll do a emacs tetris oh a minesweeper stream that'll be fun no you know what i'm i'm sad about now is it the last os release emacs tetris is no longer available did you ever know about that sorry i'm distracted so i'm actually watching alan use his brand new instapot that he got for the holidays for the first time i know it played little songs when you take the lid off and on yes my washer my dishwasher does that it plays shoe bear when it's done i have one of the uh uh samsung dishwashers ask alan there's one microwave at work that plays a little song when it finishes is it a samsung i don't know but it's there's like five microwaves up there i will only use the one that plays the song check and see if it's a samsung because apparently samsung appliances including their washing machine and dryers all play this one shoe bear piece interesting when they're done huh okay all right anyway anyway let's move on we're gonna get to the listener round table i'll see if we have anybody in discord here but first i think we have an email that we want to do actually we do and it's our last email of the last email of the year last email of the decade all right hello lr we know who this is i've decided to take a few minutes breaks from spinning like a top trying to get ready for magfest so here i am in text form it's yyr by the way if you haven't already guessed first i wanted to extend a little offer to me to jamie to me i always love hearing about food on the show and i love me some potato latkes but i was disappointed to hear that used a box mix making them from scratch takes more time but it's super easy the final product tastes way better all you have all you need is a blender and i have a peeler and some potatoes a big onion some flour eggs oil and salt if you're interested i'll send you my mom's recipe i promise that you won't regret it i do know how to make latkes from scratch i've made latkes from scratch it's much easier to bring the box mix over here when you're making latkes in somebody else's kitchen yeah to be fair she's making them in my kitchen during the show so i think that's why she cuts corners and it's okay i will say they were still good to me your counter space hey alan did a great job this week to make room for the new pot so there is that but i'm just saying i know not much space to prepare um but i will take the recipe because i love recipes um i actually want to do latkes in a waffle iron i think that'd be cool be fun lastly i wanted to extend an offer to all of the listeners as initially promised i'll be at super magfest 2020 indie showcase come on by and i'll try the latest versions of super multitasking and sharpshooter plus i'll be selling them in a bundle along with falling plus all for just five dollars but if you mention olr it's yours from easily two bucks i hope you'll enjoy playing the games saying hello and saving a few dollars too thanks as always for putting on the show have a great week hopefully with less craziness than mine now back to testing equipment and loading the car hugs erin yyr we love you yyr um and since i just saw yyr last month here's the thing if you go find him at magfest and ask nicely for a hug and you give yyr a big hug you will kind of be hugging me because i just hugged yyr last girl so has paper stuck to its butt i mean technically the back of its leg allen can you what what did mr smoosh's stupid ass do now all right oh my god the way allen just picked him up it's great laser cat camera he picked up the cat by the pew pew pew can you do that do it uh oh uh oh smoosh laser beams all right anyway oh yes yyr's email yes please go give yyr a big hug at a magfest and tell them olr sent you and you get a discount everybody's saying this that poor cat he likes it he loves the attention don't even don't even do that all right uh anything else there's gotta be more email right um uh no that was it oh all right well have fun at magfest all you who are going i really wish i could join you this year um maybe next year because the work stuff is different now and i'll actually have time off available uh and as long as finances are in the right place that's the big thing because we might we might try to buy a house next year and that will screw our finances i'm sure so it just it all depends near me i don't know what class i'm supposed to be oh in orna yeah okay like everybody's a fucking magician so don't be a magician okay that is a musician passion a magician you're a magician i'm a magician everybody's a fucking magician so literally you're anything else all right it'll be really easy to get armor too a rogue okay all right anyhow moving on um oh my god everybody chat bg realness i started orna fifth dream i'm rogue where's the i should see what level i am because i was 52 i'm gonna get the fucking orna when you add me here i kind of like the way the thief looks over the warrior so i'm gonna go with thief jesus christ all right um i know is that is that rob what have you done what have you added to the party on thursday this is the first thing that isn't shane's fault okay that's fault i'm 53 all right anyway holy shit there's a lot of people around if you want to send us an email in a future week participate at orange lounge radio.com is the place to send us an email and sadly i don't think oh we have we have one call in the green room okay this is always a good call so let's get to this and then we'll wrap up for tonight so hi you're on orange lounge radio who's this jim sally jim sally how are you my friend it's good to hear from you oh brother it's great to hear i am so glad for we had minesweeper tonight as the old school cave of week i owe my life to minesweeper dark sakura you have no idea i owe my life to my first off first off i want to tell every single one of you motherfuckers out there there is no random pieces in minesweeper until you get to the very very little piece at the end and sometimes fuck you you'll get through a hundred goddamn fucking mines in the last two it's left to right you got to pick left or right you know what i mean it's one day one day jim sally 20 fucking years ago was playing minesweeper at a sausage factory just killing time on the night shift hoping no one catches me and i'm getting right to the end of a fucking hundred bomb it's been a while since i beat one right and i'm right at the fucking last two squares knock knock on the door it's my fucking foreman ah shit pokes his head and what are you doing said i'm playing minecraft he takes a look at the screen and just jumps back how did you get that many mines done i said i don't know man i got one more to go and i clicked i got lucky i clicked and i saw that number one right there oh i beat it hey smiley face look at that oh fuck a week later a week later i come into work i find out the promoter needs a weekend uh smokehouse operator it was 27 dollars an hour all the overtime i could have because he thought i apologize for the laser beam noise that was on jim sally's side sorry buddy oh uh jim sally if that happens one more time i think your connection is going bad okay he's listen so i find out a week later that this guy gives me a promotion to part-time weekend smokehouse operator because he thinks i'm a computer genius because i beat minesweeper therefore since these new smoke houses will be run on computers we definitely should hire this kid you know what we can improve our talents in the weirdest ways we really can like um it was because of this show um an old boss of mine found out that i did all this like youtube production and stuff on the side and they were like why don't you get into doing more like e-learning type of development and that moved me into that type of role which is really where i'm still working to this day so it's just kind of funny how things can kind of play into play into things like that i'm just giggling because you were working at a sausage factory playing this is it wasn't just that you were playing minesweeper you were playing it at the sausage factory hard jim sally worked hard for five six years at that sausage factory that it paid for my first house got me my first wife i still have my first wife by the way don't kid yourself people who would who would want to leave the gym what is jim sally speaking speaking of enjoying what is jim sally dude if you come down to toronto pride man let's let's do to toronto pride i haven't been to toronto pride in two or three years i miss it i should go back again it's the most festivist time in the entire canadian history like it's better than christmas i'll come down and say it's better than christmas i'm fairly confident it's going to happen the only thing i started to look at like flights and for some reason that weekend is way more expensive than any other weekend um and i don't know what you know about pride or what man they know about pride man it's great you've never been man trust me it's the best yeah i it's the best well i've been every other year i've been to like chicago pride i've been to sf pride they're all the same weekend so yeah i've got i really want to try toronto out uh vg realness is asking is jim sally from toronto no you let you live out in canada like you live in rural most people right well he'll actually know like so i dude i grew up in kitchener brother so i'm i was right i was like an hour down down the highway from toronto i got lots of family in toronto now i live eight hours north of toronto i actually i actually know where kitchen i know where kitchener is because i had another friend that was from there dude probably yeah there's your city water louise right there right that's the big bill gates university canadian university it sits right inside the town i used to live in i used to feed those kids harvey's hamburgers man all day long man i know that you get the harvey's hamburgers with the ketchup chips or you can get the all dress chips i always prefer salt and vinegar did you just say you live eight hours north of toronto now i live eight hours north of toronto wow like it's it's like like when i talk about living in the like the queen's bequeathment i'm not kidding man like last year we had two bears coming to our house at the same time all year long oh my god like and it like we got to know them it gets really like it gets really creepy out here man did you see did you see at the beginning of the show by the way vg realness got us a canada care package did you see that i did i saw the whole thing that i was freaking out man all of the goodies in there man i can't believe some of the goodies that we have that you don't have man but they're we're chowing down americans have there's a lot of goodies you know what you know what you know what i like that america has that i can't get it and it's up or maybe i'm not supposed to talk about it because it's not good for the show but i miss them damn delicious american cigarettes man jesus christ oh cigarettes cigarettes are getting harder and harder to come by more and more people are quitting and it's getting harder and harder to smoke but uh yeah good there you are man but that's why it moves where i move man because no one gives a shit out here yeah all right jesus well jim sally that we've got a lot of noise in the kitchen so it's getting harder to um hear you so um i got i gotta wrap up but do you have a final thought to leave our folks with or this year final final thought before before we go before we go people people listen insta pots are great but mom mama mama don't make her world famous pot roast insta pot she makes that thing the goddamn dutch up like supposed to good night people good night always a pleasure to hear from jim sally now i've got to make this toronto thing happen i apologize i do see someone else in the green room but i apologize i have to kind of start to move to wrap up the show tonight um but please uh consider sending us an email or uh other stuff next year we're going to start to open it up more we're going to incorporate more twitter and other types of interactivity into the show um just to you know make sure we're hearing from everybody um but as we say towards the end of every episode of orange angio don't forget to tell a friend or two about the show help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice but if the voices aren't here to put out on the air then uh we don't have them we need to hear from more people so um help us spread the word there was an awful lot of you tuning in tonight would have been a a light night i don't know if we got a raid or something because the alerts are very subtle at the bottom of the screen but i'll look a little later um but i just want to thank everybody that tuned in and uh was watching tonight i will check to see if we have any last minute stories kind of doubt it but you never know okay that was a slower news week um hey have a great new year everybody uh be safe and you're celebrating uh i shouldn't have to lecture you if you decide to indulge on substances on new year's eve do not drive use ride share that's what it's for or taxi if you want to be old school whatever just make sure you are not operating a motor vehicle while on a substance um but have a fun

sedated nothing to do nowhere to go all right let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts of the decade um my final thought is um just a real genuine heartfelt thank you to everybody who's who's listened to the show for the decade you know whether you just found us maybe everybody was just part of the decade if you just found us a year or so ago or so i just really appreciate you spending your sunday nights with us or time during the week with us in your commute at work while you're working at your desk wink uh or whatever it is that you're doing uh when you're listening to olr i just i just really appreciate you guys giving us the motivation to keep doing this actually i would like to say sure you can follow up three no name three things that you've accomplished this decade that you're proud of three things that i've accomplished this decade that i'm proud of uh while i have the show on the mind i would definitely say the opportunities that have presented themselves at dragon con with getting to um host panels about podcasting and be accepted as a um professional i think is a huge thing so that would be one this is very adjacent but it's still super important to me um i would say would be when i got to do the panel with um barry bostwick uh patricia quinn and little now because obviously i grew up on the rocky or picture show and to get that opportunity to let be in the same room with them let alone sit at the same table as these people was was huge for me and i'm just so thankful for that opportunity um i would say maybe three would be some of the things that i've done in my career that i don't talk about here on the show uh as much but um i think i've had a lot of growth uh from where i was at the beginning of the decade to where i am now uh i've had a lot of professional growth in 10 years and that's just looking to keep on getting better so um it's very exciting stuff loki what are your three my three for this year for the decade for the decade oh i don't know i had kids okay that's an accomplishment that is an accomplishment uh nelly did more work he's he's he's shared in the raising he's i'm just giving you a hard time i um got a ddr machine and i've started several games i would i would say it's not just i mean not that you know it's your it's your question to answer but not just you doing the coding and learning how to do all that but you've gotten kids into it and i think that's well one kid so far kid yeah still still all right time to turn the tables dark sakura i have lost a hundred and twelve pounds yeah um you you were there for the big day of that journey it was very frightening but i i really thank you for being there with me because dan could get off work and my last picture of my old face is with you in it um really oh that's actually that's actually kind of an honor as i don't think i took too many pictures after the surgery so yeah that picture is in my favorites i hearted you with your old face and i heart you with your new face you know that um also uh we bought a house we bought matt's old house grandpa's house so the the legacy lives on i tend to the roses um and uh well i mean it was sad that shermy died but i got midna and i actually i did get i i still can't say where i work but i finally i got hired there and i got the position in the department i want to be in so lots of good stuff in chat right now too so i'm really proud of all of you for everything that all of you have accomplished uh bobby for his wedding and his job and um marissa oh my gosh she's in an animated short she's in a video game and of course snoop buns i love your snoop bunny i love her rabbit i really need to come to an la circuit because i need to go see victoria from shaking and crying is down there one of my bffs uh johnny just moved down to san diego i know that's a bit outside la but you know you know to us norcal people it's just all so cal right and then i have to come give marissa a big hug and and johnny wufe uh actually surviving what you did really really great just overcoming any kind of injury or illness and making it was last decade for me yeah yeah um all of you all of you listening i am proud of all of you i i feel like carrie fisher smiling down from heaven with my middle finger extended but um i feel like this proud virtual auntie slash mom and all of you are doing great things don't you know as long as you're not being you know bigoted assholes and you know all of that i'm i'm proud of you so that's my final thought is i'm proud of you oh that's very sweet does look you have an actual final thought instead of accomplishments i'm just attacking this blue slime you're making your way welcome to the party welcome to the party all right that's gonna do it for another episode of orange lounge radio um thanks so much and we look forward to more in 2020 we do have some create some creative changes are gonna start on the next episode so i'm
