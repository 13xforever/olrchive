0	18360	In this decade we've seen a lot happen, way more than I can reasonably summarize in 13
18360	21600	and a half seconds. Join us for the next couple of hours while we touch on the holiday trickle
21600	25120	of gaming news and do a deep dive into the memory vault. All this starts right now in
25120	34720	the show wherever gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio. Hello my friends out there on the internet
34720	41500	and welcome back to the very last Orange Lounge Radio of the year. My name is Rob Roberts and it
41500	48380	is episode number 804 for this December the 29th of 2019. Joining me here in studio DarkSakura or
48380	52360	Jamie Summers. Hi. Hi. I'm gonna come on camera for five seconds even though I'm not like wearing
52360	55920	makeup or anything. Alright that's fine because we do tape live at the Voice of the East Network
55920	61880	twitch.tv slash a VOG Network where you can see DarkSakura is wearing a onesie tonight because
61880	66320	tonight is all about cute and comfortable. I'm wearing sweatpants. I'm wearing my cozy kigurumi.
66320	72040	It's a red panda. And tech master Loki, hello, who also always joins us here every week is wearing his
72040	79360	is that does that say ho-man? It does say ho-man. It's like he-man. I follow a lot of those on Twitter
80320	87400	but I well Santa's got his shirt off Loki that's it's a little thotty there. No he doesn't. He does
87400	92360	not have his shirt off. It looks like it from this angle. Oh no okay from the angle with the light it
92360	97880	looked like this was like his chest. No it's just a Santa elf and he has a candy cane. It was the
97880	104000	angle or I'm thirsty you be the judge. But the angle of the light bouncing off it kind of made
104000	110080	it look funny. All right anyway that's hilarious. Hey ha hi we're here and yeah we're taping live
110080	113880	during this holiday week. Hope you guys have been having a good holiday whatever it is you're
113880	117960	celebrating. I know DarkSakura mentioned off-air that it's the last night of Hanukkah and I know
117960	123800	she you lit the last candle for you headed over here right? I did and it's on my Instagram which
123800	128800	is at DarkSakura if you want to see I use an oil menorah because candle wax everywhere is shitty.
129320	135840	They make this stuff though called wax off and I laugh because it's him whacking off but it smells
135840	141640	like really bad. Well I'll plug my Instagram too at Mr. Rob Roberts that's MR Rob Roberts just like
141640	146400	my Twitter account and because I didn't post anything quite so important but I have been
146400	151360	posting like you know that memes been going around that you you film yourself and it's like what
151360	157720	Pokemon are you and it flashes around. I got horsey for what Pokemon. Yeah everybody says it's just
157840	162040	Russia trying to steal our identities but I mean what's. Well I'm gonna go back to live journal.
162040	169200	Let them have it. There's nothing worth taking here. Well actually speaking of Russia getting
169200	174080	all of your information and being online I actually am reviving my own blog to cross post
174080	180240	over to vog fun at DarkSakura.com. All right. You can see what it looks like right now because
180240	186280	right now I'm like this font sucks and I'm on Helvetica right now. And I also want to briefly
186360	193800	mention that on Christmas Day you and I had dinner we had a movie or no I'm sorry it was well day
193800	199320	after it was technically but it was our Christmas celebration it was dangerous we saw a movie I
199320	204040	know you were really happy scene day celebration it was our Boxing Day celebration we always get
204040	208680	when we get a chance to do it we always get some kind of Asian food so this year we got Vietnamese
208680	215200	yes so none of us got fall even though we're at a fall place now speaking of Boxing Day I have a
215240	221640	special surprise but I need to go get it okay so I'm filled time I you liked cats I did whereas
221640	228040	everybody is not wrong you can tell us a little bit cats thing and I'll be actually gonna be I'm
228040	232840	not gonna go super into detail but I'm gonna be relating some very personal stuff about myself
232840	241440	when I was in middle school I was having a really terrible time I had a really hard life I will say
241440	249400	and someone some relative gave me a CD for cats and the music made me very very happy and then I
249400	255520	was having again a hard time in high school and it came out that my high school band was gonna get
255520	263280	to play at Carnegie Hall and we were gonna go get our choice of a play one of them was Tommy the
263280	268480	other one was phantom and no I think phantom was sold out no one of them was phantom and one of
268480	275800	them was cats and so of course I picked cats and I had such a beautiful memory of not to pun the
275800	284800	song but for me it was actually one event in my life that turned me off of doing something very
284800	291520	drastic and every time I hear the music from it it's like this momentary forgetfulness of everything
291520	296200	that is terrible in my life not everything is terrible now I'm a lot better than I was back
296200	304320	then but going to see the movie for me was it sort of brought back all of that happy moment I
304320	311200	had that day in the Winter Garden theater and I could I could forget the the body and the fake
311200	316480	fur and the naked thing cuz for me I really felt like I was transported back to that night at the
316480	322200	Winter Garden theater and when I got home that night I actually kind of bawled my eyes out
322200	327800	because that emotion was so overwhelming for me and so I'm really looking forward to seeing it
327800	333800	again I had I got the soundtrack for the movie I like the new song that's in it I miss the the
333800	339960	awful battle of the peaks and the follicles I did go and do a very in-depth analysis will moderately
339960	343800	in-depth analysis of what was missing would have been changed and I like the I like some of the
343800	351140	changes in it for me it's a different universe of the same story I I liked what's his name as
351140	356900	McCavity Idris Elba mm-hmm he was perfect for McCavity I liked everybody in it I love they
356900	364380	got a ballerina for Victoria and Judi Dench was I honestly say that she was probably my favorite
364380	368060	change because I really liked her as a little Deuteronomy so for me all the people out there
368060	374060	making fun of it ninety percent of the people I have found have never seen the stage play never
374060	379180	so they don't know and the people who've really liked it have been people like me who have seen
379180	386980	the stage play so go fig but I'm planning on seeing it again Thursday cool yeah well now I
386980	392660	feel like Ellen but here's a present okay so um but actually not not my to in all this is actually
392660	399440	came to us from Canada from our pal Delvin at BG realness I have no idea what's Rob gave me a
399440	404500	night no I gave her a knife but I have no idea what's in this but you might have some type of
404500	410300	idea right all I know is that we did an exchange of things we cannot get in each other's countries
410300	414540	plus I said homemade cookies so there's gonna be Canadian things in here I'm gonna be mad if
414540	418740	there's not any Swiss chalet gravy okay that is not the spirit of the holiday I'm kidding all
418740	424300	right I will say quickly I I realized dark soccer has a much more emotional connection to cats than
424300	430560	I do I there were some parts of it that were kind of like silly to me but I didn't think it was as
430560	434840	bad as everybody saying it is I kind of feel like most of the people that are talking bad didn't
434840	439360	bother to see it I will say though the CGI was a choice they should have just done the Broadway
439360	442840	they should just have the Broadway makeup and costumes it would have been fine I would have
442840	448440	liked for them to have had a bit more merger of the styles you know the CG bodies were great I
448440	454880	remember I don't know if it was Tiara or Victoria who said it about you know Jenny any dots taking
454880	461240	off her coat yeah but that's what happened on the stage production and actually it's one cat
461240	467080	playing her in the dressy outfit and with and honestly I liked the costume change better with
467080	472880	her that little purple number instead of just this whole fringe bodysuit I freaking love drum
472880	477080	tum tucker I just wish that they would have had more of like the fuzzy elements they had in the
477080	482120	play you can't say cats is the worst movie of the year when this is the same year that x-men
482120	486520	Dark Phoenix came out I'm sorry Oh dark sorry just lit up I don't even know what's in it what's
486520	492280	in it for God's sake all dressed okay I am a big fan of all dress chips heck yeah I've never had
492280	500200	them they're great they're they're very vinegary though we also okay you can have I will try one
500200	506680	but I don't like ketchup those ketchup tips I don't like cash Browns I love them ooh I'm looking
506680	515520	forward to this hickory sticks I haven't had in years I've had hickory sticks before I am excited

678560	683160	obviously this week was a little bit slower in gaming news but as Loki was saying with the tongue
683160	689440	in cheek this is kind of a chance for us to reflect on the decade yeah now before cuz some
689440	694760	people are gonna play pull this card and that is that the next decade doesn't really start for
694760	701480	another year because a decade runs from it would be 2011 through 2020 would be the decade but you
701480	706400	know what that's not here's the thing I think a lot of numerology is big for a lot of people right
706400	711240	so I think a lot of people are like we're we're in the tens or the teens at this point and now
711240	717840	we're gonna start the Roaring Twenties start so it's more looking back on the last decade a decade

792800	799800	news of the decade so we kind of want to know like what were your three biggest stories if you were
799800	804600	to look back on the decade what were the three biggest things in your mind and you know there's
804600	808680	no right or wrong answer for this I think everybody has three right I didn't yeah date
808680	812760	three I think everybody came up with this I did more because you know that's fine you have some
812760	817680	honorable mentions it's fine so um you know these are gonna be like our top three biggest like news
817680	822360	and just to kind of give you an idea to look back on how long a decade was we were listening
822560	827560	to Bobby Blackwell here in studio who's on before us a vog network every week and he was kind of
827560	832520	going through some of his old like show roles and and titles of shows and things to kind of go back
832520	837920	on what was happening and then I remember that we have the orange lounge radio wiki so thanks to all
837920	845480	the kind people that contribute to our wiki over at orange lounge radio dot wiki.com we have some
845480	850080	headlines from the past decade so some of the things that happened at the beginning of the
850080	863040	decade January 10th 2010 episode number 352 Microsoft announced Xbox live game room pain is
863040	867920	still real so real too soon yeah they announced that a consumer electronics show which is that
867920	872680	early January thing so yeah it was a big big thing that happened in January 2010 and is NBA
872680	879640	Jam making a comeback spoiler alert yes but it wasn't a short it wasn't come back just wasn't
879640	884280	the original hey we saw an NBA Jam at the movie we didn't sound NBA Jam machine to the movie old
884280	891760	skewell and then let's see just a couple others here episode 354 February 7th 2010 stories include
891760	897600	Sonic 4 and blaster master overdrive announced spoiler alert neither were really that good this
897600	907000	was the blaster master on the Wii not the pretty good reboot they did later overdrive and then
907000	911240	Sonic 4 wasn't very good either but then they did Sonic Mania and that was much better so anyway
911240	917440	and then Microsoft pulled the plug on Halo 2 and Xbox one games on Xbox live you can you can open
917440	921880	the stuff that was the president and then a dark Sakura I know this is gonna be a little bit of a
921880	928440	sad memory but in in in all honestness this is one of my favorite olr moments that ever happened so
928440	932840	back in the beginning of the decade in 2010 we were still doing this show at your house so on
932840	939240	the show February 28 2010 stories included news from Nintendo's World Summit and Shermy's review
939240	944560	of Sony video game related show the tester oh is that the one where she threw up no she shit on
944560	949560	the she shit on the floor that was it while we were talking about Sony's the death Shermy Shermy
949560	954240	died in the last decade she did but you want to know what the last thing she did before she died
954240	961560	she took a shit on Dan shoe no this is what happened Dan was playing Borderlands huh and I
961560	967120	think Borderlands 2 and sure me we just got back from Disneyland I was keeping a wrapped in a in a
967120	971640	hot towel from the dryer so she went back into her little bedroom which was the dryer room and
971640	975640	she patted me on the foot and I went to go get ready for the bed after I gave her scritches next
975640	981360	thing I know she's killed over in the living room dead still warm and there was a big shit on Dan
981360	988200	shoe and so he's cleaning cleaning the body up for me gonna go get her cremated for me and next
988240	994720	thing here is god damn it cat and I'm like what don't talk like that about the cast like she
994720	1003760	shat in my shoe god damn it cat and so anyway yeah we lost we've lost many many good pet memories
1003760	1009760	I mean Maruko and Sanrio from our family you know and I sent you video not long ago that found of
1009760	1013520	Sanrio that I took yeah that's the other interesting thing about this last decade is that we've
1013520	1019000	documented so much of it on our phones obviously iPhones and androids existed in the last decade
1019000	1024360	but I think they've really become prolific in this decade and she with the video inside my iPhone
1024360	1030000	that's right what was great is the very next episode episode 358 in the most legendary episode
1030000	1036560	yet olr takes a stand against cuss free week the only way possible with the fuck show stories
1036560	1040680	include portal to being announced that was a big game of the decade we'll have to see if that comes
1040680	1046800	up in any games of the decade list a little later but anyway so yeah it was a bit yeah remember all
1046800	1052980	the hype going into the fuck show which was like this olr in joke for years and I think it had to
1052980	1058400	do with a story like this shows you how old the show is okay like a story about counting the
1058400	1062920	number of times the word fuck was said in Pulp Fiction and about like how is it even possible
1062920	1066760	to say fuck that many times and we kept saying we'll I'll do it one day one day we're gonna
1066800	1070840	outdo it we're just gonna have a fuck show and so finally it happened at the beginning of the
1070840	1075200	decade we had a show and because there was a story about national cuss free week or something
1075200	1081920	who said this is the week so we did the fuck show and it was it was kind of a letdown I think the
1081920	1086560	joke got old after about three never lived up to the hype it's no it didn't live up to the hype
1086560	1092280	yeah fuck a lot we did that was great it was liberating it was it was very livery all right
1092280	1098480	free the fuck top three so looking back the whole decade you know those are some of the
1098480	1102080	headlines from early on but looking back on the whole decade what do you think were the three
1102080	1106480	biggest headlines I want to know you guys in chat to some of your big headlines although hold off
1106480	1110360	because they'll scroll off the screen before I can see them but be thinking about it more than
1110360	1115200	three I'll leave a space for honorable mentions before number one okay so we're gonna do three
1115200	1119120	to honorable mentions one sound good okay all right then dark soccer I want it you're ready
1119120	1123520	to go so number three what is your number three I'm actually combining one then okay it's the
1123520	1130560	advent of certain kinds of games the indie game for one thing super meat boy vvvvvv came out in
1130560	1136880	2010 undertale off do you remember off we played as the baseball batter that one had a big internet
1136880	1142920	following yeah and then there were a lot of them just popping up on steam steam really took off
1142920	1148960	with the indie games and now we had it have these developers that you know the big names are working
1148960	1155240	with these independent developers love you why why are two who gave us our favorite game sure and
1155240	1161800	pixel shits no I love that and so if we were writing it down would we say they're prolific
1161800	1166200	ness of the indie game yeah cuz the indie game isn't necessarily new to this decade the advent
1166200	1171840	of the popularity and just the the the ease of getting it got to be so much what Nintendo is
1171840	1176960	finally embracing it that shows you how far it's come and with that that also brings about the
1176960	1182160	advent of the narrative genre because a lot of those games were made by maybe not the biggest
1182160	1188680	development houses but we had the Edith Finch we had everybody's gone to the rapture we had to the
1188680	1195760	moon which was done in 16-bit style one of my favorites what was that other one that I can't
1195760	1202320	think of the name of that wasn't Edith Finch or everyone's gone to the rapture but at any rate
1202320	1207640	it's just it's it's really an exploration of different genre and different development
1207640	1214320	styles and going outside of the norm for what you're looking for I think I really really think
1214320	1220840	that that was a big thing is that people really looking outside of the box we have a big surge in
1220840	1227120	creativity and new concepts and new talent and people starting to realize a game isn't something
1227200	1233000	that you have to win it is just something that you enjoy that you get something out of it your
1233000	1237560	games can experience it's an experience exactly whether or not it's screaming because you died
1237560	1243280	in five seconds hello kaizo mario because that was also you know the big thing but I think that
1243280	1248840	it's that advent of people really finally embracing the other when it comes to their
1248840	1253000	games now some great comments in chat here pixel pockets bringing up gone home it's another great
1253000	1258400	example of you know but Bobby I think really kind of is putting his finger on a little bit
1258400	1262900	like why why this decade what made it prolific in this decade I think it's a great comment from
1262900	1266720	Bobby Black Wolf I think a different way of looking at it is the ease of developing games
1266720	1271600	that really happened in this decade making games was really hard before unity and unreal engine
1271600	1277040	took the hardest parts and extra plated them for you same thing with XNA that's why indie games
1277040	1281360	blew up people even using Swift yeah people didn't need to know linear algebra to make a 3d engine to
1281360	1285160	be able to make a game they just need to make the game and you look at some of the biggest hits of
1285160	1289560	the decade things like Five Nights at Freddy's that was done in what click team fusion or whatever
1289560	1297720	that is undertale was done in another one of those I think yeah but I mean but really it's the fact
1297720	1304080	I agree that the development has become so accessible that and you know back in the day
1304080	1307800	we used the only thing that we really had to do something like this was maybe the occasional
1307800	1316160	visual novel maker and RPG maker I mean really that was it to my knowledge or you know doing
1316160	1324080	like a mud or you know something like that but or you know text games because those were fairly
1324080	1331640	easy but now we have like legit fun entertaining games that we can play on our home consoles or
1331640	1339320	our computers that are as immersive as any big title you know release and more of these people
1339320	1345320	are now are finding that they have not just a way to make a living of making a game but they also
1345320	1350240	have a way of using their voice of getting a message out there that they want to of course
1350240	1357880	some people are also using that ability for for I would even just flat-out say evil like the school
1357880	1367800	shooter game and the series of anti-democracy games coming out of China you know but at the
1367800	1374640	same time a lot of people are really using it as a force for good okay that's a really good really
1374640	1380520	good take on one of the biggest things the decade kind of the the rise and the portability and the
1380520	1385280	the new stories that have opened up in the indie gaming world good Loki I'll let you go next what's
1385280	1390240	your number three my number three is probably gonna be because I've been kind of going back
1390240	1399640	and forth with my rankings here so I'll say because it did get a lot of like coverage in
1399640	1407080	then it just kind of went up and then down though yeah somebody in chat just mentioned oh yeah yeah
1407080	1413360	because oh yeah was like this big it was kind of one of the things that got Kickstarter some notice
1413400	1419160	because that was kind of launched but well the you know game funding through
1419160	1424040	kickstart was really kind of like being brought to attention of everybody who threw you know
1424040	1427560	that we yeah and how much money it raised everything and they're like oh yeah we're
1427560	1431480	gonna take on the consoles and everything and they came out and it was kind of flopped and then
1431480	1439040	I don't know but I mean you can kind of say that it sort of led the way with other you know maybe
1439040	1444760	not directly led the way but you know you have other indie consoles now or other smaller consoles
1444760	1451120	coming out like you know with the officially you know the Nintendo Super Nintendo Genesis and then
1451120	1458160	like not so well it's sort of it's still official but like you know eventually the Intellivision
1458160	1464120	and then Atari's doing their own thing so it kind of you know maybe a little bit too early
1464880	1472200	before it's time to to pie in the sky but it's just the implementation which is not very good
1472200	1478240	okay yeah and kind of also what that represented for Kickstarter I don't know if Kickstarter is
1478240	1483240	gonna come up again on anybody's top three but I think certainly the OUYA is a good kind of
1483240	1488240	benchmark for showing like the Kickstarter and kind of like the pluses and the minuses yeah I
1488240	1493680	mean lots of things like oculus rift you know was a big one there's also all the other games
1494680	1500160	make it man clone I can't even remember the name of it now my name and I didn't thank you
1500160	1508080	beat you by nine seconds but yeah what but and I say it kind of kind of mixed here pod culture
1508080	1513400	says that would be me I actually liked the OUYA some people liked it and you know considering I
1513400	1517840	think a lot of people kind of pre-ordered those or kick-started those things I should say to be
1517840	1522560	able to play retro stuff on them and you know they were gonna be open-ended it was very easy to put
1522560	1526000	emulators on them I think for people that were just looking to do that that we have probably
1526000	1529800	delivered very well I'm not saying pocos just one of those people but I think there are many people
1529800	1534920	that got what they wanted out of OUYA it's just OUYA for whatever reason I'm not sure we can to
1534920	1540880	this day kind of figure out where did OUYA stumble why couldn't OUYA keep it going it just wasn't a
1540880	1545400	lot of people developing stuff for it and they were like putting out first off like their
1545400	1550960	controller was crap it was good though that you could use your own controller with it which is
1550960	1555360	nice but the software offerings weren't very good you had to have demos for all your games
1555360	1558920	that were on there so I don't know if that was what was holding it back but I did play some of
1558920	1563960	the games on there definitely a lot of the demos and side loading stuff you could do that it just
1563960	1572240	didn't have like really it would have taken off if it had like OUYA like as a platform and then
1572240	1579320	you know oh you can have like a Apple TV type service or not Apple TV Apple arcade type service
1579360	1582800	you know with it where there's a bunch of indie games you can play on it and stuff would be kind
1582800	1588760	of cool but even when I think they took the OUYA part out of it and just the software and brought
1588760	1594200	that to want to say it was one of the Razer consoles or it might even been the Nvidia shield
1594200	1599600	one of those has that now I don't even know if it's really doing anything there either right now
1599600	1604080	because I think now it's like well if I want to play Android games on my TV I can just get an
1604080	1610920	Android TV or I can or not play it on my TV and play it on my phone and do it that way I don't
1610920	1614800	know but maybe at the time that we came out to it I mean let's be real that thing couldn't process
1614800	1618800	much more than a mobile phone could and I think there just wasn't a lot of demand for those types
1618800	1624280	of games on a big TV at that point I mean maybe OUYA was too soon who knows but yeah I mean look
1624280	1629960	at it like now because you have a lot of people do so with Raspberry Pis and I want it I don't
1630040	1634720	remember the timeline whether you know where the Raspberry Pi was when OUYA was out but like the
1634720	1641040	OUYA is like a $75 it's an expensive console whereas the Pi is like 30 bucks and you can
1641040	1644760	probably do a lot of the stuff that you can do on the OUYA at least with emulation stuff because
1644760	1651040	that's what a lot of people are interested in on that but I just think that it was just too early
1651040	1656400	like I think now the technology is a lot smaller and you know more powerful that you could probably
1656560	1660640	pull off something like that but it's kind of too late so I don't know they have it who knows
1660640	1666240	someone may try again later but yeah not the OUYA all right so Loki's number three the rise and
1666240	1671920	quick fall of the OUYA all right my number three my number three moment of gaming news of the
1671920	1676400	decade I'm gonna say when Reggie Fils-Aime debuted the Nintendo switch on the Tonight
1676400	1682680	Show would be my number three top gaming story of the decade I think obviously I'm kind of
1682680	1686760	encompassed I'm using this as an excuse to just talk about the Nintendo switches impact on the
1686760	1693320	industry with this but I think specifically that moment of Reggie Fils-Aime going to debut the
1693320	1698520	switch on the Tonight Show they were able to sell that concept in a way that didn't really work for
1698520	1703200	the Wii U and you know you can contrast that moment of what happened on the Tonight Show with
1703200	1707920	what had happened previously with the Wii U and that confusion of oh is this an expansion for the
1707920	1711960	Wii no it's an all-new console remember how that was kind of like a problem yeah whereas when we
1711960	1715960	saw the Nintendo switch and its demonstration being unveiled and executed on the Tonight Show
1715960	1721560	it made it very clear this is something you play on the TV then you pick it up oh it's ready to go
1721560	1726800	they had a powerhouse game in Breath of the Wild ready to go it kind of didn't matter that that was
1726800	1730400	a game that really was coming out for the Wii U and had been kind of developed for the Wii U in
1730400	1735200	many ways like it didn't it that part just didn't end up mattering because the way that they sold
1735200	1740120	the message on the switch was so strong it's almost like all the problems in the Wii U's
1740160	1745520	messaging were being fixed in the way that they were rolling out the switch and this just goes
1745520	1751160	as well to the big gif moment of Miyamoto doing the thumbs down and the thumbs that whole thing
1751160	1756480	and that okay yeah that's silly but yeah silly but it's you know it was also meaningful I think
1756480	1761800	it's cemented Reggie Fils-Aime I think many of us in the gaming industry already knew he was like
1761800	1766680	he was dead you know he's he was like he's that cool guy that showed up on holidays and told you
1766920	1770520	what you're gonna get that year you know like Reggie Fils-Aime was already kind of like the
1770520	1774480	gaming industry is kind of in that way kind of like you know the cool dad or maybe the cool
1774480	1778080	uncle would be a better way to put it because then he'd voice a dad maybe like Miyamoto is
1778080	1783920	really the you know but but Reggie Fils-Aime is definitely like the cool uncle that shows up right
1783920	1788960	and certainly you know when he ends up retiring everybody was like oh that sucks to kind of see
1788960	1793080	him go but at the same time he's earned it and you know hope he has an awesome pension and all that
1793080	1798040	stuff but anyway I digress a little bit but I think what I'm trying to get out with Reggie
1798040	1802360	Fils-Aime in that moment too is that he wasn't just the voice for us but he was able to be
1802360	1807360	comfortable going on The Tonight Show representing gaming representing all of that and kind of
1807360	1813720	putting that out there in the the more the general population in general people and I think it is a
1813720	1819760	big part of the reason why the switch did as well as it did is the message got out there that time
1819840	1824120	and it's not just The Tonight Show I just think that was kind of like the moment but it was you
1824120	1828800	know just the messaging of the switch and and yes you pick it up you take it out and it's on the go
1828800	1835120	and it was it was huge. SSG100Matt in chat pointing out all we got was a video beforehand The
1835120	1840640	Tonight Show spot was the first time we actually saw it live and in person yep Bobby Blackwell says
1840640	1844800	everyone thought The Tonight Show demo was faked because everyone was convinced that Nintendo
1844800	1850000	couldn't actually pull it off absolutely and as we're reflecting on that moment all of that was
1850000	1854320	absolutely true we were probably even skeptical here on this show I think I remember something
1854320	1860280	about a delay between the the screen and then pulling it out and I think there was wonder
1860280	1865200	about is that show it's fake that's everything and no no that's just how it works or it well
1865200	1869760	it's just how it works or B it was the prototype as well it probably didn't quite run as snappy at
1869760	1874560	that point yet there were actually five prototypes for the switch before though I'm sure early well
1874560	1878840	one of them the sides were supposed to be magnetic mm-hmm and then they had another one was supposed
1878840	1882440	to have like the circular clip on it and it was pretty interesting well I remember the the whole
1882440	1887260	concept behind putting other types of controllers in the in the in the joy con spots although we
1887260	1891160	have seen that with the NES classic controllers I think that's what you can do they do have one
1891160	1895520	though I want to say that you can get one that does have a different d-pad or something on it
1895520	1902120	or has a d-pad instead of the four buttons or you know the the doesn't the switch light I want to
1902120	1911040	say have different d-pad instead of the four buttons yeah yeah I think so so but anyway yeah
1911040	1915200	and I think so my number three again is Reggie fees and may going on the tonight show to debut
1915200	1920680	the Nintendo switch and I I think this kind of just all encompasses the switch and Nintendo
1920680	1926160	kind of starting the decade a little bit rough we you didn't go so well for them although I you
1926160	1929800	know I still think the Wii U had a lot of great moments in it right we had things like Mario maker
1929800	1933960	you know there were there were great titles with the Wii U but the messaging just it didn't connect
1933960	1939480	and I what we were supposed to first get Breath of the Wild on yeah I will say it to this day
1939480	1944960	though if they hadn't if they'd called it something different it would have done better I fully believe
1944960	1949760	that but I mean there's no way to know I guess in retrospect but anyway um the Nintendo switch its
1949760	1955440	debut the success that it's found putting Nintendo back out there marching to the beat
1955440	1960720	of their own drum as much as much as it frustrates the hell out of us sometimes I think all of that
1960720	1968040	kind of goes into my number three just representing the Nintendo switch so let's move on to number two
1968040	1974720	but not you know number two but you know yeah mine's like no particular order kind of thing
1974720	1983600	so I'm gonna say the advent of Nintendo directs because the first one I think it was 2010 2011
1983600	1991880	2011 I believe was the first one yeah and it was also it ties into another thing about e3 losing
1991880	1999000	its relevancy Nintendo might have been the first big one to do it but a lot of companies started
1999040	2004880	abandoning e3 is their primary way of releasing information Nintendo I think really paved that
2004880	2009920	path and of course we had the the closure of Kensha Hall a lot of Indies couldn't really do
2009920	2018240	too much at e3 anymore and so we have now so many people they may have a presence at e3 but that is
2018240	2023200	not their delivery method not anymore and Nintendo was the first one I really think to make that a
2023200	2027760	thing I think you're absolutely right and as much as like people might go you know oh that's an
2027760	2032360	interesting selection I think I think you've nailed it is that even though Nintendo Nintendo
2032360	2036240	marches to the beat of their own drum we know that and we get frustrated as hell by it sometimes when
2036240	2039640	it comes to things like online and the way they roll out their retro library and things like that
2039640	2044680	but at the same time like Nintendo direct they got it right and they were ahead of the curve on that
2044680	2049960	absolutely doing it Sony skipped out on e3 Microsoft does it to an extent too yeah I mean
2049960	2054080	Microsoft may still attend e3 and see some of the value in that but Microsoft certainly does their
2054080	2058480	own conferencing and things of that nature so I think he needs to go to kitty jail mr. smoosh is
2058480	2069840	over there he has his own top three where's my debut anyway so he's he's on his way to kitty
2069840	2075920	jail don't work he's he's a nice big comfy bed in there in a small supply of food and water so he
2075920	2080000	doesn't go crazy in kitty jail but he's not out here screaming alright anyway some comments from
2080000	2083960	chat SGO and her Matt says the Nintendo direct scheme really changed how press conferences are
2083960	2087920	done dark to see you says I'm sure that's why Sony adopted that strategy in the last couple
2087920	2093360	of years because Nintendo had a really great idea there so and dark to see you say Microsoft does
2093360	2098720	their X 0 1 9 or whatever shows just like we had one a few weeks ago so Microsoft still may kind of
2098720	2102440	dip in the traditional things but they do they do a good hybrid you know they do a little bit
2102440	2107040	of Microsoft directs if you want to call them that and and traditional press things as well
2107040	2115000	yeah but I also begs the question how long is that trade show gonna last mm-hmm really it's
2115000	2122360	haven't they lost money now there's a lot of statements eulogizing e3 and I I don't know I
2122360	2128840	think it's a complicated question I'm not sure what e3 can do I think e3 kind of has to show the
2128840	2136320	value in making Los Angeles like that destination place to be for gaming that week I don't know if
2136320	2140040	opening up to the fans has really done that because I think they were trying to inject
2140040	2144800	fans into what is a trade show a professional show you know if you're gonna bring fans make
2144800	2150960	it a fan show you know go all-in on it you know yeah wasn't that the e4 all thing whatever happened
2150960	2156400	event the problem with e4 all is that everybody knew it was just a poor like it was the the scraps
2156480	2160920	left over from e3 you know no offense to anyone cuz you know I know the network we used to
2160920	2165720	participate on had participated in e4 all it was a great opportunity and all that stuff I'm not like
2165720	2169520	I don't I understand why people wanted to go and participate in it but let's be real it was the
2169520	2175080	scraps from e3 e3 was still the mega event and it was like well we'll do we'll do this little dog
2175080	2182400	and pony show too you know but now there's just gonna be the one maybe we all laugh at e4 all
2182440	2190120	which is last decade but maybe there's some things to be said in there so anyway alright so there you
2190120	2196040	go Nintendo directs and what it's kind of done to e3 let's go around to more number two is Loki
2196040	2203040	so I always think this is pretty interesting because you know we kind of grew up in arcades
2203040	2208960	and stuff and so now you see all the arcades kind of going to these giant ticket games and
2208960	2216280	it's kind of like all the classic arcade stuff is gone except now it's not because we have arcade
2216280	2222600	one up that's putting out arcade machines that people bring into their houses which is great
2222600	2228560	with like classic games and that wasn't a thing that I ever thought would happen that cheaply
2228560	2235240	let's put it that way and now it's just like all these big games you know from my childhood now
2235280	2241560	coming back where you know if I wanted to I could fill my house full of these arcade games which is
2241560	2246920	great I don't even know how to say that succinctly but you are you're you're very spot-on with that
2246920	2254400	observation that it's like arcade came home in the form of like console games and that caused
2254400	2258840	the arcades to kind of die off a little bit you know I'm now granted you know there was always
2258840	2264880	gonna be these big it's just nostalgia yeah but now it's like now a lot of that arcade stuff is
2265040	2270400	literally in your house now and it's very easy to come by yeah it's inexpensive like you can get
2270400	2276160	like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles machine for like two or two to four hundred dollars versus
2276160	2282680	like probably close to a thousand two thousand dollars when it originally came out I mean I
2282680	2286440	don't know what those machines would have cost but I can't imagine it was that price maybe it's the
2286440	2291440	same way to put it would be the growth and authenticity of collectibles yeah I think would
2291440	2295560	be a way to put it is that you know it's like it's like you have the real thing right it's all
2295560	2300680	this like you know classic gaming coming back because it's nostalgia a lot of people are very
2300680	2306160	nostalgic about that stuff and they want to kind of experience you know share that with their kids
2306160	2312360	and so that because you can't go there aren't any traditional or not many left traditional arcade
2312360	2318680	game arcades out there you can't just go to the mall and go to a tilter you know Aladdin's castle
2318680	2324600	or whatever it's just that's a great perspective because you know I don't have kids star soccer
2324600	2329960	doesn't have kids a lot of people listen to this show don't have kids some do you have kids and so
2329960	2335080	you're talking about how do I introduce the places I went to to my kids I can't they don't exist
2335080	2339880	anymore or they're not like they were but I can still have these cabinets and these things that
2339880	2344400	kind of show these types of games yeah because it's just not the same I mean granted like I
2344440	2348720	remember we're going to an arcade and it's quarters and it or you go to nickel city or
2348720	2352880	something like that you pay like five bucks to get in you pay with nickels you can like spend
2352880	2358440	like a long time there on like 20 bucks granted yes I know inflation and shit like that but
2358440	2363240	nowadays it's like every game I play and I remember like starting off with DDR it's like
2363240	2368760	it was a bucket game that was expensive you know as always the big games now it's like I want to
2368760	2378040	play a round of you know crossy roads a game that's on my cell phone or my tablet I'm playing
2378040	2385240	crossy roads on a giant screen for like literally less than a couple minutes for a buck a time a
2385240	2393440	buck a game that is ridiculous just because it spits out tickets on a related note you have to
2393440	2397040	see what Bobby's writing in chat right now right dark soccer cuz this is right up your alley yeah
2397080	2402400	stealing one of my thoughts oh is oh so maybe I better wait and all right all right well I was
2402400	2409640	gonna say because um well we're talking about collectibles kind of going into the home we see
2409640	2418560	pinball is kind of coming back in bars and kind of pinball arcade and the comment about get these
2418560	2422320	pinball machines out of my basement and they set them up in an arcade somewhere so it's almost like
2422440	2428840	pinball has had this weird rise in this decade well thanks Stern for that pretty much and the
2428840	2434880	good and I'm gonna go into this but I mean thanks to Stern we have the big old names in Bally and
2434880	2442040	Midway and even Gottlieb coming back and doing these massive tables you know I mean Steve Richie
2442040	2449920	he's done like what some of the last five really popular Stern pinballs he and then he got to do
2449920	2455160	his dream game which was Black Knight Sword of Rage so a quick follow-up something we talked
2455160	2459600	about a previous week on the stranger things pinball table is really out there now they've
2459600	2462840	shown like the official commercial all the official previews are out there it looks so
2462840	2468880	good that machine looks amazing so all right anyway okay so great there you go you're number
2468880	2474760	two um so my second pick I'm gonna piggyback off dark soccer a little bit because mine is
2474760	2481040	e3 related I was gonna kind of call it the rise and fall of e3 a little bit but I think the the
2481040	2486560	pinpoint note that would be definitely like the last moment when I felt we really had a moment
2486560	2492440	in e3 that was so important and so relevant and the kind of thing that e3 needs to pray comes back
2492440	2498480	would be the PlayStation press conference where they unveiled the PlayStation 4 specifically would
2498480	2505320	be that I think second biggest moment of the decade because just the way they curb stomped
2505320	2513200	my hey hey Microsoft sit and spin it was it was it was something and like I you know it was it
2513200	2519720	was a level of like competition and shade and that type of stuff that like we just hadn't seen
2519720	2527640	in a long time like it was almost petty but it wasn't like it was very much tastefully it was
2527640	2534000	tastefully petty it was Lori petty it was it was because like literally like a month or so
2534000	2542560	beforehand the most ridiculous press conference was unveiled like just such a flop it was true
2542560	2549440	shade it was shade we all know is true absolutely but you're leading into the the Microsoft thing
2549440	2554920	yeah right yeah and yeah the Microsoft event Don Mattrick kind of fell on his face so that
2554920	2559120	whole thing a little bit you know Microsoft had to kind of eat it a little bit when it came to
2559120	2564120	their message of the sport yeah yeah right the sports the TV and the mandatory Kinect and look
2564120	2569120	I understand that Microsoft has its defenders at that time and still does and I also understand
2569120	2575800	that in many ways Microsoft may have seen like a lot of things they were pitching at the time
2575800	2580200	would make a lot more sense now a lot of things they talk about with digital and that sort of
2580200	2584440	thing and maybe the concept that like you don't really own your discs anymore because everything's
2584480	2589840	digital like some of those things make a little more sense in 2019 but it just goes to show how
2589840	2595840	the gaming industry is a really unique play I don't know if this exists in the movie industry
2595840	2600320	maybe it does a little bit but the gaming industry is a very unique position of you've got to not
2600320	2605360	only make your game and make your console you got to do it at the right time and the announcement
2605360	2610320	and how you do it and the messaging is all an art form it in and of itself it really is I think
2610320	2617080	their fail was announcing it at all if you're gonna do that make it subtle make it an organic
2617080	2622280	change you know something that's gonna make sense like like I mean kind of how Nintendo's doing it
2622280	2628400	where you can get both versions of a digital and then you start seeing a phase out just saying oh
2628400	2632920	it's not gonna be like that anymore fuck you everybody well I also think ever since Mattrick
2632920	2637640	went out and Phil Spencer got in I think you've seen Microsoft's messaging and what they're
2637680	2642200	looking for and what I think it's changed significantly we just haven't had a new console
2642200	2647840	yet but that's gonna be a huge thing I think as we like to get into the next decade you know this
2647840	2655040	whole is cloud gaming going to really happen is what did Google maybe misfire a little bit by
2655040	2659800	launching stadia too early who but or maybe it's gonna be a huge success maybe we're gonna look
2659800	2664640	back in ten years if heaven forbid the show still going in ten years and we look back and we go oh
2664640	2669520	my god stadia was like the biggest fucking thing in gaming this whole decade they were right we
2669520	2675680	just we don't know we won't know really but as of now it seems like who maybe the stadia has launched
2675680	2680000	a little bit early but anyway I'm digressing a little bit I think we kind of already hit on the
2680000	2683240	rest of what I was gonna say as far as like the rise in the fall when you talked about Nintendo
2683240	2688080	Direct so I think certainly when it comes to e3 specifically I think we've seen that like it was
2688080	2695320	the must have it was the you're gonna gather in a movie theater to watch this and that that was
2695320	2700120	that year I mean I know Sony's done it a couple of years but that was the year you wanted to be
2700120	2707280	in a movie theater and watch them publicly bully Microsoft is honestly what happened that year and
2707280	2713760	it was it was something else to I don't look at it as like a bullying more or less like a scientific
2713760	2720720	refutation it really did seem very clinical didn't it well I think the worry was that this
2720720	2725880	was kind of a calculated effort across the industry that this is the way it's gonna go
2725880	2732440	and tough luck this is you're in or you're out and the thought was okay we saw Microsoft now
2732440	2737080	it's okay digital only or you know we're not going to be sharing this or something like that
2737080	2742520	all this DRM and then the worry was okay so when you're gonna do the same thing because then that
2742520	2749440	means that like this is kind of what's this mean and it was just kind of that collective relief of
2749440	2755480	like okay thank God there's some sanity in this industry you know because of all the announcements
2755480	2759760	is that on top of the fact that the initial announcement from Microsoft is ridiculous and
2759760	2768880	so you know that just compared to the rational yeah it's just like it is normally it was such
2768880	2774080	a big announcement even though it really wasn't so to kind of summarize this and move on to the
2774080	2779880	next point I would say that this moment the PlayStation and our PlayStation 4 reveal and
2779880	2785440	what it did to Microsoft was literally the last must-see TV event out of e3 and maybe that's what
2785440	2789360	e3 kind of needs to get back to a little bit is a little more of those live they let you know I
2789360	2794000	realize live is a scary thing because the internet can be a harsh critics a lot of the time more than
2794000	2799760	it needs to be but those live moments are what really make the whole thing happen you know too
2799760	2805720	much of e3 now felt very scripted like you know the moment when I realized like this e3 is is not
2805720	2810720	what it used to be like that the moment for me was when we were standing in line to see a new
2810720	2816000	Assassin's Creed thing in a theater and we'd like had to justify to these people who we are and that
2816000	2820040	we had an audience and that you know you have literally empty seats in that theater and you
2820040	2825240	should let us let us go sit in them so we had to like fight to do that and then I go back to the
2825240	2829160	hotel later that night and the entire thing we saw in the theater was up on YouTube and I was
2829160	2836240	like fuck this like what are we doing like you know so that was yeah but that was all canned
2836240	2842520	that was a canned message it was up on YouTube as well and everything so anyway um now I would say
2842520	2846720	also um because Bobby is mentioning in chat one of the other things interesting things about that
2846720	2850960	PlayStation event is that they also announced at that event that they were gonna start charging
2850960	2855760	for online play but nobody cared that's a very good point they announced all this good news good
2855760	2859680	news good news then they snuck in there oh and PlayStation Plus is now how you're gonna be able
2859680	2863760	to play your games online nobody cared nobody cared because everybody kind of saw it coming
2863760	2867920	so to have all this good news and then that everybody just kind of overlooked it so it was
2867920	2872960	very very interesting I think in a way all right anyway let's move on I think some honorable
2872960	2877120	mentions before we get to the big number once so and please realize somebody else's honorable
2877120	2881160	mention might be your number one so we won't elaborate on these too much but let's talk about
2881160	2887520	some honorable mentions dark soccer the thing is my honorable mention in my quote number one
2887520	2892800	honestly I'll switch him out because I have one the one I mentioned was the one I was gonna do
2892800	2897480	as my number one so I'm just gonna go ahead and fucking say it because it's kind of equal for me
2897480	2904840	but the whole retro revival you know barcades being a thing having pinball come back again
2904840	2912720	thanks to companies like like Stern and Jersey Jack and the one I can't think of off the top of
2912720	2918520	my head that's doing pinballs again but we you know like I said that's been a big thing and also
2918520	2924080	that goes in with the classic consoles being revived as well like the mini versions we've
2924120	2930120	had an NES SNES there's gonna be Nintendo 64 there's gonna be turbo graphics slash PC engine
2930120	2938800	the Genesis classic Sony did one I mean fuck if Sega did a Saturn I'd just go dance around for
2938800	2945240	a while please take a little dreamcast please but I mean all of that that whole revival of
2945240	2950240	it's going into you know there's indie games again where we're seeing our retro style like
2950240	2957400	I mean shovel knight is a full 3d game that plays like a pixelated 2d old-school really good game
2957400	2962880	you know we're seeing a lot of this revival I mean they've tried to update these and they just
2962880	2968000	realized that doing it the old-school way is the best so I really tie all that in together we're
2968000	2973880	having a nostalgia that has manifested itself you know what's interesting and I'm kind of grinning
2973880	2978160	over here because as you're talking about it I'm reminded of another artistic industry where like
2978200	2984160	retro revivals are very important and crucial to the industry fashion fashion exactly right
2984160	2991080	this retro revival is a huge fashion thing right but gaming gaming I just like that I can shop at
2991080	2995440	the thrift store again yeah gaming hasn't really been around long enough quote-unquote to have had
2995440	2999800	a retro revival I think in the way that we've seen it happen in this past decade you know especially
2999800	3003920	with the NES classics selling out like that and you know the Super Nintendo classics and you know
3003920	3009920	sure we had retro stuff we had Atari collections on PlayStation in the last decade things like that
3009920	3013540	but I don't think we saw it at the level that we've really seen it in this past decade you know
3013540	3017320	they've got those home sets now that looks like what that Commodore 64 one that looks like the
3017320	3021480	big keyboard it really isn't a working keyboard by the way did you notice that we have the new
3021480	3026560	decoration up yes yeah if you it's if it's hard to see on camera and I can see that it probably
3026560	3030280	would be a little bit hard to see on the camera it is an actual like copy of the patent for the
3030280	3036080	Commodore 64 which y'all know is near and dear to my heart so um the moment I saw that I knew I
3036080	3042640	had to get it but I mean but we were seeing a lot more of that you know and it's not just oh get off
3042640	3051760	my lawn you know all of us people not to say we're old or anything but I'm seeing especially and I'm
3051760	3057080	even gonna tie in speed running to this because we got a lot of really young people speed running
3057080	3062760	classic games and that I think is also tying into the whole retro revival too because they're
3062760	3068400	finding you I like how you work that in there to play old things and my number one is gonna be
3068400	3072400	tying back to that so oh god I thought that was your number one okay it was supposed to be my
3072400	3076480	number one okay well I was gonna tie this together but I'm gonna go ahead and separate them okay
3076480	3081240	because it got mentioned already so I just figured I'd say it no I like that um as that
3081240	3085960	wants to point out not just fashion when it comes to retro to revival interior design yeah
3085960	3089760	textile that's a good people are really going actually back to that mid-century but I've seen
3089760	3098400	a and not to be stereotypical I've mostly seen it amongst my older gay male friends their houses
3098400	3104840	are decorated like the 1960s and I'm living for it and I love it and on top of that just for
3104840	3112560	me can I can we get one of them to decorate our place like a dorm room but oh but the other thing
3112560	3119520	too is that I've also been seeing amongst like straight white girls going for like a semi
3119520	3126400	Victorian slash 40s era aesthetic and it's been just kind of this interesting thing how we are
3126400	3131280	getting the retro aesthetic but it's in certain demographics you know what I mean so I'm only
3131280	3135240	laughing because this recent chat comment here and I'm like if you just want to sum up the last
3135240	3140340	decade of olr here it is in this chat comment from slag kick shout out to game buoy and stream
3140340	3146100	parks Allah who says yay I tuned in just to hear dark soccer talk about old gay men's kitschy
3146100	3152460	houses there put it put that quote on the back of the box and you know I'm right you know I'm
3152460	3157820	right all right but also the retro fashion thing like I was saying I can actually go and buy
3157820	3162460	flannels and jean skirts at the thrift store and dress like I did in high school okay and it's
3162460	3168500	fashionable honorable mentions before we get to number ones the fall of print gaming magazines
3168820	3173940	Nintendo power game Pro I think there was an official PlayStation magazine or something
3173940	3182020	that all ended in this decade early this decade um honorable mention for me would be probably the
3182020	3188980	accessibility of game creators on social media for better or for worse now I know this isn't unique to
3188980	3195060	2010 and this decade because Twitter technically was around what 2006 2007 but I think we've seen
3195900	3201140	especially when it comes to fans making demands for better and for worse unfortunately this wasn't
3201140	3205980	always a good thing and I think that's why I didn't want to put it in my top three but I think the
3205980	3212300	accessibility of gaming creators on social media has been a huge part of this decade I think it's
3212300	3220500	you know I think it's caused some people to listen to some things for good things sometimes and but
3220500	3224980	not always so I'll just kind of leave it at that and let you draw your own conclusions so all right
3224980	3231020	that in with me making friends with voice actors and motion-capped actors online because we there's
3231020	3236140	good news too there's good I'm basically Facebook friends now with like with the well who we've had
3236140	3243700	on the show Greg Berger he's such a nice guy oh sure and having chats on Twitter with Lady Bunny
3243700	3252020	I mean mostly with Lady Bunny lately but you know um a lot of the people are like have their own you
3252060	3256460	know instagrams and everything which leaves me then to my number one let's do it so here we go
3256460	3261020	you'll in your opinion and you are neither right nor wrong no you're right because it's your opinion
3261020	3268340	but you're not wrong you what you believe was the biggest gaming news of the decade number one truly
3268340	3276180	lead out with the the whole online gaming and streaming becoming gaming celebrities people who
3276180	3282980	would have been absolutely reviled when we were in middle school now doing this as their livelihood
3282980	3291060	and not just that I'm getting motion capture and voice actors doing streamings of the games that
3291060	3297180	they were in one of the ones I've been following is Brian Deschart who played one of the main
3297180	3304780	characters in Detroit become human and his wife who played one of the Tracy androids in the game
3305660	3311820	I've been watching them stream games sometimes in costume you know having our our video game
3311820	3317460	actors cosplaying like the group did for Mass Effect right you know I think that that's
3317460	3323500	absolutely fun and then you get to also you know sometimes you'll have them show up while other
3323500	3328100	people are streaming things and you get all the tie-ins and are and it goes back to what you're
3328140	3335540	saying our games are becoming and the people in them are becoming accessible it's not just oh you
3335540	3339740	see some names flashing on the screen in the credits you meet these people these are real
3339740	3345340	people and it becomes real to you and you see the work that they put into these games and then you
3345340	3351260	see people making it their livelihood it's just like our our gaming world has become highly
3351260	3356940	interactive and contrast that with the 80s when game makers were struggling to get credited
3356940	3362380	remember that's how Activision sneak him in that's how Activision became a thing was because
3362380	3369420	Activision was willing to release David Crane's pitfall whereas Atari never credited Howard Scott
3369420	3374300	Warshaw for creating NARS revenge or et for that matter I just need to get into the we all know
3374300	3379260	that wasn't as an easter egg on the credits yeah and as the credits but in the game code so you're
3379260	3385740	it's come a long way it is very different now that's yeah I like that so okay so how do we
3385740	3394460	succinctly put that number one is just the ability to access game creators who are playing their
3394460	3400500	games and streaming their games I'd say the interactivity of gaming culture okay it's gonna
3400500	3404380	be very yeah we're gonna we're gonna hear something very similar in a minute let's hear what
3404380	3411540	Loki is for number one we'll do eSports because eSports is just blown up since the early I mean
3411540	3418020	obviously eSports were around prior to 2010 but it's really blown up in the last 10 years so that's
3418020	3425700	definitely gonna be you know my pick I definitely given to the rise of such games like fortnight's
3425700	3435900	overwatch illegal legends dota counter-strike I mean there's just a lot of games that even
3435900	3442500	accessibility wise you know with modern PC is a lot of them don't need a really powerful PC to
3442500	3448860	run on and so you just have a lot of people getting into it and starting to recognize a lot
3448860	3454580	of these teams that are being formed there's official leagues now for games and with their
3454580	3463080	own you know setups in actual sports arenas and so it's very much becoming like you know the
3463080	3469440	physical sports genres the fact that you can plop down in front of the television and watch a League
3469440	3474560	of Legends match watch an overwatch match you might not necessarily do it on traditional TV
3474560	3479920	although certainly you can we do know traditional TV well nowadays you can because you're well I
3479920	3486080	mean it's not necessarily tuning in but smart TVs oh yeah twitch or mixer or what have you yeah yeah
3486080	3491720	so interesting all right now I love it eSports number one the rise of eSports I think we'll be
3491720	3495400	looking back at the end of the next decade and going you know what Overwatch League was kind of
3495400	3500360	the start of something huge I really do so and that may not necessarily just be overwatch but
3500360	3504560	it may be you know that was the first like big sports teams you know all that stuff it'll be
3504560	3507960	interesting to look back on that in ten years time yeah well I think you're gonna find that
3507960	3512960	all three of our number ones have a big common theme in common so I think we're on to something
3512960	3518720	here because my number one biggest gaming news of the decade would be the share button that's my
3518720	3525680	number one not specifically the PlayStation 4 share button although if you want to icon eyes
3525680	3531480	it was something I suppose that would work but I think that just would be the ease of being able
3531480	3537760	to share your gameplay with other people and the share these big professional whether it be these
3537760	3542920	big professional eSports matches whether it be celebrities and game makers reaching out to their
3542920	3547680	fans and celebrating the things that they've created or you know what a bunch of schmoes
3547680	3555560	in their spare room talking about video games for people willing to tune up but I know we've been
3555560	3563480	doing this show a long time right we've been doing this show for over 17 years and so I think we've
3563480	3572040	kind of is that for repo no no I thought you're saying it was a Cinderella song okay from the
3572040	3580920	80s but I think just the fact that it's so easy to what we were we were doing this early on
3580920	3584960	especially we start a podcast we were very much about trying to get the message you should apply
3584960	3589120	everybody should podcast we should get more voices out there we don't remember how especially the
3589120	3593440	early days of it was winger thanks Bobby okay remember the early days of podcasting we were
3593440	3598240	like we don't compete with other podcasts like because there were some podcasters out there that
3598240	3603960	want to make it a competition and sometimes there's a few still but for the most part it's
3603960	3607760	it's not a competition it really shouldn't be a competition it should be about trying to get
3607760	3614440	everybody's voices out there and getting everybody heard and people having the ability to say their
3614440	3620920	opinion because gaming is for everyone and so the fact that everybody can share and you can go join
3620920	3626640	whoever's couch you want and watch them play a game or watch them talk about a game or about
3626640	3631200	gaming culture what have you designing costumes and influenced by games what have you I think
3631200	3636320	has been the biggest thing about this decade and if you go back to last decade I would have said
3636320	3640760	my number one gaming story from the last decade was the advent of Xbox Live bringing gamers
3640760	3646240	together over the internet and now we go to this decade and it's about I think now kind of taking
3646240	3653280	that one step further bringing strangers together over the internet into communities and like
3653280	3657760	everybody's got their own community whether it be you know small tighten it and that's cool or or
3657760	3663760	gigantic you know ninja type of you know communities it's all of that so what would you
3663760	3670760	say then your disappointment is of the decade oh my biggest disappointment of the decade well I
3670760	3677040	wasn't ready to talk about that you're going off script let's see my biggest gaming disappointment
3677040	3687280	of the decade I have a couple I know it's easy I think um I think Kickstarter yeah I think I
3687280	3691440	honestly that's the thing that goes to now not everything on Kickstarter has been a disaster
3691440	3695640	you know I've kick-started some things such as like ant stream and so forth that have I think
3695640	3701400	used Kickstarter very well but I think we've seen too many things use Kickstarter poorly I think we
3701400	3707480	saw like just this rush of stuff going to Kickstarter really fast that and then people
3707480	3712200	that didn't turn around the things that they were promising money for and I think people had in their
3712200	3717200	mind something different so I'm not saying the news was always bad with Kickstarter but unfortunately
3717200	3723600	I think we found that there's more sad face stories than good face stories so Bobby did make
3723600	3727360	an honorable mention for my disappointment of the year and that's having to do Halo is a classic
3727360	3733320	game but you did it for charity it was I did it for my mother and charity all of you especially
3733320	3741400	someone donated 200 bucks thank you for keeping my mother fed and housed and now she has a job
3741400	3749120	she can afford to live and I my mom cried on the phone thanks to you guys so that's another way
3749120	3755360	that our our culture has become interactive is the fact that I did GoFundMe for that you were
3755360	3758680	mentioning Kickstarter which Kickstarter also is super disappointed me because they're anti
3758680	3766640	unionizing but I mean y'all y'all really came through to help out my mom and I appreciate it
3766640	3773760	least I could do was do but I have a couple of disappointments one of them is that we're still
3773760	3780960	talking about violence video games like it's thing oh like the way the mass media or mainstream media
3780960	3786200	I don't know what it's called a blamed video games after Sandy Hook yep yep they blame everything
3786200	3792240	except the fucking problem you're looking for a scapegoat instead of looking at the companies
3792240	3798480	that are lining your fucking pockets the NRA is a terrorist organization leave it at that that's a
3798480	3804560	the that whole scapegoating of video games is a great call-out for disappointments of the decade
3804560	3814120	absolutely my other ones Bioware where Bioware is now Loki well a tie-in with where Bioware is
3814120	3822000	now I would say the monetization of modern video games by somebody was gonna say this because if
3822000	3826720	you want to talk about how companies are ruining the industries you can just look at all the loot
3826720	3833040	boxes and the constant double dipping monetization you know taking stuff out of games that was just
3833040	3837560	commonplace like cheat codes and stuff like that and selling them back to you or taking content
3837560	3842360	out of games that you know in the previous version it was included with it now it's part of a season
3842360	3847560	pass just all the different things that you know they're they're like well we're not raising the
3847560	3851160	price of games but at the same time they're selling you a $50 season pass they're selling
3851160	3860160	you costumes that got like for example my son wanted a he wanted V bucks for fortnight $25
3860160	3866840	where the V bucks you know what he bought with V bucks he bought one costume one costume was like
3866840	3872200	20 bucks in the game granted I know it's a free-to-play game but still you have like
3872200	3878960	Activision stuff selling skins and stuff like that and Call of Duty for near the same price
3878960	3883880	in a $60 game that you just bought a season pass for that you're also paying for the special
3883880	3889680	edition and all this other shit and then they come back out with the neck you know next year
3889720	3895360	it's oh hey look at this it's a new version gotta buy all that shit again because we have to sell
3895360	3902160	you that red dot scope for you another $10 or whatever at least fortnight just constantly you
3902160	3908200	know everything goes with you on top of that you have this I mean really it goes not to beat a
3908200	3913600	political socio-economic dead horse but it all goes back to capitalism and the fact that not
3913600	3920000	only are they basically draining society for all of this money that's also now while we have the
3920000	3924320	gaming addiction pop in and people are spending their money on this like they're gambling but we
3924320	3928040	also do have the way that these companies are treating their employees at the expense of their
3928040	3934040	user base and their employees mental and physical health and they're also dodging taxes and their
3934040	3939880	CEOs are getting paid millions of million dollars they're laying off thousands of people I mean it's
3939880	3946920	just it's like any other big company nowadays but and the moment they try to unionize the companies
3946920	3955480	are are stabbing down we've needed a video game lobby and Union for a long time the tech industry
3955480	3960680	needs unions but we just had that issue with Google where they were firing people for creating a way
3960680	3966720	for their employees to unionize I'm getting way off topic with this but I eat like this all sparked
3966720	3970440	in my head this whole discussion because I was literally having a conversation with Bobby earlier
3970440	3977360	today about a B's a b5 here in California which is the whole it's very it's a very controversial law
3977360	3980600	and I think it was kind of targeting the uber and lyft thing but it's kind of having these
3980600	3985440	ramifications because I actually had to go to Bobby and ask are we it just is a b5 gonna screw
3985440	3991840	us because olr produces more than 35 episodes in a year in California does that make us employees
3991840	3996680	because if so we're done because this we don't make money doing that you guys know that I mean
3996680	4000200	you guys are very kind with your biddies but you guys know that that basically pays the cost of
4000200	4002960	running a business and things behind the scene we don't we don't make money so we can't pay for
4002960	4008920	things like workers comp and you know the things that I think isn't it for businesses over certain
4008920	4016160	it are for contractors no it has to meet an ABC test so for vog specifically I think it we fail
4016160	4021840	criteria a because vog does not mean I'm getting a little under the hood here but vog does not
4021840	4026760	mandate the content that's created you all have the right to not show up for work and nothing
4026760	4031600	happens you all have because it's not work exactly so and we can talk we have the freedom to talk
4031600	4037800	about whatever we want so if I think for that reason it's not a registered business it is it
4037800	4044400	isn't in Georgia yeah so but we're not a Californian business so but we if you have California
4044400	4049920	contractors which exactly I would say we're none of those things yeah we don't have a contract
4049920	4055720	sign so I don't think that really yeah so anyway but the reason why I bring that up I'm not trying
4055720	4061720	to make it about us I'm trying to make it about these contractors that make games and work for
4061720	4065880	things like Google and stuff this is gonna be an interest this law is gonna have an interesting
4065880	4072080	kind of but I know a lot of my artist friends are freaking out because it's gonna cause jobs to go
4072080	4077320	outside California because people don't want to hire like musicians that make you know little
4077320	4083120	compositions here and there can't can't do more than 35 of them for a single company and that could
4083120	4087680	be damning so I think the laws I think gonna get tweaked a little bit before we really see its
4087680	4094520	final form but it's interesting so anyway sorry I completely derailed a little bit but it was it
4094520	4102160	was the whole loot box conversation but yeah you know as season passes you know whatever you want
4102160	4108120	to say there it's just other ways that they're trying to monetize games because they're saying
4108120	4112960	they're not making enough money because like you look at it this way so say you have you know
4112960	4118520	everybody that buys Call of Duty one year you know it's gonna buy the game the next year and say they
4118520	4124760	they keep okay so if everybody buys Call of Duty one year and then buys it the next year they're
4124760	4128720	making the same out profit their profits aren't going up they need to find more ways to make more
4128720	4134840	money well the problem is like that it's gonna keep going up and eventually people only have
4134840	4139520	finite amount of money they're not gonna be able to spend you know as much as you want them to
4139520	4146960	spend so it's just it's not sustainable all right I'm psychic and chat saying I think my biggest I
4146960	4152260	I'll get to you oh is he you want to read this yeah both of us because Bobby actually makes a
4152260	4156280	better another point that ties into it so you go first I'll go first with psychic I think my
4156280	4160640	biggest gaming disappointment of the decade is toxic gamer behavior not that it's new to this
4160640	4165680	decade but we've really seen a boil over this decade and Bobby brings it out the the gamer
4165680	4170360	that the behavior was always there we just didn't see it to social media and that also ties back
4170360	4176880	into having that interactivity with gamer culture you also get the the CD underbelly as well well I
4176880	4181000	think going back to the whole concept of the share button and again I don't literally mean PlayStation
4181000	4185160	4 share button but you know you guys know what I mean the the ease of sharing your your gameplay
4185160	4191720	it's caught it's it's made the ability to make an echo chamber really really easy people don't
4191720	4196120	want to learn yeah people want that confirmation bias so I mean that's why we now have a major
4196120	4201840	problem with in cells with their you know rise of hate groups again because they have this little
4201840	4207400	pocket in the current administration honestly enough makes it easy for them all right let's
4207400	4212000	move on I want to talk about now we've talked about gaming news of the decade I want to talk
4212000	4216240	about games of the decade this is here I thought we'd have a short show tonight but the single
4216240	4219920	topic is taking up a good chunk of it that's good because the news we have to get through is quick
4219920	4227080	so let's talk about the top three games of the decade and I know we're gonna have overlap here
4227080	4231520	I'm gonna I'm trying to think I'm gonna like start with least I want to almost I almost want
4231520	4235840	to like write down listen three I think dark soccer is gonna pick in the three I think Loki's
4235840	4240560	gonna pick but let's see let's see if I'm right I'll be honest and let you know if I I would guess
4240560	4245000	that or not we'll do three two one just like we did before so let's go around our soccer your
4245000	4258480	number three game of the decade now I've got a tie here I'm gonna say portal to I would have
4258480	4261680	guessed that would show up I'm only gonna pick games that I personally have played a significant
4261680	4267240	amount of yes and and to be clear these are our personal games of the decade we're not wrong
4267240	4271680	because there are personal games of the decade the thing is I have four I cannot pick it's hard
4271680	4275040	another one well we'll give you a spot for no we're doing two three two one you don't need to
4275040	4283000	pick another one one can be an honorable mention okay so portal two is number three and why oh just
4283000	4288640	because it was really fun I mean the whole portal series honestly was really great but portal two
4288640	4294040	took all the fun in portal and then really just like oh we know we know what jokes you like we're
4294040	4298400	gonna make it even better and you have the interactivity you have a lot more history behind
4298400	4304640	you know Aperture Science and you've got the old style labs and the propulsion gel it was so much
4304640	4310640	fun and the dialogue was so hilarious plus I also like to to go behind the scenes and break things
4310640	4315760	in it so I just found it to be super fun it was one of the ones I was the most excited for and
4315760	4322840	one of the ones I have played on repeat many times so okay there it is number three portal
4322840	4331880	to Loki I'm gonna go to you what was your number three best game of the decade um well this would
4331880	4337120	these are all based on like the amount of fun that I had with them so let's see I'm gonna start with
4337120	4351440	I guess it would yes it's a toss-up between I would have to say ingress just because I you
4351440	4356880	know kind of that got me into the whole AR gaming stuff and so good flying because that isn't even
4356880	4362000	on my list and you know how much I play that game yes so like I I would think because you know it
4362720	4368880	not now so much but like before we're looking at the decade yeah so ingress paved the way
4368880	4375160	for more yeah so like I did play that pretty heavily for a while and you know it was a lot
4375160	4381320	of fun met a lot of people doing that and you know kind of snowball off into like you know
4381320	4388080	Pokemon go and stuff like that but yeah so I'd say it was definitely a unique game for its time
4388080	4396560	and yeah so that's okay um I mean it's a if I were to look at like games I played the most
4396560	4400400	that would definitely be up there especially yesterday I know we haven't gotten into our
4400400	4403960	gaming weeks yet but I played a lot of English so I played so much ingress yesterday that I
4403960	4408760	actually said and I said to my chat group I said I am I am off the clock today for anger I'm not
4408760	4412920	playing ingress today so if they field over the neighborhood somebody else needs to handle it
4412920	4419000	because I am burned out after yesterday but I mean games are fun right yeah but I agree with
4419000	4426280	you there's been so many like social elements of it that have bettered my life so you know yeah
4426280	4432000	but I'm also trying to when I pick my top three I'm trying to be like half selfish half like
4432000	4438560	judging the impact and artistic vision so for that reason ingress prime is kind of yeah so I
4438560	4442080	there's some things where I'm like I didn't put on my top three for that reason but I get it I
4442080	4448200	get what you're saying so what did I put on my top three I put as my number three game and I
4448200	4452560	know there's gonna be over half a lap here so I apologize in advance I just know it like I I would
4452560	4460960	like just I I'm gonna quit the show if there's not overlapping but Jamie's laughing she knows
4460960	4466800	what I'm about to say my number three pick would be Mass Effect 3 for one of my games of the day
4467200	4473800	is there a little overlap there yeah although we'll get to it we'll get to it we'll hold on
4473800	4478120	that one so my number three pick is Mass Effect 3 and the reason why I'm saying Mass Effect 3 I'm
4478120	4484800	not saying Mass Effect 2 I did decide to pick 3 specifically because I made a lot of memories
4484800	4490800	with the multiplayer mode in that game for me that was what got me to play multiplayer for sure I
4490800	4495160	mean I think that multiplayer was really like underestimated by a lot of the gaming public
4495160	4499920	because we had that whole hubba blue about the ending and everything that was going on with that
4499920	4504960	which is is actually is another reason I kind of put it on my games of the decade list I think
4504960	4510640	Mass Effect 3 and that fan reaction for better for worse I I still think to this day it was a
4510640	4517480	much bigger to do than it needed to be but I'm glad they did a free DLC that just expanded on
4517480	4523480	it I mean I even if I don't necessarily like the how we got there I'm more than satisfied with the
4523520	4529800	end product it was the game that had me running a blog for five years with 10,000 followers yeah
4529800	4538280	mass effecting tumblr.com and yeah I mean is that in chat says Citadel DLC total fan service
4538280	4544800	absolutely like I love the Citadel's DLC us like that one more one more for the road did you notice
4544800	4551240	that the the apartment complex was called Tiberius towers no I never noticed that that's funny well
4551240	4559200	you know with a reference there James Tiberius Kirk yeah so yeah so I would say yeah Mass Effect
4559200	4565000	3 just um the story was so important and the multiplayer especially in three just I think put
4565000	4572040	it I realize why people prefer to sometimes but I think just that yeah I just love the multiplayer
4572040	4576200	kind of puts three above two for me so there you go that's my number three game of the decade so
4576200	4581960	Dark Soccer what's your number two to game of the decade Dragon Age Inquisition I played a shitload
4581960	4588280	of Dragon Age Inquisition and I really love Dragon Age 2 and I really love the first Dragon Age but
4588280	4596360	Inquisition it I will Mass Effect got me into modding but Inquisition was where I went nuts
4596360	4605800	like even like doing a little bit of like personal modding to it myself the story was great it it
4605800	4610400	took characters that I wanted to see more of and really brought them into the light it played a lot
4610400	4616480	more on what I had expected about the whole you know the Dalish don't have the whole story because
4616480	4625520	it's a lot like religion today people don't know they weren't there it really I liked it too because
4625520	4631680	it seemed to me almost like the start I was seeing some historical corollaries to it like the
4631680	4639400	beginning of the Reformation for example and how they're the the mages were rebelling against their
4639400	4644480	circles and things like it was a lot more to that I really liked the commentary in it I really loved
4644480	4649880	the characters I just was completely enamored with the whole game and it almost was my number
4649880	4657200	one it almost truly was my number one and I every so often I get there to go back and play it if my
4657200	4664920	computer would ever fucking not shut down on me you need to fix my RAM all right I'm not not
4664920	4669800	totally surprised by that pick in my head it wasn't on the top three I'd written for you but
4669800	4673240	now that you said it I'm like oh yeah of course she's gonna put Dragon Age in my vision up there
4673240	4678240	of course so all right I know a lot of people a lot of people love the Dragon Age so I'm not
4678240	4683040	surprised to hear that Loki you're number two my number two pick is gonna be the Elder Scrolls
4683080	4690400	5 Skyrim yeah that would have been on my top three for you because of mods because I have played that
4690400	4696200	game so much so many times I've I don't even know how many hours I spent in that game and I would
4696200	4703680	still go back and play that game again because it's a great game and I really like I'm hoping
4703680	4711720	that the next game is just as good I mean really it was it's it was such a great game and yeah I
4711880	4720800	mean it I don't know I bought it so many times who knows that game in many ways has lasted longer
4720800	4726040	than almost any other game this decade you know like they just put that out on the switch like
4726040	4729960	what was that like two years ago like if that yeah like maybe maybe it was just last year actually
4729960	4735000	they put that on the switch I mean that game had an that game had the life cycle of what a console
4735000	4739560	would have usually pretty much yeah I mean and yeah they're obviously the rain joke is that they
4739560	4744480	put it on everything but like it's a great game and so I I don't have a problem with them doing
4744480	4752040	that actually but yeah so that that's definitely gonna be my pick all right so my number two pick
4752040	4757920	for game of the decade I think is going to be both surprising and not surprising at all because I
4757920	4763280	think when we look back on the games that really defined and made this decade you are not gonna
4763280	4766680	find a list that doesn't have Pokemon go on it and that's my number two game of the decade is
4766680	4775960	Pokemon go there was nothing like that first month that Pokemon go was out it was transformative in
4775960	4782760	culture it the fact that people were swarming places like old town which was struggling to
4782760	4792800	get business and Pokemon go was helping the local economy that's how big this fucking game was now
4792800	4798960	I realize it's not what it was then but the fact that it's still going pretty darn strongly and
4798960	4804440	making as much money as it is three years after the fact I think still does leave lead something
4804440	4814120	to be said but I just I think Pokemon go finally made mobile gaming really cool it really brought
4814120	4820120	an experience and yes I know in believe me I know Ingress laid the groundwork for all of this but
4820120	4826040	Pokemon put that Mickey Mouse-esque face on it which obviously is Pikachu is what I really mean
4826040	4831280	here but it put that real mascot and it put that you know made more people kind of want to jump in
4831280	4837680	and experience it for themselves and you know it was I would see these tweets that would be like I
4837680	4844960	got to say for the first time ever mom I'm leaving the house and I'm going to catch Pokemon I am
4844960	4850440	living my childhood dream right now do that with Dan hey I'm going out to do pokey Manning exactly
4850440	4858040	and Harry Potter Pokemon go made that a reality and that's something that we had never experienced
4858040	4865520	in games but now that door is kind of open and that AR gaming space has been blown open even
4865520	4871680	more so and so forth and I just I just think in many many ways like no game has been as
4871760	4877120	transformative I know it's interesting I'm not saying this as my number one paper it'll make
4877120	4883400	sense when I tell you my number one that I don't think any game is is gonna have that kind of impact
4883400	4891080	in some ways I think permanently on gaming culture as Pokemon go is had honestly so yeah that's that's
4891080	4897120	it that's my pick I'm sticking to it Pokemon go my number two game of the decade um so honorable
4897120	4900840	mansions before number one if you want to say all right now I'm gonna tell people why I'm not picking
4900920	4905560	Breath of the Wild because I actually did not play it Dan played it I was his navigator and I'm only
4905560	4911440	picking stuff that I played so as much as I love Breath of the Wild and trust me I love it I didn't
4911440	4918480	play it so I'm not picking it there's oh go ahead that's I'm saying why I'm not mentioning it as my
4918480	4922240	honorable mention but you had a comment oh no I thought you're oh I thought that was your honorable
4922240	4929640	mention okay sorry my my own rule but odd that the danganronpa fucking love danganronpa it's
4929640	4937360	just a mindfuck of a game I love danganronpa too don't get me wrong I was really into the anime
4937360	4945160	though I was so hooked on just what began with the first game and it's aesthetic it was just I
4945160	4950160	mean it was a really great game really engaging I really got into the characters I really cared
4950160	4956440	about what happened to them except for the otaku guy who was voiced by Rama's voice actor I can't
4956440	4961440	always forget his name like he's a manga artist in the game anyway but I really like that it also
4961440	4966880	played up on all these stereotypes and everything in various Japanese genre you know and but
4966880	4973120	otherwise it was just it was great storytelling it really brought I think spike Chunsoft a lot
4973120	4980720	more into the eye of Western audiences and really I can't say good enough about it I love danganronpa
4980720	4990160	there you go great any honorable mentions from you lucky yeah I had a few so like I was I'd had
4990160	4994760	to say probably like call of duty my warfare 3 because I had a lot of fun that my co-workers
4994760	5003920	Super Mario Odyssey was another one that I you know thought was pretty good Grand Theft Auto 5
5003920	5010040	almost was my number one just because I I I would have bet that was your number one you know why
5010640	5016480	here's why cuz like I love Grand Theft Auto but I had so much more fun with Grand Theft Auto 4 than
5016480	5022360	5 because I I would still be playing for if it had in the mod if I could get my mods to be working
5022360	5028800	I could play my coworkers I'd still be playing for but 5 I just got lost interest with it cuz
5028800	5033600	they didn't add any expansions to it or then they have online but I just didn't really care for
5033800	5042600	online too much so that's why 5 that was not really my number one it might be tied and I
5042600	5052120	don't know it's pretty good but and then of course I you know I think Saints Row third or and I would
5052120	5057600	say maybe like Saints Row 4 in there somewhere but God I'm so curious what number one is so
5058240	5065600	yeah so that's it all right well maybe I'll knock some surprising ones out for you here so my
5065600	5070200	honorable mentions would include Final Fantasy 14 around reborn would definitely be an honorable
5070200	5076320	mention up there really hard not to put that on my top three but just I think the three games I
5076320	5080080	picked kind of represent all something very different but you can't like we're gonna look
5080080	5083960	back on this decade and look at things and I think collectively with Final Fantasy 14 realm
5084240	5090320	I'm gonna include with that Diablo 3 No Man's Sky and these games that have really reinvented
5090320	5094840	themselves after a launch that didn't maybe necessarily go the way that was planned which
5094840	5100240	maybe is why I didn't totally feel like I should put it in my top three but I obviously I love what
5100240	5104760	Final Fantasy 14 has become and so obviously it's very worthy of an honorable mention other games I
5104760	5113400	would put in there Zelda Breath of the Wild Super Mario maker absolutely I feel like dreams will
5113400	5117840	join this list but it's too soon I don't know what decade we're gonna get to put that in next
5117840	5122600	so I guess maybe well it's coming out next in February what year was little big planet
5122600	5128800	released that was is nine thousand something because I saw a little bit bent plan to talk
5128800	5134360	in okay then I would say a little bit planet three well you know horrible mention you know
5134360	5138960	I haven't some played it how about how about the force or how about Forza Horizon 3 it's not
5139920	5146520	absolutely and yeah I think those are those are some of my games and I forgot to mention
5146520	5156360	also to until dawn rush of blood because that's one of my favorite VR games I would say also I
5156360	5160600	think I need to say an honorable mention Beat Saber I think you get an honorable mention as
5160600	5166280	well I think and for what it's doing for VR gaming even if you know maybe VR gaming still
5166280	5170920	hasn't kind of got that big inertia to go like really forward I think Beat Saber is definitely
5170920	5176720	like like it's starting to you know it's it's getting noticed you know what I mean it's causing
5176720	5181680	to be our thing to get noticed another honorable mention what's that Bayonetta was painted at this
5181680	5187320	time was it I thought they had a two definitely was yeah why am I not thinking that Bayonetta
5187320	5191760	was this decade I know sometimes it's hard to remember exactly what your things are released
5191760	5201400	in so yeah I was in Japan October 2009 and North American Europe January 2010 so technically make
5201400	5210440	Wow okay all right so it counts because we didn't get it until yeah that's fair yeah okay let's do
5210440	5215520	number ones I'm so he'd like a lot well I I'm pretty sure I know Dark Soccer's but I'm super
5215520	5219360	curious but I want to hear her talk about it because I know she loves loves this more than
5219360	5225360	anything so Dark Soccer your number one pick for game of the decade Mass Effect 3 and the big
5225360	5237160	reason is that not only did I you know I thought it was a great game I thought that I really it's
5237160	5244560	really hard for me to put into it cuz it really got me into like the the kind of what's the word
5244560	5250160	I'm thinking of like the the playing a game for the characters for the romance element for the
5250160	5255160	story behind it not necessarily I mean it even had a story mode in it where you could skip the
5255160	5259320	combat and just do the story stuff but don't play it that way no you do miss some stuff that happens
5259320	5262920	during the combat that you want to see and you do also miss like really good items just saying
5262920	5271160	you know um and also on a personal note it really got me I guess my a little bit more internet
5271160	5277040	notoriety because I had Mass Effect and I still get messages from people asking me to bring it
5277040	5284600	back and I'm like dude I have no content I have literally recycled the same comments over okay
5284600	5293560	my blog has its own alternate universe in it now where Shepard can't drive shit and she has comments
5293560	5300160	about Garris being a smartass Turian all the time and like just different things that are like not
5300200	5306640	even it's more like headcanon verse it's just so crazy you know you ask somebody and I even like I
5306640	5310880	don't even know how he got started on Mass Effect yeah yeah there was this blog I used to follow
5310880	5318240	that kind of has an update I'm like is it Mass Effecting yeah that was mine what and but I
5318240	5323640	really just kind of connected with people and Mass Effect 3 is what got me into trying to draw again
5323760	5332360	because you remember I had like the 24 femshep art challenge yeah yeah yeah after I had had surgery
5332360	5338600	on my wrist and I'd already had two other surgeries on my hand so drawing was hard for me and it really
5338600	5343240	encouraged me to take a more realistic style and I tried to do like a little bit more realistic
5343240	5350040	coloring with the characters and and just do all kinds of different stuff and it really broke me
5350040	5354800	out of an art rut of course you know going back in and trying to draw my my hand still but I was
5354800	5360720	live-streaming my drawings that goes back to the interactivity with community but it really brought
5360720	5366640	out a lot of creativity in me it brought out I wrote fanfiction of course I also wrote this big
5366640	5371400	long ass Dragon Age fanfic a bunch of them and before I even knew what the official ending of
5371400	5377000	the series was going to be but people like it I still I got a favorite a thing on AO3 yesterday
5377000	5383760	a kudo for a fanfic I wrote six years ago or five years ago however long it was my Mass Effect
5383760	5389160	fanfiction still gets likes on it I'm like dude I haven't written anything since two years after
5389160	5394360	Mass Effect 3 came out I think it's safe to say like Mass Effect kind of like you became your
5394360	5400360	fandom in this decade it really really it was and I say this from my perspective too and I think you
5400360	5404800	you are in the same page you and I both never never expected especially after like seeing the
5404800	5408440	first game and playing a little bit of it like never thought this was gonna be a series we'd
5408440	5417600	fall into as hard as we did. Thanks Shane. That's a thanks Shane game. Yes. And on top of that you
5417600	5423240	know I think that at any point in the future we could say you know I really want to play Mass
5423240	5428600	Effect all of Mass Effect again and you sit down and you marathon the shit out of it. Please please
5428680	5435640	please if there is a deity in this in the sky or wherever this deity is we need a Mass Effect
5435640	5442680	trilogy remaster for the next for PS5 X sex. Screw that I've already modded mine high res mod there's
5442680	5447840	a great series of high res mods. That and Final Fantasy 13 please and thank you. The the other
5447840	5453640	thing too though is that I mean it did bring about this big surge in game modding I mean I
5453640	5457960	don't know if maybe Skyrim might have had the level of modding it did if not for what we had
5457960	5464560	in the the Bioware games. I think modding PC games has been a thing for a very long time but sure.
5464560	5471040	Well I just think that it was those Bioware games that really did it but that also kind of broke my
5471040	5479280	heart over Mass Effect Andromeda I played through it don't get me wrong I it fuck you Bioware just
5479280	5484160	fuck you okay screw your anthem bullshit you can take it and shove it up your ass cuz you fucked
5484160	5493400	over a great series for a failure really for a failure. I I still that that rests on a board
5493400	5499680	room at EA for me not so much. But Bioware was at their mercy I mean essentially now Bioware is
5499680	5509840	just a subset of EA yeah and also fuck them for not giving me my Quarian DLC and I'm putting it
5509840	5514080	out as a book. I mean I'm glad to get it one way or another but you're still screwing us over.
5514080	5520440	We'll try to look back on the Fonder memories of Mass Effect 3 yes. Is a failure and they're a
5520440	5527280	failure for making that failure. All right let's get to number ones I am dying to know this one
5527280	5536600	Loki. My number one pick is gonna be of course Minecraft because it's Minecraft game it came
5536600	5543280	out in 2011 officially oh yeah it's official releases into that okay yeah I see what you're
5543280	5550320	doing if I can get Bayonetta all right fine it's hey it's his list yeah so minecraft because I
5550320	5556680	think it was just such a phenomenal game it still is a phenomenal game and it's they just continually
5556680	5562680	update it so we'll have to wait until we get a minecraft 2 but yeah hey I saw the vog minecraft
5562680	5567160	account tweet the other day yeah yeah you thinking about getting back into it I yeah exactly cuz
5567160	5572200	apparently hosting bedrock servers is a thing now so if anybody's interested I'm thinking about
5572200	5576440	actually hosting a bedrock server because one I don't have to maintain it because that was a
5576440	5580600	pain in the ass with the mod stuff but and bedrock stuffs a little bit more accessible for a lot of
5580600	5584600	these folks because you don't have to have the Java client to run it you can do it with any of
5584600	5590680	the console versions any of the mobile versions to all login we can all play together no matter
5590680	5599080	what console you play on so that might be a thought because I was you know my I well and
5599080	5604360	I'll get into it in gaming week or whatever but like my son was wanted to stream yesterday and so
5604360	5608520	he did that for a little bit on minecraft but then I noticed it I'm like it's like connect the servers
5608520	5614040	I'm like the realms are these realms that you want me to connect to and I was like wait a second no
5614040	5617240	these are actual servers and they have like game modes and stuff like that and so I did some
5617240	5624360	research like oh we can actually host my bedrock servers now and now that like playstation switch
5624360	5628440	xbox are all in the same universe you might get better adoption than you had the first time where
5628440	5632040	it was like you kind of had to be on pc yeah because now you can just be on anything so you
5632040	5636200	might get better yeah sure that's excluding everybody that has the pc version non-windows
5636200	5642600	10 version you know from it but you can't please everybody yeah you can't please everybody so all
5642600	5649960	right um okay my number one pick any guesses I already know what it is do you I do okay
5649960	5655320	I'm still surprised you didn't mention any gta though he did I did my honorable mentions yeah
5655320	5659400	I've been I must have been busy eating all right I already know I already know what it is okay all
5659400	5664600	right we'll see we'll see if you're right or not all right uh so when we look at the games the
5664600	5672360	decade in my my opinion there's one game that really just transcended I think everything else
5672680	5680120	there was one game that made people question can games really be art because this guy this game
5680120	5685320	and I already put that as normal mention this game let me let me do my monologue now y'all cut off
5685320	5691640	we're all cut off from that and then there's one game that really made people go um our games art
5692280	5697880	there's one game that took uh the concept of online gaming and put a whole new spin on it
5697880	5704600	that had never been seen before there's one game that was like a painting that was moving and I
5704600	5710840	think playing it I just I get I get chills just thinking about this game and the art that it is
5710840	5715640	and what it brought us and I think it unlocked all these just new doors in gaming it really did and
5716200	5721000	that's why my my game of the decade is journey on uh playstation 3 and playstation 4 is that
5721000	5727320	what you would have guessed yes yeah no it's absolutely uh absolutely journey is the game
5727320	5731400	of the decade and I think uh you know again it's the game that that has a lot of people going
5731400	5736760	it wasn't that the game was was Roger Ebert still alive when that came out because I feel like that
5736760	5739960	was the game that was brought to him because remember he'd written that whole piece about
5739960	5744520	video games can't be art and remember how people were like okay boomer I mean they weren't saying
5744520	5750920	that but it was the the 2014 equivalent of that so um and and somebody had actually brought him
5750920	5755240	journey and he kind of he didn't really go back on what he said but he kind of like put out this
5755240	5760520	thing that was like I see where the passion is and I see what that is all about oh shadow of
5760520	5765880	the colossus thank you act f so sorry I thought for some reason it was it was um journey um
5766840	5772360	and some folks uh commenting in chat uh questmaster saying for me journey feels like a very zen
5772360	5779000	experience it is it's it's kind of a short game but I think that's what I mean we bobby blackwolf
5779000	5783000	and I and some other folks from vogue uh and other friends of mine went to magfest a couple
5783000	5787960	years ago where they did a live playthrough with a live orchestra doing the game from start to
5787960	5792920	finish and you know it was only about an hour and a half or what have you but it was it was beautiful
5792920	5800040	like I just I was I was moved by a fucking video game but that's the beautiful thing about this
5800040	5805160	past decade video games have cemented themselves as art and I think journey is the exemplary
5805160	5808440	example of that there is something that actually a little surprised you and I didn't mention
5808440	5812520	although I did make a mention of it earlier was everybody's gone to the rapture I you know what I
5813000	5816120	left out of my honorable mentions I was actually going to say everybody's gone to the rapture
5816120	5821000	specifically to represent the um narrative gaming but you did bring it up earlier in the show at
5821000	5827160	least so we haven't ignored them completely but yeah for sure but that was that because I didn't
5827160	5831480	play journey I didn't have the system at the time all right I think I did but dam was monopolizing
5831480	5834920	it or something and quickly while we finish this side call I want to see you guys in chat I've
5834920	5838280	seen you guys been saying some things but you guys in chat what's your game of the decade I want to
5838280	5841080	read some of these real quick here in a minute what's your game of the decade and why in a
5841080	5847720	sentence um what oh it's you hadn't played journey yet I think is it out on pc now I can't remember
5847720	5855320	um I can't play I know that they put out a few games on epic game store I think it is yeah but
5855320	5860120	they also want to throw up we have a lot more mac gaming now yeah I'm pretty sure it is because I
5860120	5871880	want to say yeah that came out uh um yeah see it ported to windows um 2019 of june the other the
5871880	5875880	other part about journey I didn't dive into as much but the whole fact that you weren't alone
5875880	5879400	in that game remember that was the twist and I think all these years later I can finally say the
5879400	5886280	twist in the game is that you have somebody there with you hopefully that person may have run off on
5886280	5890760	their own but you may end up having somebody with you and you don't realize it like when you don't
5890760	5895160	realize that the first time you're playing it is that you think is this an npc what is this and all
5895160	5898920	you can do you can't talk you can't use voice all you have is a little chirp you can do like a
5898920	5904280	little chirp button and do stuff but the way you would work together with that other person some
5904280	5908840	or you might not that person might run off and do their own thing who knows but when it works it
5908840	5913640	works so well that you and this other person are kind of in this experience together helping each
5913640	5918360	other out using your limited methods of communication I mean that is it's beautiful
5918360	5924200	like and it's there's nothing like it in gaming yeah and I think that moment that moment really
5924200	5931160	like when I realized this is another person this isn't just an npc this is another person at their
5931160	5937640	playstation right now I have no idea who it is you find out at the end of the game but you know it's
5937640	5944440	just all you know is a gamer tag I did though liken it to um the translated uh canned phrases
5944440	5949080	though from final fantasy 11 because that was always something that I enjoyed was the fact that
5949080	5953880	you could play with an international audience you just had to know the quirks like don't examine
5953880	5959800	somebody because it means you're staring at them you know different things like that um but you uh
5959800	5963720	loki weren't you talking about being able to play with people at like two in the morning yes because
5963720	5968920	no one wanted to have a bard in their damn party but still I like that's another thing for the
5968920	5973880	Japanese really more that we're seeing more more unique ways of communicating with people outside
5973880	5979640	of our own culture yeah anyway um I want to go you're right and something like journey you did
5979640	5984360	language didn't matter the game had its own language it's just god I love that game all
5984360	5989720	right anyway um so um other comments from chat about games of the decade act f says pokemon go
5989720	5993560	it's been a total experience throughout the years fifth dream today says file has he 14

6056680	6060280	see I wouldn't have even thought that was this decade unfortunately it's been so long now
6061000	6064760	I would have thought four was this decade but I would have thought three was the last decade
6064760	6069880	I guess was it 2012 I guess it would have been about 2012 huh wow no good pick good pick or even
6069880	6074440	like you know like kind of along with rock band you know one of the things I thought was kind of
6074440	6079240	impactful was rock band beatles remember when they had like the trailer for them and stuff
6079240	6083720	uh october 26 2010 for rock band three uh she hoax has heavy rain
6085640	6091560	absolutely so great picks you guys all right wow uh so our kickoff topic only went for uh two hours

6097480	6101960	year I'm actually now I'm really glad I didn't schedule those tonight because I was like well
6101960	6105960	next week's probably going to be a slow news week too so we're going to give one more week for
6105960	6110120	everybody to assess their game of the year this year specifically which I don't think I heard
6110120	6116200	any 2019 games on the decade list so that'll still be a surprise so uh games of the year
6116200	6122360	we'll talk about next week uh and the time capsule next week so uh because I anticipate next week's

6146920	6152680	cool um so uh what I've been playing I've been playing pokemon sword I've been playing what the
6152680	6158760	golf game's fucking weird but I love it yes it's like it reminds me of katamari though with its
6158760	6165560	weirdness yes it makes me think of a keita takahashi game did you play wadam yet no not yet
6165560	6173960	oh get on that because I can't um I've been playing uh pokemon go I like I said the other
6173960	6182040	week I uninstalled uh idle pouring um I'm playing uh pocket camp playing the harry potter game I
6182040	6188520	have not spent any more money on it nor will I um until rallying is dead or goes back on her turf
6188520	6196520	ways um I I really that's been about it for for the gaming oh yeah I've gone back to playing
6196520	6203320	patterned um because I realized that because it's on apple arcade I can play it on my mac
6203960	6208520	and so I'm revisiting some of the levels that I really enjoyed in it plus they have they've
6208520	6213640	released some new ones since I last completely finished the game so I'm pretty happy with it
6213640	6220360	so patterned is so relaxing everybody if you just want to chill play it all right uh loki
6220360	6227560	your gaming week I didn't play much of anything because it was a few things one I was the holidays
6227560	6232120	there's the holidays I thought I would get more time to play games during the hall please it's
6232120	6238680	more of like being a slave to the children so I didn't I did uh well we'll talk about what they
6238680	6244280	played then because it was more I played pokemon go a little bit this week that's it uh but I got
6244280	6250040	my youngest son wanted to get set up with playing fortnite on the switch so he can play with his
6250040	6257640	brother on pc and so I set him up with that so he's now playing fortnite um on the switch and
6257640	6264200	then of course he did some streaming yesterday on my channel he did some twitch streaming which
6264840	6271160	I told him it's pretty hard to be entertaining but like he did okay he he that way I got the
6271160	6275720	notice that your channel went live I wasn't at home yeah so so he streamed for about like
6275720	6281080	45 minutes on minecraft and so you archive your stuff yeah it should be okay I'll go back and
6281080	6285560	watch it I think it's at this I think it's archived um otherwise I have a copy he's somebody
6285560	6291240	in chat will say so in about five minutes why less than that watch yeah so um I did that and
6291240	6299160	then um what else yeah so then um I didn't really get to play much because I I was working on my
6299160	6303800	my game still which I didn't get a whole ton done with that it's more of just in the playing stage
6303800	6310600	of trying to figure out how to um randomly generate rooms but I needed to figure out
6310600	6315400	formatting how I want to actually set that up so that I don't just start coding and have to redo
6315400	6320280	a bunch of stuff so like yesterday which is usually I have like two hours of programming
6320280	6326120	time I just kind of is mainly staring at a text document and trying to like brainstorm ideas for
6326120	6331560	that um I know what I want to do I just haven't implemented it yet uh but my son he's finally
6331560	6336200	graduated from his yellow belt to orange belt in coding so he's doing slightly more advanced
6336760	6342920	um javascript stuff now which is kind of cool and yeah there's tiger claw with the link
6343880	6350760	thank you yes so so yeah there's that and um that's yeah like he wanted me he's like so well
6350760	6355640	well we need to have like an intro form for me like like a youtube like a professional youtube
6355640	6360680	intro I'm like I don't even have a professional youtube intro like I I don't want to like I
6360680	6368840	I can't whip that together just like in a couple minutes like geez so yeah that that's he has very
6369160	6375800	high expectations but um yeah that's pretty much my game week okay awesome um my gaming week uh a
6375800	6379400	variety of stuff I already mentioned I played way too much ingress yesterday uh I've been playing
6379400	6385160	all the other gps games too I've been playing them all uh orna has been surprisingly like taking
6385160	6390680	taken off amongst the olr yes I saw that like what no no offense I love you guys I took a chill for
6390680	6394840	a little bit of all the games I've recommended over the years I haven't downloaded it yet one
6394840	6400600	that everybody I guess I will now since you know I don't want to I don't want to have any fomo with
6400600	6406280	it so it's it's interesting I like it now I'm starting to read more about the intricacies of
6406280	6411000	it and how like maybe being in a party and being power leveled was not a good idea because you kind
6411000	6414760	of miss out on equipment but I'm doing okay for myself I'm still having fun that's the important
6414760	6418920	part so um yeah like every time I go to a new place now I bring up orna and I'm like has the
6418920	6424120	neighborhood been captured what level's the boss can I get it so uh yeah it's like really funny so
6424120	6430840	um yeah it's kind of fun um let's see other games so uh on playstation I just randomly was like
6430840	6435560	I'm gonna play pac-man championship edition again this or pac-man championship edition 2
6435560	6441400	because I actually like the sequel um and I once had like a top 100 score on that game it's since
6441400	6447000	fallen to like top 1000 but I uh I unlocked some trophies I didn't have already because I was like
6447000	6451400	oh I'm better at this game because I played it a lot on the switch so I can actually get a good
6451400	6455640	score in expert mode now so I unlocked like a gold trophy for getting an a an expert I still
6455640	6461240	can't get an s an expert some of it is just luck with how the ghosts fall on the rails um but uh
6461240	6469400	yeah I'll keep trying on that uh I I fell victim to the playstation sale uh so uh metal mayhem if
6469400	6474040	you're out there listening you want to know what games we get on sale I I bought the kingdom hearts
6474040	6480040	one and two remix hd because it was down to 25 bucks I had the playstation or excuse me the
6480040	6485800	kingdom hearts one remix on ps3 but I never had it on ps4 and I never did buy the second one
6485800	6489720	because I said oh it's a matter of time before they put it on uh playstation 4 so I bought that
6489720	6494920	um combo package it was down to 25 bucks I was like well that's a pretty darn good deal so
6494920	6498760	I played a little bit of kingdom hearts one I got through I'm I'm in the middle of wonderland right
6498760	6505960	now just finished the trial part of it and doing the second half so um yeah so um been playing that
6505960	6510360	and that's pretty much I think that's enough for my gaming week so uh let's move on we do have some
6510360	6514200	new stories to get into we're only going to do about half the stories we do on a normal show so
6514200	6518680	don't worry uh some I thought tonight was just going to be a short show but now it's about the
6518680	6522440	average probably going to be that average but we're not going to have as many stories as we
6522440	6525720	usually do uh we're going to go to about the classic game of the week and then the classic
6525720	6529480	game of the week is actually going to be like our pretty much last segment tonight if there's no
6529480	6534760	discord calls tonight so um let's get to it and we're going to get to some stories because
6534760	6540360	obviously with christmas hanukkah all the winter stuff being this week game game companies just
6540360	6545000	really aren't working new a lot of straight up some journalist sites are like we're taking the
6545000	6550520	week off like vg 24 7 hasn't published just a new story in a few days so you know everybody's taking
6550520	6554280	time off for the holidays and it's deserved but there's a few things there's a few little things
6554280	6558920	that we can bring up so loki we'll start with you yeah so there's a story about this guy rook
6558920	6565080	brooster who is a programmer he developed the program paint.net which is like a microsoft paint
6565080	6575080	type thing and um he had developed a game um at the age of 12 called the golden flute for
6575080	6581960	the flute of immortality and it was a dos uh role-playing game inspired by a text adventure
6581960	6588360	from uh they said 1984 instruction book on how to write adventure games so that's kind of cool um
6589000	6596840	so he says he wrote the golden flute for on a tandy 1000 tl2 um tl2 which was an ibm clone
6596840	6603160	computer um but the thing is though he's healing made one installable copy on a three and a half
6603160	6611080	um 720k disc that he ended up packaging up and he sent to his cousin and that was it and then
6611080	6617160	apparently he thought that that caught that copy was lost and there was no playable copy available
6617160	6623720	well fast forward to today when um apparently there was somebody that got a hold of a version
6623720	6630520	of the game uh the streamer by the name macaw who he streams these old dos games and so he
6630520	6639640	played apparently the golden flute for on december 23rd and so uh he of course the developer reached
6639640	6646760	out to to the guys see you know how he got a copy apparently it was apparently part of this uh
6647880	6654280	cream of the crop cult shareware compilation that was put together in 1994 and then apparently
6654280	6662520	they said a copy of it also was on phyto net so not sure how that ended up on part of that
6662520	6668840	shareware compilation but that's how they found it and so you know i don't know if he's able to
6668840	6674680	get the original copy of the disc but yeah uh dart to see it says i thought this was amusing
6675080	6678840	because i've seen the streamer before and this is totally the sort of thing he plays old pc games
6678840	6683080	from all over the world oh yeah i can imagine you know and they used to sell those collections were
6683080	6687080	a dime a dozen back in the oh god yes yeah you could just and so this person probably just had
6687080	6691240	like a truckload of floppies yeah they used to have like a walmart like a thousand game collections
6691240	6695560	and stuff like that back before it was just all clone games it was like just like scraping the
6695560	6699560	internet of like all these freeware games and stuff or all these shareware games man i remember
6699560	6704840	used to go into like my local video rental store and they had a a wall of shareware stuff and just
6704840	6709560	go through like each one's like a buck you know and you get of course with shareware stuff it was
6709560	6715320	like you know oh cool i get the share a copy of wolfenstein 3d it's still a full game it's just
6715320	6720040	you know it's a quarter of the uh one fourth of a full game and then the closest thing they have to
6720040	6724840	now would be like the the telltale model or like the first yeah so it is free or like life is
6724840	6729160	strange i think they give the yeah something like that i guess but like it still felt like a full
6729160	6733880	experience even with like the shareware stuff um and a lot of that you know they were encouraging
6733880	6739560	you that they wanted you to share it and you know if you wanted to buy the full registered copy then
6739560	6745560	you could do that um but i got my hands on like a lot of like software and stuff that way and go to
6745560	6751240	these like computer show and sales and stuff they have you know pirated stuff but you know you you
6751320	6756360	could also get like a lot of these shareware discs and collections that's cool yeah yeah i remember
6756360	6761320	a lot of that i would just log on to all the bbs's and download all that too yes all right anyway
6761320	6765560	uh that's really cool though for that author that uh suddenly this game you wrote all these years
6765560	6769880	ago is uh suddenly being played on stream and uh earlier on the bobby blackwolf show on little
6769880	6774200	tossover call we found out that bobby blackwolf once wrote a bbs door game and now we've made it
6774200	6779880	our mission to find it because we want to play it so come to find out there have been several
6779880	6785720	wrestling uh bbs store games he's already on the hunt so we'll see we'll see what we come up with
6785720	6791880	all right anyway uh let's go on move on talk about splatoon 2 i now here i thought splatoon
6791880	6795400	2 was kind of done with because they they were done with us i thought they were done with updates
6795400	6799240	and everything i thought they were totally done because the splatfest were done and so it was
6799240	6805640	kind of like the end of the cycle maybe we'd be lucky and hear about a um splatoon 3 but uh
6805640	6809800	apparently no more updates are coming on the japanese splatoon twitter account they mentioned
6809800	6815240	that there is a new balance tweak and uh bug fixes happening actually they didn't say what it is but
6815240	6820200	people are just assuming it's those things but there is a patch coming uh on january 5th through
6820200	6823400	6 somewhere in that time frame just depending on where you are in the world and there will be
6823400	6829400	another update in april so splatoon 2 and it's the lights have not dimmed over there yet i'm sure
6829400	6833720	there are people still playing that game it is a lot of fun the concept of paint as a shooter is
6834280	6838280	an awful lot of fun i do hope they end up putting out another game in that uh series
6838280	6843800	um but it's nice to see that the second one is still being supported nintendo has been very good
6843800	6848760	about supporting their games way after the release uh because you know mario maker got that huge
6848760	6853320	update with the zelda stuff not that long yeah i mean i i'm curious to see what more they're
6853320	6858040	going to release it i'm so surprised with mario maker too that they didn't do the amiibo support
6858040	6863960	like i feel it's just like very like strange yeah we never even you know what we got on the
6863960	6867960	tangent we never even got to address the whole like physical dlc when you were talking about
6867960	6873880	that stuff we never got to talk about amiibos games the toys to life stuff or toys or what
6873880	6880680	they call the ed toys life yeah that was a trend well yeah but yeah i actually like the figures
6880680	6885000	but it's kind of gone away though aside from amiibos it's like amiibos are still there but
6885000	6890040	not nearly like what they were i still see that like um star link stuff being sold at like
6890040	6895240	i thought like a collector's edition game something i'm not buying that i hear it's pretty
6895240	6901160	good i don't know all right anyway uh moving on dark sakura well i like to to focus on the human
6901160	6906840	element when i can um there is a 12 year old boy named rome i'm gonna steal one of these candies
6906840	6915400	okay well we still got a thank you see who's taking home yeah um but uh a boy in florida
6915400	6919880	decided to make a video game it's called please listen it's a video game for blind
6919880	6925880	and visually impaired children and um although i kind of laugh at his quote he says i learned
6925880	6929880	that it's actually harder to make a game than you think it took me about one to two weeks
6930120	6939880	blank blank wow um he said i was closing my eyes going through the levels seeing if they work or
6939880	6948040	not so basically um he also had severe hearing loss as a as a child still wears hearing aids
6948040	6955080	and he didn't learn how to speak until he was three so um he actually verbalized in in the
6955080	6961400	game used his voice as the guiding element in the game and apparently it was a really big uh
6962040	6966680	just step out of his comfort zone for him to do this for people and it was really good um but
6966680	6972280	yeah the game is called please listen if you can find it please share it with everybody and again
6972280	6977160	the things i the things i did when i was 12 and look at what this kid is doing it's amazing i
6977160	6982520	played i beat the guardian legend when i was 12 was that was that around the year of the year
6982520	6987800	final fantasy 2 in america which we all know was actually four was that that year i think it was
6988680	6994600	do you think i was 11 or 12 when i beat the guardian legend yeah because i'm i'm old er
6995320	7003080	it's all good all right let's move on uh loki all right so we we've talked about how there
7003080	7009640	were some issues with fallout 76 and being able to spawn objects into the world from link fallout 4
7009640	7016520	so uh kind of along the lines of that the same um set of uh kind of hackers that were behind that
7016520	7026680	sort of exploit now um had also found a way to basically loot other players in game so you could
7026680	7031400	actually at a distance loot somebody and steal all their inventory including their pip boy because
7031400	7037400	technically that's an object and so that was a problem that was going on for a while and then
7037400	7042840	of course now bethesda's allegedly patched that out but you know the fact that you had people
7042840	7048600	afraid to play on multiplayer through fallout 76 because you could just have your inventory taken
7048600	7055880	by somebody that you don't even see uh at any given notice um was kind of surprising so of
7055880	7061240	course they said you know we want to apologize for those who were impacted by this exploit uh we want
7061240	7065400	to make this right and we are currently looking in the ways that we may be able to compensate you
7065400	7067400	meaning that you're not getting your inventory back
7069880	7073480	i don't want to sound like one of those gamers and and i might add
7073480	7080360	so this is going to be great to to add to the uh fuel to the fire the items that they also
7080360	7087160	were able to take included items that you purchased from the atomic shop premium currency
7087160	7093400	items that might not even be tradable okay sorry all right no no you're fine i'll just say i don't
7093400	7096760	want to sound like one of those gamers but i'm a little bit surprised that um
7098600	7103640	that fallout 76 is like still going yeah i know that sounds really bad because it hasn't been out
7103640	7109160	that long but just well they still have their dog major update coming out for with the mps and
7109160	7114520	everything and i'm just waiting for that to crash and burn because oh boy every patch that they seem
7114520	7121320	to put out there it breaks more stuff all right well let's talk a little bit about uh something
7121320	7124360	that i think would have been really cool and some people would really like to see but it's
7124360	7129320	not happening uh unless maybe you make a ruckus now i don't know but uh apparently at one point
7129320	7136200	there was a xeno saga uh hd remaster that was being a planned uh so katsuhiro harada uh who
7136200	7141560	is general manager at bandai namco has uh talked about on twitter uh answering a question saying
7141560	7147320	this actually progressed to the remaster's plan but failed in a profitable market analysis
7147320	7154440	sorry guys this plan will be difficult to resurface so um but i mean at least he's reading
7154440	7160040	twitter so be nice don't be mean but maybe xenosaga fans if you really want that hd remaster
7160040	7163160	you got to speak up because they just don't think the sales are there they think they might put all
7163160	7166680	this energy into it and then they're not going to see the sales you know these things are cheap
7166680	7171560	they're not free so um you know maybe there's a compromise to be made here maybe they can't
7171560	7175320	upscale the whole thing in hd but maybe they could do some type of re-release of the classic games
7175320	7181000	that you know are just you know uh have some a little bit of work done on them maybe not a lot
7181000	7186600	of work so i don't know but so it'll be nice to see um what do you hope we see you know i know
7186600	7192200	earlier in the show we kind of talked about some um hd remaster wishes i feel weird calling hd
7192200	7197000	remasters because some of these games we're talking about are hd games but some um some
7197000	7201480	upgrades some new polish on old games you'd like to see in the next generation of gaming for
7201480	7207560	playstation 5 and x x series x uh wave what would you like to see so i mentioned a little bit about
7207560	7214520	um i talked about the uh mass effect trilogy i'd like to see for sure uh and um
7216600	7220360	the hell did i just say oh fantasy 13 and that whole trilogy i'd really love to see as well
7220920	7227000	come back um as far as a remaster or remake i would like to see saints row one and two
7227000	7233320	uh being remastered uh would be kind of nice especially one because uh one a lot of people
7233320	7240760	didn't get to play that because it was only on xbox 360 um i would like i'd still like to see like a
7242040	7248280	like an enhanced version of oblivion 2 would be kind of cool i thought that they were going to do
7248280	7256440	that um but apparently not um some comments in chat um swang tong says uh metal gear solid one
7256440	7260920	uh dj rama s to just rival schools yes quest buster says it would have been nice to have a
7260920	7265080	xena saga remaster but i can understand that they might not go for it it's pretty neat series that
7265080	7269880	had to recover after xena saga 2 yeah uh bobby says whatever we all know you just open the
7269880	7275400	project in unity go to compile set the new target to xbox one or ps4 and ship it i mean and just
7275400	7279160	be sure to turn up the graphics on level three while you're there with that big dial that says
7279160	7285480	graphics on it i mean yeah absolutely yes but you put it in that new um i forgot their new high-end
7285480	7291480	shaders called preheat the oven to 350 put it in for 30 minutes and you're good all right anyway
7291480	7298680	let's move on dar soccer what do you have next for us well speaking of more of uh i would say
7298680	7303560	another benefit for video games and i'm not going into like the educational things although this is
7303560	7312520	a kind of education um this is a game that teaches mindfulness and mindfulness has i think been a big
7312520	7318840	trend in the last decade or so but people don't really understand enough about it it's really
7318840	7324840	centering yourself bringing your attention to your breath um cutting you know it's it's like a guided
7324840	7332600	meditation of sorts um and people who practice mindfulness have generally been uh they they learn
7332600	7338200	better they are calmer they have less stress in their lives you know which and also affects of
7338200	7343400	course the body because body and mind are connected um so it's a a research team at the
7343400	7348760	center for healthy minds at the university of wisconsin madison and at uc irvine university
7348760	7355240	of california irvine have developed this game and it's called tenacity and it was designed for middle
7355240	7361480	schoolers and all they have to do it's it's a tablet game um the one i'm seeing i think they're
7361480	7368280	doing it on ios um but what they do is that they go through breathing exercises with relaxing
7368280	7374840	backgrounds you know like greek ruins or space or something and so they tap their breath on the
7374840	7383160	screen and every fifth breath they double tap and so it's meant to have them pay attention to their
7383160	7388840	breath and to how they feel to progress through the levels and instead of teaching a particular
7388840	7396120	concept as it's teaching mindfulness they've actually shown that um these uh that the game
7396120	7403800	is improving their ability to learn their ability to pay attention um and with that mindfulness
7403800	7412840	they're able to to train their brain to um to uh connect more with the world around them and one
7412840	7417800	thing about this that they learned in their research is that and i'm going to go a little
7417800	7425240	bit into the the physiological on this one but it improves the connection between their left
7425240	7430440	dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the left inferior parietal cortex of the brain which
7430440	7437720	are the areas that control your attention so um by changing the those aspects of the brain
7438440	7446040	they are able to focus more on the attention at hand um they had a another group as sort of like
7446040	7451720	their control that was playing fruit ninja they had none of those none of those developments
7451720	7461640	so training their attention in such a relaxing way has been well first of all it's been great
7461640	7471080	for the kids it also shows that if we don't take that time to pay attention to our breath to the
7471080	7477960	world with even to the people around us then we're damaging ourselves in the long run um am
7477960	7482360	i oversimplifying by saying this game sounds a lot like it's like the watch app that encourages you
7482360	7486520	to breathe you know it's very similar it sounds like a gamified version of that in a way yeah
7486520	7490840	you know it's very similar yeah like even for like adults they say you know you should take
7490840	7495160	a minute to really pay attention to your breathing you know because that can you know help you
7495320	7501160	stress relax you know anxiety you know flare-ups and things just stopping to breathe is so
7501160	7506200	important well and i will tell you something um at work we had a mindfulness challenge which i
7506200	7511880	want a blanket yay um but you had to use the breathe app 10 times a day for at least 25 days
7511880	7516680	in the month right and i that was to get the gold level which i got because i'm an overachiever when
7516680	7523560	it comes to breathing um and i have to say that it was having those moments to myself
7524200	7531160	and tuning out things around me really made me a lot more present in my life and i think i was
7531160	7537640	under a bit less stress since it's been i did it in october and i got out of the habit of doing it
7537640	7543320	and i've been getting myself back into the habit of it and i find this is gonna sound like maybe
7543320	7547560	a little bit of craziness because i've had some attention span problems before because i'll get
7547560	7552840	overwhelmed by certain things um but i have actually found my ability to tolerate crowds
7552840	7558760	has been a little bit better while i maintain mindfulness um and this is gonna sound like a
7558760	7563960	completely dumb thing but i don't want to look at my phone as much does that make sense oh
7563960	7570200	absolutely when i'm out with people i think now unless i have to check on something specifically
7570200	7575800	or get like a message from dan or something i don't have my phone out um i notice as i've been
7575800	7579640	getting older and maybe it's because i don't do those activities like some of those things have
7579640	7583560	been getting worse for me like claustrophobia issues do you remember at the very first gamer
7583560	7589320	x when i had that full-on panic attack yeah that has never happened to me ever but and what
7589320	7595160	happened guys is that i wasn't there that one but i knew about it okay yeah what happened is it was
7595160	7599080	nothing to do with the con itself it was fine but what happened was that it was just very very
7599080	7603160	crowded and we were in that kabuki hotel which is kind of got it's got like a low ceiling because
7603160	7607640	you know san francisco architecture big city architecture things you know old school like all
7607640	7611880	these panels kind of all let out at the same time and it was really like packed in like there's just
7611880	7618280	people everywhere and just all my brain for whatever reason just decided to go hey what are
7618280	7623480	you gonna do if a fire happens right now and i just started freaking out and they thank gosh
7623480	7628920	luckily staff knew what they pulled me back into the panel room that i had just left and i had a
7628920	7632760	moment to be able to kind of like okay i'm away from people i'm away from people and like stop for
7632760	7637320	a minute but it was like i'd never experienced anything like that in my life that i i will tell
7637320	7642920	you this right now welcome to how autism feels except it's more of the sense of overwhelming
7642920	7649240	it's not like panic like that but it's very similar um for me i get tunnel vision um i have
7649240	7654040	found that my ability to deal with the things that overwhelm me like people talking at the same time
7654040	7659160	because then i'll stop hearing words and i'll hear like the trombone parents from the peanuts
7659160	7666360	cartoons you know but i would actually challenge everybody um to spend a little bit more time
7667080	7672200	being mindful doing your breathe app just take you know a few minutes and listen to yourself
7672200	7678920	breathe count your breaths but then i'd like for you to go after that and do a task that you do
7678920	7684760	every day like try playing a puzzle game play something complicated um incorporate your
7684760	7690760	mindfulness into a daily walk but see how much better you do at the things you love
7690760	7694680	and i'm glad that they're doing this for these kids i wish that this was a widespread program
7695320	7699480	because i think that if they'd had something like this when i was in school that wasn't fucking nap
7699480	7706520	time i think i might have i mean i was bored i'll just admit it i was bored in school but i think i
7706520	7710440	might have found the things i was doing more interesting if i could pay attention to them
7710440	7715240	some interesting comments in chat marissa our friend of the show here uh says tenacity
7715240	7720520	apparently isn't available to the public yet but i dig my muse headband for mindfulness and my add
7720520	7725880	adult brain so um you know even though this game isn't widely available uh certainly other folks
7725880	7729880	kind of have their own techniques or um you know we mentioned this is kind of based on a watch
7729880	7734280	thing so if you're a smart watch i mean i know apple watch is what i have and there's one built
7734280	7738440	into it i'm sure android has to have something similar like they've all got to have some type
7738440	7743160	breathing uh but i know i know smart watches are a luxury so if you don't have that you know i'm
7743160	7748520	sure there's computer programs that will kind of help you with you know taking a moment to stop and
7748520	7753880	breathe and all that good stuff marissa does point out our i love i love marisela so glad you're in
7753880	7759480	there mindfulness is a big aspect of many newer therapies or spin-offs of cognitive behavioral
7759480	7764440	therapy which again for me as an autistic person i've had to go through a bit of cognitive
7764440	7769720	behavioral therapy myself um after i lost both of my grandmother's back to back i went into
7769720	7775720	hardcore therapy because i was having not just my um my meltdowns for autism i was having panic
7775720	7780600	attacks on top of it they do feel completely different um and yeah marissa also points out
7780600	7788200	10 happier i've used that too and um it's i don't prefer a guided meditation i'll be perfectly honest
7788200	7793320	i would rather do something that's from my own mind but i will tell you this bringing it back
7793320	7798680	to video games is why i say try this i was getting really frustrated i don't even remember
7798680	7802840	what game i was playing at one time but i was getting super frustrated with not being able to
7802840	7808760	do like one little task in it and i had gone off and did like a bit of mindfulness just because i
7808760	7814120	was so pissed off i just needed to calm down and went back and did it right after that no problem
7814120	7820040	no stress it's amazing what a little bit of mindfulness will do uh sj100 matt says my
7820040	7824120	girlfriend teaches mindfulness with the fifth graders uh it helps a lot of her students calm
7824120	7830120	down in stressful situations so uh and sj100 matt continues that i sleep with a white noise machine
7830120	7833800	and focus on my breathing if i have a hard time sleeping well you're probably doing it the better
7833800	7841480	way because i'll just take a melatonin so yeah i actually sleep with uh an air filter on um because
7841800	7850680	and earplugs because dan snores but um i i i have done other levels of biofeedback marissa brings
7850680	7857480	up doing biofeedback um but i mean it's just amazing i mean well even so our technology just
7857480	7864440	is again in the past 10 years that we've had these therapies incorporating with technology and gaming
7864440	7868920	to make these breakthroughs for people i think it's pretty amazing what a world we live in
7868920	7873640	all right well let's go ahead and move on we have just a couple more stories for you guys before we
7873640	7877320	get to the classic game of the week i think we're going to do one quick email tonight as well and
7877320	7882120	then i'll try to squeeze in a call or two although alan wants to start dinner about 8 45 so we're
7882120	7886200	running running out of time um but that's we'll get through these last few stories here real quick
7886200	7892760	so loki so really quick mega man x dive um which was a co-op multiplayer game that was coming to
7893400	7901960	mobile devices has been delayed now to 2020 and it they basically said it was supposed to be slated
7901960	7909240	for late 2019 but the game is now uh slated for the first quarter of 2020 due to the process
7909880	7911080	of optimization
7913400	7917240	well i'm all for games getting delayed but i still don't know how i feel about this on mobile but
7917240	7922200	we'll see it looks kind of me was reserved judgment until we can play it so get it as
7922200	7927400	good as it can be right sure sure all right um hey speaking of getting to try something
7927400	7931560	before it's out maybe uh there's apparently a leak out there showing that a final fantasy 7
7931560	7936280	remake demo is coming uh this is there was a tracking website that kind of checks like
7936280	7942680	what's going on on the stores uh like playstation store and stuff uh and this website game stat
7942680	7947320	which is the same place that found the resident evil 3 remake stuff um it actually found that
7947400	7952680	there is a final fantasy 7 demo that was lurking there on the playstation store which would be
7952680	7956840	interesting because i think a lot of us discovered final fantasy 7 the first time through those demo
7956840	7961800	disks and things of that nature so it would be an interesting throwback yeah see some of that
7961800	7967320	like pop up in a demo uh that would be available on the store that would be pretty cool so um
7967320	7971240	we'll see uh if it's going to be confirmed i imagine it'll be in the next couple weeks
7971240	7976600	because the game is out in march believe it or not here we go it's like it's like the little
7976600	7980680	joke bumper at the beginning said march 2020 is coming all these big the animal crossing
7980680	7986040	final fantasy doom all these big 2020 is going to hit the ground running you guys so here we go
7987160	7992680	all right let's move on uh to one more story before our classic game of the week dar sakura
7993640	7997400	well um and this has been making the rounds i'm sure people know about it by now
7997400	8002200	but there was a prototype of a canceled akira game um that was supposed to be out on the
8002200	8008040	sega megadrive known as the genesis in the us um and it was recently discovered um
8008600	8016040	it was it's been dumped online um the thing you can go download it um but it was uh made by a
8016040	8023000	company called black pearl software that was going to be working on one for the uh game boy the snes
8023000	8029000	uh sega game gear sega genesis and sega cd the games were not finished there were screenshots
8029000	8038360	back in the day um but the publisher thq uh basically said nah they didn't do it um but
8038360	8043880	it's been uploaded now to uh the hidden palace it is incomplete it cannot be played start to finish
8043880	8049000	but you can play individual stages it does have a stage select it looks actually pretty good it was
8049000	8054200	supposed to have different genre like a motorcycle racing level like road rash um and then a first
8054200	8059960	person while tetsu was escaping it's kind of like doom um there was going to be a shooter
8059960	8066120	platformer stage kind of like flashback in the sewers a hoverbike stage um an isometric shooter
8066120	8071160	stage where uh tetsuo has to fight off the soldiers with his psychic power and a final
8071160	8078920	stage that isn't complete that has uh kaneda fighting tetsuo so um it it looks really cool
8078920	8086360	i've i've seen some of it in motion i don't know why but i mean we are supposed to be getting
8086360	8093720	a live action akira movie and uh an anime series which hopefully follows the manga closely um so
8094440	8101480	shrug emoji that's a good way to sum up considering that was our official like last
8101480	8105720	story of the year and last story of the decade i think this is a great way to just sum it all up
8105720	8112760	shrug emoji that's how i feel right well on that note let's go back to a simpler time when there
8112760	8117400	there were there were no emojis believe it or not well maybe i don't know or there was only
8117400	8123640	wing dings there was no emojis only wing dings it's the classic game of the week dark soccer is
8123640	8127880	going to walk into the gaming vault email first oh you want to do the email first yeah why not
8127880	8131320	yeah sure i'll do the classic game we're already here yeah we're already here we'll do uh email
8131320	8135160	during listen round table so classic of the week let's do it uh dark soccer is going to jump into
8135160	8140440	the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks hey you should play this game moldy oldie this is
8140440	8147960	this is a very interesting that has lived longer than you realize i picked minesweeper and i'll
8147960	8151960	tell you why i picked minesweeper because a co-worker and i we have a video of somebody
8151960	8156280	playing minesweeper and it's like sped up but it's like the world's biggest minesweeper board
8157000	8161480	and the music on this one is a piano version of flight of the bumblebee i i know i stripped it
8161560	8165960	but i'm just saying i thought it was funny yeah it is um but anyway it's a single-player puzzle
8165960	8171480	computer game you are meant to clear out a rectangular board that has hidden minds without
8171480	8177480	activating them but you have to mark which one's which the game actually originates in the 1960s
8178440	8184680	which was built for old mainframes pretty cool huh i would have thought it came from like penny
8184680	8188920	press magazine type of stuff i would have thought maybe this was like a pen and paper game at one
8188920	8194920	point interesting this was a this was a mainframe game and of course since then it's been on every
8194920	8199560	version of windows forever yeah there is one in windows 10 that has like achievements and stuff
8200440	8204840	i haven't played it um but the reason we got on the subject is because um at my job we work on
8204840	8211320	max and um someone's like how are you playing minesweeper on your eyes like i got it in the
8211320	8217720	app store there's minesweeper in the app yeah it's not just owned by microsoft blah blah blah
8218440	8224520	you know um but at any rate it was one of the earliest mainframe games in the 1960s and 70s
8224520	8230040	the earliest ancestor of modern minesweeper was a game called cube not to be confused with a really
8230040	8236280	weird movie series um and it's basically really became one of the most popular puzzle games out
8236280	8242200	there there's other versions called mind out by quicksilver in 1983 yomp by version interactive
8242200	8247720	in 1983 and then cube cube was succeeded by relentless logic or r logic by conway
8248360	8254120	conway hung and smith and it was for ms das as early as 1985 where you took the role of a private
8254120	8261480	and u.s marine core uh core to deliver uh messages and you had to basically sweep for mines you had
8261480	8264440	different ways to navigate through it and you had to go in a particular direction
8265480	8270280	it wasn't necessary to clean out the non-mine squares so it was a little bit different it
8270280	8278440	kind of played on the the uh minesweeper type there also were other mechanics of minesweeper
8278440	8283080	that were included in other games for example there was vine sweeper that was incorporated
8283080	8289880	into runescape who remembers fucking runescape um and it was just a little you know mini game that
8289880	8295000	was included in there and then mole control that came out on pc it was developed by remode
8295000	8299640	um you had a minesweeper mechanic that was integrated into the puzzle game
8300360	8305800	in a village called molar creek that had moles everywhere so basically you were mole sweeping
8305800	8312040	i guess so as far as other versions um it's been bundled on operating systems for ages
8312040	8320040	um there was minesweeper for os2 um there was minesweeper for windows k mines uh in kde which is
8320040	8329640	uh a unix os um gnome mines and gnome uh mine hunt in palm os so there who remembers palm os
8330440	8337320	um the hp 48g graphing calculator had one called mine hunt um where you had to navigate from one
8337320	8342280	area of the play field to the other by navigating the mines voltorb flip mini game is in the non
8342280	8348600	japanese releases of pokemon heart gold and soul silver as a variation of mines minesweeper and
8348600	8355000	p cross you have a logic puzzle version of minesweeper that you play on paper that has
8355000	8359160	some squares already revealed but you can't reveal any more squares you have to mark the ones you
8359160	8362440	think is it's an interesting so that's what i'm thinking of that's where i figured it would have
8362440	8370280	started um but these um were uh i'm trying to see uh the puzzles appeared under the name
8370920	8376600	uh tentai zoo which also means star map in southwest southwest airlines magazine spirit
8376600	8386040	2008 2009 um uh in minecraft uh for the 2015 april fool's update the love and hugs update
8386040	8390920	added minesweeper which is a near exact copy of minesweeper except instead of avoiding the mines
8390920	8399640	you have to avoid creepers um it uh now as far as its computational complexity in 2000 richard k
8399640	8407240	published a proof proof meaning like a theoretical mathematical problem i guess
8407240	8411800	it's hard to describe that it is an mp complete to determine whether or not a given grid of
8412520	8417240	uncovered correctly flagged and unknown squares the labels the foremost also given have an
8417240	8422200	arrangement of mines which is possible within the rules of the game so basically he's mines mine uh
8422840	8429320	minesweeper as his proof also he proved that infinite minesweeper is Turing complete
8430440	8437800	so um but at any rate uh this video is about to end sadly so anyway the game is minesweeper
8437800	8441560	it's been around since the 60s so there's there's some people in chat saying i don't understand this
8441560	8446920	game i don't know how to play this game so the numbers are showing you how many mines are
8446920	8452520	touching that square exactly and so you have to use logic powers to deduce where is the mine by
8452520	8457720	looking at the surrounding numbers and sometimes it's just luck and sometimes it's just dumb luck
8457800	8464440	but that's the ones that are like if you get like a five usually what i do is i count the spaces
8465080	8473320	so if i say that i have one that's got a one all around it yeah or or maybe like a one like so
8473320	8478840	you've got a corner piece and you have a one above it and a one to the to the left of it then that i
8478840	8484120	that means then the the that one is attached to the one in between those so the one that is
8484120	8489800	directly the left diagonal that's an example yeah so and in that video which i guess i can
8489800	8493960	bring up again here real quick i'll restart it from the beginning when you see these big areas
8493960	8499400	get uh uh explored at once that's because it's zero so zero will automatically because if it's
8499400	8504120	zero it automatically clicks everything around it because zero is going to be safe so the empty
8504120	8509240	squares are zeros basically they just don't say zero uh and then he's putting in flags as he goes
8509240	8514360	to mark where the where it could be yeah uh and you can do a question mark where you think one
8514360	8518200	might be so you can go back and explore it later um and as that said the number tells you how many
8518200	8522680	lines yeah but was that said oh i wanted it to end when they hit a bomb spoiler alert he ends up
8522680	8527240	beating the puzzle he gets the whole way this is like a world record attempt yeah uh he wouldn't
8527240	8532920	have put it on youtube if he didn't um but the big prize you get for winning the windows 3.1 version
8532920	8538040	that little smiley icon way at the top wears shades that's it that's what you get for winning
8539800	8546520	shade emoji this ain't solitaire with the fancy you know card with the bouncing card and all that
8546520	8551720	stuff but at any rate this is i mean yeah it can really piss me off sometimes but it's another one
8551720	8557240	of those games that i play to focus on something else because it's i do this with actually i do
8557240	8563480	it with patterned and i do it with solitaire that it's i can devote one part of my brain to this so
8563480	8569640	that the rest of my mind can focus on what i'm hearing i do it when i when i was in class
8569640	8575720	that's why i do a doodle or play another game while i was in class so there you go we had to
8575720	8579640	mention minesweeper at one point or the other it's a good pick to end the decade on i mean even
8579640	8584280	though it's not from this decade it's still one of those like oh yeah hell lots of people play
8584280	8589160	minesweeper at some point so even if you didn't understand it it was in your windows 3.1 or
8589160	8595560	windows 95 computer so you probably booted it up at some point what's this i suck at this but uh
8595560	8604120	maybe one day i'll do a emacs tetris oh a minesweeper stream that'll be fun no you know
8604120	8610680	what i'm i'm sad about now is it the last os release emacs tetris is no longer available
8610680	8615880	did you ever know about that sorry i'm distracted so i'm actually watching alan use his brand new
8615880	8619800	instapot that he got for the holidays for the first time i know it played little songs when
8619800	8626120	you take the lid off and on yes my washer my dishwasher does that it plays shoe bear
8626120	8633960	when it's done i have one of the uh uh samsung dishwashers ask alan there's one microwave at
8633960	8639800	work that plays a little song when it finishes is it a samsung i don't know but it's there's
8639800	8645160	like five microwaves up there i will only use the one that plays the song check and see if it's a
8645160	8650600	samsung because apparently samsung appliances including their washing machine and dryers all
8650600	8655800	play this one shoe bear piece interesting when they're done huh okay all right anyway anyway
8655800	8659000	let's move on we're gonna get to the listener round table i'll see if we have anybody in
8659000	8663320	discord here but first i think we have an email that we want to do actually we do and it's our
8663320	8670840	last email of the last email of the year last email of the decade all right hello lr we know
8670840	8676120	who this is i've decided to take a few minutes breaks from spinning like a top trying to get
8676120	8680680	ready for magfest so here i am in text form it's yyr by the way if you haven't already guessed
8680680	8687400	first i wanted to extend a little offer to me to jamie to me i always love hearing about food on
8687400	8692360	the show and i love me some potato latkes but i was disappointed to hear that used a box mix
8692360	8696440	making them from scratch takes more time but it's super easy the final product tastes way better
8696440	8700520	all you have all you need is a blender and i have a peeler and some potatoes a big onion some flour
8701080	8704920	eggs oil and salt if you're interested i'll send you my mom's recipe i promise that you won't regret
8704920	8709960	it i do know how to make latkes from scratch i've made latkes from scratch it's much easier to bring
8709960	8715240	the box mix over here when you're making latkes in somebody else's kitchen yeah to be fair she's
8715240	8719560	making them in my kitchen during the show so i think that's why she cuts corners and it's okay
8719560	8727320	i will say they were still good to me your counter space hey alan did a great job this week to make
8727320	8731640	room for the new pot so there is that but i'm just saying i know not much space to prepare
8732760	8737640	um but i will take the recipe because i love recipes um i actually want to do latkes in a
8737640	8744520	waffle iron i think that'd be cool be fun lastly i wanted to extend an offer to all of the listeners
8744520	8750360	as initially promised i'll be at super magfest 2020 indie showcase come on by and i'll try the
8750360	8755400	latest versions of super multitasking and sharpshooter plus i'll be selling them in a
8755400	8760600	bundle along with falling plus all for just five dollars but if you mention olr it's yours
8760600	8765800	from easily two bucks i hope you'll enjoy playing the games saying hello and saving a few dollars too
8766600	8771000	thanks as always for putting on the show have a great week hopefully with less craziness than mine
8771000	8778200	now back to testing equipment and loading the car hugs erin yyr we love you yyr um and since i just

8937240	8944520	lounge radio who's this jim sally jim sally how are you my friend it's good to hear from you oh
8945160	8951720	brother it's great to hear i am so glad for we had minesweeper tonight as the old school cave of
8951720	8958280	week i owe my life to minesweeper dark sakura you have no idea i owe my life to my first off
8959000	8962280	first off i want to tell every single one of you motherfuckers out there there is no
8962280	8968920	random pieces in minesweeper until you get to the very very little piece at the end and sometimes
8968920	8973640	fuck you you'll get through a hundred goddamn fucking mines in the last two it's left to right
8973640	8978520	you got to pick left or right you know what i mean it's one day one day jim sally 20 fucking
8978520	8984440	years ago was playing minesweeper at a sausage factory just killing time on the night shift
8984440	8988600	hoping no one catches me and i'm getting right to the end of a fucking hundred bomb it's been
8988600	8992840	a while since i beat one right and i'm right at the fucking last two squares knock knock on the
8992840	8998440	door it's my fucking foreman ah shit pokes his head and what are you doing said i'm playing
8998440	9002920	minecraft he takes a look at the screen and just jumps back how did you get that many mines done
9002920	9007960	i said i don't know man i got one more to go and i clicked i got lucky i clicked and i saw
9007960	9013640	that number one right there oh i beat it hey smiley face look at that oh fuck a week later
9013640	9018440	a week later i come into work i find out the promoter needs a weekend uh smokehouse operator
9018440	9023640	it was 27 dollars an hour all the overtime i could have because he thought i apologize for
9023640	9029560	the laser beam noise that was on jim sally's side sorry buddy oh uh jim sally if that happens one
9029560	9037320	more time i think your connection is going bad okay he's listen so i find out a week later that
9037320	9042440	this guy gives me a promotion to part-time weekend smokehouse operator because he thinks i'm a
9042440	9049080	computer genius because i beat minesweeper therefore since these new smoke houses will
9049080	9055160	be run on computers we definitely should hire this kid you know what we can improve our talents in
9055160	9061880	the weirdest ways we really can like um it was because of this show um an old boss of mine found
9061880	9067400	out that i did all this like youtube production and stuff on the side and they were like why don't
9067400	9072440	you get into doing more like e-learning type of development and that moved me into that type of
9072440	9077000	role which is really where i'm still working to this day so it's just kind of funny how things
9077000	9080680	can kind of play into play into things like that i'm just giggling because you were working at a
9080680	9084760	sausage factory playing this is it wasn't just that you were playing minesweeper you were playing
9084760	9091400	it at the sausage factory hard jim sally worked hard for five six years at that sausage factory
9091400	9096440	that it paid for my first house got me my first wife i still have my first wife by the way don't
9096440	9103080	kid yourself people who would who would want to leave the gym what is jim sally speaking speaking
9103080	9109240	of enjoying what is jim sally dude if you come down to toronto pride man let's let's do to toronto
9109240	9114840	pride i haven't been to toronto pride in two or three years i miss it i should go back again
9115480	9119800	it's the most festivist time in the entire canadian history like it's better than christmas
9119800	9124760	i'll come down and say it's better than christmas i'm fairly confident it's going to happen the
9124760	9129640	only thing i started to look at like flights and for some reason that weekend is way more
9129640	9135560	expensive than any other weekend um and i don't know what you know about pride or what man they
9135560	9140920	know about pride man it's great you've never been man trust me it's the best yeah i it's the best
9140920	9144760	well i've been every other year i've been to like chicago pride i've been to sf pride they're all
9144760	9150280	the same weekend so yeah i've got i really want to try toronto out uh vg realness is asking is
9150280	9157480	jim sally from toronto no you let you live out in canada like you live in rural most people right
9157480	9162360	well he'll actually know like so i dude i grew up in kitchener brother so i'm i was right i was like
9162360	9166840	an hour down down the highway from toronto i got lots of family in toronto now i live eight hours
9166840	9171320	north of toronto i actually i actually know where kitchen i know where kitchener is because i had
9171320	9175400	another friend that was from there dude probably yeah there's your city water louise right there
9175400	9178680	right that's the big bill gates university canadian university it sits right inside the
9178680	9183560	town i used to live in i used to feed those kids harvey's hamburgers man all day long man i know
9183560	9187560	that you get the harvey's hamburgers with the ketchup chips or you can get the all dress chips
9187560	9192520	i always prefer salt and vinegar did you just say you live eight hours north of toronto now
9192520	9200120	i live eight hours north of toronto wow like it's it's like like when i talk about living in the
9200120	9204840	like the queen's bequeathment i'm not kidding man like last year we had two bears coming to
9204840	9210200	our house at the same time all year long oh my god like and it like we got to know them it gets
9210200	9214600	really like it gets really creepy out here man did you see did you see at the beginning of the
9214600	9219000	show by the way vg realness got us a canada care package did you see that i did i saw the whole
9219000	9222920	thing that i was freaking out man all of the goodies in there man i can't believe some of the
9222920	9227160	goodies that we have that you don't have man but they're we're chowing down americans have
9227160	9232520	there's a lot of goodies you know what you know what you know what i like that america has that
9232520	9235960	i can't get it and it's up or maybe i'm not supposed to talk about it because it's not good
9235960	9240200	for the show but i miss them damn delicious american cigarettes man jesus christ
9240200	9247720	oh cigarettes cigarettes are getting harder and harder to come by more and more people are
9247720	9252600	quitting and it's getting harder and harder to smoke but uh yeah good there you are man
9252600	9255720	but that's why it moves where i move man because no one gives a shit out here yeah
9257800	9262440	all right jesus well jim sally that we've got a lot of noise in the kitchen so it's getting

9398440	9401480	the decade you know whether you just found us maybe everybody was just part of the decade if
9401480	9405560	you just found us a year or so ago or so i just really appreciate you spending your sunday nights

9415080	9421800	appreciate you guys giving us the motivation to keep doing this actually i would like to say sure
9421800	9426120	you can follow up three no name three things that you've accomplished this decade that you're proud
9426120	9431720	of three things that i've accomplished this decade that i'm proud of uh while i have the
9431720	9435880	show on the mind i would definitely say the opportunities that have presented themselves
9435880	9442600	at dragon con with getting to um host panels about podcasting and be accepted as a um professional
9442600	9447720	i think is a huge thing so that would be one this is very adjacent but it's still super important
9447720	9453480	to me um i would say would be when i got to do the panel with um barry bostwick uh patricia quinn
9453480	9458040	and little now because obviously i grew up on the rocky or picture show and to get that opportunity
9458040	9466040	to let be in the same room with them let alone sit at the same table as these people was was
9466040	9474200	huge for me and i'm just so thankful for that opportunity um i would say maybe three would be
9474200	9478600	some of the things that i've done in my career that i don't talk about here on the show uh as
9478600	9483160	much but um i think i've had a lot of growth uh from where i was at the beginning of the decade
9483160	9487960	to where i am now uh i've had a lot of professional growth in 10 years and that's just looking to keep
9487960	9494680	on getting better so um it's very exciting stuff loki what are your three my three for this year
