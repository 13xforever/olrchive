16
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:31,140
like five sizes too big for me now because number one it's warm and number two I bought

00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,140
it at the fucking Skywalker Ranch well and being bigger is not always necessarily like

32
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,920
were talking about I felt I fell down earlier yeah she's sick you injured yourself it's just

33
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,720
a minor injury oh it's only a flesh wound it pretty much yeah it's only a flesh okay what

34
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,080
happened we all want to know oh my kids wanted me to take them to roller skating so they went

35
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,000
roller skating and I I used to roller blade like a ton like all the time and the last time we went

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,700
rollerblading which was not that long ago I my one of my straps on my blades broke so I had to

37
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:27,040
rent a pair today and so they had like a speed skating in session which I like doing that's fun

38
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,400
so I tried to go around the corner you know I usually crisscross the kind of go faster

39
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,800
over around the corners and because they're profiling the wheels is different than what

40
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:43,400
I'm used to it slipped inside I hit the ground on my knee rolled to my elbow and then got back

41
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:50,400
up so it's it scraped it a little bit but it's like I'm like ow but I'm gonna get back up and

42
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,400
just keep going I mean it's not like I broke my leg or something congrats you're old it's not

43
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,880
all this is what I used to do like all the time I've done this I've gotten this injury so many

44
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:07,600
times at least it was in a rink and not on like asphalt which is typically the case true I have

45
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:13,360
a sun-bleached spot on the sweater do you oh well oh well well you've had it a while episode 3 was

46
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,600
out so you know episode 9 is coming out soon I was at the movies yesterday we will get into gaming's

47
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,560
but it just wouldn't be an episode of orange entre do if there weren't tangents you know no it's

48
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,160
funny though when we were in the rink sorry how a tangent to the tangent November because we had

49
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,800
talked about like we should do something like like stupid for like one of these like big like

50
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,840
numbered episodes or something and I was like suggesting like hey we could rent out the roller

51
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,400
because that's dirt cheap huh and so I thought about that again well our live on roller skates

52
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:47,480
yeah why here's the thing let me let me loan you some sage advice for having done this for 800

53
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:54,560
episodes why do we have to do it for 800 episodes why can't we celebrate 823 like every you do

54
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,720
whatever we want every episode should be celebrated every every every olr is a blessing every week we

55
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:09,240
don't kill each other is a success story is it not it's a toll-free episode anyway going to wait

56
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,920
what was my oh yes I went to the movies I went to see knives out which you know I want to see that

57
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:19,480
because it's like clue it what I hear like clue dark here's a lot of my friends really loved it

58
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:24,240
I liked it I didn't love it but I liked it and I don't know if it was really clue I don't know if

59
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,160
you can be clue when you reference clue in the film however it did have Jamie Lee Curtis who's

60
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,720
a gamer we all know that right and she was great there just wasn't enough of her like I think there

61
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,080
was a lot of people in it where I was like we hardly got to see him but anyway that's all I

62
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,560
don't want spoil too much anyway so anyway um I also want to say I I am looking at chat because

63
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:48,200
again we tape live over at twitch TV slash vog network and I you guys are really donating biddies

64
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,920
tonight and I see you guys doing I don't usually call out all the bit donations because they go

65
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:57,080
across the bottom but I will at the end of the show when we're not recording for the podcast but

66
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:03,440
I see several of you are doing 800 biddies for 800 episodes and I know that's no small amount

67
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:09,360
of biddies so I really want to just acknowledge that and say thank you that is very very kind and

68
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:16,480
you know we wanted to at the top of the show here you know even if we've done 500 episodes

69
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:23,240
and 200 episodes and 700 episodes and we've done 10 years and 12 years and so forth I I I didn't

70
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,400
want to toot our own horn too much but I didn't want to take this opportunity at the top of the

71
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:33,160
show to just say thanks I mean you guys are truly what keeps this going gives us that energy to do

72
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:38,160
this show every week even when maybe we're feeling a little sick or we've injured ourselves earlier

73
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,680
in the day and maybe we don't necessarily always feel like coming in showing up to doing it it's

74
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,960
like by the time we're here and you guys are here and interacting with it and bringing that

75
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:55,100
enthusiasm that you guys do it really means a lot and obviously if we haven't broken it big by now

76
00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:00,520
800 episodes and 17 years in we're probably not going to but I think we all made peace with that

77
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:06,640
a long time ago and still even with our small audience we have a very loyal and great little

78
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:13,560
family here and that's okay I like small families I don't I mean like when I used to go to the

79
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,200
extended family for holidays that's what all the messes happen that's all the drama and political

80
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:24,600
start small family gatherings awesome so we like the small family that we have here and I still you

81
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:31,560
know this show has afforded us many opportunities still even with its you know smaller size than I

82
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,600
think I would have ever gotten otherwise we were just talking about on Bobby's show before we went

83
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,600
live tonight a cameo that we had in a video game like that would have never happened if it wasn't

84
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:48,600
for this show we got to go to e3 back when it was cool like in its most heyday years you know that

85
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,640
was something because of this show that you know we got to do and and there's been other industry

86
00:07:53,640 --> 00:08:02,080
events I've I have been an acknowledged professional at a very large convention every

87
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,320
year for the past couple years that is an amazing feat that I'm so thankful and humble for with this

88
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,800
show so thank you guys so much for showing up every week and giving us that motivation we need

89
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:17,840
to keep doing this show every single week thank you thank you thank you and yeah I let swung tongue

90
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:25,080
gave a donation and said happy 800 that's all I got that's okay you know we the the bits are

91
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:31,520
an extra thank you we'd never expect them but they are very very much appreciated and help us

92
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,520
to keep vog network as a business and do business II type of things that we do want to continue to

93
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:44,760
expand on yeah swung tongue said you were on TV that's true we thank you for reminding me yeah

94
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:50,640
there was a couple times and on in the newspaper which I still have that somewhere yeah I had it

95
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,840
it's really yellow though yeah it was it was early on in the life of the show when we were in the

96
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:00,400
newspaper because that was right when podcasting first broke and if you search for like Sacramento

97
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:06,720
in iTunes you got us like there wasn't you know now there's probably shows about Sacramento in

98
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,240
there and you know there's other that Sacramento has a number one gaming podcast now that comes up

99
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:19,160
in the results and all this other stuff that wasn't there back when we started so yeah like

100
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:24,840
we were what came up so the newspaper came out to do that and then the news station came out and did

101
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:30,720
one story at my place about podcasting but then what was really cool is that they remembered us

102
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,600
or something because when Guitar Hero came out the first one they would I wasn't there it was just

103
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:42,200
you and Loki so maybe hide on my bimani stuff oh yeah oh because the Guitar Hero guy the like PR

104
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:47,480
guy for a red or was it red octane at the time so you went as well to like he gave you guys a

105
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:53,320
personal demo of the game we have all the fun with it yeah no it's cool it was very very very

106
00:09:53,320 --> 00:10:00,040
cool appreciate that and we had that nice big TV in the living room at the house in is a few

107
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,880
houses ago for me yeah but you know that house oh no I do yeah I do nice and shiny in there

108
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,560
I'm a necessary 100 Matt and chat says it's so much fun yeah that's where that quote came from

109
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,920
it's still on YouTube there's an orange on radio YouTube channel and you can still see that old

110
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,960
story it's an old story at this point yeah well what my god how many years ago to Dave Walker

111
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:28,480
retire and he's the one doing the the news anchor thing introducing the story I don't know also

112
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:35,720
here's the other interesting thing about that story they never name our show they never cuz

113
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:41,600
they're assholes they know I don't know if it's because they can't endorse it or whatever but

114
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:48,520
they never name our show um to be fair they also say at one point in the news story governor

115
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:53,800
Schwarzenegger just started a podcast because again it's that old so they said governor

116
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,920
Schwarzenegger started a podcast but they never named that program either because remember they

117
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:06,520
had the kid on the skateboard yeah I was like podcast listener you young person do you know

118
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:14,240
what podcasts are why yes sir I do it's funny that it made us such a niche thing back then

119
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,800
and now it's like now podcasting is that stereotype thing where it's like you know

120
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,760
you've all heard those jokes and I why don't you have a podcast yet or I hate these jokes

121
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,960
but I hate them but we've all heard them the one you know what do you call three white dudes in

122
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:33,800
their 30s in the basement a podcast you know that that whole thing and I'm just like the podcast I

123
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,720
I don't like that joke because I really really want podcasting to be for everybody I heard that

124
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:42,880
one yeah I have it's it's it's stupid I've seen it on Twitter I've seen a lot of really dumb

125
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:48,480
podcast jokes on Twitter and I that's one thing that like really irks me is that podcasting is

126
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:55,080
like because I think those jokes reinforce that it's only for one particular audience when it

127
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:59,800
really isn't it's really for everybody like everybody should be able to get their voice

128
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,840
out there and be heard and it's not just podcasting because now we live in this era of YouTube as much

129
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:11,160
as I don't like YouTube as a business and twitch where you know you can get on and have your own

130
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:16,040
streams and stuff they're really it's really really easy to have your voice heard when you

131
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:20,040
know again back in 2006 when these news stations featured us it was a little bit more of a novelty

132
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:26,880
wasn't it anyway all right anyhow sorry I it was a little bit of a tangent but we wanted to say

133
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,280
something here at the top of the show for episode number 800 so again thank you all for being with

134
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:35,080
us let's get into some video game news because I know that's what we're really about here at

135
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:42,440
the show what I was watching the video of my DDR pads are in the background oh yeah oh yeah that

136
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:47,200
was pretty funny yeah for sure oh my gosh Matt you look so young all right anyway let's get into

137
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:54,000
our kickoff topic tonight which has to do with pokemons so Loki you want to start us off here

138
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,080
with this kickoff topic about what's going on with the Pokemon Pokemon company so apparently arrest

139
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:04,240
you they're gonna they're gonna come and find you they have a specific set of skills that they're

140
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:10,840
gonna use to find you and kill you or something but anyways so yes apparently the Pokemon company

141
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:18,440
hired some outside forensic experts who are trying to locate I guess some people that leaked

142
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:25,760
information about Pokemon so they had been able to identify for discord users one who was the

143
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:32,880
source and a few others that were helping him spread the images through 4chan and reddit and

144
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:38,400
with that of course they've since they found their usernames they don't know who those people are so

145
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:44,920
now they've gone to the district court in Seattle to try to get a hold of that information from

146
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:52,560
discord and 4chan to try to track down who the people are under those usernames so that's

147
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:59,560
interesting I don't know this has been done like but is it really a crime to leak information about

148
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:05,520
something I mean if you're not under an NDA and somehow you came across that information is that

149
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:11,200
really a crime well that's the problem is that somewhere along the line in NDA had to be broken

150
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:16,360
like if I just happenstance accidentally came across something then somebody still broke an

151
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,600
NDA to get the game but then that person be in trouble but like if I if I like how do you find

152
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:25,560
that out but say I broke an NDA but they know one person but like say I broke an NDA and gave

153
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,480
information to somebody else and then that person didn't spread the information out but now you're

154
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:35,440
hunting after this person that doesn't make any sense to me because it's not a crime it's an

155
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:41,280
inconvenience for your marketing campaign but it's not a crime it's not a crime as in you can't go to

156
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:48,160
jail per se but they would have a case in civil court and I think I kind of think they have a

157
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:55,120
right to protect themselves in that capacity because you know it's just like if the new Star

158
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,280
Wars movie leaked to the internet tomorrow you know three weeks before it's supposed to be in

159
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:04,720
theaters would it necessarily be the person who leaked its fault if it was something that was

160
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,280
given to them no but it's still going to financially damage the results of the film that's copyright

161
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,720
theft that's that's not say that'd be like if you leaked a copy of Pokemon Sword and Shield to the

162
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,680
internet and then people based played that and they're like oh here's all the secrets that's

163
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:24,040
different versus like here's some information I've heard about like say that would be the equivalent

164
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:30,400
of somebody leaking the script for Star Wars the new Star Wars movie or the bits of the script of

165
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:38,920
the new Star Wars movie I don't know I still think it's a slippery slope but I guess they got to try

166
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:46,680
Elliot B in our chat says detective Pikachu on the case absolutely why we are in chat says argument

167
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,520
I own this physical copy of the game I can do with it as I please counter argument you don't

168
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:54,840
own the software your license to use it and doing this is a violation of the license agreement I

169
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:59,000
don't think anybody's going to jail over this but I think Nintendo wants to figure out where is the

170
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,240
leak so we can plug it up you know and potentially go after somebody in a civil court now I I had

171
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:09,560
heard a story about this but you can take it with a grain of salt because I don't have the article

172
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:14,120
or the receipts to back it up so maybe this is full of shit and I'm fully admitting that but I

173
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:22,120
had heard that there were live streams of Pokemon days before it was released that were somehow

174
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:27,880
altered or edited or maybe pre-releases or something that made the game look worse than it

175
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:33,720
actually was when it came to things like loading times yeah things of that nature but that's kind

176
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:39,960
of bullshit like and this was this was angry Dex it you know people that just wanted to bag on game

177
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:45,720
that's still though I mean you're gonna have a hard time proving damages for something like

178
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:51,480
that because you can say well this one video got out there and we suffered you know X number of

179
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:57,880
dollars in damages yeah but like if you sign an NDA that says if you spill you are it says in that

180
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:02,200
NDA you will pay one million dollars and I'm thinking in my mind today there was just some

181
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:07,400
article going around Facebook today because this was a ridiculous use of an NDA but um a comic one

182
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,400
of the guys from Saturday Night Live the young guy that was with Ariana Grande for a short time

183
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,680
what the hell's his name the kid from Davidson him okay he was doing a stand-up show in San Francisco

184
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:23,800
he was making people sign NDAs and the NDA said in it somebody posted it online like you uh would

185
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:28,840
pay one million dollars if you even like talked about the contents of the show online and people

186
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:33,960
were saying how ridiculous that was because you couldn't even criticize or critique the show I

187
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,960
mean it's one thing to be like you can't have your cell phones out during the show because that is

188
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,520
pretty bullshit when people record stand-up comic routines and put it on their own YouTube yeah that

189
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:49,160
is that's that's joke theft you know it's it's it's not that's copyright theft exactly um so

190
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:53,960
that's you know not okay but to take it to the extremes of an NDA where you can't even critique

191
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,880
it that's a little bit like you're not really within your realm here anyway the reason why I

192
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:02,440
bring that up is because it showed the NDA and it said you break this you pay a million dollars so

193
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:09,080
you know in Nintendo's NDA and any NDA um if you go on a reality tv show like survivor where

194
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,120
they know who won survivor whatever the next one is they already know because it's already been

195
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:20,040
filmed and done I mean okay technically they don't know who wins wins until they reveal the votes

196
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,960
but they know they know generally who gets voted out when and who's in the fight right but and it's

197
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:29,400
in their contract you break this you're paying like four million dollars they don't it's up to

198
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:35,880
that it's it could say you could fake you could face penalties of this whereas I still think

199
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:41,560
though even if there was a contract like that I still have a hard time believing that they can

200
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:47,640
prove damages on that okay but counterpoint who has the better lawyers Nintendo or 4chan kid

201
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:55,800
just saying Nintendo's gonna yeah but but to that though Pokemon company so to that though

202
00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:00,840
like I don't know where 4chan is necessarily located is but it's not the site they're only

203
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:05,640
trying to get the site to reveal who it is but like if they're but if I understand that though

204
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,400
but if they're in a foreign country if they're look central in a foreign country they can say

205
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,880
fuck you and your stupid you know court order we're not gonna follow it if Nintendo doesn't

206
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:19,320
have a presence in that country but remember Nintendo has established in USA Canada Japan

207
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:25,800
many parts of uh you know overseas in Britain and surrounding countries I think they're gonna

208
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:33,960
have better luck with discord but but even still though that I don't know I think it's a it's a

209
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:40,120
slippery slope because then then what then you're gonna like start saying oh well these people they

210
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:45,240
they had bad things to say about our game let's find out who they are I mean like you could argue

211
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:50,600
that they cause damages because of their negative critique I understand that they should be

212
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:58,680
protected but but I'm Nintendo and I can fucking sue people so I don't know I go ahead just the

213
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:04,040
thing is is that with any kind of tech company be it software hardware you name it they're

214
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:13,160
part of their financial security lies in secrecy it lies in having something be locked to your

215
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:24,120
self as a proprietary secret so that when you release said item to to quote a term from another

216
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:31,800
company your customers are surprised and delighted by it to have anything sneak out about it

217
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:41,880
beforehand is going to impact that it may you know chase people off of buying the product it may

218
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:47,080
affect those upcoming sales and I think that what they're doing is not over reactionary at all

219
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:55,320
I think that it's like you said they have a leak to plug just because it happens now does not mean

220
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:05,720
this will not happen again right and so I actually I think even just by pursuing it the the simple

221
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:10,040
pursuit of it will set a precedence that companies are going to take it seriously

222
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:15,960
I think for the most part like I don't think it's a big deal that like final evolution you know I

223
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,280
realize for hardcore Pokemon fans it is a big deal but I do agree with Loki in a sense that like you

224
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:25,640
know certain types of information getting leaked is not a big deal oh no you saw what Grookey's

225
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:30,040
final form looked like you know like like how would like let's just assume that like nothing

226
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:34,760
got leaked how would people be taking like this Dexit stuff like because I don't think they

227
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:40,360
announced like here's the Pokemon well you're you just walked right into what my follow-up point is

228
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:44,200
is I think that's what actually makes this a little bit different and why Nintendo wants to

229
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:49,880
go after it because of that hard negativity about Dexit that was online which ultimately didn't

230
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:56,440
matter when it came to sales because it really is selling thing yeah but it still leaks showed you

231
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:01,480
who was missing and that was something Nintendo was trying to protect and I think that might be

232
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:06,680
the key difference here is that I think it's that specifically where that kind of crossed the line

233
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:10,600
for Nintendo was that they knew this was something that was negative and all the ramp up and they did

234
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:16,440
not want it out there who specifically was cut until till the final minute I just kind of think

235
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:25,000
that's what was going on now if and I'm gonna say bold if underline if if okay circled it's true

236
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,600
that somebody was streaming it and they were streaming a misrepresented fully copy of the game

237
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,200
then I think Nintendo should take that person for everything they got honestly because I think

238
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,320
that is fucked if they're streaming though they should be able to find them through

239
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,360
Twitch or YouTube or whomever so again that but that and that's if that was even true which might

240
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:47,720
not have been this is just something I was told so but I think that is way past the line of what's

241
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:52,280
acceptable and so forth and I think especially if you're you're streaming a game you're misrepresenting

242
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:57,080
what that game even is which is so weird that we live in this world where you have to talk about

243
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:04,040
that but I mean y'all have heard of in fake news and I was trying to think of another name for it

244
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:10,360
but I can't it's fake news and what you know the social media does in the spread of that type of

245
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:16,120
you know heavily partisan one way or another type of news and so forth I mean here we are where

246
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:21,320
video games are now kind of walking down the similar path we have we have fake video game news

247
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:27,960
maybe but I imagine we're not that far away from that being a reality so anyway but I think the

248
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:32,520
DeXit thing at its core is what you know Nintendo was was trying to protect now at the end of the

249
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,920
day you know and I've said this on a previous episode of OLR whereas I think the DeXit thing

250
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:41,080
is like oh man that would have been like that would have been the icing that would have been

251
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,480
like the that would have been that sweet glaze that extra thing that would have made this a

252
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,560
perfect fucking dessert Pokemon Sword and Shield is still a really fucking good dessert and I'll

253
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:57,480
get into more of that later on I think it's it's a great game personally so I mean is the DeXit

254
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:03,000
thing noticed yeah is it does it damn the whole game I don't think so I think there's still plenty

255
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:09,640
of variety and things to do then why hide it like I don't understand like if it's such it's if it I

256
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:15,320
it just seems disingenuous to me is the whole point it's like oh we want to hide it before

257
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,600
so we get all those pre-sale copies out there and then it's like oh now you can find out about it

258
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:25,240
like I don't know based on the social media and that negativity on social media there was probably

259
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:30,840
a legit concern within Nintendo that it would impact sales I mean now do you just say oh well

260
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:37,160
it didn't impact it uh sales all harm no all harm don't you want to have your in consumers be well

261
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,840
I guess you don't want your consumers to be well informed when purchasing your products you don't

262
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:45,800
want to know like what intricacies there are so they can make a you know educated decision in

263
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:50,840
their purchase I mean I guess that should be expected from a company that sells two copies

264
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:57,640
of their game every year so why not I don't know I just I have a hard time giving them a bit here

265
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:04,040
Loki and say you know what Rey is Princess Leia's sister enjoy episode nine now that's not a real

266
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,400
spoiler I don't know shit about what goes on that movie and I don't think age-wise that would work

267
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,960
anyway I made that up so don't worry exhale it's a fake spoiler but let's just say I did I just

268
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,560
blurred it out I just want you to be informed before you go see that movie here's the big

269
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:21,720
here's the big spoiler about the ending I mean isn't that kind of fucked up and like wouldn't

270
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:26,520
I mean wouldn't like you know if I'm advertising on my website you know like oh here's the big

271
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:32,200
twist at the end of episode nine it's like IGM publishes this headline no I guess in the sense

272
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,440
if you're trying to say that that's different than the expectations I would have for the movie

273
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:41,720
then that would be a huge um spoiler I picked something ridiculous so you all wouldn't panic

274
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:47,240
so no my my under see what I'm saying is so is it's drastically different from other pokemon

275
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:54,280
game whereas the other pokemon games they have they continue to add to you know the full um

276
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:59,800
list of pokemon they keep adding to it whereas this is the first one where they have taken

277
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:05,560
some away and then added some to that as well so that is what I'm saying about being well

278
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:12,120
informed because most people going into it having not known that might think oh hey cool I'm gonna

279
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:15,560
have all my favorite pokemon in there plus I'm gonna get some new ones and then they go there

280
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:21,000
and wait a second where are these pokemon oh they were taken out of the game I didn't know that that

281
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,200
kind of sucks you know and that that is what I'm talking about being you know well informed about

282
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,280
a games if you're taking something and you're drastically changing something to be fair they

283
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:34,680
weren't that shifty about it they announced like as far back as e3 that not all the pokemon were

284
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:38,520
going to be in it because they were asked that question very directly is every pokemon in this

285
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:44,680
game and they did say no and that was what started the whole hubbub then finally somebody got a copy

286
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:50,040
of the game and said oh I I have the answer here find out if your faves made the cut here's the list

287
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:55,560
and then here cue the reddit post once a day here is one pokemon family that has been eliminated

288
00:26:55,560 --> 00:27:03,080
from pokemon it's so fucking dramatic jesus christ jigglypuff well she dead so

289
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,080

anyway rest in peace jigglypuff with the you know all forever in our hearts with carnations

291
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:21,720
tombstone I mean come on loki some people are really fucking dramatic about this dexa thing

292
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,440
it's not again it's not that big a deal would it have made would it have made a nine and a half

293
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,760
game of 10 probably I mean I don't know I don't know I don't even know if I'd say that all right

294
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:36,680
technical issues aside too but you know yeah well yeah I would say the internet issues and the uh

295
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:42,040
wild area like how it fucking chokes when you're online I would say those issues are a way bigger

296
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:48,200
deal than the dexa thing but anyway all right um let's move on so we're gonna move on past

297
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:53,160
pokemons and talk about how was your gaming week which I left off the sidebar tonight isn't that

298
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:57,320
convenient all right so I guess I'll back it up how was your gaming week folks what types of

299
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:01,800
video games have you been playing this week dark soccer why don't you start us off I didn't really

300
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:07,480
play a whole lot um just because I had to bake five batches of cookies on Tuesday night after

301
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:12,760
work the holidays were this week so you know I had to yeah I had to because they were for three

302
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:19,000
different events that I had obligated myself to um and then actually I know I take that back because

303
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:25,000
we did have a lot of virtual racing going on in my house on Wednesday night like they stayed up

304
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,840
for hours playing fucking virtual racing I'm like it's virtual racing I don't give a shit

305
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:35,480
and play a bunch of pinball and then um actually I did get to play the jersey jack pirates of the

306
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:42,520
caribbean on Thursday because we went to a friend's place for thanksgiving and I got to play that and

307
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:49,960
I got to play um a Jurassic Park the new Jurassic Park stern pinball and I played a little bit of

308
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:54,440
Star Trek because it was there um there's also a uh an iron maiden but I don't really care for the

309
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,640
iron maiden table I still really need to come over and play that Elvira table while you still

310
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:02,040
have it yeah I played Elvira and Alan needs to play it too it's his table Alan's the one that

311
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:06,440
messaged me he's like I had no idea about this I'm like I told Rob he's sleeping on the couch

312
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,560
you know virtual racing has just about enough polygons for the Tesla Cybertruck in there so

313
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:16,520
we have a story on that later actually but um I guess I did do some gaming I just I didn't play

314
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:23,080
Pokemon which I thought I would but I also played my usual phone shit and then then I got like the

315
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:30,280
plague and so I didn't play much played a lot of solitaire all right well I play solitaire every

316
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:36,120
day at work why not solitaire so it's one of those standby good classics it's like my brain

317
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:44,200
D I'm more of a mind sweeper kid but you know I look at it as the the the frying pan of my brain

318
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:50,120
solitaire is the deglazer for the font the fond the bottom of my pan

319
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:55,240
all right let's move on Loki how was your gaming week I don't know did the holidays get in the way

320
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:01,160
of your gaming I didn't really play a lot of the games during the holidays I played Minecraft Earth

321
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:08,920
a bit and very little Pokemon go that's pretty much it I've been mainly just trying to work on

322
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:14,200
my game so I've been working on the procedural level generation portion of it and I got I got

323
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:20,520
it pretty much done I'm just dialing it in now because I want it to look a certain way

324
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:27,320
and it's just deciding between like different settings so that I get it to be just how I want

325
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:34,440
it without because you know I had I had done it in a certain way where it was just like getting

326
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:40,360
ridiculously meandering everywhere I was like no not quite what I want so it's just dialing that in

327
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:44,440
right now and then once I get that done I have to find a way to traverse the room so that I can make

328
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:49,720
the doors one way in a certain way so that I don't get trapped in a dead end because there's

329
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:55,480
no backtracking in the game so yeah that's what I've been working on most of the time that's why

330
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:01,320
I did not play very many games and didn't really buy that many games either because you know it's

331
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:08,360
all the sales and everything I looked at stuff I don't think I bought anything all right maybe I

332
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:14,760
will I wanted to get beat saver but oddly enough that is not on sale most of the sales go through

333
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:20,280
tomorrow which is you know cyber monday so well I mean a lot of the big sellers they don't really

334
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:24,840
discount because they're so it's uh death stranding you know I was hoping there'd be a black friday

335
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:29,960
sale on it nope still too new there was no black friday sale anywhere on it so um and I'll get to

336
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:33,960
that here shortly but I ended up paying the full 60 bucks in order to be able to play it so whatever

337
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:39,480
I knew that was probably going to be the case but I thought maybe there'd be a discount who knows

338
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,240
all right anything else you want to talk about that's it all right let me talk about my gaming

339
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:48,520
week here a little bit so um unlike my co-hosts um probably because I didn't do a lot for the

340
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:53,480
holidays it's just myself Alan and my dad and we had a great thanksgiving dinner though but we go

341
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:57,560
out to eat because you don't want to eat what I'm going to cook and like nobody wants to cook so we

342
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:02,440
go out so thank you to the folks at restaurants that that stay open on thanksgiving so that folks

343
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:06,360
who you know don't really aren't going to cook a great dinner still have a place to eat and I

344
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:11,640
will say we went to a great place we went to the brazilian steakhouse out in roseville which uh so

345
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:16,440
we had the meat on the swords and what was cute was that for their um like you know how they have

346
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:20,520
the food the salad bar right yeah and usually they'll have a selection of hot foods there like

347
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:25,960
soups and things what they did is they replaced all the hot food with turkey mashed potatoes

348
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,480
cranberry I thought they had like the turkey on the swords too no they didn't have the turkey

349
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:35,000
on the swords turkey was over at the salad bar oh that's lame yeah so not quite the same but um

350
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,640
believe me there was no shortage of amazing meat I just felt bad for my dad because he kind of

351
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:43,240
filled up on all the traditional stuff but I think that's what he wanted he wanted to have more of the

352
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:47,240
traditional stuff so he didn't get to try because he was already full by the time all those stuff

353
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:52,680
where it's like Alan and myself were like let's let's split half a piece of turkey and a scoop of

354
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:56,840
mashed potatoes and then that was like all we ate and it was like let's not fill up bring on that

355
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:01,240
bacon that's that's what my wife always says she's like don't fill up on the garbage don't

356
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:05,160
fill up on the salad fill up on the meat it's what we're here for you're paying for the meat

357
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:09,480
you eat the meat he's absolutely right all right but so that was great so thanksgiving was great

358
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:14,680
but outside of that we didn't have a whole lot going on so I played like a shitload of games

359
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:20,440
honestly um I was out playing pokemon go since you brought that up uh a friend of mine took me out

360
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:25,800
who plays the game a lot and was trying to help me along with the team rocket stuff to get Giovanni

361
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:31,640
for this month for the shadow articuno I didn't get all the way there but I did purify 15 pokemon

362
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:35,880
and like I did a lot of those team rocket fights but then like if it hadn't been raining these past

363
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:39,640
couple days I probably would have finished it but the rain starting here kind of like you know you

364
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:45,240
don't want to go outside as much so I didn't end up finishing uh that up but um you know I made a

365
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:49,400
lot of I've done a lot more of those team rocket fights than I ever have since it started I probably

366
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:54,040
did like three times as many in the past three days I have since that whole thing started so

367
00:33:54,040 --> 00:34:01,560
there's that um bonds 006 says I detest those damn tr fights so much yeah they're not my favorite

368
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:07,080
thing but you know my friend made a good point about it was that it kind of gives another thing

369
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:13,400
to do in the game like another reason to craft these pokemon a certain way and have other pokemon

370
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:17,560
have the spotlight that maybe were monopolizing in the gym battles so it's like you have this

371
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:22,520
other thing to kind of work for and do besides just oh I have to catch shinies or oh I have to

372
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:27,000
catch you know perfect hundred percent the ones that you get though the purified ones or when you

373
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,840
do purify them they're not very strong they're they're really not they're kind of hit and miss

374
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:35,640
like those articuno's are crappy now I would think what you do is you save them for a lucky trade and

375
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:39,640
then trade them but I'm told you can't trade purified pokemon I don't know if that's true or

376
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:46,040
not but I would think that's the way to get around the low IVs but I did I fought a Bulbasaur um over

377
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:51,560
at the park not by my house but the other one I fought a Bulbasaur and after I purified it it was

378
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:58,040
15 14 14 so I evolved at once to a Venusaur and then before I evolved I'm sorry I evolved at

379
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:03,080
once to Ivysaur and then before I hit the button to do it Venusaur I heard my friend in the back

380
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:08,280
of my mind say you don't want to evolve that yet because community day is coming up and all those

381
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:12,040
moves will come back and I was like oh shit that's right so I held off and I didn't evolve it all the

382
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:17,400
way to Venusaur so wait for community day so I have that purified pokemon that's high levels

383
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:24,280
that'll be fun so anyway um I also played um so this is fun I have a little bit of b-roll of this

384
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:29,400
oh yes b-roll yay b-roll so um unfortunately it's not going to be great for those of you guys in the

385
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:34,840
podcast uh so I apologize but I will talk through this here a little bit so um earlier today I took

386
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:41,480
a some b-roll of myself playing destiny 2 on google stadia so uh this is what you guys are

387
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:45,880
going to see watch now is I'm firing up google stadia and I kind of wanted to show you guys what

388
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:50,440
it looked like so like the process and uh the green screen effect was horrible I didn't have

389
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:56,120
a chance to tune it so just uh please especially as the the monitor my main monitor gets bright and

390
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:01,960
dark the green screen screws up more and more so um sorry about that so anyway uh how did I get

391
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:07,720
google stadia did I buy it no those buddy passes came out where you can give it to a friend and a

392
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:12,520
friend can get three months so our pal Bobby Blackwolf who's on before us here Sunday nights

393
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:17,800
at vog was a buddy and gave me his buddy pass so I could check out with google state so I could do

394
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:23,160
impressions here on the show just like he did his a little bit uh except and and Jason did a fabulous

395
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:27,160
job here on this show and him and Bobby both talked about samurai showdown so I was like

396
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:31,480
well I'll play the other game I don't I don't mind I mean I know not a lot of first-person shooters

397
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,920
people want to play but I don't mind destiny too I think it uh the destiny series is one of the

398
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:40,760
better uh first-person shooters so why not so you'll notice for those that are watching I'm

399
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:45,960
still trying to get into the game so spoiler alert it still takes a good two minutes to launch the

400
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:52,360
game now that's because I'm counting the time of you gotta wait for the game to load up stadia then

401
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:56,840
you gotta get to the start menu and then it does all the security checks after the start menu and

402
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:00,680
then you gotta pick what you want to do and then here in this phase I'm waiting for two other

403
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:05,160
people to join my fire team so I can go down and do this random thing I don't even I haven't even

404
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:09,480
been paying attention to the stories I've been playing um but I can go I'm waiting patiently so

405
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:14,280
I can go down uh on the fire team and go to the planet and uh do what I need to do it's like

406
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:19,000
Final Fantasy 11 all over again yeah waiting for group now quest buster in chat says wow I'm behind

407
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:25,080
on light levels the game starts you at 750 I have not played the game that much on stadia's but so I

408
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:31,560
started off with like um 750 so it was pretty pretty high when I started off so anyway uh how

409
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:35,400
did I like it how was the experience of playing on google stadia well I wanted you guys that are

410
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,760
on twitch to be able to see some of the visuals so you could kind of see what it looks like and

411
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:45,160
honestly I think the visuals look fine it looks like you're playing a youtube basically I mean

412
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:52,840
there is a notice because I actually bought destiny 2 um on battle net way back when when

413
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:57,800
they first launched on battle net I bought it there and I've been able to play that in 2k mode

414
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:04,840
on my monitor um and it looks really sharp when I'm playing it in 2k mode um so um I don't think

415
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:11,480
it quite looks that good uh the colors get just ever so slightly washed like when you probably

416
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:16,440
watch youtube's of your favorite game um online you probably notice there's a little bit of a

417
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:20,840
wash over the screen a little bit and that kind of holds true when I'm playing in stadia and again

418
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:25,000
I'm playing on a web browser I'm not playing on my television because the buddy pass didn't exactly

419
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,440
give me a uh chromecast or anything like that uh and as Bobby points out in chat remember Rob is

420
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:35,720
playing the 1080p version too and yes that's the other point is that I'm used to playing in 2k but

421
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:40,280
when you are playing destiny 2 in the browser you're actually only getting it at 1080p wait a

422
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:46,840
minute I thought stadia did 4k yeah me too but I guess developers have not yet enabled the 4k

423
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:52,680
streaming or they're not officially supporting 4k streaming at this time um so I'm not actually

424
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:58,520
playing it in 4k but when it comes to how much bandwidth am I actually using to play this the

425
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:04,360
answer ends up being and not that much it's not that bad because I'm uh in 1080p and you have to

426
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:09,800
remember that is further being downsized to the 720p that you guys are seeing in a smaller than

427
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:15,080
720p window here so it actually probably looks even better uh for you guys um that are watching

428
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:20,360
it on twitch right now um me being really bad at shooters but very satisfied that I shot that

429
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:27,240
rocket and blew that guy up so um now prince bright star asks the very important question

430
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:34,440
how is the lag and I'm gonna say that is where I was most impressed with stadia I didn't notice it

431
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:40,120
like you'll notice I'm just plunking away playing my first person shooter the only thing I'm getting

432
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:45,400
frustrated at is how bad my aim is I'm not actually frustrated at oh why am I shooting

433
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:50,680
that ship I have no idea anyway it has a health bar it can be damaged it has a health bar shoot

434
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:58,760
it out of the sky anyway um but yeah honestly like the lag pretty good like it's not noticeable

435
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:05,400
like I was able to successfully you know do what I needed to do while I was playing this um

436
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:13,080
so there's that uh and yeah I mean even though I kind of tease it for taking two minutes to launch

437
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:18,120
I realize that it is an online game and you know you have to find a party and so forth

438
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:22,040
so for the most part a lot of that is understandable I'm not having to wait for

439
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:26,760
it to install patches or anything like that I was able to just kind of get up and running

440
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:32,440
so what did I think of google stadia not too shabby honestly like as far as the technology

441
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:37,720
goes especially if I wanted to just keep playing in 1080p like this here's where I think google

442
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:44,680
stadia is going to run into a problem the I'm not it's a lot of it's to do with the pricing honestly

443
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:50,120
like I'm playing this because it's free for me for three months thanks to bobby having paid for

444
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:54,840
it uh and I'll probably try out those other games that are gonna be free as well but that's only a

445
00:40:54,840 --> 00:41:02,440
handful of games I'm gonna have for 9.99 a month whereas in contrast xbox game pass has a ton of

446
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:08,360
stuff on it right now yes you have to download that stuff to your computer right now how much

447
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:13,160
exact how much longer is that going to be a thing as we get closer and closer to xcloud being a

448
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:21,080
reality so I kind of think google's implemented something you know technology that's pretty nice

449
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:28,040
um but I think microsoft's about to throw them under the bus in about a year uh that games pass

450
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:33,160
man that that's gonna really do it next gen I think even this generation but like it's a really

451
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:42,920
nice offer and I mean I keep looking at xbox ones I'm just like no I'm gonna buy the next one but

452
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:50,920
I don't know it's it's uh because I know with being in this generation uh mainly playstation

453
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:55,240
you know I have a huge library of games I got with playstation plus I don't feel so bad

454
00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:01,160
losing out on that being that um I'll get it all back with games pass anyways so anyway that's me

455
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:05,640
playing uh destiny 2 on stadia so just wanted to I wanted to have a little bit of the visual for

456
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:08,920
those of you guys on twitch you can see like what does it look like what does it actually look like

457
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:12,440
when you boot up how does it go into the game so I wanted you guys to be able to see a little bit of

458
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:17,960
that I have something else to talk about that's a little bit unrelated sure why not just go ahead

459
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:22,760
and sum up I was um I don't know if there's a lot else to say on it it's again it's one of those

460
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:27,720
things where I think the technology is not I mean with as much as we're complaining about bandwidth

461
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:32,840
caps and all that stuff like if I'm still just streaming things at 1080p I don't know if that's

462
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:37,400
really going to become an issue for me I mean maybe I want to try some things in 4k later maybe

463
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:42,440
that is going to be an issue later on I'm not trying to deny that that is an issue but 1080p

464
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:49,240
is good enough just like a lot of 2k gaming for me is good enough right now and I'm enjoying it um

465
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:54,840
I think I think stadia has more of a struggle on its monetary structure it's kind of the same thing

466
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:59,960
Jason said last week it's more the the structure and and how they want you to pay for games when

467
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:03,400
you look at what some of the competition is doing and especially how they're positioning the chess

468
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:08,040
pieces like we're talking about with xbox that's where I fear for stadia but if stadia can put

469
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:12,840
together something real quick that can rival game pass in a way it might be more tempting anyway

470
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:16,600
before I get to my next game Jamie you had a different thought I just wanted to go ahead and

471
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:24,520
mention that today is also uh world aids day excuse me um and so I just wanted to make sure

472
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:29,960
that I put the mention out there for everybody just have the awareness of it and keep those

473
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:35,320
that we've lost in mind so that is an important note thank you for that and I think it's very

474
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:38,920
important everybody know their status and your sexuality has nothing to do with that everybody's

475
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:44,440
know their status everybody should know yeah so so um it's very very very easy to get tested

476
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:50,840
and uh you know in fact it's not the death sentence it once was if you catch it and treat

477
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:56,680
it there's ways to um you know uh basically suppress you know I mean not that we should

478
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:01,480
overlook it by any means but you know there's also this uh saying that undetectable is

479
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:06,520
untransmittable so if you get it treated and you can get down to levels where it's undetectable

480
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:11,720
in your system you still have a lot of options I will you know kind of leave that out there but

481
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:16,280
there's many many many ways you can kind of get treatment for that that weren't there when people

482
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:20,600
were first talking about this in a lot of the media and stuff in the 80s and 90s so definitely

483
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:25,240
look into your local resources check and see if you've got like an LGBT center in your town

484
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:31,400
look for you don't even need that I mean yes it is resources sure resources and you see if you've

485
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:36,360
got sisters in town you know sisters will always help you with resources and education but

486
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:42,760
definitely just make sure that you take care of yourself and it doesn't matter if you what gender

487
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:50,200
you identify with what your body is like who you like sleeping with or not at all if you've had

488
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:57,800
contact with and I'm not just gonna say you know coitus or anything like that but even if you've

489
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:03,960
had injections recently if you have to say you know if you've had a blood transfusion I know

490
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:09,480
the doctors are very careful with it but I mean that's how Ryan White got it in the 80s for a lot

491
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,880
of that is tested and different now it's different now there's no excuse you should know your status

492
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:20,600
exactly so so I'm saying you know I never take it for granted yeah so and one of the quick thing

493
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:25,480
I'll say it's really easy like when I go to my doctor and my doctor is like I want to do blood

494
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:29,320
because doctors want to do blood tests all the time right I go in I'm coughing too much let's

495
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:34,040
do a blood test and I'll usually ask if it's been you know six months since last time I'm gonna ask

496
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:38,920
I'm gonna say hey since I'm going to lab anyway can you throw in this HIV test as well the worst

497
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:42,360
I've ever gotten from the doctor response is do you have a reason to be concerned I'm like no I

498
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:46,280
just want to know my status okay that's that's it they're gonna throw it in they want you they

499
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:51,000
want you to do that test too so anyway good life lesson from dark soccer mixed in here with the

500
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:57,880
gaming stuff all right um other games though I will mention uh for my gaming week pokemon shield

501
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:04,040
so here's here's the update on pokemon shield I beat it that's right I got all eight gym badges

502
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:10,600
I fought uh the championship and I became the champion and I caught the um legendary uh

503
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:16,360
that is integrated in the story so I don't know how much I should say into that not the sword and

504
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:21,400
shield legendary that is the post game so that's the one that's at the beginning of the game yeah

505
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:27,320
the very very beginning of the game that is the post game legendary um so I have not yeah I have

506
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:32,040
not done the post game content yet I'm sure I'll get around to it at some point but then I got

507
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:37,640
derailed with another game that I'll talk about in a moment um but honestly you know I know we

508
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:40,920
were just kind of talking about pokemon the controversy and everything I really enjoyed

509
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:46,440
gen 8 I really really enjoyed gen 8 and I think some of the major differences for this I've never

510
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:50,520
beaten a mainline pokemon game before I've never gotten this far in a mainline pokemon game

511
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:55,000
shane was shook he might not show it because he's shane but he was shook definitely that I beat the

512
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:01,080
game um but uh here's some things that made this generation different number one getting to be able

513
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:05,480
to play it on my television versus being forced to do it on a handheld I think there's just something

514
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:09,560
about that experience I've always enjoyed gaming on the tv more being able to kind of plop on my

515
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:15,640
couch have the big screen and the sound bar and everything um that was really cool number two I

516
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:22,200
think the wild area was a pretty good change because I don't feel this need to grind every

517
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:28,440
pokemon that I miss on a route because I kind of know like a the pokedex shows you what you're

518
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:33,240
missing from a certain route so you know you can kind of always go back and get it later um and you

519
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:37,400
don't feel the need to like oh I gotta go check this online reference I used to do in some of the

520
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:42,200
older games and most of them are available in the wild area number three which I think is the

521
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:49,880
biggest one raiding dynamax rating changed it because now I don't have to grind battles over

522
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:54,680
and over and over again to raise the experience level of my pokemon if I do enough of those

523
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:59,480
dynamax raids you get candy from those raids and you feed the candy to your pokemon and the candy

524
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:04,840
levels them up and it's a great alternative to grinding and I think that was a huge part of it

525
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:10,280
and it's funny because I hear this game get a lot of shit because people go it's not as long as the

526
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:16,840
prior games well how many of those hours in pokemon blue were you fucking grinding on a certain route

527
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:20,440
over and over again to either catch this pokemon that only showed up five percent of the time

528
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:24,440
or to over level your pokemon so that way the next gym fight would not be that big of a deal

529
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:30,360
like so I kind of think there's that I'll need to consider when you're talking about the length

530
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:36,920
of the game is how much of the game was actually interesting sorry not sorry anyway that's a good

531
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:42,680
thing for pokemon gen 8 in my opinion and yeah I mean those are some of the big things I'm trying

532
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:46,120
to think what else I said when I wrote this post on twitter because somebody like directly asked

533
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:50,840
me the question why did this gen stick when the other gens didn't but those are some of the

534
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:55,720
biggest ones right there that you know just made this a lot of fun the end game did kind

535
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:59,880
of keep going and going like I thought I was ready to beat it and it's like no you have to go here

536
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,880
and there but I don't think that's a bad thing at all I mean you know because this game's gotten

537
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:12,920
crap for its story too I suppose I will say I saw a critique about how the game felt like you

538
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:18,920
weren't an active participant in the story that the story was kind of happening around you for

539
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:25,080
the most part and I will say I do see truth in that critique and I can see where that bothers

540
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:29,560
some people I don't think that's to say you don't actively participate at all no certainly there's

541
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:34,360
very important things that your character does in the game but I can get the sense that there's a

542
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:40,520
lot that happens that you don't see or you're not involved with that feels a little weird so I do

543
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:45,080
think that's a valid critique there but it didn't really bother me to the level that it's may bother

544
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:53,640
some other people in that so anyway Bobby in chat says not as long as a positive for me I'm

545
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:58,520
debating on getting it especially because it's not as long as it only has a subset of all Pokemans

546
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:03,560
it's it's a good one to start with I think there's a good reason why they put it on the switch

547
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:10,120
I think all the Pokemon will come back when they do probably a remake they'll probably do a remake

548
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:17,800
of gen four I don't where did they leave off I can't remember Pokemon Uber and Pokemon ultimate

549
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:22,760
there there is a part of me that wonders if they won't just do since everybody's whining if they

550
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:28,760
won't just do like a Pokemon ultimate that has every Pokemon today in it that's just a side

551
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:33,800
Pokemon world traveler yeah maybe something that takes you through all the regions but like an

552
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:39,240
abbreviated they should have a collection collect them all no like a collection like a few games in

553
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:44,760
one you know like a few generations and then just one continuous Pokedex that you can use between

554
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:48,840
them those are all great ideas so but I hope they'll never do any of them I hope there are

555
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:53,800
conveniences from this generation and quality of life improvements that they do look at implementing

556
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:59,400
um in any remake or future generation so uh Elliot B says I don't think I've gotten past the third

557
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:05,640
gym on any Pokemon games in Sapphire same uh I just get bored around the 10 hour mark same

558
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:11,240
but this time when I got bored I just went and did dynamax ratings uh and uh can you start off

559
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:17,160
with those because I've got those little pink areas to look yeah if you can see the pink areas

560
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:22,040
I would say once you get your Y-com which is before the first gym you can raid um you don't

561
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:26,360
want to necessarily jump in all the five stars but you can you can raid well the last thing that I

562
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:34,760
did was the um uh the the mines on the way to the first gym so I might do it after the first gym

563
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:40,120
yeah so after the first gym is a good time and honestly if you get the first gym the second gym

564
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:45,320
is just a hop skip and a jump over the first three gyms are all pretty easy to knock out

565
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:51,400
and then you kind of have a wait before you get to the fourth gym but anyway um so that is uh

566
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:56,600
that is my thought on Pokemon Gen 8 I think it's great um I think a lot of people who are talking

567
00:51:56,600 --> 00:52:01,800
bad about it probably haven't played it yet that's not to say none of the criticisms are valid and

568
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:07,560
it's not a perfect game but it's pretty darn good and it made a great impression on me needs better

569
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:12,440
fashion sense I mean white shorts with white leggings no girl you do get to redress him

570
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:18,280
that's one of the first things terrible yeah I so is that your gaming week uh one more one more

571
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:25,480
okay so one more game I said it was a busy week sorry guys so one more game so um I went out

572
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:30,760
on Thanksgiving and yeah I was one of those people who went to Target on Thanksgiving but I did as

573
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:37,000
well I was really nice I didn't spend any money yeah so I I went and um you know what the reality

574
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,640
is like Alan and I were going stir crazy we were bored like we have nothing to do on this holiday

575
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:45,800
what do we like is anything open so we're like let's just let's just go to you need to play

576
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:54,280
ingress listen no no god I'm like over that anyway so like I was like let's drive to target if the

577
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:59,720
parking lot is a shit show then we'll just drive somewhere else we'll go on a drive uh but the

578
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:03,320
parking lot at Target wasn't that bad it was just like a really bad Saturday morning pretty much and

579
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:08,760
we went in and um there was a ton of people staffing and they had a system and it was fine

580
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:12,760
and I just was very polite I was asked to go stand to one line versus another and I'm just okay I

581
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:17,240
talked to the guy about video games so I just you know tried to you know if I'm going to be a monster

582
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:22,200
and shot the Thanksgiving then at least I can be a nice one um so anyway I got a copy of Death

583
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:26,840
Stranding that's the that's the point and so I've been playing Death Stranding I'm probably about

584
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:33,960
six hours into Death Stranding um or as I called it what did I say in that text message I sent to

585
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:41,480
um Shane I said Death Cake Stranding yes or in the opening of the show tonight let's see I said

586
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:48,120
Reedus's baby fetus no there's all of that too this might be the strangest game ever I'm carrying

587
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:53,560
a dead body on my back across these scenic landscapes constantly having to use l2 and r2

588
00:53:53,560 --> 00:54:00,120
to shift weight while hipster music plays in the background yep girl learn to crouch and uh dark

589
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:06,600
Tetsuya says I still like Dark Souls of walking here's the that description is completely accurate

590
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:11,720
it really is the Dark Souls what do you do in the game you walk how do you know where to walk you

591
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:17,720
press r1 and it shows you where the dangerous terrain versus the non-dangerous terrain is

592
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:21,960
so you can kind of plot plot out carefully where am I going to walk and you do you have to adjust

593
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:26,520
your weight you have to l2 and r2 to kind of like grip the ground and one of the places where

594
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:30,600
I was really struggling was that there's these kind of like again I don't want to spoil story

595
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:34,200
too much but there's like these ghosty things that'll chase you and come after you and they're

596
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:38,520
trying to like basically kill you although well I don't want to spoil but they're basically trying

597
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:44,520
to kill you so um like I was getting really frustrated because the thing would go off the

598
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:49,560
baby would cry and it would say press r1 to hold your breath and so like okay I'm holding my breath

599
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:53,320
well the fuckers would still get me like every time and so I actually went to twitter and I

600
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:57,640
made a tweet I'm like what the hell am I doing wrong and somebody replied and said are you

601
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:03,480
crouching and I'm like oh oh yeah that's a thing it taught you in like the first 20 seconds of the

602
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:10,040
game isn't it but it never to my to my credit the game reminds you to hold your breath it never

603
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:17,160
reminds you again to crouch so I remembered then thanks to twitter to crouch and I was like okay

604
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:22,120
this is a lot easier but the thing about crouching is then you move even slower

605
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:29,320
so it's like you are slowly going through these landscapes and don't leave corpses behind

606
00:55:29,320 --> 00:55:34,360
oh well no and that has explained you very much in the story in the beginning well yeah but people

607
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:39,400
still do that shit but you know how like the very first mission in the game is moving a corpse

608
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:46,120
that's where I was at so um but anyway wait till you get to carry live people oh god

609
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:50,280
why do I have to carry live people they have legs they can walk on their own

610
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:58,760
no you gotta carry them just like the dead yeah so anyway um but I don't know it's it's weird like

611
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:04,440
the story is very interesting it's very cinematic it's very well done I didn't realize that Lindsay

612
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:09,400
Wagner played that part that she played and then it was like oh this by the way Lindsay Wagner

613
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:17,080
and she voiced the oh the the the I know you can't yes the the other character will just say

614
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:20,440
like that I know there's so many like spoilery things I could say but I'm trying to be good

615
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:27,400
she voiced 1.0 and not 2.0 yes yes that is and she but she provided the likeness for 2.0 yes

616
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:35,400
okay so um anyway so um where was I oh Lindsay Wagner was on this television show in the 70s

617
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:38,920
called the bionic woman and the main character in the bionic woman was Jamie Summers

618
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:43,560
it said spelled differently spelled differently that's where I took my stage name from yeah

619
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:50,040
uh quest buster says most weapons are non-lethal for a very good reason yeah I noticed that when

620
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:55,480
I would tackle people you weren't killing them and that does make sense because the story explains

621
00:56:55,480 --> 00:57:00,440
why dead bodies you won't leave them around um so you had to basically tie people up and that

622
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:04,440
was it you incapacitate people just leave them on the ground squirming because you have to do that

623
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:09,560
one of the early missions which would suck if an actual BT did come by for them yeah um but then

624
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:15,960
questmaster says most weapons are non-lethal okay but the weapons there are are pee pee poo poo

625
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:22,840
that's the weapons in the game are pee pee poo poo like and I was like this game is infatuated

626
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:28,360
with pee pee poo poo because there's this whole there's this whole thing like when you're like

627
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:33,240
you are sitting in your little dorm room or whatever spoiler to say that the main character

628
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:40,760
special yes the main character is special and uh has special pee pee poo poo and it can actually

629
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:47,240
and his blood you're making a face but it's true no no I'm I know but the it was actually to me

630
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:53,160
that was an interesting concept you know then they they rationalize it completely in their

631
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:59,720
own weird way why pee pee poo poo is effective yes you learn more though about him as a character

632
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:10,920
than the reason why his bodily fluids and excrement are powerful you see this is why this

633
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:16,680
is why they warn you that drinking too many monster energy drinks is a bad thing it does

634
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:24,280
eventually kill the undead so I mean game of the year contender death stranding is infatuated with

635
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:31,720
pee pee poo poo and it actually it tries to it rationalizes everything it rations this is why

636
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:37,960
I am obsessed with pee pee poo poo here's the whole my thing like if they're collecting blood

637
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:46,280
from him every time he stops to rest how much of his blood do they have like there are so many

638
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:52,520
depending on how often you rest in the game or how many days passed it's just although the there's

639
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:59,560
one have you had the dream sequence yet with uh with uh BB yeah a couple I don't know I don't

640
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:05,960
know if there's a particular one crashing through no the head butting no okay okay first of all I

641
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:13,240
absolutely love the bridge baby I don't I don't like BB I don't like the usage of a baby in that

642
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:17,320
and especially when they start explaining how like that was just really the still mother

643
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:22,520
yeah that's just that was a bit much for me I think it's the side of me that doesn't care

644
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:28,360
for horror films I was like do they do they really have to do this but I like bridge baby as you get

645
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:35,720
to know the bitch bridge the bitch baby did you really as long as you learn more about the bridge

646
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:41,560
baby as you go along so I really like the bridge baby as a character as a conduit to all these

647
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:47,000
other things that went on in the game yeah and I'm gonna leave that again like that again they

648
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:53,160
explain why a baby like they explain it all why pee pee poo poo they explain it everything is

649
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:58,280
logically baby pee pee poo poo no there's no baby pee pee poo poo it's pee pee poo poo and baby

650
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:04,920
because baby because bridge baby is still living in in bridge baby sack but anyway anyway did you

651
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:12,200
meet mama yet no because that's what I'm planning on is one of my cosplays next year okay is mama

652
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:20,200
well I've seen mom but mama oh oh yes I've met mama yes yeah oh you meet her in like the first

653
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:23,720
opening sequence of the game right but that's like I'm good I'm planning on cosplaying mama

654
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:29,400
and I'm trying to figure out how to do her um accessory interesting so anyway yeah and then

655
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:33,320
the one more I swear only one more thing I have to say about pee pee poo poo but since it's so

656
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:38,840
central to this game when you are in the dorm room and you press the button to make Norman Reedus

657
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:45,480
poop which I think is the x button which yes is a thing you can do push button push x to poop

658
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:49,400
and you push it and he gets in he gets at the end it doesn't it's not showing you anything nasty

659
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:53,960
it's one of those like screens it's it's not the south park you know game where there's like a

660
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:59,400
little mini game the at the poop no it's there's this screen that comes up with the frosted glass

661
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:05,320
so you can't see anything advertising some show there's a fucking advertisement for a real show

662
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:12,920
in it's Norman Reedus's actual show on AMC and I was like what Rob what what on earth is this

663
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:18,520
when he's sitting downstairs his crotch repeatedly I've you know I tried did you get punched I did

664
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:23,960
not get punched but he did the thing he's done a few weird things the thing that weirded me out

665
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:28,920
was after the press x to poop and then he got the frosted glass when he gets out he sits back down

666
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:36,520
he looks over at me and winks and I'm like why are you that are you Norman Reedus are you hitting

667
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:41,960
on me that's not the time to be hitting on me number one this is the crazy thing I never

668
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:49,800
thought he was attractive until this game seriously but no it's not until you see a man defecate

669
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:54,760
you truly no attraction pixel paka says I just pooped winked yeah that's kind of what it is

670
01:01:54,760 --> 01:02:00,840
I pooped it's like in the silent earth for mst 3k did you make faces in the in the mirror

671
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:05,800
yes and do the selfies and stuff yes I did find that okay but just stare at his crotch

672
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:12,120
like he does different things if you stare at his crotch a lot yeah yeah I heard so anyway um so I

673
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:17,000
don't know so so then the the 50 million dollar question in chat swung tong asks should I say the

674
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:27,720
$60 question in chat uh is it worth $60 I don't know yet I I still have more to traverse in this

675
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:33,880
game before I truly know if it's worth 60 bucks I will say this for a I I think it is an excellent

676
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:39,240
fucking troll on behalf of Hideo Kojima I don't know if this was planned or not but there's all

677
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:44,440
these people on twitter that love to bash walking simulators right it's like walking simulators

678
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:49,880
aren't games they're just they're just this there's a story that plays out while you walk

679
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:55,160
and I feel like Hideo Kojima was like hmm walking simulator I'm gonna make the ultimate walking

680
01:02:55,160 --> 01:03:01,080
simulator and that's what he's done he's made the ultimate walking simulator game and yet nobody's

681
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:08,120
complaining about it I will say this though I do think the way it incorporates the online is pretty

682
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:12,920
fucking clever like uh I don't know if you guys know this but you can actually kind of edit the

683
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:18,040
terrain so like not like dig holes and stuff but like let's say there's a particularly nasty part

684
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:23,000
of the river to cross you can build a ladder or even a bridge to help you cross the river

685
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:29,400
and other players will see that in their games and they can send likes which help you in your game

686
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:35,480
so that was kind of fascinating and lends itself to this very like in your face theme to the other

687
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:42,360
big question what the fuck is Death Stranding about the fact that we have a need to be connected

688
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:48,760
that is what Death Stranding is about and at least early in the game where my head is that from what

689
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:53,480
we have a need to be connected but if you're also looking at it from the perspectives of the people

690
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:59,000
that you need it could also be involved with the dangers of being too connected that's true it's

691
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:05,160
very End of Eva for me yeah have you seen End of Evangelion no of course not well shit yeah the

692
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:13,240
whole game just strikes me as I think that Kojima like got really drunk one night and watched End of

693
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:18,760
Evangelion on repeat and then decided to make a walking simulator out of End of Evangelion without

694
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:27,160
giant robots appropriate so much in common with the Evangelion mythos but I did think you know I

695
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:34,280
will say this from for for all the pee-pee poo-poo jokes for all the weird baby things that happen in

696
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:39,720
the game for all the Guillermo del Toro appearances except it's not really Guillermo del Toro doing

697
01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:44,520
the voice somebody else no it's not him it's credited in the very beginning it's um yeah

698
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:48,520
it's the it's the voice of LeFou from the original Beauty and the Beast oh okay yeah I thought that

699
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:55,480
they said that it's his likeness but it's not his voice all right well at any rate um I like his

700
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:59,400
character oh yeah he has a he's a great character when he showed up so early I was like oh I thought

701
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:05,240
this guy just had a cameo but no he's he's plays a pretty big role in it yeah I like I really this

702
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:11,800
is one of the few games like this that I've truly liked all the characters except for like one of

703
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:20,760
the bad guys yeah but um because he was just nuts anyway but I even liked one of the other

704
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:29,640
reoccurring quote bad guys and I like I even like the big quote bad as well I do not like 1.0

705
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:36,200
version but I like 2.0 version I like the um the mule was that their name the guys with the gold

706
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:41,000
skull masks and the I think that's a really rad look and I think who also has a really rad look

707
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:47,640
is that guy who has like a black plastic mask on over his face oh die hard man yeah die hard man

708
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:54,920
I think he's got a really rad look he I'm still kind of of two minds about that character

709
01:05:55,800 --> 01:06:01,480
but his actor did like one of my tweets that was cool oh that's cool um I love the look like yeah

710
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:04,920
I would say there's a lot to cosplay in this there really is he's actually a handsome fellow

711
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:11,880
by himself anyway I want Loki to cosplay um Sam Bridges Porter uh carrying 200 kilograms of cargo

712
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:21,640
because it's ridiculous but kind of awesome all right but no one of my favorite characters in

713
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:27,160
the game could be considered uh an antagonist hmm right we'll leave it at that there's more like

714
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:31,800
six hours in and I feel like there's still so much more to uncover but I will say the whole like we

715
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:36,040
are connected and the way so my point I was getting at for all the peepee poo for all the

716
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:41,080
baby stuff the the fact that the theme of the game is around connection and the need to be connected

717
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:46,600
to people and so forth or maybe not the fact that then he built this online component that

718
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:56,120
allows you to be connected in the process of playing this game I was like aha that is art

719
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,760
and that was my review of Death Stranding

720
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:09,320
what'd you think Loki are you gonna buy the game no I don't know I like I yeah I don't

721
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:14,200
know I think some people will love it and some people will hate it um that's and isn't that the

722
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:20,040
isn't that the great part about video games I don't know anyway but I I I would still though

723
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:24,600
I think that even though that's one of my favorite characters I'm actually gonna go and say that

724
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:32,040
both Mama and Lochna are probably my favorite I could see you cosplaying Mama yeah they're my

725
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:36,360
they're really my favorite characters in the whole thing yeah I like the concept between them

726
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:42,040
all right well let's move on uh let's talk about so we've only been here talking about our gaming

727
01:07:42,040 --> 01:07:45,960
weeks for like an hour sorry that was mostly my bad but I like I said I played a lot this week

728
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:51,160
what can I say so we do have some video game news we want to get into um quickly some housekeeping

729
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:57,560
uh we should be here every week through uh December because um the holidays this time are

730
01:07:57,560 --> 01:08:01,720
on weird days so they shouldn't interfere with our show the next show we will be gone will be

731
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:07,000
Martin Luther King weekend January 19th I believe it is so here's the thing and you guys actually

732
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,920
don't know this you're finding this out for the first time uh Allen bought us an anniversary gift

733
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:15,720
today so we're going because January 19th actually happens to be our anniversary so we are going to

734
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:21,880
see um Dear Evan Hansen that night here um because um I was kind of complaining about wanting to see

735
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:25,880
it on Broadway I was like oh I want to see that so he made it happen so we're gonna go see that

736
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:30,440
that's Disneyland week for me well oh that's right you weren't gonna be here anyway right

737
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:34,280
well no I would have been because we don't leave until that Monday but all right well

738
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:38,200
but it's gonna be Disneyland week for packing for Disneyland week so all right yes exactly

739
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:42,920
all right what do you wanna say something before we get into this I'm not doing anything special

740
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:48,840
but do a stream well I might well if my computer would stop shutting down every five seconds

741
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:52,760
remember I'm still trying to get my computer or not being a shithole oh yeah there is that

742
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:56,840
because I've been needing to work on a website and do logo work every time I open my fucking

743
01:08:56,840 --> 01:09:03,240
photoshop to do to piece more on our logo my computer shuts down so I think I'd need to

744
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:09,320
actually replace all the ram in my system and maybe update my bios I don't know but it's it's a

745
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:15,080
pain in the ass um but I did have just a small little thing that good that happened to me that

746
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:19,800
I just found out about yeah I told you when I got in okay so that podcast that I really like called

747
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:23,880
uh stuff mom never told you you know one of my letters got right out and we got some shout outs

748
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:30,120
for the show I got another shout out on that podcast for Muppet Babies when are you guessing

749
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:36,600
I don't know if I'd go to Atlanta and volunteer just because I think that uh you need to go to

750
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:41,000
Atlanta for Dragon Con and then do they go to Dragon Con maybe I've met them yeah Annie goes

751
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,520
to Dragon Con I've probably met them and I didn't even know who they were I don't think Samantha

752
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:48,680
Samantha doesn't cosplay but um because I think this Dragon Con was her first one from listening

753
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:53,960
to the show okay but um Annie does cosplay she does a Winter Soldier cosplay Bobby do I know

754
01:09:53,960 --> 01:10:01,640
these people but in any Bobby does Atlanta better than I do but at any rate um I I've I would

755
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:07,080
actually I mean I don't know if they're listening they said they'd check us out but if I would love

756
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:11,720
to guest on their show and just talk about video games and women in podcasting they the one I'm

757
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:15,880
listening to right now is their episode on fan girls but they've done some great ones about

758
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:21,160
toxic fandom gatekeeping all kinds of things I totally would say check out the one the fandom

759
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:25,720
specific podcast of theirs uh Bobby says I have to see him I'm terrible with names Bobby's like me

760
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:29,160
like I'm so visual like you could tell me about a person I'm like I what do they look like what's

761
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:34,600
her face like and then I'd be like oh sure I've met this person um anyway uh it's horrible for

762
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:40,760
a podcaster I know uh I just tagged the both of them in one of my last tweets so sweet um one

763
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:44,600
thing I want to ask real quick what was the Muppet Babies thing before we get into okay so they were

764
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:49,960
they did an episode about puppetry and women in puppetry and so um Samantha was talking about

765
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:54,360
Muppet Babies and they got on a little tangent about Muppet Babies and you know are they like

766
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:58,840
there's the reboot of them and I happen to be at Target literally after listening to this podcast

767
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:04,680
and I saw Muppet Babies toys so I just snapped it and put it on Twitter said hey Samantha look

768
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:09,960
what I found and so she replied back like yeah I remember when Muppet Babies were first in the

769
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:14,680
Muppets Take Manhattan because not everyone knows that that's the origin of Muppet Babies

770
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:21,960
and so she mentioned it on the podcast I was like hey my my trivial knowledge is not as

771
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:26,920
trivial you can be hosting your own damn thing for 800 episodes and it's still fun to get mentioned

772
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:32,440
on a podcast that you like and respect you know yeah it's still fun I still remember when you were

773
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:38,360
on Greg Proops' podcast yeah a few years ago and he went off on my question yeah you were in a good

774
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:42,600
way in a good way yeah um this was and he's still doing that show right yeah I haven't

775
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:48,440
listened a while we went to the punch line here and I was absolutely just and he actually signed

776
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:53,080
the back of his show notes for me and gave it to me and it's framed somewhere in my house he just

777
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:57,480
told me to keep being awesome I was like that's pretty cool because I asked him if we were heading

778
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:03,800
for a repeat of the French Revolution or the Bolshevik Revolution because of the way our

779
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:08,760
economy and society is moving and that he just went off on that one and it was beautiful.

780
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:15,880
Swongtong in chat says I'm pretty sure I met Rob but was too scared to say hi years ago at PAX lol

781
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:21,640
I'm bummed to hear that I wish you had said hi but let me let me tell you like a secret so if

782
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:28,600
I seem like I'm really like in a zone or like off-putish or something like that when you see

783
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:34,280
me in person or whatever I seem like I'm I'm in doing something else or whatever like trust I am

784
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:41,080
just as nervous as you are like that's some tea so just you know especially at PAX it had to have

785
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:44,600
been packed I can't believe I wouldn't believe this was PAX08 in Seattle because we were all

786
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:49,480
there so it would have been one of the PAX East that they're referring to and so those shows to

787
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:55,160
me were like I was in a town I'm not that familiar with I was at a show that I didn't really have an

788
01:12:55,160 --> 01:13:01,400
agenda for because especially the most recent packs they like well what the fuck ever obviously

789
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:06,120
say it I think Bobby said it on his show too they fucking invited us to do a panel then said never

790
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:09,880
mind we don't want you to do the panel because we got bigger names to do the panel essentially

791
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:13,800
that's the message that I was heard so I was kind of like in that one of those moods where I was

792
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:17,880
like I don't even know what I'm doing at this con except oh I'm having a good time being here with

793
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:21,960
Bobby and running into some of the people I do know back here but I had like no agenda or things

794
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:26,680
to do there so I was just probably like kind of like off of my own little zone or whatever so um

795
01:13:27,240 --> 01:13:35,000
yeah please say hi I promise I don't bite unless um consent is given uh sg100 matt says rob's a

796
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:41,480
pretty cool and fun guy in person thank you for that I appreciate that so all right anyway uh

797
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:45,400
Bobby says they invited us to be on a panel then they took the panel off the schedule then we

798
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:50,280
applied as media and they declined us so we had to bypass this from a listener true true and true

799
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:54,680
and the only thing that I added is that that they took the panel off the schedule to replace

800
01:13:54,680 --> 01:14:01,160
it with one with bigger people that's what it was anyway anyhow let's move on we have other

801
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:08,520
gaming news to talk about Loki's gonna start us off yes and so we've got apparently dev p

802
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:15,400
a playstation 5 death kits spotted in the wild so there is a photo that leaked out to the internet

803
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:19,000
of apparently two of the playstation 5 dev kits and we know these are

804
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:26,120
allegedly playstation 5 dev kits based on the filing that we saw with um you know a story on

805
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:31,560
that a few weeks ago yeah the patent office and it looked fucking weird they are like this weird

806
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:37,640
v-shaped system uh with all these vent holes and stuff on it and yep that's what it looks like

807
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:44,760
some weird v-shaped system with a bunch of vent holes in it so I don't know I mean that doesn't

808
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:48,920
necessarily mean that that's what the final system is gonna look like but at least we have

809
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:55,240
an idea of here's what the dev kit looks like and that they're out there um I hope the final system

810
01:14:55,240 --> 01:15:00,760
doesn't look like that but it's an odd shape I don't really understand the the purpose behind

811
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:06,120
all the vent holes and the way it looks it's I don't know it almost looks like something you

812
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:10,520
would see like you know someone trying to kick start their own like game console or something

813
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:14,360
like the phantom system or something like that I'm trying not to read too much into it because

814
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:20,360
it is a dev kit and I highly doubt this with the actual no it's not sleek looking at all so um a

815
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:24,920
logical uh conclusion in our chat from prince bright star who says it'll help with airflow

816
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:29,000
if people try to stack things on top of it that could be like if you had these units kind of

817
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,520
stacked on top of each other if you're trying to test something like multiplayer but I mean

818
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:36,920
I I can't imagine that this is the final thing since I mean that thing is thick remember when

819
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:43,800
we were looking at the original xbox one and it was everyone kept comparing it to like a vcr I

820
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:50,600
mean this thing is huge it's super thick so I don't know I think it's just one of those this

821
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:56,440
is funky because it's not like a vcr looking thing or it's not a big box it's a very distinct

822
01:15:56,440 --> 01:16:02,760
kind of shape u shape where the airflow is all around in that u um and it's it's just it's a

823
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:06,520
little weird and I think that image is jarring and kind of like what you said what makes this

824
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:11,960
newsworthy is that here we go we have a reddit post that basically confirms those you know what

825
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:16,680
we saw on the patent site some time ago so this appears to be the real deal now granted

826
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:22,760
we know fake news is out there we know it would be easy to fake these things because I'm almost

827
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:27,800
positive we've had fake system pictures before right and people fake them so you should take

828
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:33,480
this with a grain of salt as you should everything but on the other hand this is a dev kit and nobody

829
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:37,880
should be putting that much stock in what this thing looks like anyway yeah the playstation to

830
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:43,800
fake this is like you're playing yourself the playstation 4 dev kit anyways didn't look anything

831
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:49,640
like the playstation 4 when it finally launched anyways so it doesn't necessarily mean it's gonna

832
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:55,240
look like this it would be weird though if it is so I don't know yeah I guess we'll find out later

833
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:59,560
on yeah we will um and it'll be interesting too the repercussions how did an image like this even

834
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:03,160
get out like you know we had all those talks with ndas and I don't know if you read through the

835
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:07,480
comments but which I know you're not supposed to do but oops I did it I was doing some investigative

836
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:11,880
journalism and I went through the comments and some of the popular theories is that it was

837
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:17,480
possibly a cleaning crew that took the picture even though cleaning crews would still have to

838
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:24,120
sign ndas of their own you know I was kind of thinking well right now it's the holidays and

839
01:17:24,120 --> 01:17:30,600
a lot of the usual people probably are not there so you probably have like other people in and they

840
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:35,560
may have signed ndas but maybe they're not as used to seeing this type of stuff or working with this

841
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:43,080
so I don't know my my tinfoil hat is that you had some type of holiday crew in there that was

842
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:47,960
not as familiar with the ins and outs so when they saw it they did something that they should

843
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:52,600
probably know they're not supposed to do but they haven't been tested with that before and so that's

844
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:57,160
where we're at because yeah um somebody else pointed out you can if you were to do some

845
01:17:57,160 --> 01:18:00,360
photoshop fucking around you'd be able to see the reflection of the person in that tv

846
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:05,160
that's in maybe as well these have a pretty good idea what they look like

847
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:13,080
I mean you can sort of see a shadow of a person but like I don't know if there's enough light to

848
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:18,120
actually yeah do anything with that yeah uh dark to see who says you know like the lead up to the

849
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:22,760
switch reveal oh yeah there were so many fakes then well remember when the nintendo revolution

850
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:26,840
was going to project holograms on your wall like that was the legit story which I remember that

851
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:30,680
was the story we talked about on this show I still think that was actually kind of a rad

852
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:36,280
concept or the the one that nintendo on that was like supposed to go on your head or something

853
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:41,320
that is like vr um and then there was the xbox light room but I think that really was that no

854
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:45,720
that is a thing the light room is they never did it they never pushed no that that was actually

855
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:51,080
through microsoft that that that wasn't like a rumor thing that was a luma room was remembered

856
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:57,960
they were showing a luma room light room yeah that's that's an adobe product yeah well what

857
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:02,920
better to talk about more rumors might as well hey you know what y'all it was a slower week because

858
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:08,600
the holidays so rumors and this show isn't just about reporting game news it's about talk about

859
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:13,400
talking about news and sometimes these big rumors are the things that people are talking about

860
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:19,080
especially when you consider the source of this rumor the source of this rumor is on twitter

861
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:24,760
leaky pandy um because this particular leaker has been right about other nintendo directs in

862
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:29,720
the past so this is a leaker with a with a with a resume basically so the tweet says

863
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:36,680
excuse me guys sorry for all the coughing noises and stuff but things happen um leaky

864
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:43,000
pandy says nintendo is planning two new metroid titles that will release in the next two fiscal

865
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:49,800
years respectively one is a re-release of metroid prime trilogy hd the second one is a

866
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:57,640
super metroid remake that mimics samus returns in style and scope well because i love me some super

867
01:19:57,640 --> 01:20:03,560
metroid that second part i mean the first part kind of strikes me as a of course that has to

868
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:09,560
happen at some point it would be weird for them to come out and announce metroid prime 4 when we

869
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:15,400
haven't had a metroid prime game to reference in quite some time and granted we haven't even had a

870
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:23,080
metroid game to reference save for that 3ds relaunch remake or whatever in quite some time

871
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:28,360
so i i kind of feel like nintendo kind of has to do something to like remind us about metroid or

872
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:32,680
or put metroid back out there and make it current again so i feel like something especially like a

873
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:38,920
metroid prime hd or whatever remake collection it's it's got to be a legit you know they're

874
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:43,320
gonna want to have something that kind of leads right into four so that makes a lot of sense

875
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:47,160
the part about super metroid that's the part where i go okay now that's a little different

876
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:53,160
though that part i wasn't expecting yeah and although i i'm not i'm like you can't touch

877
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:59,320
greatness at the same time greatness is already available to play on the switch it's in the super

878
01:20:59,320 --> 01:21:04,040
nintendo library you can go in and play super metroid assuming you have nintendo switch online

879
01:21:04,040 --> 01:21:10,520
which i imagine many of you do um so it would be weird of them to just like re-release super

880
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:15,720
metroid if they don't make some pretty significant changes to it so i think a super metroid with

881
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:21,800
changes in the style of you know samus returns on the 3ds i i think is going to be different

882
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:26,440
enough where i don't think i will necessarily have to have this live in the shadow of the original

883
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:31,720
i'll be curious what they do with it if it's true you know and there is that big if that goes with

884
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:38,920
it what do you guys think it'd be cool to see them do like kind of what they did with was a

885
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:43,800
zero mission or you know something like that where they had kind of the extended super metroid thing

886
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:47,880
oh yeah like with the the more extended end and really the map was a little different too they

887
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:52,680
made some very subtle changes that kind of changed everything yeah um prince bright star in chat says

888
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:56,440
i have to wonder if that second release might support randomization which has become pretty

889
01:21:56,440 --> 01:22:00,360
popular in the metroid and zelda communities you know i brought this up last week or the week

890
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:04,840
before about metroid maker how i was kind of getting into those made one of those ones like

891
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:09,960
randomizer type of things um i i would think it would be a beautiful thing for nintendo to

892
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:16,680
embrace that to an extent um you know i don't know why nintendo won't be willing to put their name on

893
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:20,760
it i mean i guess they feel it has to be of a certain quality and sometimes you can get certain

894
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:25,800
seeds that aren't great quality but i i kind of think nintendo really ought to try chancing it

895
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:31,480
especially with their classic nes library of just i mean sniping a zelda randomizer essentially

896
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:34,920
i mean it's for their game anyway and making it their own where you can generate seeds play

897
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:39,080
against other people online do your own speed runs like i i'm not sure why nintendo doesn't

898
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:44,280
try to embrace this a little more i mean maybe they just are okay with it happening organically

899
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:49,400
because you'll notice as far as i know they haven't ceased and desisted any of the randomizers right

900
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:54,920
which is kind of surprising they've just i mean the randomizers don't you have to have your own

901
01:22:54,920 --> 01:23:00,840
rom so like the randomizers are in an interesting legal area in that regard they're not exactly as

902
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:05,560
touchable um but i'm still surprised nintendo's like not never tried to go after them so there

903
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:12,840
must be some benefit they're seeing to it i don't know so anyway uh it would be very curious to see

904
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:18,840
if this uh all ends up being true about uh the metroid and you know if they really did reboot

905
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:23,720
metroid prime 4 earlier this year then we've still got a couple years to go before that game

906
01:23:23,720 --> 01:23:29,480
is out so i think if this buys us more time and creates more of an awareness or whatever you want

907
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:36,920
to say on hold another hardware by the time that game comes out um maybe i mean because it depends

908
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:41,160
if you want to believe there's going to be a switch pro or a switch plus oh isn't that supposed to

909
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:48,040
happen next year allegedly allegedly so we'll see we got switch light so we've already had the switch

910
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:52,120
minus although some people would say they love the switch light because they do mostly handheld

911
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:56,680
gaming and it is a nice looking thing especially if you have like some of the artistic clam shells

912
01:23:56,680 --> 01:24:01,320
and stuff is a pretty nice looking device so um some people would say the switch light is not

913
01:24:01,320 --> 01:24:06,520
necessarily a downgrade although um you know from the pure technical perspective of the fact that it

914
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:12,200
doesn't dock it is but that's okay they're charging you less for it so all right well moving on we do

915
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:18,520
have some more news for you guys dark sakura well now i will go ahead and before i even go into this

916
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:24,040
i will preface it saying that metacritic can be a little bit questionable um you know it's been

917
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:30,520
used to to hurt games it's been used to hurt people uh who are fans of games so with that

918
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:41,480
being said um metacritic published uh the 15 highest rated games of 2019 uh with exclusion

919
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:50,360
of certain ports um as so to go from the list the top two number one is resident evil 2 with

920
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:58,840
a score of 93 second is uh second uh shadows die twice followed by final fantasy 14 shadow bringers

921
01:24:58,840 --> 01:25:05,400
rob i think you'd be happy with that um monster hunter world and disco Elysium which i'll be

922
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:11,560
honest i've never fucking heard of have you heard of disco Elysium yeah i haven't i'd have

923
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:16,120
to see a screenshot again the visual thing right that is really cool about shadow bringers though

924
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:23,160
um yeah number three yeah um after that is f1 2019 then devil may cry 5 fire emblem three houses

925
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:30,200
slay the spire apex legend as regards wrath super mario maker 2 with a score of 88 baba is you

926
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:36,680
the legend of zelda links awakening and astral chain so but the top three then being resident

927
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:43,640
evil 2 sekiro and uh final fantasy 14 just with final fantasy 14 is just seeing how much that

928
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:51,320
game came back from the garbage it was before they fixed the things i'd say that's pretty impressive

929
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:57,960
yeah and honestly the recent expansion is is stunning and um you know a lot of people

930
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:03,320
are missing out i think um though square enix is an interesting predicament where they need

931
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:08,280
a better catch-up system like so that people can just jump right in to the expansion i mean you can

932
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:12,120
buy like a potion that lets you story skip and level skip and all this stuff but like i don't

933
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:15,960
know you shouldn't have to buy that at the same time um they might want to consider giving one

934
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:21,640
away like they do with world of warcraft or um i i have heard the developers say they are working

935
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:25,800
on the story problem but it probably won't anything won't be in about that until the next

936
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:30,200
expansion so we'll see yeah and prince bright star says in chat they're redoing the 2.0 story

937
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:35,480
yeah i have heard that that they're gonna kind of redo that so um we'll see but anyway all that

938
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:41,080
aside uh shadowbringers is is excellent um kind of surprised to see it so high with all the other

939
01:26:41,080 --> 01:26:45,800
games that have come out this year honestly so that is kind of an interesting treat if again you

940
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:51,000
put stock in what metacritic has to say having the resident evil 2 remake though at the very top of

941
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:55,240
it just seems a little bit questionable to me i mean it's really good please don't get me wrong

942
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:59,800
i think it's very well done it definitely improves on the original and ads i think it

943
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:06,120
actually changes some of the dynamics for the characters in the game um but it is a remake and

944
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:13,080
it is a fairly quick play so Sekiro has a much higher challenge level and it's actually about to

945
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:20,040
match i think the highest of the dark souls games um for its overall revenue um

946
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:27,480
but i am pretty happy to see those as the top three not super surprised yeah interesting of

947
01:27:27,480 --> 01:27:33,000
those three i don't believe resident evil 2 is a game of the year nominee but Sekiro certainly was

948
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:37,720
and i think it was very pretty one of you guys said that one hard as fuck has a real shot at

949
01:27:37,720 --> 01:27:43,240
maybe winning so we'll see what happens i think Sekiro absolutely does have a shot i mean it's

950
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:49,560
it's involved it's in depth it's hard as shit the challenge is real um but it's also got a

951
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:55,880
pretty good story and quite the amazing like introductory uh bit of uh that's what i'm

952
01:27:55,880 --> 01:28:03,160
thinking of bit of the game uh prologue uh yeah opening chapter opening but i think that that it

953
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:08,200
definitely deserves to be on the list all right do and let me ask let me ask this follow-up question

954
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:13,080
how much stock do you put in what metacritic has to say and we'll throw rotten tomatoes in that you

955
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:18,840
know all those uh meta review type of sites i'm asking those in the room and over in our chat room

956
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:25,880
at twitch tv slash vog network my view of it is sort of a generic litmus test of what people

957
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:34,360
are going to think but again it's been quote weaponized as far as damaging certain material

958
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:40,840
that's come out especially the uh the little incels out there like to use it to damage

959
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:47,240
games with a strong female protagonist or things that try to that might challenge their little

960
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:52,520
male-dominated view on things we've seen it happen before those are user reviews though and

961
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:58,120
i always throw those out i especially on those sites i do not pay attention really i thought

962
01:28:58,120 --> 01:29:02,600
there were just critic scores maybe i'm thinking rotten tomatoes i don't know but um well some of

963
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:09,320
the other ones out there so i don't really put the stock in reviews unless it's some like if i'm

964
01:29:09,320 --> 01:29:17,160
watching like say a a webcast that i like like something like um game sack i really i dude just

965
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:23,480
did a review of shanmu 3 and i thought that his review sounded pretty good it was about what i

966
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:29,320
expected of the game and i've trusted his opinion in regards to sega and you know former sega

967
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:37,400
franchises and things like that so um i trusted his opinion but it's getting a generic score when

968
01:29:37,400 --> 01:29:42,840
it's going all the way across the board from people who may not necessarily be the gamer that

969
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:50,760
i am i may look at the score and then go look for reviews but for most of the case i'm gonna form my

970
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:56,760
own opinion on it the the numbers are in the end just numbers they're not going to speak to my

971
01:29:56,760 --> 01:30:02,760
personal enjoyment of something granted i greatly enjoyed resident evil too it was really really

972
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:09,400
good i made dan take me in my pajamas to target to go get it and we had a great time with it

973
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:14,440
um there's other games on that list that i thought were really great like you know mario maker 2

974
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:21,800
and you know uh links awakening of course being on that list uh but overall i mean really i think

975
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:28,680
that the scores shouldn't be oh all these people thought it was great i should get it to no this

976
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:33,400
is why i miss game rentals outside of the red box i miss going to like a blockbuster or something

977
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:39,080
and renting the game and talking to the employees who might have also tried out said game and just

978
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:46,120
getting like an in-person thing i miss you know game stop is okay for that now i missed going into

979
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:50,600
some of the stores like that and having those talks with people i like to see what my friends

980
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:54,920
in the real world thinks like one of my friends crystal um you know there was a game i was super

981
01:30:54,920 --> 01:31:01,160
excited about and they were all hey you know i don't this has just been getting pooped on by

982
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:06,600
this this and this and everyone says this about it and i'm like but they're not my opinion i want

983
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:13,080
to try it and see what i think yeah or people be like oh all these people think this movie is crap

984
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:18,200
and blah blah blah but i like xanadu yeah no it's kind of like it's kind of like i was joking or not

985
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:21,960
joking but talking about the walking simulators earlier and like a lot of people shit on things

986
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:25,640
like everybody's gone to the rapture because they say great there's not a game there but i'm like no

987
01:31:25,640 --> 01:31:29,320
i fucking love that was one of my favorite things i played all year you know so there was a goal to

988
01:31:29,320 --> 01:31:33,320
accomplish what makes that not a game yeah so there was there was something i enjoyed there

989
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:39,080
animal crossing doesn't have a game that you win there's more to do after you pay off your mortgage

990
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:47,240
right so but what's to say that that's not a game yeah you know what's to say that you know

991
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:53,720
reading a book and then playing a narrative game it's the difference between that you've read

992
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:58,920
something versus the fact that you have observed something let me quickly ask loki what do you what

993
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:04,760
is your stock in metacritic um i mean sometimes i'll kind of look at it just to get a general idea

994
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:10,200
of what a game's being reviewed as so like if i see some negative reviews in like like for death

995
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:14,040
strand or something like that where people are just hating on it i'll kind of look at general

996
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:21,000
consensus to see is everybody share that opinion does you know is only a couple of critics that

997
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:27,160
don't like it um stuff like that but usually like i have certain people that i will listen

998
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:34,520
to for their critiques on stuff because they have similar tastes than i do so um yeah i i will look

999
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:39,640
at maybe the broad stroke on metacritic like if something is reviewing particularly strongly or

1000
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:45,720
particularly negatively that wasn't what i was expecting or you know wasn't on my radar i might

1001
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:50,440
kind of look like oh what's what's this noise all about and maybe look a little more into that but

1002
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:54,600
i think for some of those reasons the dark soccer kind of outlined that i just jumped on with that

1003
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:59,960
you know what one just what a critic's perception of the game might not be my own i think for me

1004
01:32:59,960 --> 01:33:04,600
i put much more stock in things like twitch streams where i can kind of really watch people

1005
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:08,600
play the game youtubes would be something like that as well but i like the live nature twitch

1006
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:16,200
and all that so uh yep uh let's see some uh comments in our chat sg100 matt says comment

1007
01:33:16,200 --> 01:33:21,000
sections and game reviews is the reason i stopped reading the comments and game articles honestly

1008
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:27,000
are you missing anything though no so good for you stopping uh metal mayhem says i never pay

1009
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:30,840
attention to metacritic if anything i pay attention to what people on my miscellaneous

1010
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:37,880
friends lists are playing good call um and bonds 006 says i don't care one damn what they have to

1011
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:43,000
say in reviews if it's a review about a huge breaking feature of a game then yeah beyond that

1012
01:33:44,120 --> 01:33:49,640
so yep all right some good thoughts from you guys in our chat room over at twitch tv slash

1013
01:33:49,640 --> 01:33:56,120
vog network meanwhile let's move on to what's next on our list loki so yes unfortunately 2k

1014
01:33:56,120 --> 01:34:03,880
is going to be shutting um down or i should say gearbox is shutting down um battle born so they

1015
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:09,000
stopped doing updates quite a while ago almost two years ago and now uh basically 2k said as

1016
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:15,160
of january 2021 the battleborn servers are going to be deactivated cue the cynic in me that says

1017
01:34:15,160 --> 01:34:22,600
it was still open um right but you know one of the things if you do buy a game like this that is

1018
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:28,280
only online it is now either your copy that you have is completely useless although to be fair

1019
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:34,040
it is free to play now so that's not such a big deal but it still kind of sucks if you did end up

1020
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:38,520
purchasing it at one point or another didn't one of these articles or one of the talk about it

1021
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:42,840
talk about how like wow what's that steam website people use steam spy or something like that yes

1022
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:47,480
and i did look at the steam spy numbers and yes all 12 of you that are playing the game right now

1023
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:52,280
or you actually have it up right now so 12 p even in spite of this news that it's closing soon that's

1024
01:34:52,280 --> 01:34:57,080
been everywhere it has gone up so like so the average number of players is about 12.6 for the

1025
01:34:57,080 --> 01:35:04,280
last 30 days peak being 42 players okay okay so but that's in the world in the world at one time

1026
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:11,240
yeah that's and and by contrast name and is there any literally any other recognized game that you

1027
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:16,120
could give us for con context like uh versus battleborn like dota how many people are playing

1028
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:22,280
dota 2 let's see i'm just trying to think uh i was gonna say totally accurate battle simulator

1029
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:28,840
um not battle simulator uh totally accurate uh battle royale simulating spy won't show you

1030
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:35,080
things like fortnite and um you know blizzard based games like overwatch and things like that

1031
01:35:35,080 --> 01:35:43,640
so you have to bring up something like dota or um uh what about oh paladins is that on steam uh

1032
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:50,440
yeah i think paladins how many people are playing paladins compared to battleboard hold on i was

1033
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:54,200
just gonna pick this one because this is an indie game and i know it's pretty um

1034
01:35:56,840 --> 01:36:01,960
no they don't have okay let's see paladins we're just trying to get a comparison here so 42 people

1035
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:07,880
at its peak we're playing battleborn this month all right we don't know i i don't like this let's

1036
01:36:07,880 --> 01:36:16,520
yeah let's try this here we go so like if you want to go down like something that like for example

1037
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:24,840
dota 2 would have uh 314 000 concurrent players yeah um okay here's a much older game terraria

1038
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:33,800
has 40 000 um concurrent wow terraria wow yeah okay um okay so 42 not that impressive of a

1039
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:37,720
numbers that's sad and again we're not trying to like kick kick a horse when it's already down or

1040
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:41,800
whatever i mean that's unfortunate and some of you guys are hitting the nail on the head in chat

1041
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:47,160
um tiger class says ever since overwatch came out games like that were like it were struggling

1042
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:51,880
ironically paladins though seems to still be kicking along and you know since i named that

1043
01:36:51,880 --> 01:36:56,280
one and bobby says hi rez and atlanta represent yeah but i've actually played paladins it's you

1044
01:36:56,280 --> 01:37:01,160
know it's a similar concept although they do different things as here i'm trying to go down

1045
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:11,000
the list to get down to like some of the um lower doom 2329 like which doom the doom the original

1046
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:17,000
do oh the original not even the 2017 remake or whatever i well it just says doom i don't know

1047
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:24,920
if this is the uh remake one or not um because it doesn't really give me anything uh uh this might

1048
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:30,200
be the remake actually i can't i can't really tell all right quest buster says it doesn't help

1049
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:35,480
since uh that overwatch released a few weeks after battle born no it certainly doesn't

1050
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:41,000
so all of that certainly comes into play so i was trying to find something that was like

1051
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:48,280
really ridiculous um to compare it to that with just kind of go hey see you know this game is

1052
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:57,720
kind of garbage and i don't know all right well moving on let's uh talk about xbox scarlets and

1053
01:37:57,720 --> 01:38:04,680
the oh here you go this i'm sorry i'm sorry this is the perfect example uno has 1075 players

1054
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:11,720
concurrently versus yeah the 12 all right we we get the point we get it all right moving on let's

1055
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:17,720
talk about what the future might hold for project scarlet which is the name of xboxes or microsoft's

1056
01:38:17,720 --> 01:38:24,760
next system uh there was an interview with games radar where uh the uh head of xbox game studios

1057
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:30,760
gentleman named matt booty uh talks about the plans for scarlet's first party support uh saying

1058
01:38:30,760 --> 01:38:36,040
we feel really good heading into 2020 we've got a goal of being able to deliver a game

1059
01:38:36,040 --> 01:38:41,960
roughly every three to four months so that's kind of an interesting and honestly is anyone

1060
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:46,360
surprised after hearing how many studios yeah i was gonna say with all those studios i mean that's

1061
01:38:46,360 --> 01:38:50,200
like surprising again i've been saying this i've been saying this for like a year and a half ever

1062
01:38:50,200 --> 01:38:58,040
since that news came out microsoft has been laying the chess pieces under phil spencer's direction to

1063
01:38:58,040 --> 01:39:05,240
not let their next console go like how xbox one's launch did and i am really here for it because

1064
01:39:05,240 --> 01:39:08,840
i think this type of competition they're going to bring to the table for the next generation of

1065
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:14,520
games is going to be really exciting and i hope to fuck sony's ready for it um or we're gonna

1066
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:19,240
or we're gonna flip-flop again and this you know this has happened every time right when the

1067
01:39:19,240 --> 01:39:23,960
original xbox was out playstation 2 was still ahead of it then sony fell on their face with

1068
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:30,040
the playstation 3 reveal and the 599 xbox 360 was everywhere and then it flip-flopped again

1069
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:38,120
playstation 4 yeah just just like just smack the shit out of xbox one live on stage with those

1070
01:39:38,120 --> 01:39:44,040
really like frankly smug commercials that were hilarious uh and all that stuff i i really hope

1071
01:39:44,040 --> 01:39:49,640
sony does not allow themselves to get crisscrossed again because sony or excuse me microsoft is

1072
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:55,880
setting the table they are setting the silverware this is going to be and now you have to add this

1073
01:39:55,880 --> 01:40:01,560
whole cloud stuff into it too like even if you're one of those people that's like i never buy xbox

1074
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:08,280
xbox isn't really my thing and you need to wake up and take notice to what's about to happen because

1075
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:13,480
everything that's going to be xbox is going to impact the pc gaming world too where maybe you

1076
01:40:13,480 --> 01:40:18,440
do game so microsoft's going to really come out swing in 2020 i'm adding a little bit of editorial

1077
01:40:18,440 --> 01:40:25,400
to the real news piece there sorry uh which is uh the uh matt booty from xbox game studio saying

1078
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:31,960
a goal of being able to deliver a game roughly every three to four months so um obviously halo

1079
01:40:31,960 --> 01:40:37,400
infinite is going to be one of those a big launch title um kind of piggybacking on this a little bit

1080
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:42,840
cyberpunk 2077 um we know that game is coming out in march but it probably will not make

1081
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:49,640
scarlet or playstation 5 right around launch and that is uh according to a new earnings call from

1082
01:40:49,640 --> 01:40:53,880
cd project red they are developing for the new console but they're not going to be able to

1083
01:40:53,880 --> 01:40:59,240
release this at launch it could be a cross-gen title but they don't want to target anything as

1084
01:40:59,240 --> 01:41:03,720
soon as holiday 2020 and i suppose that makes sense because who knows how much time they've

1085
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:10,120
actually gotten to play with these new systems or anything like that so um bonds 006 in chat says

1086
01:41:10,120 --> 01:41:14,920
i was saying similar to a few co-workers earlier this evening about xbox and how it will impact

1087
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:20,760
pc gaming absolutely and look i realize there's many of you out there who don't follow microsoft

1088
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:25,960
because you're like eh halo not my thing and they don't have a lot of first-party franchises i'm

1089
01:41:25,960 --> 01:41:32,760
into and i get it i've been very much the same way sometimes but you have to understand phil spencer

1090
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:40,600
ever since he took over he has been laying this plan out that you're gonna notice next year and

1091
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:46,200
if your problem is their first party titles well this is why they acquired all of these new studios

1092
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:51,480
to try to combat that problem if you don't really want an xbox because you're kind of like i'm over

1093
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:55,080
buying all these different consoles well that's why we're gonna have streaming or we're gonna

1094
01:41:55,080 --> 01:42:01,160
have these features for pc like if you're a gamer don't sleep on microsoft i'm not even saying that

1095
01:42:01,160 --> 01:42:07,800
as a fanboy like i i like all games i'm just i'm excited for this competition and what this next

1096
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:12,200
generation is going to bring like 2020 i think it's just going to be an exciting fucking year

1097
01:42:12,200 --> 01:42:18,520
in that regard right yeah like you know you guys don't really follow microsoft but you have to admit

1098
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:22,120
like there's there's something to what i'm saying right yeah it looks interesting they're gonna

1099
01:42:22,840 --> 01:42:26,760
be because i haven't really bought i haven't really bought in on like a lot of the playstation

1100
01:42:26,760 --> 01:42:33,800
exclusive stuff so like uh for example you know god of war was all right death stranding

1101
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:40,840
the strand is okay but like i don't know like like horizon's pretty fun last of us just doesn't

1102
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:46,680
really do anything for me and same with uncharted and i don't know i even like on the microsoft

1103
01:42:46,680 --> 01:42:53,000
side like not necessarily force is kind of cool but i i just don't really know like i'm looking

1104
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:57,560
a lot of multi-platform games and like especially you know deep down your favorite is nintendo it

1105
01:42:57,560 --> 01:43:05,480
still is all these years later we know it's still your fave i mean i guess all right well

1106
01:43:05,480 --> 01:43:11,480
it only took 800 episodes to get that all right all joking aside let's move on uh dark sakura

1107
01:43:11,480 --> 01:43:17,720
you love these types of stories so i know you want to talk about this tonight yes i indeed do

1108
01:43:17,720 --> 01:43:25,880
okay so i i'm sure people remember the legend of rod caliber right where we beat soul caliber

1109
01:43:25,880 --> 01:43:32,440
on dreamcast with fishing rod so and of course we've tried to use our ddr pads to play games

1110
01:43:32,440 --> 01:43:37,000
and things like that well someone and this is probably one of the few times i'm going to bring

1111
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:43,560
up halo stuff on purpose someone beat halo 3 on legendary with the guitar hero controller

1112
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:54,760
that is impressive um so and i mean we're talking about you know roughly a 10-hour game

1113
01:43:55,560 --> 01:44:05,960
but someone went in and did the thing with a guitar hero controller um there is a d-pad on

1114
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:11,960
that thing now that i think about it like you can do it it's just like yikes that's that's wow

1115
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:19,560
wow that's so he put a video up on it there's no analog sticks the username is super lewis 64

1116
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:28,760
and um yeah there's a whole video up i'm sure they have a way how he did it um and he's using this

1117
01:44:28,760 --> 01:44:36,680
the strumming and using the uh the standard fret buttons and he actually put in there his mapping

1118
01:44:37,320 --> 01:44:43,240
with the fret buttons for how he had everything you know what they were what all the buttons were

1119
01:44:43,240 --> 01:44:51,960
set for and that the uh the the strum bar is for moving forwards or backwards and then left and

1120
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:57,560
right or action you know uses a different modifying aim left aim right we're also set on

1121
01:44:58,360 --> 01:45:03,400
the empty so i'll um i'll find the video and link it in chat for everybody sorry i didn't know there

1122
01:45:03,400 --> 01:45:06,840
was a video i would have put it up as b-roll but that's all right for our podcast they're gonna

1123
01:45:06,840 --> 01:45:13,640
want to find it too so right and but the but it's put up by a super lewis 64 i'll i'll go ahead and

1124
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:18,920
put it in the chat i'll make sure you get a link to it that's silly but fun yeah i wonder if that's

1125
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:23,160
because like accessibility things that you know you can map anything to anything sure yes the

1126
01:45:23,160 --> 01:45:29,480
accessibility controller can do all sorts of crazy stuff with so all right uh this isn't quite the

1127
01:45:29,480 --> 01:45:34,440
same i think is using the rod cap uh doing rod caliber um sj100 matt in chat says i remember

1128
01:45:34,440 --> 01:45:39,800
hosting a party where we played mortal combat on ddr pads back in college with enough alcohol and

1129
01:45:39,800 --> 01:45:43,880
drive anything can be played on a different controller oh yeah for sure i thought didn't we

1130
01:45:43,880 --> 01:45:48,120
play something silly on the dreamcast ddr pads at your house i seem to remember that was a thing

1131
01:45:48,120 --> 01:45:53,080
those dreamcast dr pads were so weird too because they had that weird like plastic layer on top of

1132
01:45:53,080 --> 01:45:59,880
them that was kind of funky yeah it was super funky um i mean and mine like completely separated

1133
01:45:59,880 --> 01:46:06,840
so it was like you know a dance dance slide revolution fall on your face and die yeah um but

1134
01:46:06,840 --> 01:46:13,640
uh but boom boom dollar y'all right fucking boom boom dollar and i passed i mean that's the first

1135
01:46:13,640 --> 01:46:19,240
place i passed paranoia was at home yeah on the dreamcast i didn't have this vivid shit when i

1136
01:46:19,240 --> 01:46:28,600
was playing ddr fucking kids all right let's move on low-key all right so valve has uh taken a

1137
01:46:28,600 --> 01:46:36,600
thousand games off of steam that have been abusing their tools mainly a lot of these games are

1138
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:45,800
actually from a specific uh user on actually i think a specific developer or several developers

1139
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:51,080
are actually one developer so what they're doing is it's this uh publisher called uh

1140
01:46:51,080 --> 01:47:00,280
degstan technology had 48 games on the platform and um apparently there's um some other ones

1141
01:47:00,280 --> 01:47:07,800
yet they've lost their entire library but i think a lot of these could be that they're just like

1142
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:12,760
re-release they're releasing games changing they're kind of abusing the system by just

1143
01:47:12,760 --> 01:47:17,640
spamming games on there like for example i've seen some videos before where they're showing

1144
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:21,640
some of the games that they have where they'll just kind of change what the character looks like

1145
01:47:21,640 --> 01:47:26,280
and just republish the game over and over and call it something different or release a game

1146
01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:33,000
four times on the platform they try to get you know steam card sales um stuff like that there's

1147
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:38,680
a whole a lot of it's made off of the steam card trading stuff where they you know anything that's

1148
01:47:38,680 --> 01:47:44,040
easy card earnings people will sell it and they get a portion of that and they make their money

1149
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:51,640
that way and they give out the keys for free type of thing but um yeah they said that some of the

1150
01:47:51,640 --> 01:47:57,880
games though that were on there weren't necessarily um just put up there for a quick buck there's a

1151
01:47:57,880 --> 01:48:05,560
game called electric highways that had been on steam since 2015 had 1300 positive reviews so

1152
01:48:05,560 --> 01:48:13,000
i don't know why that one got banned but that's kind of weird um sometimes you make a broad

1153
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:18,280
stroke like this you're probably going to catch a few that maybe were more of an on the bubble

1154
01:48:18,280 --> 01:48:23,080
sort of thing like maybe yeah without looking at like the exact games that were banned maybe that

1155
01:48:23,080 --> 01:48:27,880
person like put up a legit game and maybe start spamming games i mean who knows um but there's

1156
01:48:27,880 --> 01:48:33,880
a lot of um they said basically they said a handful of partners are abusing some of steamworks tools

1157
01:48:34,520 --> 01:48:43,240
um they didn't really specify what exactly they were doing or yeah all right well moving on

1158
01:48:43,240 --> 01:48:48,200
let's talk about um man you know earlier we talked about like final fantasy 14 and how that game has

1159
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:52,520
really um come a long way uh since the beginning and now it's on these metacritic lists and so

1160
01:48:52,520 --> 01:48:56,760
forth well how about no man's sky this is another one of those games that has managed to really

1161
01:48:56,760 --> 01:49:01,720
reinvent itself and yet again uh they've put out a pretty major update it's not a major major update

1162
01:49:01,720 --> 01:49:08,280
but a pretty big update uh the synthesis update uh which includes a new upgrade system that will

1163
01:49:08,280 --> 01:49:13,160
allow you to go to one of the starship outfitting terminals to spruce up your spacecraft so you can

1164
01:49:13,160 --> 01:49:17,400
upgrade one of your ships all the way up to an s class and then you can add inventory slots to

1165
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:22,120
a spaceship hooray that's good uh there's also a new salvaging system that or i should say the

1166
01:49:22,120 --> 01:49:26,200
salvage system has kind of been reworked a little bit so you can break down ships that you no longer

1167
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:31,400
want into actual materials so that's pretty cool um a lot of quality of life improvements to this

1168
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:36,360
as well hello games redid the inventory systems that's kind of interesting now you can just drag

1169
01:49:36,360 --> 01:49:41,240
and drop things uh into your inventory so that's yeah that wasn't there before so that's pretty

1170
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:45,480
cool uh and you can do different outfits within the customized menu so you can switch between

1171
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:50,920
outfits because dress up is a very important part of any multiplayer game so that's pretty cool uh

1172
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:57,320
the update is out this week uh so it already came out i should say 300 bugs squashed in synthesis as

1173
01:49:57,320 --> 01:50:02,200
well and uh you know what a turnaround story again for this game you know our voiceover guy

1174
01:50:02,200 --> 01:50:05,240
jason and i were texting a little bit i still haven't played it since they've done all these

1175
01:50:05,240 --> 01:50:10,520
updates i really need to go back and i think if i remember correctly i did also buy it on pc so i

1176
01:50:10,520 --> 01:50:15,160
i really need to go back and these updates are for vr as well as non-v yeah i still haven't played

1177
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:21,080
in vr yet either um so uh vr will let you ride creatures and do new no man's sky photo mode

1178
01:50:21,080 --> 01:50:26,280
so that's pretty cool cool yeah so um lots and lots of uh little changes they say over 300 bug

1179
01:50:26,280 --> 01:50:30,680
fixes uh and that was all out within this past week you know and i'm sorry a voiceover guy jason

1180
01:50:30,680 --> 01:50:34,200
and i were talking about how does this game kind of continue to make money because he was asking

1181
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:39,480
me he's like do they have a storefront or are they selling like premium currency or something nope

1182
01:50:39,480 --> 01:50:45,160
they don't they don't sell any of that there's no uh further cost continuing sales i guess

1183
01:50:45,160 --> 01:50:49,640
games service there's no continuing service besides well they they released on two more

1184
01:50:49,640 --> 01:50:55,400
platforms so pc and xbox sure but that's a big difference from what anthem is doing to make money

1185
01:50:55,560 --> 01:51:02,360
right um so uh yeah i mean i the only thing i can come up with is that when they do these big

1186
01:51:02,360 --> 01:51:07,240
releases they tend to not put the game on sale they're still charging full price for the game

1187
01:51:07,240 --> 01:51:12,040
but i think full price for no man's sky is down to like 30 bucks and you're only paying that full

1188
01:51:12,040 --> 01:51:18,200
price if you buy it like you know right around one of these big patches otherwise you can usually

1189
01:51:18,200 --> 01:51:22,040
find it during a sale for a lot cheaper and i don't know with this being i didn't really look

1190
01:51:22,040 --> 01:51:26,360
because i already own the game on all the platforms i won it on but um i would imagine

1191
01:51:26,360 --> 01:51:33,960
like is there a um i don't know is there like a a sale going on right now for black friday that

1192
01:51:33,960 --> 01:51:38,920
maybe you can still pick this up cheap i don't know well cyber monday yeah and that too this

1193
01:51:38,920 --> 01:51:42,120
whole this whole kind of weekend i think a lot of websites just kind of put something up for

1194
01:51:42,120 --> 01:51:46,600
the whole weekend friday to monday yeah i was actually checking epic just to see what was there

1195
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:50,840
and actually rayman legends is free right now oh is that their free on and that's their freebie

1196
01:51:50,840 --> 01:51:57,160
right now wow uh nifty 805 in our chat says i want a baby yoda sidekick it's not yoda yeah

1197
01:51:57,160 --> 01:52:00,920
it's yeah so i was gonna say it's it's not supposed to be yoda right well yoda's been

1198
01:52:00,920 --> 01:52:06,680
dead for like by because this is after return of the jedi uh-huh and yoda died in return of the

1199
01:52:06,680 --> 01:52:15,160
jedi uh-huh so spoiler i'm just kidding fucking a but it said in between um return of the jedi and

1200
01:52:15,880 --> 01:52:22,760
whatever the the new ray movie was um but it's they never did come out and name yoda species

1201
01:52:22,760 --> 01:52:30,520
there was another one in uh uh the the prequels that was named yaddle rattle something like that

1202
01:52:31,080 --> 01:52:35,000
but they never did mention the name of the species and for all the people out there by the way

1203
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:43,240
who are saying that it's biting off of gremlins first of all fuckers empire strikes back came out

1204
01:52:43,240 --> 01:52:51,240
in 1980 or 81 80 something like that yeah it came out in 1980 gremlins came out in 1984 i

1205
01:52:51,240 --> 01:52:55,480
actually don't see the gremlins resemblance at all besides the pointy ears which is you know

1206
01:52:55,480 --> 01:53:00,040
vulcans had pointy ears come on little damsel like look at the eyes and be like it looks like

1207
01:53:00,600 --> 01:53:05,560
look at infant humans how big their eyes are on their faces right look at kittens how big their

1208
01:53:05,560 --> 01:53:11,960
eyes are on their faces it's a thing that happens with babies and it's roughly a toddler of its

1209
01:53:11,960 --> 01:53:18,280
species so stop it with a stupid meme it makes you look like an idiot bobby black wolf and chat

1210
01:53:18,280 --> 01:53:25,160
said boomer okay you know what i'm gen x all the way so you can bite my butt nobody didn't like you

1211
01:53:25,160 --> 01:53:31,080
i know forget it all right it's a meme i've seen the meme that meme's clever all right bobby says

1212
01:53:31,080 --> 01:53:37,320
it's baby yoda and tell the creators tell me what to call him or her or it yoder nifty 805

1213
01:53:37,320 --> 01:53:43,720
i'm calling it kiddo i know that it's not yoda but the internet um you know it's stupid too all

1214
01:53:43,720 --> 01:53:49,240
right quest buster says someone is working on modding baby yoda into battlefront too well

1215
01:53:49,240 --> 01:53:53,640
because the internet of course they are of course they are beyond two souls is 15 bucks all right

1216
01:53:53,640 --> 01:53:57,400
let's you know what let's travel back to a simpler time we're gonna travel back to a simpler time in

1217
01:53:57,400 --> 01:54:03,720
gaming where there was no baby yoda there was simply just yoda uh it's uh once uh once a week

1218
01:54:03,720 --> 01:54:08,200
we like to step into the gaming vault and find a game that dark soccer thinks hey you ungrateful

1219
01:54:08,200 --> 01:54:15,160
brats you should be checking this game out but in a 2019 twist once a month she likes to spotlight a

1220
01:54:15,160 --> 01:54:20,760
soundtrack for the month and i bet you guys have no idea what it is so i didn't tell you about my

1221
01:54:20,760 --> 01:54:25,720
fuck up earlier do you want to know about my fuck up dark so do you know how i i capture b-roll

1222
01:54:25,720 --> 01:54:31,000
every week so what i did is i clicked the button to start recording and then i went off to take a

1223
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:35,720
shower the only problem is i clicked the button above the one that starts recording which is the

1224
01:54:35,720 --> 01:54:43,880
one to start streaming girl so anyone who went to my personal channel probably knows what's coming

1225
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:48,520
so sorry about that but it was an honest mistake i'm more worried about the fact that

1226
01:54:48,520 --> 01:54:53,560
i broadcast a game that wasn't really the game and it was somebody else's playthrough

1227
01:54:53,560 --> 01:54:57,640
like i was like oh shit i don't want to get in trouble no nintendo is going to be sending

1228
01:54:57,640 --> 01:55:01,560
lawyers out well luckily it's not an internal game it doesn't matter they're gonna do it anyways

1229
01:55:02,200 --> 01:55:07,880
luckily i i tried to delete it all and and make no trace it was an honest mistake i think people

1230
01:55:07,880 --> 01:55:14,200
understand so anyway all right so uh i i apologize if it was spoiled for you but what is the classic

1231
01:55:14,200 --> 01:55:19,880
classic soundtrack of the month i picked fantasy zone but i specifically picked fantasy zone

1232
01:55:19,880 --> 01:55:27,000
for this sega mark 3 because first of all i love i fucking love this

1233
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:31,640
you mean i'll turn up the sound a little bit here just for a moment yeah let's listen for a sec

1234
01:55:36,280 --> 01:55:43,960
this is on the strong part right that's really good this is an eight-bit uh system so for me

1235
01:55:43,960 --> 01:55:47,560
to get into this i'm gonna have to get into a little bit about the sega mark 3

1236
01:55:47,560 --> 01:55:53,000
the sega mark 3 is roughly considered the precursor to the sega master system

1237
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:59,320
but the mark 3 was also marketed as a home computer of sorts physically it looks actually

1238
01:55:59,320 --> 01:56:08,200
kind of not unlike the atari home computers of of its era it is um an 8-bit uh an 8-bit system

1239
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:19,320
but it had the plug-in fm uh music unit so um now built in it was just a ti sn76489

1240
01:56:20,280 --> 01:56:29,160
chip but you could like i said go into and attach the uh an fm module to boost up that sound quality

1241
01:56:29,160 --> 01:56:37,000
and that's what we're listening to here um as far as that fm sound unit on its own um

1242
01:56:37,880 --> 01:56:47,640
it would plug in it was its own little box to it um it was sold uh it starting in 1987 for 6800 yen

1243
01:56:48,680 --> 01:56:58,040
and it used a ym 2413 fm chip that built above the built-in uh ti chip texas instruments chip

1244
01:56:58,040 --> 01:57:04,360
and so when the sega master system hit the japanese market that fm sound unit was built

1245
01:57:04,360 --> 01:57:09,800
into the japanese version of the sega master system and of course not all the games released

1246
01:57:09,800 --> 01:57:16,760
supported this one but fantasy zone sure as fuck did and fantasy zone is great so um you know and

1247
01:57:16,760 --> 01:57:23,480
i've done fantasy zone for the classic game of the month too it came out in 1986 um and then it had

1248
01:57:23,480 --> 01:57:31,320
an international uh release after the arcade game um it was the first of its series and um it just

1249
01:57:31,320 --> 01:57:35,400
you know really keep gaming music's happy i can listen to this music all freaking day

1250
01:57:38,120 --> 01:57:45,160
but at any rate um its first port was to the sega mark 3 and the master system um and then of course

1251
01:57:45,160 --> 01:57:52,520
it got other reports um but the uh the music on this one in particular and of course with the fm

1252
01:57:52,520 --> 01:57:59,480
for the uh master system is that it opened up so many more channels if you listen to

1253
01:58:00,120 --> 01:58:04,680
the soundtrack from say the american release that doesn't have the fm sound

1254
01:58:05,560 --> 01:58:13,800
it is kind of dinky sounding but you get this and it's on par like i was saying earlier with the um

1255
01:58:13,800 --> 01:58:22,440
with the arcade um and i know i had the the all right there's the composer on here i had that

1256
01:58:23,160 --> 01:58:33,240
so the composer for this is um a kaguchi hiroshi um who has worked on a lot of of games for for

1257
01:58:33,240 --> 01:58:38,680
sega and this is actually one of the earlier games he worked on the first one was called

1258
01:58:38,680 --> 01:58:45,640
girl's garden and he worked on it with yuji naka he did uh hang on space harrier alex kid the lost

1259
01:58:45,640 --> 01:58:52,520
stars ghost house outrun enduro racers both afterburners uh other things that people would

1260
01:58:52,520 --> 01:58:58,280
know about turbo outrun sort of vermilion um trying to pick some other things rent a hero

1261
01:58:58,280 --> 01:59:06,200
outrunners and um he did like some other games too like some he did virtual fighter uh 3 tv

1262
01:59:06,200 --> 01:59:11,560
he did derby derby owners club online rob that's one of ours so he did our horse whipping game

1263
01:59:11,800 --> 01:59:18,520
and um he actually i fucking miss derby owners club more recently going back to our music game

1264
01:59:18,520 --> 01:59:25,800
roots worked on my mind in fact there's some really good remixes of fantasy zone music in

1265
01:59:25,800 --> 01:59:35,720
my mind but yeah the this really and i feel like i really missed out not having this as my first

1266
01:59:36,440 --> 01:59:44,920
home version of fantasy zone my first fantasy zone was i think the the tangen one um which it

1267
01:59:44,920 --> 01:59:52,680
wasn't very pretty i'll go ahead and just tell you that right now but um but i can't do our last

1268
01:59:52,680 --> 01:59:59,720
soundtrack of the month without doing such a classic that had such a beautiful you know

1269
01:59:59,720 --> 02:00:05,400
bright soundtrack for a home release and also to let people know that while we were sitting here

1270
02:00:05,400 --> 02:00:12,600
with our dinky dinky you know four channels our friends in japan had this and it's so completely

1271
02:00:12,600 --> 02:00:19,880
unfair all right there it is now i need to have my own sega mark 3 just because the classic

1272
02:00:19,880 --> 02:00:25,000
soundtrack of the month fantasy zone but specifically on the mark 3 so that that

1273
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:29,880
system can be acknowledged at some point yeah and of course then the fm uh

1274
02:00:30,840 --> 02:00:37,640
uh i got my brain went to no my brain was going to say fm towns but i'm at the fm uh capable uh

1275
02:00:37,640 --> 02:00:42,920
japanese master system oh yes it is okay so and i think that there were versions of fantasy zone

1276
02:00:42,920 --> 02:00:47,640
for the towns but there was fancy zone on everything like you said somehow a sega game

1277
02:00:47,640 --> 02:00:51,720
like fantasy zone even ended up on the nes thanks to the whole you know tangen bottle so

1278
02:00:52,600 --> 02:00:59,160
it's it's it's uh quality is questionable so i don't actually think it did come out on on

1279
02:00:59,160 --> 02:01:05,560
towns oh well then super fantasy zone with sega mega drive which if someone can find me a legit

1280
02:01:05,560 --> 02:01:12,360
okay people in japan or somewhere in asia if you can find me a super fantasy zone for the mega

1281
02:01:12,360 --> 02:01:22,760
drive i will um i'll bake for you i will ship it to to your country all right so it and it

1282
02:01:22,760 --> 02:01:28,760
can't be a repro it has to be legit old school uh super fantasy zone for the mega drive

1283
02:01:29,160 --> 02:01:34,280
all right all right there it is the classic soundtrack the final one for the year 2019

1284
02:01:34,280 --> 02:01:40,200
so that's it so yeah next we should probably uh take a walk down memory lane and recap for the

1285
02:01:40,200 --> 02:01:46,120
year what all the classic soundtracks were but um in the meantime uh what what's coming up next year

1286
02:01:46,120 --> 02:01:54,040
pinball oh that's right classic pinball so i am gonna do things that are i'm gonna start with the

1287
02:01:54,120 --> 02:02:01,320
the ones that had a dmd so you know this got the animation on it not just like

1288
02:02:01,320 --> 02:02:05,720
and this actually does exclude one of my favorites rob it excludes black knight 2000

1289
02:02:06,600 --> 02:02:13,480
but it's going to be any of the era of games pre-pinball 2000 but starting with some of the

1290
02:02:13,480 --> 02:02:19,640
with whatever the first ones to have the the full dmd is so um if people have suggestions

1291
02:02:19,640 --> 02:02:23,080
go ahead and throw them my way or else you're just gonna be getting you know world cup soccer

1292
02:02:23,080 --> 02:02:29,720
every month kidding um but you know these and i'm trying everyone knows that like my freaking

1293
02:02:29,720 --> 02:02:35,080
favorites are like world cup soccer and theater of magic and all that but i want to go to some of the

1294
02:02:35,080 --> 02:02:41,960
other ones that might not be as well known but on a month you're feeling uh last minute you might

1295
02:02:41,960 --> 02:02:50,360
see one of those well and the the thing is is that there are good games that are pre that dmd area

1296
02:02:51,240 --> 02:02:55,480
that i think you know like swords of fury for example go fucking listen to the soundtrack

1297
02:02:55,480 --> 02:03:00,760
for swords of fury that is phenomenal it's great you know black knight 2000 also good but i want

1298
02:03:00,760 --> 02:03:05,480
to get some of those ones that people might have had a chance that they've seen while they were

1299
02:03:05,480 --> 02:03:11,960
new out in the wild all right well stay tuned for 2020 in that segment now to recap 2019 and

1300
02:03:11,960 --> 02:03:17,880
the classic 8-bit soundtrack of the month uh in january we had the guardian legend because of

1301
02:03:17,880 --> 02:03:24,760
course we did in february we had journey to sillius march we had avadox april we had jackal

1302
02:03:25,320 --> 02:03:33,000
may we had wonder boy 3 the dragon's trap june we had r-type july we had quartet uh august we had

1303
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:40,120
blaster master september we had akumajo densetsu and october we had ducktales and november we had

1304
02:03:40,120 --> 02:03:46,440
metal gear and closing it specifically the msx msx 2 metal gear and closing out the year

1305
02:03:46,440 --> 02:03:50,840
specifically the sega mark 3 because it wouldn't be a jamie segment if she didn't like no no i

1306
02:03:50,840 --> 02:03:57,640
want to use this to spotlight the soundtrack and the system we have fantasy zone specifically on

1307
02:03:57,640 --> 02:04:03,080
the sega mark 3 um i honestly think the fantasy zone is one of those games that really did just

1308
02:04:03,080 --> 02:04:09,720
show off um the power of the fm unit yeah so if you're a little newer to orange launch radio um

1309
02:04:09,720 --> 02:04:14,360
dark soccer has been uh screwing with the segment for a couple years now we had in 2018 the classic

1310
02:04:14,360 --> 02:04:19,240
peripheral of the month and in 2017 it was the classic console of the month that was the one

1311
02:04:19,240 --> 02:04:24,360
that kind of started it all so um and you can uh visit all of that if you want if you're curious

1312
02:04:24,360 --> 02:04:29,800
has this game ever been picked uh go visit our wiki it's like a it's an unofficial slash official

1313
02:04:29,800 --> 02:04:35,080
wiki unofficial because we don't touch it or edit it because i literally don't know how like i have

1314
02:04:35,080 --> 02:04:40,360
to ping dark tetsuya on twitter and say help like i did that today i said help this is wrong can you

1315
02:04:40,360 --> 02:04:47,400
fix it do the thing um but also official in the fact that we we look at it and like the reason

1316
02:04:47,400 --> 02:04:51,400
why that all came up is because dark soccer and i were having an offline conversation and i was

1317
02:04:51,400 --> 02:04:56,440
like wait the wiki's wrong so we actually look at it and i couldn't tell you what happened on

1318
02:04:56,440 --> 02:05:00,360
the show last week and i kind of like had a feeling i did but i didn't see it on there i was

1319
02:05:00,360 --> 02:05:06,600
like well shit i'll do no i've had if i have a good idea what happened well i don't care i was

1320
02:05:06,600 --> 02:05:11,240
gonna pick duck tails again and i was like i remember cutting this video like just like weeks

1321
02:05:11,240 --> 02:05:17,160
ago yeah uh but no i and then rob's like are you sure and then we looked at the wiki together like

1322
02:05:17,160 --> 02:05:22,040
we're missing a month what the fuck happened and then i actually thanks to the twitch archive

1323
02:05:22,040 --> 02:05:26,360
i looked at episode and thanks to the sidebar on the side it made it really easy to find okay

1324
02:05:26,360 --> 02:05:29,880
where's the classic game where aha here's where duck tails is in the missing the episode that's

1325
02:05:29,880 --> 02:05:36,120
missing in the wiki so yeah so but at any rate um you know and for folks if you just want to

1326
02:05:36,200 --> 02:05:41,160
message me on the twitters it's at dark sakura you've been using that more i have not just for

1327
02:05:41,160 --> 02:05:46,680
cross-posting i have been but um just because facebook is shit um i got my finally got my

1328
02:05:46,680 --> 02:05:52,920
invite to uh wt social i did too and i don't like it live journaling i've been trying to use like

1329
02:05:52,920 --> 02:05:57,560
live journal all right i'll be i'll check out yours see if i get inspiration but anyway but

1330
02:05:57,560 --> 02:06:04,280
anyway um so if you've got uh you know that era of pinball if there's particular games you like you

1331
02:06:04,280 --> 02:06:08,840
know if you really want me to do the getaway you know i don't know if i'm going to do the getaway

1332
02:06:08,840 --> 02:06:13,880
i don't really care for it but you know send me a message of the pins that you like and there's a

1333
02:06:13,880 --> 02:06:22,360
very likely chance that i might say hey that is a good one let's do it um bobby is kind of subtly

1334
02:06:22,360 --> 02:06:26,760
asking for his page to get updated because it's been about eight years uh saying the wiki says

1335
02:06:26,760 --> 02:06:31,080
something about the ferret and clicky the pen and wow that's a joke we haven't referenced in forever

1336
02:06:31,080 --> 02:06:33,960
well i don't know if you want to remove it but yeah you probably want to change the

1337
02:06:33,960 --> 02:06:38,840
tense to like it was a former joke it was an old joke it's in a box in my house but looking up

1338
02:06:38,840 --> 02:06:44,520
old jokes is is part of the reason why the wiki is there but i i'm i support a uh i support a

1339
02:06:44,520 --> 02:06:49,320
freshening up i support renovations on bobby's profile to make it current i remember that

1340
02:06:49,320 --> 02:06:56,120
shermy was the best foot warmer ever yes yes all right um let's see swang tong is asking is shaking

1341
02:06:56,120 --> 02:07:09,000
and crying dead um no i no but it may change um but i don't want to make any promises that i can't

1342
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:14,040
keep all i can say is that victoria went on that trip to new york city with me when we went to go

1343
02:07:14,040 --> 02:07:18,920
see broadway plays which doesn't that sound exactly up the alley of what shaking and crying

1344
02:07:18,920 --> 02:07:23,800
is all about and so we definitely talked about like what we want to do when it comes to podcasting

1345
02:07:23,800 --> 02:07:30,440
but while we were there we kind of came up with a different idea that we were both really into

1346
02:07:30,440 --> 02:07:33,560
and then thanksgiving happened and we got completely derailed because she's been out of

1347
02:07:33,560 --> 02:07:39,400
town and you know i've been busy so and i still had that idea i know well and this is the one

1348
02:07:39,400 --> 02:07:45,720
victoria and i have is completely different it's not what you think so um we will um it'd be

1349
02:07:45,720 --> 02:07:51,160
exploring that in the near future that's all i can say so yes bobby knows what it is near near i have

1350
02:07:51,160 --> 02:07:55,720
to tell bobby because i'm like bobby i'm gonna be inviting all this traffic onto the website that

1351
02:07:55,720 --> 02:08:01,000
you weren't expecting is that okay and then it's like what traffic lol well you never know i i

1352
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:07,960
might have the next big idea all right then you might appreciate what happened a couple weekends

1353
02:08:07,960 --> 02:08:13,240
ago for a sister stitch and bitch session sure quickly because we're almost to 8 30 we did break

1354
02:08:13,240 --> 02:08:17,400
out into show tunes part b of our show to get to we fully broke out into show tunes all right one

1355
02:08:17,400 --> 02:08:21,080
of these nights i'm gonna come to the bar when you all are there and do that all right what

1356
02:08:21,080 --> 02:08:25,880
happens yeah bobby did approve the idea it's on it's on me and victoria we haven't got up off the

1357
02:08:25,880 --> 02:08:31,960
ground to do it yet i i think you guys will like it if you said uh nifty says that podcast was

1358
02:08:31,960 --> 02:08:37,480
cute to me we need to hear you two theater queens geeking out i think you'll like the idea we have

1359
02:08:37,480 --> 02:08:43,640
in store it's a little more free form i i don't know how to explain it without making promises

1360
02:08:43,960 --> 02:08:48,840
then be expected to deliver on all right so for now let's go to rapid fire news let's uh travel

1372
02:09:53,960 --> 02:10:02,680
story 3 and castlevania lord of shadow mirror of fate hd all right some of the early impressions

1373
02:10:02,680 --> 02:10:07,320
of the witcher's netflix series are starting to leak out onto social media technically it's

1374
02:10:07,320 --> 02:10:14,040
embargoed until december 20th um but i guess some critics uh who have seen the first few episodes

1375
02:10:14,040 --> 02:10:20,120
have uh written some tweets and so forth uh one critic critic said i'm quite liking it in a tweet

1376
02:10:20,120 --> 02:10:24,760
i'll have more to say when the embargo drops uh one other one says i've never really been thirsty

1377
02:10:24,760 --> 02:10:28,920
for henry cavill uh i've seen a screener of the first episode of the witcher and i think i'm

1378
02:10:28,920 --> 02:10:36,520
pregnant uh the fight choreography is insane first fight is beautifully savage uh the witcher's cast

1379
02:10:36,520 --> 02:10:41,800
both lead and supporting are beyond exceptional amazing cast all around um so it sounds like

1380
02:10:41,800 --> 02:10:47,000
there's a lot of actually pretty good feedback on the witcher series which you know usually shows

1381
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:52,040
that are based on a video game don't do so well but oh it's not actually based on a video game

1382
02:10:52,040 --> 02:10:56,040
it's based on the books that the video game were also based off of if y'all were starting to type

1383
02:10:56,040 --> 02:11:00,920
the correction in chat i know it and i guess to be fair i say that uh a lot of games haven't made

1384
02:11:00,920 --> 02:11:05,480
good shows but uh the castlevania anime has been pretty well received from what i understand yeah

1385
02:11:05,480 --> 02:11:11,160
the ingress anime was mixed i i could not get into that and uh what else what other games about a

1386
02:11:11,160 --> 02:11:16,040
show that i'm not thinking of in the moment um i feel like there was another big one i'm like

1387
02:11:16,040 --> 02:11:20,680
neglecting in the moment obviously 14 is supposed to get one i'm really excited about that i'm

1388
02:11:20,680 --> 02:11:25,320
curious how that'll go there's actually something else kind of along with the show ish thing is that

1389
02:11:25,320 --> 02:11:30,840
animal crossing new horizon is getting a manga oh fun yeah they've got i can talk more about

1390

they've sort of got minecraft story mode as like an interactive okay minecraft yeah yeah yeah yeah

1391
02:11:35,160 --> 02:11:40,120
sort of okay anyway uh moving on uh i did not know this game was getting like an expansion but it is

1392
02:11:40,120 --> 02:11:45,080
the stanley parable remember that it was at e3 yeah it was a few years ago so no actually that

1393
02:11:45,080 --> 02:11:50,280
was this year no no no the original game all right a few years ago the expansion was this year yeah

1394
02:11:50,280 --> 02:11:56,040
the stanley parable ultra deluxe a remaster slash expansion that will take the original game and add

1395
02:11:56,040 --> 02:12:00,840
some new content and new endings uh it's been delayed till next year womp womp but at the same

1396
02:12:00,840 --> 02:12:04,920
time delays aren't bad news anymore so if that's what they it's not like you don't have the and

1397
02:12:04,920 --> 02:12:09,400
that was how they prefaced it with like they're reading fan mail and all the fans are like we

1398
02:12:09,400 --> 02:12:14,600
want to be perfect and we don't care if you delay it well there you go challenge accepted so they've

1399
02:12:14,600 --> 02:12:19,720
delayed it uh till next year and honestly my plate's been pretty full this year so

1400
02:12:21,080 --> 02:12:24,840
a delay to next year is not the end of the world dark soccer what do you have for rapid fire news

1401
02:12:24,840 --> 02:12:30,040
um capcom is going to be releasing a new game in december um according to some listings for

1402
02:12:30,040 --> 02:12:37,080
japanese game expo um gamatsu uh there's actually a translation from gamatsu that um says that the

1403
02:12:37,080 --> 02:12:43,960
capcom's jump festa 2020 exhibit um they are going to showcase four titles at the event two are known

1404
02:12:43,960 --> 02:12:51,960
to be mega man zero slash zx legacy collection and a monster hunter world iceborn it could also

1405
02:12:51,960 --> 02:12:57,480
be possible that uh the devil may cry collection could take one of those but there's one more

1406
02:12:57,480 --> 02:13:04,520
that's unknown so we will find out uh the fest is going to run between december 1st to 22nd

1407
02:13:04,520 --> 02:13:11,640
in cheeba i don't suppose it's a dino crisis hd collection no well one of the other things

1408
02:13:11,640 --> 02:13:17,800
though is that of course they are working on a resident evil 3 um remake to follow the

1409
02:13:17,800 --> 02:13:23,480
resident evil 2 remake so uh they're really wanting people to leave some feedback on that

1410
02:13:23,480 --> 02:13:28,520
one are we gonna get a resident evil 8 because 7 is supposed to be pretty good i feel like they're

1411
02:13:28,520 --> 02:13:34,040
kind of stuck in the fuck out in the remake thing uh and eight i mean seven kind of had that whole

1412
02:13:34,040 --> 02:13:39,960
vr and non-vr stuff going on so i don't know what they've decided to do with eight at this point

1413
02:13:39,960 --> 02:13:43,400
i think it'll happen but these remakes are serving them pretty well for now

1414
02:13:43,400 --> 02:13:50,920
rob it's up to us to take down umbrella i don't want you to end up in a jamie sandwich

1415
02:13:50,920 --> 02:13:59,880
right anyway um there's gonna be um a update for death stranding to tackle some common requests

1416
02:13:59,880 --> 02:14:04,920
including improving the font size now keep in mind when i was looking at this i was looking

1417
02:14:04,920 --> 02:14:10,360
really tiny font on really tiny screen and i was fine but not everyone has super jamie vision when

1418
02:14:10,360 --> 02:14:14,040
you take off your glasses and everything's huge yeah if you're sitting next to a monitor you can

1419
02:14:14,040 --> 02:14:18,760
probably see it okay but yeah it's it's like the subtitles are all right i was like oh why are

1420
02:14:18,760 --> 02:14:23,160
people playing but then i saw like in the quest menus and stuff i'm like okay damn that is some

1421
02:14:23,160 --> 02:14:32,600
tiny ass text wow um um but also um there um there's gonna be another thing that addresses

1422
02:14:32,600 --> 02:14:38,120
a request to be able to dispose of individual vehicles so they're looking about patching that

1423
02:14:38,120 --> 02:14:46,040
in for the mid-december patch um and hold on just double check to see if there's anything else i

1424
02:14:46,040 --> 02:14:50,120
don't even have a vehicle yet i will say where i'm at in the game and i don't think this is spoilery

1425
02:14:50,120 --> 02:14:56,440
vehicles were in trailers um i i have the quest to because i just got the ability to build like

1426
02:14:56,440 --> 02:15:01,800
a power source in my structure so i have a directive to go build one of those next to a bike

1427
02:15:01,800 --> 02:15:05,720
that's run out of power it's been sitting there for a while so that's so for those of you that

1428
02:15:05,720 --> 02:15:09,720
played death stranding that's exactly where i'm at in the game well there's they did with the

1429
02:15:09,720 --> 02:15:16,760
last update um had some performance improvements and uh worked on some network functionality um

1430
02:15:18,120 --> 02:15:25,720
but yeah there you go so that's our current quick stuff all right so let's travel around the world

1431
02:15:25,720 --> 02:15:30,040
and check out what is coming out this week in world release dates i imagine it's a pretty slow

1432
02:15:30,040 --> 02:15:34,040
week being that the holidays just occurred but you never know i do you think so and you're right

1433
02:15:34,040 --> 02:15:38,680
you never know what's right around the corner in fact we have several things coming out this week

1434
02:15:38,680 --> 02:15:45,320
so we have blair witch coming out on playstation 4 we have halo reach um on pc i believe that's

02:15:45,320 --> 02:15:51,960
just being added to the master chief collection uh life is strange episode 5 on pc playstation

1436

1442
02:16:43,880 --> 02:16:47,160
pretty still a pretty busy week i thought i would have thought it would be a dead week but not

1443
02:16:47,160 --> 02:16:52,840
really um it's starting after this week it'll start to slow down a bit and then really die off

1444
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:57,240
about the second or third week in december fair enough well japan since things are a little

1445
02:16:57,240 --> 02:17:00,920
different holidays are kind of a different perception over there uh it's a very different

1446
02:17:00,920 --> 02:17:05,320
kind of week uh we got some big names out this week in japan on the playstation 4 including yokai

1447
02:17:05,320 --> 02:17:12,440
watch 4 plus plus on the playstation 4 so that's you know a a disc or a non-handheld release uh for

1448
02:17:12,440 --> 02:17:17,000
yokai watch that's a pretty big deal i i wish that series hadn't kind of disappeared here i was into

1449
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:21,080
it in the beginning so i wish they would try a playstation 4 or switch release also something

1450
02:17:21,080 --> 02:17:25,720
in a high tv show oh yeah that's true all right so but anyway still pretty big over there though

1451
02:17:25,720 --> 02:17:29,480
oh no it's still huge over there so i'm not too surprised to hear i kind of wanted to sit and

1452
02:17:29,480 --> 02:17:35,400
watch the anime just because i love uh the folklore of yokai um also out in japan this

1453
02:17:35,400 --> 02:17:40,440
week the dark pictures man of madan um gets its release in japan this week they are saying it is

1454
02:17:40,440 --> 02:17:44,280
an english version it hasn't been localized for japan um but that is out if they want to check

1455
02:17:44,280 --> 02:17:49,720
that out uh and then a game called citadel is out this week as well and what is arguably the

1456
02:17:49,720 --> 02:17:53,800
biggest release in japan this week no just kidding it's definitely yokai watch but you know this one

1457
02:17:53,800 --> 02:17:59,720
caught my eye oni chambara origin is out on the playstation 4 this week oh that's right if you

1458
02:17:59,720 --> 02:18:05,240
don't know oni chambara you should check it bikini samurai that's right it's all the the ladies

1459
02:18:05,240 --> 02:18:12,120
wearing very little clothes i really wish more of the simple 1000 games or 2000 games actually ended

1460
02:18:12,120 --> 02:18:19,080
up coming out um aside from just you know earth defense force and on chambara i mean like they

1461
02:18:19,080 --> 02:18:25,720
had ambulance versus zombies and that's really the only other one i remember but uh more simple

1462
02:18:25,720 --> 02:18:31,240
series games or games like that all right well looking at the nintendo switch of course yokai

1463
02:18:31,240 --> 02:18:35,480
watch 4 plus plus is out on that system as well but then we have another couple titles we have

1464
02:18:35,480 --> 02:18:42,200
a game called moto new pus osumatsu san uh which comes out from d3 it looks like it's like just

1465
02:18:42,200 --> 02:18:46,360
a match 3 type of game but like there's two different versions of this game and everything

1466
02:18:46,840 --> 02:18:52,040
so it's yeah simple controls match 3 i guess there's a story that goes with it i don't know

1467
02:18:52,040 --> 02:18:57,720
seems like kind of a big deal for a match 3 game um always a big deal though is a pretty princess

1468
02:18:57,720 --> 02:19:01,480
game that's right pretty princess magical coordinate is out this week on the switch as

1469
02:19:01,480 --> 02:19:08,360
well where you get to decorate over 1300 castle excuse me castle rooms with 1300 items you can

1470
02:19:08,360 --> 02:19:13,320
customize your character and feel like a princess you can do princess training lessons and mini

1471
02:19:13,320 --> 02:19:18,200
games so you can perfect your wave i'm sure as the decorating thing sounds kind of fun um and

1472
02:19:18,200 --> 02:19:22,280
then you can have your princess make poses and take pictures of the finished rooms how about

1473
02:19:22,280 --> 02:19:25,960
that it's a one to four player four player game so i guess you get to decorate together

1474
02:19:26,680 --> 02:19:32,040
so there it is so japan japan's still a pretty fun week right see there's lots of stuff coming out

1475
02:19:32,040 --> 02:19:37,960
that's right how about europe uh a decent amount so on the second we have life is strange 2 for

1476
02:19:37,960 --> 02:19:43,800
xbox and playstation farming simulator 20 for switch never winter nights enhanced edition for

1480
02:20:04,200 --> 02:20:08,920

02:20:16,840 --> 02:20:22,040
narco's rise of the cartels for the playstation and xbox

1483
02:20:25,240 --> 02:20:31,640
so that's it all right there it is release dates from around the world um still pretty pretty busy

1484
02:20:31,640 --> 02:20:35,000
this early december but yeah probably because we're right in that gap where it's like okay

1485
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:38,920
now's your last chance to get the game out before the end of the year uh before christmas and all

1486
02:20:38,920 --> 02:20:44,120
that stuff so all right well let's move on uh every week we invite your emails that participate

1487
02:20:44,120 --> 02:20:48,520
at orange lounge radio.com and we like to read some of your emails here on the show so again if

1488
02:20:48,520 --> 02:20:53,080
you want to send us an email for a future week please do participate at orange lounge radio.com

1489
02:20:53,080 --> 02:20:58,680
and dark sakura is going to jump in the mailbag and read some stuff okay um so uh we have one

1490
02:20:58,680 --> 02:21:04,120
from robert m which is sort of a follow-up from the bunch of other operating system questions but

1491
02:21:04,120 --> 02:21:10,520
i will go ahead and read part of this too um just uh just keep going um is citing older versions of

1492
02:21:10,520 --> 02:21:15,560
mac and ios systems from the last time the older games lost support and catalina that is correct

1493
02:21:15,560 --> 02:21:23,480
catalina no longer supports 32-bit applications and games so um um and then he asked is super

1494
02:21:23,480 --> 02:21:30,600
multitasking plus ultra is it 64-bit yyr that would be a yyr question i don't know please let

1495
02:21:30,600 --> 02:21:38,200
us know if it's a 64-bit app um the discussion of half-life alex as valve's first game in a

1496
02:21:38,200 --> 02:21:45,000
long time reminded me of the recent forgotten uh card game artifact i assume if it's still

1497
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:50,600
uh being supported it probably is not going to see as much of an uptick as magic games are as

1498
02:21:50,600 --> 02:21:56,760
the hearthstone alternative so how about that like magic yyr is in chat thank you so much

1499
02:21:56,760 --> 02:22:03,800
buddy uh saying it is 64-bit on mac 32-bit on windows so it's where it needs to be to run

1500
02:22:04,520 --> 02:22:10,040
so there you go all right so yeah if you're gonna play it on a mac upgrade i mean you can know you

1501
02:22:10,040 --> 02:22:17,240
can do it on the current os's so yeah sorry brain went around okay and then um i got a two-part

1502
02:22:17,240 --> 02:22:23,640
email from flaco jones oh important footnote from yyr but future mac support is up in the air will

1503
02:22:23,640 --> 02:22:30,760
be determined over the coming months i wonder if that has to do with um sales so mac fans get on

1504
02:22:30,760 --> 02:22:35,240
that super multitasking i'm making that up he didn't say why i imagine it's probably difficult

1505
02:22:35,240 --> 02:22:39,400
give me an app store link and i'll make it fly well i don't think it's on the app store yet

1506
02:22:40,040 --> 02:22:44,680
it needs to be in the app store yeah i don't know there might be there might be a problem with steam

1507
02:22:44,680 --> 02:22:49,400
green light in the way that was all put up i don't know i don't know that's a that's an oh and and

1508
02:22:49,400 --> 02:22:52,920
the leaderboards are built into the games that would be a whole undertaking for him so i can

1509
02:22:52,920 --> 02:22:58,280
understand why he wants to focus he wants to focus on his expansion first i'm sure anyway hey i just

1510
02:22:58,280 --> 02:23:02,040
wanted to pop in with a little correction on your game rewards talk so that you have the right info

1511
02:23:02,040 --> 02:23:07,960
on how they work this is flaco jones by the way while fans do get a vote and how these awards go

1512
02:23:07,960 --> 02:23:15,080
it only accounts for 10 of the vote the voting jury composed of 80 media and influencer outlets

1513
02:23:15,080 --> 02:23:20,680
from around the world accounts do the other 90 of the vote so unless the vote is really close i

1514
02:23:20,680 --> 02:23:27,960
don't think fans have much of a sway over who actually wins if they did i doubt a small game

1515
02:23:27,960 --> 02:23:33,800
like overcook 2 would have beaten all those much more well-known nintendo games for best family

1516
02:23:33,800 --> 02:23:39,000
game last year also over half of those outlets are from outside the united states which makes

1517
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:44,760
them less predictable based on how those games are received from our perspective here in the us

1518
02:23:44,760 --> 02:23:49,640
the jury isn't entirely made up of critical publications like i mentioned earlier if it

1519
02:23:49,640 --> 02:23:54,840
was just based on critics control probably wouldn't have a chance as it was the lowest

1520
02:23:54,840 --> 02:23:59,720
metacritic score of all the game of the year nominees you definitely hit the nail on the head

1521
02:23:59,720 --> 02:24:05,880
about the ongoing game category though it was a big shock that overwatch wasn't nominated as it

1522
02:24:05,880 --> 02:24:11,560
had been for the last two years and it won the category in 2017 i think final fantasy 14 has

1523
02:24:11,560 --> 02:24:18,040
shot over fortnite fortnite already won last year and again fan vote doesn't really mean anything

1524
02:24:18,040 --> 02:24:24,600
i was a little surprised that blitzchung didn't uh get a nomination for best esports player i

1525
02:24:24,600 --> 02:24:29,000
thought that would have been interesting but i don't really know how he did outside of the

1526
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:34,280
tournament he won where he spoke out and got suspended have a great rest of your stream

1527
02:24:34,280 --> 02:24:40,200
flaco jones um very good points yeah i'll let you read that in a sec um i just want to say you know

1528
02:24:40,200 --> 02:24:46,440
oops we got it wrong sorry last week so um thanks for correcting how that all is um judged he makes

1529
02:24:46,440 --> 02:24:52,120
a really great analogy in the next email but i wanted to quickly say on um control and metacritic

1530
02:24:52,120 --> 02:24:56,200
and all that and you mentioned that final fantasy 14 has a shot um since we just talked about

1531
02:24:56,200 --> 02:25:00,680
metacritic earlier in the show it does seem like the barometer may be tilting in final fantasy 14's

1532
02:25:00,680 --> 02:25:04,840
favor so uh the blitzchung thing though i mean there was a part of me that was like well what

1533
02:25:04,840 --> 02:25:10,120
was the deadline for this maybe but i i would have thought nah i'm sure this that whole incident

1534
02:25:10,120 --> 02:25:16,200
could have happened before the deadline so um who knows why that didn't end up happening perhaps

1535
02:25:16,200 --> 02:25:21,960
um they were nervous about putting that in the spotlight i don't know anyway um let's hear the

1536
02:25:21,960 --> 02:25:26,920
other email though because he makes a great comparison in this email second email because

1537
02:25:26,920 --> 02:25:31,640
i forgot to mention one point i wanted to make about the game awards personally i find them to

1538
02:25:31,640 --> 02:25:36,120
be more like the golden globes of the game industry since the winners are determined by a global jury

1539
02:25:36,120 --> 02:25:42,680
of media and not game makers themselves i put more stock in who wins at the dice awards in february

1540
02:25:42,680 --> 02:25:47,400
which are actually voted on by peers who work in game development and publishing a lot more like

1541
02:25:47,400 --> 02:25:51,880
the oscars if we're still comparing it to movie awards but since they come out later and don't

1542
02:25:51,880 --> 02:25:57,560
have the media outlets attached they don't usually get as much buzz okay that's it for the award

1543
02:25:57,560 --> 02:26:02,920
emails flaco jones i just wanted to call out what a great comparison that is when many people are

1544
02:26:02,920 --> 02:26:08,520
saying that the game awards should be the oscars of gaming in a way um very interesting to call

1545
02:26:08,520 --> 02:26:13,960
out but the way they're voted on oscars are voted on by industry peers and people that are you know

1546
02:26:13,960 --> 02:26:19,720
within the film industry and so forth so really it's the dice awards that are kind of the barometer

1547
02:26:19,720 --> 02:26:27,240
there whereas the way this is voted on by media worldwide that is how the golden globes are voted

1548
02:26:27,240 --> 02:26:31,880
on it so the golden globes doesn't have the fan part of it but i mean still the comparison i think

1549
02:26:31,880 --> 02:26:37,480
is is pretty good what you're getting at there um and golden globes was always supposed to be the

1550
02:26:37,480 --> 02:26:43,320
more informal one the more party atmosphere right um the golden globes used to be the laughing stock

1551
02:26:43,320 --> 02:26:47,000
of the film industry like people didn't even want to be seen there but they really kind of

1552
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:51,560
started turning it around what was it probably like the 90s the late 80s or the 90s i think a

1553
02:26:51,560 --> 02:26:56,440
lot of people with the golden globes probably remember one of the first big things that

1554
02:26:56,440 --> 02:27:02,520
contributed to that party atmosphere of the golden globes was when christine lottie won that award

1555
02:27:02,520 --> 02:27:08,040
for whatever tv show she was on at the time but she was in the bathroom so robin williams jumped

1556
02:27:08,040 --> 02:27:13,560
on stage and just started doing this improv live and was like paging christine lottie and stuff

1557
02:27:13,560 --> 02:27:17,480
and it was this really funny because you know robin williams could pull comedy out of his butt

1558
02:27:17,480 --> 02:27:22,520
and it was hilarious right he was great in that regard um and i think that really made a lot more

1559
02:27:22,520 --> 02:27:27,320
people start paying attention to the golden globes being like the party one and then they then the

1560
02:27:27,320 --> 02:27:31,640
golden globes kind of billed itself as that and they had ricky jervais host those few years and

1561
02:27:31,640 --> 02:27:37,000
they they loved him for a while because he was so unpredictable and so forth that was the one that

1562
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:40,920
tina fey and amy polar hosted which i don't know why they don't do it every year they prob they

1563
02:27:40,920 --> 02:27:44,280
probably turned it down because they have other projects they want to do but they're hilarious

1564
02:27:44,280 --> 02:27:48,840
and so forth so you know especially because the game awards i think are definitely the showier

1565
02:27:48,840 --> 02:27:54,840
show whereas the dice awards are more the you know industry thing but we just don't really see the

1566
02:27:54,840 --> 02:28:01,320
dice awards they don't televise that so it doesn't feel as oscary and so forth so i'm glad they don't

1567
02:28:01,320 --> 02:28:07,640
have celebrity hosts doing it because like i know like several years like different not necessarily

1568
02:28:07,640 --> 02:28:16,520
award shows but like presenters joel mchale or even uh uh conan o'brien it has to not it has to

1569
02:28:16,520 --> 02:28:22,200
be the right presenter like for example i consider aisha tyler a celebrity presenter but like she

1570
02:28:22,200 --> 02:28:27,960
knows her shit because she plays halo and shit in her downtime like she she knew her games you know

1571
02:28:27,960 --> 02:28:33,160
she was an authentic voice in the celebrities i think i say was because i haven't seen her

1572
02:28:33,160 --> 02:28:39,160
do anything in gaming in a while but you know when she would talk about gear is a war on her

1573
02:28:39,160 --> 02:28:42,200
show or whatever because she was on the talk for a while i don't think i don't know if she ever

1574
02:28:42,200 --> 02:28:45,640
brought it up there but it's like she she knew what she was talking about she was being told

1575
02:28:45,640 --> 02:28:50,680
let's say she knew what she was talking about yeah you know and even though conan o'brien makes it

1576
02:28:50,680 --> 02:28:56,520
funny i still feel like he kind of really does play games but it's it's he his job is to not

1577
02:28:56,520 --> 02:29:02,200
make it serious um i still don't think he's funny uh well jimmy fallon then we'll go with that

1578
02:29:02,200 --> 02:29:08,360
because he's brought more video game exposure to the tonight show which is always kind of like

1579
02:29:08,360 --> 02:29:12,680
i mean you want to talk about okay boomer the tonight show is always that show that you kind

1580
02:29:12,680 --> 02:29:17,560
of associate with like a much different generation jimmy fallon love him or hate him has kind of had

1581
02:29:17,560 --> 02:29:23,000
this responsibility to try to make this show more accessible to a wider audience because let's be

1582
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:27,640
real jay leno never did that and when conan o'brien swung that pendulum too hard in the

1583
02:29:27,640 --> 02:29:32,680
other direction he lost his show in seven months so jimmy fallon's been in this very hard place

1584
02:29:32,680 --> 02:29:36,520
where he's kind of had to walk the line and make a show that's accessible to the legacy of the

1585
02:29:36,520 --> 02:29:43,400
tonight show but also one that is going to live on you know with newer generations and he's done that

1586
02:29:43,400 --> 02:29:51,320
in part by having um oh what's her name captain marvel playing uh beat saber brie larson thank

1587
02:29:51,320 --> 02:29:56,120
you brie larson playing beat saber was it was it her i was somebody that one of one of the marvel

1588
02:29:56,120 --> 02:30:00,520
girls was playing beat saber with her on uh with him and you know he was one of the first to show

1589
02:30:00,520 --> 02:30:08,760
the switch that that gif or gif whatever you want to say of of um um oh my god miyamoto in the

1590
02:30:08,760 --> 02:30:13,080
audience where he does that whole like thumbs up thing that whole gift of him out there that was

1591
02:30:13,080 --> 02:30:16,760
from the tonight show you know so anyway i'm sorry i don't remember where i was going with

1592
02:30:16,760 --> 02:30:21,080
this but i was just kind of pointing out like you know oh media and having to embrace games

1593
02:30:21,080 --> 02:30:26,680
and celebrities and that whole sort of thing so um swang tong says whatever happened to conan

1594
02:30:26,680 --> 02:30:31,880
he's been on tbs this whole time yeah um i and they he doesn't need to pull in the same type of

1595
02:30:31,880 --> 02:30:36,680
numbers on well nowadays like it's i don't know how well these like late shows are really doing

1596
02:30:36,680 --> 02:30:43,640
because most people watch consume these through clips on youtube that's how i do it i mean i

1597
02:30:43,640 --> 02:30:49,320
don't watch like i don't watch uh any of these guys but i'll just watch the clips i don't think

1598
02:30:49,320 --> 02:30:54,440
i would ever watch one of these late night live shows i used to back in the day i i remember

1599
02:30:54,440 --> 02:30:59,320
watching johnny carson in my bedroom okay like i'm dating myself i know that towards the end of his

1600
02:30:59,320 --> 02:31:03,640
run and i was probably 10 or 11. i used to watch the reruns of conan o'brien though like when they

1601
02:31:03,640 --> 02:31:08,040
would rerun them during the day we used to gather up in the dorm room and watch late night with conan

1602
02:31:08,040 --> 02:31:14,840
o'brien like yeah he was like his target audience i think i i love well i saw him live i went to his

1603
02:31:14,840 --> 02:31:19,960
live tour and it was fantastic the one here in sac i did san francisco yes and i loved it it

1604
02:31:19,960 --> 02:31:23,160
was great yeah i thought it was funny i had a great time but i have to admit i haven't been

1605
02:31:23,160 --> 02:31:27,160
following the tbs show as much because i just don't watch a lot of late night stuff and you're

1606
02:31:27,160 --> 02:31:31,640
right it's all consumed in bits and honestly you know who you know who i see more than anybody else

1607
02:31:31,640 --> 02:31:35,160
like the youtubes i see more than anybody else that i probably watch more than anybody else

1608
02:31:35,160 --> 02:31:39,720
jimmy kimmel and i would have never thought that would be the case because jimmy kimmel reminds me

1609
02:31:39,720 --> 02:31:45,320
of the man show which was fucking ridiculous but his late night show he's got a lot of good viral

1610
02:31:45,320 --> 02:31:50,120
clips i usually watch uh late night with seth meyers or uh i'll watch the clips also of um

1611
02:31:51,960 --> 02:31:58,840
uh steven colbert i like samantha b and john oliver yeah john oliver i'll use watch that

1612
02:32:00,040 --> 02:32:06,360
like good like thinky stuff um i i what i want to say about um jimmy kimmel oh i think the best

1613
02:32:06,360 --> 02:32:12,680
clip that i saw him do was when he manufactured that viral clip of like the girl twerking on the

1614
02:32:12,680 --> 02:32:16,920
door and then the door opens and it falls over and they show that went that was a legit thing

1615
02:32:16,920 --> 02:32:21,560
that they put on youtube it went viral and then on his show they revealed that when the door opens

1616
02:32:21,560 --> 02:32:25,560
it's jimmy kimmel on the other side of the door and like he kind of showed like we made this clip

1617
02:32:25,560 --> 02:32:30,680
go viral and this is how we did it and i just thought it was very interesting so anyway and

1618
02:32:30,680 --> 02:32:35,640
then they brought on the girl that was twerking it was like a stunt stunt woman or something from

1619
02:32:35,640 --> 02:32:40,920
motion pictures so anyway i just thought it was interesting so um and bobby does point out the

1620
02:32:40,920 --> 02:32:44,760
good thing about oliver and b is that they're weekly and not nightly and you do see a lot of

1621
02:32:44,760 --> 02:32:51,960
shows kind of going that way as a result i used to love the daily show but i don't the clips that

1622
02:32:51,960 --> 02:32:55,720
aren't as great as they used to be i don't know if i just don't care for the new guy as much as

1623
02:32:55,720 --> 02:33:00,920
you know john stewart or what it is i don't know i used to love letterman back in the day i think

1624
02:33:00,920 --> 02:33:06,920
when letterman first took over at cbs that was like the heyday of late night television anyway

1625
02:33:07,560 --> 02:33:12,440
because i always thought leno was lame i never cared for him leno is a shithole but he has a

1626
02:33:12,440 --> 02:33:20,680
great car collection he had and he has a die-hard fan base of sorts i don't i don't get it anyway

1627
02:33:20,680 --> 02:33:26,440
he's just not a good person i think i don't think he's funny at all like anyway anyway it's not about

1628
02:33:26,440 --> 02:33:30,520
late night i don't think he's funny in the same way i don't think that rodney dangerfield was

1629
02:33:30,520 --> 02:33:39,000
funny that whole well i'm an asshole what are you gonna do but yeah like but bianca del rio

1630
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:43,560
does that same shtick and it's funny yeah but bianca del rio is actually smart yeah i guess

1631
02:33:43,560 --> 02:33:48,120
that's true all right anyway let's move on and joan rivers did a lot of that same shtick but she's

1632
02:33:48,120 --> 02:33:54,280
smart she was a genius right all right let's move on um and full of preservatives let's talk about

1633
02:33:54,280 --> 02:33:59,720
more stadia news i talked about stadia earlier in the show yes so stadia pro they have that

1634
02:33:59,720 --> 02:34:05,240
subscription service which they're supposed to be giving new games uh each month and you know we

1635
02:34:05,240 --> 02:34:09,960
talked about last month how the only game that's really free right now is stadia probe was destiny

1636
02:34:09,960 --> 02:34:15,560
2 well that's actually going to change because now they've added a few more games for december that

1637
02:34:15,560 --> 02:34:21,640
are going to be available as well so um those being tomb raider and farming simulator 19

1638
02:34:22,200 --> 02:34:30,280
which um are available but apparently though anybody that bought those games now will actually

1639
02:34:30,280 --> 02:34:36,280
be getting a discount because they okay i'm sorry they're not free i guess you get a discount on

1640
02:34:36,280 --> 02:34:42,440
those um no they are free so they're giving you i guess a discount of 10 on tomb raider and 50 on

1641
02:34:42,440 --> 02:34:48,920
farming simulator 19 which i'm assuming is just the list price for those uh but yeah so those i

1642
02:34:48,920 --> 02:34:54,360
guess are finally live and i guess that i i don't know they need to do a better job of actually

1643
02:34:54,360 --> 02:35:00,520
communicating which games are free with stadia pro each month i guess they do have it now where

1644
02:35:00,520 --> 02:35:05,480
they're showing you know the december and i guess oh samurai showed that was another one that was

1645
02:35:05,480 --> 02:35:09,960
free as well chat was correct you on that but yeah sorry they added simmer i forgot the samurai

1646
02:35:09,960 --> 02:35:13,720
showing out like the last minute it was in there yeah but like you know it'd be nice to know like

1647
02:35:13,720 --> 02:35:20,120
what um like say for example january is going to be and stuff like that just i mean i get it like

1648
02:35:20,120 --> 02:35:28,280
it you don't really do that necessarily with um you like the playstation plus stuff in that but

1649
02:35:28,920 --> 02:35:33,240
if you're paying for stadia pro i mean there's such a small library right now that you would

1650
02:35:33,240 --> 02:35:38,760
think that they would kind of say hey oh shit i didn't even okay so here's the fun this is why i

1651
02:35:38,760 --> 02:35:43,400
said oh shit so i was actually bringing up the stadia app so loki could kind of see this firsthand

1652
02:35:43,400 --> 02:35:47,160
what it looks like in the app that they do actually have a section that says stadia pro

1653
02:35:47,160 --> 02:35:52,120
games is right there so and these are the ones that are all free and why i went oh shit is

1654
02:35:52,120 --> 02:35:56,280
because tomb raider and farming simulator are already there they went apparently they went

1655
02:35:56,280 --> 02:36:01,080
free today yeah because it's december i i well yeah but you know like playstation plus games

1656
02:36:01,080 --> 02:36:05,400
aren't live until like the first thursday in december it's not always december 1st so i just

1657
02:36:05,400 --> 02:36:10,120
oh shitted because i'm like oh tomb raider and farming simulator farming simulator fuck yes

1658
02:36:11,080 --> 02:36:16,680
you know actually i will say that euro truck simulator and those those games are actually

1659
02:36:16,680 --> 02:36:23,560
like in a zen sort of way like really relaxing and fun so i'll try for free free well yeah free

1660
02:36:23,560 --> 02:36:28,840
because bobby gave me his buddy pass thanks bobby i can't murder me anybody in those games i'm not

1661
02:36:28,840 --> 02:36:33,400
really necessarily so i'm sorry i guess well you can murder him in tomb raider i was gonna say i

1662
02:36:33,400 --> 02:36:39,560
had to leave all my murdering to me him yes to uh tomb raider so neat neat i had no idea um that

1663
02:36:39,560 --> 02:36:44,760
those games were um actually out so i'm good to know i'll be checking that out a little later on

1664
02:36:44,760 --> 02:36:51,320
i wish i could stream it but obviously you see the problem i can't stream while i'm streaming

1665
02:36:51,320 --> 02:36:56,920
i guess i could but it would affect the quality of both one or the other uh but i could record it

1666
02:36:56,920 --> 02:37:02,680
and i've thought about doing this would you guys even care what if i recorded like a long play and

1667
02:37:02,680 --> 02:37:07,960
just debuted it on twitch during the day um on a random night when there's no live vog programming

1668
02:37:07,960 --> 02:37:10,280
what would you think would you would you care about that or would you just be like eh

1669
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:17,800
kind of a question for you guys because or they may think i go where i want to go rob's gonna be

1670
02:37:17,800 --> 02:37:22,760
like all wolf which is fine but i'm just curious like if i were to record stadia stuff and they're

1671
02:37:22,760 --> 02:37:29,800
gonna be like this isn't a pinball game do i have to play pinball no because you you accidentally

1672
02:37:29,800 --> 02:37:37,800
broadcast your footage from the b-roll oh shut up all right moving on uh let's talk about this

1673
02:37:37,800 --> 02:37:41,400
i just thought this was you know it's a bit of a slower news week so i thought this was like oh

1674
02:37:41,400 --> 02:37:48,600
interesting um and this has to do with minecraft um and it has to do with the vatican um so we have

1675
02:37:48,600 --> 02:37:54,280
a news article about a priest that is going to be launching a vatican minecraft server

1676
02:37:54,280 --> 02:38:03,320
um and so it's fr what's fr short for for france france friends god damn it what are the france

1677
02:38:03,320 --> 02:38:09,160
no it's the title in the church oh not deacon not pope not what's fr

1678
02:38:10,600 --> 02:38:16,200
father father oh that's our friar that's way too easier than father's father probably works

1679
02:38:16,200 --> 02:38:23,240
well you're you're saying this to the the nun i know father robert balacer um who is a jesuit

1680
02:38:23,240 --> 02:38:28,280
priest who studied engineering in silicon valley is wanting to introduce the vatican's minecraft

1681
02:38:28,280 --> 02:38:33,560
server as a place where players can express themselves in a environment that is not as toxic

1682
02:38:33,560 --> 02:38:37,960
as maybe other things that you're running out to out there so like i guess if you will a safe space

1683
02:38:37,960 --> 02:38:42,200
um then you may find in other games oh pot culture points out he's from this week in tech i didn't

1684
02:38:42,200 --> 02:38:48,280
know that okay so this guy's kind of involved with tech stuff before so the project started on

1685
02:38:48,280 --> 02:38:53,560
twitter and he polled the followers on what game do you want to do a test server rust arc team

1686
02:38:53,560 --> 02:38:58,360
fortress 2 or minecraft and 64 of the votes went to minecraft yeah i don't know if russ didn't

1687
02:38:58,360 --> 02:39:04,840
necessarily be the uh the best choice for don't don't you hang dong in that game so like i don't

1688
02:39:04,840 --> 02:39:11,000
know if that's he took a vote of sorts so anyway uh father robert balacer uh says in a quote rome

1689
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:15,480
reports uh it's not about the technology it's not even really about the gaming it's about getting

1690
02:39:15,480 --> 02:39:20,680
people together who can then maybe move those relationships to the real world at first there

1691
02:39:20,680 --> 02:39:25,240
were a lot of people who were very hesitant because you see this guy in a collar talking

1692
02:39:25,240 --> 02:39:30,520
about the latest offerings from google or how you run fiber optics across the atlantic and they

1693
02:39:30,520 --> 02:39:35,080
didn't understand they said wait a minute these two things don't go together but after a time they

1694
02:39:35,080 --> 02:39:39,400
realized okay he knows what he's talking about he just happens to be a priest and ultimately that

1695
02:39:39,400 --> 02:39:44,680
was the ministry i was trying to do you know despite however you might feel about the church

1696
02:39:44,680 --> 02:39:49,320
organized religion and that sort of thing i you have to admire what this guy's trying to do

1697
02:39:50,040 --> 02:39:55,320
this is smart this and it's it's funny because we were just talking about like late night and having

1698
02:39:55,320 --> 02:40:00,600
to bridge the generations and when i i don't know about you guys when i think about the vatican i

1699
02:40:00,600 --> 02:40:05,240
think about the pope i think about a lot of these fathers these people you know who i think about

1700
02:40:05,240 --> 02:40:10,680
fucking old people really old people well right and and i and i think what he's doing is a great

1701
02:40:10,680 --> 02:40:16,600
thing i'm just worried that this is going to be a beacon for like trolls it's just like hey let's

1702
02:40:16,600 --> 02:40:22,040
this this is a good place to focus our energy like and yeah you know i think they can accomplish it

1703
02:40:22,040 --> 02:40:27,240
it's just it's gonna take a whole hell a lot of moderation if he's done this work with this week

1704
02:40:27,240 --> 02:40:33,880
in tech and worked in silicon valley before i think he well knows about that and the way i've

1705
02:40:33,880 --> 02:40:39,880
kind of seen this approached before is that you know usually if trolls come in um you pray for

1706
02:40:39,880 --> 02:40:44,360
them you you try to reach out through prayer and that sort of thing you know again i'm not i'm not

1707
02:40:44,360 --> 02:40:48,520
gonna speak on behalf of the church i'm not trying to say this but i'm just kind of in my experience

1708
02:40:48,520 --> 02:40:56,360
of watching this you know you try to still build a bridge even if somebody is a troll um they still

1709
02:40:56,360 --> 02:41:00,440
took a minute to walk into your church so to speak so what are you gonna do you're gonna preach at

1710
02:41:00,440 --> 02:41:05,320
him right so he may still be trying to build a bridge maybe again i don't speak for this guy

1711
02:41:05,320 --> 02:41:09,400
but i'm thinking he may be trying to build a bridge with trolls and so forth as well

1712
02:41:09,960 --> 02:41:15,080
um so who knows anyway i just thought you know honestly it's funny because i was reminded of

1713
02:41:15,080 --> 02:41:22,360
the movie sister act and what's one of the key plot points in sister act you have the old school

1714
02:41:22,360 --> 02:41:28,520
versus the new school right you have maggie smith playing you know the the mother mother hand or

1715
02:41:28,520 --> 02:41:33,880
whatever or mother superior right of the of the um nuns and she wants to do things very old school

1716
02:41:33,880 --> 02:41:38,600
she wants everything to be traditional she wants everything to be very you know by the book i

1717
02:41:38,600 --> 02:41:43,000
became a nun so i could live this particular life and then when whoopi goldberg comes in because

1718
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:49,240
she's being hidden there by the cops she has this whole different approach to it where she's she

1719
02:41:49,240 --> 02:41:54,280
brings her lounge club experience into it where she's like we could put some butts in these seats

1720
02:41:54,280 --> 02:41:59,560
if we were to actually like modernize what we're doing and at the end of the day the priest in a

1721
02:41:59,560 --> 02:42:05,160
way or the the deacon of the church or whatever kind of sides with whoopi's character whereas

1722
02:42:05,160 --> 02:42:12,200
he's still trying to um be respectful to the history and what's happening by trying to um you

1723
02:42:12,200 --> 02:42:16,520
know be respectful of maggie smith's character so yes i just took a gaming story and compared it to

1724
02:42:16,520 --> 02:42:21,640
sister act but god damn it it works because the plot of that movie was about how they were

1725
02:42:21,640 --> 02:42:28,600
reaching out and making more people um interested in faith and religion by making it accessible

1726
02:42:28,600 --> 02:42:33,800
yeah and doggone it that's what this guy's trying to do in a way so you know again say what you want

1727
02:42:33,800 --> 02:42:40,920
to say about organized religion and all that but i i have to admire this guy's approach this guy

1728
02:42:40,920 --> 02:42:50,840
gets it in i think a way that a lot of his peers in the church don't so props to you dude best of

1729
02:42:50,840 --> 02:42:56,040
luck i hope it works out for you i think we all want to create a space sometimes for like-minded

1730
02:42:56,040 --> 02:43:03,080
individuals and sometimes that might be like a lgbtq plus and so forth safe space that might be

1731
02:43:03,080 --> 02:43:07,720
a place to talk about religion and so forth you know and as long as you're not kicking other

1732
02:43:07,720 --> 02:43:16,760
people down while you do it go for it so anyway bobby blackwolf and chat now that's funny bobby

1733
02:43:16,760 --> 02:43:21,400
blackwolf and chat with an excellent like troll ish but genuinely funny comment that says is he

1734
02:43:21,400 --> 02:43:28,840
building the bridge with wood or cobblestone minecraft this is about minecraft minecraft joke

1735
02:43:28,840 --> 02:43:35,000
cobblestone it's much more readily available all right let's take the conversation back to satan

1736
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:42,520
uh dark sakura you have a story about a scary thing right me i made might have been scary um

1737
02:43:42,520 --> 02:43:50,600
so there is a uh a series of tweets that were going out trying to get the uh writer and producer

1738
02:43:50,600 --> 02:43:57,000
alana pierce to ask just basically deliver anything about silent hills that's a quote

1739
02:43:57,640 --> 02:44:04,760
that we didn't already know now that it's you know never coming out and so um the post reply

1740
02:44:04,760 --> 02:44:09,480
was i heard that silent hills would require you to sign a waiver before playing because it would

1741
02:44:09,480 --> 02:44:14,760
somehow interact with your real world self like by sending you emails or text messages as characters

1742
02:44:14,760 --> 02:44:23,720
from the game even when you weren't actively playing that is nuts can you imagine and that's

1743
02:44:23,720 --> 02:44:29,880
totally doable in this you know if all you have to do is give that game facebook access

1744
02:44:29,880 --> 02:44:33,880
and it'll pull from your facebook it can pull your phone number and your email and this type

1745
02:44:33,880 --> 02:44:37,240
of stuff and there's going to be people that blindly hit the button and do that

1746
02:44:37,240 --> 02:44:44,760
like remember remember hadeo kachima made that game metal gear solid that did something really

1747
02:44:44,760 --> 02:44:51,880
like psycho twisted when it would read your memory card i see you're a fan of konami games

1748
02:44:51,880 --> 02:44:58,040
exactly and it would like actually it mentioned games like that hadn't come out yet so or just

1749
02:44:58,040 --> 02:45:01,560
you know it would read like sweet koden you have a sense of adventure or things like that like

1750
02:45:01,560 --> 02:45:06,840
you would read the save files that were on your ps1 card sweet koden wasn't out yet yeah something

1751
02:45:06,840 --> 02:45:10,680
and so if you played it after sweet koden came out and it read the save file for it and then

1752
02:45:10,680 --> 02:45:13,800
get your comment but yeah they had a couple games on there that hadn't been out yet yeah

1753
02:45:14,440 --> 02:45:20,520
so uh just i mean so the fact that hadeo kajima potentially if this is to be believed

1754
02:45:20,520 --> 02:45:25,880
kind of was taking that to the next level with like what else do i inadvertently have access to

1755
02:45:25,880 --> 02:45:29,880
in this day and age that i could really scare the shit out of someone with like can you imagine

1756
02:45:30,440 --> 02:45:34,120
you are done with this game like you had to turn the game off because you were too scared

1757
02:45:34,120 --> 02:45:38,040
and then one of the you you fucking get a text message on your phone that pretends to be one

1758
02:45:38,040 --> 02:45:44,600
of the characters in the game i would die like that is that is that's awesome though that is

1759
02:45:44,600 --> 02:45:49,640
like wow what would you think if you were suddenly being texted and harassed by characters

1760
02:45:49,880 --> 02:46:00,120
bitch i'm at work do not disturb that would be me or just reply stop yeah which if you get marketing

1761
02:46:00,120 --> 02:46:05,640
text messages you can reply stop to get removed from them just letting y'all know yeah but the

1762
02:46:05,640 --> 02:46:11,080
the thing is is that you know we know we know kojima is looking to do another as as he says

1763
02:46:11,080 --> 02:46:17,800
the scariest horror game so maybe we're gonna eventually get at least a spiritual sequel to

1764
02:46:17,880 --> 02:46:25,400
the silent hill franchise i think maybe it'll be called like like uh quiet mountain it's just

1765
02:46:25,400 --> 02:46:30,120
it's gonna take all the ideas he had for silent hills and just put them in a new universe i'm sure

1766
02:46:30,120 --> 02:46:35,000
and nova has norman reading it read us in it maybe and his butt if he's available in his butt

1767
02:46:36,440 --> 02:46:40,040
i wonder if he's got a nice butt i wonder if he'll still team up with guillermo del toro

1768
02:46:40,040 --> 02:46:46,120
wow i i want this and i want it to have the fish man in it yeah i just people do need to

1769
02:46:46,120 --> 02:46:54,040
let the silent shape of water i mean honestly if konami wanted to earn a lot of points i don't

1770
02:46:54,040 --> 02:46:59,800
ever see them doing this but i'm just gonna say it they could just let him have the franchise

1771
02:46:59,800 --> 02:47:03,720
and i realize there's been a lot of bad blood between him and konami but a few years has been

1772
02:47:03,720 --> 02:47:07,960
a shit to a few years have passed at this point and konami you notice has been slowly trying to

1773
02:47:07,960 --> 02:47:12,120
turn the wheel in a new direction and get some positive press and i would say if konami wanted

1774
02:47:12,120 --> 02:47:17,880
to get some real positive press then all they would need to do is just say hey look you can

1775
02:47:17,880 --> 02:47:23,320
make you we will license the silent hill to you for a five percent cut a ten percent cut or

1776
02:47:23,320 --> 02:47:27,720
whatever and you can make the game you wanted to make or whatever i think would get a lot of stock

1777
02:47:27,720 --> 02:47:31,560
back in konami but that's to say if kojima even wanted to do it because kojima would have a right

1778
02:47:31,560 --> 02:47:36,440
to say no fuck them and you know make his own thing that had many of the same ideas and that's

1779
02:47:36,440 --> 02:47:41,720
that's he has the right to do that there's a really good video about pt and about the things

1780
02:47:41,720 --> 02:47:47,720
that he was putting references to that when the nda got lifted that make a lot of sense like

1781
02:47:47,720 --> 02:47:52,840
certain numbers that you would see in there or like the commentary of the fetus in the in the

1782
02:47:52,840 --> 02:47:59,320
sink how it was talking about something it goes back to how konami was treating him and you know

1783
02:47:59,320 --> 02:48:03,160
getting pushed out of his positions and whatnot it was a very interesting theory interesting that

1784
02:48:03,160 --> 02:48:09,800
the talking baby was a common theme between those two things baby doesn't talk oh i guess

1785
02:48:10,760 --> 02:48:15,320
he doesn't he doesn't talk does he okay there are all kinds of ghost babies

1786
02:48:16,680 --> 02:48:20,600
all right well moving on just a few more stories for you guys then we'll quickly check in on

1787
02:48:20,600 --> 02:48:26,200
discord and see if anybody wants to call in for tonight um over at uh uh vog network dot com slash

1788
02:48:26,200 --> 02:48:31,400
discord in our green room so there was a rom hack for fire emblem called midnight sun that was in

1789
02:48:31,400 --> 02:48:37,960
development but then canceled uh back in 2017 uh but now the folks that were behind that

1790
02:48:38,440 --> 02:48:45,400
have a new game called path of the midnight sun and it's kind of a spiritual successor to that

1791
02:48:45,400 --> 02:48:52,120
it's now more of like a visual novel but it also has some tactical combat like fire emblem in there

1792
02:48:52,120 --> 02:48:58,440
and they even have some of the same voice actors from the fire emblem series and even pokemon

1793
02:48:58,440 --> 02:49:04,120
that are lending their uh talents to the game itself and if that sounds like something that

1794
02:49:04,120 --> 02:49:08,840
you might be interested in well they have it up on kickstarter now and it's supposed to be

1795
02:49:08,840 --> 02:49:15,400
out by the end of next year on pc mac and the switch so you can go check that out path of the

1796
02:49:15,400 --> 02:49:25,560
midnight sun and it looks interesting definitely um it reminds me a little bit of fire emblem just

1797
02:49:25,560 --> 02:49:31,720
based on the animation and everything but that's always fascinating when um like a mod it kind of

1798
02:49:31,720 --> 02:49:36,440
spins off and becomes its own game because this isn't the first time this has happened hello dota

1799
02:49:36,440 --> 02:49:41,800
right why is there why is there no dota 1 there's only dota 2 because dota 1 was a warcraft 3 mod

1800
02:49:41,800 --> 02:49:47,000
so you know mods do spin off and become games sometimes it's uh and that's that's not all uh

1801
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:51,560
team fortress was originally a quake mod you know a lot of that valve stuff you know they acquired

1802
02:49:51,560 --> 02:49:57,080
big modders and then helped them make their own games so it's kind of neat yep yeah all right

1803
02:49:57,080 --> 02:50:00,120
i'll have to check that out at some point even though i'm not really super into the tactical

1804
02:50:00,200 --> 02:50:07,080
rpgs but i think it's kind of a neat neat thing anyway um i'm sure a lot of you guys have been

1805
02:50:07,080 --> 02:50:12,600
following what's going on in other news and the announcement of the cyber truck did you guys see

1806
02:50:12,600 --> 02:50:18,280
the uh unveiling from elon musk of the cyber truck uh with the the shatterproof windows and all that

1807
02:50:18,280 --> 02:50:24,200
stuff anyway uh a lot of people commented that wow the cyber truck looks like something i would

1808
02:50:24,200 --> 02:50:30,040
have seen like in a 90s uh virtual racing type of game like a low polygon type of game

1809
02:50:30,040 --> 02:50:34,840
and now guess what's happening that car is being hacked into many different video games

1810
02:50:34,840 --> 02:50:40,760
including it's so hard to to recreate the model of the truck golden eye 007 is one of the more

1811
02:50:40,760 --> 02:50:46,280
prominent ones out there where you can actually uh have a mod you know for your golden eye game

1812
02:50:46,280 --> 02:50:50,600
that will put the cyber truck into the game which let's be real that truck does kind of look like

1813
02:50:50,600 --> 02:50:56,200
something out of a james bond film so this one makes the most sense so yeah it does kind of look

1814
02:50:56,200 --> 02:51:01,880
like a um stunt fx or what was hard driving hard driving car from hard drive well i thought you

1815
02:51:01,880 --> 02:51:08,120
know when um yeah when uh jamie was talking about virtual racing i'm like yeah i can see that yeah

1816
02:51:08,120 --> 02:51:14,120
for sure so that's cute that that truck has been hacked into everything and that's uh that's the

1817
02:51:14,120 --> 02:51:19,720
type of thing that modders do for the lulz so there you go all right um we are going to make

1818
02:51:19,720 --> 02:51:25,800
our way to discord so we can try to grab some calls tonight so let's see if we can actually

1819
02:51:25,800 --> 02:51:29,720
uh get that call here because we do have somebody waiting hello you're on orange launch radio who's

1821
02:51:36,440 --> 02:51:41,880
friday shopping weekend to you i'm sure you are uh having a great time of it did you know that

1822
02:51:41,880 --> 02:51:48,680
that's also the name of a pinball heavy metal mayhem oh no i wasn't aware of that i thought

1823
02:51:48,680 --> 02:51:52,280
for a second there she was talking about black friday shopping weekend i thought i was like

1824
02:51:52,280 --> 02:51:56,280
there's a black friday pinball machine what i know black hole all right anyway what's that what's on

1825
02:51:56,280 --> 02:52:03,400
your mind tonight buddy oh since you brought it up idly enough it's more or less the topic of my

1826
02:52:03,400 --> 02:52:14,920
you know you know a call in a very broad sense um now um since it's um you know black parties

1827
02:52:14,920 --> 02:52:20,840
you know cyber monday weekend and everyone's on buying guests either from themselves or for

1828
02:52:20,840 --> 02:52:27,880
others or what have you i would like to ask you this um not just during this weekend but

1829
02:52:27,880 --> 02:52:36,600
over the course of 2019 have you bought you know defeat any of you uh but uh bought some

1830
02:52:36,600 --> 02:52:44,040
games for yourselves or for others you know you know during a major sale you know did you

1831
02:52:44,040 --> 02:52:49,560
particularly love they're getting out the game doesn't necessarily have to have to have been uh

1832
02:52:50,360 --> 02:52:57,640
released this year just hit had to be on make uh available during uh during a sale and sure

1833
02:52:57,640 --> 02:53:02,200
sure i get what you're doing with that um what do you guys think is there uh a game that you've

1834
02:53:02,200 --> 02:53:10,040
bought in a sale this year um that you particularly enjoyed and and thought was a good deal um i did

1835
02:53:10,040 --> 02:53:13,480
say i didn't get death stranding on sale i was hoping it would go on sale this weekend but it

1836
02:53:13,480 --> 02:53:20,040
never did i did buy a music sequencer program on steam um because i was watching some how-to videos

1837
02:53:20,040 --> 02:53:26,280
on youtube and it looked pretty um relatively easy to use um and i was i liked that it made chiptune

1838
02:53:26,280 --> 02:53:30,760
songs and things of that nature so i thought it was relatively cheap it was probably like 14 bucks

1839
02:53:30,760 --> 02:53:35,080
for the program and the suit and i'm sorry i forget the name in the moment um if i i haven't

1840
02:53:35,080 --> 02:53:41,240
made anything with it yet so if i do i will let you know what it was called um but um yeah i

1841
02:53:41,320 --> 02:53:43,960
thought that would be fun to toy around with because you know i've been looking for some

1842
02:53:43,960 --> 02:53:49,080
new musical interludes here at olr and um i know jamie has a lead as well but maybe we want to have

1843
02:53:49,880 --> 02:53:53,640
other musical interludes as well so it depends on how difficult it is to use

1844
02:53:53,640 --> 02:53:59,160
um i used to do music stuff many many many many many years ago i don't exactly have a resume i

1845
02:53:59,160 --> 02:54:03,880
was in marching band so i can read sheet music but that's about you know the extent of it but

1846
02:54:03,880 --> 02:54:09,960
um yeah i'll be curious to tinker around with it and see what i can do so um that was one thing

1847
02:54:09,960 --> 02:54:14,680
i picked up this weekend as far as like all year in a sale or anything like that oh i remember i

1848
02:54:14,680 --> 02:54:19,400
know i'll say horizon zero dawn um i picked that up a couple months ago they were having a pretty

1849
02:54:19,400 --> 02:54:24,520
deep sale on playstation and i got the entire collection for like 20 bucks and that was one of

1850
02:54:24,520 --> 02:54:29,160
those series that i wasn't sure if i'd be really into it but um it was a it was a good game i i

1851
02:54:29,160 --> 02:54:34,280
didn't beat it because i never seem to beat games but i sunk plenty hours into it and i enjoyed what

1852
02:54:34,280 --> 02:54:39,160
i played um it's kind of you know that open world action type of thing like breath of the wild tomb

1853
02:54:39,160 --> 02:54:44,040
raider-esque type of thing um yeah i enjoyed that so i would say that was a pleasant surprise i

1854
02:54:44,040 --> 02:54:49,720
picked up a really good deal i think 20 bucks for that whole package was really good anything that

1855
02:54:49,720 --> 02:54:55,240
comes to mind for you guys not really i didn't buy anything this sale um the last game i bought

1856
02:54:55,240 --> 02:55:03,080
was black future 88 and still haven't gone around to playing it yet um by the way horizon zero dawn

1857
02:55:03,080 --> 02:55:07,160
is now down to fifteen dollars on this black friday sale so i mean if you're looking for

1858
02:55:07,160 --> 02:55:11,560
something on playstation 4 uh it's a pretty good one you don't want to pass up although

1859
02:55:11,560 --> 02:55:15,720
imagine if you wait long enough it's going to be a playstation plus game but well i want to say i

1860
02:55:15,720 --> 02:55:22,360
think super beat zonic was 99 cents at one time oh it was and then i picked that up so that's a

1861
02:55:22,360 --> 02:55:29,480
pretty good deal still haven't played it because i don't really get access to my switch anymore but

1862
02:55:29,480 --> 02:55:40,440
um yeah that's really it i buy a lot of weird stuff i buy a lot of um courses in udemy i was

1863
02:55:40,440 --> 02:55:46,280
disappointed that some of the expansion music for dj max uh respect weren't on sale because

1864
02:55:46,280 --> 02:55:50,200
i didn't realize that game was still doing expansions because they recently did a crossover

1865
02:55:50,200 --> 02:55:54,040
with groove coaster and i was interested in picking it up but the music the music expansions

1866
02:55:54,040 --> 02:55:59,240
in that game are pretty pricey and also just on a random tangent i saw a news article that dj

1867
02:55:59,240 --> 02:56:04,200
max respect is apparently coming to pc later this year um which is exciting but at the same time i'm

1868
02:56:04,200 --> 02:56:07,720
like that's going to be too much money they're going to want way too much money for it so i

1869
02:56:07,720 --> 02:56:12,360
hope they charge the right price for it so we'll see oh yeah pixel pocket says is it really rob

1870
02:56:12,360 --> 02:56:16,520
yeah i saw i saw a news article on that just a few days ago they just announced it like maybe

1871
02:56:16,520 --> 02:56:21,000
six days ago or something that there's going to be a dj max respect on pc if you look up if you um

1872
02:56:22,360 --> 02:56:27,160
excuse me if you go to like news.google where you can search for news trends just look for dj max it

1873
02:56:27,160 --> 02:56:30,280
should be one of the top stories that comes up so you can read they haven't said a lot about it

1874
02:56:30,280 --> 02:56:35,320
like we don't uh it's steam it's gonna be on steam that's all we know um but there's no page on steam

1875
02:56:35,320 --> 02:56:40,280
for it yet or anything like that so uh we're getting some answers from our chat uh quest

1876
02:56:40,280 --> 02:56:45,640
buster says valkyrie chronicles 4 for the ps4 is just 20 bucks really fun strategy game so there

1877
02:56:45,640 --> 02:56:50,440

1879
02:56:57,560 --> 02:57:04,280

your mind tonight i'm trying to get you in the next caller in here so we can wrap up so not to

1888
02:57:51,480 --> 02:57:57,880
but maybe a little what's up no i uh i won't take up too much of your time i just uh first off want

1889
02:57:57,880 --> 02:58:05,000
to say you know congrats on 800 etc etc appreciate that my friend if you guys still have fun doing

1890
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:12,200
this in a little over two years we'll be back to say congrats on 900 but uh i digress uh i did want

1891
02:58:12,200 --> 02:58:19,560
to mention something uh follow up to robert m's email earlier about uh you know the mac os support

1892
02:58:19,560 --> 02:58:27,640
basically what's happened is uh apple is trying to raise the security of mac os uh i'm not sure

1893
02:58:27,640 --> 02:58:33,080
if it's just because they want to protect their users from any and all uh avenues that malware

1894
02:58:33,080 --> 02:58:40,840
could get in or if they're just looking at iphone and ipad and saying well we get a a 30 cut of

1895
02:58:40,840 --> 02:58:49,240
everything they sell on there why not mac os too but for whatever reason they have a new thing

1896
02:58:49,240 --> 02:58:58,600
called notarization and starting uh with this new version of mac os that came out recently in

1897
02:58:58,600 --> 02:59:08,120
october uh all new apps have to be notarized uh which is a process you have to do directly with

1898
02:59:08,120 --> 02:59:18,680
apple otherwise they will not run now the thing is they temporarily relaxed these restrictions until

1899
02:59:18,680 --> 02:59:25,880
this coming january and one thing we noticed is that you know developing a mac game and running

1900
02:59:25,880 --> 02:59:32,920
it through steam it doesn't seem to go through some of the restrictive checks that other you know

1901
02:59:32,920 --> 02:59:40,840
applications do like if you had just distributed it say on your website uh so for all i know in

1902
02:59:40,840 --> 02:59:46,040
january my two games are going to stop working if you have the latest version of the operating

1903
02:59:46,040 --> 02:59:53,720
system i have no idea apple isn't saying anything valve has no clue either so i uh

1904
02:59:53,720 --> 02:59:59,800
yes yes i know how to notarize i see dark sakura put the link in chat but here's the kicker if you

1905
02:59:59,800 --> 03:00:05,800
want to be able to notarize your app you have to have an active developer account with apple which

1906
03:00:05,800 --> 03:00:16,520
means 99 a year yeah i i can tell you right now there is no uh i i am not making 99 a year on my

1907
03:00:16,520 --> 03:00:21,960
mac stuff you have a you have a baby to consider in that stuff so you gotta you know all those

1908
03:00:21,960 --> 03:00:29,080
costs uh certainly add up um well there are a lot of mass developers who are just not happy about

1909
03:00:29,080 --> 03:00:34,360
this for what it's worth the show computer is running catalina so i'm happy to test for you on

1910
03:00:34,360 --> 03:00:40,520
january 1st what happens um for what it's worth um but what's interesting is that um i think we've

1911
03:00:40,520 --> 03:00:46,920
run into a similar error i'm not sure if it has to do with security but like obs has some issues

1912
03:00:46,920 --> 03:00:51,960
i have to launch it from terminal in order to be able to get it to work um there still is not a

1913
03:00:51,960 --> 03:00:59,640
workaround on obs's front so um i don't know what is going on um so thank you for some of that

1914
03:00:59,640 --> 03:01:04,360
insight i mean i can you know i can certainly get where you know apple has a reputation of

1915
03:01:04,360 --> 03:01:09,880
being a safe platform where um pcs are usually the ones that get targeted by like viruses trojans

1916
03:01:09,880 --> 03:01:14,360
etc and so forth so um you know apple wants to kind of protect that because i think we've been

1917
03:01:14,360 --> 03:01:19,080
hearing in the past year we hear of it happening a little more on the mac platform still not yeah

1918
03:01:19,080 --> 03:01:23,880
you know the same ratios pc we've been hearing about it more so i think apple may have kind of

1919
03:01:23,880 --> 03:01:29,400
really clamped down on that in an effort to stay kind of that pristine clean little platform that

1920
03:01:29,400 --> 03:01:33,160
it is but unfortunately some more of this independent stuff is getting a little bit

1921
03:01:33,160 --> 03:01:39,640
left out in the cold as a result so um fingers crossed that it'll work i'm messaging you on

1922
03:01:39,640 --> 03:01:47,160
facebook about something so uh okay i'll make sure to log into facebook then okay yeah yeah

1923
03:01:47,160 --> 03:01:52,360
that's why she's gonna tell you all right but yeah i'm uh you're gonna see probably over the

1924
03:01:52,360 --> 03:01:58,120
next few months a lot of independent developers drop support for mac unfortunately uh simply

1925
03:01:58,120 --> 03:02:03,160
because you know they don't want to have to maintain an active subscription but i could be

1926
03:02:03,160 --> 03:02:07,880
wrong but we'll see yeah we'll see what happens it'll be interesting to see uh what develops but

1927
03:02:07,880 --> 03:02:13,160
i did not realize january was as soon as that was happening so that's less than a month away so

1928
03:02:13,160 --> 03:02:17,880
could be interesting and i don't know if it's january 1st january 30th nobody's saying anything

1929
03:02:17,880 --> 03:02:22,040
so we'll just figure it out all right we'll keep an eye on it well thank you for the follow-up

1930
03:02:22,040 --> 03:02:27,000
yyr and appreciate again everything you've done for you you've literally made our dreams come

1931
03:02:27,000 --> 03:02:31,640
true over the years um so we just want you to know how much you're appreciated and you're a

1932
03:02:31,640 --> 03:02:35,880
big part of how we got this far so thank you so much my friend i don't know if i would have gotten

1933
03:02:35,880 --> 03:02:40,680
this far without you guys either so thanks for that and uh have a great week we help each other

1934
03:02:40,680 --> 03:02:46,120
out take care my friend bye-bye see you later all right let's try to get one more call here before

1935
03:02:46,120 --> 03:02:50,360
we call it a night uh hi you're on orange long training who's this hey what's going on everybody

1936
03:02:50,360 --> 03:02:54,360
it is ron it is good to hear from you rama but i'm going to have us keep it quick tonight what's

1937
03:02:54,360 --> 03:03:02,440
on your mind first off i want to say happy 800. thank you my friend um to also touch back on

1938
03:03:02,440 --> 03:03:09,000
reference to jimmy fallon i can say i have seen some of the tech that they talk about on the show

1939
03:03:09,000 --> 03:03:17,560
that's the most i can release it okay meaning you know something bringing like newer tech and gaming

1940
03:03:17,560 --> 03:03:22,520
and so forth let's just say i've been in areas where you know they put stuff that they had on

1941
03:03:22,520 --> 03:03:29,640
the show up in store i've seen some of it so yeah all right good to know you probably have

1942
03:03:29,640 --> 03:03:35,880
observed a lot of interesting things over the year but we'll leave it at that cool and lastly i have

1943
03:03:35,880 --> 03:03:43,880
a switch i'm sorry say that again mr smoosh was trying to be heard over you i have a switch oh

1944
03:03:43,880 --> 03:03:47,960
congratulations of course yes because i got the friend request on the switch and of course you

1945
03:03:47,960 --> 03:03:53,960
picked luigi as your icon thank you um so um yeah congratulations what are you playing on it

1946
03:03:54,680 --> 03:04:02,760
right now mario kart 8 i picked up um starlink because it was like 10 bucks and i also picked up

1947
03:04:02,760 --> 03:04:07,720
a collection of mon those are some really good choices because you have a little bit of old

1948
03:04:07,720 --> 03:04:12,120
school you have a little bit of deep discounts you have some new school in there as well and i

1949
03:04:12,120 --> 03:04:17,000
also i also picked up links awakening i forgot yeah uh did anything in particular finally sway

1950
03:04:17,080 --> 03:04:21,480
you into the switch like now was it the free game of mario kart that finally got you in or what

1951
03:04:21,480 --> 03:04:28,520
what swayed you from e3 seeing a collection of mana because one of the games uh secret of mana

1952
03:04:28,520 --> 03:04:33,160
got me through a real rough time in my teenage years which is part of the reason why i picked

1953
03:04:33,160 --> 03:04:38,600
up a snest classic but this along with links awakening which was one of my personal favorite

1954
03:04:38,600 --> 03:04:44,680
zelda games so i'm just like god damn it nintendo here's my money have you touched trials of mana

1955
03:04:44,680 --> 03:04:51,400
or second sense of three yet i have not be sure to get in on that i was uh very pleasantly

1956
03:04:51,400 --> 03:04:55,640
surprised with that i need again on my list of games i need to finish but i did it i did

1957
03:04:55,640 --> 03:04:59,880
a pretty good decent amount of streaming like probably good four or five hours into that game

1958
03:04:59,880 --> 03:05:03,800
and uh it was great i had a good time i'm looking forward to a little redo i hope they learn some

1959
03:05:03,800 --> 03:05:09,080
things from the secret of mana redo same here but unfortunately i can't play the game i can't

1960
03:05:09,080 --> 03:05:12,920
play my switch as much because when i was coming back from mako channels i accidentally left my

1961
03:05:12,920 --> 03:05:18,840
charger behind oh no well the good news is it's a universal like for once nintendo is using like

1962
03:05:18,840 --> 03:05:24,520
universal stuff so as long as you have like a usb-c cable i think it is um you can charge it

1963
03:05:24,520 --> 03:05:31,400
with like anything so um you should say that because i'm doing that right now and according

1964
03:05:31,400 --> 03:05:36,920
to my switch it's not enough power so i think i have to go out and get another adapter so we

1965
03:05:36,920 --> 03:05:41,240
will see damn well best of luck to you i hope uh you're able to find the magic thing that gets a

1966
03:05:41,240 --> 03:05:44,520
chart yeah it probably needs to put out a certain amount of voltage that maybe whatever you're using

1967
03:05:44,520 --> 03:05:49,640
isn't doing but then again i also picked up another tablet while i got myself the certain

1968
03:05:49,640 --> 03:05:55,560
8 gig surface go which has a surface charger it also charges my usb-c so i do have to pick up

1969
03:05:55,560 --> 03:05:59,880
another charger so well there you go so maybe maybe that'll work so just make sure it's a

1970
03:05:59,880 --> 03:06:02,680
yeah if you're trying to do it like through a computer or through a plate it probably won't

1971
03:06:02,680 --> 03:06:07,080
be enough juice to enough voltage to do it but i bet if you get a pretty decent brick

1972
03:06:07,080 --> 03:06:10,280
um that can really pump some voltage through it i bet it'll i bet it'll work

1973
03:06:11,480 --> 03:06:15,960
that's what i'm thinking so you know for the time being i'm just letting it be until mocotron

1974
03:06:15,960 --> 03:06:22,040
ships it to me you know so i can because i am enjoying it i i can see the difference between

1975
03:06:22,040 --> 03:06:27,880
playing on a small screen and a large screen which i enjoy but since i'm kind of disappointed so

1976
03:06:27,880 --> 03:06:32,680
oh bobby also with an excellent suggestion suggesting a bypass the dock the dock is

1977
03:06:32,680 --> 03:06:38,120
going to require a higher voltage than just the system itself so uh if you plug directly

1978
03:06:38,120 --> 03:06:40,840
into the system you might be able to get away with it on whatever you're using now

1979
03:06:41,560 --> 03:06:45,400
yeah but you know but i will have to use the regular charger so i can actually play it on

1980
03:06:45,400 --> 03:06:49,880
the tv so of course understandable all right my friend i'm gonna let you go so we can wrap up but

1981
03:06:49,880 --> 03:06:53,880
thank you so much for the call hey no problem y'all take care stay awesome take care my friend

1982
03:06:53,880 --> 03:07:01,160
bye all right so i think with that we're through everything in the uh discord channel so thank you

1983
03:07:01,160 --> 03:07:05,000
lots of calls tonight thank you so much for that uh we do want to start to move to wrap up here

1984
03:07:05,000 --> 03:07:08,520
though since this is close to 9 30. i do have to ask if there's any last minute stories just

1985
03:07:08,520 --> 03:07:12,520
yeah i don't want to leave anything out all right yes i have a couple things so the first one being

1986
03:07:12,520 --> 03:07:21,480
that um the company beat games who as the developer of beat saber i think this news broke

1987
03:07:21,480 --> 03:07:26,920
during the show last week i feel like but maybe maybe not i thought it was a thing that broke

1988
03:07:26,920 --> 03:07:31,240
during the show but go ahead they were acquired by facebook yeah so now if you want to get that

1989
03:07:31,240 --> 03:07:36,520
beat saber action you're gonna have to do it on through oculus i guess well well they're gonna

1990
03:07:36,520 --> 03:07:40,040
no because i remember talking about they're gonna continue to support all the platforms that are

1991
03:07:40,040 --> 03:07:45,400
out there now so they're not gonna like pull it from whatever yeah but if there's a beat saber 2

1992
03:07:45,400 --> 03:07:49,320
or you know who knows but you know minecraft is a microsoft product and they still

1993
03:07:50,120 --> 03:07:55,880
runs great on nintendo there's still a playstation 4 version yeah but microsoft versus facebook

1994
03:07:57,880 --> 03:08:03,800
fair i'm not the biggest facebook fan but let's let's wait until something actually happens before

1995
03:08:03,800 --> 03:08:09,000
we say doomsday and then in acquisition news as well we have slightly mad studios uh the

1996
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:14,680
developers project car is being acquired by code masters which you know code masters has a lot of

1997
03:08:14,680 --> 03:08:20,280
their own uh driving franchises so like i said it kind of makes sense yeah that's it money money

1998
03:08:20,280 --> 03:08:25,640
money all right so that's it for last minute stories so it brings our show just about to a

1999
03:08:25,640 --> 03:08:30,280
close uh we're gonna go around and get everybody's final thoughts but again here on this 800th

2000
03:08:30,280 --> 03:08:34,440
episode of our show just want to thank you guys for being here whether it's live whether it's on

2001
03:08:34,440 --> 03:08:39,240
the podcast you know you guys really make up this show and keep us going um so i really can't thank

2002
03:08:39,240 --> 03:08:44,280
you enough thank you for your participation and uh you know it's funny because why we are set on

2003
03:08:44,280 --> 03:08:48,760
that call if we do this for two more years we'll be celebrating 900 and i'm thinking in the back

2004
03:08:48,760 --> 03:08:54,040
of my head if we do it for four more years we'll get to a thousand we should do it wouldn't that

2005
03:08:54,040 --> 03:08:59,400
be something we'll try Guinness we'll try yeah hey Guinness do the thing and then you know what

2006
03:08:59,400 --> 03:09:04,760
if we get to a thousand i'll fucking call Guinness but i'll do it before that well here's the thing

2007
03:09:04,760 --> 03:09:10,520
there's other shows that have hit a thousand episodes but they do more than one a week like

2008
03:09:10,520 --> 03:09:15,000
i can think of a couple podcasts that like during e3 week they'll release like 20 episodes we've

2009
03:09:15,000 --> 03:09:21,640
been around longer than everybody that is still yeah that's still going regularly weekly yes i

2010
03:09:21,640 --> 03:09:28,760
think there is a show that did something then stopped for a long time then came back

2011
03:09:29,320 --> 03:09:34,120
but i shouldn't count it yeah i'm not counting that we're the longest continuously weekly show

2012
03:09:34,120 --> 03:09:43,000
without a major break so all right anyhow yeah uh dark diseases 2022 is 20 years yeah that would be

2013
03:09:43,880 --> 03:09:48,040
that be yeah that'd be about three years i mean it doesn't line up you would think oh there's

2014
03:09:48,040 --> 03:09:53,240
about 50 give or take weeks in a year shouldn't you be on episode it would be what like 850 by

2015
03:09:53,240 --> 03:09:57,800
now but just you know shit happens like we miss two weeks here and there we go on vacation things

2016
03:09:57,800 --> 03:10:03,240
happen you know so we don't but most of your shows out there like you know if you're watching things

2017
03:10:03,240 --> 03:10:08,680
on netflix what you get like 10 episodes of stranger things a year uh and even regular series

2018
03:10:08,680 --> 03:10:13,400
shows you get what like 26 episodes maybe yeah i might have to wait until 2020 for the end of

2019
03:10:14,040 --> 03:10:19,560
um the good place damn it oh oh did they go on a break i i'm still time to catch up on season

2020
03:10:19,560 --> 03:10:25,960
three i'm really behind oh you're on season three oh so swung tong says vgn is just this

2021
03:10:25,960 --> 03:10:31,560
long-running issue but they all go on hiatus a lot no disrespect to those hard-working fellows

2022
03:10:31,560 --> 03:10:37,560
over there but um as you pointed out they do go on hiatus a lot so um i think they went like a year

2023
03:10:37,560 --> 03:10:45,000
at least uh with a break um also we did start on life 365 just before i think they got started

2024
03:10:45,000 --> 03:10:51,720
in 03 or 04 uh our first episode was june of 2002 again i mean no disrespect um and i think

2025
03:10:51,720 --> 03:10:55,960
everything that they've accomplished should be celebrated as well it is not easy to keep your

2026
03:10:55,960 --> 03:11:04,360
show going one year let alone 17 so anyway um bobby blackwell says they claim to be the oldest

2027
03:11:04,360 --> 03:11:10,280
video game podcast well unfortunately um that is i want to see the receipts show me an episode

2028
03:11:10,280 --> 03:11:15,720
that you did before june of 2002 that was branded that same way because i don't think it exists

2029
03:11:15,720 --> 03:11:22,760
sorry and again even if it did as been pointing out there's been been a lot of long breaks so

2030
03:11:23,320 --> 03:11:29,000
all right and also sorry again i'm gonna sound like i'm being rude and i'm really not but i do

2031
03:11:29,000 --> 03:11:33,960
believe at one point the name of that show has changed because they weren't about video games

2032
03:11:33,960 --> 03:11:42,440
for a while um so just kind of just have to say that sorry anyway um let's see did i get final

2033
03:11:42,440 --> 03:11:45,960
thoughts no i was i was ramping up and saying thanks for all that stuff and all that good stuff

2034
03:11:45,960 --> 03:11:50,680
so let's go around and get everybody's final thought um dark soccer we'll start with you i

stranding and who knows whatever else i decide to get into this week last but not least loki your

2046
