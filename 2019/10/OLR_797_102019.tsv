0	17240	Since your last spoke, the gaming storefront and launcher world is getting a little bit
17240	19840	smaller with EA choosing to relinquish their exclusivity.
19840	21440	Balance has shifted in the force.
21440	22800	This is just one headline to catch up on.
22800	25920	Stay tuned for the rest of the stories we have time for starting right now on the show
25920	33240	where every gamer has a voice.
33240	37600	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show
37600	39160	where every gamer has a voice.
39160	43040	It is Orange Lounge Radio back again, back, back, back again.
43040	47820	Episode number 797 for this November the 3rd of 2019.
47820	51280	My name Rob Roberts, her name DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
51280	52280	Hi.
52280	53760	And his name, Techmaster Loki.
53760	54760	Hello.
54760	59440	We have you guys in our chat room over at twitch.tv slash vog network because we do
59440	63680	tape live at the Voice of Geeks network every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock
63680	66400	Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
66400	67560	Insert your name here.
67560	68560	That's right.
68560	71720	So, and we appreciate of course all the hosts and all you guys that support our show.
71720	74600	And even if you're listening on the podcast feed, welcome back.
74600	78360	Hope you weren't thrown off by us being gone for two weeks.
78360	80720	We'll address all that a little bit later in the show.
80720	84700	But since we have been gone for a little bit, I want to jump right into gaming news tonight.
84700	90540	Let's talk about BlizzCon because ironically, the last time that we did have a show, we
90540	97140	were kind of talking about this whole Blizzard made a big boo-boo with the banning of the
97140	99300	Hearthstone player and so forth.
99300	103140	So BlizzCon happened and many folks were surprised.
103140	109460	I don't know if I was surprised, but I think many folks were surprised that BlizzCon opened
109460	110780	with a little bit of this.
110780	115260	Before we start the opening ceremony, I want to say a few words.
115260	122780	You know, Blizzard had the opportunity to bring the world together in a tough Hearthstone
122780	128380	esports moment about a month ago and we did not.
128380	135580	We moved too quickly in our decision making and then to make matters worse, we were too
135580	140260	slow to talk with all of you.
140260	145580	When I think about what I'm most unhappy about, there's really two things.
145580	152620	The first one is we didn't live up to the high standards that we really set for ourselves.
152620	157000	And the second is we failed in our purpose.
157000	162580	And for that, I am sorry and I accept accountability.
162580	163580	So there it is.
163580	170220	The new CEO of Blizzard, J. Allen Brack, sorry I'm butchering the last name there.
170220	172340	I don't have it right in front of me.
172340	175340	And he's accepting accountability for what happened with the whole issue.
175340	180500	But to quote Jim Sterling, what are you apologizing for?
180500	183220	Because you're being incredibly vague about everything.
183220	186580	You're not mentioning the specific things that you did wrong and the specific things
186580	190100	that you need changed and the specific things that you're not living up to standards on.
190100	193980	You're just seeing a tough esports moment.
193980	195560	You know what the fucking thing is.
195560	197500	It was a little weird to be so blunt.
197500	198500	It's such bullshit.
198500	206020	It is such bullshit because they say they're apologizing about it, but are they unbanned?
206020	207020	Nope.
207020	208260	They are still banned.
208260	214900	So they're just they're just appeasing you because they're like, yeah, see, we're apologizing
214900	215900	for it.
215900	219420	Here's some new things that you like and you're totally going to forget about it months down
219420	221900	the road when this stuff comes out and you're going to purchase it anyways.
221900	224380	I understand you would like some smoke for your ass.
224380	225380	Let me blow it for you.
225380	226380	I don't know.
226380	229420	I think you guys are using harsher language than even I might.
229420	233700	And I took a lot of shit on Twitter this week for my stance, but I'm I'm OK with it.
233700	237900	You know, like, again, I'm not saying that like we need to boycott Blizzard.
237900	241060	That's not the word I'm choosing to use in this whole situation.
241060	244380	I am seeing other people right now.
244380	250020	That's where I am about Blizzard, because look, and in many ways, yes, it is about the
250020	256180	issue of banning Blitzchung and more so I'm at least I'm at least thankful.
256860	261660	That this that Jay Allen got up there and said it wasn't just what we did, but it was
261660	264180	how slow we were to respond to respond.
264180	268620	So I do want to give credit for acknowledging that, because I do feel like and I it's not
268620	269620	that I disagree with you.
269620	270620	I don't know.
270620	271620	They're pretty quick.
271620	275660	They're pretty quick to respond to the was that the college team also got banned for
275660	276660	six months.
276660	277660	All right.
277660	280220	And I and that's the thing is, it's like I do appreciate that at least he called that
280220	281220	portion of it out by name.
281220	284740	But Eddie, though, didn't shut up and let me talk.
285020	291740	But like you, I am kind of like, why don't they just call exactly what it is?
291740	295020	And for me in that, I mean, great, you accepted accountability.
295020	296020	It's a nice start.
296020	298900	But what's the real difference that's going to change?
298900	302100	And if they're not going to sit here and say, we're going to unban those casters who didn't
302100	305340	deserve it, even though there's some people out there that feel the casters did deserve
305340	311060	it because they feel like the casters lobbed the ball or whatever, I as as somebody who
311060	315500	has been in the position similar to what would a caster would go through lives of worth,
315500	317420	I completely disagree with that assessment.
317420	318420	That's fine.
318420	319420	Everybody's entitled to their opinion.
319420	321240	And that is also important to this scenario.
321240	324000	If you want to keep playing Blizzard games, go off, sis.
324000	325340	I'm totally fine with that.
325340	326340	It's your money.
326340	327340	Spend it on how you want.
327340	333140	But for me, it's not just about what's happening or what's happened with the Blitzchung scenario.
333140	338620	That was more like the final straw for me because we're forgetting there's been a lot
338620	343380	of comedy of Blizzard errors that has been happening over the last two years, namely
343380	348660	the last BlizzCon and everything that happened there, namely remember when at this exact
348660	352840	same time, this was all going down, there was a guild that got banned for being called
352840	357100	gay boys because the automated system, you know, threw it out, whatever, fine blame it
357100	360060	on the automated system, but that's still like a thing that happened that shouldn't
360060	361060	have.
361060	364320	And it's, it's more like a culmination of all of these things.
364320	368500	And I think what really irritates me about this whole situation, this is what it really
368500	373780	is for me, is that, and it's funny because these folks, you know, on Twitter, and again,
373780	377100	I'm not trying to like shade anybody and everybody's welcome to their opinion and so forth want
377100	380100	to say, well, if you're mad at Blizzard, you should be mad at Apple.
380100	382060	You should be mad at Microsoft.
382060	386340	You should be mad at Sony and whatever other companies are having the perception of embed
386340	387420	with China.
387420	392180	And that argument, I suppose, would be something you could do if, if that is the only issue
392180	393740	I have with Blizzard.
393740	401180	But the problem is that it's not because what's really irritating to me, here's what it is.
401180	407480	It's that they were so fast to ban all these folks that said things about China.
407480	412420	But do you remember when that Overwatch League player made the homophobic remarks on his
412420	413420	stream?
413420	414580	How long did that guy get banned for?
414580	416060	Did he get a lifetime ban?
416060	417060	No.
417060	418500	Did he get a six month ban?
418500	419500	No.
419500	420500	He got a four game ban.
420500	422980	That was the equivalent of a month.
422980	425100	That is why I'm mad.
425100	434100	Because the China thing was like way overcompensating compared to what they've done in other situations.
434100	436700	That was the straw that broke the camel's back.
436700	438860	But if you want to continue to play Blizzard games, that's fine.
438860	443160	Because I also understand there's a tricky line here.
443160	447700	There's many employees, many people I know that work for Blizzard that have nothing to
447700	448700	do with any of this.
448700	452140	In fact, they get very frustrated by this stuff as well.
452140	455820	And yeah, I don't really want to hurt those people.
455820	460280	But the reality is I already bought Diablo 3, I bought Overwatch and so forth, and I
460280	465540	just don't really see the need to continue my World of Warcraft subscription right now.
465540	470860	And not playing two MMOs right now is really great for freeing up my plate for doing other
470860	471860	things.
471860	476460	Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2, which we'll get into in a minute, because admittedly they
476460	478540	look pretty sweet.
478540	484100	I'll evaluate those games and whether I want to buy them or not when they come out.
484100	485340	They're not coming out tomorrow.
485340	487900	They're not coming out by the end of the year.
487900	490300	They're probably not coming out by summer.
490300	493780	Because where's Warcraft 3 remastered?
493780	497060	For all the shit it got, where's Diablo Immortal?
497060	501820	I think they maybe acknowledged, I think Warcraft 3 they said is doing the beta.
501820	506160	I think they acknowledged Diablo Immortal, but for all intents and purposes, those games
506160	510880	that were their big flagship things last year, for better or for far, far worse, still
510880	512800	aren't out.
512800	515220	So we have a whole year at least.
515220	519080	Did they say that these games, because I saw a tweet that was something like, wow, all
519080	522040	these games are coming out in 2020, Blizzard's got a huge year ahead.
522040	523960	Did they say these games are coming out in 2020?
523960	524960	I don't think so.
524960	525960	I don't think they did.
525960	527360	And feel free to correct me if I'm wrong in chat.
527360	531200	I don't think they said, I would imagine the Warcraft expansion, yeah, it's got to be because
531200	532620	that's their timetable.
532620	536740	And maybe one of these games, probably Overwatch 2 is going to be next year.
536740	537740	That's a guess.
537740	539620	But is it all coming next year?
539620	541860	I don't necessarily think so.
541860	544420	Blizzard don't always work on those types of timetables.
544420	545900	Again, it's been a year.
545900	547300	Where's Warcraft 3 remastered?
547300	548380	Where's Diablo Immortal?
548380	550200	Those games still aren't out.
550200	552100	So that's where it is for me.
552100	555260	Blizzard, we're seeing other people for a little bit and I'm going to continue to see
555260	556440	other people.
556440	558900	Let's see how you do in the next year.
558900	562840	Let's see the action behind those words that you just said.
562840	567100	And then in a year when these games are out, I'll decide what I want to do.
567100	572100	But more importantly though, at the very end of his little apology, if you will, he talked
572100	575900	about like, we have players from, you know, around the world, like, you know, I want to
575900	580500	say like 69 countries or 65 countries or whatever in there, or they're talking about their company
580500	584020	and stuff and about people everywhere around the world and that they want those voices
584020	586500	heard.
586500	589460	Except if it's about China, in which case then we're going to ban your ass.
589460	593140	Well, did you notice though that, okay, so there was a panel and I forgot to grab the
593140	597020	video of it, but there was a panel, somebody posted this in our discord actually, so shout
597020	601140	out to vognetwork.com slash discord because it's actually where I first saw it.
601140	604500	There actually was a World of Warcraft Q and A panel where somebody asked this question
604500	609300	and then at the very end of it said, you know, free Hong Kong revolution of our times.
609300	612580	The exact same quote that got Blitzchung in trouble, he said that right at the end of
612580	616380	his question, then promptly walked off and sat down and the host just kind of had one
616380	620900	of those like smiles, like not, yep, this is what they taught me in training might happen
620900	623140	and just kind of smiled and acknowledged it and moved on.
623140	628420	Like they just kind of, it was very obvious they had a game plan for what they were going
628420	634500	to do if a Hong Kong thing started and it was going to be very much shut the fuck up
634500	638460	and just let it take its course and then get the, get the car moving again because that's
638460	639460	exactly what that hosted.
639460	640860	And then there was, there were, it got awkward.
640860	646300	I thought what the guy did was very like, just very like bam, just slap, like just thwack
646300	648140	the table and then left.
648140	651180	Then there, I thought it was a little awkward cause then somebody kind of tried to piggyback
651180	652180	on that.
652180	653180	It was like free Hong Kong, free Hong Kong.
653180	654780	And there was like dancing in front of the camera.
654780	657780	And then the guy said, did you have anything you want to say?
657780	659540	And it said free Hong Kong.
659540	666020	And I, I feel like the second individual kind of messed up that opportunity a little bit.
666020	669540	And you know, when the adrenaline's going, there's a lot of things you do.
669540	672340	It just, the second person came off a little bit more immature.
672340	674560	I think the first one was very cool and calculated.
674560	679020	The second one was very much like Muppet Flail and it didn't read very well at all, but again,
679020	683380	the way they responded to it very much the host, would you like to say anything that
683380	689060	did it like very, like they knew that was, there was very much an action plan for that
689060	693540	scenario and you saw it play out there as kind of awkward-ish as it was.
693540	701900	So which that's better than maybe like cutting away and trying to shut it down and everything.
701900	705600	So I'll give them that, like they seem to be learning in that regard.
705600	708580	You know, they didn't, they didn't try to like shut it down completely.
708580	709580	I suppose.
709580	710580	I don't know.
710580	714140	Anyway, I do want to get to some comments in our chat Questbuster over at a Twitch TV
714140	718500	slash a VOG network says on Rob's note about Blizzard employees feeling frustrated.
718500	723060	A few of them did stage a small walkout of their own on campus when this broke.
723100	725780	Yes, very important to note.
725780	727180	And I think that is so cool.
727180	730720	And I really applaud those folks because you know what?
730720	736680	Angry internet dorks only go so far like that type of behavior.
736680	739120	That's what's really going to affect the change.
739120	743620	So when you know that those people on the inside are really on your side too, that is
743620	745060	a really, really good feeling.
745060	747500	So I fully support what those guys are doing.
747500	750760	And I think, I think that's, that's fantastic.
750760	753760	And hopefully the change will continue from within.
753760	757860	You know, I guess I can talk a little more openly about this now because I used to work
757860	762760	in for many years, I no longer work in, I worked in the health insurance industry.
762760	767140	And believe me, I've heard a lot of shit about health insurance over the years.
767140	769440	It is a pretty messed up system.
769440	773000	But you know what, all I could really do in that scenario, I had to do what I could do
773000	776200	from the inside to try to make it better for the customers to try to make it better for
776200	779240	people to understand to try to make sure that people weren't getting screwed over and all
779240	780560	that type of stuff.
780560	785160	Sometimes it's, it's the folks on the inside have to kind of do what they can.
785160	789680	But every like big fuck up that's ever happened in gaming, it happened in a boardroom somewhere.
789680	793600	It didn't happen because some hard working developer that's working crunch time and all
793600	797000	that stuff, you know, decided they were going to screw something up.
797000	798520	Anyway, let me get to more comments.
798520	802800	SG100Matt says, we all know what they were talking about in reference to Jay Allen's
802800	803800	speech there.
803800	805320	They admitted to acting too quickly.
805320	807320	They admitted to acting too slowly to speak.
807320	809000	Do they really need to name names?
809000	810280	In my opinion, I don't think so.
810280	813680	It's going to take a long time for Blizzard to win back people's trust and rightfully
813680	814680	so.
814680	815920	But this apology is a start.
815920	819120	They need to act and not use nice words and heartfelt speeches.
819120	823440	They need to do more and prove to us they will be better to win back our trust.
823440	824440	Exactly.
824440	829540	And the way I see it as much as Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2 do look great, and I hope, I hope
829540	833920	they do make better and do better so I can feel good about supporting those games and
833920	836480	supporting my friends that work at the company.
836480	839920	I don't feel the need to pre-purchase today.
839920	841560	Is that so wrong?
841560	844880	Don't feel the need to pre-purchase the new WoW expansion today, which believe me is something
844880	845880	you can do.
845880	846880	You want to get your level 60?
846880	849360	Because it's 60 again because everybody's getting a squish.
849360	851860	You want to get your level 60 WoW character boost right now?
851860	853680	You can pre-purchase Shadowlands today.
853680	856720	I just, maybe not now.
856720	857720	Maybe not, not today.
857720	862120	Anyway, let's see, trying to go to some other comments here.
862120	867060	Questbuster in chat says, open forum, public space, little doubt Blizzard likely drilled
867060	870700	everyone manning their stations at the con on what to expect.
870700	871700	Absolutely.
871700	872700	They knew it was coming.
872700	877980	Somebody on Twitter commented that it sounded like they had a separate mic volume for the
877980	885900	crowd, that they had a way to kill the crowd mics and kill the crowd speech if need be.
885900	889580	Which you know, as much as you might want to say like, yo, fuck Blizzard for that type
889580	890580	of thing.
890580	894700	Like real talk y'all, there's a lot of things on TV that are like that and a lot of things
894700	895860	where if there's pre-pand...
895860	900340	I mean, even any sporting event knows how to cut away from a streaker, right?
900340	903180	Because you don't want to give the streaker attention.
903180	907100	You don't want to broadcast the booty on TV since it's running by.
907100	910740	You know, those types of things, like anybody putting on a professional presentation knows
910740	912580	how to cut away from this stuff like that.
912580	914260	So I mean, I'm not surprised to hear it.
914260	919660	It's just weird to hear it with BlizzCon, but I mean, BlizzCon is a massive media production,
919660	921020	is it not?
921020	924960	Tigerclaw is saying, was the red shirt guy back at BlizzCon?
924960	926800	I wonder what comment he made.
926800	929760	Remember his comment about Diablo Immortal being a late April Fool's joke?
929760	933580	It actually wasn't the same red shirt guy.
933580	937200	Wearing a red shirt has become some sort of interesting symbol.
937200	940240	And it's interesting that all these people that get up on the mic and do interesting
940240	942840	things are often wearing red shirts.
942840	946720	But believe it or not, the guy who asked the lore question started the whole red shirt
946720	947720	thing.
947720	949680	The guy who said, is this an April Fool's joke?
949680	954480	And the guy who just said free Hong Kong are all different red shirt guys.
954520	956520	I wish I had a graphic.
956520	959800	This is a more professional TV operation, I'd have a graphic that would show them side
959800	960800	by side.
960800	966440	Lore nerd, guy making shitty comment, guy saying free Hong Kong.
966440	968720	Very different people.
968720	976280	Anyway, anything else you guys want to say about the apology and all that stuff?
976280	982600	Darsakha, Loki, I know I've said a lot there, I want to open it up to you guys too.
982600	984160	It's just vague corporate speak.
984160	986480	That's seriously what it is.
986480	989520	There's no good way for them to get out of it.
989520	990520	Really there's not.
990520	996400	They fucked up, they've kept fucking up, and they're trying to do distraction tactics.
996400	999520	Now it's this sort of fake accountability thing.
999520	1002220	And I don't believe words anymore, I believe actions.
1002220	1007480	I want to see action before I remotely even consider anything else.
1007480	1011520	Because as it stands, I'm pretty done with Blizzard.
1011520	1017880	I was already done with WoW in general, and now I'm done, done.
1017880	1025080	No, this is definitely one of the final straws for me, especially exactly for the same reason
1025080	1026080	that you said.
1026080	1033000	And remember, every time there's a controversy, even with Bethesda, they always give the,
1033000	1037900	we're going to do better, we need to do better, it's not up to our expectations.
1037900	1039840	Everybody has that fucking line.
1039840	1044000	It doesn't fucking matter what they say, it's about what they do.
1044000	1049000	So let's see them do something about it, because right now they haven't done shit.
1049000	1053380	And in regards to people comparing company A to company B to whatever, I look at the
1053380	1056120	past record and look at the integrity.
1056120	1060040	Has this company actually made good on what they say?
1060040	1065520	If they found something has gone awry with their services or whatever, how quickly were
1065520	1067740	they to make a change?
1067740	1072540	So that being said, I don't really care about anyone throwing out comparisons.
1072540	1073540	What about this?
1073540	1074540	What about that?
1074540	1077240	That is a fallacious argument in and of itself.
1077240	1081660	And trust me, if you want me to list the general fallacious arguments and why I don't respect
1081660	1083980	them, I can do that in another time.
1083980	1086500	But it is inherently a fallacious argument.
1086500	1091060	The only thing that you can look at is the company itself, what it is doing, and only
1091060	1093100	compare it to its own actions.
1093100	1095460	End of story.
1095500	1099500	I saw a very interesting tweet that was very kind of like this kind of like shady thing
1099500	1102780	that was like, and it didn't name names, but I could, you know, sometimes you got to feel
1102780	1104980	the, you feel the shade a little bit, right?
1104980	1108260	It's like that, that gif of the shade moving over the city.
1108260	1111740	And it was something like, interesting all of these people tweeting their criticisms
1111740	1116040	of Blizzard from their iPhones when Apple has done all this stuff too.
1116040	1122340	And I'm like, okay, look, I can, I can understand why folks may have a criticism of Apple and
1122340	1123340	China.
1123340	1124340	That's fine.
1124340	1126180	And that is your choice to make.
1126180	1127180	That's fine.
1127180	1131020	I'm going to tell you why I didn't make that choice, because it's not the same thing.
1131020	1135380	I just said Blizzard's thing is a history of these things going on.
1135380	1140140	And it's also the Apples and, or excuse me, the, the what happened here versus what that
1140140	1141140	happened there.
1141140	1144780	And there was a big disconnect between the two bands and what happened there, despite
1144780	1146420	all this other stuff in between.
1146420	1151300	With Apple, yes, I realized they pulled an app that, you know, was very controversial,
1151300	1156820	but for what it's worth, at least when it happened immediately, Tim Cook put out, the
1156820	1160560	CEO put out a statement saying, this is why we did it.
1160560	1162460	This is the policy that it broke.
1162460	1163800	And this is what it was.
1163800	1165180	They didn't wait a week.
1165180	1168900	They said, here's the word straight from the top when it happened.
1168900	1173860	Now I'm not like, again, if you have decided you can't support Apple because of that or
1173860	1175100	whatever, that's fine.
1175100	1177060	That's your call to make and so forth.
1177060	1182940	But I just want to say where this is not the same as this in my viewpoint.
1182940	1186340	And I think to kind of throw out there that like, oh, you got to ban all these companies
1186340	1188300	because they all do business in China.
1188300	1190380	Yo, China's got 1 billion people.
1190380	1193400	Of course, everybody wants to do business in China.
1193400	1196660	But again, it's about how you do that business.
1196660	1202840	And again, you know, when this ban doesn't match that ban, and so on and so on.
1202840	1210560	Is it as much of a crime to say free Hong Kong as it is to say F A G G O T on a stream?
1210560	1218040	So you know, that's, that's, that's why I feel for me that argument doesn't work.
1218040	1222040	And also one other thing I'd say about that whole thing is that Apple, I don't mean, it
1222040	1225960	could be Apple, it could be Microsoft, it could be Samsung, it could be, you know, and
1225960	1228360	insert whoever you want here.
1228360	1233040	That is a device that I use to stay in contact with family and all that stuff.
1233040	1236240	We're talking about that versus a video game.
1236240	1239320	One is a little more easier to cut out than the other.
1239320	1244600	I think that's why you have so much activism against Chick-fil-A, for example.
1244600	1247620	It's really easy to cut out fast food.
1247620	1251420	I don't want to dive down that whole well right now, but I think that's what makes that
1251420	1253760	particular boycott really easy.
1253760	1255160	It's fast food.
1255160	1257480	Most people shouldn't be eating it anyway.
1257480	1260920	Anyhow, other comments in chat.
1260920	1269120	Over at twitch.tv slash vog network, a zet in our chat says, watch what they do, not
1269120	1270400	what they say.
1270400	1272300	Very, very well said.
1272300	1273300	That's exactly what it is.
1273300	1278200	And we've got, and what I'm trying to say is, look, y'all, we've got like a year.
1278200	1281540	So Blizzard's got a whole chance to be awesome.
1281540	1285800	And I will say that little rainbow pan, at least that he was wearing, that was cool.
1285800	1286960	That was a nice gesture.
1287480	1289160	That's a little baby step.
1289160	1290160	That's a cool thing.
1290160	1291160	Yay.
1291160	1293000	But we got a ways to go.
1293000	1294000	All right.
1296000	1300000	Anyway, fifth dream today in chat says other companies make phones, you guys.
1300000	1301000	Yes.
1301000	1305280	And I've seen every single one of those other companies used in a don't support X company
1305280	1307280	because China.
1307280	1308280	You name it.
1308280	1309280	Samsung, there's a reason.
1309280	1310280	Google, there's a reason.
1310280	1312320	Microsoft, you still using a Windows phone?
1312320	1313320	There's a reason.
1313320	1315040	Everybody's got a reason.
1315120	1321320	I would also look at, and just back to that, look at all of these various companies' interactions
1321320	1326120	with the government where they operate out of, and also look at the action.
1326120	1327120	Just saying.
1327120	1328120	All right.
1328120	1332340	Let's get back to games because, you know, let's talk about the games that were announced
1332340	1333340	at BlizzCon.
1333340	1337360	Because I will say, of course, you know, despite all this stuff, I still want to be, I'm still
1337360	1338580	a fan of gaming.
1338580	1341560	And I got to say, some of these games look pretty darn cool.
1341560	1344100	Let's talk first about Overwatch 2.
1344100	1348860	So on Twitch right now, we're playing some of the gameplay trailer that they put out
1348860	1353300	for Overwatch 2, which shows some of the new features that are going to be in the game,
1353300	1356860	such as there's a new Toronto map, but it looks like they're kind of reusing some maps,
1356860	1359140	but they are going to be some new modes.
1359140	1361420	They've kind of redone what the characters look like.
1361420	1363620	There's going to be more of a focus on PvE.
1363620	1368340	Didn't I say before that if Overwatch were to ever do an expansion, they could do something
1368340	1369660	on PvE?
1369660	1370660	Just saying.
1370660	1371660	Yes.
1371660	1372780	I'm not trying to be that guy that's like, I was right.
1372780	1374820	But anyway.
1374820	1380300	And then they're revealing a new hero in this trailer as well, a new type of map that you
1380300	1384260	can fight on, like a push map, which is actually really funny.
1384260	1387220	Blizzard is a master at putting together these types of trailers.
1387220	1388560	You'll notice I'm not showing this.
1388560	1392660	I love this part of the trailer, the push mode where the little robot is like, I am
1392660	1396140	really good at pushing, like says these, it's really cute.
1396140	1399220	It's very Disney and it's very, very well done.
1399220	1402180	And you can't help but get goosebumps when you see something like this.
1402180	1405620	I mean, and if you're an Overwatch fan, I mean, double so.
1405620	1409260	This looks really, really, really good, I got to say.
1409260	1412500	You know, especially if you're an Overwatch fan.
1412500	1413500	Very interesting though.
1413500	1414500	Oh, and there we go.
1414500	1418620	And you know, a lot of folks out there saying, when are we going to get a black woman in
1418620	1420780	Overwatch?
1420780	1424860	And there we have people of color, women in Overwatch.
1424860	1431260	We don't have a black woman in Overwatch, but Blizzard did announce they're going to
1431260	1434860	handle that with us, is her name Sojour, Sojourne.
1434860	1436860	When are we going to goose in Overwatch, dammit?
1436860	1438060	I want the goose.
1438060	1439060	The goose?
1439060	1440060	The goose has to be in Overwatch.
1440060	1441060	Oh, for the goose game?
1441060	1442060	Yes.
1442060	1443540	I think the goose would be better suited for Smash.
1443540	1444540	Just saying.
1444540	1445540	All the games.
1445540	1446540	I don't care.
1446540	1447540	All of them.
1447540	1451380	Smash, Pokemon, Animal Crossing.
1451380	1455180	It turns out the goose is doing the pushing on the new Toronto map.
1455180	1456180	Anyway.
1456180	1459340	Uh, but no, I will say the game looks really good.
1459420	1465180	Here was the hot take I had on Twitter that, um, I don't know, I, I said that Overwatch
1465180	1472140	2, well, okay, here's why, because they mentioned, oh, if you have Overwatch 1, you can play
1472140	1477220	with people in Overwatch 2 and Overwatch 1 will still get the new heroes and it'll still
1477220	1482700	get, I think some of the new stuff, but it's not going to get the new play modes.
1482700	1486240	It's not going to have, like some stuff is still going to be locked out.
1486240	1490960	And I was kind of like, you know why this is so easy for Overwatch 2 to be cross play
1490960	1494880	with Overwatch 1, because it's an expansion.
1494880	1499460	It's a really well branded expansion to Overwatch 1.
1499460	1501200	That's not a bad thing, y'all.
1501200	1502200	Don't come for me.
1502200	1503200	Okay.
1503200	1504200	I didn't send for you.
1504200	1505200	Okay.
1505200	1506200	It's, it's not a bad thing.
1506200	1511160	And I think we see this type of thing happen quite often in the sports game world, right?
1511160	1514920	But an Overwatch is a giant e-sport.
1515280	1519000	You know, who's an expert at reselling old content.
1519000	1520560	I'll give you a hint.
1520560	1524280	It's part of the company name.
1524280	1526840	So that's a, that's an Activision playbook.
1526840	1527840	Yeah. Right.
1527840	1532800	Um, so you know what I, I, and maybe under the hood, maybe it is a sequel, maybe it is
1532800	1535580	an all new graphical engine or something under the hood.
1535580	1540680	I'm glad that at least letting your like, you know, skins and stuff transfer over because
1540680	1543560	if it were Activision, it would just make you buy those things again.
1543560	1546960	But I, you know, well, and you know, hello, let's celebrate that.
1546960	1548100	That is something to note.
1548100	1553040	And I think it is, it, I will say this, that's actually not shade.
1553040	1556480	What I'm saying there is that, oh, Overwatch 2 is kind of like an expansion for Overwatch
1556480	1557480	1.
1557480	1564120	It actually does seem like the smart and only possible way to not so much fragment the fan
1564120	1570600	base, especially when you're still trying to push this Overwatch league thing.
1570600	1575900	And how is the Overwatch league going to, like, let's say Overwatch 2 did come out and
1575900	1579040	it was a completely new engine, completely new game.
1579040	1581800	Didn't work with the first game or anything because it's all new stuff.
1581800	1585400	It would be like, how would you, which game would they play in Overwatch league?
1585400	1586720	What would, how would they sell it?
1586720	1590160	Like would they just completely leave Overwatch 1 behind and say, oh, it's all about that
1590160	1591160	Overwatch 2 shit.
1591160	1596360	Now I don't understand if the Overwatch loyalists features that they're adding are PvE.
1596360	1597360	Who cares?
1597360	1600560	Like if it fragments, it's not, I love the PvE stuff.
1600560	1604520	But yeah, but like, I don't see how this would, this wouldn't be any different than
1604520	1608760	just selling an expansion except now they can sell it for like $40 instead of $20.
1608760	1614800	Well, and there are there to be fair, it's not solely PvE because there are new PvP map
1614800	1621040	types and those will be, uh, locked such as a new map and world of Warcraft will be locked
1621040	1625880	if you don't get the shadow lands expansion when that comes out, because that's how expansions
1625880	1629000	work cash grab to me.
1629440	1632760	I actually completely disagree with as critical as I've been a blizzard.
1632760	1635520	I don't say, I don't think it's a cash grab.
1635520	1638200	I think this is very blizzards model.
1638200	1641880	They do, they do expansions with Diablo all the time.
1641880	1644160	They do expansions with world of Warcraft.
1644160	1645960	They do expansions with Warcraft 3.
1645960	1650160	No, no, I'm not saying that I'm not saying that's wrong that they do an expansion.
1650160	1652760	I'm talking about, yes, I have Overwatch 1.
1652760	1657760	I buy an expansion for the adds additional content to the game.
1657760	1659400	Yes, I understand what an expansion is.
1659400	1665120	This is, hey, you like this game while you want the additional content to re-buy the
1665120	1667480	whole fucking game again is what I mean.
1667480	1671440	I actually don't think it's that at all because they are saying the original Overwatch will
1671440	1677600	still get the new heroes and enough to be cross compatible with Overwatch 2.
1677600	1681760	It's just if you want these extra PvE, you want these extra new skins, you want these
1681760	1686920	new PvP modes, then you're going to have to buy this expansion, which is called 2.
1686960	1697200	Arguably this expansion is going to be the cost of a full game versus what I feel DLC
1697200	1700000	would be priced at.
1700000	1705240	I'm going to some comments over at twitch.tv slash vog network and Bobby does say clearly
1705240	1706240	they didn't announce price.
1706240	1708320	I figured they did because again, we're a year out.
1708320	1713120	I mean, games prices may change overall in a year, who knows at least.
1713120	1717560	Matt Defton chat says PvE is what Overwatch needed so badly.
1717560	1721800	Fifth Dream Today says just pull a DOA and make 3000 of the same DLC for the next game.
1721800	1726960	S2100 Matt says the PvE stuff they did in Overwatch was one was only for a limited time
1726960	1729280	and was limited in what they did with it.
1729280	1732640	From what they are showing, this broadens everything.
1732640	1737120	Quest Buster says, speaking of fragmentation, Activision also wanted to avoid fragmenting
1737120	1741360	the base with the new Modern Warfare and the upcoming content with free maps and no season
1741360	1742360	passes.
1742360	1747000	Ooh, I like this comment from Matt Deft who says what we suggested on GFM cast is that
1747000	1753520	probably Overwatch one is going free to play or that Overwatch two will include Overwatch
1753520	1754520	one for free.
1754520	1756320	Well, I think it kind of has to.
1756320	1762480	I think Overwatch two by default kind of has to, but I really like that theory that Overwatch
1762480	1764880	one might just straight up go free to play.
1764880	1766480	I don't think it will.
1766480	1769880	I I'm not going to be so quick to shoot that theory down.
1769880	1771080	I'm not going to say, Oh, you're right.
1771080	1772080	You're right.
1772840	1775440	I don't think it'll happen at the same time.
1775440	1778440	I think Overwatch two will come out first.
1778440	1783280	Then maybe after a year, that might be like the long-term plan.
1783280	1786280	I could see that, but I don't know.
1786280	1787280	We'll see.
1787280	1789640	So that's Overwatch two.
1789640	1793120	You know, again, Blizzard does a great job at putting together the trailers, really kind
1793120	1795480	of hit you in the feels with all that stuff.
1795480	1801040	And you know, yeah, like I, I would love to play the PvE stuff in Overwatch, quite frankly.
1801040	1803040	So I'm curious to hear more about that.
1803040	1807320	And then of course, the other big reveal, the thing I didn't grab video for was World
1807320	1811040	of Warcraft Shadowlands, just because, you know, we do have a lot, a lot, a lot of news
1811040	1815040	to get into tonight, so I can't do all the BlizzCon stuff, but yes, there is a new World
1815040	1816200	of Warcraft expansion coming.
1816200	1817200	It's called Shadowlands.
1817200	1821840	You know, it's going to allow you to level your character from 50 to 60.
1821840	1822840	Why?
1822840	1825120	Because the level squish is incoming.
1825120	1830080	So a current level 120 character will be squished to level 50.
1830080	1833880	And it's going to be very interesting because apparently you're going to level to 10 in
1833880	1834880	a new zone.
1834880	1839280	And then from 10 to 50, you can level in any of the expansions because it was getting to
1839280	1840320	be too much.
1840320	1842820	Like I kind of figured this had to be coming.
1842820	1847920	Like Warcraft has had so many expansions now that like, if you want to level an alt, it
1847920	1849860	can really be a slog.
1849860	1853400	So I actually think this is a good thing.
1853400	1855760	It's just going to be interesting to see how this plays out.
1855760	1859400	But they're saying that everything, I mean, like you're not going to get screwed out of
1859400	1863760	being able to hunt for transmog gear and stuff.
1863760	1867880	Like you can still run the old dungeons and really overpower it.
1867880	1873160	I think the official lines was something like, we want the level ups to feel more meaningful
1873160	1875120	in scale and blah, blah, blah.
1875120	1880680	But the reality is like, it's like if they had up the level cap to 130, it's too fucking
1880680	1881680	much.
1881680	1885840	This takes too long and it's too much of a slog through old ass expansions.
1885840	1886840	So you know what?
1886840	1889240	I honestly think this is actually a better idea.
1889240	1890240	So cool.
1890240	1896320	Anyway, but the other big game that was announced, of course, was finally Diablo 4.
1896320	1902100	And here's some gameplay of Diablo 4 that they showed, which, you know, looks very similar
1902100	1904480	to any other Diablo game I've seen.
1904480	1908080	But it just, you know, you can see the years of upgraded graphics and so forth.
1908080	1911240	A lot of people are talking about how the new Diablo has like a darker tone.
1911240	1917160	I don't know if I, I guess, I mean, it's, I think people hate on Diablo 3 too much,
1917160	1918320	to be quite honest.
1918320	1925000	I don't think what I'm seeing in this Diablo 4 is like some massive color palette shift
1925000	1926260	from Diablo 3.
1926260	1927520	I don't see that.
1927520	1932440	What I do see is riding horsies and I do see the druid shifting into a bear, which looked
1932440	1933440	really cool.
1933440	1937980	And I think a lot of those classes are coming back and yeah, I mean, I, I've always been
1937980	1940200	a big fan of the Diablo games.
1940200	1945500	It took a little bit for Diablo 3 to get there, but it got there and it's really fun to play.
1945500	1948140	And I'm curious to hear more about Diablo 4.
1948140	1951940	I think it is still like really early on me again, it looks really good.
1951940	1957140	We see things in the snow and, you know, we do see like a real kind of varied amount of
1957140	1960520	different environments that the Diablo game is taking place in.
1960520	1962940	So that does seem really cool.
1963100	1968500	I think one thing that they did very well in Diablo 3 was that they really created this
1968500	1973540	end game in the expansion with running the rifts and all that stuff that of course they
1973540	1978260	didn't really have time to get into with this Diablo 4 discussion and everything that they
1978260	1981380	were showing at BlizzCon with Diablo 4.
1981380	1984580	You know, because there's just so much to get into with the game and they probably want
1984580	1988020	to focus a little bit on the story mode and the base and the demo that people were going
1988020	1989500	to play while they were there.
1989500	1992860	So they're not ready to talk about end game yet because this game is still forever out
1992860	1993980	and that's fine.
1993980	1997780	But I'm curious to hear more about that when the time gets closer.
1997780	2003580	But this will be the thing that I will really want to get so why I am, believe it or not,
2003580	2008540	really rooting for Blizzard to make those internal changes they need to take and for
2008540	2014260	Jay Allen to mean it when he says he's going to take accountability and shift those changes
2014260	2018020	the way they need to be shifted so that I can feel good about buying Diablo 4 when it
2018020	2020540	comes out because it does look pretty hot.
2020540	2024640	And honestly I'll probably buy Overwatch 2 as well with the same bullet point that
2024640	2026820	I put on the last one.
2026820	2029660	Any thoughts on Diablo 4 from you guys and our chat?
2029660	2032220	It looks pretty but it's more fucking Diablo.
2032220	2034420	But is more fucking Diablo a bad thing?
2034420	2040100	I don't know, I got bored with Diablo 3, I got bored with Diablo 2, just Diablo is kind
2040100	2041100	of boring.
2041100	2047340	The clicks and destruction and loot and gold, it's very soothing in a weird way.
2047340	2052700	It didn't gather any of my interest, it really didn't.
2052700	2057580	Loki, I don't think you've really ever super been into Diablo but now what I didn't show
2057580	2062300	here was there was a very long cinematic that was very gory and so forth.
2062300	2065340	And you know what, Blizzard's cinematics team always does a great job.
2065340	2067980	I just didn't show it here because it wasn't the game.
2067980	2075100	But it was a great announced trailer and it always baffles my mind why the Blizzard cinematics
2075100	2078060	team just doesn't make a movie.
2078060	2080380	Imagine if they had just made the World of Warcraft movie.
2080380	2082780	It would probably have been better than it was.
2082780	2084660	Honestly, it very much might have.
2084660	2086580	So I don't know what's up with that.
2086580	2090920	Thank you, now I just remembered that they made a Warcraft movie.
2090920	2094080	You know what movie they ought to- I liked it by the way, I liked the movie.
2094080	2097740	I didn't think it was terrible but here's the thing.
2097740	2102940	The movie they ought to make, Blizzard's cinematic team ought to make an Overwatch movie.
2102940	2106060	I really think that's a missed opportunity.
2106060	2109860	It seems ridiculous that that- maybe that's a thing that will happen in a few years.
2109860	2116780	But an Overwatch movie seems like the biggest opportunity that they're not taking.
2116780	2118420	I don't know why they share movies now.
2118420	2123140	You know who kind of picked up on that opportunity and decided to go ahead and run with that?
2123140	2124140	Riot Games.
2124140	2125860	Did you see their announcement?
2125860	2126860	No I didn't.
2126860	2130500	So Riot Games, they always do these really cool cinematics and music videos and stuff
2130500	2133220	around their League of Legends tournaments and everything.
2133220	2140820	So now they have their animation studio working on a series called Arcane which is their animated
2140820	2145180	series that kind of ties in all the cinematics that they've been doing.
2145180	2146620	But they do some pretty awesome stuff.
2146620	2150780	I remember the KDA music video and everything and they've had a bunch of cool things that
2150780	2151780	they put out.
2151780	2154380	So I'm looking forward to anything that they've done.
2154380	2155860	But yes, they should do that too.
2155860	2158660	I think it would be very fitting.
2158660	2159660	Agree.
2159900	2165260	Now I want to get into something else that was posted on our Discord actually.
2165260	2167140	I want to talk a little bit about this.
2167140	2172860	So a shout out for our Discord server at voggenetwork.com slash Discord because sometimes you guys post
2172860	2173860	stories there.
2173860	2176300	This is kind of like a completely different note.
2176300	2179500	It's not necessarily about BlizzCon itself but I thought this was very interesting.
2179500	2182780	I wanted to get your guys' take on this including in our chat room.
2182780	2186260	But it's a story about the Overwatch 2 leak.
2186260	2189940	Now we've been off for the past two weeks so we did not get a chance to talk about the
2189940	2190940	leaks.
2190940	2194540	But I think most of you generally know at this point that it was pretty much out there
2194540	2199420	that Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2 were going to be happening because there was an ESPN related
2199420	2200420	leak with Overwatch.
2200420	2204980	There was like a foreign guide art book or something that leaked the Diablo 4.
2204980	2207060	But we knew these things were coming, right?
2207060	2210380	But there was an interesting interview with Jeff Kaplan who of course is the creative
2210380	2215100	guy behind Overwatch that talked about how those leaks were very frustrating for the
2215100	2217460	Overwatch 2 team.
2217460	2221340	Because what happened, here's the quote, our artists are heartbroken.
2221340	2224100	They take such care to make the art look beautiful.
2224100	2227620	And then we get some crappy version of what the art looks like, because somebody had like
2227620	2229520	taken a cell phone pic or something, I don't know.
2229520	2232460	And then people are like, I don't know, it doesn't look that good.
2232460	2233680	And we're like, no, it does.
2233680	2234680	It looks amazing.
2234680	2236620	It's just a crappy screenshot that someone took.
2236620	2239760	So it can be a bit demoralizing.
2239760	2244940	That's a very interesting comment, especially when you consider many people were theorizing
2244940	2249260	that the leaks were intentional on Blizzard's part to try to deflect.
2249260	2252180	I don't know if I buy into that, but I'll just put it out there because it is something
2252180	2253620	gamers are talking about.
2253620	2260700	That Blizzard potentially put those leaks out there themselves in order to get the focus
2260700	2265460	off of what was happening with the Hearthstone competition and the results.
2265460	2268200	And instead to talk about the future of Blizzard things.
2268200	2272420	So it's very interesting the whole leaks and how they can be damaging for the game.
2272420	2273420	What do you guys think?
2273420	2275140	Good thing or are leaks a bad thing?
2275140	2276140	Depends.
2276140	2277140	Depends.
2277140	2278140	It's good for me.
2278140	2281780	It's really, it's really situational because in some cases it builds hype for something
2281780	2284220	that makes people even more interested in it.
2284220	2285220	Yeah.
2285220	2292800	I mean, like for me, if there's a movie that I want to see, I might go look for like leaked
2292800	2297980	reviews or, you know, things like, or I might see like, does the dog die or something?
2297980	2303260	Well, I'm giggling because speaking of discord, I feel like, and I'm not being shady, I promise,
2303260	2307060	but I feel like every week there's the weekly tiger claw update on what's going on with
2307060	2312500	the Sonic the Hedgehog movie based off what's leaked from either a standee that showed up
2312500	2317020	in a cinema or what junkie XL doing the soundtrack has made a comment about the redesign.
2317020	2319860	I think that was the thing this week and so on and so on.
2319860	2325440	So it's interesting because I mean, you know, for, for fans and folks, even though I'm,
2325440	2329260	I'm very much, when it comes to that, I'm very much like, I'll wait for the new tree.
2329260	2331500	You had me at junkie XL doing the soundtrack.
2331740	2334860	I mean, that's already like that Jim Carrey being in it.
2334860	2336260	I mean, I totally see it.
2336260	2337420	So it's, so it's interesting.
2337420	2341460	So those leaks can sometimes be, uh, well, I just didn't realize he was doing the soundtrack.
2341460	2342940	That's okay.
2342940	2343980	But that is something, right?
2344340	2354620	So anyway, uh, let's see, uh, going to, uh, comment from YYR in our Twitch chat who says, uh,
2354620	2356820	leaks make a game healthier.
2356820	2361020	Green vegetables are great for your health because it's L E E K S get, get it.
2361500	2361820	Get it.
2361820	2362620	Thanks, dad.
2362820	2366100	YYR officially making dad jokes in the chat.
2366100	2366580	Thank you.
2366580	2368660	Officially, um, act.
2368660	2371820	Defton chat says speaking of leaks, how about them Pokemon leaks?
2372020	2373980	Well, that's one that's going on right now, right?
2374220	2379820	I know some people are trying to avoid those leaks, so I'm not going to get into them in great detail.
2379940	2384500	I will just point out, I have a text message from Shane about an hour ago talking about that.
2384500	2386380	I guess the pokey decks has leaked.
2386500	2390620	So I'm like, which Pokemon got cut and he's kind of explaining it to me again.
2390620	2392980	I'm going to respect the wishes of those that are trying to avoid the leaks.
2393140	2399260	So I don't want to get into those details, but, um, I mean, it is causing us to talk about Pokemon and get that
2399260	2401180	whole like hype building a little bit there.
2401380	2406820	I mean, in Shane's case, not that any additional hype is needed, but I suppose, you know, I'm a little bit more of a
2406820	2408580	filthy casual when it comes to Pokemon.
2408700	2412660	So talking about it does make me go, oh yeah, that Pokemon games in like two weeks.
2412660	2413900	It's going to be here before I know it.
2414020	2414900	Crazy stuff.
2415220	2416660	So anyway.
2417620	2418620	All right.
2420260	2425140	Bobby Blackwood from chat says, how do you know when a joke becomes a dad joke when it becomes a parent?
2426700	2427220	All right.
2427220	2427660	Anyway,
2429500	2430180	womp, womp.
2430180	2431860	All right, uh, let's move on.
2431860	2439340	We've spent a long time on that topic, but there's, that's honestly, I feel like outside of Blizzcon, that's like all anybody's been talking about this weekend.
2439620	2443180	There is some other stuff that's been going on in the world that we will get into.
2443500	2445820	Um, but we were gone for a couple of weeks, right?
2445820	2448780	This is our first show back since I think October 13th.
2449180	2451700	Um, not completely by our design.
2451980	2460020	Um, I'll explain a little bit more about that in a moment, but I thought we could take an opportunity to talk about what were some of the big headlines we missed in our time off.
2460020	2463820	So Loki, what were some of the things we missed while we were gone for two weeks?
2464100	2475780	Um, so apparently we have a new system coming out from analog, so they're doing a portable system that looks kind of like a original Game Boy, but it plays most portable games.
2476060	2477980	I've reached out to try to get a demo, by the way.
2478540	2479060	Oh.
2479460	2481180	Um, so it looks pretty awesome.
2481180	2486020	It's got like a 1600 by 1440 resolution, three and a half inch screen.
2486260	2496020	It plays Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance games out of the gate, and then they're going to have adapters for the game gear, Neo Geo Pocket Color, Atari Lynx, and more.
2496300	2504620	And with the, you know, resolutions on the screen, I can imagine they could play quite a bit more, but the system's going to cost $200 and it's coming out sometime in 2020.
2504860	2505980	And it looks so nice.
2506540	2509900	I mean, I'm not even really interested in handheld games, but I kind of want one.
2509900	2518900	I feel like I have so many like retro things that like, as neat as this looks, I'm like, if I have, if I buy one more of these things, honestly, I need less shit in this house, not more.
2519460	2521140	Well, this plays like original cartridges.
2521140	2532620	This isn't like one of those, you know, uh, classic mini systems or anything like that, which really I'm surprised Nintendo's not doing a classic mini Game Boy or something like that, but I guess we'll have to wait and see on that.
2533100	2538780	Um, so then Capcom also mentioned that they want to bring back some old dead franchises.
2538860	2541900	Uh, one that sounds like they may be batting around is Akami.
2541900	2544100	So we may see a new Akami game pretty soon.
2544540	2553860	And apparently, uh, Japanese arcade, Anata no Warehouse is closing down and they apparently were pretty legendary interesting arcade.
2554060	2560700	Um, and it's unfortunate that they're going down because of a change to the sales tax laws in Japan.
2561700	2563140	And let's see what else.
2563860	2574740	So we had some announcements regarding, um, Panzer Dragoon remake is getting a physical edition, which I know that was teased also come into PC.
2574780	2576460	Yeah, I'm excited about that.
2576500	2577780	That's a pretty soon, isn't it?
2578180	2578820	I think so.
2578860	2579620	Yeah, I think so too.
2579620	2582460	I think it is a holiday for this year game, believe it or not.
2582740	2585420	Uh, now that Halloween's over, we're in the holidays.
2585420	2588140	Apparently some people say we've skipped Thanksgiving.
2588220	2590940	I've always kind of considered Thanksgiving a holiday.
2591140	2594180	So I sort of thought this period was always the holidays.
2594380	2605180	I kind of got mad, like, like, or at least an annoyed look in my face the other day because it was like the middle of October and they were wearing Santa hats at the grocery store I went to to get a sandwich.
2605180	2606980	I'm like, really?
2607300	2609260	Like it's not even fucking Halloween yet.
2609260	2609620	Really?
2609620	2611180	You got fucking Santa hats?
2611180	2612100	I mean, what the hell?
2612300	2612780	Back to games.
2612900	2613420	Anyway, sorry.
2613820	2616860	Um, so then what else?
2616900	2619940	Uh, they're going to have used to acknowledge your weird pagan holiday.
2621540	2625420	They're going to be doing physical releases of the Aladdin and Lion King games.
2625460	2626980	Uh, yeah, I heard about that.
2627340	2629900	Uh, so those are going to be coming out as well.
2629940	2635620	Uh, I'm surprised the licensing got all worked out for that, especially how both those movies got the real life remakes.
2635860	2641980	Disney's been some real dicks too about their old properties, especially the stuff they just got from Fox.
2642180	2659420	There's this whole thing, and I don't want to deviate too much from games, but I think this is kind of adjacent because like, like there would be cinemas in town that would do like late night screenings of the princess bride or Ghostbusters or, and I don't, you know, like all these, I don't even know if those are actually Fox or Disney, but like classic movies and stuff.
2659420	2659660	Right?
2659780	2659980	Yeah.
2660020	2661140	Disney's pulled all that.
2661220	2667420	They're not allowing theaters to show those old movies anymore with one notable exception.
2667420	2673980	There is one exception that they haven't touched, and that's a little movie called the Rocky Horror Picture Show, which is still a Fox movie.
2673980	2689740	And I think, I think the reason why is because they know if they touch that they're going to be fucked with a capital F because there will be some angry cross dressers out there acting out the rock or picture show, which I've been a proud member of that scene for a long, long time.
2689980	2692100	Uh, that will be very upset at that whole thing.
2692100	2697220	So, uh, I think Disney is rightfully so stayed away from the rock or picture show.
2697220	2700660	But everything else they've been like not renewing rights, not granting.
2700860	2702940	And it's all because of fucking Disney Plus.
2704060	2706980	Because why, why go to the theater to see it when you can buy Disney Plus?
2706980	2710980	Well, it's kind of like, that's the other thing that kind of annoying for me.
2710980	2719100	Cause most of the MCU, this next phase of it is they're Disney Plus shows, which I'm like, okay, well, the cinematic universe.
2719100	2725780	I kind of was hoping more than being the cinemas, but I guess TV now, cinematic universe, whatever.
2726740	2731180	Tiger Claw says, I'm sure you're still giddy that the rock your picture show is now a Disney movie.
2731340	2737100	Actually, Tiger Claw, I feel the exact opposite of that remark, especially in light of everything I just talked about.
2737500	2741060	Fuck Disney right now with a whole lot of this, this sucks.
2741900	2749540	I was going to get Disney Plus, but now I kind of don't want to because I don't want to support this.
2749980	2752620	Oh, there goes Rob again, talking about boycotts.
2752860	2757020	I don't know if it's, it's not a, I don't think it's a boycott so much as it is.
2757340	2758580	I don't want to buy that.
2759500	2761060	Yeah, I don't want to buy that.
2762140	2768100	So they did a piece on Conan O'Brien about Death Stranding in his visit to Kojima Studios.
2768100	2771580	And of course, predictably so, he's in the game.
2772420	2773340	So that's awesome.
2774780	2777820	Last of Us 2 got delayed to spring of 2020.
2777820	2779100	I heard it got another little delay.
2779100	2780020	That's all right.
2780020	2784740	Well, you know, honestly, again, if you need the delay to get it right, delay it.
2784780	2785260	Cool.
2785660	2785980	Yep.
2786420	2787620	And then, um,
2787620	2789340	We should start celebrating delays.
2790220	2796820	We should, I maybe I'm going to put that on the list of things to do, uh, make a bumper to celebrate video game delays.
2797180	2799100	I'm going to, I'll get on that for 2020.
2799740	2800100	Okay.
2801020	2809060	And then I was going to say, um, last but not least, uh, let's see, we'll talk about how Sony has confirmed that PlayStation,
2809060	2813100	um, six through 10 in Japan, at least the trademarks for those are in place.
2813460	2815620	I think we're actually getting into that a little later in tonight's show.
2815620	2816900	Well, now I spoiled it for you.
2816900	2818380	So there you go.
2818420	2819660	We'll come into it a little later.
2819740	2821740	See how it says this week at the top of that.
2821740	2822780	That's whatever.
2822780	2823100	You know what?
2823100	2824300	I'm not paying attention to this shit.
2825740	2826180	All right.
2826260	2829860	Anyway, our shows as broken as WWE 2K20.
2832660	2833020	All right.
2833020	2835820	Let's get into, uh, another segment here.
2835820	2838740	We're gonna talk a little bit about our gaming weeks, but we're gonna do it a little bit
2838740	2842580	differently because, um, we've been gone for three weeks, so there's been a lot going on.
2842580	2844980	So I want to do a segment called how is your week?
2844980	2845900	How is your day?
2845940	2850180	And those long time OLR fans may recognize that name.
2850180	2855820	I've brought it back from the dead, uh, tonight just because it's been so long and I know a lot has been going on.
2855820	2862300	So first collectively before I go to dark soccer, because of course I'll, I'll let her go first, but generally I want to speak to what happened to the show.
2862500	2872380	So, um, two weeks ago we knew we weren't going to be here kind of because I found out for work about two or three weeks prior I was going to need to be gone.
2872380	2878940	I was going to be on my way to Vegas for some work related things and I had to fly out on a Sunday because it started Monday morning.
2879100	2880860	So we knew two weeks ago we wouldn't be here.
2880860	2882580	The reality is day job.
2882780	2883980	Most important thing.
2884020	2888380	It pays the bills without this, the lights aren't on, so got to do the J job stuff.
2888380	2890180	So I think y'all understand and know about that.
2890580	2895900	Last week was a little shittier because believe it or not, we were pre, we were here, we were prepping to do a show.
2895900	2896820	We were all going to be here.
2896820	2897580	It was going to be great.
2897580	2898620	We're going to do the show.
2898620	2905220	And then, um, we had some crazy ass wind here in the Sacramento area and really up and down California.
2905420	2910140	I'm sure you guys have heard about those really horrific fires that have been happening up and down the state.
2910460	2915020	Um, and, uh, luckily not so much here in our area in Sacramento.
2915020	2924260	Yes, there were some fires in Sacramento, but I don't believe any structures or most importantly, people, maybe a few structures, but no people in the Sacramento area.
2924260	2928460	So for the most part, we were fine, except I'm so glad there wasn't any spontaneous combustion.
2928780	2932380	The, the problem was is those high winds killed the cable.
2932860	2936660	And so without the cable, we couldn't broadcast our show on Twitch.
2936940	2942940	And I did give thought to, well, we could all sit here and at least record something and we could just put it on the podcast feed.
2943100	2949380	But the problem is without cable, we can't pull up our stories to look at and do that whole thing.
2949500	2951020	And it just would have been really weird.
2951060	2953500	And honestly, guys, the whole thing was really frustrating.
2953500	2954620	So I was just like, fuck it.
2954620	2956380	We're just not going to do OLR again tonight.
2956780	2959140	So thank God we're here tonight because I shit you not.
2959140	2961020	Do you know what happened at one o'clock earlier today?
2961180	2965700	The power went out for about, luckily it was only about 15 minutes.
2965860	2971260	But like I wrote this tweet that thankfully didn't go through probably because the power outage was probably trying to send it to my router or something.
2971580	2972740	Well, no, because the router would've been off.
2972740	2973940	But for whatever reason, it didn't send.
2974100	2976900	And it said, you've got to be fucking kidding me.
2976900	2977940	The power just went out.
2977940	2980700	It's like, God does not want to hear any more OLR.
2981580	2983380	God is done with this show.
2983820	2984500	The end.
2985260	2987180	Thankfully, power came back on 15 minutes later.
2988380	2990420	So a crisis averted and here we are.
2990420	2990860	Hooray.
2991740	2995500	I will warn you guys, though, next week, guess what?
2995700	2996860	I'm not going to be here live.
2996860	2998340	But here's the thing.
2998420	3001860	I've been planning a trip to New York City for like six months.
3002100	3004740	I'm my gay ass is going to see some Broadway.
3004940	3006380	I'm fucking hyped about it.
3006580	3008140	You know, sorry, not sorry.
3008140	3008940	But here's the thing.
3009140	3011660	Luckily, we're able to make it work myself.
3011660	3012700	Dark Soccer Loki.
3012700	3016740	We're going to tape a special show midweek and we're going to air that on Sunday.
3016740	3020740	So we're going to do an OLR bonus stage episode this weekend.
3020740	3022940	And that will also go on the podcast feed, of course.
3023100	3027500	So it'll be a lot easier than it was to miss two shows in a row.
3027500	3028820	But that's why we've been gone.
3029540	3031340	It's very nice to be back because, of course,
3031540	3035620	it's very frustrating to not be here for a couple of weeks.
3035820	3037100	I will say a couple of things that have
3037300	3040620	happened housekeeping wise on the VOG network front.
3040820	3045900	Our Discord server is now a boosted server because a very kind individual just
3046100	3050340	got Discord Nitro and used his two boosts on the VOG network server.
3050540	3053020	So now we have the higher sound quality and all that fun stuff.
3053220	3055420	And you can use the can you use the emote?
3055420	3058060	No, I think that's that I can do that because I'm a Nitro person.
3058140	3060260	It's supposed to unlock more stuff.
3060460	3062260	Bottom line, join the VOG network Discord,
3062460	3069220	VOG network dot com slash Discord, that's VOG network dot com slash Discord.
3069420	3071540	Act F says God wanted OLR.
3071540	3073260	That's because the power went back that fast.
3073260	3077020	Yes, that's true. Bobby Blackwolf says the final premiere.
3077220	3080860	Yeah, because Twitch TV premieres are going away on November 12th.
3081060	3082620	And
3082820	3086020	Kaijuto in chat says you guys need to let Bobby fill in for you.
3086140	3088500	I'm sure he won't mind recording for four hours.
3088700	3092580	I actually I think Bobby actually would mind that maybe if he had some co-hosts
3092580	3097100	to help him, but I don't know if he'd want to go for four hours unless he gets
3097100	3100380	Tommy Tallarico on his show next week, then he'll be fine going for four hours.
3100580	3102980	Yeah, Tommy could go for like ten hours, so that's fine.
3103180	3104700	That's no shade. I love Tommy.
3104900	3107860	And I want to hear all about his in television, which has no shade.
3108060	3112500	But he certainly talks because he's enthusiastic about what he's talking about.
3112700	3113620	Let's see. So, yeah.
3113620	3115820	And D'Artesia says, so not numbered?
3116020	3120340	No, we're not going to number the next show because I'm specifically delaying
3120540	3123460	episode eight hundred until December 1st.
3123660	3124940	So that way,
3125140	3131140	episode eight hundred is the same month as our one year anniversary on Twitch.
3131340	3134740	I don't want to say too much about this right now because I don't know what will
3134740	3137940	be in place or what won't be in place, but behind the scenes,
3138140	3142940	we're plotting a sort of soft relaunch, if you will, of Orange Lounge Radio,
3142940	3146500	because reality is, you know, there's a lot of great people
3146500	3148540	out there that are still listening and so forth.
3148540	3151620	But we've really been kind of struggling to get the word out about our show,
3151820	3155420	get some of the longtime listeners from a long time ago to come back.
3155420	3158620	And I bet a lot of people don't even know we're on Twitch now and so forth.
3158620	3159860	So we want to do kind of like just like
3160060	3164500	a soft relaunch and kind of a creative reboot, if you will, of our show.
3164620	3167380	Not saying we're going to like change everything and so forth,
3167580	3171580	but maybe there'll be some new art, maybe some new promo pics of us,
3171580	3172380	because it's been a while.
3172420	3174420	I'm going to stop wearing pants.
3174620	3176820	Maybe we'll wear pants, maybe not.
3177020	3179620	Maybe we'll have some new sound effects,
3179620	3181300	maybe some new videos and things like that.
3181500	3184220	So just some creative kind of like, you know, like a makeover.
3184420	3186300	Who doesn't love a makeover, right?
3186500	3189380	Y'all watch your daytime TV and see those fabulous makeovers.
3189580	3191660	That's what we're looking at for episode number eight hundred.
3191860	3195860	So anyway, Sia Tabiri says smush cam.
3196060	3197580	Don't count anything out.
3197780	3198980	Don't count anything out.
3199140	3200140	All right.
3200340	3203060	Dark Tits Sia says hashtag bring back the soundboard.
3203260	3206740	I can give that an enthusiastic no.
3206940	3209580	All right. Anyway, let's move on with how is your week?
3209580	3210220	How is your day?
3210420	3213300	Dark Sakura, you've had a bit going on.
3213340	3213900	I have.
3213900	3215620	I'm actually surprised you're here tonight.
3215620	3218260	And I don't mean that in a shady way, but you know why I'm saying that.
3218460	3221260	Well, and I'll just go ahead and come out with it.
3221260	3222820	But I'm not going to define what it is.
3223020	3226660	I had a salpingectomy, salpingectomy.
3226860	3228740	Look it up if you care.
3229220	3232820	But I it was a laparoscopic procedure.
3233020	3234900	I had it on Wednesday.
3235100	3238020	I'm on my last bit of medication for it.
3238220	3239820	So, yeah, I hurt quite a bit,
3240020	3243260	but I couldn't miss this after not having been here for two years.
3243460	3244420	Two years.
3244620	3245740	You're definitely on drugs.
3245940	3247340	Definitely. Oh, my God.
3247540	3250420	Well, OK, so they gave me the big oxy.
3250460	3252460	Right. And I've never taken it before.
3252660	3254140	Oh, that's fun.
3254340	3255700	I've never taken it before.
3255700	3259060	And like for for like a while, I'm like, I don't feel anything.
3259260	3263660	I don't feel anything. Oh, oh, oh.
3263860	3266580	And then that's that's what it's been like on that shit.
3266780	3268060	By the way, thank you to our soccer,
3268060	3271580	because when you came to the show, you brought me a little bag of candy corn,
3271580	3274940	which you talked about on the last hour, a little bag of maple candy corn.
3274940	3277220	So I'm feeling my Canadian self tonight.
3277220	3279780	I'm actually not Canadian at all, but I love Canada so much.
3279980	3283740	This maple candy corn is really good store just for you.
3283740	3284900	OK, but what cracks me up,
3284940	3288540	it's in the same type of packaging that like trail mix would be in.
3288740	3290580	It's like not a big bag of candy corn,
3290580	3292940	but it's one of those like little snack bags of candy corn.
3293140	3295020	So that was funny. The only size I saw that.
3295020	3297980	And I got you the other thing, the other thing that you never get.
3297980	3299980	Oh, yeah, I love vanilla tootsie rolls.
3299980	3301780	So she brought me a whole thing of them.
3301980	3303220	I found those trick or treat.
3303420	3305060	But by the way, would you dress up?
3305140	3307140	Oh, you didn't do Halloween because I did procedure.
3307140	3308820	Oh, did it work? What'd you do?
3309020	3313540	OK, so I got at the thrift store because I thrift for everything now because I
3313580	3315660	don't know what fucking fits me and I'm cheap.
3315860	3319780	So I got it was like a Forever 21 skater dress, like three quarter sleeve.
3319980	3322580	But it had it was black with pentagrams all over it.
3322780	3325500	So I wore that and my woven witch hat.
3325700	3328980	I'll find a picture and put it in chat or something.
3329180	3331660	And then just did like hardcore, really awesome makeup.
3331860	3334340	And I made cookies.
3334540	3337540	My cookies were I got
3338220	3339780	dehydrated strawberries.
3339940	3342340	So I took half of the big bag of them
3342340	3345300	and just powdered them to make my flavoring in my sugar cookies.
3345500	3350020	And the other half I soaked in water and they got kind of leathery and chewy,
3350220	3353580	you know, like when you get the pink drink at Starbucks, it's the same thing.
3353780	3355140	They get kind of leathery and chewy.
3355340	3357340	And so I add a lot of red food dye to it.
3357340	3359300	And I made visceral cookies because it
3359500	3362380	was kind of like what I would imagine eating intestines like.
3362580	3366100	So I made visceral cookies and had everybody
3366100	3367820	with like red mouths and everything from the food dye.
3367820	3368940	It was pretty cool.
3369180	3370860	And I'm still waiting for Detroit Become
3371060	3374460	Human to come out on an epic thingy, so it's not out.
3374660	3378340	I did get my legit physical copy of River City Girls.
3378540	3380500	And so Dan and I are going to play that.
3380500	3382660	We talked about setting up the stream and everything.
3382660	3384580	But like right now, I'd probably just
3384780	3387540	start falling over into a giggle fit trying to play it.
3387740	3389180	And I'm back into Sims.
3389180	3391420	I've been playing Sims with my computer being a little shit.
3391620	3395260	So I've already put together my next computer.
3395260	3396260	It's going to be great.
3396260	3397620	I'm getting an iMac Pro.
3397620	3399340	It's about four grand, has sixty four
3399540	3401580	gig of RAM with a really nice graphics card.
3401780	3404300	And it will be well enough that I can
3404300	3406260	do it for still playing some of my other games.
3406460	3408180	Buy me one too.
3409740	3412460	Did y'all can't see the look I'm giving Rob right now.
3412660	3416140	And it's called, do you know how much sushi you'd have to buy me?
3416340	3419860	Four thousand dollars, four thousand dollars worth, two hundred and sixty
3420060	3422660	dollars worth of pudding. I was just in Vegas.
3422860	3426900	So the type with the real gold flakes on it, the edible ones.
3426900	3429620	Also, you know what I just did before I came here?
3429820	3432500	But I had chocolate with edible gold in it.
3432700	3434540	Yum, it was great. Good times.
3434740	3438620	And you've also given me candy and coffee while I'm kind of high.
3438820	3442300	So I just want to make sure you are in a good mood for tonight.
3442500	3443820	I'm in a mood. All right.
3444020	3445300	I'm in some kind of mood.
3445500	3447220	I love everybody.
3447420	3449340	Mostly Loki. How was your week?
3449340	3450500	How was your day?
3450700	3452220	What you dress up as for Halloween?
3452420	3454860	I had well for work.
3454900	3458860	They made us do well, they wanted me to do like an 80s costume.
3459060	3462300	So I went to the Halloween store the night before Halloween.
3462500	3464620	And the first costume I saw that reminded
3464820	3467980	me of the 80s was a double dare contestant costume.
3468180	3470100	That's awesome. Did you get pics?
3470300	3471740	I didn't see any.
3471940	3476980	I took a picture of the costume, like, but it's great because not only do I get
3476980	3480340	to wear this costume for one day because it was really just like a T-shirt and like
3480540	3484380	some elbow pads and they have like a helmet and stuff with like a magnetic cup.
3484420	3486420	It's like the cup that they normally wear
3486420	3488380	on top of their head when they're filling it full of crap.
3488580	3489380	Yeah. Yeah.
3489580	3493060	So but now I have a double dare T-shirt that I can wear any time.
3493060	3495820	So it's like the kids shirts and the wife a shirt.
3495820	3497140	And you guys could have been family. Yeah.
3497140	3499700	They didn't have they only had it like the adult sizes.
3499900	3501260	So they had large and extra large.
3501460	3503980	So I and there was like two left.
3503980	3505380	I'm shocked you didn't get a picture.
3505580	3506700	Yeah, I should have.
3506700	3509340	But I got to go get my costume and get my costume.
3509340	3513180	OK, because mine's very so I'm going to go get it for the people.
3513180	3515860	OK, why you continue to tell us about your week and your day.
3516060	3517100	All right.
3517300	3521380	So my week I did well, I mean, it was a lot of Halloween stuff.
3521580	3526740	So like the first week that we weren't here, I went to we had like a local
3526740	3529700	haunted house that we took the kids to and that was all right.
3529900	3533020	And then the kids went trick or treating on Halloween.
3533220	3537820	And we did all that. And what else?
3538020	3541340	I mean, we did some school field trip,
3541340	3546140	so I have been playing a lot of Pokemon Go and Ingress because I was up in Grass
3546340	3550660	Valley and there's a bunch of portals and stuff that I have never tagged before.
3550860	3552620	So I say, yeah, what the hell?
3552820	3554260	Because this is boring.
3554460	3557300	So I'm going to do this as I walk around.
3557500	3560980	And then other games I actually played to I played more Borderlands three.
3561180	3564420	So I think I'm pretty far into that.
3564620	3567300	I did manage to play what the golf I was
3567300	3570460	many thinking about streaming it, but I just didn't get around to it.
3570460	3571860	So I've been playing that.
3572060	3574020	And you ready? You ready?
3574220	3575900	I'm ready.
3576100	3578660	It's because Rob is the greatest.
3579540	3581180	Hello.
3582580	3586740	I can't even do an Australian accent, but I've just I've dressed as Sia for Halloween.
3586940	3593020	And the minute I saw the wig, I was like, that's so incredibly random and ridiculous.
3593220	3594340	I have to do it.
3594540	3599500	So anyway, not to interrupt your story, but I interrupted it.
3599660	3602940	OK, but I did it in a Sia wig, so it's awesome, right?
3603140	3604580	I should have worn my costume today.
3604780	3606020	I forgot. You really should.
3606220	3608940	We didn't we got robbed of a Halloween edition of OLR.
3609140	3611660	Yeah, we really did.
3611860	3614900	But yeah, so I played Borderlands three
3615100	3618220	and what the golf and I'm really digging what the golf.
3618420	3620940	It's a pretty fun non golf game.
3621140	3622220	It's really strange.
3622420	3625660	And there's a lot of images like other games in there.
3625860	3627420	Definitely worth checking out.
3627580	3631980	And then I've been working on my game a little bit, not making much progress in it
3631980	3634620	or I should say I've been working on it quite a bit.
3634820	3638980	Yeah, the progress I'm making is very minimal, which is unfortunate because it's
3639180	3642500	kind of frustrating, but it's still progress.
3642700	3647060	So doing that and then what else?
3647260	3649340	That's pretty much it. Yeah.
3650020	3651300	All right.
3651500	3656460	Let's see my my week in my day, I went to a conference that was about
3656500	3658820	learning and I talked a little bit about this on Bobby show.
3659020	3662620	So I'll kind of like throw you back to Bobby show last week because we still did
3662620	3663980	a call even though the power was out.
3663980	3665900	I could still use my excuse me, the cable was down.
3666100	3670020	I could still use my phone, but I went to a learning conference.
3670020	3671660	I learned a lot like they were talking
3671860	3675380	about using A.R. in learning, which I thought was really cool.
3675380	3678940	Like the fact that like let's say you're learning how to build a jet engine.
3679100	3682420	You could put a pair of glasses on, like say the HoloLens or something,
3682420	3685500	and you can use those glasses to like look at the jet engine and it'll show you
3685540	3688100	like the outline, like put the piece here and do this.
3688300	3689860	And I just I thought it was really cool.
3689860	3691620	And then I also had like a VR thing
3691620	3694020	that was training about like workplace safety and stuff.
3694220	3696500	So anyway, I'll just defer you over to Bob.
3696700	3700620	It sounds like a valuable use of assets to you know, it was it was interesting
3700820	3704940	because I've always associated A.R. and VR with gaming, even though A.R.
3705140	3708340	specifically things like HoloLens and stuff, you know, they're saying
3708540	3711460	it's not so much like don't think of HoloLens as a gaming device because
3711460	3713780	they're finding more and more uses in the real world for it.
3713780	3717260	Well, I got to see some of the selling that the people and I got to see some
3717260	3719420	of those real world adaptations firsthand.
3719620	3726140	And I really do think like, you know, in five years, this type of like glasses,
3726140	3728660	learning how to do I think you're going to see much more of that.
3728660	3730420	I really think that is the type of place we're talking about.
3730420	3733900	Even I guess I know Google, the glass hole and Google Glass and all that stuff.
3734100	3737300	But I think there'll be some form of that that's going to be a little more standard
3737300	3739180	in the next maybe, what, five, 10 years. We'll see.
3739180	3740900	That's just kind of something I walked away from.
3741060	3747020	And I think there will be some sort of gaming because they talked about the A.R.
3747020	3748860	can certainly have a place of storytelling.
3749060	3753020	And certainly, you know, the brief extent of HoloLens I have had,
3753020	3757020	I got to play that fragments game, which was kind of like the mystery game.
3757020	3759260	And it's it's fucking awesome.
3759340	3761940	And like so there's definitely storytelling experiences there.
3761940	3763020	I just don't know.
3763020	3765620	You know, A.R. is not necessarily a gaming device.
3765620	3769620	I think A.R. is just it's going to be new technology.
3769620	3773660	Yeah. And where there is technology, there will be games and porn people.
3773660	3776820	Like, I'm sure I didn't see any of this, but I'm sure A.R. porn.
3777060	3778660	It's going to happen.
3778660	3782340	It's it's going to happen.
3782340	3783900	Yeah, it will.
3783900	3786740	Like you're going to you're going to see it and you're going to be able to.
3788260	3790380	Stick your head right in there.
3790380	3794340	What? Boink. You can you just it's V Boink.
3794340	3796500	Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, there you go.
3797380	3799500	Anyway, in the games.
3799500	3803740	So, OK, because I did decide to scale back the MMO stuff a little bit,
3803740	3806540	I'm only playing one MMO right now. I'm playing Final Fantasy 14.
3806740	3810220	But even then, it's kind of like, oh, I get on I do some my daily dungeons
3810220	3812140	and I've been enjoying the thing like I saw.
3812140	3814740	I don't know if it's like playgrounds or something like that.
3814740	3815420	What the hell is that?
3815420	3818220	OK, so they just did a new patch five point one.
3818220	3820500	And with that, they did new beast tribe dailies.
3820500	3824700	So there's this like fairy tribe, basically, of fairies that you help out.
3824860	3827980	And as you are doing the quest
3827980	3832220	and you gain reputation, you're unlocking dreams in this dreamscape.
3832420	3835100	And so the first dream you unlock is this big playground.
3835340	3838340	And so it's just like the thing about Final Fantasy 14
3838340	3839460	that I'm really kind of loving
3839460	3842700	is that they're they're definitely do these things that are very tongue in cheek.
3842700	3845060	Like we're going to create this canvas
3845260	3848500	because we know our fan base is going to go hog fucking wild with it.
3848660	3850740	And so they basically found a way to write into the story
3850740	3853500	this way to have this big like cotton candy dreamscape
3853500	3858340	where you're sliding down slides and you have chairs that are macarons
3859020	3862940	like the not macaroons, but the French macaron macaroon.
3862980	3865540	Yeah, the French ones that are that are way better.
3865700	3867580	Like, don't get me wrong, I love the coconut ones, too,
3867580	3869980	those little pastry ones. Oh, so fucking good.
3870220	3872540	I had one today. Well, I'm so jealous.
3872540	3874780	Well, you can get those as like chairs for your house now
3874780	3875860	because of this dreamscape.
3875860	3877580	So when you and it's just like this little playground
3877580	3879700	that you can go hog wild and play on, it's really cute.
3879700	3883220	So I've been doing that type of stuff in Final Fantasy 14, and that's been cool.
3883820	3885060	But I've been playing other games, too.
3885060	3889540	So I've been checking out the outer worlds thanks to Xbox Game Pass.
3889540	3890660	It was out. Yeah.
3890660	3893620	So I was like, oh, I'm just going to check this out, download it and play it.
3894220	3895820	And I've I've been kind of into it.
3895820	3898420	Like it's outer worlds is interesting
3898420	3902460	because I feel like the game part of it, I kind of played it before.
3902700	3903660	It's kind of like what?
3903660	3906100	Like it's kind of like Fallout meets Bioshock,
3906540	3909060	kind of like that type of thing for me.
3909060	3910980	And it's it is a little bit shooty shoot.
3910980	3913020	But there is a Bobby Black Wolf mode.
3913020	3914660	You can play it on like a story based mode.
3914660	3915700	That's very easy.
3915700	3918500	Your first ability you get lets you slow down time.
3918740	3922500	So it's really easy to like zoom in and hit people super easy.
3922500	3923380	So I'm loving that.
3923380	3925620	So I don't have to worry so much about the game side of things
3925820	3926820	and experience the story.
3926820	3930420	And that's the part where in the outer worlds, it's really, really well done.
3930420	3933820	Like almost I mean, I don't know, because I haven't played much more
3933820	3935900	in like the first 30 minutes or hour of the game.
3935900	3937980	So I can't say like, oh, it's better than Mass Effect.
3938220	3942300	But like the choices feel like they're richer than like a Mass Effect.
3942500	3945060	And you don't necessarily know what's the good choice.
3945060	3946500	What's the bad choice?
3946500	3947860	You just have choices.
3947860	3950420	And it really like plays out the story in different ways.
3950620	3952780	So much that I'm like, oh, I wonder what would go
3953020	3955140	what would happen if I went back and picked that choice instead?
3955580	3960060	So, yeah, I've been into the outer worlds for that reason, actually.
3960300	3963300	So, yeah, Quest Buster says outer worlds was so fun.
3963500	3965540	There are a lot of neat decisions you can make.
3966060	3968100	And Bobby says, I like story mode.
3968100	3972060	I'm about nine hours in that comment from our chat.
3972540	3974180	Over at Twitch TV slash VOG Network.
3974340	3975180	Well, here's the thing.
3975180	3979180	So because I kind of set up Xbox Game Pass so I could play the outer worlds,
3979380	3982060	then I was like, oh, yeah, I have Xbox Game Pass.
3982220	3984460	I should go play these other games I've been missing out on, too.
3984660	3987420	So the one I've actually spent the most time on, I think,
3987420	3990660	probably so far this week is a game called Bloodstained.
3991100	3992020	I love Bloodstained.
3992020	3992620	Now, wait a minute.
3992620	3994740	Didn't I talk about this before when it came out on the Switch?
3995020	3997820	Yes, but I kind of put it away really quick
3998100	4000860	because the Switch version had its issues.
4001020	4004540	And all I was reading, which the issues weren't like gigantic,
4004540	4009020	but it was just everything I was reading was, hey, just we're working on it.
4009020	4010260	We're going to put out some patches.
4010260	4012860	So I was like, well, if they're going to patch the game, then fuck it.
4012860	4014740	I'll wait for the patches to come out.
4014740	4019260	Well, in the meantime, I it came out on Xbox Game Pass and I was like, well,
4019260	4021740	I'm just I want to just play on the PC. I'm going to check it out here.
4021980	4023260	So I've been playing it.
4023260	4026740	I'm actually like I'm really enjoying it now that I'm like finally getting into it
4026740	4030820	and playing it like I got past the little pirate ship level
4030820	4033660	or whatever you'd call it that was first got to the actual castle.
4033820	4037300	That first boss was so hard.
4037580	4039380	Like, am I am I just bad?
4039380	4042220	Because it took me a while to figure out how to beat that guy.
4042260	4045100	My God. Like for a first boss down.
4045460	4047460	Yeah, you really like and I think that's what it took.
4047460	4051340	I really had to study like, wow, what is OK, why don't why am I doing so bad?
4051540	4053820	You really have to pay attention to that pattern.
4053980	4057300	And then I also I got a soul that really helped.
4057300	4059780	Like it made this giant drill type of thing.
4059900	4061220	Oh, yeah, that's the best.
4061220	4062700	Then use that most of the game.
4062700	4065940	OK, that drill made it so much easier to beat that guy.
4066100	4069220	So that was that was about that. So, yeah.
4069660	4072980	So now I was checking out bloodstain and I've been really into that.
4072980	4074660	So as far as like, you know,
4074660	4077380	having that Symphony of the Night feel and so forth.
4077380	4080220	Yeah, I mean, I don't know if any game is ever going to touch
4080220	4082980	Symphony of the Night, but bloodstains pretty rad.
4083300	4084580	Like, I'll give it that.
4084580	4087020	I am going to shade one thing, though.
4087020	4090660	So for all like the shit this game has gotten for technical issues and stuff.
4090660	4092820	Sure enough, as I'm playing the game
4093100	4096540	and I had maybe been like 10 minutes since my last save,
4096740	4098180	I'm going through the castle.
4098180	4101340	I go up to read a library book because you can read these books
4101340	4103780	and it's how you learn how to do some of the special moves and stuff.
4103780	4105380	You might get a little bit more of the lore.
4105380	4108100	I go up to read the book and game crashes.
4108380	4110780	Yeah, which I thought was supposed to be a problem
4110780	4112460	with the switch version that they were fixing.
4112460	4114420	But apparently it was in the PC version, too,
4114420	4116780	or at least the version I was getting on Xbox Game Pass,
4117020	4120260	because somebody either tweeted me or told me on Discord like,
4120460	4124540	oh, it might be a Steam version versus a, you know, something,
4125140	4127860	whatever is Epic Store, wherever else the game is out.
4128020	4129820	And I'm like, oh, there's actually another one
4129820	4132260	because I'm getting it on Xbox Game Pass.
4132260	4135820	So anyway, that was annoying, but it only happened to me the one time.
4135980	4139460	And now I've just been really good about saving as much as I can,
4139460	4140700	which I really try to do in games.
4140700	4141860	Save often.
4141860	4144660	I know, but that was really that was irritating.
4145380	4149900	Another game I checked out was a game called Minit, M-I-N-I-T.
4150100	4152900	So it's like it's like a black and white RPG.
4152900	4155740	It has very much an old school computer look to it.
4155940	4158780	Like it looks like you're playing on an Apple 2e or like, you know,
4158780	4161100	one of those really old computers.
4161100	4163100	But obviously you're playing like your Xbox controller.
4163100	4166740	And the whole catch is that once you pick up the sword
4166740	4170380	that kind of officially starts the game, every minute you die
4170380	4171980	and you restart.
4172420	4176220	Now, as irritating as that sounds, like most roguelikes,
4176220	4179380	although this game is not a roguelike, it's a it's a it's a very linear type
4179380	4183900	of thing, any like let's say you go into a new house,
4184260	4186180	you'll start from that house.
4186180	4187940	Let's say you find a new item.
4187940	4190220	You'll have that new item when you start your game.
4190460	4194460	Let's say you got so, you know, so everything you kind of do
4194820	4197620	makes sense that you don't have to progress that part again
4197860	4199580	after you die and restart.
4199580	4201660	So it's an interesting little twist in it.
4201660	4204820	So it's kind of like part roguelike, part adventure game.
4205060	4208620	I do feel like it is a very simple type of game where it's like
4208900	4210700	go to the lighthouse.
4210700	4213660	The lighthouse has the flashlight so you can get through the cave.
4213860	4215060	The cave gets the death.
4215060	4217420	And this is kind of like, you know, the one thing leads to another.
4217420	4219140	But it's not too linear.
4219140	4221620	Like there definitely seems to be some branching, some ways to go.
4221620	4223180	You can explore the map and so forth.
4223180	4225140	So it is like it's a cute game.
4225140	4227420	I think it only retails for like eight bucks,
4227620	4229220	which is probably about the right price.
4229220	4229660	Which one again?
4229660	4230340	Minit.
4230340	4233420	It was free just a few weeks ago on Epic.
4233420	4234340	Oh, was it Epic?
4234340	4236140	I don't know if I grabbed it when it was free on Epic,
4236140	4237340	but it's on the Game Pass.
4237340	4238700	So I just grabbed it there.
4238700	4240180	It was like, I thought I heard about this game.
4240180	4242300	So I and it sounded like something up my alley.
4242300	4242940	So I checked it out.
4242940	4243460	It's on Switch.
4243460	4244620	Yeah, and I've been into it.
4244620	4246780	So that's for sure.
4246780	4248780	Metal Mayhem is confirming what you said.
4248780	4250740	Minit was a freebie on Epic a while back.
4250740	4253580	YYR is telling me to play Supermarket Shriek on Game Pass.
4253580	4256140	I downloaded it and I just haven't gotten to it yet.
4256140	4258740	But it is in my list of like things that's going to be awesome.
4258740	4259540	Yeah.
4259540	4263260	Um, now the other game I checked out was
4263940	4265940	and I don't know why I downloaded this game.
4265940	4267580	I was just like, oh, it's free.
4267580	4269220	Well, I can finally try it.
4269220	4273300	So I decided to play Marvel versus Capcom Unlimited because.
4274060	4274580	Yeah.
4274580	4275100	Was it?
4275100	4276700	Oh, Lord, worthy.
4276700	4277980	It was it was a choice.
4277980	4279860	Was it New Infinite?
4279860	4282540	I was like, well, that was forty five gigs.
4282540	4284380	I just wasted.
4285260	4288180	Look, this it has a story, I don't know.
4288180	4290940	It's I want to sit here and go, it's not that bad.
4292860	4295060	There's other fighting games I could be playing.
4296820	4299300	Why not just do Capcom versus SNK two on Game Pass?
4299300	4299780	How about that?
4299780	4302700	That would have been a better use of my bandwidth.
4302700	4303500	I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry.
4303500	4304700	I put on. Yes, thank you.
4304700	4306140	Marvel's Capcom Infinite.
4306140	4307700	I said infinite. Thank you.
4307700	4309580	Yeah, well, I don't know why I put unlimited.
4309580	4310780	Yeah, Marvel's Capcom Infinite.
4310780	4312020	That's the one I've been playing.
4312020	4314220	So, um, yeah, I loved it.
4314260	4316580	So much I couldn't even remember the name.
4316580	4319820	Metal Mayhem says free where not really free.
4319820	4321420	It's Xbox Game Pass.
4321420	4324740	So you have to be paying for the game pass and then you get it there.
4324980	4328380	But I mean, I am as I'm using it more and more.
4328380	4331420	I'm definitely like getting some of the value out of Game Pass.
4331420	4334940	So that part I'm appreciating because I'm not dropping 20 bucks
4334940	4338260	or 10 bucks on a copy of Marvel's Capcom Infinite
4339020	4340140	just because it's on sale.
4340140	4341140	Like, I appreciate that.
4341140	4343740	I was able to download that and try it for myself and be like,
4343740	4346500	oh, I'll just play Street Fighter four next time.
4346500	4347860	I want to play a game like that.
4347860	4350460	So anyway.
4351140	4353540	Oh, D'Artecio says get Dragonball fighters.
4353540	4355820	That's that's probably better.
4355820	4356820	I don't think it's on that.
4356820	4358500	It's not on Game Pass yet.
4358500	4360500	That's kind of the reason I've been visiting these games,
4360500	4363220	because I'm like, well, I should get some value out of this.
4363220	4364860	So I've been trying to get the value.
4364860	4365860	So there you go.
4365860	4368780	That was my gaming week and essentially my week in my day.
4369220	4370260	So let's move on.
4370260	4372460	We still have some news to get into.
4372460	4373820	And I want to get into the news.
4373820	4376100	So costume quest is free right now.
4376100	4378540	I want that. Oh, on the epic store, right?
4378540	4379900	Yeah. Yeah. Cool.
4379900	4382820	And so my Loki, let's get into some gaming news.
4383060	4387820	So you know what Bethesda needs to do for Fallout 76?
4388580	4390580	What everybody's been asking them to do?
4390900	4393260	Paywall some more bullshit for it.
4393260	4394420	That's what they need to do.
4394420	4396500	And that's what they did with Fallout first.
4396500	4401020	Their ninety nine dollar subscription service.
4401100	4404180	That's ninety nine dollars for a year or twelve ninety nine a month
4404180	4406500	because it's super affordable.
4406500	4409380	So what do you get for your ninety nine dollars a year?
4409820	4412420	You get private worlds so you can play in a private world
4412420	4414820	exclusively for you and up to seven friends.
4415540	4417700	Problem is, it doesn't fucking work
4417940	4421020	because anybody on your friends list can join your game.
4421140	4423380	So that's all fucked.
4423380	4428260	Unlimited storage for crafting components in your own new scrap box container.
4428820	4430980	It was deleting your items.
4432380	4437940	It's great. A new survival tent, a place full fast travel point
4437940	4442180	with a stash sleeping bag and more for basic needs.
4442460	4444580	I don't believe that was working either.
4444580	4449420	You get some stupid Adams, sixteen or one thousand six hundred fifty
4449420	4452940	Adams per month, which the quote Angry Joe.
4453060	4455140	You can't even buy blue for that.
4455780	4459860	One of the colors for your armors is actually more than what that is there.
4459860	4463380	It's twenty dollars for blue. That's stupid.
4465460	4467060	Ranger armor outfits.
4467060	4472300	So they had the special ranger armor that we're going to get into this,
4472300	4475580	how this is also kind of working against people that bought that.
4475780	4478260	And then some unique emotes.
4478260	4480980	So obviously, people were not too thrilled about that.
4481660	4484060	And unfortunately, because of that,
4485380	4488620	actually, people that are paying for this service.
4489740	4494580	Are actually getting some shit from people that aren't buying the service.
4495100	4499620	So when they see, you know, players wearing these exclusive armors or whatever,
4499620	4503900	they're kind of getting harassed a little bit, which is not a good thing.
4506980	4510580	But basically, you know, one of the things
4510580	4514580	that also kind of goes against is they're talking about before that.
4514820	4518580	The they've even promised that all of the enhancements
4518580	4520460	that they would do the games are all the sell stuff
4520460	4523300	they would sell through the atomic shop would not be.
4523660	4527180	It would just be cosmetics only, not like pay to win.
4527780	4531980	But then again, they're giving you now the ability to basically
4531980	4536580	have private servers and have unlimited storage because storage is a problem
4536580	4540940	in the game, and now you can pay for that problem to go away.
4540940	4542740	A problem that they created, by the way.
4546380	4547900	So it's just it's ridiculous.
4547900	4551900	I don't know why they thought this was a great idea, but.
4553300	4555620	I don't know, and now the people, you know,
4556420	4559740	some fans of the game are saying, well, this is kind of a slippery slope
4559740	4563620	because now that you have this service, if people take advantage of it,
4563620	4566740	they're going to start piecemealing more things off of it.
4567060	4568660	And here's the even the worst part about it.
4568660	4571420	Like, so to go along with this, they have that whole update
4571420	4572820	that they were going to do where they were going to be
4572820	4575500	introducing NPCs back to the game.
4575500	4577260	Well, that got delayed.
4577260	4578900	It got that part got delayed.
4578900	4581500	So the actual meaningful updates to the game delayed.
4581700	4583460	But let me sell you something else.
4583460	4585540	I don't want to disrespect the Fallout fans out there.
4585540	4587660	And I'm really sorry that your game has turned out this way.
4587660	4590740	But like, shouldn't Bethesda at their point just cut their losses and move on?
4591380	4594340	Like, shouldn't they just like, let's just they're going to milk this thing dry.
4594340	4596740	Let's just take what we've learned from this experience
4596740	4598100	and apply it to future games
4598100	4600660	so that we don't end up in this type of situation ever again.
4601180	4603540	Like, wouldn't that just be the best course of action for this?
4603580	4604660	Or is it just one of these?
4604660	4608500	They must be facing such pressure from their investors to make this game happen.
4608740	4612780	And to be fair, other games have turned their asses around,
4612780	4615740	like Diablo three fixed itself.
4615740	4617540	No Man's Sky fixed itself.
4617540	4619020	Final Fantasy 14 fixed itself.
4619020	4623740	So like Fallout 76, like I feel like desperately wants to join that club.
4623940	4626540	But then they make moves like this where it's like, oh, PS,
4626540	4629500	your whole stash gets deleted when you use it, where it's just like,
4630020	4632380	that's that's not how you're going to win the people over.
4633060	4634020	That's not how it's done.
4634020	4638500	And it's like, who like who who even wants to give this a try anymore?
4638500	4640780	Like there's been so much shit regarding this.
4641140	4644300	So much, in fact, that Australia has said, you know what?
4646300	4648740	We think that some consumers were misled.
4648740	4651140	And that we're going to actually
4651140	4654700	require that Bethesda or Zenimax in this case to
4655740	4657340	actually refund some of these players.
4657340	4660780	So apparently, if anyone asked for a refund in Australia
4660780	4665620	between November 24th, 2018 and June 1st, 2019 can now receive that refund.
4668180	4670260	They said that, of course,
4670260	4673860	if you receive the refund, you'll be no longer entitled access to play the game.
4674460	4677540	But apparently, you know, some people that were asking for refunds,
4677940	4680540	you know, with, you know, problems with servers lagging,
4680540	4684380	graphical visual problems, we're told that they couldn't get one.
4684380	4688940	But apparently, Australian consumer law says otherwise.
4689220	4692340	So if you had made that request,
4692980	4695780	now it's time to actually get that refund.
4696140	4698540	If you haven't, you're kind of out of luck.
4698540	4700700	Questbuster in chat says it goes deeper than that.
4700700	4703660	Some fans were upset with Bethesda's direction of the Fallout series
4703660	4707500	for a while now, and the bugs and Fallout 76 was the last straw for them.
4707660	4710340	Fallout first just made things a lot worse.
4710540	4714340	And some folks in chat bringing up that everybody wants to be Fortnite.
4714500	4717660	YYR saying the investors and higher ups want games as a service.
4717660	4719860	Every game should be a service with recurring charges.
4719860	4722900	Ideally, Bobby says exactly works for Fortnite.
4723060	4725540	Act Def says Fortnite is popular and making money.
4725620	4727660	Do the Fortnite so we can get more money.
4727660	4729860	That quote attributed to investors.
4729860	4732140	But then you can't sell your game for $60.
4732140	4736060	Like if Fallout 76 was a free to play game and they wanted to go the Fortnite route,
4736060	4739580	I think people wouldn't be so harsh about the, you know,
4739580	4742780	the $99 subscription fee or anything else.
4743260	4745660	I'm sorry. A Fortnite is not a $60 game.
4745700	4748900	It's the problem is that it's like, here's a $60 game.
4748900	4750900	Oh, and then we want to sell you these cosmetics.
4750900	4754100	They're like $20 each. Oh, and then we want you to buy this shit.
4754100	4758260	Oh, and then we want you to buy a $99 subscription service to a game that like
4759660	4761980	is this going to be even functioning in a year?
4761980	4766100	I mean, like, why why should I drop $99 on this game?
4766100	4767060	Like, I don't know.
4767060	4770420	And look, I do understand to an extent that there's going to be boardroom
4770420	4773340	pressure to mirror the successes of other games.
4773340	4776100	But like Fortnite started from somewhere.
4776100	4778580	Why not create the next big thing in gaming?
4778580	4780980	Because believe it or not, you know, every year
4781180	4784500	we're talking about these new games, these new things that happen in gaming.
4784500	4785700	They come from somewhere.
4785700	4791100	And I feel like, you know, I think Fallout 76 is kind of a gone thing at this point.
4791340	4795300	But let's say this Starfield or this Elder Scrolls six comes out.
4795300	4797420	If Elder Scrolls six is a great fucking game,
4797420	4799140	then that's what people are going to be talking about.
4799140	4801100	And people are going to want to play it and talk about it.
4801100	4804260	But look, it's like, OK, if you want to compare your game to Fortnite
4804260	4806460	and you want to compare, you know, like how they have it.
4806580	4808540	Don't just look at the microtransactions.
4808540	4811540	Look at how the game plays. The game is polished.
4811860	4815100	The game doesn't have that many bugs in it.
4816060	4819380	Fallout 76 was fucking broken when it came out there.
4819380	4820460	You cannot compare it.
4820460	4821980	You can't say, well, we're going to put
4821980	4823980	we're going to set the same same type of shop
4823980	4826100	and we're going to have the same type of success.
4826100	4828780	You got to have the good game to get the people there,
4828780	4832340	the one to actually play your game, because right now it's fucking broken
4832340	4836220	and just promises of like roadmaps of and that's the bad thing about it.
4836220	4839220	It's like a lot of these games of service stuff, even with Anthem,
4839220	4843420	have these roadmaps because they come out incomplete, broken pieces of rush shit.
4843660	4847260	And then now it's like, oh, but we promise we'll get, you know, better later.
4847260	4848620	Pay us another hundred dollars.
4848620	4850180	I mean, fuck that.
4850180	4851420	Why should I waste my time?
4851420	4854860	Bobby Blackwell in chat says wasn't Final Fantasy 14, 60 dollars
4854860	4856020	and then a monthly fee.
4856020	4858140	To be fair, I think it was 40 dollars and then a monthly fee.
4858140	4862140	But I think it is worth saying there are two games, maybe three.
4862140	4865260	If you want to get technical, they can get away with doing that right now
4866060	4869100	that can charge an upfront fee and then a monthly fee on top of that.
4869300	4872380	But it didn't stop everybody else from trying to mirror that. Right.
4872620	4874540	Hello. What was it?
4874540	4879700	Rift. Hello. God, there's so many other tabula rasa.
4880700	4883220	Star Wars, Old Republic,
4883220	4887300	Elder Scrolls Online and all these games that tried to do the same thing and flopped
4887380	4890100	and credit games, two games have succeeded with that model.
4890100	4893020	And there's a little difference, too, because we understand with I'm putting
4893020	4894660	eleven and fourteen in the same bucket.
4894660	4898180	We understand that like a game like Final Fantasy 14 is an MMO,
4898180	4899980	which I know you could say that, you know, well,
4899980	4901860	Anthem and these other games could be like an MMO.
4901860	4906580	But I believe that Final Fantasy and I know that was the case for eleven.
4906860	4908900	They're not selling cosmetic items.
4908900	4910180	It's that monthly fee.
4910180	4913220	That's your price to entry. Incorrect. OK.
4914420	4917140	But they're not shoving it down your throat. Correct.
4917180	4920260	Like these other games. Correct. OK.
4921500	4923060	Eleven didn't sell cosmic items.
4923060	4924820	That's all I have to go by.
4924820	4926180	No, fourteen definitely does.
4926180	4929740	But like it's a fucking fat cat as a mount, like it's fucking adorable.
4929740	4931820	And they I mean, they do say that.
4931820	4933740	But so does Wow Wow has their mount store, too.
4933740	4935420	So they and they sell expansions.
4935420	4938220	So it is it's a different model than this game to the service.
4938220	4940980	But here's the thing. It's like the games of service stuff.
4940980	4943500	Like you have Fortnite, which is free to play.
4943500	4946820	And then they have their, you know, season pass or not their passes,
4946820	4948820	but they're kind of different
4950020	4953460	seasons that they do with different things that you can get for loot
4953460	4955460	and you can pay for skins and stuff like that.
4955860	4957060	So they have that model.
4957060	4960540	Then they have the model where you buy the game and you play online
4960540	4962780	and there's other like cosmetics and stuff.
4963500	4965700	And then you have like subscription services and stuff.
4966140	4969300	Fallout 76 wants to do all of those models at once.
4969300	4971100	And that's where it's fucked up.
4971100	4974820	And here's the thing also about 14 that's very unique is that
4975220	4977420	the original product came out. It was garbage.
4977420	4979940	The company had to apologize for it and they fixed it.
4980140	4984540	And, you know, I know not everybody is going to understand this or believe this.
4984540	4986980	But this this is a hill I'm willing to die on.
4986980	4988260	This is this is a hill.
4988260	4990860	I'm going to I'm going to die on this hill. I'm dying.
4990940	4992220	I'm dying on my hill.
4992220	4994860	Final Fantasy 14. That was my microphone.
4994860	4996100	Killing Pikachu.
4996100	4999220	Final Fantasy 14, I'm dead.
4999420	5003980	But I wanted to say my final words on my tombstone are Final Fantasy
5003980	5009860	14 has some of the best story in any MMO or any Final Fantasy game.
5010180	5013020	Put it on my tombstone, pepperoni and sausage.
5015220	5017220	All right. Now I want pizza. Thanks, Rob.
5020980	5023340	And that's why Final Fantasy 14 gets away with it.
5023340	5025980	And in many ways, World of Warcraft is the same thing.
5025980	5027180	It's got a story that many,
5027180	5030500	many people love and adore, and they've made their guildmates and all this stuff.
5030500	5031980	And it's it's their life.
5031980	5036220	And I mean that in a negative way, like when Alan and I were first dating,
5036220	5040060	we used to quest in World of Warcraft and that was like our date.
5040060	5042580	I know it sounds weird, but that's the type of stuff you do
5042860	5045500	when you have like long distance between you sometimes.
5045500	5047260	And so like, you know, World of Warcraft
5047260	5049340	had a really engrossing story where you could do things like that, too.
5049340	5052620	I think that's why in particular, those two games have gotten away with it
5052620	5055980	as well as they have, because they're both extremely polished games.
5056220	5058780	So anyway.
5060180	5061340	Moving on, where were we?
5061340	5063500	Oh, it was that it on Fallout 76? Yes.
5063500	5066900	OK, let's move on before I before I die again.
5067620	5068780	Let's rather you not die.
5068780	5072140	Let's talk about Death Stranding, because that game is kind of like
5072140	5074260	going to be the hot new thing of this week.
5074260	5077060	And the reviews are finally coming out on Death Stranding.
5077260	5080180	And we finally kind of fucking know what the game is.
5080420	5081660	And it sounds like Death Stranding.
5081660	5083940	I still don't know what it is after hearing the reviews.
5083940	5085700	It's Fetch Quest is what Death Stranding is.
5085700	5086740	It's Fetch Quest, the game.
5086740	5090980	It's Amazon Delivery Boy, the game with babies, with babies.
5091660	5093740	But it sounds like Amazon babies.
5093740	5096620	It sounds like it's obviously I'm oversimplifying it.
5096820	5100580	It sounds very interesting that you have to kind of like actually balance yourself
5100580	5104220	as you're going through terrain because of the big load that you're carrying.
5105100	5108740	But, you know, you have to like be very careful not to fall in the baby.
5108940	5111460	Yeah, or kill the baby or I don't know, things like that.
5111740	5117060	It's interesting because the more and more I read these reviews about like, wow,
5117260	5120940	this game story is up its own ass so deep.
5121140	5124020	I'm all I'm like more and more like I really want to play it.
5124500	5126740	Yeah, I kind of do too.
5126740	5132140	The more I hear about like Kojima has successfully eaten his own ass
5132140	5135940	in a video game and he's put it on screen for us all to enjoy.
5136100	5138100	I'm like, I want to play that.
5138340	5140380	This self-indulgent garbage.
5140380	5143100	It's art. I want to play it.
5143100	5145420	It is time to indulge in some Kojima ass.
5146420	5151100	It kind of is like the more and more I hear people hating on this game.
5151300	5154260	I'm like, it sounds awesome.
5154900	5158180	Like when somebody said, what was the review?
5158180	5160020	I read somewhere where it was like,
5160020	5163300	it's the classiest walking simulator you'll ever play.
5163300	5165980	I'm like, I love walking simulators.
5166380	5168340	There was one. There was one I read.
5168340	5170060	I got to find the
5170780	5172220	I got to find the quote.
5172220	5175020	It was something about like it was from a giant ball.
5175940	5178660	They had they had a great quote.
5179580	5180220	I'll get this for you.
5180220	5182660	But it was oh, here we go.
5182700	5185020	Giant ball with death stranding.
5185580	5187100	Johnny Woofay in our chat says,
5187100	5190300	I have my life size baby in a jar with absurd game preordered.
5190540	5191180	That's where I'm at.
5191180	5193540	I'm at this point where I'm like, OK,
5193540	5196740	like I can appreciate really bad cinema.
5197420	5201100	Like if this is that like as a game, I'm kind of into it.
5201220	5203260	Like right now, I can't believe I'm saying this,
5203260	5206540	especially after giving this game shit for so many years of like,
5206700	5208660	where's the game? Right.
5208660	5212460	Like now I'm like, I kind of now that I know what the game is
5212580	5215980	and that it's apparently really ridiculous, I really want it.
5217420	5219540	I don't know what it is. I can't explain it.
5220500	5223420	That sounds a lot like me winning my pink Game Boy advance.
5223540	5226020	I don't like pink, but I wanted it for reasons.
5226660	5228980	Bobby Black Wolf with this comment says,
5229260	5231860	apparently it's the Dark Souls of Walking.
5232060	5235940	A little rock can trip you up if you don't hold L2 and R2
5235940	5238820	perfectly. The Dark Souls of Walking?
5240180	5242180	That is put that on the box.
5242180	5243940	That's amazing.
5246140	5248300	The Dark Souls of Walking.
5248300	5253460	Uh, where's that quote?
5253460	5255580	I got to find it. It was hilarious when I read it.
5257260	5259780	Here we go. Jeff Gerstmann, 2019.
5259940	5263460	It's part American Truck Simulator, but also QWOP.
5267060	5269380	I fucking love QWOP. Let's do this.
5269660	5271620	Oh, my God. I can't wait for Death Stranding.
5275860	5277700	This is really fucking ridiculous.
5277740	5279020	Don't you kind of want it, though?
5279020	5280580	I know. I told you already that I want it.
5280580	5281580	I don't even know what the game...
5281580	5286540	Look, look, even Dark Sakura, even the harshest of harsh in this house,
5286780	5290860	even her cold black recently operated heart.
5291500	5293980	They didn't work on my heart.
5293980	5295340	That's what you were unconscious.
5295340	5300460	They might have. Even she is like, I'm kind of into Death Stranding
5300460	5301540	all of a sudden.
5301540	5303060	It's not an all of the sudden thing.
5303060	5305300	I was already really into it.
5305300	5306660	I still don't know what it's about.
5306660	5309700	I'm just going to have my psychological fix for what I'm lacking
5309700	5313180	from Silent Hill not existing in real life anymore.
5313220	5315700	Loki, we're going to explain what this game is about.
5315700	5317620	Look at me, Loki. Look at me. Look at me.
5317620	5319700	The Dark Souls of walking.
5321260	5323820	It's a metaphor.
5323820	5327060	As all Kojima things are, it's a metaphor.
5328100	5329780	Tiger Claw on chat says, Who knows?
5329780	5332340	Death Stranding could be your game of the year for 2019.
5332460	5334940	It might be. But isn't that going to be interesting
5334940	5337140	if it ends up winning awards at the game awards?
5337140	5338500	How's that going to work?
5338500	5342180	I should also. Jeff Keeley's in the game and he produces the game awards.
5342180	5345100	Like, aren't they going to say shenanigans if this game wins?
5345180	5348020	I mean, it could also be the violent diarrhea of video games.
5348380	5351580	No, but we won't know until we try it.
5352220	5354540	It's like ice cream.
5354540	5357420	You look at the ice cream, you think, wow, that could be really bad for me.
5357420	5359820	This is really rich and I'm lactose intolerant. Right.
5360100	5364100	But you eat the ice cream, not knowing if it maybe has some acidophilus
5364140	5367620	strains in there that will help offset the the lactose.
5368380	5371060	But then again, you might also have violent diarrhea because of it.
5371420	5373540	That's Death Stranding.
5373540	5377460	Potential violent diarrhea, but delicious while you're consuming it.
5379140	5383980	Did she just say never mind, Eurogamer calls it Hideo Kojima's
5383980	5387940	first post Metal Gear game is a messy, indulgent vanity project,
5388700	5390780	but also true original. I'll go for it.
5391140	5393620	Yeah, I'm all about vanity projects anyway.
5395100	5400300	I mean, Madonna's Madam X was kind of a vanity project as well, right?
5400300	5400820	Kinda.
5404940	5408100	Why, why, orange hat is asking, why is the diarrhea violent?
5410700	5413260	Apparently, you're not lactose intolerant.
5413260	5415460	All right, moving on.
5415700	5416820	I think, wow, look at that.
5416820	5417300	Wait, wait, wait.
5417300	5420580	My stream deck just showed we just lost three viewers.
5420580	5422740	Good job there, Sakura.
5423380	5425900	You know what, they can get over it.
5425900	5428540	All right, moving on. You know what?
5428540	5432100	They'll just have to rejoin and watch that pre roll ad and we'll get the coin.
5432620	5434740	All right, moving on.
5435140	5441180	Dr. Sakura, fucking get us back on topic topic like we ever had one.
5441620	5446620	So how about something that doesn't have anything to do with violent diarrhea?
5447420	5449180	Nintendo Switch.
5449420	5455900	It actually has already, of course, surpassed the Nintendo 64 sales in April.
5456180	5461860	And now it looks like over the holidays, it's going to pass over the SNES for sales.
5462180	5469780	It will need 7.43 million more sales to pass the sales figures of the Super Nintendo.
5470380	5475220	And I mean, in last year, the Switch sold 9.41 million units.
5475260	5477580	So two quarters to go.
5478020	5479260	We need to see what's going to happen.
5480580	5489100	So that means it's right now 11 million away from its target, which is by fiscal year ending in March 2020,
5489100	5491020	which would be 18 million Switch units.
5491620	5500060	So, of course, we also have the Switch Lite, you know, definitely cutting into the expense of the full unit.
5500500	5504620	I mean, but, you know, they've also been doing just really quality games.
5504620	5509860	I mean, not just, you know, Link's Awakening that just came out, like, not long ago.
5510180	5512980	But there's the Fire Emblem, Three Houses got great reviews.
5513380	5515260	You know, it's a pretty great system.
5515260	5521140	And on top of that, it's very versatile because you can carry it with you and play it on your big screen,
5521140	5522780	which is what everybody wanted.
5522780	5525100	So there you go.
5525820	5528180	Yeah, and Nintendo Switch is great.
5528180	5533900	And it's so weird to think that, like, it's at the point where there's going to be more of those out there than there were
5533900	5538140	Super Nintendo, because it always feels like Super Nintendo is like the greatest system of all time.
5538140	5539380	I still feel that in my heart.
5539380	5543100	But maybe that's because I was 12 years old and Super Nintendo was like the new thing.
5543100	5548420	And so I think whatever system like you associate with like your junior high and your early high school,
5548420	5551580	like formative years, you're going to think is the greatest console of all time, too, probably.
5552700	5553980	Well, I don't know. Maybe. I don't know.
5554060	5555300	There's always the Sega Saturn.
5556900	5562260	But anyway, I'm just I'm kind of like, oh, it's weird to think that we're already at a point where the Switch is
5562260	5566700	going to outsell that. But that also is because more and more people are gaming.
5566860	5571300	Right. You know, like the only people that don't understand gaming at this point are boomers.
5571300	5574060	OK, boomer. Yeah, you would be surprised.
5574060	5578420	No, I know. And I'm just I just wanted an opportunity to make a cheap joke at the boomers expense.
5579020	5584460	But I think I think more and more even and even in that age group are getting into gaming.
5584460	5591100	And I think more and more people gaming is just a part of culture now and is is a part of art art that we partake in.
5591260	5596860	So it's just interesting, like how fast the switch has hit that point when it sometimes felt like, oh,
5596860	5603140	there's nothing could ever top the Super Nintendo, even though actually a lot of systems have since taught the Super Nintendo in sales.
5604580	5608860	Yeah. So anyway, by the way, do you know why I started smirking while you were reading that story?
5609300	5615980	Because I realized the whole point of me bringing up Death Stranding was to tell you guys that, oh, yeah, it's also coming out on PC.
5616340	5617260	And you forgot to mention that.
5617260	5620700	And I never mentioned what the actual story was about.
5622020	5625740	It was up on the. So we're clear just to back up a little bit here.
5626700	5629900	Oh, yes. Death Stranding is to get a PC release.
5629900	5632700	Yes, that was that was the original point of the summer 2020.
5632740	5636300	Yes. If if the PlayStation 4, for whatever reason, you still have one.
5636300	5637900	You're like, oh, I'm going to skip it.
5637900	5641380	I'm going to wait for PlayStation five or you're just a strictly a PC gamer.
5641540	5646380	Well, guess what? Death Stranding will also be out on PC next year from what?
5646380	5648580	Five or five games is doing it right.
5648900	5654260	Some people are actually pissed off about this news because they were promised that it would be a PlayStation exclusive.
5654500	5655460	And now they're very.
5655460	5657580	Why are you mad at something that's not exclusive?
5657900	5660100	I don't I don't know.
5660100	5661780	How dare you get to play the game?
5661780	5664020	I like to on another platform. Damn it.
5664060	5665380	I think it's a fanboy thing.
5665380	5670620	Like when you've been defending Sony and all this stuff all this time and you're like, well, they're the ones that OKed it.
5670740	5675460	I I mean, if you think about it, are you mad that like, you know,
5676180	5681060	Detroit become human and all those other aquatic dream games are on Epic Store?
5681980	5685060	I was at first, but then I didn't care.
5685060	5686740	At first I was afraid.
5686740	5689340	I was such a no stop it.
5690540	5692340	But yeah, I don't I don't.
5692340	5696300	Maybe somebody in our chat wants to give insight on that because I just don't think that way.
5696300	5699140	I'm just like, yeah, more people get to play the game. That's cool.
5699340	5703700	And honestly, the PlayStation still has a big old six month window for people to experience.
5703700	5708180	The Dark Souls of walking all to themselves.
5708180	5711340	So I can't wait to check out the Dark Souls.
5711460	5716380	I don't know. Bobby Black Wolf in chat says they are afraid this means that Sony isn't committed to the console.
5716660	5723740	What the news about the PlayStation five didn't show that the PlayStation four is has has a lifespan.
5724620	5727060	The PlayStation five is indeed coming.
5727260	5732460	I don't I honestly like to to Bobby's point and everybody else out there,
5732700	5740980	like Sony kind of has to be a little more committed to PC because of where Microsoft is positioning themselves,
5741300	5744980	because Microsoft is about to step into this world where it's going to be.
5745180	5756540	You know, Xbox is more the ecosystem that you experience either on your PC or on your television via an Xbox console as a delivery or via the cloud.
5756900	5768260	I actually would go so far as to say it would be foolish of Sony to not consider getting in on the PC side of things as well and finding that right partner to do so.
5768380	5771860	That maybe isn't necessarily Microsoft or depends how they want to play that game.
5772660	5778140	So anyway. All right, let's move on.
5779100	5780900	Loki, let's talk about games that won't happen.
5781740	5783900	And this is not the first time this has happened.
5784300	5789940	But EA has canceled NBA 2K20 or NBA, I'm sorry, NBA Live 20.
5791140	5796340	I can't believe I'm confused at what two NBA franchises are out there.
5796740	5799700	But yes, NBA Live 20 is not coming out.
5800380	5803980	They said we're not launching a new NBA Live HD product this season.
5803980	5816820	Instead, we are expanding our vision, learning are leaning hard into the new leading edge platforms and taking the time to ensure we deliver against the opportunity for our players.
5818180	5825380	So maybe extra time to, I don't know, develop for the new platforms that come in next year.
5826700	5832140	I mean, that's good, I guess, instead of just rehashing, you know, roster update 2020 or something like that.
5832140	5838820	Yeah, it would be very disappointing if like the PlayStation 5 version was just like the PlayStation 4 copied with some upgrades.
5839060	5850420	So if they're taking the year off to really bring us like a really souped up NBA, because I could see this, you know, as much as we here at OLR don't always get into the sports games, you know, we don't do the deep dive on those all the time.
5850700	5852860	Although I don't know, like, I still love NBA Jam.
5852860	5854780	And, you know, there's always going to be Tecmo Bowl.
5854940	5857180	There's always going to be those sports games that kind of like buck the trend.
5857180	5858020	Right. Blade and steal.
5858820	5862260	But the reality is we don't usually do the deep dive on the sports games.
5862260	5872260	But the reality is when it comes to E3, when it comes to that big press conference or whatever it is where Sony is going to unveil the new console and so forth, it is going to help them to be able to show off.
5872460	5879660	Look how pretty the sports ball is, because there are a lot of people out there that the consoles are, it's their Madden machine.
5879660	5880740	It's their NBA machine.
5880740	5882780	These are the games they fucking play.
5882780	5887380	Live has been kind of think they're weaker of the sports franchises that they had.
5887420	5891940	I mean, really, 2K kind of rules the NBA franchises stuff.
5892380	5893860	But I don't know.
5893860	5897900	I know it's been kind of iffy in the past and 2K kind of gives it a run for its money.
5897900	5902780	But 2K has been kind of second to some folks and I don't I have really low standards for sports games.
5902780	5909420	Some folks in chatter are quick to bring up WWE 2K20, which no, no, no, I know that's a hot piece of shit.
5909420	5911940	I mean, I've seen the videos, so yes.
5912300	5914740	And that's what happens when you have no competition.
5915700	5918100	It's just it's completely fucked.
5918100	5922220	It's the Dark Souls of wrestling games, the challenge, playing it.
5923060	5925460	It's just it's it's all sorts of messed up.
5927060	5931940	Yeah, all right, well, I pour one out, I guess, for NBA Live 20.
5931940	5938740	But I mean, if it makes the next NBA game that much better, I think we can do I think we can go one year without.
5938740	5941300	I think it'll be OK, so we'll see what happens.
5941540	5946500	Anyway, let's move on and talk a little bit about since we're talking about the next round of consoles,
5946500	5951940	our next story has to do a little bit with the next round of Xbox and what Microsoft might have in store.
5952100	5956900	And one of the people that's going to be helping them out with the development of games to their console, it's Ubisoft.
5957460	5962420	Apparently, Ubisoft is developing five games for Microsoft's new console.
5962660	5969380	This is from an earnings call where Yves Guillemot, I hope I said his name right, who is the Ubisoft CEO.
5969540	5973940	He announced that they are working on five games for Microsoft's next Xbox console.
5974260	5980660	Three of the five titles are Watch Dogs, Legion, Gods and Monsters and Rainbow Six Quarantine.
5980980	5982740	They've talked about these games previously.
5982740	5986020	For example, I know that Watch Dogs was a big part of their E3 this year.
5986500	5993180	So these three games will be released both on Xbox one and the Project Scarlet, whatever that is.
5993980	5997100	But apparently the other two games have yet to be announced.
5997700	6004260	Now, the only other thing about this whole thing is that I thought all Scarlet games were still going to work on the old Xbox hardware.
6004260	6006140	I thought that was the thing that Microsoft promised.
6006380	6010380	Or was that only for their own games and they can't talk about third parties?
6010860	6012420	Did I misinterpret that?
6012420	6013300	I thought, I don't know.
6013300	6020340	So to be determined, well, we really won't know until they unveil the console because they could change any of the rules, quite frankly.
6022060	6026140	It should also be noted Ubisoft has delayed several games that they've been working on.
6026620	6035500	And this could be part of the reason for the delay is that developers now have time to create next-gen versions of the game because we're in this interesting little in-between period.
6035940	6036460	I don't know.
6037060	6044020	But it should also be mentioned that as part of this earnings call, only Xbox Scarlet was mentioned, not PlayStation 5.
6044420	6046820	Ubisoft has typically supported both.
6047180	6049100	So this could mean something.
6049380	6050540	It could mean nothing.
6050780	6059500	We don't really know until they officially unveil these things outside of just an earnings call where they're trying to tell the investors we're working on something, but we can't get all the details just yet.
6059780	6061740	So, interesting.
6061900	6063340	We'll see what develops from here.
6063380	6072540	But I don't know, anything you guys are reading in the tea leaves about this with Ubisoft working on the next Xbox, but not being so explicit about PlayStation or any of this?
6072540	6074540	And I open this up to the chat room as well for your thoughts.
6076860	6079260	I don't, I'm so sick of rumors.
6079820	6080580	I mean, I...
6080940	6082220	Well, to be fair, this isn't a rumor.
6082260	6083620	It's on an earnings call.
6083660	6085060	It's just like, what do you read into it?
6085380	6089580	But still, I don't want to read anything into it until I have something concrete.
6089860	6095900	I mean, that's really how I am with any of this stuff now, because we've been burned before trying to follow this.
6096340	6098580	So I'm really just reserving judgment.
6100300	6101260	Some comments from our chat.
6101500	6107900	Questbuster says those are the same three games that they delayed following Breakpoint's less than stellar reception.
6107900	6112580	Yeah, the Breakpoint game did not quite live up to the expectations they were hoping for.
6112580	6120100	So, you know, but I mean, every studio has that one game, it seems like, that doesn't seem to go over so well.
6120100	6123460	So I don't know, maybe, but certainly they don't want to do it again.
6123580	6124020	We'll see.
6124500	6126940	So, all right, moving on.
6126940	6129260	Let's get into our next story, Dark Sakura.
6130180	6131180	Wheel.
6131820	6139180	Speaking of things that are getting out, Kohl's has their Black Friday 2019 ad leaked.
6139620	6142020	It's got stuff in it that's very interesting.
6142980	6146700	So their deals are going to be actually pretty good.
6146700	6148500	I think last year's were really good too.
6149420	6156340	But right now is, you know, they've also been pretty universal for what they do.
6156340	6162820	So what their Black Friday promotion is right now is that you get $15 in Kohl's cash for every $50 that you spend.
6164220	6174620	And so this means that when you put that along with your doorbusters, you're getting like another like 60 to whatever bucks that you can spend on other things too.
6174620	6177220	I mean, not that I'm putting theirs up, but theirs was the leaked list.
6177780	6186260	So for the doorbusters that they're having this year is a PS4 one terabyte Fortnite Neo versa bundle for $200 with $60 in Kohl's cash.
6186500	6190260	So effectively, when you apply that cash to it, it's $139.99.
6191380	6197420	Xbox One S one terabyte with Jedi Fallen Order for $200, again with the same deal.
6197620	6205460	And then a switch with a carrying case and controller charging dock for $319.99 with $90 in their Kohl's cash.
6205460	6207220	So $229.99.
6207220	6220700	The Jedi Fallen Order bundle looks like it's probably going to be the big one a lot of people go to, but the switch one is pretty okay, especially with, you know, the incentive of their little Kohl's cash deal.
6220700	6224020	Yeah, I was gonna say, I think a switch is normally about $300 anyway.
6224020	6227580	But yeah, if you're like, you're like, oh, I want to buy new clothes on top of it.
6227580	6231340	It's a pretty good like the cash back or whatever the Kohl's card or whatever it's called.
6231340	6232500	It's pretty, pretty good deal.
6232500	6236820	And it doesn't it looks like the that not everyone's going to be super aggressive on it.
6236820	6245500	Because I think that people are already kind of agro on winning the the new the systems anyway, if they're going to buy them, they're going to buy them.
6245540	6255660	Yeah, I was gonna say this is this is I mean, and this is this year is the swan song apparently for these consoles, because next year we'll be talking about PlayStation five, whatever the next Xbox is a come the holidays.
6255820	6259740	So I mean, that's a real like they're that's a deep discount on both those consoles.
6259780	6263820	So if you have stopped for you have still not got on board, which is fine.
6263820	6267260	And not every gamer has that kind of income to buy the latest and greatest consoles.
6267260	6269860	Sometimes you have to get your games to garage, which is pretty steady.
6269860	6277660	And that's fine. But these Yeah, these consoles are a way to get on board if you you know, and especially now with the rich libraries, both these platforms have
6277700	6280260	Well, both I'm talking about the switch. That's three.
6280460	6284300	Well, well, but this is also a little newer, which isn't spot
6284300	6291980	They're not really advertising, they're not really pushing anything super aggressive for their marketing for the switch, because they know the switch is going to be a seller.
6292380	6298500	I mean, that's just going to go without saying, but I mean, the other two, I don't know that that's really a super aggressive.
6300220	6302820	Like deal for either of those either.
6302820	6305380	I mean, I said, I'm repeating my words now.
6305660	6313660	But I'm really I'm not really convinced that that's like the most aggressive way they can push it like as the we need you to buy these because they're going to be gone, blah, blah, blah.
6313660	6315500	I don't think I don't get that feel off of it.
6315540	6321460	Well, and but to be fair, this is also only the first of what is many Black Friday postings to come.
6321460	6324260	And, you know, the rest of the holidays as well.
6325220	6330940	You know, this is going to be the time still sub 200 is a pretty, pretty darn good way to get in to both these systems.
6330940	6335660	So, yeah, I'm sure the deals are just going to be even better at other places, too.
6335660	6339660	So it's that time of year when we get into the sales.
6339660	6341300	I can't believe November's like already here.
6341300	6345540	It's crazy. My mommy's birthday's in two days and I don't know what to get her.
6345580	6347380	Well, happy early birthday. Get her Nintendo Switch.
6347380	6351420	I'm just kidding. My mom would be like, maybe I'll get her an NES.
6352180	6354780	Well, I mean, you can always get a device.
6354780	6358540	I mean, as silly as it is to have a PlayStation or an Xbox, she wouldn't be into it.
6358540	6363660	But you could you use them as media centers, but maybe she's already got a Blu-ray player for my brother.
6363660	6367180	Yeah. And I was going to say maybe a Roku or something like that is a better I'll send her an S.
6367500	6369740	Yeah. She used to sneak into my room and play mine enough.
6369860	6373700	Oh, there you go. Now, get her one of the NES classics, if you can find one.
6374380	6376340	We'll see. All right. We'll see.
6376340	6379540	All right. Well, moving on to something that is sunsetting.
6379540	6381300	It's no longer going to be around.
6381300	6384860	And actually, I got to say, this one kind of surprises me, kind of doesn't.
6385500	6387860	Oh, I'm sorry. This is your story, Loki. My bad.
6387860	6390100	I was like bringing it up going. Oh, hold on.
6390700	6396380	Yes. So apparently PlayStation Vue is going to be done at the end of January.
6396860	6404420	So it was there Sony's kind of TV offering, and I did try it out for a little bit.
6405060	6407780	Wasn't all that impressed, especially when Comedy Central went away.
6408900	6411740	And apparently it just hasn't been doing that well, I guess.
6411820	6420380	So they said that for the inactive paid subscriptions will receive their final charge for PlayStation Vue in December 2019.
6420380	6425460	Unless they cancel prior to their billing date, they'll be able to watch until January 30th.
6426380	6433500	Well, yeah, they said they're going to remain focused on their core gaming business instead of this.
6437180	6443980	Interesting way to set the tone in advance of the PlayStation V, because I would have thought, oh, maybe.
6443980	6449620	I mean, I realize PlayStation Vue has not been doing so hot, especially because they have not been landing the right channels.
6449940	6451500	Yeah, it's been kind of like, yeah.
6451660	6464380	Yeah. So, you know, and maybe that has more to do with the general shift with people are kind of canceling their cable in favor of piecemealing the Netflix, Hulu, CBS, Disney, all this stuff.
6464580	6469580	Somebody added it all up. It's like 90 bucks if you want to get everything that's out there right now, a month.
6469780	6472660	So but anyway, people are kind of piecemealing what they want that way.
6472660	6478020	I don't know if it has to do with the cable going away or whatever, but it's going to be interesting when the PlayStation V kind of rolls out.
6478020	6482340	Like, is there going to be an emphasis on TV and media and that sort of thing?
6482620	6485860	We all know famously when the Xbox One was debuted.
6485860	6495580	And this was part of the reason that, you know, they kind of got shit for that reveal, especially Don Mattrick, because the message from that early, early reveal, if you guys remember, was TV, TV, sports, sports, sports.
6495580	6504380	But I don't even know if the Xbox One ever, like, kind of fulfilled that promise that they were going to do with like their even like the Windows Universal apps and stuff like that.
6504380	6506260	They had to dial back that whole introduction, remember?
6506260	6512140	Yeah, but yeah, but even like with the Windows 10 Universal apps, do they have like the support that they promised to have in there?
6512140	6522620	Because like I thought there was supposed to be all this additional functionality being added to the Xbox One with those Universal Windows platform apps that were supposed to run on the Xbox One natively.
6522620	6532220	But I don't think that ever happened to I mean, I know Skype and stuff sort of works in there, but I don't think there's been like a large support for that.
6532220	6538220	I don't think so either, but it's probably something that just isn't a priority right now while we wait on the next Xbox. That's my guess.
6539140	6542980	Some people are going to miss view, by the way, because you know, in chat says I'm going to miss view.
6543140	6546500	It was great. It had HBO, Cinemax, Starz, all the Disney channels.
6547500	6549020	Just scroll off it.
6549580	6549980	Darn it.
6550500	6551940	Disney's not going to be on there anymore.
6551980	6553180	It had picture in picture.
6553180	6554460	The basic plan was worth it.
6554660	6558220	All they were missing was Viacom, but no one watches MTV and all that trash.
6558300	6562620	Well, Disney is not going to be on there anymore, I'm assuming, so they're going to lose that.
6562620	6564020	And then who knows?
6564020	6564860	I mean, the other ones.
6564860	6569940	Yeah, by the way, Bobby wants to point out there has been support for that, what you're talking about.
6570300	6572620	That's how Antstream Arcade is on Xbox One.
6572620	6575780	For instance, it's the same Universal Windows app that's on PC.
6576020	6578220	HoloLens will also run the Universal Windows app.
6579020	6580420	Does Antstream work on HoloLens?
6580420	6582140	That's kind of kind of silly, but fun.
6582580	6584940	So, OK, so that's so I guess they can.
6585140	6592380	That actually does that does make sense because there have been other things I've played on PC that are just like 360 or excuse me, Xbox One.
6592620	6594700	So, yeah, interesting.
6595420	6597620	Anyway, let's move on now.
6597820	6602180	Loki kind of stole the thunder on this earlier, but that's OK, because this is more of a silly, quick thing.
6602380	6609580	But the official trademarks have been filed for PlayStation six, seven, eight, nine and 10.
6609820	6610300	That's right.
6610300	6614220	Trademark applications have been submitted for PlayStation six through 10 in Japan.
6614340	6615860	Obviously, they already did five.
6616460	6621300	But you know what? PlayStation can keep this naming convention all the way through PlayStation 10 if they want.
6621300	6629780	And I fully look forward to the wonderful gaming articles we'll see once the PlayStation nine comes around based on the original commercials that they had.
6629780	6630380	Oh, yeah.
6630380	6632460	Dark Tetsuya linked that old commercial.
6632460	6638300	I didn't I thought it was a little bit too much of a deep dive to play here, but you can Google it if you want.
6638860	6644380	And it is interesting, there was a commercial around the PlayStation two era that was trying to show off.
6644380	6646420	Here's what the PlayStation nine will be like.
6646420	6648220	And it was trying to show like the future of gaming.
6648300	6654940	And I think the whole point of the commercial was the future starts here with the upgrade from PlayStation to PlayStation two.
6655060	6657660	And then they set this path for PlayStation nine.
6657660	6663740	That was, you know, that was the holodeck, basically, as gaming gets one one step closer and closer to the holodeck.
6663740	6670460	So, yeah, it is interesting to note that PlayStation may keep these naming conventions all the way through PlayStation 10.
6670620	6675980	Of course, they don't have to trademark these names and not, you know, there's nothing making them do that.
6675980	6682340	So it's it's a little bit of a nonstarter starter, but people are, you know, making some jokes about it.
6682340	6687340	And that's why I made a little joke about it in the sidebar with my extreme enthusiasm for this news.
6687820	6696380	But it should be noted that Sony does have a history of future proofing the console strategy in 2006, which was the year that PlayStation three was released.
6696580	6701300	That is when they trademarked both PlayStation four and PlayStation five.
6701660	6707660	So PlayStation five was confirmed 14 years ago from when it's going to be released, basically.
6707660	6714260	So anyway, not to you know, at PlayStation has that mechanism.
6714260	6716220	It works for them. So why not?
6717820	6720740	Bonds 006 in our chat says name squatting.
6720940	6727020	It's not so much squatting when it's you doing it, but I can also see where they want to prevent other people from doing it.
6727180	6734020	But at the same time, I don't think I could just go in there and say, oh, I'm going to go trademark PlayStation 11 because they haven't gotten to that one yet.
6734020	6744180	Like, I wouldn't pass the test because Sony would be able to challenge that and it would cost me a lot of money in fees unless I had used the name PlayStation somewhere else.
6744420	6746660	So it would be it would be very, very silly.
6746740	6751020	But I do get what you're saying, like domain squatting and all that stuff is a very serious issue out there.
6751020	6756140	And, you know, something that is a bigger problem on the Internet, but bigger than we get into right now.
6756380	6759100	But what we can get into right now is a much simpler time.
6759260	6763020	Why? Why? Why talk about the PlayStation six or the PlayStation 10?
6763020	6769980	Well, we can all go all go back to an era before even the PlayStation one, a very good go back to something that didn't come out in America.
6769980	6771580	That's right. We can go all the way back.
6771980	6779660	So every week, Dark Soccer likes to step into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, you guys should be checking this out, the classic game of the week.
6779660	6787300	But once a month, Dark Soccer has to find a soundtrack as she mixes it up a little bit and does the classic soundtrack of the month.
6787460	6791940	And since we've been gone for so long, I think we hopped from soundtrack to soundtrack.
6791940	6796700	Right. Because I kind of did we did we get a September or excuse me, do we get an October soundtrack?
6797620	6800380	I think we did. Yeah, I'd have to look.
6800380	6802180	But I could always do another one, whatever.
6802260	6807700	I know. Well, anyway, I'll go check our wiki because they know more about the show than I do.
6808020	6810300	But I know we have a classic soundtrack of the month tonight.
6810580	6814780	And this is this is interesting because you're still seeing with your eight bit theme, but you went to a very different console.
6814900	6818740	I did, because, I mean, most of the people are familiar more with the NES of this.
6819100	6821540	But I think the better soundtrack is on the MSX, too.
6821900	6828740	And so, of course, I picked Metal Gear, kind of on a weird Kojima kick for reasons I can't imagine why.
6829300	6834140	Well, it's art, explosive diarrhea anyway.
6834820	6841940	But anyway, and I specifically went, though, for the MSX one, because the MSX two really did have a much better sound processor.
6841940	6843780	I mean, it was a damn computer, for fuck's sake.
6843780	6848060	So I mean, but I really enjoy the music.
6848060	6860020	It actually said that it's had a three person composer team of Mizutani Iku, Take no Uchi Shigahiru and Furukawa Motouaki.
6861460	6866860	And then I wouldn't say that the the NES version was a bad translation, but it wasn't all that good.
6867100	6879020	So going back to Mizutani, he actually did quite a bit of music for other games and created the sound driver at Natsume
6879500	6883380	and did a lot of work for the Super Nintendo.
6884220	6887380	But other games he did was Russian Attack.
6887860	6888980	Of course, there's Metal Gear.
6888980	6893380	There was Snatcher for PC-88, Snatcher for MSX.
6893980	6898660	I'm looking for a few other games that people might know better.
6898660	6902580	Shatterhand, he did some Sentai games.
6902580	6905980	Dragon Fighter, quite a few other ones.
6906540	6908540	Renegade, sound director.
6909260	6916060	And then Furukawa did looks like worked on Gradius and Salamander.
6916060	6923740	So I mean, we got some pretty good talent working on this game before some of the other titles came out.
6924100	6930340	And as for the MSX itself, the audio for it was actually really, really good.
6930340	6935700	They had MSX audio, which was released.
6935700	6951540	So it had the Yamaha Y8950, nine channels of FM or six channels of FM and five drums had hardware acceleration to bump up the sample rate to 256k for audio RAM.
6951540	6956340	So I mean, it was really just a good little machine for when it came out.
6956660	6964380	And a lot of the music ability was standard for all the MSX Turbo-R computers.
6964780	6966980	But it was built in on all the MSX2 systems.
6967140	6971220	So really good music.
6971220	6987060	And I think that Metal Gear being such an early title for Kojima, he had such in-depth direction over the whole game that you can feel his influence in with the music composition as well.
6987060	6998300	I mean, really, it's one of, I'd say, the better video game soundtracks out there, not just, you know, for MSX, but in general, it really fit the game.
6998300	7006420	It brought, you know, the action to life that that music really felt the stuff felt like it belonged to the stealth genre in particular.
7006940	7010340	So and of course, we got some what, some boss fight music in here.
7011380	7014980	I thought I had it within that first minute, but I don't have been talking.
7014980	7016300	Yeah, I think you were talking over it.
7016300	7020620	But yeah, I mean, I love the boss fight music in this game.
7021460	7025380	I think the clip I got ends with a boss theme too, but it's like a nine minute clip.
7025380	7026460	So we may not get there.
7026500	7030580	And I wouldn't say that the NES music was bad by any...
7030860	7033700	No, and it's what we all kind of remember too.
7033700	7042500	It's very interesting how butchered this game was in the US, but yet it still sold so well here.
7042500	7050020	It sold so well, in fact, that they ended up making that whole Snake's Revenge that like Kojima kind of was like, that wasn't my game.
7050020	7052940	I wish I could find that documentary that we watched.
7053260	7058620	But the really interesting thing about it is that like, basically people were like, yeah, this version isn't good.
7058620	7060860	We want you to do another, please, please, please, please, like fine.
7061380	7062100	And he did another.
7062580	7069380	And then, of course, it became really the one of the series that totally pushed his career.
7069380	7077020	And then, of course, you know, Snatcher didn't really sell that well when it came out, but it, you know, of course, picked up that cult following.
7077020	7085700	And then we got, you know, the more deluxe versions of Snatcher and then, you know, Policenauts was really out there and then we got Metal Gear Solid.
7085700	7102100	So, you know, I think that all of those games really, though, have this to thank for it in the direction of just that level of storytelling and the environment that was created.
7102100	7104540	And I think music goes a long way to creating that environment.
7104580	7105620	Is there a way to play?
7105620	7109940	Because I noticed this particular streamer is using like an English version of the MSX.
7109940	7112140	Oh, yeah, there's translated ROMs out there.
7112140	7118940	I thought I remember hearing there was a, like, they put the MSX version of Metal Gear in like Metal Gear Solid 3 or something like that.
7118940	7119580	Yes.
7119620	7121900	Um, so I remember that was the thing that I heard.
7121940	7123100	Going back to that.
7123660	7125700	Because I've never played the MSX version.
7125700	7130380	I would really like to, just because I loved the original Metal Gear when I was a kid.
7130540	7140580	But then when I found out, you know, obviously years later that like, holy shit, like they completely changed the last boss in the game to like, I always thought it was weird.
7140580	7144300	I was like, why is Metal Gear just like this big computer you kill with explosives?
7144580	7151140	Because they, the mapper they used or something couldn't handle the actual Metal Gear looking mech thing.
7151380	7163020	So just as an FYI, there was a port of the MSX2 Metal Gear for phones through Konami's NetDX service in Japan as a promo for Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater.
7163860	7183620	Um, and it, uh, the updated port also, uh, it says it served as a basis for the version included on the second disc of subsistence, which is the expanded edition of Metal Gear Solid 3 for PS2 and then HD edition for PS3 also included it and the Vita version.
7183940	7188900	The MSX2 Metal Gear was also released as a virtual console download for Wii in Japan.
7189420	7194860	Um, the ROM used the, uh, the ROM was used for an emulated rerelease.
7195340	7197340	Um, so there you go.
7197740	7205180	Um, and they're confirming that in chat active says, um, MGS3 subsistence has it, uh, Johnny Wu-Fei says it should be on the HD collection.
7205900	7206220	Yeah.
7206420	7210740	And I know that, you know, Dan certainly has played through it.
7210740	7214900	I, I sat and played through it for a little bit, but honestly it's.
7215900	7219700	If you're in the house and someone else is already playing some of this, or like, why the fuck am I playing it?
7220700	7224140	But, well, neat, neat to highlight the MSX version too.
7224140	7230540	So you can hear the differences, especially when I think so many of us are familiar with the NES version, which again, isn't bad.
7230900	7234580	Uh, but it just wasn't quite the same thing as the MSX version.
7234580	7238700	So it's kind of interesting to go back to the roots of where the series was at.
7239300	7245180	Well, and also, I mean, the, there was so much cut out in the, the NES version.
7245820	7250180	And I think that of course, graphically, the MSX two just ran circles around it.
7250180	7254500	Cause I mean, hello, it's a computer and it had more capability than the nested.
7255100	7265260	So, and honestly, I think that if this game had been made originally for NES instead of MSX two, it might not have even gotten the following that it did.
7265300	7271180	So I think because it has such a big following for MSX two in Japan, that it led the way for the next one.
7271180	7274620	And then, you know, that's my theory.
7274620	7277900	I can't articulate it quite well right now because of drugs.
7278060	7278740	No, you're fine.
7280300	7280620	All right.
7280620	7290140	So there it is your classic soundtrack of the month, metal gear, but specifically the MSX version, MSX two, excuse me, version of metal gear.
7290140	7290740	So there you go.
7291060	7301060	Um, and I did want to say just to just clarify, I did, I did a little research and the very last OLR we did before the break, you highlighted DuckTales as October's pick for South course.
7301060	7305940	Yeah, I know what, how much we forget and, uh, three weeks of being gone, but there you go.
7305940	7307180	So, all right.
7307260	7308220	I think anymore coffee.
7308620	7309420	So, all right.
7309660	7310300	You need more coffee?
7310300	7310820	Yeah, I think so.
7310820	7312300	Well, sadly, I don't have a break tonight.
7312380	7313980	We're going to get right into rapid fire news.
7314100	7315140	Maybe Alan can help.
7315140	7316260	Cause I hear Alan just got back.
7316460	7317740	Oh, Alan, somebody in chat.
7317740	7318500	Wanted your take on this.
7318500	7320220	Can you, can I bug you to come on the show?
7320860	7321980	Come sit on Pikachu's lap.
7323060	7323420	Okay.
7323700	7324340	Hi Alan.
7324340	7325420	It's always nice to have you here.
7325420	7327900	This is, um, this is my other half Alan.
7327900	7328260	Hi.
7328460	7329140	Um, thank you, Matt.
7329340	7338420	So, uh, so with some, uh, questions in chat, cause we were talking about Diablo earlier in the show and I don't know, have you been following the news that came out of Blizzcon and all that stuff would like Diablo and all that?
7339260	7340060	Not with Diablo.
7340060	7340980	I just know that it's a thing.
7340980	7342460	They finally are given a Diablo four.
7342460	7344940	Well, cause you were super into Diablo three.
7344940	7349660	So somebody in our chat specifically asked, what was Alan's take on Diablo four?
7349660	7352460	I haven't seen any, like, I've never seen this.
7352580	7354460	Oh, you didn't even look at this game play trail or anything?
7354500	7360860	Well, now that you've seen, I mean, it's, it's Diablo, but look, druids, they have druids now and he turns into a bear.
7360860	7362620	He goes rawr and he smashes everybody.
7364140	7373700	Well, I mean, it's kind of, I mean, it's probably like witch doctor reskinned a little bit or barbarian reskinned a little bit.
7373740	7377700	Like, I mean, there's only so many powers, but however, like I'm, I'm not being a hater.
7377700	7378660	It's just, you know,
7378820	7379340	Oh, that's okay.
7379340	7380940	So you're just not well-researched on Diablo.
7381100	7382340	What have you been playing then?
7382340	7383340	I'll bug you on that real quick.
7383380	7390940	Um, I've been playing lots of, uh, I mentioned this last time I was on the show, um, doom with project brutality three.
7391900	7395140	I've been playing, uh, postal too.
7395300	7396940	Cause I found that is random.
7396940	7398780	What made you get into postal too?
7398780	7402100	Cause I can't not associate that series with the terrible movie.
7402860	7406020	Well, um, is that guy still around that director?
7406060	7406660	Uwe Boll?
7406660	7406980	Yeah.
7407020	7408660	He pretty much got laughed out of the industry.
7408700	7408980	Okay.
7408980	7409420	It's fine.
7409740	7419260	Um, because I watch, I basically, I subscribe to a bunch of modding channels, like Skyrim.
7419260	7420980	Watches a lot of YouTube guys.
7421020	7421340	Yeah.
7421460	7425860	Like I have YouTube red because I, I forget that you're the only person I know with YouTube red.
7426540	7427140	Well, it's wait.
7427140	7427940	Look, he wants to jump in.
7428700	7433780	I like to add as of 2016, Uwe Boll is no longer a film producer.
7434540	7436620	He's a restaurant tour and he's a food.
7436620	7437660	He's a food critic.
7437740	7438500	Oh boy.
7438500	7442420	Anyway, get him on, um, he opened a restaurant called Bauhaus and that makes me happy.
7443220	7445300	I want to see Gordon Ramsey go to his restaurant.
7445300	7447140	I was going to say, get him on kitchen nightmares.
7447180	7453980	Um, so I'm on these YouTube channels that showcase mods.
7453980	7460940	And when you watch those in your recommended, it will be like mod for whatever.
7460940	7464420	And then I'm like, Oh, I didn't know that.
7464820	7468460	Or like, I haven't thought, like, for example, I have a, um,
7468500	7473460	I haven't looked at Oblivion or Skyrim mods in like three years.
7473460	7480900	So the next time I go onto the nexus, it's going to be like, Oh, there's 2,500 mods that are neat that I can check out.
7481180	7483900	That's kind of how I discovered project brutality three for doom.
7484220	7490540	So I saw something, I saw that, um, they patched in running, running with scissors, patched in.
7490980	7497900	Um, when you go to the mall to meet Gary Coleman, one of the stores said closed for renovations,
7497900	7504140	opening October of 20, uh, uh, it was 2016 or 2018 or something.
7504180	7509220	I, and in 2003, that's funny because that's 13 years from now.
7509220	7509860	Well, guess what?
7509860	7511420	It's now 15 years in the future.
7511420	7516460	So they actually went and made a, well, I guess it's 2016, so we better go patch in.
7516460	7517500	So I saw that.
7517740	7524940	And then I realized, Oh, they put out an actual, um, they retcon postal three and they put in an expansion to postal two.
7525820	7527580	Uh, I think it came out in 2015.
7527580	7530100	It's called paradise lost.
7530700	7537260	Um, so yeah, they supported running with scissors, supported postal two with an expansion 13 years after the fact.
7537260	7538580	And I was like, Oh, that's neat.
7538580	7541860	So then I fell down that rabbit hole, especially when they're up to like what I see local looking up.
7541860	7542140	Yes.
7542140	7543660	But have you played postal four?
7544340	7545300	No regrets.
7547220	7547980	I haven't.
7547980	7548660	I'm going to wait.
7548660	7553180	Cause right now you pay for early access and they are basically like it's post alpha.
7553500	7555860	There's not really like there's some quest.
7555860	7569420	It's obviously they're trying to recapture the, um, uh, the, um, magic, I guess if you'd call it that of postal two, I'm going to, I'm going to let that, I think that if you eat, if you eat raw dough, you'll get sick.
7569460	7571380	So I'm going to let that bake in the oven for a bit.
7571940	7577380	Um, it looks, I mean, it looks great for like a proof of concept, but I'm not, I'm not that much of an early adopter.
7578060	7584180	Um, uh, yeah, so no, it looks neat, but I, I'm going to wait for the mod.
7584180	7585300	I'm going to abstain.
7585300	7588620	Well, it doesn't have to be modded necessarily, but I just came out.
7589060	7591140	Um, but yeah, postal four, no regrets.
7591260	7594580	Um, uh, yeah.
7594660	7595780	So, all right.
7595780	7599260	Well, it's you, you are the mod king of OLR as far as, well, I don't know.
7599260	7601620	Logie likes mods too, but you really like mods.
7601620	7610140	I feel like maybe it's just cause I live with you, but you, you are really, it's why, it's why it's like, I, there are other reasons why I don't like to play on console.
7610140	7615180	Just, I like the coziness of my monitor, my two monitors and being at my desk.
7615180	7618500	And it's like this little bubble that I'm in where it's playing on a couch in a living room.
7618500	7619380	Feels weird to me.
7619940	7625140	Um, cause I will, cause also I like to all tab and like look at Twitter and stuff and not be on my phone.
7625340	7628260	So I'll just like pause doom and go look at Tumblr or whatever.
7628620	7631540	Um, I like that you can't really do that on console or you can't do it well.
7631580	7632940	You have to have a tablet or something.
7632980	7635340	One other question for you before we move on with the show.
7635420	7639740	Have you been, uh, I noticed you've been kind of like watching, we have like that giant screen screen that
7639740	7643740	separates our office sometimes you have to kind of like poke around to see what I'm doing, I'm doing.
7643740	7647660	And I noticed you've kind of been like surprised, like, Oh, Rob's playing like bloodstain or he's playing
7647660	7649340	like things that aren't Final Fantasy 14.
7649340	7650380	Like how, how has that been?
7650380	7650580	Yeah.
7650580	7655060	Cause I know, you know, you haven't, I can't really recall what the last new game was.
7655060	7655740	You were really.
7656460	7661620	Psych because you have gamer ADD and you'll buy, like you'll buy stuff the week it comes out and then
7661620	7664740	you'll play it for a couple of days and then you won't play it again.
7664780	7665780	Drag me, expose me.
7665780	7670460	And then if I'm like, Oh, Oh, when are you going to be no man's sky or when you're going to beat?
7670460	7673340	And obviously I'm trolling you and you'll say, never fuck off.
7673340	7676540	Like, you know, that it's, that was 20 days ago.
7676580	7678820	I never, I'm literally never playing that again.
7679300	7683860	Um, so yeah, aside from 14, I don't really know what you've been playing.
7683980	7687060	So when I saw you play bloodstain, I'm like, Oh, that came out like six months ago.
7687060	7688500	Why are you, why are you playing that?
7688860	7692140	You play that, you play that the first week it's out and then never at all.
7692140	7693580	Cause it was on Xbox game pass.
7693620	7695940	So it was a chance for me to go back and visit.
7695940	7696860	I'm not playing it on the switch.
7696860	7697780	I'm playing it on PC.
7697820	7698300	Gotcha.
7698340	7698660	Okay.
7698660	7699260	It makes sense.
7699940	7704980	Anyway, we got to get back with the show, but thank you for coming on and giving us your updates.
7705060	7705540	Appreciate it.
7705540	7710180	It's been a little bit, so, and, uh, you're coming to New York with me next week, so that'll be fun.
7710180	7711340	Get to meet some of the listeners.
7711740	7715100	It sounds like we're going to do that and get, get to see some shows.
7715100	7716500	So I'm really excited about that.
7716740	7716980	All right.
7716980	7717420	Thank you, Alan.
7718140	7718500	All right.
7719260	7725300	Let's get into some rapid fire news and talk quickly about some other things happening around the, happening around the industry.
7725540	7730380	Uh, this week, Loki, it's another month, so there's more free things that you get to look forward to.
7730740	7737820	So if you are a PlayStation plus subscriber, you'll be getting Neo and Outlast 2 for the games for November.
7737980	7740660	That's from November 5th through December 3rd.
7741300	7750620	And then on the Xbox side of things, Sherlock Holmes, the devil's daughter from the first to the 30th and the final station from the 16th through December 15th.
7751220	7752540	And those are Xbox One games.
7752540	7762620	And of course the Xbox 360 compatible games, Star Wars, Jedi Starfighter for the first half of November and Joyride Turbo on the second half.
7763980	7769380	And then last but not least, um, Epic Games has more free games.
7769420	7776820	Remember to check the back every single week because they've got new games that keep, um, sorting through there or they keep, you know, cycling them through.
7777060	7781900	This week, of course, uh, to go along with, uh, Halloween, we have Costume Quest and Soma.
7781980	7783820	So those are free until November 7th.
7784260	7790900	And then, uh, they think they had next week's listed as well, but I have to pull these up real fast.
7790900	7792780	But yeah, definitely keep an eye on that.
7792780	7798340	I tend to grab things even if I have no interest in actually playing them because you never know.
7798660	7800540	You never know when you might want to do that.
7800580	7804540	Uh, Nuclear Throne and Ruiner are going to be, um, the week after.
7804580	7806860	And those actually, I think Ruiner sounded pretty cool.
7806860	7808260	I think I already have Nuclear Throne though.
7808340	7812620	I have Soma and Costume Quest on Steam already, but why not?
7813620	7814820	I have it on all the platforms.
7815860	7816380	All right.
7816460	7819220	Uh, moving on, let's talk about The Witcher, which I forgot to mention.
7819220	7822940	I actually reinstalled Witcher 3 cause I totally forgot to mention on my good old games.
7823220	7825460	I got on a kick with covert action again.
7825460	7829700	I just, I had a bug to play Sid Meier's covert action, which I have on GOG.
7830060	7831740	Um, and so I was playing that a little bit.
7831780	7833260	I, that's one of my favorite classics.
7833260	7837420	I'm going to do a covert action stream sometimes so I can explain why I love this game so fucking much.
7837780	7842460	Uh, but then I was like, once I installed GOG, I was like, Witcher 3, I need to play that again.
7842620	7846900	And so I actually spent a little bit with Witcher 3 until I got sucked into Bloodstained.
7846900	7850900	But I need to go back and play more because I got like past the tutorial and I was doing like the first couple of quests.
7851260	7857460	And, um, yeah, so I didn't even like get into that in my gaming week, but there's just been so many weeks that we've been gone.
7857700	7864100	But a lot of people are still talking about The Witcher because some more information came out about the Netflix series, which to be fair is not based on the game.
7864100	7866500	It's based on the books, which also the game was based on.
7866500	7879500	So it's, it's not directly a video game thing, but then they showed that trailer that has the bathtub scene recreated, which is all anybody ever wanted was for Henry Cavill to recreate the, uh, Geralt bathtub scene.
7879740	7880860	That will be happening.
7880900	7886820	In the series, uh, to the delight of many, uh, that will be on December 20th is when The Witcher series is going to be coming out.
7886820	7888900	Did some of you guys watch that new trailer that came out?
7888900	7889220	I did.
7889220	7889500	It did.
7889500	7891340	Yeah, it looks pretty good.
7891340	7892460	So, um, I'll be curious.
7892580	7899700	There was also a panel that they did recently and that the show is going to focus on Ciri and Yennefer more so than Geralt.
7899860	7902740	So that's kind of interesting because the games focus on Geralt.
7902740	7907060	So there's already a little bit of a difference right there, but we'll see what happens with that.
7907420	7915620	Uh, the other thing I had to talk about, we kind of got into already earlier in the show, I will just mention Pokemon sword and shield leaks are out there.
7915620	7916140	That's right.
7916180	7919300	Uh, some information is leaking on the new sword and shield games.
7919540	7928780	Um, again, I want to respect those that are staying away from the leaks, so I'm not going to detail all of those, but if you want to go look out, look at what are all the Gigantamax Pokemon that are in the game.
7928980	7930260	That information's out there.
7930900	7940940	It sounds like just before the show, Shane was texting me about the complete Pokedex information is breaking as well as to what Pokemon have been cut and how many Pokemon are there.
7941140	7947940	Uh, last I heard though, that was still developing as I think it was, there may be more after you beat the game and question mark.
7947940	7954220	So there may not have the final final version, but at least we have plenty of Pokemon confirmed that are in the game.
7954220	7955260	So I'll leave it at that.
7955500	7962340	Um, and then, uh, you can also see some of the new, uh, there's not, uh, uh, I think we all saw the Ponyta or Ponyta.
7962460	7964700	We saw that new form, the Galar form of that.
7964820	7969180	There are some Galar form showing up for other Pokemon, and you can go look at those as well.
7969340	7973260	Uh, the complete evolution line of the three starter Pokemon are out there as well.
7973380	7981260	If you want to go searching for those on Twitter and look that up as well, the internet has a lot of that stuff out there or just private message Shane directly.
7981460	7989180	He will be happy to talk your ear off about all of the leaks and all that stuff because this is so funny because he told me, he said, I, the leaks are coming out.
7989180	7992020	I'm getting off the internet for two weeks cause I can't read any of the leaks.
7992020	7997860	And then I shit you not like four hours later, I read all the leaks and they'd start getting pictures of all that Pokemon.
7997860	8000660	And yeah, so that didn't last very long, but that's all right.
8000660	8005820	I understand these games are just around the corner and some people are getting very excited about it, but the leaks are out there.
8005820	8010900	So if you're trying to stay away from the leaks, you may have to have a little more restraint than Shane had with that.
8010900	8012580	You're gonna have to really stay off social media.
8012780	8016380	In fact, some of that is probably already crossing your dashboard.
8016380	8019340	So, uh, hope you can avoid that, uh, until the game is out.
8019860	8021700	Uh, anyway, moving on dark soccer, what do you have?
8023140	8028460	I have just realized that I can actually understand more Spanish while I'm high as a kite than I can when I'm sober.
8029340	8030260	I don't know.
8030260	8031980	It's like how I am when I read French.
8032340	8037140	Um, but, uh, Soul Calibur getting a new character.
8037140	8049980	They just revealed, uh, Hilda, who honestly, I totally freaking love her outfit, but she kind of makes me think of Cersei in Game of Thrones chair swords, just with her whole armor and dress and short hair thing.
8050460	8058460	Um, but anyway, um, there's not a release date, um, for when she's going to be out, but I mean, she looks pretty cool.
8059100	8059620	Yay.
8060220	8067420	And then also, um, uh, the outer world, um, has credits that include D and D characters.
8068980	8070580	That's pretty cool.
8070580	8073060	I'm actually trying to see, um, uh, yeah.
8073060	8084740	John Cotto's five, fifth edition campaign have forever after like, okay, well, if you're D and D I have trouble, I've actually written stories based off of D and D characters.
8085420	8091860	I think that's why they were credited because I think they were playing D and D to get inspiration for their game.
8091860	8099060	And so, because like, you know, and they actually had characters that died in their thing and they, uh, they have a whole tribute section in their credits.
8099060	8108860	I think a lot of it is supposed to be for real people, uh, that passed during the making of the game, but they kind of gave the nod to the D and D characters too, because their D the D and D campaigns creatively shaped.
8109180	8110700	What ended up being the outer world.
8110700	8112580	So I just thought it was kind of funny.
8112740	8117380	Like, you know, you don't always see like fake characters credited in games, but I thought it was cute.
8117780	8122780	Well, honestly though, there, how there's a lot of, let me start over.
8123020	8123420	Okay.
8124220	8129460	There's a lot of stories out there that are based off of people's role plays and fan fiction.
8129460	8136540	I mean, yes, 50 Shades of Shit was based off of, you know, Twilight fan fiction.
8137020	8146820	But I mean, if you want to go back further, one of my favorite anime series ever and novel now that I'm reading, Record of Lodoss War was built off of a tabletop role play game.
8147340	8157820	So, I mean, just as an example, some of the characters that I'm putting into the novel that I'm working, I'm not officially doing the national novel writing thing, but I'm starting on our remote or whatever.
8157860	8158500	Yeah, whatever it is.
8158700	8159580	I'll try this November.
8159580	8162740	It's supposed to be not a pod mode for some people to the daily podcast thing.
8162740	8165060	I always say I'm going to do that some year and then I forget.
8165420	8172740	Oh, at any rate, I, uh, words, um, God, I can't speak D and D.
8172820	8173300	Yeah.
8173340	8178300	Um, but there are characters from old D and D campaigns of mine that are totally ending up in my story.
8179020	8179900	So same.
8181340	8184940	Uh, pixel pox, uh, pixel pockets and chat says daily podcast.
8185140	8191460	Yeah, it's more, it's not so much for like gaming podcasters and news related things, but there's a lot of like personal podcasts out there.
8191460	8192260	That was a rabbit hole.
8192300	8194740	I fell down some time ago and I thought it was very fascinating.
8194740	8204300	Like, especially like some, uh, folks in the LGBTQ plus community that I know, like had like daily podcasts that were more like, they're almost like blogs maybe, but they're like audio blogs.
8204580	8212180	And so there would be some folks that would do these that would participate in this daily, you know, November thing where they basically putting out a podcast every day.
8212180	8213260	And it was just, it was interesting.
8213260	8217580	It was like hearing somebody read their live journal entries, but they were kind of like talking through it.
8217900	8232620	I, I always thought a podcast like that might be interesting, but I don't, I also don't think I'm that interesting, but I thought maybe if I had like some topics I could talk about every day where I could like mix in like, here's my life and here's my funniest moment from the second grade or something.
8232620	8240580	Like I could maybe fill out 30 days, but then I, then I'm like, eh, I should take that energy and focus on the podcast I have or several.
8240580	8244820	Cause I mean, there's been, oftentimes I have two or three podcasts running at once, but you know.
8245340	8247020	Oh, we still have things to talk about.
8247020	8249500	I know there's, and there's always more ideas out there on the table.
8249500	8250100	That's for sure.
8250420	8254780	Let's travel around the world and check out some release dates of some games that will be coming out very, very soon.
8254780	8256140	We'll start in the U S Loki.

8327620	8341340	Uh, there's also a brand new PlayStation four, like a, it's a like one terabyte, a PlayStation four pro one terabyte hard drive death stranding limited edition also coming out in Japan, which I think we're also getting anyway here in the U S so it's, I don't think there's any major differences between the two.
8341820	8342820	Uh, but death stranding is the big release.
8342820	8347420	There are a few other minor releases in Japan this week, such as a Fortnite dark fire bundle.
8347700	8353700	I don't know if Fortnite quite enjoys the same popularity in Japan, but they do have a localized version of it themselves.
8354620	8359220	So you can pick up the dark file fire bundle, which I guess would be more like physical release of the game.
8359220	8364820	You can pick that up for about 30 bucks, uh, but the equivalent in yen, uh, over in Japan this week.
8365060	8368100	Uh, and then I think that's, I think that's really it.
8368140	8370580	Oh, there's a need for speed game this week too in Japan.
8370580	8373380	Need for speed heat is also out this week in Japan.
8373380	8376820	That's for PlayStation four looking quickly at Nintendo switch.
8376820	8378580	I just want to make sure I'm not missing anything there.
8378780	8380740	Uh, the Fortnite bundle is there as well.
8380900	8383100	And then there is a, this is a mouthful.
8383100	8386700	You're ready for this Sumiko Gurashi, the movie.
8386780	8389180	Oh, that's, I have a notebook with those little animals on it.
8389180	8389300	Yeah.
8389340	8391420	The pop-up book and the secret child.
8391460	8393660	Let's play the worlds of picture books in a game.
8393780	8402500	That is the full title that is out on the switch this week, as well as the fruit labyrinth and Eden of Grisaia full package.
8403580	8407140	I don't know some people like a full package, the fruit, the labyrinth.
8407180	8408380	Oh, it's an anime game.
8408580	8409260	Of course it is.
8409340	8410060	Of course it is.
8410100	8410660	Of course it is.
8410780	8417860	That will include the prologue, the after story, the short scenario, the leisure of Grisaia, the afterglow of Grisaia and the melody of Grisaia.
8417860	8422860	I wonder if it's a repackaging of older games, but anyway, that is what your release dates look like in Japan this week.
8422860	8423940	How about the UK Dark Sakura?
8424300	8430900	On the fourth, we have grip combat racing, ultimate edition, uh, just dance 2020.
8431220	8434020	We have north guard, uh, on the seventh.
8434060	8437700	Also on the seventh is will a wonderful world, which actually looks kind of cute.
8438100	8449220	Jumanji the video game because of reasons, stranded sails, um, golem only on PlayStation looks like, um, a Siberia trilogy.
8449820	8453420	I wonder if it's the old Siberia games.
8453460	8453940	I have to look.
8454420	8464740	Um, horizon chase turbo for PlayStation, Capcom home arcade on the seventh, need for speed heat, um, and intend to switch light.
8464980	8467540	Is that, uh, how do you pronounce the fuck out of these?
8468100	8481780	Zacian and Zamazenta edition, uh, Tokyo and Sonic at the Olympics games, Tokyo 2020, super street, the game, death stranding, uh, Disney Tsum Tsum festival.
8481940	8490100	Uh, there's a bunch Layton's mystery journey, catch rail and the millionaire's conspiracy words.
8490660	8496860	Um, that is it for this portion of the week, although there's a game coming out next week that just is absolutely fascinating.
8497220	8498340	The unicorn princess.
8498780	8499180	Yay.
8499220	8501420	I kind of want to play it just cause it's the unicorn princess.
8501700	8502140	Why not?
8502460	8505300	All right, let me get into a few comments and then we're going to get into the mailbag.
8505300	8506580	Cause I think we're a little bit behind.
8506580	8507180	Oh, nevermind.
8507180	8508420	It's a shitty little tween game.
8508580	8508860	Okay.
8509220	8513660	We have a lot of emails to get into tonight, which we're going to participate at orange on Trudy.com.
8513660	8515820	But first I want to read some comments on the release date stuff.
8516100	8520460	Uh, Johnny Woo face says, I'm glad doom got delayed too many releases this month.
8520500	8521100	LOL.
8521260	8521660	Yeah.
8521660	8524740	What death stranding is this week and the next week is Pokemon.
8524740	8532660	And so it's, it's really ramping up as we get closer to, uh, you know, Thanksgiving and the official kickoff of the holiday season, uh, shopping season anyway.
8532660	8534940	So yeah, November is always a crazy month.
8534940	8540100	And then pixel pockets confirming that Grisaia that game I was talking about in Japan is a visual novel series.
8540220	8541940	Some are available in English.
8542140	8545660	Bobby Blackoff also pointing out Google Stadia is next weekend as well.
8545660	8547260	So you also have a console.
8547260	8555220	I'm using my quotey fingers also this weekend, although that is only the like pro one that, or the Chromecast one, right?
8555420	8559980	Not you get the 2020 is when you can just fire up your browser and do Stadia that way.
8559980	8560260	Right.
8560260	8562620	This is the special Chromecast bundle one.
8562620	8564260	So, um,
8564300	8566580	I'm rushing right out to go get one of those.
8566940	8570740	I'm curious to hear what other, or other early adopters think of it.
8571060	8575380	Uh, and I'll, you know, make, I just went destiny too is like the game.
8575420	8576900	I'm just kind of like, okay.
8576940	8583100	I'm like, I can already play destiny too on PC, but I, I still am very anxious to hear about the technology and all that.
8583100	8584180	So I'm trying to keep an open mind.
8584180	8586500	So very curious to hear what all that is in store.
8586860	8587140	Okay.
8587140	8589820	So we are going to get to the mailbag.
8589820	8591420	I think we have a lot of emails to get to tonight.
8591660	8600900	And because we have three, because we forgot to do it during the classic game of the week segment, I want to make sure we open up the community gift chest here on Twitch.
8601060	8616340	So for those of you that are watching live on Twitch TV, you can contribute to the gift chest and you can actually, if you're a prime person, you can contribute some gifts to the gift chest and we will give them away in our chat here.
8616340	8618940	It's all through the Twitch mechanism of the community gift chest.
8618940	8622940	So that is open and we'll stay open through our mailbag segment.
8623100	8624460	And hopefully I did that right.
8624460	8630780	And it is actually open because I'm not, I'm just looking at it on my screen right now on the dashboard.
8631060	8633100	Bobby will tell me if I did it wrong and he'll fix it.
8634460	8637660	In the meantime, Dark Soccer, let's get to the emails.
8638460	8640140	Hey guys, it's Flea here.
8640900	8643020	By the way, this one is from the 20th.
8644340	8646420	First off, I want to say how much I enjoy your podcast.
8646420	8647780	Look forward to listening every week.
8647900	8648460	Oops.
8649140	8653900	I was listening to your discussion last week about the Blizzard China controversy and I'd like to put my two cents in.
8654780	8658900	I'm a little baffled at the outrage online regarding the action that Blizzard took against this player.
8659220	8667980	While I support free speech, Blizzchung signed a contract that he would not speak in a way that could offend anyone or damage Blizzard as a company.
8668980	8675820	And the contract specifically mentions that doing so would lead to a forfeiture of the prize money and removal from grandmasters.
8675860	8678780	Blizzard has a legal obligation to follow through and these terms are not met.
8679500	8692700	It's very obvious now that what Blizzchung said has dragged them into political discourse of what is happening in Hong Kong and Blizzard upholding their contract has damaged their reputation, which is ironically what this cause in the contract was meant to avoid.
8693660	8700820	I will say that I'm glad Blizzard walked back their penalty in the end and I hope they amend their contract to be more forgiving in the future.
8701540	8711140	I really find it disingenuous, I can't make words, disingenuous that the gamer population who in September were tripping over themselves to buy the new iPhone.
8711700	8718660	I'm not, fuck, we already just, it's another one of the Apple whatever, you know, are doing that.
8719340	8720460	I don't want to fucking read this.
8720900	8725300	No, we, Dark Soccer is a little bit on the meds.
8726020	8729540	We did address many of the points in the email, but I do want to make sure the listeners.
8729540	8739420	Were tripping over themselves to buy the new iPhone from Apple, are also holding bullshit to a separate standard when all they did was take away prize money for an e-sport, which Apple banned an app designed to keep protesters safe and could actually save lives.
8739460	8740660	No, that's not the fucking point.
8741900	8752060	This is a tough time as companies are navigating if they're going to uphold the standards of free democratic internet or if they will censor themselves to comply with the censorship of the Chinese internet.
8752420	8756260	We need to remember that there are people behind these difficult decisions and mistakes will be made.
8756300	8757660	Anyway, enough ranting for me.
8757700	8759700	Thanks for everything you guys do.
8759860	8760340	It's flee.
8760780	8764940	PS included the text from the contract below that pertains to why he was banned.
8765540	8779180	Engaging any act that in Blizzard's sole discretion brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public or otherwise damages Blizzard's image will result in removal from Grandmasters and reduction of the player's prize total to zero USD.
8779620	8784820	In addition to other remedies which may be provided under the handbook and Blizzard's website terms are still so subjective.
8785780	8789620	Yeah, you know, and I feel like I did address a lot of these points earlier in the show.
8789660	8792580	I just want to make sure you know what, it's where every gamer has a voice.
8792620	8796340	So I'm just like, it's my brain right now.
8796380	8797700	Just yeah, it's fine.
8798020	8807580	But here's the thing I do want to make this very clear is that I'm a little less on the blitzchung thing, especially ever since they dialed it back to the six months.
8807940	8817140	I still think it's a little bit much, but what really irritated me is when you put this side by side with how they treated the Overwatch League issues and what's been going on over there.
8817180	8821100	I felt that this was way too extreme compared to what was going on over there.
8821140	8823220	And that is really kind of like the root cause.
8823460	8828780	And I mean, just add that onto the pile of, you know, everything else where Blizzard is misstepped.
8828820	8835740	I just feel like I've given Blizzard so much loyalty and a lot of these things, these actions are starting to make me question, well, why is that?
8835980	8845900	And so again, I'm not, I'm not personally, I'm not boycotting Blizzard, but I just want to see other people for a little while and on top of that, Blizzard handle their issues.
8845940	8853660	Keep in mind, people are so quick to point the finger at the biggest other company there is, but they're not the only one doing this.
8854060	8857140	You know, they're two completely different things.
8857180	8858060	It's a game.
8858140	8868820	And it's also, it's also the thing where it's like, you can invoke Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, you can invoke whoever you want to invoke, but they are separate issues.
8868860	8872860	And I think you have to kind of assess what works for you and what doesn't work.
8872900	8876620	And again, like I said, in its core, it's a fallacious argument.
8877060	8878220	It's absolutely fallacious.
8878420	8885860	I also completely understand, for example, like I know the gals from Girls Gone Wow, because they just put out two episodes from being at BlizzCon.
8885940	8890660	I haven't been able to listen to them yet just because I've had a busy weekend, but I know they went and they had a great time.
8890700	8892380	They were smiling big in their pictures.
8892580	8895180	They got to meet a lot of community members for the first time.
8895380	8900180	Am I going to be upset at them for supporting Blizzard because they shut down?
8900860	8901620	No, I'm not.
8901660	8902580	Absolutely not.
8902620	8914380	I'm actually like super happy for them that they got to like be celebrities, the celebrities that they are at BlizzCon and meet all those new people, because I also realized at the end of the day, BlizzCon is very much like a family gathering for some people.
8915020	8918340	And so that is, you know, like their moment.
8919020	8926740	I think the Blizzard handled the protests and all that appropriately, such as we mentioned earlier in the show, and the protester kind of went to take the mic.
8926980	8932540	They had their system set up to just let that person talk, not shut it down, you know, and do that whole thing.
8932580	8934660	They were pretty professional about all that.
8935180	8937380	And we didn't even talk about the protests outside.
8937980	8943460	But I was actually surprised that a respectable number of people showed up.
8943460	8951020	It wasn't like massive protests, but there was like 30, 40 people that showed up and they were chanting and they had signs and they were giving out.
8951060	8952420	I thought this was very smart.
8952620	8956740	They were giving out free T-shirts for people to wear inside.
8956860	8965900	So that way, when they showed up on the cameras and stuff and they would have the messages on there, I thought that was really an intelligent way to do a peaceful protest.
8966060	8968420	And I think at the end of the day, that is also the most important thing.
8968420	8970300	All the protests was very, very peaceful.
8970460	8978940	We're not hearing about any type of like, you know, unfortunately, we're not hearing the level of the protests we're hearing about in Hong Kong, just very matter of factly.
8979700	8981460	And so that part is really cool.
8981460	8985500	And I am not one to judge anybody on how they want to spend their money and so forth.
8985500	8989500	But I'm just saying, this is why Blizzard and I are getting a divorce for now.
8989500	8993300	But maybe in six months, we'll get back together.
8993300	8996020	Oh, I didn't fully address the part of the email, the Blitzchung thing.
8997020	9012700	And I kind of said this on the last episode, so I'm sorry if I'm repeating myself, but I feel like a more appropriate punishment would have been suspended for one or two games and just have him not be able to do on camera interviews for six months.
9012700	9015940	If that had been the ban, I would have totally understood it.
9016420	9027820	But one more thing I'm going to say, look at what a company like Wizards of the Coast, who by the way, also is distributed by Tencent in China, has handled a very similar issue recently.
9029060	9033700	Wizards of the Coast had a player that won that made a very similar statement in his winning thing.
9033700	9035340	And you know what Wizards of the Coast did about it?
9035540	9036060	Nothing.
9036740	9039140	And they also have the Tencent presence in China.
9039540	9052660	So it's just but maybe, but one could argue it's because of what's happened at Blizzard has caused this conversation and other companies to look at it and in, in fact, has had a positive change in that regard.
9052860	9057300	So anyway, I will shut up now and not double back on this topic too much.
9057460	9060460	But I just want to get that out and give a respectful response to the email.
9060460	9063100	I'm not trying to be to be bitchy about it right now.
9063100	9070780	I'm, it's just that I, I think people are trying to pull an argument that has nothing to do with it.
9071260	9075820	So that's, um, anyway, I do want to also mention this because this is geo 100.
9075820	9078460	Matt says there was some positive Hearthstone news from Blizzcon.
9078460	9079620	And I did hear about this.
9079620	9080500	This is really cool.
9080780	9084020	Uh, Leooon, I hope I said the name right.
9084020	9091580	I'm sorry if I butchered that, has become the first woman to win a Blizzcon title because she won the, um, uh, Hearthstone championship.
9091900	9092300	Oh, good.
9092300	9093180	Congratulations.
9093300	9093980	Mazel tov.
9094060	9094540	That's right.
9095420	9095940	Next email.
9095940	9096660	Break the ceiling.
9097700	9097900	Yep.
9097900	9098340	Next email.
9098700	9099660	Hey, OLR.
9099700	9103900	I had read so many glowing reviews of Link's Awakening that I decided to pick it up on lunch day.
9104100	9106940	I may be in the minority, but the game hasn't lived up to the hype for me.
9107340	9108740	It's certainly a faithful remake.
9108740	9119460	If anything, Nintendo stuck too closely to the original, by the way, Nintendo didn't do it, um, keeping its dated gameplay intact and having to constantly consult guides to find the next dungeon or even the next key.
9119900	9127820	The, um, items are so far fairly rubbish and the NPCs feel like random cardboard cut out, stabled together from different games.
9128340	9133180	What is new are the toy box style graphics, which are beautiful until they begin to move.
9133580	9136100	When outdoors, the frame rate drops to a distracting level.
9136100	9142140	And I say that as someone who doesn't normally even pay attention to technical details like that, I didn't notice any frame rate issues.
9142540	9142860	Did you?
9143300	9149420	I've noticed some stuttering, like it's not major, but it's enough to go, Oh, that was a, that was a rough transition.
9149740	9150540	Yeah, weird.
9150980	9155020	Um, I vaguely remember playing Link's Awakening DX on Game Boy Color back in the day.
9155380	9162540	I'm sure it was good compared to your average Game Boy title, but to be a $60 Switch game, I think it needed a little modernization.
9162780	9163740	What do you think of the game?
9163740	9165060	Am I being overly harsh?
9165060	9167260	Forever a loyal listener, Elliot B.
9167980	9171620	Um, everyone's opinion is their own opinion.
9172180	9174820	If that's how you felt about it, that's how you felt about it.
9175300	9179220	Um, you know, for, for us, we were pretty excited about it.
9179260	9180420	We wanted the nostalgia.
9180420	9184140	And I think a lot of that money that you're paying for it is for nostalgia.
9184700	9187420	Um, the dungeon maker thing is pretty fun.
9187820	9196060	Um, you know, Dan and I just like went around looking for Easter eggs and try, he, we did the whole thing from memory.
9196780	9198180	No guides at all.
9198660	9202980	We didn't do any guide until like doing the hero playthrough.
9203020	9206780	So, I mean, that's the fun of those old style games.
9206780	9208420	Like that is the exploration.
9208420	9218580	We didn't have guides yonder and when that was the fun of it is that it brought back that sense of how much this do we remember?
9218580	9220660	Is it really the old friend that we knew?
9220980	9226180	And, you know, I think that that's where the game was really banking on is that nostalgia factor.
9226180	9233380	And if you didn't have the nostalgia for the original game that the other, that other people do, then it's definitely going to color your experience with it.
9233580	9233860	Yeah.
9234380	9238540	Honestly, bottom line, dude, you're, you're allowed to like, and not like whatever you want.
9238540	9241260	And it doesn't mean like, you're allowed to be wrong once in a while.
9241260	9242260	No, I'm just, I'm totally kidding.
9242460	9244900	Like, you know, it doesn't, it doesn't mean that you're wrong.
9244940	9246660	Uh, you know, that's what opinions are.
9246660	9255700	And you know, like, I know I've seen that movie that like everybody loved and I was just like, what, why, why does everybody love this movie?
9255900	9257500	I'm going to give you a good example.
9257820	9259060	Uh, I love Xanadu.
9259100	9261140	I feel like I'm, everyone else is wrong.
9261180	9261380	Okay.
9261380	9263500	I feel like I'm expected to love this movie.
9263540	9269700	But when I saw Call Me By Your Name, I was like, it's not like, it took, it was slow.
9270100	9271220	I didn't, it's very artsy.
9271260	9274340	I didn't really like it until the dad's speech at the end.
9274340	9277420	I'm not going to say anything about that, but I was like, that was the best part of the whole movie.
9277420	9278540	And that was only like two minutes of it.
9278780	9281620	You know, there's always going to be, it's art.
9281620	9283300	Art is subject to interpretation, right?
9283300	9284860	And sometimes your interpretation is going to be different.
9285260	9287140	To be fair, it's different when you're seeing it with Shane.
9289500	9293140	He has a way of influencing, but, um, well, I'm sure there's plenty of video games.
9293220	9294220	Is there a video game?
9294220	9295420	And I opened this up to you guys in chat too.
9295420	9300220	Is there a video game that everybody loved, but then you played it and you were like, I don't get it.
9300260	9303380	Like, why does everybody like, I don't really like bionic commando that much.
9304060	9304740	The original.
9304780	9305100	Yeah.
9305820	9306460	Oh, girl.
9306500	9307020	Okay.
9307060	9307460	All right.
9307460	9308020	We all had a pain.
9308020	9309580	I didn't like Metroid when I first played it.
9311300	9312260	I'm just being honest.
9312260	9312660	I didn't care.
9314060	9315460	I didn't like it when I first played it.
9315500	9316900	No, I liked it better.
9316900	9321900	Now as an adult, I actually didn't like Metroid until I played through the guardian legend.
9322540	9323940	It's also interesting to point out.
9323940	9328980	And I would be curious, Elliot, if this ends up being your experience too, and not that you're obligated to go back and play it again, but you might.
9329140	9334620	But like, I know that like one game I played and I didn't get it at first and I didn't go back and play it till like five years later.
9334620	9335580	And then I loved it.
9335780	9336500	Mass Effect.
9337340	9339620	The first time I played Mass Effect, I was like, I don't get it.
9339620	9340500	Why do people love this?
9340540	9341020	Here's the thing.
9341060	9343420	I didn't actually like Link's Awakening the first time I played it.
9344060	9345700	I didn't think it was very fun.
9346420	9347820	I like it now as an adult.
9348060	9351900	I thought it was a much more solid game now that I can come into it as a mature gamer.
9351940	9352140	Yeah.
9352980	9358140	You know, but like there's people who'd be like, I don't like Link to the past.
9358180	9359500	I mean, some people are like that.
9359500	9362820	Dan doesn't care for Link to the past that, you know, everyone else loves it.
9363100	9364420	And it's not that he doesn't like it.
9364420	9366060	It's just, it's not up there, you know?
9366980	9369780	But, um, I mean, what about you, Matt?
9370460	9371660	Uh, Mass Effect.
9372860	9374140	I didn't really like that game.
9375740	9377020	And that's what Bobby says in chat.
9377060	9378300	Mass Effect and Super Metroid.
9378300	9380500	I was, is he trolling with the Super Metroid answer?
9380500	9383260	Cause I don't think Bobby, I never knew Bobby to hate Super Metroid.
9383260	9388100	He just likes, he just likes to bring up the whole stupid Chrono Trigger versus Super Metroid debate.
9388420	9389620	Every possible opportunity.
9389820	9393620	Uh, Shane is still in chat saying, I hated Mass Effect and Dragon Age at first.
9393820	9395180	Even Shane hated Mass Effect.
9395220	9397860	I didn't like the first Dragon Age, but Dragon Age 2 I loved.
9398140	9404020	I, I'm still not as into Dragon Age as the rest of you, but I did, I did enjoy Inquisition.
9404020	9407860	I did enjoy Inquisition what, but I never really like played through the whole entire thing.
9408140	9409100	And that's Splatoon.
9409700	9413500	I honestly think I like Mass Effect 3 better than 2.
9414900	9417740	Because Garris, even more Garris.
9417820	9419180	I'm trying to think of a game.
9419180	9427540	I know there has to be something, but I'm trying to think of something where I was really like, I don't understand why you people obsess over this game.
9429100	9430660	I have to chew on that for a little bit.
9430660	9432020	I know there's gotta be an example.
9432060	9435980	So it was like, I can think of so many movies, but I can't think of games as these.
9435980	9439100	I'm trying to think of games that have won like game of the year type of accolades.
9439460	9440580	Alan, you're giving me a look.
9441780	9442500	Dark soul.
9442500	9443060	Okay.
9443060	9443780	Dark souls.
9445540	9445940	I didn't.
9446060	9446460	Okay.
9446460	9449260	I didn't hate dark souls, but dark souls isn't for me.
9450100	9454380	All the jokes from earlier this evening aside, I guess, I guess that could be an example.
9454380	9457460	There's movies that a lot of people I know, like that I can't stand.
9457460	9458860	Like I won't watch face off.
9459380	9463420	I think because it was really actually very triggering right at the beginning of it.
9464060	9469820	Oh, um, I, I do not care for the way everybody loves fire emblem and those games.
9469820	9471260	I don't like, I don't care for those games.
9471340	9474380	Um, not for me, never liked real time strategy like that.
9474420	9474740	Yeah.
9474740	9479980	It's like the only types of like tactical games I could really get into is, um, uh, final fantasy tactics.
9480260	9481780	I don't even like final fantasy tactics.
9482100	9482380	Hmm.
9483100	9485060	I've never liked those games like that.
9485140	9488940	I mean, and even like Disgaea would be another one.
9489020	9494940	I mean, I had my hands on the Macross game for PC engine for a while and I didn't like it.
9494980	9497180	I really wanted to, cause it was fucking Macross.
9497700	9498580	I thought of the game.
9498580	9499380	I thought of the game.
9500740	9501180	Persona.
9502420	9502940	I haven't played it.
9502940	9503380	I'm sorry.
9503420	9504540	I'm sorry guys.
9504620	9505780	That there it is.
9505820	9506540	That's the game.
9507020	9509980	I, I can't get into it the way the rest of you can.
9510380	9510940	I'm sorry.
9510980	9511620	I've tried.
9511620	9512420	I need to play though.
9512940	9513740	Danganronpa.
9515740	9516380	Maybe.
9516660	9518740	I don't know if, I don't know if it's for me, but we'll see.
9518740	9521420	I wasn't super into Danganronpa at first either, but I really like it now.
9521940	9522340	All right.
9522580	9523700	So there you go, Elliot.
9523700	9525380	See, we've made confessions about the games.
9525380	9527380	We, we don't understand either.
9527380	9529700	So it happens anyway, but thank you for the email.
9529700	9530820	Sports games, all of them.
9532380	9533140	Except tech mobile.
9533540	9536300	Um, or actually super high impact for Super Nintendo.
9537940	9538940	This is the last email.
9539340	9540780	Um, Haya OLR crew.
9540780	9543060	This is your friendly neighborhood Mexican act theft.
9543580	9547060	My last call to the show was to talk about colossal event for Pokemon go.
9547420	9549820	I mentioned my expectations and worries about the event.
9549820	9552260	Now it has happened and I participated in it.
9552300	9554180	I'll talk about my impressions of the event.
9554740	9555780	The event itself was good.
9555820	9558180	It was fun doing the special research to get the.
9558980	9562380	Reggie Gigas along with some of my friends.
9562660	9565980	We had a great time overall and it was, my eyes are blurry.
9566220	9568020	It wasn't overly difficult to finish.
9568340	9572500	We were done after two to three hours tops and continued to raid and do some
9572540	9574780	researches for special Pokemon.
9575220	9577340	Even those who were pretty easy to do.
9577340	9580260	And again, no, even those were pretty easy to do.
9580260	9583300	And again, the Pokemon that were given through those were pretty cool.
9583300	9584700	I even got a shiny Skarmory.
9585380	9589180	Um, after I finished the event, I felt unsatisfied again.
9589180	9592660	It was pretty short and simple, but it was overly simple to do.
9592660	9595340	Just catch an evolve, rinse and repeat three times and you were done.
9595340	9598020	Basically the Pokemon spawning through the event.
9598020	9598580	Well, good.
9598580	9600420	Wasn't the best or most varied.
9600740	9604180	I would love to see more rare Pokemon spawn and get more shinies and really
9604180	9605820	good ones for raids or PVP.
9606500	9607540	I haven't done PVP yet.
9608500	9613620	Many people are complaining about the shiny rates, but I don't think that
9613620	9614540	should be the case here.
9614820	9616660	Shinies are supposed to be rare.
9617420	9620700	And then again, the lack of variety on the spawns really made it kind of dull
9620700	9624740	to do even to even do the special research.
9625020	9628260	Since again, it was composed of really simple and mundane tasks.
9628820	9631260	The raid, the raids were perfect though.
9631260	9632180	Not really difficult.
9632220	9636220	They could be taken down by a small group of three people with good or excellent
9636220	9639460	counters and they appeared everywhere quite often.
9640540	9645420	Like really, I think I did like three raids in the same gym during
9645420	9646860	the time I spent on the event.
9647820	9649460	The rewards were great.
9649460	9654180	Getting rare evolution stones, like the new Unova stone and getting the quote
9654180	9657380	free raid passes for the duration of the event was good.
9657700	9661420	I think the money I paid for all of this wasn't worth it.
9661700	9667340	We also got a post for Avatar, which is really bad, even though I'm using it
9667340	9668980	right now, but it seriously doesn't look okay.
9669420	9671900	And the medal is just for showing off.
9671980	9676660	I would prefer to have a Safari zone or go fast one, which had some merit to it.
9677380	9681260	Overall, I don't regret buying the special ticket and participating in this event.
9681660	9682420	I had fun.
9682420	9686020	I had, and I had a really good time, but what I got was really.
9686420	9689740	But what I got wasn't really worth the price of admission.
9690260	9694260	I would have been okay paying $5 for this, but $8 seemed the wrong price.
9694260	9698580	And yeah, it's $3 only, but I could have used it to buy other stuff in game that
9698580	9700340	is worthwhile or for other games too.
9700900	9702380	Well, that's all for me right now.
9702380	9705260	Thanks for reading PS, sorry for sending this kind of late.
9705340	9706660	Deft is come Brown.
9707900	9710260	Thank you for the email and for the recap of the event, because
9710260	9711340	admittedly I didn't do it.
9711340	9712900	So I'm glad to hear that somebody did.
9713220	9716660	Um, I just didn't, I don't know.
9716660	9720500	Like I just didn't want to pay the money, especially cause you got the raid passes.
9720540	9722740	I have like 60 unused raid passes.
9722740	9724740	Cause that's how infrequently I've been rating anymore.
9724740	9728140	In fact, I just realized I just missed that dark cry or whatever
9728140	9729380	that most recent one has been.
9729420	9731980	I, does somebody have an extra cause they need one?
9732340	9734140	Um, cause I didn't raid for it.
9734140	9737180	I've just been really slacking on those rates because I've been a little more
9737180	9740380	like, I've all of a sudden just been more like into Ingress lately.
9740380	9742740	Maybe something about the anomaly just kind of made me back into that.
9742780	9744300	And I was playing Harry Potter a little bit.
9744580	9747900	So I try to run my Bluetooth on Pokemon, but the Bluetooth won't
9748460	9751140	like, let me do the raids.
9751180	9755420	So, and I just, when I heard that that, uh, Reggie Gigas or whatever was going
9755420	9759260	to be in the, uh, EX raids anyway, I was just like, I'll, I guess I'll get
9759260	9760620	it eventually or they'll be out there.
9760620	9761580	I just, I don't know.
9761580	9764780	I wasn't super interested in paying eight bucks for what they were offering, but
9764780	9766140	I'm glad to hear about your story.
9766180	9769860	Uh, and kind of the, the pros and cons about it at the end of the day, honestly.
9770340	9773420	Uh, Shane might, uh, surprise you in chat.
9773420	9774740	They're saying I didn't do it either.
9774740	9778420	The lack of special spawns all a go Fest was really the deal breaker for me.
9778700	9779340	Oh fuck.
9779340	9782180	Darkrai can't be traded because it's mythical fucker.
9782980	9784180	Well, I'm fucked.
9784700	9788180	They'll bring it back or it'll be, it'll be in a reward box or something.
9788180	9792060	And I, I refuse to believe that Darkrai is going to be gone forever and they'll
9792060	9792980	bring it back at some point.
9792980	9793700	They always do.
9794100	9795700	So, all right.
9795740	9797060	Anyway, so that's it for emails.
9797660	9798060	Okay.
9798340	9801260	Uh, if you would like to email us in a future episode, please send us an email.
9801260	9804020	Participate at orange lounge, radio.com.
9804140	9806220	And with that, we can stop collecting the gifts.
9806220	9809900	So Bobby, if you wouldn't mind, go ahead and close the gift box there and
9810020	9813020	distribute the freebies there in chat.
9813100	9814260	Uh, appreciate that.
9814660	9818740	Um, And those will go out there shortly in our chat over at Twitch TV slash vog
9818740	9819140	network.
9819300	9820740	Sorry to the podcast folk.
9820740	9823540	We don't have any way to let you guys participate in that as well.
9823540	9826700	It's just one of the little perks for being able to be here live on, whoa, a
9826700	9827860	whole bunch of stuff just went out there.
9828300	9830620	Be here, be here live on a Sunday night.
9830620	9834780	I feel like everybody that doesn't have Twitch prime ended up getting one of
9834780	9835460	those rewards.
9835460	9836060	Well, there you go.
9836060	9836940	Congrats, you guys.
9836940	9837260	Thanks.
9837460	9840700	And thank you to our very generous community for, uh, distributing all those
9840700	9841140	gifts.
9841300	9842420	Super appreciate it.
9842740	9844140	All right, let's move on.
9844140	9845260	We have some more news for you guys.
9845260	9848140	I'm actually going to ask us to try to maybe take this a little bit more in
9848140	9849180	turbo mode here.
9849380	9850780	Those were coming up on nine o'clock.
9850780	9851900	We've had a long show tonight.
9852060	9854940	I want to make sure we have time to get some calls in and I have to take dark
9854940	9856460	soccer home tonight cause she's on meds.
9856460	9857940	So it's going to be a long night for me.
9857980	9859620	So there better be tacos on the way home.
9859620	9861260	Let's that can be arranged.
9861260	9862220	Let's go to turbo mode.
9862620	9863100	All right.
9863100	9868100	So EA has been putting their own games on origin for the longest time.
9868100	9870460	Well now they're coming back to steam.
9870780	9875860	So starting November 15th with the release of star Wars, Jedi fallen order,
9875900	9878860	they will be releasing games on steam as well.
9879260	9883700	And also they're going to be allowing the EA access subscription service to
9883700	9886300	be purchased on steam as well.
9886700	9891660	And going forward, their other games will be, um, put on to steam.
9892580	9893860	So that's pretty cool.
9893940	9897980	And they, according to their official announcement, um, they're going to have
9897980	9900740	some older EA releases come back as well.
9900740	9906660	The Sims four unravel to apex legends and battlefield five with crossplay
9906660	9909380	between steam and origin as well.
9910180	9911700	So cool.
9912500	9916260	Do you think this is a sign EA is going to let origin kind of go or what do you
9916300	9919220	think, or is this, I don't know, actually that wasn't really the first initial
9919220	9919980	thought I got from this.
9919980	9924700	My first initial thought was, Oh, this is a move against Epic because Epic has
9924700	9927660	really been trying to like get the more and more exclusives and so forth.
9927660	9933420	So maybe, uh, EA and like EA and steam have this whole, the enemy of my enemy
9933420	9936100	is my friend type of thing going on.
9936100	9937260	Does that make sense?
9937580	9939300	So it's just business, right?
9939300	9940060	Yeah, maybe.
9940140	9942540	And Ubisoft left steam to go to Epic.
9942540	9944180	So, you know, it makes sense.
9944260	9944980	Makes sense.
9945020	9947940	So interesting, interesting how this is all shaking out there.
9948220	9951620	Um, but how many of these storefronts are we really going to want
9951620	9952620	to install on our computer?
9953180	9956980	Like, I'm not really that concerned by additional storefronts, honestly,
9956980	9962180	like even like the Epic store, eh, whatever, it's just a launcher.
9962180	9966220	I have, you know, I don't necessarily keep them launched all the time.
9966220	9970220	If I want to play a game that I don't have that many games on the Epic
9970220	9973380	storefront and the ones I do like have purchased there, I think I've
9973380	9974500	purchased like three games.
9974860	9978060	Most of the other ones are just free, which I probably have on
9978060	9979860	steam anyways, or other consoles.
9980300	9981900	Um, I don't know.
9981900	9983140	I just, who cares?
9983140	9984900	It's just launching another fucking thing.
9985380	9987180	It really doesn't matter at this point.
9987660	9988020	All right.
9988620	9991300	Uh, let's talk a little bit about, uh, mixer.
9991300	9994060	I know it's weird cause we're broadcasting on Twitch, but, and we're
9994060	9996580	going to talk about mixer, which am I even allowed to do that?
9996580	9997100	Of course I am.
9997100	10000220	It's I'm allowed to talk a little bit about the competition because
10000220	10001460	competition is healthy.
10001460	10002380	I think it's a good thing.
10002540	10005460	And, uh, you know, where one company goes, the other might follow.
10005460	10007420	And you know, I think it's all, it's all a good thing.
10007420	10009500	It's all about the streaming world at the end of the day.
10009700	10012180	And besides, there's a lot of people that listen to this show on the podcast
10012180	10015580	feed and don't use either Twitch or mixer, but I think it is worth
10015580	10020420	noting that this week mixer has dropped their subscription price down to $4.99.
10020660	10023740	This is notable because they were charging $5.99.
10023740	10028300	That is more than a Twitch subscription, but $4.99 is now at the
10028300	10030180	same place as a Twitch subscription.
10030420	10034060	It's now a Twitch and a mixer subscription will cost you the same thing.
10034380	10038660	Perhaps this is because the recent move of some big notable streamers
10038660	10040340	over to mixer, I don't know.
10040580	10044780	Uh, maybe when Ninja went over from Twitch to mixer, perhaps it was one of
10044780	10047740	those things where, Hey, his followers are gonna have to pay more money to
10047740	10049140	subscribe to him over on mixer.
10049140	10050500	Well, they're not going to have to do that anymore.
10050500	10054580	So mixer took care of that this week by dropping the price down from a dollar.
10054860	10058180	Uh, and you get, I guess, special, I don't, I have to admit, since I do
10058180	10061220	pretty much exclusively use Twitch myself once in a while, I peek at the
10061220	10064500	mixer stuff, especially because like in the X-Box app, it's embedded in
10064500	10065380	there because it's a Microsoft thing.
10065380	10065660	Right?
10065820	10069340	So like when I go to play, uh, something like bloodstained, it'll be like, here
10069340	10073340	are the people streaming bloodstained on mixer right now, which I really
10073340	10078060	wish I hope we see like a Sony and Twitch partnership thing, maybe going
10078060	10079100	into the next generation of games.
10079300	10082780	Cause I know you kind of get that a little bit on Sony now, but it only
10082780	10086020	shows you the people streaming natively through the console.
10086260	10087820	So I hope maybe, I don't know.
10087820	10089140	We'll see, we'll see what develops.
10089140	10092980	But anyway, uh, so yeah, uh, that's, uh, pretty cool that they have
10092980	10096340	dropped, uh, the, um, subscription down.
10096660	10100060	Um, I don't know what the split is over there.
10100060	10102540	Do their people get half like Twitch does?
10102620	10103060	I don't know.
10103060	10103860	I don't know either.
10104100	10106900	Uh, it should also be noted mixer doesn't have the whole, uh, Amazon
10106900	10108740	prime thing coming into play either.
10109020	10113060	Uh, so there's no like freebie chances, by the way, if you are rocking your
10113060	10116820	Amazon prime account and, uh, or your Twitch prime or new, what have you, and
10116820	10120220	you haven't yet used your free subscription, consider using it here at
10120220	10121580	the voice geeks network, VOG network.
10121860	10125420	Uh, using it here, we'll open up the video archive and you can watch, uh, all
10125420	10130700	your, uh, episodes of, uh, OLR and Bobby Black Wolf and, uh, the few here and
10130700	10134380	there specials that we've done over the past year, you can watch all that on video.
10134380	10137100	So, um, yeah, there you go.
10137100	10140540	Mixer, uh, drop in there to be a little more competitive, especially with some of
10140540	10143060	the big name streamers that have left recently dark soccer.
10143060	10143700	What do you have for us?
10144100	10145060	Just some stuff.
10145540	10148180	Um, and I also do have bonus news as well.
10148700	10154500	So, um, women in France have, uh, organized, uh, basically in France, about
10154500	10155940	half of all gamers are women.
10156500	10161620	And so, um, you know, being that they are completely, uh, underrepresented,
10161900	10167260	uh, underrepresented though, for the 10th, uh, edition of the Paris games week fair,
10167460	10171660	which, um, is actually just ended today, the organization women in
10171660	10173420	games had a dedicated soul there.
10173900	10177900	Um, it was created in 20, not the stall, but the group was created in 2017.
10177900	10182500	It has 1600 members and it promotes involvement of all genders
10182500	10183780	in the video game community.
10184900	10189300	Um, and then did I have another thing?
10189820	10192180	Yeah, that was my story.
10192660	10194020	You said you had a bonus thing as well.
10194020	10194740	A bonus thing.
10195060	10198020	Um, they, they apparently did start, um, nevermind.
10198020	10199340	This is an old article, so nevermind.
10199620	10199980	Okay.
10199980	10205500	Um, uh, what, what do you think is going to be like the long-term effect
10205500	10207100	of this organization in France?
10207500	10212100	Uh, hopefully, you know, we'll see some serious strides because I mean, the
10212100	10220140	moment, anytime an organization composed mostly of women and croaches on male
10220140	10222660	territory, Oh shit, people get in arms.
10223260	10227900	And I really want to see the, the binary broken number one.
10228140	10230100	And I want to see those walls broken down.
10230100	10236220	I'd like for people to stop mattering what someone has between their legs or,
10236300	10240180	you know, how their bodies are built and say, Hey, this is a gamer and
10240180	10241420	they have something to contribute.
10242580	10243540	That's the goal.
10243540	10246860	Just one minor thing that, cause I don't want the email coming in on it.
10246860	10248460	Gender is not always about what's between your legs.
10248500	10249260	That's what I said.
10249260	10249900	Oh, just making sure.
10249900	10250220	Oh, sorry.
10250220	10251580	I'm I'm misinterpreted what you said.
10251820	10252020	Okay.
10252060	10255900	Well, because I mean, I, I, I phrased it exactly like that because
10255900	10257660	that's not what gender is.
10258220	10260700	You know, but people focus on that bullshit.
10260740	10261140	Got it.
10261300	10261660	Got it.
10261660	10262540	So whatever.
10263020	10264580	Um, this is me.
10264900	10265260	I know.
10265260	10265660	I know.
10265660	10266860	That's why I was like, wait a minute.
10266860	10268580	I think she wanted to phrase that in a different way, but that's okay.
10269060	10274060	Um, I wanted to point out though, um, that I, well, I don't know.
10274060	10275860	Cause maybe it's just from my perspective.
10275860	10276580	I am a dude.
10276780	10280420	So, you know, I don't have the same perspective, but I do feel like, like
10280460	10285260	it's getting better than it was even just like three years ago, but I think
10285260	10289780	it's because more people are speaking up about like, yo, this is fucked up.
10290100	10293100	And like, you know, that we're starting to see more things like, Oh yay.
10293100	10296940	We just had, you know, a woman, you know, break or break the streak
10296940	10299380	and, and win the Hearthstone championship.
10299380	10303380	And we're seeing, uh, I think more like men and women diversity
10303380	10304740	in games and things like that.
10304740	10307540	I don't know, but I, my perspective is not the one to hear.
10307580	10308260	What do you think?
10308620	10310860	Well, I actually, do you think we're going the right way?
10311860	10314500	We have to take, gain ground when, when we can.
10314500	10318220	And I do think that there are some steps being made in the right direction,
10318220	10322420	but I would like to also point out, and it's maybe about a year ago, um, one
10322420	10325940	of my favorite podcasts, Stuff Mom Never Told You did a series about women in
10325940	10331380	video games and basically what it's like to be a woman gamer from the perspective
10331380	10333100	of a gamer and from statistics.
10333140	10339180	And it really is a very, very good breakdown on just what we experience,
10339660	10341300	you know, down to the numbers.
10341340	10343660	The thing that I like is that it had the numbers in it.
10344180	10349500	And it's really, I mean, it's really the only way that, like, for example,
10349500	10352220	if you're a gamer, the only way to really be safe is to conceal your,
10352300	10356700	your gender or to pick something gender neutral and you still get fucking ratted
10356700	10360700	on, you know, people still try to give you shit for it, you know, or being
10360700	10364500	a voice in the community, you know, they're like, oh, well, well, you're
10364500	10367420	just saying this because you're, you're a woman or, you know, your opinion
10367420	10369580	doesn't matter or go back to the kitchen or whatever the fuck.
10369580	10371380	It's still fucking happens.
10371380	10374060	And as long as it fucking happens, we have not done enough.
10374380	10374980	That's true.
10374980	10378500	And it's still, you know, the, the thing I can come comment on being a gay
10378500	10382300	dude is that, you know, we still hear like anti-gay slurs and stuff and
10382300	10384060	happen and you know, that whole thing.
10384340	10387300	I do like to think it's getting better, but you're right.
10387300	10392700	Imagine what it would be like to be a lesbian of color.
10393500	10394020	Oh, sure.
10394860	10399220	You know, I've, I've got friends who have just been absolutely devastated
10399220	10403220	by the language that they've received in playing games and trying to be
10403220	10408660	outspoken out there on, you know, this rather treacherous water that is,
10408660	10411660	you know, the internet cesspool, really.
10411820	10417180	But it does feel like for what it's worth it, at least now we have more
10417220	10422260	games with more representation in them, probably because games are easier
10422260	10426220	to make and so games, like not everybody could just sit down and
10426220	10428500	plunk out an Atari 2,600 game, for example.
10428500	10431900	And obviously I'm using extreme example here, but now more people are
10431900	10433300	kind of like able to tell stories.
10433300	10434740	And I think that like helps.
10434780	10438700	I don't necessarily want to, you know, do the big comparison with the civil
10438700	10440380	rights movement or anything like that.
10440660	10443860	But there is a, it was just a little meme that kind of reminded me of this
10443860	10449620	fact that major changes in government and in society haven't happened until
10450020	10454180	it was made a big inconvenience for the dominant party.
10454580	10458340	We didn't get ADA until people surrounded the White House with wheelchairs.
10458380	10464020	You know, it took a march to Washington and, you know, big fights for school
10464020	10467700	integration, the whole civil rights movement to give people of color
10467900	10469620	closer to an equal standing.
10469620	10470260	They don't have it yet.
10470660	10473500	It's what's happening, but it's not there yet.
10473540	10474820	We still have a lot of work to do.
10474820	10478580	You know, women got the votes because we were jailed.
10478580	10482620	We went on hunger strikes, force fed, you know, things that, oh, well, you
10482620	10483460	just see Susan B.
10483460	10484820	Anthony and whatever the fuck.
10484820	10489900	But people don't know those stories about women who were force fed raw eggs
10489900	10494820	through a tube because they dared stand up for suffrage, you know?
10494820	10496860	And you're dealing with all of this worldwide.
10496860	10500420	You're dealing, well, I mean, I hate Gandhi because he was pretty racist,
10500420	10506180	he was pretty racist, but I mean, he would walk, you know, walk works of protest,
10506380	10510420	you know, and the thing is, is that any kind of injustice like this has
10510420	10512620	to be fought without rest.
10513580	10516940	And if one person falters, someone else has to step up.
10517220	10521820	And that's why I say all of us, you know, no matter what your gender is, you
10521820	10525620	need to stand up and look out for the other oppressed groups because you
10525620	10527020	could fucking be next.
10528180	10529020	And I'm done.
10529180	10530180	No, you're fine.
10530380	10531260	It needed reset.
10531260	10535460	I mean, so much for turbo mode, but important topic, but a topic we could
10535460	10537580	do a whole three hour show on anyway.
10537580	10540740	But we got to move on just for time's sake, since we're after 9 p.m.
10540740	10543020	And we still have some more stories to get to, including what Loki
10543020	10543820	is going to talk about next.
10544180	10544580	Yes.
10544580	10548860	And so we had talked about Xbox all access a while back, that whole plan
10548860	10556860	where you could basically get an Xbox, uh, one or Xbox one X, um, game pass
10556900	10561260	and Xbox live discounted over the course of, uh, two years.
10561260	10563020	So you have monthly payments that you pay.
10563340	10568740	Well, it's coming back as of November 18th and it's available through, um,
10568900	10571940	different partners, depending on where you're purchasing it from.
10571940	10578100	I want to say North America is in, uh, Amazon, amazon.com.
10578180	10581460	Um, UK would be game or Smith's toys.
10581940	10587260	And in Australia, they have that online at Telstra or I think
10587300	10588620	in their Microsoft stores.
10589020	10595740	So, um, the way it works, it could be as little as $19.99 per month for 24 months.
10596100	10599220	They are also along with the program.
10600380	10606780	Um, you have the opportunity to upgrade to the next, uh, uh, project scarlet
10606780	10611740	when it's available in the holiday 2020, although not for the Xbox one X version,
10611740	10616100	which is weird, but they don't offer the upgrade that way.
10616460	10624380	Um, that's curious, but for the other versions, they like the Xbox one S.
10624820	10628860	You can get that, uh, with an upgrade path as well.
10629460	10633660	So, um, yeah, they mentioned Xbox one X would be 30 99 a month.
10633820	10642420	Um, Xbox one S is 22 99, 19 99 would be for the Xbox one S all digital version.
10643740	10646900	So, and no upfront costs and yeah.
10647580	10650500	Yeah, especially, and I've been commenting on the show myself that, you know, game
10650500	10652420	passes is getting stronger and stronger.
10652420	10654780	Like I'm actually enjoying that more myself as a consumer.
10654780	10658500	So this is an interesting, you know, way to kind of jump into this, especially
10658500	10661620	going into the holiday season where it's like, you know, if I could just, you
10661620	10665380	know, buy somebody a year of this or whatever, I guess you're agreeing to it.
10665380	10666220	It's like a contract.
10666220	10667060	I mean, it's not so easy.
10667060	10668020	It is interesting.
10668020	10672380	And I'd want to see more like how the interactivity with the project scarlet
10672380	10677300	stuff and the Xbox one works before I would be like willing to jump into
10677300	10680860	something like this, but it's interesting.
10680860	10686180	And I'm curious to see why the Xbox one X doesn't have an upgrade path on that,
10686180	10689300	but, uh, the other ones do so that's weird.
10690060	10690540	Yeah.
10690540	10691540	So, all right.
10691540	10694380	Well, I'll be curious to see if, uh, it's a successful program.
10694380	10695460	And people, I'm sorry.
10695460	10698060	I especially want to see if they apply this to the next.
10698060	10698660	I'm sorry.
10698660	10700140	They does have an upgrade path.
10700140	10706220	The difference is that it, the Xbox one S you have to have it for 18 months.
10706220	10709260	Whereas the Xbox one X it's for 12 months.
10709260	10710420	I see.
10710420	10711700	All right then.
10711700	10712620	All right.
10712620	10715940	Well, moving on to, uh, one more story for tonight.
10715940	10721980	It has to do with Pac-Man's 40th anniversary and, uh, Pac-Man is, uh,
10721980	10725860	getting some, uh, special new things for the 40th anniversary Namco Bandai
10725860	10727220	trying to go all out a little bit.
10727220	10730260	I'm hoping that means we're going to see some games in the next year.
10730260	10734300	But, um, the early thing we have at least is we have a song called
10734300	10739740	join the pack by Ken Ishii, who I think is a famous DJ over in Japan.
10739740	10744260	Uh, there's actually a music video out there for join the pack, uh, by a
10744260	10749740	famous director, Yuichi Kodama, uh, who won wards at con in 2008, uh,
10749740	10751420	the international film festival.
10751420	10755700	Uh, he also did the, uh, flag handover ceremony at the Rio Olympics, 2016.
10755700	10757180	So some big names behind this.
10757180	10759060	Now, sadly, you would think it's a video show.
10759060	10762180	I would show you the video, but I do have to have concern about
10762180	10763260	getting muted here.
10763260	10765660	So I can't really play the song cause it is copyright song.
10765660	10767780	However, if you want to check that out, I listened to it.
10767780	10768740	It's okay.
10768740	10770900	It's it's no Pac-Man fever.
10770900	10772860	But maybe I'm just showing my age there.
10772860	10774460	Uh, anyway, you can check that out.
10774460	10776940	Uh, the, uh, join the pack is the official theme song there.
10776940	10779740	I'm hoping this leads into some game announcements.
10779740	10783060	Cause I don't think that, wow, we made a Pac-Man song.
10783060	10785740	I mean, even though they got some talented names behind it, I don't think
10785740	10788740	that's really a great anniversary thing, but maybe if it's like, Hey,
10788740	10791620	we're going to put out like a mega Pac-Man collection, or we're going to
10791620	10796140	put out like a lost Pac-Man thing, or, uh, we're going to let arcade one
10796140	10799620	up, make a baby Pac-Man table, how they're going to do.
10799620	10802620	We're going to make a Pac-Man live action movie.
10802860	10805380	How they're going to do it because they've never done a pinball table before.
10805380	10808380	I don't know, but this is, this is the time to learn how they're going to start.
10808740	10811660	Uh, but we'll, we'll see what else comes out of their 40th anniversary,
10811820	10813340	but I was still kind of like, wow.
10813340	10817020	Is it really like, oh my God, why don't they make like arcade one
10817020	10820460	up pinball tables, like miniaturized version of pinball tables, dude,
10820460	10824980	wait, like if these mini machines are as popular as they're like, like bit
10824980	10827900	like they, I feel like the mini arcade one up machines, like there's more
10827900	10830340	and more of them and they're getting some bigger and bigger franchises,
10830340	10833940	like the Ninja Turtles thing, the star Wars thing, which, um, shout out,
10833940	10837100	if you haven't seen Bobby Blackwell's video, he put that up at, uh, on the
10837100	10839700	VOG network, YouTube, which we don't talk about a lot because we don't use
10839700	10843620	it a lot, but Bobby put a great little clip from his show up there, uh, with
10843620	10846700	him, like building the arcade one up star Wars thing.
10846700	10849380	So if you haven't seen what these machines look, look like, check it out
10849380	10851100	over on our YouTube channel at VOG network.
10851380	10853860	Um, but these are kid one ups are getting bigger and bigger names.
10853900	10855100	Didn't they get a gauntlet one?
10855380	10855860	Nothing like that.
10855860	10857060	No, I make that up.
10857180	10858180	I think you made that up.
10858220	10858780	I made that up.
10858780	10859980	Cause I want one, my bad.
10860180	10865020	Um, but, uh, that would be really cool, but I, the mortal combat one, I kind of
10865020	10869060	want to get cause I love the old mortal combat games, so, but it's just, you
10869060	10873980	know, again, I need less shit in this house, not more, so the eternal struggle.
10875740	10876140	All right.
10876140	10877940	Anyway, uh, there you go.
10877940	10880340	So that is, uh, Pac-Man's 40th anniversary.
10880620	10882900	Uh, let's, let's open up the listener round table.
10882900	10885780	You guys, uh, we're going to go to our discord and if you want to give us a
10885780	10890420	call, you can join the green room over in our discord over at vog network.com
10890420	10893980	slash discord, and we're going to get to some calls here on air.
10893980	10896100	I'm probably not gonna be able to take a lot of calls tonight just because
10896100	10898740	we're already running a little late, but that's what happens when you take
10898740	10901780	so much time off and then Blizzcon happens the same week that you come back.
10902340	10903260	You feeling okay over there?
10903340	10903740	Yeah.
10903740	10908300	Had a little bit of a thing to get, uh, kind of having a great discussion.
10908300	10911660	I mean, I got a little angry for a moment, but, um, talking about the
10911660	10916100	experience of women in gaming, you know, uh, Kaijuna was bringing up
10916100	10920540	having a friend, well, a former friend who was going off on a woman after
10920540	10923300	having been beaten in a game and I'm like, okay, so I'm take that.
10923300	10927380	And imagine this is every experience you have with it directed at you.
10927900	10932980	Every game, maybe not every game, but just about any time you sit and play
10932980	10937500	any kind of multiplayer game, this happens and it's always at you, no
10937500	10940940	matter what you do, how clean of a game, how little shit you talk about
10940940	10943420	people, this is the experience of women in gaming.
10945020	10949780	Um, I do want to point out, um, Bobby Black Wolf is, is, uh, justifying my
10949780	10953780	gauntlet experience saying I did not make that up in fact, there is a
10953780	10959380	rampage cabinet that has rampage joust defender and I have played that one.
10959420	10960860	I forgot that it had gauntlet.
10960940	10964940	So, yeah, but you were, I, I was not, maybe you, maybe your
10964940	10966740	brain went to gauntlet legends.
10966780	10967140	Yes.
10967140	10969460	Unfortunately that is not a thing that they have.
10970140	10972060	If they did that, yeah.
10972100	10972580	Right.
10972620	10972820	Yeah.
10972820	10974660	I would have been very excited to be pretty amazing.
10974740	10975620	That would be pretty amazing.
10975660	10977620	All right, let's get to, um, some calls.
10977780	10980660	So I'm going to try to drop somebody in the on air room and hello.
10980660	10981780	You were on orange launch radio.
10981780	10982300	Who's this?
10983300	10985500	Amy, uh, this is my lovely him.
10985540	10986140	How are you?
10986460	10987460	Hey, I am great.
10987460	10989780	Except I'm just having to adjust the volume on the fly, but don't
10989780	10990220	worry about that.
10990220	10990940	That's on my end.
10990940	10992060	So sorry about the echo guys.
10992060	10992860	What's on your mind tonight?
10992860	10994180	Raging or excuse me, metal mayhem.
10994180	10994660	What's on your mind?
10995900	10999300	Oh, well, I started to bring up, um, unusual.
10999300	11004980	Topic, uh, mainly, uh, hoarding of, uh, digital PC games.
11005060	11012820	Um, as you know, Nowadays, things do humble bundle sale, uh, bundle
11012820	11016820	bundles, uh, steam sales, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
11017740	11025700	It's incredibly easy to build up massive amounts of, uh, PC, uh, games.
11025700	11033220	Um, and, you know, depending on the person, you know, it can be easily,
11033340	11039260	you know, justified as, you know, eventually I'll get around to play X
11039260	11044660	game or Y game, or you never know if a certain game is going to be
11044660	11046980	elicited at some point down the road.
11047020	11053140	Like, uh, you know, Doug Tails remastered was fairly recently.
11053780	11060860	Um, that being said, you know, I, you know, do you think that, you know, the
11060860	11068060	building of these massive libraries of games, uh, can be an issue in a sense?
11068100	11068620	No.
11068660	11074140	I mean, you know, case in point, no, not to sound like a bragging, but with
11074140	11080580	all the games I have through the various services, I get well over 2000 games.
11081340	11086060	Odds are, you know, probably not going to get around to play every single one of
11086060	11094020	those games, especially since a lot of them can be upwards is say 50 hours long.
11094820	11100740	Um, so do you think that it can be like a serious hoarding issue, even
11100740	11105980	though that they don't take a physical room like, uh, cartridges?
11105980	11113500	Um, I mean, hoarding is in some ways kind of a part of human nature.
11113540	11117460	Like I realized that sometimes we associate that word hoarding with like,
11117460	11123460	um, the TV show hoarders when things go to, uh, an extreme of sorts, but I think
11123460	11127220	something about the collection and collectibles that's, there's something I
11127220	11129420	think that's kind of like fused in us with that whole thing.
11129660	11132780	Um, case in point, you know, even though you kind of talk about, oh, we build up
11132820	11136540	this huge library of digital games on Steam, uh, or whatever service, you know,
11136540	11138980	we're using and we, we may or may not ever getting around to play them.
11139220	11139700	You know what?
11139700	11145180	I think of houses I've gone into that have gigantic bookshelves, lots and lots
11145180	11145980	of books.
11146140	11149860	And I think to myself, you probably have never read all of those books.
11149860	11152900	Maybe they have, but I bet there's a lot of books on that shelf that you've never
11152900	11153260	read.
11153460	11156300	Uh, same thing with the people, you know, that you go into their house and they
11156300	11159740	have DVDs that practically wrap around the house.
11159900	11162980	Maybe you're seeing less and less of that because of this digital future we're
11162980	11163420	living in.
11163420	11166580	But I know I went to somebody's house not that long ago who I was meeting, um,
11166620	11170180	kind of like, like a new friend I just met and I was like, dang, you got to like
11170180	11171380	a lot of DVDs.
11171620	11175380	And then I'm thinking, has this person actually watched the DVD or do they buy
11175380	11175940	the DVD?
11175940	11178380	Because maybe they saw the movie in the theater and they just kind of liked it.
11178540	11179140	I mean, I don't know.
11179140	11182020	And I'm not saying like, oh, everybody who has these collections doesn't actually
11182020	11182460	use them.
11182580	11182980	Sure.
11182980	11185980	I bet there are some people that have watched every single DVD that they own.
11186140	11188060	Have you watched every single DVD that you own, Loki?
11188300	11189820	I don't know the main DVDs anymore.
11189820	11190300	Not anymore.
11190300	11190460	Right.
11190460	11191500	And when I did know.
11191540	11195340	Yeah, but have you played every single game in the vault?
11199260	11199700	Okay.
11199820	11200460	See what I mean?
11200780	11202860	So that's funny, Rob.
11202940	11208740	So the digital collection on steam, the digital just makes it easier to do that.
11208740	11212100	And just, there's something about having that impressive collection.
11212100	11215980	Like, oh, remember when it used to be, we have this big binder full of CDs, check
11216020	11218260	out my CD collection or, you know, things like that.
11218260	11221500	Like, it's just like having the collections as part of nature.
11221660	11226380	So I don't think it's like a bad thing to have, like all these games pile up.
11226380	11231780	In fact, I mean, sometimes you get the most random bug to go play a certain game
11231980	11234740	and then you find out, oh, I have that in my collection.
11234740	11238540	And then maybe you get to experience this thing that you might collect dust
11238540	11239300	otherwise.
11239420	11240140	So, I don't know.
11240140	11241140	Those are my thoughts.
11242340	11245900	Did I really address your question, Metal Mayhem, or was there something deeper in
11245940	11246140	that?
11248620	11249940	More or less you did.
11250180	11255980	You know, the thing is, you know, at least when I was strictly a console gamer, you
11255980	11263660	know, up until that close to the end of the PS3 era, you know, a lot of games,
11263980	11267820	you know, especially in physical games, were $60 plus.
11269300	11274180	That being said, I didn't buy every single last game that I came across.
11274700	11281780	Now, ever since you introduced me to PC games, namely Steam, you mentioned Steam
11281780	11282980	sales and all that.
11282980	11287780	Now, I kind of caught the bug, you know, where I was in no estate.
11288060	11291380	Now, this game is going to weigh $20.
11292020	11294300	Now, it's on sale for $2.
11294300	11300500	So Humble Bundle has this bundle, you know, I can get all these games for a dollar.
11301020	11307540	I was like, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, I'll buy two of that, you know, I'll buy
11307980	11313420	whatever, you know, I'll get around to playing these eventually.
11313420	11319460	But, you know, the thing is, you know, it kind of go up and, you know, now I got,
11319460	11322980	like, like I said, quite, you know, quite, you know, collection.
11322980	11328780	And honestly, you know, I probably got more games, you know, more free time than the
11328820	11332340	average person because I'm disabled and don't have a nine-to-five job.
11332820	11335740	But even with that being said, even if I...
11335740	11341300	What you find, despite your limitations, your boundaries in that regard, you've kind
11341300	11345980	of found ways to, in a way, still, like, keep your happiness and keep your level of
11345980	11347900	happiness because you are a gamer.
11347900	11351260	And I know we've talked about this when you first started listening to OLR.
11351260	11355020	I remember some of your concern was, am I going to fit in here because I'm still
11355020	11359260	playing Nintendo 64 games when y'all are talking about PlayStation 2 and 3 type of
11359260	11363300	games? And the answer was an enthusiastic, yes, you still fit in here because you're
11363300	11364340	still a gamer.
11364340	11369860	And I think that's also, you know, you are working with the cards that you have.
11370100	11376060	And in my impression, and I apologize if I'm misstating anything, but my impression
11376060	11381260	is you've kind of made a fun hobby out of deal shopping, you know, and I don't...
11381260	11382580	There's nothing wrong with that.
11382660	11385220	Lord, you ever seen any of those extreme coupon shows?
11386660	11391380	People make hobbies out of finding those good deals, and that's definitely not a bad
11391380	11396140	thing at all. And it allows you to still play a lot of, maybe not games that came out
11396140	11399820	yesterday, but a lot of games that came out within the past couple of years that are
11399820	11404260	still very, very good and worthy of your attention, whether you got it for free or got
11404260	11407220	it on a deep cut for only, like, 99 cents.
11407900	11413340	So, yeah, you know, I'll be the first to admit that because I live on Social Security
11413340	11421420	disability and which doesn't pay me much per month, you know, I can't afford to go buy,
11422620	11425980	you know, expensive games on the regular.
11425980	11431460	But, you know, I kind of honed my ability to find the deals, you know, like you
11431500	11438660	mentioned, you know, I look all over the place, the humble bundle, you know, the sales,
11438660	11446100	you know, read little articles to post, you know, I'll repost the stuff that I find on
11446100	11447500	Steam in the one group.
11450700	11455460	Sorry. So, yeah, I mean, I can't quite adapt to it.
11455460	11460180	So, you know, I mean, if I can find, like, a really good deal and stuff, you know,
11460180	11464900	pouring out to get stuff to all the people, because I know I'm probably not the only
11464900	11468260	person in the world that has to live on a tight budget, you know.
11468820	11470420	Absolutely not.
11470420	11473380	And I think there's other people also on a tight budget.
11473380	11477860	I'm sure you're not alone in that, that appreciate all those tips and those things that
11477860	11479700	you put out there when you find the games.
11479700	11484180	And that's why you have sites like, for example, I'll just shout out Cheap Ass Gamer.
11484180	11486860	I know they've had a podcast that's been around forever, too.
11487500	11490780	And, you know, it's because people love a good deal.
11490780	11496060	And to build up those backlogs, because you never know, someday, maybe it'll be easy to
11496060	11500620	pass along those digital backlogs to somebody else, just like it would be your library book
11500620	11502460	collection or your DVD collection.
11502460	11505100	Anyway, Metal Mayhem, I got to let you go because we're running really long tonight.
11505100	11506060	But thank you so much for your call.
11506060	11506780	I appreciate it, buddy.
11506780	11507280	Okay?
11508380	11509260	Have a good night.
11509260	11509740	Take care.
11509740	11510620	Take care.
11510620	11510860	All right.
11510860	11512780	That was the only call that was waiting on Discord for us.
11512780	11515580	So, I am going to go ahead and close up Discord just because we're running over three hours
11515580	11520220	right now, and I know everybody's about had it, but that's what happens when you've been
11520220	11521500	gone for a few weeks.
11521500	11526140	I will still go over to Loki and ask if there's any last minute stories that you might have.
11526140	11527100	Yes, there is.
11527100	11528380	So, I was going to mention this.
11529180	11536780	One of my favorite independent game companies, Bossa, who did the very famous Surgeon Simulator
11536780	11538220	games in I Am Bread.
11538860	11547420	Well, they have done something kind of in a similar tone as like how we got Goat Simulator
11547420	11549660	with Coffee Stain games.
11549660	11558060	So, they have these prototypes of games that they're developing that you can download for
11558060	11562940	free and try them out and let them know which one you want turned into a real game.
11562940	11572700	So, you can go to bossapresents.com and download either they have Pigeon Simulator, I Am Fish,
11573820	11576700	or Trash Bandits, and they all look great.
11576700	11578460	Oh, Trash Bandits all the way.
11578460	11583420	So, Trash Bandits, you're a fox and you collect trash.
11583420	11586620	I thought it was like actual like little bandits going through the trash.
11586620	11587900	No, no, no, no, no, no.
11587900	11593820	So, Trash Bandits, it's basically your foxes that you're collecting things and throwing
11593820	11597740	in the back of like a garbage truck.
11597740	11602140	So, you're doing that and you're actually like, you know, it looks pretty crazy.
11602140	11604780	I Am Fish, it's similar to I Am Bread.
11604780	11608140	I Am Bread was kind of the game where you control a piece of bread and you try to get
11608140	11609180	to the toaster.
11609180	11614780	In I Am Fish, you're a fish in a fish bowl and you have to roll a fish bowl to get to
11614780	11620220	a water source without breaking the fish bowl and dying because you're a fish.
11620220	11624940	Pigeon Simulator is this ridiculous game where you're pigeon and poop on things and pigeon
11624940	11625420	things.
11625420	11628700	So, all look great, all free.
11628700	11632940	So, go check them out and I'm going to download all of them.
11632940	11634780	Yeah, that's great.
11634780	11635340	I love that.
11635980	11637580	So, that's Trash Bandits.
11637580	11638460	That's all I had.
11638460	11639100	All right.
11639100	11640540	No, that's a great last minute story.
11640540	11641980	It's completely appropriate.
11641980	11645420	I will ask, I know Darcy, you don't usually have a ton of last minute stories, but sometimes
11645420	11645580	you do.
11645580	11646460	So, you have anything for us?
11647020	11647340	No.
11647340	11647420	Okay.
11647420	11647820	No.
11647820	11648380	Cool.
11648380	11648700	All right.
11648700	11651500	Then we're going to go ahead and start to make the moves to wrap things up tonight.
11652140	11653260	Great show back.
11653260	11657900	I really, it was hard to be gone an extra week, but I'm really glad to be back.
11658620	11663340	As I've mentioned before, we will not be live next week, but we're not, we are going to,
11663340	11665260	thankfully it works out, we are going to have a show.
11666140	11669580	So, please be on the lookout on our social media because we're going to be soliciting
11669580	11673420	your questions to help us build the next show that's coming up.
11673420	11677820	And I seem to remember an email that had a question we need to still get to to answer
11677820	11678060	that.
11678060	11680300	I said we do that the next time we record a show.
11680300	11685180	So, we'll handle all of that for our recorded in advance show for next Sunday.
11685180	11688540	So, we will still have something new on the podcast feed for you guys and something new
11688540	11693180	for those of you that are here for Bobby's show live on Twitch Sunday night, something
11693180	11694140	to view right after that.
11694140	11695100	So, that'll be really good.
11695900	11698780	But we have run really long and I think it's time to wrap things up.
11698780	11701820	So, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
11701820	11703740	So, I'll start tonight.
11703740	11711820	My final thought is I've been enjoying playing the games like more of them this week, a diverse
11712380	11714860	different set of games than just nothing but MMOs.
11714860	11718220	And I'm going to try to kind of keep doing that and make really good use of my game pass
11718220	11720380	and stuff and have more games to tell you guys about.
11720380	11725660	The place where I've been slacking is streaming, which I feel like is always my struggle, but
11725660	11730220	just with my new job and the traveling that goes into my new job, it's been a little bit
11730220	11731900	harder to get to that regularly.
11731900	11735740	But I'm going to hope as we get into the new year, I can really settle down and try to
11735740	11737420	do that a little more regularly for you guys.
11737420	11739820	Because I know you all want to see me play Death Stranding.
11739820	11741020	I know you do.
11741020	11742540	So, that's my final thought.
11742540	11743580	I can't wait.
11743580	11744940	Loki, since you left, you go next.
11744940	11745740	What's your final thought?
11746620	11753260	Looks like Pigeon Simulator is much of a simulator of pigeons as Surgeon Simulator was a surgical
11753260	11753900	simulation.
11754460	11755020	It's great.
11755020	11756220	I can't wait to try it out.
11756780	11757340	All right.
11757340	11759500	And last but not least, Dark Sakura, I hope you feel better.
11759500	11760300	I'm glad we were able to.
11760300	11762140	I would have been really sad if you couldn't be here tonight.
11762140	11765180	I mean, I would have completely understood, but that would have meant one month of no
11765180	11765900	Dark Sakura.
11765900	11768460	So, I'm glad you're here.
11768460	11769660	Glad you made it through the show.
11769660	11771740	Any final words of tonight from you?
11771740	11772700	I have no filter.
11773500	11777100	I am still completely zoned.
11777100	11778780	Especially when on the meds.
11778780	11780060	And I have no fucking filter.
11781100	11782700	This is the craziest feeling ever.
11782780	11786860	And I'm kind of digging it, but I'm sorry if I've been a bitch.
11787740	11788300	It's okay.
11788300	11789100	A bitcher.
11789100	11791580	It's a bitchier than usual.
11791580	11791980	Yes.
11791980	11792300	All right.
11793340	11794300	Actually, I'm not really sorry.
11796220	11796620	All right.
11797660	11798220	That's it.
11798220	11799980	Thank you guys so much for joining us here.
11799980	11801020	Back live tonight.
11801020	11802540	We'll be back live in two weeks.
11802540	11805180	We'll be back in a taped form next week.
11805180	11806220	Thank you guys for being here.
11806220	11807020	Thanks for your support.
11807020	11807980	Thanks for sticking with us.
11808540	11813020	Despite the fact that sometimes the cable knocks out our show for a week or that our
11813020	11814300	real lives get in the way.
11814300	11816860	Things happen at the end of the day.
11816860	11817900	Happy gaming.
11817900	11822860	Keep the debate spirited, but keep the debate friendly, positive, and peaceful.
11822860	11824220	And don't be a dick.
11824220	11824620	That's it.
11824620	11826700	I'll get off my high horse and roll the credits.
11826700	11827660	Have a great night, everybody.
11827660	11827900	Bye.
