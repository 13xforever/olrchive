00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
With your hosts, DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This week it's the year of the goose and I'm perfectly okay with that. It's a welcome shake up to the news we've grown sadly accustomed to like studio closures, mind boggling litigation, etc.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This is just one honk in tonight's news, stay tuned for the rest starting right now on the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio live tonight with episode number 795 for this October the 6th of 2019.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
My name is Rob Roberts and joining me here in studio is Techmaster Loki.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's me and I'm very close to the camera now.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You are, yeah, extreme close up.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Hello sir, we are taping live of course on Twitch as we always do every Sunday night at the voice of geeks network twitch.tv slash vog network and yes I'm laughing for those of you that are watching on Twitch because I see right there the title is wrong yet again.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Sorry guys, I had to do a lot of last minute switcheroo for tonight's show because not joining us tonight, the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers, she was going to be here but she had like kind of like a last minute like sick bout thing.

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So I'll let her tell you what she wants next week. It's her business. But sadly she is not here tonight and it was a little more like sudden-ish so we're kind of fixing things on the fly as we go.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
As is the joy of doing a live production as we do here at the voice geeks network.

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Like I literally had mayonnaise on in my beard just a second ago and I'm all sunburned because I was outside for five hours today.

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
This does not have to do with video games necessarily.

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It sort of, it almost did.

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So they had the Sacramento air show this weekend so I took my kids to go see planes because the last air show that they went to, well one of my kids wasn't even born then and the other one he was too small so he was really afraid of everything because it was so loud.

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So we went and saw everything today but they had the PlayStation truck there and I meant to go play video games.

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:19,000
In fact you know I had told them because we looked up online to see what games were there and they had like some new games that were only shown at like Comic Con and E3 and stuff like that.

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I was like oh cool I want to go play some of those games.

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
So okay we'll do it on our way out you know since it's on the way to the car.

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And sure enough we go walking by you know at least a couple hours before the place is closed and they're all yeah we're done.

23
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm like god damn it you know so we missed it.

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Unfortunately which is too bad because I want to play the Iron Man VR game but my kids want to play the Iron Man VR game and now they can't ever they can't ever play the well until a while but we'll get to that.

25
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
All right.

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So yeah unfortunately our soccer not here tonight.

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But the air show being in town.

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I've been hearing that all day long.

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's very loud flying over the house because I don't live that far.

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I mean not to give my home address out on Twitch.

31
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Well they they fly pretty far away.

32
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I mean they're all 400 miles an hour as it takes them a bit of distance to turn around.

33
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So they go by the house.

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So good luck napping right.

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Yeah yeah exactly.

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Anyway should we get into some news.

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Sure video game news talk about what's going on in the gaming world.

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Sure let's do that.

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And we're going to get into our kickoff story tonight which has to do with a pretty big change over at PlayStation kind of a sudden change on Monday.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It was announced via Twitter.

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I mean this is the day all the big things.

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yeah all the big things now get announced on Twitter.

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Sony announced on Twitter that Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios chairman.

44
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
That's a hell of a title.

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Shawn Layden left.

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
That's it.

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
He's left the gaming division.

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I was going to say I don't know who he is.

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yes you do.

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
When you see the picture you know exactly who he is.

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
He's always the guy at the start of E3 press conferences and he's the guy that's up on stage.

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
He's kind of you know he's not the Reggie of Sony but like close at which yes I know Reggie retired.

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Come on.

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
But always in our hearts right.

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So he's kind of like that guy for Sony.

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I like their fake VP better.

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I wish he was back.

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Oh from the commercials years ago.

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yeah of course.

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Anyway the tweet went like this.

61
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
PlayStation tweeted on September 30th on Monday.

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It is with great emotion that we announced that worldwide studios chairman Shawn Layden will be departing SIE.

63
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
His visionary leadership will be greatly missed.

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
We wish him success in future endeavors and are deeply grateful for his years of service.

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Thanks for everything Shawn.

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And that was the tweet.

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
That that's the tweet.

68
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
That was it.

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
But still can't help but feel kind of sudden.

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Shawn Layden was with Sony for 32 years.

71
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
That's a long time.

72
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
A very long time.

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Here's the interesting thing about the tweet.

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It didn't say anything like will be leaving or is retiring or it just says not here anymore.

75
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Now you could tinfoil half this a bit.

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I mean what happened was he suddenly let go which I don't know why it's not like so did he leave squirt porn in like someplace you know or am I getting him confused with Randy Pitchford.

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm getting him confused with Randy Pitchford.

78
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yes you're getting him confused with Randy Pitchford.

79
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Well maybe I don't know who knows.

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I mean people are going to make shit up and at the end of the day for all we know he could have could have underlined bolded some type of urgent medical or family issue something we're not aware of that may have pulled him out of that.

81
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And if that's the case then heaven forbid I hope he's OK personally.

82
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Of course there's a lot of people want to theorize he's going to Microsoft or you know something you know.

83
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I don't think they need him to go to Microsoft.

84
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:45,000
But I still I still think if it was something like that where he left one company to go to another he would announce that he's like or there would have been like a grace period.

85
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
He will be retiring and you know or leaving the company in weeks or something like that.

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Or by now shit what this happened on Monday like we would have heard the announcement about where he ended up you know.

87
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
So it's interesting.

88
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I mean again I don't want to pry too much because this could be a completely 100 percent personal matter.

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And that is just the reality. And if that's the case then you know so be it.

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And I hope he's OK and his family's OK and all that stuff.

91
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:22,000
But certainly it does have you kind of going wow especially when we're talking about the ramp up towards PlayStation 5 and kind of the fact that this year Sony's been kind of absent this year right.

92
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:32,000
They didn't do E3 this year. They've kind of been taking the year off because there is this ramp up happening towards a PlayStation 5 which you know I think we all generally accept as the inevitability.

93
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
In 2020 your personal tinfoil hat theory Loki.

94
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I don't know. Maybe he's going to the Coleco team and to launch that console.

95
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Or Atari or Atari. Oh yeah. I forgot they had a console. Is that already out yet.

96
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I don't know. It is not. It's actually on a show roll later. So stay OK. There's actually a pretty big news item with it. So stay tuned.

97
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
But it doesn't actually suck. Well we'll see.

98
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But anyway I don't know again it doesn't the mold doesn't feel right for somebody leaving to go to the competition. You know what I mean.

99
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
This is this mold doesn't feel right for that. I don't know. So I don't know.

100
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Let's see cause you know in chat says hope it's not for medical reasons. Hope the guy is all right. Yeah.

101
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Why not sit on Twitter though like you think. I don't know. Well because people people are going to notice you know the next time Sony does a public event.

102
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Plus they I think they have a responsibility to report to stockholders things that like it's not the type of thing you wouldn't put on Twitter.

103
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I guess we're waiting for their shareholders meeting or can it could be the type of thing that they have to disclose it or announce it at some point.

104
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I think I don't know all the rules admittedly so but I would theorize that I mean his name's on the Web site and stuff and if he doesn't work there anymore he doesn't represent them especially if it is if it does end up being a competitor thing.

105
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:00,000
They're going to scrub him pretty quick from all those types of places and people are going to notice that you can't just sweep a major personnel change like this under the rug.

106
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So you can you can time these sorts of announcements a certain way which is most certainly what happened with Reggie fees in May.

107
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You know a lot of the timing there was very deliberate but we know what happened with Reggie fees in May. Yeah he's what he what he wanted to spend more time with his growing children and he'd been in the industry long enough he kind of wanted to retire right.

108
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yeah so he and he earned it and he kind of wants to think he strikes me as the type now that's going to do the scholarly thing I bet he writes a book.

109
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
That's that that seems like the Reggie fees in May thing that's going to happen he's going to write a book and that's you know he I'd fucking buy it.

110
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'd buy the audio book for that for sure. Would you buy a Reggie audio book. Maybe I would anyway but we don't know what happened here.

111
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You know it's kind of like that and that's the whole that's the whole kind of news worthiness of this I suppose is when you compare it to what happened with Reggie like this is very well compared to like.

112
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Was it Kazari or something like that. You know what are the differences. Oh we we we had plenty of notice that Kazari Kazari was promoted before he left.

113
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Yeah so he was over much more of Sony than just PlayStation at one point. And then I think just within the past couple of years did he retire and I think that was very different.

114
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It should be noted and in this report I'm reading on the whole thing from Engadget. I like their blog even if they got rid of Joysticks still all those years ago but I still check in on Engadget once in a while.

115
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And they do note that there has been frequent changes of leadership over at PlayStation including President Andrew House being replaced with John Corderra who then swapped roles with Jim Ryan this past February.

116
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Ryan is now the front man for worldwide studios news not laden. And this is all of course gearing up for the PlayStation 5 launch. Could this have been something where he was asked to go.

117
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:54,000
We don't know. I mean there's that dramatic. I think there's always that kind of part of us. We're going to keep making up the same part that can't help but look when you see an accident on the side of the road.

118
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Like there's just that part of us as much as we don't like to admit it that kind of wants to go like oh is it drama when in reality it may just very well be like a personal thing and endeavor and I just don't want to work here anymore.

119
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Well maybe you never know. But again something like that usually wouldn't be so sudden. I don't know. So strange. And I guess this leads to kind of another side conversation you didn't even recognize the name Shawn Layden you had to see a picture of him realize who he was.

120
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:35,000
So how important to us as gamers are these types of executive figures. I think we've talked in the past plenty about well folks people but let's talk specifically about this way.

121
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:47,000
The direction that Sony has gone recently. I mean they've had good first party titles but like everything else has been kind of. So like let's see what happens.

122
00:10:47,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I don't know. I don't really know what this how this is going to impact anything. Yeah just different for sure. Well I mean we don't really know until we see the first press conference or you know news flash or whatever that doesn't have Shawn Layden.

123
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It has you know whoever's assumably this other gentleman or somebody that's going to be replacing him. Yeah. Now you know when we talk about executives certainly like you know Reggie Fils-Aime was iconic for Nintendo Doug Bowser.

124
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You know still kind of getting his feet wet a little bit but I think people have been pretty receptive to Doug Bowser in many ways. And then over at Microsoft you know obviously I don't think any of us particularly cared for Don Mattrick.

125
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:42,000
And he kind of hosed the Xbox one. But now Phil Spencer things are going so much better. Yeah. Over there. So you know everything seems to be coming up better with Microsoft these days.

126
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So yeah at least it seems like recently though with even though just in the last week or so there's been some steps towards the right direction I think on the Sony side.

127
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:06,000
But yeah overall this year it's been mostly kind of Microsoft making a lot of the good moves but I don't know I don't know what he does. So I really know we'll see we'll see what's different next year.

128
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I mean that's kind of the way I'm not going to try to figure out what he's doing or what he left or why he left. I don't care. I don't care.

129
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Going to our chat over at Twitch TV slash vog network She-Hulk 10 says Sony needs help changes etc. But that's the puzzling thing to me. I have to be I have to be candid She-Hulk. I'm not sure I see it the same way.

130
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I don't think Sony I didn't think Sony was in this type of position where they need help. Or is there now this is what I will give you because in the current view perspective it does seem to me Sony is still for the most part leading.

131
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Yeah Nintendo and Switch is definitely like they're a factor now where in the Wii U cycle maybe we could all sleep on Nintendo a little bit for Sony Microsoft. Now we can't really sleep on Nintendo.

132
00:12:51,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So in the current view though it feels like Sony's doing really well. The PlayStation 4 has been a really good success so far. They've had a lot of very well received titles between what God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, the PlayStation VR didn't end up being a flash in the pan which I think many people thought it might as a Sony peripheral.

133
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:21,000
But I don't think it's really necessarily hit the ground running either with it. I'm glad that they're still supporting it and they're planning on supporting it into you know the PlayStation 5.

134
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:34,000
But like I want to see them do more with it like because at the very least like let's get some new controllers for it because God we're still using the move controllers and those are old as fuck and they don't work really well.

135
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:47,000
So it'd be nice to get something better. And I'm you know I know that they're saying that they're going to keep the existing hardware but I can't help imagine that there's not going to be another PlayStation VR at some point that's going to be better.

136
00:13:47,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Well let me ask this question now to you and to all of you out there in our chat room over at Twitch TV slash vog network and those of you listening on the podcast feed if you care to tweet or email us this week let me ask this question because I mentioned everything seems OK in the current view of Sony.

137
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Could the concern be about the future view of Sony because you know you look to the future and again Nintendo has been creeping more and more and more in the gaming industry.

138
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:25,000
They've come up with this killer product and the switch and so forth. And even though in this last generation you know Microsoft has been lagging behind a little bit I think we all know that Phil Spencer has played a really good game of catch up.

139
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Microsoft has positioned themselves with all these new studios who are developing games. Microsoft has this project x cloud game pass has been I assume doing pretty well for Microsoft or at least they're really pushing it whereas PlayStation Now.

140
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I don't I don't feel like we're hearing as much. You know in fact I think we have a story coming up later that PlayStation Now is getting a little cheaper right. Yeah. So could the concern be about the future view of Sony.

141
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It could be and definitely right now as it stands. I don't know what Microsoft and Sony have the offer for the next generation of consoles other than. Yeah the graphics will be better.

142
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I don't know what they're going to offer. I mean granted with Microsoft at least I know that they've got all those studios are developing games that are probably going to be shown off at E3 this year.

143
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Sony though like I don't know what they have. I don't know what they're working on. I don't know. It's all kind of just a mystery.

144
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I mean I hear you like personally like and it's really weird to say because even though I own an Xbox One it's by far the least of the three consoles I play.

145
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
But the reality is like I am really excited for Microsoft's next console.

146
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Those are words I never thought would leave my leave my mouth ever since we were talking about direct Xbox years and years ago right or the very first Xbox in the years the show started.

147
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Let me say it again because I bet some of you are on the same page with me.

148
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I am really excited for Microsoft's next console because I also feel like and this is why this is the why is important.

149
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,000
It has nothing necessarily to do with the Xbox One or this directly but it has to do with this is going to be the console.

150
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:16,000
This is going to be the punch line of Bill Spencer's leadership and everything that the chess pieces have been maneuvering for the past three years.

151
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's going to be the cloud gaming you know enabled thing and kind of the resultant of that the marriage to Windows 10 and the PC and the results into that.

152
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I feel like there's a lot kind of like writing in the next Microsoft in a really exciting way.

153
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:42,000
When I look at Sony it's not so much a negative but I do admit I do kind of look at the PlayStation 5 and I go okay it's five right.

154
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:56,000
It was four now it's five right. Yeah it's just it's the next increment it's it's more powerful or and you know at the end of the day what's the golden rule of gaming here at all our system is only as good as the games that are on it right.

155
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:07,000
So I mean assuming Sony continues to put out these kickass things like God of War you know our sequel to Horizon Zero Dawn is coming and last of us and you know these different franchises the Sony is does very well.

156
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm not necessarily sure they have anything to worry about in that regard but maybe there's some type of concern about just like the system itself the hardware the formula starting to feel a little stale.

157
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Maybe what Sony needs is to not release a PlayStation 5. Don't misunderstand me. Maybe it's time to release a Sony new thing here.

158
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Sony new thing. Sony new thing. Trademark patent pending. Let me go to some of the comments with you guys in our chat over at Twitch TV slash vog network.

159
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
SheHulk10 sounds like might have been on the same page with us a little bit saying resting on their past future not good.

160
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:54,000
VGRealness says the thing with Sony as to why they're doing so well is circumstance. They had a head start a cheaper price and both Nintendo and Microsoft flubbed.

161
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Next generation might not be the same case for them. The playing field will be much more leveled. I agree with that to an extent although I would add that Sony's game offerings you know they still have been able to really provide things that people just don't get as excited about on the Microsoft side.

162
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:18,000
But is that going to be the story leading into the next generation of consoles now that Microsoft has what nine new studios in their back pocket all working on something.

163
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Maybe just we're not hearing about it now because they want to keep it a secret so that they can't counteract. And by they I mean it could be Microsoft or Sony can't counteract whatever the plan is.

164
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And so that's why it's like let's keep it close to the chest now and figure out. We'll announce it when we're ready I guess.

165
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:44,000
PlayStation 5 is a mistake. Sony is forced into the competition. PlayStation 4 should be a 10 year console. PlayStation 5 is going to be a mess.

166
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Well to be fair to the vision of 10 year consoles when they talk about 10 year console they kind of include the end of life in that right. I mean if you look at PlayStation 3 PlayStation 3 launched what 2006.

167
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:08,000
PlayStation 3 didn't really drop off the market until a couple of years ago. Right. Yeah. Maybe 2017. So there was a 10 year life cycle the PlayStation 3.

168
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And I imagine PlayStation 4 will have something similar at the end of the day. Not everybody is going to be able to afford a PlayStation 5 out the gate or whatever it is Sony decides to concoct.

169
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Now some other comments here from other chatters. Quest Buster says it's coming down to exclusives at this point.

170
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:30,000
There are some exclusives that I want on the Microsoft side but there are a lot more on the Sony side that have made me spend more time with the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 as an example.

171
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Sia Tabiri says Sony still has Japan. It might switch up in the U.S. but Sony will still have a ton of support from Japan.

172
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:47,000
You know what. Damn good point. Microsoft cannot seem to get through in Japan. They've tried time and time again. It's not working out for them.

173
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
They tried big time with Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey and on it. But you know two games.

174
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
But did any of those studios that they purchase specialize in Japanese RPGs or anything like that?

175
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
To my knowledge no but you never know what they might be cooking up.

176
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm sure they're aware of like what it is. I don't know.

177
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Yeah. V.G. Realness says I don't think PlayStation 5 will have as quick of an adoption rate. Kind of talking into that 10 year lifespan a little bit too.

178
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Kaijiro says maybe I will get PlayStation 5 when Grand Theft Auto 6 or the next Elder Scrolls. That's about it.

179
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Just call me Ms. VR. That's where I will be in the next generation.

180
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:35,000
So lots and lots of great comments you guys tonight. Other comments here. Jim Sally says I can't wait for the PlayStation 5 so I can get cheap PlayStation 4 games.

181
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
There you go.

182
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Kaijiro says PlayStation 3 was a flop. I'm talking about PlayStation 4. It's a great console to which Bobby kind of follows up.

183
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Yeah PlayStation 3 did not flop in Japan. PlayStation 3 didn't flop when all was said and done either.

184
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:56,000
PlayStation 3 kind of flopped out the gate. They stumbled when the gun went off and everybody came out the gate.

185
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:07,000
But they kind of had more of a slow burn. I think they were able to catch up a little bit better through some of their strong exclusives and titles that came out in the PlayStation 3 later in its life.

186
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I just think that the cell processor wasn't as powerful as they had hoped it would have been.

187
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And Bobby says PlayStation 3 redeemed itself in the end. We'll see. It's very interesting. This whole executive departure could just be a sign of the future.

188
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:33,000
It could be nothing. It could be the guy's personal life and again I hope everything is okay with him personally. It's just video games.

189
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I certainly don't wish him unwell or anything like that. Nor should anybody out there on the internet, on Twitter and things like that.

190
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:51,000
So I hope the guy is okay at the end of the day. But if it is a business boardroom type of decision, then I'm very curious to see the motivations behind it.

191
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Anyway, let's move on. We're going to move on into our gaming weeks and talk a little bit about the types of games that we have been playing this week.

192
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Loki, why don't you start us off?

193
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:11,000
So I did play more Borderlands 3. I've been playing that quite a bit. I looked at my progress and I think we had 45% through the game already.

194
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'm enjoying it. It's more Borderlands. I'm definitely looking forward to beating the game and starting back over again with a different class because I think it'll be fun.

195
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I also played more Untitled Goose Game and I played a game very briefly because I started playing and I was like, no, this game looks too good.

196
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I want to stream it and I don't want to ruin it for myself by not streaming it first. So I started playing What the Golf and it's great.

197
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:49,000
And they have even a streamer mode that's incredibly hard. So I'm going to play that. I'm going to stream it at some point.

198
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
What's the streamer mode?

199
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I don't know because I didn't look at it because I didn't want to spoil it for myself.

200
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Okay, but you know it's harder or something.

201
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:04,000
It says it's harder and they score you. It's supposed to be harder and they score you based on how many strokes it takes you to get through the whole thing because it's like all.

202
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:12,000
So I didn't want to ruin it for myself, but the game is silly and kind of has that. I don't know.

203
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:19,000
A lot of these games have this kind of Katamari feel to them, but this is like a really silly idea.

204
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Ironically enough, it's almost like that time the car type of concept where it's a racing game, but it's like a puzzle.

205
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Every level is different or broken in some way. It's kind of like What the Golf is. They tout it as a golf game for people who hate golf.

206
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,000
It's weird though. It's a great game and I really want to stream it, but I did play a little bit of it and it was awesome.

207
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Fifth Dream today says I'm in the credits of What the Golf. Kickstarter thing?

208
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Yes, I think it was.

209
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Got it. Makes sense. Anything else?

210
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
A little bit of Pokemon Go and that was it.

211
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Alright, my gaming week then. Yeah, I kind of say a little bit of Pokemon Go and all that stuff.

212
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,000
The AR world games or whatever you want to call it on cell phones.

213
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Also, it's kind of been a bit of an MMO week. I'm continuing on Final Fantasy XIV still.

214
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:19,000
My Gunbreaker is just about to hit 77, but then I was playing a little bit of WoW Classic.

215
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
And then because I was playing WoW Classic, then the conversation kind of turned to,

216
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Well, why not just dip back into WoW retail for a little bit, even though I was just playing in the current expansion.

217
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
And I was like, I'm going to start a new character because this is what I do.

218
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,000
And I was streaming the other night and I'm like, I think this is just kind of what I do in World of Warcraft.

219
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I really like just leveling characters because then when I get to the end of the game and I'm in like the end game content and stuff,

220
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I'm like, I have commitment issues. I don't want to raid. Like, I don't want to go that far down.

221
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I don't want to do all that end game content. So I just kind of like, I'm going to just start from the beginning all over again and level up.

222
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:00,000
So that's where I'm at. So I started leveling in Arcane Mage. Why? I don't know. I just felt like it.

223
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:07,000
But Shane's been an influence in that regard, too. We've been leveling up together. So, you know, but then even like when he hasn't been on,

224
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
then I'm like, all right, well, you know, because we're trying to keep our characters in sync.

225
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
So I'll go play my Horde Rogue for a little bit and go level that on my own.

226
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
So it's just kind of like, all right. So that's just been a thing.

227
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:27,000
But I have been saying that probably after October dies down because I have a lot of travel coming up this month.

228
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I'm going to be out of town for two days next week. I'm going to be out of town for three days the week after.

229
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:39,000
And then the week after that is the week I'm in Vegas. So that's why we don't have a show October 20th, because I'll be out of town at a conference there.

230
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:47,000
But I am talking about for a week at some point, maybe in early November, I'm going to have a MMOs are banned week.

231
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I'm not going to allow myself to play MMOs for an entire week. All right. Force myself to play some of the other stuff that I need to catch up on.

232
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
You know, I'm not even talking about things like Untitled Goose Game, although that certainly is in the backlog.

233
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:07,000
But I mean, like I decided to pick up Horizon Zero Dawn because it was 15 bucks on that latest PlayStation sale.

234
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
So I really need to sit down and start playing that.

235
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:17,000
So I'm going to I'm going to be giving myself a self-imposed ban on MMOs coming up in the near future, just for a week to catch up on other games.

236
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:24,000
But also, the other thing about traveling is that I can't really play, you know, anything but Nintendo Switch when I'm traveling.

237
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Hey, you can get your progress in Legend of Zelda.

238
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Exactly. I can finally finish the Zelda Link's Awakening, that whole thing. I can finish that and maybe some Mario Maker as well.

239
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Although hotel Wi-Fi can be hit and miss. So I kind of just have to be the single player.

240
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Yeah, my son keeps making levels for me to play in Mario Maker and because he thinks it's really funny to make impossible levels.

241
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
And I don't know. It's just cute.

242
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Bonz006 in chat says you could play a PSP while on the road. I don't even know if my PSP works anymore.

243
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I do still have two PlayStation Vita's, though.

244
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
A what?

245
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Play... Vita? You remember that? Back in the day, V-I-T-E.

246
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
See that little guy over there sitting on the shelf? That's a PlayStation Vita.

247
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Oh, I thought that was a PSP.

248
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
No, no.

249
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
No, I'm kidding. I know what a Vita is.

250
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
That is my heaven's word, Vita.

251
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Yeah, I remember you had two of them.

252
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Remember that?

253
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:22,000
So, um, yeah. So I could play the Vita. I don't know what I'd play on it. But I could play PSP games on the Vita, actually.

254
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I have one of those PlayStation TVs somewhere. Buried somewhere.

255
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Actually, that's what I should do is I should fire up that Vita. Just convert it to an American Vita or whatever.

256
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Sign into my account and download, like, some of those PSP games. Like the Final Fantasy IV reimagining and stuff.

257
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
That would actually be... I might... You know what? You might have inspired something.

258
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
I might actually charge up that Vita and play that when I'm on the road.

259
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I was gonna say, you know, like, you have, you know, you know all those, like, PlayStation Plus games that you have back when they used to offer, like, the Vita and the PSP games.

260
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I have a library of stuff that I don't even know what's out there. Like, I probably have all these Vita games that I'm unaware of.

261
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Like, oh, hey, I got all this stuff I can play on my PlayStation.

262
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Now to just find a charging cable for that. But I think it's just a standard USB.

263
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I think, yeah.

264
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
It's the same thing you charge your controllers with on a PlayStation 4. So, yeah. There you go.

265
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Alright. Anyway, so, well, to be continued. I'm out of town for two days this week, so I'll be doing portable gaming of some type.

266
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
While I'm... I don't want to say where I'm going, but it's not a very exciting place.

267
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I'll message you later, Loki. Alright, anyway. There's... Let me put it this way. There's gonna be nothing else for me to do there.

268
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
So, wait, wait, Loki. Loki. Loki.

269
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Ah. Yeah, right?

270
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Yeah.

271
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Anyway, Bonds006 says, what about Ingress? Maybe. I don't know. Alright. Anyhow, let's move on.

272
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Let's get into some other gaming stories and what's going on around the gaming industry. Loki, start us off.

273
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:00,000
So, this is unfortunate. Apparently, the developer of Mario and Luigi, that series, AlphaDream, they've gone bankrupt.

274
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:09,000
So, of course, they were originally known as AlphaStar and it had been a team of former Square employees.

275
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
That's right. Square, not Square Enix.

276
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Apparently, I guess, after releasing some of these... I don't know if they've done anything recently.

277
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:27,000
The last one that they did was Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga plus Bowser's Minions, Mario and Luigi, Bowser's Inside Story plus Bowser Jr. Story.

278
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I guess this is the last game they did. Not sure why they went bankrupt, but apparently, that's the case.

279
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:41,000
They were 400 million yen in debt, I guess, due to sluggish revenue in the last few years.

280
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
So, that's unfortunate because those games are pretty good.

281
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Yeah, those games were pretty good. Although, I have to admit, I kind of started to lose track of them because I kind of felt like it was kind of like the same formula again.

282
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I know, it's bad because a lot of fans of those games are going to not like that I said that, but I don't know.

283
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
If you asked me to name all the games in the series, I couldn't do it.

284
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,000
As much as I did enjoy the ones that I played and thought it was a cute and clever little series, but it's still sad to hear.

285
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I thought those games did well enough that I'm kind of surprised to hear this has happened.

286
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I don't know. I'm surprised they haven't... I know some of those came... Have they ported any of those to the Switch?

287
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:27,000
I know that you can download some of those, and I think those are our 3DS, but I'm surprised they haven't ported.

288
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
3DS, yes, for sure. Switch, I don't think so, which is a bummer.

289
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Yeah.

290
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Unless somebody in chat wants to correct, but I don't believe any of those games are on the Switch right now.

291
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Well, $3.7 million in debt, or 400 million yen, that's not that much.

292
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Can Nintendo absorb that with their vast amount of money and just bring another... have another first-party studio under their wing? I don't know.

293
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Really, Sears owes, like, 20 times that amount of money to somebody.

294
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I mean, like, in the print...

295
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Oh my god, wait. Quick aside. I'm sorry, I have to. So, I went to Sears this week because...

296
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Where?

297
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
At Arden, because it's still over there.

298
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Oh, I was going to say, there's like...

299
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Because, you're going to love this, Loki, I was at Arden Mall because, count the number of cameras on the back of that boy, that's right.

300
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
There's three cameras on that, so you know what that means. So, I was at Arden Mall anyway.

301
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:24,000
And then the topic came up where it was, hey, we should go... because we needed to replace luggage because Alan was on a business trip.

302
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:31,000
He went out to Denver and a certain airline carrier, who I otherwise really like, really shredded the shit out of his luggage.

303
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
And, like, we can't use it anymore because they, like, broke it.

304
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
And I wish he had said something within 24 hours because then they would have had to replace it.

305
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
But that's another story. So, long story short, we had to replace luggage.

306
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,000
So, I was like, well, like, you know, you can go to the fancy luggage places in the malls, but those places are so freaking expensive, right?

307
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
But then I was like, well, what about Sears or JCPenney? They sell luggage, right?

308
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
So, we went to Sears. Oh, my God.

309
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Tuesday morning. You should go there. They have tons of luggage.

310
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Oh, do they? Well, we went to Sears. No, we actually found something at Sears.

311
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,000
We found a gigantic piece of luggage, like, exactly what we needed for, like, 50 bucks.

312
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Oh, yeah.

313
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
That was less than what we paid at Target. You know what I mean?

314
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Yeah.

315
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Like, I was like, dang. So, for one, they're having to, like, really, you know, sell things, like, you know.

316
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,000
And I'm like, well, maybe this is a piece of shit luggage. I don't know. It looks nice. It seemed to, you know, do whatever.

317
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I mean, it's not, like, leather. It's not a fucking coach bag or something, but it gets the job done.

318
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
It's going to get shredded anyways, so, I mean.

319
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Exactly. The south, excuse me, Nameless Airlines is going to shred the bag again anyway.

320
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:40,000
But anyway, but we were in there. It was, like, empty, sad, and they were down to one register because it was, like, 30 minutes before closing.

321
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,000
And so, we go to the register. There's, like, 10 people in line and, like, two people checking out.

322
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I swear to God, I was like, can we just scan this barcode and buy it on Amazon? Because I've, like, had it.

323
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I, like, don't. We did wait and we bought it, but I'm like, no.

324
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I ever remember joking to Alan. I was like, no wonder this place is going bankrupt. Like, they don't know how to run it.

325
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Anyway, sorry. I had to do a quick aside.

326
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
But yes, how about the other, the Sears of gaming?

327
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I was like, when I thought you said you were going to Sears, I was like, to the Halloween store?

328
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Because that's what, that's what Sears become lately. It's a Halloween store.

329
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
No, I think there's, like, one Sears left in Sacramento, but Lord knows how much.

330
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Yeah, the other one, the other one is becoming much better.

331
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Yeah, there's going to be a round one in the movie theater, which, like, aside here, like, I get round one in movie theater,

332
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,000
but I don't understand how the movie theater is going to be on the second story, whereas the round one is going to be on the bottom.

333
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:41,000
You know, I was like, I guess everything nowadays is, like, the stadium seating, but, like, I just, I can't imagine,

334
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,000
like, you normally would think that those would be flopped.

335
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Well, maybe they're going to have more space.

336
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Maybe, I guess.

337
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Some of those, like, super big screens, because the Metreon, same way, right, in San Francisco?

338
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
True.

339
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,000
The Metreon has the movie theater up on the highest floor, and I think that's because some of those screens.

340
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Yeah, and everything's stadium seating nowadays, so it's not, it's not, like, sunk into the ground anymore.

341
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Yeah, that's, that's what's up. Because, yeah, the, the Metreon, speaking of, like, Sony things from the past,

342
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,000
the Metreon in San Francisco is, like, nothing. It's, it's Target is what it is.

343
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
It's, like, Target, Chipotle, and there's a movie theater up on the top floor.

344
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Like, it's nothing what it used to be back in the day.

345
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
But back in the day, when this show, you know, was first starting, that was, like, Sony headquarters,

346
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:25,000
and there was a fucking nice Sony store on the first floor, like, back when there was a Sony store,

347
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
and it was really cool, and then it's, like, the Sony movie theater.

348
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Do they still have the Walk of Fame there?

349
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Oh, no, they took that out a lot.

350
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Aw.

351
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Yeah, no, it's, it's part, because it's part of Target.

352
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Target, like, I'm telling you, Metreon is now Target.

353
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,000
We went to Target yesterday, and they've remodeled Target. They've, like, rebranded them, and now they're really weird.

354
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Yeah, they're a little, they're trying to be more boutique-y, like a JCPenney or something.

355
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
It's weird. They had a huge section for Frozen 2.

356
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Well, that's what they do now. They have, like, sections, instead of, like, here's clothing, here's electronics,

357
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:00,000
here's housewares and stuff. It's, like, here's Frozen 2, here's Star Wars, here's some other bullshit.

358
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
You know, it's, like, but I'm just trying to find this. Good luck.

359
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Like, my kids are trying to find, because the Switch console there, the demo kiosk wasn't working,

360
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:16,000
so they're all, where's the 3DS? I'm, like, I don't know. I think they got rid of it.

361
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Well, I think the answer is that it's the 3DS, and Nintendo is quietly sharing.

362
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Good point.

363
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Yeah, I think, I think it's more about that than about Target, Loki. I think it's that the 3DS is...

364
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Good point, yes.

365
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
...quietly being taken out back.

366
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,000
No, what 3DS?

367
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,000
They're cooking in a real nice meal. That's, uh, that's kinda, I don't think...

368
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Come here, boy. There's something in the bushes over there. I'll have to take a look.

369
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Look at the flowers. I think, I think, uh, I don't think that's a Target thing, Loki.

370
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Ah, that makes sense. I didn't think of that.

371
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
All right, let me now...

372
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,000
All right, let's move on. Let's talk a little bit about something going on in Microsoft's world.

373
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Microsoft filing an interesting patent. Now, here's the thing about patents. They may be nothing.

374
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Yes, Illumeroom, remember that?

375
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Oh, man. Actually, Illumeroom kinda sounded cool, though.

376
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:13,000
It was cool, but, like, it's just completely unfeasible, you know, with the projector system that you would need and...

377
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:19,000
How long until the patent runs out? How long before VOG presents the Illumeroom?

378
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
How long until that patent runs out and someone else can snatch it up?

379
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Because I'll buy it for YYR.

380
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Illumeroom?

381
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
The pixel shit is literally everywhere.

382
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Surrounds you.

383
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
It's coming out of the wall.

384
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
All right, anyway.

385
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Microsoft has put in a patent for a floor mat.

386
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:45,000
So, the interesting idea about this floor mat is that it would kind of be a very specified zone,

387
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,000
so that you're not, like, running into furniture, couches.

388
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,000
I mean, you might still run into Mr. Smoosh, because he'll run on that floor mat, but you never know.

389
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
But it's a virtual reality related floor mat.

390
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:02,000
But the interesting thing about this is that, wait a minute, this shows that Microsoft may still have an interest in virtual reality

391
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
when I think many folks thought, oh, they were going to go towards HoloLens.

392
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
But then, of course, you know, I think we kind of realized, oh, maybe HoloLens...

393
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Even though they showed Minecraft at 103, I think HoloLens is not so much a gaming thing now.

394
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Like, for tracking, though, that just seems like a bad idea.

395
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Like, that's like an idea I would think of before I thought of inside-out tracking.

396
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,000
It's like, well, I'm going to put a floor mat down, and that way we don't have to worry about tracking where the player is,

397
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
because the floor mat will know where it is. But it's giant. It is fucking huge.

398
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Whereas, like, inside-out tracking, I think, is much more contained, smaller, and I don't need to buy a goddamn floor mat that's, like, huge.

399
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Now, in the little patent, though, what's also very interesting about this is that there's a little camera device on top of the television.

400
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
There's a little 162 pointing at it. It's a Kinect.

401
00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:00,000
So, that's the other weird thing about this, because speaking about, you know, sunsetting things and leaving them out back and so forth,

402
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,000
we kind of thought Microsoft had distanced themselves from Kinect for gaming.

403
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Yes, I realize Kinect is still a thing in, you know, medicine and, you know, other types of...

404
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:20,000
It's going to be... I mean, granted, technology for cameras has gotten way, way, way better, but that's going to be a hard sell if they try to sell a Kinect 3 type of thing.

405
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Everyone's going to be like, fuck that, I ain't buying that shit.

406
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:34,000
So, anyway. So, I guess there would be, like, in this application, there'd be a start position that you stand on, and then you go into VR, and there's pressure sensors in the mat,

407
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:41,000
and there could be haptic vibrations in the mat. So, imagine, like, you get shot, and it's going to shake the ground or something.

408
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,000
That actually kind of sounds like it might be kind of cool. So, I don't know. Like, as long as it's not, like, earthquake and you fall on your ass.

409
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
That's a neat idea.

410
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
It's a neat idea. I'd have to see it in motion.

411
00:38:51,000 --> 00:39:00,000
But I just don't know, like, where that would add value to, like, the amount of, like, haptic sensors that would need to be all over the place in there.

412
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Like, for a floor mat that looks like that's a huge floor mat. I just can't imagine that would be a thing.

413
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Well, now, Microsoft did say that, or excuse me, in the patent, they haven't said anything officially on this,

414
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:20,000
but if you don't think you have enough square foots to put this thing down, apparently the mat may be interlocking floor tiles,

415
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:27,000
and you could set it up in a way that works for you. That could be very interesting if, like, maybe you can do, like, a...

416
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I think it's just, it's the wrong approach, but that's a cool idea that they came up with.

417
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Yeah, we'll see. I mean, again, it's a patent. It might not mean a damn thing, but it is still fun to think about.

418
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
You can put it in one of those VR gyms.

419
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:46,000
It reminds us that Microsoft may do something with VR in the next Xbox, when they haven't really talked a lot about it.

420
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Now, of course, Bobby, he loves his VR. Bobby Blackwolf is in the chat, and always quick to point out the things on VR,

421
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
saying, Microsoft has a VR headset. They call it Windows Mixed Reality.

422
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Microsoft never abandoned Kinect. They just retooled it for business uses. Well, I kind of did say that.

423
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
They even finally put out a true dev kit. Well, I did, I think I made it pretty clear.

424
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I said for gaming, but Kinect is still a thing. But it would be very interesting if Kinect came back to gaming,

425
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:19,000
kind of in the way, I mean, when you think about PlayStation VR, I think we thought Sony was done with Move,

426
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
and then they kind of repurposed, and we all loved that, right?

427
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
It was like, oh, I don't have to buy new controllers, because I happened to invest in the Move early on,

428
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:33,000
so I kind of had those already. So maybe, and it's a big maybe, bolded, underlined, italicized,

429
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:39,000
you know, if the Kinect is to be a thing with VR, maybe existing Kinects of a certain type would work.

430
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I would want that to happen. Like, I would want them to be brand new tech,

431
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:52,000
because like, the camera tech alone is just going to be so much better now than it was in the previous Kinect.

432
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,000
But at the end of the day, this is all wank and speculating based off of a patent,

433
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,000
which, you know, most of the time ends up being nothing, as we mentioned before,

434
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Oh my god! The next Xbox is the floor mat. The whole system is the floor mat.

435
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,000
What was that? Was that Nintendo or something, where it was like, it used to be the console is this.

436
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
The Nintendo Revolution is the Wii.

437
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
The helmet. It's a giant helmet.

438
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Was it Nintendo Revolution?

439
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Yeah, that was the revolution, the concept video.

440
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:26,000
It ended up being the Wii. It was like, nobody knew what it was, there was all these rumors about...

441
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
It's a VR headset.

442
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
You put it on the table, and Princess Leia shows up, and that's how you play your games.

443
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Like, there was all this crazy shit about the Wii back in the day.

444
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I swear to god, that was the thing about the Wii, right?

445
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
That was the holographic images that it projected.

446
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
And then the Luma Room was right around that same time.

447
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
They had a bunch of weird stuff.

448
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Remember that?

449
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Yeah, I remember. We were dumb.

450
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,000
People were dumb.

451
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
Alright, let's move on.

452
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
We have a cool little story about somebody from Nintendo, right?

453
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Yes. So, this is pretty cool.

454
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:04,000
So, Reggie is actually being inducted into the International Video Game Hall of Fame.

455
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Now, I'm not sure which hall of fame that is, because there's so many of them.

456
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
But, he's being inducted into that one.

457
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Oh, I'm sorry, that's the one in Iowa, that's right.

458
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
They're the ones that first...

459
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Oh god, is that the one that's not even near a major airport?

460
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Yes, they're the ones that...

461
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Where like, Walter Day is like, no, this is the capital of video games,

462
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,000
and because I talk the loudest, that's what you're all gonna go with, right?

463
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Yes, that's pretty much what happened.

464
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Am I wrong?

465
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Yes, it's Ottumwa, Iowa is where it's in.

466
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
They established it in 2010.

467
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
We called it first, though, I think.

468
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
We said that we're gonna be the Video Game Hall of Fame.

469
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Did we?

470
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Well, we called it at the same time.

471
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
When they announced it, we double announced it, so it doesn't count.

472
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:54,000
So apparently, they inducted several Guinness World Record holders.

473
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
See, right there, come on.

474
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Right there, that is why it can't be the Hall of Fame.

475
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
You can't put Guinness World Record holders there.

476
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,000
So, anyways, Reggie Fils-Aime, though, has been inducted into it.

477
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
And, that's awesome.

478
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
So, are you gonna go?

479
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Is he gonna go?

480
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
That's the question I want to know the answer to.

481
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Is he gonna go?

482
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I don't think he went, because he did make a video about it.

483
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Oh, he made a video.

484
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
But it's the Walter Day Lifetime Achievement Award is what he got.

485
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Wait, Walter Day named the award?

486
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Okay.

487
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Okay.

488
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,000
All right.

489
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Neat.

490
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Yeah.

491
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,000
So, neat that he got it, but I ain't going to Iowa.

492
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I wonder how many visitors you have.

493
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Have they published visitation numbers?

494
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Like, how many visitors a year come through the video game Hall of Fame?

495
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I don't know.

496
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Let's take a look and see if they do.

497
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I bet they don't.

498
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Low-key, I have to admit, I kind of want to go.

499
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:00,000
So, here's what they, yeah, so this year they inducted, let's see here.

500
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Have any of our listeners been to the video game Hall of Fame in Iowa?

501
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Have any of you been there?

502
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
So, some of the things that they inducted this year.

503
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
So, Reggie Fils-Aime for the Walter Day Lifetime Achievement Award.

504
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Community Action Award, they gave it to Don Mack, who's founder of Galloping Ghost Productions,

505
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
and he has the Galloping Ghost Arcade.

506
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Well, that's a pretty big arcade.

507
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I recognize that.

508
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:31,000
The video game Palooza, and they're like a STEM organization.

509
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
A YouTube channel?

510
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
No, no, no.

511
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
It's like a STEM organization.

512
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Okay.

513
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Industry leader.

514
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,000
They had game developers.

515
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
They gave it to Fortnite, Smash Brothers Melee.

516
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Assassin's Creed, they inducted in there.

517
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Doom, Super Mario 64, Street Fighter II.

518
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Actually, they said Street Fighter franchise, but whatever.

519
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Ms. Pac-Man, Computer Space, Tetris, and Galaga.

520
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:59,000
They have 90s gamer, 2000 gamer, Golden Age gamers.

521
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I don't know, no podcasts on there.

522
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:09,000
We'll change our opinion of you once, you know, you contact us, but like, in the meantime.

523
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Yeah, I'm thinking our chances are real good.

524
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
I'll go.

525
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
No, you know what?

526
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Yeah, induct us.

527
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I'll go.

528
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I'll go.

529
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Why not?

530
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
How hard can it be to get to, what is it, Otuma?

531
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
How hard can it be to get there?

532
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Is it connected by a freeway?

533
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,000
I don't know.

534
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Highway?

535
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Yeah, in fact, they did the induction ceremony this weekend.

536
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Oh.

537
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
So, yeah.

538
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Well.

539
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Good times.

540
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,000
All right.

541
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,000
They even have a Facebook event for it.

542
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
So that's how you know it's legit.

543
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Okay.

544
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Yeah, all right.

545
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Well, we'll have to plan a trip out there someday.

546
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
All right.

547
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
No.

548
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Anyhow, let's move on, shall we, to the next story?

549
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
I don't want to go there.

550
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,000
Super Mario Maker 2.

551
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,000
So you may remember when it launched, one of the things that people were asking is like,

552
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,000
hey, you know, this playing with friends thing is kind of cool, but I got to have them all

553
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
in my house in order to play with them.

554
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Why is there no online matchmaking?

555
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Well, now there is.

556
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:14,000
So they've added online matchmaking with friends, and you can actually now challenge,

557
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,000
you know, the global challenge levels that they have.

558
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:27,000
They have multiplayer co-op, multiplayer versus, and you can create a room or join a room as well.

559
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
So that's kind of cool.

560
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
And then, of course, the nearby play is still there as well.

561
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
And, yeah.

562
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
So that's neat.

563
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Good.

564
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
It's a reason to definitely fire up Mario Maker 2 again.

565
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I wish I'd done that this week.

566
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:44,000
But, yeah, I forgot that this is something that kind of went into the game until it was

567
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
a little too late and it was showtime.

568
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:49,000
But I think it'll be a really fun stream to do with a friend or two, you know, go in there

569
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
and, yeah, I really wish the feature had been there when the game launched.

570
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,000
So I'm kind of curious out there, those of you listening, are you guys still playing

571
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Mario Maker 2?

572
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Like, you know, the first one seemed like it had legs that went on for a very long time,

573
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
but I feel like the second one, I don't know if it's because of the new Zelda game that

574
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,000
came out not long after or what have you, but I feel like not as many people really

575
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
talking about this one.

576
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I still feel like the game was strong.

577
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
It was a good game.

578
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:19,000
But I feel like I'm not hearing as much about this second game as I was the first game.

579
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Or maybe people found the formula tired the second time around.

580
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I'm not sure.

581
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
I still enjoyed it.

582
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Yeah, I don't know.

583
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Like, it seems like some of the stuff that they I wish they had not removed, like the

584
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:33,000
different Meebo skins and stuff like that that they had.

585
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
So that's kind of lame, but I don't know.

586
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I haven't really been into it like the first one.

587
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Bobby Blackwell, who seems to be the only chatter right now.

588
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Y'all doing OK?

589
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Knock, knock.

590
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Bobby in chat says, I stopped playing Mario Maker 2, but we'll open it back up.

591
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
So, yeah, it's a reason to go revisit it.

592
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
So that's always nice.

593
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
That's the nice thing about the post patches.

594
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,000
You know, say what you will about these patches that deliver content after the game has been

595
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:04,000
out, especially when it's like fixing bugs that should have been gone in the first place.

596
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,000
But when they add new things like this is doing, it's always a nice little treat, nice

597
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
little reason to go back and visit the game, right?

598
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Yeah.

599
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Yeah.

600
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,000
So I'll definitely have to do that at some moment.

601
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
So.

602
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
All right.

603
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
So let's move on and talk about I kind of referenced this a little earlier in the show,

604
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,000
but the price of PlayStation Now has dropped.

605
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,000
So PlayStation Now's price is now ten dollars a month and they've added some new games of

606
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
it.

607
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Earlier this week, Sony cut the twenty dollar a month subscription fee down to ten dollars

608
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
a month.

609
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,000
I don't know if this could be in response to all these cheap deals people are getting

610
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
on Microsoft Game Pass.

611
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
We don't really know the motivation for it.

612
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
We just know that the price did come down.

613
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:48,000
And of course, with that, Sony actually added some games to it, including God of War.

614
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
That's a pretty big deal.

615
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Grand Theft Auto 5.

616
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
That's a very big deal.

617
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Infamous Second Son and Uncharted 4.

618
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
They're saying this is on for a limited time, though.

619
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:02,000
They're just saying these four games are available on the service through January 2020.

620
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,000
And they're saying they're going to rotate games in and out on a regular basis.

621
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
It's a I find that a little weird.

622
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I mean, I get it was something more third party like Grand Theft Auto 5, I suppose.

623
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
But it does seem weird to be like I feel like God of War is a game they're going to end

624
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
up giving away on PlayStation Plus next year anyway.

625
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Yeah.

626
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,000
And Infamous Infamous Second Son was that's they are super old and they did get that way

627
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
a long time ago.

628
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,000
So here's my thing with this is that is kind of where they're lacking versus the whole

629
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Game Pass stuff, because Game Pass, it's all first party is included with that like day

630
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
one.

631
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,000
It's right in there.

632
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Whereas this like, oh, we're rotating those first parties in.

633
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I think that's a mistake.

634
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Like, I'm still not interested in this.

635
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Yeah, I got to admit, I'm not still really sold on this idea, especially because I have

636
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,000
the Microsoft one right now that I got that deal with.

637
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:56,000
So I'm not particularly feeling motivated to get this PlayStation one.

638
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
You're right.

639
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:02,000
If they were maybe adding games to it day one or maybe things a little more recent,

640
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
I might be more into it.

641
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Well, most of the thing with Game Pass I'd like to is that you can you don't have to

642
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
well, they don't have streaming for one.

643
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,000
It's you download the game and then you play it.

644
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
And that's that's it.

645
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:18,000
But like I get it, like if you're you know, you can't do that with PlayStation three games

646
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
because it's streaming it.

647
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
It doesn't play PlayStation three games natively anyways.

648
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
So I get that there's that there.

649
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:31,000
But I just don't think, you know, cycling in PlayStation four games, especially first

650
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
party stuff is a good idea.

651
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
I think they should just keep adding to the libraries.

652
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Now, Bobby wants to point out the big thing on this is that you can get it without having

653
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,000
a PlayStation four.

654
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,000
You can play all the games on your PC.

655
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
So that is, you know, because that is cool.

656
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Microsoft has a different list for PC versus Xbox one.

657
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,000
I mean, there's a lot a lot of similar.

658
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Well, true are different, but that's comparing different services.

659
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:59,000
This is basically be like comparing X cloud to this, whereas this is games pass to this.

660
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
So, yeah, I do see an advantage to that.

661
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
That is kind of nice.

662
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:08,000
But still, I don't I'm not really interested right now because there's not anything I would

663
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
want to pay nine ninety nine a month for.

664
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
I have so many damn games in PlayStation anyways.

665
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Yeah, I feel like I'm more interested about how is this going to tie into PlayStation

666
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,000
five?

667
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Like this just kind of feels like, you know, PlayStation four little like, you know, goodbye

668
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
gift or what have you.

669
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,000
But on PlayStation five, I'm really curious to see how Sony is going to, you know, integrate

670
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
something like PlayStation now into PlayStation five.

671
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,000
We'll see.

672
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,000
So.

673
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,000
All right.

674
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Well, let's move on.

675
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Loki.

676
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
Sorry, I was looking up how to fly to.

677
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
What's the closest airport?

678
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
St. Louis.

679
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:50,000
So then you have to go to the Kirksville Regional Airport, which is an hour flight.

680
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Wait.

681
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,000
So you have to fly to St. Louis and then another hour flight to a regional airport.

682
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Yes.

683
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
There isn't just some airport closer.

684
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,000
No, there's not.

685
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Wow.

686
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,000
OK.

687
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Yeah.

688
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,000
And they mentioned below average leg room so that you know, that's going to be a comfortable

689
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
flight to.

690
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,000
That's awesome.

691
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Thanks.

692
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,000
So that's going to be a no for me.

693
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Unfortunately, I will not be flying there anytime soon.

694
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:21,000
So this is a game that I know we've always heard like rumors that, oh, yeah, they're

695
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,000
working on it.

696
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,000
They're working on it.

697
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Bully two and bully two was supposed to be like a planned sequel to the original game.

698
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,000
I know there's always been rumors that like each year, oh, they're going to announce bully

699
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,000
two.

700
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
They're going to announce it.

701
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Apparently, it was something that they did start development on, but it actually ended

702
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,000
development about 18 months later.

703
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:51,000
So they said that sometime between, I guess, 2010, the end of 2013, Rockstar New England

704
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:57,000
spent about a year and 18 months or a year between a year and 18 months working up the

705
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:02,000
concept, but apparently just never really got off the ground.

706
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:11,000
They said they had built a very small vertical slice of the game that was complete, but it

707
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:18,000
was built with the Rage engine, which is being used for Grand Theft Auto IV and V in the

708
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Red Dead Redemption games, but it just never kind of got out of that vertical slice.

709
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:30,000
But probably they found out, hey, we're going to have a lot of money being made.

710
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Actually, what I think happened is you have like Grand Theft Auto V comes out, and they've

711
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:40,000
made so much money off of just the constant updates to the online services and offering

712
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:46,000
different bits of content for that, and then now Red Dead Redemption 2 adding stuff to

713
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
that.

714
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,000
They're making so much money off those that they probably don't need to make a bully two

715
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,000
type of game because the amount of money that they're going to get on return is going to

716
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:01,000
be much smaller than if they just spend time developing more content for those games that

717
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
are already out there.

718
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,000
So that's unfortunate that it's not coming out, although to be honest, I never played the

719
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
original, although I heard it's good, and I have it.

720
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:15,000
I haven't actually gotten around to playing it, so I will have to maybe check that out

721
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,000
someday, but I guess we won't get a sequel.

722
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
I'm kind of surprised it's a Rockstar game you haven't played.

723
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Well, there's that in table tennis, but I haven't played Rockstar.

724
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I haven't played table tennis.

725
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
All right.

726
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:31,000
But anyway, going to some comments from chat, sj100matt says, I don't think it's the right

727
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,000
time for a bully game given the current climate when it comes to cyberbullying.

728
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
So maybe that was part of the reason why they didn't really want to go through with it.

729
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
I don't know.

730
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Rockstar, I'm not really sure, would be one that kind of shy away from that stuff.

731
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:49,000
So I could see them still doing it, but I just think it was less about the ethics of

732
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,000
it and more about we're just not going to make as much money as we can with Grand Theft

733
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Auto 5.

734
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I mean, they're still making money off of Grand Theft Auto 5 and that came out how many

735
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,000
years ago?

736
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Like five years now.

737
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Almost five years.

738
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,000
So I think that, no, actually, no, it was even more than five years ago.

739
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
It was a long time.

740
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Interesting conversation in chat because Bobby Blackwolf says, yet untitled goose game is

741
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
a bestseller.

742
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Untitled goose game is literally about bullying.

743
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:22,000
You are being kind of a little asshole goose that honk.

744
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
And then everybody happened to notice.

745
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Of course, Mr. Smoosh came in here and was doing his own honking.

746
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:32,000
So Dad had to go take care of that and put him in timeout for a little bit.

747
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Yeah.

748
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Yeah.

749
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,000
So.

750
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Oh, well, I guess we just won't get that game.

751
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Pod Culture says I'm waiting for untitled smoosh game.

752
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
You're a cat that disrupts a podcast.

753
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Pretty, pretty, pretty good concept.

754
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Yeah.

755
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Just add that one to the list, I suppose.

756
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,000
All right.

757
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Let's move on.

758
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Let's move on.

759
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,000
Talk about other big projects coming up on Nintendo's side.

760
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Yep.

761
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,000
So one game that we're going to be getting here in probably a couple of weeks here is

762
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Overwatch on the Switch.

763
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:09,000
It is going to be 30 FPS and they have no amiibo support planned for it because why

764
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
would they?

765
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
I mean, they're not going to give away any cosmetics on that.

766
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:20,000
So, yeah, no amiibo support and 30 FPS, which 30 FPS.

767
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,000
I want to say they talked about that before because that's not really a new thing.

768
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Yeah.

769
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
I remember that coming up.

770
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
The hardware.

771
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
So.

772
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
And this is kind of cool, too.

773
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Apparently, Overwatch, the folks behind it, they want to get an Overwatch character into

774
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Smash Brothers.

775
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
So that would be neat.

776
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,000
Didn't the guy like that is like the lead designer on Overwatch pretty much come out

777
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,000
and say like Nintendo, you can have any character you want.

778
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Although I think there was a strong hint that like Tracer would probably be the best

779
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,000
one wink wink nudge because she is kind of like the poster girl for.

780
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
I would say that would be pretty cool.

781
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Yeah.

782
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Actually, Tracer would be kind of a neat concept for a character in Smash Brothers, especially

783
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
the whole like if she plays kind of like she does in the game.

784
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,000
Could be very interesting.

785
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Yeah.

786
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Yeah.

787
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,000
I think I think a character like that would work better than something like, you know,

788
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,000
like Lucio.

789
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,000
And don't take me the wrong way.

790
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
I love Lucio.

791
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
But like, I don't know if like the healing stuff like or mercy, like mercy is not going

792
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,000
to be a great character in Smash Brothers because, you know, they're like more healers

793
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,000
and support, although I don't know.

794
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Now that I'm saying that, like Lucio's boop would be really fun.

795
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
So.

796
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
But mercy, I can't think of a reason why to put mercy in Smash Brothers, unfortunately.

797
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
But Tracer would be really good.

798
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,000
And yeah, Diva would be a lot of fun wrecking ball.

799
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Winston might be a fun one, too.

800
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:41,000
So I do think, though, if and this is a giant if a Blizzard character were to suddenly show

801
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
up in Super Smash Brothers, I do think Tracer just makes the most sense.

802
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Yeah, so.

803
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,000
But we'll see.

804
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
I mean, we know that they're going to continue adding DLC characters.

805
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,000
They've announced there's even more to come.

806
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:56,000
I would think that Nintendo and Sakurai, they've all kind of figured out what that is.

807
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,000
That's already in place.

808
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
So, like, if a Blizzard character is going to be in there, then Blizzard already knows

809
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
about it.

810
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
But anything's possible.

811
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Right.

812
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,000
That's it.

813
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
That's how they're going to get him in there.

814
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:12,000
They've got to put Waluigi into Overwatch and then he can then go into Smash Brothers

815
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
because they're looking.

816
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
That's that's the only way.

817
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,000
S2100 Matt says just not another sword character.

818
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,000
I don't think there are any heroes in Overwatch with a sword.

819
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
But the closest thing I can think of is Reinhardt with the hammer.

820
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,000
But because it kind of kind of performs like a sword.

821
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:33,000
But there is no there's no character with a sword that I can think of.

822
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Interesting, isn't it?

823
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
Because, like, there's like all sorts of other weapons in the game.

824
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
I'm really trying to think.

825
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Like, even the characters you would think would have like a sword.

826
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Brigitte has like the mace type thing that she has.

827
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
I don't think anybody has a sword in Overwatch.

828
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
So maybe an unannounced hero.

829
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
But I don't think there are any sword heroes in Overwatch, strangely enough.

830
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
So.

831
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Oh, I knew you guys would think of it.

832
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Genji.

833
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Genji has swords.

834
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
That's right.

835
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
I don't play Genji, though.

836
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Hanzo.

837
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Hanzo has the bow and arrow, not the sword.

838
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
OK, that's what the sword is.

839
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Genji has it.

840
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
I don't like playing Genji.

841
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
That's why I didn't think of him.

842
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
All right.

843
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Let's move on and talk about an exciting new game, I think.

844
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
I think.

845
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
I think it's exciting.

846
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Coming out on the Switch.

847
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,000
And that's a return of Brain Age.

848
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Haven't you ever asked yourself, what the hell ever happened to Brain Age?

849
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
No.

850
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:22,000
I know I have.

851
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Because those games were huge on the DS.

852
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Not even the 3DS, but the original DS.

853
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
I remember this was a big thing.

854
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
It was like the whole, like, train your brain.

855
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
I'm just surprised that this isn't a mobile game.

856
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Because this should be a mobile game from Nintendo versus, like, a Switch game.

857
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Honestly, a fair counterpoint.

858
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Because I don't really care for that Mario Kart game whatsoever that they just put out.

859
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,000
It's awful.

860
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,000
The Brain Age would make a lot of sense on mobile.

861
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
You're right.

862
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
Why don't they do that?

863
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:53,000
But anyway, well, it is going to happen on the Switch, at least in Japan.

864
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
We don't know anything about the US yet.

865
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
But, you know, it's a possibility.

866
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Anything is, I suppose.

867
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,000
Anyway, Dr. Kawashima's Nintendo Switch brain training.

868
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Dr. Kawashima was that, you know, doctor head you saw in the early games, too.

869
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,000
And I think it's all inspired by a study of his or something.

870
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
I don't know.

871
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
But anyway, the brain training will be coming out for Nintendo Switch.

872
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,000
What's interesting is that you kind of hold the Switch vertically in this one.

873
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:22,000
So it's kind of like how a DS would have looked when it was open, except it's like this screen.

874
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,000
So I kind of like that they're using the Nintendo Switch in a different orientation.

875
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
That's kind of interesting.

876
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:33,000
It's also interesting that there's very distinctly some games where you're taking one of the Joy-Cons off,

877
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,000
which means it's not going to work so well with a Switch Lite.

878
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
And it's also not going to work in the dock?

879
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Yeah.

880
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
So I don't know.

881
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Well, we don't know yet because technically, technically, technically, if you have a Switch Lite,

882
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,000
you can still buy Joy-Cons and use them with the Switch Lite.

883
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,000
There's no reason you can't pair a second pair of Joy-Cons with a Switch Lite.

884
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:57,000
But I know it's a stretch, but technically you could do that.

885
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:01,000
But yeah, I don't think there was anything in the trailer that showed a dock mode.

886
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:08,000
But anyway, there are some screenshots too that show some hands-on brain training that use the infrared camera to show,

887
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
like you actually show fingers.

888
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:14,000
So it'll show on the screen like one plus one, and you have to show like two.

889
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,000
And the infrared camera actually counts how many fingers you're holding up.

890
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:22,000
So it's kind of, it's silly, but it's a neat use of the technology for sure.

891
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,000
And there is versus brain training, which I don't think was a thing originally.

892
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:32,000
Also, there are some written brain training exercises, which obviously is going to be a little difficult,

893
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:37,000
or the difficult thing to translate to English, because that means it's going to be very different between Japanese English.

894
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,000
But anyway, yeah.

895
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
So that's, I think it's kind of neat.

896
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
I don't know.

897
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,000
I hope they do an English version of it, but I'm not going to hold my breath either.

898
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
I don't know how well those games sold over here.

899
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Now Bobby is pointing out that other companies took the Brain Age format and released them to mobile first.

900
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:58,000
It was probably too crowded of a market for Nintendo to devote resources.

901
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:03,000
I get that, but one could argue that many people have ripped off the Mario format.

902
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Many, many people have ripped off the Mario format for mobile,

903
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,000
and that didn't stop Nintendo from trying their own spin on it,

904
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,000
just based on Mario as an intellectual property.

905
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Now does Brain Age hold that same weight as Mario?

906
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Probably not.

907
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,000
So the argument makes a lot more sense in that context,

908
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:23,000
but I think just because somebody else has tried to do it,

909
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,000
doesn't necessarily mean that's going to make Nintendo shy away from doing it.

910
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
And certainly there's been Mario Kart clones as well.

911
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,000
And honestly, many of them are better than what Nintendo released.

912
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
That's sad.

913
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Yeah. Anyway.

914
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
All right.

915
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Let's move on, and ooh, we're already at the classic game of the week.

916
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Holy moly.

917
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
All right, we're to that part of the show where we take a trip down memory lane.

918
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Usually Dark Sakura will step into the gaming vault

919
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,000
and find a game for us that we should look back and reflect on.

920
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
But as we mentioned at the top of the show,

921
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
she had to cancel on the show last minute tonight,

922
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,000
so she is not here tonight, so we've kind of switched her route a little bit.

923
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:01,000
And we have kind of an interesting change tonight.

924
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,000
So who picked the game tonight?

925
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Was it Loki or was it me that picked the game?

926
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
We both picked this game.

927
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
We both agree this should be a classic game of the week, right, Loki?

928
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Sure.

929
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
All right.

930
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
You told me before the show you were fine with it.

931
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
I am fine with it. That's an affirmative.

932
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
All right. Sure.

933
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Sure, Rob. I guess we can pick this game.

934
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:28,000
All right, the classic game of the week is the incredible machine

935
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:33,000
is the classic game that we have picked tonight.

936
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Do you want to tell us some memories about the incredible machine

937
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,000
while I pull up the information about the game?

938
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Yes.

939
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,000
There's a whole series.

940
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:41,000
I remember.

941
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,000
So basically the incredible machine was about making different machines

942
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
to solve different puzzles.

943
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,000
So in this one, you're supposed to get the basketball into the hoop.

944
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
And how do you do that?

945
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Well, you have to power some treadmills using hamster wheels.

946
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,000
And the way you get the hamsters running is you have to startle them with bowling balls.

947
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,000
And there you go. That's puzzle one.

948
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:06,000
And then, of course, you keep progressing through the game.

949
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,000
It gets harder and harder and harder, and then eventually you finish.

950
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:13,000
And then, plus, you can also make your own puzzles, which is a lot of fun as well.

951
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
So, yeah.

952
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
And I know. Was this the. . .

953
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,000
This looks like the 16-color version, or was it the. . .

954
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
No, this is 256.

955
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
I believe this is. . .

956
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
It's the original from 93.

957
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
It's the MS-DOS version from 93.

958
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
But I don't think. . .

959
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
It's more than 16 colors for sure.

960
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
I mean, the game was out in 93.

961
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
We had 256 colors by then.

962
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Yeah. I'm trying to remember.

963
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
But, yeah, I did have the original game.

964
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
I think I even had the sequel.

965
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:42,000
It's spun off into Contraction Maker now, which is pretty cool.

966
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,000
So let's talk a little bit about some of the officials behind this game.

967
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,000
So, of course, we're highlighting specifically the first release in the series tonight,

968
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
The Incredible Machine from 1993,

969
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:55,000
which was formerly abbreviated as T-I-M,

970
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,000
and sometimes pronounced T-EAM, something like that.

971
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Oh, by the way, not to distract from this too much,

972
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:07,000
but Bobby, go ahead and open the pot for the Twitch reward stuff here on stream.

973
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,000
I forgot to mention that beforehand.

974
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,000
But there's a Twitch Prime thing going on right now,

975
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:16,000
so if you want to donate, you can actually throw in some things in the pot there

976
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000
to actually give away to viewers here.

977
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:23,000
And I know I'll be donating some of mine here as soon as it's opened up.

978
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
And there we go. Awesome.

979
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,000
So the community gift test is open, and you can actually contribute to that.

980
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,000
And, yeah, we're going to give away some of that stuff here in just a little bit.

981
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
So I see folks adding away to that right now.

982
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Unfortunately, apparently, am I not logged in on this machine?

983
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
What the hell? Why don't I see the thing where I can...

984
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Oh, there it goes. Now I got it.

985
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Gift more.

986
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Sorry, I'm distracting here from this whole thing.

987
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,000
All right, anyway.

988
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:50,000
So The Incredible Machine, back on topic.

989
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Sorry, it was a very important live announcement there,

990
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:53,000
because I meant to do that earlier.

991
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:56,000
The game was designed and coded by Kevin Ryan,

992
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,000
and it was produced by Geoff Tunnell,

993
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:03,000
which was part of the now-defunct Geoff Tunnell Productions.

994
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
The game was published by Dynamix,

995
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,000
which I know made some of those big early 90s games.

996
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,000
The same development team was behind the 93 and 95 versions,

997
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
but later on there were more versions of the game.

998
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
I mean, this was a whole series,

999
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,000
so later on the ones in the 2000 and beyond had different designers.

1000
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,000
All of the games were published by Sierra.

1001
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,000
And then, where is the IP rights with this now?

1002
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,000
As of now, the rights are held by the Walt Disney Company,

1003
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
because, of course, Disney's bought everything.

1004
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
But Geoff Tunnell announced, of course,

1005
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Contraption Maker was the spiritual successor to this.

1006
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:40,000
That was in 2013, and Steam, Windows, OS X,

1007
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
all saw a release of that on July 7th, 2014.

1008
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
But what is The Incredible Machine,

1009
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,000
especially for those in the podcast feed

1010
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
that can't see the video right now?

1011
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
What you're doing in this game is you're making a series of,

1012
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,000
have you ever heard of, like, Rube Goldberg devices?

1013
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Okay, that's like the classic board game Mouse Trap, right?

1014
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
The marble goes down here,

1015
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,000
and then it sets off this diver that dives into the thing,

1016
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,000
and then the vibration causes the mouse trap to fall,

1017
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
like all these different things, right?

1018
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
That's those Rube Goldberg devices.

1019
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
If you see those disgusting-ass saw movies,

1020
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,000
a lot of the traps in those movies

1021
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
are based off that whole type of thing as well.

1022
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
So what you're doing is you're building

1023
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
your own types of machines like this.

1024
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Oh, an OK Go video.

1025
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,000
You're making your own OK Go music video.

1026
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,000
That's another good way to put it.

1027
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,000
So, you know, you might have to, for example, say,

1028
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
in this one you're trying to build, get a basketball

1029
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:32,000
onto a cage to make the hamster move in the cage.

1030
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
It's a mouse, apparently.

1031
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,000
But you're gonna do it through a series of trampolines.

1032
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
So you have to put all the trampolines.

1033
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
So you get a limited number of items,

1034
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,000
and you have to lay out those items in a way

1035
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:47,000
that makes sense to cause the contraption to work.

1036
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Kind of an educational game in some ways, if you think about it.

1037
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I remember playing this when I was younger,

1038
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,000
and it was an interesting kind of learning and logic type of way.

1039
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:59,000
You can also change things like air pressure and gravity,

1040
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
because those puzzles got really hard

1041
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,000
when you started fucking with things like gravity.

1042
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:06,000
So there were many, many versions of the incredible machine.

1043
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
I mean, there were just, I think there was, like,

1044
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
at least what, I'm looking at a list here,

1045
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten games

1046
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
in the main series if you want to count.

1047
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,000
Well, we're counting the iPad version in 2011.

1048
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
So, yeah, I know.

1049
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,000
So anyway, but, yeah, the incredible machine

1050
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,000
was made on a $36,000 budget.

1051
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Had about 160 levels, and it got a great reception.

1052
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
There was a lot of praise,

1053
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,000
and you could make your own machines as well,

1054
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
and I think that was the mode that got a lot of people

1055
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
to love it as well.

1056
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,000
So, yeah, the incredible machine by Sierra,

1057
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
our pick for Classic Game of the Week this week.

1058
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:45,000
It was all about torturing the cats.

1059
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
No, don't torture the cat.

1060
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
Like, I realize sometimes the cats are assholes,

1061
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
but you don't torture them.

1062
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
That's what we used to do.

1063
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Shame on you.

1064
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,000
I used to put them on.

1065
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,000
I used to put cats on the trampolines.

1066
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Gosh.

1067
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
And have them jump around, and then they would hit,

1068
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,000
like, something.

1069
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
They'd bounce around the trampolines.

1070
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
The cats didn't like the trampolines.

1071
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,000
So anyway, looking in chat, let's see.

1072
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Questbuster's saying, yay, incredible machine.

1073
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Let's see.

1074
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
SG100Matt says Disney owns it.

1075
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Sounds about right.

1076
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
And, yeah, some folks really into this Classic Game of the Week.

1077
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
A lot of people thinking this hasn't been picked yet.

1078
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Yeah, somehow this one.

1079
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
I think we've talked about picking it,

1080
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
and it's come up on the show before,

1081
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,000
but when we had to do a last minute substitute tonight,

1082
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
it definitely came to mind, like, oh, yeah,

1083
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
we kept talking about that we were going to do that

1084
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
as a Classic Game of the Week at some point.

1085
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
So there it is, the incredible machine,

1086
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,000
your classic game of the week.

1087
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,000
Okay, so I think you guys have contributed

1088
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,000
to the community chest.

1089
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
So Bobby, why don't you hit the button,

1090
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
and let's begin the holidays.

1091
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Let's begin Christmas a little early,

1092
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
and we're going to give away some of those gifts

1093
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
to folks in chat.

1094
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
12 gifts tonight.

1095
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Wow.

1096
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,000
That's going to be pretty good.

1097
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
We don't have a huge live turnout tonight.

1098
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,000
It's under 30, and I've seen it go as high as mid-40s.

1099
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
So that'll still be really cool.

1100
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Oh, there they go.

1101
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,000
They just all went out.

1102
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:07,000
So a World of Tanks care package was the prize tonight.

1103
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:08,000
And there they go.

1104
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
They just all got doled out right there in the chat room.

1105
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
So enjoy that, you guys.

1106
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Cool.

1107
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
All right.

1108
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Thank you to everybody who donated gifts.

1109
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
I thought I donated gifts to the treasure chest tonight.

1110
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Did I not?

1111
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Gosh darn it.

1112
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Oh, well.

1113
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,000
I guess I'll have to do it again in a future week.

1114
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Oh, well.

1115
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
But yeah, we're going to try to keep doing that here.

1116
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
I know the first week they did those chests,

1117
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
we left it open the entire show.

1118
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
But it kind of made the chat work funky,

1119
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
and it was a little weird.

1120
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,000
So I think it's better to just do it during one segment.

1121
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
And in that way, it kind of keeps you listening.

1122
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,000
For those of you that are looking

1123
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
for the free giveaways, right?

1124
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Metal Mayhem, you like the free stuff, right?

1125
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
So it kind of keeps you listening,

1126
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
and then we'll just give it away at some point.

1127
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
So maybe usually during the Classic Game of the Week

1128
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,000
or something like that.

1129
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,000
So cool.

1130
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Act F says, LOL, VoG Network, want a gift?

1131
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Yeah, because technically VoG Network

1132
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
doesn't have a Prime account.

1133
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:00,000
So I wish there was a way you could opt out of it

1134
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,000
so that we don't win.

1135
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
We'll have to look into that for a future week.

1136
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
I don't know.

1137
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Anyway.

1138
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,000
All right, let's move on.

1139
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
We're going to get into some rapid fire news

1140
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
and talk about some things going on in the industry.

1141
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Well, we talked about earlier games

1142
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
that aren't coming from Rockstar Games

1143
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,000
anytime soon.

1144
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Well, we do have one that is coming from Rockstar Games soon.

1145
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
It's actually already been out.

1146
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Red Dead Redemption 2 is now coming out on PC.

1147
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:29,000
It is going to be out on the Epic Games Store first,

1148
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:32,000
but fear not, it is not a long time.

1149
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
It is just actually a few weeks.

1150
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:38,000
So they have the PC version coming out on November 5th.

1151
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
At that time, it's also going to be out

1152
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,000
on some other platforms as well.

1153
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:47,000
But the Steam version will be coming later on.

1154
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Looks like, yeah.

1155
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,000
So you can get it now.

1156
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,000
I guess, yeah, the 23rd.

1157
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:58,000
It'll be available on Green Man Gaming,

1158
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Humble Store, and Epic Games Store.

1159
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
And then, of course, December.

1160
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
A little bit later, it'll be coming to that.

1161
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
And then Google Stadia is going to be getting it

1162
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
when that launches.

1163
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
So more ways to play Red Dead Redemption.

1164
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
No, that's a big deal because apparently

1165
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,000
everybody has been waiting for a Red Dead Redemption game

1166
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,000
to come out on PC.

1167
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,000
So we can mod the shit out of it.

1168
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Exactly. Exactly why.

1169
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
And so apparently, though,

1170
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,000
and I am totally going to buy it again on PC,

1171
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,000
because I didn't like some of the survival elements

1172
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
that were on the actual version of the game,

1173
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,000
and thank God for mods.

1174
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
We'll fix all of that, and it'll be nice.

1175
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Plus, then I'll be able to spawn a car or a tank in the game,

1176
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,000
because that's exactly what I want to do,

1177
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,000
is a tank in the old west.

1178
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,000
I just want to spawn horses that fall from the sky.

1179
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Absolutely.

1180
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
So, yes, you'll be able to pre-purchase the game,

1181
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
apparently starting October 9th,

1182
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,000
exclusively on Rockstar's game launcher,

1183
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
through the October 22nd.

1184
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
And then they had a limited time offer

1185
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:04,000
where you get two free Rockstar PC games titles

1186
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
for free if you do that.

1187
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,000
So Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, San Andreas,

1188
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Bully, Scholarship Edition,

1189
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
L.A. Noire, the Complete Edition,

1190
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,000
or Max Payne 3, the Complete Edition, as well.

1191
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,000
And then, I guess, premium editions as well are available,

1192
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,000
and then you get a bunch of, like, bullshit,

1193
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,000
like 50 gold bars for Reddit Online.

1194
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
You know the deal with these premium things.

1195
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
It's just, it's bullshit.

1196
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,000
Just remember mods.

1197
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,000
So it doesn't matter.

1198
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,000
You know, I don't need the Warhorse for story mode,

1199
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:34,000
because I can mod that shit in there when it comes out.

1200
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
Yeah, so that's gonna be a thing,

1201
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
and that's kind of exciting.

1202
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:41,000
So looking forward to that later this month.

1203
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,000
And then, a game I am sad I did not get to play today,

1204
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
because I would have had the opportunity to play it,

1205
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:51,000
but they finally announced that Iron Man VR

1206
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
is gonna be coming out on PlayStation VR

1207
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,000
February 28th, 2020.

1208
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
So sad I didn't.

1209
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
I missed it today, the demo.

1210
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
It looks pretty awesome.

1211
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
So yeah, I am looking forward to that.

1212
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,000
$40 if you want to get the standard edition,

1213
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
and they have digital deluxe edition

1214
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
with some more armor skins,

1215
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
which honestly is just fucking skins.

1216
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
They're just repainting the skins,

1217
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:15,000
and who gives a shit?

1218
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
So, standard edition all the way.

1219
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Iron Man fans might give a shit.

1220
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:20,000
No, it's seriously, like,

1221
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:23,000
it's not even like that they changed the armor at all.

1222
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
It's literally just changing the colors

1223
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
of the pieces of armor.

1224
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Yeah, I have to admit,

1225
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
I'm looking at it, it's not that great.

1226
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
It's all the same.

1227
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,000
So they didn't even like,

1228
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:33,000
because they said,

1229
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:36,000
oh yeah, you can get the original armor custom deco,

1230
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
but it's just, it's all silver,

1231
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
you know, or the vintage armor.

1232
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,000
It's just, it's just repainted.

1233
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Who cares?

1234
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
All right.

1235
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
All right, let's move on.

1236
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
I mentioned we talk about Atari.

1237
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Yes.

1238
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,000
So here's the deal with Atari.

1239
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
So of course the Atari VCS console

1240
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
is planning to launch in March 2020,

1241
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,000
and just announced this week,

1242
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:00,000
a partnership with Antstream Arcade.

1243
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,000
So the streaming service, right,

1244
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,000
online that, disclaimer,

1245
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
I was a Kickstarter backer for.

1246
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
So not a lot of people in the US can play it right now

1247
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
because it's only out in Europe right now.

1248
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,000
They still haven't launched officially

1249
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:12,000
in other territories.

1250
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
But if you're a Kickstarter backer, you have it.

1251
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
So, you know, and I do,

1252
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
I actually went in there to start looking for ideas

1253
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,000
for the classic game of the week,

1254
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
although I ended up picking something outside of that.

1255
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,000
But yeah, I still do check out Antstream once in a while

1256
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
because they are still adding new things.

1257
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
So what's up with the partnership with Atari?

1258
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Well, Atari, of course, the Atari VCS

1259
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
is going to come out for $250.

1260
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
It's going to be a Linux-based game console.

1261
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,000
It can play a lot of retro games.

1262
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
And the partnership with Antstream Arcade

1263
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
is going to have an enhanced and exclusive

1264
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Atari edition of Antstream's streaming service

1265
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:46,000
to the Atari VCS gaming system.

1266
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
So the exclusive Atari edition of Antstream Arcade

1267
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
will have an instantly accessible collection

1268
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
of classic video game titles,

1269
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,000
including the original library of 2000-plus games.

1270
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:59,000
There's going to be extra Atari games available on demand.

1271
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,000
So I have to admit, it's a little disappointing to me

1272
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
as an Antstream person, the Kickstarter thing,

1273
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,000
that we're not really getting all those Atari games

1274
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
in the regular version of Antstream.

1275
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
I am hearing, though, to be fair,

1276
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:14,000
that I guess Atari is going to be having one game a month,

1277
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,000
ooh, that goes to the main Antstream service.

1278
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
So there'll be a very, very slow trickle.

1279
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
I just hope they're not crap Atari games.

1280
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Like, let us have the good stuff.

1281
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
But then again, I mean, maybe, you know,

1282
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
a lot of the really, really good Atari stuff,

1283
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
quite honestly, were Activision games anyway.

1284
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Like, a lot of the best games on the Atari 2600,

1285
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
like Pitfall and, you know, things like that,

1286
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:35,000
they were Activision games.

1287
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
So who knows how that's all going to work out.

1288
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:40,000
But anyway, there will be at least one game a month

1289
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,000
that happens on the regular app.

1290
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,000
But the biggest chunk of that is going to be on the Atari VCS app,

1291
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000
where you get all the different Atari games that'll be there.

1292
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,000
And of course, there'll be a 30-day free trial after that.

1293
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,000
You can subscribe for $10 a month or $8 a month

1294
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,000
if you do a yearly subscription.

1295
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:03,000
50 classic Atari titles at launch for new Atari VCS users.

1296
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
So, interesting.

1297
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
So does that mean that they're not going to have, like,

1298
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,000
because I thought the whole point was that they're going to offer,

1299
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,000
like, those classic games on the Atari system.

1300
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:14,000
So now they're not.

1301
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
They're just part of that streaming service.

1302
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
Is that the kind of, like, way, like, yeah, we're kind of lazy.

1303
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
They haven't said.

1304
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,000
We don't know.

1305
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,000
We don't know what it is.

1306
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
We don't know if it's the Antstream thing.

1307
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:28,000
It's six months away from launch, and we don't know what the fuck it is.

1308
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Yeah, that's great.

1309
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,000
All right.

1310
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Bobby also pointing out that Antstream has recently released the save states.

1311
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Just came to the system, which is good.

1312
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Yeah, especially considering it's all streaming.

1313
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
That's really cool.

1314
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Also, for rapid-fire news on my end,

1315
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:46,000
the Death Stranding soundtrack is a thing.

1316
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,000
That is something that is happening.

1317
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
There's going to be an official soundtrack to Death Stranding.

1318
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,000
The first song came out.

1319
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
It's a Church's song.

1320
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,000
I like the band Church's.

1321
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,000
I don't know about you guys, but it's a really good song.

1322
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,000
I can't play it for you now because I don't want to get muted on Twitch,

1323
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:03,000
but it's really easy to find if you just go to YouTube and type Church's death.

1324
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:07,000
Don't forget they do that hipster spelling where it's a V instead of a U.

1325
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,000
But even if you just type Church's Death Stranding, you're going to find it.

1326
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
And it is a really good song.

1327
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
Like, it's just a really good Church's song.

1328
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
So, you know how sometimes the soundtrack songs are a little bit like,

1329
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,000
like, they're not as good as those.

1330
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Like exclusive to.

1331
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Yeah, it's exclusive to the gate.

1332
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
It's a song called Death Stranding, if I'm not mistaken.

1333
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,000
So, yeah, really cool.

1334
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,000
I want the trailer music.

1335
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
So I want to find those tracks.

1336
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:34,000
That might be in the actual soundtrack because there is a soundtrack that's coming out called Timefall,

1337
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
original music from the world of Death Stranding.

1338
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Cool.

1339
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:44,000
I have to admit, I'm getting more and more interested in Death Stranding now that we're actually seeing gameplay.

1340
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,000
And, you know, I got to admit, a good soundtrack will sell me on something.

1341
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:51,000
I went and saw David Lynch's Lost Highway based on the soundtrack.

1342
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
And it was, and it hurt my brain.

1343
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,000
I saw Lost Highway in the theaters.

1344
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
That's probably the most hipster thing I'm going to say all night.

1345
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:03,000
So, but it was really based on the strong soundtrack.

1346
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:08,000
And Bobby says it's songs inspired by the world of Death Stranding.

1347
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:12,000
The Church's song totally sounds like a credit song, though, to me.

1348
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,000
I mean, it may or may not be, but it totally sounds like a credit song, though.

1349
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:19,000
And Bobby says, I felt like I was playing Forza Horizon.

1350
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
That's when I hear Church's.

1351
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Oh, yeah, I forget that Church's is on the soundtrack to Forza Horizon as well.

1352
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
So, pretty cool.

1353
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Mish is in chat saying, I love Church's.

1354
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Yeah, me too.

1355
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Oh, Bobby says, Kojima did say the Church's song is the end credits.

1356
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Perfect, because that's what it sounds like to me.

1357
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
But it's a good song.

1358
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Check it out.

1359
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,000
So, and yeah, it's songs inspired by.

1360
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
And that's sometimes movie soundtracks, too.

1361
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Like the Mortal Kombat soundtrack, wasn't that all songs inspired by?

1362
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
It's music from and inspired by the film.

1363
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Yeah, and they have three hacker soundtracks.

1364
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Most of those were inspired by the movie.

1365
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000
It is that.

1366
01:19:55,000 --> 01:20:01,000
So, this is not an unheard of thing for the video gaming world to do as well.

1367
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Didn't No Man's Sky have a soundtrack and it was like a procedurally generated soundtrack, too?

1368
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,000
No.

1369
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
It was all inspired by?

1370
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,000
I don't think they have that.

1371
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,000
I thought that was a thing.

1372
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
There is a No Man's Sky soundtrack, I know that.

1373
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Probably.

1374
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Yeah.

1375
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,000
A lot of it's by one band, though, so.

1376
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Alright, we have some more rapid fire news.

1377
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Yes.

1378
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Which, by the way, these were the things Dark Soccer was going to talk about.

1379
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:26,000
She just texted saying, tell everyone I'm high AF and I love them.

1380
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:33,000
She doesn't mean, she means legal things, not, well, I guess technically that's all legal in California as well now, too.

1381
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:38,000
But she said she was taking medication for her sickness, so.

1382
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Okay.

1383
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
I'm just passing along the message.

1384
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
She might be watching.

1385
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Alright, anyways.

1386
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:55,000
So, one Untitled Goose Game is looking to get ported over to the Playstation and Xbox and possibly mobile platforms, according to the developer House House.

1387
01:20:55,000 --> 01:21:02,000
They basically are, you know, as far as the mobile port goes, they said, we're still chewing on this.

1388
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:07,000
It'll take a lot of design work to make a version that works good for touch controls.

1389
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:13,000
But the other, the other platforms would be a lot more easier to port over to.

1390
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:17,000
This seems to be that indie hit of the year.

1391
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Like, you know, along the lines of, honestly, like a Minecraft or a Five Nights at Freddy's or like one of those, like, indie games that everybody is talking about.

1392
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Untitled Goose Game is like that for this year.

1393
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:34,000
I definitely foresee game awards at the end of the year for this game.

1394
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Not necessarily maybe like game of the year, but I think a lot of like indie reward type things are going to become in the way of this game.

1395
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,000
And now, this next story was very much a Jamie thing.

1396
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Yes, this is very much a Jamie thing.

1397
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:49,000
So, they're talking about the reboot of Cotton.

1398
01:21:49,000 --> 01:22:03,000
So, they have a few different modes that they announced for the Cotton reboot, including the X68000 original mode, which is apparently a faithful port of the original Cotton game.

1399
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:07,000
For the Sharp X68000.

1400
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:16,000
And then they have a range mode, which supports the 16 by 9 aspect ratio and updated graphics.

1401
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:25,000
And then, of course, they have the voice cast and background music composers kind of announced as well.

1402
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:29,000
So, I don't know half of these people, but actually, I don't know all of these people.

1403
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:40,000
But, yeah, it looks like a pretty decent sized set of people that they have composing music and doing voice acting on it.

1404
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:43,000
I'm sure if Jamie was here reading this story, she would give us a squeak.

1405
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Because I know she loves Cotton. She loves it.

1406
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:47,000
So, the fact that they're rebooting it, I know she's going to be annoyed.

1407
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:53,000
It's due out. PlayStation 4, Switch, and PC via Steam on 2020 in Japan.

1408
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:56,000
So, you know, you'll probably be able to get it here too.

1409
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Well, I mean, yeah, PlayStation 4 and Switch are region free, so you'll be able to play it here if you want.

1410
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,000
And Steam, I would think you could play it.

1411
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Oh, yeah, of course Steam, yeah. So, neat.

1412
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Alright, let's move on and go around the world and check out some release dates.

1413
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:13,000
We're going to see what's coming out on a store shelf near you this week.

1414
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Yeah, we're in the thick of it now.

1415
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:22,000
So, this week we've got Alliance Live HD Remaster on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4.

1416
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Here's a game that you might like, Rob. Burger Time Party on Nintendo Switch.

1417
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Concrete Genie on PlayStation 4. That was a pretty neat looking game.

1418
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Trine 4, The Nightmare Prince on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1419
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Indivisible on PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1420
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:49,000
And then Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1421
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,000
We had Corpse Party, Blood Drive on PC and Switch.

1422
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:58,000
River City Melee Mach on PC, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 4.

1423
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:05,000
Spirit Hunter NG on PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and some system called the Vita.

1424
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:12,000
We have Doraemon's Story of Seasons on PC and Nintendo Switch.

1425
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Frostpunk coming to consoles on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1426
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Grid, not to be confused with the original Grid, this is a remake or a new game in the Grid series that they're calling Grid now.

1427
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:27,000
On PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.

1428
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:32,000
And Killer Queen Black on PC and Nintendo Switch.

1429
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
That's it.

1430
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Alright, traveling over to Japan. Not quite as busy of a week.

1431
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:45,000
A lot of the things you mentioned are also out in Japan this week, including the Alliance Live HD Remastered, Trine 4, The Nightmare Prince, Concrete Genie.

1432
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:49,000
All of those on the PlayStation 4. That's really it on the PlayStation 4.

1433
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Going to the Nintendo Switch, kind of similar.

1434
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:58,000
There's a new Nintendo Switch Tsum Tsum version that's coming out.

1435
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Yeah, I know, it's kind of neat if you're into that.

1436
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
Alliance Live on the Switch as well.

1437
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Ark of Alchemist for Nintendo Switch.

1438
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,000
This is a little bit of a big deal. I would love to see this happen in the US.

1439
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Yokai Watch 1, now the Switch version.

1440
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:17,000
I think we talked about this a little bit last week, but they are remaking Yokai Watch, the original for the Nintendo Switch.

1441
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
But as far as we know, this is only in Japan.

1442
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:22,000
But this series is very big in Japan, so they're getting their release of it this next week.

1443
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Wouldn't be surprised if we see that port over here.

1444
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Yeah, I hope so. I would like to give Yokai Watch another try, so we'll see.

1445
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:32,000
And then Trine 4 also out on the Nintendo Switch.

1446
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:36,000
So that is what Japan's release schedule looks like this week.

1447
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:40,000
VidPower573 in chat says, there's a new BurgerTime game.

1448
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Yeah, there is.

1449
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
BurgerTime Party.

1450
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Does it still play like the arcade?

1451
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
I think it's a party game.

1452
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Interesting, okay.

1453
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
I would assume based on the title.

1454
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:59,000
But I know we talked about it before on another one of the podcasts.

1455
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:04,000
But I don't remember what the difference was with it.

1456
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
I was just going to take a look real quick.

1457
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:10,000
When I hear BurgerTime Party, it makes me think of that.

1458
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:16,000
What was the one game we were talking about the other day with the other games?

1459
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:21,000
I can't remember. But it looks interesting.

1460
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Yeah, I don't know. It looks like they've updated their game.

1461
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
I only sound like that one little trailer.

1462
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
It looks like it plays like BurgerTime.

1463
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
But it's like multiplayer. I think that's why they call it Party.

1464
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:35,000
It's multiplayer, and it's definitely updated graphics.

1465
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:39,000
See, this is the type of thing that I would think would work with the Amico.

1466
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Because it's four player, it's single screen, it fits the formula.

1467
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,000
Let me sidebar a little bit here. Because it didn't make tonight's show roll.

1468
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:51,000
But I definitely saw it on our Discord server.

1469
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
And somebody had posted it there.

1470
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:57,000
Which, you know, cheap plug for our Discord over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

1471
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,000
V-O-G network.

1472
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:04,000
And then, actually, in a way, I kind of like it when Bobby and us pick completely different stories.

1473
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:08,000
But I'm going to talk about it anyway, because I want to know Loki's opinion.

1474
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Bobby talked about it on his show, the Intellivision, what was it?

1475
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Ten game design principles or something like that?

1476
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:19,000
It's the Ten Commandments, basically, but for the Amico.

1477
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Yes, and I was trying to bring that up real quick.

1478
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Yeah, you were actually bringing up the list so you could read them.

1479
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Thou shalt not.

1480
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
That's fine. We're running a little ahead on time tonight.

1481
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:31,000
So, the Ten Commandments of game design, they say.

1482
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:35,000
This is, I think, mainly pertaining to the Intellivision, obviously.

1483
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Every game must be rated E or E10+.

1484
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:43,000
So, no violence or sex. Well, what fun is that?

1485
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:47,000
No Leisure Suit Larry on the Intellivision.

1486
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:50,000
At least not a very good version of Leisure Suit Larry.

1487
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Family friendly. All right, fine. Family friendly.

1488
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Leisure Suit Larry, a guy who actually sells Leisure Suits, yeah.

1489
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Yes, just like Al Bundy was just a shoe salesman.

1490
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
That's it. The game is just selling shoes.

1491
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:08,000
All right. Every game must be easily playable without the need for complicated or long instructions.

1492
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Number three. Every game must be balanced to allow players with very different ability levels to still have fun.

1493
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,000
There's a lot of room for interpretation with that one.

1494
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Every game must rate 7 out of 10 or above on Intellivision's quality control scale.

1495
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:32,000
What the fuck is that? Like, what is that? What are even the criteria of that?

1496
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Every game must cost less than $10. Every game must support the official Intellivision controllers.

1497
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
I would hope so, yeah.

1498
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:45,000
I mean, like, I'm sorry. You can't play the game with this controller that comes with the system.

1499
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Well, let's back up because weren't you supposed to be able to use your cell phone as a controller and isn't it going to be...

1500
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,000
But it's optional, though.

1501
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Wasn't Bluetooth with existing controllers a thing? Like, correct me if I'm wrong. I feel like that was a thing.

1502
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,000
Yeah.

1503
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Okay, but they want to say that, like, you can't just say, oh, a PlayStation 4 controller will work.

1504
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:05,000
You have to integrate with the official Intellivision controller in some way.

1505
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Yes.

1506
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Again, as much as it sounds like a commandment or whatever, I kind of feel like, well, this is actually a rule on Sony's side, on Microsoft's side, even Nintendo's side.

1507
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Like, this isn't exactly, like, a new thing.

1508
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Yeah. Every, let's see here, every game, this is number seven, every game must be 2D or 2.5D, 3D models, okay, but no free roaming 3D worlds.

1509
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:35,000
I don't know about that.

1510
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Well, I'm sure a lot of this has to do with, and Bobby talked about it on his show a little bit, the technical limitations of, you know, the Amico.

1511
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:47,000
But let that be up to the developers that figure out what the technical limitations are.

1512
01:29:47,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Well, here's my question. Like, I, believe it or not, I kind of get where this is going because I know, you know, I put myself back in the shoes of the day when Zelda first came out on Nintendo 64, even Mario 64.

1513
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:05,000
I was kind of, like, put off by it at first because I was, like, this is weird.

1514
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:10,000
This isn't the type of game that I was, like, looking to play. I want something like Mario World or Yoshi Island or something.

1515
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Like, where's that type of game? I don't want all these 3D things.

1516
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:20,000
And I think there were a lot of other gamers, maybe in a certain age range, I don't know, like me, that maybe felt that way at first.

1517
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Now, I've come around on 3D games since then. Like, I have a lot of love for things like, you know, Elder Scrolls.

1518
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:29,000
I love Breath of the Wild if you want to go back to Zelda and so forth.

1519
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:36,000
But I also understand there may be a technical limitation. But here's where I start to get, like, question-y. It's, like, well, what about, like, a racing game?

1520
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:42,000
I mean, a racing game, yes, could be on a track, but what about, like, an open world racing game?

1521
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Yeah, or, like, there might be a technical limitation, too, that I'm just not thinking of.

1522
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:52,000
And, like, what are we calling, like, a 3D game? Because, like, let's imagine a 3D world, okay, or they're saying 2.5D.

1523
01:30:52,000 --> 01:31:01,000
Like, a game like Gauntlet Legends, okay, which I would think, I guess you can kind of say that's 2.5D, but that could easily be a multiplayer game.

1524
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:07,000
It's 3D, though, but you're going to say no to that because, I mean...

1525
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Okay, Bobby says, specifically says, Gauntlet is 2.5D and it's perfect.

1526
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:20,000
But, like, what if I wanted to make something like Gauntlet but in 3D? Like, I don't understand. It's, like, I think it's a dumb move.

1527
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:33,000
I actually don't think I see your point, Loki, because I think it's pretty well accepted that, like, a game like Gauntlet, or let's say this new Zelda reimagining, like, Link's Awakening, is, like, a perfect type of, like, what a 2.5D game should be.

1528
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:41,000
I actually think Gauntlet in a full 3D space would look like Wolfenstein 3D and it would be terrible. Like, it's not really a Gauntlet game at that point.

1529
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:47,000
So, like, I got a needle back on that one. I don't think you need to make a game like Gauntlet 3D.

1530
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:58,000
I don't know. Every game must be an Intellivision exclusive. Even ports must be unique in some way. Wolf, the report, they're not exclusive. I'm sorry. I don't even count that.

1531
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:01,000
No in-game purchasing or DLC.

1532
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Now, you gotta like that one. A lot of people are very excited about that one.

1533
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:13,000
I guess. That's fine. Every game must incorporate local multiplayer, couch, co-op, or versus mode.

1534
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:22,000
And there's your Ten Commandments. I think they should have teen rated games in there, honestly.

1535
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:29,000
It makes the goal of this system very clear. This is for family game night. Period.

1536
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:38,000
That is the type of system that Tommy and company want to make. And, you know, there are some things in here that are gonna really turn off the big developers.

1537
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:46,000
Like, Activision and EA, they're not gonna develop for this thing. That whole rule on DLC, they're not gonna be able to get the Frostbite engine running on this thing.

1538
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:53,000
So, they're not gonna make games for Intellivision. Intellivision is really going to be powered by independent developers.

1539
01:32:53,000 --> 01:33:01,000
So, you know, there's a lot of great indie games out there. Something like Untitled Goose Game would meet all of these conditions, right?

1540
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
No, it wouldn't. It's a 3D game.

1541
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:07,000
I wouldn't technically go under the 2.5D rule.

1542
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:08,000
No, it's a 3D game.

1543
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:19,000
I would say it's 2.5D. You might be thinking in the programmer sense that it's rendered in 3D or things like that, but I say Untitled Goose Game is 2.5D and would fit.

1544
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:22,000
There's depth to it. It's not on rails or anything.

1545
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,000
Bobby agrees with me. It's 2.5.

1546
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:31,000
It is not 2.5D. If that's the case, then the only way you're saying that's 2.5D is based on where the camera's placed.

1547
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
Because the camera's placed overhead.

1548
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:37,000
In my opinion, you're being too technical. That's why you're not...

1549
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:42,000
But I have to look at it like that because that's the thing. It's like, whatever. You know what? That's fine.

1550
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:49,000
I'm just curious to see what games come out on this because if they restrict it too much, they're not gonna get good games on it, I think.

1551
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
But we'll have to wait and see.

1552
01:33:52,000 --> 01:34:03,000
I don't necessarily hate these commandments, but it does definitely draw some hard lines in a box for Intellivision, and I think it's kind of a risky thing.

1553
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:09,000
And to me, there's a lot in here that does seem, and I hate to do this because I know a lot of people are saying this about Intellivision,

1554
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:17,000
but there's a lot in here that really is reminiscent of the Ouya in some ways, but the Ouya didn't have Tommy Tallarico.

1555
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:22,000
I do think there are some things about gaming that Tommy understands very well.

1556
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Heck, my husband and I met at a Video Games Live concert, so I suppose I owe Tommy that of some sort.

1557
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:37,000
But I still think that it's boxed away a little bit, but there's something about it where I'm just kind of like,

1558
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:40,000
you know what? If anybody's gonna pull this off, I think it's gonna be this group.

1559
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:43,000
But it really is going to depend on the strength of the games.

1560
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:50,000
So, okay, you showed us the rules. We've seen glimpses, frames of some of these games, but like, you know,

1561
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:55,000
and I understand this console is still over a year out, right? Or almost a year out.

1562
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:58,000
By the time some of you hear this, it'll be a year out because it's 10, 10, 20, right?

1563
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:03,000
So, that's why we haven't really seen the games yet, but in the coming months, and as we start to move into 2020,

1564
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:09,000
we really need to see the games because that, I mean, rules be damned. If the games suck, they suck.

1565
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:16,000
If the games are great, which there can be great games that follow these rules, and I would say Untitled Goose Game is one of them.

1566
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Although, well, I will say where Untitled Goose Game fails is that you can't do a port. You have to do your own game.

1567
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:25,000
And I don't think Goose Game has the multiplayer or any of that stuff.

1568
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:32,000
But games like it could still stand to do very well on television. Television could still have a breakout indie hit.

1569
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:36,000
So, we'll see. We'll see. It's gonna really depend on the strength of those games.

1570
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:43,000
All right. Anyway, that wasn't technically on the show roll, but it was worth discussing just because I think it is something that people are bringing up this week.

1571
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:53,000
So, all right. Anyhow, let's talk about, and Bobby says it's their implementation of the Nintendo seal of quality. Interesting.

1572
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:57,000
No, I get that, but like they say, it has a score of 7 out of 10 based on what criteria?

1573
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Well, we don't know yet, but I assume we're going to as we hear about more about what games are going to be on it.

1574
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:10,000
I would imagine it would be things like, you know, crashes and, you know, just how it runs and things like that. We'll see.

1575
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Can we talk about UK release dates?

1576
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:17,000
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. I thought you were doing, I thought that's when we got on the Intellivision tangent. I'm sorry. Go ahead.

1577
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:25,000
No, we didn't. We got a whole different tangent. So, UK. We've got Call of Cthulhu. That's coming out on Nintendo Switch.

1578
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch.

1579
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:35,000
Grid is coming out on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1580
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:41,000
They have a World of Warcraft 15th Anniversary Collector's Edition coming out on PC.

1581
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Trine 4 out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.

1582
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:51,000
They also have a Trine Ultimate Collection on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch.

1583
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Concrete Genia on PlayStation 4. Frostpunk on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1584
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:01,000
Indivisible on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

1585
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:04,000
This is going to be a tough one.

1586
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Eternio Blade, that's on PlayStation 4 and Switch.

1587
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:15,000
VR Ping Pong Pro on PlayStation 4.

1588
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:21,000
And then we have, looks like, I'm sorry, the one I read before, Grid Ultimate Edition.

1589
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:26,000
Now we have just the regular edition of Grid coming out on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

1590
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Northgard on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Switch. And that's it.

1591
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:39,000
All right. Let's go to the mailbag. Every week we invite your emails at participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

1592
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:45,000
And we read our favorites here on the show and discuss whatever questions you guys might bring up.

1593
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:50,000
We have one email tonight, and tonight's email is from Robert M., who asks,

1594
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:58,000
With Microsoft putting out a dual monitor surface, could Square put out a real The World Ends With You remaster?

1595
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:01,000
That's it. That's the tweet. That's the email this week from Robert M.

1596
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:05,000
If you want to email us a question, participate at orangeloungeradio.com.

1597
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:09,000
So, did you see this whole thing with the new Microsoft device, the two screen thing?

1598
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:14,000
I just saw the pictures. I didn't see the whole, you know, I saw the tweets basically because, you know, I was busy with work.

1599
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:17,000
But I was catching up a little bit and I saw some of the tweets of the device.

1600
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:21,000
It is, it's finally that foldable phone a lot of people were talking about.

1601
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:22,000
Well, it's not.

1602
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,000
Or that idea is not phone, but you know.

1603
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:26,000
It's not because it's basically two different screens.

1604
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:31,000
They don't have it, like, it's not one continuous screen like the foldable phones, which I hear the foldable phones.

1605
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Still very fragile and breaking after, you know, a much shorter period of time than they said they would break.

1606
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:41,000
It's a neat idea, I guess.

1607
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:44,000
I don't know about like the two screens on there.

1608
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
One laptop I saw that looked pretty cool.

1609
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:51,000
They have one that actually has like the keyboard kind of towards the bottom of the unit.

1610
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:57,000
And then there's like a half screen in between, like kind of there to use for like utility.

1611
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:00,000
You know, could be like touch screen buttons or something like that.

1612
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:01,000
That's kind of cool.

1613
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:05,000
I don't know necessarily if I'd need that screen real estate on.

1614
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:06,000
I don't know.

1615
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Maybe I like having three screens at home to work on things.

1616
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:16,000
But like with the Surface, I don't know.

1617
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
I need to use my Surface more.

1618
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:24,000
I think to answer the question in the email, quite frankly, about the whole world ends with you remake.

1619
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Square can do whatever the fuck they want.

1620
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Quite frankly, that's my that's my honest answer is that can they do it?

1621
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Sure, if they want to.

1622
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
Will they?

1623
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
I don't know if they'll go back and revisit that game.

1624
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:39,000
I don't know how well it sold on the Switch.

1625
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:42,000
I don't feel like it was as much of a powerhouse as it was on the DS.

1626
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:45,000
But I feel like that game might have done OK on tablets and things like that.

1627
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
So who knows?

1628
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:50,000
But I would imagine they have to go back and repurpose some things.

1629
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:55,000
So I would think that enough of these devices have to sell for Square to be able to say,

1630
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:59,000
Oh, there is you know what? How many potential sales could we get?

1631
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:02,000
How many devices are there are out there?

1632
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:07,000
So I kind of feel like that hurdle has to be crossed first before a company like Square is going to say,

1633
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Oh, and we're going to make this get we're going to put these resources.

1634
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Yes, the game's already made, but you still have to adapt it for this resolution.

1635
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:19,000
And, you know, the confines of this system and, you know, whatever other challenges there are,

1636
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:26,000
it's not just as easy as, you know, oh, select recompile and to phone to screen Microsoft device.

1637
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:29,000
You can't do that. You have to actually go in and tweak a whole lot more than that.

1638
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,000
That's going to take resources.

1639
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:36,000
So the question is, is it going to sell enough to recoup for those resources now?

1640
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:41,000
And with Microsoft also like do Microsoft devices sell very well in Japan?

1641
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:46,000
No. And so I think that's another reason that Square probably not high on their list.

1642
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:50,000
But if, you know, 10 billion of these things sell, OK, they're not really going to sell that many.

1643
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:54,000
But even if several million of these things sold, then, you know, maybe they'll evaluate that.

1644
01:40:54,000 --> 01:41:00,000
I mean, shit, we poke fun at the OUYA, but Square did put Final Fantasy three on the OUYA.

1645
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:05,000
And a lot of that was based on because everybody was talking about the console at that time

1646
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:10,000
and they saw the potential for sales to be very large for that device.

1647
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
And I think they were building it for Android anyway.

1648
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:17,000
And I think putting something on OUYA that you had done for an Android was pretty easy.

1649
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
And the resources were very minimal.

1650
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:24,000
But I think designing for the two-screen Microsoft device is going to be a little more challenging.

1651
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:30,000
And I don't see Square jumping on board unless enough devices exist to make it worth their while.

1652
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:33,000
So let's see.

1653
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:36,000
Looking in chat, TigerClaw is saying, I got a dual screen setup.

1654
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:40,000
I also heard that Loki also got a 144 hertz monitor.

1655
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Once you go 144, you can never go back to 60. Is this a thing?

1656
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:48,000
Yeah. I had one of my monitors die, so I bought a new one that's 144.

1657
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:53,000
And then I saw a nicer one that was cheaper, like, literally the day after I bought mine.

1658
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Oh, well. I'll wait for the other one to die.

1659
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:01,000
I have an interesting setup at my new job because I have two monitors at my new job.

1660
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:04,000
And one of them is a gigantic monitor, and I love it.

1661
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Like, the resolution. Oh, my God. Like, I can do so much on that monitor.

1662
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:12,000
And then I have kind of, like, the crappy Square monitor, my second monitor.

1663
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:17,000
And it's kind of like, oh, it's like watching the movie Twins with Schwarzenegger and DeVito.

1664
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:20,000
It's like, one of these monitors is very good.

1665
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:24,000
But it's a great email and instant message monitor.

1666
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:27,000
Like, my email and instant message is over there while I'm designing my documents and stuff.

1667
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:33,000
Right, exactly. So that's why I have, like, I made my main monitor, the 144, so I can play games on it if I want.

1668
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:36,000
But I don't really use it a lot for, like, gaming too much anymore.

1669
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:40,000
I just, like, I don't know. It's nice to have it because it's also brighter.

1670
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:44,000
So, like, I usually do web browsing on it so I can see everything, like, stands out much more.

1671
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Plus, I had a problem with some of the games and even just, like, YouTube videos and stuff that it would smear.

1672
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:56,000
Like, it was just very, like, it was not a very high quality monitor, the first one.

1673
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:00,000
And the 144 one is much nicer. I get it. It's not the best panel out there.

1674
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
But I wasn't trying to get a really good monitor.

1675
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:06,000
I was just trying to get a cheap monitor that happened to be just something quickly I could replace.

1676
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
That right balance between money and quality.

1677
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:12,000
Yeah, exactly. Just something cheap that I wanted to replace the old one with so that I had a new monitor.

1678
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:15,000
I want to remind everybody, we don't make money off this show.

1679
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:18,000
I mean, yes, yes, you're very kind to give your biddies and your subs and things,

1680
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:22,000
but they're not going to pay for Loki to have a $500 monitor.

1681
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:29,000
They're going to pay for mic stands and, you know, small festival scholarships.

1682
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:34,000
So we can get the name of our shows out there more. So, um, you know, we don't, we don't pocket money.

1683
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:37,000
I think it's safe to say we don't pocket money off these shows.

1684
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:40,000
So Loki and myself still have to think about the budget.

1685
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:45,000
Yeah. All right. So it worked out. It was nice. It's nicer than the one I had.

1686
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
All right, let's move on. We have some more stories to get to,

1687
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:52,000
and then we're going to open up our discord for your calls over at vognetwork.com slash discord.

1688
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
But we do have some stories for you first, Loki.

1689
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:58,000
So you may remember there was a lawsuit between Randy Pitchford

1690
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:08,000
and his company's former lawyer, Wade Callender, that apparently they have now dismissed.

1691
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:13,000
And this is becoming, they said, because they've resolved all claims between them.

1692
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:19,000
And upon review of the, all of the evidence in the case, it was the opinion of counsel.

1693
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:23,000
The evidence exonerated Randy Pitchford from the allegations against him.

1694
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:27,000
All misunderstandings between parties have been corrected and we apologize,

1695
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:33,000
or the apologies were exchanged because the parties are mutually bound by confidentiality.

1696
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:36,000
No additional statements will be forthcoming.

1697
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:41,000
So the lawsuit ended the way they always do. It was settled and there's a gag order.

1698
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:45,000
That's it. You don't get to find out the finer details of what really happened.

1699
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Exactly.

1700
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Just that you probably won't be hearing about this ever again.

1701
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Yes. For now.

1702
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
For now. All right.

1703
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Moving on, talking about PlayStation 4 cross-play.

1704
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
Officially out of beta.

1705
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:06,000
So yeah, this week Sony has announced that the cross-play feature is out of beta.

1706
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:09,000
Now the publisher actually, they didn't make an official announcement about this.

1707
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:13,000
This announcement kind of came through like Wired was like doing an interview with them.

1708
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:17,000
But kind of interesting that Sony didn't exactly want to blow the lid off of this.

1709
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:20,000
But maybe because people, you know, they still are trying to really push that message

1710
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
like Sony is the place to play and all that stuff.

1711
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:27,000
But this is really great. So now more games will have that cross-play at least available.

1712
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
It doesn't mean every game is going to do it.

1713
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Like I don't think Overwatch is suddenly going to have cross-play like we were hoping.

1714
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
But you never know. Never say never.

1715
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:37,000
Maybe more things like Elder Scrolls Legends.

1716
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Bethesda said they weren't going to put it on Sony's platform until this issue was resolved.

1717
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
Well, it's resolved.

1718
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:48,000
Oh no! We couldn't get Elder Scrolls Legends on the platform? Oh darn!

1719
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Nothing of value is lost.

1720
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:55,000
I'm giving you one example.

1721
01:45:55,000 --> 01:46:01,000
That's basically Elder Scrolls Legends is the developer version of that to the players.

1722
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:07,000
It's just like, hey, you want a new Elder Scrolls game? Here's some shit for you.

1723
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Anyway, Sony, of course, doing this in advance of the next round of consoles.

1724
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Supporting cross-play is going to be very interesting in this as we go into, you know,

1725
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:24,000
Microsoft having their own console, Nintendo bringing people back to the Switch and so forth.

1726
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:28,000
So it's nice to hear that this is out of beta at this point.

1727
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:32,000
SSG100Matt replied to your little Loki with, or excuse me, your little rant there,

1728
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:36,000
Loki with Sheesh and the salty multi-con several times.

1729
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:39,000
There's no salt at all. The game's crap.

1730
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:40,000
It's just not a good game.

1731
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
It's just not a good game. You know, whatever.

1732
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Yeah. All right.

1733
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:47,000
I'm over it. I mean, I wasn't even like interested in playing it.

1734
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:52,000
Well, let's move from salt to crack. Let's talk about drugs.

1735
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Okay, maybe not specifically drugs, but apparently some people say video games are like drugs, right?

1736
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Yes. According to a legal notice filed in Quebec,

1737
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:07,000
on the behalf of two children who became so devoted to the game Fortnite,

1738
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:14,000
that they said that it triggered release of reward neurotransmitter dopamine.

1739
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:17,000
Really anything you can be addicted to, but whatever.

1740
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:22,000
They said the addiction to Fortnite has real consequences of the lives of the players.

1741
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Several don't eat or shower and no longer socialize.

1742
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:30,000
Adding that players have been forced to seek treatment for their addiction.

1743
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:38,000
But the question, where are the parents? Because seriously, like it's kids.

1744
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
So where are the fucking parents?

1745
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:45,000
You said it very on the nose early on, and I don't give you credit for that.

1746
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:50,000
Let's file a lawsuit instead, because then that means I don't have to take responsibility for them.

1747
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:53,000
It's the game makers who should take responsibility for my kids.

1748
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:56,000
You can be addicted to just about anything. That's it.

1749
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
It's not the game makers fault.

1750
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:02,000
And I don't want to make light of addiction issues or addictive personalities or things like that,

1751
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
because that is very serious.

1752
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:08,000
And I hope they're able to get treatment and work through that and so forth.

1753
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:11,000
So I'm not going to make fun of the kids. I wouldn't do that anyway.

1754
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:15,000
But I think it is fair to say, where are the parents?

1755
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:20,000
And I think it's also fair to say this is not the game makers problem that this happens.

1756
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Because if it wasn't this, it would probably have been a different game or something else.

1757
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:28,000
It doesn't really specify, like they said there's game mechanics designed to make,

1758
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:31,000
I think they're talking about the loot boxes.

1759
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Although I don't think Fortnite really has loot boxes like that.

1760
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:39,000
But they're saying that it's likened to how gamblers get hooked on slot machines.

1761
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:43,000
The argument is very weak, but let's just say, for example,

1762
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:47,000
it was they were addicted to getting the skins or loot in the game.

1763
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:50,000
Who's providing them with the money for that? The parents.

1764
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:58,000
I mean, if they don't eat or shower for a long time, who's responsible for that? The parents.

1765
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:05,000
If I wasn't doing that stuff as a kid, my mother, she'd always threatened to take the cord, right?

1766
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:11,000
If she couldn't figure out the cord, I swear to God, she would go out and turn the master power off to the house if she had to,

1767
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
to get me to stop playing those games.

1768
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:16,000
So that is what, you know, there is some responsibility.

1769
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
There's so many things that the parents could do here.

1770
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:23,000
Epic has money, everybody talks about Fortnite, so that's why.

1771
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:28,000
You know, in one way, I'm a little relieved to hear this isn't just a problem in America.

1772
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
Now it's Canada's problem too.

1773
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:34,000
These types of lawsuits. Silly, silly.

1774
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:39,000
Yeah, they said the Quebec Superior Court could spend up a year deliberating on whether a class action can proceed.

1775
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:42,000
I don't think so. That's stupid.

1776
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:49,000
And honestly, the reason why I think it's stupid is because if we're going to make this argument that this game is addictive,

1777
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:53,000
therefore they're responsible for everybody, then you can make the argument about all games.

1778
01:49:53,000 --> 01:50:00,000
And it's just, this is not, I get it, you want to pick battles in the gaming industry, this is not the battle to pick.

1779
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
Pick the battle with the loot boxes and shit.

1780
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
That's the battle that you want to pick.

1781
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:07,000
But like saying, oh well this game is good so they're addicted to it.

1782
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:14,000
You know, I just don't see this as a problem.

1783
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Just parents intervene. Seriously.

1784
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:22,000
I don't understand why this is a problem.

1785
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
Well it's a parent problem.

1786
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
It is a parent problem.

1787
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:30,000
But you would be surprised. There's a lot of parents out there that just don't know how to parent.

1788
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:38,000
But honestly, if my kids were addicted to a certain game, and my son, he's really into Roblox, but guess what?

1789
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:42,000
He can't buy anything in Roblox if I don't give him money to spend in Roblox.

1790
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Bobby Blackwolf in chat says, yeah, but nowadays kids can play Fortnite on their cell phone even when the power is still out.

1791
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:49,000
So it's so hard.

1792
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:52,000
Who the fuck is buying them a goddamn cell phone?

1793
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:55,000
Who's paying for that cell phone? It's not them.

1794
01:50:55,000 --> 01:51:01,000
I think the question was asked with the tongue in the cheek, but I mean, if you want to ask the question real, then yes.

1795
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:02,000
Take away the fucking phone.

1796
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
Yeah, who bought them the phone? Take away the phone.

1797
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:10,000
Let's just say hypothetically that they're like 16 or something like that and they have a job and they're paying for their own phone.

1798
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
They bought their own phone or something like that.

1799
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:15,000
Like, fuck dude.

1800
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:19,000
Well they won't be having a job for very long if they're not showering and not doing anything.

1801
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:22,000
Not socializing with people and all they're doing is playing Fortnite.

1802
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:25,000
And so like that will solve itself right there.

1803
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:29,000
But like, ah, parents are dumb.

1804
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:30,000
Sometimes.

1805
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:37,000
SHO 100 Matt with an interesting perspective, saying my girlfriend is a fifth grade teacher and a lot of her students are Fortnite players.

1806
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:40,000
Many of her students' parents have different tactics to limit screen time.

1807
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:49,000
The kids who play until 5 a.m. are obsessed like the kids in the suit have parents who are not at home at all times because of different situations.

1808
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:56,000
Well, I mean, you've got to, to what priority is raising the kid then?

1809
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:01,000
If you're going to rely on Epic Games to raise your kid, then is it really their fault?

1810
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
Like, I don't know.

1811
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:11,000
There are things you can do like just saying, well, I can't, you know, then don't give them the computer when they're at home.

1812
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:15,000
Or you can set up, you know, options in your router to where you shut off.

1813
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,000
Like you can do it based on Mac address or something.

1814
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:22,000
Shut off the internet to that device during this time period.

1815
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:26,000
I mean, there's so many things you can do just giving up and saying, well, I'm not home because I got to work.

1816
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
I'm sorry.

1817
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:36,000
That's how your children become crackheads and fucking gang, gang bangers because, well, I guess they were not going to because they're playing Fortnite all the time.

1818
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:43,000
So they're never going to go outside and socialize with gang members or do crack because they're not going to have any money because they're too busy.

1819
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
Fortnite keeps your kids off crack.

1820
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
At least I want you to be thankful for that.

1821
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
Fortnite kept your kid off crack.

1822
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
Yeah, that's what they should say.

1823
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
It's like cocaine.

1824
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Well, at least they're not on real cocaine.

1825
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
Have you thought about that?

1826
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
Oh, I never thought about that.

1827
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
I guess it isn't such a bad thing.

1828
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:05,000
It's like things as they were in the 80s haven't changed.

1829
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:14,000
It's just instead of kids going off alone to the park without needing parental guidance, now they're meeting strangers online through online games even though the parent might be around.

1830
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:22,000
You know, I'm 41 and I was meeting strangers online when I was 13, but I wouldn't really get to meet them in person because my parents would have never.

1831
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:25,000
Oh, my mom was convinced everybody I was talking to online was going to kill me.

1832
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Like think about all the things that are worse for kids to be doing.

1833
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:36,000
You could still talk to people online through BBSs and stuff. It wasn't as easy as it is now.

1834
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Like, are they doing drugs? Are they causing violence in the real world? Are they going around fucking people?

1835
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:46,000
I mean, no, they're not doing all those things. They're playing a game. Then fucking lay off of it.

1836
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:50,000
Or if you really have a problem with it, parent. I don't understand the problem here.

1837
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
Alright, let's move on.

1838
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:55,000
This is stupid.

1839
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:58,000
Moving on to the next story. Loki, you have another story for us.

1840
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:05,000
So Rocket League, and I guess Epic Games by part, they're trying to let you know, hey, we're the good guys.

1841
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:10,000
We're getting rid of loot boxes and instead now you're going to get blueprints.

1842
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:16,000
Blueprints, they're different than loot boxes, but not. Sort of.

1843
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:23,000
Because apparently you get blueprints at the end of matches and they're unlocked with keys that you have to pay for real money for.

1844
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:29,000
But at least you'll know what they're for. And that's how it's different because it's not a surprise.

1845
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:34,000
They still have to open them with a key. Sounds like Counter-Strike.

1846
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:42,000
Whatever. I guess that's slightly better. But they really want us to praise them because they did the right thing.

1847
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:46,000
Good job.

1848
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:59,000
Alright, moving on into news that is a little bit sadder. We lost Kirby this week. That's right, Kirby passed away.

1849
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:08,000
I'm not talking about that cute little pink thing in Nintendo's series of video games, but I am talking about the namesake for Kirby in those Nintendo games.

1850
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:20,000
John Kirby was an actual lawyer who represented Nintendo in the company's 1984 legal case about Donkey Kong and the lawsuit versus King Kong.

1851
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:28,000
I don't know if you knew that, but back in the 80s, Universal tried to sue Nintendo saying Donkey Kong is too much like King Kong because they climbed buildings.

1852
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:37,000
So anyway, John Kirby, who was a lawyer, helped Nintendo win that case and that's why we still have Donkey Kong and it's gone on all these years.

1853
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:46,000
So Kirby ended up with a franchise named after him, basically. So yeah, John Kirby was the namesake for the actual Kirby character.

1854
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:53,000
But unfortunately, John Kirby did pass away on October 2nd from a form of blood cancer, so that's sad to hear that.

1855
01:55:53,000 --> 01:56:01,000
You can read the full obituary in the New York Times and you can hear about some of the other legal things that John Kirby had worked with.

1856
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:11,000
But rest in peace, that is always sad to hear. I want to say, didn't we lose the namesake for Mario recently too? I thought that was something kind of recent as well.

1857
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:21,000
Anyway, Bobby's pointing out in chat that we also lost Rip Taylor today. There's been several celebrities this week, hasn't there?

1858
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:32,000
Rip Taylor. I remember seeing the reruns of, what was it called, the $1.98 beauty pageant. It was like the Gong Show, but it was more like a beauty pageant type of thing.

1859
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:40,000
And he was on the 80s Hollywood Squares that was on USA Network all the time. So yeah, rest in peace.

1860
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
Hanging confetti.

1861
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:50,000
Yeah, Darticuia says that was last week. I don't think it was last week, but I think it was last month. Yeah, the landlord for Nintendo's original office. That's right, it was Mario and that.

1862
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:59,000
Anyway, moving on. I think that's all we have for our officially slated news articles tonight.

1863
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:08,000
So we're going to open up our Discord for calls. If you want to call into the show tonight, you can join our green room over at vognetwork.com slash Discord.

1864
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:15,000
We'll be taking calls from our green room here if you want to join in and talk about anything we have talked about tonight or maybe something different.

1865
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:23,000
While we wait to see if any calls come in, you can also ask questions in chat if you want. You can say anything you want in the chat, well, within reason.

1866
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:31,000
You can ask anything or say anything you want in chat there and we'll bring that up in studio if it necessitates that.

1867
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
But otherwise, do we have any last minute stories you want to talk about tonight?

1868
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
No.

1869
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:48,000
It was a little bit of a slower news week, all things considered, so I think that's why we've kind of blown through the news pretty fast tonight because some of these stories like, wow, Gearbox and the lawyers settled out of court. There you go. I guess it's worth bringing up. There's not a lot else to say about it, right?

1870
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:56,000
Yeah, I mean, I don't know. There wasn't really much that went on this week. I worked on my game some more.

1871
01:57:56,000 --> 01:58:03,000
Bobby wants us to argue more about 2.5D as indeed a 3D game world with a fixed camera angle, but I don't want to keep fighting.

1872
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Like 2.5D, I get that, you know, I know what it is and like, I think, but like, okay, let's not even go like 2.5D, but like I'm on board with what you're saying, but like a racing game or something like that, like Rad Racer.

1873
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:25,000
I mean, technically it's like a 2D game, but like say a more 3D, let's say like Sega Rally or Daytona or something like that.

1874
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
Yes, Daytona for Intellivision.

1875
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:40,000
There you go. Like I'm down with that, but like, see that, that's something like I could totally see as like a, like a game that would be available on that, but you can't because it's 3D.

1876
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:51,000
So, I mean, unless it's like simulated 2D, like we're talking like Outrun or the simulated 3D, like Outrun or something like that, you know, maybe then they could do it.

1877
01:58:51,000 --> 01:59:01,000
So like, I really want to see what games they have because like, I got to be honest, like the trailer that they showed off, I wasn't like, Ooh, I got to get this.

1878
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:07,000
I was like, Ooh, that looks like pretty generic shit, but like I need to see what the games are.

1879
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:14,000
Not to say that they couldn't do anything good because there's a lot of like really good indie games that are like couch co-op games that I could see would be pretty fun.

1880
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:20,000
Well, let's see. Bobby Black Wolf says, I haven't seen Tommy being asked about Daytona or Pole Position.

1881
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:24,000
Well, I'm going to do some investigative journalism right now.

1882
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:30,000
Tommy, Tommy, does that, does that count? Well, Pole Position was a 2D game, so.

1883
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:39,000
And I mean, really, when you think about it, aren't all the games 2D anyways, because they're on a screen, it's just really how it's being rendered.

1884
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:47,000
I mean, let's, my games aren't jumping out of the screen, so everything's 2D. All's fair game.

1885
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:55,000
You have to keep talking because I'm tweeting. Oh, OK. Does a racing game like Daytona meet the Intellivision Commandments?

1886
01:59:56,000 --> 02:00:02,000
Because it's kinda 3D, but not.

1887
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:09,000
I don't know. It should. But it's a racing game.

1888
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:15,000
Well, we'll have to, we'll have to do Ivan Ironman, Stewart's, you know, Super Off-Road or something like that.

1889
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:19,000
Why can't there be 3D exploration?

1890
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:23,000
Good luck with launch. OK.

1891
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:31,000
There's the tweet. Does a racing game like Daytona meet the Intellivision Commandments? Because it's kinda 3D, but it's a racing game now.

1892
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:36,000
Oh, see, I had a typo. I'm glad, I'm glad I proof read with you all live on there.

1893
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:40,000
Not 3D exploration. Thank you. Good luck with launch.

1894
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
See, I was even polite at the end there.

1895
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:45,000
There we go. We're gonna ask some damn questions.

1896
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:53,000
All right. Go like it. So, go like the tweet so it bumps up on his feed because he probably gets a lot of tweets.

1897
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:59,000
All right. I still don't see anybody in the green room, but let me see some of the questions in chat.

1898
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:03,000
Prince Brightstar says, Shovel Knight is technically a 3D game even though it looks 2D.

1899
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:09,000
And I think that, I think it's more about how it really looks than how it's necessarily developed behind the scenes.

1900
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:12,000
Because isn't that the thing? It's in one of those engines like Unity or something.

1901
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:16,000
Like even a 2D game in Unity is actually a 3D game, but it's just like the camera is up top.

1902
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:19,000
It's on a 2D playing field, right? Isn't that a thing? Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK.

1903
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
Let me, the physics and everything.

1904
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:26,000
Like, I'm not gonna profess to be an expert game developer, but I've picked up little pieces over the years.

1905
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:32,000
That's the only one that I see as a problem for me is that, that commandment. The rest are fine.

1906
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:37,000
It's just limiting it to 2D. I get it if your hardware can't run it or if,

1907
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:44,000
but like the fact that you say, well, it can't be this because I can't think of any way that you can accomplish the other commandments.

1908
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Just because you haven't thought of something doesn't mean it's not possible.

1909
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:51,000
And I don't think you should limit your developers based on that.

1910
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:57,000
I get the intent of it, but I think that he's wrong. That's all I'm saying.

1911
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:01,000
I think that there's, I think unlike the Ten Commandments from God,

1912
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:06,000
I feel like the Ten Commandments from Talarico have a little bit of room for negotiation.

1913
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:12,000
You know what I mean? Like, I feel like anything can kind of violate these rules if it's good enough.

1914
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:15,000
You know what I mean? Like, I just, you know what I mean?

1915
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:18,000
I feel like there's room for negotiation where it's like thou shall not kill.

1916
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:21,000
Probably not a lot of negotiation with something like that.

1917
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:24,000
But I feel like the Talarico Commandments, you know, anyway.

1918
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:29,000
All right. Let's move on. Oh, I thought I saw someone in the green room, but they disappeared.

1919
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
All right. They got shy. Who knows?

1920
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:35,000
All right. We'll give it just a couple more minutes to see if anybody pops in there and then we'll wrap up shop here.

1921
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:40,000
Let's see. Bobby does point out the games are still being developed. That's true.

1922
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:43,000
I mean, we'll know better, like, what all this means.

1923
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:47,000
Again, when we actually see more of the game footage beyond just frames.

1924
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:50,000
But you know what? I'll give them this.

1925
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:55,000
We've talked about that Amico way more than we've talked about what Atari's doing,

1926
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:58,000
what Coleco's doing, or what a lot of other...

1927
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
Coleco's not doing anything.

1928
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:04,000
But I can tell you right now that the Atari system is giving me...

1929
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:08,000
Well, I mean, but now we have the Anstream thing going on.

1930
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:12,000
But I, you know, I kind of think, like, Anstream can kind of stand on its own.

1931
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:13,000
It's going to be on, like, everything, isn't it?

1932
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:17,000
Yeah. Well, it's on PC. It's on Xbox. You know, it's important, right?

1933
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
So, yeah.

1934
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:23,000
Kaijuta says, Tommy Talarico is making games for the flat earth believers.

1935
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
Come on now.

1936
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:28,000
Come on. You don't have to be like that.

1937
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:33,000
But, like, I'd like to say, like, Star Fox or something like that.

1938
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
Would that work? Because that's 3D.

1939
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
What if it's multiplayer?

1940
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:40,000
I feel like we need to have Tommy on the show.

1941
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:46,000
And we just need to present, like, we'll have our PowerPoint presentation up on the wall.

1942
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:50,000
What about Super Mario 64? So you're saying I can make Super Mario Kart.

1943
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:53,000
What about this one? What about this one, Tommy? Is this me?

1944
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:54,000
What about this one?

1945
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:55,000
No, no, no. I'm sorry.

1946
02:03:55,000 --> 02:04:01,000
What about Super Mario Kart 64? So I can't make Super Mario Kart 64, but I can make Super Mario Kart, because that's okay.

1947
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:05,000
Okay, Bobby says most YouTubers are actually doing that to Tommy.

1948
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
They're going, what about this, this, this?

1949
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
But are they actually asking him?

1950
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:14,000
See, I'm going to say that to our credit here at OLR, at least I fucking asked.

1951
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:17,000
Like, he may or may not respond. He's a busy guy.

1952
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
At least I tried asking.

1953
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:22,000
Shouting into the void on YouTube isn't going to cut it.

1954
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
You have to at least try.

1955
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:27,000
Oh, he says yes, he's going on those YouTube channels.

1956
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:32,000
God, that man will take any publicity where he can get it. Good for him. Good for him.

1957
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:35,000
I actually, I actually take that as a sign of, like, that's a good thing.

1958
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:41,000
Like, like, if you're the type of person, like, you believe in your products so much, like, no channel is too big or too small.

1959
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:44,000
Like, I actually think that's a big selling point, so.

1960
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:47,000
So I'm back on the show. No channel is too big or too small.

1961
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:51,000
Open fucking invite. Come on over, Tommy. I'll move Pikachu for you.

1962
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:55,000
Come on over. We can get it. I don't expect Tommy to come into Sacramento, California.

1963
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:59,000
So I would happily interview Tommy over the Skype or whatever you guys want to do.

1964
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:02,000
So. Oh, Bobby says it's my turn.

1965
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:05,000
Sure, the night y'all are gone. Yeah, we're not going to be funny enough.

1966
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
Oh, how about this? How about this, Bobby?

1967
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
Look, look. We're all setting up for you.

1968
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:14,000
The show we're not going to be here is October 20th this year.

1969
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:17,000
One year out. Start playing. You could get them that night.

1970
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:21,000
You could get them that night. Why not? We'll probably record something earlier in the week, but I don't care.

1971
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:24,000
You can bump us back to seven o'clock. If you're going to ask what?

1972
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:27,000
If you ask about Daytona, you can bump us back to seven.

1973
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:33,000
All right. All right, let's go to the phones.

1974
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
I see the person that was trying to get in earlier is there now.

1975
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:38,000
So let's go to the phones. Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio. Who's this?

1976
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:42,000
This is Jim Sally calling in on the show, guy.

1977
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:46,000
Hey, Jim Sally. Good to hear from you again. What is on your mind, my friend?

1978
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:51,000
You too, man. Let's talk about this Intellivision debacle.

1979
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
Let's talk. Oh, you think it's a debacle?

1980
02:05:53,000 --> 02:06:01,000
Well, everyone's getting so excited about it, but the people are correct, man. They got to keep this shit simple and eloquent.

1981
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:05,000
What do you mean by the people are correct? Do you mean the Intellivision people are correct?

1982
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:08,000
The Intellivision people, they're all over it. They're geniuses.

1983
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:16,000
I think we should definitely divert some of the money that we spend on the military and just give it to them to give us, you know, our simple games back.

1984
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:22,000
Jim Sally, that's easy for you to... Wait a minute, Jim Sally. Hold on. I'm dragging you, exposing you live on air.

1985
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:26,000
You're Canadian. You can't tell us how to spend our military money.

1986
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:32,000
Listen, I'm telling you, we don't have very much military over here. We always have.

1987
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:43,000
We have dope for everybody and some really conscientious video game designers, man, who make the greatest little video, mini video games for you.

1988
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:54,000
You know what's eloquent in my family, man? I have a lot of people that can't speak English, can't use a cell phone, can't do an auto check out at the grocery store.

1989
02:06:54,000 --> 02:07:02,000
These motherfuckers come to my house and say, Johnny, go get the wee bowl. Go get the wee bowl.

1990
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:09,000
They come upstairs and, you know, they bowl a turkey and they do that chicken dance, you know, and then the three-year-old comes up and does the same thing.

1991
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:17,000
That's game, man. That's a good game, man. And those are the games that, to me, show true game design, that you're able to design that.

1992
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:23,000
Everything else is fireworks and razzmatazz, you know?

1993
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:29,000
You know what? You raise a damn good point in what you're saying there about the whole fact.

1994
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:32,000
You mentioned that you have a lot of family members who don't speak English.

1995
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:42,000
And I've said this about Intellivision before is that this is the type of console I could see doing very well in international markets and other parts of the world.

1996
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:54,000
You know, when we talk about things like PlayStation, Xbox, and so forth, you know, yes, those things are pretty easy to find in the US, Canada, Japan, and most European territories.

1997
02:07:54,000 --> 02:08:07,000
But outside of that, when you start to go to places like, say, South America or Africa, which you know are pretty big places, but it's not as easy to find things necessarily like the Xbox or Nintendo.

1998
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:12,000
Now, some of them have a presence. I don't want to say, like, they're just not in those countries because, you know, I do believe in Brazil.

1999
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:18,000
I want to say Nintendo has a presence. I might be wrong with that. But I'm going to say you can all find exceptions, I'm sure.

2000
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:23,000
But we can all agree there are many places in the world that don't have the most cutting-edge video games.

2001
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:35,000
In fact, actually, since I mentioned Brazil, you know, I think we've often kind of had a funny haha about, oh, Brazil, they're still playing the Master System or the Sega Genesis in places like Brazil.

2002
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:47,000
But maybe it's not such a haha thing because the reality is they're behind a little bit in consoles because the current stuff is way too damn expensive to import into.

2003
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:51,000
Brazil is a fucking large place. There are a lot of people that live there, you know what I mean?

2004
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:55,000
So, sorry, I don't mean to take too much of your time selling.

2005
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:59,000
There's a lot of people that live there, but there's not a lot of discretionary income there either, my friend.

2006
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
I've been there a lot.

2007
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:02,000
Well, but when every-

2008
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:05,000
I can tell you this from personal experience, it is not exactly-

2009
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:15,000
But when every game is under $10, then that kind of shows that you're aiming towards something a little like, you know, for folks with a lower budget.

2010
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:26,000
We played a lot of Super Mario Brothers 3.

2011
02:09:26,000 --> 02:09:37,000
Because I think you're cutting out for us a little bit, Jim Salley, but I know with a game like Super Mario Brothers 3, a good game like that will last forever.

2012
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:40,000
By the way, Loki, what was that? That was a racing game that just went by on that.

2013
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:43,000
By the way, Loki, what was that? That was a racing game that just went by on that.

2014
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:46,000
I see you analyzing the Intellivision trailer. That was a racing game that just went by, wasn't it?

2015
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,000
So looking for games that aren't 2.5D.

2016
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:53,000
But it looked like a- that looked more like an Iron Man, or no, what was the fucking-

2017
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:54,000
Super Sprint.

2018
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:57,000
Super Sprint. It looked like a Super Sprint type of game. Yeah, that looks like a Super Sprint game.

2019
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Ish-esque. Not necessarily an actual Super Sprint game.

2020
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:05,000
And that's like an Echo the Dolphin-esque game. Actually, that probably is Echo the Dolphin.

2021
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:14,000
Well, Jim Salley, if you're still with us, I don't know, the internet might be acting a little funky, but Jim Salley, if you're still with us, like, is the Intellivision, I mean, you seem to be kind of on board with this.

2022
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:17,000
Do you think this is a console you're gonna end up buying?

2023
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:23,000
Oh, yeah, I'll definitely get it immediately. Only because, again, we have the various family members.

2024
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:33,000
And personally, I'm a very skilled video game player, and I feel, you know, I can never really unleash my fury on people when I try to play with them at all.

2025
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:42,000
But if it's something as dumb as, you know, Pong, let's get it on. Let's get it on, man.

2026
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:48,000
You know what? But the right twist on Pong can still make a game like Pong fun.

2027
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:55,000
You know, some people forget, but, like, they actually made a Pong game on PlayStation. You remember that?

2028
02:10:55,000 --> 02:11:02,000
And it actually sold pretty well, because they took Pong and they, like, kind of 3D-ified it a little bit, and they made all these...

2029
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
2D-ified it.

2030
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:18,000
Speaking of Pong, I remember on the Xbox, man, when they came out, it was Rockstar. I forget what they were testing, but they had that simple little ping pong game that came out, and it was just one stick back and forth, hit the X button, hit the A button.

2031
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:26,000
And there wasn't really any... I don't know what the word... I don't want to say there wasn't any skill to it, but there wasn't a lot of mystique to it, like, figure it out pretty quick.

2032
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:28,000
Rockstar Table Tennis, I think it was fun.

2033
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:37,000
Dude, we played that more than we ever played hockey or football or anything. Like, it was getting intense. It was getting intense, man. Holy shit. Some of the battles.

2034
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:43,000
We even tried to play real ping pong at one point in real life. I'm going to tell you right now, real ping pong is not as fun.

2035
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:44,000
Real ping pong's hard.

2036
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:52,000
Real ping pong's hard, man. You can't get a good rhythm going. But sometimes you got to play those real games, man. Let's talk about the kids and the real games, man.

2037
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:57,000
And the real games. You know what's fun to play with your kids? Real games, man. Real fucking games.

2038
02:11:57,000 --> 02:12:03,000
I saw my kid play Minecraft. Because I was lazy this morning, and my wife wasn't home.

2039
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:13,000
I said, here's your waffles. Daddy's going to, you know, read the newspaper, play some Minecraft, and he made a little racetrack. Put a little ball on it and it rolls down.

2040
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:19,000
He was proud of his little racetrack. He's four years old. Yeah, he was proud of his little fucking racetrack. That's good, Daniel.

2041
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:24,000
That's great for four years old, building that kind of thing. You got a genius kid, Jim Sally.

2042
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:31,000
Well, you know, he's got time, man. You Canadian kids, man. It's a little bit easier up here. We got vaccinations and shit. Anyway.

2043
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:35,000
Also, I want Jim Sally to make me waffles.

2044
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:39,000
Dude, come over any time, Jim.

2045
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
I'm on my way.

2046
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:47,000
I wake up all the adults, I say, okay, adults, enough is enough. It's 10 o'clock and I want to smoke weed. Wake the fuck up.

2047
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:56,000
Your house is probably, I know you joke before you live like way out in the middle of nowhere, Canada, but your house is probably easier to get to than the Video Game Hall of Fame in Iowa.

2048
02:12:56,000 --> 02:13:02,000
Dude, for sure, man. If you want to set up the VOG Hall of Fame, I'll gladly have the Canadian affiliate here. I could put up a barn or something.

2049
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,000
Let me just put up some posters, man.

2050
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:10,000
I'm down with that. The VOG Hall of Fame at Jim Sally's house in Canada. I'm down with that.

2051
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:15,000
Where the fuck were we? Yeah, we told him about a little boy. So I told him to put his tech away.

2052
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:22,000
Okay, daddy. And he went into his toy room and he started grabbing all the different tracks and shit from his fucking various Hot Wheel cars and stuff.

2053
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:28,000
None of this shit matches up or nothing. It's all busted. And he sat there and he was trying to put it together.

2054
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:34,000
And he just looked at me and he said, I want it to work like Minecraft, daddy.

2055
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:48,000
And I understood his frustration, man, that sometimes for kids, there's a lot more fun and reward and they can kind of, they can kind of express it and dig into their creativity a little further if they have these tools in front of them.

2056
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:56,000
And for a second, I thought about giving him back his fucking, his iPad. And I said, what would fucking Portuguese mama do in this situation?

2057
02:13:56,000 --> 02:14:01,000
Portuguese mama used to constantly give me rolls of duct tape and say, figure something out.

2058
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:06,000
So I did the same thing, man. I got a roll of duct tape out and we just duct taped the shit out of all those pieces of track.

2059
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:12,000
And we made a better track in real life. Put some golf balls in there, started throwing them down the fucking track.

2060
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:19,000
And then the cat would come over and bat the fucking track. We'd fucking squirt the cat with a water gun. We would squirt the cat with a water gun.

2061
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:27,000
And Danny would look at me and say, what's going on, Danny? He would say, daddy, I'm going to go prone so I can get a better shot.

2062
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:30,000
And I say, God damn, did he learn that from a video game?

2063
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:34,000
You can get prone and shoot that cat, right? And it's fucking little cat face, man.

2064
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:37,000
Hey, hey, hey, be nice to the cats. Be nice to the cats.

2065
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:43,000
That fucking cat, dude. My wife made me get a cat and the fucking thing is on the counter all the time eating my fucking leftover spaghetti.

2066
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:49,000
He's eating my fucking, I went to go take fucking socks out of the hamper and the fucker chewed a hole in my sock. Fuck that cat, man.

2067
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:54,000
Fuck him. Fuck him. I'm getting my boy every super soaker I can fucking find at Walmart this year.

2068
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:57,000
That cat's going to fucking get water bored. Anyway.

2069
02:14:57,000 --> 02:15:02,000
I just, I have to read some of the comments. I have to read some of the comments from chat.

2070
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:06,000
Because Bonds006 has taken the lesson from this. Duct tape fixes all. I agree with that.

2071
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:11,000
Sg100Matt says, the world would be a better place if everyone had Jim Salley's energy. Cosign.

2072
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:17,000
I'd have to agree.

2073
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:20,000
Alright. Any last thoughts before I let you go, my friend?

2074
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:28,000
Last thoughts, man. I'm going to put out to everybody here with video games and limiting your kids' screen time and shit.

2075
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:36,000
You know what? The best way, you know, to involve your kids in screen time is to involve yourself in the screen time with them, man.

2076
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:40,000
So sit down beside your kids when they're doing some shit on the fucking iPad, you know?

2077
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:46,000
Maybe play a game online with them or something. I can tell you there's only two possibilities, people, okay?

2078
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:49,000
Number one, you're going to learn some shit about your kids. Maybe have some fun.

2079
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:56,000
Or number two, they're going to think it's, you know, stupid now because mom and dad are doing it and they're going to find something better to do.

2080
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
Win-win. Win-win.

2081
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:11,000
Jim Salley, when you first called into this show years and years ago on the All Games Network, I didn't think that one day we'd be getting parenting advice from you.

2082
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:15,000
But here we are and it's pretty damn good advice, to be honest.

2083
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:19,000
Hey, man. I got this shit all night.

2084
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:24,000
Alright. Take care, my friend. It's always a pleasure to hear from you.

2085
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
Yeah, man. I'll talk to you guys soon, man. You take care.

2086
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
Alright. Take care, buddy. Bye-bye.

2087
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:29,000
Bye.

2088
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:32,000
That was great. That's absolutely right on the money, right?

2089
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:33,000
Yep.

2090
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:39,000
Sit there and play the games with your kids. Maybe if the parents in the Fortnite situation had done that, maybe it'd be a little different. I love that.

2091
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:43,000
Or your kid is just going to think this isn't cool anymore because mom and dad are into it.

2092
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:47,000
No, I think my kids would like if I was more into, I don't know.

2093
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:53,000
I try to get them into all sorts of things, but then they only want to play Roblox.

2094
02:16:54,000 --> 02:17:00,000
Although I did, oh, I forgot to mention, I did play a little bit of Roblox this week because, well, because my son was trying, he needed my help.

2095
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:07,000
So he was playing this game. It was like some high school game where you do high school things.

2096
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:10,000
And so he was driving a car and he wanted to get the car into the school.

2097
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:17,000
So like, like inside the school building. And so I was helping him drive it up the stairs and got that fucker up the stairs too.

2098
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
Good job. Congrats.

2099
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:22,000
And then I drove it into a pool on accident.

2100
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:29,000
All right. I don't see anybody else waiting in the green room. So I think, I think that's going to do it for the live calls tonight.

2101
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:32,000
If you do want to think or you think of something after the fact, you want to let us know about it.

2102
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:36,000
You can always email us. Again, it's participate at orange lounge radio dot com.

2103
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:40,000
Or you can send us a tweet. Twitter dot com slash OLR is a great place for that.

2104
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:47,000
Or I don't know. Send us a message one way or another. You could probably write it in crayon and we'll probably see it one way or another.

2105
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:51,000
As many ways to get a hold of us. That is that's going to about do it for another episode.

2106
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:56,000
A little bit of a shorter show tonight, but we just didn't really have the same amount of news tonight.

2107
02:17:56,000 --> 02:18:02,000
And Dark Soccer is not here. So she'll be back next week, though, missing her tonight and hope she's doing well.

2108
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:08,000
So she'll be back next week. We'll be back next week for another live show and then we'll actually be off for a week.

2109
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:14,000
So Bobby will get to do a longer show if he's able to get a certain guest on October 20th.

2110
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:19,000
So that'll be in two weeks time. But actually, well, we're going to try to record something in advance.

2111
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:23,000
So hopefully our podcast folks will still have something and there'll be something for you guys to actually watch.

2112
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:29,000
We just won't actually be here live. So it's important for you guys to know that because, you know, it's cool that you guys like chat along with this.

2113
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:34,000
But I it would be really bad if you were expecting us to be reading it in the moment.

2114
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:39,000
So I'm going to release games on the Amika, but I'm only going to make it so that the camera is fixed in one spot.

2115
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:44,000
And we'll call it two point five D. Although it'll be secretly fully 3D.

2116
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:48,000
You got to let it go. All right. We're going to go around and get everybody's final thoughts, though.

2117
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:52,000
I want to thank you guys, of course, for listening to Orange Lounge Radio this week.

2118
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:55,000
If you enjoyed what you heard here at the show, tell a friend or two about the show.

2119
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:58,000
Help us spread the word because we are the show where every gamer has a voice.

2120
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:03,000
But if the voices aren't here to air, then, you know, we can't really talk to them.

2121
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:08,000
So help us spread the word. A nice five star review on a place like iTunes or wherever it is you found this show.

2122
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:14,000
That goes an awful long way. Also, the auto hosting on Twitch is awesome, awesome, awesome.

2123
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:18,000
Even if you don't really do a lot of streaming yourself, the hosting is a great discoverability thing.

2124
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:23,000
So we appreciate everybody that goes out of their way to host VOG network on Sunday nights.

2125
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:28,000
That is about going to do it. Let's get final thoughts for the night and then we'll wrap up. Loki, your final thought tonight.

2126
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:31,000
I plan on working more on my game.

2127
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:38,000
I was finally getting some actual progress done, but I've been stuck on one thing for like a long time.

2128
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:44,000
I want to get this part done so I can move on to something else. And I'm almost there.

2129
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:51,000
And my final thought is I'm looking to play some Mario Maker 2 this week and hopefully some Horizon Zero Dawn.

2130
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:55,000
But I am traveling, so I've got to squeeze that in amongst the MMOs that I'm always playing.

2131
02:19:55,000 --> 02:20:00,000
Oh, and also next Saturday is the big Ingress battle here in Sacramento.

2132
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:05,000
So good luck to all my Enlightened around the world if you're participating in Umbra this weekend.

2133
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:08,000
So we're going to do our very, very best right here in Sacramento.

2134
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:11,000
And either I'll be in a really good mood next week or I'll be in a really bad one.

2135
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
So you can tell how I went.

2136
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:16,000
So yeah, I can't wait to see you guys in seven days.

2137
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:19,000
So thanks so much for tuning in to another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2138
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:22,000
Have a great week, everybody. We will see you next time.

2139
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
Until then, happy gaming.
